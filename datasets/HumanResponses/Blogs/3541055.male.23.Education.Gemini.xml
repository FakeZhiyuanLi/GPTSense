       Hmmm...., i have broken my own record of sleeping. I slept for about 15 hours today...., Well, i know this is 2 much. Khair. Well, tlaked to Imm bhai yesterday about studies and again my steps shaked a bit that y not i go abroad for studies. But i think i'll stick to my masters from N.E.D then will go for my Ph.d. Although my interest in Graphics is growing much now. But my field according to my studies is going deep into computer systems while graphics is a computer science topic. So, i think i will do another masters or will took some courses in graphics from any other university other than in Pakistan and will do my Ph.d. Waisay i am thinking about learning drawing. Does anybody from u know which would be the best place? Hmm..., going offline again to get some sleep. ;) got to go to office tommorow bhai. Allah-Hafiz.

Waisay bhiii yaaar, Janain seh kiyaa farkh padtaa hay Mazaa tou anain kaaa hay. Tou Immm bhai, i'll be there at 3rd or 4th of July. ;). Inshaa-Allah Will be looking forward to meet u. Got my day off today for a silly mistake i made. Well, light got off and i forgot to iron my dress for the morning. :(. so, what could i do I called the office and said i won't be comming. Hmm..., AD bhai, the problem is not that i would be running after other people's papers the problem with me is some what the same as was with Sucratt.  His saying as i remember is ' I don't know anything, The only thing i know is that i don't know anything'. The problem with reading is that the more you read you realize that You still don't know enough. :(  Khair, Thats what i said to Imm bhaii keh Yaaar, life is 2ooooooooo short.  Khair, i know you people must be looking forward to change the channel. so, i voulenteerly switch off till the next time. Allah-Hafiz.

       I spend my day in office on Saturday for some sort of final testing of our new product. After winding-up spent my 4 hours filling up form for master's application. When I got finished and emailed at my personal account,  found that e-mailed file no contained fully filled form....then I came to know that I deleted that file acceentially and e-maled wrong file. :'( Sometimes it happens when all messed-up. But as Adi bhai says He is present...it relaxed me a lot and I'm planning to complete it today evening InshAllah again. Pray for me plz....

       After Gmail n Yahoo, Hotmail also announce to be a comrade of this race, that it also upgrading its storage of accounts upto 250 MB. But i guess all is nothing but inspiration of Gmail,its really funny that Gamil is not appeal for its size but more it worth coz of its Searching Technique stuff....well my advice to Gmail Team is its better if they put there slogan unlike most spam mail have "SIZE DOESN'T MATTER":)  URL: http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/040623/microsoft_hotmail_4.html

       I'm confused, Who is Intezar? Initially I thought that he is Salman cuz he has same nick on MSN. Sometimes I think that he is Fawad but then I change my mind cuz Intezar seems very reasonable person.  Then I think he is Wasif cuz he is also doing Masters from NED, but still confused :-S Please tell who is intezar

        urlLink Random thoughts of UITgineers  Well, got up late today cuz, i had taken half day today to get my registeration done from   N.E.D. So, i dressed up and went for N.E.D while we were in the way near Malir talking to each other she suddenly got upset and stop responding to me. I was puzzled cuz, it had happend to me first time through out our relationship that she had stopped responding without even telling me the reason. So, now i was all alone guessing what seems to be the problem. An idea clicked me that may be it is the way i used to push her to limits that made her so upset. I realized that i should better appolagize before things get more serious. So, i initiated the talk and said that hey listen i m so sorry, if only i had cared more about you wouldn't be so angry at me. Suddenly she showed some positive response and gave me a gesture that i thoght of assuring me that it is ok. But palz, i was dreaming at my highest level she started to show me more aggresive angry behaviour. Although i told her keh daikhoo yeh achii baat nahien hay subah hii subah aisii baat nahien honi chaa hiyah. Khair, while i reached N.E.D i realize that during the drive and talking to her i have forgot to take money out from ATM machine. Meant, i would be unable to register today. I really got angry and after doing my rest of the work i drived to the office with her slowly, quitely. When i reached office i left her without even talking to her. Office main bhii saraa din baizaaar baizaar saa guzraa. Khair, when i arrived home she entered the home with me. I was both angry and frustrated at the same time. I kicked her on the back and said, "Abay ooo bike! yeh bhii koi waqt thaa kharaab honay kaa. Saraa din barbaad karwaa diyaa".  :) Achaa dostoo abb chaltaa hooon. Allah-Hafiz. Sonay kaa waqt hoo gayaa hay.

       Ufff! kiyaa haseen din hay aur mausam tou hooo rahaa hay sea side janay kaa. Waisay, u know what i really like to sit on the shore alone and just observe what people are doing. It really relax my mind. It is really charming when waves come and touch the shore and go back saying we'll be back. Aisay waqt i remember Junaid's Shair saying: Paas rehnaan door janaan. Abb agay i don't remember so just enjoy reading till here :) Waisay abb i know u people will be thinking who is door. Yaaar, jabb koi cheez paas naan hoo tou planning hii hotii hay.So, i m doing which i can do. :) Khair, today i m really tired cuz, my office time today would be from 9:00 till 9:00. But i really enjoy interacting with people. So, although i would be busy i wouldn't be getting bore. Its been long time listening from you people. Imm bhaii kii tou samajh main atiii hay. Where are you guys. Khair, abb main apnaa khabarnamaan khatam kartaa hoon. Allah-Hafiz.

        urlLink Random thoughts of UITgineers   Well, i am still awake and can't sleep so, i thought let us write something about Dill Biilll. Yaar, waisay yeh jou dill bhai hain naan, it defies most of the rules of science. Cuz, it has a severe impact on our decisions and expression although our mind controls most of our actions. And you know what the current research says there are neurons present in our heart as well. That was a smashing news for me. As sometimes yeh dill bhai realy troubles me.  Abb tum sab loog yeh naan samajhnaan keh mujh koo dill kaa arzaa hoo gayaa hay. The point is bhai, world is so purfareeb keh dil kaa slip honaan tou chootii baaat hay Charooon shanain chitt ho jataa hay. Waisay baday boodhooon kaa kehnaan hay keh Girtay  hain shehsawar hii maidaan-e-jang main. Par phir humm soochtay hain keh yaar, naan hiii yeh maidaan-e-jang hay aur naan hiii abhii takk koi muqabil hay. Abb aa bhii kabhii kaisay saktaa hay jabb aap kaa iradaaa hii naan hooo. Waisay woooh kehtay hain naan keh save your charms for somebody. Well, i hope that somebody comes before this body which is infront of everybody becomes the dead body. Waisay agar deadbody bhii hooo jaaa aiiiy tou koi baat nahien Inshaa-Alllah Allah hum gunaah garoon kii ghaltiyaan maarf karday gaaa tou phirr yeh sabb tou hotaa hii rahay gaaa.  App logooon kiii blong without interest read karnain kaa Thanks.  Abb humm really going for sleeping. Allah-Hafiz.

       *words* Sometimes if you want to see a change for the better, you have to take things into your own hands. Once you decide to be at the level of choice, you take responsibility for your life and gain control of it....If you don't run your own life, someone else will....You're in control of your life to the degree that you make the decisions. If you let others make decisions for you, you have no control. When you control the decisions, you control the actions.....So, take charge of your life. You don't have to ask permission of other people. Don't give someone veto power over your life.....If not you, then who? If not now, then when?

        urlLink Random thoughts of UITgineers  This last post of AD is saying me secretly,"Share your experience" btw I'm certified uncle after December 27, 2003. Many of my age colleagues (unmarried) asked me what difference u feel in before and after marriage.  I've usually no or very ambiguous answeer for it. Reason behind this is I dint even think about it. I'm watching life as a person watching trees outside the train.....things change and does not notice changes anymore. when I see my life an year behind , it was really very changed. Good or bad I can't say cuz change is just change...somethings to be happened u can't hide but when...u may have a little authority given by Almighty Allah for this.

       Hmm......,            Assalaam-O-Alaikum, hhaaaaaaaaaaah I feel nice to be back in home again. But i think i would never ever forget about this short trip to few place up country. I was pretty excited about this trip and you know what this one really worth it. I enjoyed the beauty of the nature and tried my best to capture maximum of her in my camera but Alas! I realized one thing, " Beauty resides in the eyes of the beholder". Iss dafaah gaoon janain kaa mazaa hii kuch aur thaa din koo kadakay kii garmii aur raaaat koo day dhanaa dan Barish. Ufff..., Extreme weather thaa Punjaab main. Marii was the place i enjoyed the most and will remember each and every moment of it ( I am sure i'll). Uss beauty keh style nain kiyaa delight dee hay mann koo naan poochoo dostoo. Main tou pictures kheench kheench keh pagal saa hoo gayaa. Yahan tak keh camera said keh bhai 'battery low'. Aray humm nain kahaa aray humm tou abhii charge howay hain aur tumm hoo keh discharge hoo gaa aiiy. Laikin yaar to be honest this is the first time is stayed in a gaoon in mari and really enjoyed the scenery. hoooooooooooh, feeling dizzy now people will talk to ya guys later.

       Imran,the questions u put are not that much easy to answer,but i'll try my best to provide what i have for it;mind it i m not giving solution but just putting my thoughts regarding it.  Well,going for Master's Degree really sometimes demanding a big brain-storming,and i guess suppose to be because you are going to invest your precious time, your loud coins and also compromising at some peosonal issues..specially when going abroad for it!...and i guess Home sickness is a BIG-ONE, observed paki's have more influence then anyone else!   Going for Masters or Phd really worth?   Imran,technically, you should ask this question from the Experts of your Specific-job-field ,otherwise Jacks misleads you!...Trust me its a very strong Formula for whole-Life!.  anyways wat i think, its depends on the nature of ur job! as for example ,if your job is related to academia and research then u must to go for Masters and Phd; u dont have any other option then!. And If ur job is as a pure Techi guy...so u have many options, for example a techi person may go for MS & Phd and also for the specific Technical certification, related to job. One thing more, circumstances shows,for most techi MBA is great choice , specially for IT techis ,coz its veryHectic to be a techi for whole-life in IT!...i guess we all can realize it now!...its really blah!i dont mean those who dont want to taste the other seens of this beautiful life, other than their machine n chilled  room!...as i heard ,when power failure is occured at Sun labortary so the ppl comes out, never be seen before by onyone...its reality!   conclusion:  Do the big big brain storming on it, and for fruit-fulness, concern some Experts in this regard!and never make decisions on jacks comments!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  secondly,as u asked: 1)What is basically human satisfaction ? 2)big money ??3) better respect ??4) is the criteria same for everyone?    my answers(just mine,here u aslo suppose to use above formula ,yep asked Expert):   1)I am human,I know my self ...I never satisfy ;look even i say Allhamdulillah becuase heard that Allah Taa'la put more barkath in present gift by saying Allhamdulillah...and its OK as well!but Listen there are two things... human nature and human satisfaction!both are different, human nature is to go for more...and HUMAN  satisfaction is to get more but from right ways; mind it HUMAN mean ture HUMAN,not those who has a same look n feel!  2)YES 3)YES 4)NO  Finally,doing tactics to make yourself more worthful is 'Zaroori',and if u think after doing MS and Phd u become more worthful..so dont mis it!...JUST DO IT!...otherwise u dont know 'kay' which thing is missing in your life!  AS far as future surety is concern, so all humans have limited knowledge,no one can satisfy u,u must to ask this thing from the One Who has limitless knowledge,yes, and He is only Allah Taa'la! DO ISTIKHARA for future surety...and its a misconcept that after doing istikhara u encounter some signs or bla bla..NO! not at all ,istikhara is just a dua and Mashwarah (consultation) with Allah taa'la...and even after u did istikhara do what u think is good for u....decision must be taken by u according to ur wisdom..NOT SUPPOSE TO FOLLOW ANY SIGNS and nor they show! Must to read this link for ISTIKHARA: http://www.albalagh.net/qa/istikharah.shtml  hummm...i guess i make a jumble..so sorry...but i have this...but i pray Allah Taa'la to make it easy for u to make a right decision and even if decision is wrong so He has power to make fruitful; even we chose rubbish..so pray to Allah whatever we chose or will do.. plz make it worthfull for us!...Ameen  waslam

Today I'm thinking why should I do masters? May be I'm trying to do it to persue for Phd....but why Phd?? To make big money? for self satisfaction ? What if I'll not satisfied after Phd? What is basically human satisfaction ? big money ?? better respect ?? is the criteria same for everyone? what you people think?? what if I continue working in my field and get expertise in this field not trying to do masters nor Phd. Will it make difference? what u people think ???

       hello ppls,Aay Dee here!!! yes yes I can see u r excited! :-) o ya...today i m here with something new, taste a new flavour of my blog...here i start:  Someone is going to take a travel around the world. Someone is going to find that special someone. Someone is going to accomplish SOMETHING. Someone is going to ....................   Why not you (if not)?   We spend so much time looking at other people's success and replying with "yeah, but that could never be me."   Why not? Why can't you be the one who succeeds?  Why can't you be the one who fulfills a life-long dream?  Why can't you be the one who's life changes for the better?    The truth is:  You can.(if didn't)   I have found again and again that those who succeed are not always the brightest, the best connected, the most attractive or even the best educated. Those who succeed are those who persevere.They refuse to giveup. If you can just make consistent effort, you can be one of those success stories.  BTW the success is not confine,my success is mine and your is yours and  Intizaar success is Intizaa's  and all knows what Intizaar have,so Intizaar I guess you feel a bit energize after having my words:-) *be consistent*

       Asslamo Aleykum wa Rehmath'uallah wa Barakata'hu! Yes I m back from picninc… Allhamdulillah, enjoyed there a lot…  Its my first official picnic with office fellows….dated (25th-july-2004) And Allhamdulillah its really marvelous… We are around 25 people… Packed in one van and three cars… Venue was Hawksbay… We reached there  around 11:00 am… The sea was not roaring that much as we heard about it.. According to my observation its almost normal… But I didn’t go ‘Aagay’… Coz whenever I tried to go a bit deep,a live guard honk!...  We had biryani and Chiken-Tikka in lunch… Yes had all Bar-B-Q stuff with us for chiken tikka.. I also participate in doing Bar-B-Q … And now become an experience Bar-B-Q man! (*not boy)  Hey Intizaar , remember, Saleem have some plan to give us Bar-B-Q Treat …. Yes yes Saleem is giving treat coz of his Job!...mashAllah. Hey Saleem, I love to give my services in doing any Sort of Bar-B-Q.. So arrange it asap!   ok!  We played cricket, foot ball, and hand ball… In hand ball whole office is divided in 2 teams… Oh yes the division in which I m …WON! ;) And suppose to be….coz now a days I m in FORM!  Ok! we start our back journey After Maghrib…and reach at our places around Isha’s-Azan!   Humm…Allah-ho-Akbar! The sea is of the great Sign of Allah Subana-hu-Taal’a When I packed my stuff , as we ready to back.. I went closer to ‘Kinara’ and gave a deep look at sea and read the verse… ‘Rab-ul Mashriq wa Rab-ul Maghrib’ ‘He is the Lord of the east and west’…Allah-ho-Akbar just imagine how powerful is the Creator of this biggest sea.. Oh ppl never forget to Remember Him…our Creator! Take Allah’s name and all your needs, all your work will be taken care of. He who creates days and night is sufficient for the needs of the day and night.. So never run here n there for your needs.. only Ask Him, and trust me ,surely u’ll get what u want! Ok jee…inshAllah c u guyz soon… Waslam!

       Assalaam-O-Alaikum, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah Yeah, i know u people are tired of listening to me but what can i do abb person has to do some time pass yaaar. khair, so now be ready to read some new i meant old ooooh, i meant mixture of new and old stuff. Well, for a few days i was feeling staying home is becoming so static and boring as well. So, day before yesterday i decided to do something new. Hence, i decided to sleep in the hall for a few days from now on. Well, those who haven't come to my house wouldn't have the clear picture of the hall, so,&nbsp; you guys just keep on reading even if you get any picture or not. Cuz, i don't have much time yaaar i am a very busy person. Khair, you guys ask alot and every time you guys take me off the topic. Haaan, so what was i talking about hmm..., okz i remember. Well, to tell&nbsp;u the truth i got the time to look at the sky after a long time and it fealt so beautiful that i can't express in words. Well, i wake up early in the morning and then i realized why people in Gaoon usually sleep in open. There is a great mechanism as far as i understood. The&nbsp;birds will start to whistle into your ears and you won't be able to sleep any more then when i took a deep breath while getting up i realized that i haven't fealt that refreshing for a long time. You know when was the last time i used to get the fealing? Well, i assume you guyz don't know khair. The days when i used to go to UIT through Karachi Golf Club road. Oooh Man, there are so many trees and lush grass out there that used to make me feel good. Khair, when i looked at my Red Rose plant its leafs were all covered with Shabnam aray yaar, now please don't be dumb and don't start asking me keh where was Nadeem. Bhai, Shabnam Shabnam the real Shabnam not that actress baba. Khair, don't feel embarrassed and i won't say much to you now, cuz, i am getting use to ya guys. Hmm..., This whole environment abated all my static feelings. I fealt recharged again. And i drived to office after taking breakfast of course with the abundance of happy feelings.  Well, this is it for now. I'll be back after few hours. Allah-Hafiz.

       Okaaay,               Yeah Yeah i am back again atlast from my home PC. Yep! line was dead and wasn't able to connect for long. Hmmm.. AD bhai you look real busy now-a-days what is the big deal man? Read your review looks as if you are passing your time by reading stories. Long time didn't hear from other members looks like they are on recieving end only. khair, yesterday i went to ieee conference in N.E.D. I really enjoyed that one it really made me laugh. You know why? bhai, it was like somebody is having a function on his backyard. They were not punctual. The conference has to be started by 9:30 and i got there at 9:20. Guess when it started? at 10:45 it was pathetic. Few of the papers were fine others were like promotional activities. Khair, i bear it all by 5:00 and at tea break I ran away from there. Uffff..., i realized keh UIT's ieee conference was better than this. Khair, got to go now. Allah-Hafiz.

       One of my bhanji in three, the elder one, always chip in reading her story books, yes if not always so most of the time I found her with books, and now its becomes her habit. Anyways today I picked one of her story and start to read, just to have an idea that what makes her to lost in these stories. The story book seems like a series story, and its title is ‘SWEET VALLEY TWINS’, she (my bhanji) told me that its her one of the favourite series. This series having so many stories, but all are revolving around the two twins sisters, Elizabeth and Jessica, even both are twins but their nature is totally opposite to each other, Elizabeth is pretty sober and of caring nature, while Jessica is very out social  and of don’t care nature. But both twins are best friend as well, they also have one elder brother of 14 named Steven, but Steven character in stories is not so prominent, he only appears when having some fun or just by the way.   Well, today I am here with a review of the story, though I don’t end it all but I just want to make a review till what I read, the name of story is HOLIDAY MISCHIEF, hum, here I starts its review:  All the children of school are gathered at auditorium, both twins are also there , all are waiting for some announcement, the Head Mistress comes to the stage and make an announcement, that there is a big hymn competition  (children songs comp)  suppose to be happen at Washington, D.C .Our school also invited to there to perform, now we are in process to find out those children who are good in singing, all who wish to go there with choral group suppose to appear in test of selection.  Both twins eagerly want to go there at Washington D.C , as they never before there, they situated at California, also both have guts to sing well as well.  Now today is a test for selection, so many children are standing in rows, and waiting for their call, Jessica is normal and having a gossips with her mates without having any worries, but Elizabeth is quite upset, coz she don’t want to miss the chance to be at Washington D.C, Elizabeth saw her friend Anna, and say hello to her, but Anna looks very much upset, yep more than ‘Lizze’ (Lizze is a nick of Elizabeth),Lizze asked Anna, does any thing wrong with you??? She replied that I am nervous coz I suppose to give a test but my Voice is so dumb, I am afraid I’ll reject! Lizze call out Jessica and tell her about Anna, Jessica giggle and ask Anna to sing, so we can tell you how you do, may be you do well, now you just afraid of worries. Well, when Anna starts to sing Both twins look each and other, Anna is really so dumb to sing, well , after Anna end Jessica ask Anna you better leave the test otherwise you must be rejected, Anna start to sob, she said,in any case I want to go Washington, otherwise its too late for me for something! Both twins amazed at her and asked for what she talking about, now Anna start to tell her story to them….(Blah ..its getting long yaar…I have to go …so sorry….to be continue….)

          Hmm..., back again to eat you people's brain. Khair, I asked one of relative who recently got married that how much did it cost you to get married? Well, you dumb people cost him in terms of money not in..... Khair, lets come to the topic Well, he saide two and a half lakh rupees I got shocked when he says the remaining magic word "Only". The idea came into my mind that if I had two and a half lakh rupees I would have bought Suzuki mehran in used condition. Khair, then you know guys what the other people sitting close by to us responded with? Well, they said oooh! It is not that "much" and i said What? What did you say? I think I must have misheard you guys. They said really now-a-days Shadi normally costs lik 4 to 5 lakh rupees. And you know what? I nearly fainted by that statement. Aray baba if marriage cost that much then I think I am happy alone.  Well, then I gave it a second thought and made a decision that I won't spend more than 50,000 in my marriage and that will include Valima only. No khanan Wanaan on Nikkah no dresses to Dulhan's maan, Abaa, Khaloo, Chachoo, Behan... etc. Well, I wouldn't like to feed such people who will take life out of ya and even then criticize on you. Yeah! thats true people come and eat and drop a lot of stuff while eating... Even if you arrange the eating stuff from top class restaurant they just can't live without criticizing. Dulhaa kii Amaan aisii theen, Dulhaa kii behan nain yeh kar diyaa, Dulhaa waloon main seh kisii nain mairii palate lay lii Waghaira Waghaira.. I won't be entertaining such people. Well, I would prefer putting all the money that I save from it to the joint account of me and my ... :) rather than spending on these stupid Sons of guns.  Khair, what do you guys say in practical terms means, in figures that how come a person can save money on marriage. I would like to hear from the most experienced person in the chamber as well. Well, till then it is Assalaam-O-Alaikum from my side.
