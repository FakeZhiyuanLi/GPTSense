       The weekly endorsement ---   The Single  - If You're Not the One - Daniel Bedingfield - for everyone who thought a dance song could never make you cry  The Tube  - Out Of Sight - George Clooney/Jennifer Lopez/ Steven Soderberg -USA Network - Ironic cause I hated this movie the first time I saw it... I've watched three times on USA now, they'll probably be playing twice a day for the next month, catch it if you can.  The Classic  - Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury - Shame on your high school English teacher for convincing you that this was only about politics and oppression... its also about the quiet desperate longing for what should be.  The Movie  - The Hunted - Benicio DelToro/Tommy Lee Jones - Tommy Lee Jones in a beard, you know you're feeling it ladies :-) ... seriously, yeah its a retread of the first Rambo movie, but its a pretty good retread...

       Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - Horas   urlLink article .   I've been waiting for this war to hit home, I've been waiting for it all to become real.  Live videophone reports from CNN didn't, countless hours of television coverage, countless discussions with friends... it still feels a million miles away, another Somolia, or Kosovo, or Panama, another military action which will only affect my life in a passing way... It was the story of Jessica Lynch that brought it home, that reminded me that no matter how necessary, no matter how just, war is a terrible thing...  "A pretty 19-year-old country girl who joined the US Army to escape unemployment was feared to be the first woman soldier to die yesterday...Private Jessica - known as Jessie - only joined up because she could not find a job in her farming community home town of Palestine, West Virginia. Lorene Cumbridge, a 62-year-old cousin, said:  She s just a West Virginia country girl. Warm-hearted, Outgoing, I really thought growing up she would become an elementary school teacher."   I can't be sure why this hit so hard, why it made me go into the bathroom at work and cry.  Maybe because I know of poverty and smalltown life, of the escape that military service offers.  I know feeling that you have no options and needing out.  Maybe because I've been through West Virginia, seen her mountains and rivers... maybe because too many things born in that state have already died this year... maybe at heart I'm just an emo kid...

       Some of you are probably wondering why a movie buff like myself hasn't commented on the Oscars yet, truth is I didn't have a horse in this race and couldn't really get into it this year.  I usually enjoy serious movies quite a bit, and had kept up with the likely Oscar contenders until about thirty great movies came out in December.  Remember that back in October we thought Road to Perdition was a lock, the Rookie was the 'feel good movie of the year' and that Eminem and Adam Sandler might get best actor noms... Those movies were great, as were The Two Towers, Gangs of New York, About a Boy, Signs, Narc, Auto Focus, Black Hawk Down, Changing Lanes, Rodger Dodger, 24 Hour Party People, Igbie Goes Down, and 25th Hour,  but without seeing Adaptation, The Hours, About Schmidt, Chicago, or the Pianist I couldn't really root for them.... still I shall do my civic duty and put down SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS FROM THE 2002 OSCARS, there will probably be some more later...  What the heck happened to Steve Martin?  He hosted arguably the best Oscars telecast ever two years ago, this year he was only able to score laughs off of Ernest Borgnine, Mickey Rooney, and Queen Latifah's bossom. I could have scored laughs off Ernest Borgnine, Mickey Rooney, and Queen Latifah's bossom.  In case your not familiar with Michael Moore, he was not drunk last night.  He always looks, talks, and smells like that.  Remember how surreal it was when Eminem and Elton had the duet at the grammys?  It was just disturbing to hear Barbara Streisand say "and the Oscar goes to... Eminem" ( and did you see the look on her face?)  Chicago was the biggest movie last night, arguably in terms of influence of the year, yet Em still kicks its butt in the original song category.  You the man Shady...  Maybe the Academy new they were voting for the one song that captured the heart and message of its movie like no other over the last year, more likely the members just voted for the only one of the songs they had actually listened to this year.  How did Brian Cox turn in so many great performances last year (25th Hour, Adaptation, The Ring, The Rookie) and not pick up a single nomination?  On a related note how did one of the greatest movies of the year, 25th Hour, get no recognition whatsoever.  It had three performances that could have won best supporting (Brian Cox, Barry Pepper, Philip Seymour Hoffman), and could certainly have been recognized for cinematography or adapted screenplay (although there may have never been a more worthy or crowded group for best adapted)... the movie captured post 9-11 Manhattan in a way that no other movie has even tried.  Everyone whose still calling Gangs a love letter to New York needs to check out 25th Hour.... Heck Spike even coaxed a great performance out of former NFL lineman Tony Siragusa.  I didn't win best actor this year.  Can I still kiss Halle Berry?  No I have not seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  No I do not regret that.

       There were two stories above the fold in Sunday's Morning News, "Halfway to Baghdad: US Troops close in on Republican Guard" and "Cowboys unveil plan for stadium: Envisioned: retractable roof, open end zones leading to virtual city." ... I always thought it would take a war to change this city, apparently a war wasn't enough....

       'You realize if we played by the rules right now we'd be in gym?'  My church singles group sucessfully pulled off an eighties skate night Saturday without any actual eighties music.  They played some music recorded during the eighties, a little Warrant, some AC/DC, but no eighties music.  No Flock of Seagulls, no Devo, no Soft Cell, no Modern English, no Tears for Fears... still it was fun, I rented a pair of skates and made an ass of myself (I only fell down twice though, and I still maintain that the second time was not my fault) bought a grup slushie and developed blisters on both my feet, plus a weird ache in my left quad... all in all a good night

       'Here we go, the world is spinning. When it stops, it's just beginning. Sun comes up, we all laugh. Sun goes down, we all die... '   I have just finished watching The Ring for the second time and in case you were wondering, IT IS THE SCARIEST ASS MOVIE OF ALL TIME,  I had already seen it once and it still scared the living hell from me so bad that I can't sleep... in fact The Ring had a round about role in me starting this blog.  It was after I watched it the first time and couldn't get to sleep until 4am that I spent about 3 hours on the Internet and finally registered my blog site, now I'm up again at 1:30am scared out of my pants and posting to my blog...  PS to everybody who thinks it would be a great idea to call someone's phone right after they've seen this movie.  You're not being original, everyone who ever saw the movie thought that...

       'Nothing is ever done in this world until men are prepared to kill each other if it is not done.' --George Bernard Shaw  We are at war, good American men and women will die, I have more than one man I have called a friend personally involved in this war, men who are putting more on the line than I ever have, to fight for something far bigger than us both… and yet my I find my thoughts running to preempts and cancelled ad contracts.  The money my company will lose if ABC doesn’t carry the Oscars or CBS the Final Four, and what a mess it will all be in recon…  If I ever needed reminding of what a selfish bastard I am, this is it.

       'You read Cosmopolitan?' 'I have three menstrually divergent sisters, Cosmo is my lifeline'  As I write this the president is addressing America with the message that we are now at war.  I have friends whose lives are directly in danger in this action; I am myself still young enough to be drafted if it comes to that.  And yet I’m writing about Dawson’s Creek.  The WB re-aired the first episode of Dawson’s Creek tonight, and I don’t care what anybody says, it is a great show.  Question my manhood, compare me to a pre-pubescent girl, I’ve heard it before and I just don’t care anymore.  The first episode wasn’t perfect (I don’t know if it was completely clear that Dawson a- likes movies b- his favorite director is Spielberg) but the basic themes were set up, friendship, unrequited love, my crush on Katie Holmes, my Wednesdays will be just a little less special when it ends this year….

       When I was seventeen my sister and I drove from King's Ferry New York to Greeneville Tennessee.  Twelve hours in my father's 1986 Monte Carlo, Moonpies and glass bottle Cokes, the Shenandoah Valley and Travel America truckstops... my first great road trip... We were only going to see my Mom's little sister, but really I was hoping to figure out my life.  Right out of high school, not cut out for college and scared to death of spending the rest of my life in upstate New York, I was totally lost... Somewhere in Virginia just south of the Mason Dixon we stopped at a Chevron station and I wrote 'Geoff was here' in the bathroom stall with a sharpie I had.  Still one of the few purely destructive acts I've ever done.  I'm still not sure why I did it, but I think I just wanted to leave a mark of some kind... It's been seven years since that trip, and I'd like to believe that things have changed, that I'm not that scared kid anymore, that I've grown and matured, but I have to admit he's still part of me, desperately wanting to be heard and understood and secretly thinking that no one cares enough to listen.... Maybe its pure ego, maybe its the slow realization that these thoughts will never become the great american novel and the hope that they're still interesting enough to be written down, maybe I'm jumping on a bandwagon, hopefully its just that I have something to say, more likely its that I'm too lazy to email all my friends... whatever the reason, I have joined the world of the bloggers....

       I really need to go to the grocery store; I am so out of food that I made Ramen Noodles for breakfast this morning.  I lived most of last week off of dozen eggs and a case of bagels my roommate scored at work.  All I have in the fridge is half a 12 pack of Dr. Peppers I scammed from Barry on Friday and a thing of horseradish sauce… I have been to this point many times in my life scrounging around for food, living off peanut butter, bananas, and white rice.  The difference is that in the past this was the result of abject poverty, while now I have plenty of money to buy food, I’m just too dang lazy to go to the store…

       I have one more test to take this week, after the one I took Sunday.  I have a 'case' for my intro to business class and I'm not even sure what a case is yet, and I have about six documents to write at work for Sarbanes Oxley, all of which are due tomorrow.  (My boss thought it was great to throw all the Sarbanes stuff into one week becase we didnt' have any training classes scheduled this week, great for her, but it freed up a full hour and a half out of my schedule)... its going to be a busy week...

        Do you know why the Yankees always win?  Because they've got Mantle?  No. It's because the other team's too busy staring at the pin stripes   The Yanks didn't have their pinstripes last night, they were dressed in the away grays.  They didn't have The Mick either, but managed to win, as they have for some time, without him.  3 - 2 at the Ballpark in Arlington in an unlikely pitchers duel.  I am a little embarrassed to say that this New York kid had to travel 1500 miles before he first saw the bronx bombers live, but it was well worth the mileage.  Seven dollar seats 3 tiers above home plate, cheese fries served in a collectible plastic cap, Mike Mussina on the mound, the joy of just wandering around the stadium with good friends on a beautiful april texas night... just about perfect...

       Had to spend about twenty minutes today tracking down a company named TVG to see how it should be listed in our client database, found out that the company is named Television Gaming – The Interactive Horseracing Network and is owned by Gemstar TV Guide International and listed on the Nasdaq…. After a little while I noticed that half the office was kind of staring at me,  and realized that I had been surfing an online horse betting site at the office for almost half an hour… yeah, that’s being Jesus to the unsaved….

       " I thought it would be nice, going to see his new place. And it was. But as we were timing how long it took for him to drive from his new gym to his new apartment, I started crying again. We got to his apartment, and I saw someone inside who I didn't know—one of his new roommates. It hit me then, that he was going to leave me for two strangers he'd met through a newspaper ad."

        ‘I’ve re-read the book of Luke, and as far as I can tell even Jesus wasn’t awake at 4am on Easter’   This is a joke I told at least 15 times on Sunday, and no one ever laughed.  Perhaps its because the bitterness behind the remark was only thinly veiled.  A sunrise service was a good idea in theory, but at the new ballpark in Frisco?  ( and I think I shuddered every time pastor referred to it as the  Dr. Pepper/7Up Stadium  from the pulpit ) And in Plano?  Who’s going to showup?  If they do is it going to be anything reverent or just a garish display?  And now I’d have to wear blacks on Easter, when everyone else at church would be in 2,000 dollar suits and sundresses.   However as hard work started to wear away at the cold sting of an early Texas morning, as the stadium began to fill, as I began to bond with the crew in a way that only a crew can bond, all that started to wash away.  By the time that Newsong sang ‘Arise my Love’ with sun peeking over the left field wall I realized I was experiencing something very special.  In the end it ended feeling like a benchmark experience, like I was disappointed to leave church and have to rejoin the workaday world.    Thank you, to everyone on my crew who helped make this happen. Thank you to the 8000 of you joined me at the ballpark that morning, not to see a show, but because seeing what God can do was more important than sleep or warmth. And thank you to the pastors and leaders at my church who had vision where I did not.       Links   A  urlLink much more intelligent essay than mine  on the big day. This ones from the roomie.

        The Weekly Endorsement    The Movie  – Holes – ‘You take a bad boy, make him dig holes all day long in the hot sun, it makes him a good boy. That's our philosophy here at Camp Green Lake’… I think my dad worked for Camp Greenlake.   The Video  – Igby Goes Down – been raving about this movie since it came out and now it’s on video.  Succeeds where pretty much everyone else since 1945 has failed, ripping off J.D. Salinger without feeling like it’s ripping off JD Salinger. Drumline – Once again proving that I am a band geek, I just never joined the band.    Another Reason American Idol Sucks  – it caused 3000 people to go to the parking lot of the Burleson WalMart last week for a Kelly Clarkson concert.  Anything that causes a trip to WalMart is morally wrong.   The Single  – R.Kelly – Ignition – it feels wrong to like this song so much, very very wrong. Foo Fighters – Times Like These – just listen to it, if you don’t get it I can’t help you.    Worst Network rebranding strategy ever  – TNN is renaming itself Spike TV. Really the name seems fitting for the network that gives us wrestling, Baywatch reruns, Horsepower TV and American Gladiator. Watch for it to hit a new low this spring when it launches (I kid you not) a Pamela Anderson cartoon called Striperella… TNN also gets bonus points for winning this category twice, last time for calling themselves The National Network.  Apparently they thought the nation had nothing better to do than watch 12 hour Star Trek:TNG marathons.

       The great advantage to never actually catching any fish on a fishing trip is that then you don’t have any fish to clean, any fish to smell up your car on the way home, or any fish to try and cook the next day (the other great benefit as far as the fish are concerned is that none of them die).  This was the great result of Barry and James’ fishing expedition last night, eight people, half a pound of chicken liver, a dozen minnows, thirty dollars worth of fishing licenses and no fish to show for it, but like I said that was never the point.  I fish the way that I golf, the way most of my friends hunt.  It’s merely an excuse to get out of the city for a few hours, get on the water and just listen to the quiet, to spend time with friends (you ever notice that the one thing that we really need to develop relationships, time, is the one thing we never seem to give them? We’re so busy doing things that we never get to know each other?  Lewis would argue that the nature of friendship is shared activities, eyes pointed forward and all that, but here I must digress slightly from the master) and seeing what conversations develop…

I had forgotten how easy it is to drive into downtown at noon, or how short a day can be when you don’t take a lunch break… I’ll blow part of my holiday today looking at dent and scratch washers down at the Sears appliance outlet,  but its still going to be a great weekend…

       This has been an amazingly busy week, I finally got caught up at work, which is good, but this happened the same week that I started Principles of Management, and as I forgot to order my books until the day class started, I had to spend the later part of the week just catching up ( I thought you weren't suppossed to have homework the first week, what happened to that ?)... still need to file my taxes (I know, don't say it), still need to get my car inspected (expired in March), still need to finish getting estimates on getting my washing machine fixed, and yet I found plenty of time this week for the things which really make life worthwhile, ran my first 5k on tuesday, found time for dinner with my roommate and time to just hangout, play video games, and reconnect with one of my former roomies... and today is strangely calm, the retreat I was scheduled to go on was cancelled and all my normal Saturday activitities (Exile, my Spritual Leadership book group) were cancelled to make room for the retreat, leaving me a beautiful Texas Saturday completely to myself... sure I've spent most of it at the Library reading about the organization of small business and Management techniques throughout history, but its still all good...

        Why I watch Sports….   The company my dad worked for when I was growing up was owned by three Syracuse University grads, didn’t mean much, but about once a year they would score football tickets for everyone in the company. The memories of those games are among the most precious I have. I don’t remember a lot about the games themselves, I remember one of them was on opening day against Temple but I don’t remember who won.  I do remember trying not to fall asleep in the third quarter.  But what I really remember was walking from the parking garage to the Carrier Dome, being impressed by my father’s command of the city, listening to bawdy jokes as we tailgated with his boss,  the SU sweatshirt he would buy me , and just being awed at this induction into the world of men.    Baseball to me is reading box scores in the front seat of my Grandfather’s pickup with a thermos of McDonald’s coffee between us, I still take my coffee with cream no sugar, and I still remember his stories of Ted Williams and his eternal hope that the Mets would win the pennant this year. Baseball to me is being Doc Gooden and Don Mattingly in Joel and Justin’s backyard.  Its 1996 the year we finally knew what it meant when our fathers said that the Yanks were due.   It’s watching the series over chili at my best friend’s house on his birthday, a tradition that has turned into an annual phone call, but is holy none the less.   Tonight I will watch the Syracuse Orangemen vie for the national championship; I watched them try this in 1996 and in 1987, and suddenly I feel nine years old again, like I’m watching this with my dad.  In the end I watch sports because that’s what men do.

        The Weekly Endorsement…    The Single  – Simple Plan – Grow Up – Far better than any song from the Scooby Doo Soundtrack deserves to be, but then again the Scooby Doo Movie was far better than any movie named the Scooby Doo Movie deserved to be.   The Other Single  – Eminem – Sing for the Moment – Like Lose Yourself part 2, its that good.   The Movie  – The only thing I saw this weekend was Just Married. I’m not sure if it was good or if it’s just my burgeoning crush on Brittany Murphy, but I enjoyed it.  Still I have a bit of a problem endorsing a movie that everyone else in the Western World has already seen, so officially lets pretend I saw the new Vin Diesel movie and really liked it…   The Tube  – Rudy, the Rudy Giuliani Story – “You’re too small to be Mayor of New York, Rudy!” Oh wait, that was a different movie…   The Worst Country Song Ever Written  – Daryl Worley – Have You Forgotten? – I’m all for kicking Saddam’s butt, but this thing makes Alan Jackson look subtle and nuanced…   Literature  – Jarhead – Anthony Swofford – Let’s face it, I could have released a book about the gulf war right now and watched it skyrocket to the top of the New York times bestseller list.  But the timing of this novel makes it feel relevant, not cynical.  Doesn’t hurt that the writing stands up with Caputo and Remarque.     Most Disappointing New Show  – The Oliver Beene Show – Good thing that Fox cancelled the Andy Richter Show, Greg the Bunny and Undeclared to make room for this classic(insert sarcasm here)… Hailed as the heir apparent to Malcolm in the Middle, it plays like That Sixties Show.  I am sitting through it again tonight, and again tonight I will have mercy on myself and change the channel halfway through… Credit it and this evening’s  debut of The Pitts with ruining Fox’s Sunday night lineup.

        Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends?    "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create).  It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that gives value to survival." - C.S. Lewis,   The Four Loves    I was talking with a friend at work today and she shot out perhaps the strangest theory of friendship I've ever heard, and she was convinced it was true.  She said that our close friends are all people who look like us.  I accept that we bond most closely with people who  are  like use, people we share common interests or a common background or common goals with, but this is not what she was talking about.  I also have to accept that while I consider myself a rather progressive person and have friends off all ages, races, religions, and even sexual orientations, my best, closest friends are all heterosexual white Christians like myself.  But this is not because I want to be around people who look like me but because I'm drawn to those I can relate to, who know where I'm coming from, and those who come from the same culture as I do are more likely to understand me.  That is also not what she was talking about.  Her example was height.  She had accepted as fact that tall people hang around with other tall people and that short people are closest with other short people.  That our closest friends are more likely to be people who physically resemble us.  I have no idea if  her theory holds any water at all, but I must say I'm intruiged. Being, I believe, a rather average looking fellow its kind of hard for me to test it out, so if you're 6'5" I really want to know your thoughts on this....

         One of those days I'm glad I didn't wear heels to work...   I had a business lunch at the top of Reunion tower yesterday.  It was pretty good, time considering that it was a business lunch. Like most tower restaurants, it rotates so that you can different parts of the city as you eat, the problem is that the tower is on the western edge of downtown, so for fully half of your meal all you can see is I-30, the courthouse, some bail bondsman’s shops, and a bunch of liquor stores.  Even when the view improves, you're still left with the feeling that you are watching the Dallas skyline from the most interesting part of the Dallas skyline… anyway the food was good, the view was great, and the company not too bad, until some jackass remembered it was April Fool’s day and pulled the fire alarm.  This is annoying in any situation, but I feel the need to remind you that we were fifty stories up, and when a fire alarm goes off they don’t let you take the elevator down… So me, my boss, and our out of town client got to huff it down fifty flights of stairs…  hey at least we weren’t walking up the stairs….

        One Day    Day Two    "We cry out and we confess that you are God all by Yourself"     As I look at the campsites surrounding ours I realize that JP and I made out pretty well last night, we slept okay and our things stayed dry.  The kids from Berean Baptist have a twenty person tent that is flattened, most of our group retreated to their cars, others slept in standing water.  Three guys from our group are going home, everything they brought is soaked and Blaire looks seriously ill, Judd says he slept for a total of 45 minutes, I can’t blame them.  The sun breaks out, by the entire area is a mess, most of us give up on shoes and walk barefoot in the mud, except for Stacy, who for some reason is just wearing socks… we check out the  urlLink missions tent , which is just like every missions tent I’ve ever been in regardless of the amount of work they’ve put in to making it distinctive.  I don’t stay long, I don’t sign up for anything or really talk to anyone, but still its enough to bring back lingering doubts.  Am I called to ‘bloom where I’m planted’ or to something more?  Can I truly give God everything, trust Him with my entire life while working at a secular job?  Do I have no call to ministry or do I just have no faith.  There will not be answers to these questions today…  Inside the tent I run into a girl from Cedarville and strike up a brief conversation.  As I walk away I wish I had spoken to her longer, asked her name, her major… I realize that I’m extremely attracted to this girl and wouldn’t be if she wasn’t wearing a lime green ‘Dixon’s Last Stand – SGA 03’ t-shirt… I’m attracted to a memory, to the memory of the best two years of my life.  I think about the instant brotherhood I felt with her and wonder if I’ll ever feel that way about another group…  Our group gathers again outside the tents and walks past the main field.  Chuck asks if we want to pray.  I realize that this is the kind of spiritual leader that I want to be. Someone who hears God’s voice and isn’t afraid to speak… I realize how uncomfortable I would have been even a year ago at the idea of group prayer with people I hardly know.  I guess it’s a mark of growth that this is a lifeline for me now… We pray to the God of thunder and lightning of wind and rain… I thank the Lord for showing me that Christian Community can exist outside of college…

        Friday Five   The rest of adventure in Sherman Texas is coming, but I'm going to break up the series a bit with Last Weeks Friday Five...  1. What brand of toothpaste do you use?  Here it is, proof I’m still a poor cheap college student at heart, I buy whatever brand of toothpaste is on sale at target.  If you look around you can usually find two tubes of something for like $1.48 on clearance.  I like to buy Crest of Colgate and prefer paste to gel, but I aint picky.  I think I just popped open a tube of Colgate Total with Whitening Power that I picked up a few months ago when it was on sale…   2. What brand of toilet paper do you prefer?  Sweet Mother McCree! Who even knows what kind of toilet paper they buy?  I get double ply, but beyond that I just buy one of those big 48 roll packs and leave it under the sink; it’ll last like 6 months… I have far too much to be concerned about to care what kind of toilet paper I’m using.  3. What brand(s) of shoes do you wear?  For dress shoes Kev keeps trying to convince me to move up in the world and buy a few good pairs of 100 dollar dress shoes, but right now I’m buying 30 dollars Mossimos at Target.  The brown dress shoes I own are Canyon River Blues that I found at some ghetto Sears Kev and I went to the first month I was down here… had no money but they were on sale for 12 bucks so I went for it, they’ve lasted two years which isn’t bad… for sneakers I like to buy something that makes me feel like a runner, I have a pair of Aasics and a pair of    4. What brand of soda do you drink?  I’m pretty much a diet coke man, Doesn’t taste great, but its just one calorie… beyond that I like D.P. , Mountain Dew Code Red, and Barqs.  5. What brand of gum do you chew?  If I’m chewing a piece of gum I probably scammed it from someone, so whatever they had.  I try to stay away from gum though as I make a very annoying smacking sound when I chew it… its almost as annoying to people as me with a clicky pen….

        One Day   Day One  It’s when I see a rusting abandoned box car that I realize I’m back in the country… Sherman is a small town like every small town… Texaco station, city hall, two dairy queens, I’m struck by how long its been since I’ve driven through a town this size.  A town with a sense of life and history, a town where things move slower and people stay longer… One Day is outside Sherman, down a series of two lane dirt roads and through a number of fields, they told us to expect a four hour registration time, it takes about 30 minutes and we never have to leave the car, these guys really now what they’re doing, there is even a CD to ‘acclimate’ us to the weekend, and if the care I was in had a CD player we would have listened to it…   The campsites are already starting to sprout up, where we don’t see tents there are thousands and thousands of pink flags marking campgrounds as far as we can see.  Camp goes up quickly, I meet Alex and Chuck who both seem to be phenomenal guys, (like I said before, this is Prestonwood, of the 16 people on the trip I have met less than half and only really know three) and both have a lot of outdoor experience, the tents are up, the food is away and chuck is grilling before I know whats happened.  Meet the neighbors, some kids for Borean Baptist in Houston are next to us and the Matt, Nicole, and everybody from Collin Creek are two sites down.    And then it starts to rain.  We get four inches of rain that night and winds reach 40 miles an hour, three people are taken to the hospital because of lightning strikes (no one I knew).  I remember waking up at one point and seeing our tent nearly bent in half by the force of the storm, looking over at JP and both of us just staring up hoping the tent would hold.  We stay relatively dry, our sleeping bags soak up a lot of the water and I bail out the puddles four or five times during the night. That and changing my clothes midway through the night keeps me relatively comfortable.  I remember hearing kids yelling and running around in the storm at different times during the night and realizing how old I was.  Part of me still said ‘Yeah, tackle football in the mud!’ but a much larger part said ‘Wait a minute, I’m an adult now, I have a Visa card, why the heck don’t I just get a room at the Holiday Inn?’  I fear this will be my last time doing something like this, I’m just getting too old for this crap.  I wake up for the last time around 5am.  The rain has turned to drizzle but show no signs of stopping, I’m cold wet and tired.  If the weather breaks and things dry out we’ll be okay, but I don’t know realistically if we can do another night of this.   I walk to the showers (courtesy of the convention, I love you North American Mission Board!), there is no line at 5am in the rain.  I am selfish with the hot water and spend as much time as I can in the emergency relief shower trailer, there is a very good chance that this is the only time I’ll be warm or dry all day, and certainly it’s the only privacy I’ll have…. I am ready to go home…

       Back from Sherman, physically exhausted and emotionally drained, I'll write more about the trip later, it was amazing, but right now I want to sit here and enjoy being clean... watching a pretty sweet Willie Nelson special on the USA Network, can't believe he's seventy, can't believe I'm two months from 25... starting to ramble, too tired to do this right now...more later..

       Memorial Day Weekend... I'm heading out to One Day with a group from church for the weekend, like so often at Prestonwood I signed up for the event hoping to spend some time with good friends and deepen some relationships and then ended up with an eclectic group of people I don't really know.  Sometimes this works out well and sometimes not, last year I hadn't met a single person who went on the Memorial day trip, ended up meeting James and getting to know Mark Davis though, so it ended up okay... this year I don't know what to expect, One Day is billed as a weekend of getting real with God of getting on your kness with your brothers in Christ and getting some work done... so wasn't Promise Keepers  DC, so wasn't every other Christian event, they  usually end up with four minutes of prayer and then somebody talking for 15 minutes and three more minutes of prayer, not really a chance to get on your face before God, and sometimes they end up being concert festivals where 14 year old girls swoon over DC Talk the same way they swoon over Justin Timberlake, and spiky haired boys with  skateboards pretend that Christian Punk isn't an oxymoron, and weird 24 year old guys who can't get a date tell you how great the new Argyle Park album is and trade old colored Prayer Chain vinyl (someday I'll go into my  thoughts on the Christian music scene and offend everyone,  but I need to cut this short)... I have a Bible, I can get up early and pray and meet God and not really care what anyone else is doing, and although a very large part of me wants to blow this off and go to Galveston with Kev, I think it will be good... I will not have my computer so don't try emailing me, my phone will probably die by Sunday and I have no idea if there will be a charger, so I'll probably be cut off this weekend... I'll let you know how it was on Tuesday...

        Friday Five   I’m breaking down and doing a Friday Five, but just to be rebellious I’m doing last week’s Friday Five.  1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?   Straight from the tap is cheap, which I like, but on pure flavor I’ll go bottled, usually Aquafina.  2. What is your favorite flavor of chips?    I remember back in high school whenever the youth group got together everybody brought a snack.  I brought Salt and Vinegar chips once and nobody even opened the bag.  That one bag of chips trucked back and forth with me to youth group all summer… I wonder whatever happened to them?  3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?   Well this will be a short list… I’m pretty handy at making Hamburger Helper Cheesy Hashbrowns, but I’m not sure if those count, last time I warmed up a DiGiorno I almost set the apartment on fire ( just FYI, there’s a piece of cardboard on the bottom your supposed to remove)… I can make a pretty mean chicken and rice with barbecue sauce, I avoid it now cause of all the carbs in the rice, but it tastes great…  4. How do you have your eggs?   If I’m at a restaurant scrambled, If I’m at Mom’s house poached on toast, If I’m cooking myself overeasy cause it takes the least number of dishes.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?   Who cooked  me  a meal? Unless that guy at Saltgrass counts I’d have to say my Mom back at Christmas.  It was, as my Mother’s food always is, marvelous.

       Why is it that we spend all day at a soul numbing, life crushing job to make money to buy things that we don’t need that only serve to drive us further and further from God?  There has to be a better way to live life.  A way that is not so rooted in the temporary, a way not so connected to the world.

       I feel much better now.  I really do, its amazing how a good nights sleep,  a warm shower, and a few hours can give a situation some perspective.  I know that God will never put me in a situation without giving me the tools to handle that situation.  He is not a god who abandons his children.  and frankly the tools needed here are relatively simple,  a mechanic you trust, a rental car place that will pick you up, a credit card...

       I was supposed to write about how a man my age should limit the number of high school graduations he attends, I was supposed to write about waiting for an hour and a half to watch the new matrix only to have the theater idiots load the film backwards, I was not supposed to sit here tonight and write about the way it feels to have a wheel bounce over the median and into the front of your car.  The way it feels to think oh Jesus, that’s a wheel heading for my windshield and not being able to do anything, often in accidents I think back about how I should have reacted quicker or if only I’d cut into the right lane.  But there was no space in the right lane, traffic was going about ten miles an hour and there was no where to go.  Often in accidents I can see cause and effect.  There has never been one so random, I never even found a vehichle missing it wheel.  The tire flew through the air, bounced of my car and disappered I don't know where it came from or where it went. I am not supposed to write about trying to go home and having the city just not let you.  To sit in a traffic jam for an hour, and finally see that there is no wreck, no accident, just too many people.   I am not supposed to write about realizing that four inches to either side and the wheel would have crumpled more than the frame of my door, about touching the rubber marks on my car and thinking about my head seated only six inches away.  But I am supposed to, aren’t I.  Things happen for a reason, God did not set the world spinning and then say good luck, I am not buffeted about on the sea of random chance.  As cold and hard as this city is I have someone who controls it and protects me from it. Normally this knowledge gives me strength and hope, and without it I would not make it through my day, now it leaves me angry and confused.  I know God does not owe me an answer and yet I sit here and demand one.  Are you trying to teach me to rely on you, about the shortness of life?  But these are perhaps the only lessons I know….  My friends say that God did not throw a wheel at my car that he allows all things to happen, but does not cause all things to happen.  I am sorry if I remain unable to adopt “Sh_t Happens’ as a worldview. If I tell my Mom she will say that angels steered the tire to hit my car where it would do least damage and that I should thank the Lord for protecting me…. I, however, do not serve a God who is surprised by wheels flying through the air, nor a God who can move a wheel two inches but cannot cause it to miss my car entirely…  This post has become long, negative, and it contains swearing, all good reasons to end it now ( I wonder how long  A Grief Observed would be if Lewis had Word instead of leftover composition books) …   I search for a lesson, for some meaning, for life not to be random, but maybe there isn’t and maybe it sort of is.  I hope there is something God will do with this, I don’t know what, but trust that the One who sees the bigger plan does, again I say it is Your life Lord, whatever it takes, whatever you have to do.  My life is Yours.

       Nothing I have ever put on the site has garnered quite the viewer response that the ‘aint no food in the kitchen’ post did.  Whether people enjoyed a simple insight into the world of the single male or whether they were shocked at the thought of me not eating, I’ll probably never know, but in the spirit of the summer sequel, I’m cashing in with  What’s in the Fridge 2: this time its personal .  Cleaning the fridge out last week forced Kev and I to ask many deep questions, why do two men have five jars of mayonnaise? Whose applesauce is this? Why do we have a bottle of Guldens spicy mustard from April of 2001?  Why are there ice cube trays in the vegetable crisper? (Strangely the question ‘Weve owned this fridge for 18 months, why did we never look in the vegetable crisper before?’ never came up) …  So what’s left in the fridge? A) the carton of freeze dried mashed potatoes, they moved to Dallas before I did and even though neither Kevin nor I has ever eaten any, I’ll miss them if they ever go away (and no, they haven’t gone bad, they’re freeze dried, they’ll never go bad), b) a whole crap load of soda that Kevin bought cause his relatives were coming down and that his relatives never drank, c) half a gallon of milk, d) Kev’s leftovers from Cheesecake factory, e) half a thing of Velveeta, f) condiments….

        I remember how I used to sit on this bench every noon and stare across the playground at that little red haired girl... All I wanted was to be able to sit next to her and talk to her... just be with her.  That wasn't asking too much, was it?  But it never happened... And then she moved away.  And now I don't even know where she lives, and she doesn't even know I exist.  And I sit here every day, and I wonder what she's doing....   Charlie Brown  I am nearly 25 years old.  I have read DH Lawrence, Charles Bukowski, CS Lewis, and the Incredible Lightness of Being, and yet today, as so often in the past, a round headed eight year old boy speaks for me...

        Fuelin up on cocaine and whiskey,  Wish I had a good girl to miss me….    Kid Rock  At this point I am operating solely on caffeine, sugar, and Whatabuger.  I’m pretty sure I haven’t left the office before 8 oclock more than once so far this week.  I’ve looked at flowcharts until my eyes were ready to bleed; I actually had a Visio inspired nightmare last night.  I keep telling myself that all I need is one good nights sleep, one good solid night and maybe a day off and I’ll be back in the game, but it won’t be tonight… If you know me at all then you know that a big part of me enjoys this, enjoys working late nights and early mornings and tough projects.  That I thrive on praise from my bosses, that far too much of my personal worth is determined by how well I’m doing at work and on how others see me… all this is true, but honestly I just want about ten hours of sleep right now…

       I can't believe its been more than a week since I posted anything real on here.  Its not that nothing has happened, more like too much has happened and I sit down to put it to words and I can't,  or I could but it  would take too long and I go to sleep instead... So I'll start with Saturday and try to get back in the saddle.  This was the first Saturday since my book study ended.  I signed up to study J Oswad Sander's Spiritual Leadership Saturday afternoons thinking that if I couldn't give God my saturdays for eight weeks than I'd never really give Him anything. So I picked the book that sounded the least like me and jumped in.  Still I felt like I was doing God this huge favor, giving Him a huge chunk of my time and hoping He understood what a sacrifice it was.  What absolute crap.  I enjoyed the freedom of my Saturday, enjoyed not having my afternoon dictated to me, enjoyed being able to kill most of the day at the movies, being able to go to a small barbecue with some old friends from work, but looking back I see how very little I gave to God, a few hours, a few less movies seen, a few less crap television shows watched...  I just hope I have the strenght to give it to Him again if the oppurtunity arrives....

       Been a truly weird week… having trouble sleeping and I don’t know why, probably just a mix of the latent stress from my upcoming move and the fact that I haven’t worked out in two months.  But still, I had a nightmare about missing a final last night, where did that come from?  I’ve been out of school for three years now… anyway the new house means I have a new mailing address, I’m not about to post it here but if you feel that you need to mail me things go ahead and shoot me an email and I’ll let you know…   Anyway onto the  urlLink Friday Five …   1.	How are you planning to spend the summer?   Okay, proof positive that the fivers are all basically still college kids.  The worst thing about joining the working world is the monotony.  In school your classes, and thus your life, change every fifteen weeks, ten if you go to the ‘ville. Work, by contrast, just keeps going.  You lose your predefined breaks at the end of semesters and at the end of the summer. Everyday you get up and go to the same job and do basically the exact same thing.  What do you get in return?  Two weeks of vacation and a regular paycheck.  The ability to buy groceries without worrying about the price of chicken and the chance to buy someplace besides the SA.  Long way to say the summer doesn’t make much difference anymore, I’ll be working this summer.  There are highlights marked out, fireworks on the parking garage roof at work, Summer Night of Worship, plans for a weekend road trip to Mexico, a week with my folks at the end of July, my sister Carrie starting school in Tulsa, but basically I’ll work and when the summer is over I won’t even notice…  2. What was your first summer job?   Worked on my best friends dads farm. I was fourteen years old working 60 hours a week for $3.50 an hour. Stacking hay until I almost passed out, coming home too exhausted to do anything but eat dinner and go to bed.  I felt like a king.  3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?   I hate to say back home, but that’s the truth.  There is one other place I’d like to go, but that’s more about wanting someone to ask me back into their life rather than wanting to go on a trip.  Besides that my short list includes the Rocky Mountains, the Grand Canyon, and the Great Wall of China….  4. What was your worst vacation ever?    Even the bad ones have been great in their own ways. I remember a trip to the Jersey coast with my friend Josh where we kept having to pull over and patch his car up just to keep it going.  I was stressed as heck on the trip, but look back on it fondly now.  It wasn’t really a vacation, but I do remember having my girlfriend come and visit me in college, we had no car, there is pretty much no place on Cedarville campus that you can hang out with someone of the opposite sex, and it rained the entire weekend.  That was truly awful.   5. What was your best vacation ever?    I don’t know if it would classify as a vacation, but I had a three-week business trip to Norfolk last summer that was one of the greatest times of my life.  Just starting a great new job, just starting an amazing relationship, rental car and all expenses paid.  Living in a hotel during the week and working with people who treated my like royalty, driving to West Virginia or Ohio on the weekend… great trip…

       My bank account is about as low as my self-esteem these days, which all factored in to me stopping by Goodwill today.  New clothes always make me feel like a better person, better looking, I know its a crutch, but it works... I bought my first real tie at Ohio's largest Salvation Army,  a silver deal with a sublte diamond pattern.  It stood me well for a number of years and along with a fireman's dress uniform jacket bought at the same Salvation Army, got me through most of the formal events I needed to attend during college.  Since then I have always checked the tie rack when i go to a Goodwill or SA. Clothes end up at the thrift  store for a reason and as you cannot outgrow a tie,   99% of the time all you find are terrible paslies, stained polyester rejects from Sears, and ultra thin ties from the 80s... Today was different, the first tie I saw was a beautiful pattern of blues and blacks, it was an Ermenegildo Zegna.  And the more I looked the more ties I found, Hilfiger, Culway and Sons, Joseph A. Banks, Polo, Bill Blass. Jones New York, Kenneth Cole.   I bought twenty-one ties at Goodwill today.  I don't know they all ended up there, but whether I was the beneifciary of death or of an angry lover, I don't know and I don't care.  I doubled my tie collection for thirty bucks today...

        One Day 03   Day Three  Kevin and I had a discussion last night about the song ‘Above All’ by Michael W. Smith.  Kevin said the line ‘he took the fall, and thought of me, above all’ had always given him pause, that he had deep seeded theological problems with making humanity the number one thing in Christ’s mind when He was on the cross.  It reminded of John Piper at One Day ’03.  Piper said that the greatest disservice that his generation did to ours was putting humanity at the center of the Salvation message.  It reminded me of Louie Giglio saying that God does not value us most, He values Himself most and to say anything else is to make God an Idolater.  It reminded me that I never wrote down exactly what happened on the final day of One Day ’03, and I need to write it now, not because anyone else really cares, but because if I don’t write it down I risk forgetting ….  But I have forgotten a lot of it, I remember the feeling of being completely open before God, completely honest and completely accepted.  I remember amazing messages from John Piper and Louie Giglio but exactly who said what is lost somewhere in my mud stained notes. I remember the emphasis on God and His glory, that we should ache for the lost not because they were going to hell, or because people were living empty meaningless lives, but because God was not being glorified through their lives.  I remember the intensity of the prayer and of the worship and I remember realizing again that God is not a simple being and not easily housed in our clichés, bumperstickers, and three point alliterative messages.  But it was hot.  In Texas the heat can be a palpable thing.  A force and personality all its own. And although it was May my body betrayed after three or four hours in the sun.  I was having trouble concentrating and needed a break, just a few minutes in the shade and some fresh water a trip to the porta-johns and I would be re-charged…  I jogged back to the field as I realized I was missing the next sermon.  An earnest young man with a mop of brown hair was just getting started, but I soon found out that after some of the greatest preaching of my life Kirk Cameron was giving the salvation message, badly. Using metaphors I’ve heard so many times I was saying them along with him.  The just judge. Three people on an airplane… after Kirk, Joshua Harris spoke.  I have a lot of respect for this man, and have honestly read and enjoyed both of his books.  But after hearing all morning and for the last year that discipline does not breed love, but that love for God breeds discipline. And that God is too big to be put into our three point definitions.  Josh gave the kind of three points on being disciplined about not having sex message that never helped me and never really helped anyone.  When I saw that Dayna Curry was going to speak next I knew that the day was over for me….

       I know I haven't been posting here as much as I should, and I know I'm violating that golden rule about driving traffic to my site with quality content... but its been busy... last three weeks in a nutshell, we got the  urlLink house  I got the promotion, I got the apartment to myself for the next two days... I'll actually have two people reporting to me by the first week of July and I meet one of them in forty minutes... the Belo Sales Academy presentation went really well last night, although I forgot to ask what I was suppossed to present on until we set the projector up, still netted me free pizza and a chance to meet cute college girls... so win-win all in all ...

        The past is felt both to impose an obligation and to hold out an assurance; we must not fall below the standards our fathers set us, and because we are their sons there is good hope we shall not.   CS Lewis – The Four Loves  I spoke to my Dad on the phone today… its one of the worst things about being down here, the physical reality that I’m not up there…. That I’m not up there nearly as much as I should be… I can’t say how special it would have been to wake up this morning, go downstairs and have a cup of coffee with my father, catch a round of golf with him this afternoon or help him plant the tomatoes… my father is my hero, its not really supposed to work that way, your supposed to love your parents, but the older you get the more your supposed to see them as contemporaries, equals, humans.  The older I get the more mythical my old man becomes, I forget the bad things, the mistakes he made, the hard times we went through, and in my eyes he can do no wrong.  I think about the things he did when he was my age, raising two kids, married, schlubbing out some blue collar job to provide for his family.  And I wonder if I could do it, if I’ll ever be half the man he was…. Then once in awhile I’ll do something, grab someone and ask if I can pray with them, underline huge chunks in my Bible, raise my hands in worship, and I’ll remind myself of him. And those are the only times I’m truly proud of who I am…

       Adding a new site to my list of essential movie spots on the web.   urlLink Box Office Mojo  has the most complete box office reciepts I've ever seen.  It also  lists estimated movie budgets, with promotions, so you can see if a flick's in the red yet or not.   The auteur  in me is suppossed to say that movies are art and that art was never intended to make money, that often a sign of great art is that it is rejected by the mass, by the proletariat.  Yeah, sure, but box office reciepts are the best indicator of what kind of movies will be coming out next year, so they do have a role in saying what art will get made.  And also you just sound cool when you can drop 'I guess it says something about America that Daddy Day Care made 86 million in three weeks' at the water cooler.   Also check out:   urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  to see what 200 critics thought about a movie all in one place.  urlLink Aint It Cool News  for the latest movie gossip, reviews from a true fanboy, and more than a little Austin Texas flavor  urlLink Roger Ebert  still the most articulate critic on the planet.  You'll learn more about film than you will about the movie he's reviewing. I also love the Movie Answer Man and the quote "I had a colonoscopy once, and they let me watch it on TV. It was more entertaining than "The Brown Bunny." and of course  urlLink IMDB .  Start by looking up your favorite movie, see where it takes you.

       Forbes magazine has released a list of the  urlLink best cities for singles .  Dallas ranked number ten on the list so I have to assume that dating was not one of the criteria used in the study. Apparently Forbes believes that singles are most interested in lasick eye surgery and driving 80 thousand dollar BMWs.

        From a grumpy Meteorologist just trying to get along   Its been awhile since I've been around a newsroom, even longer since I've done any actual news, but sometimes I need to remind myself that I do still actually work in television, that my industry is slightly different from banking or insurance... ran across this letter in a  urlLink tvspy  newsletter that pretty well describes what life is like in a newsroom, though y'all might enjoy it…  Geoff   PS day three of OneDay is coming… I promise I will finish this out J   RE: We're all gonna Die!  David Damian ddamian@click10.com  I'm standing in front of the chroma key for the Saturday 6 P.M. Newscast. It is the first day of hurricane season and I am doing another "What to expect this year" explanation for the residents of south Florida (although neither I nor anyone really knows what's going to actually happen). I do my little schtick...and then retreat to the little windowless cubby hole called our "Storm Tracking Center." I have yet to do my full forecast, which comes up sometime in the show's third-block. At the end of the second block, our anchor reads the pre-written weather tease, "And David Damian is up next tracking trouble in the tropics!" WHAT? No, I'm not. Unless they are referring to a coup d'etat in Haiti, I am unaware of any trouble in the tropics. In fact, I just said that not 5 minutes ago when I was talking about "What to expect For the upcoming hurricane season..." and there certainly wasn't anything brewing, stewing or even on a slow-boil. Darn, now I have to promise somekind of tropical storm that I can't possibly deliver. On second thought, I'll just ignore this little bit of "mis-information" and talk about the ubiquitous afternoon thunderstorms that have been popping in the afternoon heat. Then the phone rings. "No ma'am...I know what you heard...but there is NOT a hurricane bearing down on south Florida. No...No we're not in any danger. Call me back around September 1...I'm pretty sure we'll have one by then.  Thank you...bye." This little phone conversation is repeated three or four more times in the evening because of a bad tease written by a producer who just assumed that since we are suddenly in hurricane season, there must be a hurricane out there... or at least "TROUBLE IN THE TROPICS."   My point is this: whether it is a possible nor'eastern rolling up the eastern seaboard in mid-January or a Category 4 hurricane racing through the Lesser Antilles which may or may not affect the U.S., a real problem exists when inexperienced writers assume too much and thus put the burden on the local weatherman to spend half his time explaining away poor writing, poor choice of words or just bad information. And the network feeds are more often than not full of errors. Usually, the information is terrible dated, but written in the present tense. Advice to writers: Just drop by the weather office and ask one of us just what the hell is really going on before you write your script. We are really a good source of information if you just utilize us a bit better. And there is no need to scare anyone by writing superfluous adjectives describing the next BIG THING to hit your hometown. It's scary enough all on its own. Thanks...from a grumpy Meteorologist just trying to get along.

        This ones for you Goose….   Won ten bucks at lotto last night. Me and my brother were going to the drive in and stopped in at Tops to pick up Sodas and I  remembered all the wasted afternoons in the Tops Customer Service area or down the Fingerlakes Mall playing scratchers with Andy Guzalack, Dave Rowe,  and Mike and Matt Gay.  Andy had a knack for lotto, he always won, and he could always tell you what game you should play, what was lucky for that day or for you.    I haven’t seen Andy in four years or more, we used to spend every Tuesday together after college, we made it a mission to try every sub sandwich in Auburn, to hit every deli we could find.  He was one of my best friends and I haven’t seen him in four years.   So I bought a scratcher for Andy, and when it proved to be a loser I bought another cause Andy always said that every losing ticket you bought brought you one step closer to a winner, you just had to stay in it.  Theres a life philosophy in there somewhere, I hope at some point Goose started applying it to life in general and not just gambling.  This time it paid off, and I won ten bucks.  If I could find you Andy, I’d split it with you.

        Some observations from upstate New York.   The paper is very thin.  The entire newspaper down here is about the thickness of the living section of the  urlLink Morning News .  Reading the paper, which can be a very leisurely morning activity in Dallas takes roughly ten minutes front to back here.  There are a lot of trees.  And big trees too,  not these ten foot tall saplings that were transplanted from a nursery when they built the subdivision, but 60 or 70 foot tall behemoths that have been there for 100 years.  In fact a lot of things are older, the homes, the cars, everything.    There are a lot of hills. How I could possibly have forgotten that I don’t know.  Or maybe I just never noticed.    Things move a lot slower.  Part of this is that I’m on vacation, I’m not really doing anything.  But still, there just seems to be a lot more time here.  People drive slower, walk slower, People are still talking about the new Applebees which was built five years ago.  The thing is that none of this has changed, its been this way for hundreds of years and certainly for the 25 I’ve been around to notice.  The only thing that’s changed is me.  My perception of what’s normal, what the size of a newspaper or a tree should be.   What the pace of life is.  I’m starting to notice that Texas has changed me.  It has affected me in bad ways and good ways, some of the changes will be permanent and some will change again,  but I am different now because of the experiences I’ve had over the last three years.    I’m starting to wonder how much I identify with this place as my home anymore, if I’ll ever be able to come back to this… and that worries me…

        Here In this diary I write you pictures of my summer, It was the best I ever had. There were choruses and sing-alongs  and that unspoken feeling of knowing that right now is all that matters.   The Ataris  I am heading home.  After far too long I am heading home.  After not seeing my family for seven months I am heading home.  I waited too long this time and am far more excited than I normally would be. I’ve checked the weather back home every day last week. Someone brought cinnamon rolls into the office last week and all I could think was ‘next week I’ll be eating my Momma’s cinnamon rolls.’   I feel sorry for my roommates, I’m sure that the mixture of stress and excitement and trying to get everything finished at work has made me rather difficult to get along with this week.  A week at home, reconnecting with my past and re-charging my self is exactly what I need…      OHare is part of the national imagination.  Well really its more part of the national nightmare. Most of the country seems to only associate it with those nightly news images of travelers stranded in the middle of the great Midwest like refugees huddled against a cold Libyan night.  And yeah Chicago’s first airport has been guilty of a few of those and maybe a few too many travelers have spent sleepless nights on her cold tile floor, but the airport seems to be working overtime to dispel this image and I always look forward to a layover in the windy city.    How can you not like an airport with two real bookstores, a Wolfgang Puck’s, and a Chicago Historical Society store all with in the American Airlines terminals?  How can I not be fond of the airport that introduced me to the air travelers best friend, the Great American Bagel stand?  How can I not owe something to an airport that always has a nook where you can sit alone even on the busiest day of the year?  I deplane at gate H and avoid the main concourse there.  It does hold a Hudson’s Book Corner, which at most airports would be a real find.  A real bookstore, not just three racks of paperback Michael Crichton novels and the latest in the Oprah book club.  But its still bright and crowded and features autographed copies of Traci Lords autobiography a little too prominently for my taste. It’s the kind of place that has classics but relegates them to their own section lest the regular customer run into Orwell or TS Elliot while looking for the latest Candice Bushnell novel.   Down near gate G, past the Ms. Fields and the Tie Rack is a Whitestones. A large, dark, store, with an ample collection of older books.  It feels like the staff here has actually read some of the books and I like that.  I pick up a Kerouac’s On The Road.  I have the feeling that Kerouac’s adventures will be a little more exciting than mine, that hitching from New York to San Francisco live on a friend’s couch and possibly sail around the world working in the boiler room of a steamer is a little more dangerous than flying back to spend the week with your parents,   but I too am on the road, and it feels good to be underway.

        While many people enjoy mowing their lawn, most enjoy other activities more. Activities such as spending time with the family, golfing or gardening to name a few examples. The RoboMower is no different from many other products we use everyday. A dishwasher washes our dishes, a washing machine washes our clothes and answering machines answer our phones. These are all time saving products, just like the RoboMower .  from the FriendlyRobotics homepage   Sammy G. has gotten the  urlLink Robotic Lawnmower  working.  Sam had been talking about this thing for the last three months, but until I actually saw it tooling around our backyard I have to admit that I never believed it.  I had been checking prices on walk behinds and shaking my head at Sam’s hubris. But the man pulled it off and now twice a week Roberto the little yellow mower that could is chugging back and forth across the lawn.    Sam’s only had it running for about two weeks now, but were already the ‘guys with the robot lawnmower’ to all the neighbors.  And that’s a weird thought.    Not that most single guys in their twenties would be known around the neighborhood as the wild partiers or the heavy drinkers and were know for a lawnmower  Not that something as simple as a lawnmower can cause people to overcome their natural inhibitions and walk up to a complete stranger and actually start a conversation.     But that we have neighbors, because by definition to have neighbors you need to have a neighborhood.  And that’s something that three years of apartment dwelling has taught me all too well….

I have an IQ of 136 and I’m a ‘Facts Curator’, which means I ‘m’ highly intelligent, and have picked up an impressive and unique collection of facts and figures over the years. You've got a remarkable vocabulary and exceptional math skills.

Apparently in the Internet world they consider this kind of a compliment.

A man of wisdom would have something to say about this, maybe about pride and regret, maybe about wasted time and so much time to come, maybe about how he rarely feels older than thirteen himself.   Its time like this I'm sorry that I am not a man of wisdom. My little brother turns 13 today, for me that says it all.

Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone will clean them?  Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.

       My boss sends out a memo to all of our ‘internal clients’ every Friday.  Used to send stuff out more often but people felt they were being spammed, so now he just sits down on Friday and sums up the week. Sadly that’s kind of how this site has gotten, I get busy/lazy/overworked and realize that its Friday again and I’m wrapping up the week.  This week I missed Friday and now its Monday… well life goes on…   It was a busy weekend again  urlLink YEC  Friday and most of Saturday,  urlLink Youth Homecoming Concert  on Sunday.  Well I’ll get enough of a rest when I’m back home at the end of the month…    Do you remember your first best friend?  Who was it?  David Wendell, we met in kindergarten and were best friends through second grade, then his folks moved to Dryden at a time in my life when twenty miles was a world away.     Are you still in touch with this person?   I haven’t spoken to David in years, I heard he was majoring in biology, but he has to have graduated from school  years ago   Do you have a current close friend?   I read in Men’s Health once that it takes three years to really develop a close relationship with someone, I’m thankful that my life down here hasn’t followed that plan.  I have so many friends that I’ve become amazingly close with that I’ve only known for a year… guys like Barry, Nathan, Sammy G, Micah.  Most of my relationships from college are on hiatus, I love these guys, they are my brothers, and when the time arrives I know we’ll pick back up right where we left off, but I haven’t talked to them in years… the exceptions are some really great relationships, Knouse,  urlLink Kev , Chris, Boggle…    How did you become friends with this person?   Well this would be easier if I’d chosen one… geography has always played a surprisingly large role (well not surprising because geography always plays into friendship, but surprising that you can just look up and someone that connects with you on so many levels is just standing there) Chris grew up three miles from my house, Kev lived across the hall of my dorm senior year.  I didn’t really become close with Knouse until he crashed on my couch for a year…

        Homeward bound Home, where my thought's escaping Home, where my music's playing Home, where my love lies waiting  Silently for me   Where is home, what is home?  These are questions I guess we ask all of our lives, certainly we ask them by the time we have our first apartments or by the time we’ve gone away to school.  What is home?  That 10 by 12 white cinderblock dorm room where we spend nine months of the year or that 10 by 8 baby blue room we’ve spent the last 22 years.  Where is home?  The state that has reached out and embraced me, that defines the opportunities of my future, or the state that made me who I am, where I lived for twenty years and my family has lived for five generations.   I ask myself these questions again, and again I decide that they all are, it’s good to be home in Dallas, it was good to be home in King Ferry. I miss my home, I need to call my mama back home, I need to buy some groceries on my way home tonight.   Its good to be home…

       The girl was cute in a Michelle Branch way, and she walked by my seat at least five times with small loads of strange things.  A guitar, a folded over Abercrombie and Fitch bag, a cowboy hat.  I wondered if she was walking by deliberately, if there was some reason that involved me that she couldn’t take it all one big load.  If there was something beyond us being fellow travelers trapped in an airport that caused her to smile each time she passed and promised myself that I would say something next time she walked by.  She never came back.  Story of my life.    I’ve been in the Rochester NY airport for five hours and my new flight doesn’t leave for another nine….

       Agrarian societies celebrate the land, and mine is no different. And whether its Tomatofest of the Strawberry Festival, or Melon Days they are all pretty much the same.  Country music and barbecue, fire department parade and seeing the neighbors.  King Ferry had its Wheat Harvest Festival today,  It was a chance for me to buy Cornell Chicken, to  see the old tractors, and laugh at the pie eating contest. It was a chance to watch little children have their faces painted and old men sit in the shade.  It was a chance to remember a time when small talk meant the rain and the frost and mama’s garden.  It was a chance to feel like a country boy again for a few hours.

       Nothing that we see everyday is beautiful.  This is the thought that overtook me the most last night on the hour and half drive to Bath.  I’ve driven down Rt. 17 hundreds of times, and I don’t know if I’ve ever seen how beautiful it is. The things we see everyday don’t even get noticed, they are just there, they’ve always been there, these trees are hundreds of years old, these hills and gorges thousands.  We see them everyday and in the end we don’t see them at all.

This is insane, especially seeing as I wasn’t even aware it was going to hit the net until  urlLink  Harry Knowles  mentioned it yesterday… He saw it at the theater in glorious 35 millimeter, but I sure as heck wasn’t shelling out 7 bucks to see Robert Duvall and the sixth sense kid in a charming coming of age comedy about that somehow involves  urlLink  lions … and I’m not enough of a nerd to pay for my seat and walk out after the previews… but I’m still enough of a nerd to search the net for the thing… that much has been proven…

       I got Christmas off.  or more specifically I got December 26th off, so I can fly back home late on Christmas Eve or early Christmas morning and spend the holiday with my family.  People don’t understand why this is such a big deal to me, but most of these people live within an hours drive of their parents.  They don’t understand the plight of the expatriate….  I live 1,521 miles from my home and that means I miss a lot.  I miss Mother’s day and Father’s day and birthdays and graduations and weddings and funerals.  I miss first dates and first jobs and driving tests. A card or a letter or a phone card or a bouquet stands in my place and we all pretend its enough, but its not.  In the end I miss the chance to be a functioning member of my family, and I just couldn’t miss Christmas again.    This will come up next year, and next year I won’t get it off, someone else on the team will. And I pray to God I’m brave enough to quit my job.   I have Christmas off this year and I'm happy...

        One bold message in the Book of Job is that you can say anything to God.  Throw at Him your grief, your anger, your doubt, your bitterness, your betrayal, your dissappointment - He can absor them all.  As often as not, spiritual giants of the Bible are shown contending with God.  The prefer to go awa limping, like Jacob, rather than to shut God out.  In this respect, the Bible prefigures a tenet of modern psychology: you can't really deny your feelings or make them disappear, so you might as well express them.  God can deal with every human response save one.  He cannot abide the response I fall back on instinctively:  an attempt to ignore Him or treat Him as though He does not exist.  That response never once occurred to Job.    - Philip Yancey - Dissapointment With God

       Ended up timing my morning workout badly and ended in a shower line behind the PCA football team.  Not bad, I wasn't late for work and there are worse places to spend a few extra minutes than a locker room... well it wasn't too bad until one of the kids called me 'sir', and not one of the JV punks, a senior.  'Sir, if you have somewhere to go you can just kick those guys out.' I almost asked him to not call me sir, cause it made me feel old, but then I remembered how pathetic that looked when I was a kid...

       I had a 25 minute conversation about a prom dress once, it was black, I think, with roses.  I’ve spent two hours shopping for Capri pants and more than that discussing the prices of flip flops at Moody Shoes… These should rank among the most boring times in my life and yet they’re not.  In each case a topic that normally  I would have no interest in was important to someone I loved, and so it became important to me….  I think that’s why the minutiae of our lives is important to God.  In the eternal scheme there are more pressing concerns than my deadline at work or how I’m going to pay the water bill this month.  But they are important to me and thus they are important to Him.  The God of All Creation should by all rights be too busy to discuss my weight problems or my concern that I won’t have time to mow the lawn this weekend, but He’s never too busy for me. He loves to spend time with me no matter what topic comes up, or even if nothing comes up… just something I’m going to try and think about next time I drag a girlfriend through the hardware department at Sears…

       I had the oppurtunity again this week to go the local opening of a really great movie.  It's called  urlLink The Station Agent , it was laugh out loud funny without really having any jokes.   It was sad without cheap sentimentality.  It explored the lives of three lonely people who just need to connect with eachother without making me fell like I was being preached at... Perhaps best of all the lead actor is a dwarf, and yet after ten minutes you forget about that and just think of him as a sad human... I had the oppurtunity to see the local premiere of a really great movie this week, it's called the Station Agent.  I've told at least 12 people about it since tuesday, now you're one of them...  I told 12 people about some movie, I didn't tell a single person about Jesus this week who didn't already know him...

       You wake up one morning thinking ‘wait a minute, Vader had a point, there was no ambassador, if it was a diplomatic mission, then where was the ambassador?’  And its just a little thing, but you realize the world isn’t quite as black and white as you thought when you were a kid… And the older you get the more grey you see, too often the grey areas overwhelm us, stun us into inaction.  You see a friend throwing their life away, but its their life and who are you to decide how they use it?  Your sister is stuck in a bad relationship, but your last dating relationship wasn’t exactly great itself, so what can you say without being a hypocrite?  And all too often that’s where it ends, we say nothing, we do nothing… the world is not as simple as I would like, in fact its not simple at all…

       I’m still not sure whether this is legitimate or a parody, but  urlLink  Objective Christian Ministries  is putting the fun back in fundamentalist dogma… and as much as I want to hope this is some kind of joke, I’ve known this type of Christian for too long, especially when I was younger.  In high school it was kids looking down on you for watching PG13 movies and who were scandalized at music ‘with a beat’... In college it was friends who felt they had to tell me my brother was on the path to hell for watching Pokemon and sermons about the evil of Harry Potter….   You could honestly spend all day on the site, but here is my favorite quote so far…    "But surely malls are just places of commerce, not deliberate attempts to lead people away from Christ," you may be thinking to yourself. Unfortunately the facts point to the malls' knowing complicity with the cause of anti-Christian Secularism. Besides the complete lack of Christian references in their so-called Christmas displays and decorations (just try and find a Cross or depiction of the Baby Jesus amongst all the Santas and snowmen and shiny balls), more subtle subconscious suggestions of Secularism's anti-Christian stance can be found by studying the names of common mall stores: •	J.C. Penny - The J.C. makes us think of Jesus Christ, thus associating our Lord with the lowest monetary value, the penny (even Judas valued Him at 30 pieces of silver!).  •	Sears - What the flesh of the damned does in Hell. It also sounds like "seers", Pagan mystics who engaged in occult premonitions.  •	Cinnabon - Sounds like "Sin Upon".  •	Orange Julius - Named for the Pagan Emperor of Rome. This company's mascot was once a devil, until they changed it to hide their true intentions.  •	Hot Topic - A recent store aimed at children that openly sells devil paraphernalia. Any guess as to why "hot" is in their name?  •	Hallmark Gold Crown Stores - Purveyors of Santamas tree ornaments depicting anthropomorphized woodland creatures (reference to Evolutionism) and Harry Potter merchandise. What notable person will have a mark and wear crowns? [Rev. 13:16, 13:1]  Clearly there are ulterior motives evident. Even the word "mall" evokes evilness being a homonym for "maul" - the violent rending of flesh - and "mal" - Latin for "bad" and root for words like "malicious" and "malevolent". These Malls of the Damned - open even on Sunday! - are no innocent business centers, but active parties in the conspiracy to promote Secularism.

For every minute that I'm stuck in traffic going 30 miles per in a 65, I deserve one minute at 95.  For every minute that I'm dead stopped I deserve two at 95 ( I know the more logical comparison is one minute at 130, but lets be honest, I drive a Mazda here)...

       Jennings is on campus again today.  Some of my co-workers turn into virtual Japanese schoolgirls at the prospect of any kind celebrity, but really I’m just ticked that security feels like they have to hassle me because we have VIPs in.  (I save my Japanese schoolgirl routine for the big stars, like Jack Black and the guys from Queer Eye).  Chances are that I won’t even see him; he used to hang out in my building when the bureau was over here, and you’d see him down on the service dock smoking like a fish.  But they moved the ABC bureau, and its collection of loud newsguys who didn’t wash after using the bathroom over to WFAA three weeks ago…

       My promotion finally came through, Yeah the one I thought I had back in June.  The one I told everyone I had received back in June.  The one that I’ve never gotten around to telling my folks I didn’t actually get.  (You ever notice that when your young you lie to your folks to protect yourself, but sometime around college or a little after you start lying to protect them… )  The actual email came from corporate communications wanting me to approve the design on my new business cards.  I looked at the box of business cards I received a year ago, just after I got back from Norfolk and largely untouched since that time.  It was still 75 % full and most of the cards I’ve ‘used’ have gone to other stacks I still have, in my cardholder on my desk, in my briefcase, in my portfolio.  Who could have told them I needed more? Then I asked Beverly if they were redesigning our business cards, then I asked the other girls in the office to see if corporate communications was just reordering cards for everyone…  Finally I’m talking to Lore, who is the last person left in the office, about it when it hits me.  This card has a new job title on it.  I was ecstatic; this really came out of the blue.  And with my bosses all out of the office for the last two months and my job duties changing so radically during that time I’ve received almost no feedback and haven’t been sure whether I’m doing well or whether they are getting ready to fire me…   I had the actual meeting with my boss today, I haven’t wanted to jinx it by talking about so I think I only mentioned it to my girlfriend, but now its official, I am an Advertising Services Specialist.  And no, I still don’t know what that means

       I read Philip Yancey’s The Jesus I Never Knew six years ago and it changed my life.  The book itself, of course, but also the process of reading it.  It was one of my first stabs at making a real adult try at the Christian life.  Going into a bookstore and dropping 16 dollars not on a pizza or a CD but a Christian book.  If you’re in college with no money that’s a powerful statement.  Spending my weeknights not watching television but curled up on the top bunk really trying to find out who this Jesus was and how he would live if he had my life.    Every December since I’ve read through the book of John, again trying to see Jesus not as a concept but how he really was, trying to put aside years of church and bible stories and sermons and see what the Bible really has to say about him.  It has been one of the best things I do every year and become something that really helps define Christmas for me.    This year I’ve been challenged to read through Matthew instead.  To see Jesus not only as the personal savior but also as the fiery reformer and social activist.  To see the ‘Jesus who would vote for Howard Dean’ … For years I’ve rejected the social gospel and said with all certainty that Jesus did not come to build hospitals but to save men, not to make people feel better on earth but to make them his children for eternity.  I doubt my trip through Matthew will change any of that, but I must admit I’m intrigued.  I’ll let you know how it turns out…

        Dana, I've been through alcohol, marriage, and network television. If you want to kill me, you're gonna need kryptonite  Sam Donavon - Sportsnight  I was thinking about my sites slogan 'pop, life, etc.' and how even though I  love it, it really doesn't fit anymore.  Half my posts used to be about pop culture, I used to write about movies, music, books, that all pretty much stopped when I moved to the house and didn't have money to  go to movies opening weekend anymore or to by new CDs.  I mean I saw Intolerable Cruelty last night and it was excellent, but I really feel like a wanker raving it up, in that its in the dollar theater now.  I should be telling you how I feel about Somethings Got to Give, don't hold onto your hats though, I won't see that  for another five months... Also when I launched the site I intended to start every post with a qoute from pop culture to help prove my theory that every emotion, feeling, and insight we can possibly have has been written about by someone else.  I still believe this, I mean I could tell you about love, but if you really want to know what I believe I'll just hand you Swingers, Hi-Fidelity, and Nevermind Nirvana... okay only one chapter of Nevermind Nirvana, but you get the point... so  while I still believe  that eveything I say here has been said before, and much better, tracking those things down and refrencing them correctly, well  'the whole thing just reeked of effort .'

        This will sound odd coming from me, but I am just being honest.  Do not buy me expensive things, as I am, by nature, ungrateful and will likely return what you’ve purchased in exchange for cash, which I will then lose gambling and/or whoring.  And do no buy me something expensive thinking I will then feel it necessary to purchase you something of equal worth.  I am more inclined to think, “Sucker.” But if you must, I do need an iPod.       from Full Frontal's Guide to Gift Giving by Robert Wilonsky, Dallas Observer 12/11 - 12/17

       I think time is running out to do something bizarre. Somewhere around 25, 'bizarre' becomes 'immature’ - Singles  Today is my three year anniversary with Belo… it’s a big one, my 401k match vests today, so if I leave I take it all with me… but even without those corporate vagaries this would feel big, I’m only 25, I feel older than that most of the time, or maybe most of the time being 25 feels old… I guess it always will when you compare it to 15… but objectively, honestly, 25 is young and frankly there’s almost nothing I’ve done for three years, I’ve never been in a relationship that long, never lived anywhere but my parents house for that long, never went to the same school for that long… three years, three years of my life and a cubicle and a flat screen monitor to show for it…  I’m entering a two-year window of time now when it feels like something will need to happen if it is ever going to happen. In two years I will get my third week of vacation.  Then, I’m sorry, but it will become much more difficult to leave and much easier for the rest of my life to be spent sitting in a rolling office chair for this company….

       I have a decent sized man crush on  urlLink HughHewitt  right now… heard him speak a few nights ago at the elevate conference, and although I was immediately repulsed to hear another man shout partisan politics from a church pulpit (it may have been a conference, and it may have been covered in aluminum, but it was still a pulpit), he finally won me over with his frank and intelligent message.  I had almost given up on finding a voice from the right that I could respect, but I’ve been reading Hewitt’s site daily and I’m halfway through his  urlLink book  and I am only becoming more impressed.  He notes when the republicans are wrong, he is upfront about the failings of the moral majority and religious right, I have yet to see him create a straw man or misrepresent the other side.  His arguments are intelligent and well developed…   I have been railing against these traits in the right for the last several months, bristling every time my pastor mentioned Bush and his war from the pulpit, leaving the room every time Hannity ranted about the ‘Liberal Media’… but when I tried to be a democrat I found that they had all the same faults, I just hadn’t been exposed to them yet.  I may not have liked Bush using taxpayer money to land on an aircraft carrier, but these idiots were comparing him to Hitler and complaining four years later that he had stolen the election.  Really all that my brief dalliance with liberalism, accomplished was pissing off all my friends…  I don’t know where I sit in my political journey, probably straight back at ‘cynic’ where I’ve been for years, but I think I’ve found someone who’s opinion I respect…

       Woke up this morning to a thick carpet of fog. Thick enough to feel on my skin.   Thick enough to make me wonder if I was still asleep, whether I'd woken up at all.  I remember how wonderful fog was as a child, I felt like I was in a cloud. I’d run through the mist with my arms outstretched thinking that this must be how it feels to fly.   Now I enter the fog and think that this is going to really screw up my commute, now I have flown, and well, its really boring and long and the foods bad and you get constipated for three days after.  I guess Superman failed to mention that.    All it takes is a few years of life to turn wonder into cynicism.

       Well I’m not going to be able to get the  urlLink  jeep I’ve been obsessing over , the financials just aren’t there right now.  I actually went down and talked to the guy for an hour and a half and test-drove two of the XJs, but I couldn’t do it in the end.  And somehow it really disappointed me; I had been imagining how cool I would look getting out of a jeep cherokee for so long, and I really thought it was going to happen.  I didn’t even realize how much I had been looking forward to this until it didn’t happen.  Didn’t realize how tired I was of of being the poor guy, of having the crappy car…  I realized however that one of the things I really liked about the Jeeps was how clean they were, how the interiors shined… I haven’t really taken care of my car since the wheel hit it.  I’ve only cleaned the interior once or twice and I don’t think I’ve washed it once. So I got out the hose and the Armor All wipes and went to town, got out the Mothers Back to Black and cleaned all the trim, buffed her down with some NuFinish...  The next day I went for an oil change and the place gave me a free carwash, and a good free carwash, they cleaned the tires, vacuumed the carpets and mats, and hand buffed her. So she got two car washes in two and honestly Lady Death has never been more beautiful or deadly…

I know most of you have followed this movie as closely as I have, so I felt no need to comment on the supposed anti-Semitism in the film, its been addressed by those much wiser than me.  I felt no need to encourage you to see the film, I do not know one Christian who has not been looking forward to its release for months. I felt no need to call it the greatest Christian film of all time, it is clearly so, but beating The Omega Code and Tribulation Force is no great prize… but in the last few weeks I have heard a new cry come up from the evangelicals, from pulpits and radio shows and blogs and conferences this film has been called a turning point in America’s religious life, the greatest witnessing tool of the last 2000 years, and in fact at Elevate I heard it called God’s last attempt to turn America back into a Christian nation and it was these statements that I reacted to.  The Passion is not these things and it will not do these things.  As you walk out of the theater from this film you will be emotionally drained, thankful, perhaps even physically weak, I am sure you will be praying, maybe not out loud but this movie will likely be the beginning of a conversation with God that will not end for days.  As you’re walking out take a second to think about audiences, because that’s something that those calling The Passion the last great hope to evangelize America never did.  The film spoke to you in a powerful way because you are a Christian; you just watched your God and your friend die for your sins.  The average America isn’t a Christian and they will react much differently.  They just see a good man being brutalized by the power structure of his day, and as I said before that’s not enough to save anyone.    The film will be a powerful force to evangelize America if we make it that, but all it will do is start conversations.  If it has to have any effect at all Christians must capitalize on these conversations and turn them into witnessing opportunities, given the amount that the average Christian witnesses there is a good chance this film will have no effect at all…  I saw The Passion at Elevate 2004, that’s also where I met Kirk Cameron.  After wooing America for years as Mike Seaver, Kirk got radically saved, he even made a Christian movie a few years ago.  Left Behind was based on the New York Times bestseller; it got huge press for a unique distribution and marketing system; it was arguably the greatest Christian film ever made.  And I don’t think anyone got saved because of it.  I didn’t ask him, but I think Kirk would agree with me because since then Kirk has going out day after day and doing street witnessing and teaching others how with  urlLink The Way of the Master .  That’s how lives get changed.

         I can not possibly recommend this film higher. It is art, intensely brave cinema and astonishingly beautiful even in its brutality. I fully believe the film will become a classic. We haven't seen the likes of this one before.  Harry Knowles on the The Passion of the Christ  Don't want my earlier post to make anyone think I 'm not giving this film my highest recomendation.  I'm going to post more hopefully tonight about exactly why I said what I did.  In the meantime  urlLink Ain't It Cool News  has some new reviews of the picture. Take another look at that quote above and realize that this guy screened The Passion at a film festival called Butt-Numb-A-Thon 5, that the only other thing I read on his site today was a cast list for the new Batman film... If you are a Christian, quotes like that should encourage you more than anything that Dr. Dobon or Jerry Fallwell could ever say...

       I saw the absolute strangest toy yesterday at the grocery store.  In a bin near the checkout line, mixed in the non-descript toy cars and toy trucks was a toy scooter.  No not one of those Razor scooters that almost became popular a few years back before people realized they sucked, not a model vespa so the kids can pretend that they’re mods, one of those Rascal scooters that old people use to get around.  Yeah one of those.  A small aluminum model of an adult mobility device, one step away from a motorized wheelchair… Can you imagine the child that wants this thing, ‘Mommy, mommy, can I have one of these scooters, its just like grammas.  I can put Barbie in it and pretend that shes too old to walk on her own.’

       I've raved about conservative politico and radio host  urlLink Hugh Hewitt  here before.  I'm reading his excellent book   urlLink In, But Not Of : A Guide to Christian Ambition  and I came across a chapter on blogging. I'm going to blatantly rip it off right here because i think you'll like it and because its far easier than writing something original and I'm feeling lazy.  Also its not technically plagiarism, because I never claimed to write it, just gross violation of the man's copyright... wait a minute, lets call this a review and say that I'm just quoting a small amount for reason of review.  If my remembrances of Mass Media Law class serve me right that will keep this all nice and legal...   Start and maintain a Web Log (Blog)  by Hugh Hewitt    You may already know what a blog is – an online diary of your thoughts on whatever crosses your mind.  The dominant blog of the day – judging by the number of visitors daily – is Instapundit.com by Tennesse law professor Glenn Reynolds. There are literally thousands more.  They represent the most important communication development of the new century. Join the revolution. Start a blog.  You need a Web address and some idea of how to post.  This will be second nature for younger people, like telling a fifty-year old he needs to know how to use a fork.  But heres the key: your blog will display you to the world.  Understand what that means.  Have fun with it, but do no indulge in crudity or viciousness, as other believers will have you thrown back in their face as an example of Christina hypocrisy.  You can use cutting humor and the other weapons of argument, but be slow to do so because they are not easilty mastered and can go very wrong.  What you commit to your blog cannot be erased.  It will follow you for as long as anyone cares to follow you, and significant people are followed very long indeed, especially by those they injure, whether rightfully or not.    The advantage of blogging is that it will oblige you to live in the world of ideas and debates, and to do so at the modern pace.  At present no great blogger has emerged with a distinctly evangelical worldview.  When one does, with humor and insight attached as well, that person (or persons) will have an enormous impact on the world.  Begin by studying the key blogs that are currently available, such as  urlLink InstaPundit.Com ,  urlLink the Kaus files ,  urlLink  the Dynamist  ,  urlLink  the Volokh Conspiracy , and  urlLink  the Power Line .  After a few weeks, marry your technical ability to the form, and begin to comment on the world around you.  Because blogging is the genuine marketplace of ideas, your site will prosper if you are any good. And so will your reputation – if it deserves too.   I would add Hewitt’s own  urlLink site   to that list, but really don’t have much else to add.  He speaks mainly about political sites, but the ideas apply across the board… be careful what you say, because you never know who will read it, but get out  there and says something…

       I’m trying to figure out how to write this, I’m trying to figure out how to say this without pissing everyone off.  Well, I don’t even really care if I piss people off, but I want to find a way so that even if people are mad they’ll hear what I’m trying to say.  I’m trying to say this without throwing up everyone’s walls.  I don’t think I’ll be successful but I’m going to try anyways…   Wait; let’s step back a bit, two weeks to January 22nd.  I had the opportunity to watch Mel Gibson’s The Passion.  The film is brutal; it’s a hard R for cruel violence.  I thought my many readings of the gospel account would prepare me for the viciousness of the cross, but they didn’t.   They couldn’t prepare me for the look of joy on the soldiers faces as they beat the flesh of His back, they couldn’t prepare me for the sound of the whips, the sound of His ribcage cracking in two as they stretched Him across the cross, the sounds that I couldn’t shut out even when I turned away from the screen.  I shook, wept, and nearly threw up, it’s a visceral film and it elicits a visceral response.  Coming out the term ‘difficult piece’ came to mind more often than anything.  I’ve used that before for films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler’s List.  You may not enjoy them, but they are important, they demand to be seen.  And yet something nagged at me, something I couldn’t define, and that’s why I’ve waited to comment.  It took me the last two weeks to process what was wrong. It took seeing two other films, Mystic River and The Butterfly Effect to highlight it.  They both have brutal, visceral, beatings in them and I responded exactly the same way as I did to the Passion. I couldn’t watch, I wanted to throw up, I covered my ears. What I responded to in The Passion was not the sacrifice of a savior, but a brutality that no man should ever do to another.  And that’s what The Passion is, a good man being beaten to death and then murdered in a most brutal way…   There, I’ve done it.  I’ve pissed you all off and I’ve thrown up those walls, I called Jesus a mere man and most of you probably won’t even read this far because of it.  If you don’t know me personally let me just state here unequivocally that I believe that Jesus was no mere man, He is the Son of God and God himself, He lived a sinless life and died on that cross by choice to make atonement for my sins and my life is changed forever because of it… But I’m not reviewing the Bible or Christianity, I’m reviewing a Mel Gibson movie, and in his movie he never tells us any of that.  It may spark discussions and it my start people thinking, but the movie I watched will never convince anyone that they are a sinner, that they need to be saved, and that Christ died for their sins.  It won’t save a single person.  In the eleventh grade I watched Gandhi. A lot of us did in high school, I guess they thought it would expand our horizons, teach us about peace, make us think about life in other countries.  And it did, it was a great movie, not merely good, but great.  It swept the Oscars the year it was released and Ben Kingsley became Gandhi for millions, he became Gandhi for me.  It made me care about the plight of a people halfway around the world; it helped shape my belief on imperialism, justice, and bravery.  But I didn’t become a Hindi.  It never even crossed my mind, because to me Gandhi was just a good man, a good man abused by the powerful rulers of the day and nothing more….

Time Travel movies get me, especially ones where people are trying to change their own lives (I'm the only person in the world who thought inserting the girlfriend plotline into the Time Machine made it a better movie).  This one benefits from generally low expectations, as it features Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart... I mean, I'm the biggest Ashton Kutcher fan in the world but even I didnt' think he would pull this off, but he does... two words of warning, its dark, I mean amazingly unbelievably dark, be careful who you go with, also avoid all reviews like the plague.  This type of movie relies on surprising the viewer and even  urlLink Ebert , I normally love, manages to give away way too much in his review.

        There is nothing more boring than having someone else try to tell you about their dreams   - unknown.  Had a slew of weird dreams last night, so much so that I was actually glad when the alarm went off at 5.  I remember Bill Watterson referring to dreams as a chance to spend time with your friends even when your asleep, this was a lot more like my privacy being invaded by an outside force... The whole thing is especially weird for me because I dont' have dreams, at least not ones I can remeber.  The only time I've had them regularly was in college, and I heard this theory that REM sleep was something your brain while it moved information from short term memory to long term memory and just chalked it up to all the learning that was going on... I think I'll assume this is related to all the latent stress at work and hope it doesnt' happen again...

       It’s like Christmas when you were a kid.  That feeling of excitement in the air is palpable, it’s so real you can’t concentrate, can’t imagine doing anything normal on such a special day.  Of course I’m talking about the NCAA Men’s college basketball championship which started last week.  Of all the things that set this apart from all other sporting events, the cinderellas, the shear number of games, the chance Pat O’Brien has at gainful employment, the biggest is the timing.  Because there are so many games played in the first round, a huge number of really good games are shown during the workday.  I mean can you imagine the first round of the NFL playoffs being shown at 11am on a Thursday?  Every year I vow that next time I will just take a few days off and camp out at my house, and every year instead my plans to view the games just get more intricate.  In community college we used our back end connection into the local cable system to route ESPN to a television control room for a few days.  When I worked in master control we would just have to find where the sports department had downlinked the games and pull them on the b-side of a QC monitor.  Now that I work in an office it should be simple however, because every office in America just has the games up on a TV, right?  Not when the straight male population of your workplace is 3 people out of 45 (if you think I should include the gay guys in this tabulation, let me just say that Mark is following the Women’s Final Four very carefully).  This year Hood and I stole valuable company bandwidth to view the games on our desktops.  All in all it worked out okay,  although next year I think I’ll just schedule a whole bunch of ‘meetings’ about risk management over in the corporate tower and spend the day at a Sports bar…

       Went to the Dallas Autoshow yesterday, nothing like a day of cold hard american commercialism to perk me up.  The strange thing is that the show was full of infants, many of whom did not even appear to be of driving age.  After the third time of having my route blocked by a doublesided stroller, I got very close to nicely pointing out where the new Town and Country minivans were to Joe Suburbia.  Luckily Micah was there to act as calming influence.  Also amply showed my age by repeatedly referring to the new Mustang as a '95'.

       In baseball news, the  urlLink Rangers  won their spring training opener.  Bad news, it was against Kansas City, and oh yeah, the Royals started  Garth Brooks  in left field... and yet hope springs eternal, we are undefeated....

       WORST OSCARS EVER! last year I did a huge post Oscars wrap up, but this year I think saying that there were actually several times that I looked up and thought "I'm missing Dream Job on ESPN for this?" pretty much wraps it up....

       I'm really not scared of flying, but theres something about watching a crew of union mechanics spot weld a piece of aluminum to the planes wing that will give anyone pause.  Especially when the pilot lets you know that they had actually just fabricated that piece in the last twenty minutes.  I watch American Choppers, I know what that involves, and I don't think I want to trust my life to it.    So thats how my hour and half flight to Kansas City ended up taking four, but thank God for warm showers, flat beds, and broadband connections in hotel rooms.

       Got back from Boston Tuesday night and I'm flying out to Kansas City in about three hours.  Its these times that I feel like a true road warrior, even though this is the second time I've been on the road for the company in the last two years.  The thing about working at corporate headquarters is that everyone comes in to visit you instead of the other way around.  I'm going to try and do some writing on the plane, so I might post more about Boston,  but most likely I'll just dissapear till this weekend.

       ‘We want to do something crazy’ Louie said, ‘we want to go to Boston and rent out the  urlLink Orpheus Theater , but its too big, its too expensive and we’ll never be able to sell enough tickets to pay for it.  So we’re doing it for free.  We’re doing it for free, and we’re praying that 1500 people will show up.  They tell us there’s never been that many college students together in Boston to worship Jesus.  If it works we’ll set a record.’  1500 students.  There are at least five ministries in Dallas that can pull that many people together in any given week.  1500, it’s a big number until you start to think about it, until you think that there are 600,000 in the city itself, millions more in the surrounding suburbs.  Until you think about the number of colleges, Harvard, MIT, Gordon, BC, BU, Wellesley, Northeastern, Tufts.  I came to the Passion tour last October to hear Chris Tomlin and David Crowder, I came to hear Louie Gigglio speak again.  I came to worship with friends to recapture a bit of the feeling that I had at One Day this year.  I didn’t come expecting to have my heart broken for Boston, but somehow that happened.    It was a step in my life, maybe not the most important, but a step.  Part of the backstory before the story, and it helps explain why I went to Boston and why it was so important to me, the rest of the story comes later.

       Finally got a new cellphone on Saturday.  This ones a  urlLink Motorola T730  with all the fixings.  Incoming  and  outgoing calls, address book, everything.   No, honestly, those of you who knew how crapy my old phone was know how long this was coming.  The charger on the Kyocera stopped working correctly at the end of last summer and to get it to charge correctly I've had to wedge it underneath a stack of videotapes everynight since.  Then last winter the main button that accesses all the phones functions totally went out.  I couldn't see my caller id or my address book and had to start storing all my personal numbers in my work pager (back when I was in high school I had all my friends numbers memorized, just another thing that todays kids will not experience.  They've also been spared the experience of calling a girls house and having her father answer the phone. That terrifies me to this day, don't believe ask  urlLink Farley .  )  Anyway long story short the phone is cool, it works,  and it was free. No it doesn't have a camera or anything fancy,  but it does have a color screen and a ringer that sounds like I'm playing Super Mario Brothers.  And its in time for my Boston trip (two days !)

       Well our hot water heater bit the dust on Friday.  We rent which is a mixed blessing. Its the homeowners responsibility to replace the thing so were not out any money, but instead of just taking half a Saturday and two trips to Loews to pop a new one in, we have to wait for the landladys plumber to come over... with some luck we'll have hotwater back on Monday, but I'm not betting money on it.  For the time being I'm showering at church, Sam is showering at Golds, and Kev is in Florida for the weekend...

       Left the office last night and the sun hadnt' gone down yet... took a few minutes for me to realize it was because of the time change and even after it still felt good.  Other signs of summer are begining to show, those Tropical Ice stands that Sam got me hooked on have started to pop up, baseball season just started, people mowing their lawns... I can't be sure but I've got a feeling that this is going to be a great summer.

       She was attractive in a wholesome way, like all those girls from youth group I never had a chance with.  Dating her wouldn’t have been a relationship it would have been revenge.  It would have been dating a whole Christian singles culture that I somehow never really gained entrance to.  All she’s missing are teased bangs and the flower print dress.  I wonder if she knows how much of my baggage she’s carrying.  I wonder if she knows how much she fascinates me, or why…

       I don’t like talking about myself, most people do, but not me. I’m not saying this to try and be humble, I promise.  I like hearing myself talk sometimes, a lot of the time really.  I like hearing people laugh at something I said and feeling witty and smart.  And popular.  But even though I like talking about things, I don’t like talking about me.  At least not until you know me.  I guess what I mean is that I don’t like that ‘Hi, whats your name?  What do you do for a living?’ conversation.  I don’t mind introductions if I can get the other person talking about themselves.  It takes all of the pressure off of me, and I might just learn something interesting.  I already know all about me and its not terribly interesting at all.  Plus once I’ve stammered out what I do for a living I get two responses, either blank stares or people who want me to get them a job. Part of it’s the job that I do, when I did commercial electrical work I loved telling people what I did.  I could sum up the entire thing in one sentence and I was running with a crew who was pretty impressed with the blue collar credentials.  Almost made up for the fact that I was a sissy college boy. Now I work in a sub-niche of a field that you’ve never heard of.  On a good day I can just say that I work in a cubicle moving paper around.  When people push for more info I end up explaining a job that less than a hundred people in the country do.  And no matter how well I try people end up thinking I do tech support.  Or accounting.  Or that I run a phone center.  But that’s not really what I do, it sort of is, but not really and I try to explain further and… And they stare blankly wondering what they’ve gotten themselves into and we both try desperately to extricate ourselves from what is becoming a protracted and boring conversation.   And now I don’t feel witty. Or smart.  Or popular.  I feel boring, a boring person with a  boring life.

        Love for none Friendship for many Goodwill to all   I read that on the wall of TGI Fridays last week. I don't dislike the quote at all, in fact it makes me feel manly in a strange way, but its kind of hardcore to be part of a mural at a TGI Fridays. 4 inches below they had predictably written 'Fridays - 24*7' and on the oppossite wall was a painting of the statue of liberty, so its not like Fridays is just way cooler than I thought they were.  The working theory is that the guy doing the mural was a little rebelious and no one who works at Firdays ever really read the crap that got written there...

       Didn't write this myself, but it was too good to pass up...     What Your Favorite Album Says About You   by Christian Finnegan   It is said that one should never judge a book by its cover.  That seems like sound logic, but what about album covers?  A Celine Dion album, for instance, that someone tells you it’s their favorite? I think it's safe to say that you have every right to judge that album and, moreover, the person who enjoys it.  The following is a short list of various albums and what they say about the people who love them.  My favorite album is......  MOBY - Play - "I'm old, but I don't know it yet."  DAVE MATTHEWS BAND - Crash - "I know sororities are lame, but I'm still probably going to rush.  You know, just like a goof.  Because I am sooo not a dumb sorority girl.  Right? Right?"  JOHN COLTRANE -  A Love Supreme - "I tell anyone who'll listen what an avid jazz fan I am.  But the truth is, if not for that Ken Burns documentary, I wouldn't know John Coltrane Roscoe P. Coltrane."  MARY J. BLIGE - No More Drama - "I am exactly 50 percent gangsta, 50 percent gay guy."  JETHRO TULL - Thick as a Brick - "I'm your source for topnotch "Doctor Who" fan fiction."  PAVEMENT - Slanted and Enchanted - "Everyone in this room is an asshole, except me.  And yes, I know that my T-shirt is too snug."  MISS SAIGON - Original 1989 London Cast - "I am horrible in bed."  TERRENCE TRENT D'ARBY - Neither Fish nor Flesh - "I am ridiculed by black people and white people alike."  THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS - Lincoln - "Wanna hear me recite The Life of Brian in its entirety?"  JOHN MAYER - Room for Squares - "I respect you. And your gender."  ERIC CLAPTON - Crossroads - " I have to swing by JCPenney and Suncoast Video, so why don't we meet up later, in the food court?"  THE GRATEFUL DEAD - Terrapin Station - "Never mind what I did when I was younger!  I'm your father and I'm telling you: Marijuana is bad news, mister!"  EMINEM - 8 Mile: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - "Well, no, I don't actually "hang out" with black people.  But I get it.  You know, their whole deal."  WU-TANG CLAN - Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) - "I'm far more idiosyncratic that the people I grew up with in upper-middle-class suburban Massachusetts."  MICHAEL JACKSON - Invincible - "I am from Bulgaria."

       Back from Big Bend and exhausted, even though all we did today was drive.  Yesterday we saw the desert, climbed a mountain, swam in the Rio Grande, and drove over 1300 miles.  One of the all time great road trips.   urlLink Bear  should have some pictures up in the next day or so.  I'll write about it later, but now I'm just hanging out...

       McKinney High graduation was long and boring, much as I had expected. Its just difficult to spice up someone reading the names of 400 kids you don't know while they walk across a stage for a handshake and an empty diploma holder.  But honestly, I'm just a schmuck on the clock, so I don't really need to be entertained.  There were however, a few highlights. 1) Finding out that the McKinney high 2004 class song was Freebird by Skynyrd.  Freebird.  And I thought McKinney North dredging up Greenday's 'Time of Your Life' for their video yearbook was a flashback.  2) The dude who would not allow a single change this year.  I think the phrase 'Weve been doing it this way for 13 years, and next year will be 14' has entered the permanent lexicon of everyone on crew.  3) The valedictorian's speech.  I've heard some bad graduation speeches, but this was really at a whole different level. I can't even explain it.  We sent camera 3 looking for crowd shots and he couldn't find one audience member not laughing at this girl or just staring in horror.  Also the poor girl ended up with a hat three sizes too small and it kept slipping off her head.  I can not do this speech justice, I just can't.

       More high school graduations this weekend, McKinney North this weekend and McKinney in about three hours.   Last year the high school graduations made me feel old.  Its been nearly a decade since I made that walk and when you start thinking about how old these kids were when you graduated, who was president when they were born, that they never watched Dukes of Hazzard you feel a little dated.   Last night I didn't think about the year and just looked into their faces.  None of them looked young, heck half of them looked older than I did (curse of the baby face), guys who at 17 can grow a better beard than I can.  Girls I would still love to date who I could still never find a way to talk to...  This has become my new standard, if I ever look at a high school senior and think 'wow they look so young' I'll now I've gotten old.

       I've been to busy/bored/boring to update much lately, so in the tradition of all great writers, I am going to steal something from another site that I wish I'd written... enjoy...   Is your mental dictionary prepared for the summer? I mean, sure you know that pink and green are the colors of the summer, but are you up on the latest slang? I'm gonna guess that's a negative. So, because we like to keep our readers as hip as Pharell sporting a paper Burger King crown (so hip it hasn't even happened yet), here are a few critical new terms to add to your summer lexicon.  " Blueberry Muffin ," noun. It happens every May. You come back from school only to find your female friends from high school getting fatter and fatter. The term blueberry muffin describes a girl who, despite meeting that description, continues to wear the same clothes she did in high school. If you haven't made the connection between the girl and the muffin, take a look at the part of the muffin which flops over the wrapper.  " Updating My Blog ," verb phrase. Now, let me balance that out with something specifically for the ladies. The 1950's "washing my hair" excuse flippantly given to a guy for being busy on a Saturday night has been replaced for the new millennium with "updating my blog." It's the ultimate bad excuse. Girls, try telling a creepy guy that you can't go out with him this weekend because you're updating your blog and I guarantee you'll never be hearing from him again.  " Don King,"  verb. To Don King something means to take care of it or make it happen. Example: "Matt totally Don King'd the whole beach weekend for us." I got this straight from Jay-Z. And you can't argue with the inherent ballerness of anything coming from the mouth of the Jigga Man.   Natalie , noun. Everybody pretty much agrees that Lindsay Lohan is the new Britney, right? I mean, Britney basically threw up the white flag herself by dating her current beau. The dude seriously looks like he should be pushing shopping carts into the Wal-Mart parking lot cart corral, not fingers into Britney Spears' minge. Sorry, I'm getting off topic.   Anyway, so anytime you see Lindsay, you'll notice that she always has this one particular hanger-on girl with her. Upon exhaustive research (MTV Diary), I found out her name is... Natalie. Natalie is the Smithers to Lindsay's Mr. Burns, the David Blaine to her Leo DiCaprio, the George W. Bush to her Dick Cheney. Now, nothing against Natalie in particular- she's definitely hot enough to hold her own- but there's no doubt that she's well aware of her current role as the First Lady of young Hollywood. Thus, a "natalie" is basically a toadie, a fawn, a sidekick. So this summer, get your own natalie. Or, find somebody hot and be their's.   Summer , verb. As you may have noticed, preppy is totally in right now. Update your vocab accordingly by using "summer" as a verb. And if you wanna be really awesome, don't use it in the conventional sense ("My family will be summering in Martha's Vineyard again"), but use it in a more pedestrian sense. For example, "After graduation, I will be summering in my parent's garage."

       This has been a truly weird week, my resume to Tribune hit the mail two days ago, I had just started mentally preparing to leave town, I had started to feel the weight of my own potential and the excitement of change.    I just got out of my bosses office, where I was promoted.  I don't know if anything could have taken me by more surprise.  My last promotion was only six months ago.  I  have actual management responsibilities, I do reviews and approve time cards now.    I now make more money than my Dad does.   Let that sink in for a while.  I am scared, insanely scared.  Not scared that I won't live up to my new responsibilities, but scared that I will trade my velocity for security.  That I will stagante here in this town. That, well, heck I don't know what.    Still really processing this one, but had to write to help that happen...

       Had a day that can only be described as surprising.  Surprising in that I didn't expect to have a court date in downtown Dallas go so quickly or so enjoyably.  If you have a few extra bucks and hate paperwork, I suggest you hire a lawyer.  Literally all I had to do was say 'here' when they called my name.  My lawyer took care of everything else.  Surprising beccause the mile walk from the office to the Dallas Municipal Court building took me through parts of the city I'd never been to on foot.  Past restaraunts I've never eaten in, parks I didn't know existed, and to the feet of buildings I've only seen from a distance.  Surprising to only realize how much I love this city now that I'm thinking of leaving her...

       So apparently LaToya got voted off American Idol last night, looks like that entire Jackson family is having a bad year.... okay, don't feel bad nobody laughed at the office either, just thought I'd try again...  Apparenty this is some kind of travesty and scandal and no one at work can seem to shut up about it.  Luckily a quick straw poll revealed that not one of them actually voted.  I will remember this next time one of them tells me that I can't complain about the presidential election (and I plan on complaining regardless of who wins) just because I didn't vote...

       Spent most of my lunch break watching  urlLink Brave Combo  play a free show downtown.  For those of you who have never graced my fair city, Dallas lacks all resemblance of downtown street life.  None of the peanut vendors of Boston or the street musicians of New York, just, well nothing.  Blame it on the city fathers who saw fit to open an underground pedestrian mall to connect our skyscrapers in the 70s (not nearly as cool as it sounds) or the lack of any kind of real mass transist system (the DART rail doesnt' count, at least not yet) but Dallas just isn't nearly as metropolitan as most cities its' size.  Anyway, some people downtown are trying to change that, and one thing they do is sponsor free lunchtime concerts....   All this to say that I saw weird dancing guy.  Yep weird dancing guy from Taste of Addison three years ago when Joan Jett played. Still in his 70's, still dancing like Eillen Benis on ecstasy, still, I believe, wearing the exact same outfit...

It was on Saturdays...  Was that called Gummy Bears or is Gummy Bears merely the name of those atrocious candy bears that mom always stuck in your lunchbox as a 'snack' that she somehow thought was healthy because of the fruit flavors...

        A scene from my life   In the middle of the conversation it comes out that her brother is getting out of rehab next week.  She says it curtly; a hard veneer briefly coming over her normally bubbly face.  She doesn’t seem angry that I asked, she said he was ‘graduating’ and I merely asked the obvious question, but shes in no mood to talk about this with me, someone she hardly knows.    But something more is there, she doesn’t want to tell her life story, but she’s not embarrassed by her brother and won’t pretend to be.  There’s pride in her voice, not just that her brother is sober now, but that he was a drunk, because even then he was family.  I recognize this feeling from years ago, when my sister dropped out of college because she was pregnant.  You get over your feelings off embarrassment at some point, your feelings of shame, and begin to dare the world to judge you.  This is my life, this is my family, this is the true face of those I love and f you if you think you’re better than us.    Life gets hard, you pull some people close to you and shut everyone else out.  Its called survival.

        urlLink Boston  tomorrow.  More than one person has asked why I'm going, and I haven't really said.  Part of me wants to talk about how much I love the city and fireworks over Boston harbor on the 4th... part of me wants to pretend its just another vacation... because whenever I say the real reason I think I sound like super-religious holier than thou guy, and I hate that guy.  But really I feel called to that city, I got a glimpse of how much God loves Boston last time I was there and I feel a need to go back and try and tell them.  I feel the need to do more than just pray, to do more for the city and more for God.  I know that God loves every city but he has burdened me with this one and so I will go back...

        Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky.  2015 Riverside, it's time to say, "goodbye."  The Ataris  Packed up my last bag, ran the vaccum one last time, left my key with  urlLink Kev  walked out to my car and realized I couldn't lock the door anymore.  I functionally moved out a few weeks ago, but now I have to knock now when I come over.  Turning in my key officially changed me from a resident to a visitor.   We only lived in the SMOG house for a year but it felt more like three.  In some ways I never really settled in, even visitors would occassionally note that it was more like I subletted a room from Kevin and Sam, but I still got very used to living in a house.  Very used to having stairs inside my residence instead of attached to the outside of the building,  used to mowing the lawn,  used to recognizing my neighbors, used to having a garage to work in  and a fenced back yard rather than a patio overlooking the parking lot.    I've spent the majority of my adult life in apartments or dorms, so I  shouldn't have much culture shock, but getting used to  urlLink AMLI North Dallas  has still been a change, so I'm starting an occassional series where I muse on the intricacies of renting 985 square feet with 2 bedrooms 2 baths and washer/dryer hookups called  Apartment Life

        urlLink     T-Shirt of the Week   Introducing the absolutely laziest feature we've ever had on Geoff Was Here, the T-Shirt of the Week!  Every week I'll try and put up a T-shirt that I've found amusing.  A word of caution though,  think before you buy. I will put up a link to buy the actual shirt whenever I can, just to keep the copyright owners from driving to Dallas and gunning me down in the street,  but don't think I'm actually encouraging you to buy or wear these items.  Regardless of how funny they are the first time,  the joke is usually over by the third wearing.  This goes double for any shirt that is just white text on a black tee.  Triple if the T-shirt is halloween orange and says 'costume' on it.    For the seminal shirt in this collection I've chosen an all time favorite, is it racist?  I can't be sure. But as Homer Simpson said 'Its funny because it's true.'   urlLink buy

        Apartment Life - In Support of Stealing Mail   I think we can all agree that if you live in an apartment building all the mail thats left on that little table  next to the mailboxes  is pretty much free game after about three days. If the previous residents didn't care enough about their mail to come and check twice a week or at the very least leave a forwarding address, then I shouldn't have to care about their mail either.  Sure you can write 'return to sender'  on it and hope that the mailguy is feeling concientious today, but be honest, its going to end up in the trash eventually. Unless, of course someone takes it.    So why is it that people have to give me a hard time about taking one magazine that was going to be thrown out anyway? Cause people like picking fights with me, thats why.

Nope,  urlLink Blogger  released some new templates and while not officially 'cool as heck' they sure beat what I had up.

       Well, someone knicked my new cell phone. I left it in my  gym  bag in the locker room at church on Saturday when I went jogging and now its gone.  Its strange that the phone was worth digging around under my sweaty underwear for and even stranger that the thieves left my wallet and credit cards untouched, but I tried calling the phone as soon as I lost it and it just went straight to voicemail, so its either turned off or already switched over to another account.  Not sure who to blame, but the Chinese National Basketball team is practicing at the church's gym, so they're the likely culprits, what with their hatred of America and freedom.  Dang Communists, I knew this would happen when Reagan died.    If that doesn't pan out, my anger will  next turn to 'punk teenage kids'  who seem to always be skulking around the church, but right now I'm blaming the commies.  Luckily I was able to buy the same phone of ebay from some woman in Antioch Tennessee last night for a hundred bucks, so I should be back up and running in a few days...

       Safely back from New York after a very short and mostly unremarkable trip.  I did spend 13 hours at O'Hare and get a pretty good idea of why so many hate that airport.    Because of my Chicago detour and an early flight out Sunday morning I really only got two days at home, both of which were wrapped up in Camille's wedding.  Sadly two days was about right, enough time to reconnect with my family, not enough to realize that they are growing up without me.  Enough to wake up to coffee and toast with my Dad, not enough to realize that if I was back home we'd be back to routine and he'd be out the door at 4am, well before I even got up.  Enough to see my relatives, not enough to get bored and track down my old friends, who, as the saying goes, were never really friends...   In case your wondering the wedding was beautiful, I cried but only a little.  The music went over pretty well and I was even able to scrounge up a wireless mic, which was pretty cool.  I still don't really like the groom, but I'm starting to take to him, and for the first time I see that he might just be part of God's plan for my sister and my neice and nephew's life...

Most likely this means I'll have a mid 80's boombox propped on a folding chair.  :-)  Anyway I've only got about two days, so I need to get on Limewire and acquire some wedding reception music...

       I am still consistently amazed at the quality of writing at  urlLink RELEVANT  . This one hit me particularly hard...     This week, Michael found himself in a conversation he never expected. He never thought he'd hear words from her like: "It's not because I don't care for you", and "I don't know when I'll be ready for a relationship again." Suddenly Michael is in an in-between place, continuing in close relationship with his grieving fiance-turned-friend, but still left without the wife he almost had, not sure if he should give up hope or wait for her to come back when she's ready .

       For most of us college was the first time that we really go to know people who weren't just like us.  I had met blacks, hispanics, asians, some of my best friends were gay, but before college everyone I knew was from New York.  It seems amazingly Naive now, but it wasn't until I went to Cedarville that I realized there were people who didn't see Sherman as a hero, people that called a vacuum a sweeper.  I had never heard of Sonic or Chick-Fil-A.    These differences weren't great, Cedarville may have had students from all over the country and the world, but 95% of us were still white middle-class baptists, but the differences were there and they reminded us of home, so they came up in conversation a lot.  The most classic was of course the Soda v Pop v Coke debate.  Now there  urlLink scientific data  to back up what we all already knew, it just depends on where you're coming from...

        I'm nineteen but my mind is old   and when things get for real my warm heart turns cold. -  Mobb Deep, Shook Ones  I remember staring at the high school and then college tassels hanging from my rearview, ‘I’m really done being a child and some point I need to start being an adult, I wonder what I am now?’&nbsp; This was the same thing I thought looking at the blank space in the first car where I didn’t hang my tassels.&nbsp; ‘I’ve taken them down; I don’t need a daily visual reminder that this is all real and that I’m not in school anymore.&nbsp; But still, what am I now?’  People generally scoff when I say I’m old, but really I’ve felt old since I was about fifteen. For me whether you’re young or old was always about milestones rather than years. Can you drive, can you vote, can you drink?&nbsp; What year are you?&nbsp; By class or by credits?&nbsp; I was hitting marks, growing up and growing older and feeling old. &nbsp;&nbsp;Age, it seems, has always needed a context and the opposite demonstrates this as well.&nbsp; The only time I seem to call people young is when they have lapped me on the road of life, when they are getting married, or having a child, or buying a house.&nbsp; “It’s so young.&nbsp; 19 and they’re married, the only commitment I could handle at that age was a CD club and I still managed to screw that up”  After college the milestones stopped and my life, like those of so many in their twenties, seemed to stall.&nbsp; I stopped being old because I could do certain things&nbsp; and started being way to old to keep doing certain things.&nbsp; Too old to hang out at high school parties, too old to be dating an eighteen year old.&nbsp; Too old to still live in a busted down apartment.&nbsp; I have grown up without the accoutrements I always associated with adulthood; there is no wife, no kids, no house.&nbsp; There is a job, there are bills, but there is little else.&nbsp;   “It’s so young.&nbsp; 19 and their married, the only commitment I could handle at that age was a CD club and I still managed to screw that up” At this point normally I’ll make a joke about getting the first divorce in early, so I can show how hard and cynical I am,&nbsp; that I’m above it all and immensely happy with the choices I’ve made, &nbsp;but part of me is still wondering what they did right and what I did wrong.

       A quick technology story, just for my fellow nerds.... I have now officially given up on my wireless network, Micah and I could probably fix it, but we just haven't had time to mess around with it yet, so last tuesday I ran my really long cat 5 cable out Micah's window, around the apartment, and through my window.  This worked, and it got me back online without crapping up the apartment with cords, but it only left about three feet of cable in my bedroom, so to connect the old laptop I needed to sit on the floor next to my bed.    Clearly I needed an RJ45 gender bender to let me connect another, shorter piece of cat5. I go up the tollway through Richardson on my way home from work, so I stopped in at Circuit City and then Ultimate Electronics, where I found nothing but blank stares, and finally ending up at the  urlLink CompUSA  near Beltline.   This was clearly the right place, they had an entire section lablelled 'gender-benders', which I thought was pretty cool.  The term was used a lot with tech guys and engineers in the 70s and 80s, but I hadn't heard it in a few years and it never really entered the mainstream.  As I was about 13 when I first heard the term I found it quite funny, and used it whenever I could.  This was also about the time I realized why one was called the male end and the other was called the female end.  There was one memorable night when I had to talk my best friend through hooking up a modem and answered his 'which one is the male end?' question with 'think about it dude, think about it.'.        Off of my tangent and back to the story, they had gender benders for virtually every type  of computer cord in the world,  floppy drive cords, printer cables, cords I'm pretty sure are no longer in use, but none for cat5, probably the most used computer cable currently on the market. I said goodbye to my dignity and asked a salesguy for help.  'Genderbender? Genderbender?  Ha, I've never heard it called that before, you need a cat5 coupler' Geese dumbass, theres three foot of shelfspace in your store labeled 'gender benders' in size 40 font....   Wow, I typed a lot to relay one little story about a stupid clerk...

       Its been an open secret for at least a few weeks and the email should have gone out to the regulars this week, so I don't feel like I'm telling tales out of school by saying that this Sunday is the last  urlLink Metro  ever.  I've heard Jarrett's reasons and frankly agree with most of them.  Metro did attract a crowd, not a congregation.  It was very personality driven rather than ministry driven.  It did promote a consumer style of church and worship... But still losing it sucks.  Metro was Dallas' original interdenominational college worship service.  It changed the way I view God and therefore my life by letting me sit under  urlLink Matt Chandler  for a year while  he explained that obedience doesn't lead to love but that love always leads to obedience.  It helped teach me about true worship, it was always the highlight of my Monday.

So things were kind of cool in that department until the next day when the wireless network just totally crapped out.  I still can't get it back up, despite dropping 70 bucks on a new wireless card last night. So no IM for Geoff for a while...

       I get up early.  Ask any of my roommates, any of them. From Chris who wanted to shoot me every Saturday for being up at 7 while the rest of the campus slept to Kevin who couldn't figure out why in God's name laundry had to be done at that hour, to Micah who had to unlock the apartment at 7:30 so that I could start moving stuff in...   Generally I realize that the rest of the world would prefer to be asleep and I try to be considerate.  In Boston that meant that after I showered and threw some clothes on, I went out for coffee and just  spent an hour or so reading the word and praying while everyone woke up.  On my second day I ran into Jon W. who was doing the same thing, and after that it became our daily routine.  up at 5:30am, then off to Dunkin or Brueggers for a cup and a bagle.  We never said much, we both just sat there and read the Bible or the Globe, but guys are like that, we don't need verbal communication to bond, just spending time together is enough.

       Back from Boston after an amazing trip.  I'm not going to write a blow by blow acccount, usually travelouges are a lot more interesting to the people who went then they are to anyone else.  If you've ever had gramma pull out the slides of the trip to Mt.  Rushmore can attest to that.  So you'll get scattered images and moments that made an effect and that I want to talk about.  If you want the whole narrative you'll have to call me or take me out for coffee.

       After four years in Dallas I have finally found a true sub shop.   urlLink Lenny's Sub Shop  at 1300 Jackson St is new but I'm certainly not the first person to discover it, the line was nearly out the door today.  That was due to the quality of sandwich,certainly, but also to some extent to experience.  Ordering a true sub is a bit of a dance, the sandwich is so customizabe and you need to make 15 to 20 choices as the sandwich is prepared, from the bread to the type of meat to the dressings... most of the customers had never ordered food like this and seemed somewhat confused and lost. In the customers defense some of the waitstaff were getting used to the idea as well, as testified by one girls blank confused stare when the lady in front of me asked her to put Italian dressing on the sub.  The sandwich itself was really quite good,  not the best I've ever had, but the best I've had within a 1200 mile radius.

       I like Michael Moore, I've liked him since Roger & Me and was a huge fan of his shortlived Fox series TVNation. I think its important to have those who comfort the oppressed and opress the comforted, and he certainly does the latter.  Nonetheless I think we've all been wondering how many straight lies were in Fahrenheir 9/11.   urlLink This report  says 59.

       Went to a screening of  urlLink Little Black Book   at the Valley View Mall last night.  To those of you not familiar with Dallas, Valley View is a spooky Bizarro World mall full of weird mall reject shops that sits right next to the newer and much nicer Galleria Mall.  Leave it to Dallas to put two malls that close together...  After the showing I ended up on an escalator right behind Gary Colgill and decided to make some small talk.  He was gracious and charming, but it was very obvious very quickly that he had no idea who I was despite the fact that I had worked on  urlLink his show  for over a year and weve worked for the same company for three and a half years.  I mean his producer was the one who hooked me up with passes to the screening.    I still feel the shame of being confused for a local celebrity whore.
