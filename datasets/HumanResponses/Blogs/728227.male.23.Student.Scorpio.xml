      After spending a year in Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin with  urlLink AmeriCorps , moving to Ohio doesn't seem all that strange.  Beyond simply wanting to spend time with a truly special person, I do feel that I am in the right place at the right moment.  After many months of intense political agitation, I have been able to channel some of my anger into a job.  I'm currently working as a canvass supervisor with  urlLink ACT , an organization committed to pursuading, registering, and mobilizing voters for the progressive cause in  urlLink battleground states like Ohio .  The actions of the Bush administration would be much more depressing if I felt completely unable to do anything about it.  I'm going to take some courses at  urlLink Ohio State  while I'm here, and I feel much more motivated about it than I ever expected.  After years of uncertainty and aimless study, my fresh desire to work for social change has finally given me a sense of direction.  Taking time off from school was precisely what I needed to do; simply pushing forward without any clear objective had only been destructive for me.  Regardless of how I proceed, I'm confident that my further academic pursuits will not only be successful, but meaningful.

      I suppose it was only a matter of time before I took a stab at representing myself here (having already signed up for the blogger account years ago).  I've worked with web pages, personal and otherwise, since 1995 or so, but I had thus far resisted this format.  To blog requires more expressiveness and communication than I'd typically expect from myself.  Finding that voice is one reason why I'm here - even if I'm only going to be communicating with myself...

      The passing of Ronald Reagan today, while not unexpected, presents a moment to reflect on his life and legacy as the 40th President of the United States.  While he remains a polarizing figure for some, his administration continues to serve as an example for conservatives seeking to build political consensus.  In its pursuit of a politically expedient  urlLink solution  to the question of stem cell research, however, the current Bush administration has undermined progress in a field of medicine that shows great  urlLink promise  for treatment of the very disease that afflicted Reagan in his later years.  While no one would suggest that Bush's reluctant stance contributed directly to his predecessor's death, Nancy Reagan has strongly advocated changing the policy and supporting the type of stem cell research that could help prevent countless others from suffering the effects of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and other recalcitrant diseases.  Elected officials have a strong moral obligation to support research that will improve the lives of their constituents, despite the vocal opposition of a conservative minority within the religious community.  Just last month, Mrs. Reagan  urlLink expressed  her continuing frustration: "I just don't see how we can turn our backs on this...  We have lost so much time already.  I just really can't bear to lose any more."
