       Okay, I just had to post before the night was over. And to cover up that friggin large entry o.o I do that always, trust me.      Eeh. I wish I could make my own layout for this... but my website isn't ready yet, and the HTML is too complex. Besides, I'm too tired to sift through all of the HTML. Why I kinda wanna go back to Diaryland...      Speaking of which,   Derek got a Gold membership on Diaryland, which makes me really sad 'cause I just left Diaryland!!! I wanted a Gold Membership too! Grr... x.x I hate my not-being-able-to-listen-when-I'm-blogging.      Well, at least this template is to my liking. Still wish that Derek told me, but then again, I doubt he woulda got me a Gold, it's 30 dollars. *sighs*      Ne. The only time I'm going to be using a credit card for anything is A) the next time my sister wants me to do something on EBay, or B) when I get mah domain name. Which won't be soon. I'm actually WONDERING if I'm getting one anymore, because I'm so totally indoubt that I will.      Tommorrow... summer school. Math. Then the shop. And Derek will be going to his second school, so no Derek. *sighs* More boredom. I hate this week, or how it's turning out so far.      *whacks her head against the screen* Ne. I really dislike how this week is coming out... I shoulda gone to church or something this morning. I woulda felt better about today.      *sighs*      Eeh. I don't know. I'm not looking forward to my brain falling out tommorrow. What I GUESS I could look forward to is playing Pokemon Sapphire some more, but come on - I've had it for two weeks and already I have almost 100 hours.      I dunno. Call me a complainer, I think it's just that I'm tired and slightly annoyed about the week and my current posture. Ever since I've gotten that game I've been killing my back...      I'm wondering if I'll meet any friends through this blog right now... I got this blog 'cause a kind-of friend of mine, Finni, has one, but she actually understands this HTML, unlike me. I mean, I understand the just of it, I just don't know how to create a layout as complex as one of these. I understand a lot of HTML, but I've only been in that area for about two years, so...      Oh - here's a song I FINALLY finished, called Chance. I wrote it back when me and my good friend, Alex, were together, and I finally finished it because I sang it today to Derek. My vocals have improved, thank goodness, so it sounded really good... I wish my microphone was working so I could record it. But anyway, here's Chance.       Hold me close again     Like you did before the summer end     Another year has gone by     A simple wish     That's carried away with your kiss     Seems like I have wings to fly      Now nothing can go wrong     With me in your arms     As long as you're not gone     Again      Close my eyes   Flash a smile   Nothing, no one, has been this nice to me   Hold my hands   Give me a sign   'Cause you're the one that gave me a chance   For me... to me    Remember when I was lost that day   You took my hand and led the way   Could I, would I give you up?   Are you my number one   Has our story only just begun?   Is this my destiny...    It's such a different thing   Lying next to you, wondering   How can I be so lucky   When it comes to you      Close my eyes     Flash a smile     Nothing, no one, has been this nice to me     Hold my hands     Give me a sign     'Cause you're the one that gave me a chance     For me... to me      Oh baby, don't let me go solo     How could I ever let you go?     You're like flyin' on angel wings     A little girl's song     No more can go wrong     So let me forget about real things      Oh oh... just one chance      Close my eyes     Flash a smile     Nothing, no one, has been this nice to me     Hold my hands     Give me a sign     '    Cause you're the one that gave me a chance     For me... to me  ~Chance, by Crystal*Starr    That song should be on my "CD"... when I finish my website, it should be there. I'm trying to make a "CD" of all my good works, and hopefully if I can actually record myself singing them and find some backround music, I could probably make it... or not... *sighs* Low optimisim these days, sorry.      I want to be famous SO bad... *sighs* I mean... not because of the thought of being famous... but I'd actually be noticed... and I'd be able to sing my heart out the way I wanna... and just SHOW people I'm not... nobody.      I should go... *sighs* Another "brilliant" day awaits me. And another brilliant night of sleep... I really need that CD of Derek's recordings of him saying goodnight to me...      ~Crystal

       Hey you! That's my way of saying hello, if you're wondering. My name... well... Arrg. Actually, it's really hard to describe me in few words, and I don't even know how to introduce myself. It's hard to understand me, and it's hard to just know me right off the bat, even when it comes to names. So bear with me, while I try my best to introduce myself to... all of you, which is probably none of you except my conceited self.     So how do I start this off?  I am an enigma. That's the first thing I have to say. That word is a word I learned just recently, and a lot of times I slip and say echidna, but I am an enigma. An enigma, by Dictionary.com standards, is this:   e·nig·ma  urlLink  ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (-ngm)n. One that is puzzling, ambiguous, or inexplicable. A perplexing speech or text; a riddle.   So there you are. I am an enigma. I am very puzzling, ambiguous, inexplicable, perplexing, and a riddle. Thank goodness I'm not a speech or text, although I guess this is. This blog, or whatever. I refer to it as a blog. You may refer to it as a journal, a diary, a piece of webspace, but I call it a blog - short for weblog.     My name is Kimberly Lai. Or rather, that's what people call me off the 'net and away from the pen and paper. Even there, though, away from those two things, I have many amounts of names. Lai Jin Ping is my Chinese name, and "Jin" (what you would call my first name by English standards) means "One Who has a lot of Gold". That doesn't mean you can just come right up to me and ask me for money though, heh. I'm actually very much so broke at the moment, so yeah. But my parents refer to me as Jin Ping, Kim, or Kimberly, my sisters refer to me as Kim or the little one, my friends refer to me as Kim or Kaylai, a nickname I gave myself. Kay as in K from my first name, and Lai as in my last name. BTW (By The Way), Lai is pronounced Lie. Which is where my childhood nickname, Liar, came from. But I'm not a liar. I actually try my best to tell the truth at all times due to that stupid nickname. Back to what I was saying before though, as for myself... I don't actually call myself anything. I don't know WHAT to call myself, except "me", because I've been put into such a mixture of names that I've made myself become an enigma.  When it comes to the pen and paper, I'm referred to as mostly three things - The Author, The Midnight Writer, and the name that makes me known - Crystal*Starr. What I mean by "makes me known" is that most people, when they read something I write... it's usually under that name. It's a pen name. I like being referred to that, for some odd reason. BTW, if you can't tell, what I mean by "the pen and paper" is when I'm writing. I write a lot of things, but mostly I write fiction, narrative essays if you must. I write a lot of fantasy, and my current project is a book/manga (Japanese comic - I draw as well) called BakariBaka. I'll go more into depth of that later though. But usually, if you see something in the newspaper (which is not now, but it will be soon - I'm trying to submit stuff into local/non-local newspapers) or online or anywhere under the name "Crystal*Starr", that would be me.  When it comes to the 'net, I am Crystal. Plain old Crystal. Except, well, in a sense, Crystal is NOT plain. Crystal is me, but in the way I'd like to be away from the 'net but can't - a girl who just wants to have fun, who loves having friends and being what she is without caring what others think. She says what's on her mind and doesn't care what others think of her, and she would rather be the fool than the unnoticed. She's a girl who I've built up in my mind, so to speak, and yet, she's me. She's me, very rarely, away from the net, but on the 'net, and with really good friends... she's me.  Sadly, off the computer, she is not me. I am everything she's not. I am quiet, and I can't always say what's on my mind, and I'm not very strong, emotionally and physically. I'd love to be what she is, and sometimes I am, it just is hard for me to be that way always.  But back to the subject of Crystal. Who I guess is me, but at the same time isn't. I hope this isn't confusing you. As Crystal, I go by a lot of nicknames - Crystal, Crys, Cryssi (much to my dismay), CrysPix... you name it. Anything with "Crys" is just another nickname for me. My screen name for most things is Crystal4eak, which includes my name Crystal and a word I made up when I was 10 - 4eak. 4eak is basically "freak". I'm stuck saying freak as fur-eak now due to the word 4eak, but yeah. If you say "4" and "eak" quickly, it is basically freak. Due to my enigma-ness, most people call me a weirdo or a freak, and Crystal4eak is basically... Well, Crystal4eak.  Well. Now that I've FINALLY finished talking about my name... let's go onto the rest of me, which you probably don't capture a very good image of. Don't worry, it shouldn't be as hard as the rest.  I'm a 13 year old Taiwanese girl. Simple enough. My birthday is October 17th, 1990. I don't remember much else about my birth, except that I was born around 7 or 8 PM, and that I was apparently very large. *sighs* I get a lot of comments from people that knew me when I was baby, and all the comments are the same: "I remember you when you were a baby! You were HUGE!!!"  If you're wondering what Taiwanese is, no, it's not Thai. Taiwan is a small island off of the coast of China, and if you look at a bunch of cheap little kid toys, most of them say "Made in Taiwan". I wasn't born in Taiwan though. Almost everyone in my family except me was born in Taiwan. I was born in Garden Grove Hospital in California. The fact that I lived in Cypress (California as well) though, and I was born in Garden Grove, was always a mystery to me.  I've lived in California all my life. I've moved three times, but I stayed in California. I've lived in Cypress (from my birth to the age of 6) to Fullerton (from 6 to 10) and Alhambra after that. Alhambra is my current "home". Technically, though, it's my grandmother's house, but most of the Lai family has lived in it at some point in time. It's where I currently reside. Alhambra is a nice place, I guess. I like it a lot more now, as appose to when I was 10 and I hated it. Alhambra is just a few miles away from Los Angeles and Pasadena. I used to visit both cities often, but lately I've stopped.  Anything else that's vital?  I recently graduated Granada Elementary/Middle school and am about to enter Alhambra High School, or AHS for short. I am deeply inlove with my boyfriend Derek, who I've been with for about six months and I'm VERY happy about that! Not much else, except that my social life's a wreck and a blog, a boyfriend, and my love of soda is all I've got left to hang on to.  Oh yes. And my BakariBaka. So called "Only Idiot" due to my lack of Japanese intellect, it's a story I created this past spring about a girl who obtains supernatural powers and two odd supernatural beings who watch her so that she won't destroy the world with her powers. She meets friends with powers and supernatural beings like hers, and such. Go to its website,  urlLink http://witty.as/bakaribaka  for more info. And why did that just sound like a commercial? I'm really hoping that BakariBaka will obtain a lot of fame though and that I work on it more often someday. As dramatic as is sounds, it's very comedic and witty, as appose to most supernatural being type movies I've seen/books I've read.  BTW, I just remembered as I got my ice tea - I have a stomach disorder. My stomach is very sensitive and sometimes the acidity will be stronger than usual, causing my stomach to hurt and me to throw up at times. Usually it's only when I'm stressed out though and I forget to eat. I usually don't eat much anyway, I usually drink more liquids than I eat solids, and I usually am thirsty. I think I'm one of the few Americans who drink about a gallon and a half of liquids each day.  Can't seem to think of much else about me... I feel so conceited, writing all of this!  Oohh. I found something that basically sums up EVERYTHING about me. Which sadly I found after I typed this gigantic motherload of nonsense, but yeah. I wrote it ages ago, for an old website I had. Most of it still applies, I deleted most that are already here or just don't make sense anymore.        Umm... I'll try to keep this really short... although you shouldn't count on it.       As you can tell, my name's Kimberly Lai, but I really don't like that name (dun ask). Which is probably why I have so many aliases! I go by a lot of names but the two I go by online are Crystal*Starr and Kaylai tha 4eak. Crystal*Starr is a pen name for when I write, or draw, a lot of things actually. And Kaylai the 4eak... well... that's my nickname around my friends. Kaylai is composed of my first initial in my name, K, and sticking it next to my last name, Lai (Lai is pronounced like lie). So there we get Kaylai! I try to make up similar names for my friends, but with names like Jayluce and Cifong it's kinda weird really XD        As the information states up there, I'm 13 years old. My birthday's on October 17, 1990. Most people forget my birthday, sadly u.u If I had the choice, I'd be 13 forever! I love being 13 for some reason. I do live in California, I'm not telling you precisely where, but I live somewhere near Los Angeles.     Yes, I'm technically what you would call an internet freak. Although due to an internet timer and a quickly-blossomed social life, I'm letting go of the computer less and less... And no I do not have the computer monitor chained to my leg! *hides it* That's...um... a funky anklet! Yeah! Heh heh... But yeah. I like to chat online a bit, and I usually use emoticons, but the ones that aren't really a "smiley face", such as these --> ^^; X3 XD! o.O; 0-0! x.- u.o I also roleplay a bit, which is when you do actions in aristicks (*) or colons (:) and such.      One of my good friends told me that people usually act differently infront of people versus when they're behind a computer screen. He told me it's that little thing that makes you think you can be anyone you want to be when nobody sees you. I guess that applies to me... In real life, I'm not a very confident person... I have a kind of low self-esteem, and sometimes I don't even know what I'm saying or rambling about. My friends though see kind of that different side of me, both my online and offline. I think it's that insecurity of mine that I have that I never want to look like the fool or anything infront of other people. But infront of my friends I'm very outgoing, and I'm kind of loud really. I like to be funny and sarcastic and... well I'm a mix of a lot of things. I love to hang out with my friends, often I'm grounded 'cause of me going out too much. *giggles* But I still get to hang out with friends and I love it. Having a good time is a number one priority in my life, next to having really great friends I can always count on.      Even though I'm funny and I like having a good time, I sometimes go into deep depressions. I really dislike them. My sisters state that I might have a depression disorder, but I try to stay positive. For a good year in my life I was depressed and I really hated everything. Now I'm okay I guess. I'm getting over some of my past depressions still, but it comes very little, and even then my friends are by my side.      I have a very overreactive imagination, and it ties into two of my talents - writing and drawing. Although I'm not the greatest at both, I really like them, and they've become my hobbies. I like to draw a few of my made-up characters, and you can see a small site about them here. I'm a very large dreamer, and I love to dream of future things. I'm also kind of an anime freak of sorts, and my characters are slightly anime-ish, so yeah. Particularly I like Digimon, because that's the only anime I can keep up with anymore.      I'm really good at making websites, if you can't tell. Well, not really good. But I hope to be even better some day. I really like to make them for some reason, which may explain this site, heh. One day I hope to have an nationally known website, maybe even internationally. But for now I'm stuck with little ones, but I'm okay with it. I'm pretty good with computers too... I happen to think they're alive  .>      Umm... anything else... hm...      As you can see, I've been rambling a lot about myself. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M CONCEITED!!! I try to be anything but... although you will catch me tending to my elbow-length hair, and staring at myself in the mirror. Eh. Okay, I shall admit - one of my flaws is self-denial. Another one is rambling too o.o; Which is why I shall stop this now ^^;   So there you have it! And sorry for sounding so serious and acting like I was 30 until about the end, the caffeine in my tea cheered me up. *giggles* So now you know more about me and... me. Just mostly about me. Wow, I really do feel conceited.   If you're wondering about the whole "C-Starr. Seven Letters. All me." thing, Crystal is seven letters. C-Starr is too (including the dash), I think. Kimberly is eight though... Also if you were wondering, this is my fourth blog. So yeah. Lots of blogging that I've done! I guess you could call me an experienced blogger or something.   Anyway, I have to go. It's almost ten, and I'm out of... me to talk about? Well, yeah. See ya later. Shall hopefully talk about something other than me after this, I'm like that when I get a new blog...   ~Crystal

       Arrg. How long does it take to get this working?! *sighs* I hate this blogger thingahmabobber.  Well. My day has been... okay. Not good. Not great. Not bad, though, either. *sighs* I don't know. Frustrating, contemplating how to describe it.  My day... *laughs* It's like describing my name. So hard, yet so simple.  Anyway. Things have been... interesting? I don't know. Just... certain things are hard to describe. I started off being miserable, and I guess I'm not miserable, but I'm thoughtful. I'm constantly thinking about things, I guess.. I have to think about every single side of this cube of life before I actually do something. Guess that's why it takes me so long to make decisions...  I'm at Dare's house right now, just online right now contemplating everything that's happened. Okay, I use the word "contemplating" way too often, so I'll stick to just plain "thinking".  I woke up this morning with a bad stomach ache. I was also extremely tired and didn't get up very easily due to my lack of sleep last night (I had trouble going to sleep - nightmares...) so it was kind of hard waking up. After my stomach ache finally passed I went to the kitchen and took my pill (Nexium - stomach pill. Note that I don't take anti-depressants). Ironically (at least in my point of view), even though I got a stomach ache that morning I didn't eat breakfast. And then I went to summer school, as usual.  Summer school wasn't bad. I actually did it very quickly. Either I'm actually starting to get the hang of it, or it was just really easy, I don't know. But last Friday, the day that Derek came with me, I actually did it very well (Only five wrong!). So maybe it has to do with focus? I don't know. But anyway, I finished my math and just waited to go back to the flower shop my parents own and that I sit and rot all day playing Pokemon.  But today, my mom took me home early - she is currently studying for a cosmotology (the area of beauty, such as hairdressing and etc) test so that she can become a teacher, and she's taking it next week, so she wanted to study at home without interruption from the customers. So when I got home, I called Dare and asked him if he wanted to hang out, and he said he wanted me to come over, so I did.  On the way here, he told me he wanted to show me something.  A conversation with Melody.  Melody is my old friend that I've known since I was 11, I think. She's been with me through a lot, but we haven't talked for a while - When I broke up with Alex, after a while she and him were talking, and they got together. She asked me if it bothered me before they did, but I told her no - simply because she was a good friend of mine, and that Alex is the kind of guy that could cheer anyone up and make them feel happy... so I just said no. The truth was, though, I was getting over the fact that he and I broke up still, because it hurt me a lot, and I was hurt a LOT.  But anyway. I read it. And I guess I'm relieved? No, that's not the word. I don't know how to explain it. I guess though that that feeling lead me to being thoughtful as I am now (See, I didn't say contemplating!) and... well, I'm just thinking about all of this and just soaking it in, like I said before. Wistfulness, to say.  I don't know. I'll go now - it's almost time to go to Kumon (Derek's second school) and yeah. Ciao, I guess.  ~Crystal

       Anyone find me yet? Guess not. So, let's continue with hearing about mah dramatics, aka my day.    Erk. Where do I start?    Last night. That's a good beginning. I had thought I had a great day, 'cause I got to go home early from the shop, and I even got to see Derek! It was great. I mean, at least I thought it was. (BTW, I'm writing this as I read Derek's diary, so that I can remember a bit more. And I was never really THAT bothered by tha pranks and such...) If you wanna hear about the first part of mah day though, read the entry before this. Anyway, I went home a while afterwards, after a great dinner at Souplantation after a great swim (Although, I still feel funny after wearing Derek's clothes...) and I went home after eating the first full meal in about 24 hours, and I was satisfied.     I got online. I thought I was fine, until a bit before I had to go.    Please, PML. PML means Pardon My Language, if you don't know. The following is just... arrg.    Peter IMs me. Peter is an ex-friend of mine. He's constantly pissed off at me now because of one stupid thing - My boyfriend. Okay, look. I basically have no other friends right now, so there's a reason why Derek is the only guy I talk about hanging out with. Because he IS the only one I can hang out with anymore. My offline friends, Amih and Scrubie (nicknames - not revealing their real ones 'cause I dun think it'd be good with them), they're mad at me too, but I just CAN'T see them. I mean, I'd be able to see Amih if I could, but I'm always busy at the flower shop my parents own.    But back to what I was saying. IM pops up with Peter's screen name. I ask him what he wants. He acts like he's about to apologise.    He friggin' IMs me so that I'll delete my profile.    Okay, look. I "matter" to you THAT much? Look, it's bad enough that you're mad at me. If you apparently "hate" me so much, why in the fucking world--?! You just don't make sense, you bastard. If you HATE me so much, you shouldn't even CARE about STUPID FUCKING THINGS like that!    I got really mad at that. And I wanted to talk to Derek, but he was away. And somehow, talking to Bobby (Derek's best friend and a friend of mine), I got really emotional and just basically yelled at Derek on the phone after my talk with Bobby. I was just really ticked off... because people aren't honest with me. I don't CARE if they're keeping back something that they think will piss me off. Because Bobby didn't tell me at all until now that he thought that I was kind of attention-seeking. I knew that, but I never thought HE thought of me that way.     So I called Derek, and just blew it all at him, getting mad at him in the process... and we got into another fight. I felt really bad. What's worse, is that I wasn't the only one yelling. Derek yelled at me back. And I never felt so... I don't know. I felt really hurt. Not at the fact that he yelled, but that I ended up saying that I wanted him to find someone else. I didn't really mean that. I just thought he'd fair off better with someone other than I... And then finally, we just decided we'd talk some other time. I got off the phone feeling hurt and miserable, and I cried because I realised that Derek could find someone else (The thing that I said was "Look, right now... I really think that you deserve someone a lot better... and you know, while we're on this break, if you find someone else... it doesn't matter to me. As long as you're happy") in the time that I was leaving him alone. And it hurt a lot, because deep down inside all I wanted for him to do was stay with me and us be together, because I really need him right now. I prayed to God that Derek would forgive me for all I said and that he'd understand at some point that I just want him to be with me.    I feel asleep. For once. At about 12. To nightmares. Nice thought, that my lullabies were nightmares. What where they... one was this one, that I wrote in mah old blog:     I had the worst dream... I had a dream Derek and I really did break up... and it was about a few months later (P-chan, this was about the time of the carcrash vision), in the fall, near my birthday. I think it was right after my birthday... and I couldn't stand not Derek there, and I went over to his house because he said he'd always be there for me even if we did break up, and I saw him and this other girl go into his house, both smiling and holding each other and such. After they went in I started crying on his front step and eventually ran into the street crying and didn't see a car coming. I died exactly like my vision.       It doesn't end there...       It went to my funeral. It was very Buddhist like, even if I'm not Buddhist anymore and I'm Christian. I guess my mom and my sister (Cindy) had an argument about that because they were really mad at each other. Then Derek looked away from my grave and he sighed. I think he started crying a little bit but then his girlfriend came up and gave him a tissue and then walked away. [SHOULDN'T YOU OF COMFORTED HIM YOU-- Wait...why am I complaining about a dream...] Then I guess it flashed to a little bit later when Derek was leaving in his grandfather's car and his girlfriend asked "Hey how did you know that girl who died, anyway?" and Derek just said "She's just a friend of mine. She doesn't matter to me anymore though."     Yeah. The rest weren't as bad... just other ones pretty much exactly like that.    I woke up to a vicious stomach ache. Basically crawled to tha kitchen wiff a headache and choked down my medicine. I asked my mom if I could stay home, but I couldn't. I waited for my turn in tha shower, and while I did, I cried and prayed that later that day I'd be able to talk to Dare about all of the mess I made. I prayed that it doesn't really matter to me if Derek and I broke up as long as he was happy... cause I felt so bad, I was making him feel so miserable... I finally was cut off when I heard my mom come out of the shower, so I grabbed my things and went in. I ended up praying and crying in tha shower too, but still.    Finally, we left. My mom was asking me about what was wrong (She saw/heard me crying) and I just told her that Derek and I got into a fight, and she acknowledged that (Wow, that's a first) and left me to myself.    I went to school and ended up getting a bit more cheered up, due to tha fact that I caught a Bagon in Pokemon Sapphire and named it Yoshi, hee. He friggin' made Thief, my lovable Level 47 Poochyena, faint - And he was ONLY on Level 25! I luff Jason, he helped me catch Yoshi! (Jason ish mah little chibi dude who helps me play Pokemon. I wish I could help him with his Feebas problem...) I think he also made my Spheal faint and something else - maybe my Marill which I use primarily for Meteor Falls? - and I was really proud I caught him 'cause he was so strong.    But when I left (right after I caught Yoshi), I felt pretty miserable because I knew what was ahead of me - a day of thinking about Derek, playing Pokemon, and my stomach hurting. [I realise as I write this that I should start bringing my stomach medicine around with me, but I never think that I would have a stomach ache during school, and yet I always do. I'll start doing that for high school.]    I got to the shop and basically kept playing, training mah Pokemon for the Elite Four. Currently all of them are on Level 49, and I'm stuck in Victory Road T_T Some road. It's a friggin' cave that's confusing... I was sitting there for about three hours trying to figure out how to get out, and I got out the way I came in. T_T;     After that, I had a talk with my dad if somehow Stephanie (my dad's cousin's daugher, aka my second cousin who happens to be a great friend of mine. She's referred to as either Steph or Cody.) could come to Alhambra and stay here for about a week. I e-mailed her last night, and she said she probably couldn't due to the fact that she was in Taiwan and that the plane ticket would be expensive after that trip, so yeah, but I still want her to come... I dunno. But my dad gave me a bit of intellectual insight on Taiwan and the flight there and such. Made me miss Cody-chan...    And then I got to go home early (considering the usual time, which is at 7:30) 'cause my mom went to go visit a friend's. We closed up at 6 and got home at 7, yay! n_n    As soon as I got home I checked my e-mail, and then ran to tha phone (which isn't that far). I called Derek, and we agreed to meet up.    We both basically forgave each other for yelling... and we had dinner together, and just cuddled up on the couch.    And now I'm happy again, I guess. I'm exhausted, due to tha day and tha dramatic flourish of events that have happened. I guess I'm more relieved, that I have that person I love with me and that I've resolved these problems.    I dunno. I should get going - 10:30. Ja mata!    ~Crystal

       That's a really good word right now. Diminished. Wow, I learn a new word everyday. Close enough to a new thing to learn every day, which I don't...  I hate it when my day goes from extrodinarily awesome and me being in a great mood all day, to extremely sucky and downright bad in just two minutes.  Morning. Eeh. I woke up from four nightmares. But ya know? After getting up, shaking it off of me, getting ready for school, and looking forward to seeing Derek tonight, I was pretty happy.  School itself. Not bad, actually. 'Twas... focused. I didn't get that much wrong on my math. As soon as it was corrected, I got to go to lunch. Carl's Jr. Soggy, oily, and probably gross enough to make me want to become a vegetarian for good. (I've been trying to become one, but then someone always makes me think of chili fries, and from there, I just pig out at Rick's, the local burger joint, or somewhere.) Alisia, Jason, and I were playing Pokemon... and I finally beat the Elite Four! So now I have to go get them cake. T_T; (The promise was, "If you two help me defeat the Elite Four today, before I go, then I'll buy you guys cake")  Caught a Surskit, unlocked the mystery of the Sealed Chamber, such. Oh, and got kinda sad when I beat the Trick Master. I luff him . .;  After that, I finished my math and got to go back to the shop. Where I ate a second lunch! Vietnamese sandwiches. I only ate a bite though... was playing my game the whole time.  And then my dad came back, and he brought beef noodle soup, which I ate. It's funny how much I actually ate today, considering how little I usually eat. (I usually only eat one meal a day - lunch. I ate lunch and dinner. Forgot about breakfast.)  Stuff happened. Mostly just played Pokemon at the shop. Then it was 7, and we closed up, or at least me and my dad did. Mom and my aunt were talking about something. I still think they are, just at Tea Station or summat. Dad drove me to go deliver a painting, and then we went home.  Arrg. I wish I never came home. Maybe I'd be in a better mood.  Derek said that he wanted to see me today (He said it yesterday, while we were poking fun at some wannabe 12 year old cholos/cholita) and so when I came home, I called him. I wanted to tell him how I beat the Elite Four, about how I was in a good mood all day, such.  He went to Liz's house.  Yeh. I found out when I called his house and his grandmother told me. She told me she's staying overnight. I think she knows now that I'm super uber clingy, but yeah. She said something like "Don't worry, he'll be home tommorrow."  *sigh*  It really bothers me when he tells me "I'm looking so forward to seeing you! I wanna see you so much, I miss you SO much while you're gone!" and then he leaves.  So yeah. My mood, diminished.  I mean, it's not totally bad. I at least have like, 10% of my mood left, so I'm at least not totally sarcastic and mean. But I hate it when he does stuff like that. I know he just can't say no to that kind of stuff, he can't say no to ANYBODY, but when he does those kind of stunts... it's like he's saying no to ME.  I know, I know. PLEASE don't tell me "Oh Crys, you need to GET A LIFE!" 'cause I know I do. *sighs* Pokemon and a boyfriend. What do you expect? Not to mention food, whenever I do consume it.  Besides. It really does bother me when people say stuff like that. Like when people say "Oh my gosh! I'm SO looking forward to seeing you this summer! It's gonna be SO much fun!" and then they decide that I'm a worthless piece of space in this world and go somewhere else without telling me.  (That's never happened before, BTW. Something slightly similar has, not the boyfriend situation, but yeah. Amih said to me once "I really wanna see you this summer! We can hang out and EVERYTHING!" and then decided not to do much about it except call me to complain and brag about stuff.)  But it really does bother me. I mean, I kept telling myself not to feel sad throughout the day so that Derek could be really happy. Because, well, I guess (please bare with me through this, it's awfully confusing what I'm about to say) in my eyes that in his eyes I'm this depressed freak. I'm constantly this depressed freak that is so clingy and whines and such. And I wanted to be something different for him today, ya know? 'Cause he's been feeling pretty upset, and he constantly asks me "Are you all right?" as if I'm going to break down any second... I dunno.  I just wanted to be happy. For him.  I wanted to be happy for me, too. I mean, every time I look in the mirror, I just... arrg. I dunno. I get really frustrated. Because I'm not this person I want to be. I want to be stable, at least. To be in a mood OTHER than sarcastic and OTHER than depressed and OTHER than blah.  So my point is...  I just wish I could've shown him what a good mood I was in today, without being upset and disappointed like I am right now.  I mean, I guess I could just TELL him... but it wouldn't of been the same.  Right now, I guess I'm just kind of dubious that he'll keep his promise - "I'll call you tommorrow. I promise!". I mean, he says that almost every time he goes somewhere and he rarely ever does. I mean, I don't blame him, but... *sighs* I mean, I get worried, you know? And half the time, whenever he's away, I'm having issues and am thinking about stuff, and I just want someone to talk it over with... and all I have is a GBA and a computer.  Sometimes, I wonder... if I was a guy, would I make a better boyfriend than Derek does?  Eeeh. I don't know. I think I'm just being a selfish person right now, so I'll talk about summat else.  Every now and again, I'll catch myself thinking about high school... Those kind of before-school jitters. I mean, it's high school - a totally diff world to me.  I need to get a bike before school starts, I just remembered... either that or a scooter. Oddly enough, I get into less accidents with a scooter than a bike, but I tend to hurt more people with my scooter.  Eeh.  Things that...  I think won't happen during highschool: -I'll get famous as a singer, be able to drop out in my first year, and I'll never have to go to school again. -I'll get famous as a writer, be able to drop out in my first year, and I'll never have to go to school again. -I'll get famous as a artist, be able to drop out in my first year, and I'll never have to go to school again.  I think WILL happen during highschool: -I'll get famous for being the person who dreams way too much -.-; -Angelo, Chris J, Alex J, and the jerks from school will all be in the debate team -The above jerks will still hate me. -Most people will either hate me, or not remember me -Most people won't know I exist in the first place, so there -Most people who do know me (and if Derek and I are still together) will be boggled by the fact Derek and I lasted longer than Granada's school record (Granada School's longest relationship record - 3 months o.o)  I think I'm dubious about: -Derek and I lasting until high school starts (I'm SO worried about the 7th month u.u So is he...) -The idea of either running about 7 blocks to high school or getting a bike... and not crashing into any trees. [Poor trees!] -Me getting good grades -Me being able to keep up with the chaotic schoolwork -Me being able to stay alive 'till then  I need a self-esteem boost soon T_T;  Anyway, I'll get off now, play some more Pokemon, distress myself to death~  [EDIT] Okay, I need to get something off my chest right now, or else.  I've been blogging for OVER AN HOUR. Do I really feel this bad?  (Yeah - I've been writing this since 8:30, and I'M NOT DONE.)  *sigh*  Derek just called. I was being a complete jerk to him, I know... but...  I didn't even get to tell him about anything. How I felt, how much I hated it when he was being this way, etc.  Why am I like this? Why can't I tell someone how I feel unless I'm mad and about to scream my guts about? Because seriously, I am. I'm about to burst in tears.  Yeah, I know. I'm a complete wuss. But seriously! I've been so dubious about everything lately... if he and I are gonna last... if he even cares about me anymore... *sighs*  I need him now more than ever though... if he's gone before high school I don't know what I'll do . .; I mean... my life... is just a wreck. I mean, it's better than most, but seriously, if there's no one that's going to be by me, what's the point?  *sigh* Somehow, I feel like this is gonna go the same way it did the last time he went to Liz's house. With me yelling at him and telling him I want to break up.  I'll go now. *sighs*  ~Crystal

A convention, and a midnight movie. He'll be back Sunday. So... I won't be seeing him for... *counts* Adding on to how long I haven't seen him already, about four days.  I need to find something to do other than blog/go on   urlLink  DeviantArt   /talk [or complain] on AIM... I wanna go on a roleplaying site like GaiaOnline or Neopets, but Neo is just NOT my thing anymore (I was on there for a while, and then I quit due to boredom and lack of favoritism) and Gaia is just hard to stick to x.X Besides, I'm on there as Puppi (My chara from BakariBaka - also one of my popular roleplaying characters) and if I wanted to change my name I'd have to pay like 10,000 gold T_T; And after Neo, I've basically given up on all pet-type roleplaying sites, so there goes AMZ (AfterMathZone) and Subeta...  But I really want to roleplay more. And 'pparently, no one roleplays on AIM with me anymore. So... yeah.  Shall go draw now. *sighs* I'm inspired.  ~Crystal

        nonpareil \non-puh-REL\, adjective: Having no equal; peerless.     noun: 1. Something of unequaled excellence; a peerless thing or person. 2. A flat disk of chocolate covered with beads of colored sugar.    Word of the Day. Woo.  Yeah, I'm back from my day. I think after playing so many video games, I think they sucked out my happy mood. Lemme explain...  Got off at 11:30, to go take a shower. Decided that I was gonna hang out with Mike, my old friend from Granada who graduated a year before I did. I hadn't seen him since seventh grade, so yeah. We didn't do much, just basically hang out at a video game store until we got bored, and then went to another one. I played Zelda, the Four Swords one I think. Gotta love Blue Link! Speaking of Link, here's a quiz. I was bored o_o;    urlLink         urlLink theOtaku.com: What Color Link Are You?     Hmm. Green. Not bad. I like Red and Blue better though. Purple always made me die T_T;  *sigh* So yeah. That's how my day went. Lots of video games. And very little amounts of food. My stomach hates me.  Now that I'm home, I really am feeling down though... I really wish Derek was home.  I think I'll just tell my parents that I want to hang out on Main Street again, probably by myself this time. There's low probability that Derek's coming home.  I don't mean to sound doubtful of him. I'm serious, I don't. I just don't expect him to come home. And if he does, I'll be slighty suprised.  Ne. Confession time, 'cause I'm just feeling really bothered by something.  The one thing I've always been afraid of is that Derek will cheat on me. Don't ask me why. I think it's just the mere fact of anyone cheating on me that bothers me, but for some reason Derek is the one that feels most liable. I mean, I've gotten into so many fights with him sometimes I wonder if he's fed up with me.  For some reason, I've been getting a lot of nightmares this past week about Derek cheating on me. I have no idea if that's a sign or not, but suddenly I'm really worried that tonight, he just might cheat on me.  I don't seriously understand why I'm so insecure about this, but I just am. And I'm really worried. REALLY REALLY worried. Especially since I haven't talked to him since yesterday. For like, 5 minutes. And I asked him to read my blog before he left, so at least he'd know I was worried about him and I and such, but he didn't, apparently.  I don't know. I'm wondering if all these signs are pointing to that I should dump him? I dunno. I need to think about this...  ~Crystal

       Like the title states, it's just a morning entry. I used to do a bunch of these, used to be at like, seven o'clock in the morning, but I woke up a while back and just watched Saturday morning cartoons (FAVORITE PAST TIME!!! X33!) and then just got online.  I need breakfast. Bad. I just ate some tuna that tasted rancid.  I dunno. I'm home all weekend! Well, actually, I'm not sure about tommorrow. But I'm home today, and I'm looking for someone to hang with this afternoon, since Derek's gone and all.  I'll go see if David wants to. n.n; I haven't seen him since last year.  I dunno. I'll update later tonight.  ~Crystal  PS: Wow, my first entry that lasted only two minutes!

It's a true honest song. Chocolate rocks as a bandaid, 'cept it melts if you put it on a warm part of your skin...  I finally resolved stuff with Dere-chan. I'm so happy! I don't have to worry about anything anymore.  He also gave me some allergy medicine, so no more bothersome allergies! Although I just recently noticed that my Nexium disappeared. Technically, I was supposed to go to tha doctor to go to see her since it's been over a month since I last saw her and she said I was supposed to go back if I still had problems. I think all she was gonna do though was just give me a prescription for Nexium though T_T;  Eeh. No one's answering me on AIM! T_T *groans* I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate when this happens... it's like I'm not worth anyone's time.  I know I'm not, but still. T_T;  Eeh. I dunno. Shall look around for stuff to do...

       I ended up going to the shop and doing my math today. *sighs* Saw my sis, but other than that, I did nothing until dinner.  Dinner. Was. Interesting. !!!.  I swear. It was weird. I got a stomach ache about an hour before, and I told my mom "Can I just go home" and she said "No, it's okay, you'll be fine. Besides, you get to eat so much food!" and then I just looked at her and said "Mom... you're taking me to a buffet when I have a stomach ache." How much irony is in that sentence? You tell me.  Anyway... Dinner was with my cousin (Who happens to be mah math teacher at summer school!!!) and his parents and his wife and kid. His kid is SO kawaii. n.n; Her name is Ariel, I think. She's very guillible, but she's cute nonetheless.  Hmm... what else...  Ne. Ya know how I said I got into a fight with Dare last night? Well, I yelled at him again TWICE... and I realise now how much of a jerk I was to him . .; I suck as a girlfriend. But I'm hoping he'll come home and go online before he goes to sleep so I can apologise... but he's bowling. And usually by the time you're done, you get really tired, so... *sighs*  He and I will probably not see each other for the next few days.  Man... Fie-chan is such an awesome friend ;o;! *hugs* I mean, she's been listenin' to meh complain about Dare for about three days straight now...  I miss talking to Brittany now . .; Brittany be mah penpal from Minnesota, and I haven't been actually checking my e-mail for a while...  Oh yeah. I'm on Gaia again - Look for LabbehCrys n.n; If you see a girl with long black hair, a black shirt, blue flares, and who pounces on people a lot, check the username to see if it's me ^^;  I finally won the Master Rank Pokemon Contest in mah Pokemon Sapphire n.n I won with my Azurill, Azul. She rocks X33 She's SO cute! And it took me ages to make all those brown Pokeblocks, so I'm proud X3  Eeh. So yeah - that was my day. Foof. Dun have much else to say... so yeah.  ~Crystal

I don't wanna talk about it.  I'm home from summer school today. I woke up too late and my dad decided "Forget it, she has a key, she knows how to take care of herself, let her stay home!" and yeah. Well, at least that's what I think he said.  So yeah. *sighs again* I need to go repair things with Derek, and hopefully today won't be that bad.  Shall blog later tonight.  ~Crystal

       Eeh. I know I just updated, but yeh.  I've been looking at Alex's blog a lot. If you don't remember, here's a little bit on him - Alex was a guy I met last summer, 'bout this time around, and he was a British dude I met through FDD (Fictional Digimon and Digidestined). I promised him a bit of fanart which I never actually did :3; But he and I got along really well and I started havin' a bit of a crush on him... around September, he broke up with his girlfriend and we finally got "together". We didn't last though, we only lasted until about December.  But back to what I was saying! Arreksu and I are totally great pals now, and we talk about our problems like college peeps at the local Starbucks :3 And I've been checking his blog a lot, since I haven't been able to talk to him through Yahoo anymore.  I was looking at his pictures, and WOAH! All tha sudden I see mah face o_O I was realleh weirded out. Then I forgot that I sent him that picture XD; But I was pretty suprised that he put it up on his blog, for some reason.  And then I was looking around a bit more, and looking at a lot of tha piccies... he looked cute o.o Like someone who'd go to AHS and Scrubie would be drooling over XD; But it was interestin', to see mah old "koibito" for the first time in a while.  Now I've been thinkin' about going to England... I dunno. I wouldn't mind hanging out with Arreksu-chan. I mean, I personally would think it'd be cool - I love seeing new places, and it'd be fun seeing a guy I've known for about a year now for the first time in person. But mom would never let me unless she could find one of her friends' friends or something and let me stay there, I dunno.  I realleh think it'd be cool now, though, to go to England and hang out with Arreksu o.O I mean, my head would probably be up in the clouds like it always is, and I'd probably be jittery or something, but it'd be cool!  I dunno. *shrugs* Just my thoughts, as usual.  ~Crystal  PS: Oh, and Dare, if yew read this : I dun mean this as "I think Alex is more attractive than you" kind of way, I just think it'd be interesting to see him. Besides, there's no one more attractive than yew :3 Although, there are guys without that pregnant gut of yours... *starts giggling*

      flaneur \flah-NUR\, noun: One who strolls about aimlessly; a lounger; a loafer.   Go Doctor Dictionary. -.- Woot.  Dun mind mah sarcasm. And dun worry, I'm not in a bad mood n.n;  I haven't blogged for two days. It's a record!  Nya. Judy should be back in LA in about a week, yay!  Also another yay - last day of summer school is tommorrow :3 I actually didn't have to go, but I have no other stuff to do tommorrow, so I might as well :3  And yay! On Saturday meh (Labbeh :3 If anyone was wondering what my nickname was in tha group), the raccoon (Derek), the bunneh (Bo-chan aka Bobby) and the bat (Fie-chan, aka Lanie) are gonna go see tha movie :33 I wanna go see Little Black Book, but none of us can decide   And then Sunday is reserved for meh and Dere-chan :3 Or at least, I really hope Derek doesn't call it off. I realleh just wanna spend tha day with him :3  BTW, if anyone was wondering how meh and the Dare are doing...  Derek proposed that he wanted to break up with me on the 10th. The day that I yelled at him and was basically a jerk, if you guys remember. And a lot of the things he said hurt. After constant begging of wanting him back, him hanging up, and I crying at 12:30 midnight, I felt pretty bad.  But at about 5:30 in the morning, I woke up after having a nightmare. I kind of just walked around the house for about half an hour, thinking about all of it, but in the end I just grabbed Khodi and walked to his house.  Yeah, I know. I'm psychotic.  (It was nice though, I admit, to be walking when the sun was rising.)  But it paid off. After he woke up (It was 6:15/6:20 by then), we basically forgived and forgot - after about half an hour of just holding each other, and saying sorry, we knew that wasn't how it was supposed to be. (Or at least, that's what I think. Dunno about Dare) And basically I told him I was gonna change.  I know, I know. Please don't tell me "It's not worth it to change just for a guy!" because I know. But, it's not just me that's frustrated. I'm frustrated with myself a lot. And also I think it's not just that my friends are frustrated at Dare, it's the fact that I'm acting this way. I mean, yeah, it does still kind of have to do with Derek - him being the only one I ever talked to, saw, was slightly healthy around, etc - but it's just more about how I was acting. And I am really frustrated with how I am/was. I hate being depressed all of the time. And I hate being so dependant on people.  A lot of the things he said to me are true, actually. He said I was really dependant, and being depressed for stupid reasons, and I know. But that's why I wanna change. And... I am. I'm changing quite a bit. I'm a lot happier now, having a lot better thoughts. I'm taking care of myself a bit more, so I'll eat a bit more every now and then. And I'm not whining about Dare every single second of the day.  But the things he said are going to stick. I know it. I remember once that I was pretty depressed and wrote an entry in my blog, and Mel (remember her?) read it and basically ridiculed me down to the core. A lot of the things she said hurt, and I attempted to change the things that she ridiculed me for (Although, I didn't get much progress). But it's been almost two months since she did that, and I'm still slightly bothered by it. And what he said, the things he said, they're going to stick. And that's going to make me change even more. He may have slashed open a new wound, but I'm not just going to sit around and make that wound worse. I'm gonna change and mend it.  So yeah. Now after all of that, I'm back with Derek, and happy. Oddly enough, probably happier than ever, even after that whole... thing that I can't seem to find the right word to address it. I'm happier than ever and GLAD.  So yeh. There you have it. All of my life--I mean, of the last two days.  Well, I'll go now. I have... stuff to take care of? Not realleh. More like a dog who hates meh right now 'cause I'm taking so long to get off the computer and take her out. x.x;  ~Crystal

       Mmm. Curry. Gotta luff it. Just ate it for dinner.  Sorreh about that whole entry about Alex ^^; I guess it's kind of boring for mah readers, if there are any other than Lanie and Derek (only sometimes though).  Today was GREAT. Seriously. It was. If I had a vat of curry, that would make it all the better. Although, right after I finished that vat of curry, I guess I'd have to grab a heck of a lot of Tums and moan on my bed, wouldn't I?  I find it strange, how most of the time, a lot of people I know have good days on Friday the 13th. And I also find it excruciatingly amusing that Amih was born on Friday the 13th, except in October (She's four days older than me T_T)  But anyway. Today was the last day of summer school! And it was awesome :33 I kinda wish we got to play soccer or summat too, since I haven't played soccer for a while now, but it was great nonetheless (Besides, it was too hot). I got to drink soda and eat chips and play Pokemon all day :33 AND I caught Registeel, with major help from Billy. Billy actually isn't that bad (If Derek is reading this - to refresh your memory, he ish Hot Cheeto head. 'Cept he dyed it Magenta. So now he's GAY Hot Cheeto Head XD) but I did feel super awkward with him bein' in tha car with meh and Mr. Cheng (Mah cousin) and such. I also felt realleh awkward 'cause I guess know he knows I'm related to Mr. Cheng, since mah dad and him were arguing about tha payment for summer school. Although, that argument was extremely hilarious and totally amusing for me :3  Mah dad is also letting me stay home tommorrow, or so I think :3 I realleh hope so. I hope I can score Sunday too... nya :3 Meh and Derek's day!  Ooh! I also got to see Hellboy again, for the third time :33 Technically, I've seen it one and a half times (The half was 'cause I was watching it at Derek's and he super mega hyper uber glomped me so then we started wrestling and I forgot to watch it x.X) but still. I luff that movie to bits now! It makes meh want to go and pick up tha comic. But it ROCKS. Seriously. I love supernatural anything *-*  Nya :33 I feel so happy. I've been feelin' this way all day :3 And I'm totally glad.  Arg. Now mah computer's gettin' kinda slow, and mah ice in mah ice tea just melted - so I'm off to drink and be merry o.O;  ~Crystal

       countervail \kown-tur-VAYL\, transitive verb: 1. To act against with equal force, power, or effect; to counteract. 2. To compensate for; to offset; to furnish or serve as an equivalent to.    Nya. I knew that word. I knew yesterday's too, which I think was presentiment.  Although, I do like how valior sounds. It's the Latin root for "to be strong".  Anyway! Getting away from the dictionary nerd talk... I'm staying home today! So... now I'm just waitin' for Lanie to get on so I know where to meet up. I'm also hoping Bobby will be on, so he can come too. I don't know if Derek's realleh comin' or not, it depends on if he shows up before I leave. Which is noon.  I'm all sore... I think I might take a bath later today.  Nyaa.   ~Crystal

       Why do I feel like that's a song I've heard but I don't seem to remember? It floats in my mind like a melody weaving within a harmony...  Woo. Go Poetic me.  EYES! Arrg. My eyes. They HURT. Like sizzling oil at McDonalds carressing those friggin grease filled potatoes I love. My eyes HURT like that oil being poured all over them after they were stuck in the sockets. And yet I stay online.  And if my eyes didn't hurt as much, and if I wasn't so caught up in things, I'd be answering Alex's e-mail right now. Which I will, just RIGHT AFTER THIS. I promise. Just need to update.  Tommorrow, I'm going to the doctors... which is great, 'cause my stomach hates me and I need medicine ASAP. The only bad thing is that I'm gonna have to wake up at 8. In the morning. I'm... just SO not used to that. And it's 10:30 right now. Aaah, I can just think of myself falling asleep in tha shower now. And hitting my head against the shampoo bottle. Just marvelous. MAHVEHLOUHS.  Derek's getting a job at the shop, yay! He's working as a delivery boy, which means he'll probably get hit on as by girls who either think he's really spexy on that electric scooter of his (actually ours - my parents bought it) or guys who are gay and think he's spexy. Either way, he's mah spexy boy :3 This job rocks, for the both of us, 'cause:  -No more lonely boredom :3 -More shopping! (For some odd reason, I have issues shopping alone) -He'll get more money, so whenever I'm broke, Wallet won't :3 -We'll at least see each other a bit more than before  Nya. I find it odd though that I'm not really doing much at the shop. I'm actually doing a lot of boys work - I've been helping my dad with miscellaneous stuff that do with muscle, ie helping him fix tha table, change frames for portraits, carry tha flower arrangements to the car/owner's house etc.  Now... *ahem* I need to get to somethin' that's been on mah mind.  Alex.  Arreksu, no, this isn't something about yellin' at j00 or anythin'. It's just a lot of lard that's been on my mind.  I dunno why, but suddenly I just wish Alex could move into that one house about two houses up the street from mine. (It's actually for sale, too!) I dunno. I feel really close to him, and I think I have always... but lately I've been feeling like he's been one of my great friends. And I really wouldn't mind him being here in Cali. Although he'd have to put up with the extreme heat, the new place, most of the negative things about Alhambra...  But Alhambra IS a nice place. It's hard to realise it, because people continuesly look at the bad side. But if you're optimistic enough, it's very pretty. The parks are wonderful - small, but wonderful - and the SKY! Tha sky, always so pretty, especially at night. And I'm here :3 Well, that isn't THAT great, but nyaa.  Realleh though - I've been feeling extremely close to Arreksu, and I really wish I could just see him... just for a little while, I don't care if it's for just 15 minutes or so, but it'd be just so cool if I could. I consider Alex such a great friend these days, I know I could tell him anything...  But now half of me really does want to just break up with Derek and get with him. I mean, it's not out of pity out 'cause of the whole Loz thing, if you're wondering Aleh-chan. But it's really 'cause you are someone who realleh understands me and I would LOVE to be with you if it wasn't for that darn ocean x.X  But I also love Dare. x.x I love Dare with all my heart. I love the both of you, just as equally as the other, and both of you mean a lot to me. And ironically enough, you two are a lot alike in my eyes - you both can make me laugh and smile a lot, and you both have this great sense of humor, and you both are both spexy to the core ^_~ And you two both understand me. Not entirely, 'cause that's impossible, but you understand me enough. You understand me and know me really well... you could *almost* predict my every move and what I'd do in situations and such.  I really care about the both of you x.X I wish I could date the both of you darn it x.X But sadly, there's a thing called two-timing.  I don't know. I really don't. I care about the both of you a lot. I mean, it's not that I actually will break up with Derek or anything like that, FYI. I'm just saying... I wish you were here, Alex. And I wish you and I could be as close as we possibly could. 'Cause I'd love to see ya, and I'd love to just hang out with you... Ne. I dunno.  I dunno. I should end this now, since I have an e-mail to answer after this. So ja, my readers.  ~Crystal

       ARRRG!  I'm at Derek's house right now, tryin' to record... but everytime I try to, I mess up majorly T_T I swear. It's hard.  And now I just feel like I can't sing it. *sighs*  I wanna though. This song, I feel like I can sing it REALLY well. And I wanna know if my talent sucks right now or not T_T I've lost a lot of faith as a singer and I wanna see if I really do suck right now as bad as I think.  Nya. Yeah. What I'm tryin' to record is this song, I'm Still Here by The Goo Goo Dolls. It's an awesome song. Really, it is:  I am a question to the world Not an answer to be heard Or a moment That's held in your arms  And what do you think you'd ever say? I won't listen anyway You don't know me And I'll never be what you want me to be  And what Do you think you'd understand? I'm a boy, no, I'm a man You can't take me And throw me away  And how can you learn what's never shown? Yeah, you stand here on your own They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change? They're the ones they stay the same They don't know me 'Cause I'm not here  And you see the things they never see All you wanted-I could be Now you know me And I'm not afraid  And I want to tell you who I am Can you help me be a man? They can't break me As long as I know who I am  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can the world want me to change They're the ones they stay the same They can't see me But I'm still here  They can't tell me who to be 'Cause I'm not what they see Yeah, the world is still sleepin' while I keep on dreaming for me And their words are just whispers and lies that I'll never believe  And I want a moment to be real Want to touch things I don't feel Want to hold on and feel I belong And how can they say I'll never change? They're the ones they stay the same I'm the one now 'Cause I'm still here I'm the one 'Cause I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here I'm still here ~I'm Still Here by The Goo Goo Dolls  Hopefully, I can go home and maybe have this done. If not... I just won't record myself for a few years, 'cause this is like, my last chance to boost my self esteem about my vocals.  Yeah. Yar. Whatever.  ~Crystal

       Nya. This morning, all I'm doing is moaning.      So... good moaning.      *sigh* I'm only on to check mah e-mail for Alex's reply and to check my sister's blog. Which I haven't done yet.      I'll update later tonight... if I remember...      ~Crystal
