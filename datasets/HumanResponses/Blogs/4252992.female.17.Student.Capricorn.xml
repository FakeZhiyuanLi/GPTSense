         Haha To explain my title...Ping Pong is my rabbit lol We let him out to 'hop' around the house for a little while and I'm watching him.  It's pretty entertaining.  He slips and slides everywhere because we have hard wood floors.  He's crazy.  Jonathan Elliot won him for me at the fair by throwing a ping pong ball, hence his name, in a little bowl in a kid's pool.  lol It was very exciting.  But anyways...I think  I accidently just pushed the bold and italics on without me knowing it.    I have no idea how that happened.   Okay, back to normal.  That was weird. But anyways, I'm looking for Usher dates that he's going on tour.  I had the chance to go to the one in Ohio but I backed out.  I'm mad that I did, too.  He's not coming to KY either.  Oh well.  I found out Tim McGraw is coming back to town and my dad is going and I'm not.  That makes me mad also.  Oh well, I can't go that day anyway because I'm suppose to be going to the KY and Louisville football game with a friend of mine that goes to UK so that's okay.  I'm looking for other concerts I can go to in the next couple months but I haven't found any yet.  I'm going to a Casting Crowns concert in October.  They're a Christian band. It's a surprise for one of my friend's birthday so I'm excited about that.  But anyways, enough about my concert craze lol  Tonight I had to work, only 5-9 though.  I had the early shift.  After I got off I hung out at Subway with Doug E Fresh lol yeah I'm a loser I was spose to go with Luke and Whitney to Lincoln Co. at the Kentucky Depot or something like that but they had to leave before I got off so I had nothing to do.  I went and saw Riley at Kroger too  lol I was really bored and now I'm home bout to do some of my poems and find that stuff for the poem extreme (i changed it to that from that other big word because i have no idea how to spell it)  And then I have to work on my theme analysis also for Ms. Hager.  Dangit I swear everything I do over the weekend dealing with homework is for Ms. Hager. lol Is that a bad thing?  Maybe.  But anyways I'm going to get off here and go finish looking for tickets.  Cya!

       Weekend homework is crazy.  I'll probably find everything on that list Sunday night at 11:00.  Oh well, at least I'll have it.  Anyways, here in about an hour I have to do a monologue for Drama 2.  I'm kinda nervous but I'm ready to get it over with.  I'm doing Annie's opening scene singing "Maybe," the only problem is that I can't exactly sing. Oh well I just want to get it over with. I think I already wrote about that in an earlier entry but I don't remember.  I have to work tonight :( blah  I overslept this morning.  I left my house at like 7:45.  I wasn't late, though.  That was only because Ms. Hager wasn't in the classroom.  I guess it was my lucky day.  I'm going to try and not miss any days this year.  Not because I want to go to school but because I don't want to take any finals.  I don't know about having no tardies though.  That'll be a tough one to stick with.  I can't help it, I love to sleep.  The first home football game is tomorrow.  No surprise, but I don't get to go because I have to work.  It's like 3 hours away anyways so it's not that big of deal.  But next week is the first home one and I better be able to go.  Then the week after that is Harrodsburg.  I'll DEFIENTELY (I don't think I spelled that right) will be at that one.  We voted on a senior trip yesterday.  I voted for New York but then added Disney World.  I don't know if it's going to go through or not.  I hope so at least.  I would love to go to New York with all my buds from school. That would be awesome. Well, I don't know much else to talk about.  I guess that's enough for this entry. Until later...

						   I'm setting up this blog for my second period creative writing students.  I am hoping that they will fiind it interesting to keep personal thoughts, ideas, and writing considerations in this blog.  Likewise, we can post what we write and respond to each other's ideas.  Welcome and good luck blogging! Ms. H

						   OK gang, I've decided to give you some homework this weekend--and lots of it.  After all, that's what you would expect isn't it???  Seriously, I'm sending you on a scavenger hunt.  In order to complete some activities I have planned for a    P O  E  T  R  Y   E  X  T R A  V A G  A  N  Z       A    next week, I need you to have some materials ready.  Your assignment is this:  Each student in the class needs to find each of the following items.  The goal is to find the objects which will be used in class (so you shouldn’t need to have them in the same form to take back home), and not spend any money on them.  Look around the garbage can for the junk mail or a "stash-it-all" drawer for the postcards or letters, for example.  Items due in class on Monday and I will give you credit for all of your hard work.  Good luck and happy hunting!    Item list   One permanent ink marker (preferably some dark color) One t-shirt (white or light color) that fits you An old post-card (blank) An old post-card with message A very, very, very sharpened pencil At least four used postage stamps (at least 1” x 1”--the larger the better)—on the envelopes or off Ten pieces of junk mail An old magazine (school appropriate :) Some sort of blank book A piece of wood (no larger than 1’ x 1’ x 1”) An old calendar page (any month--bring extras if you find them) An old letter A map (can be local, national, world, etc.) A family recipe A shoebox to hold all of it (unless your piece of wood is too big--try to make it fit!)    Point #2 You should begin e-mailing me your drafts that you are beginning to finish.  Mail to:   urlLink lhager@mercer.k12.ky.us

						   Given that your goal is to write at least two entries a week into this blog, I think I'll set things up like this. Each week, I'll give you a prompt (for example, the one from yesterday) and for the other prompt, you will be invited to either post your own writing for people to read/respond to AND/or respond to a second prompt. We'll see how this works. Even though things can be read by anyone searching through the blog, I believe that keeping the response contained will make things run much more smoothly.  Thanks. Ms. H

						   I'm trying to figure out why some of you are on the blog and some aren't.  From what I can see, it looks like those of you who followed the email link are on and those who didn't aren't.  I will try to figure out how to fix this.  Meanwhile, could those of you who DIDN'T follow the link go back and try to follow it.  It might be that the system simply has to make the connection.  Try this and see what it does.  Thanks!

						   Trot right on over to  urlLink http://www.writersdigest.com/  to find loads of new writing prompts.  You can even sign up to have them emailed to you each month automatically.  Now what could be better than that :)

						   Hi all, See, this blogging thing isn't too hard after all! Even I can do it. I hope you've made your way around online and found this journal. My intention is for us to be able to keep it as a class journal much in the way we would do if we were keeping a written, bound journal. The way I understand it (yes, I'm still trying things out here), is that after I put your email in you have to "join." You should have received an email "invitation." Then, you are able to post to this blog.  I'd like to start out by setting up a first prompt for you to respond to: how do you perceive class going so far? I'm interested, particularly, in knowing how you are responding to some of the "freedoms" that writing workshop allows like being able to define your own writing tasks--things that you want/need to write about, etc. How do you feel about being given writing time in class rather than it all being given as homework? What would you like to see as a feature of your class??  The other thing I'd like some feedback on (and I'm going to be asking you in class about this, too) is what you might want our webzine (and print magazine) to look like. What should its title be? We have to start thinking about how we will invite other writers to join our little party, so it's going to be important to make some of these decisions soon.  I can't tell you how long I've waited to teach a creative writing class. I am really enjoying what you've done so far. You just have to promise to push me as hard as I push you (well, maybe not that hard :)  Post your thoughts! I think I'll stumble over to the blog for portfolio_princess and journal my thoughts for the day. . . Let me know if you set up an online blog for yourself (or if you already have one you want to keep working in). I'll have to make note of the URL. Ms. H

						   For this week, I'd like you to consider this question. What is the best piece of writing you have ever done? Describe it. In what particular genre did you write? Why do you consider it your best?
