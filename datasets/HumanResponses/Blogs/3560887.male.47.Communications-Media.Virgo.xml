      Recent discoveries in quantum physics (the study of the physics of sub-atomic particles) and in cosmology (the branch of astronomy and astrophysics that deals with the universe taken as a whole) shed new light on how mind interacts with matter.  These discoveries compel acceptance of the idea that there is far more than just one universe and that we constantly interact with many of these “hidden” universes." Quantum Dice   IMAGINE AN IDEAL DIE whose randomness is purely quantum. When you roll it, the die appears to land on a certain value at random. Quantum mechanics, however, predicts that it lands on all values at once. One way to reconcile these contradictory views is to conclude that the die lands on different values in different universes. In one sixth of the universes, it lands on 1; in one sixth, on 2, and so on. Trapped within one universe, we can perceive only a fraction of the full quantum reality.

      Web-phoning technology, known as Voice over IP (Voip) , converts phone conversations into packets of data to be transmitted down the same wires used to browse the net.  In the past they were limited to just calling other over the internet and, due to technical issues, could not dial a traditional phone number. That's all changed and opened pandoras box!.       I remember the times when you'd get back into the office and find the entire roll paper of you fax machine depleted and all because of junk messages to buy this or that!. Well things could get decidedly worse with the ever growing popularity of Voice over IP which is not regulated, so you could be targeted by marketing companies situated out side the national boundaries. Just like email spam that we have to dig through to find our real mail. Past experience has always suggested that free = junk!. But like any technology, there are also benefits as it will make communicating more affordable, provided you make the investment in the hardware to enable you to access the services. Calling some far flung banana republic is not going to cost you an arm an a leg like it did in the past!. It's sort of like, the line rental charge that one pays and the calls come for free. So, breaking it down. As this technology embraces the internet and it will no doubt change the way we communicate. Conference calls will no longer be the domain of just industry, but it will enable us to reach a wider group of like minded individuals. Some people just can't handle one call let alone join a group, that's not going to change. The availability of the technology will benefit those that that enjoy social interaction. As we accept the new ways, we will have to build in the security / privacy to ensure that spyware and adware don't detract from what essentially is progress. Here is a bunch of links to the major players and don't they have seductive names!.  http://www.skype.com/ http://www.ovum.com/ http://www.vonage.com/
