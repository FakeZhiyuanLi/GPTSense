      Wow! Two posts in two days! Never thought I would do that!  Well, I am planning on going to the library today, what an exciting life I lead! God, I don't even know why I am doing this, no one'll ever read it, and even if they did, they'd die of boredom... I spose I'm doing this because I made a new years resolution to keep a diary, and seeing as I hate writing, I decided to put it on the computer, then decided that it would be better on the internet, where everyone could marvel at my great diary-entering skills.   Anyway, back to the library; I plan on getting Money, By Martin Amis, His dark materials series, coz I figure anyone who is anyone has read those, so I spose if I want to be 'anyone' I should probable read them. Then there's the Strange incident that happened in the night time, by some guy who was in the review...they said it was good, so i spose it must be. *shrugs* No matter how hard I try not to conform, I'm still influenced by societys pop culture...woe is me!   Tomorrow it's school again...*yawn*. I have diagnosed myself with 'Chronic Boredom' due to the fact that, no matter how hard I try, nothing seems to interest me...I spose it's hard to explain...I do alot of musical stuff, play the violin and oboe, am a member of many groups and choirs, but I still seem to be bored...even going out with friends bores me...mabye I'm just a boring person...or everyone else is boring...   Ah, well, let's not dwell on the negative, but the partially positive! Music, of course, is one of my favourite things. Favourite bands include The Darkness, Coldplay, The Strokes, Metallica, Jet, Oasis, Rammstien etc...pretty much anything rock/alternative! I despise pop, except Robbie Williams, and...I must admit, I own Brittneys 1st album and 3 of her singles...But, I must also add, they were all given to me, I didn't buy a single one! Mabye I give off an aura of poppiness...urg!  I also enjoy listening to John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Pete Murray and The Whitlams.   Reigning champion of of round the table table tennis championships and one A of a double A battery!   Sorry, just had to add that!   One for me, one for my homies. Respect.

      Well, I now have my very own blog! Cool, ay?! If anybody actually reads this, you will see that I am a very random person. But don't worry, I'm not crazy! Em...just a little weird...;)   I live in Australia, a very nice place, it is, but also very hot! I'm 15, female, and enjoy watching Galic Football (international rules), but I'm not really sure why...anyway! I love all things funny, such as Ali G and Billy Connelly,   I am a bookworm, I love reading! Specially Harry Potter, so don't be surprised if I throw in a few things from HP along the way. But I'm not absolutely obsessed either...like those other freaks you see plastering HP all over the internet! ;) And all british comedy shows crack me up too...and Tony Blaire's accent...and, well, just about anything british...   You will also soon come to realise that a girl with broardband internet connection and too much time on her hands is not a good combination...muhahaha!!!   Some day I would like to take over the world, but thats on the back burner whilst I finish school...and i still havent' recuited enough henchmen yet...*note to self: make henchmen fliers*   Well...thats really all I have to say for now...    but I must add...cajun!

      Well, I decided it was time to update. I've been a wee bit slack...actually, very slack. But no-ones actually really reading this so its ok. Heh, as per ususal my life has been quite dull. I still have 'Chronic Boredom', as I told you in my last post, and have decided to post again in a vain attempt to relieve this. So far it hasn't worked, but I spose I should give it a bit more of a chance.   The little library venture I mentioned in my last post was unsucessful, as they had neither of the books I wanted, but I did get them on a more recent visit. Oh, how lame my existance is, reduced to talking about visits to the library. *sigh* Ah, well, I spose it should pick up. I am going on holiday in a week, for a week, on a houseboat. Bring on the continual rocking, I say, and the sunburn, partial sea sickness, etc etc. It should be good.   Shool. Ah, yes, where do I start. *yawn* 'Tis really quite boring. I tried to liven it up a bit, and stole some matches form the science labs. Funnily enough, I got caught, and nearly scored myself a detention, but wormed my way out of it by crying, appologising, and generally groveling on my hands and knees. Arg, how sad my life is.   I recently took a test to see how much of a freak I am. Apparently I am 37% pure freak. I was quite impressed, considering most of the questions went along the lines of 'Do you run around town wearing a cape?' I answered no to this, but I wouldn't mind trying it. Perhaps I'll visit the supermarket while I'm wearing the cape, and ask if they sell tinned blood.   I still haven't got very far with my taking-over-the-world palns, either. Only one of my friends seems to want to help, and that'll be in the hacking department, so I still need henchmen/minions. Perhaps I'll recuit over the internet, it's full of weird people. (err...no offence or anything)   Ah well, I shall update again soonish. Until then, 'Bon Appetite!'   Crisp *hand movement*

And we lost! Damn them! That edutacator didn't know what he was talking about. *looks superior*   Anyways. If you read this, please comment. You can even say "your life looks like a pile of poo~ from up here!" Just comment! ...Oh, wait, no one reads this, eh?   Anyway, allover, it has been dull. *Woah! Don't surprise me like that, Alison!* I have a geography test tomorrow, which I should be revising for, but who can be bothered? Its just geography. I'm to smart for my own good anyway. *swishes hair*   Any whoozle, i must dash. Good day, kind sirs and madams, and I hope you don't DIE! *winks*   ...moglemoglemogle...    ~censored incase one of those fuckin little kiddies readis it. The bastards.

      Well, Hi, again! My 5th post! wow! I'm impressed by myself.  Well, today I am very pissed off. I had many a plans to go to a Jet concert, (even though their music is now overplayed and mildly annoying, a concerts a concert!), but it got canceled! Arg! How bad's that! I am sooo pissed! It would have been great! Oh well, i spose now I'll just get a cool top with the money...but still!  Anyway, enough with the whinging! Nothing much has happened latly (surprise surprise!) But I am contemplating going to Space School. It's in the holidays, so thats a bit of a bum, but I still wouldn't mind going. May as well try, anyway! *looks positive, then rolls eyes at the thought of being positive*  Later.   And, remember, 'Fat Kids Shouldn't Stage Dive.' *nods*

      As you can see, I've changed my blog around a bit. I was sick of the old orange, and they updated the whole of Blogger! It looks cool, guys! Anyways, this is only a short post, because I just wanted to post this cool poem I found. 'Tis quite amusing.    As I strolled down along the quay  All in the lateness of the day,  I heard a lovely maiden say:  "Alack, for I can get no play."  A minstrel boy heard what she said  And straight he rushed to her aid,  But too much drink the task forbade,  And so the maid he could not lay.  Alack for I can get no play,  Oh woe is me and lackaday,  O chaste and pure I'll always stay,  Alack for I can get no play.  To mirror went she straightaway  And did her ruby hair array  And for her gown she much did pay  Though on her bod it should not stay.  Then down she walked along the street,  A handsome lad she chanced to meet,  And sore by dawn were her dainty feet,  But all the boys were gay.  Then cried she at the break of day  And hung her head in such dismay  To mourn the dearth of fine boo-tay  "Alack, for I can get no play."  Alack for I can get no play,  Oh woe is me and lackaday,  O chaste and pure I'll always stay,  Alack for I can get no play."    lol, I can't remember who it's by, sorry, so my compliments go to the author. (It's from a fic) I just thought it was amusing...alack! (And for all those smart asses who are laughing at me, because I have such a stupid poem in my blog, the jokes on you! Haha! I'm so hot, as if that poem would apply to me. 8-)  Anyway, life, as usual, is dull, thanks for asking. I am never ever having children. Ever. Work experience was fun, but thoroughly disturbing. Ick...We have a debate next week. Haha, I'm chairperson. muhaha! I doubt we'll win, but. Oh well. Must dash. Writing this has been absolutly spiffing. Taa raa!   There's a moon in my hat!

      Here comes another day when I dribble on about the dull shit that is my life. Recently I have done nothing but revise for my forsaken exams, and, as they are  finally  over, i can enjoy ranting and raving about shit all here. Oh the joy. Anyway, as I said, I have done nothing interesting as of late, but one funny moment did arise recently...well, actually, it didn't, come to think of it. Nothing funny's happened in a  long  time, due to various elements in my life. I have nothing to do this weekend, and nothing to look forward to, so I think I'll just end this post here, it's making reality hit me a bit too hard...ouch...

      That whole not-thinking thing didn't work at all. My mind is still a jumbled place, and I can't get rid of any of the shit that's there. I've been dreaming a bit lately, which is unusual fo me, so it's a sure sign that I have too much in my head; dreams are the brains way of shitting, getting rid of all the excess stuff that's hanging around. But I hate dreams. They're a fantasy, something that'll never happen, not real or certain. Just fluff. Bah...   I have no destination. I'm on a straight road, but I seem to be stuck; not moving in any direction. My life has no purpose. It feels like a filler; somewhere to be whilst waiting to move onto the next stage, and I'm stranded, in the same place, waiting for something, but I don't know what it is. I feel ignored, like 'they' forgot to give me something to look forward to, something to do while I'm here. I am. That's all. I don't do anything, I just be. I don't be anything in particular, just be.   I wish I could be somebody else, though,&nbsp;someone who wasn't ignored, someone who has a purpose. I just want to get out of this hole. I hate it, I hate this. I hate being nothing...&nbsp;  Someone said that I'm a rock; to my friends, to everyone. But who will be my rock? Who can I depend on. Who'll be there for  me ?  I want something, anything....but I have nothing.  I wish someone would help me pick myself up off the floor...

      Ok, so, I have come to the conclusion that I think waay too much. For example; I have recently been obsessing about this one particular subject, which I don't need to mention, and it has driven me so far up the wall that I am on the ceiling. And, contrary to popular belief, the ceiling is not a comfortable place; a bit to upside-down for my liking. So, anyway, I have decided to stop thinking. Full stop. It just does not work for me, and I don't like it at all. Goodbye thinking!  Another thing I'd like to mention is that it is holidays now, and, as usual, I am as bored as hell. Yup, oh soo bored! Holidays seem to do that to me, even though at the start of everyone I vow to make them interesting...Unfrotunatly this never works. So, I have come to another conclusion (yes, that's right, two in one night!) that I am not ment to have a stimulating life. I suffer from Chronic Boredom (diagnosed myself) and can not seem to get around this gay thing that is boredom. It shits me constantly. Everyone else has such fun, or at least interesting, lives, but mine is like a sack full of cocks. A cockhead of a life, thats it!   Meh, I spose I can get over it. I get over everything else (just as I am getting over the thing I mentioned above) and will get over this too. This, I suppose, will involve effort (poo) but I spose if it's what I must do, then I will.  What'll come will come and we have to meet it when it does...I spose...*sigh*   Can you  hear  my eyes rolling?

      Well, I am now 16 years old. Hmm, am I different? With another year on my life, have I grown up? Grown as a person? Am I wiser, deeper, different? Hmm...  There I go again, compulsively thinking, as only a great thinker like myself can do. I have to think all the time. What lesson do I have next? Do I have any maths homework? The teachers tell me to choose a career, what should I be? That last question has been on my mind  alot  lately, no thanks to my bloody teachers. Apparently, as I am in year 10 and still have 2 years of school left, I should decide what I going to be for the rest of my life now. Not later on, now. And what a bleak future it is looking to be. Not only do I have no idea what I want to do or be, but all of those speeches have made me even more confused than I was before, and I have also ruled out things I was considering because they sound so shit boring it's not funny and this is a run-on-sentance. Crap. I hate this...uncertainty. It's sooo god damn annoying. Yes, that career as a bum seems to be getting better and better. A hobo by day, and superwoman with super powers by night. Yeah, that's me.  At the moment I am in love with Snow Patrol. Blessed be the beautiful people who create beautiful music. None of that bashing, screaming crap for me, just beautiful music. I am listening to beautiful music right now, and am shivering at the thought of this beautiful music. I know, that is really quite weird, but I honestly do love it that much. So wonderful.  I need more books. I need to read more. If music is my oxygen, books are my water. I need both to survive. Perhaps I'll read books for a living. I'll be one of those old professors, with spectacles and a sharp wit, who reviews books for the benefit of others. That's me, always giving back to the community. Or, I could always just be a writer. Jesus, I'd love to be a writer. I love words, the way they can be arranged so subtly to mean such deep, wonderful things. God, I think I'm delousional, but that's seriously how I feel. When I read, the book reaches out and pulls me into it, enveloping me in it's words. I drink it all in, just like water.  Hmm...enough pondering for one night, I think. Perhaps another night, when I am not so intoxicated with the essence of literature, I will fill you in on a little bit of what's been happening in my life. Just a little bit...  ...A clock is ticking, somewhere...  P.S: Thanks to grindy for reviewing! *hug* ;)
