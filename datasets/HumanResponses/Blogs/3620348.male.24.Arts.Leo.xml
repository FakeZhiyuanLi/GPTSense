      Seems that there won't be a movie review today.  Mom sent the movie back to Netflix before I had a chance to watch it.  *sigh*  Oh well, I'll just rent it again.  See yinz later.

      It's early morning Monday and this week's news is off to a big head start.  Click links to view articles.  First,  urlLink Iraq becomes a soverign nation once again two days ahead of schedule.   I'm anxious to see how this pans out.  Will old powers revolt and take over again or will the new government root itself become strong and crush opposition?  Second,  urlLink new hostages held by Iraqi extremists.   Keep your eye on this one.  This seems to be a recurring series of events.  A hostage is taken.  Then video of the hostage pleading for his life surfaces and extremists give their demands.  A few days later, the hostage is dead and a video of the death is made available.  It happened three times already and it would appear that this is happening again, possibly with multiple hostages.  It's interesting how these types of news events occur at the beginning of the news week.

      ...the funnier it gets!  It's late right now and I'm winding down from a busy day of working in the yard and I keep thinking about Sheila.  Everytime I think about the entire situation, I laugh harder and harder.  This shit is classic.  I'm loving every minute of it.  This is, without a doubt the best prank ever played on me.

      ...and she asked me if I had changed my mind about painting her nude.  I said no.  she asked if I could draw her then or do it clothed.  I said perhaps.  Then she said that she wanted to do this for her 50-year old husband and that she would be wearing a pleather corcet hanging from a chain.  I'm fairly convinced now, as I had thought the first time, that someone's fucking with me.  I have an idea who it might be.  I think it's funny.  I want to see how far I can go with it.  Let's see if she calls me next week.  It would be very funny to carry this just as far as she can.

      Yeah, not much is going on.  I'm getting ready for a three-part movie review that I want to post here in the next few weeks.  The movies I'm reviewing are part of a documentary trilogy known as the Qatsi(Cot-see)Trilogy.  I received the first movie  Koyaanisqatsi  (coy-on-is-cot-see) from Netflix and I'll have that review in the next few days; probably Sunday.  I've been pinning business cards on the community bulletin board at work.  So far, I've posted about nine of them and two are still up there.  People are taking them, but except for that one call for a nude painting, I'm still waiting for that one freelance graphic design commission to get the ball rolling.  I've been going to the movies by myself, lately.  I've really enjoyed going by myself.  I really need some more alone time.  I am home most of the time with my family buzzing around me and sometimes I really want to get away from it all and just be by myself.  I went and saw  Dodgeball  today.  What a great movie.  Do yourselves a favor and see this movie!  Ben Stiller never fails to amaze me.  Each time he puts out a movie, I have the distinct feeling that the movie's going to suck.  When I see the movie, I never leave disappointed.  I had seen the trailers for  Dodgeball  months before the movie's release and I knew from the beginning that the premise was a hit.  I guess it's mostly because of the nostalia that we get from memories of dodgeball from grade school.  You were either prey for the red rubber ball, or you were among the elite who were tough enough to survive the onslaught.  I did fairly well.  I never got "out" very often.  I managed to catch the ball most of the time.  I hung onto that ball and I would use it to deflect shots.  When the time came, I would throw and hit the guy in the legs.  Aiming low was the what many kids never understood.  If you threw for the upper body, you're practically throwing it into their hands.  The most vivid memory of dodgeball was outlasting everyone else on my team until it was me and one other kid.  I wish I remembered who it was.  He had all three balls in his side of the court.  He threw one and I dodged left.  He threw the second one and I ducked, nearly getting it in the face.  The third one I caught right in the chest.  It was one of the few times that I, who usually got picked last, had saved the day and basked in the glory of his other peers for about a week.  I got picked first and the team I played for usually won.  However, the next week when we switched to floor hockey with those foam-padded hockey sticks (that looked more like brooms) I was shuffled to the end of the pecking order once again.  Kickball and dodgeball were my moments to shine.  After seeing  Dodgeball , the idea that there might be amateur or even professional leagues out there intrigued me enough to throw it into the Google search and see what I could find.  Dodgeball is making a comeback that not even I saw coming.  Take a look at these:   urlLink NADA - National Amateur Dodgeball Association   urlLink Dodge-It Dodgeball Centers   urlLink Dodgeballer.com - The First-Ever Dodgeball Community   urlLink ADF - American Dodgeball Federation   You can most likely find some sort of dodgeball program being thrown together in your own neighborhood.  There's a group of people that organize dodgeball games in Schenley Park (in Pittsburgh) every once in a while.  I want to see if I can get a bunch of guys together when I get back to Clarion to put together some sort of dodgeball club.  Perhaps take over a raquet ball court and throw together a small dodgeball game.  I've begun to have ideas of opening up a dodgeball center.  Have three or four courts, each 50-feet by 30-feet and hold games that abide by NADA rules, which are beginning to become standard.  Open it up to people who can come and rent a court and play against other teams that want to come out and have a good time.  I'm up in the air as to whether I want to allow head shots.  I think that it would be interesting to allow with the proper processing of a waiver that would not allow me to be held responsible for injuries if someone gets hit in the eye.  It would be awesome to hold tournaments or a league to play in a championship.  Open the place up to children as well as adults.  Co-ed and single-sex teams.  Tournaments.  League play.  It was be awesome.  The only problem would be trying to keep a place like that open if interest dies down.  Q-Zar, a laser tag business that had a local shop set up, closed down.  I can only assume that it was because of dying interest.  The place never had a large crowd anytime I went.  Come to think of it, they had waivers, too.  Q-Zar was a physically-intense activity.  I'm serious, though.  Open up a building with four indoor courts (open all-year).  Hardwood floors.  Hockey glass separating the spectators from the action.  Stadium seating.  Scoreboard.  Locker rooms/showers.  Ball rental/sales.  It would be freaking awesome.  It would be like a sports complex for dodgeball.  It would be freaking awesome.  There's no reason why dodgeball can't become a major sport.  Why does baseball, football, basketball and even hockey have to get all the legitimacy of a major sport?  Christ, curling, for godssake, became an Olympic friggin' sport!  I'm dreaming, though.  However, it's not impossible to join/create a team and have a little fun.  Search in your area for dodgeball organizations.  Hell, if you can't find one, create one.  I guarantee you that once you put out the call, people will flock.  Anyone for dodgeball?

      Dave Chappelle is a great comedian.  He's such a great comedian, that I'm sure you'll find 3 or 4 people that can name more than three movies he's been in without checking  urlLink IMDB (the three obvious would be  Robin Hood: Men in Tights ,  ConAir  and the highly overrated  Half Baked ...go ahead and try to name me one other without checking IMDB.  Off the top of my head, I can name at least three more.).  But honestly, he's such a great comedian that his sketch comedy show on Comedy Central was a sure failure if it weren't for one magical sketch; and that's the one where he impersonates Rick James.  However, in this episode of Chappelle's Show, it wasn't Dave that took the spotlight, but Eddie Murphy's brother, Charlie (a writer and actor for the show).  He told the story, in which he and Dave reinacted, about his adventures with Super Freak, Rick James (played by Chappelle).  Dave is now famous for the single line from this episode that not only saved his show from cancellation but will haunt him for the rest of his life:  the line, "I'm Rick James, bitch!"  Yeah, I thought it was funny when I saw the episode and the 50 or 60 times that Comedy Central has aired the show since(for lack of better programming, I guess.  Reno 911 is only funny up until the first commercial break.).  People everywhere I went were screaming the line.  I heard it across campus.  I heard it down the hall from where I lived.  I heard it in the food line of the cafeteria.  I saw it everywhere on the  urlLink Internet .  It's a great line.  I've even found myself shouting the line for no good reason. It's funny.    However, one man doesn't think so, anymore.  That man is, ironically, Dave Chappelle.  Apparently, Dave can't go on tour to colleges and whatnot without hearing people shout or chant "I'm Rick James, bitch!"  It's been a few months since his monumental, career-saving catch phrase and he can't take it anymore.  It's everywhere he goes.  He can't escape it's control.  During a recent show, he flipped his fucking lid:   urlLink Read for yourself .  I don't know what many other people think.  Some think that he's absolutely right for saying what he does.  Some don't.  I personally feel that he brought this onto himself and he needs to  DEAL WITH IT  fucking quickly or else he's going to be out of a job and pitching sitcom ideas to Fox *cough cough Bernie Mac cough cough*.  I don't think that Dave can personally handle being famous.  There are dozens of comedians, actors, singers, etc. who have to live with some line or phrase from a song or movie that their fans are going to be throwing at them everywhere they go.  However, some celebrities fail to see that it's shit like that that makes them the kind of celebrity that they are.  Eventually, they're going to flip out and someone gets beat up...or if you confronted Richard Simmons, slapped.  Personally, Chappelle's Show is not as funny as his stand-up act.  He came to Clarion University last spring and he was fucking awesome.  He was funnier than anything he's done on his show.  I think it's funny that he will only do shows (mostly at colleges, etc.) under the condition that he is not censored for anything that he says.  Clarion didn't give a shit because they wanted their CampusFest to be a success.  In closing, Dave needs to get a freakin' grip on this being a celebrity thing and he needs to do it quickly before he ends up on WB.

      I was sitting in my living room earlier this evening playing a video game with my little sister.  The phone rang.  Lately, she'd been getting more of the phone calls in the house because she has girlfriends calling almost everyday, so I didn't rush to pick it up.  So sis picked up the phone and it was for me.  She handed me the phone and there was this woman I have never spoken to before.    Woman:  Is this William?  Me:  Yes it is.  Woman:  Do you do nude portraits?    (Here, there was about ten seconds of stunned silence on my part.  I didn't know what to say.  How often does someone out of nowhere call someone and ask them if they do nude portraits?)    Me:  Excuse me?  Who is this?  Woman:  Sheila.  Me:  And what type of portrait were interested in?  Sheila:  Nude painting.    (There was, again, another ten seconds of, again, stunned silence.  It was about here that I thought "WAKE UP, STUPID, YOU'RE AN ARTIST!"  I had no idea what to say.  I was still trying to figure out how to respond to something like this.  I chickened out.)    Me:  I'm sorry, but I don't do those kinds of paintings.  Sheila:  Why not?  Me:  Personal preference.    (Now this was a fucking lie!  I would be more than happy to paint this woman naked.)    Sheila:  Do you know anyone that could?  Me:  No I don't.  Sheila:  Okay, thank you.  Me:  I'm sorry.  Goodbye.    (End call)   I continued playing the game with my sister and my thoughts were going everywhere.  Was this a joke? If so, it's a good one. If it was a joke, who was this person? If this was from a friend of mine, they're already dead and they don't know it yet. Why did I tell this woman 'no'? Did she get my information from my business card?  If so, then the bulletin board at work really does get some attention.  I have some valid reasons that I can't do this kind of thing.  It has nothing to do with the woman being nude; so let's drop the the "Bill's a chicken shit pussy" bit before I hack someone's face off with the claw end of a hammer.  My painting is not all that great.  I don't want to be pretentious, but people tell me my work is good, but I don't think that it is.  I am not convinced that I can deliver a portrait of someone in oils in a way that would it would truly represent the model.    I have taken a figure drawing classes and I've seen my work gradually get better. I can draw someone in charcoals and pastels and make it look like the model.  I feel confident in my drawing skills.  When it comes to painting, it takes a lot more skill and technique to get a convincing image.  I need more work to sharpen those skills.  I don't feel at this time that I can truly do anyone justice in an oil painting.  ...that, and I don't own an easel.  I don't want to paint and not be truly prepared for it.  I have paint most other supplies, I just don't have an easel.  I really would have loved to have done this.  I really would have.  Honestly.

      ...and it took me friggin' long enough to do it.  For years, I have been saying that I am not going to get a cell phone because I am never in a position where I have to take a phone call everywhere I go.  When I'm driving a car, I have no urge to get to a phone and call home or talk to my friends and bullshit.  When I'm in the middle of class, I have no urge to leave the class to take a phone call.  One of the most rude, inconsiderate and annoying things that I have ever witnessed was a cell phone that went off in the middle of a professor's lecture.  I remembered a cell phone going off in the middle of a visiting artist's lecture.  I wanted to strangle someone.  Clarion doesn't get many visiting artists or anyone famous for that matter very often.  When we do, there are a bunch of us who take advantage of this special treat and go and attend their lecture.  It would be nice to have some people turn off their phones out of respect to the guest and to save the university some embarrassment.  I'm digressing, but my point is that nothing in life was so urgent that I had to stop life where it was and take a phone call that pretty much amounts to someone wondering where they were or what they were doing at that moment.  Stupid bullshit.  Another reason for not getting a cell phone was because I had a telephone that had an answering machine on it.  Call me there and if I'm not home, leave a message and I'll call back.  Pretty simple.  I had no reason to take the phone with me everywhere I went.  For almost 70 years, humanity has been living with telephones that were connected to our houses by a cord or we used one of many public phones that are scattered all over the world to make our calls.  We have gotten along without that sense of urgency before and we can continue to due so.  The world has gotten itself in a damn hurry, to quote  Shawshank Redemption .  But THE largest reason why I have never gotten a cell phone was the one that would plague me from getting a lot of things that I would really like to enjoy: it was simply too expensive.  Many friends have heard me say that I won't get a cell phone until the price of the service makes cell phones cheaper than getting local/long distance service in my home from the local telephone company.    Well, that opportunity has arrived.  My mom found out that for an extra $10 a month, she can get a second cell phone added to her current plan AND that there was a free phone tossed into the promotion.  The free phone perked me right up and I became more interested in the idea.  If I helped my mom pay for the service, it WOULD be cheaper than local phone service.  My moment had arrived.  There were catches, however.  See, my mom's plan called for 400 Anytime minutes.  This means that every month there were nearly 6.5 hours of available airtime on the phone.  Add a second phone to the plan, and you have two phones sharing one allotment of minutes.  Mom said that this wasn't a problem because she doesn't use the phone a lot anyways, just in emergencies or when she needs to call home to see if there are groceries or something that needs to be picked up before she comes home from whatever she's doing.  The plan also includes free nights and weekends.  No big whoop.  The nicest part of this whole thing is that I am able to use this phone as my primary phone when I go back to Clarion and I won't have to get local service or even long distance(though, I think I might have to get local service for DSL internet if cable internet is not available in Clarion...which I need to do more research to be certain).  Overall, I am really happy with everything and I can now be one of a shitload of people carrying around one of these things.

      Just a few days after the 9/11 Commission concluded a study that stated that there was no direct connection with Iraq and the attacks on 9/11, the nation has to deal with another reality...   urlLink CNN.com - Al Qaeda militants kill American hostage - Jun 18, 2004   I found this on another site and I thought that it was a very strong statement that I'm going to share with you:   Whose hands are stained with the blood?  Who lied about weapons of mass destruction?  Who lied about Saddam and 9-11? Who lied about Iraq and Al Qaeda?  Who has been invading Arab nations using these lies and deception?  Who authorized the use of torture on often innocent Arabs, occasionally to the death, and forcing family members to watch?  Paul Johnson would be alive this very minute if Bush and the NeoCons  (neo-conservatives)  had not launched wars of conquest in the Mideast on fraudulent grounds.  Who is to blame for Paul Johnson's death?   George W. Bush.   Paul Wolfowitz.   Richard Perle.   Condoleeza Rice.   Donald Rumsfeld.   Colin Powell.   And everyone in the government and media who knew they were lying and dared not speak out.   Those are the hands stained with Paul Johnson's blood.     The 9/11 Commission had revealed what their studies and surveys found.  Basically there was no involvement between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks as Bush stated before invading Iraq last March.  Bush retorted stating that he never said that there was a connection between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks, but that there WAS a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida.  Well, apparently Bush has a pretty bad memory.  Read this (pay attention to the words in boldface):  ---  Presidential Letter  Text of a Letter from the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate     March 18, 2003    Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)   Consistent with section 3(b) of the  Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002  (Public Law 107-243), and based on information available to me, including that in the enclosed document, I determine that:   (1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic and other peaceful means alone will neither (A) adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq nor (B) likely lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq; and   (2) acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to  take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 .   Sincerely,   GEORGE W. BUSH  ---  If you want to see the letter for yourself,  urlLink click here and be amazed .  Bush DID say that there was a connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of 9/11.  This letter provides proof.  He used his accusations to invade Iraq.  Bush now has changed his story to reflect that he NEVER said that Saddam had connections to the attacks on 9/11 but he had connections to al-Qaida...   urlLink Click here to read it for yourself .  I reiterate what I said in my post from yesterday...it's time for a new leader.

       urlLink American Civil Liberties Union : USA PATRIOT Act   I've been sitting on this webpage for a few days and decided I was going to post it.  After reading it, it all became clear about what the USA PATRIOT Act is and what it does.  I urge everyone to read this page and become familiar with the USA PATRIOT Act and understand that the government can get into your personal and private information and NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU A DAMN THING ABOUT DOING IT.  Medical records, school records, criminal records, anything about you that is in a computer database or otherwise on record somewhere is now accessible for the government to sift through and there ain't a damn thing you can do to stop it.  You can be jailed and incarcerated without DUE PROCESS OF LAW, which is a  urlLink CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARDED PROVISION BY THE 14TH AMENDMENT .  Provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (USPA) also allow surveillance without court order.  Why?  Why would the government exercise this kind of invasion of privacy?  They will tell you that it is for security reasons.  They want to stop  potential  terrorists (God, I hate the usage of that word in post-9/11 America.) from doing something they haven't done yet.  On the very surface, this would seem like a justified reason for having such an Act in place.    However, little to people know that this Act was passed though Congress without as much as a single debate.  This is because virtually no one in Congress had read the bill before its emergency overnight passage and publication.  Who are we or anybody else to judge people for things that have not yet come to pass?  Innocent people all across the nation have been wrongfully accused of crimes of terror that have not happened.  Our government then will step up and say that they have thwarted another terrorist attack.  Innocent people who are banned from boarding airplanes trying to get to home to their families locally or abroad because they have the same ethnic and religious backgrounds as those who crashed planes into skyscrapers (Bear in mind these are the few cases that see the light of the day.  Another provision of the USPA Act:  they don't have to announce to anyone of anything until criminal charges have already been made.  So before the public knows what happened to you, you already have a blemish on your criminal record.).  The FAA has a blacklist of people all over the country who have been banned from flying.  The FBI, the FAA, and every other government agency and the airliners who this list is shared with ARE NOT OBLIGATED ACCORDING TO THE USPA to share this list AND how these people ended up on the list.  These are things that are hardly worth taking into consideration when profiling terrorists (Keep in mind that it was a Caucasian male AND A NATURAL BORN AMERICAN CITIZEN who blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in 1995).  While Georgie is preparing for his un-election, he's desperately trying to get the USPA made into permanent law (now it's only temporary) and that he's working additions to the USPA (Dubbed "Patriot 2"...woulda thought?).  I'm not going to promote Michael Moore's new movie,  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  , but I'm going to see it.  I have never followed politics more closely in my entire life.  To me, this next election holds in the balance the next four years of my life and to me they are pretty important ones to me because I am graduating college.  I'm going to be entering the work force with a college degree and I would like to see an improved America and a better economy when I go.  I would urge everyone who is of voting age to go vote.  Bush has given every voting American every single reason(i.e. The last for years of American history) to vote.  Please go to the polls and stay current in national news.  It's time for a new leader.     Ronald Reagan Trivia    Ronald Reagan is still dead.  I'm kidding.  Actually, Reagan had a photographic memory that helped him a lot in school and in his acting career.  How ironic is it that he died with Alzheimer's Disease?  I would also like to point out that Reagan ran up the budget deficit and sent troops to die for pointless reasons.  I guess history does repeat itself.  I would laugh my ass off if the world revere's GW the same as Reagan when he dies.    Todays' Quote    "Those who are ready to give up some of their freedom in return for some security deserve neither security nor freedom". -Thomas Jefferson

      Some are so fantastic that you'll often wonder if it really happened.  Other times, they are so outlandish that one couldn't make this shit up.  For me, this story sits on that fine line in between.  Part of me wants to say that this story is complete bullshit and that no one could possibly pull this off.  Then again, we are dealing with Wal-Mart.  As we all know, anything is possible at Wal-Mart.   urlLink The Wal-Mart Prank   Let me set you up for this one.

      I've been watching a small web series that's been around for over a year now called  Red vs. Blue  ( RVB ).  The show takes place between the time that Halo, the X-Box video game, ends and before the sequel begins.  In that time there is a civil war among humans and that is where this show begins.  It's filmed using recordings from Halo's mulitplayer game.  The camera is actually the point-of-view of a character that you don't see.  When you add your own home-brewed dialog, it's actually a brilliant idea for your own Halo-based short movie(and you don't have to do any CGI yourself).  The show begins on an outpost on the original Halo world known as Blood Gulch and carries you through the misadventures of two armies, one red and one blue, as they figure out a way to destroy the other army...without actually fighting, one might soon find out.  The first season of  RVB  was really funny.  The idea was fresh and the dialog was great.  Some shows left you in cliffhangers wanting to go right into the next episode, but you'd have to wait a week for the next one.  And when they didn't, they left you with a good feeling inside.  It was awesome.  It was worth the watch.  The show is now currently in the second season...and I have to say that I am fairly disappointed.  They have inside jokes that aren't funny, plots that seem to go nowhere and the introduction/continuing of characters that are empty and uninteresting.  The folks at Rooster Teeth (the developers of this short) are slipping and they are slipping badly.  They are 16 episodes into the second season, neither army has even begun to destroy the other army, the jokes aren't funny, the dialog is flat, the characters are boring, and they are still stuck at Blood Gulch.  I would have figured that they would have changed locations for a little bit of a pace change.  Instead it seems like a continuation of season one.  To the folks at Rooster Teeth, your show is not funny anymore.  The flair is gone and the shark is ready for jumping.  I would  LOVE  to hear some comments from anyone with comments on this.  I would like to know if I am not the only one who thinks this.  Check it out for yourself,  urlLink  Red vs. Blue  .

      Everyone who followed the link from my AIM profile, you would already know me.  To blogger.com bloggers, my name is Bill.  I'm from Pittsburgh, PA, and I'm currently a student at Clarion University of Pennsylvania.  I'm studying art concentrating in graphic design.  I'm also taking up figure drawing and painting on the side.  I have found blogging to be increasingly interesting the further I got into the habit.  I have a blog at  urlLink http://waywardspirit.crimsonblog.com .  If you want to catch up on my life up to now, you can go there and read my past entries.  Blogging for me isn't just a way for me to stay in touch with friends over long distances.  It definately is a way for me to be able to relieve frustrations, cleanse the mind and also is an outlet for me to tell a good story.  I love comedy and movies, so you'll probably hear me talk about a movie or tell a funny anecdote (and very sarcastically).  I really don't know what else to say at the moment.  I have my graphic design portfolio online if you want to take a look.   urlLink Click here .

        ...not really doing anything important aside from *sic* work.  I decided that I wanted to create my business card.  I had whipped up a quick design and was mildly pleased.  It had white and yellow text on an orange field to match my website   urlLink (shameles self-promotion)  .  After I had printed out a few on some really nice photo-quality paper (I don't have any business card stock and I didn't want to pay to have 250 of these things printed up because I don't want to pay to have a bazillion of these things printed up until I have my own permanent personal domain up and running.), the orange didn't come out as saturated as I would have liked so the white and yellow text blend in.  With the help of the drop shadow I added to the text, it's now readable, but still not forgiving on the eyes.  So, I went back to work and I changed the orange to green.  Click to enlarge.     urlLink        In other happenings, I was trying to think of interesting things to do with this journal.  It's nice to tell people what's been going on in my life, but let's be frank, it's summertime and life is pretty boring at this time of year.  I work, shit and sleep, and occasionally I'll eat.  Life slows to a crawl.  So, I'm going to steal an idea I got from my buddy, Mick.  I'm going to write movie reviews and post them here.  I am not trying to be pretentious but I'm gonna do my best.  So here goes...       Bill's Movie Review        Today:        The Guru       This little gem released in 2002, starring Jimi Mistry, Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei tells the story about a young man named Ramu Gupta (Mistry) coming to New York City from India to find his American dream: fame and fortune as an actor and a dancer (being influenced at a young age by John Travolta and  Grease ).  His first attempt turns sour when his first acting gig mistakenly lands him on the set of an adult film.  Being unable to get aroused because of shyness, his costar, Sharonna (Graham), helps him get in touch with his sexual inner being.     His first attempt being a failure, he finds work in an Indian restaurant with his roommates.  While catering to a party of socialites, a hired swami who was supposed to give a reading and give spiritual advise passes out from drunkenness and in a hurry, Ramu's roommates send him out to be the swami on-the-fly.  Not sure what to do, he dispenses the advice given to him by Sharonna.  Becoming a hit with the party, socialite Lexi (Tomei), uses her connections to get Ramu on the path to stardom, as a sexual guru.     Infomercials, talk show appearances, even a show on Broadway pulls Ramu up into the annals of stardom.  He continues to take sex lessons from Sharonna to keep the flow of material for his act coming.     I found this movie to be one of many overlooked comedies.  It took me two years to get to getting around seeing it.  I guess this is what happens when movies come and go so fast that you forget they ever existed.  I'm glad that I ran across this movie.       Subtle jokes and the hilarious antics of Ramu's roommates, who include Ajay Naidu (Samir in  Office Space ) keep you smiling through the whole movie.  This movie takes full advantage of spoofing Indian Bollywood movies with their large and flashy song and dance numbers.  They even perform a Bollywood version of  Grease  which got me howling.  And probably the most humorous part of whole movie is the mixture of spirituality and sexuality set to a Bollywood version of the Macarena and the millions of people who buy into the whole mess.     It kinda bothered me that Heather Graham was playing another porn actress, yet  I was quickly able to forgive this because 1) she played a big role in this movie, 2) the adult film scenes were tastefully done because 3) Graham's body was not the focus of her role.     This movie also has appearances by Michael McKean as Dwain, the adult film director, and Christine Baranski as, Chantal, Lexi's mother.   I give this movie a 4.5 out of 5.

Poor, poor Lenny.  What will he ever do if I didn't hang out my diry laundry out for him to read?  Well, I decided that I'm going to start a new blog here regardless if the other blog comes back online or not.  I think this is a lot nicer than the other blog I had and other blogs I've seen.  So here's to my new blog.

      I went to the movies tonight with a friend of mine and nothing really sparked my attention.&nbsp; King Arthur looked good.&nbsp; I think it would have been interesting to see how they butchered the legend all to hell in this 'gem' but we decided on this independent film from Fox Searchlight (the guys who introduced the world to  Super Troopers ).&nbsp; Indy films can be some of the best films ever.&nbsp; Without the financial backing and glamour big name studios to give these movies much of a shot, indy films rely on savory dialogue and truly imaginative&nbsp;stories to make them successful.&nbsp;  Napoleon Dynamite  has all of that.   Synopsis:   Napoleon Dynamite (yes, that's his name), an uberdork living seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Idaho.&nbsp; He lives with his loser 32-year old brother, Kip and his Grandma.&nbsp; Napoleon thinks he's cool and has lots of skills, but is really a loser&nbsp;but doesn't realize it.&nbsp; Kip's just as much of a dork as Napoleon, spending much of his unemployed days chatting with babes looking for his soulmate.&nbsp; Grandma is injured early in the film ATVing in the sanddunes of Idaho and injures herself placing her in the hospital.&nbsp; Enter Uncle Rico, former high school football star who still lives the past days of would-be glory (1982) had he been placed in the final minutes of the game to bring them the state championship.&nbsp; He comes in to take care of the family while Grandma is in the hospital.   The movie goes along the normal days of Napoleon Dynamite.&nbsp; Eating bad food in the cafeteria, playing tetherball by himself in gym class, getting beat up and shoved into lockers in the hallway at school.&nbsp; But in Napoleon's mind, he's the coolest guy around.&nbsp; Pedro is a new student, moved to Idaho from Mexico and quickly befriends Napoleon.&nbsp; Then the movie's plot is started when Pedro decides to run for school President with the help of Napoleon.&nbsp; Along the way, we run into Deb, a female uberdork, who begins to set her sights on Napoleon.   Alright, before I saw this movie, I thought that this movie was lame as all hell.&nbsp; It felt so lame that it made me want to see it even more because, hell, let's face it, there has to be more to this movie than the life of a nerd.&nbsp; I was not sorry at all for seeing this movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, actually there wasn't much more&nbsp;to this movie because really it is just about the life of Napoleon and the little things that he does (I've never laughed so hard at watching a guy crack his nuts off of a bike's crossbar while trying to jump a homemade ramp).&nbsp; But the funniest parts of this movie are funny because of the little nuances that set it all up: the timing, the delivery, just looking at Napoleon's clothing (moonboots?) will set you&nbsp;up for gut-wrenching laughter.&nbsp; Well, as the movie goes on, we dip deeper and deeper into the loser that is Napoleon Dynomite until we are introduced to Napoleon's hidden 'real'&nbsp;skill that turns him into a star.   I think what really makes this movie so successful is the connection people have to Napoleon.&nbsp; He's a super dork that everyone can relate to.&nbsp; Either they were one themselves, still are, or even knew people that were like this.&nbsp; I can totally relate.&nbsp; You will love the guy and&nbsp;feel pity for him both at the same time.   This movie is a must-see and is definately going to show up on my DVD collection in a few months.&nbsp; I'm going to try to talk my other buddy into going to see it because we both are comedy buffs and we've never wronged each other on funny movies.&nbsp;  Napoleon Dynamite  is an instant laugh-a-minute cult classic that deserves a 5 out of 5 stars...a rarity for movies these days.

       Hello once again, folks, Bill here to bring you his latest movie review.   Tonight, I would like to finally bring a close to the 'Qatsi' trilogy.&nbsp; For those who haven't been following along, the 'Qatsi' trilogy is brought to you by Godfrey Reggio over the course of the last twenty years.&nbsp; Using a unique form of cinematography, all three movies are brought to the viewer completely without dialogue set to a beautiful score all done by Philip Glass.&nbsp; All three movies are designed to drive home to the viewer the idea that modernization and technology have driven a spike between humanity and nature and that technology has ruined our bond with the rest of the Earth.    Koyaanisqatsi  introduces us to this idea on a very broad scale.&nbsp;  Powaqqatsi  shows us what happens to other (primarily third-world) cultures when we force technology and modernization upon them.&nbsp;  Naqoyqatsi  takes us to a dismal place where we see technology bringing us to a state of war never imagined before the 20th century.    Naqoyqatsi  is another Hopi word meaning 'civilized violence', or 'war as a way of life'.&nbsp; This is not the typical battlefield war that it's speaking of, but the war of everyday life.&nbsp; We are bombarded by a slew of images that have been doctored and manipulated to show people in ways that aren't normally seen, interestingly enough, using the same technology that Reggio aludes is breaking humanity from it's natural beginnings.   This film is very different than the first two because of it's use of special effects, solarization, 2D/3D effects, vector graphics all used to bring us those images.&nbsp; It is also a very different movie where the mood is very dark.&nbsp; The special effects and the symbols used bring us dark and depressing images of the world in which we live.&nbsp; Images of nuclear explosions, rockets being shot off into space, bomb blasts all resonnate how technology used to carry on the advancement of humanity, also is being used to destroy it.   But I didn't like this movie at all.&nbsp; If I liked this movie for one reason, it would be Philip Glass's soundtrack.&nbsp; It's great relaxation music, though it will speed up and get tense at parts, it's still great music.&nbsp; Reggio's images are uninteresting if not outright confusing.&nbsp; His points&nbsp;are often hard to grasp and scenes are thrown together without the order and transitions that the other two films had.   Another problem I have seen is that this movie sets out to show us that humanity uses technology to destroy one another, but doesn't do anything to show us what technology is doing to aide humanity (i.e. medicine curing diseases).   This movie gets 2 out of 5 stars.     In other&nbsp;events, I've dug up an article from&nbsp;Clarion's local news paper and I found an old article...about a month old, that&nbsp;eight illegal aliens from Mexico were arrested in Clarion working for a drywall company that&nbsp;was putting up drywall&nbsp;at Reinhard Villages.   They were eating at Taco Bell and a local cop, having lunch, struck up a conversation with them.&nbsp; When he asked where they were from, everyone stopped talking.&nbsp; He thought this was unusual behavior and did a plate check on their van.&nbsp; He found out that the plate didn't belong to that vehicle, and further investigation dug up that these guys were working in the country illegally for a dry wall company that was doing work on Reinhard Villages.&nbsp; I thought that was funny as hell.   Reinhard Villages: overpriced and built by hard-working illegal immigrants.

       The end of July is dawning and in the final month remaining of my Summer break, I've got to begin to make arrangements for returning to school.&nbsp; With the last few weeks of my Summer slowly coming upon me, I don't think that I can be happier that they are coming.   Summer so far has been a total bore.&nbsp; I've gone no where and I've done almost nothing.&nbsp; I should be grateful for such things but I just want to go back to school where I know everybody and there is never anything to not do.&nbsp; Despite what people say about Clarion, I have never found nothing to do there.&nbsp;   This coming year is going to be an activity-filled year for me.&nbsp; I've got a job lined up at PAGES, the university's publication/duplication department.&nbsp; I'm going to finally get some real-world experience in the delightful world of graphic design.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think I can be an more excited and scared at the same time.&nbsp; It's one thing to&nbsp;create a design or a poster or a logo for a friend or for homework, but to actually do something that's going to be truly seen will be remarkable.&nbsp; I'm also hoping that I can get another job during the year as a lab assistant in the multimedia lab, freshly stocked with new computers and other equipment.&nbsp; I can't to get my hands dirty with these new machines.&nbsp; Among other things to look forward to, renovation of the snack bar will be complete and I will be able to eat in a facility where it won't take 40 minutes to grab a hamburger and eat it.&nbsp; I will miss walking around the crowded snack bar and mistakenly brush up against buxom girls, though.&nbsp; I'm sure they'll miss it, too.   I'm also looking forward to being active with the folks in the German Club.&nbsp; I enjoyed being with the German Club last year with going to Cleveland and spending the university's money on a nice hotel and expensive restaurants.&nbsp; We hope to do it again this year with a trip to Washington D.C. by visiting the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and also a trip to Pittsburgh to visit the symphony&nbsp;to hear some German composers.&nbsp; Ever since the German Club in high school, I don't think I've ever had so much fun with an organization or learning a second language for that matter.   This final year is definitely going to break the mold.     I went to Clarion's website today to look up a professor's e-mail address and I stumbled across a news article for projects planned for the university over the next few years.&nbsp; I read there that another residence hall's going to bite the dust.&nbsp; Well, they aren't going to knock it down like they are to Campbell Hall where I lived for two years as an  urlLink RA , but they are going to turn this particular hall into offices, kinda proving my point that Clarion is slowly, building by building, eradicating their residence halls.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Beats me.&nbsp; On-campus housing makes up almost half of the total costs (tuition, room/board, etc.)&nbsp;that they receive from approximately 2,000 students.&nbsp; Why stop that flow from coming into a university already having budget problems?&nbsp; With the price tag from Reinhard Villages being as high as it is, no one is going to want to live there.&nbsp; It's going to drive more and more students into living off-campus.   I also saw that the university is putting into effect the beginning stages into renovating Marwick-Boyd (the arts building).&nbsp; Their main reason is that the building is grossly inaccessible to handicapped students.&nbsp; It's funny that I found this article because a few days ago, I was remarking to myself that a wheel-chair bound student can't get to the little theatre or to any of the classrooms in that side of the building (which is also the side of the building that houses the theatre and the speech communications majors).&nbsp; It's surrounded on all sides by stairs and no ramps or elevators.&nbsp; The building is getting its upgrade to supplicate those with disabilities.   It's also getting it's face lift to finally, FINALLY, bring the rest of the art department together under one roof.&nbsp; M-B houses&nbsp;most&nbsp;of their art studios (painting, drawing, GD, printmaking and it's lecture classrooms) except&nbsp;color and design, 3-D design, fabric&nbsp;and surface design, weaving (that's no joke, we have classes in weaving) which are all contained in the BASEMENT of Founders Hall.&nbsp; Ceramics and sculpture has their own buildings behind Founders Hall.&nbsp; They're going to consolidate the art studios to get them under one roof&nbsp;so that the art department can also get accredited.&nbsp; They tried last year, but&nbsp;didn't pass&nbsp;because the department was too scattered across campus (and also, I believe, because some of the studios weren't properly ventilated...which is okay because I liked breathing the fumes emanating from the printmaking studio).   These things won't be ready by the time&nbsp;I graduate, thank god, but it's nice to finally see that the art department is getting attention that it deserves from the power that be at the university.     Every once in a while, I like to throw my faithful readers a link or two into the wonderful world that the internet has to offer.&nbsp; Today, I have a link&nbsp;to&nbsp;the site of a company who&nbsp;hasn't developed a cure for deadly diseases&nbsp;or has created a new dietary&nbsp;staple made of plankton that's going to help&nbsp;eradicate the world's starvation problems or even&nbsp;a&nbsp;new pollution-free fuel source that's&nbsp;10 times more efficient than any petrol-based fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it's not something that doesn't totally lend itself to the development of Mankind.&nbsp; Let me introduce you to&nbsp;  urlLink  LiTraCon   .&nbsp; LiTraCon is a company that had made an interesting breakthrough in the world of architecture and art.&nbsp; They have developed translucent concrete.&nbsp; That's right, concrete that allows light to travel through it.   It's really neat.&nbsp; They have taken normal concrete and have glass fibers embedded in it.&nbsp; When light hits it from one side, the light travels through the glass fibers to the other side.&nbsp; So say you were in a room where there the walls or a ceiling were made of this stuff and it was a nice sunny day outside, the room would be lit by the ambient light created by the translucent concrete.   I thought that this was a really cool invention, but the more and more I thought about it, it would serve no real function accept for aesthetic purposes of the building or area that it's located.&nbsp; I could see a museum or perhaps a church utilizing the stuff.&nbsp; Museums and churches LOVE light.&nbsp; Lobbies of large office buildings do, too.&nbsp; These are the kinds of places where you have large open spaces and tons of skylights and huge windows.   I had thought of another use for these things and I thought that it was an original idea until I had seen the pictures, but I thought about how cool it would be to make sidewalks out of this stuff.&nbsp; One could make huge slabs of the translucent concrete and install them on top of lights inserted into the ground and you could have an illuminated sidewalk.&nbsp; I suddenly thought of the  Billie Jean  video Michael Jackson did in the early 80s and thought it would be brilliant.&nbsp; There could be sensors that, when a person steps on them, to turn the light on under the concrete and, presto, you've got a sidewalk that lights up just for you.   Check out the website and see pictures of this stuff in action.&nbsp; It's really neat (almost as neat as&nbsp;a science exhibition using   urlLink  plastic-hardened human corpses   ).

       I finally got around to reviewing the second in a trilogy of movies created by Godfrey Reggio&nbsp;known as  The Qatsi Trilogy .&nbsp;  Powaqqatsi  is a word from the Hopi language meaning "a being that overtakes the life of another being so that it may move on with its own life".  &nbsp;  The movie like the first movie,  urlLink  Koyaanisqatsi  , is completely without dialogue but moves with a sensual, transient score done by Philip Glass.&nbsp; With better cinematic footage and a better score, Reggio hardly acheives the success of his first title.  &nbsp;  This movie attempts to take you through the third-world countries in an attempt to give the viewer a sense of what human endeavor and acheivement has done to the rest of humanity that has been left behind.   At the beginning of the movie we see footage of societies in Africa and Eastern and Southern Asia.&nbsp; They go about their lives full of toil and back-breaking work.&nbsp; Then as the movie advances, we are then shown footage of what these people go through when technology comes and moves its way in and interrupts the lives of these people.&nbsp; Then at the end of the movie, we see the end result of what happens when modernization had come and staked its claim on the peoples living there:&nbsp; pretty much we have the same people that we saw at the beginning of the movie working and toiling away but with the urban hustle and bustle going on all around them.  &nbsp;  I can't help but feel that Reggio didn't succeed very well at getting his point across.&nbsp; We see people who work endlessly to acheive their means of living and survival, they smile and still find time to have a little bit of enjoyment in their lives.&nbsp; They live their lives content and&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't feel&nbsp;that they have been put down by the modernization that has come into their lives.&nbsp; We see people who ignore the modernization of their people and country and are only concerned with the life that they lead and nothing else matters.&nbsp; What Godfrey has tried to do is to make the modernized people (you and me) see what&nbsp;our cultures have done&nbsp;to these people but instead has&nbsp;shown us&nbsp;they are living through&nbsp;it as happily as they can.&nbsp; These people don't feel brought down.&nbsp; I never had that sense of dread, watching this movie, that modernization is ruining civilizations.&nbsp; I felt like I was watching&nbsp;a Discovery Channel or a National Geographic&nbsp;documentary about SE Asia or&nbsp;Central Africa, muted, while listening to Pure Moods.  &nbsp;  I will give Reggio a hand for capturing some really great footage and getting deep into the cultures of third-world nations.&nbsp; Glass's score was beautiful and relaxing and even made me want to take a nap because it was that peaceful.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I give this movie a three out of five.     &nbsp;       Coming next:&nbsp;  Naqoyqatsi , the&nbsp;final movie in&nbsp;the  Qatsi Trilogy .&nbsp;&nbsp;A word from&nbsp;the Hopi language meaning&nbsp;"life&nbsp;as war".&nbsp; I'm excited about this one.&nbsp; From the sounds of it, this movie will carry us through a montage of images to the tune of another Phil Glass score into how technology is changing the face of the Earth through violence.

       Well, it's not really like that.&nbsp; I got my birthday present a month early today.&nbsp; I mentioned to my dad a few months ago that I was interested in buying myself an external hard drive that connects to my computer through USB.&nbsp; I was interested in one of these because I thought it would be a whole helluva lot more cost effective than getting those sissy little thumb drives.  &nbsp;  I figured it would be neat to get one so that when I go back to school and start taking graphics again, I wouldn't have to worry about trying to put my files on a Zip disk.&nbsp; Many times over the last few years, I've created designs that just wouldn't fit on the damn things.&nbsp; I've had to sacrifice quality by rasterizing them (squashing layers into one single layer) or even saving them as .jpg's so that they would fit.&nbsp; Thumb drives aren't really all that bad; however, to get one that would hold my files would cost me about three-quarters the price of an external hard drive 160 times the capacity.&nbsp; What the fuck, I'll just get one of those and worry about carrying the extra five pounds to class every day.&nbsp; Big whoop.&nbsp; It'll be worth it.&nbsp; With it I could take all of my work to class, work on it in class, and take&nbsp;it all home again.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lab's getting new computers so it should be a&nbsp;cinch to get in there, connect it, work on my projects, save/print them, and then leave without&nbsp;feeling the&nbsp;class was&nbsp;wasted.&nbsp; Before, on the shitty systems, I could hardly do any work on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I relied solely on doing the work out of class and only bring it in there to be printed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It did&nbsp;me no good doing the work in class.&nbsp; With one of these, I could&nbsp;take it all with me.  &nbsp;  I got home from work today and my parent's presented it to me.&nbsp; I was really excited.&nbsp; It is an 80 gigabyte USB hard drive.&nbsp; I plugged that thing in, let Windows do it's thing and I had a third hard drive that took my total storage capacity up to 200 gigs.&nbsp; I sat around all evening and played around with it, like a child playing with his Matchboxes.&nbsp; I just hope that the computers aren't so handicapped due to Deep Freeze that plugging it in won't be a problem.&nbsp; I also hope that the new&nbsp;iMacs they're getting are USB 2.0 compatible for complete&nbsp;usability with any system in the lab.  &nbsp;  I just ordered the next upgrade for this beast.&nbsp; It's a DVD burner that will burn any disc in any format DVD&nbsp; plus  and&nbsp; minus  R and RW and it will still burn CDs.&nbsp; I'll swap out the old CD-RW and put this one in and I'll be good to go.  &nbsp;  I figure that the next upgrade I get will probably be the final upgrade and that is to get the ATI TV Wonder Pro, Remote Control Edition.&nbsp; It's a TV tuner that will allow me to watch cable on my computer.&nbsp; It can record, replay, skip commercials of any program I can receive through my cable connection.&nbsp; I wanted to get this for a while because I thought about phasing out my television.&nbsp; But I decided not to because what if the computer went on the fritz?&nbsp; I would lose both my computer and my television and I don't think that there is any way in hell I'm going to do without both.&nbsp; NO WAY IN HELL.&nbsp; I'm a TV junkie and I'm proud of it.&nbsp; I love my TV.&nbsp; Without it my&nbsp;place is too quiet.&nbsp; I would feel alone.&nbsp; The TV made me feel like there was someone else in the room with me.  &nbsp;  But right now, I'm very satisfied with what I have.&nbsp; The DVD burner will probably be the last thing I do to this system.&nbsp; I've pretty much maxed this thing out as far as she can go.&nbsp; She's but a shadow of her former original factory-condition self.  &nbsp;  The upgrades I've done to the computer:  &nbsp;  Upped the RAM from 512 Mb to 1,024 Mb    Added a second device controller   Added an 80 Gb internal&nbsp;hard drive to accompany the original 40 Gb internal  Added an 80 Gb external hard drive  Added a Zip 100 Mb drive  Adding a combo CD-RW,DVD {plus and minus} R/RW burner  &nbsp;  I haven't decided whether to upgrade the graphics card.&nbsp; I heard doing so would help with rendering in Photoshop and Illustrator, but I don't see the need.&nbsp; I'm not a big gamer.&nbsp; I don't do anything more graphic intensive other than my normal graphic art and watching movies.  &nbsp;       Not much else happening at the moment.&nbsp; I'm getting ready to start the second part of "The Qatsi Trilogy" known as  Powaqqatsi , so look for that review coming in the next day or so.    I've also got to keep up with my German pen pal.&nbsp; I haven't written in a while and I don't want him to think I've forgotten about him.&nbsp; His letters sit on my desk and everytime I see them, I think about writing.&nbsp; When I finally sit down to writing, something comes up and I have to put it off for another day or so.&nbsp; Part of me is also afraid of writing in German.&nbsp; I don't have a verification system (i.e. Frau ter Horst) to proofread my German so I don't end up making a fool of myself&nbsp;(i.e. Jack Kennedy's jelly donut remark).    Oh, I almost forgot.&nbsp; Me and my buddy, Nathan, finally got together and played dodgeball for the first time since we were like 13-years old.&nbsp; We went out and bought some balls and we went to a playground near his house with about 8 other people and we had a blast.&nbsp; We had so much of a blast that I sprained my ankle and four days later I'm limping if I stand on it for too long (like when I'm&nbsp;at work).    Alright, time for Uncle Bill to get to bed.&nbsp; I'm pretty beat.&nbsp; 'Til next time, folks.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - CIA failed to pass on info about abandoned Iraqi weapons program   Bullshit!  Utter bullshit! It has been over a year since this war started and they are finally telling us that Iraq abandoned their WMD program?  I refuse to believe that Bush had no fucking clue that the WMD program had been abandoned.  I do believe, however, that this information was kept back as a way to keep the war in Iraq on schedule.  Over a year later, Bush can push the blame onto the CIA for their failure to provide the facts when the facts were the most important.  Whether the CIA fucked up or not, does not release Bush from the fact that  urlLink he still insists that Saddam had a link to the attacks on 9/11 .  Support the troops and vote Bush out of office.  Junior, you better start packing.

      It would seem that Lebanese-born Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun, the hostage mentioned in my last post was not killed as originally reported.  I guess I shouldn't be so hasty to post news about it until it's been definitely confirmed.  My bad.

       Hey, everyone. I finally got   Koyaanisqatsi   back from Netflix today and I watched it. Impressive movie if not unusual. This movie is the first part of what became known as   urlLink  The Qatsi Trilogy   .   Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi word meaning 'life out of balance'. It also means 'life in turmoil', 'life disintegrating', and 'a state of life that calls for another way of living.' Thinking of our own world, today, it can definately speak for it.   I was getting ready for a traditional documentary when I popped this into my DVD player but instead I got 87 minutes of video footage (footage shot for the movie and stock footage) and early 80s synthesized midi music and absolutely no dialogue (this is why it was interesting/unusual).   This movie starts out by showing you serene landscapes from the western deserts of the United States. Beautiful and breathtaking views mountains and rock formations, fissures in the earth spewing gasses and steam showing pristine wilderness. Suddenly, we're taken immediatly into a scene where our pretty landscape is interrupted by blasting. Rock and earth thrown by heavy dynamite charges. Huge earth movers come in and interrupt getting way for buildings or a highway. Huge metal towers holding electric lines for miles. We are taken gradually from our nature landscapes and thrown into our urban cityscapes riddled with polution and smog. Unseemly skylines full of buildings and streets crammed with people and traffic. I've been to many large cities in my life and I have never seen cities and urban sprawl quite like what I was seeing. Cities full of life played in fast forward so you can get the idea of the growth that human civilization has become over the last couple hundred years.   This movie takes you out of the box that is our civilization and forces us to look back into the box and see what human endeavor has done. We have taken ourselves away from nature that had produced humanity, bulldozed it over and created a 'new nature'; an urban nature; a way of living that is opposite of nature.   This movie takes us to the city streets. In fast-forward, we see cars and people stop and go by the millions in what is seen as an busy cycle of life. People come and go and the flow of people never slow down. Life is busy and people hurry to get from one place to another. We are taken into a factory where our food is not grown, but processed. We have people using huge metal machines create cars so that we can be busy, productive human beings doing unnatural things in an unnatural world. What is so interesting is that these are scenes of normal, everyday metropolises. Normal people going about their normal lives. The presentation takes you out of that environment and shows it to you as if you've never been there before and you become completely aware of the follies of mankind.   In essence, what this movie tells you (without the use of words, amazingly) is that human beings have separated themselves from nature. We have destroyed our symbiotic relationship with our planet and have literally created a new one: one of technology. You can even go as far as to say that this movie is a call to action of humans worldwide(without actors or dialogue, this movie is viewable by people of all ages and languages). It's a message that tells us that we are literally destroying it. However with the huge barrage of images of the advancement of technology, it would seem that there is no going back. What people have done to this world is permanent. However, there seems to be also a message of hope. While we see images of what technology does to us, it should help us to keep your minds geared towards what is important. While we use technology to help us live, technology is not responsible for life. Nature is responsible for life and try not to lose focus on it.   I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. It would have had more but the musical score was a bit too much for me. It was ambient and followed the flow of the movie perfectly, but since this movie was released in 1983, I can't blame the movie for being dated. It was mostly synthesized midi and at times got a bit annoying if not hypnotic but still flowed with the movie.   This movie was directed and produced by Godfrey Reggio and the executive producer is Francis Ford Coppola.     I enjoyed watching this movie. It left me feeling a little depressed at the end, which I guess is what Reggio wanted to leave you. I've got a new outlook on urban life. It's not as great as I once thought it was (I remember going to NYC for the first time and was mesmerized by how busy it was and that it never slowed down for anyone). I've seen the images and I felt embarrassed for the first time for being a human being.   I'd recommend this movie to everyone. It pertains to us all as people. We live in a world where resources could run scarce if not incredibly expensive to have (think to our own little gas crisis we had just last month...if you wanted to call that a crisis. It was not nearly as bad as the gas crisis in the 1970s). I enjoy the technology we have and it pains me to think that we destroy our world every day for the advancement of technology. I'd love to think that I could throw it all away and live without it but we can't. Our world is now such that we have to use technology so that we can do something so simple as eat or take a shit or even sleep.   After the movie, it felt to me that humanity was doomed. But watch the movie and judge for yourself.     Coming soon:   Powaqqatsi  , the second part of   urlLink  "The Qatsi Trilogy"   .

      Howard Stern fans in the Greater Pittsburgh Area will rejoice.  Stern is coming back to Pittsburgh in mid-July.  I found out this news the other day when reading the blog of my buddy, KJ.  Apparently, according to WTAE's website, Infinity Broadcasting, Inc. is picking up the show and is going to broadcast it in 27 cities, four cities, of which, Clear Channel pulled Stern off the air back in February because of naughty language and increasing pressure and fines brought on them by the FCC (remember the Janet Jackson nipple shot?  This incident gave the FCC a huge power trip to CENSOR, and to raise fines for 'violations').  Anyways, Stern was yanked off the air since then and within in the last week, the Pittsburgh Top-40 station formerly known as B94 FM has changed names and format.  They have gone all rock and are now K-Rock 93.7 FM.  They put Stern on the air on Tuesday on K-Rock and I laughed the entire way to work.  It was great to hear him again.  It wasn't on Wednesday.  Perhaps it was a preview, I dunno.  But the morning show that was there, "Dave, Bubba, Brian and Shelley", are being yanked to make room for Stern.  Good idea?  Be your own judge.  I never found them interesting and I think they would have been gone regardless since Bob and Tom's been around (They are a comedy show nationally syndicated from Indianapolis.  They are hilarious.  They have comedians come in and they do skits or just bullshit for hours and have great socio-political commentary.).  Bob and Tom showed up in Pittsburgh roughly the time that Stern went off the air.  I think that Stern's hiatus in Pittsburgh was long enough to give Bob and Tom a headstart on building a fanbase.  However, as Stern has proved, time and time again, for the last 20 years, that he'll take #1 in every single market that carries his show.  So, if you don't like Stern, you'll love Bob and Tom.  Pittsburgh radio has been sucking for the last few years.  If you wanted GOOD rock, you listened to 102.5 WDVE and if the kids wanted to listen to THEIR own brand of rock (alternative/garbage), they listened to 105.9 The X (WXDX) or 92.1 WPTS out of University of Pittsburgh.  WRRK at 96.1 has been in a (GOOD) rock format for a while and put Bob and Tom on the air.  Now with K-Rock in place, we have at least three good rock stations in Pittsburgh (K-Rock, WRRK, and DVE).  If you want pop, you're probably going to have to go to Star 100.7 FM which is "the best from the 80s, 90s and today" (I like listening to them when I'm in the mood for that 80s kick that I crave a lot.) or 96.1 KISS FM (WKST).  92.9 WLTJ and 99.7 WISH (WSHH) are your contemporary soft (wussy) rock.    Of course you have your oldies, hip-hop and your country stations(big whoop).    Now, Pittsburgh, will have a decent variety of station formats for your listening needs.

      My family has been members of online video rental store, Netflix, for almost a year. When I had first heard of Netflix, I had wondered if this was the final straw for video rental outlets like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster. I mean, you can rent movies without fear of late fees without getting out of your damn chair. There are definate perks when you're dealing with movies mailed to your house and you can keep them for as long as you want. Something like this could seriously dent business for in-store rental outlets.  I had determined a while ago that rental outlets can survive with Netflix. You can go and pick up a movie if you wanted it NOW instead of waiting for it to ship in the mail. Also, Netflix is not really the kind of rental service if you're not an avid movie watcher. If you're a very casual viewer and only watch movies now and then, then you're probably not going to justify $22 a month for just a few movies.  However, I was watching the news and I'm pretty sure that the final nails are being hammered into the coffin of video rental outlets across the country. Blockbuster and *sic* Walmart have gone online with their own Netflix clone. Each are offering online movie rental at prices that are cheaper than Netflix.  Blockbuster is offering, for $19.99 a month, three rentals at a time for an unlimited time without late fee, free shipping and free return postage. It's a Netflix clone.  Walmart, however, is offering something that appears to be a better deal than either Blockbuster or Netflix. They have three rental plans. 1) Two movies at a time for $15.54 a month for an unlimited time, free shipping and return postage. 2) Three movies for $18.76 a month. This plan beats Netflix and Blockbuster already. 3) Four movies for $21.94, which is only $.06 less than what Netflix offeres for only three movies.  To me, it seems that Walmart would have the market cornered, but there a lot of people who really don't like Walmart and even I have certain trust issues when thinking about renting anything from Walmart. When I think of Walmart renting movies, I'm constantly wondering if the movies are going to be damaged and scratched and just the overall quality ending up being shitty.  The Blockbuster deal really seems like a winner because their stores have proven good quality rental and the prices weren't bad and their online movie rental program offers two free movie rentals per month from their in-store rental outlets. However, I stopped going to Blockbuster because of their return policy. Returning movies by noon on the day they have to go back have generated a sour relationship between us. Who the hell can make it to the video store by noon to return a movie? It's an unreasonable policy and doesn't give the customer much flexibility trying to give them their movies back without fear of late fees.  Other online movie rental includes  urlLink DVD Avenue , and  urlLink Cafe DVD . . Each offers online movie rentals at pretty much the same price. Then we have  urlLink Movielink . At Movielink you pay for a single movie (usually costs between $2 and $5) and you are given a month to activate a 24-hour time limit to view the movie online on your computer using your internet connection. You buy the movie and when you start watching it, you have 24 hours to watch it as often as you can. If you want to watch it again after the 24 hours are up, there's a small fee to reactivate (something like $.99). Is it worth it? Depends. It's cheaper than renting from a store, and you still don't have to leave the house...which is the point. This seems like the kind of service for those casual viewers who don't watch movies all that often. Just make sure you've got nothing slower than DSL or Broadband when you watch.  My pick? I would recommend sticking with Netflix. Despite being a few bucks more per month, their movies ship quickly, on average, in three days. The other online rental places suggest waiting as long as six days to receive a movie. I think that there are other factors involved that would choose one service over another, but you can't really gauge them without signing up for the free trials and seeing for yourself. I'm talking about things like whether they carry a title or not or if the movie is on back order. Personally, I like Netflix because they've been around long enough and have proven that they have what it takes for true online movie rental, the movie titles are always available, and I'm never waiting long for a movie to arrive.  Will movie rental outlets suffer because of this? Yes, they will. There's competition in the online movie rental business now and there will be price wars and someone is going to try to outdo each other with specials and whatnot. Will companies have the power to draw people to rent from them? They will, but will it be enough to keep them in business? I don't think it looks promising, but time will only tell.

       urlLink What if you opened a box of Banquet fried chicken and you found a fried baby foot?   Apparently, it happened in North Carolina as a family was getting ready to enjoy some good eats from the folks at Banquet when they found a fried baby foot.  It turned out to be a wad of dough shaped like a baby's foot, complete with toes and a set of nails.  I laughed so fucking hard when I read this.  In fact, I couldn't say "fried baby foot" without laughing myself to tears.  I mean, imagine the shock and horror of a mom spreading the chicken on a cooking tray and one of the pieces resembles not only a foot, but a baby's foot.  Holy shit.  I cracked up for nearly 15 minutes.

       urlLink Woman Fired For Eating 'Unclean' Meat   In a nutshell, a woman gets hired at a telecommunications company in Florida. This company is headed by people of the Muslim faith. Now, the woman ate lunch in the cafeteria at this workplace that had pork in it, a BLT sandwich. She was fired because she violated the company's unwritten rule stating that pork (a taboo among Muslims) is not to be located anywhere on the premises.  Now, the boss stated that the company did not descriminate against this woman for her religious beliefs. They told her that they didn't care what her religious background was when they hired her. He stated that the company is sensitive to everyone's religious beliefs...so, this woman was not allowed to eat pork.  If you were a follower of Islam and a guy sitting next to you was eating a delicious ham sandwich, is it acceptable to tell that person to not eat that sandwich near you or not eat it at all? Do you have the right to restrict  someone else's  diet because it does not adhere to  your  religious beliefs?  Does an employer have the right, in an American business, a country which has laws of equal opportunity employment, to restrict ones own diet because it does not adhere to the employer's personal religious beliefs?  I believe that the answer to all of those questions is a big, fat, juicy, greasy, ham-flavored  NO .  If this employer was trying to be sensitive to others religious beliefs, why not state rules in this workplace that would adhere to other religions.   Catholocism : No meat on Fridays during Lent. You also have your Catholics who follow this rule all-year around, you know, for some extra godliness.   Judiaism : Meat accepted that comes from animals with cloven hooves (cows, sheep, goats, deer). Pork is forbidden.    Khasis Society : Animists and spirit worshippers of S.E. Asia follow a milk taboo. They can't drink milk from a goat or a cow.

       urlLink Federal Court Upholds Alabama's Ban On Sex Toys   Long story short, there's a law in Alabama that prohibits the sale of devices that can be sexually stimulating.  So I've got a question...does this mean that they have a right to shut down supermarkets and roadside produce stands to enforce this law? What about the sale of washing machines? Ask any lonely housewife about that one if you don't get it.

      Yeah, it totally sucks.  Actually, it sucks when you're doing it for the first time and you and your buddy have no idea what you're doing.  No, wait...it also sucks when you're doing it in the pouring rain and in the mud.  Oh, hold on...let's not forget when you're last stump to grind is growing horizontally out of the ground.  Yeah, it's a real bitch then.  Hey, you know it can get real shitty when your grinder runs out of gas, you fill the tank back up, the belt turning the blade snaps and you have to haul the 200-pound beast back to the truck and then to the hardware store to rent another one.

       Today was an interesting day of work. It started out as Sundays typically have been. There weren't many people coming in. We had a small after-church rush but even that wasn't as big as it usually gets.  Our store had been notified by another store that there was a woman going from store to store. First, yesterday, she went to a store with two bags full of LJS food she said her husband purchased Friday. She said that the food was all bad and that she wanted a refund, but got a replacement instead. So she got her replacement and went on her merry way. She then went to another store in the area and she complained about the food and that store did give her a refund. After this, we were told to look out for this woman.  Well, she came into the store today with a bag full of LJS food looking for a refund (we knew it was her because she gave out her last name). She had no receipt and said that she got this food from another store. We told her that we weren't going to replace her food nor give her a refund for her food because she didn't buy the food at that store and did not have a receipt to prove it. We told her that we know that she has been going store-to-store looking for a refund for food she didn't pay for. Playing it cool, she left the store without a fuss and left her bags of old food behind and we threw it away.    &lt;rant&gt;    What a pitiful excuse for a human being. We've all been told growing up that it's not our place in the world to judge people, but let's face it, all people are judgmental. For crying out loud, was this woman that desperate for a few bucks that she would go to a restaurant and take advantage of their business practices to steal money from them?  Take Walmart for another example. My mother works for Walmart and she sees, day in and day out, the things that people do to take advantage of them. I know what you're thinking,"This is Walmart", "Walmart sucks", "They shut down local businesses", "Buy imported products to keep their prices cheap", "They cut hours and benefits and double the workload of already hard-working employees", and "They are anti-union, blah blah blah". I know all of this, but this is not the point. She has seen the remains of people who shoplift from the store right under the noses of employees and the management and even the cameras. People come in and they will change underwear right in the middle of the aisles just out of sight of cameras and leave the dirty remains behind. People will go and pull an item off the shelves, tear off the tags and take it up to the Customer Service desk and, without a receipt (yeah, this is a standard Walmart practice to help build better service relations with customers) get a refund. Yeah, they will get a refund for items that they stole right off the rack. Hell, you can take something there, and get a refund for it, even if the item never even came from Walmart because you don't need a receipt.  There was a story that my mother told me where a woman was in the check-out line. There was a mistake made where the customer was short changed  one single penny . Well, this woman wouldn't hear of it. No way. Huh-uh. She began to scream and yell out loud, shouting obscenities about how Walmart rips people off, how she was ripped off, how she was going to sue the company for how wrongly people are treated in the store. She was berating the cashier, calling her nearly every obscenity you can call a person. Every other word was a vulgarity. She was making such a huge fuss that anyone within earshot of this woman was looking at how much of an ass she was making of herself. Well, to appease this woman, the management allowed her to walk out of the store with a $25 Gift Card, free of charge, for  her  trouble.    Another incident happened where the cashier was getting bitched at because of some price error. Hey, folks, mistakes happen. Another customer (who happened to be an off-duty employee) was standing in line after the woman and she completely bitched out the angry customer right there, telling her how she had no right to be yelling at the cashier like that and that no one deserves to be treated like that and that this woman does not deserve any special treatment courtesy of Walmart, and in return was called a 'bitch'. If she was not an employee of the store, she would have knocked her ass out cold. She also walked out with a $25 Gift Card.  These people are getting away with nothing more than stealing complaining about the smallest things to get a hand-out from the company. It's stealing, plain and simple.      &lt;/rant&gt;
