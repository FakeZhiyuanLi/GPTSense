      Nothing much to work these days...I get the same old objects for rework which i developed earlier. The project Go-Live dates also have been postponed to Jan 3 2005. This was something which we expected but certainly not to this extent.What else a software guy would do, if he doesn't have proper work to do..Yes ..Browse, download..we used to download music files very often earlier. In the same way i downloaded yesterday some MP3 files. Today morning, i got a mail from the administrator asking me not to download music files. Oops..I have been monitored all throughout the day on my internet activity. Definitely i didn't expect this. Hope they don't say "Stop blogging" in few days. How can i call my behaviour here..reckless indeed..

      Pondering over my current work, SAP...ABAP....I wonder what's all this nonsense which bugs me everyday...May be i need a change in technology, the commonplace demand from software engineers. I also wonder why i don't avert myself from these..One reason is money..Money provides you with all the stuff you need in this world to live.There are many other reasons as well.Of late i have come to know a lot about this Philosophical stuff..I think this is something which everybody goes through in their own life. And when i opened that mystical door, i saw a new world around me..completely new as if a person in matrix has realised it and come into the real world...It feels like i am now in Zion...Yes..What you r thinking is right.Of course i have gone crazy. Afterall crazy people would call the sane ones insane and vice versa....Actually i am in pretty confused state now...Why do you think i am writing this BLOG..one reason is to really bore you..another reason is that i myself in a restless state...don't know why..Probably i didn't have the piece of cake for the day..Oh good..When i look back and read the paragraph you have just read, i criticise myself, why i wrote this...But still there are people like you who take time to read this...Please don't think that you are wasting time here.. Actually there is NO TIME to waste...I appreciate your eagerness to read this paragraph further...But just hold on..I am still writing.. Do you see any sense in the above paragraph you read..i don't think so.Now i know why they call this as a BLOG..Boring Log..  I can feel that my tongue wanna taste some good food..Yes i am back to UK from india, eating curd rice for lunch daily...May be i can have a good biriyani some time here if i get a chance to go to Manchester or London. People say or rather IBM says there should be Work-life balance..Why the hell then they don't give few days together leave..All Hypocrites..Yes this includes me and you as well..we say something ..we do something..we can't even avoid it..And again when it's all done, we start our complaints..This is gonna go forever unless we put an end ourselves..How can we do that..Is there a way at all..Mind that there is always an answer to your question in philosophy..Philosophy can answer you in one or other way.But that need not be true.Good that i came to know about this early on.But still there is something in me that says you go on in search of that thing which you ought to search.In doing so, i find myself put amidst many predicaments, dilemmas, resulting in further confusion, rather than solving the problems.It actually complicates the process. I read somewhere that this very search itself is the problem..If that is the problem why am i not stopping the search.Somewhere something falsifies me..don't know what is that..May be you know.do reply if you know..Enough for today ..gotta go home. i do have something to cheer in this life. Gonna listen some songs by A r Rahman in my laptop, downloaded last month here in UK, yes of course illegally.. I wonder if i am restless or Reckless....

      I spent almost half day at office, only reading other's blogs.I won't be alone in my opinion, when i say blogging brings out the almost real YOU. I say almost, because not always the feelings can be aptly expressed in words, the implicit shortcoming of any language. When i started analysing further on what it can do to us, i had the below thoughts. All these need not necessarily be true for you though. 1) It certainly produces in us the writing addiction. 2) It makes us discover new ways to make the blog visitors visit again. 3) It fuels the thought of becoming like someone,when we read inspiring blogs. 4) it makes us more introverted. 5) it drives us to learn new words in lexicon to express simple things which can be expressed with our current vocabulary. 6) it tries to make us a Click'O'Maniac in search for more. 7) it makes us wonder if i we are one among those who have fallen sick with presenteeism 8) it arouses that 'not so easy to reconcile' critic in us who would like to question our current work. 9) it might make us brag about oneself even if it is not supposed to be. Above all, it made me write this blog.

      Didn't find any bug to fix today. So, thought of scribbling again here. And my workplace remains cool and calm today for some reason, while i am writing this.I am hearing songs as well !! Can't get these times very often. As we don't have much work today, we decided to search online for ISPs here in northwich.Not many provide this facility here. Telewest broadband seems to be the choice of all of us. Online quote shows that we would need to spend around 35-40 poundsper month, which is quite ok if we all are sharing. I can see trouble brewing already, as we start to discuss about TV channels to choose.Each one has their ownchoice and we have to go for a compromise, else it will blow our budget.Lo! here is noon, time for lunch. Nothing much to smile about.Got to eat the rice with yoghurt(can be called Curd rice).Let me see if i get something for work after lunch.

      Yesterday, definitely went right for me, both on and off work. My development went right and tested and approved. Secondly, India won as i expected.The last few overs of the match made me restless and i wonder how it would have been, if i had watched the match in TV instead of checking scorecards online stealthily.Certainly a commendable performance by Jayasurya and Sehwag. Last night was again one of those wetly nights.Had watched two movies. Runaway Jury and Quills. I have heard about 'Runaway Jury' as john Grisham's novel,but never read it. The movie had all it ingredients to fill up for a novel adaptation with commendable screenplay and dialogues. Worth watching. Later i watched Quillsalone in the laptop in my bedroom at about 12 am. Who would be interested in storyline at that time, well certainly not me. Yes u guessed it right, I fastforwarded the whole movie,playing it only when the need(!) arises. Well, what shall i say, Kate winslet has it all.

      I broke my specs, not deliberately of course. I remember i have advised my friends saying "It's bound to happen" when something of this sort happens to them.But now it has happened to me. Should i say to myself the samething, yes i did. Can we say then that 'Life is all about taking things lightly'. My Answer would be 'The answer is not that simple'.Enough of those philosophical stuff.This weekend passed away for me in the same way as it did for the past few two months. Watching TV,cook , eat and sleep...and more watching TVand reading books. I read 'Fermat's Last theorem' by simon singh..really a good read. Apart from describing Andrew Wiles' passion towards Fermat's Last theorem from this childhood days in a rather simple way, Simon also provides information about the background of this theorem and how Fermat drew inspiration from Diophantus' book 'Arithmetica', giving credit to ancient Greek mythology.The author has taken much care to provide the reader an impressive read by not just dealing with Fermat's Last theorem instead providing a valuable chronological series of events that culminated inFermat's declaration that he had a 'truly marvellous proof' to the then mathematicians,the event which would keep the great minds of next 358 years looking to reconstruct that infamous proof, only toend at Andrew wiles' lecture at Newton institute in Cambridge.
