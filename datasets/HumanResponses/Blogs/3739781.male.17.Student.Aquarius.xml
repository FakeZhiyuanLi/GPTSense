      Ok, So I'm leaving. I'm leaving for a long time, actually a really long time. I'm going to Thailand for foreign exchange. I'll be there for 10 months, then I'll fly into California for a few weeks then back to home. Just keep checking here and I'll try and give updates as often as possible, or just when I feel like it. I might just get another site that's better though, but I'll make sure to tell everyone what's happening with the site.  Ok so here is the real LOW down. I leave august 5th at 10:21am from Dayton, heading to DETROIT (DETROIT ROCK CITY)! Then I get to wait in the airport for 5 hours........*sigh*. Then I leave from Detroit to Tokyo at 3:45pm on a 15 hour flight, yes I am planning on drugging myself so I can't be awake for that hell. Then I arrive in Tokyo at 5:35pm on August 6th. Then I get to wait for another two hours in the airport. Then I get on another plane at 7:40pm and head off for a 12 hour flight to BKK, Thailand and I arrive at 11:50pm to be greeted by my host family, and a ton of other people who I won't know or be able to speak to. Then I have a 7 hour drive to Kantralak, Si Sa Ket (Si Sa Ket is the province I'll be living in).  That's the travel portion of my trip. Its really cool though the town I'm going to be living in, there will be two other exchange students Denise (from Brazil). Denise is there right now and she'll be in Thailand till January. Also the best part is that she will be living right across the street from me which I am completely stoked about! Then there is Maria (from Germany). I've talked to her a lot as well and she is really cool. I'm really really excited about this trip and I know it won't be my last trip, I will be all over every time I can.   So there's the deal, I would tell you about my family but I really don't feel like it right now, so maybe next time, or never I don't know but I've gotta jet

      Wow only nine days until I leave. I really can't believe it. These past 7 days have been amazing! I had family fly in from all around the country, New York, Florida, and California, and then one drove here from&nbsp;Kentucky for me! We had a giant party where all my family from in town came to visit, and some of my favorite teachers came to see me off. Everyone was very generous with there gifts, and now I can say that I will be able to go on the 3 trips that rotary is taking us on in throughout the year.    One sad note   Only one time before this party I have had a downer, but the second hit for the first time two days ago, when I was saying my final goodbye to my brother. A feeling I have never had before. Words can't explain the feeling. It was partial sadness, part goodbye, part will I ever see you again, and part wow, I'm going to Thailand, and I'm leaving my family behind.   REVAMPED LIFESTYLE  One person made me feel whole again. This kid is one who I can actually talk to, and know he would never tell a soul what I say. We actually talked to each other and funny how things seem but we are on the exact same page with our other friends. Some are cool, some are getting on our nerves and some are just changing.  We were able to just have fun as well, we went to the video store and played Frisbee in the parking lot (very unsuccessful try, it was far too windy for my Frisbee). But then we went out and we borrowed a sign from and undisclosed place for me to take to Thailand. It was fun. And I actually was having a really good time, which has been hard for me to do in the last few weeks.   Well I must go now, keep checking back for updates!

      This weekend was a blast. I was able to go to Otterbein Ohio for my Youth Exchange Orientation. It was so much fun I met so many different people, and I heard so many different views about the US and several other things. I met Canadians, and West Virginians and people from everywhere. I learned that Canadians really do say eh, and they don't know how to speak and they read like a little kid. The word ABOUT to them is like ABoat and but that's alright, I also met one named D'arrcy, he was really cool he is living out every little kids fantasy. He is becoming a zoo keeper and he gets to work with zebras.  My excitement now is just bringing me to see a complete nirvana. Its odd how so many things work, and when I'm having the most fun and at my biggest high........I hit a wall. To my lowest low. I'm just now learning how to work with it and it is better but sometimes I just think wow, how can I get through this. Then the next day or in a few hours I'm fine again, but maybe that's just how this whole thing works, I'm putting my whole life on hold to gain a lifetime of experiences. I'm going to come back completely different, and then all my friends will be gone. Not physically, but their mental state. They will have changed as well.  Everything happens for a reason. No need to be worried about it, there is some reason behind it that will take you to good. It may not seem that way for now, but later you will get the answer when you don't expect it, you may not even want the answer at that time, but it will come...Eventually

      Today marks 27 days until I leave for Thailand, it really is exciting. I can't say anything else, but at the same time it is very sad for me. I'm leaving my room, My house, my friends, MY FAMILY..... I was just laying on my bed and I realized that I will probably be really really sad when I leave. I'm leaving everything I care and need.  Everyone, Friends, and Family: Thanks for being there whenever I have needed you and I hope that you will be there forever. I will always be here for you, through thick and thin. I'll miss all of you more than the world. It is difficult for me to put my life on hold, but for this short period of time, I'm giving up a year of fun, to gain a lifetime of experiences that I hope I'll never forget, and I hope I'll be able to share with you my new found knowledge. I'll miss you all from the day I leave to the day I get back ~Jonathan  My excitement is building! I can't wait to meet all my new friends in Thailand (mostly Ju and Denise [two brazilians] and Andrew [aussie] and Bianca [South African]). The days are passing so quickly and my excitement is doing the same.  Today is orientation!!! I'll be there at around 5 I think. I'll be there till around Sunday at 10 and I'll get home at around 12-1 in the afternoon.  I'll miss all of you, but at the same time you all will be right next to me ~Jonathan

      Ok, the countdown is getting closer 35 days. I am really really excited.  I'm making this post for all of my friends so you better take it to heart, otherwise I'll beat the crap out of you before I leave :D..........Anyway  The other night I was coming home from walmart with 3 of my friends and we were listening to music, making complete asses of ourselves. I thought it was great. This was one of the first times I have ever not been the driver with my friends and I noticed one thing when I was sitting in the back. My friends are the greatest friends in the world. I love them all. I'm going to miss them more than anything when I'm in Thailand. It was the strangest feeling ever, and yet one of the greatest. Seeing everyone with a giant smile and hearing the same words "Hope it dangles on a string.....I am vindicated, I am selfish I am wrong, I am right"(Dashboard-Vindicated)but at that moment everything seemed to go into slow motion, and pulled me into a depression of sadness....Like what I have just started experience just hear in the last few seconds of writing this post. But it made me really really happy at the same time, to know my friends are there, and they always will be.  Thanks everyone, as this tear runs down my cheek. I'll miss all of you, and I will be back, I swear to that. I love you all more than the world.......  ~Jonathan
