      I write that title with trepidation because one isn't a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that's what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They've been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I'm certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that's a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn't try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I've met so many people my age and older who think they're creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I'm not a creative genius already. It's going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I'm applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that's what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I've got a bunch of applications to work on.

      So I was near the outer edge of Isabel as it hit North Carolina. I think my power was out for about 5 seconds. Other people in the  urlLink Triangle  lost power, and a tree fell on my mother's house. Overall, I give it an "eh." I've been through at least five real hurricanes, so being on the edge of a weak one meant a lot less to me than it meant to others. I was surprised at how worked up some people became. And on a high note, my developed super 8 film arrived today, on time.   urlLink Reuters: U.S. Counts Cost of Isabel

      writing (or getting ready to) and listening to urlLink  WXYC  in Chapel Hill. What am I writing, you ask? Well, any geek that reads comics these days knows that  urlLink Marvel Comics  is taking open submissions for their "rediscovered" Epic imprint. I thought I might as well give it a shot, but my confidence wavers as I attempt to put something decent together. Well, maybe next post is going to be about me. I have to start somewhere, but why not somewhere other than the beginning?

      Hey there. If you're reading this, then you've found Daniel Cloud's weblog. There's not much here right now, but in the coming months this will hopefully turn into something interesting and productive. Or at least productive.  This brings up a great issue in weblogging. Why do we blog?  Think about it...

      Halloween is tomorrow, and I don't have a costume. It has been years since I've dressed up, no, even celebrated on Halloween. During college it seems I always had a night class on Halloween (I know), and last year I was in Silver Spring, MD and didn't know anybody who was having a party or anything. So this year I have the chance to celebrate again, and I could care less. Can't I go to a Halloween party as the jerk-who-doesn't-dress-up? Every party needs someone wearing  that  costume.  What's more important is that I'm waiting to hear about my new job. No more wage slave slave wages! I guess I forgot to post about that. But I'm new to this. Well, I was offered a job working at the local public university. At least I was offered it by the department I'd be working for. I am still waiting to hear from the Human Resources department, which can take a while. Of course I still put in my two weeks notice at my present job. It just feels too good to be getting out of there. I will miss some of my coworkers, though.  Oh, and I gave up on grad school for this year. I came to my senses and realized that even though I could take some kick ass photos, I am applying for  film  school. But it is a little odd that in order to get into film school, they want you to submit a reel of films you've shot, right? I mean isn't that a little chicken and egg? Or cart before horse? Well, I knew in the back of my mind that photos wouldn't cut it, and I also knew that I couldn't get a short film done in time. This just gives me the time to do it right.

       urlLink Shocked ? I have trouble understanding how anyone could be at this point. The news coming out of Iraq has been filled with stories of attacks directly on U.S. forces. Why not a hotel in the middle of Baghdad? Honestly, it seems pretty obvious that the fighting won't simply die down and that the military can't keep order when they're not fighting soldiers, but armed civilians. The official war may be over, but the unofficial one seems to be kicking into high gear.  Well, I don't want to get myself into a discussion about war policy, but I began to wonder if perhaps the world would do well to watch  urlLink MTV's The Real World . I happened to catch the episode where they find out that the U.S. is going to war. The one non-American tried to have a discussion with his roommates about why go to war, etc. and he got yelled at by a New York girl who believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11. And sadly she represents many Americans. If people across the globe watched the Real World, they'd be sending us aid so that we might better educate ourselves and actually pay attention to facts and use reason.  Oh nuts. I just argued that people should watch MTV. I swear I'm never turning on the TV again.

      Everybody's seen this by now, but I still think its funny. For your entertainment, check out  urlLink Strindberg & helium . On another note, a coworker of mine happened to hook up with a friend of mine through  urlLink Onion Personals  and went out on a date. In my eyes, they couldn't be more different personality-wise. One is a negative, dour complainer, the other is agreeable and good-natured. Like oil and water, I thought. But apparently things went all right, and they're going to go out again. I guess this just shows what I know about people. Maybe it has to do with horrible, depressing loneliness. But that's what  urlLink beer  is for, right? When my friend Adam and I were trying to figure out how they met (which online service), we thought it might be  urlLink Friendster . We were wrong. But I'm still wondering about the concept. You sign up and create a circle of friends which connects you to their friends, giving you new people to meet. But what if you just moved somewhere and don't have any friends there? That's why someone needs to start nofriendster.com.

      So my pictures look pretty good. Some things didn't turn out like I wanted, some turned out better, so that evens out. Just in case, I bought four more rolls of film to shoot. Maybe if I don't say anything, I can keep my friend's light meter indefinitely. Oh, that would be wrong. I want my own light meter. I know, I could become a mooch like those people who set up begging websites on the internet! Coming soon... givemoneytodanielcloudsohecanbuyafancylightmeter.com!

      My pictures are supposed to be ready today. I can go get them after 5pm. I hope they look good. I also got confirmation of my voter registration changes. I'm now a registered  urlLink Democrat . Now I can vote for  urlLink Howard Dean  in the primary as long as  urlLink NCforDean  gets all the needed signatures. Link, link, link. We shall see how the pictures turn out. I think I can post pictures with this free blogger account. Right?

      I think I took a bluritin instead of a claritin today. I was so out of it. Maybe it's the rain we're getting. And now I'm freaking out about film school applications. I have shot some film (Super8 and 16mm), but nothing worthy of a grad school creative portfolio. So I thought photos would do. Now that I've taken some photos to round out a photo portfolio, I've become very nervous about submitting that over my film work. After all, I'm going to let the schools know I've worked with motion picture film. So aren't they going to wonder why I didn't submit that? On the other hand, all my film work was for educational purposes, so how could anyone expect it to be good? I was learning. Ugh. I'm just being paranoid and intimidated. Stupid Bluritin.

      I popped over to the main  urlLink Blogger site  and saw a featured blog called  urlLink The North Carolina Experiment  which caught my eye since I have lived all my life (that I remember) in NC. It was so interesting to read about this girl's life adventures and browse around her photo gallery. I want a photo gallery. I want a neat looking web page. But I have to work towards it. First I have to get back into web designin' shape. And deal with the things that affect my life right now. Sunday and Monday I converted the garage into a pseudo-studio for me to take pictures in. A musician friend of mine came by yesterday and I took one and 3/4 rolls of pictures of him so I could make him a neat poster. Thing is, I haven't taken many photos in a while, and I was trying to do a semi-professional job though right now I'm an amateur. I just hope I got something useable, basically. And now I want to find some space I can permanently use for studio space. So I can learn. I just need money, which may be coming my way. I think I might get a new job. Full time, benefits. Something a little higher than wage slave. I'm working up the ladder of success, but I'm taking it one rung at a time.

      Recap of today: 5:20a - alarm goes off. 5:40a - realize I turned alarm off at 5:20am and went back to sleep. 5:40-6:10 - got ready for the day. 6:10-6:40 - cleaned up, prepared my lunch for the day, wondered why I have to be up before the sun. 6:40-6:55 - driving to work. 6:55-7:05 - waiting for the boss to arrive. She was late. 7:05a-3:00p - **Wage Slave** 3:00p-3:40 - drive to Raleigh and try to find studio lighting supply company. 3:40-4something - driving home. 4something-6p - rest 6-7:30-eat, watch some teevee 7:30-now - Frantically try to get my grad school applications together.  I've seen some blogs where they go through their day, and it's interesting. That wasn't. Well, hopefully I'll have something interesting to say by Monday night. I spent some cash buying supplies so that I can convert my dad's garage into a photo studio for two days. My goal is to emerge with some photos, and perhaps even some Super8 film, that I'd be willing to submit to grad schools for my creative portfolio. I did some film and photo work as an undergrad, but I don't think it's anything I'd want to submit. I could have gobs of videos from high school and college of stuff I've shot that I don't like. Because before now, everything was for just getting by. Now I need something worthy of putting my name on it, and I have to hurry up and do something. That's a lesson right there. Always do your best. Or maybe it's don't eat the paste. Or something. I got it! Build a time machine and convince your younger self the importance of working hard. And tell him what you want to do with your life so the past you doesn't spend high school and college staring at the sun. I have to go to work tomorrow.

      I got an email from a college friend of mine today. Her boyfriend's military unit has been activated is going to Iraq. He is a great person, and I hope the best for him. I wish the politicians had to do the fighting rather than the soldiers. This is Bush's war, not the American people's.

      I have been googling high school classmates. Most turn up garbage (nothing about them), but I've found a few people mentioned here and there. If I linked to these references, does that count as an invasion of privacy, or would I just be creepy? For those of you who suggest the latter, I'd say give it a  urlLink try . I have googled myself regularly. Since I share the exact name of a  urlLink historical figure , I used t have to narrow the search to my state or college to get any results, and they were not exciting. But I just googled myself and guess what? My blog popped up as the fourth link. Does this mean it's time to listen to  urlLink Blogger's advice ?

      I'm not sure why there are 5 year high school reunions. Four of those years most people spend in college. If you're like me, you went to college and got your Bachelor's and spent the last year trying to find a full time job. Or maybe you went to grad school right away. But anyway, it's not like most of us have become movers and shakers. I believe that the purpose of the 5 year reunion (if your high school even starts this early) is for people to see that nobody has achieved anything yet, so that job at the Waffle House as a line cook isn't anything to be ashamed about. The 5 year reunion is about observing those people who have done something "important," like get married or buy a house, and ostracize them. That means you, Will.

      I guess I never said how my new job was going (which I started Monday). I think things have been going well as I have been learning the different processes and procedures of my new job. It's nice to have a desk again, the last time being when I interned for  urlLink Public Citizen  last September-December. Of course this time I can really dig in and customize my desk. What kinds of things do people bring to their cubicle or cubicle-like space? Maybe some photos, but I don't have many photos of family/friends that I'd want to put up. Not my style, I guess. Perhaps some photos I've taken (to get my head churning with creative ideas)? I'll find some little tchotchkes to bring in and put up. I've got some bumper stickers that I never... nah. Tchotchkes it is. So anyway, one of my non-secretarial duties may include website design or updating. I have done some stuff here and there that never saw the light of Day-ta, or has been slapped together for private use. In my nascent stages, I even mistook the &lt;frame&gt; tag for something useful and not horrible. So I did a little bit, and stopped. Since then, CSS became more standard. Now there are  urlLink some really neat things  you can do with CSS that tempt the  urlLink control freak  in me. Of course, you say, Blogger uses CSS, so any self respecting blognerd would be up on the CSS. Well, I'm working on it. I'm sure by now everyone has read the recent  urlLink Onion article on blogging  which was linked to on Blogger's main page. I read it and thought it was hi-larious. Then I thought about it seriously. Would I want people I know reading my blog? I haven't really told anyone about it or directed anyone to it. I haven't put up an site counting code or anything to see if anyone is even reading it. I have to admit that I am apprehensive about sharing my thoughts and feelings with people. Anyone who knows me would probably say I'm very private or secretive. And looking at some of my posts, I haven't really spilled my guts out here, either. I just don't think to share a lot about my life, and often feel like a lot of it either isn't worth mentioning or isn't anyone's business. Maybe there is a paranoia issue hiding back there. I thought writing to this blog and in my journal would keep me writing every day and help me as a creative writer. I write in my journal at least as frequently as in this blog, and I write more there than I ever have here. I'm getting there, but this has yet to result in me coming up with some kick-ass story ideas. Except for that one about a ceiling fan that tells you stories, but that's more of an invention idea.

      I got a letter from Marvel Comics the other day saying that they stopped taking submissions, and apparently mine got there after this decision. I must have been right on the line because it was about a week after i sent my submission in that rumors started popping up on the internet. Well, its dead in the water, which is fine. It was good experience to work on a single pice of writing for a few months. Maybe I'm more resilient because of this experience. I'm soooo tired right now, but I have done nothing all day. Except go to my new employee orientation for my new job. I can't wait to get paid. Yessir.

      As of right now, I'm supposed to start my new job next Monday. I have to go to an orientation this Thursday, and another one the day after I start the job. Yee-haw! It isn't my dream job, but then again, I don't know what my dream job would be yet. Anyway, this bodes well for me financially, which also means I can move into a new place closer to town, or at least on the bus line (cause the buses in Chapel Hill are free!). I've come up with a list of roommate requirements/concerns. I want a roommate who: is neat and clean (at least as much as I am), won't be noisy during my sleep hours, doesn't want cable tv, isn't religious (at least not around me), and won't have any problem with me bringing women home all the time. Hey, it could happen. Okay, maybe part of the time.  A woman , then. I can only imagine what this next phase of my life will be like. But soon I shall be happily living it. Maybe I'll even turn this third rate blog into a third rate website, time permitting. I'm going to be busy trying to put together my film portfolio anyway.

      Yeah, I'm going to mess around with my page headline. I feel like it needs to be more esoteric and cool, like "Thin distant parity" or "Sk8rboi" or something. I dunno, I have been writing in my journal regularly as of late, which is nice. Been trying to figure out some story ideas I've had. I'll be in the midst of writing a story when I wonder how it would work as a short film, and I get stuck because of that. If I wasn't writing with the mindset that I want to turn some of my stories into short films, this conflict would not arise. However I do want to go to film school, so I think about what locations the story has, what does and does not work visually, etc. This obstacle isn't helping me in any way. However, I should be able to rethink things for cinema if I need to. I'll figure it out if I keep working on it. On a side note, I think I've turned a corner in my development as a human. Or at least making up for progress lost to the post-college muck I've been mired in. Anyway, I think I've pulled myself out at least halfway. Over Christmas, I learned that some things must be said despite the consequences. Wow, I rewrote that a few times and couldn't come up with anything better to say. Hurm. The story of my Christmas revelation is one better told in person anyway. So I can continuously insert the phrase "I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy!"

      Okay, so I have a dilemma. I've been invited to New Year's in Wilmington where a number of my college friends will be. However, I have to work during the day on New Year's Eve. I have the 1st off, then I have to work again on the 2nd. So if I drove down (it would take two hours to get there) after work, I'd get there about 7p or 8p. I could drink, rejoice, and then crash on Marshall's couch. The next day I would have to drive back at some point. It would be a bit of a drag driving there and back, but I haven't seen some of these people in almost two years. Also, I don't have plans here (that I remember). Thirdly, at least one of the my college friends is driving from Maryland to be there (she is driving down earlier however). Boy, this is one of those things where I cringe at the effort, but really it is worth it. I'm sure my family would try to talk me out of it. Stupid naysayers. Well, maybe that's me. I shouldn't listen to what others say. I should do what I want. I can drive down at 5 or 6pm and get there and have fun. I can sober up at some point the next day and drive back. I don't got nothin' else to do. And if I don't go I ruin my chances at seeing old friends, drinking in my favorite drinking town, seeing my friend's bands, and making memories. I couldn't come up with a good last on, and I wanted a list of four. Well, I'm going dammit. You can't stop me!   You can't stop me!      You can't stop me!     woo.

      So apparently Ralph Nader is thinking about running again, and  urlLink people are reacting accordingly . I just want to say no. "No, Ralph, no." Listen to the people around you who think that is a bad idea. I know there are people telling you that. You are a crusader and a dreamer, but you will never be president. Good. Got that out of my system. Now for random drivel. I got my first cell phone today. I'm the last one in my immediate family to get one, which is surprising because I'm the techie in the family, and I worked for a cell phone reseller for a while. I had a pager, but that doesn't quite count. With the pager, I got messages and had to figure out how to call people back. That's a pain. But until now it just didn't fit into my budget. At my current job I make enough money to pay for a cell phone  and  my ~12 monthly comic titles. I just hope I have enough left over to save for grad school, or in the very least a  urlLink HD plasma TV . Not that I could ever justify spending $8,000 on a television. A G5 powerbook, maybe, but that kind of toy doesn't exist...  urlLink yet . The good news of the day is that I took my car to find out why the engine has been idling between 3 and 4 thousand rpms. While it was amusing to hear my car scream like the Tide car in the Winston Cup, I am happy to say the problem has been fixed, and for US$85. That was nice to learn when my estimate was about twice that.  urlLink Vote for your favorite anti-Bush political ads!

      So I went back to the eye doctor. They put drops in my eyes to dilate them, and left me alone for ten minutes so the drops could do their work. Apparently, these were teamster drops. When someone came back to check on me, they said nothing was happening and then put more drops in my eyes. I thought I was in for it then. But I was reading the complimentary copy of EGM for a while and my vision wasn't getting any blurrier. So when the doctor came to see if I was ready, he peered at my eyes with this "huh?" look on his face, and then wrote on my file that I needed another drop. This more powerful drop did the trick... but they only put it in my left eye, the one the doctor thought he saw something in. Oh yeah, that drop did the trick and now my left eye is wide open. For you photography enthusiasts, I'd say my eye was almost an f1.0. My time with the doctor was brief and consisted of me looking to the left, and down to the left. Everything was okay, he said. Well, I forgot to ask about getting copies of those pics of my corneas. At least I didn't have to give them any more money.

      I went to the eye doctor today (optometrist, ophthalmologist who knows?). They had this neat machine that takes pictures of your cornea so you don't have to get your eyes dilated. Even though it cost more, I thought it would be cool to see a picture of my eye and not do the eye dilation thing, aka temporary blindness. So I opt for the laser picture thing. The tech took the photos and told me the eye doc would see me in a minute. But then they had me take my contacts out. When the cool laser photos of my eyes were pulled up, I couldn't see worth a damn. But the colors were vibrant and pretty. I was too shy to ask them if I could somehow get copies of the image files. Oh well, I thought. Then later in the day, and I mean probably less than an hour later, I get a call from the eye doctor's office. They want me to come back in for dilation so they can look at something in my eye. The first thing I should have thought was: "Oh no, is something wrong with my eyes?" Instead I thought: "I paid extra for this fancy procedure, and they want me to come back and get the old fashioned dilation now, too? I don't want to pay for that!" Maybe I'll get copies of those eye photos at least.

      Oh yeah, now that two people I know have read my blog, I can start making demands, er, recommendations. Ooooh internet! First off, some  urlLink great   urlLink online   urlLink comics . Not too great considering those sites link to each other, so find one, and you can probably find them all. I shall also plug  urlLink Irritability  because my friend's boyfriend draws it, and he is a nice guy. It's kinda like  urlLink Penny Arcade , but with a different  slant . You know I'm feeling cocky when I put the word slant in italics.  And here is the requisite political link for Howard Dean for  urlLink President 2004 . And thank you, Al Gore.

      It hasn't been built at all, really. But I'm thinking about putting one up through an actual  pay service . If creating danielcloud dot com (or whatever) isn't stroking my own ego, I don't know what is. I guess I'd want to figure out how to migrate everything from here, though. Not that it is all that much right now. Maybe I'd just plaster it with ads. Oh yeah. That would be sweet. For now, I bring you commenting. Woo.

      That's how I would describe my first high school reunion. I drank around six pints, and just about everything felt like blah nostalgia. I didn't care to talk to many people there, many there didn't care to talk to me. Or maybe I should describe it as if it were a sitcom during sweeps. Anticipation was high. There were a few surprise appearances, and one highly anticipated cameo. The rest was just the usual filler. I am however motivated to write more. I put my chicken scratch on a number of pages on Saturday and Sunday. There may even be a good screenplay idea in there, and I have been getting more ideas as of late. If I can just keep up the inspiration...

      and somehow I am starting to feel the need to see it  now . Funny, since I didn't like the second one and when  Revolutions  came out, I wasn't interested in seeing it. And I usually get to see movies for free, so it wasn't the cost factor. Anyway, now for some reason I want to see the movie (for completion's sake), and it isn't playing around here and won't be on video for a while. I shall do my best to forget about it for now. I moved into my new place a few weeks ago (the day after my last post, actually). Just now getting the computer set up. No internet yet. I have been cooking for myself when I have the time to cook. I do a damn good job. Last night I made a dry rub for a strip steak and steamed some green beans in my steamer. Yum.  I also used Xmas money to buy a Wusthoff chef's knife. I have used it a lot and have also already cut myself on it. It is damn sharp. On another note, I was in the mall on Monday, and I went into the GameStop. I have their used game discount card, but despite seeing a number of bargains, I could not bring myself to spend money on a new game. The last one I bought was Legend of Zelda, and there are games I know I'd like. I wonder if this aversion was simply because I have spent so much money recently or if I'm just not interested enough in playing video games. However, I'm still playing Tony Hawk 4. That's my life right now. There's a  urlLink film festival  in Durham this weekend that I may go see some films at. Yippie.

      That's a message to you kids out there who think they're invincible. Don't get into the drugs. They bad. I have my car working in somewhat ordinary fashion now. The speedometer was replaced, so now I can tell people I have a new car, only 5000 miles. What difference is 70,000 miles here and there? I'm glad to have the hunk of metal back. I am moving tomorrow and I will need to drive to my new house, and then to the store that carried the things I need that I don't have yet. I also don't know what I don't have yet that I need. I'll figure that out when I get my stuff over there and unpack. Saw  urlLink 21 Grams  last night. It was pretty lame and depressing. I like a good depressing movie (I took a date to see  urlLink Reqiuem For a Dream ), but this didn't have much going for it. It tried too hard to be profoundly depressing and didn't develop the story enough. I want to see the new Gus Van Sant movie,  urlLink Elephant . There was something else I was going to say... hmmmm... forgot. Oh well.

      Had a fun New Year in Wilmington. Had to work on Friday. When I get off the bus at the park and ride at 5:40pm, I see the hole where my driver's side window used to be. Somebody uninstalled the after-market cd player I had installed in September. Fiddlesticks. There was a CD in there, too. Disc two of Eric Clapton: Blues. They didn't take anything else. I guess they didn't know the tripod and reflector were worth anything. I didn't get very upset over all this. But now my car needs a new window and the speedometer doesn't work. And that will cost me money. Did I mention that I don't have coverage for this kind of my damage in my current insurance? Oh ho, I could get pissed that when I had two weeks to renew or change my coverage, my insurance provider did not return my calls or emails. I should have gone ahead and switched. But I didn't. Oh well.  Other than that incident, my life is looking up right now. Moving into a new place in a week. At some point today I plan on looking for a new bed.  But right now, I'm going to take a nap. It's only 9 something am on a saturday. I wouldn't be awake right now if I hadn't taken my abused motor vehicle to the dealership to get fixed.  I need to keep thinking about the right name for this blog, and when I figure it out, I shall name the blog that name which is right.

      when he created  urlLink Ray Parker, Jr.  I'm just trying to get you to download iTunes. Cause it's for Mac and PC, and it rocks. Especially when you're looking for the guy who sang the Ghostbusters theme. On another note, I was thinking about how men are like Germany and women are like France. This started out as a thought about how the word "vagina" does not sound very eloquent. I'd recount how I got to that point, but that's two steps more than I want to take in the wrong direction. However, I would like to assert that the word "penis" sounds coarse, or Germanic. I spent a whole week in Germany, I should know. Well, I think German is a beautiful language, but it is gutteral and has some harsh tones involved. French has some spitting to it, but overall it flows far more smoothly and sounds more delicate to the ear. So I decided that the vagina should have had a more French sounding name. I then thought about other ways that males were German and females were French. I ended up with something about France and Germany being an old married couple. They've had their fights, major ones, but now they've calmed down and matured and they only occasionally fight over Alsace-Lorraine. Hey, I've imagined a ceiling fan that tells you stories and a vat of goo that you sit in instead of a chair so you aren't stressing any muscles. And yet I can't write a serious screenplay to save my life.

      That was  urlLink the best game  back in the day. I must admit I was one of those people who played video games throughout my life. Why, I remember playing Nintendo64 in the dorm. Everyone sat on my bed and we played Mario Kart on the tiniest tv that Carlos, my "roommate," left there. That was so much fun. I have a Gamecube now, but I haven't bought any new games in forever, and I think I'm getting out of the habit. Too much other stuff to do, I guess. Such as writing and doing other work that should bring me closer to film school. I am determined, however, to make my own  Legend of Zelda  ringtone for my cellphone.

      Now is  urlLink found . Sweet. I saw this a few years ago, watched the whole thing, wondered who spent all that time putting it together, then I watched it again. This may be going on my sidebar.  I went to the gym today for the first time in a while. Did a nice, brief workout that didn't push my body too hard. It was nice. It was funny to see the same social dynamic of the college gym at work again. I guess you have to expect that since the students go to classes together. They bond or something and then work out to impress each other. Me, I was happy to do anything physical and not die of pain or lack of energy. Good thing, too. I was determined to get to the gym today, and I didn't let myself get sidetracked by my missing combination lock. I went to the Student Stores and bought myself one. I was disoriented in the gym because I was not used to the layout or signing up for cardio machines, but it worked out okay. I also realized I've gotten to that point where I'm not nervous about stripping down and getting into the locker room shower. I was too sweaty to care about anyone seeing my hairy flabby body. Now I'm going to be like those old guys who walk around the locker room naked and talking to each other. Okay, maybe  not .  And that my friends, is more than you wanted to know, and more than I would have said even a year ago. Maybe it's the disconnect of posting online, but I think I'm becoming somewhat more extroverted than I have ever been before.  I gotta get something to eat and go write.

      I feel like I'm the only one who saw the piece on the nightly news where they played two versions of Howard Dean's Iowa Speech. Everyone saw or heard about the one the networks played: Dean was red in the face and yelling like a madman (as people have characterized it. Then they played a tape from an independent source; one that didn't have the direct mic feed the networks used. Instead, you could hear the  urlLink roar of the crowd . Now that hardly seems like a mad rant, now does it? It bothers me that a) people have let their opinions about the Democratic candidates be shaped by major media coverage rather than the actual politics of the candidates and b) this "incident" is probably going to finish Dean off. It really is only about who looks best in front of the cameras, isn't it?

      It has been a long time, but I have managed to reconnect with a lost love. Yes, I mean the internet. I could only see the internet at work for the past month, but now I'm set up at my new place. Hoo-ray. Perhaps now I can post more frequently since I don't have to fit it into my lunch break. There's a party going on right now that I've been invited to, but I'm not sure if I can get myself to get dressed and go. The party is supposed to be a unicolor party, where you wear all one color. But the person holding the party said no black or other dark colors. That cuts my wardrobe down to like three things, none of which will keep me warm enough. What to do, what to do. Update my links?

      Tweaked the blog during lunch break today. Added some links, a dorky weather badge (cause people want to know the weather where I am), changed the hover behavior for links, and altered the blue background. It might be this cpu monitor, but the color seemed a little too dark. I'm going to do more tweaking when I get the time. I'm supposed to get RoadRunner set up this weekend. Actually, it's Earthlink branded, but via Time Warner. Whatever. Didn't want to say "I'm getting internet this weekend!" Cause that sounds silly. Well, things here are thawing after the craptastic snowfall. Since the snow was covered with ice almost immediately, the landscape took on a shiny white appearance. It was as if the world has been painted with white enamel. On the other hand, it was not funny when I busted my ass trying to take the stinking garbage out to the dumpster, or going mad being stuck all day. One day I decided to venture out and ended up walking into downtown Chapel Hill via Carrboro. That's no marathon, but a considerable feat in the cold mess. It was good exercise. My apartment is almost finished. I woodglued some chairs back together last night while watching Gladiator on TV and sauteeing a plantain.

      I ate some Uncle Ben's Chicken with Wild Rice for dinner, and I think it gave me gas. I am experiencing gassiness right now, but can rice do that to you? I think my stomach is trying to tell me not to eat food.  Cucalorus was cool. Well, pretty cool. It was awesome to be in Wilmington again. [Thanks for putting me up/up with me, Megan.] Cucalorus had some cool/fun short films to offer, such as  urlLink A Ninja Pays Half My Rent , and some sucky ones (which we won't name). I also saw "Monkey Junction," a film by a UNCW professor and nice guy, Dave Monahan, starring some girl who used to hang out at the same coffeeshop as me.  I haven't seen Dawn of the Dead yet. I think I want to see it, but I'm not sure. For now, there's always a  urlLink good java zombie simulation  when you need a fix.  Oh, and I did something creative this week and it's only Tuesday night! I bought some magazines ( National Geographic, I.D.,  and  B&W ) and cut out some neat pictures. That's not particularly creative, but after that I bought a piece of sheet metal and some magnets, and fitted the sheet metal into a cheap old frame. Instant magnet board for my room. It's not an original creative idea, but it looks pretty cool, holds lots of pictures, and I made it myself in one evening. The plan is to rotate pictures on the board as I find new ones in magazines or maybe ones I've taken that I like. I know I'm going to dig up some old photos of friends. This magnetoboard should inspire me as I write. Right now, among the pictures are: a porcupine, a lamp made from styrofoam cups, a Depression era union meeting being held in secret at night, a tree, and some Armenian teenagers dressed for a graduation party (you wouldn't know they weren't American's without seeing the article). I don't have a favorite right now, although one of the Armenian girls looks very pretty and contemplative and perhaps slightly uncomfortable about being the center of attention.

      I'm at work.  shhhhhh...  I have called Time-Warner yet again to come fix my cable modem-internet-hoozfamita. I wanted to yell at the customer service guy on the other end because I am frustrated, but I know that wouldn't help, so I didn't. I may give the repair guy hell when he comes out, though. "Rewire the whole thing! Now!"  Saw that girl again, we'll call her LyndonBaines. Well, LyndonBaines had come to my place of employment and was laughing hysterically, supposedly because she was lost. She came up to me and could barely talk she was laughing so much. It was embarrassing to be talking to her, frankly. I don't know whether she's crazy or just the most neurotically nervous person I have ever met. I hope for the latter, otherwise I should be seriously worried about her.  On the bright side, I am going to Wilmington this weekend, and that shall be fun. I'm going to relax and enjoy the nice weather, as it should be about 70 deg. there all weekend. But I want to drink beer tonight, before I go.

      Before I was born, apparently things were built to last  Or so I'm told. I'm thinking about that since my cable modem is acting up again. I'd like to think it's  urlLink some other problem  bothering the whole internet. But I don't think so. There it goes again. F-U-Cee-Qeh. I hate this so much. Well, at least people made mistakes  urlLink 20 years ago .  I sit here typing this into TextEdit because I don't know when my connection will go back up. This reminds me of way back in the early to mid-90s when I bought a 2400 baud modem and our family got AOL version 1.0 or something like that. Just as my family invaded the internet and clogged it with our newbie filth, so did others follow and connecting to AOL became the hugest hassle. Then we got rid of it and signed up with Netcom. Netcom got bought by Mindspring, which got bought by Earthlink, which got bought by... AOL-Time Warner. Now I have "Earthlink" internet provided to me by a cable company that I usually trust to charge exorbitant rates for cable tv. Something seems very wrong here. Maybe I should get DSL through BellSouth. I mean they can't be that bad. After all, they already had their monopoly when they were part of Ma Bell, so they learned their lesson, right? Ha. I don't want to think about it. I'm going to call Time-Warner, demand they fix the problem and credit me for the time I have lost experiencing crappy internet connectivity.  On another note, on Monday I saw a girl I went out with once or twice a few years ago. This is the second or third time I've seen her in C.H. She always acts excited to see me, and on Monday time she made a point of giving me her phone number again. But when we went out, it didn't take long for her to hook up with another guy. And I wasn't all that interested in her then. We just hooked up at a party, and I stayed in touch out of a naive feeling of obligation to this girl (that and her friends knew where to find me). I just want to ask, what's up with that? I mean, she was/is good looking, but is that any reason for me  not  to continue to ignore her presence in Chapel Hill?  I had something else to write about that would ordinarily go  here . But I can't remember what anymore. Stupid disconnection cable modem.

I apologize to those I have emailed out of the blue in search of lodging. Both of you. I wonder if I know anyone else still living in Wilmington. Kyle? Adam. You're still there. I should have an email address for you. One that won't block my emails to you, right? Man, I'm tired. It is bedtime for Bonzo. I will be playing the role of Bonzo. Oh, I finally put up some (framed) posters, a Japanese woodblock art calendar, and a coat hanger, which I didn't get attached to the studs in the walls, cause they kept disappearing when I used the stud finder. And the stud finder was working cause it was raising all ruckus when I used it on myself.  Hyuck.

      I have this new alarm clock with three separate alarms, one of which can be set to "nature sounds." Right now I have the forest at night turned on, or whatever it's called. It is far better than the beach w/ waves one (it has seagulls that sound more annoying than real ones). I was at Strongs writing when I thought about my white noise preferences. I sat toward the back of the coffeeshop so I wouldn't have to hear these two women in scholarly jibber-jabber. I knew they were loud enough to distract and annoy me. So I sat nearer to back where the noise was more... fluid. There was the hum of a few machines (at least one a fridge), and some music ("some" only because the music system was malfunctioning). I wonder if how much help good white noise CDs would be when I'm trying to write while at the computer. I have a lot of trouble concentrating without a little white noise. And the whir of my computer fan doesn't do anything for me. I think the froggy forest is doing okay right now, but I think it's a 15-30 second loop, so the owl hoots are a little bit distracting. I think I'd like it better if it were just frogs. Well, I came to do some work, not to make a lengthy discourse on white noise, frogs, and Strong's coffee. Cause that will get me thinking of that one girl who works there and her fabulous ghetto booty...

      I finally typed up a short script I have been working on for a while. It's still in it's infancy, and I don't know where the end is yet. However, much of what I write doesn't make it to the computer, so it has already earned some distinction. If I finish it and shoot it, that would be a major accomplishment. I have given up on writing for spec. Somehow I let my screenwriting teacher convince me to worry about overstepping the writer's role. I mean, I'm going to shoot the stuff I'm writing now anyway. I'm getting better at just getting it down on paper, crap or not.  I got another winning  urlLink iTunes  cap today. I'm open to suggestions about what song I should get next. I'd prefer something unusual that I might not have heard of.  Okay, I have to go work on my crap (see above).

This could take forever, however my computer is old and lacks the hard drive space for me to really pack everything away. That said, 12GB used to be more than anyone ever needed. Now the iPods have more storage than my computer does. Maybe I'll get an external hard drive. Oh yeah, that costs money, and I've already been spending enough of that. Or at least I think so. I haven't balanced Quicken and checked how I'm faring against my budget.

You just have to be willing to stand in a convenience store and pull out a lot of Pepsi bottles as the people in line watch you. Now I need to redeem the songs. But what should I get? I'm going to buy at least one now. Decisions, decisions.

      Can you guys tell I'm an iTunes advocate? Now you can win some songs from the iTunes Music Store  urlLink for sure . Have yet to try this out, but I will sometime today.   I called Time-Warner about my cable internet and they sent someone out this morning. But wouldn't you know that it was working fine by the time the guy got here?  He came and left and so did my internet access. Except for a while the lights were solid (connection=working), but I couldn't load any web pages. Well, at least I have internet right now.   It's noon, but I want to make some pancakes. I'm also sort of craving burritos. There has to be a middle ground. After all there is such thing as dessert tacos, and breakfast burritos, so I'm assuming a pancake used as a burrito shell to stuff with meat and cheese and salsa must be around there somewhere.  Ate a cheeseburger at Tyler's. It was very yummy. I think I'll eat at Tyler's again.  I am wearing my "I Am Ten Ninjas" shirt that I bought at  urlLink Diesel Sweeties . All my sidelinks are valuable, see?

      I was going to post a little bit about what I liked about Triplets last night, but the stupid internet kept cutting out. It's like I'm paying for cable internet but getting dialup.  I have come to hate the flashing lights on my cable modem. Hopefully this will be fixed soon (supposedly it is a network problem). Anyway, the movie was good. Entertaining, werid, and at times hilarious. There was almost no dialogue, which worked out well; the animation didn't need it. There were some funny insults about Americans. I'd see it again, especially if there wasn't some girl faking an orgasm of interest and excitement sitting behind me. Luckily this girl eventually shut up and watched the movie.  P.S. Somebody buy me a blender or food processor. Thanks.

      I don't know. I was thinking about something and then forgot the invention. Now I know how Ron Popeil feels. Went to an Oscar party last night. Talk about the suck of sucks. After  LOTR  first two wins, I decided that the Academy must be trying to show  Titanic  that it wasn't that special. And then  LOTR  went on to win all the awards they were nominated for. By now I understand that the Academy Awards don't decide what is good cinema, but by nominating movies like  Lost in Translation ,  Whale Rider , etc., they pretend to have some taste beyond the big Hollywood moneymakers. So anyway the party was kinda fun, and the free food was very fun, but for the most part I just sat there, trying to be entertained. Had I known more of the people better, I might have engaged some people in conversation, but I was a guest at a company function. There was a girl there that looked exactly like someone I went to high school with. I thought maybe it was her, but she actually looked like the girl in high school, young and fresh-faced. After this girl left I learned that it was the girl I went to high school with. Maybe she got an unaging robot body. I don't know, but she looked good. Which says a lot since she and I didn't care for each other in high school, and I didn't find her attractive in the least then. And apparently she and another girl from high school (we all worked on the school paper) may have been at that party I got sick at a couple weeks ago. Funny, funny. I have to get out of this town.  I am going to buy an alarm clock with  two  alarms. How long have they made such devices?  Tired, tired. Oscar wore me out.  I think I'll skip the gym today.

      1.Go into your  LJ's   blog's  archives. 2.Find your 23rd post (or closest to). 3.Find the fifth sentence (or closest to). 4.Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.   "I have googled myself regularly."  Now I have googled  Magwana . No,  not   urlLink that Magwana .  Close , but no cigar.  And that's it for now.  Oh, I'm almost halfway through "The Moviegoer," which is swift for me. I'm a slow reader. Anyway, I'm not feeling it yet, but I guess that's okay for halfway.  Also, one of the med student women who get on at my bus stop gave me a big smile this morning. I smiled back. Why didn't I talk to her? I think I'm becoming more antisocial. There was a time when I'd talk to people at random. Well, a period of four years called college. I kept to myself pretty much until then. Was it the location? The social atmosphere? The tropical print t-shirts? The beer?   This is it.  No, wait.  I did some writing at home on my computer the other night. I was a good little writer.

      I ate too many jelly beans. Last night I ate a whole bunch of chicken in mole sauce. Yum, but it seems as my exercise rate increases, my willpower against eating a lot decreases to compensate.   Anyway, I found a neat  urlLink design site  I wanted to share. From there I went to  urlLink  ashleywoodartist.com  and saw some cool art that I could end up buying. I think I'm in a spending mode. I keep thinking of things to buy, like a new TV or a new computer. I really want a new laptop, but I also want to wait for a G5 powerbook, which still hasn't happened yet.  Started reading "The Moviegoer" by Walker Percy. Only the first thirty pages, but I have the feeling I might like it.  I watched Magnolia this past weekend. It was pretty good. DVDs, whether to rent or to buy, are going to become a big money hole for me. I was at Best Buy looking at TVs when I wandered into the DVD section. There was a deal for the DVD of the first two seasons of  urlLink  The Office  , and I was very tempted to buy them. I talked myself out of it, but now it is in my head that I must have them. Funny, funny series from across the pond.

      It's so nice outside. Sat out for about 3 hours straight so far. It was warm in the sunlight, but I feel like I'm still thawing out from the winter and enjoy all the warmth I can get. Wrote two and a half pages of nothing. Saw a girl in running clothes sitting listening to an iPod. She looked familiar, but I don't know why. Didn't say a word to her.  I'm going to Lowes and then possibly Best Buy. At Lowes I'm going to check out lights and perhaps price out a home-grown light kit for some short movie projects that could get underway in the next month or so. Best Buy because I want to look at TVs. I will probably buy the next volume of The Family Guy on DVD while I'm there. But I won't commit to buying it so I won't think about how I'm spending all my earnings.  Last weekend I bought some Ray Bans with polarized lenses. They were expensive. I normally buy cheap sunglasses ($10 or less), but I was drawn to spending $100 on a pair of Ray Bans. They are so worth their cost. I've never had a pair of sunglasses this sturdy or that made my vision better in daylight. They are such an indulgence, but they are like the BMW of sunglasses. Or whatever car is considered the pinnacle of engineering excellence these days.  I'm also thinking about doing some good old color photography. I feel that I'm ready to delve into professional color stocks. There's so much beautiful flora these days.

      I have declined the offer to sneak preview Gmail from Google.  I have (finally) scanned some photos I took for a friend and posted them for him to download, even though I never got inspired to make a good poster for him. Doh well.  I watched the last  Matrix  movie because I was convinced I needed to finish the series even though I didn't like the second one. I realized you can see the point in writing the third one where they gave up and admitted they had no idea how to build on the coolness and originality of the first one.  Revolutions  was comical. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers watched the two part Animatrix episode, "The Second Rennaisance." That gave the first movie a good back-story that would have allowed for them to conceivably write decent sequels.  So  Matrix Revolutions  was my first rental with my new VisArt membership. Now I feel like I need to make up for it by only renting Criterion DVDs or something.  So I'm up for suggestions on good arthouse/independent/oddball movies anyone has seen.

      I am tempted to buy a PS2 just to play the  urlLink Transformers video game . Ah, childhood memories. I need to go back and watch the Transformers movie again. And now I can, thanks to my brand new DVD player! Finally, I have the technology. I already had some DVDs, but I'd depended on my roommate to bring the A/V ruckus or watched movies on my computer (back when a DVD drive in a computer was the shiz). Well, I grew up and bought me a DVD player. Now I need a better TV, or at least some speakers. I can live without DTS, but the TV (that was graciously given to me) has only on speaker. Yes, TVs are still made that way, or at least they were 8 years ago when my family bought it. Well, I should hold off any more purchases as long as I can. Perhaps I'll get a roommate with a hi-def plasma screen tv and a THX-certified surround sound system.  On another note, I decided not to get to bed at a "decent hour" anymore. I'm young, and the night has more to offer. Besides, I'm not operating any heavy machinery at work. Though if they gave me a rocket pack and told me to fight the Nazis, I would.

      Worked the lesbian wedding last night with Adam. It was fun, and the work was not too hard. Some apparently non-lesbian girl was trying to lead both myself and Adam on a little. Okay, maybe she's just a nice person who includes everybody in the fun. Anyway, she doesn't live around here.  My room is a mess. I've been falling down on my cleanup responsibilities. There are dishes in the dishwasher that have been clean for a few days now, but I have yet to put them away. I need to vacuum. In fact, I may need a new vacuum since the current one doesn't want to work for more than 3 minutes at a time.  I don't want to deal with it right now. I haven't had lunch yet, and I want to get out of the house. Maybe I'll be ready to clean up later.  Ha.

      I finally redeemed my last Pepsi won iTunes song. Yeah, I hadn't committed until now. I have overcome my fear of commitment. A few nights ago, I saw the unofficial trailer for   urlLink Garden State   via  urlLink natalieportman.com . Yes, I know I'm a freak. Anyway, the song over the trailer is hypnotizing. It's  urlLink "Let Go"  by Frou Frou, and when I heard it, I knew I had to have it.  I saw   urlLink Hellboy   tonight (technically last night now). It was a fun movie. I was glad it didn't try too hard to play up the saving the world aspect. I can accept that a lot of movies are about saving the whole world/universe, but often Hollywood expresses that in long, predictable fights (where the hero gets totally beaten up by the villain until he finds the will to give one last blow...). Anyway,  Hellboy  didn't do that. It set good boundaries for how far out it would get. Of course it already had  the  Rasputin as the main villain. Not to mention a demon, a fishman, and Selma Blair.  It is now sometime around 1:30a and I'm tired, but full of Wendy's. I stuffed my face. I think my body is forcing me to balance any excercise/eating right with cheeseburgers. I have no willpower.

      I wanted to do my own redesign of this blog, but there were too many good templates to choose from. I will have to put back the old links at some point soon, since the space for them was overwritten by the new template. I suspect the Blogger folks will roll out support for custom fields (such as a list of links) so I don't have to go in and tweak every time I change templates. They've made some good changes to the service so far, and I'm sure more is soon to come. Well, I guess the relinkage is a task for tomorrow, or whenever I get the energy.

      1. My eyes  2. No ceiling fans upstairs/no second floor air circulation  3. My stomach (feels like a bowlful of jelly).  So my eyes are bothering me a lot because I have a contacts prescription that is set to not sacrifice my proximate vision for perfect distance vision. So I can read while wearing my contacts, but my distance vision isn't perfect. Everything within at least 20ft was in focus. Or so it was until recently, when I noticed that things start getting a bit fuzzy just past 4 feet, and my distance vision is worse. Now I remember two different optometrists recommending going for perfect distance vision, then having reading glasses. The first time this was recommended was while I was in school, and I wanted to be able to read the board and my textbook without glasses. So we compromised on the prescription. Since then my eyes have gotten worse (-7.00 diopters on each eye). I was already in the range where they don't make contacts in .25 diopters of each other, so this is an approximation before taking the adjustment to maintain good proximate sight. Things being what they are now, I should go back to the optometrist (it's only been about 6 months) and get reading glasses and contacts for distance. Of course this would mean wearing glasses most of the day (who doesn't need their proximate vision 90% of the time anyway?). Or perhaps going the other way and having driving glasses. But that would leave me blurry when I'm looking afar (how far would have to be determined). The moral of the story is that I'm slowly but determinedly going blind. I mean, it's all downhill from here. I don't think laser eye surgery would work for me since my eyes are still changing (hence worsening sight). What can I do but lose more and more of my sight until I just see fuzzy blobs of color even with the strongest of optic assistance. I've been wearing some form of corrective lenses since elementary school. I was told there should be a point where my vision would stabilize. I could live with that. But no, I have to think about bifocal solutions at the age of 23.  Oh, and it's warm up here. I changed the overhead bulb to a Compact Fluorescent, and it doesn't get as hot up here as it had pre-CFL, but it's still warm. And there's no ceiling fan. My family used to have all sorts of portable fans, but those seem to have disappeared with time, and the dominance of the ceiling fan in the home. My dad's house has ceiling fans in all three bedrooms, the office, and the family room downstairs (which opens to the kitchen and "parlor." This condo: no ceiling fans. I need to push this issue because the airflow just sucks. Why aren't houses built to accommodate airflow beyond the air conditioner? It just makes sense in these places where the one thermostat is downstairs. By the way, it's nice and cool down there.  Finally, why don't I have any self control? I work out on Monday, then skip out Wednesday and Friday. I eat vegetables and fruit most days, then one day I heat up and eat an entire frozen pizza by myself. It's the same with money, really. I'll be thrifty for a few days, then buy a bunch of CDs or go out and spend $20 drinking. I am like a rollercoaster. I don't like rollercoasters.

      Via Slate, a light read on  urlLink getting more people to vote . I think people really do think it's a hassle, and difficult to know the candidates. I remember that feeling looking at the long list of positions where I knew nothing about the race or the candidates (county judges, school board, etc.).  I haven't been writing so much recently. I need to get back in the habit, and dive into the fiction. It's  halfway through May, and I haven't made much progress with film school stuff. Well, none, really. It doesn't count to write a bunch of first drafts and do nothing with them subsequently. I need to write and shoot some stuff soon.

I also wonder if this will be enough to keep me from moving over to SixApart's TypePad or even their powerful MovableType system. Time will tell.

      So my Yahoo Mail has been upgraded to 2GB of storage, thanks to some urlLink  friendly competition . I had been paying for the ability to download my email from Yahoo to my email program (which used to be free, by the way), and now have all this added stuff at no additional cost. But will I make use of it? I was one of the intial thousands invited to try out  urlLink Gmail  (as I think were all Blogger users) and I opted out of that thinking I didn't really need webmail that offered huge amounts of space. Currently my email is deleted off Yahoo after I download it to my computer, so I didn't even use the space I had then. My other thought was trying out  urlLink YPOPS! , a program that supposedly lets you download Yahoo email via POP for free. Free is great. You know, it's nice being able to check my email from anywhere. It's nice to be able to download it to my computer so I have  my  email on  my  computer and never have to worry about changing access rules. I've had my Yahoo! account since 1996 or 1997, so I've become accustomed to it. I don't like changing email addresses around (some people I never could keep up with because I didn't know what email addresses they were using at the time). I like having the email address I have. If I went over to another service, would I be able to have my name as my email without a bunch of numbers or strange characters? I don't want to be danie1clou188893##@somewhere.com. Perhaps I'll just stay the course until I can figure something else out.  You know, I could buy and pay for my own domain and use have me@danielcloudrocks.com. Hmmmm...

      While I was at work today the news came in that a murder suspect was loose in Carrboro, and was believed armed and dangerous. Now he fled his car at some point in Chapel Hill and went along the railroad tracks into Carrboro. Had he continued with the railroad, he would have gone past my bus route home. It seems he moved into the woods at some point. I left work not knowing what the present situation was. I missed my regular bus and instead took the J bus, which goes through downtown Carrboro. When I got off at my stop, I saw helicopters hovering over an area not too far away. Needless to say I was concerned that I might have left the kettle on the stove, so I moved quickly to my domicile. As it turns out, they had already found him, and  urlLink learned that it wasn't him , but someone else. I mean, they were chasing a different criminal than they thought. Kinda funny.   Anyway, it's been thundering for about twenty minutes with no sign of rain. I want to go out to Cafe Driade and sit and write, but I would like the weather to settle its mind first.  Also, I asked for the week of the Fourth of July off, but have then neglected to make any plans to go anywhere or do anything. Maybe I'll just relax here. Bleh. That would be boring. What kind of trip can a single guy take on a small budget and with little planning? Maybe I should travel to some big city and stay in a hostel for cheap. I could try to pick up foreign traveler chicks. That sounds quick and easy. My American Express (trip to find) traveler chicks.

      So I had another interesting dream last night. I managed to write that one down, too, but it's kinda long. My dream the other night was kind of like the Real World/Survivor at the start. Everyone did confessionals, but they gave them on the toilet. In fact, one girl was finishing up her confessional as she was pulling up her underwear. At another point, one person was giving confessional and then there was someone on another identical toilet (this is happening like splitscreen in my mind) who started talking to him. Weird, but without the graphic toilet a/v that you're probably imagining now. Everyone set a square of toilet paper in front of their goodies when getting "on camera." Anyway, I think there was a vote-off system since people seemed to be discussing who to get rid of. Then it seems it become Ye Olde Real Worlde because (and this is when I become a character in my dream) we were trying to find out how our water was turning into apple cider. We went out of the cottage (apparently this small wooden shack was bigger and modern on the inside??) and saw half eaten apples on the roof. Apparently that and the rainwater made apple cider. No, that makes sense. At some point later I was doing laundry, but it wasn't laundry because these mended sheets were somehow doughy in the middle. So I ate some holes in the sheets. One of the girls started inquiring about sewing machines. I think she was European. END DREAM  Dreams are fun!

      I'm turning on Blogger's commenting system for now. That way, I'll be more confused as to whether to use  urlLink Blogger  or  urlLink Haloscan  for comments. I'm a fan of all the features in one place, which Blogger doesn't currently provide, though they've been making improvements. Of course this gets me thinking about what I'll be using this site for (and if I'll still be using this site) down the road. It's funny to think that  three  four years ago nobody was doing this. Well, maybe some people, but not everybody. Not the masses, as it is today. And to wonder what it will be like down the road, how blogs will evolve and whatnot is fascinating. What ordinary users may not keep up with is the push to create standards for weblogs to foster interoperability between services. I'm not going to go into detail cause I'm going to lunch now. Wait until you hear about the dream I had yesterday...

      You'd think that an administration trying to portray the Iraq war as a war of liberation would attempt to maintain an image of decency. But of course it comes out that the Abu Ghraib abuses were  urlLink reported by the Red Cross last November  (originally in the  urlLink L.A. Times , for those who want to sign up). Tom Tomorrow goes into  urlLink detail .  Ignoring/Covering this up has made things worse for our military, and that pisses me off. This is why things are difficult. Iraqis and the rest of the world now have a number of reasons  not  to trust America. We now know there was knowledge of abuse for many months. Everyone in the chain of command must have known. To argue that this information never reached top officials, including the White House, at this point is ridiculous. You'd have to argue either gross incompetence or premeditated deception on the part of the Administration.  There you have it: lies and cover-ups or gross incompetence. Every scandal that's come out of this administration has been brushed by saying "we didn't know" and "it's not our fault." There's no room left for Bush to hide behind lies as evidence piles up. The administration knew about Abu Ghraib, the threat of terrorist attack in 2001, etc. You have to ignore evidence, facts that have been established, to deny that. So which is it? Premeditated Deception or Gross Incompetence?

      I really tried to resist responding to  urlLink this thread .  [rant suppressed]  Okay, yeah. I have some major disagreements with the whole thread, but I won't delve into it other than to say: The RNC hasn't represented the values of their working class constituents for decades, if not the entire last century. The Republican Party has not been about smaller government or lower taxes in a very long time. Anyone interested in fiscal responsibility and efficient government would best be represented by the Democrats, or (if you still don't realize that Democrats balance budgets and create jobs and wealth) perhaps the Libertarians (who seem to actually want to shrink government). I had written a long explanation, but decided not to turn this into an essay. Reagan=weak economy, higher taxes (he repealed the tax cuts he made early in his first term), Bush the elder=weak economy, higher taxes, Bush the lesser=tax burden shifted to the states by cutting federal support (that's Dubya's tax cut in a nutshell), weakest economy since the Depression. Clinton=two terms of the strongest economy America had since WWII, your taxes were used efficiently to create that.  So I only sort of suppressed the rant. I just hope people think about when they were well off and could get ahead, and when they have been scraping by. That's what people need to think about for this next election.  Also, I liked the speeches at the convention. You may have missed great ones from John Edwards, Barack Obama, Ted Kennedy, and others. And about the slogans: I think Kerry using "hope is on the way" or "help is on the way" makes sense. When Bush was saying it in 2000, it meant little. After all, America was doing well. Apparently Bush was talking to his aristocratic friends, telling them he was about to screw the middle class in order to increase the gap between the elite and the working American. Kerry and Edwards are bringing hope, and help, to the backbone of America, the great masses who work hard every day. I thought the message of hope and unity is important in a time when the current administration promotes fear and suspicion at home. It sounds corny, but it's believable. Bush failed to create a better America, but he surely did a lot to tear it down. Edwards and Kerry spoke the way they did to remind people that the government can be a great force for good when the right people are in the White House.

      I started reading  The Professor &amp; the Madman  today. Was sitting at the  urlLink Open Eye Cafe , just getting started, when I find myself suddenly surrounded by two groups of loudmouths. They had a right to be there, but they were loud and sitting on either side of me. I wished I had my CD player (or that  urlLink iPod  I don't have yet), and then got to thinking about  urlLink acoustic   urlLink baffling . I should get paid to improve people's businesses. I've already identified places that could use some friggin fans in the summer. Is the plural loudmouths  or loudmouthes ? Oh, thanks spellcheck. I'll just put a line through that one.

      I've been neglecting posting for a while now. I just plumb forgot. Have been working on some script ideas, though. I keep writing things that I'm interested in at first only to later decide they are lame. Something about not being able to write endings. Some stuff starts to turn autobiographical in a way, and that bothers me. I have one script that I like and want to develop more, but because of the subject matter I worry that people would think it was autobiographical in a way, when in fact it's not, it just comes from my cynical, dark side. So I hope I can write some other stuff that would make for a better first couple of projects and then save the other one for when I can get people to take me seriously. I'm so good at being vague about this.  Well, I guess I should throw a bone to make up for that. I signed up with an online personals site and am looking for a date. Ironic that I live in a college town yet feel like there's nobody around to date. Maybe I could go to grad school just to pick up women. That has to be a great plan. Har. Anyway, not really finding that much so far. It's hard to be interested in people's profiles over the internet. You get just the information they want to share, which is usually conveyed through embarrasing desparation or trite sarcasm. I chose trite sarcasm.  After taking this plunge (or toe dip, as I haven't made a huge commitment of it), I saw a pretty girl sitting alone at Open Eye Caffe [sic] on Sunday. I tried not to stare, but she was sitting next to the nice photography I was examining. Our eyes met a few times and she smiled politely. You know, it's been a while since anyone smiled politely at me. Anyway, I think I've been too reclusive lately. I made writing a priority, but maybe I've taken it too far. I barely speak to anyone. Haven't made an effort to see friends, family, or acquaintances recently. I guess it's good they still call  me . Oh, yeah. I didn't even say hello to the girl.  I'm going to vote in the  urlLink NC primary  today, then go see  urlLink I, Robot .      Note: I almost lost this post in the publishing phantom zone. I also forgot to give it a title.

      I'm on my vacation this week with no plans to go anywhere or do anything. In a way, that alone is relaxing. I had a post somewhere that disappeared. I don't remember what it was about right now.

      Briefly: I went to a friend's thirtieth birthday party last weekend, and all his friends (including myself) spent a good amount of time arguing with my friend's dad about John Kerry. He thought it was odd that Kerry has spent so much time talking about his military background, and as a former soldier, he didn't think military service meant a good commander-in-chief. I wanted to make the point that Kerry had to prove his toughness, since Republicans have always tried to portray Democrats as anti-military and weak (on crime, unwilling to fight). It would have been a huge issue this election if the Dems had a candidate who hadn't served because the RNC would say that in times of war we need a war president (never mind Bush went AWOL for three months). Anyway, didn't have a chance to point that out at the time. Anyway, everyone was friendly afterwards, and the cake was good.  The weather! These past two days have been gorgeous. I think it may have something to do with Hurricane Alex. The weather in Wilmington was always very mild after a hurricane, but I think some of that made it up here. It's warm, with a nice cool breeze, clear skies. I need to be outside, so I'm going to find something to do.
