        It's a pretty uneventful day. Boring, in colluqial terms. BORING as HELL. Not that hell would be boring with all the fire and stuff. But anyway, it's boring. This day's boring. Nothing to do. People keep annoying me. Boring. Nothing to do. I could finish my English assignment early but that would be to diligent for my liking.        The complete boredom of this weekend can still be saved by watching Troy the second time with my friends. Unless it rains. Then my mum would go all paranoid and go "What if a tree falls on you?" Oh well. I'm good. Life's good. It better be. He he he.        Yeah, Oliver was starting to annoy me again. Wait, scratch that, he was insulting me. In a joking manner anyway if not I would have walked over to his house and bonked him on the head.        Anyway, I'm talking with my cousin right now. He's gay. He's really nice. So i gotta go. Until next time.

        His sister knows that I like Oliver. And I don't care one bit. That's because I told her that since Cho likes Oliver, it will seem like I'm betraying Cho. She says I'm a good friend... Which gets me thinking, am I? Quite frankly, I still like Ollie. Despite there's a big possibility that he likes Cho back and despite seeing them together every single day until they break up. Sounds unreal. But it is reality. Reality bites.      Ah well, I guess that's life. I just don't know why I like Ollie so much. Funnily, I noticed that it's for the same qualities Cho loves about him. Same admiration for the voice, for the smiling eyes and for the friggin' brain he possesses. Oh damn, I hate recounting those things. Anyway, Cho excitedly told me this little story that happened between period 3 and 4. She and another friend were walking to Maths (I take easier Maths because I don't like numbers eventhough I'm pretty good with them), when Oliver was behind them and Cho was like: "Hello Oliver!" And he goes: "Hello Oliver!" I am not even kidding, he loves annoying Cho, which further means that he does like her. It's pretty obvious really. And frankly, I don't care.      My day's pretty good I guess. I'm starting to do kick-boxing on thursday. Or was it taebo? I wouldn't care less anyway. Yeah, so I think everything's pretty boring at the moment.     I gotta go and make my chemistry homework. Friggin' redox half-equations won't finish themselves. And I don't even want to take anything to do with medicine when I leave school! I just want to be a lawyer!!!

        Cho*'s really nice. She's the first person I really trusted ever since I moved here. Well, we can both relate to each other, I guess. Both of us moved here from Asian countries so I think there are ties that bind us. She moved here a year ago. I moved here five months ago. So we both understand how it feels to be new. And not just that: how to struggle using a language, how to feel left out, typical stuff. Anyway, she happens to like Oliver Wood*. So she likes Ollie, right? Guess what? There's a possibility that he likes her back. Which is a good thing, right? I mean, I should be HAPPY right? I SHOULD BE. Well, i'm not.        Yeah, so I like Oliver. SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? OK, Ok. So I like the guy my friend likes. That's why i'm doomed. I've made up so many crappy lies to cover things up. I told her that I like Oliver's friend, I told her I've got a boyfriend back home. SHITTY STUFF. And to think that I can't lie very well. As a matter of fact I CAN. That's what she doesn't know anyway. So, yeah, I like Oliver. IS THAT A CRIME? Is it a crime that I like a guy??? IS IT? HUH?? So it's not. Not unless the guy's your friend's crush. Technically, I am commiting a crime. I'm so dead. WHY DID HE HAVE TO BE THE ONE SHE LIKES??? I mean, scratch that, WHY ME??? That's much, much better.        Hey wait! I shouldn't be blaming myself. It's HIS fault. It's all his fault he has to be so likable. He's a sarcastic, brattish, smart, cute... er-- you get the picture? I think you get me, right? Well, I hope so. I think, one stage in a person's life they encounter this problem. I guess it's time for mine.        It gets me thinking. Once they hook up, I mean, I'll always be some sort of a spectator. Their first date, their second until their relationship falls apart. THEN I won't know how I would feel. THIS SITUATION SUCKS, I tell you. Right now I don't know where I should stand. Btw, I saw Oliver at the movies yesterday. I went with my family to watch Troy. AND AS A GOOD FRIEND, I sent Cho an SMS telling her that she should come to the movies ASAP. She didn't make it. This really sucks. Oh and yeah, before I sign out. I was talking to Oliver's sister about the movies and I told her that I saw he brother. She asked Oliver if he saw me and he told her HE DID. Amazing, I thought I was good at being invisible. Anyway, that doesn't matter coz he thinks of me as a friend. Which isn't too bad I guess...              *Names have been changed to ensure the privacy of the people involved.
