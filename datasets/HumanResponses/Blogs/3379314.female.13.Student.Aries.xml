      I remember when my life was flawless. When my worst problem was a boy touched me. And i actually thought that was a problem. But as I've grown their is atleast one thing that i have learned.My problems are only going to get harder. My biggest problem right now is well i don't really like the way i look. And thats not even really a problem...  Today I had a feildtrip and my mom was the chaperone. It was soooo boring it was baseball game and basically i hate baseball even more then i use to. My arms got seriosly sun burnt. they r like so really ugly!.

      ok so most of you know that my fave color is pink and how i wear it every day basically i'm kind of obsessedd with it(along with usher!)  well anyway pink is my thing and every since i started wearing it alot of people at my school are trying to do the pink thing. and they so can't couse it's my thing! Like shavan for instance is always wearing pink EVERYDAY. She's totally copying me. THat drives me off the wall. If i was trying to start a new trend it would be really cool. but i'm not. I'm the orignal. and soon nobody will think of me as the person that wears pink but as somebody that goes with flow. and i so don't.     Samie

      Today was intresting. I was basically around 5 guys today... all day. tyrece, robert, richard, terence and mike. It was srudent reconition night and this all basically took place during the setting up of student reconition night.  things that happend   tyrece   tyrece won the raffle thingy this morning. he got a t.v. but then he got suspended during lunch. but he didn't care couse he left the building with a t.v in his hand. haha lol.   mike   ha ok so alot of stuff happend with him. umm they kept telling me that terence liked me n then mike would pretend to call terence and say that i like him and that i love him. but i really thought he was talking to terence. so i started freaking out becouse for one he made that up. I don't like terence. i mean i don't like him in that way. i think hes cool n everything but still. and i was all worried becouse i was ganna see him l8r n i didn't want to be mean to him about it. N then mike was like u better get ready couse ur having a date with him. and u guys r ganna.... and he didn't say anything but he was like acting out it. and basically im just hoping u know what im saying couse i can't axplain it with out showing it. mike kept asking if i would go out with robert n i was like uh.... and then thank god couse robert was like no. and i was ganna say no but i didn't want to be mean. and then he was like what about richard. n richard likes me so i didn't want to be mean so i was like "i wouldn't go out with any of you guys couse umm i would never see u" and i felt really bad about him. and then mike kept putting his hand on my head. to get me mad couse i didn't like it. o n then jesus was smiling at me n i was like why r u smilig at me n mike was like couse he likes u n then he was like "we all like you... except for me" (and then l8r on my mom told me that he asked her for a pic of me)mike got sent home though. becouse he was running around and not behaving and all this other stuff.    robert  robert... he's uh cool but he kept wanning my to sit next to him n stuff but w/e. ok sooo i hung out with him alot too. n everytime i went to go do sutin every single person their would be like "can i go, can i go" i love it. im so popualr their lol. but any way alot of the time robert would come wit me becouse for one i didn't mind him n for 2 it got him away from mike. (mike some how makes everybody else miss behave so ya)most of the time. but sumtimes mike would fallow and uh it wouldn't be good. like they would run throught out the school. adn mike thinking he was so tuff would be like "don't ever run away from me agian". and blah blah blah but whatever, so to get robert away from mike my mom was just like " sam u n robert go for walk. n i was like ok" n i told him if he didn't get into trouble i would give him candey. but un fourtanely he did and he still took the candy. but anyway mike followed with richard and they started running. so OF COURSE robert runs. and i was just like PLEASE don't run PLEASE. couse they r just out of controle. but they ran all the way down to my moms office and then they bothh took like handfuls of the candy. but the mike n robert both ran off and richard was about to fallow but uhh i used my sweet charm lol to get him not too. and as we went up we herd my mom SCREAMING  at robert n mike. n i was like "see rn't u glad ur not with them" he was like "ya" but then ya. and then me n robert went into the computer room and then i dunno wut i said but he was ok becouse u r smarter and better then me. n u smell alot better then me too. lol.... n then l8r he told me i should get my tubes tied. but i just ignored that becouse um y in the world should i get my tubes tied? also robert kept putting his hand on my head. i dunno y. actually he's the one that started it but when he was doing it he didn't mean to be annoying. Then wen he was leeving he was like "don't worry i wont tell" as in he wont tell that i like terrence (but i don't like terence) and i was like "tell what.. theres nothing to tell" then he left and his aunt was like "keep him in order" in a joking way. lol    richard   ha ok so richard likes me. and uhh i kno this becouse he asked my bro if i had b/f. lol. so ya i pretty much wrote about all the story about him  above. except sometimes he would just look at me when i wasn't looking but i could see it throught the corner of my eyes. ha guys dont think i kno. i dont even think he knows that i kno that he likes me.   terence   ok so terence likes me and ya. theres not much too it. he didn't really tlk to me that much. but u kno i was around him alot. this doesn't really have to do with terenece but again i ran into hand troubles lol chelsea. ok ur probelebly confuseed right now. but i always have problems with the hand shakey fist things lol. but any way terences twin, eric did one of those fist thing but i had really no idia wat he was doing becouse he had a cookie in his hand so it was like uh what. but luckly vanessa was like eric and she did it to show me what he wanted n i was like oh ok. lol n then i did. im so out of it with thoose stupid things. lol i have problems with them. nobody ever do one of those hand shakey fist things to me lol.  other stuff about today,,,,  ummm this girl ashley kept following me. my brother was kind of acting really bad. i think he was kind of jelouse couse everybody wanted to be around me more then him. and uhh this red head girl was driving me insane. and uuhh  i kno more stuff happend today but i cant think so if i do remember ill add it.  samie

       Hey!!! I'm defently going to the usher concert! i have to pay though but thats fine it onlii costs $65.  but the part that sux is i might not be able to go to my uncles soccer game. -tear-. See the game is on the 20th and the concert is on the 21st. We are going to new york on the 20th to see the game and then we are sleeping over there at a hotel so then i might not be able to get back to newtown in time to go to the concert. So ther i'm probably ganna have to skip the game. And the games are always awesome... last time me and my bro got to ride in ther travel bus! it was awesome! it would really suck if i didn't get to go! but it would really really suck if i didn't go and then my family got back in time and i would have been able to come back in time!! err!       also u know what sux We go back to school on august 31st and danbury goes back to school september 5th. AND they went into the summer way earlier then us like a week and 2 days and now there getting to go l8r. THAT SUX!

        Hey omg this is real funny my mom has gone on strike as in she is no longer a mother or something! isn't that stupid. konrad said that she cant yell at us or nag us about our rooms. but the thing is we have to clean everything. we cant leave messes we have to help aLot more. he said if we dont halp then we cant use the house meaning as we cant use the bathroom and stuff. So my plan is im not going to be here for all that crap. im going over friends houses! like yesterday this whole strike thing started and i went to zoes and i cleaned her half of the room. so now her whole half is all clean and then we put tape down the middle of the room which ment aria was not aloud to leave any of her crap on that side. lol.... and then we went to the movies with courtney and jessica. we saw van helsing and it ad to be the most boring movie ever. but i had so much fun becouse i threw popcorn at people and then i forgot to turn my cell phone off and spencer called it so in the middle of the movie confessions started going off. so i sang to it lol! yeah and then like 3 times this guy in front of us kept telling us to shut up and evertime hee said that i would stick my tunge out at him. it was so funny. so after the movie courtneys mom picked us up and we were just sitting in the parking alot for a lil while bc ashley and her mom were eating ice cream,. and olivia provey was just staring at us so mrs. luara waved at her it was so funny, so yeah then she dropped me and zoe off at zoes house and we watched sacarry movie three. so i got one day down as not being at my house only 6 more days left lol. so yeah im bored and if u guys wanna do something with me i would defently be able to! call me  Samie

      If you really care... here are my test results... lol     My life is rated G.  What is your life rated?   lol my life is rated G. wow i guess im the type of a girl a parent would like. oh well. i'm cool with that. lol... wow i'm such a good girl ________________________________________  and my iq is 122  oh yeah... im so smart... except last time i took it i got a 126. I'm getting stupider... lol ________________________________________  What type of friend am i ? I'm a Caring Confidant. o yeah! what is that lol? No doubt about it — you're the sweetheart of your crew. Always looking out for your friends, you know that they've got your back too. Loving and loyal, you see no difference between friends and family, which is why people always feel comfortable coming to you when things aren't going their way. They know you'll be there. You're always willing to put yourself in other people's shoes, a trait that helps you understand where people are coming from. This is what makes your friends trust your judgment and advice — they know you'll love them no matter what happens. And that's what friends are for. ________________________________________  Does Your Self-Esteem Need a Makeover?   MY self-esteem is In Great Shape! Good for you! Your self-esteem looks pretty healthy to us! Maybe you don't consider yourself a total rock star, but our guess is that others do! Regardless of what other people think, you know that you're pretty darn great. You also know that a big part of feeling good and looking good is taking care of yourself and treating your body right. The key is in your attitude and not freaking out when you don't get the greatest grade on a test or when someone else has the same outfit on as you. You take it in stride and see that it's the big picture that matters most. Your mature and confident approach will surely take you straight to the top in anything you do. Congrats! Keep it up! ________________________________________ so yeah. Sam

       Yesterday was fun and not fun. i kept getting into fights with my mom mom and spencer but besides that it was cool...    My two little cousins came over on konrads side of the family so they r not blood related. Infact they arn't even blood related to konrad but anyways since they r 8 and 5 we went to Quassy and Zoe came too so i wouldn't be bored.    I found out that the 8yr old cousin, Seth kind of likes me lolz. He always is looking at me from around a corner or something and then i would  turn around and he would hide it was so funny. Me and Zoe were crakin up.    At Quassy we didn't do much well i didnt... Me and zoe went on that swing ride and then we had a water balloon fight. And we went on the marry go round like 3 times lolz. And we got our pictures tacken too. And i went on that lil baby helicopter ride and down that flush slide thing...    Then today Konrad's Work had a picnic and we went. Except i didnt want to go becouse me and my bro kept fighting but i was forced to go... so I wasn't in the mood so as soon as i got there i just went to this huge rock and layed on it out in the sun. But eventelly my mom came over and picked me  up off the rock and carried me over to this rock climbing wall and then bot konrad to take my feet and my mom took my arms and they were dragging me to the wall. and my shoes fell and this kid went and got them for me. Thats wen it started... The kid sort of liked me He was 13 going on 14 and kind of wierd. my mom could totally tell he liked me so she kept teasing. er and yeah it ws kind of intresting... so yeah.     ttyl    samie

       Hey Today i went to the mall with zoe today it was so fun! I was looking for a top for the usher concert and again didnt find one but i did find a shirt that said 'please hung me, Dont eat me' and it had a picture of a pig on it.    Well me and zoe went to CVS and got a disposable camera and we went around all these stores and acted really weirdly but it was so fun. we got pictures of each other doing stupid stuff. lol. like trying on these ugly hads or wearing thoses fluffy boa things. with the feathers. We went into Saphora and i did a Jessica Simpson pose. I took the  edible cream stuff, put some on my finger and did wat she did in her advertisement.  Zoe took a picture of it.  Then we took one of thoose water things and sprayed each other with them. It was so fun!     Then at claires i took tons of scarfts and did this super model pose. oh yeah. And then Zoe put on a 'Mrs. Kutcher' hat and i snaped a shot.    Then we went on the carosel. We took pictures of that too. We were having so much fun! acting like we were really on horses. lol.   I was planning on having zoe sleeping over but when she got here i started getting into fights with my mom and spencer and konrad and she had to go home. God i hate that. Spencer started the whole thing he is such a loser!   Well thats all for now. ill write l8r...  Samie

        Just got back from killing this huge spider that had fangs and totally freaked me out. i got so scared wen i saw it in my sink. i sprayed it with the fouset hose thing and bernt it too! i was totally freakin!     Tomarow i might go to the mall with zoe. I have to get a top for the usher concerT! i cant find one any wheres!    Also the day b4 school starts zoe might sleep over! yeah fun! we will get ready for the first day of the last year of middle school together and just hang out. it would also be totally awesome if she was in my cluster and in my homeroom! Wayyyy coools.     Man it would really suck if i got Autumn in my cluster. I mean shes nice but i can onlii take so much of he and she has SAA (smelly, afro armpits) ew.... smelly. Also i found out ian is staying back so i hope hes not in my cluster to... along with edgardo... i defently hope hes not in my cluster again.. icks. Eww it would really suck if Emily Crewson was in my cluster! she is such a snob and she thinks she is just so hott. i dont know why everybody pretends to like her. nobody does but everybody acts like they r best friends with her. its so stupid. in fact i have never met one person who has said anything nice about that freak.   I hope there are all my friends in my cluster like zoe as i already said and courtney and rachel T and C, and Kluga and Krystal! And courtney and Becky and michele... and lauren. and so many more!   Well i guess thats it for now    Samie
