       "Oh Mexico, sounds so simple I might just have to go" - James Taylor  Today I went to Progresso, Mexico, and while I dreaded going, it wasn't all that bad.  We ended up parking on the American side of the bridge and walking across the river into this one street marketplace with booths set up all along the way on either side.  We first stopped in this huge store which had almost everything, from wallets to guitars, from swords to saddles, it was pretty cool.  Then we walked along the street, looking to see what the vendors had for sale.  Many of them had these fake Oakley sunglasses, and i thought it was pretty funny how desperate they were to sell them, one vendor went from ten dollars down to four.  Well i didn't give in to temptation, and i did not buy any glasses, mostly because i wasn't planning on getting anything while i was there.  But my grandmother was determined to get me something from Mexico and bought me this white shell necklace, which i am pretty sure I will never wear, but oh well.  Well then, she made me put it on, and i did, just to make her happy, and now, well, i cant figure out how to get it off.  So i am still wearing it five hours later, feeling like a total idiot.  Enough of that.     How can so little stuff = so much happiness  While in Progresso i wandered off of the main road for a little bit, and it was like i had stepped into a whole different world.  The roads were dirt, the houses were shabby, back yards were non-existent, and the front yard was the road.  Electricity was pretty much an extention cord running from your neighbors house.  But all of the people i saw, adults and kids alike, seemed to be happy.  Kids riding bikes, father and son playing catch, families going for walks, and all of them seemed happy.  So I had a revelation, it isn't things that make you happy, despite what our society wants us to believe, it is the friends and family around you, and the knowledge that no matter how bad life may be or seem, God will always pull you through.     3 hours of fun  For those who say you cant be a little kid again, i resent that.  I spent three freakin hours on a trampoline today and it was as fun now as it was five.  That's all i wanted to say, except the way your legs feel after you get off is just now wearing off.

       Boring!  Man, today I did absolutely nothing and hated every minute of it.  I was so bored!  I guess the one thing I had some fun with was watching the Two Towers.  That is such a great movie, all of the battle scenes and the stuff.  If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out (cough cough shani).  Haha, oh well.  Other than that it was a very boring day.  Not much to do, nothing i really felt like watching on TV, and nothing i really felt like reading.  I am really starting to miss home, well at least I would have stuff to do there.  But no, i am stuck here for at least four more days and to make things worse my parents want to drag me along to Mexico tomorrow.  Agh, no me gusta.

       I say no, you say...yes?  I talked to michelle about the "pretty" guitar I saw (see below) and told her what I thought about it.  Well apparently she disagreed with me. BenMCF419: guitars were made to rock on, how can you rock on a guitar with flowers on it BenMCF419: it just doesnt happen Olie27: a girl can  BenMCF419: im not even sure a girl can BenMCF419: rockin on a flowery guitar.  its like an oxy-moron Olie27: no its not, have you seen 2fast 2furious?  BenMCF419: no Olie27: they are like hard core race car driving and the girl has a really girly car, i dont see why a guitar is any different  BenMCF419: oh it is BenMCF419: i dunno how, but it is Olie27: no its not  Olie27: you just want to contridict me, and it won't happen  BenMCF419: i can contridict you anytime michelle, besides im right Olie27: you think you are right? okay okay, here i go.. If you rock on a guitar, you have a certain image, an image that is all tough and 'macho' if you will. well, when you race cars like they did in 2fast 2furious, they had an image of all tough and 'macho' you think there is a difference, there is only a difference if you see it, and you obviously do not see, you may have looked, but not see, and not seeing can lead you to go somewhere you don't want to go, like into a convo about floral guitars and girly cars  BenMCF419: haha BenMCF419: you present a good case michelle, but i have asked my uncle his opinion (and he is a very good guitarist) and the two do not relate at all.  I realize that the car and the guitar can both voice your image.  But there is one thing you do with cars and that is drive them.  guitar on the other hand you play music and there are many different types of music, but there is none to justify you playing a floral guitar Olie27: who says you can't rock on with the kind of guitar you want? who has made it a rule that a girl (or perhaps a homosexual man) wants to make some hard core rock on any kind of guitar they choose? we are talking about music yes, so why does the image of the guitar matter so much?  BenMCF419: because the guitar makes the musician.  just like if it is a crappily made guitar that produces crappy music and that makes the musician sound bad.  well if it is a crappy looking guitar it will make the musician look bad.  the image of the musician is all important and that is why, no matter who it is, it is unaccpetable for a musician to play a floral type guitar BenMCF419: it ruins the image Olie27: usually people who like to rock on or listen to the guitar usually don't care about an image, they are rarely the people who care about how they look, like some ppl at school. therefor, the rockee wouldn't care about the image of ther rocker cuz he is enjoying the music. image has nothing to do with the musician  BenMCF419: there are many people who will not buy a product from someone because they dont agree with the others beliefs, or actions, ect.  the image of a rocker has to do with that also.  how far do you think the beatles would have gotten if they had looked like a bunch of hobos?  not far.  the people, whether they realize it or not care about the image a musician portrays Olie27: are we talking about the beatles, in those days days was like flowers and drugs and stuff? or like, 99.5 kiss  BenMCF419: the beatles as in arguably the greatest rock group ever BenMCF419: well, carolyn agrees with you, but shanis on my side Olie27: yes, but lived in the times of the 60's and that was the time of peace, flowers, and drugs and stuff  BenMCF419: but pretty much revolutionized the world of rock and roll Olie27: and brought flowers with them  BenMCF419: john lennon played a white rickenbacher guitar, one that is now fameous in the world of rock and roll, paul mccartney played a violin style bass, george harrison played a gibson les paul, and ringo played the drums BenMCF419: flowers were not involved Olie27: are we debating on weither we can rock with flowers? or wiether "pretty guitars suck" cause thats what started this, and what you just described to me where pretty guitars, and you just told me that they are admired  BenMCF419: maybe pretty is to general a word, because yes, the guitars the beatles played are all very very nice guitars, but today at a music store i saw a purple guitar with flowers and glitter all over it, i talked to the owner of the store and told him that he should burn it, because no one could honestly rock out on that guitar and besides, it was pretty in a very ugly way

       One of those days...In a good way  Ever have one of those days where you did absolutely nothing the whole time, but had a lot of fun doing it?  Well, despite being in McAllen for the next week and having to spend time with a whole bunch of family, today was one of those days.  It started out sleeping till 10:30 (mostly because I was up until 2:00) and then playing video games for an hour.  We then went to a sports restaurant and watched the cowboys game on the biggest TV I have ever seen, and then went and played a bunch of guitars at music stores.  But the thing that really made my day was getting to drive my uncles Chrysler (which I found out goes really fast).  We then ate dinner and I have now been watching the Steelers vs Ravens game for the past three hours.  Fun day!   Pretty guitars suck!!!  I swear, what were they thinking when they made pretty purple electric guitars with flowers on it?  Sheesh, electric guitars were made to rock on!  Who is going to pick up a guitar with flowers and glitter on it and start playing AC/DC?  No, im sorry, it just doesn't work that way.  I told the owner that he should take it home and burn it and he said he didn't like it either and that he would consider it.  Oh I hope he does, for the sake of all electric guitars, I hope he does.

      So I went and saw the lord of the rings movie again and though it is probably the longest thing I have ever sat through, it is also the best movie I ever saw.  So to all you doubters like michelle and Stephanie, you are wrong, it is the greatest movie ever.  Well she has moved on, is it time for me to do the same?  I dont know yet.  I promised that i would tell her when i stopped liking her and she said she would do the same.  Well, she's told me and worried that i was upset about it, but come on, how could i be upset at stephanie dang?  So i am still mcallen and still as bored as ever.  We went to a wildlife refuge today, and it was kinda cool and everything but there was one problem.  There wasnt any wildlife to be seen.  I think the most wild thing i saw throughout the whole walk was a lizard, or maybe a squirrel.  Haha, oh well, only 6 days till i get to go back home.

      Ok so i finally broke down and created a blog.  No one knows yet, and frankly, i dont care if anyone finds out.  The main reason i created it was because i was bored as hell down here in the valley while we were visiting family and i couldnt think of anything better to do.  so here i am...creating my blog...crap i cant think of anything else to say so i am done

      Well, i suppose its been a while since i have written anything of significance, and unfortunatly i dont have anything of significance to write now.  Today was a decent day, not great but decent.  It started out with swimming, and how can any day be good if it starts with swimming, haha just kidding.  Then i had a very not productive morning, but 3rd period was cool.  Mrs Baucum is a crazy old lady who doesnt know how to teach, but all of the people in that class are cool.  I walked with Shani to her english class and then ate lunch, my lunch and then half of tylers.  We played some hack and eric got pegged in the balls and was on the ground for 5 minutes.  Good laugh, but he was hurting so i helped him up and we continued.  5th sucked, 6th...well lets just say, if you have 4 siblings, your high school is not the place for them.  I had a junior college seminar during 6th period that my mom insisted on coming to, and since shes to cheap to get a babysitter, the rest of my family came too.  Ah, well enough about that.  7th was charles darwin.  And 8th i suppose was the most fun i had all day.  I went to the orchestra room with Stephanie and Emily and had a couple chair races, played some 21, and listened to them practice.  It was good and i got to meet Stephanie Dang's "other half" Stephanie Lee, and she seemed nice.  Shani gave me a ride to practice where i skipped half of the workout, and that just about sums up my day.  Sorry if i bored you to death.

       Districts   Ok, so I finally got my first sectionals time, a 2:01 in the 200 IM, and am only a half second off of another in the 100 backstroke.  It was a really really good meet for everybody, I am so glad that everyone swam well.  Both guys and girls got first in the district, and the guys did it by only losing 2 events the whole meet!  I am now going to name my guy and girl swimmer of the meet:  first, matt Sanchez.  He was absolutely amazing getting 8th with a 55 in the 100 free going into finals, and then defeating all odds by getting 4th in finals and going a 53.  His coach had pulled him from the relays, but after his outstanding performance had no choice but to put him back in.  Congrats matt, see you at regionals!  And my girl swimmer of the meet has to be Stephanie Dang!  After worrying so much about not doing to well, she got 7th in prelims.  Then, from lane one, beat out yet another person and got 6th and has made regionals!  The great thing was, the first thing she said when she got out of the water was, "I beat the girl who kicked me in the face in polo!"  Well, she then hauled butt in the 400 free relay and split a 59.5.  Congratulations Stephanie!!! You were awesome!

       GROUND ZERO!!!!!  Where can i start but to say that it was probably the greatest weekend of my life.  The speaker was Travis Crim and he delivered such an awesome message, i didnt find myself getting bored but was actually looking forward to each of the things he said next.  He was funny, but he spoke with such an enthusiasm...well he was awesome.  And the band, the band was great too.  If you have never heard of jonah werner, look him up.  He was an awesome guitar player, an awesome singer, and the songs he sang delivered such an impact, you couldnt help but stand up and praise god!  Anyways it was so awesome!  I am really sore because i played ultimate and football and basketball all weekend though.  Oh well, it was well worth it.   Stuff that made my weekend great   "Disperse!!!  Man your mattresses!!!" - we (the junior guys) tried to take over the 8th graders cabin with matteresses  "You smell like UpDog." "Huh?  Whats UpDog?" "Not much!  Whats up with you!" - Haha, stupid i know, but you would think its funny too, at 1:30 in the morning  "I am hitting you in the face with 3,000,000 candles!!!" - Kevin Clark brought a flashlight, well more like a spotlight that was as powerful as 3,000,000 candles, it was great.  "-and WERSHIP!!!" - haha, jonah werner and his accent  "AAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!  Its the Vietkahn!!!" - Last night, we were up till two doing a sort of vietnam war reinactment, sound effects and running around the room and kevins flashlight   Travis Crim  Jonah Werner  Katherine Mcullouh  Tim Hamillton and Jesse Minor  Group #49  Ultimate Frisbee, Football, Basketball, Capture the flag  And of course, the sole purpose that this weekend happened...Jesus Christ!!!

      Here's the whole song from last time:  I know it's been some time but there's something on my mind You see I haven't been the same since that cold November day. You said we needed space but all I found was an empty place  And the only things I learned is that I need you desperately. So here I am and can you please tell me:  Where do broken hearts go can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there? And if somebody loves you won't they always love you? I look in your eyes and I know that you still care for me.  I've been around enough to know that dreams don't turn to gold And that there is no easy way no you just can't run away. And what we had was so much more than we ever had before And no matter how I try you're always on my mind. So here I am and can you please tell me:  Where do broken hearts go can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there? And if somebody loves you won't they always love you? I look in your eyes and I know that you still care for me.  And now that I am here with you I'll never let you go I look into your eyes and now I know now I know:  Where do broken hearts go can they find their way home Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there? And if somebody loves you won't they always love you? I look in your eyes and I know that you still care for me  Good song   Friday  Its been a while since i last posted and a lot has happened so im not to sure where to start.  School of course has been going on and that hasnt been all that bad.  Report card looked good, so like i said, not that bad.  Friday night me, emily, and stephanie dang went to EZ's and then to world market, and i still cant figure out what is so great about that store.  Oh well, stephanie and emily had a great time looking at all of the kitchen stuff and putting on lotion and whatever else you do in that place.  I will admit i enjoyed looking at all of the prints.  There were some really great paintings and photos in the mix, and Stephanie found one that she really liked a lot.  After that we went to mikes and stayed there for about 5 minutes before he had to go, so we moved on and went to joeys house.  He was real excited to see us (no not really, he couldnt wait till we left).  But anyways we stayed there for an hour and told stupid blond jokes, and at one point i went inside to get matches and when i came out stephanies car was no longer in the driveway, and for a minute (dont tell stephanie) i had really thought they had left.  Turns out they had just parked up the road and hid in the bushes.  Haha, oh well.     Sat.  Then the swim meet last night, i swam ok, not great, but ok.  I tied my best time in the IM and added a second in the 100 back and swam in the 200 medly relay.  There were some who did reall well, like colton went a 4:59 500 free, and stephanie got 3rd in her 50 free with a 27.  But the greatest part of the night was watching mark swim.  He swam the 100 free where he floated a 55, then he counted for joeys 500, and couldnt figure out how to do it so davis and the offical had to help him out, that was funny, and then he swam the 100 breaststroke and he looked around the pool every time he took a breath.  Ah, it was great.     Sunday  Church this morning was great.  We sang some really good songs in UP, and then we had a good sunday school.  My teacher told us his thoughts about dating and courting, and how each and every one of the guys in his class has the perfect girl out there waiting for them, just like we are waiting for her.  It just takes time, patiance, and faith in god for you to find her, and when you do, you will know it.

       Jumpin in the rain  You wouldnt think that jumping on a trampoline with a whole bunch of little kids would be all that fun, especially since they would get in your way all of the time, but it was actually quite enjoyable.  And to make it all that much better, we had the sprinkler on also so that we were all soaking wet.  Amazing that it is the 2nd of januray and i have gone swimming in the ocean and played in the sprinkler already, both of which things many people will not do till the summer.  Anyways, i probably stayed on the trampoline for at least two hours, maybe more, doing all sorts of flips and twists.  Hah, yeah right, i couldnt do either of those if my life depended on it, but it was still fun!   Returning tomorrow!  While i will admit it has been more fun than i expected, staying down here for a week, i am ready to come home.  I have missed seeing certain people, and i have actually missed swimming a little bit.  Yeah yeah i know, i go on and on aboput how much i hate it, but i have gained 10 pounds since i came, so i need to get back in the water.  And another bright note, the cowboys play tomorrow at 8 on ABC, and i know all of you guys will be watching it, cheering them on as they play the panthers.  This game will probably detirmine my mood for the next few days, so better hope they win!

       Memorable 1st day  So the first day of the new year was a fun one.  We first went to the beach at South Padre Island and actually went swimming.  The water was a wonderful 65 degrees, but once you got in and your body went numb, you couldn't really tell how cold it was.  And, for all those that didn't know, i can surf, and i did today.  My cousin had an old surfboard collecting dust in the garage, so i took it and waxed it and caught some major waves.  Haha, i exaggerate, of course they weren't major, come on we are in Texas, there are no waves here.  Nonetheless, the waves weren't all that bad and i had a few good runs.  It was great because i hadn't really surfed since i lived in California and that was 4 years ago.  But its kind of like riding a bike, it all comes back to you.   Guitars, Guitars  As is the norm nowadays, i went to a music store today and played a bunch more guitars.  I have also decided what kind of guitar i would like to get next: a natural wood flavored Fender Stratocaster with a crystal black pickguard and black switches.  Sounds nice right?  Haha, well i think so.  Now its just a matter of coming up with the mulah to buy it.   Can I drive yet?  And speaking of money, i have to come up with some cash quick if i want to get my drivers license because my parents are going to make me pay for my insurance.  And since, well, it isn't all that cheap, i also have to decide if it is worth it to me to drive, or if i would rather hold on to the money (of course i don't have anything else to spend it on).

       Happy New Year!  Happy new year to everyone, i hope that its a good one!  My new years eve was fairly uneventful, but pleasant all the same.  Now i am just listening to the fireworks and the cars zooming by honking, and well, honestly i am not all that excited about it.  Tomorrow (my bad, today) is just going to be another day.   Thinking about Miss Perfect  Last night i was asked a couple of questions that really got me thinking.  What if the perfect girl comes along and you let her slip away?  What if the perfect girl for you doesn't think you are the perfect guy for her?  And so the more i thought about it, the more i realized: what if i have already let the perfect girl get away?  And if i think she is perfect, but she apparently doesn't, can she be perfect for me?

       Ultimate Taper  It's about time, i mean how long have i been waiting for taper to come?  2 weeks?  Well its  finally here and i have never been more excited.  This morning our practice was about 2000 yards, but even that was too much for me, so jeff and i cut it down to..oh, about 1200.  And this afternoon we went to practice and jeff was like, "ben, do you really want to swim?"  I said not really so we went to his house and played halo for 2 hours.   5 DAYS!!!   Cured  Except for the occasional cough, im pretty much cured.  Antibiotics are wonderful things!  No more runny nose, no more green snot, and no more coughing my guts out.  Ive had this thing for over 3 weeks now and it ruined my regionals (not that i would have done any better if i hadnt had it) and it probably ruined my taper (no, wait...i did that myself) ah, well i am just glad to get rid of it.  There is so much more to talk about, but i have to save all of that for later.   If someone says goodbye to you, is it so hard to say goodbye back!?!?

      zswert7487: wanna tell someone u love them but cant...ya not easy   never...ending...sport..  Will swimming never end?  I really doubt it, i mean there are still 9 days left!  And 3 of those include a major swim meet.  End already!!!!   Damn sinuses  The same thing i have had since before regionals i still have now.  I was diagnosed with a sinus infection a week ago and it hasnt gone away, so i am going to go to the doctor again tomorrow.  (which is a bit upseting because i will not get to see any of those people in the morning that i only get to see in the morning).  I hope i get over this before sectionals and it ruins my season all over again.

       I want taper!  I have actually been going to practice despite what others have been thinking (come on, me? a skipper?)  I showed up yesterday and mark elley tells me that i am going to do real practices for a while before i can taper for sectionals.  Worst news i ever heard.  So yeaterday i had to do countless 200s, this morning i had to do a bunch of 100s all out, and tonight i had to do 12 100s on the 1:25!  And i still have to finish off the week doing real, hard, workouts.  Well, at least i can say this:  12 more days of swimming and then i am done till next year!!!  (not including polo of course)   Who'd have thought  Amazingly enough, i actually have some pretty good grades for this six weeks.  I mean just ask anybody, these grades are a lot higher than the effort i put forth.  But im not complaining.  I had the chance to say what i was thinking, but i whimped out...i guess im afraid of upseting people

       Romeo and Juliet  Too bad their familes couldnt have gotten along, then i wouldnt have had to go and see that ballet.  Ah well, on the bright side, it was very well choreographed and my cousin was one of the leading roles.  He did very very well, he was in a bunch of the fighting scenes which were pretty cool.  But the guy that impressed me the most was this really tall red head who could jump like 8 feet in the air.  He was doing real good until the last scene when he jumped up and came down and just ate it!  I swear he hit the ground face first and the crowd just went OOOOOHHHH while he layed there for a second.  I was laughing to myself and i was sure he was hurt, but he stood right back up again and finished off the preformance.  I talked to him after the show and he had put ice on his knee, which he twisted on his fall.  I also found out why he could jump so high.  He was a really good basketball player who did ballet to keep in shape.  Whod have guessed that!?!   Smoothie King  After the show, my uncle and my cousin and I went to this place called smoothie King.  Now would you believe me if i told you that they had over 57 different flavors of smoothies?  Well they do (at least that is what they claim, i didnt count, i was too busy being impressed by the giant blenders) and they all have at least four different fruits in one flavor.  Well my uncle got the angel food flavor which consisted of strawberrys and bannas and mangos and something else which i dont recall, but all i could think of while he was ordering was angle food cake, so that one didnt sound to good.  I ended up getting Strawberry Kiwi Delight, which tasted a lot like oranges.  Oh well, it was real good.  The amazing thing about these smoothies was that, all they were was some liquid crap and ice blended up real well, and they charged 3.50 for a 20oz.  Hah, at least i wasnt buying.   Its only love...  I get high when I see you go by, My oh my, When you sigh, my, my inside just flies, Butterflies, Why am I so shy when I’m beside you? It’s only love and that is all, Why should I feel the way I do? It's only love and that is all, But it’s so hard loving you.  - The Beatles  Im sorry.  I wish i could be there for you always, and i feel like i have let you down when i cant.  It feels like i cant even talk to you anymore, and there is no worse feeling in the world.

       Stupid Stupid STUPID!  One of the good things about being in McAlllen for the weekend is i get to see some of my friends who i dont get to see very often.  Ironicly, what i will say here has already been said by stephanie. I saw one of my best friends today, and after we had gotten all of the formalities out of the way, the how are you, hows school, hows your family, he started telling me about how he spent the night at his friends house and drank so much he was throwing up the next morning and couldnt remember half of the night.  Let me pause for a moment and say why anyone would want to put themselves through all of that, for what?  just to be cool?  count me out.  anyways i interupted him and told him straight out that i didnt care, and then asked him why he had lowered himself to that level.  Well he didnt seem to have a meaningful answer, so i changed the subject and we moved on.  But it still bothered me the rest of the day till now, he is one of my best friends.  He used to be a really good guy, funny, a good leader, respectful to all of the adults, and he had my respect until today.   Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  Bestest band in the whole world.  And i finally got the CD that i wanted of them today, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes - Take a Break.  Its got 13 songs that came out in the 70s or so, and they took them and spiced them up in a way only a punk rock band can do.  Best song on there: Where do broken hearts go.   i think i love you so what am i so afraid of im afraid that im not sure of a love that theres no cure for i think i love you is that what life is made of though it worries me to say that i've never felt this way   - Less than Jake  appropriate?  maybe not.  or maybe so, after all its valentines day.

       Valentines Day (almost)  Ok, i stand corrected.  Maybe not so pointless.  I give props to brandon who gave allie a tulip for every class period, very nice.  The girls got creative and all gave each other gifts, and me?  Eh, i didnt give anything.   Bye Bye  One thing that ruined an otherwise good day was finding out that a friend was moving.  Lauren Guy is moving to Plano, Tx on tuesday.  I found out when she was walking down the hallway before first and i saw her and she was crying.  When she told me why, i couldnt believe it.  Im really sorry Lauren, but i'm really going to miss you...

       Man it sucks  It really bugs me that i get to see stephanie for a whole 5 minutes a day.  I mean, i used to see her before and after school, and i would get to walk with her to 6th and halfway to 7th.  But now the only time i ever get to talk to her is going from the lockers to the door at the end of the hall.  And after that, i find myself fretting over something stupid i said, or something i didnt say.   Valentines day  No me gusta.  Uh, im not going to get up on a soap box and preach like emily did, just let it be known that i think that it is an incredibly pointless holiday.

       So close...  Overall, i would say that its a good meet.  Clark girls and guys both got 3rd in the region.  Two of our swimmers won events and many others got second or third.  It was also a great meet for many of my WAVE friends.  It just wasnt a good meet for me.  And just when i had gotten over that, just when i had started to think about everyone else having a great meet, my parents had to say things like "well, why didnt you go faster" and "i wouldnt have let the presure get to me".  That was really upseting, but to make it all worse is the fact that not only did i miss state (not that i thought i would make it in the first place) but i missed it by a half second, 1 place.  Oh well, theres always next year.   200 Individual Medley (HALF A FREAKIN SECOND FROM STATE!!!)    1  Adam Montgomery  12  SARE  1:56.53  All-American      2  Jonathan Lane  11  SACH  1:56.74  All-American      3  Scott Trompeter  11  SARE  1:58.37  USA Sectionals      4  Blake Lavender  11  SAMD  1:58.48  USA Sectionals      5  Ben Cumnock-Francois  11  SACL  1:59.11  USA Sectionals      6  Andrew Belton  11  SACH  2:01.37  USA Sectionals      7  Brett Denham  12  SARE  2:04.10         8  Daniel Wolff  12  SARE  2:04.87

      I'll hurry and type before i fall asleep.  I got 2nd in the 200 IM, and finally broke the dreaded 2:00 mark by going a 1:59.11.  I came in 6th in the back going 57.51, but i missed sectionals by 3 tenths.  Very mad.  Ok, if you want to know more about how the team did, call me tomorrow (4799140)

       Bye Bye Birdie  What more can I say about the production that hasnt already been said?  It was extremely well done, everybody fit their part perfectly and everyone did a wonderful job.  Yeah, so i got a lot of crap from all of the swimming guys for going to this, but i am really glad i went, and besides i had friends that were in it and i didnt want to miss that.  Allie played one of the girls in Konrads fan club named Deborah Sue, and she played the part good.  Whoops, sorry stephanie, i mean she played the part well.  I really liked the curly hair, and her glasses fit in with the whole 50s look perfectly.  Stephanie, Emily, Lupe, and Mike all played in the orchestra, which sounded great.  Moquie (i think thats how you spell it), she was amazing.  Until not to long ago, i didnt even know that she did singing and dance, i had just known her from swimming, but she was unbelieveable in the role of rosie.  Good luck tonight all you bye bye birdie people!   Still Sick  Still coughing up green snot.  Still have a nose running non-stop.  Yesterday i had four people ask me if i was dying.  Yeah, im still sick, and worst of all i am getting other people sick.  We have regionals tonight, and now shani is starting to get sick too.  It's not cool, being sick, especially right before the meet you have worked all season to get to.  But its even worse when the people around you start to get sick too, and you know that its you who gave it to them.   Regioanls  Uh, well...warmups are in 2 hours and i am still not ready for this.  We got out of school after third, and i came home and started to get ready.  Silky smooth, thats all im going to say about that.  Well, this is what four months of hard training has worked toward, so all i can do is metally prep myself and do my absolute, upmost, all out, best.

      I can't pretend I don't care When you don't think about me - Simple Plan   Pnumonia, or something like it  Ok so its not pnumonia, but i have been coughing up crap from my cheast all day.  It was hard to sit through school, and even harder to swim.  I just hope that i get over this before regionals, i have had too many good swim seasons ruined my me getting sick.  Most recent, last year when i had pnumonia two weeks before my championship meet.   Regionals  Regionals is right around the corner, and im not ready for it.  Physicaly, i think im close.  I have been doing practices regularly, and i have been feeling good in the water.  Mentally, im not there yet.  I have visualized my races over and over and over again, but something just doesnt feel right.  I have some very stiff competition in the IM, and you might as well forget me even finaling in the backstroke, so...crap, only 2 more days!

       Super Bowl  Yeah, Pats won.  Im sorry to all emilys friends and family because they were all cheering for carolina, but the better team won.  I am also sorry for stephanie dang because she was so bored about halfway through the 3rd.  What can you do?  I dont show it, i dont let it show.  It's too complicated, i try to keep it in the back of my mind, but it wont stay there.  Half the time it makes me feel great, like im on a caffine high (hint) to think about it, the other half it makes me feel like crap cause i dont do anything about it.  My greatest fear is that ill leave it alone, that i wont step out and confront it, and that it will leave along with the remains of the summer.

I long to see the sunlight in your hair And tell you time and time again how much I care Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow Hello, I've just got to let you know  'Cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying I love you...  Hello - I just got to let you know  'Cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying  HELLO   - Me First and the Gimme Gimmes

      We lost 11-5.  Yeah, it all went downhill in the 4th quarter but its ok, after all we were playing the senior team.  Highlights of the game:  Jeff Miller, he was freakin awesome;  eric's block on a breakaway and then his face block, so awesome;  i scored a goal, pretty cool;  and stevie's wild shots that dont look like they have a chance but somehow seem to go in.  The girls gave a real good effort, but lost 16-0.  I think with more time and practice they will turn out to be awesome.

      Today i went golfing for the first time ever and i found out that it is a lot harder than they make it look on tv.  My Uncle, my cousin, and i went to edinburg country club and played the front nine.  Luckly for me they had left handed clubs, otherwise i probably would have sucked worse than i did.  Anyways, on just about every tee shot my ball would slice to the left; there were actually a couple of occasions where i had to approach the green from an adjacent fairway for another hole.  Oh well, it was a lot of fun, and between only hitting the ball four feet and knocking it 100 yards over the green, i actually made a bogey on a par 4 (which was my bast hole all day).  Oh yeah, i suppose the scariest part of the outing was nearly killing my uncle with my slice.  He was about 50 yards down the fairway from me and way to the left, and i purposely aimed right so i wouldnt hit him.  Well, i should have guessed this would happen, but the ball sliced to the left and came within 3 feet of taking his head off.  Haha, but my uncles cool and doesnt let much phase him so we all got a good laugh out of that.  I dont know whats going down right now, everyone seems to be upset at everyone else.  Anyways, thank you allie for what you said.  You felt that it needed to be said and you said it.  I respect that because its something i never have the guts to do.

      At the begining of the week everyone left to go on vacation somewhere, whether it was stephanie and michelle going off to colorado for their ski trip, or shani flying to NY, or davis going up to North Texas somewhere.  Then i left to go to McAllen and everyone came back.  Now i wont get to spend any of my spring break with them cause i dont come back till sunday and we have school the next day.  If you have never heard of Al Di Meola, i dont blame you because before last night i had no idea who he was either.  Al Di Meola is a jazz guitarist who has been playing some crazy long time like 37 years.  Anyways, he ran a guitar clinic last night that my uncle took me and my cousin to.  I didnt learn anything, but it was pretty interesting and Al ws real funny.  And he could...whats the word...ah, shred, he could shred on the guitar, which is the guitarists term for playing really really really fast.  Yeah, so i am a slacker, i know it.  I ran today for the first time since i dont know when, and that the only exercise i have done besides pushing buttons playing mario kart.  Anyways, my uncle and i went to a park with a track around it that was 8 tenths of a mile long.  His normal lap pace was 7:30 per lap, but i decided that was to slow so we were holding a 6:10 lap pace.  After 4 laps we stopped for water and then ran till we hit 30 minutes.  Altogether we ran about 4 miles, and i am feeling it now (really really sore, and this is only 3 hours later.  I dont know what it is.  For some reason when i talk to stephanie i cant think of the right words to say or i dont say what i really want to.  It used to be so easy, i could just talk to her, but things have changed i guess.    It has been brought to my attention that i like to post songs.  And i do.  So i will.  I've been down wandering past 2nd street and looking at the ghosts of you and me and thinking back on all those memories of how we used to be  I've been hearing hear those voices of the noises of the breaking glass and all those plans we had to get us through they're never coming true  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  The ghosts of you and me 'cause I'm just a long-gone memory and you're still alive and I'm still getting by on these dead end streets the ghosts of you and me  I'm still talking talk of what we'll do to the ghosts of me and you and I'm still looking back into the past when we were all we had  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  The ghosts of you and me 'cause I'm just a long-gone memory and you're still alive and I'm still getting by on these dead end streets the ghosts of you and me  - Less than Jake

      As I walk along I wonder what went wrong With our love, a love that was so strong And as I still walk on I think of the things we've done Together, while our hearts were young I'm a-walking in the rain Tears are falling and I feel the pain Wishing you were here by me To end this misery, I wonder I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder, why Why-why-why-why-why She ran away, and I wonder Where she will stay My little runaway A-run-run-run-run-runaway  - Me First and the Gimme Gimmes

      Its been a while since i have posted, so heres a brief recap of the past couple of days:   Friday  Firday night Emily, Brandon, and I went to California Pizza Kitchen and the Passion of christ.  Dinner was good, and the movie was well...hard to watch.  It was a great movie, it delievered a very deep message, but it also showed very profoundly the extent of christs suffering.  There were a few parts that i wasnt able to watch because they were so violent.  One of them was when they put Jesus on the cross and nailed his hands down; Emily turned to me and said "Oh, i really hope they dont use nails!"  I dont think either of us watched that part.  After the movie we saw jeff in the parking lot and he honked and drove off.  Me and brandon were sure that we saw a girl in the passenger seat, so brancon calls up jeff and says "who is that attractive young lady in the seat next to you?"  Turns out that it was jeffs sister, so we all had a good laugh over that.   Saturday  Saturday, my family went over to my parents friends house to help them pack because they are moving to Florida.  After a couple of hours of doing that, i went home and got ready for the Rampage Hockey game.  It was me, Julio, Brandon, Allie and her friend Allison, and Emily.  When we walked in we got these really cool blow up noise maker thingys that we used not to cheer for the team, but to beat the crap out of each other.  In fact, we got up on the jumbotron twice while doing so.  It was a good game, we had a suite with free drinks and snacks, and really good seats, and we also won in OT.  After the game we went to Baskin Robins and hung out for a bit and then went home.   Sun and Mon  Sunday doesnt deserve its own column because it was such a boring day.  I was asked to babysit sibs rather than go to church so that was my day till 11, then at 1 we went downtown and watched my sister do some irish dance for a St Patricks day parade.  One cool thing was Josh Davis was the grand marshal for the parade, i would have never guessed that he was of irish descent.  Random note: while there i saw Maquie and her sister Ines (or however you spell their names).  We then got Ice cream, and after that went to Habeneros, and that was sunday.  Today, after a lot of drama about the house being a mess, we drove down to mcallen.  I drove, but its not good driving.  Its really long, really boring, and it poured rain the whole way down.  Thats it.

      I don't know what it is that makes me love you so  I only know I never wanna let you go 'Cos you started somethin' oh can't you see That ever since we met you've had a hold on me. It happens to be true I only want to be with you. It doesn't matter where you go and what you do I wanna spend each moment of the day with you  Oh look what has happened with just one kiss  I never knew that I could be in love like this. It's crazy but it's true I only want to be with you. You stopped and smiled at me asked if I'd care to dance  I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance. Now listen honey I just wanna be beside you everywhere  As long as we're together honey I don't care. 'Cos you started somethin' oh can't you see  That ever since we met you've had a hold on me. No matter what you do I only want to be with you. I said I only want to be with you.   - Me First and the Gimme Gimmes

       ULTIMATE  Ok, the real story.  I was jumping up for the frisbee at the same time as Andrew Belton.  In an attempt to keep me from getting it, Belton lashed out with his elbow and got me in the face right below the eye and so now i have a bruise there.  Thats all that happened, no fight or anything.  Anyways, we played ultimate again today in the mud and rain, and that was a lot of fun.  Colton came by and played with us so it got real competetive.  I ate it more than a couple of times, but it was all worth it, i mean its ultimate frisbee!!!  Look into my eyes - you will see What you mean to me Search your heart - search your soul And when you find me there you'll search no more Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for You know it's true Everything I do - I do it for you  Look into my heart - you will find There's nothin' there to hide Take me as I am - take my life I would give it all I would sacrifice Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more Ya know it's true Everything I do - I do it for you  There's no love - like your love And no other - could give more love There's nowhere - unless you're there All the time - all the way  Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more I would fight for you - I'd lie for you Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you  Ya know it's true Everything I do - I do it for you

       For who it may concern...  For all of you guys who have been asking, or wondering, or didnt even know, YES!  I am colorblind!  That doesnt mean that i cant tell the difference between the grass and the sky, it means that i have trouble telling blue and purple, some reds and greens, and on occasion green and yellow, apart.  Its not the end of the world.  I am not physically handicaped or anything.  I am just colorblind.   ULTIMATE!!!  Finally, after all of these long months of waiting, we played ultimate frisbee today at WAVE.  I didnt play very well, i had a few defensive plays, and 4 touchdown passes, but no spectacular catches or great throws.  Oh well, like any sport i need to practice and this is something i havent done in a while.

       Sectionals  It was one really long weekend, but now that its all over i can finally say: NO MORE DAYS UNTIL THE END OF SWIMMING BECAUSE ITS ALL OVER!!!!  HELLO POLO!!!  Sorry, had to get that out.  I swam ok this weekend.  Not great, but ok.  Went a 53.9 in the 100 fly and got yet another sectionals time (woohoo, i have 3 now), 2:01.2 in the 200 IM and added 2 seconds, 58.04 in the 100 backstroke and added a half second, and a 2:01.06 in the 200 fly and dropped 2 seconds.  I also swam in the B medley relay when they converted the pool to long course and really sucked.  I warmed up in the diving well, which is 25 yards, and then they started the relays and when we were up i jumped in to swim backstroke.  I knew that it was going to be long, a lot longer than what i was used to, but i didnt know how long.  The first 50 went alright, i got to the wall about when i expected to, but on the second 50 i couldnt figure out when the wall was going to get there.  I kept saying to myself "its coming, its coming", but it never did.  So i picked my head up out of the water and tried to look behind me, and damn it! i was only halfway across the pool.  Oh well, i got a lot of grief about that from my coach and the guys on my relay.  Over all it was a good meet, when we werent swimming, we were playing halo.  I got almost no sleep whatsoever because we had some late night head to head slayer games, i guess its surprising i did as well as i did.     Annie Chandler  The greatest part of the weekend was Annie getting her Olympic Trials cut in the 100 breaststroke!  Yeah, the OLYMPIC TRIALS.  Its really weird now, knowing that i train with an olympic trialist.  But of all of the people i know, annie deserves it the most.  She is a really hard worker, and she is just an all around great person.  Congrats Annie!

      Yeah, again its been a long time since i have posted.  A little lazy i suppose, but a lot has happened in the past week.  We had a blast tonight though.  I dont want to write about all of it, so if you are interested read allies blog, but it was cool.  So, after school, I gave all allie a ride home and then we decided to go to shakes.  After that we went back to her house and watched harry potter, which i had never seen.  Good movie, but i still like lord of the rings better, and it sucked because i would ask questions, and then allie would be like "well, i guess you have to wait and see".  Grrrr.  After that we went to free scoop night as baskin robins with emily, weed, and stephanie, and after that we did the "run to weeds house".  But like i said, if you want to find out about that, read allies blog.

      Well, my birthday has come and gone.  It was pretty good, I got a really big balloon from Jessica (she wanted me to carry it around but i ended up putting it in my car, sorry jessica); i got a really...um, well i got a card from allie, we'll leave it at that, but thank you allie; and i got a shower of confetti from michelle and lupe in biology, numerous times.  But by far the most awesome gift i recived the whole day was in my locker that morning.  Well, the night before, stephanie called me and asked me my locker combo.  I kinda suspected something, but i forgot it all by the morning.  So when i opened my locker, there was an awesome card and a pan full of cup cakes YAY.  I also got my liscense so i can now drive my volvo, and one of these days i am going to give lupe that ride to school that i promised her.

      I don't know if its me letting things that may be nothing get under my skin, or the things that are bothering me really are a reality.  Things like people screwing around in practice and making joking insults are bothering me a lot more than they have in the past.  I think that my attitude change has pushed cretain people away, just like earlier in the year.  Whatever...

      Yay, the six weeks is finally over.  And we get a three day weekend to finish it off!  It's been a really long week, all my teachers were trying to cram tests in and i got my payment for being a slacker and had a ton of makeup work to do.  Carder is making us do a research paper, over what i dont know because she is stupid and didnt tell us, but i do know it has something to do with shakespere.  I had to make a cake for baucum, and well, it took me 3 hours tuesday night to make it but it actually turned out all right.  I had to make an egg too, i made a yellow racecar (which, racecar by the way, is spelled corectly forwards and backwards) which looked like crap, vbut hey, i got 10 points for it.  The only real constant has been water polo, and even that wasnt all that great this week.  With the accuplacer going on and Tyler getting an MRI for his back, we played 4 on 4 on tues with no goalie.  Yesterday we actually had enough to do 6 on 6 with a goalie, but stupid hooper and those darn algerians took up enough space that we couldnt get a real scrimage going.  Oh well, its over and next week is a new week.  I hear all this stuff about these banquets, and its all very confusing.  Jack coming up to me like, 8 times asking me if he has spelled my name right and then tells me he forgot how to pronounce it; and i think i have heard 3 different dates for it to be on, or maybe its that there are two different banquets.  Psh, i dont know.  But while im on the subject of banquets, allie asked me to go to the chior banquet with her, so that should be cool.    A bunch of guys went over to jeffs house last night and we played halo.  Talk about suck, it was me, brandon, steve, and clint vs jeff, sanchez, phil, and davis.  Basically 4 guys who have hardly ever played before vs 4 guys who play it practically 24/7.  In CTF brandon scored the first point (that was a shock) but then jeff and sanch took over and scored the next five, so yeah it was a slaughter.  After that we rolled the basketball hoop down to the street and played midnight basketball.  It was cool, except the bvall was dark blue and you couldnt really see it, so people were getting hit in the head a lot.  I came home and went to sleep, and then (this should be a shock to you brandon) i didnt go to practice.  Haha...  Anothernametono: I have achieved my goal, in six weeks i have only swam once!  Yeah jeff

       Guys Polo  Ugh!  So tired.  We had two games today and we won them both, yay.  The first one was against alamo hieghts and their one man team of jason coshell.  He spent most of the time in goal, so that made our defenseive job easy and we won something like 17-3.  Davis was amazing that game and had a total of i think 5 goals.  Colton played real well too, especially on defense.  I sucked all around in that game, but still managed to score 3 goals. Our second game was against O'conner, and we thought it was going to be easy but it sure wasnt.  There were some funny things happening in that game though.  In the 1st, i got ejected for supposedly going on the back of someone i wasnt even guarding.  Davis kept missing shots from hole to the right (i counted, it was like 6 in the 2nd alone.)  An o'conner player got rolled when he nailed tyler with an elbow and then cussed out the ref.  Brandon had the greatest play ever when he stole the ball from the goalie and drew a 4 meter.  Yeah, that was probably some of the hardest polo i have ever played, but i think i did alright.  I ended up scoring 5 goals, 4 for our team and 1 for theirs (i tried to save it, i really did!), had a few good passes, but also gave up some easy shots.  But the good thing is, we are really starting to come together as a team, cant wait till next game.

      "Hello, Cumnock-Francois residence, this is Benjamin" - I like how everyone seems to be at a loss for words every time i answer the phone.  Some people just sit in silence and wait for me to say something else, others start cracking up (cough stephanie), and others say something intellegent like "wow, thats quite a hello you've got there".  Hmm, im done with that subject, moving on...  I went out today with Brandon, Allie, and Stephanie and saw Shrek 2.  Haha, funny movie, the puss in boots is awesome. Good part is when he gets busted for having cat-nip, bu i wont say anymore so that way you have to go see it, yay!  Okay, random observation, for some reason i get excited whenever i see a silver honda, then dissapointed when its not who i think it is, i saw three on the way home today and dared to hope...oh well.  Enough writing for me, good night all you guys!

      Well, it seems i say this almost every time i write in here, but long time no post.  Finals suck as everyone already knows.  Shani and I went to B&N yesterday to study for the dreaded history test and we pretty much finished the review sheet.  So we made copies for each other and went home to study.  I studied, i promise i did, but it sucked just the same.  I knew some, but i didnt know more, so that will be one grade i dont anticipate seeing.  Saturday night i went to the prom with emily.  And even though i had to dress up in a tux, i still had a lot of fun.  We went to magic time machine first for dinner, a place i had never gone befoe.  It was real neat, with all the waiters and waitresses walking aroung in costumes and all of the boothes right out of fairy world, it was real cool.  Emily was funny because she wrapped herself up in napkins to protect herself from spilling food.  The prom itself was alright, it was nice seeing all of these people that i knew all dressed up, and i suppose it was fun dancing.  They didnt play a lot of real good music, but emily tried to teach me to dance and i did my best to learn, but i think i still have a ways to go.  Afterward we went bowling, and stephanie dang, who had never been before, beat us all with a 107, how crazy is that?  Later we went to emilys house and played scrabble and ate ice cream and just talked for a while, then i went home around 3:30.  So much more happened that night, but i cant write it all, so...the end.

      Yesterday I had to go to the orthodonest and get my mouth checked out.  Seems that i have to get braces and i have to get them soon, and ill have to wear them for at least a year.  Damn, i was hoping i could get away without them but i guess i knew in the back of my mind i would have to get them someday.  But why did it have to be this late?  Oh well, i guess there are worse things.  I also have this thing in the right side of my jaw where the disk that makes it go moves out of place and then my whole mouth goes pop.  It doesnt sound good and it definately doesnt feel good, but i have had it for as long as i can remember, so i guess i have gotten used to it.  This dr guy that looked in my mouth though says that hes not sure if they can fix it to perfection, but close ehough that i might be able to make it through life.  Dude, i have made it this far with my mouth the way it is, as far as im concerned, i dont need to make any changes anyways.  Ok, that was a lot more than i needed to write about that, sorry if you wasted your time reading it.  I made the rounds in the musical department this week, going to the orchestra, band, and chior concerts.  Yeah i went to all of them, and to be honest they were all really good.  The orchestra concert was the first one, and Stephanie, Emily, Lupe, and Michelle were all in (among other random people i know, but they arent really worth mentioning right now).  It was very well done, and they played a couple of songs i really liked, like "pirates of the carribean" and "devil went down to georgia".  Afterword the yantis family treated me to ice cream and i got to sit at a little kids tanle listening to steph and emily crack up about their daily lunch routine.  The band concert was pretty cool too.  The best part was the jazz band and their upbeat tunes, though i liked the john williams piece that A2 played, and the lord of the rings that A1 played.  Thursday was the chior concert, and i think they had the most interesting music.  Jazz chior was the coolest though, Allie, you did awesome!  Im going to bed, to dream.  Maybe about food and sports, and that other thing guys like, what was it again?  Ah yes, i remember...

      yay, only two days left in the week, one week of real school, and one week of exams until its all over.  Funny, it was my first year in a public high school, so i shouldnt be complaining as much as all the other people, but i am.  Funny how that works.  I took a stupid survey today about what to do with the rest of my life, but im not sure what it told me because it made the damn answer charts sooo complicated.  I dunno what it is, but a lot of people are either sick or prone to injuries.  Ive had off and on headaches all week from allergies, Carolyn lost her voice today from allergies, davis fell and hurt his wrist pretty bad, and allie had to miss school today because she had a migrain and she was throwing up.  But i think the worst is stephanie tripping and hurting her foot during soccer in the orchestra room, she had to leave during third and go and get xrays.  We're all cursed!  Basketball is fun and swimming sucks  Our pool is opening this weekend, which means that other peoples lives are entrusted into my hands.  Hmmmm....Muhahahahah!  You know you want to come swim

      Ok, so maybe im not necessarily against it.  But if you think things are better off the way they are, then ill see that they stay the same.  AP sucks Bio tests suck 3 hour pointless meetings with ed carroll suck Not being able to live up to expectations sucks Having the one person you have looked up to forever mad at you sucks Getting your eye gouged out by jeff miller sucks Knowing that something that you want is just out of your reach and you will never get it, yeah that sucks too  Okay yeah, crappy day (and the weekends not looking great either)  Good note though, me, emily, brandon, and stephanie are going tux shopping tomorrow.  But brandon already has one, so im the only one left who needs something to wear.

      3 weeks from tonight, im going to the prom with emily.  Tonight she called and asked me where I think we should go for dinner.  I said i dunno, but we eventually came up with La Fagada or Milanos, or something nice like that.  Then she asked another question, a bit more personal than the first.  Well, according to the dang it rule book (which i would like to see someday) i am required to answer, go figure.  Hah, but you dont get to know what i said.  By the way, stephanie, i know you are "for real" with what you said.  All i can say right now is, I'm Sorry.

      Okay, so its over now.  Im supposed to just let it be and let it go.  And i will, i will not bring it up anymore to anyone, its juat nice to know that the pool is safe once again.  I know it was supposed to be a game, and we (the lifguards) didnt do a very good job of playing along.  People started to think that we were really upset, but no one was really mad.  But i think you would be frustrated too if things started happening, things that were unexplainable.  Anyways, thanks for giving him back, our pool patrons can breathe a deep sigh of relief knowing that they can swim in safty once again.  I would also like to apoligize for any false accusations.  I know i made more than a few, and in one paticular case i blamed the same person many times.  But in something like this, everyones a suspect...  Enough said, it was a good game.  Props to you guys for playing it so well, the poems were worded well, and the drink was good.  I have only one question now, What the heck do i do with these ladies panties?!?!

It all depends on if you guys are going to mess up my house again, it was a pain in the butt to clean up.  Oh yeah, next time it happens i am calling you to come and clean it up, YEAH...I know who you are!  By the way, what the heck is "Bahahatiah" supposed to mean?!?!

      Another day, another missed practice for me.  Haha, whats new?  Today me, stephanie, emily, lauren, shannon, allie, michelle, and elizabeth went out to lunch today at chilis.  Ad'm was supposed to come but he is really sick so, he was in no shape to show up.  But it was cool, i was really full afterward, even though i ate a kids meal and even then i didnt eat all of it.  Hah, even stephanie ate more than me.  On our way out stephanie took a bunch of coasters, and all along kept denying that she was a bad person...oh well, i thought it was funny.  I worked today too.  Brandon and allie randomly showed up at the pool at 5, so i got in cause there was nobody else there.  We played keep away, and some weird skipping game (which i lost) then i had to actually do some work.  After work i got a myterious visit from "grr".  He/she/it left me some sonic and a note.  Thanks whoever it was!

      After the no swim meet, we went to allies and ate and watched a movie (which i was pretty engrossed in despite all of the fighting over seats and the throwing of the water bottles).  Then stephanie and allie took me and brandon upstairs for an....whoops im not allowed to say it.  In fact im not even allowed to talk about it because rule number one according to stephanie clearly states that im not allowed to talk about IT outside of IT. (see stephanie, i did listen!)  PS. Allie is a really good driver as long as you dont talk to her.  Oh yeah and take her out of a standard and put her in an automatic and watch her try to shift.  pretty funny, haha, im kidding allie, you're a better driver than me.  I mean come on, ive broken the law twice now!

      I will offically go down in history as the worst bowler ever.  Okay, the first game i did all right, i bowled a 93.  But unfortunately it wasnt good enough to beat michelle who had a miraculous comeback and bowled a 108 (which by the way is one more than stephanie bowled on her first time out on prom night).  Carolyn didnt do to well her first time out, but she did awesome and almost won the second time.  Watching her bowl was funny because she would just kinda drop the ball and then it would roll slowly down the lane and then tap the pins and they would fall.  But she wanted to beat michelle so badly the second game, she hired lauren to turn off michelles bumpers.  So michelle retaliated and turned off carolyns bumpers and that started a fight over the computer.  It was funny to watch.  Afterward michelle owned everyone at air hockey, including me ( but everyone knows that i would have beaten her had the stupid table counted all the goals i scored).  yeah, so that was my evening, it was fun.  I enjoyed getting my butt kicked at bowling and air hockey, and did i mention pizza?  Michelle ate a piece of pizza that was the size of...well it was big and she ate it in 3 bites!  you may doubt just reading this, but it was by far the greatest pizza eating feat i have ever seen.  Props michelle.  Yeah, i think i mentioned this before, but the SATs totally kicked my butt.  I mean the verbal, who has ever heard of these words before?!  and whos ever going to use them again?!  The math wasnt bad though, i just hope i didn better than my previous score cause if i didnt i just wasted a good three hours of my life.  Time that could have been better spent, much better spent...

      Im such a pool bum.  Yesterday i wasnt even working and i spent 5 hours down at the pool.  Not to mention what i spend at practice which adds at least 2 more hours.  And now today ill be there from 1030 till 12 and 430 till 8 and probably a lot between then too.  Good luck Sanchez, hahahaha!!!

      I went down to the Whispering Oaks pool after practice today and hung out for a while.  Me and Weid played this really stupid game for a while and then this one girl came over (and i still dont know what her name was) and i started talking to her.  She was cool to talk to but during adult swim, sanchez and mike came over to me and said, dude she wants your phone number.  And so they kept pressing me, Ben! give her your phone number!  Ben! ask her to a movie.  Ok, im sorry for being stupid, since thats what a couple people since have said, but i dunno, i just dont do that.  Im not the guy who goes out and "picks up chicks", i guess it just isnt me.  Yeah, i think of that to be something   not to take so lightly.  Maybe i am stupid, who knows..

      OH NO!!!  I have a missing person report to file!  We have looked everywhere and just can not seem to find Grr, the world is not safe!  We believe he has been kidnapped, so if you see him, kick the guys ass that took him and then return Grr to the Whispering Oaks pool so that patrons can can swim without fearing for their lives.  Thank you.

      Today ranks as one of those days where it feels like you're living in a dream.  I woke up this morning with the worst headache, but i wasnt going to let it bother me bacause it is summer, and im on my time now.  Well, i didnt let it bother me, but i spent most of the day feeling dizzy and light headed, and let me tell you, swimming didnt help.  I guess the only fun thing i did was go to shanis and swim, but that didnt last too long, (yeah, i hate wave, and i hate practice).  This is stupid.  I am constantly under the feeling that something, somewhere, is missing, and i dont know what it is.  I have just finished one of the greatest years of my life, and summer is here.  I now have polo camp to look forward to, and i am working, and i am just hanging out with friends, but still something is definately missing.

      Well, Im getting worse and worse at keeping up this posting thing, maybe I wasnt cut out for it.  A lot has been going on these past few days, too much to put into one post but I'll do my best.  Saturday we had the summer swim leauge championships, which we ended up winning by 52 points.  That may sound like a fairly wide margin, but considering we scored over 2000 points, its nothing.  Sunday was its usual boring self, but monday I went with the lifeguards and a few others to Schliterbahn.  It was quite a fun trip until Zach almost got us kicked out.  Long story, too long for this post, but fortunately in the end he ended up talking the security guard out of kicking us out of the park.  Tuesday I went back to normal routine and had to go to practice and work.  After work though I went down to Northside and played some polo, I sucked, but I still participated.  Then yesterday, it was just an ordinary day till I got invited to Emily's pool to hang out with Lauren, Allie, Emily, Shannon, and Stephanie.  It was pretty cool, we played keep away for a little while, then Stephanie and Emily decided to go on a covert mission, and I dont know what the heck they were doing.  Afterward Emily and Steph went to take a nap, and we played some more keep away, from which I still have scratches and and bruised jaw, but it was all in good fun.  It was about that time Stephanie decided to leave and not tell anyone, so that was kind of...disturbing i guess.  We went and visited her afterwards, and said goodbye, so i suppose that its all good.    Theres stuff I want to ask, and theres stuff i want to know.  To bad Im to much of a wimp to act on it...  Finally, a song that wasnt redone by the Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  There are places I remember All my life, though some have changed, Some forever, not for better, Some have gone and some remain. All these places had their moments, With lovers and friends I still can recall, Some are dead and some are living, In my life Ive loved them all. But of all these friends and lovers, There is no one compared with you, And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new. Though I know Ill never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know Ill often stop and think about them In my life I love you more. Though I know Ill never lose affection For people and things that went before, I know Ill often stop and think about them In my life I love you more. In my life I love you more.   - The Beatles

      Im so sad, my coach is retiring at the end of august after he told us that he would be with us through our senior year.  I know he has good reasons but i wish he would stay, i wouldnt swim for anyone else.  Hmmm, maybe i should put in my retirement from swimming too...  Speaking of swimming, Annie Chandler swam today, and even though she added two seconds, just making to the olympic trials is a major feat.  She is only 16, and she will definately get another shot.  Congratulations Annie!!!

       NAVY  Well, where do i start?  Last week Davis, Jeff, Brandon, and I went to a water Polo camp at the US Naval academy.  We spent Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday doing all sorts of drills to prepare us for the tournament that started on Wednesday.  I bacame part of team Zimbabwae, and we finished the tournament with the best record of 6-2.  Unfortuatley, our two losses came to a team who only had 2 wins the whole tournament, both were against us, they were team turkey.  So we ended up in the third plave game against venezuala and we raped them.  Team USA which had Matt and Jeff on it, lost to our team badly both times we played them, but played in the gold medal game against turkey and won by a point.  Jeff was awesome and he saved USAs ass so many times, and davis, well i knew that he was good, but he got a perfect evaluation from his coach, all threes.  Other things we did besides water polo:  we went into annapolis a few times and found the greatest place to buy malts, we played a lot of DE (aka scum, presidents and assholes), and we played a lot of Nintindo 64.  All in all it was a great week and a great experiance.
