      this looks interesting.  http://www.valuemd.com/viewtopic.php?t=20679&sid=ac2f3c641552caa64a4a140544498d1d  I think I posted about this earlier.  Fun times ahead!  ----- edit : adding more.  So my day wasn't as productive as I had hoped it would be.  Stayed up too late last night.  Phone call from my dad early this morning and someone actually trimming down the weeds (as tall as trees) outside pretty much kept me from sleeping late.  So after lunch, I pretty much went to sleep in classroom1.  Ive become more adept at sleeping in there.  Rest of the day I spent doing something.  I can't remember.  Oh I went to class....  Went over some viruses that cause gastroenteritis.  Not many.  And went over the Hepatitis viruses and a little over immunization.  Started going over some of the non-inflammatory diarrheas as well.  A lot there ....  took me awhile to go over it.  Not much exiciting happened today.  From SDN, someone thought that there may not be any openings in the 2007 class.  No decision was made by Tulane though.  They said they let 2 people into the 2006 class though.  Pretty much a non-eventful day really.

      I'll make some quick additions right now.  Need sleep basically.  Managed to wake up for my ICM lab this morning, but I was falling asleep while learning the breast and gyn exam!  I guess thats why I got picked on today to demonstrate it to the rest of the people in my lab.  Apparently my technique was good, but not the technique thats good for class :D  bought kiwi for $3 a fruit.  OUCH.

      So I had my 2nd assigned hospital day today.  For some reason I always think that the bus leaves at 8:30 am to leave for the hospital in the capital, abuot an hour's drive.  So anyways,  I barely made it again to the bus.  I got there just after 8.  I was assigned to ENT today, Ears, Nose and Throat, for those that don't know.  The doctor showed up about 90 mins late. We didn't waist that 90 mins.  Spent that time going over micro with the rest of the people in my group.   That 90 mins was taken away from our LUNCH time.  He's supposed to let us go between noon and 12:30.  So we can go fetch lunch, usually at the fort young hotel.  Which for this island, has some decent food.  But today he didn't let us out until 1:40 ish.  We are supposed to meet for our afternoon session at 1:45...  We were PISSED and starving.  So we were told to go to the hospital cafeteria, CANTEEN here.  They had nothing but crap.  So I got some fake cheetos and a coke.  Afternoon session wasn't too bad.  Had someone come in with a UMN lesion and spastic paresis, and 2 individuals with a ventricular septal defect.  One had a palpable thrill, and the other had a murmur.  Still can't tell the difference between systolic and diastolic murmurs.  Or crescendo/decrendo stuff.  I  know the PDA murmur though :D    Just glad I never have to go down to that hospital again!  I've got 2 weeks until the next exam.  Much work to be done, which I'll get around too in a bit once I shower and head over to school.  Needed to unwind a little from today.  Looks like my apartment is all squared away for miami.  Should have the application and fee in today.  On a side note, I was reminded that I should be hearing about Tulane soon.  Within a week or two.  They should hear about their grades soon and will know how many openings they will have for their 2007 class.  Not sure what else to add.  Anyways, time to hit that shower.

      Ok, not that I have some time to sit down, I think its time that I post something real. Got too caught up doing renal and GIT pathology yesterday to get on and post on here. Still really behind in pathology.  My full day of hospital rotation tommorow doesn't help matters either.  We've covered the Intestinal tract, liver+biliary, pancreas, male and female reproductive and are now starting renal.  I haven't even touched pancreas, male and female pathology yet.  And I still have to learn renal, breast and endocrine for this next test (in 2 weeks!).  :( We have yet to start pharmacology classes either for this next test.  Its a lot of endocrine associated drugs.  So I hope my physiology is up to par ... Almost done with microbiology.  Some repetition luckily though.  But still a lot of work. Im still lost in ICM (aka Physical Diagnosis).  Classes seem like a waist of time, but I can't find anything out there to read for the test.  The people who do well in this class are those who were ER techs, nurses, PAs, etc.  Its complete BS.  Ive finally found a place to live in miami.  Its called Ludlam Point,    It seems to be very close to some places I need to go to often.   Ive also been looking into review courses for the USMLE Step 1 exam.  Im almost certain I'll be signing up for this falcon review course located in Dallas, TX. Just seems it'll be easier for me to study while there.  Course info is located at http://www.falconreviews.com  Not much as happened here.  Drama in the bookstore.  Some pyscho woman, from my class, had a problem with the refund policy of the store.  Ordered a book expecting to get it in before the first test.  It came in after the test when she no longer wanted/needed it.  So she asked for her money back.  They said they couldn't.  She got in a fight.  She got banned from the bookstore.  Now she keeps going into the bookstore after the banning.  She grabs food/drinks and drops the money on the counter and leaves.  Finally, they had enough of it and tell her no more.  So she calls the owner of the place and bitches them out.   Next thing we know she goes into the bookstore throwing stuff around, and trying to steal stuff.  They call security to have her removed.  They close the bookstore all day until they can get some permenant security in place. So later that day she claims that the bookstore was racist and is causing problems.  So now it involves more than the bookstore and this individual.  The School is involved, all the way to the top. And to make matters even weirder.  If she ever steps inside the bookstore again, the school will expel her.  All of this over a $30 book.....  I guess thats it for now.

      Quick post.  Not much in the new.  ICM is killing me.  Took me way too long to write out my SOAP note. PLus all the other extra stuff I have to do for ICM this week.  Im just behind in path  finish liver, git and pancreas.  Need to focus on real.  Dunno how I'll get around to the male/female/breast  Micro - not sure where I stand on that.  Certain things I feel like I know ok, others not so ok.  Pharm - mostly physio drugs. Seems so small, yet deadly.  ICM - HAH!  Looking at pre-test but ...

      I figure this is probably the best place to say this for now.  Its pretty disturbing to think of how many people at this school rely on ritalin to study and get there grades. In a way I feel good about myself because I know that I've never touched that crap and my grades are about as good if not better than the rest of the people who used it to get where they are.  But we were listing off people who were at the "top" of the class and 1 by 1 we were listing off people who used it continual basis, sometimes more than they should per day. Pretty much feel like these people are cheating their way through med school.  Its like a copy of the exam before the test or using anabolic steroids for your body.  Its not you who is doing the work, its the drug.  Its not natural and somewhere down the line they'll probably pay the price for it.  But I guess Im thinking about it more because some of my better friends have decided to jump on the bandwagon.  I can understand one of them doing it as he might/could probably justify using it.  But the other one has no reason to do it.  She makes grades higher than the rest of the people using it and when she sits down, she sits down.  There is no reason for her to be using that shit. They know how I feel about it, so they tried hiding it from me.  But its easy to see them on it when they study.  Fixed on what they're doing so intently.  Chugging the water.  And what they're talking to someone else about it, they abruptly change the subject.    eh, I need to get some sleep.  got a pbl/respiratory session in a few hours.  bleh.

      For some reason it doesn't feel like the test is just around the corner.  I know I am not prepared.  I have this stupid pbl lab with this respiratory dummy(forgot what its realy name). Basically, it'll be taking a good deal of time from me this week.   Not much else to report really.   Its taken me 2 months, but Ive finally almost gotten the punisher.  Nothing new to report, as far as I can remember now.  Should get ready and head to school soon.

      I decided that instead of studying, Id watch Van helsing yesterday morning.  What a mistake that was!  Poor movie and it only waisted about a good 2-3 hours of study time.  I managed to get through 2 packets in pharm (still need to repeat them though).  But went through androgen drugs, and some pituitary drugs.  I need to go over diabetic, GIT and something else still.  I took all my notes on the GIT path.  Took me forever.  I started on the liver and pancreas last night.  Ive read the Liver from Robbins basic path (purple mama book).  It took me awhile and in retrospect, probably wasn't the most efficient use of my time.  Because I dont remember that much of what I read.  Other things accomplished yesterday...Did some micro.  Need to do a lot more.   A lot of organisms and note taking still yet to do.  Need to start compiling stuff for ICM as well.  Called Tulane on friday. No word yet on 2nd year transfers.  As for 3rd year transfers, they let in 2 people.  Wouldn't say from where though.  Looks like my apartment is all wrapped up, once we can get the deposit in.  Looking at selling my POS laptop to go back for an apple.  Just noticing a lot of issues in terms of support between my dell dj (which I love) and having it be supported on an apple system :|

      been a few days since my last update.  Not much new to report thats good anyways.  Final grades came out.  Did better than my previously posted grades (always a good thing).    Might have found buyers for my digital camcorder and laptop.   So Ive narrowed down my new computer to 3 possibilities. Apple 15" refurbished powerbook, Dell inspirion 8600 or a dell gateway (15.4" or a 17" model)  17" would't have the best all around stats, but would be very nice to have.  Lots of a screen space.  The other 2 are a bit more portable. Right now I think the dell is in the lead for price/options reasons.  But I really want the apple though.  Just my mp3 player wont work with it.  Big headache.  Ive sold a few books that I dont use.  Watched the chronicles of riddick and spiderman 2 last night (till about 4 am this morning).  Quality was actually pretty good on the movies though.  Bought a meat lasanga from this new canadian lady on the island.  DAMN GOOD.  Bad news: A cousin of mine with crohn's had another flare up.  So her doctors are thinking she needs surgery again ...

      Well its been a while since my last post.  Ive been real busy since my last post studying for my test yesterday.  Anyways,  from the grading I did on my own I ended up with a 84 in pathology, 82 in microbiology, 65 in pharmacology and 68 in ICM.  Im very happy with ICM since it was a big improvement.  Biggest disappointment was 65 in pharmacology.  The test was easy, but I was soo freaked out about path that I didn't put as much effort into pharm as I should have. I was so happy at first when I graded it because I had gotten a 91 in path, 85 in micro and a 71 in pharm.  But I missed grading a block of questions :(  4 wrong answers in here!  bleh  Need to wait and see what the curve is like now on friday.   Other significant things. 1) apartment is done in miami.  Deposit down and everything. 2) only 3.5 weeks of classes left in my 2nd year of medical school.  Assuming I go to them ... 3) Already looking for a cell phone plan, most likely cingular 4) I found chips and salsa on this island! 5) considering starting qbank/iv qbank now.  6 month option. 6) managed to get ahold of the 2001 kaplan lecture notes.  haven't found any eratta for them though 7) would love to get rid of my laptop, even though won't get much.   But my mp3 player won't work on an apple laptop ... 8) its been raining a lot here, so the water is brown again. 9) dunno what else.. dont know how I am going to get all my crap home.

      been awhile since my last post I see. &nbsp; Been waisting time trying to sell stuff.&nbsp; Namely my computer and camcorder.&nbsp; Have possible buyer on laptop, camcorder buyer backed out. Looking at purchasing a new computer.&nbsp; Waiting for a good deal to come out. Possibly the dell inspirion 8600 &nbsp; Been raining hard here today.&nbsp; Water is brown, power is out off campus (I think), and the A/C is off (got turned off when it switched to back up generator).&nbsp; But because of our great new dean. the security people are no longer allowed to touch the equipment (the people still on campus).&nbsp; The electricians have to do it (they stopped working about 5 hours ago, but physically left about an hour ago). &nbsp; Worst part of this day. is we finally speak to someone in the administration about what happens beyond this island.&nbsp; And our window for taking the step 1 exam is shortened.&nbsp; I have till Feb 13th to take the exam.&nbsp;  I was told till Feb 28th and had planned everything, everything on that date.&nbsp; So now I can't take falcon reviews (almost signed up for it earlier this summer - no refunds : ) So now I need to figure out what I'll be doing.&nbsp; Kaplan in miami runs from Nov 12 to Jan 16.&nbsp; With holidays in there (10 for xmas and new years eve). Wonder how much time and which center its being offered in.&nbsp; My world turned upside down.  So I need to figure out how I'll be studying for step 1 now .... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Luckily my place has a backup power generator.  So 2 friends came over and we watched "The girl next door".  Not a bad movie, nothing great though.  Not much else to write.

I just found out that I need to do know how to use the opthalmascope and otoscope.&nbsp; I need to go find mine.&nbsp;   Side note: Got this joke in an email today.&nbsp; Pretty funny.  Subject: The Republican Party  The Republican National Committee announced today that the Republican Party is changing its emblem from an elephant to a condom.  The committee chairman explained that the condom more clearly reflects the party's stance today, because a condom accepts inflation, halts production, destroys the next generation, protects a bunch of pricks, and gives you a sense of security while you're actually getting screwed.

      Looks like we might have a tropical depression/storm hit us.  Its about 500 miles to the south-south east of us and moving towards the north- northwest at 23 mph.  So right on time for the tests on wednesday and thursday.  looks like my link above really screwed up the formating on this page.  Oh well.  We have a theory going on about what shelf exam everyone is taking based on which classroom we are in and which 4th semesters are taking there exam in.   It goes like this. Classroom 4 is Pharm and Path Classroom 1 is ICM and Micro Couple that with our survey requests,  those with Pharm and Path survey requests are in classroom 4 as well.  Same holds true for Micro and classroom 1.  I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked to take the ICM survey though.  I was asked to fill out the Path Survey.  So I think I'll study for that some.  Basically go over RBC/WBC and InfectiousDisease/Immunity.  Not much else to report new right now. Feeling slightly unmotivated at the moment.

      its been a loooooooooong time since my last post.  I had personal issues, problems with getting this blogger to work on the new website, and finally finals.  I've also had to find a new place to live in Miami.  Here it is.   urlLink http://apartmentguide.com/Property/property.asp?wsv_psPropertyID=15595&wsv_qsSessionID=241722109&amp;wsv_qsListType=1&wsv_qsPartner=-1&amp;wsv_qsGeoKey=1,10,101&wsv_qsKeyword=bay%20parc%20plaza&amp;wsv_qsRegisteredFlag=0&wsv_qsBrowseStatus=0&amp;wsv_qsSearchStatus=1&wsv_qsReferringURL=&amp;wsv_qsSCartStatus=0&wsv_qsLowPrice=&amp;wsv_qsHighPrice=&wsv_qsBR=0,1,2,3,4&amp;wsv_qsTerm=3&wsv_qsAdvancedSearch=&amp;wsv_qsNoAreas=&wsv_qsSFlg=&amp;wsv_PropertyNameSearch=1    I'm getting the small 440 sq ft studio!  ugggg.  But the location is the important thing. Its 11 miles straight down the highway to the main Ross campus in Miami.  like 2 miles to our big classroom in miami and .32 miles from where I'll be taking my Kaplan review course from Nov to Jan. I just need to search for the closest prometric testing center in miami now.  I think my Qreview (qbank + IV qbank ) subscription starts tommorow.  Lasts for 6 months.  I've had 2 of 4 finals thus far. Path lab final = 83.33 (mps = 56.67; curved = 96.66) = 20% of grade ICM practical exam = ? (comes out monday I think) = 30% of grade Mystery meat shelf on wednesday = ? 15% in whatever class I take it in. Final thursday, the 19th. 45% in path (30 if I take path shelf) 50% in pharm (35 if I take pharm shelf) 34% in micro? (16? if I take micro shelf) no idea in ICM prob 30/15 if taking shelf.  So hard to study now since I'm so ready to leave.  till next post.

      this place is an asylum for nutjobs it seems.  a house built of lies and decit. I can't wait to leave here.  I take a Pharm or MIcro shelf tommorow.  I dont feel too prepared for either exam, but I kinda hope to take the pharm exam so my final is only 35% of my grade. Feels like I'm trying to do too much right now. I can't cover everything.  I need to pick out my weaker points and concentrate on that.  Which for path (final is 45%) is GIT, Liver, Skin, ummm everything?  Pharm Drugs of Abuse Anti-Arrythmics learning the name of the drug names everything  I need to put a little more effort into micro too though.  Its about 37% of my grade.  Same in ICM.  Not enough time, never enough time.

      Its monday morning now (nearly 1 am) just finished going some micro with a friend.  Looks like that 1 tropical storm went under us again...We got some intermitent heavy rain for awhile, but nothing bad at all.  Worst is just the brown water again. Seems like the scarry situation is going NW and then will be moving to the north!  Its like 800 miles from us, but is already a grade II? hurricane.... OUCH  Debating if I should put some time in for a possible pharm or micro shelf on wednesday.  I can bomb the micro shelf and still come out with an A in the course easily.  I'm pretty much locked into passing the course.  I hope I get the pharm shelf,  it'll make the final only 35%.  I don't remember very much about my antimicrobials though.  Some, but not as much, about the cholinergics and adrenergics (but thats more physio than anything).   Just remembering the drugs names n such again with which receptors they act upon.  Rest of the pharm I'm reviewing in some fashion or form for my local final anyways (cept the antimalignants which I'm only doing part of).  Looks like I am now living at the airport villas,  urlLink http://www.airportvillas.com  not as nice as the other place, but it will work out better for my semester there.  Since I have to buddy with a clinical rotation partner and have a physical exam partner.  So we'll both live there together.  then when he leaves in mid november, I'll just take over the place and stay there through Jan or a bit longer I think.   Not sure what else is new.  Still waiting for my ICM practical exam grades (tommorow!)  can't wait to get home at this point.  Feeling a bit home sick, just tired of the bullshit associated with this school.  Need time away from everything, the people, the rumors, the food, the life, etc.  On a sadder note,  a guy i knew from SA (friendly with him, but not neccessarily a friend per se), was killed saturday morning by some driver.  I think he was 22 or 23.  Just makes you think about shit.  Thats it for now.
