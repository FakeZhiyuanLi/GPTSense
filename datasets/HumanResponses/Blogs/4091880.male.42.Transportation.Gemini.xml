						   What is a Libertarian?? By now you've probably heard at least a little something about the Libertarian party. Libertarians have had a Presidential candidate on the ballot in all fifty states for the past three election cycles, and the Badnarik campaign is well on its way to making this year's election number four. We have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country, and currently boast over 600 Libertarians in public office. Many people are even aware that the Libertarian party is the third-largest political party in American politics.   In spite of all this familiarity, the one question that many people still seem to have is, ``What exactly is a Libertarian??`` People with conservative beliefs often see us as ``liberal`` because of our outspoken defense of personal freedoms -- like the freedom of expression, or the freedom for peaceful adults to decide what to eat and drink, and how to raise their children. On the other hand, people with liberal beliefs tend to see us as ``conservative`` because of our staunch defense of economic freedoms, including the freedom for people to trade with one another in a way that they decide is in their own best interest. These misconceptions say more about the prejudices of the people who hold them, than they do about the Libertarian perspective.  Despite all the confusion, the Libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand. Libertarians are, quite simply, people who believe in ``Self-Ownership``: I own myself, and nobody else on Earth has a higher claim to my body or my labor than I do. Likewise, we have a deep respect for other peoples` self-ownership: You own your body, and so long as you're acting in a way that doesn't interfere with anyone else's freedom, you should be free to do what you please.   The idea of ``Self-Ownership`` is what is what distinguishes us from both liberals and conservatives. Every political position that Libertarians take can be traced back to this simple idea. For example, Libertarians are opposed to ``liberal`` attempts to use the government to regulate people`s buying practices by imposing tariffs on certain goods and industries. We oppose this kind of regulation not because we think that all goods and industries are equally wonderful, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide what to buy based on their own beliefs and values. If for some people that means buying fair-trade coffee at the local co-op grocery store, then that's great -- just as long as they don`t use the government`s power to force other people to do the same.   Likewise, Libertarians are opposed to ``conservative``attempts to use the government to regulate people's morality, by imposing laws that restrict their behavior on the Sabbath, or at the pharmacy, or in the bedroom. We're opposed to these kinds of legal restrictions not because we think that all lifestyle choices are equally worth pursuing, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide how to live their lives as they see fit.  If you're not conservative and you are not liberal, where do you fit on the political spectrum?   The traditional left-right spectrum is one that political scholars have recognized as incomplete for some time. In fact, it is really only useful for tracking the answer to one question: ``What part of your life do you think government should control?`` On the left-hand side of the spectrum we find people who believe that it is the government's job to regulate our economic lives ; that is, our interactions with one another that involve exchange. Democrats and Green party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. On the right-hand side, we find people who believe that it's the government's job to regulate our social lives. Republicans and Constitution party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. This one-dimensional view of politics as something for controlling one area of life or another, explains why many libertarians cringe when we hear congress talk about passing ``bipartisan legislation''  The closest you can come to charting Libertarians on a one-dimensional left/right spectrum is to plot us directly in the middle of the two extremes. This is the only place on the line where you could put people who don`t believe in controlling each others lives either in an economic or a social sense. However, this fails to take into account that, like all other political groups, Libertarians come in varying degrees. It also makes it difficult to find a place to put people who believe that government should control both economic and social decisions.  It seems clear that the simple left/right political spectrum falls short of accurately describing the various mix of political opinions. There have been several ideas about how to address this problem, the most prominent resulting in the ``Nolan Chart``, which tracks personal and economic freedom along two separate axes. Libertarians often use a short quiz in order to show people where they might fit within this more accurate type of political spectrum. If you have not already done so, click here link to http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html and take the quiz for yourself. You may be surprised to see where you fit!   For those of you who score in the Libertarian range, you will find that you're in good company: From television celebrities Drew Carey and Bill Maher, to philosophers Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick, to U.S. Congressman Ron Paul ; people from all walks of life are proud to call themselves libertarians.  Of course, ours is not the first generation to hold these ideas. The Declaration of Independence, presents what is perhaps the perfect example of the Libertarianism in this country`s history. The Libertarian concepts of self-ownership and mutual respect for each others rights were the ideas that sparked the abolition of slavery, and resonated clearly throughout the civil rights movement.   These are ideas that are just as relevant today as they were then. There are ideas that people still agree with in great numbers. However, too often people are lead to believe that they do not have a choice ; that they must give something up in an attempt to elect ``the lesser of two evils'' but how can being compelled to choose between your ``social`` freedoms and your ``economic`` freedoms be anything but evil?  There is another choice: If you think as we do, and if you want to send a clear message to Washington this November ; a message that will force politicians in both major parties to think twice about passing laws that restrict your self-ownership, then vote for the candidate that you agree with most, instead of the candidate that you fear the least. Vote Libertarian!

						   I am a legally ordained Toaist minister in the Universal Life Church so theoretically I have a congregation, and they (or me as it were) deserve a media member who represents their point of view. So with this in mind I thought I would apply for press credentials for the debates. Not so fast buddy, the CPD has covered this angle too. On their Media Accreditation page is the following restriction.....   "Only full-time employees of news organizations are eligible, no stringers, freelancers, interns, students or family members will be credentialed."   Only media members already bought and paid for need apply.

						   Houman Shadab posted an excellent idea for a "Virtual Debate" in the (likely) event that we can't get Mr. Badnarik into the debates.....   Comment from: Houman Shadab      My idea: have Badnarik "debate" the other two by some type of live simulcast, where he can respond to the questions being asked and also respond to Bush's and Kerry's comments.   This way, a press release could be issued, or (even better) an article written stating: "LP Candidate to Debate Bush and Kerry. Even though LP Presidential Candidate Badnarik is not allowed in the debates, that isn't stopping him from participating. Etc. etc."  For example, Badnarik could set up a small stage with a podium outside of the main debate location. Two TVs (on stands) show the debate. Three podiums, one in front of each TV (representing Bush and Kerry) and one for Badnarik. Whatever else is on the real stage should be mimicked on the smaller stage outside. Then, after the question is asked, Badnarik can respond along with the candidates. Of course, the one logistical problem is not being alloted time to respond, so maybe a TIVO is probably in order. Of course, having supporters there would be great too.  If done in a professional and serious manner, without a hint of anger or sarcasm, it could have a great effect. This could create a real David and Goliath situation, earn Badnarik great sympathy and respect and show that he is qualified and deserves to debate the other two.  The three podiums, two TVs and Badnarik set up could make for a great visual showing how Badnarik is being "locked-out" and must resort to debating a TV. Just imagine a picture of it with an accompanying story, e.g. "Is This Democracy?"  Of course, the live stage is just an idea an may end up looking silly in execution. But I think some type of public real-time, debate-format-like response could be really effective and garner attention.   As I re-read this and post it to my own blog it occurs to me, why wait for the debates at all? It is a well known fact at this point that these are not debates in any sense of the word. They are negotiated and scripted bipartisan photo-ops. Knowing this, and knowing the platforms of both Bush and Kerry, why not take clips from their campaign speeches and edit them into "debates" we could stage? We could select a "moderator" to ask questions pertaining to major issues. Then cut to clips of Kerry and Bush giving their typical non-answers in speeches, followed by Mr. Badnarik responding with his solutions. This may force Bush &amp; Kerry into a corner where they have to actually debate Mr. Badnarik or at least expose their real positions.

						   John is Personal Asst. to Mr. Badnarik. On 6/12/04 he posted a letter slamming the CPD and asking activists to assist Open Debates..........  Just a note on the issue of getting Mr. Badnarik into the debates -- As great as audioblogging may be for the campaign, it's not a silver bullet to get our candidate into the debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) was formed by R's and D's in 1993 for the primary purpose of keeping independent and 3rd party candidates out of the debates. As long as the media accepts the CPD as legitimate, there will only be Bush-Kerry on the stage. The hope we can have is that the Citizens' Debate Commission  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org  is seen as THE LEGITIMATE debate commission by the American people and the media. It'll take the media realizing that the CPD debates are a sham that the American people don't want to accept in order to shame/force Bush and Kerry into legitimate debates where Mr. Badnarik would participate. But the media likes a two-way horse race, and the media and American people accept the CPD as legitimate. The CPD debates are so boring and worthless that Americans are tuning them out more and more, so this gives some hope that the debates process can be reformed by the Citizens' Debate Commission. These are the planned sites/dates by the Citizens' Debate Commission debates:  Capital University (Columbus, OH) Sept. 22 Swathmore College (Swathmore, PA) Sept. 28 Canisius College (Buffalo, NY) Oct. 3 Willamette University (Salem, OR) V-Prez Oct. 7 Carleton College (Northfield, MN) Oct. 11 Nova Southeastern (Fort Lauderdale, FL)Oct. 15   We need to understand that our goal should be to force Bush and Kerry to participate in these debates!  (emphasis added) The only way that'll happen is if the media becomes convinced these are the legitimate debates and the CPD is not. Tough task, but we need to understand the nature of the challenge in order to approach the goal most effectively.

						   On 6/25/04 George Farah wrote a letter to the Badnarik Blog asking for us to combine our efforts.........   Letter from George Farah of Open Debates     Dear Mr. Gordon:  We think that our work to reform the presidential debates would be of particular interest to you and other member of the Libertarian Party. We hope you can send the following brief description of our campaign (or some form of it) to your members. Our grassroots campaign to reform the presidential debates will only succeed if we mobilize enough voters to demand real and inclusive presidential debates from the major party candidates. The message we hope you will spread to your members is as follows:  For the last sixteen years, the general election presidential debates have been controlled by a private corporation – the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) – that has deceptively served the interests of the Republican and Democratic parties at the expense of the American people. And for the first time in sixteen years, an organized effort to return control of the presidential debates to a genuinely nonpartisan champion of voter education has been vigorously launched. Presidential debates were run by the League of Women Voters until 1988, when the national Republican and Democratic parties seized control of the debates by establishing the CPD. Co-chaired by the former heads of the Republican and Democratic parties, the CPD secretly submits to the demands of the Republican and Democratic candidates. Negotiators for the major party nominees draft secret debate contracts called Memoranda of Understanding that dictate precisely how the debates will be run – from who gets to participate, to who will ask the questions, to the heights of the podiums. The CPD merely implements the directives of the contracts, shielding the major party candidates from public criticism. Walter Cronkite called the presidential debates an “unconscionable fraud” and accused the major party candidates of “sabotaging the electoral process.”Open Debates (www.OpenDebates.org), a ten-month old nonprofit organization, is engaged in a multifaceted, national campaign to reform the presidential debate process. In addition to aggressively exposing the antidemocratic practices of the CPD, Open Debates has formed a genuinely nonpartisan Citizens' Debate Commission to sponsor future presidential debates that address pressing national issues, feature innovative formats, and include the candidates that the American people want to see. Seventeen national civic leaders from the left, center and right of the political spectrum serve on the Citizens Debate Commission (www.CitizensDebate.org), and over sixty diverse civic organizations serve on the advisory board of the Citizens’ Debate Commission  Our campaign to reform the presidential debates is picking up steam:  On May 24, the Citizens Debate Commission announced sites and dates for five presidential and one vice-presidential debate to be held in colleges and universities around the country.  View the press release:  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org/news/pressreleases/05242004.html  Major newspapers have editorialized in support of the Citizens’ Debate Commission, including the Los Angeles Times. Read the Times editorial:  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org/news/relatedarticles/gloves.html  A new book exposing the corrupt presidential debate process has been released, “No Debate: How the Republican and Democratic Parties Secretly Control the Presidential Debates.” More info about the book is available at:  urlLink http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100234970  Open Debates filed legal complaints with the IRS and FEC against the CPD, relying on secret copies of the 1992 and 1996 Memoranda of Understanding obtained from a whistleblower. View the secret 1996 Memorandum of Understanding:  urlLink http://www.opendebates.org/documents/1996MemorandaOfUnderstanding.pdf     Now, President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry must decide whether to participate in real and transparent presidential debates that maximize voter education, or stilted and deceptive bipartisan news conferences that maximize major party control. The Republican and Democratic nominees will only participate in debates proposed by the Citizens’ Debate Commission if the political benefit outweighs the political cost, and that calculus will only be achieved if sufficient voters demand democratic debates from them. Please help us exert that pressure; visit our website –  urlLink www.OpenDebates.org  – sign up for our infrequent Action Alerts, sign our petition, and make a financial contribution. With your help, we can restore voter education and transparency to the presidential debates.  Sincerely,George Farah Executive DirectorOpen Debates  urlLink www.OpenDebates.org  p: 202-628-9195f: 202-628-9196

						   First posting ever to this blog.......We must open all political debates, particularly those for president, so I've begun this blog as place to post pertinent addresses to be used in e-mail campaigns.  Later this blog will be used for me to vent and rant.
