      So i definitely don't want to leave. the weather is amazing but cannot even match the amazing landscape of mountain, volcano, beach, and caldera (think steep cliff). the architecture is amazing here as is the culture. our work is fairly satisfying and i really just enjoy the entire place and the atmosphere. tourist season hasn't hit yet, so the places are moderately empty. we will see the volcano this weekend on a cruise, would love to snorkel and the cliffs of the mountain and caldera would be awesome to repel down - a great proposal for alternative tourism. i can't imagine living my life without seeing such an awesome place. i will upload some pictures later on this week. so difficult to get to the internet - time, money, and motivation.  ~nicole

      In Athens, we visited the market which was mostly a meat market and the smell was absolutely appalling. A butcher pulled me aside so we could have a picture together with his pig. We had lunch in a small place within the market where the smell continued to waft in and I had no appetite from all the sites and sounds. Before I knew it, a 40-something man there was asking Dr. Romanos permission to ‘caress’ me so he bought us all wine and chicken and when we were leaving he handed me a dead fish, fully intact. I did not know what to do with it. His counterpart, who took our picture with his photo phone, had a toupee that was so warn it actually had a significant bald spot. We wanted to visit the archaeological sites on Sunday, but it was voting day and everything was closed but the huge flea market which was neat. Monday we visited the Acropolis and the Agora AND managed to go shopping – much better than Ohio shopping.

      Santorini is breathtaking. I had never imagined such a vast beauty of a place could be contained in such a small area. Not that the island is small. From our room, Hayfaa and I have a view of the mountain, if we venture to the roof, the ocean is on the other side. We are not living near the caldera, but we will spend so many days there that it is not to be missed. We have only had good luck (except I got into trouble already with some wild dogs). On the boat ride, a miscommunication between our travel agent, Santorini, and the boat people ended in cabins and dinner with the captain – a 4 course meal. When we arrived to Santorini, we were treated to breakfast at a café and driven to our absolutely enormous house. Two persons per room, each with its own bathroom and veranda. A new refrigerator, stove, clothes washer, and then yesterday, we came home to find our refrigerator completely packed, along with the cupboards, and the storage area. Our dining room was full of every item you would need to entertain a party of twenty. And to add to all of this, we got Susana, our cook and maid. We will be given the opportunity to spend each Saturday on a different island in the cyclades as guests of an official we’re working with. The beach is a 10 minute walk, we’re on the side with black sand but we haven’t had time to go yet. Yesterday we had a tour bus take us to the different settlements and environments found on the island. Please take a look at the pictures – I’ve uploaded a few.

      We made it. After what seemed like forever flying and waiting, we arrived in Athens around 6:30pm yesterday. It is so amazing how I felt like I was in America as we drove into the city - same highways, billboards, big box stores, American music on the radio. But when we got into the city, it was so different. Everything is under construction for the olympics. Working on sidewalks, roads, and building fronts everywhere. And there are guards with rifles patrolling the large buildings (I think this is normal). We went to a taverna last night and had great food with wonderful wine, I think we were the only foreigners there. Today will be spent wandering around Plaka, seeing the sites, and learning this part of the city. I will upload the photos next time I get to an internet cafe.  One more thing, the weather is the most perfect - so cool and warm at the same time. I am so excited to walk around and take it all in.  ~Nicole
