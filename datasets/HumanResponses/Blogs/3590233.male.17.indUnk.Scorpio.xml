       Cycling for Hope â€“ Day 1   Today our Journey Began, in the early morning. We began at the west end of Vancouver, in Stanly Park. Where we met with several politicians and a photographer from the Glob&Mail..  After the send off, there was about 60 kilometers of ridding before we could get out of the downtown area. So we just had to take it slow, and avoid, the Taxis and Bums.  Once outside of town we had the best ridding we could have asked for. Amazing weather and scenery. After 168 k, and a Little over 6 hours we Made it To Hope BC,  a small town in the foot hills of the Rockies. Out our window of the hotel we have a view of what we have to coming in the next couple of days.  So Far all emotions are positive and the outlook on the remainder of the trip is optimistic.  Thanks and we will be in touch  Story and Pictures By: Ryan May

       This is Jordan here..! We made it into BC after three days of driving, $500 in gas, no speeding tickets and many pizza submarines. We are chilling in Vancouver right now at a friend of my dad's place, it is pretty sweet. Vancouver is a really clean version of Toronto, its hot too.   Anyway, Codey will tell the what the highlights from the trip include thus far...   Day 1 started at roughly 10am on Monday morning, as we pulled out of the driveway with high hopes, and lots of energy. About 12-14hrs later, I was driving we were past Sault Ste. Marie, on our way to Thunder Bay. I saw a large moose at the side of the road, and as it was an unususal site to us, i acclaimed something like, " WHOAH THERE'S A HUGE MOOSE LOOK A MOOSE!!" Everyone but me was sleeping, but Jordan I guess was half a sleep, and he said, " What, we hit Stephen Lewis?" I am guessing Jordan interpreted moose as Lewis. I don't know, lack of sleep probably the cause, but it was a good laugh for me at 3am.  You know on the set of the teletubbies, where there is those crazy green hills, we found where they exist! In western saskatchewan! We intend to recreate our own episode of the teletubbies on the way back.  ----------------- Ryan's Learned Emotions:  -3 Guys driving for 3 days straight will begin to smell not so good.  -PreMade Pizza subs from Shell Gas Station are not as bad as one may imagaine.  -You can get away with anyhting if you have siren on your car.  -A speed limit of 110 trhough the praries is not enough.  -Cd's that cost $1, are better than Jordans  -The country is Large and so is the task we have ahead of us.  By: Ryan May -------------------- So that is some of our insight thus far into our trip. We will keep updating soon. Also, there will be a big update on the cyclingforhope.ca site once the ride begins as we are having computer problems.   By the way, at the beginning in Stanely part on 10am on saturday, media will be there as well as some of the MP candidates from that riding, including the current mp Hedy Fry, who has been very supportive. We are not sure how much media attention it will get because the elections and all, but we are hopeful!   We will post again soon,   thanks for reading  ryan, codey and jordan

       Hi Everyone,   Welcome to the blogger that we will be using to feed all of you with our stories and whatnot from our journey this summer! We will try to update it whenever we have internet access, which will be almost daily.   Anyway, heres some dirt that's going down!   Me, Codey and Ryan are kinda almost sorta ready to hit the road Monday morning. My mother has been getting my clothes ready and such for the past couple days. We have also just started to get some stuff from our major sponsors: Kamikaze Bikes (www.kamikazebikes.com), Ryders Eyewear (www.ryderseyewear) and Eload (www.eload.net) -- so that is nice. Me and Ryan are putting the car graphics on our car tonight and tomorrow, so that will be very beautiful.   Codey is racing this weekend at the Albion Hills/Chico Racing 24hour race, so I hope he is doing well. I am going over to see him and the rest of his team soon and to try and score sweet massages from Codeys trainer! Needless to say, he will be pretty tired for the next couple days and will be a basketcase on monday morning when we leave bring and early.   Ryan is on his way from his home in Ottawa right now back to home, where he will get his stuff together. I have been putting off putting all the logos and such on our car because he claims he loves it more than life himself. So i will give him the pleasure of doing it.   Alot of people have been asking us how this drive and such all working... well here we go.   -We are leaving ontario monday morning to drive to sudbury, sault sainte marie, thunderbay, winnipeg and all that jazz... right through to Vancouver, without even stopping for gas or a washroom break, which is an enourmous feat for a four cylinder sporty car and ryans bladder.  -We should arrive thursday morning in Vancouver, where we are staying with a friend for two days to get prepared.  -On Saturday the 26th, we are leaving from STANELY PARK, which is in a beautiful area of Vancouver. We are trying to get media there, but because of the federal election it is very complicated.  -Then, I will ride everyday, and codey and ryan will alternate between riding and driving.   One more thing, we will love to hear from you! Please email us (see the cycling for hope site), or call us or post a comment here or something!   If you want to help us in anyway, drop us a line at general@cyclingforhope.ca and we will work something out. there is more work that needs to be done than anyone can imagine!   I would also like to thank everyone that is helping from home and surrounding areas with getting us accomodations and contacting media as we work our way through Canada! Especially, I would like to thank my parents for supporting me, no matter how rediculous my dreams are!   So this is it, here we go! This is cyclingforhope 2004!   Thanks For Reading - please post your comments, you dont have to register or anything!   Jordan.   www.cyclingforhope.ca jordan@cyclingforhope.ca

       Well we are in the Terrace Bay public library killing some time - waiting for the crazy foggy weather outside to pass. It is like a blizzard outside, minus the snow - but it is crazy hard to see, just like a blizzard. Anyway, so if it doesn't clear up  in the next couple hours or so, we have decided that we will drive to Marathon, where we were supposed to ride to and keep up with our schedule. We will then make up the 78km that we did not ride today when we are taking our 4 day break at home in Mansfield, Ontario. Since we are 3 days ahead of schedule that way - we have decided to extend our one day rest day at home to 4 days so that we will go back to the normal schedule. This means that from August 15 - 29 we will ride from Mansfield to PEI. In our 4 day break, we will all be using that time to get ready for university, do laundry etc. Speaking of which, it just occured to me and codey this morning that we have not done laundry since early july - almost a month ago. And, the best part of it all is that we dont even smell! So yes, the four day break will be nice for us.   We left thunder bay a couple days ago. We all loved the city and hope to go back someday. Anyone in thunder bay area - we made the front cover of the big northern ontario news paper - the chronicle journal - so check that out if you want. We also got a chance to check out the terry fox momument. I drove there our first night there to see it and embrace its significance into what we are doing. Me and codey then rode their on our rest day. Then, as we left the city the next day we went and saw it again. I will write more about the monument in time, it really hit home for me.   In the mean time, I must go and figure out what we are going to go today!  Thanks for reading.   Jordan

       Hello All,   We are all happy to say that we have made it back to our native soil of Ontario - very very Northwestern Ontario, but Ontario nonetheless. I write to you from Kenora Ontario this evening, we crossed the boarder this afternoon. We managed to make it across Manitioba in 3.5 riding days, a pretty impressive feat. We decided to take a kinda rest day in Winnipeg yesterday, even though I still rode 70k so that our 224km trek to Kenora would not be so bitter. Tomorrow we are off to Dinorwic, where we will be engulfed into Ontario wilderness at its finest.   So a couple things that I shall update you on,   I mentioned in my last update (while we were in saskatoon), that I was injured. I had really strained my left knee from being riding between 5 and 7 hours for many consectutive (sp?) days. I went to emerg in Lacombe, Alb. to have it checked out and whatnot, and I just had to take it easy for about four days, meaning not riding off the saddle, and favoring my right leg, alot. So if in the pictures I look as though I am in agony, you know why.   Also, the other day, me and codey encountered another close, disasterous call. The first close situation was in BC during our first week of the ride when me and him got tangled up in a tunnel on a small sidewalk. I was railing (going extremely fast) up behind him and had to bail into a solid concrete wall, almost pushing him into a sign. Fortunately there was no traffic near by or anything, even if there was, we would have been fine. However, when me and codey were riding into Neepawa, Man., a car pulled out right infront of us, crossing the road when we were only metres away from the intersection. We thought the driver saw us, so we maintained our speed coming into the intersection, which was about 45kmph because of a mad tail wind. However, the car entered the intersection - quickely, and we almost struck the side of it. Fortunately there was no traffic to the side of us, so we were able to pull out and avoid a collision. But it was a close call, nonetheless. Moral of the story: if you see us or any cyclists on the road, slow down, give space and pay attention please!   We are also a day ahead the original schedule right now too! By the time we get into Central/Southern Ontario we will be three days ahead! It is a great feeling to know that we are actually riding well enough to be able to tackle more milage in a day.   I would once again like to thank everyone for their ongoing support. From our familes, friends, to donors and well wishers - your support means the world to us. We have met some incredible people out here, and had many amazing experiences. I have said it once and I will say it again, we are having the time of our lives!   Thanks for reading, we will update when we have internet access again!   Jordan.   ps. sorry about the nasty spelling!

       Good Evening,   I write this from Golden, BC - our last stop in BC for the summer. Tomorrow we have the hardest day of riding (or so we have heard) during this whole ride. Internet acess has been crazy scarce, so I am going to update you guys on all of our rediculous endevors in the past week. For some reason right now me and codey are on computers right beside eachother now, and he is asking me for the car keys over msn... but i dont have the car keys.... meh, he'll find them.    Firstly, if you want to read a depressing article go get saturdays globe and mail -- we are in it --- right next to terry fox i might add. After reading it we all kinda got discouraged in a way, it was just like saying dont do cross Canada ventures - you will regret it, because no one can recreate what people like what terry fox have done. As I say in the article "What we are doing does not hold a flame to Terry Fox". But we wont regret this endevor cause we are young, sexy, having the time of our life and gots too much booty in the pants! (ryans addition)   If you want an uplifiting article to read about us (and see a rediculous picture of Codey and myself), go look at the Kamloops Daily News website! We have been doing a fair amount of media in the past week. I did a live interview on a radio station out of Calgary over the phone at 7am this morning. Then when we got into Golden, BC, this afternoon we did an interview with the local paper and such. The word is getting out, and we couldn't be happier with the response. People are being crazy nice to us, which is really comforting to know that people that dont even know us still believe in us.   Ryan has composed a photo journal that we will update frequently -- www.mayracing.ca/hope/hope --- it is updated very frequently -- so if you want to see how long our hair is, or how beautiful the scenery is check it out!   We have been living the high life - as many many hotels and motels have been kind enough to donate acccomodations to us. There will be a section for all of our sponsors on the website shortely - please check it out and give our gracious sponsors some love, they deserve it.   I would like to express my thanks to my family and friends who have been supporting us in so many ways from home. They figure out where we are staying at night, contact media, wire us money, and provide a never ending amount of support. Thank You - from the bottom of our hearts. You all know who you are!   Another important note, any teenager looking for a good laugh, watch the film Eurotrip. This movie has saved us on many boring evenings -- watch it! It is rated R with good reason.   So we are in Golden tonight. It is a nice little mountain town near the BC/Alberta border. Last night we were in Rogers Pass which is 1330 metres above sea level - meaning oxygen is scarce and there is plenty of snow around still. We had a ball there -- it isn't even a town either! It is a Best Western and a truck stop - that is the town. But it is amazing! The scenery immediately puts you in awe. If anyone ever goes through there stop for a couple hours and climb a mountain or something - it is well worth it.   Anyway, I know I didn't really tell any wicked stories or anything. There are many that will be told soon enough, promise!   Thanks for readings.   Jordan.   Ps, thanks for all of your supportive emails - they mean alot to us.
