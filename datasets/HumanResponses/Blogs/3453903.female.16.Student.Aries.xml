      Why is it that when you have a groundbreaking in the middle of the night that you think 'Hell, that's groundbreaking. I'll remember that in the morning for sure,' you never ever do.   I woke up in the middle of the night last night and spent about ten minutes thinking about something before sleep pounced once again and sent me back to sleep. But this morning I could not have said for the life of me what I was thinking about. I know it was something that (to me) was quite interesting. But the content? Forget it.   So that ten minutes of what could have been pure genius are down the pan forever. Shame really. Although, considering my mind's not the most awake of things in the middle of the night (well, 3 o'clock in the morning sort of time) I'm sure it most probably wasn't.

      Recently an influx of books about 'teenage life' have hit the shelves of book shops. Books written by middle-aged women about thirteen- sixteen year olds pretending they know exactly what happens with teenagers today, although what they really have done is read the latest article about teenage kicks in their monthly magazine, presume all teenagers think about is the opposite sex (or the same sex if they're homosexual, although gays never seem to be aknowledged in children's books. No wonder some people find it so hard to 'come out', it's as if they don't exist), the action of sex, their looks and how they appear to both sexes. Oh, with a bit of drugs and alcohol weaved in occasionally.   I've always hated this image portrayed of us. It is bad enough that so many take tabloid stories at face value, but then for people to write books in the first person and pretending to be our age whilst obsessing over things that yes, we may talk about, yes we may be concerned about, but no we do not all obsess about, and the fact that we are portrayed like this is irritating.  I have yet to see or read a book about a teenagers that portrays all characters accurately. I had always wanted to rectify that. Write a novel about a geek and what went on in their life. What really went on in the mind of a teenager. The thoughts and worries about future, about the wider world. Obviously it wouldn't be nearly as interesting to young kids who read it and read about all these girls getting boyfriends by completely disabandoning all their values, changing their personality and revamping their appearance, and think 'hey, that seems like a good idea. Lets have a re-birth and then I might get a boyfriend.   The Jaqueline Wilson  Girls In Love  books were the most accurate. The people in them worried about other things besides the opposite sex. Though not really.  Geez, I sound like a right winger. So go change that situation, I hear you cry. So what if it's boring. Well, I'm not sure. Maybe if I had started it, bowed to the initiative  before  my life became a mixture of working, revision, the internet and my going out with friends every so occasionally then it may have become reality. As it stands I never started that novel. I did, however, get a LiveJournal.

      Sometimes you need to write stuff down where nobody's eyes that you know can see it. To shy away from the bright stage lights and work backstage for a while. This is my backstage working. I may have a LiveJournal, but some things are not for the public knowledge of those who read it, whether they be your best friend or worst enemy. Some things are things you don't want to know people have read. Or are embarrased to write when people don't think of your mind in the way that it works. When my mind wonders it wonders to places who know me don't think it can reach. I think it scares them. I don't think they like seeing that part of me, like a swimmer that is used to the surface of the water, but plunge any further into the murky depths and they panic. They are in unfamilar teritory and they thrash about, ready to sink.  In other words, as you may have already gathered, this is my outlet for waffle. Unlike in my LiveJournal I am not going to apologise for it. You have been forwarned.

      I'm now going to apologise, I've noticed that everything I've written in this blog so far has been a moan or whine or whinge. I don't think I'm like that usually, just so you don't get the wrong impression. I've just been using this for innermost thoughts, and innermost thoughts usually come to me when in a bad mood.   I shouldn't care what complete strangers think about me, really, but I  do  care and so that's the reason I've said this.   Then again, if I wrote my every day thoughts down like I do in LiveJournal then you'd all become terminally bored. Whoever reads this anyway, which I'm guessing isn't many. Gawd that sounded self-pitying, but hey there's not much of a reason to read this unless you know me. And the whole point is for people who know me not to read this.   So yes, just to apologise for the numerous moany entries.

      Why is it that when you feel the need to write something the words fail you? You try to move your fingers about the keys to spurn out your feelings but sometimes it feels like there's a gate or a barrier blocking them.  So one of my best friends is currently telling me via MSN how she's planning to kill herself. Granted, she's an attention seeker, and too happy and undepressed to do so. She's just having a bad night. It's only over a boy and they'll get back together soon anyway. They always do. So why do I feel so disturbed and upset? Why is her discussing overdosing on her parent's perscribed painkillers mixed with alcohol making me feel sick to the soul? And now I want her to stop talking to me because I don't want to have to feel like this. I don't want to have to know what she's thinking, why she's thinking it. Because I'm being selfish and don't want to be laboured with other people's problems.   I'm the worst friend in the world. Why won't I speak to her? Why  can't  I speak to her?   I just want to curl away from problems forever. I can't face them or confront them. I keep running away, and as I do so I just encounter ones that get worse and worse, and because I ran away from them before I don't know how to deal with them, and so I just end up telling them to go to bed and giving advice that's not any good and generally is just shit.   Today was a good day. This has just gone and ruined it all. I need to take my own advice and switch this computer off, leave MSN, empty my mind and sleep.    Sleep, perchance to dream
