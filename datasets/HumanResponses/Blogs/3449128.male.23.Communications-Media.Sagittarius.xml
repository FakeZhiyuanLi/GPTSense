						   "When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army nor be charged with any duty; he shall be free at home one year and shall give happiness to his wife whom he has taken."  Is this not the coolest verse ever? Once married, I am not only obliged, but *ordered* to take an entire YEAR and make it my number one priority to lay some lovin' on the wife :) Well gosh, if you twist my arm like that... Ok, my sister says "That doesn't mean you don't go out and bring home the bacon." I agree. I will of course drag my butt to work every day and put food on the table. Just know that I'm thinking about you all day... I'm *definitely* not staying late... and when I get home it's all about you. What a fun concept...   Anyhow. I just found out that OSU has hit me up for a $4000 Pell grant, as well as $4000 in work-study for the next school year. Basically my tuition's all paid for, and I've got money in the bank for rent and food (and the occasional DVD :) Thanks, Lord. Once I get out I'm gonna get my realtor's license... after a 2-week course and a price tag of twelve hundred bucks, I can sell houses. With my communication skills... not a problem ;) Things are looking up. Finally.

						   I'm home in Pataskala visiting the family... 2 1/2 days of home-cooked meals, crowded bathrooms, sibling rivalry manifested through violent video games and, of course, two weeks worth of dirty laundry to take care of :) It's crazy around here but I enjoy the fact that living around this many people usually results in a great deal of laughter. I brought home a 4'X 3' black and white poster of Johnny Depp sitting at a piano. My sister Ann Marie worships the man and when she walks into her room and sees it on the wall there will be a scream of delight and I will be peppered with kisses. I think that genuinely happy reactions to gifts are some of my favorite things in this world... I like to give gifts and compliments, not only because they bless people, but because it does do a little something for me... I'm a sucker for presents myself, and I guess I like to show my affection that way because I know it works :) Anyhow. I am in the process of losing 30 pounds... I've gone from 230 to 225 in the last week so hopefully I can keep this up. I have a closet full of AWESOME clothes that will only fit the man I was 8 months ago.. SOOO, instead of rotating the same 3 pairs of  "fat pants" like I've been doing since about October, I'm determined to slim down to the 2-miles-a-day, lifting-four-times-a-week beast I was last summer :) It's always easier when I have romantic incentive... (*sigh*) That way, I want to look good, AND I don't bother to eat :) Double whammy. Hm. Gotta go running now.

						   It's wednesday. I'm done with class. I think I'm going to go back home and watch a movie... maybe "Lost in Translation". I found myself scrolling down through the names and numbers I have saved in my phone, and there were fewer people than I'd like to admit that I think I could just call at some random hour of the night and have a fun conversation. Am I antisocial? I dunno. When I get in the right groups I have a lot of fun and laughs... it's my favorite thing in the world, really. Why is it so hard for me to initiate casual friendships? I think my definition of friendship is maybe a little too deep and dedicated.. it's like, if I haven't known you for half my life then it's hard for me to see you as a "die-hard" friend. There are a few people that I've just clicked with, or that shared some deeply emotional (or perhaps painful) times with me, therefore creating a unique bond of some sort... but when I look at myself I find that most of the people in my life are either (the few) people I would die for in an instant... or just casual, disposable acquaintances. I'm not sure I like that about myself. Am I afraid of something? I don't know. Ponder ponder ponder.

						   I have finally succumed to this Great Evil... the BLOG. I can't even find time to journal to myself...what is it about making it accessible to the World that makes it suddenly an attractive venture? I guess I'm one of those people who always creates with an audience in mind, and this is a sort of outlet for that. Ah well. Here goes nothing. Come on world, pick my brain.

						   I have less than a week to go. Spring quarter is just about done and although I'll be back here in just a couple weeks, it'll be nice to have a little window of Me-time. I can get up and go running every day... do some reading... watch a few movies... maybe write some music. It's too bad that my grades this quarter are going to be the worst EVER but this has just been a super-crazy emotional quarter for me... If you're anything like me (and I know I am) you know that anything worth pondering is worth pondering WELL. That is a major weakness of mine... call it worrying or daydreaming or whatever you want, but to me it's all the same. A major mental/emotional undertaking can replace all other potential thoughts and make it Oh-so-hard for me to get anything done. Will Ferrell as Harry Caray; "If you had to choose between gettin' mad cow disease and being the top scientist in your field, which would you pick?" Jeff Goldblum, trying not to laugh: "Well of course I would choose to be the top scientist in my field..." Ferrell: "Oh, thank goodness. I was afraid you'd choose mad cow." Goldblum: "Why would you think that?" Ferrell: "I guess I'm just a worrier... that's why my friends call me Whiskers." I guess I'm just a worrier. Call me Whiskers, folks. Here's some random romantic poetry to pass the time.  "Arranged Marriage"  That grainy home video will never do justice to the shy face I kissed that day in April. I was only six, but I'll remember your eighth birthday party forever and the way you giggled, blushed, and kissed me back while my mom snapped the picture I still keep in my wallet.  "I like you more than candy or toys or fun" was my attempt at a balcony scene  and I'll never forget the way you smiled, with your eyes, when I reached through the open car window and handed you the drooping bouquet of violets that matched your dress. The few times I've seen you since then, I think of that day and wonder if you remember the flowers. When I looked up just now and saw you ordering your coffee I just knew mine was bound to get cold. Hi, how are you, what a surprise! (I'm six again) Remember that picture your mom always kept on the piano? You know, the one of you in your ballet shoes? No really, I think it's adorable. You still bite the corner of your lip whenever I say something sweet... At six I didn't really notice, but I realize now how much I love that. You're so graceful, even now, without the shoes... and it blows my mind that the prettiest girl I ever knew is still all by herself in this world.  Yeah, my coffee's cold. So what.

						   “Sir, I’ve just had an apostrophe…” -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mister Smee  &nbsp; There’s a difference between a woman who is overly aggressive, forceful and demanding, and one who is simply driven and focused enough to accomplish all the things she knows she is capable of doing. I used to think that in describing women, “ambitious” and “organized” were red flags for the overbearing, nit-picky, go-go-go career women who never really find time for simple pleasures. As I am one of God’s more relaxed, ethereal, “kum buy yah” creatures, it has recently been brought to my attention that a woman with analytical tendencies and linear thinking would be better suited to accompany me through the majority of my life than, oh, basically every girl I have ever pursued up to this point in my life. I have a history of falling for sweet, demure, clingy girls. The resulting relationships have sp(yawn)ed a host of cute little sessions where I strut around feeling like the Big Strong Hero and the Girl On My Arm keeps letting me know how Very Good I am to her. You know the type. We were in a restaurant booth once and the girls next to us kept giggling to each other because she kept her arm in mine while we ate.&nbsp; This kind of sickeningly unrealistic social expression of affection was of course nice for me because my ego got pampered, and there was absolutely posilutely no question of who had the cajones in the relationship.   &nbsp; She did, of course. Well, technically they still belonged to me…. But she had ‘em locked up all nice and tight in a couple of those little hinged metal balls with the hook that you can brew loose tea leaves in…. Cough  AnyHway,&nbsp; I’ve been told (and shown, repeatedly) that this situation is roughly on par with picking my nose in regards to its potential to nurture me relationally, spiritually and emotionally. I have seen the light. I was saying that someone more a) capable and b) confident in themselves than the mute, doe-eyed arm trophies I have previously courted might be what I am looking for in a significant other. What scared me away from confidence and drive in women before was the fact that there are so many “Drill Sergeant” stereotypes. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life with a woman who wants to wear the pants or has no respect for my role as a husband and father. Right?   ***NEWS BULLETIN***  &nbsp;I AM CERTAIN… that God did indeed create AT LEAST ONE WOMAN WHO IS CURRENTLY UNMARRIED AND WITHIN MY DEMOGRAPHIC who has exhibited drive, ambition, and purpose in life,.. without shedding traits that are specifically and divinely granted to those who will go on to be godly wives and mothers. It’s a simple point, really. Just that God has someone perfect for me and I need to not worry about it; just pray for her every day, and know that all things will be made known in due time.

						   As I have gone a month without blogging, I feel like something of a failure. Am I just so boring that I don't have anything to write about? I guess only James Bond would have an interesting-enough Real Life to just blog about his every day life. "Flew a state-of-the-art supersonic jet today.... later, parachuted over the Andes mountains with an exotic supermodel, Ivanna.... prevented a nuclear holocaust by infiltrating a secret underground Soviet base in Wisconsin... worked off all of my pent-up aggression by ravaging Q's secretary..." Needless to say, I can't match that. So. I was inspired by "ListenHereYou" to just start spouting off things that make me happy.  Being in love More specifically, holding hands and being nervous about it Playing Tetris and building up a perfect wall and seeing that LINE in the "next" box Buying a new DVD and having to shuffle all of the discs in my case in one direction or another to fit the new one in.  Venting on the piano and stumbling across a really Great chord progression Having ALL of the ingredients necessary for the Perfect Omelette (Eggs, red onions, diced; green pepper, chopped; mushrooms, chopped; honey ham, finely chopped... and shredded pepperjack cheese. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...) Listening to "Turn Me On" by Norah Jones. I will marry Norah Jones.  more tomorrow.

						   Holy Frijoles, Look.  I'm blogging twice within the same fiscal year. Alert the media. Anyway, I'm actually working the front desk for the first time EVER at the Prior Health Services Library at OSU and since this is the first time ever that there have been NO books to shelve (I usually spend most of my time shelving "The American Journal of Oncology and Gynocology, V. 5") I find myself with an abnormal amount of time to sit and twiddle my thumbs. Not complaining, but the amount of down time is somehow unnerving. But hey. I might as well comment on some of the things that have gone on lately, as well as a continued list of the things that make me happy. I am continuing to teach myself guitar, and of course I play the piano every day that I have the opportunity. I love music. There's something about creating and playing music that is for me a sort of thinking out loud. I like to just sort of vent the day's emotions/ musical inspirations whenever I find the time. I find that it pleases my family and friends whenever I stumble upon a particularly unique chord progression or musical theme and it's the one thing that I genuinely feel I do well. So. I also found a great deal of pleasure in Susanna's latest blog session, in which Ann Marie decided to name a couple of stuffed ducks "Gomez" and "Hashim". I laughed. My best friend Matt Bartley is back in town from seminary in Los Angeles, which makes me happy. I also have 1 1/2 pounds of ground sirloin in my fridge at home, as well as gourmet buns, sliced tomato, lettuce, red onion, and all the necessary condiments. I am gonna Grill Out at 10:00 at night, and as unhealthy as it may be to go to bed with a stomach full of hamburgers, I'm looking forward to it. I love Tetris. I am a Tetris diety. I just recently cracked 500,000 points for the first and second times, which is no small matter. You have to understand, a Tetris (four lines at once) is worth 12,000 points, if you start your "A" game on the 9th level. What I consider a "perfect" gave would consist of 200 lines of only Tetrises. That would be 50 Tetrises @ 12,000 points apiece, equalling 600,000 points. Basically any game I play I just look at my total score and divide it by the number of lines... the closer I come to 3,000 per line, the closer I am to a perfect game. The closest I have ever come is something like 512,000 points and 180-some lines. That is REALLY close. And yes, I am a complete and total Nerd for having figured all of this out. But hey, a Tetris god must spend a bit of time contemplating his mastery.  I also found the second season of "The Sopranos" on DVD. I'm trying to collect that series, as well as "The Simpsons" . The "Indiana Jones" trilogy came out on DVD a while ago, and I found it at CD Warehouse for a dirt cheap price. Yay. I'm up to 170-some DVDs now, and while some people may criticize my seemingly outrageous spending habits where DVDs are concerned, you must realize that movies are the only things (other than food) that I spend money on. They are my Hobby, my Collection. So There. And hey, when you hang out with me, we will always have the option of watching Virtually Any Movie Worth Watching. Aaaaaaaaaanyhoo. I am about done here. It has been brought to my attention (by certain opinions that Genuinely Matter To Me) that I need to Blog more. So I shall. Promise. Buh bye.
