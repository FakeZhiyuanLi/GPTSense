       urlLink This  was intriguing enough to warrant further searches for the "Esplanade Riel." Turns out, its a  urlLink pedestrian bridge  build alongside the Provencher Bridge in Winnipeg. Not your typical pedestrian bridge, the Esplanade Riel provides for restaurant space smack in the middle of the bridge. Unfortunately, piping water and sewage to the restaurant cost in excess of a million dollars (the bridge itself went spectacularly over-budget), and no entrepreneurial restauranteur is up to the challenge.    urlLink    The stunning Esplanade Riel&nbsp; urlLink     Harper's mockery has cast a fair amount of negative light on Murray, a "star" Liberal candidate, who rushed to defend his "signature project." Murray's philosophy concerning stewardship of the public purse is  urlLink well known :    Every once in a while, as fiscally prudent as you have to be, you also need a little extravagance to get people excited," Murray says.    A little extravagance to get people excited? How "excited" does Murray think Winnipegers get paying their property taxes, especially when they know that it will likely be flitted away on the mayor's current fancy?  Murray's Conservative opponent, Steven Fletcher, was fairly insightful in noting that, "Glen Murray and the Liberals deserve eachother...They both waste our money on unnecessary ventures." Exactly.  Also: As was pointed out  urlLink here , Murray was not always such a strident proponent of bridge construction. Things are getting rough for the Liberal star in a  urlLink riding  that was a classic example of vote-splitting on the right in 2000 [the combined Alliance-PC vote here in 2000 was roughly 20% (!) more than the winning Liberal candidate's share of the vote].   By a great coincidence, I am leaving to go to Winnipeg in roughly three hours. Hopefully I will have time to scope out the Esplanade Riel, and (if the conditions are right) utilize its million-dollar fixture.

      Martin advisor  urlLink Francis Fox  upon discovering that Alfonso Gagliano has, in the fourth day of the election campaign, filed a 4.5m lawsuit against Paul Martin over the PM's handling of the sponsorship scandal:  "This is not a bad story for us.

      Jack-o is currently in trouble for suggesting that Paul Martin's cuts to affordable housing programs while finance minister contributed to an increase in homelessness and an increase in deaths among the homeless. I especially liked  urlLink Paul Well's  response:   Jack Layton may or may not be right that Paul Martin holds responsibility for the death of homeless Torontonians. But as a general proposition, it's not only clear that public policy can affect the manner and rate of human death —  it's obvious .   But of course Layton is in a world of trouble. Here in Canada, we like our public debates as vapid and divorced from reality as we can get them.   Also notable was Paul Martin's impassioned response: "Mr. Layton is condemned by his statements."   Huh?  Paul put on his sad face and delivered another round of PDS (Paulian Disingenuous Sanctimony):  "There will be many blows in politics and some of them are going to be low. I think that kind of statement reflects more on Mr. Layton than anything else...It's exactly the kind of remark that discourages them (young people), and I think it is most unfortunate...Politics is about the clash of ideas and I'm quite prepared to take Jack Layton on on his ideas."   Hello?  Which party  urlLink leaked its attack ads  two weeks before the election campaign even began?

      So far in the campaign…  1.) Has Harper received any negative coverage? 2.) Has Martin received ANY positive coverage?   Now, I laughed as hard as the next guy when Liberal MPs called Martin’s entourage the “ urlLink mistake-a-day-club,” the "no-brainer trust," the B-team, and a bunch of idiots . The dignified and lady-like Carolyn Parrish did these MPs one better by referring to Martin’s coterie as “sneering little, sniveling little shits.” But the mistake-a-day-club has outdone itself thus far in the campaign. Could someone point me toward any positive coverage Martin has received?   urlLink    Keep up the good work, Paul!&nbsp; urlLink     In contrast, Harper’s campaign has been, up until this point, flawless. He received  urlLink great coverage  even in areas that might have been considered hostile up until this point (Quebec and Atlantic Canada).  The next question is: When will mid-campaign polling begin to reflect this?

       Who  in their right mind would reject the assistance of the great and mighty Joseph Charles Clark?? What on earth was Jim Prentice thinking in rejecting Joe's help? There must be some explanation....  Alas, the resourceful and egotisical Mr. Clark has uncovered the real reason (from the Toronto Star):   Clark said there are two candidates for the new Conservative party for whom he would consider campaigning — Jim Prentice in Calgary North Centre and Ted Menzies in Macleod — but that they might not want to anger their leader, Stephen Harper, by inviting him.   Ah, now everything falls into place. No sane person would reject Joe's campaign assistance; Jim Prentice was actually instructed by Harper to spite Joe. I see, I see.  Can anyone say "cognitive dissonance"?   Which leaves one question open: why would "the devil we don't know" be so adamently opposed to his candidates recieving help from Clark, while the "devil we do know" is apparently fine and dandy with it?  Furthermore, Clark's pick-and-choose campaign ("Clark said he was urging Canadians to support the person and not the party.") contains some fairly tough logical flaws. For one thing, who would form a government once Canadians have completed their task of choosing super-fantastic candidates without reference to parties? Who would become the prime minister under such a mish-mash of loose fish?   Ah, my friend, how little you know of the mind of Charles Joseph Clark. Once assembled, the "good" MPs (as opposed to those naughty "bad" MPs, Harper included) would put their heads together and select as prime minister, the smartest, most articulate, most visionary, and most handsome politician ever to ascend The Hill.  Who?  Thats right........  urlLink    You like me, you really like me!&nbsp; urlLink

      Joe Clark has taken his traveling bitch-campaign against Stephen Harper to the good people of Kings-Hants, where pro-merger PC turned Conservative turned born-again Liberal Scott Brison is in a tough fight against the new Conservative candidate, Bob Mullan. Joe and Scott skipped down main street Wolfville together, showering one another with praise, causing Joe’s head to become, er, large. Speaking of swelling, holy cow Joe...  urlLink    Scott and Big Joe&nbsp; urlLink    The Rt. Honourable Joe is continuing his pick-and-choose campaign leading up to the election. For Clark, Paul is purgatory and Harper is hell, so better to go with the former. But in the meantime, Joe will throw his support behind those candidates he deems worthy, whether they be Liberal or Conservative. Brison is one of the blessed few lucky enough to receive Joe’s endorsement. Lucky lucky!  Clark, however, is a bit more circumspect about his choices in his own riding of Calgary South-Centre. The Globe and Mail reported that:   Mr. Clark, who said he would cast a secret ballot in Calgary South Centre on voting day, stated he would support a handful of candidates who were not Conservatives and encouraged all Canadians to vote for individuals rather than along party lines.   A secret ballot? But wait a moment, wasn't the Conservative candidate in that riding, Jim Prentice, one of the annointed few that Clark would vote for? Sure was (from the CBC):   Clark said that in the next election, Canadians should not vote for parties but for the best candidate in their constituency. Clark said he's prepared to support candidates from all parties, including an old political rival, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent, who is running in Ottawa.  And he said he would be working for [Jim] Prentice in his old riding.   So what has changed between then and now?  This has  (from the G & M):   A spokesman for former party leadership contestant Jim Prentice rejected Mr. Clark's offer to campaign for Mr. Prentice in his Calgary riding.  Mr. Clark hadn't yet made such an offer in person and "if and when he does, he will be told that it would be inappropriate because Jim does not share his assessment of the leader and the party," Jason Hatcher said yesterday.    and (from the Toronto Star):   Joe Clark's advice to bewildered voters took on a faintly comical air last week, when the candidate to whom he offered his support promptly rejected it.....It turned out that he [Clark] hadn't shared this news with Prentice, one of the party's star candidates. When the 47-year-old lawyer heard that Clark was planning to back him, he swiftly quashed the idea. "It's difficult to accept his support since we don't agree about Stephen Harper and we don't agree on the new Conservative party," Prentice pointed out.   Too bad the people reporting on Joe's triumphant appearance in the waiting arms of Scott Brison didn't mention that Brison is fairly exceptional in actually  wanting  Joe's help.

      Does anyone else think that Paul Martin is not helping himself lately with all this pre-election policy-on-the-fly?   The first, and best, example includes the Liberals' new plan on gas taxes. Stephen Harper pre-empted the Libs on the issue and Ralph Goodale, the finance minister, was left studdering in response. A few hours later, though, the finance department had its own gas tax policy ready to go, Goodale was briefed, and he made a triumphant return to TV land. Gratifyingly, journalists described the day as an exercise in " urlLink eating Conservative dust ." (Here, incidentally, is a retro pic of Ralph, prior to his being inspired by the quaff of Archie Bunker and his discovery of the funky-ass spectacles shop frequently, er, frequented by Joe Clark.)  urlLink    Retro-Ralph&nbsp; urlLink     A few days later, Anne McLellan and Reg Alcock emerged to announce  urlLink revisions to the old gun control act , including a cap on spending. Trouble is, the minister responsible for gun control had no idea the changes were coming, and was  urlLink a little peeved by the whole thing . Oopsies! Liberal backbenchers, a restive bunch lately, also voiced dissatisfaction with the changes.   The same day (I think) Paul Martin wandered into Toronto with local MPs Dennis Mills and Joe Volpe to announce a boatload of spending on the development of the Toronto waterfront. For the event, the mayor o' Toronto  urlLink "snubbed"  Martin and the premier, Dalton McGuinty, was off hiding in a bunker somewhere and unable to attend. The normally sympathetic Toronto Star published a  urlLink scathing editorial  on the announcement, claiming that Martin had recycled the announcements for no other reason than to boost the electoral fortunes of Volpe and Mills (the latter, incidentally, has the honour of facing off against Jack Layton in Toronto-Danforth).   Seems to me like a pretty piss-poor way to run a country.

      My name is Peter Cornelius Rempel. I am bored tonight, and have decided to begin a blog. So here you are.  Not, to be truthful, that this is an entirely spontaneous act. I have recently discovered  urlLink Paul Well's blog  on the Macleans website, which is, I think, consistently the most delightful read on the 'net. From there I linked to Kevin Michael Grace's blog,  urlLink The Ambler , which is equally entertaining but somewhat less agreeable.  urlLink Recent stories  about the blogging habits of a very naughty staffer in a US Senator's office have not discouraged me from beginning such a blog, although viewers interested in similiar stories here may be disappointed. Sorry.  Nor, to be truthful, is the idea entirely new to me. Fully 2.5 years ago, before blogging was cool (if indeed it is; I hope not, it would be nice to be on the cusp of something) a friend maintained a similiar online rant-source. I speculated that he should consider himself lucky if any animate object besides himself ever cast a glance on the site, and thereon in referred to him with the entirely appropriate term "cyber-wanker" to commemorate his solitary and apparently satisfying online activity. Karma has, aparently, taken a chunk out of my backside, and here I am.   Later!

      Nice to see that Morton kept his cool on election night:   What's clear is that the next government will likely be more left-leaning than Liberal governments of the past. And Conservative Alberta was already showing signs of a backlash last night.  "I haven't understood Ontario in the past and I don't understand it now," said Ted Morton, an adviser to Mr. Harper and champion of democratic reform.   Good thing. After the 2000 election, Stephen Harper himself gave up on reforming Canada at the federal level. Now, the priority of Albertan Conservatives should be to get Morton elected, into the Alberta cabinet and, eventually, into the premier's office.

      Albertans are feeling spurned once again, and so once again alienation is taking off. Don Braid had an awesome column in the Herald today; heres an excerpt:   This will be very frustrating," says Roger Gibbins, president of the Canada West Foundation. "Paul Martin said he was going to end western alienation and then he ran a campaign against Alberta.  "I don't know if this is actually dangerous at this point, but it certainly is troubling."  Gibbins says that after "bumping its head against the stump" one more time, the  Conservatives are going to have to ask themselves what they have to do to win.  For the Liberals, the technique for winning is absolutely clear. Divide the country regionally -- without, of course, ever attacking Quebec.  "What Martin will do now," says Gibbins, "is say he has to build bridges with the West."   And so Albertans are dissatisfied with their place in the federation. So what? Nothing ever happens. Threats are not taken seriously by Ottawa because they are not made seriously. Albertans are wimps.   A perfect example: Prior to the provincial PC Party's policy convention in Red Deer a few months ago, the Fraser Institute released two studies clearly meant to push the party in a more Alberta First direction. One recommended the adoption of a provincial police force ( urlLink here ) while the other advocated the creation of a provincial pension plan. Both papers were carted up to the convention and went, I was told, like hotcakes. The party's response? Form a silly little task force headed by Ian McClelland to examine "Alberta's place in Canada," with, of course, the proviso that separation is off the table. Ooh, big threat there. So instead, the committee held its hearings ( urlLink here  is coverage of the most star-studded one), stonewalled masterfully, and Albertans have been pacified.   So, Alberta, don't complain when the Liberals sandbag you and Ontarians buy it. Its worked for decades. If Albertans want to solve it, they know what to do. Start by asserting the province's juristiction against the federal marauders.

      Did anyone catch Scott Brison's victory speech last night after his surprising, come-from-behind victory? What an ingracious, braying jackass. The entire speech was a re-hash of his over-publicized rant against Stephen Harper. I'll admit it, I laughed the first time I heard the "Stockwell Day with a library card" line. But Brison deserves a kick in the ass for every subsequent time he's used the line.   Some columnist today opined that Brison was cleverly using his time to influence the votes of British Columbians; we still had some time left to vote when Brison mounted the stage to deliver his speech. That seems like a rather disingenuous apology for what is indisputable poor taste. How many British Columbians who a) had not yet voted with an hour left, and yet b) were sitting there watching the election returns thought c) "well! if Brison says so..."   The CBC also managed to snag Brison and Peter MacKay into a joint interview. There is, of course, little love lost between the two of 'em. Lets remember that MacKay whupped Brison for the leadership of the PC Party a few months earlier. Brison may be envious, but I have it on unimpeachable good authority that Scott's animosity runs a bit deeper than that. The two went to university together, where MacKay was a popular and smart rugby player, while Brison was, well, a socially-awkward invert. Did something just snap when MacKay beat Brison for he leadership?   jackass&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Also too bad about the Brison win was that a quality Conservative candidate, Dr. Bob Mullan, lost out. This guy was awesome. His speaking style reminded me of Ted Morton's, for some reason.   On the matter of Conservative traitors, on the other hand, we can report that the other character from NS, John Herron, was handily beaten by the Conservative last night.

      Thats right, I was written about on the blog of an NDP candidate from Lethbridge Alberta. After reading one of her posts, I made a snide comment about latte-swillin' NDs or something. She responded with the following:   I won't mention you name but ... : It is so refreshing to see a right-winger read lefty stuff. I must say if you knew me you'd know I don't drink lattes. And I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "ND types." I happen to believe in people. I picked the party that believes in and sticks up for people. I'm not any "type." I'm just Melanee.   Thanks for having the gumption to put your name to your comments. That I really appreciate. ;)   Ms. Thomas receieved roughly 9% of the popular vote in Lethbridge constituency which, I gather, is fairly respectable for an ND in southern Alberta. One of the Liberals' star candidates, former Alberta Liberal leader Ken Nicol, fizzled in this riding (much like red giant Glen Murray in Winnipeg). Not that Nicol was cursing Melanee's name for splitting the left-wing vote; the Conservative candidate won 62% of the popular vote [Today, Crowfoot MLA Kevin Sorenson was reported as sniffing, "ONLY 62%?"]. Lets just say Stephen Harper did not periodically pipe up with a nervous "Whats happening in LETHBRIDGE?" last night while the results were coming in.   Ms. Thomas also seems fairly pleasant, which leaves one to wonder why it is she's associated with the party she is.

      Martin and his justice minister, Irwin Cotler, have launched a new assault on Harper, this one on Harper's stated intention to "kick the shit out of that wussy document the Charter of Rights and Freedoms" (see the new Conservative platform). Check out Martin's little civics lesson:   "In a nation like Canada," Martin explained, "we have got to ensure that minority rights are protected when challenged by the majority. And the only way in which you can do this is to have a Charter, which is ultimately interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada."   [Was CTV's use of the word "explained" supposed to be ironic? It was to me.]  You heard it here first, folks. The  only  way to protect minority rights is to have some sort of written bill of rights. Which, of course, means that every other democratic state in the world that does not have such a Charter is sadly lacking in its protection of minority rights. You know, like the United Kingdom, that wasteland of minority repression and persecution.   Martin also harped on about the evil notwithstanding clause:   "I would not use the notwithstanding clause," Martin said. "And if what you're prepared to do is use the notwithstanding clause, then what you're saying essentially is minority rights can be subjected to the will of the majority.   But if notwithstanding is such a grave threat to fundamental human rights, why was section 33 even included in the Charter? That Chretien guy must have been responsible, somehow.

      Saw the latest Liberal attack ad tonight (do they have any gentle, friendly ads?). This one featured Martin focussing attention on Harper's breast-beating statement made a while back where he claimed that Canada under his leadership would be unrecognizable. Martin's response is to claim that Canadians don't want the radical change proposed by "Mr. Harper, Mr. Day, or Mr. Manning."   Come on. Does the Liberal braintrust seriously think that anyone will respond to attacks against Preston Manning? Why don't they take a few jabs at Diefenbaker while they're at it?   Yes yes, I know. The idea here is to beef up the perception that Harper is a scary guy. Linking him to the Alliance and the Reform Party is a handy-dandy way to do so. But its time that Herle and Berle and Merle and Steve MacKinnon figured out that this approach has been a complete flop, even to my surprise. Harper just isn't coming across as threatening or extreme.   -------------------------------------------  On the topic of TV ads, I also caught Layton's new ad. Jack starts out by noting that, "An election campaign is supposed to be about ideas. Here are some NDP ideas to make a difference for you [or something, I'm paraphrasing again]."   Great! What with the other leaders just talking trash, finally we have the NDP to present some original, innovative ideas. So what are these shiny new ideas?: "improve health care...protect pensions...make government more accountable..."   Yeah, way to distinguish yourself Jack. You almost sound like Big Scary Preston.

      Sorry, but I just can't seem to let the commando raids bit go. Harper's response to Sgro is priceless:    When Ms. Sgro attempted to confront Mr. Harper over Conservative MP Rob Merrifield's comment that women considering an abortion should be required to be counselled by a third party, Mr. Harper brushed past her and scoffed: "You better go door knocking Judy, you're going down in your riding."   Don MacDonald also has a mocking article on the whole affair here. I found this bit quite amusing:    Veterans Affairs Minister John McCallum equally made a fool of himself with his own intervention at a later stop in Markham. Caught up in mostly a friendly crowd of Conservatives displaying their support for Mr. Harper, the Liberal minister pushed his way to the Conservative leader.    If we've learned one thing in the past couple of days, its: don't make an ass of yourself while caught in a "friendly crowd of Conservatives":   urlLink    take that, young man!&nbsp; urlLink     Hehe, check out the hearing aid....

      It seemed appropriate to give an update on the "Littler Commando Raids" situation, despite that most people seem to have written it off as yet another Liberal mis-step during the course of this campaign. Yesterday, however, Mr. Earnscliffe himself David Herle was questioned about the strategy by CPAC (heres a link to a CTV story on it):   Herle admitted in a previous interview on CPAC that cabinet ministers Judy Sgro and John McCallum were instructed to pursue and confront Harper at his campaign stops in Markham last week.   Good good, nice to see someone taking responsibility. Hmmmmmm, but it doesn't seem to jive with Judy Sgro's comments earlier this week:   Ms. Sgro, meanwhile, said yesterday she felt she had to stand up for her rights.....She said  she was not given direction by the campaign team . Rather, she sent an e-mail to her campaign manager describing what she had planned. That e-mail was in turn forwarded to Mr. Littler, who had no objections.   Ouchies. Is something burning?

      Sorry folks, but my previous time away from my computer in rainy Winnipeg has meant that I have been catching up on some campaign news. Unfortunately, it seems that I missed perhaps the funniest incident in the cmpaign thus far. The Liberal braintrust thought it might be a good idea to dispatch hecklers to disrupt Stephen Harper's cmpaign events. They also apparently thought, "Hey! Why send some anonymous shmuck when we have all these well-paid cabinet ministers sitting around doing nothing?" So, ministers John McCallum and Judy Sgro were dispatched to scream at Harper. Here is McCallum gettin' at 'er. Harper's wife, Laureen, just looks thrilled:   urlLink    Scary John&nbsp; urlLink     John McCallum, incidentally, was one of the Liberal star candidates in 2000 who was recruited to bump off the Alliance's ONLY Ontario MP, Jim Jones, in Markham. Since then, he has been a rather bumbling minister in all his roles. Here is his reply to a query concerning whether the national Liberal campaign team put him up to the stunt:    "I'm not saying they did or they didn't," he said yesterday. "But I ended up doing it and wanted to take this opportunity to pass him the letter to suggest any time, any place because it's something I feel very strongly about, the combination of higher military spending and the lower taxes. . . . I'll debate that with anyone."   Not the most articulate guy. But he is also a former chief economist at the Royal Bank. Judy Sgro has clearly found her calling in life, but couldn't the campaign find something better for McCallum to do than this?

      Whoever thought that this would ever be seen in Fortress Liberal?:   The Conservative Party is within striking distance of forming a minority government, says a new poll. It is essentially tied with the Liberals nationally, and leads in Ontario for the first time in 19 years.  "The Liberals are falling through the floor. In effect, we have a new frontrunner," said Craig Oliver, CTV News's Ottawa bureau chief.   Which means that (very) roughly fifty incumbent Liberal MPs in Ontario are facing defeat in a couple of weeks. It will be interesting to see how they "contribute" to the remainder of the campaign.

       "Liberal Leader Paul Martin phoned his war room Sunday to congratulate his strategists on a good first week. His call came amid plummeting opinion polls and whispers of concern from candidates and local campaign workers about the sorry state of the national campaign."

      Paul Wells today notes that:    Phone-in shows and online forums are abuzz with word that this is, dammit, the laaaaaaaast straw, and Alberta will finally secede.  Enjoy the humour of the situation: There's a province where the Liberal vote went up and where Liberal MPs held their own.  And there's a province where the Liberal vote went down and where a large number of Liberal MPs were beaten by Conservatives.  The place where Liberals held their own, of course, is Alberta. The place where Liberals posted losses, of course, is Ontario.  It is reassuring to note that Alberta separatists are no brighter than their cousins in Quebec.   Wells has sometimes shown a preference for cleverness over logical thought, and this is such a case.   So Martin was slightly less repulsive to Albertans than was Jean Chretien. So what? Certainly, the Liberals "held their own" in Alberta, but "their own" included a startlingly non-whopping 2 seats. And even this isn't cast in stone: David Kilgour's slim win is, as we speak, going to a recount. And anyway, as every real Albertan knows, Edmonton, where McLellan and Kilgour are from, is not really Alberta.   Bzzzzzzzt. Try again, Paul.
