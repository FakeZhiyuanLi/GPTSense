      Soph just found out that it is James' baby. she recognised the guy at the club, and he convinced her that they used a condom. so that's almost a relief. but the BEST part is that James proposed to Soph last night! she said yes. ofcourse she did.  (krissie)   i did have sex with  aaron and im still waiting for the results of a home pregnancy test.i will write in yes or no when i am finished. but even if i AM pregnant, the baby is his!!!!!!!    oh. my. god.i AM pregnant. SHIT. at least me and soph are gonna be due on the same day. but how can i tell her? ANd how can i tell Aaron! im gonna kill him. he showed me the condoms when i arrived for the night!  luv, Soph and Krissie xxxxxxx

      seriously our lives are fucked. soph had a one night stand with some guy she doesnt even know his name. i think she's pregnant, she cant remember using a condom! but, as soph is my twin (im krissie), i dunno wot to do. we cant get an abortion, but we cant tell our parents. but her boyfriend james is convinced it will be his (Although Soph totally loves james) (he found out by accident) this was 4 weeks ago. on soph and i's 14 birthday!!!!! so we dont know what to do. OW! oops. my thong got caught on my bum then, hence the name 'thongs' on our address. so. i dunno wot to do.  and the other problem is that our dad keeps hitin us. im terrified if soph is pregnant, and he hits her in the stomach and she misscarriages!!!! so. we are stuck. and if we go out on sunday down the park, the likely hood is that i will get pregnant also - after all, me and soph never do things alone. HELP!!!! i also fancy this guy called Aaron. he is soooo buff you cant imagine it! BUT i cant remember anything that happened when i slept around his house in a tent in the back garden. i have a fear we might have had sex. i cant let soph know this, as she would kill me,  even though it was on the same night as her one night stand.  oh no!!! i just remembered! my last period was 2 months ago, before the night with Aaron! SHIT! i need 2 know if our older bro would beat up james and aaron for getting us pregnant. He's got a short fuse and he could get all his 16 year old mates to beat the shit out of them. FUCK! luv, Soph and Krissie xxx

      (Krissie) well. it seems i have the best luck in the world. i am pregnant with aarons baby and he loves sophie not me. im going insane here. i dunno what i gonna do. and i cant afford an abortion! SHIT SHIT SHIT. (soph) well. i hate aaron for trying to split up me and james. i mean we are still together and are happy to be expecting a baby but aaron is trying to ruin everything. its driving me mad.  on the funnyer side or things, my friend Tara gave me some advice which i am going to share with you now: if you want to give a boy head, a week in advance, tell him to drink pineapple juice, two glasses a day. then the 'you-know-what' will taste alot sweeter. lol ;) enjoy!
