      So I'm battling anxiety apparently.  I haven't officially been diagnosed with an anxiety condition, nor have I 100% concluded that is what is going on myself, but given the symptoms I have combined with my many doctor visits of late, and you get an overwhelming indication that this is all in my head.   As I lay here imagining what is going on in my chest, my mind is subtly sending out chemicals and messages to my body that something bad is going to happen.  Why?  Because I subconciously want something bad to happen?  Because I expect something bad to happen?  I want to live a long, healthy life.  Why would my subconcious betray me like this and tell my body that something is horribly wrong when my doctor is assuring me that I am perfectly fine (minus some inflammed rib / breastbone cartilage)?  All I know is that I want to get back to the way I felt two days before May 14th.  That was when this all started.  I would give up all of the gains I have made in becoming more outgoing if I could remove this near-constant feeling that something is going to happen to me.  I wish I could convey how great it is to be oblivious to some of the simple truths everyone will face at some point in their life.  We will all die at some point, everyone realizes this but not many people think about it.  As young adults we carry with us an almost invincible feeling.  Up until about 3 months ago the worst thing that had happened to me was a broken foot.  I never once considered that I might die.  Now I think about it almost daily.  What kind of life is that to live?  Constantly watching some invisible clock, calculating when I might go?  It's not much of a life.  I have to get my mental state back to a nice balance of invincibility as well as the new caution I have learned that tomorrow isn't guaranteed and your health is one thing you should always care about.

      There are thousands of things I could be doing right now, but I choose to write a blog entry.  Why?  Because I have nothing better to do?  No, I could be doing any number of things that would be much more exciting.  I feel the need to connect with people.  To leave something of myself behind.  I want someone to discover this post 50 years from now and make a connection with me.  If pressed for an answer on the meaning of life, I believe that would be my answer, to connect.   How often do you pass someone on the street and wonder what their life is like?  What they do for a living, are they in a relationship, what do they do with their friends?  Do I do this because my life is unexciting to me?  Is it not fulfilling enough?  Or do I do it because I wish to connect with someone.  I want to know that someone out there is going through the same things I am.  Or do I just want someone to sympathize with my pain, revel in my joy, and share my experiences.  How do you find someone and connect at that level?  Is it through shared experiences that you grow together?  Or a deeper connection that isn't tangible?  Something that pulls the two of you together against all explanation.  I have yet to meet someone that I feel absolutely comfortable and trustful of.  That is more likely due to shortcomings on my part than another's.  Tomorrow I journey to the Lake of the Ozarks and party cove.  Where I doubt I will find my soulmate, but a good time should not be hard to find.  If I make it back in one piece I'll continue to ponder the mysteries of life.

      Do you ever stop to wonder what the purpose of your life is?  If you are surrounded by people who love you, if you are in love, if you are focused on your job I imagine you don't stop to think about your life too often.  All too often I imagine doing something grand with my life, something that people would write about or remember long after I'm gone.  I picture that happening, striving for that goal, and then when I imagine what it would feel like to obtain it, it doesn't make me feel like my life would be any more fulfilling.  The only thing I am missing in my life right now is love.  I have friends, money, etc...but I have no great love.  No one to hold at night or spend an afternoon with.  I can't imagine anything more appealing that spending a day doing nothing with someone who completes me.  How do you find this person you are supposed to spend the rest of your life with though?  Do you throw yourself into the dating scene and hope to get lucky?  Do you hang back and watch people, seeking out that perfect someone?   Hopelessness is something I don't deal with well.  I'm come to realize that after pondering what might happen if I don't find that special person, if I don't do something I feel is worthwhile with my life.  Tomorrow isn't guaranteed and you have to put yourself out there sometimes to make changes that will get your life going in the direction you want.  It's time to start searching and acting on interests rather than letting them pass me by and saying "there's always tomorrow".

      I can't believe how expensive some of these cars are.  More and more it seems like you pay for name recognition rather than actual performance or features.  I need to narrow my search down to something with great mileage, I'm tired of paying $20+ a week to fill up my truck.  I also want something with a manual transmission.  I miss the fun of shifting from back in high school with the little red mazda pickup.  No clue how long the search will continue, will touch on the subject again when I have the field narrowed down to only a few vehicles.

      So much has been going on in my life lately that I don't even feel like the same person I was three months ago.  In the middle of May I started having a weird pain/feeling in the left side of my chest.  To be safe, rather than sorry I went to the emergency room and had some tests done (E.K.G., Chest X-Ray, Blood Tests, etc.) and was discharged with a diagnosis of possible pulled/strained muscle in my chest.   Even though the doctor cleared me, I started to really really think about what could have happened if something had been seriously wrong.  I think most of us walk around with an air of invincibility throughout our youth and adolescence.  Sure we may break a bone, or catch a really bad cold, but no one really considers how fragile life really is.  I started thinking about death and what it means to me.  What will happen when I go and whether I have any regrets.  There are so many things I haven't done in my life that I need to do still.  With the thought that I could go any moment constantly in the back of my mind, I quickly became a different person.  I no longer had the sense of peace I once knew.  I now feel like I always have to be doing something, anything.  I used to be a loner, I was completely comfortable being with myself...now I hate it.  I need someone around or I feel like I'm not trying hard enough at life.   The changes haven't been all bad.  I'm more outgoing than I've ever been before in my life.  I'm more active which is always better for your health.  I do wish I could balance the old me and the new me more though.  I want that peace of mind back where I can enjoy a day of doing nothing without feeling like I'm wasting my life.  The once deep ocean of my mind has been replaced by a clock that is constantly ticking down to zero and I want it out of my head.  I seek peace of mind now so that I can be whole, rather than what I am now.  I feel as if I am chasing something just out of reach most of the time.  Hopefully I can discover something, or someone that will bring that peace of mind back to me.
