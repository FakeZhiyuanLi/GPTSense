      To make a LONG story short..Kat got her belongin's and yes it was as awkward as one would of exspected. I was so certain of myself and that I was makign the right decision by telling her it was all over between her and I after the past week's display and month's that it followed. But everyone know's when your heart and emaotions are involved..it is never an easy choice. What happened after she collected her belonging's in what surprised me most.  Kat claim's she get's it( finally) How she has been makign me feel for the past 5 month's and was being too pig headed to listen to when I told her how I was feeling. It's all good when said and I want to believe her very much so when she say's "i'm sorry" and "I didn't realize I was hurting you" as it been what I've been hoping to hear from here all this time. And I'll trust she mean's what she told me, but in all reality..I believe what I see..thenwhat one's "say's" especially, in this case. I hope in this account. I am proven painfully wrong . So I will see where this new found revealation's will take me, her, us...further into this realationship, or will we both have to face this delemia over and over&nbsp;until one of us say's Ok this is enough.!!! I did that for almost 5 year's with Anthony, and I never won in that realationship either, I don't have the energie's or patience to try that route again with anyone.

      I figured everyone will be or asked why me and Kat are not togther...so if I am goign to make it public knowledge I figure the Ims are also honest and true..the preceptions of the reader is not my fault. I do not want to mis quote her....and lead the listeners intruptation. I have my opinions of Kat...many you maybe apprent of( by reading the last im posting's)  but in all honest, when you love someone , espcially someone who is so caustic  it is not easy and naturally emotions are trampled on. There is never anyone solely responsible for a single situtation..all parties prepetuate and play their parts in it..and all must take responsibility for it. Is this postign a good idea..probably not. Is me cussing her out what I really should of done..certainly not. But I am human and I can only take so much before I break and say...ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!

      Well, I thought I'd do somethign interesting. I thought I'd post VERY insightful Ims and email's I have gotten over the past few month's from someone that was supposed to be special. Ok....Maybe it'll make you all look at me as some wekling..chance i'll take. I am more or less hoping it'll shed some insight into someone without flat out having to open my mouth repeatly . Call it slander( which you can not because these are actually unedited emails and Im the person sent themselves) As an example of set behaviours they present.        UPDATED: I deleted said item's due to fact I decided afterall it was and is a bad idea to make such sensative items so public for any moron to view.

      We call an expression ambiguous when it has one general meaning, and yet  contains certain words which may be taken in two different senses; or certain  clauses which can be so connected with other clauses as to divide the mind  between different views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression  equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with perfect  clearness and propriety, and also another thought with equal propriety and  clearness.    these two words have played a HUGE part in my life likely..espcially when in dealing with love one's/realationship's.

       I am who I am..and refuse to settle anymore to be with someone  who cant respect my feelings and use intelicentual reasonings for there lack of  of the responsibilities of a relationship , your actions keep telling me ,and  has said as much......this manor is only proof.    I've  always felt if some one exspresses their feelings and whether you agree or not    or (  decide if they are reading  more into it) than is there is the other persons resposibility to comunicate  .Feeling and emotions are real there is no right or wrong......... to  effectively comunicate how one feels is the owner of the feelings resposibility  .     I'm not looking to stay stuck in limbo while someone figures  out what theyre doing. I have alot of love to give and if someone can't  appericate that and accept me as a whole as much as they want the same from  me..to deny me such is self centered and immature.

        This bed is wide empty earth,    a landscape devoid of intimacy.      Are you leaving me?    I've been expecting it      Are you leaving??      I know it from the signs in the way    people charge through the streets, deranged    by heat, the narrowness of the road,    and the thirst for consolation.     Your sleep is transparent    and deep without feeling.    Outside, faces belie a preoccupation    with death.    Hurried,    Magnetized,    they drag the pavement into their life's.    Your sleeping hand avoids mine.    You're already planning your Good -Bye.       All Poetry is Copywritted by GoddessDeja. Please do not reproduce without prior consent. Thank you.

      Went to Ann Arbor Yesterday, too apply once more to subsized housing so I can move to Ann Arbor affordably. I was accepted onto the list, thankfully. But the list is probably 3 years long or more wait. I am going to start indivually apply to 236 code apartment complexs down in that area. I steamed cleaned the to carpet's today and detrimned to bust my ass to get the wallpaper chores here conpleted, wall's primed, and painted.....then I can work on doing inprovements to the porch and front bedrood/bathroom area..all of which will increase the ability to sell my home at a better price/and or faster( crosses finger's) I just wish it was all over with already, the waiting, the not knowing is frustrating. I am tired of just exsisting..I need to start creating a life, a future for me and my kid's..None of which of that seem's to be happenign here..which moving  here was supposed to be the sole purpose. It didn't happen. Ann Arbor over all will help serve many function's for self indendence. The access to the mass public transit system, the amenditie's available, the doctor's , program's etc. Almost sound's as if I'm trying to convience myself it's worth moving. It is, it is just hard to mentally change my mind to owning, though just a moblie home..to renting.  It will do me some good. And I am hoping mostly it will do my children some good also.   On thr Kat front, we have been" talking" not because Kat was too , how do i put it? encouraged? anyways....to talk to me about what transpired, but I persisted. If anything I needed to talk about it. I learned a few thing's about myself...not much more I'll admit about her. Kat confuse's me that is for sure. Not all confusion is a bad thing..least it is making me learn some realitie's about myself, that I've blinded myself to over the year's.  We  get so set in our "ways" and get blind to the surrounding's , including people we take for granted in them ...I am learning I am no acception to this injustice. Kat is still"stand offish" towards me and whats has transpired between us, I am also......I just seem to process thing's to a resolution faster then she does apparently. It will help  me( if I allow it to) learn patience with other's.

       Piece of a poem I wrote..seem's very fitting    You promised me, well not  exactly..... You mislead me, yes exactly..... I asked you not to, and you  laughed, made a joke...and acted as if my worries were only silly worries...  Thoughts that existed only in my world... I trusted so fully, that i thought  my ears were playing tricks on me.... Did you know I did not sleep last  night? I threw a slumber party.. and invited sorrow, betrayl, confusion, and  a very small version of myself   I am sick I  am lost I am small I am ugly I am pathetic i am a wreck I am  worthless I am broken I am garbage I am a liar I am a failure I  am pointless I am dying I am losing I am longing I am  trapped ..................... and you make me feel like a slut...

       I have dreamed my whole life of finding or creating a safe heaven, a home for myself, and now my children. I have vaguely been shown love in life, let alone ever respect. I honestly can say that. I speak of Monika and how much she cared for me. But fact remains she left and choose to leave with a feeling of guilt placed onto me by her. That's not love. I spent my entire life being other's stepping stone and emotional dumping ground and because I was related to them it is supposed to be tolerated? To me that is not love. I emotionally invested myself into people who doesn't have the slightest clue what love is about let alone to posses it. For all these reason's I blame myself.  Apparently, I am incapable of obtaining my dream..It is exactly that a fantasy. I discarded my biological mother/father, and one sibling due to toxic circumstance's I was forced to endure  why should someone I allowed into my relam be any differnt? Why, allow someone to the very core of my soul and knowingly let them trample it?    Sitting around here yesterday crying and feeling utterly miserable. I was having a major pity party. Then I read these words someone else said to me : I know how much it sucks when you feel betrayed by your inner self.Reading those words, it was as if something just clicked for me. It was not that I was    broken   . It was that my mind had    betrayed    me.   I know the difference between the two  seems subtle and perhaps meaningless, but for me it was the difference between  passivity and action. Suddenly I wasn't bereft. I was freaking angry at myself.  How dare it fail muself? Keara Lynai McCardle YOU are NOT broken. My stupid  heart betrayed me like Judas! And I am pissed as hell, but I am not    broken!     Somehow this anger has to get me better  .       Again, I know that it might seem like the same thing is being  said, but to me it is different. It is a compartmentalization of the offending  part, rather than an indictment of me as a whole. . If this needs to be thought  of as an adversarial situation, than so be it. Because until I am one with me  and have people in life who feel the same, my emotions are against me and my  goal is to get them aligned toward a goal of creating peace for myself once  again.   To allow myself to accept I do deserve more then I've  allowed. That *I* am worth

      It began with a simple drive to the store. But, before long, I began to start displaying body language  saying/screaming " I am upset" long before I myself knew I was.I slowly built up resentment through the day towards Kat and convienced myself my mood was Kat's fault. I thought, ever patient and peaceful, took all Kat had to dish out silently. In all actuallity I was creating the problem..or perpetuating the problem into what transpired last night in the wee hours of the mornign and into today.  We were hardly speaking by the time they arrived to that conversation. And then something strange happened. Mid point an epthnay hit me..wow..is this me speaking this way? Why this is NOT at all how I feel about Kat whatsoever, why am I allowed her reactions push me into saying the things I had?? There's no excuse for any of it. I am ashamed of myself!!!  Kat watched me earlier through the day get in and out of her truck in a huff and walked away.Everytime, feeling rejected or at fault, then angry and I was unaware I was even doing it..til now..when it's too late.  She just sat there, watching me. And she felt nothing, or so I thought.She  had no urge to run after me, why should she? She didn’t care whether she ever saw me again or not.  Two weeks ago after an arguement,afterwards Kat broke into tears.Her apathy that day shocked me, Only then did I realise that what I knew I felt towards her, she actually felt for me also.  When a friend suggested to me I may have been angry with her, I heatly protested. “But I love her. How can I be angry with her?”  Boy, I had forgoten what love was . And little did I understand my anger.

      Willed ignorance, I think, is mere philistinism - better than invented knowledge, which is Orwellian self-delusion from the start.I cannot disagree with Kat more. I think our history is concrete in facts. It is the intrepretation and meanings that get us into trouble. I do not feel that we should delete or add materials to create one preception. Life is composed of multipule levels and preceptions. There always one story but various interpations of that one story or "preception's " as we call it. One version is never more correct..But I also feel that the basic core principle's and compassion either it is there or it is not. Let's stop diluting our wonderful history. Which is why I felt if I was going to discuss these issue's..for myself revelations or emotional venting ..which IS supposed to be the concept behind a journal. If I can not be honest with myself here..where can I?   I find Kat mentally and emotionally exhuasting. Why? For many reasons..not all are bad..though they might appear to be. Kat is very intelligent, which is what drew me to her, but in the same instance..it is used as a weapon in many cases against me...as if she is mocking me( and others) for being beneath her...for not being up to her "standards" Kat isn't even up to her own "standards". And admittly..I am not up to my own standards either..so I have no room to speak. Why else do I find Kat so draining? well..it is best described as a roller coaster ride on acid. Ok bad anology, but it fits. one day is tolerable, next day is awesome, the following day, we hit a turn, or curve or whatever..and down the hill we go, around the bend into a tunnel, all giving me whiplash and knocking me senseless in the process. My vision is blurred. I've made referrences to the Yo-Yo efect in here before. there seems to be too many "grays" in areas I need more clarity and too many set defined black or whites within the realationship, where I needed more gray shades or sepia (sp?) WHat Ive realised is that I am unable to figure how to reach Kat, how to learn to adjust to her way of how she processes stuff and projects them towards me directly. The way she chooses to word or present things to me feel abusive or belittling to me. To sit and question myself, as whole because I've allowed a single indivual inturpetation's of me affect me so negatively so wrong on my part. I should of never allowed it to continue, but instead I did myself, Kat, and my children a great injustice by trying to stick it out, hash it out, and hope one day she'd hear me, and love me enough to quit. She won't..Kat is who she is....she will continue to remain that way..long after me. I just have to accept that fact and it has nothing to do with me whatsoever and quit making it so personal though I felt so personally directed.

Me : yes Kat : you really are nuts Kat : that or deaf Me : the day we got in our last huge fight Kat : 2 weeks ago? Me : yes Kat : you are nuts - this conversation really is over this time - I can stand you making up stories to tell other people to shield them from knowing all the intimate details of their lives.  I can even stomach it when you re-fabricate the truth to suit your needs when discussing things about your family life.  But if you really want to tell me that line of crap, and then expect me to believe it, you really have a loose wire somewhere Kat : I've been telling you I love you for a lot more than 2 weeks and I have the yahoo messenger logs to prove it among other things Me : ok mayebe I got a few ..Im talkign face to face...in your arms, reality, not the internet... Kat : that too Kat : unfortunately I didn't log those - sorry Kat : I didn't know it would be a matter for case law Kat : oh lookie here - my logs go back past may for some reason with you Kat : and there are I love you's in multiple places in just the first conversation I pulled up Me : well..I started to save our convos for savign grace...only because you merely tend to turn thinsg around on me..say things..then say you do not..and if I try otherwise to make you realize that you did or do..you would debate it..and I didnt want to debate it..just know whatever it was that was brought up was in fact what happened..and not you once again telling me..your full of crap Kat : then I suggest you search them - and I said it in person before I ever said it on here Kat : but of course, I didn't mean it - that's what you will believe - regardless what I say - you always do Kat : so go ahead Kat : slander my name to all my friends if it makes you feel better Kat : out me to my family if you feel it advances your cause in any way shape or form Me : i dont know..Ive asked you several times lately if you loved me..sincerely..and you laughed it off..thought I was silly Kat : post all my conversations to your precious blog so all 20 of your loyal readers (probably mostly people who want to fuck you anyway) can read it Kat : when? Me : and i will state again..I never threatend to out you to your family..nor do i intedn to..I do not need to Kat : I don't remember you asking me 'sincerely' once Kat : I can go back to this very conversation Me : only purpose it will serve is yet another excuse for you to blame me for everything Me : I am not giving you that amino Kat : give me a fucking break Me : i asked you yesterday by the sick layign in your arms Kat : I was starting to type it in jest, and you beat me to it for god's sake Kat : all this because I went home Kat : grow up Me : your responses..(laugher) bumps me...of course silly ...then along the lines of a question...why you askign me such a (not sure if stuipid was used or not) liek that? Kat : I hope you do post some of these conversations - then perhaps your precious blog readers will see just how much shit I have had to put up with and just how nutso you can really get sometimes Me : again I asked you sitting in your lap in the pink reclined..if you loved me..and you chuckled that off too Kat : but of course, those that still want to just fuck you will take your side no doubt Kat : goddessinmich (1:13:52 AM): Im goign to post every damn convo weve ever had..and then well lete evryone else decide in your own exact words why I have issues with you Kat : threat #1 Kat : goddessinmich (1:14:20 AM): maybe Ill fowrd a nice copy to your family..Im sure theyd be interested in knowing how they raised their son to talk to people Kat : threat #2 Kat : shall I keep going? Me : go for it Me : and im curious how does that last comment from me..have realvance in me "outting" you? Kat : and my answer was 'of course, why ask a silly question like that?' Me : that says nothign of the sort of me tellign them about your alter life they know nothign about Kat : that's not chuckling anything off - that is giving a response and then asking why you would inquire in the first place Kat : that is called 'conversation' - something you seem foreign to when it comes to me Kat : lol - well seeing as how my nickname is 'k-lynn' and most of our conversations revolve around transgendered issues - how is that 'NOT' outting me? Me : because I dont/didnt feel liek you did..I wanted to know if you did or not..and then figure out why I was feeling the way I was by your actions towards me Me : hello..raised their son....I never menstioned of outtign you as Kathy to them..nor would I ..no matter how angry id ever be with you Kat : and I told you over and over again a long time ago - and even recently - that I do NOT say "I Love You"  to someone unless I mean it.  As you recall, that was a big bone of contention you had with me when we first started going out. Kat : because I would 'not' say it Kat : now that I do, it's not believable enough for you Kat : dear god woman - what do you want? Me : but you stated earlier of this convo you said it to me..now you saying you wouldnt..which is what I stated earlier??? Kat : posting every damn convo we had - then you say 'forward a nice copy to my family' - I do think that every convo we ever had would be more than enough for my college educated parents to figure out that my being transgendered has something to do with those conversations Kat : get real Kat : and frankly, even though I am sure my mother would have her typical load of crap to say about the transgendered part, I don't really think they would be astonished by my reactions to your comments Me : I go by actions and how someone treats me and make me feel..if I feel loved..obviously I wont need to question it..now your tellign me that doesn't sound reasonable?? Kat : they would be more astonished that I put up with them for as long as I did Kat : because I love you Kat : like when I go to stiletto's because you want to go? Me : I find that amzing..I truly do Kat : then you bad mouth me to some stranger on the internet as thanks? Me : I didnt bad mouth you Kat : ' Kat : ok Kat : how is "she was doing great at holding up the wall" a compliment? Kat : I'll never be enough for you Kat : that was the other reason I went home Kat : that is the reason I went home tonight instead of tomorrow Kat : I don't know how to be what you want Kat : and I don't know how to get you to tell me - in detail - in terms I can understand Me : i do tell  you..its jst isnt apparently in terms you understand Kat : you say you have told me - but obviously I haven't heard whatever you are saying - you bring up very few concrete examples of what specifically you have told me so I can nail it down Kat : so I sit here scratching my head Kat : what have you told me? Kat : "I was afraid everything I was doing was pissing you off" Kat : and I told you I had the exact same feeling all day Kat : then you walked away Kat : back to your room to talk with strangers on the internet in far more detail than you will afford me Kat : I know, because I looked Kat : I was hoping to find some hint of something that would let me know what the hell was going on Me : no..I said then if thats the case..what more there to say? you offered no resolvution or imput..you got piiser which prepetuates me feelign liek I had...which solves..what? Kat : why I was sitting alone in the bedroom AGAIN Kat : I told you I wasn't getting pissed Me : hey, I was layign down with my son to get him to go to sleep..guess what I have duties to tend to Kat : what more can I say than that? Me : that doesnt revolve aroudn you Kat : I waited for 2 hours Kat : how long did I have to wait?  what would have been satisfactory? Me : and I feel alseep..( after you knew Ive been tired, in pain, and have a migrain and needed to sleep) so instead Kat : so I left Me : kat brews, and stews Kat : like I said I was going to Kat : and you get pissed Me : gets herself worked up Kat : you said you were sick Kat : you were asleep Me : because I feel alseep Kat : I didn't want to wake you up Me : whats wrong with wakign me up to brine me in the bedroom Kat : I told you I was going to leave tonight!~!!!! Me : or kiss me good bye Me : or a note maybe?? Kat : YOU WERE SICK Kat : YOU TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T FEELING GOOD Kat : WHY WOULD I WAKE YOU UP ON PURPOSE?!?!?1 Kat : I gave you the benefit of the doubt Me : you say good bye maybe..isnt that curstious?? Kat : but I didn't wan to sleep alone when there was a chance it was in fact something else Me : ok..so i cant spell that word Kat : when I saw proof in your logs that you were telling other people that I was making you upset Kat : and you were giving me glib responses when I asked multiple times "what is wrong?" - and when the one time you did answer, I responded and you walked away Kat : so faced two options Me : you didnt start to make me upset until I came out of almart and you said I had a problem..which I did not..then you continued all day..that I had a problem..which I didnt but everythign you stated I did..I started to..til I did Kat : sitting there all night - staring at the ceiling wondering if you were sleeping in the front room because something was bothering you and you wanted to make me suffer for it as a result Me : walmart Me : how is that makign you siffer? please explain? Kat : or to go home like I already said I was going to, avoid creating any more trouble, and let you sleep if in fact you were telling the truth and you were simply feeling ill Me : suffer Kat : in the latter case I could actually get some shit done - wow, that worked out great Kat : here it is 3 hours later, and all I have gotten done is and endless circular arguement where you still keep bringing me back to the same things Kat : I JUST WENT HOME Me : well, when i called as soon as you pulled out..and you where nasty to me set me off..and yes i havent been nice..and yes now i have a rpoblem Me : problem Kat : you slammed your car door when you got in as we left.  You slammed your car door when you got out at the bank machine.  You gave me the silent treatment all the way to walmart.  When I tried to grab your hand, you pulled your hand back.  Then you slammed your door a litter harder yet as you got out at walmart and spent close to 45 minutes in there when you initially told me you were only going to get 'groceries' for breakfast Kat : why would I think anything was wrong? Kat : gee, I dunno! Kat : beat the piss out of my car and don't talk to me all the way to the store?  nah, nothing's wrong there Kat : so I asked Kat : did you answer?  "nothings wrong" Kat : Me : your looking for crap...i wasnt mad or had an issue at bank, before that, wlmat..did on the way hoem breifly from your comment..but got over that...and i didnt have an issues all day til about oh..lets see..say about 5ish Me : i told you what was wrong..im tired Me : my figure really hurts Me : head ache Me : etc Kat : I've just been noticing all week Me : you wanted to assumed i was pissed or it had to be soemthign more Me : which made it into soemthign more Kat : if I am working on the computer or doing something else around the house when you want to do something, I catch hell Kat : you spend time working on the computer when I want to do something, and I am being unreasonable Me : Ok..realistically here..Ill address that Kat : the other day you were working on the computer, I wanted a simple kiss - you nearly told me to get fucked Kat : if I did that, I would be forced to suffer in one manner of fashion or another for the next three days Me : i did no such thing Kat : you moping around saying "nothing is wrong - nothing is wrong" Kat : ugh Kat : you so did Kat : eghad woman Kat : don't tell me what I did not experience myself Kat : you sound like an orwellian delusion now Kat : didn't say I love you until july 26th?  warped reality!  Now I didn't get rebuffed when you were on the computer Kat : as I said over and over Kat : think what you will - you obviously have your own grasp on what constitutes reality Kat : I am taking a shower Kat : this is rediculous Kat : it's like that scene from 28 days - doing the same thing over and over expecting a different resuilt Kat : this is more nuts than going into a yahoo chat room expecting to find someone of quality to date - oh wait, I met you in a yahoo chat room - nevermind Me : exactly...not doign it anymore..just facing reality Kat : and yes, that was a fucking put down - you are seriously doinked in the head - I really believe that now - I'll have someone pick up my bike for me - you are a nut case - get fucking help.  at least I admit where my life is screwed up and I am trying to fix it - you alter reality to suit your own need to hide from it Me : this comes from someone who cant maintain a realationship for more thenhow many months is your record Kat? when did you date last? Oh wait..I guess sucking a tgirls cock doesnt equate as not into guys either theory Me : correct youself..I am NOT on welfare Me : its called SSI Me : if your going to state it..make it correct Me : its called social security disability income support Me : and your own unemployemnt for how many years now?

Me : you get more a month off unemployemnt then I get to feed and tend for 3 and I have more then you do ..hmm..go figure Kat 's status is now "NO MORE PSYCHO WELFARE MOMS!!!!".
