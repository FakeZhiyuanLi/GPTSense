      good times last night. our group attended karaoke. I planned on signing 'bad timing' by blue rodeo but they never called my name. but gosh darn was it ever a good time. beers (and when i say beers i of course mean good ole 1892 beers) were 2 for $5, quite the steal. photos taken will no doubt be incriminating.   after the pub we had a snowball fight. i was snowbanked more times than i care to remember. my whole right side is aching. tomorrow we go home. hard to believe we have been here a week already. we are just starting to get into the swing of things. just starting to build friendships and now they are going to end.  as usual, such is life.

      Okay, so maybe I should be a bit more clear. I am at the Canadian University Press conference in St. John's, New Foundland. You see, I am the Managing Editor of a college newspaper and I am out here representing.   Okay, let me now be even a bit more honest. I haven't been representing so much as drooling over two really hot boys. Both, of course, whom have no idea who I am or why I am. But still, good times.  There is a blizzard here. For real. No planes in or out for the next two days. I have to get out of here back to my real life. I have to go to L.A. next week and my plane leaves from Vancouver, not New Foundland.  I love you all, which really means just me as I have a zero readership at this point.

      I am in New Foundland. I am desperately trying to have fun and enjoy the experience. Desperately. It is taking my all but that ain't much.   anyhow, more later

      The absolute worst time to post is when you are intoxicated. Do you ever listen to people talk about how bad their relationships are and you think...if only I could get someone to treat me like shit.  Okay, maybe that's just me. Maybe I really and truly should be medicated. I wish I could tell you everything that happened in the last week but we aren't that close yet. I honestly do hope that we reach that level because it sure is lonely keeping all this insanity to myself.  Until then I guess....

      Tell me July is over.  This has been one long, painful month. One hiccup after the other. It's been a lonely month too. Good thing I have you now dear reader. I surely missed having such a captive audience. But you never write, you never call.     Sometimes I need more from you. Sometimes I would like to hear what you think. Unless you disagree with anything I say. In that case, I think it's best you stay silent.  I have to go.

      So, it's been awhile. What can I say...I've been busy. You know, school...work, blah blah blah.  I have been writing letters to people and then regreting it. There is something to be said about writing a letter. You feel something, you write it down, you deliver it, and then immediately regret it. The worst part about giving someone a letter is not getting any answers back. I wrote a line I was quite proud of in the last letter I gave to someone. It went something like this:  "I'm going to walk away and cross my fingers hoping that you will have a change of heart before I forget how good the idea of us could be"  No response. Nothing. Those words were gold to me...to the other person, not so much. I even taped the letter to the front door of the recipient of the letter because I thought how romantic it would be if I came home and there was a like letter taped to my door. I use the word like because love...I mean what do any of us really know about love?  So, today I must sleep so I can function for real at work tomorrow. But I will leave you with a quote I recently heard.  "I feel sorry for people who don't drink. They get up in the morning and that's the best they are going to feel all day"  Until next time.

      So tomorrow I am going to  urlLink Whistler . I am trying really hard to be excited. I am going with a girlfriend and I wish I was going with a love interest. I am in the mood to be romantic. I am NOT in the mood to get drunk and go to a bar. Man, this sucks.  I got older but for some reason some of my friends didn't. NOW, I understand how my friend used to feel. She wanted to sit in a lounge downtown, have drinks...and GASP have meaningful conversations. I just want to club, club, club. Now I am longing to sit in a lounge. I have traded in all my clubbing gear for downtown lounge chic wear. I am READY!  I mean sure I still like to shake my tail feather. Sometimes get really drunk and just go to a local club but really, what I really long for...is my friend :( I sent her an "i love you and want you back" email...throw a penny in a well for me, would ya.  okay, it's raining and I have a massage appointment. I'll be back tonight.  Kisses

      so I thought long and hard about this and have come to a very sad conclusion. i have not had sober sex in a very long time. 2 1/2 years to be exact. the only time I have had sex lately is when I have called up an old lover after a few (many) glasses of wine. this may say something very strange about me. either i have issues with sex or drinking. either way, i'm quite the catch.  but seriously, i am pushing 30 here. when does the sexual peak kick in? i am ready to go the distance. if the distance is kissing and some light petting. one day, mark my words, when i am in love and being loved back...its going to be a sex freak show. again, if sex freak show means like, i may get on top or something.  so thats whats been on my mind. what about you?

      So I used to watch  urlLink Days of Our Lives  but I stopped quite some time ago. I had a friend who watches it, so from time to time I have caught up with it but really things never really change on soap operas do they?  Today I saw a commercial for Days and it showed a clip of Sami and Lucas getting married. At first I was shocked. I mean after everything they have been through....why? Then I thought for one, why do I care...and for two, and this is much worse...my life may be loosely based on a soap opera.  I have it all:   Many ex-lovers who make appearances when everyone is sure they must be dead by now.   A baby from a relationship that just narrowly escaped marriage.   Evil in-laws once removed.   Friends who sleep with my current and discarded lovers.   and elusive employment.    Hmmm kinda sad actually.

      The last day of the long weekend. I am sad to see my days of lazing around and watching movies end but I must say that when you are alone, a long weekend feels more like an eternity.  I feel like I have been off work for weeks. And I am also regretting that on Friday I didn't get very much work done so tomorrow will seem like two days in one. Plus, I have three finals this week and I am not even sure what is going on in the classes. I really let myself get lazy this summer.  But I have decided, that August is going to be my month. When I look back in time, as we seem to always do, I am going to say be able to say "Yes, August 2004, what a month is was." Maybe it will be filled with intrigue and good surprises. Unlikely I know, but a girl can dream.  I have travel plans for each weekend in August. So the work week will be bookended by little relaxing getaways.  urlLink Whistler ,  urlLink Kelowna ,  urlLink Seattle ,  urlLink Victoria ...It will be fantastic.  Plus my horrible haircut is starting to find a style of it's own. I have also decided to quit smoking. I am on about 2 hours so far and it is working out just fine. I am definately going to quit smoking or really pick up the habit and be a full-time smoker. I am one of those social smokers that you all love to hate. Or maybe not.  Now if I can somehow find a way to fit in romance and wealth, this will be a time to remember. Most definately.  Song you MUST download: Lady Stardust,  urlLink Lisa Miskovsky . You can thank me later.
