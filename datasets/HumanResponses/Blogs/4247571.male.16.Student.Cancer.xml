      Yoyo~! Haha.. Ok, lets talk about my day.. Today is my friend "bird" day, but in fact is yesterday lah only that he held his party today. Went to his house today for his "party" but in fact we just went there to eat then play sit down talk cock lah.. My friend and I bought a G-string for him this year to prank him but when we gave him the G-string, he know what's inside! Wonder which idiot told him sia! But our whole class laugh lik mad lah casue today got paper at school mah. The paper so stupid loh only last for about 45mins waste our bus fare going to school, why can't they put the paper together with another paper since that it only last for 45mins? then after his "party" we went to play bowling and meet another group of friends at the bowling there loh, well I just suck at playign bowling the ball just keep going into the "drain!" So is like throwing money in, but most important, we have fun lah and there's the most important thing. After that, we went for dinner at the food court near by and the food there suck! =X after that just went home together with one of my friend since that most of them don't live in pasir ris. But on our way home walking towards the bus stop, the friend who went home with me saw another group of "gangster" from 08, then he said that he don't want to walk pass them as they fight before then I was like never mind loh walk with him together but only walk to the other bus stop lah not very far tho. This is my day boring eh? I ask them to go chiong they don't want! so no choice but to go went and slack~!

So, I get to see her again however, I just keep feeling that something is not right and I don't know what is it! May be is just a feeling or....... never mind! Feeling very sad now and I also don't know why?! What the hell is wrong with me? I am feel like dying now just end my life and I won't feel so painful! Haiz.. But I guess that she don't know how much I love her! When will she know? Holy sh*t! Just want to die now! what's the fastest way to die without pain and looking good? Haiz..

My friend told me that have a house to house ice-cream selling job that is $10 per hour and thats very good pay, But end up, it's only $3 and if you sell a total of $140 and they will gv u 10% com and thats crap as you need to talk alot and phyco all the auntie to buy the stupid walls ice-cream from, i went there to have a look at other people selling that and whole block he only earn $20 -_-" and I wonder how they going to get the $130 min target? it's really a crappy job.. I think may be tml I will go to Genki sushi to interview for cook and let's just pray that they need cook if not I really have to look for other job = ( So confused today and I don't know what i am confused about! that's a big problem! Guess I miss her too much = ( been along time since I last saw her~! Everytime I see her, I feel lik hugging her and tell her that I want to be by her side not as a friend but as her boyfriend however, everytime when I plan to tell her that, she's not free to go out with me.. But... should I give up on her? this is what I am thinking about everytime! Haiz.. I don't know what to do! Can anyone teach me what to do?! ="(
