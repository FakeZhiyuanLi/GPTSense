      Happy Turkey Day, boys and girls!    There's nothing like heading home for a holiday in anticipation of being reminded about how dysfunctional your family really is.  Don't get me wrong, now, I absolutely love my family (and the fact that we are dysfunctional is actually quite comforting bc I fit in so well)  In any case, I'd like to share with you all this evening the top five family stories (cliff's notes versions, of course) about my family.  As a sidenote, I often refer to my mother and father as Sue and Larry, so keep that in mind as you read on to avoid confusion!  Number 5, The tailgating and chugging of Smirnoff story in which Sue and Larry so affectionately offer to buy beer for us in fear that we won't have enough.  Direct quote from Sue, "What number is that, Al?"  Al: "It's only 3 mom"  Sue: "Well, you better get to work, kid, you have to have at least 5 or 6 more before you hit the stadium."  In "chimes" (get it?) Larry: "You need anything kids?  Beer, money for beer, anything at all?"  Imagine the blank stares of the LSU tailgaters at first interaction with the parents of yours truly  Number 4, The my dad will wear the ugliest shirts ever sewn together as long as they have pockets and this saved him from being stranded on the interstate story.  As stated above, the man has to have a pocket on his shirt.  If there is no pocket, he will bluntly tell you that you have wasted your time and money and he is unhappy with your selection.  No matter how ugly the shirt is, if it has a pocket, Larry will love it.  He gets stranded on the interstate one day (a car he was working on broke down) and a friend of his saw him and stopped to offer him a lift.  Says the friend to Larry, "I looked up as I passed you and I thought to myself, that has to be Larry, because nobody else in the world would wear a shirt that is that ugly."    Number 3, The my niece is just as outspoken as her mother and her aunt put together and this got us into an interesting situation at a Chinese restaurant story.  Here we are at China Jade enjoying dinner, when our waitress (who, by the way, has an extremely short haircut) walks up to ask if we need anything else.  My niece, Emily, chooses to ask her, "Are you a boy or a girl?"  For those who have met the mother of Emily, my beloved sister, Christine, you understand where she gets her big mouth from I am sure.  Number 2, The my other sister has no common sense and asks a very very stupid question on the day of my 21st bday about my new and still healing tattoo story.  This requires very little more than her question, "Why did you get a frog that has blood on it tattooed to your back?"  WOW....  Number 1, The my mom was never really much of an English person and this proves it story.  This occurred at the time when Lord of the Rings was first in the movie theatres.  Sue: "I'd like to see that new movie, isn't it about those boys who get stranded in the woods and that one kid can make a fire with his glasses?"  Al (banging head against the wall): "No, mom, that was Lord of the Flies"  Well, there it is...5 of the many many I could share...so how about some comments?  Post one of your stories about your own families, or for those who have spent some time with my family (I apologize) let us know your story about that experience!  Have a great holiday weekend!

      OK then, let's talk about the penis...  Well, it's not what you expected to see as the opening line of this post, much as it was not what I expected to hear as a transition into tale number three of Delany's "Tales of Neveryon" (a book that I am "reading" for an English class).  Nonetheless, I had to suffer through it, and as they say...misery loves company.  Ahh, the infamous "they" always causing trouble...have you ever imagined a world without "they" or "them" who would we blame things on?  "Oh, well they told me to do it that way"  Who would we use as a scapegoat when we didn't know the answers?  "Well, they should have that info for you very soon"  It would be a different world, indeed.  Now, back to English class (try to follow the bouncing ball)....this teacher of mine is a crackhead.  He characterizes himself with these funny looking hats and always relates whatever we read back to sex, orgasms, or male anatomy.  You should see my notebook.  So, in keeping with the traditions of this Tues/Thurs class, we will now have a Freedman Quote of the Week...today's is (drumroll please) "This guy was a renowned writer, so renowned, he got more pussy than Frank Sinatra"  Yes, that is right, he actually said that in class and I actually wrote it in my notes...LSU is indeed a fine institution of higher learning.  Today, we were even entitled to a little joke...transition into the joke from Freedman was..."Oh, I'd like to share my favorite sex change joke with you all."  (Apparently, he has many from which to choose.)  So it goes: Person asking about sex change:  Did it hurt when they cut off your penis? Person who underwent sex change: Not at all. Person asking about sex change:  Did it hurt to have to grow breasts? Person who underwent sex change: Not at all. Person asking about sex change:  Did anything hurt? Person who underwent sex change:  Well, just one thing... Person asking about sex change:  Well, what's that? Person who underwent sex change:  It hurt when they cut my salary in half.    As a "mild" feminist, I can see the humor and hear the truth of past inevitable discrimination, but I can also see the ignorance in making a joke like this one that undermines the value and capability of women.  Leads me to a little saying I like...For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.  Any one want to make a comment on that one?  Feel free.  Moving on, I just came from my Best Buy training, where I got to watch some team building videos and take a tour of the store I now call home.  It was all very fascinating, a lot to learn, but looks fun nonetheless.  I saw Dan the man from CKI leaving as I was coming in, apparently he too is jumping on the BB Bandwagon...I am such the trendsetter (shut up Adam, it doesn't matter that you worked there first)  :)  Well, that about does it for me and my randomness for the day.  If you made it to the end, congratulations!  You probably will be rewarded with a headache for your efforts!  Leave me some comments (props to Bobby for helping me set that up and to Kevin for sending a comment to prove that it works!)    Til next time, remember that Reese's may be ok, but if you are what you eat, should I be concerned that my roommate is obsessed with Trix?

      I've never really been a sucker for peer pressure, but I guess that since everyone else had a blog, it was only a matter of time before I got one too (besides, I was running out of jokes about them, so if you can't beat 'em...join 'em, huh?)  So it's Monday of Thanksgiving week...it hasn't really occurred to me just yet that Thanksgiving really is this week.  That's what you get for burning yourself out with other things I suppose.  But, as the end of the semester approaches, so does the fun!  I got a holiday job at the Best Buy in BR...I'll be working with one of the funniest guys around, Mr. Adam Wilson (did you know that I know two AW's?  small world)  I'm looking forward to training tomorrow for this little gig and seeing how it all works out.  Anyway, in case you haven't noticed, I tend to be a talker and I like to ramble...so there's never any telling what you may end up reading on these pages.  I tend to be pretty honest about things as well, so there's your heads-up gang!  I'm sure that a lot of what will be here will pertain to CKI as most of the readers will be CKI'ers, so should you find your name here, remember that I only bitch about those that I love, and I only yell at those I love very very dearly!  Let the good times roll....

      Wow, I am a slacker!!  Time for some catch-up.  Seems that everyone had a great time last Friday night, other than the vomit and the fact that Bobby refuses to accept that he is now my understudy, that is.  All in good fun, I am glad so many of us got together, I would say we should do it more often, but some of you are organ donors, so your liver shouldn't be so abused.  The Saints game Sunday was also incredibly fun, I loved the Explorer cramming, and since I drive an Explorer myself, I now know the limits!!  This week LSU had a blood drive and jambalaya sale outside of Best Buy...here's a little hint for everyone, if you decide to stop going to work and then go to former place of employment to collect blood and sell jambalaya, be sure that you have a secure hiding spot for when your old boss comes out to give blood...thanks to everyone who came out to help, it was very successful and we had a good time...but only here in Louisiana could you have a Decemeber blood drive and go home with a sunburn.  And the line dancing to Footloose was pretty fun, I think that we drew a little attention to ourselves with that one.  Funny story about the Blood Drive, there were two Kiwanians there and they had a glass of champagne, they offered me some, and (here's the funny part) I said no because I was at an official CKI event and was not allowed to consume alcohol.  Have you ever heard of such a thing?  Well that about takes everything up to speed, quit the job, collected blood, turned down alcohol, oh and I spent some time with my family last weekend as well.  Here's the Sue and Larry story of the week: Driving in the car with Sue and Larry (aka mom and dad) and Larry says the word "retarded" Sue:  Don't say that around Emily (4 year old niece) Larry: Why not, she's gonna learn it anyway...I mean, you did, didn't you? I love that guy!  Happy Holidays everyone!

      So it's Wednesday which means it's almost Friday!!  For those who don't know, we are going out on Friday night.  The plan is to meet at the Boot uptown on Broadway for 7pm and then head to Vera Cruz on Maple for 8pm and then barhop.  Gimme a ring or send me a line if you wanna join the fun!  After all, what good is sitting alone in your room?  Come hear the music play....Life is a cabaret, old chum...come to the cabaret!   I love Broadway...enjoy the rest of the week!

      Well, day one of finals is over for me, and I get a little break until the next one.  It's going to be a busy week with one of my best friends from high school getting married on Sat in New Orleans.  Since I am standing in her wedding, I have to drive home Thursday for the rehearsal (picking my dress up on the way) and then drive back to LSU Friday to take a final, then back home Friday afternoon to party and then the wedding is Sat night.  That makes me tired just thinking about it!  She did have one hell of a bachelorette party last weekend, though.  We rode out to Bourbon in an Excursion limo...seriously pimping with lava lamps and strobe lights and all kinds of other neat shit that amaze you when you are drunk.  We met some fun guys who were from New Zealand and Australlia (I am such a sucker for an accent)  And, it was my first time at Pat O's and I loved it!    I am getting excited about my winter travels in January to Denver and then Michigan, and I am starting to not like my job at Best Buy quite as much as I thought I would.  Let's recap the events of Best Buy so far....I had a man tell me I didn't know anything about video games because I am a girl, I had my car broken into, I had to take out the garbage (yes, this is a serious problem for me), oh yeah, and there's that whole thing with the place being REALLY LOUD ALL THE TIME!  But, I'm trying to stick it out a little more to get some extra cash for my trips.  Well, since I know this is officially the most boring thing I have ever written, I think I will stop now.  Oh, update on Friday....it's looking like we will be swinging uptown after dinner.  Start thinking about what clubs you'd like to hit and start spreading the word...we're getting close now!  Can't wait to see you all then!

      Random thought: If assholes could fly, this place would be an airport.  Happy Sunday everyone and welcome to finals week, otherwise known as the week from hell.  So as not to dwell on the negative, let's get an update about next Friday night's plans.  The current rankings of our destination are as follows:  37 % for Screw this bullshit, let`s just get shitfaced!! 18 % for Dinner, then Bourbon Street 18 % for Dinner, then Rock `n Bowl on Carrolton to see the Molly Ringwald`s and drink, dance, etc 12 % for Dinner, then Rock `n Bowl, then Uptown 12 % for Dinner, then the Uptown scene (ie, Waldo`s, the Boot, etc)  So the way it's looking is we are either going to Bourbon or we are going to see a band.  If you haven't yet voted, you must do so before Tuesday so we can finalize the plans.  The poll will be cut off at 8pm.   When that poll is over, we will have a new one to decide our dinner destination.  Requests have included Houstons and Bravo on St. Charles.  You are all welcome to make a request and it will be included on the poll.  This will be decided by Wed at 8pm.  Don't you just love democracy?    And finally, who the hell is planning to go to this little event?  If you are definitely in, let me know so I can start to get an idea about how many of you I will have to deal with (ie, how much I will have to drink)  Just kidding, I love you all and hope that you can make it to party with me!!!!  Good luck with getting through the week and I'll be in touch about our adventures!

      Freedman quote of the day: As we had a discussion about how the author of the novel we are currently reading also writes porn, Freedman goes on a tangent to say, "This reminds me of a poem by a man named Alan Dicky" (oh the humor of a good pun)  So it's crunch time and everyone is busy studying for finals and getting drunk inbetween.  This will be a short post bc I quite frankly cannot think of a single interesting thing to write about.  I mean, there was that midnight trip to Morgan City last weekend, followed by that midnight trip to Lafayette...quote of the weekend goes to Andy McDonald..."Wow, girls, we haven't hung out in so long and now we are all sleeping together!"  Just use your imagination....  Update on Dec 13th party time!  I have created a poll on my AIM profile to see what you all would like to do that evening.  I have consulted my committee (ie, Beth) and we decided that we would stick with having dinner somewhere on St. Charles...probably Houston's or Bravo or something.  If you have a suggestion, let me know via the comment link or in an email.  I think the tour idea has fallen through, it would be an extra amount of money on top of dinner, but if anyone is interested in doing it another time, let me know.  I did it once before and I just find it really fascinating.  Ok, options:  Uptown bars, Downtown bars, the Quarter, Rock and Bowl to see the Molly Ringwald's perform (80's cover band)  no, we will not be bowling, they have tables and a bar and a dance floor.  Should we choose the band, we could also leave there and go uptown if we wanted to.  That is, if you guys can hang with your one and only "district drunk".  Take the poll or just let me know via comments or email (is this redundant yet?)  What can I say, I believe in democracy and I want us all to have a great time!  Well, that is all from me...good luck with your finals...and in the words of Socrates (thanks, Jeff) "I got the bottle, you got the cup, c'mon everybody, let's get fucked up!"

      Well, it's Tuesday and that means it's time for another Freedman quote of the day...and for today, it is this: "The penis is big, it's there, and it's fun, but the clitoris is so small, I mean, many men can't even find the thing most of the time." For those interested in getting the course info for this one, jot me a line and I will fill you in  Moving on.... I've decided that the leaderhip of LSU CKI can best be put to use in word problems for a fifth or sixth grade student.  It would read something like this: If you start with 5 board members and 6 committee chairs, and 3 board members quit, allowing 2 committee chairs to move up to the board, and 2 more committee chairs quit, leaving 2 club members to move to the steering committee, and then one of those 2 quits, leaving another club member to move up...what percentage of the original leadership is still intact?  Or maybe the real question is, what affect does this have on the potential leadership within the club?    Let's face it, with all this shuffling, the members of the club are losing faith in those that are responsible for running the club, and so those in the club with the potential to be great leaders are shrugging off that calling because of the instability of the way in which our organization has been run.  For the sake of all parties involved and interested, I would like to borrow some simple suggestions posted by Bobby Schroeder on his blog last night.  Apparently, there are several clubs in the district who are having problems lately, and I think Bobby is on to something.  They are as follows:  1) Leaders should listen to the opinions of others, and take advice when offered. They should make their own decisions, but at least get input from others. If 90 percent of the members hate 100 percent of the decisions, then something is wrong.  2) Leaders should go to as much training as possible, and read the few intelligent and simple damn rules we have. Such as, you have to be enrolled to be a member. Seems simple enough, but I guess it is not.  3) People need to realize that CKI is not the be all and end all of one's life. Clubs should be happy that people are members at all, should not take them for granted, and should appreciate them for the time they CAN commit. This is CKI, not Greek Life, where you get fined if you miss stuff. That ain't our thing, baby!  4) What has happened to interclubbing? What ever happened to a bunch of people jamming in a car, driving 150 miles on a Saturday morning, doing an all day service project, then getting dinner at Wendy's, going to someone's house, and getting as drunk as possible? I learned at least 20 times as much about CKI, and the people who are in it, at parties, football games, and the like as compared to stuffy meetings. I am telling you, the board that drinks together stays together! And that goes for clubs, members, etc. Some of my best memories are Xmas parties that Charles threw, going to LSU football games and drinking with CKI people but it was not a CKI event, going to parties after dances, projects, and open houses, and all that stuff. Why are we so friggin scared of post parties and alcohol? That is the best way to get to know people. You don't have to drink, you don't have to go, but for goodness sakes, don't prevent others from doing that if they want to.   With that said, I would also like to post an invitation to do some of that fellowship-ing that we all love so much to celebrate the end of another semester.  On December 13, in New Orleans, I am thinking one of two things.  The first is to do dinner and then go to the quarter and get shit-faced (I can see the surprise since everyone in this district apparently thinks that I am an alcoholic)  The second option is to do dinner and then take the New Orleans Haunted History Tour through the quarter...I think this would be something kinda neat and different to do on Friday the 13th (see the element of spookiness there??)  In any case, send me a comment or an email if you are interested and let me know which option you like better.  Of course, if we do the tour, we will have time to get shit-faced after, so don't worry about that.  Hope to hear from some of you soon and good luck with your finals!

      Update on alcohol personality test: Chassidy is G&T, Kevin and Shannon are Martini's and Erin D is some kind of a shot...though she could not remember what kind.  Now, for the post.... My car was broken into Friday night while I was at work at Best Buy.  Stolen from my backseat was the Operation Christmas Child gift that LSU CKI collected money to purchase for a needy child this holiday season.  After Erin and I spent hours on end collecting an assortment of holiday goodies for this child, someone broke a window of my car and took that box (along with a pack of hangers, some hiking boots, and my vehicle registration).  I just want to say that really works against the true meaning of the holiday season.  How can someone be so fucking heartless as to take a gift that was intended for a needy child?  It pretty much has broken my heart and left me with an awful feeling as we ring in the twelfth month.  It also has added to my "Why does this type of shit always happen to me" attitude, which is pretty dominant right now.  When I went to work yesterday, someone said, "I love this girl, she is the only person I know who can have her car broken into one day and be singing and dancing at work the next day"  If only you knew me better, you would know that I only sing and dance because it helps me to avoid that breakdown that I just can't seem to find the time for these days.  Besides, when things like that ALWAYS happen to you, you start to just accept them as a part of your normal, ordinary day.    So, that got a little deep...but I wish everyone who reads this a great holiday season and I hope that you all promote the true reason and spirit of the holiday in all that you do...obviously, there are some people out there who need someone to remind them.  Oh, and all you LSU CKI'ers can relax....they did not steal the bingo wheel (whew)

      Yeah, so I just saw the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding...highly recommend that you check it out if you haven't already.  And yes, I realize I am probably like the absolute last person to see it...but still  Very good and worth a number of good laughs..some of which you will notice as new away messages.  LSU hosted a bowling service social on Sat and I am happy to report that we raised 171 pounds of food...that is just plain awesome!  Thanks to everyone who came out to the event (NSU ROCKS)  And the party...what can we say about the party.  Who in their right mind would make a rule in a drinking game that I cannot talk.  Let's face it, my two favorite things to do are drink and talk...combine drinking as a "punishment" for talking and all hell breaks loose.  And Bobby, you are an evil evil cheater.  Here's a shout out to Becca and Tommy...thanks for coming and hanging out.  I so miss my Otic Chick!  We should so totally go shopping sometime very soon!  Yeah,  this is random, and I am tired...so I'll cut it off now!  Have a good one!

      There's a really great country song (yes, they do exist) that talks about what would happen if tomorrow never comes.  It focuses on the idea that if we don't tell people the way that we are feeling today, they may never have that chance to hear it, to find out, to experience that love we have for them, or that appreciation for them being a part of our lives.  Why is it that we are so often afraid to tell people the way that we really feel about them?  Is it the fear that it will not be mutual, that it may be cast away as some minor attraction rather than appreciated for the beauty of its honesty?  Why do we hold back, when the person that we want, that we love, that we care about, is right there in front of us...and yet, so far from really being our own?    And, yes, it can work both ways.  Why is it so hard to tell someone that we do not like them or care for them?  Why do we lead people on, knowing that they are NOT the one for us, that we would never be happy with them, that we always will be looking over our shoulders for something better to come along?  I don't expect that anyone reading this has an answer, but I do suspect that you all know exactly what I mean when I say all of this.  We have all hidden emotions from someone who was well-suited to receive these emotions, whether they were positive or negative.  We have all bitten our tongues to avoid hurting someone or to protect ourselves from pain...and it's okay that way because it is a part of our human nature.  I write this because it has hit home a lot more recently for me on a personal level than it ever had before.  And after recently hearing the song, I was in a state of awe at the truth and beauty behind its words.  And so, in conclusion this evening, I leave you with these simple words of advice...  Tell that someone that you love Just what you're dreaming of.... If tomorrow never comes.  Sweet dreams, everyone!  I love you all!

      Welcome back to school everyone!  I am liking my schedule and my teachers thus far (of course, it is only the end of day two here in beautiful Baton Rouge...so it won't last long).  My media law teacher seems to be pretty funny...warned us on day one that if our cell phone rang in class, she would take it away, answer it and find out all about our sex life.  Very funny shit and a good way to intimidate students on day one.  Of course, I will have to remember NOT to use that exact line in my future as a high school teacher.  I can hear those disgruntled parents right now.  If anyone out there has not been exposed to the glamour and glitz of the new movie version of the Broadway hit, CHICAGO, go now.  Stop reading immediately and go to the theatre.  It is by far a well-done film, worthy of seeing time and again.  Not quite the stage glamour that it has shown in the past, but it looks great on the movie screen regardless.  As many of you know, I spent some time vacationing in Colorado, Wisconsin, and Michigan over the holidays.  I now know that I am a true southern belle.  I love to hear them say "You guys" and all, but that cold weather is out of control!  And they didn't even think it was that bad while I was there!  Amazing!  A shout out to the wonderful world of W-UM if any of you happen to be reading...I miss y'all already, but not the weather, the Pepsi, nor the custard!    Well, that's about it for tonight, just was in the mood for a little rambling.  If anyone will be in Baton Rouge this weekend, LSU is hosting a Bowling Service Social at Circle Bowl on Florida Ave.  Gimme a call or drop me a line for info and/or directions.  Following, if anyone needs a place to crash, also let me know.  I will also be hosting an intimate get-together that evening.  Nothing spectacular by any means, just a let's hang out and enjoy a drink together ambiance.  Let me know if you are interested.  Until next time, remember that the soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears.  Goodnight all

      As the speed and altitude increased, I took one final glimpse at the landscape I had grown to adore over the past few days.  We took a quick turn and the peaks of serenity, beauty, and awe-inspiring wonder were behind me.  Like a phanton from a dream, they no longer exist...taken away from me as quickly as they had been given, leaving me only with a memory and two rolls of film to look back on.  And yet, when I close my eyes, I am there again...climbing, photographing, staring and wanting to reach out to them.  But you cannot reach out to an image and expect it to be reality.    We want to understand them, to know how and why, we want to be a part of their past as much as we want them to be a part of our future.  So we question, we think, we research...but in the end, the best solution is to believe.  They are the work of a greater hand, a pyramid to the heavens and a glimpse at the beauty of what our Creator is capable of forming.  I stare at them, and I am moved.  I question them and I believe, I have faith.  Why not take that leap for yourself?

      Welcome to 2003 everyone, the year of moderation and learning what life is like from a much more sober standpoint.  Last night was a good one, but ringing in the new year watching someone I care about passed out over a toilet and then taken away in an ambulance scared the shit out of me, to be quite blunt.  For those of you who know me well, you know that I very very seldom cry, but last night, I did.  I've been on a drinking kick as many of you who are reading this already know.  I have gotten drunk, forgotten the many things I did while I was drunk, woken up throwing up, and still gone out the next night to relive the fun.  Meanwhile, I am killing my liver and usually creating drama along the way.  Well, last night was a lesson for me...I can't stop thinking about how that could have been me had I gone a few more rounds with Jose Cuervo, I have never been so scared or felt so helpless as I did at that party.  The victim of Southern Comfort has been reported to be okay today, and for that, I am thankful.  For the fact that there was a really really good friend there to help said victim, I am also grateful.  So, where does this leave me?  Well, there are these things called New Year's resolutions that people often make.  I usually don't because I can never keep them.  This year, I have decided that I will make one that is long overdue.  I am going to slow down on the alcohol intake.  It's a simple one that I will hopefully be able to keep and that will probably help me to remember this year and not make as many mistakes as I did in 2002.    As a final note, I want to express my thanks to the many of you who were there for me last night after the little incident.  I needed a shoulder to cry on, and I had a wide selection.  I won't name names, because you all know who you are.  I am here for you guys and I love you much!  Let's have a great year!

      Yeah, so this thing SUCKS ASS!!!  I absolutely wrote for like 30 minutes this morning about some critical as well as not so critical topics, only to hit post and see the dreaded screen THIS PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED!  Soooo, I shall try again to be as witty and clever and insightful as I was at 745am...but I make no promises.  Today's post will focus on the following: -American Idol and the stupidity of emerging reality TV shows by Fox (no offense, Matty Magnum) -Pathetic married men who are trying to seduce Candace -My decision as far as running for guvna of this great district -Whatever else I so choose to ramble about  Well, I skipped class last night because I wanted to use the time to catch up on some work and get a paper done....and I actually did that, yay me!  I also was able to watch American Idol on TV rather than having to go back and watch the tape (yes, I am pathetic and addicted).  I thought that they all sucked last night.  And what is up with Nasheeka never wanting to smile?  She looked absolutely miserable the whole time!  Such a stage presence, really.  Anyway, I have no predicitions bc I didn't like any of them.  Today for the first time ever, I visited the official AI website, and I also found a link on Dave Barry's blog that goes to the SAVE FRENCHI campaign.  For those of you who don't know who Frenchie is, she was a damn good contestant on the show who was kicked off for having posed for an adult website.  Now, there is a big fuss going around to try to save her chances....even though I am pretty sure she's too late.  Check it out by linking to the Barry blog and go from there.  Fox has now taken reality TV too far.  They have this new show where singles go on TV looking for someone to marry.  They are sick of the dating scene, so they have somehow figured that maybe if they skip all that and go straight for the ball and chain, life will be better.  One question, if you can't stand to be with someone for one date, what makes you think that you will be ok for a lifetime.  The best part is that we, the viewers, get to watch this show and decide who marries whom.  Ummm there are some sick sick people out there and I would be a little nervous about that myself.  And hopefully they are giving these people a supply of birth control....can you imagine if someone got pregnant and then they split up.  Imagine the poor kid...."Mom, how did you and daddy meet?"  Mom: "We went on a tv show and were paired up for marriage, so we figured since we were married, we would fuck like rabbits (cause being married before sex is sooooooo the trend in our society) and then we decided we hated one another, but I was pregnant with you already.  So, here you are"  All I can say is that is fucked up.  If you haven't seen the letter of seduction Candace received from an admirer, go to her site and check it out.  And she says she has a wild mind.....My thoughts are that this guy is obviously way totally pathetic and creepy.  I mean, this is why there is so little faith in the male species.  He is either trying to impress her with his Shakespearean brilliance judging from his language, or else he is just that much more pathetic and talks like that all the time.  That's all I have to say, read it yourself and make your own judgements on this creep.  Moving on to my thoughts on running for governor.  I would honestly like nothing more than to serve as governor for the next year, however, the decision has been a haunting one that I am starting to have doubts about.  As you may or may not know, I will be student teaching in the fall, graduating in Dec, and then hopefully entering a grad school program at UNO in the spring.  My doubts about governor stem from the fact that as a student teacher, I will be very busy and I don't want one position to negatively affect the other in any way.  Soooo, where does that leave me?  I know that a lot of ppl were behind me in wanting me to run for the position, and I know that it is something that I would love to have the opportunity to do, however, if the Alison that is not the CKI person needs that time to finish school and get moving towards the real world, perhaps that is what is best for her.  I will make my final decision by tomorrow and I will post to let you all know.  I have also thought about not doing governor, but possibly taking on Sec/Treas....which many have told me I would be crazy.  So, I welcome comments and suggestions if you have them.  And so, that brings me to random thoughts by me time :)  MG2K3 is coming up.  I am trying to find someone to work for me Friday so I can leave BR on Thursday to start the party a day early!!  I can't wait and it will be a blast.  I am glad to know that I will be in the company of so many wonderful ppl and good friends....even Lisa will be here from Tennessee!! YAY!  A note on drunk dialing....don't do it, people.  Worse even, don't let your friends do it for you.  Still worse, don't let two of your friends do it within obscene hours of one another to say the exact same thing.  This is just bad, and, in keeping with the theme, pathetic.  That is all for me (God, now I sound like Schroeder)  Hope you all have a great day and HAPPY MARDI GRAS!!!!

      Another long and incredible weekend has come and gone, so here's a little recap of the events.  Friday, the weather sucked, but I headed out to New Orleans anyway to go out for Becca's 21st birthday.  Her parents had arranged for a limo to pick us up at her house, take us to Bourbon St, where we had the top balcony of Mango Mango's completely to ourseleves and unlimited free alcohol and pizza.  We went through somewhere around 7-8 shots each that night, two large pizzas, and a ton of daiquiris.  Now, let me just say this about their daiquiris....they have Blue Crack.  This shit is absolutely amazing and I haven't been able to find it in quite some time, so it was awesome to get that!  We threw beads at the beautiful ppl of Bourbon, making them flash us and dance on the street poles first, of course.  Damn tourists are sooooo naive.  Note to any out-of-towners coming to MG2K3 for the first time....you can keep your clothes on and still get tons of useless plastic beads and other useless items that are thrown from floats.  Also, you can and you will get arrested for public urination....just a heads-up.  Well, Sat, Bobby and I got up early and went to catch some of the daytime parades with his family.  His mom was riding in Pontchartrain, so we saw that one and stuck around for Shangri-La which followed about an hour later.  It was a really nice day and I was glad to meet some of his family members, they are all fun and crazy and great to be around, so the day was a good one.  That afternoon, we met up with Matty at Loyola and he, me, Bobby, Eric, Mike, and Brian, went to grab some lunch and then set out to catch two more parades.  It was a day with the boys, I guess.  Anyway, we get to float number 9 and there is a flat tire, so we sit outside in the cold (cold by LA standards, that is) waiting and finally, we were like, fuck it let's go rent a movie....so we did.    In the process of renting said movie, I discovered that Major Video has quite a porn collection.  As a valued Blockbuster customer, I had no idea what Major Video had to offer, I was shocked!  Sunday was the CKI Rally in Lafayette, so Bobby and I got up at 630 in the god damn morning to try to get to Lafayette by 10am.  We were doing fine until we saw a car smash into the back of another car at about 90mph on the Interstate.  Apparently, the driver must have fallen asleep or something.  So she smashes into this truck and then swerves into my lane where I almost hit her, then Bobby has to swerve around her bc he was following me in his car, and then we stopped to make sure they were ok.  Neither of them had been seriously injured, but that beautiful 2002 model Mitsubishi Spyder was looking pretty rough.    Anyway, we get to the rally about an hour late on account of this, but in plenty enough time to get to be on TV!!  Public access, baby, nothing like it in the world!  We did our little filming thing and then Bobby took me to Rayne, LA....which, for those of you who don't know, is known as the Frog Capitol of the World.  I had never heard of it until I got in the car on the way to Lafayette and Bobby asked me about it.  Then he asked if I wanted to go...ummmm, hello, I am obsessed with frogs, did you have to ask??  Then we heard on the radio that there was a parade and a fais-do-do in Scott, LA....so we get off at the exit and get stuck in post-parade traffic in Hickville, USA.  Or, as Bobby called it, Redneck Mardi Gras.  It was quite a sight.  Well, we thought that there was a big party or festival going on, so we kept on driving to try to find it, and we come to this huge parking lot full of cars, so we are like...this must be it!  We get up a little more and see that it was actually what you would call an auto auction.  Funny, funny shit.  Then we went to the benefit concert at Blue Moon in Lafayette.  It was a really nice and well thought out event, props to UL-CKI.  The night ended with dinner and a movie.  We saw Old School, which was absolutely hysterical!  If you haven't seen it yet, go the day after you see Chicago!  :)  I'm now focused on being excxited about next weekend.  It's looking like POC on Friday, Endymion on Sat, and who knows what else during my time off from school.    Well, I think that I have covered all of the weekends events.....if I think of anything, I'll get back to you.  If you think of anything, gimme a shout out.

      I took Beth's little political quiz too.  Understand that I am not really a big political person in any regard, but have always been told that I am liberal.  In fact, in my mother's words, I am "a bleeding heart liberal"  Wouldn't she be so proud to see that I'm at least not all the way on the left here.     urlLink     Where do you fall on the liberal - conservative political spectrum?  (United States)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    That's all for now, just thought I'd share!

      Something very strange just happened.  All of my friends went out drinking, and I asked them to bring me home first.  This doesn't happen often (ok, this never happens) and I am sitting here now writing about not drinking rather than drinking.  Someone asked me why, and I said that it was because I had work in the morning and thought I should be sober and "responsible" tonight.  Then, she asked me if I was feeling ok....  So what has happened?  Is it that I know I have a hard day at work tomorrow?  Ummm, I turn on computer monitors and settle in for Collapse for three hours, so that can't be it.  Maybe it's because I am getting old...I mean, shit....I'm nearing 22, so maybe since Candace and Becca are now 21, it's time for me to turn over the reigns.  Is it possible that I can't hang?  Hmmmm, maybe it's just because I know that I will be drinking all weekend so I am saving myself for that.  Who knows...I just thought that I should share the moment, as it is a date that many will probably mark on their calendars.  And now, let us observe a moment of silence for the fallen alcoholic.  ..................................................................  In other news, last night was fantastic!  We went to play Bingo for CKI and then we went to the Olive Garden to celebrate Candace and Becca and Erin's birthdays.  I was thrilled that Bobby and Tommy came up to see us and go out with us, that was super sweet of you two.    The weekend is going to be great, hopefully this shitty weather will go away before we hit the town Friday and the parade routes on Sat...if not, we'll be partying in the rain!  Hope you all have a great night!!

      Yeah, I am bored and I have found some funny shit online...so here we go.  I have two topics that I wish to address with this post....  Number 1: The psycho ex girlfriend. Now we all know this person, the one who cannot get the hint that she has been dropped like the ball on New Year's Eve and it is time to move on with her life.  I really don't get it either, I mean, if you get dumped....why grovel, and better yet, why turn CRAZY on everyone.  Here are some little stories that I found online today, courtesy of http://www.bunny-boilers.com/Menu.html  But first, a definition.... Bunny Boiler adj. - A mentalist ex-girlfriend or boyfriend with a penchant for all things psycho. The term is coined from the film 'Fatal Attraction' in which Michael Douglas' pet rabbit gets boiled in a pot when Douglas spurns his mistress (Glenn Close) in favour of returning to his wife.  Story one....My ex emptied our joint savings account when we split up. I was so angry that I sent dirty pictures of him to his parents.  Story two....I had to change the locks on my house after the guy I'd just dumped kept breaking in at night and pissing on my lounge carpet.  (Ok, it's supposed to be the girls being psycho, but that is just funny)  This one is a little longer...  My brother was about 19 and had started to date a younger girl of about 17. He'd mentioned in passing that she was slightly odd but she was so 'fit' that he was prepared to turn a blind eye.   His girlfriend's oddness peaked and their relationship ended suddenly one night when he went to visit her, roughly two months into their relationship.  After knocking on her door he was greeted with a voice through the letterbox. It was his girlfriend. He listened at length as she explained that her parents were out and that as she had a dream about him being a vampire the previous night, she wouldn't let him in unless he passed three tests. He agreed and waited for the first test.   Slowly the letterbox opened and out popped three cloves of garlic. His girlfriend explained that if he was a vampire he wouldn't be able to eat them. Grudgingly, he leant down to peer at her through the letterbox and popped the garlic into his mouth. He chewed and chewed and chewed and swallowed but despite a knowing smile on his part she explained that he had failed the first test because 'she didn't like the look on his face' as he was eating the cloves.  Reeling from failing the first test, my brother's hopes were lifted by the reality that he had two more tests to prove himself. No sooner had the thought crossed his mind when a sash window flew up beside the door and a pint of water was thrown over him. Naturally he instinctively jumped away to try and avoid it but his trousers were soaked. Despite the lack of burning skin, he learnt that he had also failed the second test because he had 'desperately tried to avoid the holy water'.   The window was still open as her dad's shaving mirror poked through. It was the third test. He failed it because she couldn't see his reflection.  On failing all three tests my brother walked away, never to return.   So to all the psycho bitches out there, get over it, suck it up and move on.  And guys, if they ever try to make you eat garlic or wear lingerie so they can take pictures, run the other way.  And finally, here is a test to see if your girlfriend (or ex girlfriend) is crazy or not.  http://www.psychoexgirlfriend.com/test.html  Just go to that link and find out for yourself!  Number 2:  A little more about Steak & BJ Day.  Below is a little poem I found online...somehow I know the guys will love it.  It's March 14 You know what that means I'll gobble your knob And juggle your beans Now eat your steak Like a good chum And when you're all finished I'll swallow your cum  That's all I can say...wow

      Uh oh!!  Candace Griffin is now 21 years old.  This means that I no longer have to sneak around buying alcohol for her, that I no longer can use the excuse that she is not legal so she should drive to the party, and that I can no longer have to hear her complain about how she can't get into Pat O's to do a blowjob with me!  (that refers to the shot, by the way)  :)  Well it seems that my comments links have disappeared, and seeing as I had no idea how to get them up there the first time, it may be a while before they return.    It's nearly 8am on a beautiful Wed morning, and I am tired as shit.  Got about 4 hours of sleep (again) last night so I can blame it on that.  The printer is not working in the lab I am working in today.  It's amazing how they have these signs that inform you that the printer is not working all over the room, yet people still come over here thinking they are going to be able to print.  Get a clue, assholes.    In other news, Bobby wrote a little something about Steak and BJ Day on his website saying there was contraversy between the date being March 14 or March 20.  I thought it was exactly one week after V-Day myself, but I guess I was incorrect.  If you haven't already done it, check out his website and the link he has to a Yale University article about the "To spit or not to spit" dilemma....quite funny and interesting....but did the girl's name really have to be Alison for crying out loud!  Marid Gras 2003 is closing in on us pretty fast and I can't wait.  You'd think after years of parades and drunken stupor on the streets of New Orleans, one might get sick of the greatest party on Earth...if you think that, you are one of two things....either wrong or just no fun.  It's all about the people you are with and the fun times that you have before the parades begin and after they end, and that part where the floats come and you try to catch cheap plastic beads isn't too shabby either.  If you have never been to MG, you should seriously consider joining the fun at least one time, only then will you be able to say you truly experienced the spirit of New Orleans.  And at midnight on MG night, that is the only time that Bourbon St is ever shut down and ppl are forced to go home and sober up.  I remember when I was younger, I used to watch it on the news everynight as they cleared out the streets at midnight.  There are always a few ppl who just don't want to go home and it's always amusing to watch them resist the police force.  So, with that said, I am off to play some Collapse on Yahoo and maybe even do some reading while I am here...but more than likely, Collapse will sufice.  Everyone have a good day and please remember that you can get arrested for public urination!

      I'll be the first to admit that I was very cynical about the idea of the TV show, Joe Millionaire.  I thought it would be hilarious, however, to see the reactions of all those girls when they found out that dear sweet Evan was only a bulldozer driver raking in under 20 grand a year.  (And, come on, if he lives in Cali, he is way below poverty level on that salary)  So the show was supposed to have its big finale last Monday....but those grubby little execs over at TV Land thought....why not milk this a little more and get our ratings even higher....I know....let's have a god damn 2 hour finale next week and make these viewers keep coming back.  Ok, so it worked.  I watched it again for the whole 2 hours last night.  My thoughts....I didn't like Sarah at all and I thought that they made Zora look like Mother Teresa last night.  I mean, the shots with the elderly ppl and the stove used for heat...it was a little much.  But we get the point, right?  Sarah is a little princess shown driving around her convertible and sporting her "I was in a bondage and fettish porno so I can afford to wear this" clothes.  I liked Zora.  An unemployed good-hearted small-town girl.  But showing the mayor...that was a little much for me too.  So he picks the saint over the porn star (this makes you guys look pretty decent) and she accepts him for who he is.  Even goes so far as to say she was turned off by that 50 million dollars....now honestly.  I think it is damn near impossible to be turned off by it.  Funny when they brought that one million dollar check out there with her name on it, she didn't seem to turned off at that point.  But I'm not knocking her, I think she is a decent human being and I am glad that he picked her because I think that he really did care for her.  Now those damn execs wanna have a reunion next Monday night...they sure as hell know what they're doing over there cause I know I will be tuned in.  That's all for now...just thought a little pop culture update would be nice for this morning.  Until next time, I leave you with this little passage from Cane by Jean Toomer (Cane, if you don't know, is a piece of African American literature that I have had to read for my African American literature class)  Anyway, I thought this was amusing (or perhaps insulting?) so here you go....  "Now a virgin in a small southern town is by no means the usual thing, if you will believe me.  That the sexes were made to mate is the practice of the South."  Take it for what it's worth....first published in 1923.

      Disclaimer:  The following entry is being written by a tired and sleep-deprived Alison at 920am on Monday morning.  Please bear in mind that she is at work in a lab and is not allowed to sleep, so this is an effort to keep her awake.  If the following makes no sense to you or is stuff that you really don't (and probably shouldn't) care about, you are not allowed to hole her responsible for wasting your time with this nonsense.  That said, I will continue.  I think there should be a new law passed across the entire US.  We should absolutely mandate people to use cruise control when the drive on the Interstate.  I mean, honestly....I was driving back to Baton Rouge last night and there was this Nissan Altima who was going pretty slow....well, my cruise was set, so I zoomed past them.  A little while later, they found the gas pedal and flew past me.   Then I flew past them...they flew past me.  It really really really annoyed me.  Honestly, if you want to drive fast, do it...if you want to drive slow, do it as long as you are out of my way....but for crying out loud, pick a speed and stick with it.  In other news, I have decided that I will be attending the University of New Orleans beginning next spring.  I will be enrolling in a grauate program there to pursue my MAET...otherwise known as the Master of Arts in English Teaching.  How cool and grown-up does that sound, huh?  I'll be graduating from LSU in December, and as much as it pains me to know I'll be leaving, I think it's just that time to move on.    I'm looking forward to this weekend, though it will absolutely be hard to be better than this past weekend was.  Friday night I will be celebrating Becca's birthday with her by partying New Orleans style on that world-famous street known as Bourbon.  Sat, I will going to parades all day and into the evening and Sun, I will be going to Lafayette to attend the BS Divisional Rally for CKI.  I'm looking forward to that and the benefit concert that will follow.  And as I will be in good company all weekend, I'm sure it will be a great time.  Rumor about the status of "punishment" for the 3 ppl who created and administered unofficialcki.org is that they have to receive notification of the I-Board's decision by certified mail.  I would comment about how ridiculous this sounds to me, but with the level of ridiculous-ness that I have been exposed to by this organization in the past few weeks, that idea just seems to really be the norm.  And so it goes, on and on.....no beginning, no end....maybe that is the real reason we are Circle K...hmmmmmmmmmmm  In any case, I guess I will stop rambling now and go find a tree to talk to (thanks Eric, though I hate you for that comment, it is probably one of the funniest things I have ever heard you say)    Everyone have a super terrific fantastic day!  :)

      It's Sunday night and I'm back in Baton Rouge after a really nice and relaxing weekend.  Started the weekend like everyone else celebrating the Hallmark holiday known as Valentine's Day.  Bobby and I went to dinner and then went to see a play at the LSU Union Theatre called Maybe Baby It's You.  Not quite the "razzle dazzle" affect that I tend to love about theatre, mainly because it was only a two person cast and it wasn't a musical, but it was very cute and the actors were excellent.  After the play, we rented XXX (no, this is not a porn) and ate some ice cream...at about 4am, Bobby made a Wal_Mart run to get a fan for my room bc the air conditioner was broken...yes, it was very sweet.  Sat, we went to A Chorus Line.  I'm not convinced he liked this one as much as he said he liked the other one, but he sat through it and he's still talking to me, so it couldn't have been too too terrible for him.  Today, he scored major points by spending about 4 hours playing with my adorable 4 year old niece, Emily.  She's the most active person on the planet, and now she has a new friend.  My mother even cooked for us all and we had a nice little lunch/dinner (whichever you prefer to think of it as it was served at about 4pm and we hadn't eaten anything before that)  So all in all the weekend was a great time and it was spent in good company.  Next weekend Mardi Gras parades begin and this week we celebrate a few birthdays.  Candace and Becca will turn 21 and Erin D will be 22, so HAPPY BIRTHDAY girls!!  If you wanna join in the parade fun, gimme a call or leave me a comment and I will fill you in on some details.  Until then, have a good night everyone!

      How is it that when you are having a really good conversation, it can last for two hours without you even realizing it?  Especially when those two hours start at nearly midnight and you have work the next day at 7am?  Just wondering...  I thought that the feud with the UCKI website was pretty much over, but just when you start to think something like that, you get in touch with someone else who disagrees with your viewpoint or opinions and the catastrophe begins all over again.  I've said what I had to say about it, and it was said from the standpoint of a general member based on what information has been given to said general member.  Perhaps if there was a little more communication to JoeMember from the "powers that be" the opinion would be different.  But, at this point in time, that cannot happen.  I do not blame anyone in particular, it's the way that the world works and once you let the politics get involved, it all starts to look shady and sketchy and everyone starts doubting everyone else's intentions.  This is in no way being written to start (more) trouble, but is rather something that is on my mind....  If you haven't already checked out Justin's picture gallery, do so by clicking here www.allthoselittlethings.com (sorry, i am not good enough to make the word "here" become the link....someone should teach me how to do that.)  They are really quite amusing and I am sure you will enjoy them.  Ok, it's only 7:51am and I can't think of anything else to say (perhaps bc I only slept about 4 hours or so) but I will check back as the day progresses....have a good one everybody!

      Hard at work again....I love this job!  Well, the weekend was quite fun and eventful.  Friday was my dad's birthday so I went out to eat with my family at a steakhouse in Slidell called Young's (yes, I am sure it was not Chinese).  It was kinda sketchy looking outside for being a 5-star place, I mean....there was no sign or anything, it looked like a little house.  In addition, I don't really care for steak (how un-American, I know) and when I eat a baked potato, I like cheese on it.  These ppl didn't have cheese at all!  How is that possible?  I was greatly disturbed.  As always, an evening with my family is always an adventure, but it was nice to spend some time with them.  Even if we did get seated in the smoking section and my mom had to yell at them when someone lit up....even if my niece thought it was funny that she was dancing in the middle of the place to the oldies that were playing, and even if there was no cheese for the baked potatoes.  Moving on, I was supposed to go see Chicago that night with a certain USM guy who called me to see if I wanted to go see it.  Well, I have already seen it twice, but as I absolutely think it's the best thing to hit the big screen since Dumbo, I was all about it.  So I get over to Bobby's house after the family dinner (meanwhile, they had managed to go to Red Lobster and eat over 1000 shrimp) and they had rented....Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.  Yeah, not quite Chicago, huh?  So we watched that and laughed and then watched some good comedy, followed by some bad comedy on Comedy Central.  Sat was the Pimp and Ho party and it was great fun.  My fun ended Sunday around noon when I left to go home and pack up to head back to BR.  But not without a stop at Pancho's, mind you.  And it was Justin's first time to eat there...how sweet!  And since Bobby won't post them up, here is my favorite quote of the night...When you have sex like that, you should leave God out of it.  That's it for me, time to get back to work. :)

      Everything you have heard is true....unofficialcki.org has been shut down.    I won't go so much into the details of it as you probably have read about it on other sites already.  I do want to offer this, however.  It was a great site, and that is the plain and simple truth.  When the site first came out, my own governor sent an email to the district reflector complimenting how great it was.  He called it awesome and noted that it was something positive for the organization as a whole.  Had I never received that email, I may not have approached the site with such enthusiasm....I might not have even known it was there.  That same governor is noted in the farewell letters from the creators of this website, noted with a completely opposing attitude, an attitude I am pretty sure was stirred and created by some members of the International staff, or board, or some Kiwanian up in Indy who got upset that 3 college kids showed up with a better site than they had ever imagined to create.  This, above all else, is what bothers me.  Suddenly, with what I can only imagine was some type of threat, the governors across the districts that make up CKI sent in letters to the website staff asking for their district info to be removed.  Some of these same governors who had, only a month ago, encouraged members to go see the site and post ideas and comments.  What does that say about our leaders?  It says to me that they are puppets who can be controlled and I think that is bullshit.  Justin mentioned on his site that he did not want someone representing him who would act against something that he was in favor of, and I couldn't agree more.    So maybe I was just naive to the inner workings and politics of CKI....maybe if I were in Jody's position, I would have acted the same way, but from where I am sitting right now, I am in shock.  The site was good....in fact, the site was better than good, and had the potential to continue to improve and grow as time passed.  Had we all joined together in its support, would they have had us all kicked out?  Since when did "conduct unbecoming" turn into "having a mind of your own and using it"  I think it's time for our leaders to wake up and for the "powers that be" to grow up.    At the LaMissTenn Dcon this year, I am considering running for governor, but maybe the fact that I have my own opinions and (as many of you know) am not afraid to speak them, publish them, or stand up for them, will work against me.  Maybe those qualities, which I thought were positive for any leader to have, will be my own downfall should I run for the position.  I hate to tell you either way, CKI head honchos....if you get me for governor, you can cut the strings cause they won't be controlling my actions or opinions.

      OK, this is just plain funny, so it had to be posted.  Girls, just go ahead and laugh at the ones you are guilty of...you don't have to tell anyone.  And guys...well, you can laugh too!  Clues A Woman Should Call It A Night 1. I have absolutely no idea where my purse is. 2. I believe that dancing with my arms overhead and wiggling my butt while yelling WOO-HOO is truly the sexiest dance move around. 3. I've suddenly decided I want to kick someone's ass and honestly believe I could do it too. 4. In my last trip to "pee" I realize I now look more like Tammy Faye Baker than the goddess I was just four hours ago. 5 . I drop my 3:00 a.m. submarine on the floor (which I'm eating even though I'm not the least bit hungry), pick it up and carry on eating it. 6. I start crying and telling everyone I see that I love them sooooo much. 7. There are less than three hours before I'm due to start work. 8. I've found a deeper/spiritual side to the geek sitting next to me. 9. The man I'm flirting with used to be my 5th grade teacher. 10 . The urge to take off articles of clothing, stand on a table and sing or dance becomes strangely overwhelming. 11. My eyes just don't seem to want to stay open on their own so I keep them half closed and think it looks exotically sexy. 12. I've suddenly taken up smoking and become really good at it. 13. I yell at the bartender, who (I think) cheated me by giving me just lemonade, but that's just because I can no longer taste the gin. 14. I think I'm in bed, but my pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor. 15. I start every conversation with a booming, "DON'T take this the WRONG WAY but..." 16. I fail to notice that the toilet lid's down when I sit on it. 17. My hugs begin to resemble wrestling take-down moves. 18. I'm tired so I just sit on the floor (wherever I happen to be standing) and take a quick nap. 19. I begin leaving the buttons open on my button fly pants to cut down on the time I'm in the bathroom away from my drink. 20. I take my shoes off because I believe it's their fault that I'm having problems walking straight.

      Ok, so computers are officially evil.  For the past hour and a half, I have been at my new job in the library computer lab addicted to a little Yahoo game called Collapse.  This is a fun game, I would recommend you check it out, but then you may become dependent on it for happiness, as I have become, and that would not be good.  The reason that tihs is not good is because I need to do homework.  So, when I finally pry myself away from the blasted game (ok, minimized the window with the current game on pause so I could take a little study break) I decided I had to write about this game instead.  It really is a lot of fun.  Which brings me back to the point at hand, that computers are evil....  Then again, if there were no computers, I would not have this sweet job where I get to do nothing and make money for it (can you believe that as I type this nonsense, I am actually making money??)  Now, this is my type of job people.  And you all wondered why BB didn't work out too long.  They actually had this stipulation that you were supposed to do work while you were there.  How annoying.  Anyway, I suppose that I will go finish my game of Collapse and then I will begin to do some homework.  Yeah....have a good day everyone!

      How could I forget....the quotables of the Nac weekend  -Go stand by those trees and pose like monkeys -Screw coffee....I need beer -AHHHH!!  I am sitting on my sleeves -You're making a spectacle of yourself -I'm not calling them today, I am going to wait until tomorrow when they think that I am over it and then call them and say, "I am not over it!" -Ladies, this is the Cane River to your left...and your right -Shop Right is Shop Wrong tonight, girls -Don't put anything in this buggy if it isn't full of sexual innuendo -I'm not just Alisoned...I am Alison Pellegrined -I started to give him a lap dance...but he just backed his chair away!  Can you guess who said which ones??

      Combine 4 crazy LSU girls, one even crazier Loyola chick, 400 miles, some medieval dresses and a pole, and Natchitoches will never be the same....yes, that's right, gang.  If you head out to Nac (my new abbreviation for the obnoxiously long and complicated to spell word) you will notice that something has changed....they have been violated!  Myself, Chass, Candace, Ashley, and Becca decided to grace the city with our presence this past Sat night, starting off at the NSU Medieval Ball, where we ate, danced, and were merry.  Well, I was merry right up until those two tarot card readings where I picked the card with the bloody ground and about 10 swords sticking into it TWICE.....now, I usually don't go for all that hocus pocus, but the readings were really accurate.  So when I ask the girl about that one card and she replies simply that it "Doesn't look good"  I tend to go paranoid....so if I should die in the next day or so, know that it was nice knowing you all.  After said tarot card reading and my conceived notion that I have limited time to live, I decided we needed to go out.  I mean, who can go to Nac and not go out to the Pinnacle???  Yeah, I had never heard of it either.  It was (and this may be shocking) FUN!  WE had the absolute best time ever.  We had two for one drinks, dollar shots, and I managed to find both a stage and a pole to dance on.  What more could you possibly ask for in a night out?  Then, we went to Wal Mart.  Ok, now me at Wal Mart sober is funny....me and Becca at WMT drunk is fucking hysterical.  We decided that we needed to buy a watermelon, some frozen peas (which she threw at me), some peanuts, 120 pizza rolls, and there was maybe something else in that basket.  I nearly ran into a group of ppl with the basket bc I was using it as a scooter....but it was a good time regardless.  Oh, and then there was the getting there and getting home business.  I think there are two hot guys in a white truck somewhere in northern LA who have written down my license plate number to avoid me if they ever see me on the road again....sorry, but listening to Broadway music just makes me happy...then there was the man with OOTICA as his license plate....we asked him (as we drove next to him and almost side swiped his beautiful and also white truck) what it meant...he said something he could not afford....anyone got a clue??  We stopped at Cane River plantations and at some shitty restaurant in Ope-who-susss where we had a bitch for a waitress who got a 2.17 tip from us.  I apologize to the ppl of the service industry who are now cringing, but she sucked.  She also got a little note that told her how lucky she was to get that generous tip.  Anyway, it was great fun and I was in good company.  NSU threw a great event and I am glad that I made the time to check it out....that's all for now.  Time to do school work.....................blah

      Well, another DCON has come and gone, and this one has been a little more memorable to me because I decided that I would run off the floor for the position of Sec/Treas.  It was a very very difficult decision, and one that I did not come to lightly.  I wanted it, but I was afraid and doubtful and questioning...but as my nature has always been more the type that would wonder "What If" and have regrets for not seizing the opportunity more than the one that would say "I should have never done this" and have regrets, I grabbed the bull by the horns and ran with it.  And for the first time in a long time, I was nervous speaking to people and answering questions....which I guess is ok since ppl tell me that they could not tell at all.  In the end, the votes were counted and I was elected for the job, and at that moment, something just felt right again.  As I said when I ran off the floor, the true decision was one that came from my love of CKI and my desire to continue to serve this district to the best of my abilities.  I am thrilled to be working with Miss Rebecca Fox, who was elected as governor this weekend, as well as Bich, Tasha, and Tucker who were elected as LTG's.  It's going to be a long year, we have a lot to get through, but I know that together, we can take this district to new heights and set it soaring once again.  More than winning the election, the highlight of my weekend was seeing Bobby there for me this morning at the banquet.  He and I disagreed a good deal about this decision, and even now, I am not sure he agrees with what I chose, but he has agreed to support my decision and be there for me this year.  Showing up this morning truly affirmed  that idea, and it meant the world to me.  So now on to other news....Tuesday is my bday (yay) and Friday is the celebration end of the bday!  So if you wanna go out with us, let me know asap.  Details will follow either posted or in an email, or both.  If you have suggestions, let me know that also.  Hope everyone has a good week!

      Yeah, so first off, to those of you with me last night (and into this morning) who said that I would never make it to work at 7am, here's a big FUCK YOU bc I am absolutely at work with a bottle of Aleve and some caffeine to try to make this a semi-pleasant few hours.  For those who need to be filled in on last night's festivities, here we go....we went to the CHIMES at about 7pm.  We left the Chimes 14 drinks and 5 hours later.  Others at the table had 16 drinks, 11 drinks, and 2 drinks.  We were trying to go around the napkin, which is an absurd idea thought of by LSU CKI member Nick B.  What you do is drink 20 drinks in one sitting, writing them all down on a napkin.  Nevermind how fithy and disgusting that napkin looks, you take it home at the end of the night.  I still have mine, and it has a few quotes of the night along with my lovely list of shots and mixed drinks that I took contol of last night.  Then we went to the Casino and I lost 10 bucks...not too too terrible.  I must now share my carwash story with you all.  Be prepared....Candace and I went to get my car washed (yes, I realize that this in and of itself is a shock).  So we go to this little drive thru no name place and I go to put my window down to pay this little machine.  Window will not go down!  Shit shit shit!  I have managed to break 2 of Chassidy's windows and one of Candace's already this year.  Now I broke my own.  How much does that suck?  So anywho, the guy who works at the Carwash comes to my car and is looking at me like I am nuts bc I am digging outquarters from this plastic ziplock bag bc I found all this change and wanted to use it.  So OK, I get 6 bucks and he's all like, why don't I just put that in the machine for you (As he obviously thinks that I am incapable of anything at this point)  So he does and tells me to drive in SLOWLY and STOP when the machine says STOP.  I try to do this.  I apparently missed the immediate point where you must stop by "ABOUT 4 FEET" says Carwash man, who I am all thinking...this could be the serial killer.....So yeah, he straight walks into the carwash thing to tell me to back up....of course, I cannot hear him nor put window down to hear him, so have to open door inside carwash.....water drips in car.  I back up completely out and he goes inside to reset the machine and I try again.  I apparently stopped too early this time and he walks in again to tell me to go up a little more.  I do and we get shitty shitty car wash.  Then there are these blower things that are supposed to dry your car....well I think you are supposed to stop so your car can dry, but I kept going and never looked back.  Oh well....and my car is still dirty!!  Today, we leave for DCON.  That is all I am saying bc I am quite frankly sick of talking about how poor of a condition our district is in right now.  We all know that it is sad and a lot of people have approached me asking me to reconsider governor and run off the floor.  More and more people everyday as convention draws closer.  I have to admit that it is very very flattering to be asked so often and complimented on the potential good job that I could do.  And I admit, I was backing down....I have literarture and ideas and they'll be in Monroe with me.  It's hard, though, because I know that there are certain people who would question my motives and think I made a bad choice if I changed my mind this weekend.  I've never been the type to do something (or not do something) bc someone else may not like it or the outcome of it....but I have also never been one to shoot down the advice of a person or persons who care about me as a person and as a friend....so part of me feels like I am selling out for not running for something that I have wanted since December (LMT as well as myself) and part of me feels like I would be selling out if I did run (personal friends and aspects of my future that will demand a lot of time, attention and work)  So it's a tough spot for me to be in right now, especially with Becca, who I love dearly and am very very good friends with, has decided to run herself.  I guess I just need to realize that governor doesn't end with an election, it begins a year of service and commitment to CKI and will demand a lot of time and energy from me that I am not in the best position to give right now.  So I wish all the luck in the world to Miss Fox this weekend and I apologize for those of you who really wanted to see me run.  It almost could have happened, but I am sticking with the original decision I made a long time ago and trusting my own original instincts.  Thanks for all the support regardless.  And now the best story of them all that I have to share with you.....Tuesday night, Bobby and I weren't getting along so well.  We were up very late arguing and Wed when I woke up after only 3 hours of sleep and still numb with a headache, I didn't go to work at all, just stayed at home and slept in bc I really felt that I needed it.  Went to class that afternoon and came home, did laundry and cleaned up around the apartment, then I went to sleep.  I felt terrible and sad and just wanted to disappear from everything.  I guess I woke up about two hours or so later, around 8pm and my eye was irritating me, so I got up to take out my contacts.  Did that, went back to my room and Bobby calls.  Tells me he got out of his test about an hour ago and then is all like, "Let me call you back in a few minutes"  I was annoyed...I mean, why the fuck would you call someone and then say that?  Next thing I know, my roommate Amie is screaming at me to open the door as she knocks on it and I scream back that it's unlocked and she can just come in.  Well the door opens, but no Amie.  Instead, Bobby is standing there with these beautiful pink tulips in a glass vase....it was the sweetest thing.  And he came in my room and told me he was sorry we had been fighting and he took me out to dinner and a movie and then the next morning, I took him to IHOP for breakfast.  It was awesome bc I didn't think I was going to get to see him until Monday.  And that also made me feel a lot better.  Well I think that's about all from me for today.  For those of you going to DCON, I will see you there and everyone else have some beer for me this weekend please!  Until next time, remember that unofficialcki.org rocks my socks!!!

      Welcome to Tuesday, the day from hell.  This is my longest day of the week because I have class from 730am-730pm.  I usually get a little break at 3pm, but today I have a meeting at 3 about student teaching and then at 730, I have a KDE meeting as well...so it shall be a really really long day for me.  I am at work right now, so I figured I should take a little time to update this website of mine.  So here we go....  Friday, Sat, and Sunday were fun, got to spend time with my family a good bit as well as Bobby and I even saw Eric.  I'm going to comment on the Wheel of Fortune experience because it sucked and when I am not happy, I tend to voice that.  This was supposed to be an audition for the game show.  That is how it was advertised...it was nothing but a promotional blitz for this show.  Of our group of 1000 people, about 30 or so were called at random to go up on stage and solve shitty puzzles (I think the most difficult one was "Lucky Guess")  No, I am not kidding.  They would "interview" the "players" before they started the speed rounds and ask them what they liked to do for fun.  Well shit, I didn't realize EVERYONE watched the Wheel for fun.  How much of a conformed kiss ass can one person be?  I swear if I had gotten up there and they asked for my favorite game show, I would have said Family Feud or the Price is Right just for the sake of being honest!  Well, after those 30 or so people got their 15 seconds of fame and a cool Wheel hat or t-shirt, or even better, fanny pack...me and Bobby and Eric left.  We decided that since I had to go back to da parish to bring my grandfather a bday card, we should eat at Rocky's.  It was greasy and unhealhy as always.  Then we went to my house and the two of them played with Em for a good while, and I think they had just as much fun as the 5-year-old did.  It was really great to see that.  Sunday I came back to BR to work on some DCON Safety Fair stuff...LSU is going to have a kick ass display and that is all I have to say about that!  Bobby decided to come up Sunday night as well since the last two weeks, my roomies have all stayed home until Monday and he was worried about the serial killer.  It was a very sweet gesture, but not only did all of my roommates end up back that night, but one of their boyfriends was also there.  So we were all very well protected.  DCON is this weekend.  I am excited about it, but a little nervous about the people who will (or will not) be running for office.  I had been considering governor very seriously and then decided against it because of student teaching, grad school, and personal sacrifices that I was not sure I would be willing to make.  Since then, I have had a lot of people asking me to reconsider and I have to admit, I have thought about running since then.  I was endorsed by LSU and I accepted the endorsement, but that is not the be all, end all of the decision.  I guess I will know by Friday when I get to Monroe...  And everyone remember that next Friday we'll be going out for my 22nd bday.  The plan as of now is to hit Club 360, though we will probably go somewhere else first to drink and get started as none of us can afford to get to the level of intoxication I am aiming for at that place.  We shall see how the plans unfold and I'll let you all know.  That's it for me for now....everyone have a good day!  Until next time, remember that pedestrians and frogs always have the right of way!

      Good morning all from beautiful Baton Rouge.  I'm here in the Coates computer lab trying my best to not fall asleep or be attacked by the serial killer.  What better way to at least stay awake (not sure how SK feels about blogger) than to post an entry to my site....so here we go  Last night was awesome because I had my first taste of crawfish and beer with my dear friend Candace.  We went to Sammy's on Highland Road, and I highly recommend everyone in BR to try that place out.  It was the first time I had been there, but the crawfish were excellent and the beer was ice cold...nothing like that southern culture!  After we ate, we went to the casino...I got home to my roommate telling me that I spend far too much time at the casino and that I should not go as often.  Then everyone agreed with her, so I guess we will have to see if I can cut back or something.  Today I will be going home when I get off of work....I actually am looking forward to spending the entire night with my family at my house.  Bobby will be coming over to watch a movie with me later tonight, so I will get to see him as well.  But it has been a while since I got to hang out with my parents and just spend time at home.  Tomorrow, I will be going to Harrah's to see if I can get me a spot on Wheel of Fortune!  How cool is that?  I really don't even care if I get on the show, I just wanna spin the wheel!  Upcoming events in my life include LMT DCON next weekend, which should be interesting since we have very few, if any, announced candidates.  Beyond that is my birthday, and the night before my birthday, I will be going to see a taping of the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.  How awesome is that??  Bobby scored 6 free tickets, so Im excited about that, especially since LSU CKI had the chance to get tickets and they chose a day that I had night class.  It still sucks for all the other LSU members who also had night class, but I guess when the board wants to go on a Tuesday, you go on a Tuesday.  Speaking of LSU CKI, it's gaining a higher tone of being pathetic every week.  Attendance at meetings has dopped to the old board, the new board, the committee chairs, and Eddie.  Something needs to be done and fast, and I hope that the new board will be strong enough to overcome what has happened to what used to be a great club in its time in office.  But that's enough of that, I could say more, but it wouldn't be nice and I am in a good mood.  Got a phone call last night from a good friend I hadn't heard from in a while....he was drunk and hanging out around midnight with some of his friends from work.  It was great talking to him, despite that I had been asleep and he was smashed.  Hopefully, we will get the chance to hang out and catch up pretty soon.  My phone also rang at 540 this morning, which I was less than happy about...a number that looks familiar, but I cannot pinpoint why.  Oh well  Oh yeah, and I am going to Houston for Soring Break!!!!!!!!!!!  How fun will that be?  That's enough for now....everyone have a good weekend!

      The link between Carrie Yoder's death and the serial killer has brought the Baton Rouge community into a state of fear and paranoia.  Yoder was confirmed as the fifth victim of the serial killer this week and a lot has been happening around me to make me a lot more on edge than I used to be.  Let's begin with my roommates.  Of the three of them, two are completely scared shitless and the other seems as if nothing is going on.  Brooke is so paranoid and scared that she has been thinking about going to summer school and then commuting from her Kenner home in the fall while taking 2 courses to complete her degree requirements.  Lauren has decided that she will be staying at her boyfriend's apartment most of the time and he will drive her to class from now on because she is scared to walk to class alone.  Amie is not as paranoid, but her sister is very scared because there was an incident at her home where the hose on her front porch was mysteriously turned on.  Now if we want to assume the worst here, the serial killer has been stalking her and knew she was home alone.  He turned the hose on on her front porch to lure her outside (no forced entry or sign of a struggle), when the 24 year old grad school brunette (ie, fits the profile of the victims) goes outside, he grabs her and that is that.  She called the police instead of going outside and they told her that she fit the profile and that she should exercise a lot of caution....comforting, right?  WIth all of that going on, I am admittedly on edge.  I carry pepper spray and I very seldom go out alone after dark anymore, something I used to do regularly.  I talk on my phone if there is an unavoidable situation in which I need to be alone at night and I stay on the phone until I am in my apartment with the door locked behind me.  But as I have told many people recently, it is not those moments that worry me as much as the moments of vulnerability when I am not alert...let's be honest, I am not always going to be living my life with the thought that in the next few minutes, someone is going to kill me or abduct me.  It just doesn't happen that way.  And besides, this creep could be anyone....I want him found and killed because that is what he deserves.  And yes, that is a huge statement to come from me....but in his case, hang him and hang him high.  Other updates...a big congrats and Happy Birthday to Beth!  She successfully defended her thesis yesterday, and judging from the messages I got from her, she had a damn good celebration last night. But hey, there ain't nothing wrong with that!    The campout is just around the corner...so if you have not paid, do it now.  This is going to be a fun-filled fantastic weekend of bonding and birthday celebration....so come on out to the Okatoma and hang out with your friends.  Following that campout is Spring Break and a possible trip to either Memphis or Houston from the looks of it...so if anyone has a vacation spot comment, leave it below and I will take it into consideration.  Now, last night while I was talking to Bobby, he told me I should write a post about all the reasons that I like him....I thought that might be too mushy for you, my dear readers, and then I read Matt's site this morning.  Well, if that didn't gross you out, I figured I could write a few little things too.  So here we go..... 10.  His car gets better gas mileage than mine does 9. He can outdrink me in any bar across 50 states (and that speaks VOLUMES about a person) 8. He can cook 7. He took me to Biloxi for a surprise weekend getaway 6. He does his own laundry 5. He has an intense love of theatre (he just doesn't know it yet) 4. He's a conservative and a Republican....hey, opposites attract and we both like to argue 3. He's willing to play hide-n-seek with Em at any location 2. He's fun and spontaneous And the number one reason I like Mr Schroeder.... He makes me smile :)  That was in no way worse that Magnum Matty....I hope everyone has a great Wednesday and a fun rest of the week.  Until next time, remember that if you want to print color instead of black and white, please simply select the color printer link on your computer screen.

      In the latest serial killer news, Carrie Lynn Yoder's body was found and confirmed in Whiskey Bay, only yards away from where they found Pam Kinamore back in July.  Another senseless killing of a vibrant and intelligent young lady who had her whole life in front of her.  It really makes me sick to know that there is some crazy guy running around who thinks he just has the power to kill people on a whim.  I pray that they find this person and give him the punishment he deserves.    In other news, I am at work and have already had to deal with two people, one who could not figure out that the color printer was the one that said COLOR as opposed to the BW which stands for Black and White.  I also had to deal with some guy whose disk was not pulling up his paper that he spent all night writing and is due in 20 minutes.  Well guess what jackass...that is your problem, not mine.  Yes, it sucks, but it has happened or will happen to all of us, and all you can do is suck it up and get over it.  The weekend was great fun.  Friday night, Bobby and I went to dinner and then went to see an improv troupe at Wit's Inn in mid city.  Tommy and Becca came with us for that, which was by far not the greatest improv ever, but it had its moments.  I personally loved how the bar had this sign advertising all of its specialty cocktails and when I ordered two different ones, the bartender looked at me as if I just asked her to mix her liver with amaretto.  The worst part is that she tried to play it off by telling me she had to check to see if she had the ingredients and that I was asking at an "awkward time" bc she was busy.  Ummm, hello, I am at a bar asking for a drink...how the fuck is that awkward timing??  So she finally gets out this little book and makes the drinks....mine was alright, but Bobby's was just plain gross.  Never never never order Planter's Punch at Wit's Inn....keeep that in mind.  Sat was a pretty lazy day...slept late, went to get Em a bday present with Bobby, then we had lunch, lounged at the house, and cooked dinner together.  Tommy and Becca joined us for Bobby's self proclaimed "world famous" spaghetti and meatballs....and yes, it was pretty good.  That night, the 4 of us drove up to Baton Rouge for the LSU CKI 80's Tacky Prom, which was delightful.  We drove back that night and all pretty much passed out when we got home.  Sunday was Em's party, which was both good and bad.  There was a HUGE parade in St Bernard that day, so most of the kids Emily invited did not show up to the party...so it was pretty much my family and these other two little girls...which kind of sucked for my sister because she put a lot into making the party a success (time, money, and effort wise).  Emily did have a good time, but she is the type who makes her own fun anyway, so the fact that there were only 2 kids there did not really seem to faze her.  I felt bad for my sister more than anything because I know how hard she worked to make it happen.  But I guess that is just the way things are.  And the line of the day from the party Larry: Em, why don't you wait til your mom gets in here to open that present? Em: (looks directly at Larry, rips the paper off the box and says) Too late, it's already ripped  Such a cute kid huh?  That was pretty much my weekend, Bobby came back to BR with me last night and we went to dinner and watched Superstar...but we both were falling asleep so we didn't get through the whole movie.  He left this morning when I came to work, so I am now on my own to avoid the serial killer.    Well that is the weekend update from me.  Everyone have a good week, and until next time, remember to never never order the thin cut catfish at Mike Anderson's.  It's just not good.

      Well they may have found the body of Carrie Lynn Yoder yesterday afternoon in the same place they found Pam Kinamore only a year ago.  According to this story on the WWL-TV website (http://www.wwltv.com/local/WWL031403yoder.59e4835f.html) a source has reported that the Yoder family was told that the body was that of their daughter.   Came at a rather ironic time, just when young Elizabeth Smart was found and safely returned home and there is a slight ray of hope and excitement in the air, they find a body in Whiskey Bay.  It has neither been confirmed or denied that this is indeed Yoder's body, but everyone around here is feeling pretty ominous about it.  Please please please be careful, everyone.  I experienced a bittersweet feeling yesterday as I sat in the College of Education filling out all my graduation paperwork.  A gamut of emotions swept over me as I sat in that room for one of th last times ever.  Excited about the end finally being in sight, relieved to see that I only had student teaching left to finish on my degree audit, anxious about what will come next for me....it was an incredible moment for a college student at the end of the line.  Thinking back, there have been times when I thought I would never get out of here, times when all I wanted to do was get out, and times when all I wanted to do was stay in school for the rest of my life.  But it truly has been the experience of a lifetime, and chances are, if you are reading this....you are a part of the reason why.  Friends, organizations, and that deep rooted sense of pride and spirit that comes from being an LSU Tiger and loving the Chimes, despite the smells and the service and the waiting.  So let me take a moment to say thanks to all of you out there who have been a part of the past 4 years of my life...you have made a difference.  Other updates....I get to go to the Children's Museum and play on Sun for Em n Em's bday party!!  LSU 80's Tacky Prom is Sat night, should be interesting...to say the least.    Spring Break 03 is fast approaching and since New York is not looking too positive at this point, a new idea has been brought to light to take a little trip up to Memphis, Tenn for a few days.  Nothing set in stone, but it could be a fun little getaway at the very least.  We'll see what happens.  Well that is all from me on this dreary Friday morning, I hope you all have a good weekend and stay safe.  Until next time, say a little prayer for the Yoder family and for the safety of the women in and around the Baton Rouge area...oh, and Happy Steak and BJ Day everyone! :)

      So we all knew that there was a maniac serial killer running around the Baton Rouge area, but the level of fear has been on the rise a lot more recently with the latest abduction of yet another LSU graduate student.  This time, the girl was last seen at her home after she made a trip to Winn Dixie a few blocks away to get some groceries.  The police found the groceries still in their bags on her counter when they investigated her home.  The girl lives only a few blocks away from the LSU campus, and the on campus apartment complex that I live in....talk about hitting close to home in the literal sense.  And as I walked to class yesterday, I thought about the guy who is behind all of this.....I very well might have walked right past him the last few weeks....had a conversation with him, shit I could be his study partner for English and I wouldn't know any better.  Well, when you think of it in those terms....it sort of creeps you out.  So as a warning to all the local southern girls, be careful and be aware of your surroundings....also, if you do not have some sort of defense mechanism like pepper spray or a machine gun, I highly recommend that you invest for your own safety.  In other news, I would like to announce that Bobby Schroeder is the first person I have ever met who openly complained about the Chimes.  For those not familiar with this establishment, it is a restaurant right off campus here in BR where students go to drink, sit, and shoot the shit, if you will.  The appeal of the place is that it is relatively inexpensive, very convenient to the campus, the food is good, the beer is brewing, and the place embodies tradition.  Yes, chances are on any given night at any given time, you will have to wait for a table....yes, that wait may be longer than you wanted to wait or were prepared to wait, and yes....the service is not why you go.  In its defense (as I know Bobby plans to write a blog about how much it sucks) it does not suck!  Anyone who has been there may leave a comment to support the Chimes and put Bobby to shame.  I must say, however, that I was thrilled to be able to see him last night and that he took the time to drive up to BR to spend some time with me.  It was completely spontaneous and he went with it, which made me smile and turned out to be a lot of fun.  Matt and Candace also joined us last night as Matt came down to spend his Spring Break with Candace since they so rarely get to see one another.  And I am pretty sure Matt enjoyed his experience at the Chimes.  :)  That's it for now....2 midterms down and 2 to go, so I must get back to studying.  Until next time, remember that bad "cereal" killer jokes are not amusing to anyone who goes to LSU at this time....and when they bring more than one spoon with your dessert, it is not so you have one for each hand.  Everyone have a great day!

      Well, my weekend was pretty fun and eventful...  Friday, I went with my two sisters, my niece, and a bunch of friends to Boomtown on the Westbank for their really shitty seafood buffet.  We were all disappointed with it, but Emmy seemed to have fun playing Hide and Seek in the casino lobby with Tommy and Bobby, and also learning to fling grapes off of the end of a spoon at people with the two aforementioned gentlemen...then I gambled a little bit, but not too late because Sat I had to take the 1st two parts of my 3 part teacher certification test known as the PRAXIS.  A note on the PRAXIS...I paid 300 bucks to take a test...that's right, I PAID MONEY TO TAKE A TEST.  So when I get to UNO at 710am and there are people who straggle in at 745am and they are signed up for the wrong test, or they do not have their ID's, I get annoyed....I assume this is natural.  Anyway, because many of the future educators of America are such morons, the test that was supposed to end at 930am did not end until nearly 11am.  This was very annoying to me.  The second test went a little better, still started late and the moderator's cell phone went off in  the middle (after she read about cell phones being off at the beginning of the test and acted like a total bitch to us all)  I have decided to report her to the officials...she deserves it and it would make my mother proud :)  After the second test, which was considerably rough and gave me a headache, I went over to Bobby's because he had worked up some sort of a surprise for the night.  Well, I get there and he tells me I cannot go in the house, and asks me where my bag for the night is.  Then he puts the bag from my car into his car, opens the car door and tells me to get in the car.  In true Alison reaction, I say "What the fuck do you mean, get in the car...where are we going?"  HE says, "Get in the car"  So I get in the car.  After refusing to tell me where we are going, I finally figure out that we are going to hit the coast, which was a really awesome surprise and a really great time.  We played at Beau Rivage, Casino Magic, and my personal favorite, the poor man (or woman) casino, COPA.  I mean, 25 and 50 cent roulette, people...you gotta check this shit out!!    So it was a really awesome surprise, it took my mind off the day of tests, and I got to spend some QT with Mr. Schroeder....and hey, if I was going to be kidnapped, at least the abductor let me gamble, have dinner, drink, and eventually, he brought me back home safe and sound.  Sunday on the way back, we stopped at my house to have lunch with my family, Bobby got to play some football and soccer with Emmy Lou, at least until Mason showed up and replaced him.  DCON is fast approaching and I barely know of anyone who is going....worse yet, I don't know of any candidates for office....so I guess we will see how that all unfolds in a few weeks.  After that, there will be my bday, Bobby's bday, the campout, and BALAGAN at Beau Rivage....a lot of fun and good times are in the very near future and I can't wait for them all.  I guess that's it for me for now...I have 5 midterms in  the next 3 days, so if you get to sleep this week, sleep an extra hour for me as I don't see myself getting any sleep until Thursday night.    Also, as a public service announcement, this Friday is Steak and BJ Day...while it is not exactly a recognized Hallmark holiday, most guys know it's out there...so girls, suck it up (pun intended) for the night and be good to your men, or at least cook them a steak.  Guys, you can send any thank you notes or donations to me directly for making that comment.  Oh, and a shout out to Becca if you are reading...thanks a ton for the awesome frog pj pants...I love them!    Until next time, remember that Sean McDonald may talk a lot of shit, but he lives on a street called Ole Miss.  (I had to Sean, I just found out) :)

      So I promised that I would publish my decision about running for district office on Thursday, but with the festivities of Mardi Gras taking over, that didn't happen.  So here it is...my decision  I have decided that it is in my best interest not to run for the position of governor.  This has been an extremely difficult decision, and one that was not reached easily by any means.  Here is the reasoning behind this decision.    First of all, I will be student teaching in the fall which is practically the equivalent of having a teaching career (minus the paycheck....and yes, it is still called a paycheck even if it is that small)  Considering that alone, it would be a very difficult feat to try to be governor of this district in addition.  Also, in the spring, I am planning on starting grad school.  Those of you who know me know that I change my mind almost as often as I change my hair color...so what happens if I student teach and decide that I want to jump right into a career full time and pursue a Master's part time while I work?  Or what if I decide I hate teaching and want a whole new career opportunity?  I would pretty much be stuck for another semester of school because that is the way of the bylaws.  And even if I stayed on the course and went to grad school, would I really want my first semester there to be in addition to such a distinguished position with such incredible responsibility as that of governor?  And that, my readers, is only the academic aspect of my life.  What about my personal life?  I am an incredibly social person and love to go out and party and spend time being a goof (often a drunk goof) and as of late, there is a special someone that I am enjoying spending a good deal of time with, so would it be fair to me to have to sacrifice those things because I have to go to meetings or do paperwork?  Yes, it would be worth it if I had the dedication, but when the personal sacrifice is outweighing  the reasons I wanted to be governor in the first place, there is something wrong.  And if there is something wrong, then this district deserves someone better and more devoted, who has that something that is right.  I have no doubts that I am making the right decision in this case, though some people are already arguing that I am not.  I also have no doubts that there are many many qualified people out there who would be more than capable of running for the position and leading this district through another incredible year.  I just hope that those persons recognize that ability and potential within themselves and take the next step to being a good leader.

      Has it been a week?  My poor, dear, devoted readers, I apologize to both of you...but it was Mardi Gras!!  Yes, yet another year of revelry and drunken splendor has been brought to an end and it was probably the best one I have experienced in a while.  I started my own MG vacation a little early by skipping out of Baton Rouge around 3pm on Thursday (oh the joy of not having class on Fridays!)  Got to go and see Cirque du Soleil with Becca and her mom and grandmother, who scored free tickets.  It was amazing and I am sooooo glad that I got to see it before it left New Orleans.  Friday, we hit Port of Call and caught some parade that I vaguely remember at all.  Reports tell me I fought off 2 Japanese tourists and a 90 year old woman for a spear that I don't even have...I tell you people, monsoons are dangerous and cause you to lose your memory, so drink with caution.    Sat, I went with Bobby and Lisa and Eric to help Bobby's dad set up the annual Krewe of Kubs parade for boy and girl scouts.  I was expecting a bunch of kids pulling wagons, but these floats were seriously decked out and being pulled by trucks....they were absolutely lovely, all 58 of them.  I was amazed at the amount of dedication that some people put into the event every year, rain or shine, to make those kids have a great experience....and from where I was standing, they were all very excited to be at the parade.  After that, we hit Endymion, where I almost got in a fight with this old woman who kept taking my beads.  Horrible horrible woman, she was.  While I was doing all of this, my thoughts were also in Tuscaloosa, where Pete made his public statement...I wish I could have been there for that one!  Sunday came and brought more parades, including Bacchus, which was quite lovely as always.  Monday we took the night off from parades and went to the casino for a little while, played some Trivial Pursuit (and I vow to never guess RENT as an answer again, for the record) and then crashed to rest up for MG Day, which began Tuesday at 5am.  We got to the site around 7am and hung out until Rex and the trucks came through.  Caught a lot of shit and we were all wore out by about 4pm.  Went back to Hotel Minnesota and took a nap, woke up and ate dinner, went right back to bed....and I am still exhausted!  This weekend, I have to take the PRAXIS test, which is a standardized test that I need to graduate and get certified to teach...keep your fingers crossed for me.  I'll be done with that Sat around 5pm (The tests begin at 730am) so by 6pm, I plan to be drunk.  Hope everyone has a good rest of the week and feel free to leave your comments about MG here!

      Hey everyone!  First off, to clear up any mis"conceptions" (HAHAHA) Beth is not pregnant.  Someone was being funny....I know this bc I IM'd Beth today after reading the comment and said "Who's pregnant?"  She replied, "Someone's pregnant?"  I said, "Yes, it seems like YOU are"  To which she used certain explicatives as fuckers, what the fuck, and fuck that, I am not pregnant.  Those are not direct quotes, but it was along those lines.  So no no no noone is pregnant....or are they?  Hmmm  Moving on, snoballs in BR SUCK ASS.  I went yesterday to get one at the only god forsaken stand in the city and stood in line for 57 minutes for the worst "snowcone" I ever had in my life.  I miss being at home!!  Plans for Friday night are being postponed until May 17th because of JazzFest and finals.  There were mixed reviews about wanting to "fight the fest" and I decided that since I would be going to the fest all day on Friday, I would not want to go out anyway that night.  Now, you are all still welcome to party without me, Bourbon St is open to the public, so if you do want to go, have a good time and drink some for me.  Otherwise, we could try to plan something a little more low key for the evening (ie, dinner or a movie or something)  Just leave me some comments and let me know.  But I do hope to see you all drunk and stupid on May 17th!!  Tomorrow is LSU-UNO game and K Family Night at the Box followed by Second City, so I am excited about that.  Hopefully I will have a special someone accompanying me to both or at least one of those events.  You know who you are and I would love to see you, so keep that in mind (hint hint, wink wink, nudge nudge).  Tomorrow I am also going to a volunteer banquet at the nursing home we play Bingo at so I am looking forward to that as well.  Well, that is just a quickie bc I have to go to class for 3 more hours before my day can be over.  I hope everyone has a good rest of the week....

      Good morning my dear readers and welcome to yet another Monday morning at the computer lab!  This past weekend was pretty good, I got to spend a good amount of time with Bobby, taking him to the Broadway musical SWING! on Friday night and the LSU Picnic and Banquet on Sat.  SWING was alright.  I liked the music, the dancing was great, and the energy of the show was phenomenal.  There was no story or plot line at all, which I sort of expected, but not completely expected.  Because of this, it lost some of its appeal and I felt like it was a really really quick show that was missing something....but good music and good dancing made for a fun night regardless.  The picnic and banquet went pretty well, though lower in attendance than past years have been.  Congrats to my girls Candace and Chassidy who were given Outstanding Member of the Year and the Kiwanis Family award, respectively.  Great job to you two ladies!  Sunday I had an altercation in the parking lot with some boy who had left his car blocking mine in.  It was a really shitty situation and if you want the whole story, I will be more than happy to tell you....but for specific reasons, I will not post it here.  This weekend, for those interested, we will be having a little shindig on Bourbon Street.  Specific plans are not set just yet, but we will be meeting at Port of Call for dinner first (probably around 7pm) and then moving to Bourbon.  There has been a request to go to Cats Meow, so we will end up there at some point, as well as BBC for 3 for 1 and probably Pat O's for a little while also.  Final plans will be posted here no later than Wednesday, so check back and leave me a comment or drop me an email if you want to go so I have an idea of how many ppl to expect.  That's about all from me for now, hope everyone has a good week!

      Hey there gang, sit back and hold on....it's storytime with Alison....  Last night, I went to On the Border mexican restaurant with LSU CKI for our social.  I dare to say that for me, it was a Bobby Schroeder at Chimes experience.  We had a big group with us (around 20 people) and we sat down somewhere around 8pm.  By about 9:30pm, most of us had food in front of us...however, most of us had the wrong food.  I did not have anything.  Sweet little waiter boy Gabe tells me very assuringly that my food will be out soon, he is just waiting on my flauta.  Sad thing is I did not order a flauta.  So I tell him this and he surprisingly asks, Well what did you order?  I repeat my order for him again (he had already asked me twice) and he disappears.  About 20 minutes later, he comes out with the food, granted it was correct, but I had stuffed myself silly with chips and salsa by this point, so I didn't touch it and asked for a to go box.  He leaves, returns with some bags and boxes, which he gives to other people, and then asks if anyone else needs a box.  I say yes, I do....suddenly I feel the need to break into song from Chicago.  If you know the play (or movie) the song of my choosing was Mr Cellophane.  Cause apparently, I was invisible to old Gabe.  So then Roy, the manager, comes to the table.  Someone had been complaining the entire night at the opposite end of the table and I did not know why, but I assumed it was legit.  She complains again to Roy and I finally get his attention to tell him I was annoyed about my food being so late coming out, etc.  He apologizes and tells me the drink will be comped.  I get the bill, it is not.  I bring this to his attention, he takes care of it and hands me a $10 gift card and apologizes.  All this time I was very self controlled and did not make a scene.  We get to the parking lot and I discover that the other complainer was upset about lemons.  Fucking lemons.  I was sitting at the table without food for nearly an hour and this bitch was down there complaining about lemons.  You know it is bad when everyone feels the need to aplogize to the entire wait and management staff about said complainer and her stupidity of bitching about trivial lemons.  In light of tonight's events, I have chosen to express my feelings through a poem....  I went to On the Border And didn't get my order Until 945 I was hardly still alive I ate chips and salsa Both made in Tulsa Finally got a plate Though it was pretty late  At the other end of the table Someone was unstable Lemons were missing The bitch was dissing I swear this is no fable  The moral of this story Told in all its glory If you already have your food Complaining is silly and rude And you may end up quite gory  So there you have it....now for a few other updates and some news  As most of you know, Sat is the LSU picnic and the banquet.  Following the banuet, it was brought to my attention that no one was hosting a gathering to celebrate the end of the year, so I have somehow got into a giving mood and offered my apartment.  This will be no big party, and it will be bring your own alcohol because I cannot afford to get you all smashed.  I'll provide some ice, soft drinks, and chips...beyond that, you are on your own.  So come on out and hang out for a while to celebrate the year with us.  Next weekend I am planning a little gathering on Bourbon Street at the request of my friend Ally, so if you will be in New Orleans, or would like to make plans to be in New Orleans, we will probably go out Friday night, starting at POC and then moving on from there.  This is not set in stone yet, more details will follow soon, but if you are interested, keep the date in mind.  Also, next Wed is LSU K Family Night at the Box featuring the LSU-UNO game starting at 5pm, so come on out for that.  And that same night, Second City, a Chicago-based improv troupe, will be performing in the LSU Union for FREE at 8pm.  They are very good (I saw them two years ago) so I'll probably leave the box to go see that.  Anyway, that is all from me.  Hope everyone has a great weekend....SWING is tonight!! YAY!

      Greetings everyone and welcome to another Monday morning!  It's been a little while (again) since I was on Spring Break last week, so here we go....I'll pick up with Tuesday since I wrote last Monday  Now most of you know that Bobby and I went to Houston last week, but few of you knew that we got married when we got there....read on....  Tuesday night my parents took me out to dinner and then dropped me off at Bobby's house so we could leave early on Wed to get errands done and then head out to Houston.  We arrive at our lovely hotwire Marriot and proceed to check in at the front desk.  The lady at the desk is very nice and then she walks us over to the elevator...fancy, huh?  We then go and pull the car into the parking garage and unload our luggage, so when we get back upstairs, there is this orange message light flashing at us.  This is weird considering NOBODY knows we are here yet.  So we check the message and it was something like this: Good evening, Mr and Mrs Schroeder, this is soandso at the front desk calling to make sure....I'd go on, but you are all already laughing...so I won't  So we walk on over to the Galleria after we get settled and have dinner and drinks...then come back to rest up for tourist day number one.  Tourist day number one included attending the Vatican exhibit at a museum, where every child in the state of Texas seemed to be on a field trip.  It was nice, and then we went to the space center where we realized that some children were not at the other museum because they were here.  Space Center was neat, we took the tram tour, got to see the old mission control, saw some neat exhibits, etc etc.  Then we were headed to the Kemah Boardwalk.  As a word of warning, the Kemah Boardwalk IS NOT in Galveston.  See, I thought that it was, so we get in the car and drive about 30-40 miles out to find this place....as we are riding around and see no signs for it, I start to look through the brochures....find out that you are supposed to take the NASA Road One exit (ie, the road we had just been on when we left the space center)  Yeah, so we drove BACK to exactly where we were and hit the boardwalk for a little while, rode the ferris wheel, and called it a day.  Astroworld was nice, hot, and crowded, but we had a good time there on Friday, and we wrapped up the trip with Minute Maid Park on Sat morning.  Very nice park and a great tour for $7, if you are ever in Houston, you should definitely check it out (or go see a game!!)  Yesterday was Easter, and I spent that at home with my family, then Bobby and I went to Six Flags New Orleans to check it out....we basically walked around to see the new rides and get a feel for the expansion.  All in all, it looked really nice and we were glad to see the additions.  I look forward to many days there this summer!  That's it for me as far as updates go....the end of the semester is quicl;y approaching, which, for a procrastinator like me, means that I have a semester's worth of work to get through in about three weeks, so I'll be pretty busy with school for a while.  Once school wraps up, I'll be homeward bound, possibly working at the St Bernard Parish Prison, which would require me to pack a gun....scared?  Anyway, I should get started on some reading that I have due today.  Until next time, future teachers from Louisiana remember that you can get $40K a state away, but you have to learn Spanish.

      Hey gang, so it's been a while, but here we go....  This past week, I got to see Mamma Mia at the Saenger on Wed (this was a bday present from my sister) and then Thursday, i took Bobby out for day one of Bobby's Birthday Celebration (which is finally over and lasted 5 days)  We went to Outback and spent the night hanging out, having ice cream, etc.  Friday, becca and i took off for Biloxi for Key Club convention, which was an experience.  For my own personal reputation, I will not post the hilarious story from Friday evening, but if you have not already heard, please do ask me or someone else who knows...it's worth it!  sat and sun rounded out the dcon, all in all it was a good time, though i wish i had been able to go camping instead.  yesterday, i went with bobby and his family to dinner for his bday (yeah, still celebrating the bday) and we had a lovely time.  heard some great stories about bobby as a baby, i especially like the one where he was so shocked that his mom was only going to feed infant erin some milk, that he went to her and whispered that he was going to take care of her and get her some mac and cheese.  so cute....  tomorrow, we leave for houston which should be a great time and i am looking forward to it.  so if you try to get in touch with me, chances are you won't until sat sometime or sun.  with that said, hoppy easter everybunny!!!!

      So the district board had its first online meeting last night...it was pretty long and interesting, lots of randomness meshed with lots of serious issues.  As a board, we have a lot to learn and a lot to work on, but we all got through it with some very good discussion about pressing issues facing the district.  If you haven't already, you can access the agenda online at the LMT blog (link on the left) or on the LMT yahoo group.  Also, the minutes from the last meeting are posted on the LMT blog if you want to check them out.  Outside of Circle K, I get to go see Mamma Mia tonight at the Saenger.  I have had mixed feelings about going to this show because I have heard lots of mixed reviews.  I heard it was good, I heard the music was fantastic, and I heard there is absolutely no plot.  I will be sure to post my own personal theatre review sometime tomorrow after I see the show for myself.  After the show, Becca and I will be meeting to discuss Key Club Convention, and then I will get to at least spend a little time with Bobby.  Tomorrow is going to be the big day for spending time with Bobby of course, since his bday is Friday and he will be going camping and I will be going conventioning, I am taking him out tomorrow night to celebrate.  Then, I get to spend even more time with him next week when we take our second road trip to Houston for a little Spring Break vacation.  I am so excied about that!  I'd like to give a big shout out to Lisa Ashby, who was published for the second time recently in an off campus publication.  She was very excited about that when I talked to her yesterday.  So congrats Lisa and keep up the good work!  Other than that, I don't have much to say (I know...weird)  So until next time, remember that a piece of ass can be a drink, and to get to Indianapolis, you take 55 to 57, 57 to 70 and then 70 over.  Some people just like to see it written out...

      Welcome to Monday, everyone!  If you are reading this, that means you survived the weekend, and I am happy to say that I did as well.  First a recap, then some thoughts....  My weekend started early as I drove down Thursday night after receiving a Bourbon Street call.  I just had to join in the fun of that, so I loaded up the Explorer and took off to meet Bobby, Brian, Matt and the "Kansas Girls" for some fun in the quarter.  Friday I got to sleep late and then we went to dinner and Club 360.  It was my first time at 360, and I thought it was really really nice....perhaps a little too nice for my taste, as I prefer somewhere I can go and have a huge dance floor crowded with a million ppl.  But the drinks were good (though expensive) and the view was amazing.  Other drawbacks were that I hate heights and was on the 33rd floor of a building spinning around, so that kinda made me dizzy.  Sat we did party prep and had party.  Those who were there, I apologize again for the drama.  I will now limit my shot intake to less than 35 and that is a promise.  A huge shout out to Justin, Eric and Bobby for being there for me when I really needed you, even if I didn't want you.    Sun I had to leave as soon as I woke up because I had KDE initiation in Baton Rouge, which was held at this place called the Lake House, a very nice place though hard to find.  I actually could not remember the name of the place, so I had to stop at Walgreens to ask the lady working in the photo lab if she knew where the "lighthouse" was....hey, it was close, right?  That about wraps up the weekend for me, Friday is Bobby's birthday, and since I have to leave that day for Key Club DCON, I will be taking him out on Thursday night.  I also will be going to see Mamma Mia Wed night, so I am excited about that.  After that, we have Spring Break and Bobby and I will be heading to Houston next Wed for a little vacation that I am looking forward to......other than that, life is busy as usual.  Hope everyone has a great week, until next time, remember that you should always buy more ice than you think you will need when hosting a party so that you do not have to send your girlfriend out to Wal Mart for the FOURTH time in one day to get more for you!  That's all for now....

      Well I never thought my post yesterday would stir quite this much contraversy, but since it has, I guess it's my turn to share my personal thoughts.  I chose to wait and see what others would say before I did because it seemed more fun that way.  Maybe I was right....  I think that the custom of a woman taking on a man's last name is a rather old-fashioned and outdated tradition.  I do not really see what it accomplishes or the purpose behind it.  Some argue that it is the symbolism of the "two becoming one" deal, a symbol of sharing and a new beginning.  I hate to tell you, but changing your name does not make a couple become one....it's that little ceremony called a wedding that does that.  But wait, what will the priest say?  How about....I now pronounce you man and wife.  You can still be man and wife with different last names, it's happened before.  And why should such a custom be restricted to the woman who is an actress or a practicing attorney?  Because they have name recognition?  We all have name recognition, it is just on a higher scale for them.  I am a published journalist and an accomplished student, my name has been in magazines next to by-lines, in newspapers next to by-lines, in a weekly column of the Times Picayune next to by-lines, it is the name that appears on my high school and soon, on my college diploma.  It is the name that will be announced when I get my Master's degree and the name I will go by when I begin my career as a teacher and as a continuing writer and journalist.  It's been good enough for me for the past 22 years, and I see no reason why it should ever have to change.  Call me a feminist if you want, but that is not really the issue here.  The man can wear the pants in the relationship, he can be the stronger party of the two of us, but if you want to argue that marriage is the consecration of two becoming one, then you are implying a sense of equality.  One half cannot be the power and control of the other half, and part of being in love, of getting married, of wanting to spend the rest of your life as one half of a whole is accepting how the other half thinks and feels about issues such as this one.  There are women out there who cannot wait to take on the name of their husbands, and I think no less of them than they should of me.  It is a personal decision as far as I can see, and one that I decided for myself long ago.  So that is basically all I have to say about that.  One other issue someone raised was what you would call the children...I personally would want them to have the father's last name.  That is the legacy of a father to his child and I don't see any reason not to continue that legacy (unless the dad is a deadbeat crack addict).    Oh, and Matt, as far as Xmas presents go, they could be addressed to the (insert last name here) family, just because I do not share a name with my husband does not mean I will not be a part of that family.  Specific little things like that are really of no importance to me and they make a weak argument for a woman taking on the last name of her husband.  If you worry about what your Christmas cards will say, or what other people will think if you have a different name, then you are really just looking for things to be picky about.  It's 2003, women are liberated and have the right to make choices for themselves.  It may not be the easiest thing for a man to understand, and I know most of you reading this are gasping out of exasperation for my point of view.  And if you are, then you obviously are not the type of guy I could spend the rest of my life with as husband and wife.    But don't worry, I'm sure Betty Crocker had lots of baby girls you can pursue.

      Good morning everyone!  Yesterday was an exciting day for me as I celebrated my 22nd birthday and my first day in the office of LMT Sec/Treas.  As you may notice to your left, there is a new blog linked, that of LaMissTenn Happenings.  This was an idea suggested to Becca at DCON this year by one of the members from NSU.  We decided that it was a great idea and will be using that blog to update everyone on what's up in LMT.  Feel free to check it out and let us know what you think!  Now, back to my other life.  Monday afternoon, I went to New Orleans bc Bobby had some tickets to see a taping of the Craig Kilborn show.  What a waste.  We stood in line behind these obnoxious people for like two hours only to get inside finally and be ushered around by a guy who had no idea where to put us.  We ended up upstairs facing AWAY from the main stage and behind so many ppl we could barely even see the TV monitor that only worked less than half the time!  So we got annoyed and left.  Then Bobby took my to dinner and we tried to rent a DVD....we ended up married with kids instead.  Long story, check out Bobby's blog to get filled in if you have not already!    Now this little incident at the DVD rental left us in a state of discussion bc I have never really wanted to change my last name because I get married.  We talked it over a little, but I am curious about other people's thoughts and opinions on this topic, so click below and send them my way!  For my bday, I got to sleep pretty late and then Bobby took me to the Build a Bear factory where I made Smooches :)  He is adorable and it was soooo much fun to do that!  Every boy should take his girlfriend there for her bday, it was a blast!  Smooches even got to walk away dressed in an LSU shirt, how cool is that?  Then we went to lunch and I hit I-10 to get back to BR.  Went to dinner with my parents last night after my night class and then crashed relatively early.  The closest thing to an April Fool gag gift this year was a Xmas card from my granny.  Pretty funny shit, huh?  Well, that's about all for me for today.  Hope everyone can make it Friday!  We'll be doing dinner and pre-party drinking around 730 or 8 and then hitting Club 360 for around 10 or 11.  Exact details to follow no later than tomorrow, so stay tuned!

      So guess what everyone??  I got a job today!  Starting Monday morning at 9am, I will be working at a small nursery in Chalmette, assisting with their summer camp program.  Not quite as glamorous as I would like for it to be (or as well paying either) but at least I will not be dressed like a chicken and flipping burgers after all!  So that is good news.  Oh yeah, HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA!    Tomorrow's plans for Back to the Beach have taken a detour.  That is because I will more than likely not be there.  Magnum Matty needed a date for a wedding at the last minute and this formal affair is tomorrow night.  As a result, I agreed to go with him and will have to miss the fest.  Six Flags is on for Sunday though if anyone wants to go!  Eric called me last night to see if I wanted to go and as most of you know, I adore that place so I am all about it!  Anyone is welcome to tag along.  In other news, Magnum Night is coming up soon....if you have not let Matt know you are coming, you need to do this soon.  For lists and updates, check out his blog (you can link to it on the left).  I attended the online dues increase chat last night....it was not terribly informative to me.  A lot of the sent in questions were ridiculous and could probably have been avoided altogether.  Obviously if we are attending this forum, we would not need to know where to find a copy of the proposal or how much the proposal was or other such obvious questions.  I also felt that when valid questions were asked, the answers were shady and not to the point.  I found myself wondering when the question would actually be answered, only to discover that it never would be.  I do give props to the LMT peeps who were there, I saw a lot of you and a good deal of the discussion and questioning came from our district.  I am debating whether it would be worth my time to attend the second one, I probably will just to see if I can get any last minute information before I decide that I do not support it (or that I do).  If you want my personal take on it, you can ask me.  The breakdown is that I know we need the money so you can have the $7, the 5% baffles me and I cannot see myself supporting something that puts the documents that are supposed to govern our great organization into conflict.  It's been a song and dance number regarding this issue from the beginning, and unfortunately, the singers and dancers are off-key and ungraceful.  Woah, sorry, didn't mean to get into CKI mode there....but it happens, right?  Chass finally gave in and started a blog.  The link is to be posted to the left soon (may already be there depending on when you read this) so check it out and remind yourself why you should be thankful that she is only one of a kind!  :)  That's it for me.  Until next time, in the words of Shannon Tharp's dad, Have a great day, have a better one tomorrow, and watch out for Smokey the Bear!

      hey gang  first off, the shift key on this keyboard sucks so there will be very few, if any, capital letters.  i am not in any way rebelling against english grammar or using lower case letters as a feminist statement such as bell hooks has done, it is just the result of a crappy keyboard.  speaking of poor grammar, i went to six flags new orleans yesterday and i saw something rather disturbing.  as i prepared to get on the ozarka splash, i read a sign above my head that said "warning: your going to get wet"  if you do not see the problem here, let me explain.  in this case, the your is possesive as in timmy, is that your dog?  it should read you're going to get get, signaling that you ARE going to get wet.  silly silly people at six flags.  life has been quite boring for me lately, which makes me sad and miserable.  i am in the process of looking for a job but nobody wants to hire me because i am only here for the summer.  i am totally broke and couldn't even do anything with all these long boring days even if i wanted to as a result.  so if anyone knows where i can find a summer job, i will take it.  even if i have to dress up like a chicken and flip burgers.....  back to the beach festival is this weekend and it is always a good time.  i am planning to go on sat night to see bag of donuts and enjoy the fest for a little while if anyone would like to come along.  not sure what time i will be going, but the band plays at 1020-midnight and they are always fun to watch.  i'll probably plan to get out there for around 830 or 9pm... drop me a line or give me a call if you want to go and maybe a few of us can meet up there.  admission is 6 bucks.  other than that, not much going on.  so i will catch you all later

      Greetings everyone from the St Bernard Parish Library.    The topic today, a response to Justin's comment and a recap of Saturday night.  So Bobby and I had a fight, while the reasons are nobody's business but our own, I do feel an apology is in order for those of you who felt your night was ruined by this argument.  I am sincerely sorry that most of you did not go out after Port of Call on account of this fight.  To Justin specifically, I agree with a lot of what you said, and I respect you for saying it.  There have been incidents more times than we'd like to think about like this as of late, and I am sorry.  For those of you who did go out, I hope you all had a good time.  As a result of recent events like this, I will be retiring from hosting outings for a while.  Since many of you are like Justin and probably will not want to come anyway, this should not be a big deal.  As a warning, though, Bobby and I were both invited to Magnum Night.  If it's that much of a problem for us to both be there to a number of you, I will stay home.  What happened Sat night sucked for many of us, I wish it hadn't happened, but it did and all we can do is move on.  I sincerely am sorry to those of you who had a spoiled night because of it.

      April 29, huh?  Since that was the last time I posted and some people have been hounding me, welcome back and read on...we've got some catching up to do it seems.  Let's think about what has happened in this month of May.  Well, board training and our first meeting were held in Hammond, LA....it was fun, we bonded, we bought hats...what more can you ask for?  ICON registration got pushed back to May 30, so those of you not registered yet, get your asses in line and get that shit in!  I attended Michelle and Paul's scrapbooking dinner with Bobby that same weekend, which was interesting.  Imagine people like Bobby Schroeder, Matt Mistretta, and Nick D getting into this whole scrapbooking business.  Paul P even designed his page with frogs, which I thought was lovely.  All in all, it was amusing to watch these guys get so into their scrapbook pages.  Bobby, of course, was anal enough to have to draft his captions on a sheet of scratch paper before transferring them to his actual page.  Oh the mind of an accountant.  School update....descriptive English grammar is hell.  This is my second time taking this class (I dropped it last semester bc I did not understand anything)  This semester, I have been hanging on by the skin of my teeth, barely scraping by with a C and it comes down to the final exam.  I needed a 65 to get the C I need to not have to go to summer school.  The bitch has still not posted the grades.  I hate her and her damn class.  Next semester I will be teaching at the Lab School.  3 minute walk from my front door with a really nice and highly qualified professional educator.  Yes, that means I get to actually teach high school juniors and seniors next year....now where did I put that poster on how to make shots again??  Now for the fun stuff....the TIME TO GET FUCKED UP TO CELEBRATE THE END OF ANOTHER SEMESTER OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT This Saturday, May 17, we will be meeting at Port of Call at around 6pm for dinner and MONSOONS.  After that, we will head to Bourbon, starting at Pat O's to find the twice-graduated Beth and whoever else cannot get to POC for dinner in time.  From there, we will go wherever our drunk asses can walk and have a hell of a good time.  I guess I could write some more on this thing, but my brain hurts from finals and I still have one at 530pm today.  So with that said, I hope you all enjoyed this post and I hope to see you Sat.  Please either leave me comment or drop me a line if you want to come out with us to POC Sat so I know how many we will need to get a table for.  Also, if you cannot get to POC but want to meet us, let me know that too so I can make arrangements to find you!  Have a great weekend and until next time, remember that one of the best photo ops is behind a sign that says "No visitor beyond this point!"

      Yeah, so about this whole job business.....  I am making minimun wage to watch 18 kids 5 days a week for 8 hours a day.  That's roughly about 25 cents per demon, I mean child, per hour.  Gee, am I getting screwed up the ass here or what.  But it has given me some stuff to write about that I know will entertain those of you who live for these updates and tidbits.  So without further ado, allow me to introduce you to some of my little kiddies.  First, let us meet Charlie.  Now Charlie is slightly overweight and 2 years old.  He just began coming to the nursery last week.  Well old (rather young) Charlie is still in diapers, which means he needs to be changed.....do NOT get the wrong idea here, I do not change diapers because my kids are kindergarteners.  Anyway, his teacher changes his diaper and comes running out with this horrified look on her face and she says to me, "Wow, that little boy does not have a penis"    Pause for the above to register  Yes, she told me that there is a 2 year old running around the nursery without a penis, so I am all like, how is that possible???  Poor boy.  Well, it is true.  I had the joy of taking him to the bathroom and saw first hand.....in an attempt to train him I had to sit him on the toilet backwards so that he would actually make it into the toilet.  So that is Charlie, the dickless wonder.  Apparently, this is normal though.  There is some sort of medical condition in which the child's penis grows inward (think like an innie bellybutton) and there is a surgery that these kids have to undergo when they are about 3 to get this taken care of properly.  My friend Chantel said one of her neighbors had a child who had to have this done and when it was done, the little boy looked at his new anatomy and said, "Mommy, put it back in!"  As Bobby said, that child has a lot to learn.  Now meet Adrian.  Adrian has a penis and he actually likes his.  In fact, in order to take his nap everyday, he humps his mat to fall asleep.  According to the nursery staff, this is normal also.  Define normal for crying out loud!  This past week, they were laying down for nap and Sarah comes up to me and says, Ms Pellegrine, Adrian has his pants down!  You guessed it, he was going to town on his mat with his pants down!  In other news, life is good.  ICON is coming up and things are good all over.  Bobby and I went and picked blueberries today at a blueberry ridge in Mississippi and then went to the Space Center, which was a really fun and relaxing day.  Then we saw little Em in her dance revue.  Not much else going on that I feel the need to write about, so I will wrap it up for now.  Sorry to be such a slacker, but hopefully I will be able to update this a little more often now and then.  See you in Indy if you are going!

      Hello everyone!  So it's Wedenesday and I am at work and figured I would use my time to post about what has been going on since last I posted.  Here we go.....  So Emily (My 5 year old niece) got a hampster.  It's a vicious, mean little rodent who not only bites, but draws blood when it bites.  Poor thing wasn't even the victim of the parachute game, but still is mean as sin.  Yes, I said the parachute game.  Allow me to explain.  My sister's boyfriend has a 6 year old named Tori.  Well Tori loves hampsters and she got a new one a few days ago.  She decided that she wanted to let the hampster play with a parachute, so she wrapped it up in a towel and threw it in the air so that it would fly with the "parachute".  Well, it did not work.  Instead, the poor thing died from internal injuries.  Kids are so cute, huh?  So then Em gets a hampster, and it bites everyone.  She tells me this is because it is sad and misses its mommy and daddy and that is why it bites.  So she is going to take it back to the store so it can be with its family and then she will get another hampster.  Hopefully, Tori will not go back and buy Miss Star Sparkles.  About the circus, it was not all that great.  The best part of the circus (in my opinion) is always the flying trapeeze.  Well, I was looking forward to that when they began, but they kept dropping the people, so it ruined it for me.  Overall, it was very commercialized, not really good, and seemed rather short.  Intermission may have been the most exciting part because Bobby got me a snowcone in an elephant mug that is sooooo adorable!  Sat was Ted's 25th bday BBQ, which was a good time.  Got to hang out with friends and just enjoy the day together.  That night, Bobby and I went to the movies and saw Bad Boys II which was pretty good, despite the violence and thousands of underage children running around the theatre for the R rated feature.  Sunday I hung out with the fam.  Bobby came to my house with me and we had lunch with my parents and sister.  Then I got to cleaning up my room, which really really really needed to happen.  Went through the closet and got rid of lots of old clothes and shoes....bags and bags.  Then we went to visit my grandparents for a little bit and I had office hours.  Pretty easy day overall.  This weekend is Bobby's 5 year reunion and next weekend, I will be up in Nacitoches for Taryn's play and a night out at the Pinnacle!  I am probebly one of about 5 people who gets that excited about going to the Pinnacle.  Ashley Edwards, if you are reading and want to go, call me....you are the missing 5th for the road trip to be completely restaged!    And now, ladies, the Cane River, to your left....and your right!  Peace out gang....and until next time remember that Wal Mart is your low price leader....just look for the Smiley!

      Hey everyone!  So I decided yesterday that I was going to start putting together my own little webpage at work today, and I did!  I have been learning as I go, but it actually is looking really cute.  I added a link there to the left so you can all access it if you are interested.  If you do check it out, be sure that you sign the guestbook.  Bear in mind that it is still under construction, I will be adding some pictures and other fun stuff in the near future.  Since I am at work, I only had a few pics that I could add today!  Anyway, that is my short update for the day, so go take a look!  Hope you all have a great weekend!

      Yes, I really am that desperate for entertainment that I came back to the blog two days in a row.  Just a little perspective....I decided to go through the archives of my blog the other day and it really is funny to look back and see what was written.  Only in looking back could I really remember some of the thoughts, problems, and ideas I had in the past several months.  It was interesting....I could trace my decision about running (not running) for governor, the evolution of my relationship with Bobby, the countless times I would write from the LSU labs hungover and bored.  Makes for some good memories.  So anyway, I just thought that I would share that with you all....consider going back through your own archives.  You may be intrigued by what you wrote about, feelings you had, or places you visited.  You may even get to learn a little more about yourself in the process.  And also, I found a nice little quote on the wall at work above the fax machine that I thought I should share....so here it is  "If someone offered to make my life perfect, it would be tempting, but I would have to say no, because then life would no longer teach me anything."  Think about it next time life seems unfair or just plain shitty....I think it puts a whole new perspective on things.  Peace out gang....

      Hello my dear readers and welcome to office time with Alison.  Since I sit in an office all day with very little to do, I have chosen to spend this valuable time with you, the reader.  For what you are reading is no book, nor part of a book, it is a man, flesh and full-blooded, it is I....who knows who wrote that?  If you do, leave me a note so everyone can see how smart you are!  Ok, today we will talk about the following: Ascension Parish Traffic Court The reality show FAME Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus My summer reading  Let us begin with traffic court.  Now for those of you who remember, back in February, Bobby and I witnessed an accident on the interstate in which a girl about my age ran into the back of a truck at about 85mph.  She wrecked her friend's beautiful Mitsubishi Spyder and was also late for sorority church as a result of this accident.  The girl thinks that she fell asleep at the wheel and woke up when she crashed.  The two were very obviously coming home to Baton Rouge from a rough night on Bourbon (they had the stamps on their hands still to prove it).  Well, a few months later, Bobby and I get subpoenas that we need to appear in court to testify for the state on July 24 at 9am.  That is today.  So we begrudgingly get up at 7am to go to Gonzales (about an hour away) for this hearing.  We get there and the girl who is on trial does not show up!  So here we are in Gonzales at 9am for this case and the defendent is nowhere to be seen.  Well alrighty then, we get released and head home by 930am.  What a waste of half a tank of gas and three hours of my life.  But we did get thanked sincerely by all the Ascension parish deputies (I think it took about 4 of them to operate the metal detector)  So anyway, we go grab some lunch and head to work, which is where I am now.    So since this girl never showed up, there is now a bench warrant our for her arrest and we still have no idea what she was being charged with in the first place.  That is the really shitty part about it all.  At least we thought we would find out something exciting about what she was charged with, but alas, we got nothing.  Next hot topic (I love that store!) today is the reality show FAME.  Now many of you know that I liked American Idol, I tolerated Joe Millionaire and I was hooked on For Love or Money.  Well last night I watched FAME for the first time, just in time for the season finale.  All I have to say about that crappy show is that it was so OBVIOUSLY RIGGED.  There was no way that those people did not know who was going to win from the onset and that was so blatantly obvious it is nauseating.  Not only that, but the guy who won did not deserve to win based on what I saw.  Granted, I have only seen the show once, but Shannon had sooooo much more talent and personality than he did and it is sick that he won over her.  Also, if you did not know you were going to win and have to sing a particular song, how would you happen to have absolute perfect choreography for it as you sang???  Hmmmm....  And now for a circus update!  I am going to the circus on Friday!  I am so excited about this because I have not been to the circus in at least 15 years.  When I was young, my grandparents used to take me and my sisters all the time.  Now I get to go with my sister and my niece, her boyfriend and his daughter and of course, Bobby gets thrown in there too.  Hey, I figure since we did the baseball last week, it's time for the circus this week.  I think he is at least a little bit excited about going, though not nearly as much as I am.  But it's all good because I know it will be a good time for all!  And finally, my summer reading.  Yes, since I am going to be student teaching in the fall, I have to complete all the summer reading that was assigned to the students.  Probably not a good sign that I have not yet started on any of the books!  I mean, what would happen if the teacher did not do the summer reading?  I bet that would make for a great start, huh?  Maybe I should hit the Barnes and Noble on the way home today...after all, I only have a month and a day left...  Oh well, that covers all the outlined topics for the day.  Allow me also to say welcome home Candace and congrats to those of you graduating this summer....Justin, Eric, and Amanda.  Also good luck to Miss Lisa on her final tomorrow!  Hope you all enjoy the rest of your Thursday!

      Hello again.  I know what you are all thinking, this must be a mistake, Ali has posted on her blog two days in a row???  That never happens!  Well it does now...since I am at work with little to do again, I will share my time with all of you readers out there.  Does anyone even read this anymore?  I haven't been getting any comments lately so maybe you all gave up on me!  How about you leave a comment today if you do read, even if it is just to say hello?  :)  So I was thinking about trying to get some peeps together to go out and party this Sat night in the New Orleans area.  I have no definite plans or ideas yet (ok, I have ideas, but no plans).  So if you are interested, drop me a line or give me a ring and we can see what develops.  For those that absolutely need a reason to go out and have fun, we will celebrate that I have made it through almost the entire summer without being unemployed.  Granted, I am on job number two, but that is just a silly little detail! :)  What else is going on.....Candace is on a cruise and I hope she is having a fabulous time and meeting many gorgeous men who are rubbing suntan lotion all over her and helping her forget about all her stresses and woes back here on shore.  She deserves to have a nice vacation and I hope that she does.  Of course, I wish I was in the middle of the Caribbean right now, but that's another story.  Oh yes, let me share my Winn Dixie experience of the day with you.  I went to the store to get cheese and potato chips the other night and this ignorant woman in line in front of me wanted to get cash back on a credit card that she had no pin number to.  What was worse was that the cashier and her sat there for 15 minutes trying to manipulate the machine so she could get cash back.  Even better, she wanted 18 dollars.  Not 10, 20, or another normal number.  Oh, no, she wanted 18.  She finally got a piece of my mind and left the store with her .65 Snickers bar and a pissy look.  But, I felt better about it.  Well I guess that is about all I have to share today, leave some comments if you are reading and keep Sat in mind if you wanna go have some fun.  Until next time, remember that you aren't fully clean until you're Zest-fully clean!  I used to love those commercials....

      Hey everyone!  I write to you from the 9th floor of Heritage Plaza where I am in week number 2 of my new job.  So far, it has been working out okay, I don't really do too much, but I am learning some stuff here and there and making some money.  Plus I get to see Bobby everyday (even if I do just see him) and often, I get to actually spend more time with him, so that is a major plus for me.  So let me give you all a little recap of this job....I am working as an assistant to a financial rep who sells life insurance.  She is paying me really well and it's an easy job so far.  She is slightly scatterbrained, which makes the days funny and a little annoying all at once.  She makes good money, but she actually asked to borrow a dollar from me!  Imagine that....someone who makes a ton of money asking me (a very very poor college kid) for a buck.  And then, what is worse, she has yet to pay me back.  So I guess that when I turn in my time sheet at the end of the week, I will have to let that dollar slip in there too! :)  CKI has been going good, Becca and I have sorted through some communication problems and differences that many of you already know about.  We had a nice talk with a Kiwanian who offered his help and I think that got the air a lot more clear than it has been in a while.  I am really pumped now for Summer Rally and the rest of the year.  Kiwanis DCON is at the end of the month, but I will not be attending because I have to go to this training session for work.  That Sat night is also Bobby's 5 year high school reunion and I am thrilled to get to be a part of such a special night with him.  I know that Becca and Shannon will represent the DBoard well and give off a great impression to our Kiwanis counterparts.  School is fast-approaching and I stilll have TONS of reading to get done to prepare for my student teaching.  I am starting to get a little nervous about the whole idea of student teaching.  I am excited and ready, but I guess that I will have those jitters for the first few days regardless.  I just hope that it goes well for me next semester so that I can get my first real true taste of teaching at the high school level.  Well I guess that is enough of an update from me for now....time to play some more games on the computer...why is it that every job I have I end up doing that???  I mean, do we remember Collapse?    Over and out, until next time!

      So I have been sitting around and reading up on other people's blogs and I am about the only person who has a blog that has not posted since ICON I think...so here we go.  OVERALL IMPRESSIONS OF ICON Energy was way low and it just did not have the same effect and appeal it had last year in Orlando.  Maybe because it was so early, the attendance was so low, or it was not my first one.  Lots of stuff was done differently, on both the ICON planning end and the Alison planning end.  Example, I did not go to LSSP this year as I did last year.....from what I have heard, I missed out on a great experience.  I also drove 14 hours instead of flying 2 hours this year, which can take a toll on anyone and cause you to be sleepy....  I Board candidates and elections....going in, there were very few people who had my absolute support.  After caucus, I was still struggling to come up with the 9 I wanted to see on the board as trustees.  Dan was in for IP since nobody ran off the floor, and I think VP was pretty much determined as well.  I am thrilled that Erin got on the board as a trustee, I think that is better suited for her.  Of the trustees, I voted for all but one of them.  If you are in LMT, you know who it is....I won't post it here so as not to offend anyone.  HOD....for a little while, it was a circus.  I am so proud of Bobby for his amendment to the dues increase and for continuing to lead with dignity and intelligence.  He would have been a great president, but I admire and respect him more for realizing and  making a tough decision.  Now on to life outside the K.... I started summer job #2 on Wednesday.  I am now working in the same office building Bobby works in as an assistant to a financial rep.  The job has been pretty easy and dull, but I am making good money, have yet to be thrown up on, witness a child without a penis, or leave with a splitting headache from listening to screaming kids all day.  Bobby got into a little accident with his car the other night which ended up costing him a pretty penny (check his blog for details about what happened.)  Because I knew he was upset, I decided to surprise him by getting Zephrys baseball tickets for Friday night.  I took him to dinner and then to the game, and we watched the post-game fireworks that put the ones we saw in Indy to absolute SHAME.  Now that his car is fixed and he has baseball in his system, he seems to be in a better mood about it all.  Today I am just hanging out and not doing much of anything, which is always nice :)  Leave me some comments!  Until next time...

      Hello gang!  Well, today was my second day in the classroom as a student teacher and it has been going okay so far.  I am still in that observation stage, so there is really nothing all that exciting or fun to report.  I am working on my first lesson, which I plan to teach to my seniors next week, and that is on the epic of Gilgamesh.  Other than that, I am working on getting a feel for the school and the kids and things are going along alright.  I too would like to congratulate Lauren and Matt on their engagement...I know I am late, but I have not posted in a while.  You two are so great together and I know you will have a happy and fulfilling marriage!  This weekend is kick-off in Tiger Stadium.  Since I managed to catch a terrible cold this week already (germy little kids at school) I may be skipping it.  Since they are only playing UL-Monroe, I won't be missing much and I can recover for my next week of teaching which will be a little more involved and tough.  Anyway, I know it is a quickie, but I am not at all feeling well and will probably lay down for bed before 9pm again tonight like I did last night.  So I hope everyone has a good rest of the week and an awesome Labor Day weekend!

      This post is for Bacon...  CHICAGO IS OUT ON DVD!!!!  Yes, it came out on Tuesday and Best Buy had an amazing deal on it.  You could get the CD and the DVD for $20 total cost.  Let me just say that they opened at 10am and by 1015am, I was standing in line with the maximum 3 copies I was allowed to purchase (one for me, one for my mom and one for Lisa).  I listened to the CD all day at work and on the drive home, but have actually not yet watched the movie on my new DVD.  That will not be long in coming though!  So yes, it is out and yes, I was one of the first ones to get it and yes, that makes me HAPPY!  Don't forget to be at POC at 730pm tonight!  Come on, all the cool kids are doing it!  Peace out, yo!

      Allow me a moment to clarify some stuff....  Yesterday I wrote about how I was having doubts about going to UNO, and how I was starting to wonder if I was cheating myself by making the decision to go there for grad school.  In saying this, I was not trying to criticize UNO or anyone who goes to UNO.  I think UNO is a great school and they have the program I want to complete hands-down.  The doubts come from the fact that I have not really researched other opportunities since I found that out about UNO.  I do not have the financial resources it would take to go to school out of state, and I guess that when I start to think about how different my grad school days would be and my life in general would be were I able to do that, it makes me wonder why I can't have that chance.  I sometimes think the same way about LSU because LSU was the only school I even applied to attend.  Where would I be today had I applied somewhere else and gotten a scholarship?  How would my life be different if I had gone to school in another state or another place within Louisiana.  I guess it all just boils down to me thinking about things like that, and when I start to think about them, I write them here.  So my sincere apologies to anyone who might have been offended or hurt by what I wrote.  It was not at all my intention....  That said, allow me to invite you all to a little party to celebrate the end of another summer.  I will be moving back to BR this weekend, and because of the move, I want to enjoy one last night out in New Orleans with everyone.  Soooo, that said, the plan is to go to POC for about 730pm on Thursday night for some dinner and perhaps a Monsoon or two, and then we will go from there.  Maybe some gambling at Harrah's or some dancing at BBC or some drinking at Pat O's.  Let's see where the night takes us.  If you are interested, gimme a ring or drop me a line and I hope to see many of you tomorrow night!

      School starts in less than a week and I am starting to get a little nervous about it.  This semester will be so much different than any other I have been through, and as exciting as it is that I am so close to being done with my undergraduate experience and my days up at LSU in Baton Rouge, I guess it's all finally starting to hit me.  I mean, I am going to have to actually wake up at the crack of dawn 5 days a week and go to class refreshed and ready everyday.  I am suddenly going to be thrown from the college kid who can skip a few days, show up late, or wear pajamas to class to the teacher figure who must always be prompt, poised, and professional.  That is quite a change I am in store for!  I am still not ahead on the reading that I need to be ahead on.  I have finished half of a book for my English III class, and about half of a  book for my English IV class.  The good news is that one of the assigned books, Frankenstein, I have already read about 3 times, so I am good on that one as long as I refresh myself with Cliff before I get to that assignment.  I plan to get through the second half of Cat's Cradle for English IV by tomorrow and then pick up the pace.  The good news is that I know we will not be getting to the other books for a while, so I can in all honesty take that little extra time I need in the first week or two of classes.  In other academic news, my grad school application for UNO is completed.  I am starting to wonder if I am cheating myself by deciding on UNO, though.  I mean, I could probably get accepted to any number of colleges and universities in and out of Louisiana, so I am starting to question whether I should grab that opportunity while I have the chance.  Things would definitely be different if I did that, but I would probably come out better for having taken the chance.  More to come on that later....  Moving day back to BR will be this Saturday and my last day here at work will be Thursday.  I must admit that this has been a pretty good gig, I have a really fun and laid back boss who has made me laugh and I have learned a thing or two about life insurance.  It definitely was better here than it was at the hell hole nursery I started off the summer at.  The next step will be finding a job to get me through grad school....woe is me!  In CKI news, Summer Rally was pretty nice.  A very laid back and casual event, which I thought was a wise choice since everyone is getting back in the mind set of school.  I enjoyed spending time with old and new friends, but I swear to God, if I ever go there again, I am NOT taking a short cut to the movie theatre!    Cute Emily news....we were driving to go have dinner at R&O's last night and she asked me how long it would be before we got there....I said about 15 minutes.  She then wanted to know when it would be 15 minutes, and I said that she would have to count to 60 fifteen times.  Well she showed me....she did just that!  Can you even imagine??  123456789........woe is me.....

      Hello everyone and welcome to Thursday.  Normally Thursday would just be Thursday, but today is a special one because Bobby and I celebrate our 6 month anniversary today.  Can anyone believe we have made it that long without killing one another?  (Shut up, Eric) :)  Ok, so to prove that he is still as fantastic as he was 6 months ago, Bobby brought me six white roses on Tuesday.  Then he brought me six pink roses yesterday.  Then this morning, when I woke up, there were 6 more red roses waiting for me.  It was the sweetest and most romantic thing I think I have ever been privy to and it made me exceptionally happy.  Tonight we are going to Semolina for dinner which is where we had our first date.  We also went to Biloxi this past Sunday and stayed at Casino Magic for the night as a little early present to ourselves and one another.  We had a lovely time with our jacuzzi suite!  Moving from the mush, tomorrow I will embark on my first journey to Starkville, MS for LMT Summer Rally 2003.  It should be a pretty good time even if the registration numbers are a little low right now.  I am sure that it will all turn out fine and we will be doing a Habitat project, which I am excited about!  A big shout out to Justin who got a great job offer in Maryland...I wish you the best with that!  Well, I think that is about all from me for now, and I hope that everyone is doing well!  Catch you later guys!

Even though 2749 people scored higher than me on this and only 3 had lower scores than me, I am somewhat concerned that this is a positive number, I assumed I would be like -21% or something.  In any case, Florida sucks ass....GEAUX TIGERS! :)

      Happy monday everyone!  Well my weekend consisted of two great movies, one class reunion with an open bar, one seriously drunk boyfriend, and some good times.  Friday night, me and Bobby went on a triple date with my mom and dad and my sister and her boyfriend to dinner and then to the movies to see Seabiscuit.  It was a little slow, but a really good movie overall.  I definitely recommend that you all go and see it if you get the chance!  Saturday was moving day for Bobby's mom, so while he did all that, I went shopping with my mom and then met up with him for his reunion which was that night at Ernst Cafe.  It was a good time despite the fact that I didn't know anyone there.....I guess the open bar made up for it.  We all got plastered and then went to Harrah's for a little while.  Bobby was absolutely more drunk than any of us, which was fun to see since I had never really seen him get that tanked before.  He even handed me 20 bucks to hold for him at Harrah's (still not sure why I was holding it) and then I turn around and he had pulled out another 20 bucks to play with, having completely forgotten about the 20 he had handed me.  So I played with that 20 and he was like, Well, at least I only played with 20....to which I replied, Well....this is your 20 too.  :)  Sunday we recovered and then went to have lunch at my house....last night I had office hours....joy oh joy!  I am looking forward to Friday night when we take our little road trip to Nacitoches for Taryn's show and some good times out on the town!  Granted, it is not much of a town, but it's still going to be fun regardless.  And then the following weekend is Summer Rally and then I'll be moving back to Baton Rouge to start school again.  I am sooo ready for this last semester to be over with!  I can't believe that I will be graduating in December, it's such a surreal and incredible feeling.  Speaking of graduation, kudos to Eric and Justin who graduated on Friday.  I wish I could have been there for you guys, but I am proud nonetheless!  That's enough for me for now....peace out gang and until next time, remember that hampsters do not like to play parachute!

      Greetings, readers!  This weekend was spectacular, filled with tailgating, football, and spending time with those who mean the most to me.  Friday night Bobby came up to BR and I decided that I would try my hand at some cooking.  I made chicken and potatoes in an Italian dressing marinade, some broccoli with butter sauce, and of course, mac and cheese since Bobby swears that no meal is complete without it!  The good news is that we are both still alive, so I cannot be that bad of a cook.  Sat was the LSU-UGA game and ESPN was on campus for College Gameday.  As they advertise, LSU was the center of the college football universe, and it was pretty intense.  The crowd was HUGE, rowdy, and excited (not to mention drunk by 9am!)  So there was a good time, especially when Corso pulled out that Tiger Hat.  Imagine the noise!  That night set the biggest attendance record to date in Death Valley, which is also a really cool thing about this game.  Student tickets, which we buy for $7 were going for between $150 and $200 each!  Insanity I tell you, insanity...  After the game, the party was here, but it was more of a "it's so hot, I just want to sit on the floor in the AC and chill" more than anything atmosphere, which is cool with me!  Today, Bobby left me early to get home for the Saints...we will not get into a discussion on that game!  I started reviewing some more math for the GRE which I have to take on Tuesday.  I am soooo nervous about it all, especially the math since I have not had a math class in 4 years.  Yikes!  So wish me luck this week, especially on Tuesday.  I guess that is all for now, hope everyone has a great week!

      One of my English IV students brought in an interesting article from the newspaper this morning about a man who shipped himself as cargo on a cargo plane from his home in New York to his parents' doorstep in Texas.  Apparently, the man was homesick and wanted to see his parents, but did not have the money to afford a flight...so instead, he packaged himself into a crate (a task easy for him to do since he is a packaging clerk) and flew 15 hours to get to Texas.  When the crate was left at the doorstep, he pryed it open and popped out just in time for the delivery man to see him and call the police.  If you would like to read the story from CNN,  urlLink click here.   When you think about it, if the man would have waited 5 more minutes, he probably would have gotten off scott free with this.  Now there are two ways to see the story...the first is as something absolutely hysterical.  Think of it, a man flew in a crate to his parents house...the irony of him having waited and gotten away with it, and the true irony of the package delivery cashing in at $550.00....hello, how much does a plane ticket cost???  We can also look at it from a more serious standpoint...What does this say about security issues?  With the anniversary of 9-11 tomorrow, it is interesting to see that someone could sneak onto a cargo plane without being noticed, and then actually get out of his crate and walk around the plane while in flight.  What would have happened if this had been a terrorist?  He could easily have hijacked the plane and done some serious damage similar to what happened two years ago.  Kind of scary when you think of it from such a serious standpoint.  On the note of 9-11, I thought it would be interesting to be in the classroom for this anniversary, but instead, I will be attending a student teacher conference all day.  I think it's a shame that one of the most important days in our history I have to spend outside of the classroom...it would have been truly moving to see how students react to the memory of 9-11 in school tomorrow, to see what special programs and memorials will take place.    Today, some of my students helped make a bulletin board for the school hallway that looked like an American flag.  For the stars, they used paint pens to make 7000 dots...one to symbolize each lost life from that tragic day. I thought it was moving that they took the time to actually count and draw all those dots, and I think that many students will be moved tomorrow when they see the numerous dots on display in honor of those who lost their lives to terrorism.  I hope you each take a moment tomorrow to be grateful to be an American, and proud of the freedom we so often take for granted

      Welcome to Tuesday, everyone!  This post is in response to  urlLink Matt's rant  about the "opening of the first gay high school in New York."  First, I would like to take a moment to correct a few facts that Magnum Matty reported on his blog.    The idea of this high school intrigued me, so I decided to do a little further research on it, and what I found is that the school was actually founded in 1979.  It first opened to students in 1985.  The name of the school is the Harvey Milk School, and it is part of the Hetrick-Martin Institute in New York.  After doing some reading about it, I found that a lot of what Matt ranted about was premature ranting, done without knowing the basic facts of the school and the situation.  Let's examine the mission statement of the school, which says,   "The Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI) believes all young people, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, deserve a safe and supportive environment in which to achieve their full potential. HMI creates this environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth between the ages of 12 and 21 and their families.   Through a comprehensive package of direct services and referrals, HMI seeks to foster healthy youth development. HMI's staff promotes excellence in the delivery of youth services and uses its expertise to create innovative programs that other organizations may use as models."  So first things first, the school is not sexually segregating anyone...it accepts all students, regardless of sexual orientation, but is geared toward helping those students who may be confused about their sexuality achieve a learning environment that is healthy, happy and supportive of them.  Also, taken directly from the  urlLink school's website , "higher suicide rates, homelessness and health issues are basic primary needs and must be met regardless of a student's sexual orientation."  I think it is important to understand that the school is not specifically a gay high school, and is not just a hang-out for students who want to be liberal and flaunt their gay lifestyle...   In fact, a requirement of the admission to this institution is proof that the student is being harrassed and insulted to the point where he/she cannot learn properly and develop to the potential.  What is so wrong about taking a child out of a negative learning environment and putting him into a supportive one that will give him the chance that he deserves at a proper education?  Who has the right to say that this is such a terrible idea or that this school should not exist at all....what if that child was to stay at a mainstream school and be tortured and harrassed day to day?  Would they even finish school if that was the case?  Why shouldn't they have an alternative with a 95% graduation rate and a 60% college acceptance rate?  Just because they are gay or confused, or have health issues, or are suicidal, they do not deserve that chance?    Matt made the point that society does not accept homosexuality.  That's a tried and true fact of who we are and how we have all been taught to believe that homosexuality is wrong.  We are drilled with that belief in church, in school, pretty much everywhere we go.  That is something that no one person will ever be able to change.  And you don't have to accept it if you don't want to, you can continue to tolerate it and take a stand against those who want to change the way we think as a society.  But to attack a school that is doing so much for a community of students who otherwise might fall into the cracks or lose their chance to grow and learn, that to me is even more unacceptable than homosexuality will ever be.  I urge all of you to go to the  urlLink website  and look at some of the information.  See for yourselves that it is supported by the New York Dept of Education, or that it has changed the lives of thousands of students who have graduated from the school, or that since 1985, there has been no riot.    Yesterday, the school opened its doors to 100 students, the highest enrollment it has seen to date.  The result of this number was a 3.2 million dollar renovation just completed, and as 100 students walked through the doors of a school without fearing harrassment, ridicule, or abuse, only 10 people stood outside to protest.  I think those 10 people need to get over it and move on...  What do you think?

      Disclaimer:  This is not about the LA Home and Garden Show, the Saints, LSU football, or frogs...it is instead, a little deeper than usual...enjoy!  Kurt Vonnegut wrote that we should all live by the foma that make us brave and kind and happy and healthy.  Foma, by his definition, are harmless untruths.  Kind of interesting concept, isn't it?  He is basically telling us that we should believe in the simple lies in our lives if they are what make us happy.  He uses religion as his main foma in the novel this quote comes from, and it really starts to make you think.  Is religion all a lie?  Do we believe in it because it is what we have always been told to believe in, and it makes us feel better about ourselves?  If we had no religion, perhaps then we would have less purpose in life...we would have less meaning and how would we be then?  If you look at it on a broader scale, it can really raise some issues.  I thought about this quote and I started to think about abuse victims....maybe they believe that their lives, filled with abuse, are normal.  Perhaps they have convinced themselves of this as their own personal foma, and in believing that, they allow the cycle of abuse to continue.  What about children who get involved with drugs or alcohol.  Do they have a personal foma that if they participate in these things, they will be more accepted by their peers?  In believing this, they find happiness in acceptance, but they find that happiness at the risk of so much more.  So then I suppose your bottom line comes down to how do you define "harmless untruth".  Your definition of harmless may be different than mine....then do we all live by our own foma?  Do we make these things up in our heads, allowing for them to guide the way we act and think and live our lives?  Do our foma become intermingled with the foma of others around us?    And, perhaps the most pressing question from all of it...if we had no foma, would we continue to live our lives they way we do now, or would we completely change?  Maybe foma gives us meaning and purpose...or maybe Vonnegut was nuts.  Either way, tell me what you think.

      Hey everyone!  It's Wednesday night already, my how time does fly!  Tomorrow I will be team teaching 3 classes, so that is exciting for me.  I have been working hard getting the lesson plans together and coming up with some fun activities, so hopefully it will all work out for me.  And I just found out today that I have coach Nick Saban's son in my class.  I didn't even realize it until I saw the name Nick Saban on this kid's class activity.  Now the activity was to show people or places or events that influence who you are, so I glanced at it and thought that he had written Saban as an influence (thought he probably was a football player)  Low and behold, that was actually just his name!  I was quite surprised and amused...I really need to learn these names soon!  I also met my university coordinator today.  He was a really nice guy and seems to be pretty easy going about everything.  He's also pretty young so that is refreshing since all the other ones were like 45-50 years old....it's just nice to have a younger person who is more fresh to the teaching world I guess.  I think it will work better for me that way.  That about sums up my life for now...it's been slow with just going to school all day, everyday.  This afternoon, I was so exhausted that I came home and passed out for about two hours.  Since then, I have just been surfing and checking out blogs.  Bobby has a link to Abbie Alsene's blog (she's a newly-elected International Trustee) so I stole her quiz about Saved by the Bell...I just had to!  So everyone go take it and let me know what you get!    Kelly Kapowski... Though you are not told by many... people really look up to you and find your spunk and smiley attitude refreshing. You might come from a tough backround, but you don't let that affect the way you live your life. Everyone thinks the world of you, but no one holds that against you.    urlLink   Which Saved By The Bell Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Hello everyone and welcome back from a long and relaxing holiday weekend!  So what's new this week??  LSU won this weekend, as we all knew they would.  I mean, UL-Monroe sucks...what more is there to say?  This weekend I had the extreme honor of going to my first Frog Festival held in the frog capital of the world, Rayne, LA!  It was everything froggy from arts and crafts to live frogs to pictures with frogs to eating fried frog (if you're into that sort of thing, which I am not)  Bobby, Lisa and Brian were in my company for the festivities.  We also tried to go to the Shrimp and Petroleum Festival in Morgan City, but the rain just did not want us there.  We went there first in the morning and it was pouring....so we went to Rayne and decided to double back on the way home.  We get there and it is pretty nice, the weather has calmed down and all, so we get out.  We walk around the little park for a while, then all of a sudden, the skies open up on us.  We made a run for it to the car, but by the time we got there, we were all completely drenched.  Despite the weather, it was fun and the Frog Festival will now be an annual event for my calendar!!!  Other than that, not too much went on this weekend.  I went to Treasure Chest Casino with Bobby last night and lost 10 bucks.  I guess my winning streak took a bite last night...but I am still way up!  And as a public service announcement, if any of you ever talk about going to that god-awful casino again, I vow today and forever to talk you out of it!  Way too many people and not enough machines, and the people who were there were just trashy.  Now, if you are drunk when you go, it might be ok.  That about wraps it up for me today.  I begin week two of teaching tomorrow and I will actually get to do my lesson this week on Gilgamesh, so I am excited about that!  Wish me luck and I hope you all have a great week!

      Hey everyone!  So let's recap what has been going on lately...  Well, Tioga was this past weekend and it was an adventure!  Everything went really well and everyone there seemed to have a great time.  Penny Wars were interesting, and I was really grateful to get as much help in counting as I did over the weekend.  I was so proud of Bobby the whole time, he pulled things together and everything worked out great.  He absolutely deserved his surprise award at closing session after all the work he put into it.    Teaching is going great...this week has been my first full time week, which means that I have taught all day everyday for the past 3 days and will continue tomorrow and Friday.  Sadly, my mentor teacher's father passed away last week, so I had the opportunity to really test myself with the kids alone.  I continued with my lesson plans with the supervision of a substitute teacher, and it all went pretty well.  I feel more and more confident that this is really what I want to do as the days go by.  It just really makes me smile to hear the kids say "Hey Ms. P" or "Hey Ms Green" (They seem to have trouble putting it all together)  Then there is Ryan who insists on calling me Ms Green-Pea...how funny, right?  This weekend I will be going to New Orleans to see Bobby and the family.  Friday will be a catch up with myself night.  I think it's going to be a Blockbuster night at Hotel Minnesota and an early to bed night too.  Saturday I am going to see SNOOPY on stage and then Bobby and I will be going to Fright Fest at Six Flags, and Sunday is a day to sleep late as far as I am concerned!  Next week is the big Hotel Minnesota Halloween Bash.  I am preparing my costume as we speak and I think it will be an event to remember.  My mom even called me to tell me she got me a monster mug to drink out of...yes, my mom bought me a drinking glass.  Well I guess that is about all that I have going on for now.  Next week is Teacher Recruitment Day, and I successfully scheduled interviews with the 4 school districts I am most interested in working for, so we shall see how that goes.  I guess that is all for my update today, tune in later this week for more!

      Well, I decided that I would go ahead and sign up for this E-Harmony stuff since it's the new hip thing to do...what happens when I get to the end of this zillion question quiz that gives me a headache...nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  It appears that I too, like Sean, am unmatchable.  Here are my results:   eHarmony is based upon a complex matching system developed through extensive testing of married individuals. One of the requirements for it to work successfully is for participants to fall into our rigorously defined profiles. If we aren't able to match a user well using these profiles, the most considerate approach is to inform them early in the process.  We are so convinced of the importance of creating compatible matches to help people establish and enjoy happy, lasting relationships that we choose not to provide service rather than risk an uncertain match.  Unfortunately, we are not able to make our profiles work for you. Our matching system is not suitable for about 20% of potential users, so 1 in 5 people simply would not benefit from our service. We hope that you understand that we regret our inability to provide service for you at this time.    Wow...I am kind of shocked by it all.  Especially since my own boyfriend is in their system and we did not match up (Point for Bacon)  Kind of interesting when you think about it...any comments?

      Happy Monday!  The weekend was pretty good, I spent some time helping prepare for Tioga, got to go out Saturday night, and saw the Saints actually win a game live on Sunday.  This week will be quick and busy as I try to get all my lesson plans in and ready to go for next week since we have TIOGA this weekend and I will not be able to do much work.  My students are off on Friday because it is the school records day, so I will be leaving there and heading to Tioga around noon.  I am excited about the weekend and I think it will be a good one for everyone who attends.  I am very proud of Bobby for all the work he has done to organize and get everything in order for the event.  In other news, I will be interviewing for jobs at the end of the month and I bought a cap and gown and graduation announcements recently.  It's all coming together now which is both scary and exciting.  I feel more and more like a teacher everyday and I love it more and more everyday as well.  The kids always seem to leave me with a smile on my face and that is a true reward in itself.  Well, I hope everyone has a great week...more to come later (maybe!) :)

      Yeah, it's been a while.  Sorry, but I have been swamped.  I just wanted to share the following which my mom emailed to me.  Take a look and enjoy!  The Teacher  After being interviewed by the school administration, the eager  Teaching prospect said: "Let me see if I've got this right. You want me to go into that room with all those kids, and fill their every waking moment with a love for learning. And I'm supposed to instill a sense of pride in their ethnicity, modify their disruptive behavior, observe them for signs of abuse and even censor their T-shirt messages and dress habits.  "You want me to wage a war on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases,  check their backpacks for weapons of mass destruction, and raise their self esteem. You want me to teach them patriotism, good citizenship, sportsmanship, fair play, how to register to vote, how to balance a checkbook, and how to apply for a job.  "I am to check their heads for lice, maintain a safe environment,  recognize signs of antisocial behavior, offer advice, write letters of  recommendation for student employment and scholarships, encourage respect for the cultural diversity of others, and oh, make sure that I give the girls in my class fifty percent of my attention.  "My contract requires me to work on my own time after school, evenings  and weekends grading papers. Also, I must spend my summer vacation at my own expense working toward advance certification and a Masters degree. And on my own time you want me to attend committee and faculty meetings, PTA meetings, and participate in staff development training.   "I am to be a paragon of virtue, larger than life, such that my very presence will awe my students into being obedient and respectful of authority. And I am to pledge allegiance to family values and this  current administration.   "You want me to incorporate technology into the learning experience,  monitor web sites, and relate personally with each student. That includes deciding who might be potentially dangerous and/or liable to commit a crime in school.   "I am to make sure all students pass the mandatory state exams,even  those who don't come to school regularly or complete any of their  assignments. Plus, I am to make sure that all of the students with handicaps get an equal education regardless of the extent of their mental or physical handicap. And I am to communicate regularly with the parents by letter, telephone, newsletter and report card.   "All of this I am to do with just a piece of chalk, a computer, a few  books, a bulletin board, a big smile AND on a starting salary that qualifies my family for food stamps!   "You want me to do all of this and yet you expect me. . . .NOT TO  PRAY?"  Any comments? :)

      This is probably one of the few posts you will see from me until December.  Tomorrow, after a half day at school, my students will take off for the playoffs in Funroe, and I will be heading out to Eagle Ridge for a board meeting.  Saturday, I will return home and that night, I am going out with Ms. Shannon and company for her bachelorette party.  Sunday I have no big plans, but will probably sleep rather late and just be lazy.  Then I have an entire week off of school for Thanksgiving!  And it could not have come at a better time...the semester has been great, but it is indeed time for a break.  And once I go back, I will have only 7 more days of student teaching to finish!  Things are not so well with my grandfather.  He looks good, but his Xrays are telling a different story, and on top of that, he is getting grumpy and sad and Thanksgiving is fast approaching, and we will all be very sad if he is not at home for that.  So, continue to pray for him and I hope you all have a happy and blessed Thanksgiving.

      It rained all day today.  Absolutely gross outside.  What was worse is this morning, after very little sleep due to an unscheduled trip to the emergency room, I had to walk to school without an umbrella.  The one that I stole from Candace (yes, Candace, I still have it) I had left at school a few weeks ago and the cheap one I got at the dollar store I had lent to Amie.  Well, since Amie was at the ER until 230am, I felt bad waking her up to get it.  Then I realized, I took her to the ER, so she should not complain toooo much that I want my umbrella to walk two blocks in the torrential rain that was going down.  So I got the umbrella, still got drenched (read, dollar store umbrellas are not worth a dollar) and went on with my day.  Kids at school are rowdy because the football team won their first play-off game.  This Friday, they travel to Monroe to play Sterlington High School.  As a result, school dismisses at noon.  Very sweet since I have a board meeting and need to be in Eagle Ridge by 445pm.  DaVinci is getting close to the end now.  I know it's been a week since I started, but I have been quite busy and not able to devote as much time to it as I would have liked.  I have 100 pages left, which I hope to finish by tomorrow.  One of the most interesting things about the book is that a lot of what it is based on is factual, and so the ideas of the symbolism in art and even in current movies rings true.  It was fascinating to read about The Lion King and The Little Mermaid in the book, as well as about some paintings that I had to look up and take a closer look at to see the truth.  And since the brotherhood in the book indulges in the feminine goddess, a lot of the ideas and symbols and things we just consider male/female are spelled out with their origins.  The book even talks about a sex ritual where men and women wear these masks, and I started thinking to myself that must have been what was going on in Eyes Wide Shut...and suddenly, a movie that I hated when I first saw it, started to make some sense.  Weird how those things can come together.  As far as the election goes, I cannot say that I am not surprised that Blanco won.  I voted for the woman, but I really thought Jindal had it.  I won't get into that too much here, I have left my comments with Matt and Bacon already, so we will just move on.  Funny story of the day, which relates to election time.  My 5 year old niece plays little league soccer for a league that is sponsored by a company called Boasso America.  They were scheduled to play a tournament on Saturday at a middle school which also serves as a voting station in Meraux.  Walter Boasso was on the ballot.  Long story short, someone filed a suit that it was unacceptable for the kids to play soccer with Boasso American written on the shirts because it was campaigning on the grounds of a voting station.  So the 5 year olds had to postpone the tournament.  Gotta love the hysteria of the American legal system.  In other news, I would appreciate if everyone could keep my grandfather in their thoughts and prayers this week.  He has been in the hospital for two weeks now with pnemonia and something called psedumonia (Lauren, if I am spelling these wrong, I am sorry).  The latter of the two is some infection in the lungs that mocks pnemonia, or something like that.  Anyway, he is feeling ok, but he is not well and has not been for a while now.  So if you could just keep him in your thoughts this week, I would appreciate it.  Hopefully, he will be out for Thanksgiving.  And finally, a happy birthday shout out to Lauren! :)

      Today, I love my students.  One of them had checked out the library's only copy of The DaVinci code last week, and when I walked into the classroom this morning, it was sitting on my desk waiting for me.  He had finished it over the weekend, checked it back in and checked it out for me!  How sweet was that?  So I am now involved in my reading, and 40 pages into it, it is very very good!  One other story I want to mention...Saturday while Bobby and I were at the mall, we ran into one of my English I students.  She was shopping with her mom and she sees me and says, "Oh, Ms. Pellegrine, what are you doing here?"  I reply "Shopping."  This is not an acceptable answer, so she says, "Yeah, but what else?"  As if I have to have an ulterior motive to be at the mall.  It was interesting because it was my first real encounter with a student seeing me out of the classroom doing something non-academic.  I can only imagine she was thinking, "Wait, Ms Pellegrine actually has a life?  She actually goes to the mall to shop on the weekends?"  Funny to think that at one point in my life, I would have thought the same thing had I seen a teacher out of school.  Full circle, so they say.  Anyway, more to follow on DaVinci as I read, Amanda, you need to hurry your order along so we can discuss it together!!  That is all for now, have a good night!

      Well, Amanda said it best, the carbs did the trick.  U High defeated St Helena 45-12 Friday night, and it was a pretty good game to watch.  Bobby was planning to post some observations from the game, but here are a few I have to share.  1.  The concession stand was the most ineptly run concession stand I have ever seen.  About 65 people working, and not one of them doing a god damn thing.  It took me about 15 minutes to get a diet coke and a bag of M&M's.   2.  The band has a cynical sense of humor.  After the homecoming court presentation, they started pumping out the song, Back to Reality.  You know it, back to life...back to reality. 3.  The dance team had very little with-it-ness.  They had cute uniforms and tried some ghetto fabulous booty=shaking moves.  I know Bobby has much more to say about this one, so I will just leave it at that and you can consult his blog for further details.    Sat night was their Homecoming dance, and although one of my juniors asked me to go with him, I respectfully declined the invitation.  I am sure there will be stories to follow about this one...  After the game, we headed to Coffee Call for some hot chocolate since it was the coldest it has been since last Christmas around here.  And then we went to Late Night LSU in the Union.  This was a fun experience.  It was a student-run free event (this committee does them every month or so) and there were personality tests, arts and crafts, battle of the bands, a dj, and other activities.  So we did some of that and then headed home.  Sat was pancake and car wash day for CKI and then Bobby and I went shopping, then went to Sean's for a little while.  That night we saw Runaway Jury after a homemade steak dinner....it was all very good.  Today I got my honor cords for graduation.  This was a nice ceremony and my parents came up for it.  We had an awful chicken dinner and me and several other graduating seniors from the college of education got our honor cords.  It felt really good to finally have them around my neck.  It is so scary and so exciting to think that I have 17 more days of student teaching and then I will be a week away from graduation.    This week is like any other...lesson plans, meetings, and an attempt at some fun on the side.  As for the weekend, not sure what will be going on...I guess we will see when it gets here!  Have a good week, everyone!

      Just a quick one to tell you about one of the most ironic things I have seen in a while.  This week at U High, it's Homecoming.  So the cheerleaders and dance team members have this spirit thing that they all have one football player and every day this week, that girl brings the player a present.    Well, on Monday, they brought them homemade brownies.  On Tuesday, they baked them cookies.  Today they got a dozen donuts.  My mentor teacher looks at me and says, "You know, with all the sugar and sweets and carbohydrates that they pump into their bodies this week, it's no wonder we always lose Homecoming."  I thought that was hysterical...

      The DaVinci Code is all the rave in the world of blogging, and I could not be more thrilled about it!  I just finished the book I was reading today, so I can finally move into this one...sad news is I went to 3 different libraries looking for it today and could not find it on the shelf in any of them.  Woe is me.  I hope to get my hands on a copy very soon...that and the new Grisham book and the Jack the Ripper book by Patricia Cornwell.  Good thing I am an English teacher and get 15-20 minutes of silent reading per class per day!    And speaking of teaching, thanks to those who responded to my questions about service learning and requirements for service in the classroom.  The reason I asked (and I was going to wait until the end of the week, but I feel like writing, so deal!) is that my freshmen class is just beginning a unit on social responsibility.  I decided to try my hand at a service learning unit because it is an idea and philosophy that quite honestly intrigues me.  For those of you who may not know what service learning is, it is an educational philosophy that incorporates a classroom learning experience with an ongoing service project that addresses the needs of the community.  Allow me to give you a little background about where I teach.  I teach at University High School.  It is the LSU Lab School and is an institution attended by children of very well-to-do families in the BR community.  On my class roster, the names Saban, Moreau, and Kleinpeter all appear.  These kids sign golf contracts with LSU and leave student council meeting early to go to golf practice.  They drive nicer cars than I will ever drive, have houses in BR, Brazil and New York, and have all at one point in time taken ballroom dancing.  The school is also one of the few schools in the area that supports an IB curriculum.  The IB program is another story in and of itself, and another post in the near future...let me get back to service learning for now.  Just consider that service and service learning are a big part of the IB program and that all of these students are mandated to perform community service hours every year.  So the unit we are doing is on social responsibility.  Given that these kids have some exposure to community service, and that the school is supportive of service learning, and that it is right before Thanksgiving, and that I am absolutely intrigued and am an advocate of the service learning theory, I decided to design my unit as such.  We started the 3 week unit today with an overview.  Thursday we will learn about media and propaganda techniques and begin discussing persuasive ideas to promote our big class service project which will be a campus-wide food drive the week before Thanksgiving.  As a class, we will advertise and promote the food drive and set goals for how much food we want to raise.  We will also study literature that relays themes of poverty, hunger, and homelessness.  In addition, I am requiring each student to do 2 hours of individual volunteer work and to write a reflection about the experience.  Some people have loved this idea, others have not.  Many come from the standpoint that service should never be required and it dehumanizes the meaning of serving if we are doing it as a requirement.  My take on that as an educator is if I do not expose these kids to service, and do not lead them to see how it relates to their lives, would they ever get that warm fuzzy feeling or do it for the right reasons on their own?  Is it so wrong to want to lead them there, show them what it is, and then let them decide if it's right for them to do on their own?  Consider this: If an elementary school teacher never forced her students to write their alphabet or read books, would those kids grow up willing to read and write and able to see how it is important?    Some of you are rolling your eyes and thinking that is waaaaaay too much of a stretch, and that is fine.  My point is what's wrong with leading them there if it helps them grow and learn as students and as members of our society?

      Well I hope everyone out there had a great Halloween.  Mine was spent at the Hotel Minnesota party with friends, and it was a good time.  To date, it has been reported that there were 3 separate party-goers who ended up worshipping the porcelain god after the party ended.  Yes, I was one of them...  In other news, I went to the DLS game with Bobby and Ted Sat night, which was an embarassment even to me and I didn't go to DLS.   They got shut out 26-0.  Good times!  Thanks to Ted and Amanda for the pre-game bbq though, that was indeed spectacular!  Today Bobby and I went and had lunch with my parents and then we went to this Arts and Crafts Expo at the Pontchartrain Center.  And before any of you men start with your "that's so gay, who is he...Matt" comments, consider it a trade-off.  I went to the game, he went to the show.  Fair is fair, right?  Anyway, so we are walking around and we come to this little exhibit that has these personalized signs you can get with different designs.  One of the sample items is a picture of a football game with a scoreboard in the background.  The two teams playing are USM and MSU.  The score is being changed to USM 27, MSU 21 and the name inscribed on the bottom is Bobby.  It was fate, so he had to buy the keychain version of it.  I am now 22 school days away from finishing as an undergrad!  I went and had some interviews with 4 separate school districts last week, and all of them went really really well.  I am in the process of mailing in resumes, cover letters, transcripts, and applications as we speak.  My UNO app is also finally finished and I will be sending that off tomorrow.  I have pretty much decided to go to grad school part time and work my way through it.  Hopefully I will be able to land a teaching job in January, but if not, I will just look for something else to get me through August.  I have no doubt that come August, I will be in a classroom of my own and settling in for my first full year of teaching.  If I get lucky and it happens for January, it will be just that much better.  As a result of this decision to "grow up" I am officially announcing that this will be my final year of CKI.  It has been fun, but I think it's time to give it up and move on.  Kiwanis is in my future definitely, but not for a few years I think.  I look forward to being a member of UNO in the spring, but after that, it's going to be time to get out for me.    I guess that is about all that is going on.  I do want to throw out a question to any readers, though...just to get an idea of how ppl think.  The question is, well there are two questions: 1.  Do you believe that it is ok for schools to have requirements for service hours?  (Ie, you have to do so many service hours to pass the grade).  2.  Do you agree or disagree with the idea of teachers doing service learning projects in their classrooms?  Please also explain why or why not you agree with these things!  I will let you all know why I am asking at the end of the week!  Thanks and have a great week!

      Well gang, it's been a week since I moved back home and I have spent that time getting into the swing of things over at Chalmette Middle.  I have gone everyday this week to meet with teachers, administrators, and to observe the children...and I still feel a little anxious about the whole thing.  Mainly because I have still not gotten a teacher's manual or handbook of any sort.    Oh, and get this.   I have been assigned to take over sponsorship of the CMS Flag Team.  Anyone who wants to march with me and the flag team during MArdi Gras, please let me know.  Anyone who wants to come and laugh at me, please also let me know and be sure that you have a drink waiting for me at the end of the route!  In other news, tomorrow is my graduation ceremony at 230pm in the Maddox Fieldhouse on LSU's campus.  I will be going up to Baton Rouge  early that morning with family and friends to have lunch at Mike Anderson's and then we will head to the ceremony.  I am very excited about it and looking forward to the day.  That night, Bobby and I are going to Paul's graduation at UNO and then to a party one of my friends is having in Arabi.  Saturday I will hopefully be moving things into my new classroom....which is very very lovely, I might add.  It's big and modern since it is in a new building, so I am excited about that.  That night Bobby and I are doing Christmas in the Oaks and another party and Sunday, who knows.  Disney World countdown is at 9 days...I can't wait!  Hope to see you guys soon and if not, Happy Holidays!

      Welcome back from a fun weekend, everyone!  First off, an update about me and my new job.  Since I have been offered a job starting in January, I have decided to take a semester off of school in the spring.  Now, as many of you know, if I am not in school, that means I am not in CKI.  Not being a member of CKI, I will also no longer be able to continue with my position as district secretary/treasurer.  I have officially decided to resign effective December 19.  This was not an easy decision, as I feel awful leaving a commitment without seeing it the entire way through, and in addition, leaving a board that already faces two vancancies.  What made the decision easier was knowing that I could give up the position and give my all to my beginning career, or I could keep it and do a half-ass job at both.  In the end, this is what is best for myself and for the district.  Hopefully someone will be able to step up and carry out the sec/treas duties until DCON, and if not, the board will just have to work a little harder to stay on top of that administrative end of things.  Either way, I am confident that the district is better off with my resignation.  Now this does not mean that I am done with the K Family, nor does it mean that I am done with school.   I plan to become involved as a faculty sponsor for the CMS Builders Club and am considering possible membership to a Kiwanis club either this spring or this summer.  I also will begin taking graduate courses at UNO this summer to pursue my Master of Arts in English Teaching.    And speaking of teaching, today was my last day with my English III classes, and tomorrow will be my official last day at University High School.  On Wednesday, I will attend a seminar and turn in my end of semester paperwork, and then I will be waiting for my commencement ceremony on the 19th.    With that said, I also have a party announcement.  This Saturday, December 13, there is talk of an outing to Margaritaville and then going out downtown.  Not sure of times or what other places this will involve, but that is what I know.  Think of it as an end of the year finale.  That is also the date of Ms. Shannon's wedding, so I will have to wing my own attendance based on that.  Perhaps we can get a group together to go out on the 19th?  Any fellow graduates (or anyone else) up for a night out?  Let me know...

      A special thanks to those of you who were able to attend the services held yesterday for my grandfather, it was greatly appreciated.  If you are a believer in the circle of life concept, then you know that with every end comes a new beginning.  Such is true here also...just as my grandfather passed away, I was offered a teaching position at a middle school in St. Bernard.  I will be teaching seventh grade English starting in January.  I am very excited that the job came my way and it was too great of an opportunity to pass up, so I will be venturing into the working world soon enough.  More news to come in the next few days, so have a good weekend and check back next week for some more updates.  Until then, remember that snow can also be spelled sneaux (just ask the kids at the LSU Lab School!)

      Hey guys  Just a post to say that I am sorry if you have tried to catch me this past week and have not gotten a return call/email/etc.  My grandfather has been very sick this week and he passed away this morning around 130am.  Please keep him and my family in your prayers.  Thanks to all of you who have been there for me, especially Bobby.  I am very lucky to have such good friends.  Take care until next time.

      I was just waiting to see how long it would take before someone called me a slacker before I would post again.  Seriously, I should be grading papers, but I am not motivated at this time to do so.  Teaching is going well and I am learning a lot, both about my profession and myself.  There is a lot of stuff happening differently than I expected, and that kid who pushed me yesterday threw me for a loop...but I guess I will just have to keep on keeping on.  Life is pretty uneventful for now.  I work everyday and am just adjusting to being home and being out of school.  I am exploring what happens next as far as school and career and I guess I will eventually figure it out.  No big plans for the weekend...will probably end up at Eric's for the Superbowl, but I don't really know for sure what will happen.  Anyway, just a quick update so you all know I am alive.  I hope everyone is doing well.

      Happy Mardi Gras, everyone!  Sadly, the weather in New Orleans is rainy and humid and just plain yucky.  I am just taking it easy today and hanging out with Bobby while some of you are out there getting wet and catching coconuts!  In MG spirit, I'd like to announce that I am planning to ride next year with the Metairie Krewe of Isis.  A friend of mine from high school called me last night to see if I wanted to ride with her and her sisiter and another girl we graduated with.  So I hope all of you will come out to Isis.    That's all from Mardi Gras morning, hope everyone has a great one!

      Well American Idol was disappointing this week.  The group of 8 that performed last night was pretty rotten, but my favorite girl got through.  I like Camille a lot because she is real...she is young and talented and humble.  She seems like someone who you could really know in life.  I think Lisa got robbed not getting through, but Matt is a cutie, so at least we get to see him some more!  I give my first exam tomorrow, I really hope that these kids are ready to take this test.  I feel nervous because I know that they do not tend to study very much, and it is such a long test, I know they will get mad and annoyed and start slacking.  I guess we will see how they do and learn from that.  Friday starts the MG2K4 fun and I cannot wait!    Quiz Time    Your: Happy eyes! Your cheerfull, bright and always want to try something new. Your inquisitive and quite lovable. You have many friends and will succseed in life.    urlLink   What type of eyes do you have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well, Mardi Gras has officially begun and I have sore muscles to prove it!  Last night, I had the pleasure of marching with the Chalmette Middle School Flag Team in the Centurion Parade in Metairie.  This must be the longest parade ever.  Just when you thought you were gaining ground, they had you loop around side streets...it was crazy.  But, the 7 girls and I made it with the only hitch being a "sprained" wrist.  A few notes on the parade...in front of several of my students and their parents, I had a drunk young man grab my ass and say "Hey sexy, come here so I can give you some beads!"  My girls were appalled and the parents were none too happy either.  Good times.  Second, Metairie people do not respond well to Chalmations marching in their parades.  Now by what I am about to say, I mean no offense to my Metairie friends (or boyfriend) but last night affirmed why I will never want to live in Metairie.  All we heard were comments like "Where are your shrimp boots?"  or "Go back to the bayou and practice you Chalmations!"  Such class I tell you.  This week is exam week at CMS, so the kids are testing and studying like crazy.  Friday I get to march in a little neighborhood parade with the flag team during the day and that night, Bobby and I will be joining some of my Chalmette friends for Aphrodite in da parish.  Sat is Krewe of Kubs and Endymion, and it's all out from then on.  I hope everyone has a great Mardi Gras and ifyou want to meet up, give me a ring and I will let you know where we will be!  Laissez les bon temps roullez!

      Welcome to another Monday, everyone.  I know I've been a bit of a slacker lately, but with this whole full time job in the real world thing going on, I have been a little busy.  I finally got my website password, so now when you visit the Chalmette Middle website, you can click on my name to find current and updated information.  Pretty good that it only took me a little over a month to get a 7 letter password, huh?  Outside of school, life has also been busy.  Juggling the CMS flag team and getting in gear to take over the CMS Builder's Club have left me at school pretty late about 3 days a week and grading papers is not as easy as you may think it is.  I am very much looking forward to the Mardi Gras holidays and then moving into state test week to get through the rest of the nine weeks.  This week (and into the weekend) I would like to wish a few people Happy Anniversary.  Beth and Justin, Lisa and Eric, and me and Bobby all celebrate our anniversaries this week.  So congrats to all of us!  As far as Mardi Gras goes, Bobby and I will be catching Pontchartrain on Valentine's Day before he flies to Orlando for work.  I have to march on Sunday in Metairie and that will be all for me until the 20th.  I march again on the 20th in Chalmette, and then after that, I have 3 days off and a lot of drinking to do!  In March, I will be attending the CKI DCON.  This was a hard decision for me because of the situation with having to resign from my position, but I decided that I wanted to support the district and the board all the way through.  I know it will be tough to think about how I worked on the board for 9 months and get no credit for it, but I guess the only true credit comes from giving something all you have and hoping you made a difference somewhere along the way.  I wish that I had some part of the activities, but I guess I had my chance and it was not meant to be.  I do look forward to watching the 04-05 board get elected and I hope that the alumni association gets something accomplished.    Well, school starts early so I gotte get some rest.  Have a great week, everyone!

      Today's talk:  VooDoo, Crawfish, Getting Lei'd, and Blanco   I think I have become a VooDoo fan.   We went to the game last night and had a great time.  They had so much energy and the team was actually really good--and they won!  If you have not had the pleasure of attending a game, I strongly advise you to do so.  There are a few more games left of the season, and I know Bobby and I plan on going to one or two in May.   So about the crawfish boil ...Due to the fact that we were hearing complaints and not so nice comments about asking people to chip in for the feast, we have cancelled the event.  Unfortunately, Bobby and I are not wealthy enough to pay for everyone to eat crawfish and drink beer until they drop, and since that was a problem for some people, we decided to cancel the event rather than deal with the drama.    We are still hosting a party on April 3 to kick off at 8pm.  The theme is  Hotel Minnesota Gets Lei'd  and we will be celebrating Hawaiin style.  Come in your grass skirts, leis, and flip flops for some fun.  There will be beer, soft drinks, chips, dips, and assorted liquor and mixers.  I will also be cooking some jambalaya (true Hawaiin dish, huh?)  If there is something you really want, bring it along.  We are asking everyone (as always) to bring a little something to share with everyone.    A note on Blanco...she is a lying bitch.  Let me just put it to you like this, I am a teacher and my father is a firefighter.  The raises we were promised have been brushed away, yet she somehow found money to give herself a raise.  Imagine the hatred coming from this house!  That is all I have to say about her.  Hope to see you all Saturday night!

      Hardly recognized me, huh?  I've made some obvious changes around the site.  I was inspired by the really cute design that Amanda and Bobby found for the LMT Alumni site so I checked out maystar.com and found this one.  Somehow, I sat here for a good while and fooled around with it enough to change colors, add links, and really like what I came up with.  I am just not sure what happened to the archives...they may be lost forever!  Anyone know?  Hope you all like...tell me what you think!

      Exciting things are happening...  Following a fun trip to Memphis, life has gotten back to normal for me.  I felt a lot of closure at DCON this year.  Many of you know that I had mixed feelings about attending as I had to resign from my position with only 3 months remaining of my term.  I know that it was for the best, but I really wanted to fulfill my commitment and I was not able to.  I enjoyed the convention because I got to participate in some officer training and facilitate the pie auction, and the board honored me with a Past District Secretary-Treasurer pin, which I totally did not expect.  I was so surprised and moved by it, I actually cried.  And yes, someone out there has a picture of it.  Aside from DCON, Memphis had BBQ, Beale Street, and of course, Graceland.  We had a blast doing it all.  As far as exciting news for the summer I got a job offer at Summer Discovery, which is a huge arts enrichment summer camp run by the St Bernard School Board.  It basically operates like a school, the kids come in from 8am-4pm and they choose 5-7 "classes" to take each day.  The classes range from dancing to sports to theatre to creative writing.  The way staffing works is you submit a proposal for a class and if they accept it and have room for you (and you are a certified teacher in the parish) you may or may not get an offer.  I was offered the opportunity to teach one journalism class from 10-12 and then 3 creative writing classes from 1-4.  So I will be working 10-4 everyday and possibly doing after care from 4-6 a few days a week for some extra hours.  I am really very excited about this!  In other news, my bday is a week from Thursday.  As a reminder, Bobby and I are having a joint bday celebration in the form of a crawfish boil followed by a Hotel Minnesota party.  The boil starts at 3pm and the party ends when we run out of alcohol and are all too drunk to go to the store to buy more!!  There is even talk of a homemade Magnum...so be sure to check  it out!  Oh and for those who do not like/cannot eat seafood, we will have something else for you to munch on...no worries!  Because we are all young and poor, we will be asking for everyone to contribute to the cost of the crawfish boil.  Right now the rate is set at $15 each and includes all the crawfish you can eat, all the soft drinks and beer you can drink, and other food and beverages for the party that night.  Depending on attendance and prices, it could vary, but that would be the top dollar we would ask.  If you have questions or concerns about anything, let me know!  Have a good night!

      Welcome to Tuesday morning, guys and dolls.  Today I am at home because I have some sort of a stomach bug or food poisoning or something that has caused me to be sick since about 430am.  There was no way I was going to school throwing up every 30 minutes, so I had to use a sick day.  Since I am home, and starting to feel a little refreshed, I figured now would be a good time to update what has been going on for all you dedicated readers.  This past weekend I traveled to Baton Rouge to visit with LSU CKI and attend the BS Rally and the LSU Dance.  Both were a pretty good time, and Bobby and I won first place in the costume contest for our "Googly Eyes" outfits.  The theme was Black and White, and there were some fun costumes and outfits.  The idea was really cute and exacuted well through B&W M&M's, Oreo's, Zebra cakes and other cute food ideas of the like.  The rally was earlier that day and it was good to see some faces I had not seen in a while.  I felt a little weird being back in the scene, so after the rally, me, Candace, Erin and Ryan hit the Chimes and then we went to a park to hang out.  It was great to see Erin again and Ryan and to just hang out and have a fun, stress-free afternoon.  After the dance, Bobby and I headed back to Metairie so we could rest up since we had tickets to the Harlem Globetrotters on Sunday.  This was a really fun show and I would absolutely go again if I had the chance.  Thanks tons to Matty who got the tickets to us!  This weekend Bobby has an old friend coming into town on Saturday, so we will be playing tourist and doing Port of Call.  Friday and Sunday are up in the air.  Then next weekend is DCON in Memphis.  We'll be leaving Friday morning and we'll probably go see the ducks at the Peabody, grab some dinner and check out Beale Street.  Sat we are registered for convention, so we will be there all day, and Sunday we head out after we tour Graceland.  I am really looking forward to the whole adventure!  Well that's all for now...hope to see many of you in Memphis!

      The first time I went to a dance club, I was 18 years old and out of high school.  I went with my friends on one of their 18th bdays.  Well, nowadays in the parish, you no longer need to be 18 to go clubbin!  Introducing  The Zone Teen Dance Club .  Let me give you the run down:  -This place is open on weekends to 12-18 year olds.  Yes, you read that correctly.  If you are at a loss for words, let me give you two...statutory rape.  How can anyone think that a setting where 12-18 year olds mingle is a good or wholesome setting?  -They have what they call "The Zone Bus".  Now for those parents who want to allow their kids to go to this place (ie, a babysitter for 6 hours for only $10) there is an option where they do not even have to pick them up.  They can drop them off, and for the $10, the 12-18 year olds get pizza, coke, and a ride on the Zone bus.    -And now, they are advertising Summer Camp!  Wow.  I always thought that summer camp was to get kids to go outside and try new things and do summer like stuff.  Apparently, at the Zone, summer camp is all about karaoke, dancing, pool tables, movies, arts and crafts, and field trips on Fridays.  Want to know more?  Check them out  urlLink here  and tell me what you think.  Would you let your children go to this place?  Is it just me?  Oh, and if you check out the picture gallery, you are sure to be looking at a few of my very own students....comments are welcome!

      Hello Guys and Dolls.  I just completed my Teacher Request for Transfer sheets to apply for English positions at Andrew Jackson High School and Chalmette High School.  I will be attending those interviews on May 15, just after my St. Charles Parish interviews on May 5.  A lot of possibilities and pros and cons are looming ahead, so I guess we will just have to sit tight and hope for the best.  I hope to get some good offers and decide my fate for next year from there.  This weekend will be a sports extravaganza for me.  Friday, I am going to the Zephyrs game and will be watching it from a suite that furnishes free snacks and beer.  Saturday will be the LSU spring game.  Both should be fun!  I tried to bake cookies today...I burned them.    American Idol voting is tonight.  I hope I am right when I say GOODBYE JOHN STEVENS!  He really needs to go home.  That's all for now...

      Welcome to Monday!  Today was my first day back at work after a lovely and lengthy Spring Break.  Fortunately, there are only 29 more days until summer.  Things are looking good on that end.  I am really excited about my summer employment gig teaching Creative Writing and Journalism and I am now also excited because I will be taking a vacation to the beach the week after camp lets out.  Should be fun.  I spent my Spring Break (and my Spring Break paycheck!) working on my new scrapbook and hanging out with my BR buddies.  I got to stay with Chass and Candace for a few days.  In those few days, I managed to almost make an entire quilt out of my CKI t-shirts (thanks, Chass) and addict Candace to the world that is scrapbooking.  Saturday night I had the pleasure of being "Mistress of Ceremonies" at the LSU Spring Banquet.  It was a nice banquet and I was awarded the Kiwanis Fellowship Award for the year.  Shout outs to my girls, Candace for winning Outstanding Kiwanis Family Member and Chass for being named Member of the Year as well as being inducted into the Carthage Pullman Society.  A huge honor to both of you!  Danielle took the stage as the new president and walked away with Outstanding Board Member, so that was also very nice.  This weekend will be low-key as I hang out with Bobby on Friday and go back to BR for the purple and gold game on Saturday.  Hope everyone is well!

      If you are a scrapbooker, you may be interested.  Today, I went to this little shop Amanda previously wrote about on her blog called Scrapbook Creations in Chalmette.  It is a tiny little store that recently opened and today was the first chance I had to visit.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  There is not a whole lot of stuff, just your basics, but the prices were good for a place like that.  I even found some good prices for cropping tools that other stores charge twice as much for.  In addition, the shop offers $5 crop nights every other Saturday from 6-11pm.  There is a little room in the back set up with tables and chairs, and for your $5 you get access to cropping tools, snacks, beverages, and uninterrupted space to scrapbook.    I am considering checking one of these nights out in May (probably May 15 because that is the next Sat I am available that they will have it).  I would love some company, so ladies, if you are interested and still have scrapbooking to work on after Michelle's party, let's go check it out.  I will even offer taxi service to and from Metairie.  And no, I do not get paid money or products for bringing people, I just know it is hard to get people to go to da parish.  Any takers?  In other scrapbook news, I started my new album today which is going to outline my entire college career.  WOW!  It will probably take a good bit of time, but I got a lot done today and I like the outcome so far.  I even used my new custom cutting system from Creative Memories...I love it!  That's all for now!

      Greetings, readers!  Well, it is my turn to have Spring Break, since all my still in college friends had the week off last week!  To start off my vacation, I read the following news article from nola. com that talks about a recent incident at my place of employment.  Please read this article  urlLink here   A few comments...  I find it sad that the spokeswoman for the school system allowed herself to say to the media that this was "a joke".  In today's society, you cannot take things like this as a joke.  Consider the incidents that have happened across the country recently.  I would not feel safe knowing that threats like this were being made to my children or students and knowing that the school system and its officials are blowing them off as a joke.  Second, what the hell is the story with the locker search?  Point of information, there was no locker search.  Why did the school feel the need to say there had been a search when there was not?  Third, and biggest upset of all...why the hell weren't the teachers, parents, and students informed of the situation?  I had to read this in the paper to learn anything about it.  I am disappointed and upset with the school and the system right now.  What are your comments?

      Well today was a very exciting day for me!  This morning, I got a call from the school board office informing me that I had a job offer from both the high schools that I interviewed with on Saturday.  I was stunned.  I thought that both the interviews went really well, but I was still surprised that I had to make this choice.  I weighed the pros and cons of the two, and I decided to return to Andrew Jackson, my alma mater, next year.  I will be teaching Yearbook/Newspaper Publications and two blocks of either English I, II, or III.  We'll see how that pans out soon.  Anyway, just thought I would share that exciting news with all of you.  I am so glad that I will be moving to high school next year!  Yay!

      Wow!  Things sure look different on the publishing side of the blog today!  This is pretty cool!  Anyway, I just got home from round 2 of Summer Discovery registration.  I now have about 35 kids signed up between my 3 creative writing classes and I have about 5 signed up for journalism.  I am sad that journalism did not fill up more, but at least if it stays this small, we will be able to get a lot more done.  And we still have a registration to go.  Funny thing is I was supposed to work 10-4 and they needed to add an additional "Games" class which is board games M-TH and outdoor games on F, so they asked if I wanted to do that.  So now I get to work 8-4 all week, which is fine with me because it will put more money in my pocket!  School is rounding out now, only 14 more days!  I am so ready for the summer!  This weekend will be busy with Transfer Day.  I have 3 interviews set up in St. Bernard, hopefully one of them will yield me a high school job for next year.  I will let you all know.  Other than that, not much going on except school and gearing up for summer camp.  Sorry if I bored you, but I had to write something!  Peace out!

      So, what's been going on?  This last weekend I saw a good friend of mine from high school get married at a beautiful church.  The ceremony was held at St. Maurice Catholic Church, a gorgeous church built in 1852, which now stands smack dab in the 9th ward ghetto.  Nice ceremony regardless and a fun reception following at the Balcony in Metairie.  The bride was definitely SMASHED, good for her!  This coming weekend Bobby and I will be traveling to Jackson, MS to visit his dad for the 4th of July.  I am really looking forward to the trip and my extended weekend off of summer camp.   On the summer camp end of the world, it has been fun.  My journalism class has been really great...we even visited Mr. Magnum at his home at Fox 8 for a field trip last Friday.  All the girls thought he was adorable and they all wanted to know if he was my boyfriend.  Don't worry, Lauren, they are a little too young for him!  While at the studio, we even got to see a live news report as the train-tanker accident that happened that day in Chalmette happened while we were on tour.  The kids were freaked out about it at first because they thought the refinery had blown up, but once we got the real story and they got to see an anchor go live on air, they quickly recovered.  The class also published the first paper and we are well on our way to the second one.  The creative writing classes are also doing good.  They have tackled poetry, fiction, and the elements of a story.  Tomorrow we will try to start on nonfiction.  In scrapbooking news, I am at a standstill while I wait for pics to be developed from Ship Island.  Since I forgot my camera, I am at the mercy of those who did not...so when they get a chance to develop, I can really start my summer book.  I am also waiting on myself to get a chance to develop pics from the weddings I attended in the past two weeks to start my wedding book.  I also still need to do my trip to Memphis from March, but I am thinking about doing that as a smaller book...we'll see.  And in other scrapbooking news, I am hosting a class at my home on July 18th at 1pm.  It will just be the basics as I anticipate a few new faces coming to see what it's all about.  If you are interested, please drop me an email and I will get back to you about it!  I guess that's about all for now...hope everyone has a good week!

      So I get home today and there is a small ivory colored envelope in the mailbox addressed to me.  The return address is Phoenix, AZ.  So I am thinking to myself...Hey self, who the hell do you know in AZ?   Ummmmm....nobody?  So I examine the envelope and I can see (with the help of the light) that enclosed is what appears to be a card with flowers.  Interesting...so I open it.  And it reads...  When we're apart, sometimes I stop and listen. And deep inside, I can still hear your voice, the last time you said...  Ok, now I am freaking out a little.  What the hell is going on here?  Do I have an ex in AZ?  A stalker?  A secret admirer?  Open the card...it says...  "Put that on my Dillard's card, please." I miss that!  LOL.  I was so surprised by that one and I had to share it with you all.  Props to Dillard's for such a clever way to leave an impression.  But, no, I will not be reviving my card, sorry. :)

      Well, Ship Island was certainly a fun experience.  A bunch of us took sail Saturday morning and had a great time riding out to the island, enjoying a HOT day in the sun, and riding back to the mainland a new shade of crimson red!  After the fun in the sun, it was off to Beau Rivage for some dinner and gambling and then back to the hotel to crash.  Today we hit the Grand in Gulfport and Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis on the drive home.  Thanks to all you guys who came out with us, I was glad to see that everyone seemed to have a good time!  This week will be a busy one as I publish my firswt issue of the Summer Discovery Digest with my journalism kids at camp and tackle the task of teaching 40 kids how to write poetry!  Wish me luck!  This weekend brings in Rhea, one of Bobby's good friends from his year as governor, and I look forward to meeting her.  Saturday night will be Ally and Nick's wedding, so everyone keep them in your thoughts this week as they prepare for their big day!  Hope everyone is well and has a great week!

      It's true, I changed it again.  I had originally planned to do this template, but could not figure out how to add the links.  Thanks to some help from blogger and my amazing patience, it all worked out okay for me.  I now have a template I really like and all my links are there and functional!  Today was my first day of summer camp.  I am teaching a very small journalism class (only 6 kids) and 3 rather big creative writing classes (10, 13, 19).  The kids range in age from 6-14 and they are combined in class with one another.  This is truly interesting because obviously first and ninth graders will not get the same out of writing activities.  So I have my work cut out for me trying to find individualized and age appropriate lessons for my kids.  Today was good.  We spent the hour doing mock interviews and creating colorful acronyms for one another.  Tomorrow we will do some journaling and a "chain link story".  Wednesday we will jump into poetry.  Because the theme of the camp is "Summer Discovery Discovers the Orient" we will be studying Oriental poetry like haiku, cinquain, and diamantes.  The kids seem excited about that and hopefully we will have fun with it.  June truly is a month for thinking about marriage.  Not me personally, but a ton of my friends.  On June 19, I have a wedding to attend in Baton Rouge, on June 26 I have a wedding to attend in New Orleans.  Today I went to see my best friend from high school (Chantel's) wedding dress and to look at bridesmaid dresses as I am her maid of honor.  My sister also asked me to stand in her wedding, so we have been talking about dresses as well.  Bobby's good friends Matt and Jackie tie the knot in July, Ricky was married at the end of May, and the list goes on and on and on.  So congrats to all the happy couples!  With all these wedding, I have decided to create an entire scrapbook dedicated to the weddings of my good friends.  I am starting it off with my old college roommate who was married in December of 2002, then adding Paul and Michelle from May 2003, and will continue to update as more people tie the knot.  My CM consultant should be happy if she is reading this! :)  Well, that about sums it all up.  4 more days until Ship Island!  I cannot wait for the fun!

      So I decided to change some things around.  I am not completely happy with this new template, so I am still shopping around for another new one.  It will do for now though!  Tomorrow brings me back into the classroom after my week off.  Well, I really didn't have the week off.  Monday I was at school all day for Records Day.  Thursday I had a meeting and orientation for summer camp.  Tuesday and Wednesday I spent preparing lessons and ideas.  But anyway, the life of a teacher never ends I guess!  I enjoyed Memorial Day Magnum Night.  Luckily for me, the time frame got pushed back so I got to indulge in the drinking.  It was a nice way to end the school year with friends.  Friday Bobby and I ate at Cheesecake Bistro with our gift certificate we won at the Northwestern Picnic for getting second place in the horseshoe competition.  Thanks, Northwestern Mutual!  In addition to this being the first week of Summer Discovery, I am hosting a jewelry party on Thursday night (any ladies reading this who want more info, email me!) and then this weekend it is off to Biloxi for a Ship Island Excursion.  I am really looking forward to the week and the weekend!

      If you have never known anyone to get married on a Tuesday before, you do now.&nbsp; Today my sister and her honey, Mason, tied the knot.&nbsp; The ceremony was very small and intimate...only about 10 guests there for the rite of marriage and some photos.&nbsp; Afterwards, we went to dinner at Don's Seafood in Metairie and the two of them will be boarding a plane tonight for Florida.&nbsp; They looked good together and happy, and I am happy for them.&nbsp;   As the two of them are now married, Mason is evacuating his current residence, which is half of a double that his parents own.&nbsp; Since this is happening, he had a washer and dryer, a queen size bed, a fridge, a sofa set, and other assorted household items to give away.&nbsp; Seeing as I was looking for a place to live and would need all those things, he gave them to me.&nbsp; In addition, his parents offered me the double at an affordable rate, so I get to move into an almost fully furnished double next weekend!  I was planning to wait to move out in May, once I had a little more money saved up and had bought some more stuff...plus the wedding was supposed to happen in May, so I knew Mason would have the washer/dryer set to give me....but it was too great of an opp to pass up.&nbsp; This way, I have no deposits to make, very little "big stuff" to move, and I am in a great neighborhood with landlords I personally know.&nbsp;   The double is wonderful...it's two bedrooms and one bath and it's very spacious.&nbsp; Once I get settled, I will probably try to have a little gathering of friends to celebrate.  Anyway, that is what's going on...if anyone is interested in helping me move, I will get more details posted soon, so just let me know!

      That was what my sister asked me on Monday.&nbsp;   "No, I probably will just be setting some stuff up in my new classroom.&nbsp; Why do you ask?"&nbsp; responded a clueless me.  "Well, I need you to be available around 1pm."  "Ok, what's up?"  "I'm getting married next Tuesday at 1pm and I would like for you to come."  Whirlwind!  Yeah, so my sister's wedding that was planned for May 21 has been pushed up to Tuesday.&nbsp; I went last night for 5 hours looking for a dress as I am her maid of honor.&nbsp; We finally found a really pretty one at David's Bridal, and matching shoes.&nbsp; Everything came together.&nbsp; Good thing that I opened that savings account this summer, huh?  Life is crazy.&nbsp; Aside from that, I got my official teaching assignment for next year.&nbsp; I will be teaching English I(freshmen), Advanced Composition (sophomores), and Publications (junior/senior elective).&nbsp; So I get a full plate of grade levels and 3 preps a day.&nbsp; Which is awesome for me as I hate to teach the same thing over and over again in a day.  I also was offered&nbsp; a job writing a weekly neighborhood column for the Times-Pic, something that I did for a few years about 3 years ago.&nbsp; I will be wriiting about the people, places, and events in Meraux and Violet.&nbsp; I also can propose feature articles to be published as a freelancer.&nbsp; This is great for me as I was very sad to have to quit the job years ago and can imagine no better way to make extra money than by doing what I love.&nbsp; And my name will be in print, which is way cool!  Camp ends for me tomorrow and I am off to Jackson for the tournament.&nbsp; I come home and have the wedding, school orientation, and then I am off again to Florida for a beach vacation, which I really need right now.  Hope everyone has a great weekend!

       So today I did something that I thought would be long in coming...I made my first payment toward my student loans.&nbsp; This means two things to me...1, I now have one more bill a month to remember and 2, it has been half a year since I graduated college!&nbsp; My, how time flies!    &nbsp;  Today I also read that StB teachers are facing a possible pay raise for this upcoming school year.&nbsp; The raise would not be much, but it would still be nice.&nbsp; Especially after the report where LA ranks 45th out of the 50 states in teacher pay scale.&nbsp; Ouch.    &nbsp;  This weekend was long in coming as it brings the grand finale of the summer camp I have been working at.&nbsp; We will host the "Summer Discovery Festival" at the school this Saturday from 9am to about 7pm.&nbsp; Student work will be on display and students will perform for various classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; My creative writing classes will have on display their writing portfolios and we will have copies of our book, "Poetry from the Orient" for visitors to take.&nbsp; After 6 weeks, it will be a relief to have this day over with.    &nbsp;  This weekend also brings my friend, Rebecca's wedding and a scrapbooking part-ay!&nbsp; Anyone interested in attending the scrapbooking gig, please call or email me.    &nbsp;  Also, if anyone has pictures from MAGNUM NIGHT 2004, please email them to me at   urlLink  tigerali@cox.net    ASAP.&nbsp; That is what I would like to work on at the party, and I have only a few pictures.&nbsp; Much thanks!    &nbsp;  That's about it for now...leave some love and have a good weekend!

      Attention anyone who likes to scrapbook or is interested in learning more about scrapbooking!   This Sunday at 1pm I will be hosting a Beginner Scrapbook Class with Creative Memories consultant Michelle Newfield.  All you have to do is show up with 5-6 pictures of your own, and she will take you from there.  You will have access to all of her supplies and she will demonstrate safe photo-album-making.  You will also walk away with your own completed page and a lot of knowledge about how to be a good scrapbooker.  The class is only $10, and if you choose to purchase a scrapbook that day, you will get $5 of those dollars back toward that purchase.  If you are interested, please email or call me to let me know.  It promises to be fun!
