         A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them. Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty. Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity..  You might like this game, but maybe it's not your thing. Take a look anyway if you are curious:  urlLink http://www.life-blood.vze.com/    urlLink  What kind of girl are you?    brought to you by  urlLink            Aahhh!!!! I'm a GIRLY GIRL?!  urlLink

          That cursed 1.6 km run......ouch! My legs.....And I was stuck doing assessments!!! Then I just happened to fall asleep, and when I woke up I had a big headache and my body was radiating heat and through half-closed eyes I thought,  YES!! I have a fever!!! P-le-a-s-e let me have a fever, so i dont need to do assessments and I can stay in bed and I can attempt to play the comp! Pleeeaasee.......          But, I took my temp. and it was 37.1 C. It was my substitute thermometer, so I thought,  Bah, it ain't working, try the other thermometer, it WILL show that I have a fever!          I found my main thermometer and tried. Even worse. 36.7 C. I seriously thought about throwing it out of my flat. So in the end I still had to do assessments, and would you believe it, I finished 4 TEST PAPERS!!!!! All Science. And those cursed papers required me to draw the simple machines!!!! In total I drew:      2 gears (1 big, 1 small. The big one took me 15 mins 2 draw, mind you)    a Wheel and Axle    an Inclined Plane    a Pulley        Ugh, and my head still hurts. When I was getting out of the car, then I forgot my documents(the petition). I turned back to get it, then I hit my head on the car roof. Really hard. Then there was this loud THUNK sound, well, at least it was in my ears, anyway. And I was like,  Whoa, what happened? , I fell about....almost fell down!

       One hour ago i was running the 1.6 km Run. It is soo......infuriating, stressing, tiring, and it puts you off yer nerve. I ran wif Aisha, since she came late. She walked it!!! We are  not  supposed to walk....but, I walked about 2 steps? Last year I didn't walk at all.      But that was bcuz I PRACTISED!!! And I was belted forward by Mrs Ng's words ringing in my head: " Sherrie you have alot of determination......Keep it up.......You can do it...." REALLY!!! She  really  said that to me last year!!!         For those of you wondering, I came in 30th place....Go on, laugh all you want!!!!! And the same feeling as last year, I couldn't feel my arms and legs when I ran into the coned area. I was like, is this a virtual game or something? Bcuz i cud see my arms and legs swinging but couldn't feel them!!!         Then I was like, aahh!!! Better slow down b4 you pass out or something...When I slow down I almost knocked over Mdm Shi.         AND I started a petition, WE WANT MS TAY BACK AS OUR SS TEACHER!!!!!!!! I HAVE ABT 20+ SIGGYS ALREADY!!!! AM GOING TO COLLECT MORE ON MON.!!!!! I strongly believe we can bring Ms Tay back!!! But if it backfires.....I dont wanna think of the consequences.....

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so 2day after school, we got to think up a spooky play for MRL Day. Since word got around there was no supplementary, many of the peeps went home, except for maybe 12 of us. It was so fun, we were discussing happily, but everyone seemed keen on my ideas. I dont mean to hog the spotlight, but, I must agree, my ideas  are &nbsp;good. HAHA, just kidding!!!!, all u people out there reading this entry!!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Then Aunty Neela had to shoo us out of that room. It was SO unfair, especially when we got permission for its usagability!!!(ok, i'm exaggerating here. the correct term is USAGE) Then we had to go down to the Reference Room. Well, things were not better there, but at least we got some work done. The Reference books there were  so  cool, we found plenty on Witches, Wizards, Magics, Myths and the like. Then Mrs Ngain came in and spooked C out, cuz she was like, taking charge(in an UNbossy way of course), like she did in P5 Camp. It was gr8.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; But Mrs Ngain came and C stopped. But that was okay. Then everyone started on my idea, and began to elaborate. When I pointed out the other suggestions, it was too late. Mrs Ngain was keen on my one. But I  have &nbsp;to admit, some of the suggestions were pretty gr8, especially Stephanie's.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, 2day went quite normally, except toward the end of GAO JI HUA WEN, I tried to slip a piece of paper to YL. I ended up doing crazy stuff, like crawling on the floor, but I still couldn't. Then i flashed a message on my Apricot to tell YL to ask to be excused frm class, but N-O-O! She didn't listen. Then I had to flash Daniel Zhang's Mag Picture&nbsp;(btw, LIME came in yesterday) in the back mini window, but she still didn't move then Shi Lao Shi asked, "Yen Ler, Ni Zai Kan Shen Me?"  I thought I was done for!!!!  Luckily Yen Ler snapped back her head in time.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; I finally passed the piece of paper to her via Claire.&nbsp;Many thanx, Claire!!!&nbsp;P.S. MANY people saw me flashing the Apricot, and the Daniel Zhang Pic, but luckily none told on me!!! : ) Thanx, guys!!!!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Now, the matter that has to be reported, and this will be said once and for all!!!(P.S. No hard feelings, Hui Ying!! : ) )        &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp; HUI YING!!!! I DO   NOT   LIKE EL* *N&nbsp; T* *G!!!!!!!! DO NOT PESTER ME ABOUT HIM ANYMORE!!!!!        &nbsp;    Thank you for listening to this announcement.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay, it's been a long time since I've written, but I don't care. Lots of things have happened over the past.....*counts on fingers* four days or so. If I list them all here, you'd die of boredom, but anyway, since 2day was just normal, I'll reflect on two things REALLY major:  NAPFA TEST, SOCIAL STUDIES, HEALTH CHECKUP!!        &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  NAPFA wasn't  that  bad. (for me) Sit-ups: C IPU: F Shuttle Run: E Standing Broad Jump:&nbsp;D&nbsp;Sit n Reach: D    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe out SS teacher changed  again!!!!  It's SO unfair!! According to XK and S, they don't like Mrs Chew very much. I think I am, too.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Eewww!!!! I can't believe they ask you to take off your shirt!!! Luckily it's a female nurse. When I was asked to proceed to the Seminar Room, I went to the AVA Rm instead. There were P6's inside, so I knew I went into the wrong room, but cheeky Esther said it was the right one. I'm not THAT stupid. Then XK came up behind me and was all, I thot it was the Seminar Rm?    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank God for her, or else I would have to take an injection. I hate them. And I have to take one this October!!!! And during P6! It is SO unfair!!!!!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay, so I went to watch Mean Girls 2day. When I walked into the cinema, I discovered my mom and I were the only ones there!!!!! Seriously...It was so uncomfortale.....as quiet as a grave. Then a few people started streaming in, mostly guys!!!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't believe it. I thought,  Hey, are we in the correct cinema?  Then it really was Mean Girls. Come on, it's a girly girl show. And more Males than Females were watching?! I live in a twisted world. Honestly.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Argh, I'm fed up with typing titles. Next week is Kiu Yan's Birthday, I think I'm just gonna send her a card or something. Am gonna advertise this blog on Monday!!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; And 2day Mrs Ngain showed us a video, something about taking care of your eyes. The dance moves were so cool, and the first time we watched we got the giggles. Then Mrs Ngain told us we might be dancing this in front of the whole school, maybe during Speakers' Corner. Then nobody voluteered, except Bernice, which i thought was gr8. Then Mrs Ngain called some people, Phyllis was first on her list. I also agree that she dances well, only she's afraid of being embarassed or something. Actually, I think that's the case with all of us. We just need enough motivation and the knowledge of the fact that we will NOT be embarrassed, although that's what everyone thinks.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; ~Sigh...Oh well, I live in a complicated world.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.  I  got chosen. Can you believe it? Actually, I think it's kinda great, and could possibly be fun! I'm so into it now, since I got chosen, I might as well put my whole heart into it.....    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; When I asked Ms Fernandez abt the Mr n Ms Reading Contest - Which I am S-O enthusiastic about, and I'm so sure I'm gonna win!! It's fun all the way, well maybe except for the Mr Reading Contest part, where it'll be a B-O-Y!!!! - she had this frown on her face, but when I mentioned it she,like, lit up, or something. Anyway, I got the details from her, the date for submission is the 28th, and I have 5 more q's to go, so i GUESS I have enough time.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm sure you guys out there will be rooting for me( RIGHT? ), I myself need a lotta luck!! Good luck to Me!!!!!!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, except for half a day off, and no h/w, the rest of 2day was pretty boring. So boring, I don't have anything to post here!!!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; Am I getting the usual visitors here? I hope so. Maybe I should insert a counter or something. AND I'm still bored, here at home. I should check out the GB website soon. Meanwhile, to keep me from dying from boredom, I'll play some Quizilla. And MAYBE I'll create an account there. Maybe.     &nbsp;   P.S. Today is Lisa's Birthday.    &nbsp;   urlLink

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay, there was some conflict in the class today, something about Chloe, but as that is unpleasant I shall not dwell on it. I have about Five minutes before my mom whisks me off to practice Ting Xie, so I'm really typing my fingers off now.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Today I took the public bus home with Xue Kun, but we decided to go to Mobil first. Then we crossed the road, not wanting to take the overhead bridge. Then we got kinda lost with the roads and this part of the road was v-e-r-y dangerous, and I foolishly anyhow stepped out, and Thank God, if Xue Kun wasn't with me I would've been road killed by now. So, a billion thanx to Xue Kun.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; But that's not all. When we FINALLY got the pavement toward the bus stop, we were walking, and so tired, then a car honked at us then stopped in front of us. SDS 9802 X. My dad's car plate number. I thought&nbsp;we were done for then. I thought  I  was done for. Xue Kun suggested me hiding the potato chips from Mobil but my dad would ask us why we were walking from that direction anyway.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily none of us were in deep trouble. We didn't even have to take the bus!!! I'm having second thoughts of going to Mobil the next Tuesday.....

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Argh, Art Elite was  so  boring....I fell asleep, literally! Then Aisha woke me up.....it's all a fib. I ALMOST fell asleep. But it would be so cool if I did, I could relieve myself from practically dying from boredom....    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I am seriously thinking about joining another CCA next year, maybe Science and Tech? ANYTHING that is un-related to art. Maybe in Sec Sch I'll join the Girl's Brigade....or the Girl Guides... Wan Ting told me there was a difference, i hafta ask her 2morrow.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Installed a MIDI File on this webby here, and I'm figuring out how to Install a thing in the Sidebar. And here's another one of the quiz results I took!! : )    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink

      &nbsp;&nbsp;  It was so awesome!! Everything was gr8, except 4 the waiting part. We stood outside for at least 2 hours!!!! Then I overheard a conversation between the teachers. Turns out, WE ALIGHTED AT THE WRONG PLACE!!!!!!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; When we  finally  got to go in, the stadium looked GR8. Lotsa stuff inside the Fun Pack. And we got 2 eat our food. Oh yeah....Janie's nose bled and Ramya dropped J's food and there was like....a commotion between the teachers.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; It just so happens that the fireworks things are behind me. So when they exploded it was super loud. Chloe almost went deaf.&nbsp; : )     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; And the flashlight was the same model as C's hp. She took pics of the fireworks, hope she'll send it to me. There were many performances, looked awesome from bird's eye view...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; P-l-u-s...I want to download Gunbound again, but I can't. My old comp has gunbound, but my new one doesn't. I went to gunbound.net, but for some reason it ain't working. SMSed Chloe n HYL 4 help.

       &nbsp;   Wolves of water have a peculiar personality. A water wolf will be perky and quick thinkers. Im sorry to say but the water wolf is a common type. Their agile and beautiful. They are not my favorite type but they are still cool wolves. Watch out though. A water wolf can be offended easily even though they would much rather follow. Naturally when they are born they will have no horn but, eventually when they become two months old the horn grows sharper and more of an aqua blue. If you are calm and cool then you must be the wolf of water.   urlLink   What Elemental Wolf Are You? (with pics/read memo)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       &nbsp; Okay, sorry about the pink thing on this webpage. Truth is, there's no better format!!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp; 2day, I decorated my desk, but the stupid plastic sheet keeps falling off!!! Some of the pictures of stars I decorated my desk with are: Avril Lavigne(obviously!), Lindsay Lohan and MK&amp;A.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; I found out the worst thing abt MK yesterday. She was diagnosed with dyslexia!! It means that you worry about ur weight, then u don't eat for a L-OOOOO-N-G time. Then you get all weak and can't think straight. I've read many horrifying testimonies on the Internet to know. Hope you get well soon, MK!    &nbsp;  &nbsp; And then Xue Kun brought her baby brother's photos 2day. He is SSSOOOOOO cute!! Maybe cuter than Wan Ting's younger brother!!! My brother is too old to be cute anymore, but(don't tell him I posted this!!) girls his age are like, okay, during my church camp, in Malaysia, the whole church was staying at this hotel. My brother acted out this King called King Saul, but he only had a few lines, no, WORDS, and he said them so lifelessly!!!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Even so, in the Ballroom of the hotel at dinner after the play, my family finished wif our dinner and started back to our room, when 2 girls abt the same age as my brother walked 2wards him and said, almost COOED (excuse me while I puke), "H-iiiiii, King Sa-uuuul!!"    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Argh! Still makes me sick everytime I think about it. Woe to those who are being admired by them, you GUYS better watch out!!    &nbsp;  &nbsp; In case you wondered, my brother is only Pri. 2.

        Being the forgetful person that I am (i 4got 2 give mrs ngain my health booklet!!), I forgot to post something else.    During the preview this Sat, Zhu Li and YuYuan will be the ones who lead the whole class, so we wont get lost. Then Me n Chloe at the back, maybe theres another pair for another special reason or something, but I 4got either. ;)    The others got 2 pair up in groups of 6 (lucky them). I feel a little disappointed, but then i remember i was the one who volunteered for my own post, then i get better. Seems like a cool position....I guess.

        ~Sigh another day, I guess. Except that we were given permission 2 decorate our desks. Later on(maybe after i finish dis) I'm gonna go downstairs and buy some wrapping paper. Since Serene's is Pale Blue/Pale Purple, and Xue Kun's is Yellow/Orange, mine had better be matching theirs, too. Maybe Pale Pink, Pale Green, or Pale....something else. My main preference for now is Pale Green.    I know, I know....I can buy some from the school bookshop. True, but everyone's bought from there, so I'll only have the same design as the others. Besides, They don't have the colours I want. Hopefully my mom'll let me go downstairs.     Oh Well, Wishful Thinking!!

       Ok, um, nothing much happened 2day, except that during the MT Period 2 of Mdm Shi's P6 Pupils performed a skit for us. Really funny. And 2day I had the hiccups non-stop. Except when Mrs Ngain called me 2 the board 2 write my answer. When I went up 2 the board my hiccups were gone. And at dismissal time it came back. And when I reached the foyer it stopped. Freaky Day so far...  Oh well, who knows what culd happen this evening....Nothing that I know of, except that I will be watching Daddy's Girls n Singapore's Brainiest Kid.  Oh yeah, I hafta print more pictures of Avril Lavigne to decorate my desk 2morrow. :)

          Oh yah, I remembered what i wanted to say....         Today was the teachers' day auditions!!! Patricia and I were in charge of the CD player. There were some weird dances by the P3's. One group even confessed that they never practised with the music  (STRIKE ONE!!) , when the radio didn't emit any sound. Then they tried dancing without the music, but they couldn't  (STRIKE TWO!!!) . They made up all kinds of excuses. So guess what happened then?  STRIKE THREE!!!! YOU'RE OUT!!!!              Ow Liya's skit was funny, although I'm not allowed to reveal any results, I'll say this anyway, but it was kinda too long. And Siti's dance was definitely out, cos' the music had cuss words, like  bullshit . And Sadhya's dance music too.         OHH.....PLEASE SOMEONE DON'T KILL ME FOR REVEALING SOME OF THE STUFF WE DISCUSSED!!!!!!         Peace out.         P.S. You might not find me in one piece tomorrow, or the day after.

          After a huge scolding and some tears, I finally got to the Skate Park with Pat to enjoy the Ashlee Simpson Showcase. It was kinda cool, except that it rained for 15 minutes. And also Ashlee was 30 - 45 mins late. Really, even though I never listened to Ashlee Simpson before, I still enjoyed it. I really like Pieces Of Me.         Another annoying thing, was that there was this gang of guys who totally didn't like Ashlee Simpson. I guess they just came cos' it was free, or maybe with their girlfriends. And there was this totally mental guy with them. Really. When the crew was throwing lil' packets of ponchos to the crowd since it was raining, the guy started shouting (he has a real loud voice, AND HE WAS PRACTICALLY SHOUTING INTO MY LEFT EAR!!!!), "AY!!!! FREE CD'S !!!! I WANT THE FREE CD!!! THROW HERE!!! THROW HERE!!!!         Also, they started throwing posters. One landed at my feet. I totally bent down to pick me up, but the mental guy behind dived for it, so I stopped. I know, stupid mistake, but if I went further for it, I could have been squashed by the mental, cos' he's quite a large size, and he reached for it violently.          In the end, the girl in front of me picked it up. Lucky her. I  hate  the mental guy.

          OMG, after supplementary I saw Patricia outside, so I went to talk to her, and she asked me abt the Avril Lavigne Poly Ringtone again. So I listened to see wat she got and I chose My Happy Ending, (duh cuz its my fave. But i like Don't Tell Me too) AND IT TOTALLY WORKS!!!! OMG!!! IT'S SO GR8!!! MILLIONS OF THANX TO MY BEST FRIEND!!!         Okay, so I guessed I 'm repaying her by going to the Ashlee Simpson Showcase with her. I'm going on Sunday at 5.....so that means I can't go to the 3rd Church Service, cos it ends at 4+. Now I have to go through EXCRUCIATING PAIN, bcuz I have to go to the 2nd Service instead. Wanna know why I feel the pain?  Because , ET is gonna be there!! Oh my god, I'm so dead.         Oh yeah, Teachers' Day Auditions are coming on this Tuesday. I'm not sure what time it is, I hafta ask Pat. Wanna know why I care? COS.....I'M DE JUDGE!!!!!         P.S. Today is Friday the 13th!!!!!

Omg, girls all over the world are gonna be soo depressed. I mean, lotsa girls have this, eternal crush on him. So if you know a friend who is like obsessed over Daniel Radcliffe(see main symptom above), you'd better not tell them about this. They'd probably kill themselves.

          Okay, I have a website I want you guys to have a look at. My cousin referred me to it two years ago. Which cousin? Oh, the Clay Aiken look-alike one. Except my cousin doesnt look like a geek at all. It's called  urlLink Happy Tree Friends . Don't be fooled by its name. It's not lame AT ALL. It's pretty disgusting, if you ask me.          I'm not kidding on this part. All those with weak hearts had better not view the website. It might give you bad dreams for like, a month. Look what happened to me. I avoided it altogether for two years. WARNING: IT'S DISGUSTING. THOSE WHO FAINT AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD, EVEN CARTOON ONES, BETTER NOT VISIT.

          Okay, first off, when I boarded the bus for home, 851 was like, an ANCIENT bus!! It was a slight rusty yellow on the outside, inside had a feeling of the past. XK said it was like the electric train in China. The driver even  looked  like a China man.         And I really wish HY would stop talking about Shawn. God, she talks about him EVERYDAY. She never fails to mention him when I'm talking to her. NEVER.         There was this fight on MSN between HY and YL bcuz HY supposedly insulted Tony. But it's over now. I think.

          Well, I just found out that I had to do an essay on someone famous. It's a prefect thing (again!). You all know who came into my mind, right? Avril Lavigne. But Mun Foong said I couldn't. So I chose Marie Curie, since I borrowed a book about her from the library already.         Also, *ahem* the person whom I had a crush on *ahem*, Geraldine said she saw him at a bowling centre. She said he dyed his hair golden brown. I thought , What? Golden brown? He must look damn ugly          And G SMS'ed me back saying he looked damn ugly. *gushes* Oh, I am s-o-o psychic!!          P.S. Singapore Idol was gr8, especially the Mother Nature strikes back part at the beginning, but I feel really sorry for the Shanghai guy.

       Well, it went pretty okay, except for the part where we had to go down to the bookshop to buy some stationary. When we chose our stuff, we forgot to bring our money!!! It was so embarassing!!       We asked the auntie at the bookshop to wait, then we ran toward the overhead bridge, past the playground and the exercise area. Then we rushed into the lift, reached my house.....and you know the rest.      We finally purchased our stuff, but we still needed crepe paper. That bookshop didn't have the colours we wanted. So we tried to find another bookshop, but we couldn't. Then we were a little hungry and had some money left, so we went back to the bookshop and bought ice-cream(that shop got alot of visits from us), then we sat down and ate. My parents, of course, didn't know this. Daky, Mun Foong and I went back home.       Two hours later, Daky's permanent marker's ink ran out. We thought,  Oh no, not again....We have to go back to the bookshop!!!  But we had no choice, so we went back. My family needed to buy batteries and Blu Tack anyway.      So we went back to the bookshop....the auntie must have thought we were so weird. We purchased the permanent marker, then went to look for the rest of the stuff. We found the batteries, but no Blu Tack. Then Mun Foong suggested that it was in the bookshop also, so we thought,  OH NO!!!!!!!       Ugh.....we had to go back in and buy it. Seriously, the bookshop is making a lot of money!!!!!

       Apart from the whole church thing yesterday, this is wat I have to type: Well, in Courts yesterday, we went there after church, cos' my Mom wanted to buy a washing machine. Seriously. Our current one is at least 2 years older than me!!!      And the audio section was right next to the washing department, so I checked it out, and I totally fell in love with this radio! I mean, come on.....It was blue and silver, my fave colour combination in the world, and it could even play MP3 CD's!!! Not that I have any. Anyways, it only cost about $159, and I told my Mom about it.       Of course, she said no. She'd say the usual stuff as an excuse not to buy me stuff that I wanted. Of course, I am grateful for the many things I had to argue for before she bought them for me, but hey, I wish she would let loose a little on the cheapskate-ness!!!      She went, what's wrong with the old one? And I was all, first of all, it's BLACK. It's ugly. Second of all, sometimes when I want to change the tracks, it takes SUCH a long time, and sometimes it aborts the mission altogether. Third, its repeat button can only repeat the CD!!! Can't repeat the tracks!!!      Seriously, that's all the reasons to get you to buy that for me, but she stood firm. She's SO unfair. Hello, then she said, "If you get good results, you can choose, the -thing that I want most which I cant tell you-, or the radio."      She is SO difficult. I mean, doesnt she know how difficult it is for me to get high marks for my Chinese? Getting the good results part was difficult enough. Now she wanted me to choose between my most wanted object and the radio. And although it IS a bit pricy, hello, we're christians, and doesn't she learn every week on Sunday on how the Lord provides?       I think all of us has found a fault in our mothers which we are peeved most. For example, Daky just called to say she couldn't stay over. The fault, of course, was her mother's.....well, and partially her aunt's.       MUN FOONG JUST CALLED TO SAY SHE COULDN'T STAY OVER TOO!!!! I'M GOING TO LIE IN DEPRESSION FOR THE WHOLE OF TOMORROW........ It's not fair.....even after they promised......

       Da Mouse didn't show up 2day. Don't know, don't care. I told dat to Yen Ler, since she SMS'ed me during Church dismissal (thank God it was during the dismissal), saying she was bored, so I told her about the P6 guy in my church who had a mouse face. Geraldine and I call him that behind his back, even though his real name is Jordan Tay.      I SMS'ed YL back saying that, then she asked me something about knowing him or ever talking to him. I replied, yah, maybe laughed at his jokes and maybe had a few short conversations wif him, and her conclusion was.....        U SOUND LIKE U LIKE HIM LEH, DO U LIKE HIM? IS HE UR BF?

          Yay...Daky and Mun Foong are sleeping over! They're coming tomorrow, after lunch. BUT, I still have to remember, it's all for the sake of the Touch Book Project. But I'm still excited!!!         There's church 2day, so the Mouse Face'll be there. I found out last week he has the same surname as me. Whatever. The guys last week kept me and Geraldine cracking up, what with the Kallang Wave and all. Too bad Vanessa wasn't there. ~Sigh, I hope I'll actually pay attention to 2day's lesson.....I'm signing out for now!

          I just discovered a new singer whom songs I like. Seems Kari Kimmel's song appeared in the Top Five on SoNick too. It was great. So now I'm listening to her music. I'm trying to find her album name so I can buy it, but so far the Yahoo! Search is giving me a lotta crap. I'll try Google.         P.S. I'm stuck doing Chinese Assessments, but the worst is over. I'm done with it already.

          Yesterday before the chatting incident, I listened to Avril's first album, Let Go. Seriously, it was so long when I last heard it. The voice sounded......younger, I guess. And Avril was right about Under My Skin. It  was  deeper, with more emotion.          And I read my MC books, too. All American Girl. Finished it within two days. It's about an ordinary girl who accidentally stops a crazy psycho from assasinating the President. And  WHAM!  Fame hit her in the face. Now I'm starting on Princess Diaries: Give Me Five.         Also, on SoNick yesterday, when I saw Avril's Music Video 'My Happy Ending' came in the first place, I screamed (real loud, mind ya), switched the sound to the stereo, and turned up the volume. I was sure the whole building could hear. I didn't care one single bit.          When I turned up the volume and screamed away while watching the video, it was the most magical 4 minutes of my life, I tell ya. P.S. There weren't any parents!!!!!!

          I was just chatting with Yen Ler, Janie and Chloe. Then Geraldine (church friend) just came online. It is much easier when you combine everyone into one box window, so that was exactly what I did. The conversation seemed to go pretty well, but then a new dialog box opened, with me, Janie, Chloe and Yen Ler.         I asked what was going on, and YL said that she and C thought G was an extra. An EXTRA?! What was up with that? G was perfectly okay, how could they just dump her like that? I immediately told them I was logging off, and I did the same to G. I did it with anger and frustration.         An EXTRA?! That was so....inconsiderate! I know that it's lame, but I'm too angry to think straight.       I'm getting fed up with people or me being pissed off on MSN. (Read Janie Post below) I am NOT logging on for a while, to let my anger simmer down a little.

       Well, not much happened, it was the same as every year. At the end, XK wanted to go to J-8 and I wanted to go with her, but I couldn't. DONT ask why. I'm in a bad mood now.      Yesterday, Janie said something offensive about HY to all of us. Then during the celebrations, I told HY. Just now J, HY and I were chatting on MSN, then HY told J about what she said. Then J asked who told her that and HY said it was me. Then J lied and said it was me who said the offensive stuff, and HY actually believed her!!! Yeah, she believed J over me!!! I tried and I pleaded, but no-oo, HY still believed it was me.       I decided to leave the conversation rite there n then. Before I did that, I wrote: JANIE I HATE YOU      And I left.      But I don't want to talk about  that  anymore. I cant believe my group still hasn't finished the Touch Book! I saw Liya's and it was gr8, but that was probably because Miss Toh was their supervising teacher. Monday and Tuesday we're probably gonna work in my house, so I asked Daky if she could stay over Monday nite, so that it'll be easier.       She said she wants to, but she still has to ask her parents. I still have to ask Mun Foong about it. But it doesn't look too good.

        Your and Innocent Unicorn! Innocent Unicorns are very pure and good. They are the rarest of types and sadly, are being hunted. Thats because an Innocent Unicorn horn once removed from the head, is worth alot of money, and if left in holy water for a day, will turn into diamond. Young Innocent Unicorns always stay close to their mothers, and always will stand by there side even when they grow. Innocent Unicorns are said to be the friends of angels and can dance on moonbeams. Innocent unicorns represnt virginty, goodness, pureness, and love. They always value friendship, and familly, and are facinated by humans. Innocent unicorns are shy, but if friends for someone, its a friend to the end.   urlLink  What kind of Unicorn are you?

          Wanna know what happened during Spelling 2day? I'm very annoyed by it now, but i guess it's more of a laughing matter.          I got full marks for my last spelling test, so I got a sticker(yay!). Then Xue Kun pointed out a mistake, so I had to deduct a point, go up to Mrs Ngain to mark corrections. Then Xue Kun pointed out another mistake, so I had to deduct another mark. Then I had to go up to Mrs Ngain again, and said, "I found another one,"         AND THEN MRS NGAIN DID THE CRUELEST THING!!! SHE SAID, "Oh, then I have to remove your sticker," She said with a smile. THEN SHE CAREFULLY PEELED MY STICKER OFF MY PAGE!!!! AAHHHH!!!!!!!!!         I GOT BACK AND STRANGLED XUE KUN, POINTING TO HER AND SCREAMING, "ALL BCAUSE OF YOU!!! I LOST MY STICKER!!! YOU TOOK AWAY MY STICKER!!!"         But it was all said in laughs, smiles and fun, so no-one died. :)

          A few days ago, my brother received a letter for the gifted program. Of course, I told him to join. But he was still wavering. I talked to him some more. I'm sure he was shouting YES inside his head but was too shy. I KNOW. Haha. : )         Then my mom said that the Old Goat (of course she didn't say 'old goat' she said  yang yang's  older   brother) was also in the gifted program, and now he's in a gifted school. I was like, What?! I didn't even know that!!          I didn't expect someone like him to get into a gifted school, he never told me that, seeing as we don't talk much. I do like his younger sister(3 yrs old maybe?) though. I play and TRY to talk with her a lot, but I don't hear much of her talking. She DOES talk, but it's just gabble. : )         His younger brother(4 or 5 yrs old) Noah is also entertaining to watch. He can also talk, but sometimes it's rubbish, and most of my cousins get irritated, especially the older guys. But the even older girls think it's cute.         Y'know, it's not fair that I'm stuck with a whole bunch of guys around my age in the cousin lineup. The girl cousins are either too old or young to "hang out" with. I mean, my fave girl cousin Jessie(she's VERY cool) is 17 this year! That's the closest girl age to mine. Then I have this baby cousin, Joleen. She's quite boring sometimes.         And one time, I heard some guy voices shouting, so I went to check it out. The Old Goat (it's his nickname, the guys call him that) was shouting at Zhao Xing (my older cousin). He made Phyllan cry (Old Goat's OTHER younger bro), and was shouting at Zhao Xing. Seriously, Phyllan is the same age as me, and STILL needs his older brother to fight his battles?         I know MANY girls who are at least 5 times tougher than him. C, for example.            Please Note: The Old Goat is not my cousin. Care to guess what relationship he has with my family? 50 cents will be given to the winner!! Haha!!!!!
