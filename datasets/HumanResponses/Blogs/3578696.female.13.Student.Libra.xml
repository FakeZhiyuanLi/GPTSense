      My sister always makes me want to kill her!!!! She somtimes gets in trouble for punching me, but not in enough trouble. I can't believe I sometimes even feel sorry for her when she gets in trouble, but I won't any more! I am sick of the way she treats me! I want payback!!!

      I don't know if anyone remembers this from a year ago, but this was my theme song of the year..don't ask me why i don't want to talk about it i just thought of posting one of the songs that gave me an outlet when i was not myself last year..it was just one of those things that you never want to talk about when those feelings fade out.  Yeah...it's been so long(oh) I find myself still thinkin' about you. Do you ever think about me?(ever think about me) Check this out girl  All those nights that we kissed  Are the nights that I miss  Holding hands as your man for sure  We were young but secure  What we had was so pure  Innocence ever since we spoke   Why do we fall in love  When love will only tear us apart  Back then world was ours Everything was so right(yeah)  But we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  Never thought that we could do wrong  Oh we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  I can't believe that those days are gone(Yeah,I miss you baby)  So much pride as my girl  Thought I showed you the world  Memories,you and me,so real(so real) Gave my heart and my soul  Made you sunshine from cold  All those days,far away from here  I still think about you,hear me out...  We danced so close, we held on tight(yeah)  I never knew that love could feel so right  We danced so slow, we danced all night(aah) Assuming that tomorrow would be bright  We kissed goodnight, you walked on by  The vision of your shadow caught my eye  My life stood still, you went inside  I never got the chance to say my last goodbye (say goodbye)   I still can't believe it(no no) After all this time(all this time)  I'm still missing you Damn, some things will never change...

      When someone tells u this it just melts ur heart..after you and your significant other have parted ways..and i have heard many people say this or this was basically said to them..this is a song that gives you hope that there is someone "better" out there for you.  Somebody told me you were leavin’  I didn’t know  Somebody told me you’re unhappy  But it doesn’t show  Somebody told me that you don’t want me no more  So you’re walkin’ out the door  Nobody told me you’ve been cryin’  Every night  Nobody told me you’d been dyin’  But didn’t want to fight  Nobody told me that you fell out of love from me  So I’m settin’ you free   Let me be the one to break it up  So you won’t have to make excuses  We don’t need to find a set up where  Someone wins and someone loses  We just have to say our love was true  But has now become a lie  So I’m tellin’ you I love you one last time  And goodbye  Somebody told me you still loved me  Don’t know why  Nobody told me that you only  Needed time to fly  Somebody told me that you want to come back when  Our love is real again   Just turn around and walk away  You don’t have to live like this  But if you love me still then stay  Don’t keep me waiting for that final kiss  We can work together through this test  Or we can work through it apart  I just need to get this off my chest  That you will always have my heart...

      that's what i would say if i was rich..and so would you..so many days so many hours i'm still burning til you return..sorry i suddendly got caught up in the moment. well what were some of the things that i promised..oh yeah..well about 2 weeks ago i went to iowa with a couple of my relatives and spent the memorial weekend holiday in a motel and went fishing..boy a lot of things happened that day..first when we left chicago it was cold and it looked like there was about to be a storm but luckily when we got to iowa it was partly cloudy but still warm..some of the things that happened ticked me off..first of all the motel gave us a smoking room and i didn't like that..neither did my aunt..i couldn't swim in the indoor pool cause i didn't feel like putting on my bathing suit in the morning..but now i wished i did just 'cos it had a hot tub..what else..hhmm..well they served us muffins and other things in the morning..coffee and some juices. When we got to the fishing place we found a lot of people there who haven't gone home 'cos they wanted to catch more fish than they needed to catch..and sad to say after many tries my relatives didn't catch any fish at all..but i did spend some quality time with my little cousins..i spent the time playing softball and baseball with my little cousin matthew..and that little guy can hit and play good..and also we threw rocks at the mississippi river..that's all i remember about the trip..oh and the best part of all was that i was away from technology and i was able to spend some time without people telling me what to do for a change..that is it for now and i have more stories to tell when i post some more.

      This is my summer theme song..everytime i hear this o man i just start singing and i get caught up in the moment and it makes me feel good 'cos it simply reminds me of summer..and my summer vacation..I love it!   See the curtains hangin' in the window  In the evening on a Friday night  A little light-a-shinin' through the window  Lets me know everything's all right   Summer breeze makes me feel fine  Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind  Summer breeze makes me feel fine  Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind   See the paper layin' on the sidewalk  A little music from the house next door  So I walk on up to the door step  Through the screen and across the floor   Sweet days of summer -- the jasmine's in bloom  July is dressed up and playing her tune  And I come home from a hard day's work  And you're waitin' there  Not a care in the world   See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen  Food cookin' and the plates for two  Feel the arms that reach out to hold me  In the evening when the day is through...

      This song makes me feel good and makes me daydream about my crush..or just at the spur of the moment when i see someone i like!  Get a load of me, get a load of you Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you It's just like we were meant to be  Holding hands with you when we're out at night Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right And I've got someone waiting too  What if this is just the beginning We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it So tell me Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you  Isn't this the best part of breakin' up Finding someone else you can't get enough of Someone who wants to be with you too  It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch But wouldn't it be beautiful  Here we go, we're at the beginning We haven't f@$%#& yet, but my heads spinning  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it So tell me Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you  High enough for you to make me wonder Where it's goin' High enough for you to pull me under Somethin's growin' out of this that we can control Baby I am dyin'  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you  Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it So tell me Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you...

      This song hurts me so much..i dunno why it makes me so emotional but it just does and that's how i feel..words can't express how i fell when i hear this song..oh man..i think i'm going crazy!  Girl, understand..why  See it's burning me to hold onto this  I know this is something I gotta do  But that don't mean I want to  What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you  I just I feel like this..is coming to an end  And its better for me to let it go now  than hold on and hurt you..I gotta let it burn   It's gonna burn for me to say this  But it's comin from my heart  It's been a long time coming  But we done been fell apart  Really wanna work this out  But I don't think ya gonna change ya I do but you don't  Think it's best we go our separate ways  Tell me why I should stay in this relationship  When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby  Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with  I think that you should let it burn   When your feeling ain't the same  and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz  the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might bruise you  Let it burn Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know it's best for you except but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over  You know that it was through  Let it burn Let it burn  Gotta let it burn   Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to  Got somebody here but I want you  Cause the feelin ain't the same  find myself Callin' her your name  Ladies tell me do you understand?  Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?  It's the way I feel  I know I made a mistake  Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back  What I gotta do now  To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh  Man I don't know  what I'm gonna do Without my booo  You've been gone for too long  It's been fifty-eleven days, um-teen hours  Imma be burnin' till you return  (let it burn)   When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz  the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might bruise you  Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)  Let it burn (gotta let it burn) Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know its best for you except but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over you know that it was through  Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn   I'm twisted cuz one side of me  is tellin' me that I need to move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)  I'm twisted cuz one side of me  is tellin' me that I need to move on  On the other side I wanna break down and cry  (yeah)   Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh  (can ya feel me burnin'?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh   So many days, so many hours I'm still burnin' till you return   When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to  But you know gotta let it go cuz  the party ain't jumpin' like it used to  Even though this might bruise you  Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn   Deep down you know it's best for you except but you  Hate the thought of her being with someone else  But you know that it's over  You know that it was through  Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn...

      Read some of the comments i made throughout the lyrics of the song. I think it explains a lot.  Why do birds suddenly appear-----> yes why does that happen?  Every time you are near?-----> it always happens to me.  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.----> i always want to be around him.   Why do stars fall down from the sky-----> yes why do they?  Every time you walk by?-----> i just fall for you.  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   On the day that you were born  and the angels got together----> when were u born again?  And decided to create a dream come true---> o its a dream come true alright!   So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair---> that's why ur hair is so shiny!   And starlight in your eyes Like they do---> ooh those eyes!  That is why all the guys in town---> o really they d?!  Follow you all around---- u never told me that!  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   If only for a minute  I’d settle for an hour---> 'cos its too long!  And if you could stay just for one day  That would make me so happy happy baby---> o so happy!   See it won’t hurt to give our love a try--> just once!  Girl don’t u pass me by---> yea don't just pass by love!  Cuz I’m that kind of guy--> cuz im that kind of girl!  Who’s going to love and treat you like a queen---> more like a king   That is why all the girls in town  Follow you all around---> o so now i have competition!  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.---> yes they do!   Come a little closer baby--> come more closer than that!  Lay your head up on my shoulder baby---> come on cry! Boy you know I cant deny it--> can't deny love!  You done already set my soul on fire--> ooh come on baby light my fire.   Just like me, they long to be Close to you...---> yes they do!

      This is my fave song of the moment! Some one sent this to me and it just made me feel good. The lyrics are good and the song is amazing! Here it is!  Fallin' out, fallin' in  Nothing's sure in this world, no no  Breaking down, breaking in  Never knowin' what lies ahead  We can really never tell it all, no no   Say goodbye, say hello  To a lover or friend  Sometimes we never could understand  Why some things begin with just love  We can really never have it all, no no hoh hoh   But, oh, can't you see  That no matter what happens,  life goes on and on  And so, baby, just smile  'Cause I'm always around you  And I'll make you see how beautiful life is for you and me   Take a little time, baby  See the butterfly's colors  Listen to the birds that sent to sing for me and you  Can you feel me  This is such a wonderful place to be   Even if there is pain now  Everything will be alright  For as long as the world still turns,  there will be night and day   Can you hear me  There's a rainbow always after the rain   Hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh   Hittin' high, hittin' low  Win or lose you should go, yeah yeah

      here is a song that I'm listening to now that talks about self-confidence that you should consider when you are feeling down or is just not getting noticed enough by anyone...and that even though we women are strong we have weaknesses too..if only you'd get to know know us.  You think that I go home at night Take off my clothes, turn out the lights But I burn letters that I write To you, to make you love me  Yeah, I drive naked through the park And run the stop sign in the dark Stand in the street, yell out my heart To make, to make you love me  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  You may not believe in me But I believe in you So I still take the trash out Does that make me too normal for you?  So dig a little deeper, cause You still don't get it yet See me lickin' my lips, need a primitive fix And I'll make, I'll make you love me  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess  See me jump through hoops for you You stand there watching me performing What exactly do you do? Have you ever thought it's you that's boring? Who the hell are you?  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  Average every day sane psycho

      I am kind of sad na hindi kami pupunta sa iowa para sa july 4th weekend..gosh i wanted to go camping..too bad hindi matutuloy..well there is always a next time..do you know i'm currently looking for a job..para naman ma fulfill ko yung promise ko sa sarili ko..i've always wanted a summer job and ngayon lang ako binigyan nang permission nang parents ko to get a job..well i don't want to say too much about it..just that i applied for two jobs and if i don't get any of those then i'll look for more better jobs out there...i dunno why i'm looking for jobs anyways..i should just enjoy my summer by sleeping and doing nothing but going to the park and playing sports like tennis or softball..i should be more active now na malapit na ako maging diece otso..hehe.  you know what i have a very imaginative head and i always daydream when i am not supposed to..sometimes i get in trouble just by not listening to what people around me say..aah well thats it for now pray na sana mag ka summer job ako by this week.

      I wish I could sum up how I feel right now but I can't, it is all happening too fast for me and I feel like I might not make it in time if I mess up..plus there is this added pressure, like what if mama doesn't agree with it and what if daddy is just putting up a front and that he doesn't really want me to go..I guess I'll find out next tuesday when it does happen..I mean I'm old enough to think things on my own but my ma still wants to make decisions for me whether I like it or not.  I gave up finding a job last week, I mean hinde ko naman kailangan magtrabaho but I guess gusto ko lang maging active during this summer. Also I'm going on vacation sa Canada in a little while so I don't want to waste my time looking for a job if I'm not going to keep it, also I don't want to have a bad record 'cos I'm a newbie.  Right now I love listening to tamia's "officially missing you"...seriously it makes me cry everytime i listen to it..hinde ko alam kung bakit basta lang it does..well sayonara for now!

      This song makes me think 'cos it says a lot about how i feel about life and such..I am also considering changing my life in a big way but I'm having doubts so I'll see if I can get through with it.  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I  wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never  meant to do those things to you And so I have to  say before I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used  to be A reason to start over new and the reason  is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must  live with everyday And all the pain I put you  through I wish that I could take it all away And  be the one who catches all your tears Thats why  i need you to hear   I've found a reason for me To change who I used  to be A reason to start over new and the reason  is You   I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do  those things to you And so I have to say before  I go That I just want you to know   I've found a reason for me To change who I used  to be A reason to start over new and the reason  is you   I've found a reason to show A side of me you  didn't know A reason for all that I do And the  reason is you...

      today we had to go to a party for one of our cousin and aunt..he has a b-day and she had her graduation..and they live in chicago..and if you live in chicago then you know how hard it is to find parking when there is a party in the neighborhood..i think we spent about 20 minutes trying to find a spot to park because we couldn't find any..the party was okay considering that i haven't seen some of their faces in a long time..the food was good..though cold..i guess i was too lazy to heat it..when we went home i fell asleep in the car and i didn't get to wake up until we were my mom woke me up to look after my lil baby bro in his carseat while she went to Jewel's to buy some food..and since my brother just woke up too..he kept crying and it took me just a couple of minutes to make him stop..i'm good at making babies stop their tantrums..well i let him cry for a few minutes then i calmed him down by talking to him and saying things to make him feel good..and eventually he listened to me and calmed down..so that's what happened today and tomorrow i got to go to another party..  oh yeah tomorrow is also FATHER'S DAY..so i got to wake up early to greet our dad and to give him his present..i wonder how he reacts when he sees what mama has in store for him!!!..i also got to wake up at 5 am to go jogging with my lil sis..because we want to be in shape for ourself and what better way to do that than during summer vacation..and in case you were wondering why my lil sis is my jogging partner..it is easy because i'm the only one who will work her to the best that she can perform and not get her mad at me at all..and also she said she wants to get some exercise and what better way to do that..is by me!!! well nighty nite or should i say good morning?
