      God I had a shitty day today. I'm exhausted, depressed, my head hurts, my jaw hurts (for various reasons, which I can go into later). But, I just did a few lines of coke, and my spirits have been miraculously uplifted! And I'm getting hornier by the second. Nice.  Now I think I'll take a shower; I took one this morning, but when I have shitty days, I like to rinse the day away...

      Seriously though, when you love caffeine as much as I do, can you honestly say you haven't ever thought about this?   urlLink Caffiato Ad Gets Too Close to Cocaine   a more detailed version from  urlLink Yahoo! news   the  urlLink product website , where you can see a larger image of the actual ad

      My week has been crazy, hence the lack of posts the past few days. After firing Ashanti on Wednesday, I was pretty stressed out - I started feeling kind of bad in a way. I was quickly talked out of that though.  I talked to my dad later that night, with whom my relationship is a bit strained, to say the least. That is a whole other series of posts, though. Basically he wasn't really around or helping out when I was growing up, and I can count the number of times I've seen him or talked to him in the past few years on my right hand. We've been trying to "renew our relationship" lately - I talked to him on my birthday about a month ago, and since then we've been exchanging emails and we've talked on the phone a few more times. But Wednesday night I started feeling like I was five (5) [hah] years old all over again. He was making me feel like a small child, incapable of understanding the world around me. "Cherry, your mom called last week, but don't tell her I'm telling you. This will be our little secret." No, those weren't his exact words of course, but that was the gist; I couldn't even say how many times I actually did hear him tell me that as I was growing up, though. Dude, don't put me in the middle like that. Don't fucking talk shit about my mom, she's the one that always there for me every single day, she didn't just drop in now and again when she felt like being a parent for a week or something. Shit man.  I did get pretty fucked up later Wednesday night, though, and ended up fucking...  ...and then woke up Thursday morning being fucked. Not that I minded or anything. I had given him permission the night before.  Friday Zed left for Las Vegas - his best friend is getting married soon, and he's the best man and planned this huge bachelor party in Vegas with like 40 people and multiple strippers. Sounds fun, right? I guess Friday morning as he was getting ready to leave he got a call from the coroner's office. Apparently someone Zed had been trying to get in touch with all week to make sure he was still coming to the party was found dead in his house. I wasn't really close to this guy, but I knew him, and was really shaken up when Zed called to tell me. Really freaky. No one knew the cause of death, but his friends suspect it had something to do with too much alcohol and too much oxy. I'm definitely not doing oxy again, at least not for a long while. The saddest part to me about the whole thing is he was at home, alone, and dead for like a week before anyone found him. The neighbors had called the cops because of the smell emanating from the house. I just keep thinking, "what if that happened to me??" Man. Scary.  I had to work all through that too, which sucks.  Work sucks.  I went to IKEA on Friday night with my coworkers (there were four of us), just to get myself out of the house.  I hung out with some friends last night after work too, so that was cool.  Zed is gone until like super late tonight, so who knows if I will even see him.  It was ridiculous to me how much I missed him yesterday, considering we "aren't together."  Yeah, whatever.  I hope he didn't fuck any sluts in Vegas.  Plans for today?  None so far.  Any ideas?  So far I have shower, get high, and clean on my list.  Oh, and walk to town to get myself a latte...fucking caffeine.  I love that shit too much.  I wish Starbucks just sold packages of needles filled with caffeine injections.  I would definitely buy me a few of those.

      Fuck, I hate that. I was lighting my bowl and taking a hit...and then I noticed I somehow burned my fingernail in the process. Goddammit. Not only did I fuck my nail up, but it smells worse than burning hair. Fucking shitass.

      So...I just got home from work a little while ago. I ate some leftover fries from lunch and now I'm crushing up some oxycontin. Yay! I'm almost out of weed, but I'm going to get more later tonight - so, I have nothing to worry about! In fact, let me pack a bowl right now...  I'm supposed to get some coke tonight, too. Hopefully I'll also get some cock, it's been a few days. I love having sex while high on coke, it's awesome. I also love having sex while coke is being snorted off of my naked body, it's a huge turn-on. Mmmm. I get a little wet just thinking about it...  Work. Work was productive today. Showed up on time, at 11am, with my friend/coworker Jane - she picked me up from Zed's apartment. Then my boss and I proceeded to fire another coworker, Ashanti. That took about an hour, and Ashanti left crying. Even Dawn (my boss) almost cried. I was happy to see her leave, she never does any fucking work anyways, and she always has something to complain about. Good riddance, I say. "But Cherry smokes weed in the back yard!" Ashanti said during our discussion.  "We aren't talking about her, I've already talked to her about that. We're talking about you," said Dawn.  Ashanti had also said something about me doing coke in the bathroom. No, she doesn't know if that's true or not, but everyone seems to believe it's not. Thank god. That's the last thing I want people knowing about me.  Ooh, I just felt that rush through my body of the oxy kicking in. Yum.

      Home early today - got to leave work a little bit before my scheduled time since we weren't that busy, and there were five (!) of us working, when there are usually like two or three. There were five because four people were scheduled already, and then we hired a new person on Saturday, so we scheduled her to come in today. She's pretty cool, I like her so far.  Smoking a bowl - nice and relaxed, not rushed like before I leave for work and not paranoid like when I sneak out to smoke behind my building at work. Kush. Now I'm really stoned...too bad I only have like two bowls of this weed left. And I'm about to pack one of them. Goddammit.  I wish I had some coke. That would be awesome.  I ate Indian food for lunch - chicken tikka masala. It was very good, and very spicy. Yummm. Talked with my boss about our coworker who seems to be causing a lot of problems lately. It's pretty annoying, actually. Definitely not an environment I want to be a part of...

      I'm so sick of my job.  I've gotten several calls today from different people that work there (of course, I was asleep the whole time, as I didn't wake up until after 6pm).  It's difficult working with a staff of just women - there's always something to gossip or be catty about.  Sigh.  I'm almost out of coke and weed.  Fuck.  I can get more weed (although what I have now is my favorite, and there isn't any left to buy, so fuck), and more coke probably won't be around for a few more days.  Maybe that's good though...
