       check out this article i lifted from the english version of the chosun ilbo. first of all, it reads like a 3rd grader's book. second, gentle feminine and QUIET???? third... korean women AREN'T materialistic and they're submissive and kind??? wtf are they talking about!!!!!!      there are exceptions, of course, but almost all korean women i know (and i can say this cuz i'm korean) ARE SOOOO materialistic! that's ALL they think about!!!! and most are bitches. 'specially here in LA.      i resent this article... to think it came from my own people!!!! i think i'm going to vomit:     What is it about Korean Women that Western Men Like?  We know that Korean-American Alice Kim (Korean name: Kim Yong-gyeong) willmarry Hollywood star Nicolas Cage in June. Kim’s uncle, an executive at acredit agency, said in an interview with a Korean daily paper that, “I understand that Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage will marry in June.” This marriage may be postponed, however; Cage is leaving for Africa in July toshoot his new film, “Lord of War.”  Why are American film stars into Korean women? Kenny, an executive at a LAKoreatown broadcasting company, said in an interview with a Koreanbroadcaster that, “Korean women are submissive and kind. They are known to make breakfast, lunch and dinner for their husbands, help their husbandswell, and raise children well." There are also those who feel that in the eyes of Western men, East Asian women possess a sort of mysteriousness about them. They say that one can grow fond of the unknown “Orient."  24-year-old James Cecil, an American living in Korea, said, “Even Koreanwomen who are not though of as pretty by Korean men can give a sense of mystery to Western men.” 29-year-old English teacher Mike Conforty said,“Korean women are gentle, feminine and quiet. I think Korean women are theprettiest of all East Asian women.”  Western men also seem to find the purity and conservativeness of Koreanwomen attractive. 25-year-old USFK soldier Blake Selesnew said, “Americanwomen are too materialistic, but Korean women aren’t. They seem less snobby.” Korea University English instructor Zane Ivy said, “Korean women are conservative. They are conscience of what people around them think,depend on their families and parents and are submissive.”  Before Alice Kim and Nicolas Cage, other Hollywood couples with Koreanwomen included Wesley Snipes and Nikki Park and Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn. Less well known was “About Schmidt” director Alexander Payne’smarriage last year to Korean-Canadian actress Sandra Oh. Meanwhile, WoodyAllen attended a literature event last October in Frankfurt, Germany andsaid he would write an autobiography containing the story of how he splitfrom long-time lover Mia Farrow and fell in love and married Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn.

       so, my brother is going to some school in mexico for "bad kids." i really hope this works for him. i doubt if he'll become a completely different person, but i'm hoping that he'll change for the better...      he's used to be so adorable and he used to love me so much. *sigh* so sad what's happened to him.      he's just this little monster now. it's unbelievable. he's got a worse temper than even me!!!! and he just doesn't appreciate anything he has or anything he's been given.      the worst part about it is that he's really bright. or, well, he used to be. i don't even know him anymore.       he's not allowed to talk to anyone, except faculty and staff for 2 whole months. crazy, huh? and he's not allowed to see the girls at the school for 7 months. my parents can't even visit him for 6 months. i really hope that he gains a sense of responsibility and gets some common sense while he's there.       oh, and man clogs are a required part of the uniform there... so they can't run away. hehehe... hehehehe.... i just got a funny ass visual of my brother trying to run away in clogs.      i hope it helps him, cuz it's expensive enough!!! that and i just don't want him to be all lost growing up. i don't care if he makes $10K a year or if he even goes to college or whatever. i just hope he turns into a real person. he's like an animal right now...      my parents are driving him down today. the other day my dad went down there to check it out. he was on the road for 11 hours. sheesh. i hope they have a safe trip back.

       so, it's a little after 7 and i'm here... apparently for no reason because i have NOTHING in my email inbox. i was supposed to get some reporting before i got in this morning (since the other people are on the east coast)... but i don't see shit. not only that, but my contact with them is here on the west coast. which means, i'm going to be sitting around twiddling my thumbs until at least 8:30.     &nbsp;  what a load of bullshit.    &nbsp;  my only consolation is that it's friday... and the best radio on the planet has really, really great programming today....  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/ &nbsp;well, it's the best radio i know about. i'm sure there's great pirate radio stations. actually, the good programming doesn't start till later... but you can listen to last week's broadcasts.     &nbsp;  i'm just so tired... was at B&E's last night... till like, 11. yeah, i'm a big ol' baby :) so sleepy! hehe...    &nbsp;  change of topic here... last year was the first year i'd ever heard of "june gloom." and last year was the first year i'd ever experienced it. apparently, when you live by the beach, it's always there... but this year, here it is, the end of july and we've had july gloom for most of the month. what's going on??? i hope that doesn't mean that this august and september are going to be particularly brutal....

       sometimes, i really feel like i work with some mentally handicapped people. if i had the patience, maybe i would've. i was under the impression that i would work with people who had IQs over, say, 25.    &nbsp;  i have to explain EVERYTHING to them... ALL SLOW.... because they don't seem to understand what's going on .... at least half the time, i could prolly lie to them and they'd believe it. friggin' sheep.     &nbsp;  talking that slowly really, really, really irks me. i don't have the patience for this bullshit. i need a new job...     &nbsp;  time to make those 'i hate stan' pins :P

       so, this morning, we're listening to an old tape steve has... some amnesty international concert... the police (the last time they performed as 'the police' no less) and u2.     &nbsp;  u2 covers a bob dylan song... something about maggie's farm or something. i dunno... anyway, the crowd is going effin' NUTS...     &nbsp;  i asked harold why people like bob dylan. i just assumed he did because he likes the oldies and the classic rock. he didn't know. (thanks, harold... thanks for nothin'!) he said he wasn't really a big fan of bob dylan. he assumes the people of that generation like him because it reminds them of "a simpler time" ... okay. sure... i could buy that... but ... what about the people who didn't grow up with him and still love him?    &nbsp;  i just don't get it.

       yay! i love this game! one of the cutest games ever... :)    Captain Olimar returns to marshal new Pikmin in a wild, open-ended adventure-and he brought help this time! Captaim Olimar has returned to the planet where the Pikmin live, and he's all business this time. The company he works for is going bankrupt, so to save it, Olimar must salvage the treasure buried all over the planet. His company's debt is a whopping 10,000 pokos- luckily, Olimar brought an assistant, so if the two of them can delegate their work well, they should be able to erase that debt in no time! Of course, they'll need the help of the Pikmin to do that, these two can't do anything by themselves. Alternate controlling the main characters-Olimar and his assistant- as you command your Pikmin to defeat enemies, propate more Pikmin, collect precious doodads, and solve puzzles. With no time limit, new colors of Pikmin, and two-player cooperative play, Pikmin 2 improves on the original in every way.

       so, i had another dream about mel and her wedding last night. i swear, i can't wait until it's over with. sheesh.    &nbsp;  maybe it's cuz i talked to maria last night. makes me think about it. you know, it's sad that everything's turning out so ghetto. from everything i've heard, this isn't exactly a dream wedding. heh.    &nbsp;  i dreamt that i was at the reception (maria actually wanted me to go as her guest. please. hehehe. i don't need that drama! and hyuni wanted me to go so she could bring greg. wtf is wrong with these ppl??? hehehe)    &nbsp;  anyway, the reception was so sad... and his family was so ghetto. i'd be interested to see if her wedding and reception looks like my dream. i have a feeling it will. :P hehehe

       so, i get these nightmares every once in a while. about psycho... i hate that he still gets into my dreams. i wish he'd just die. now i know that's not a very nice thing to say, but his existence is pretty much useless.&nbsp;all he will ever do is hurt people that he thinks he loves. i used to think, as long as it's not me, i don't care what he does. but, now, i do care. i hope he's not hurting anyone else. i hope he's crippled, maimed, injured, whatever. i hope he gets caught stealing in the middle east somewhere so they chop his hands off... i hope that a group of thugs beat him up, i hope someone crazy glues his legs together and then beats him with a baseball bat, i hope that he suffers. not because i hate him, but because he deserves it. because that's how much pain he's inflicted on others. not just me, but other people... his family, his ex-girlfriends... everyone he comes into contact with...     &nbsp;   i dunno. i'm over the fear of running into him. but he still enters my dreams. it's awful. i think part of that has to do with mel marrying stan (or as jules is always mistyping: satan)... i just see what she's turned into and it upsets me. i see how i used to be and it's frightening. (for the record, i don't think stan's beating her or anything. i just think he's very manipulative, controlling, and possessive.)    &nbsp;  he should embrace her for who she is and if she wants to change for herself for the better, she should do it. not change into a mindless girl without an opinion for him. he should accept her for who she is. not expect her to change. can you believe she said: i have so many things to change now i can't keep track???? how effed up is that? you know something's wrong with the relationship if someone says that...    &nbsp;  i&nbsp;wish her luck. i'm sorry i had to end our 12 year friendship, but he was going to end it anyway... but i guess it doesn't really matter anyway... i don't know her anymore... and it's a shame.     &nbsp;  anyway, whatever. steve's taking me to seattle and vancouver the weekend of her wedding. hehe... maybe i'm just lucky to have found a unique and great guy. maybe most boys out there are like stan. scary. maybe i've forgotten since i've been out of the dating loop for a few years now... maybe i'm used to being spoiled by steve? i dunno.    &nbsp;  and for&nbsp;those&nbsp;judging me&nbsp;who think that she was there for me while i was with psycho, so i should be there for her at her wedding, i only have this to say: she was there for me before psycho and after psycho. not during. and yes, part of that's my fault because i pushed people away, but that's also because she was always judging me, not understanding why i couldn't get out of that relationship. it's so much more complex than that. i&nbsp; hope&nbsp;she's realizing that now... but, i doubt it. i gave her too much credit. she's not that understanding or bright and i'm realizing that now... (so, what does that say about me???)     &nbsp;  well, good luck to my friends who are stuck being in that wedding. i'm just&nbsp;relieved i got out :)

       so, without getting into any sort of political talk or anything, for the record, (and i think that even some of my conservative friends&nbsp;would&nbsp;agree) i believe that ann coulter is crazy. or as one of my repub friends say, "she's a little fringe." now... only a conservative would characterize&nbsp;this as "fringe." i consider it psycho rantings of a very strange and sad little woman:    &nbsp;  this is how her article for usa today started. thank god the editors of that publication had the good sense to nix her article. and yes, it was probably an opinion column, but it still doesn't excuse it. good lord, at least it could be funny... without making everyone cringe:    &nbsp; Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazened with the "F-word" are my opponents.&nbsp; Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling.   so, that's the first paragraph... directly from her site: anncoulter.com    this is another favorite of mine, again lifted directly from her site:   As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the UN Security Council's approval.&nbsp; Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention.   i shit you not. she wrote this for a newspaper... what was she thinking?     &nbsp;  i can't believe that any rational adult would actually write these things... so i'm guessing either she doesn't really believe it and she's doing it for the attention... or she's crazy... i'm sorry... but, this woman seriously, seriously needs to get her meds upped. maybe she can call rush limbaugh for a referral. :P

       seriously, why do men (and i use that term very, very loosely) at work think it's okay to interrupt you to flirt? i have NO interest in flirting with them. and the married ones are the worst! they have this fucked up idea that because now i'm married and since they're married, it's okay to flirt with&nbsp;me because now i have something to lose, too... men are such pricks, sometimes!    &nbsp;  damn, and to think that i thought getting married would fix this problem.     &nbsp;  wtfever.     &nbsp;  whew. good thing i'm a fast typer. or else i'd never get any work done in between blogging :P hehehe

       so, yesterday, i got a compliment on my watch. and i told the guy, i'll call him frank, that i got it for Wife Appreciation Week. now, wife appreciation week is an invention of steve's... for some reason, every once in a while, he starts sending me gifts in the mail, etc... (yes, i know. i have the best husband in the world!) anyway... so frank starts giving me a hard time about it.     &nbsp;   frank: why do you get gifts? what do you get him?    me: hey, i cook and clean!    frank: YOU? clean????    me: what's that supposed to mean?    frank: you just don't look like the type...    me: what's that supposed to mean?    f: you're high maintenance...    me: what??? you don't even know me!!! how can you say i'm high maintenance! i totally clean!    f: (laughing) i just don't see you cleaning... and scrubbing toilets (still laughing)    me: wtf is that supposed to mean? i'm not high maintenance!     &nbsp;   what a jackass. am i high maintenance? maybe in some ways, but not the way he's saying i am. i mean, you should see my nails... i never go shopping, i wear almost no makeup... how could he possibly say i'm high maintenance? steve says it's cuz i'm cute and have boobies. wtf is that supposed to mean?     &nbsp;   well, fuck frank and his stupid comments. he doesn't know me for shit...     &nbsp;   speaking of stupid shit frank says, one day he and this other guy, "chris" were at my cube talking like they're SOOOO enlightened and laughing about how some people still refer to asians as orientals. now, i'm korean, and i really don't care if someone calls me oriental. it's just that it's not that important to me.     &nbsp;   f: my uncle called my wife oriental (his wife is filipino, btw) and she said: "i'm not a RUG"    c: (laughing in disbelief) i can't believe he said that!!!    f: i know! it was so embarrassing!    c: (still laughing in disbelief) i can't believe some people     now, keep in mind, these are 2 white guys....    me: it really doesn't matter. who really cares? asian, oriental, whatever. and for the record, if you really wanna get technical about it, your wife isn't exactly asian, either. she's a pacific islander.     f: oh, well, she doesn't really care, either...    me: oh, yes, she does. she wouldn't have made that "joke" otherwise!    f: *blushing* kinda changing the subject... yeah... okay... and then he started talking about work.    yeah... 1 - grace, 0&nbsp;- stupid work boy.    hey, why is this double spacing every time i push "enter" now???? weird....

       omg! i did something really stupid yesterday. i wrote to tom beland because i felt soooo stupid about what a dumbass i was on saturday talking to him... (stupid deed&nbsp;+ stupid deed = ???) then i really felt like banging my head up against the wall. i mean, i have a tendency to write letters to people, but then i never actually send them. i just usually feel better just by having it written down... but this time i actually pushed the send button...    &nbsp;  anyway, yesterday, i was telling steve on the way home that i did&nbsp;a stupid thing and he laughed and said it was 'cute'... :( ugh. and i was hoping he just didn't get my email... maybe thinking it was spam or something...    &nbsp;  but he wrote me back!i couldn't believe it! and what a nice ego-stroking email it was, too.... anyway, i'm so relieved he didn't think i was a complete dumbass... or maybe he was just being nice to me cuz he felt sorry for me. hehe...

       there's this guy here at work... we'll call him... Jackass. anyway,&nbsp;Jackass is a frickin' stalker. he doesn't know when to leave people alone and he doesn't know when they're annoyed by him. i can't even make eye contact when he comes to talk to me, even if it's about work because he's so damned annoying...     &nbsp;   he's right in front of my cubicle right now. i'm not listening to a word he's saying. i'm just saying, "uh-huh, uh-huh," and looking at my screen as i'm typing... and he's still talking. even if it's about work, it's completely and totally useless.     &nbsp;   wtf does he want? everyone hates him. when will he realize this? good lord, go away... yes, yes. you have a good evening, too, Jackass. phew! finally. sheesh.     &nbsp;   jackass.

       so, my friend, jules and i used to have an excel spreadsheet of boys we were boinging, operations we were running (operation effe 'em and leave 'em) etc... i just found it again the other day.   ahhh, the good ol' days...    &nbsp;  what a bunch of floozies we were... hussies, even. hehe...    &nbsp;  but, as carefree as those days were, i don't miss it. i'm much better off this way. the hubby takes good care of me. heh heh.    &nbsp;  that file went into the trash can. i hope the IT guys can't find it on my system. heh. i'd just DIE.

       this is from salon.com... one of the best content sites on the Web. everyone should subscribe so they can continue to give us quality reporting... like this from their gossip column, "the fix" ...     &nbsp;    Is Pierce Brosnan too old to play 007? After the actor griped that the Bond flicks were getting too "formulaic" -- and began stumping for more plot-centric and less special-effects-laden material -- Bond producers are said to have come around to his way of thinking. But word is they're also thinking Bond, younger Bond, and may replace the 51-year-old Brosnan with Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Colin Firth, Clive Owen, Jude Law, Ewan McGregor, Gerard Butler or Cuba Gooding Jr.     &nbsp;   mmm, yeah. they can't possibly be serious about cuba, could they? lord, i hope not.     &nbsp;   speaking of jude law, i saw him at comic-con 2004. good lord, he's dreamy. he was with giovanni ribisi... mmmm.... mmmm... mmmm... okay. i'm all right now. at any rate, they were there stumping for their new flick "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." i love them more than i hate gwyneth paltrow (female lead), so i'll go see it... also, angelina jolie is in it... and she's in an eyepatch. how cool is that???? heh...     &nbsp;   comic-con was pretty effin' amazing this year. i got to see a couple of my fave artists... craig thompson (blankets - absolutely amazing graphic novel), chynna clugston-major (blue monday), and tom beland (true story: swear to god)... tom beland was really nice and down to earth... i got all tongue-tied, so i figure he thinks i'm a stuck up bitch. oh well. his book made me cry, it was so darn cute... i'm sure he hears that all the time, though. he drew me a sketch in my book i bought.... he inked it and everything. it was pretty nice... i still feel like a&nbsp;big ol' dumbass... i was just such a moron... yes, i'm a self-flagellator. but, i just feel so dumb still :( damn.&nbsp;i hate when i don't know what to say... :(     &nbsp;   uhm, who else... who else... frank miller, robert rodriguez and some of the lovely ladies of "Sin City" were there to promote their flick. that looks like it's going to be hot! jaime king, rosario dawson, and jessica alba are gonna be in it... it looks like it's going to be kept really close to the source material... if you've not read frank miller's sin city stories, you absolutely have to. just classic.     &nbsp;   matt stone/trey parker promoting their new marionette movie - team america: world police. that looks like it's just going to be comedy. i can't wait to watch it... the bad guy in the movie is kim jong il... i nearly pissed myself laughing so hard during the clips they were showing us... so, lessee... what else???     &nbsp;   miles and miles of exhibitors, tons of free stuff... more geeks than you ever imagined you'd ever see... the first year i went, i was overwhelmed... but, every year it gets bigger and bigger...     &nbsp;   it's funny, the first time i went (3 years ago) i was pretty scared. i mean, there were people there that i've never actually seen in public! guys that actually looked like the simpsons' comic book guy. and guys that look like they've never seen sun ... seems most people were very overweight or very skinny... and they're all in their element... so if you were a girl there, they tried to hit on you. i'm not trying to be mean or rude or anything, but boy... it was pretty sad... my husband (boyfriend at the time) let me get a drink of water by myself... by the time i got to the water fountain, there were 3 boys following me and another crowd just staring at me... i actually hadn't noticed until i bent over to take a drink from the fountain and my eye caught the 3 boys leaning over trying to catch a glimpse of cleavage or something... i was a little freaked out.     &nbsp;   now, i don't care anymore. this last time i wore a school girl skirt that was cut so short, i actually thought it was a belt when i was in the store... har! Forever 21 rawks!

       my boss is really cool.... but, as cool as he is, it's even cooler when he's out on vacation. he was out all last week.&nbsp;i seriously think&nbsp;i got about 4 hours of work in ... all week. but he's back now. *sigh* this morning, he had me print out 377 pages of Fantasy Football Insights. uhm... yeah. it's nice that he's put me back to good use...

      i hate going to the bathroom at work. first of all, i have a problem with peeing if anyone can hear me. i got over it after years at boarding school, but still, i'm kinda  urlLink self-conscious . i might not be THAT bad, but i have a slight shyness of relieving myself in hearing range of others...  but besides that, i swear, at least once a day, i hear someone... no, wait... i DON'T hear someone washing their hands when they leave. it's SO gross. i think that when you unlock the door, something should spray your hand or something so that you'll HAVE to wash your hands when you leave... i mean, jeezus... that's just disgusting... so, when i leave the restroom, i always open the door with the paper towel that i dried my hands on ... blech. wtf is wrong with these people, anyway????

      i signed up for 3 upcoming cooking classes :) it's for holiday cooking or something to that effect.  anyway, we're going to do christmas dinner this year (well, the family doesn't know that yet, but we will offer to do it... it'd be better that way...) - and i figured i probably need to learn how to cook holiday stuff american style...  koreans will just have a turkey, maybe some mashed potatoes and kimchee and other veggies and then lots of other korean side dishes... hehe... i don't think that would go over very well with steve's family... in fact, i think they'd die.  so, hopefully, the classes'll be fun...  i'm always swearing i'm going to take a class, but i never do... maybe next time i'll get the guts to sign up for belly dancing class! i really want to... i'm just a damned wuss. i can't sign up on my own.

      why are the women's beach volleyball outfits so skimpy, but the men's not? i think the men should have to wear teeny, tiny little speedos... not that i enjoy looking at men in speedos, but it's only fair.  speaking of the olympics, i haven't been following it at all, but i saw some pics on yahoo... is it me or are the women's gymnastics teams super creepy to look at? i think it's wrong that they make them seem like little girls... and i think it's even more wrong that most of them ARE little girls. i think they need to fix the gymnastics stuff so that real women can compete, instead of having little girls compete. these are children, for chrissakes... let them be children. damn.

      last night i was adamant about unlocking stuff on karaoke revolution. so i got on and unlocked a bunch of outfits and a couple of venues and a song... (i got a couple of really cute outfits for naoko - my little japanese character)... the great thing about this game is that you can totally suck ass but still get platinum record status... woohoo! but expert level is super hard. even on the easy songs. bastards.  at any rate, steve just told me at lunch that Monkey hated my singing cuz she ran into the home today and ripped the cord apart for the headset. damn. now i have to go and buy another mic. thank god for amazon.  damn that bunny. she's so cute, but so, so bad. sheesh. oh well. i was gonna get a different mic, anyway.

      i have this little dinosaur puppet at home... he's a t-rex. we call him rex. anyway, i'm kinda partial to t-rexes... he's got this little sound thingie in his head and when you squeeze his head, he roars 3 times... it's kinda cool.  then i started wondering...  how do other religions explain the rise and fall of the dinosaur? the SDAs are kinda crazy, and i think some of them think that the people in noah's time were very scientifically advanced and they did some genetic experiments and that's where the dinos came from... and then god flooded the whole earth to get rid of the scourge of the earth. and that would explain why carbon dating claims the world is millions and millions of years old when the bible claims that the world is only 6000 (give or take a thousand years). that doesn't explain why the fastest dinos wouldn't have their bones only in the mountains... or do they think that the flood messed everything up? i dunno...  so, anyone have any other crazy religious explanations? just curious.

      no offense to parents... but your baby is probably only cute to you. don't get me wrong. i love kids. i love to hold them and play with them... and then i like to return them to the parents...  don't make us feel all obligated to tell you your baby's cute when your baby's just SO not cute...  i'm hearing this parent in another cube showing off his pics of his baby girl to another co-worker. i've seen this baby in person. she's hideous! when people think a baby is just cute because she's a baby, that's bullshit. there are ugly babies and there are cute babies.  i already know with all this shit i'm talking we're going to have an ugly ass kid (sorry, steve)... and i will of course subject anyone who looks at my blog (as well as anyone i come into contact with) to pictures and the daily goings on of my child... (omg, she's soooo smart, do you know what she did yesterday???? blah, blah, blah) i have no doubt i will be expecting people to tell me my child is cute... but until this happens and we have kids, i'm going to continue to talk shit about ugly babies.  just because they're little, it doesn' t make them cute. make him shut the fuck up! i can still hear him... there's just no blocking it out... and i hear all the women cooing and oohing and aaaahing. i can't possibly be the ONLY person here at work that thinks his child is ugly as sin!!! J, your child is hideously ugly. she's an exact replica of YOU. she has your nose... it's even the same size as your nose... holy god... i DON'T CARE that they go to gymboree class twice a week and swimming lessons. holy crap.  i think that these people who want to talk about their children should NOT subject other people to this bullshit. they need to take it outside or into an office or something. i could understand it if someone ASKED him about his girl... NOBODY ASKED!!!! he just busted out a pic and started talking about her. i'm going to strangle somebody.

      i wish i could stay home... this guy lives in our neighborhood... and he NEVER works. i swear to god. he is always there... throwing parties, having the hos over...  where does he get his money from????  he has bbq's every weekend... and during the week, too... he knows everyone in the neighborhood, he listens to mariah carey LOUD on the weekends... he has people over for sporting events... i mean, it's not like he's old and retired.... what, did he win the lottery or something?  but, wtf does he do? i don't know his name... but i don't want to start talking to him because i don't want him to know that i'm completely jealous of his lifestyle... and i definitely don't want him thinking i'm interested in anything about him...  you know how boys are... if you talk to them, they think you want them. and he always listens to his music loud... and boys only do that because they want attention. so i try extra hard not to pay him any attention because boys are stupid...  steve wants to be him when he grows up. hehe...  but, damn. i wish i knew what he did... so i can do it, too... then i can stay home all day lollygagging :D and bbq'ing... and working out... and having hos over and partying :P  he's prolly in porn.  speaking of which... a real porn guy does live in our neighborhood... he was always trying to get steve and me over to check out some of his "films." hehehe... he wanted to know if i wanted to "try out." what a freak. "  steve looks like a porn guy  ." what a moron. hehehe...  this post is making it sound like i live in some seedy area. i really don't. i live in suburbia's suburbs...

      CHIROPRACTOR!  holy god. i feel at least 50% better...  yesterday, i could barely walk... just going to my car put me in tears. the chiro said that he couldn't really crack me that well because my muscles were so tight around my spine. he cracked my back a little bit and then he sent me in to get this kickass massage. it was fabulous... i was moaning and groaning.... and drooling...  anyway, then he took me and cracked my back. dude, i'm all misaligned. it's gross. at least now my feet point straight up now. they were all leaning to the right when i was lying down on my back... my shoulders are all fucked up, too....  went home, did the ice treatment and miracle of all miracles, i could move my neck and i could fall asleep without tossing and turning to look for a comfortable enough position to sleep in.  went back in this morning for another treatment. got cracked again (god, i love that shit) and then got another massage... ahhhh... i love that deep tissue massage... he even massaged my head... i actually have volumized hair now. hehe... i've never had volume in my hair! hehe...  i need more massages!!!! more!!!! i don't know if i'm going to get another one on thursday or not. they said something about teaching me exercises. damn :( oh well. 2 massages for a total of $30? not bad :D  they were saying i was one of the tightest people they've ever worked on... they prolly say that to all the girls :P huh huh.

      my mom found this "toy" in my bro's room... they left it at my place to see if i could identify it.  i got home this morning and looked at it. at first, i couldn't figure it out... although, i thought it was a little weird that there was a pic of bob marley on the front... and the batteries were almost dead, so it was kind hard to tell...  and then i looked at the teeny tiny little writing... the thing is a miniature scale.... i'm guessing it's for weed... hopefully not for anything harder than that...  but, can anyone tell me if it's for weighing it so he doesn't get screwed when he buys it from someone? or is it for weighing cuz he's selling it??? hrm... whatever. he's out in bumblefuck right now, so he has no use for it... he's so dumb. how is it that he continuously gets caught?  that's why girls seem so evil. (well, we are evil, too...) because they don't get caught. that's because we    think shit through   . he's such a fucking idiot. how could he possibly be related to me????  scheisse.

      holy god. i'm tired. i woke up at 2:30 this morning so i could get back here... to work. yay. ufff.  so, the weekend was good... saturday we got these great massages... they come to your house (or hotel or wherever you're staying)... i got this guy (cuz i said i didn't care if it was male or female... i'm guessing female masseuses are more popular...) anyway, he was from ukraine... or croatia.... wait... both. whatever. he tried to hook me up with his friend, who was korean, as well. how friggin' hilarious. besides the fact that i'm married, i don't like korean guys. i can't help it. most of them are just not attractive to me. maybe because i can't help but think of my dad and my bro. gross. blech. but, at any rate, i could've had a date on saturday night! hot damn! steve, you're cramping my style! :P hehehe... hehehehe. i'm funny.  then we went to this GREAT tapas place in downtown napa. downtown napa used to suck ass as far as getting good food. all the good food was in yountville or st. helena or calistoga... but now, downtown napa has good food, too :D we ate waaaaaayyy too much... eating tapas reminded me of when we were in barcelona... and we were starving... and we had tapas... sooo good... until i saw the cockroach just hanging out near the food. i almost had a heartattack... but i tried to play it cool because i didn't want them to think i was just another wussy american. hehe. but, really i wanted to scream and cry all at the same time. anyway, the ambience was different, but it was still really great...  then, we went back to jeaneil's and we played the BEST game in the whole widest world! KARAOKE REVOLUTION!!!! hehehe. it was great... we even got jonny to sing a song. hehehe. and he NEVER sings. EVER. it was unbelievable. jeaneil didn't want to play... but after a couple of drinks, we couldn't get her to stop. she was the little platinum record queen. it was funny... jules was a good sport... hehehe... we kept on picking these songs for her when she wasn't paying attention. hehehehe. it was funny as hell...  jules and jonny started doing shots... and they (by they, i mean jonny) gave me a hard time for not doing any shots with them... i couldn't help it! i was full! i ate WAY too much! so, being the sucker for peer pressure that i am, i took a shot against my better judgement. first of all, it was a shot of SMIRNOFF. call me a snob, but i NEVER drink SMIRNOFF... EVER. (unless it's a horrible well drink at a bar and i have no money for anything better...) it's just disgusting. especially for shots. blech. second, i was really, really full... so, i take a shot and i swear, it was just stuck in my throat and i'm trying my hardest to swallow (huh huh... swallow) and make it to the fridge to get some water or ANYTHING to chase it down with, but i can barely see because my eyes are watering so bad... and i can barely breathe because i feel like my chest is on FIRE. good lord. i'm never doing that again...  and jonny kept trying to get jules and me to make out. what's wrong with him, anyway? sheesh... if you're gonna make out with someone, it can't be a friend. it would just be friggin' weird. stupid, stupid boy.  at 2am, we ended up calling larry. wtf is wrong with us? i'm all, uhm... were you sleeping? and then i forgot what else i said to him... then jules talked to him. i have no idea why we even called.      so, larry, if you read this... i'm sorry! i was going to say we're sorry... but i have no idea if they are or not :P      then we went to the wedding on sunday. it was nice. abigail's dress was a much nicer version of mel's dress. hehe. and i'm not just saying that cuz mel and i aren't on speaking terms. ask jules. she'll tell you :P hehehe... and despite the location of the wedding, it was actually quite nice. the only problem was that there was NO ALCOHOL. that's right. you read that correctly... i wanted to die...  i ran into an ex at brabigail's wedding. (brad + abigail = brabigail... see? i'm effin' funny)... he was really weird. i didn't think we broke up on bad terms, really... but he's always been really weird around me the 2 or 3 times we've seen each other... we dated when i was 15 or something like that. he's weird. anyway, this is what happened:   me: hey, what's up? (reaching out for a hug)   ex: hey, (no hug) grace... this is isabel (or whatever her name was... i think it was isabel.)   me: (pretending like i wasn't leaning in for a hug) hi! it's nice to meet you!   gf: nice to meet you!   me: sooo, where'd you meet?   blah, blah, blah...   ex: (giving me a hug) oh, so when did that happen? (pointing at my ring)   me: almost 2 years ago...   blah, blah, blah....   like, what... it's okay for him to give me a hug because i'm married? guys are so retarded.   this is what should've happened:   me: hey, what's up? (reaching out for a hug)   ex: hey (giving me a hug) how're you? (or "nice to see you" or something to that effect...)   me: i'm fine...   ex: this is my gf isabel...   blah, blah, blah   what a fucking retard. he made it unnecessarily uncomfortable. now she thinks something's up, i'm sure... so retarded. guys are STUPID MFs.  anyway, i was going to post pics, but i can't get my stupid, stupid computer to read the sd card. piece of shit. it wouldn't work for shit this morning. my computer wouldn't turn on, then it just shut off once, then it just rebooted on its own. i need a new system. why is my company so cheap?! i mean, we make these things for god's sake.  i'll have to post pics later.... jules does good eyeshadow on herself. :) and for some reason, she refuses to teach me :P it's prolly for the best. i'd fuck it up. hehe... one day, though... i will have pretty eye makeup. yes, i will....  i'm fucking delirious right now. i only got about 3 hours of sleep last night... and my neck is killing me. i'm too old for this shit. no more driving for me.  i'm going to try to get to a chiropractor or something. this is bullshit.

      so, i'm finally in napa now. it took me 8 damn hours to drive up here. i'm getting too old for this shit. next time i'm flying.  my neck is killing me. thank god we're getting massages today. woohoo! i NEED it.  i'm with jeaneil and her 3 kids. they're so cute. they get really wound up. it's funny. but then jeaneil uses her mommy voice. and then i get scared. and i didn't even do anything wrong. hehe...  so, woohoo! i'm still cute! i totally got hit on when i was driving up by myself. hehe. i forget. no one even looks at me when i'm with steve. hehe... little do these guys know that he'd pimp me out for the right price any day :P hehehe...  speaking of steve, i'm worried. he hasn't called me back and i called him twice already. where is he? :( call me, if you get online today, okay?  just waiting for jules... oh, wait. she's here. woohoo! party time :D  later.

      yesterday, i was standing in the parking lot waiting for steve to come pick me up after work ... and this guy in a black car (maybe it was an acura? i don't know. i don't care.) starts backing up  wait. this just in... steve sold crystal chronicles :( i was going to play it! i'm never going to complain about another game again :( damn. oh well. i sucked at it, anyway.  back to my story...  this guy's about to leave, backs up, drives up and asks if i need help. DID I LOOK DESPERATE? even if i did need help, what did he think he was going to do? damn. i should've told him i needed to pick my mom up in chino hills and could he please pick her up for me. that miserable little fuck. i hate old guys. anyway, i told him, "no. i'm waiting for my ride. thanks." (damn, i even said THANKS! that's big for me.) anyway, the asshole actually looked disappointed. what a jerk. he waited around for what felt like 5 minutes. it was prolly only 10 seconds, but when someone is just sitting in their car staring at you, it feels like forever... and then he drove away finally....  now, in all fairness, i'm sure he was just trying to be nice... and he doesn't know what a bitch i am... so he probably thought he was doing the right thing... but, i was certain i wasn't giving off that whole damsel in distress vibe... and i don't need his fucking charity. i don't know why it bugged me so damned much. it just did. i hate people.

      i had this dream last night that steve and i were in australia talking about going nude-sunbathing. well, not just talking about it. i mean, we were going.  it must've been a dream :P  or maybe it'll happen. anyway, none of y'all are gettin' pics. well, maybe a topless one... of steve.  i woke up all early this morning and couldn't go back to sleep. damn. and i have to drive up to napa, today, too.  this lady at work just walked by and i'll be damned, she reminds me of amber frey. tall, blonde, skinny, fairly attractive, but longish face...  now i will read the transcripts from the scott/amber cell phone calls and laugh and laugh.

      i just remembered my dream last night. it was all because of that damned failan movie.  steve was a gangster! hehe... but he was threatening me because i was making him lose face or something... or money. okay, whatever. i'm not remembering that much of the dream. i just remember that he was a mafia boss and we weren't together...  it must've had to do with a scene in the movie. and i was the skank that he was going to off for some reason or other. i swear the nights i have nightmares i wake up soooo tired. i'm confused now. anyway, damn, that movie gave me a nightmare.

      so, i got these soup at hand things by campbell's. they're convenient. i don't need a spoon, just a microwave.  i heated one up... everything's going good... tasted decent for canned soup... chicken and pasta.... it didn't completely suck.  until i got down to the last 1/4 of the little soup thing.  all the stupid "pasta o's"are on the bottom. i was afraid of this, so had been swirling the soup around, but apparently, that doesn't help much.  and since this is my lunch, i really, really wanted to eat the stupid "pasta o's" because i was friggin' starving.  so, get this visual: i'm sitting in my chair with my head tilted back making sucking noises like a damned hoover.  and i almost had it all... and i fucking choked. one stupid "pasta o" lodges itself right there... in the wrong tube.  i just threw the rest of it out, after i turned back to a normal color from blue. remind me to use a spoon next time.

       why do people have to set their cell phones to the most obnoxious ringtone they can find? is it to be "original?" or maybe so they can recognize it from all the rest of the phone calls we're not supposed to be getting at work?      i just listened to about a minute of that horse charging song. of course i can't think of the name of it. anyway, yeah... and it was set on the loudest setting (well, it seemed like the loudest setting).      but what REALLY pisses me off is when the people around me all start laughing... like it's the funniest fucking thing they've ever heard in their lives. and they keep on talking about it. SHUT THE FUCK UP, PEOPLE... IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY.      damn. they're still fucking laughing. and it was... 3 minutes ago.       if it's the funniest damn thing you've ever heard, stop, go home, rent yourself some richard pryor. or if you're easily offended, try robin williams or wayne brady. they're not as funny, but they're sure as hell funnier than a stupid ringtone.

      is mel's china set. cute... but not $224-for-a-damn-coffee-pot-you're-never-going-to-use cute!... place settings at $129, SUGAR BOWL for $112, CREAMER for $98... was there even a coffee maker on the damned registry? i don't think stan drinks coffee because *GASP* caffeine is evil! ellen g. white said so! fuck ellen white and her stupid books.  how STUPID is she? why are you going to register for shit that you won't be able to afford? someone bought her ONE place setting.  GUESS WHO'S GONNA HAVE TO BUY THE OTHER 11, GENIUS????  hrm... $129 x 11 = TOO MUCH FUCKING MONEY! and that's without tax.  what, she thinks people are going to get her all this shit? i'm sorry, but not everyone is willing to or able to buy this stuff.  i'm proud to say, my nice plates are from target. and guess what, pretty much everything that was on our registries was bought for us... because they were affordable and practical. and people didn't feel like they were spending an arm and another important appendage on one damn plate. i don't want china that i'm never going to use cluttering up my home. wtf is the deal with china sets, anyway??? ooh, let's buy china and put them in a case and never use them! YAY!  jeezus, there has got to be about 300 items on this damn registry. before she even signed up for a registry, she was telling me how they didn't really need much, etc, etc, etc... and she was only doing it because she felt like she had to and there wasn't going to be much on it. all of a sudden there's kate spade china, vera wang glasses, and some FUGLY zebra print bedding.  i hope this helps her feel like the princess she has always wanted to be... but apparently, i wasn't letting her blossom into a princessflower. i, the voice of reason in her life, left her... so now she can be as stupid as she wants to be. congratulations, mel and stan. good luck in your new life together. you're fucking going to need it.

        this is from salon.com       During Amber Frey's second day of testimony at Scott Peterson's murder trial, the courtroom was treated to more taped messages between Frey and Peterson, who pretended that he was hopscotching through Europe when he was really in Modesto, Calif., as police and family members still searched for his missing wife, Laci.       No matter what else happens in the case, the tapes seem to give prosecutors irrefutable evidence of the one thing that observers had long suspected of both Peterson and Frey ever since their vacant expressions and slack jaws first dominated magazines and "Larry King Live" more than a year ago: They're dumb. Really, seriously, not smart. And he also is sure guilty of being creepy; in one taped conversation, Peterson waxes poetic about Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining." The exchange, according to the Post  , was:      "That's a scary movie," exclaimed Frey.        "But it's the best movie ever made," Peterson insisted.    "The whole redrum [murder spelled backwards] and the bathtub — that's scary," said Frey.    "Ooh, the two twins freak me out, baby," Peterson oozed.    He later noted that he also liked the movie "Meet Joe Black," in which Brad Pitt plays Death.    "Oh, yeah, I really like that one," Peterson said, mistakenly referring to the film as "Meet Jack Black."    Peterson also recommends the 1994 remake of "Love Affair," because it stars his "hero," Warren Beatty.       Then, he asks Frey what she thinks the best movie of all time is:    Frey: Oh, I don't know how to answer that honestly.    Peterson: OK. How about if I give you a genre?    Frey: What? What are you saying, gen. . . I still don't know what you're saying.    Peterson: Genre. G-e-n-r-e.    Frey: Gen. . .    Peterson: It's a type of movie. Genre.    Frey: OK, I never heard that before.    In at least two of the phone conversations, when Peterson claimed to be in Paris, he was annoyed by a dog's constant barking -- believed to be Laci's black Labrador, barking in the backyard of Peterson's Modesto home. (The New York Post's melodramatic take: "WIFE'S DOG HAUNTED SCOTT.")       At one point, Peterson says of the dog, "oh, I want to kill it." Later, he tells Frey that he's next traveling from Paris to Madrid ("I'll be saying 'hola' a lot more instead of 'bonjour.'") and at another point, he claims to be traveling to Brussels, which prompts Frey to ask: Is that in Europe?       Later, now nearly two weeks after Peterson's wife had disappeared, he reads Frey a Boris Pasternak poem:    "'Beneath the willow wound round with ivy we take cover from the worst of the storm, with a greatcoat round our shoulders and my hands around your waist.    "'… You intoxicate me! Let's spread the greatcoat on the ground.'"    Frey: "What are you talking about?"    Peterson: "I was thinking of you sexually."    And later:    Frey: "So you've been thinking a lot about me?"    Peterson: "Yeah, that's all I did today. And I'm sorry, I, I just, I just started rambling and there's a tear in my eye, and it's trickling."        AW, GAWD!!!! that's just SO painful!!!!

       last night we watched failan. it's a korean flick, apparently based on a japanese novel. the basic story goes like this:      1. chinese girl loses parents, seeks out remaining relatives in korea.   2. chinese relatives in korea emigrate to canada   3. boohoo, poor chinese girl has nowhere to go, looks for an unemployment office for chinese folks   4. they marry her off to a korean mafia member, pay korean mafia guy, sell chinese girl   5. they try to sell her off as a stripper, but she's sick, so she works in a laundry instead   6. she falls in love with her "husband," probably because she has no one else to think about   7. she dies   8. he has to go confirm her death, and sees the letters she wrote him and feels bad   9. he falls in love with his dead "wife"      the beginning of the movie was pretty good. this mafia guy had a boss who had some serious anger management problems. he was just kicking ass all over the place. let's just say that the movie was much better when the main guy was getting the shit kicked out of him. when it started getting to the flashbacks and the love story, it just SUCKED. she's stupid for falling in love with him and writing him letters. what, she thought he was really her husband? she knew what the deal was...      it would've been better if the girl ended up working as a hostess at a korean club.. or a stripper on a pole. but in a laundry? come on! she's all frail and shit. she's dying for chrissakes. i think being a hostess would be much more realistic for her. when i say she worked at a laundry, there weren't any machines. she was outside in the cold washing them in a basin with her FEET. no wonder the poor bitch died.      also, the main male character was one of the main characters in Old Boy. which was a good but disturbing movie... now, this guy's a pretty good actor... but he always plays the pathetic guy. i'm sick of seeing him as a wimp! i think he'd be a kickass bad guy, too... damn. why does he always end up playing the loser???      i think the real problem was that a korean wrote the screenplay. koreans just fucking LOOOOVE the melodrama. if i had written the script, she would've been a stripper, paid off her debt, bought herself a ticket back to china. and he wouldn't be a pansy anymore. he'd grow a pair and then get rid of his boss and be the mafia leader. and then he could have the anger management problem and ram people's heads against the concrete many, many times.       also, koreans have no F. why would they name a movie with her name that supposedly starts with an F. and they weren't even saying it like that. they were saying it baeklan. i don't see no K in failan.       whatever. this movie gets a 2 out of 5. 1 star for being korean (hehe), 1/2 star for the asskicking in the beginning, and another 1/2 star for having the Old Boy guy in it.

       why can't i just walk through the fucking halls between cubes without having to say hello to people. is there some sort of unwritten corporate code that states we have to be all fake and smiley and friendly with the people who we just happen to share breathing air? i have nothing in common with these people. why do i have to be nice, anyway? i don't want to spend time with these people going to happy hours and seeing them on weekends. if i run into someone at target or something after work, i very quickly turn and walk the other way. they should extend that same courtesy to me.       i walked past a couple of guys and they were all fucking chipper: "hi, grace!" i really didn't feel like saying hi, so i didn't. i looked in their general direction and gave the quick dude nod... i don't normally do this because i think it's stupid, but i did because i didn't feel like smiling at these fuckups. "someone's unfriendly today... give us a pretty smile, grace!" i just kept on walking... and then i heard them whisper something about pmsing.       why can't i just be a fucking bitch without having it covered up by some excuse like pms? i can be moody  whenever  the fuck i wanna be. that's my god-given right as a woman. if i don't feel like saying hi to you,  i don't have to . and if i do, then it's your fucking lucky day, isn't it? maybe they should take a hint and just NOT say hi to me. there's NO reason to talk to me about what i did this past weekend or if steve and i are planning on having kids... it's   NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS  . could i make it any more clear?      i hate people so much i took the extra chair out of my cube so they couldn't sit and chat. as soon as i'm done ranting, i'm taking down all pics in my cubes so they can stop using them as conversation pieces. it's not that i have a lot of friends or anything, we could all use friends. i just don't want  them  as my friends. i'd rather have no friends than have these stupid work people as my friends.

       i was talking to jonny last night and we were complaining about presentations (him giving them, me making them). he's works for a company that makes rocket parts or something like that... anyway, he works with rocket scientists... i'm not sure if he's a rocket scientist. maybe he's a rocket engineer. is that the same thing?        g  : i used to make my presentations all flashy and pretty and exciting... now it's just text on a page... i don't even animate the slides anymore...     j  : hmmm... i wonder why we don't put hyperlinks and flashy stuff in presentations... oh yeah! i remember now... it's because we make a powerpoint presentation, print it out, copy it onto transparency paper, and then show the presentation on an overhead.     g  : wtf? you still use overhead projectors????      apparently, these rocket scientists don't use projectors. they have an overhead projector. i thought microsoft banned those in the late 90s!!! i can't wrap my head around the overhead projector. i can't believe anyone actually still has them. he says that they have normal projectors, too, but that only comes out for the bigwigs and special occasions... damn, we have a projector in our home. they can't cough up $899 for a damned projector?      they may be smart, but damn, they don't have any common sense. maybe it's because all of their brain power was allocated to math reasoning or something... or maybe it's because they're all male and we all know men don't have any common sense... hehehe.

       on the way to work this morning, we're listening to kroq. a song by green day was playing. i recognize green day because every single one of their songs sounds the same. i couldn't tell you the name of the song or what album it's off of or when it came out. i just know it's green day. i can't tell the difference between any of their songs. if you put together a medley of their songs, it would mesh together seamlessly.       i'm not saying that every song by an artist should sound completely different. there should be some cohesion. the reason i didn't like alicia keys' first album was because it was just all over the place. the girl had talent, but each song was kind of random. (her second album was really, really good - she has replaced beyonce as my favorite chanteuse of the moment) i'm just saying that the songs should have something different about them. something. anything. a different beat or a different melody would be nice...      "artists" with songs that sound the same:   5. britney spears   4. phil collins   3. green day   2. 311   1. R.E.M.

        we just got this email today. first of all, we all know that this damned alert is bogus. second.... today is the 10th. the alert was on the 2nd. WTF takes our travel department so fucking long to get this to us... do they have ANY idea how many people travel every day at our company??? they SHOULD because they're supposed to be making all of the travel itineraries for the salespeople....    it's not like they actually work. i mean, please. it's not that difficult to make travel plans. they don't even find us good deals. it's easier and cheaper to just do it ourselves... i think they should all be fired. bastard fucks.    Distribution: All TAIS employees As of August 2nd, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge ordered the terror alert raised from YELLOW to ORANGE in areas around these five buildings: · The headquarters of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. · The offices of Citigroup and the New York Stock Exchange in New York. · The Prudential Plaza building in Newark, N.J.  FYI, the Republican National Convention will be held at Madison Square Garden in NYC August 30 through September 2, which also houses Penn Station, a major commuter hub. If you have a business trip to any of these areas, you can enhance our personal safety by: 1. Checking news sources regularly. 2. Avoiding any potential terrorist targets such as airport or hotel lobbies, monumental buildings, tourist attractions, stadiums and arenas, and public transportation systems. 3. Avoiding any area where there are large crowds of people. 4. If you are involved in or nearby an incident, please let your Manager know your situation as soon as possible. Please be safe in your travels!

       i could listen to morrissey over and over again and not get sick of him or his songs.       driving to work was brutal this morning. there was nothing good on the radio. there never is anymore. i'm prolly just an old fart, but still... i just can't stand most of the shit they play these days. it's really pretty depressing. so i switched over to my cd player and morrissey was in and he's singing the line that's the title of my post... and i felt instantly better.      if you've never watched pensacola: wings of gold... or wings of fire... or... fuck. i dunno. anyway, if you've never seen it, thank your tv gods... i was at the gym this morning and this show was on tnt... it was the absolute worst show i've ever seen. the dialogue was terrible, the acting was terrible... it was SO bad it was almost good. almost. i really don't think they could've increased the cheese factor. i'm sure these terrible actors are making way more money than i do, but i'd be so embarrassed if i were an actor on the show and someone asked me what i did... and i told them i was an actor on THIS show... omg. it was a travesty. and i hope to god i never have to watch it again...       it was way better than the faith healing show that was on the other channel... this guy's totally jerking this lady around... i mean, physically... if she wasn't hurt before, she certainly is now.      and they didn't have the closed captioning on cnn... so, all i could do was read the ticker at the bottom... that gets old pretty quick. i'm going to need to subscribe to more magazines or something. and start bringing my music to the gym again. we get a total of 4 songs that rotate through their speakers: pieces of me (don't even know who sings it...), some avril lavigne song (i saw her perform it on SNL... dude, she sucks), either baby boy or naughty girl, and some guy band with some crap song. it's painful. it really is. but, my cd player is such a pain to carry around. pretty unwieldy. gonna have to invest in an ipod... the pink one :D or the green one :D or the blue one :D or the big white one and put all my music on it.. hrmm...

       i thought i published my last post, but i clicked on save as draft. oops.      anyway, we watched the big bounce last night. not a great movie. but owen wilson (once again) just made that movie. he is the saviour of B flicks. there are a couple of movies that even he couldn't save, but it's not like he's god or anything. :P      the movie was entertaining enough, though... elmore leonard books make for entertaining movies, usually... steve and i brought a bunch of elmore leonard books with us when we went to europe... for train and plane rides and such. they were quick and easy reads. and we could just leave them there for the next bored traveller when we were done, thus making our backpacks a LOT lighter by the end of the trip.       man, that was a fun trip... even if i did get deathly ill and couldn't really enjoy barcelona :( i wouldn't trade that trip for anything, though. i would love to go back sometime... maybe when we're all old and retired. hehe... that would be great. except we wouldn't be able to walk around too much. but it'd still be fun. i know it's silly and sentimental, but i think i would like to travel with steve when we're old... and we can hold hands and walk around and go to bed early hehe... but most likely, it'd not be that great. i'd probably still have a bad temper and get mad at steve for no reason and i'd be drooling all over myself, spilling food and getting into car accidents and shit like that...       what the hell was i writing about? i'm losing my mind. i think it's brain failure due to being overpowerpointed. at least the presentation's still under 200 pages including the appendix. woohoo! sometimes, it can get to be over 400 pages and that's when you really go insane.      i need a new job. one that doesn't require me to ever use powerpoint again. EVER. i think my dream job would be not to have to work at all. my dream job is to be a lady of leisure. hehehe. when i first got out of college and first started working, i thought that it would be SO weird if i didn't work and i thought that even if i didn't need the money, i would continue to work. i know i've only been working full-time for about 5 years now, but it feels like 10. i swear i age twice as fast now than i did when i was in school.... ahhh, so why don't you go back to school, you ask? i couldn't handle anymore homework or tests. hehe... basically, i'm lazy.       well, i think i would feel bad if i didn't work at all ever again cuz i wouldn't want steve to have the full burden of supporting me... and i'd feel guilty... maybe i could work part-time. hehe... i don't think i'd hate my job so much if i could just work part-time. like, show up for the first and last weeks of every month. or even if i just got every wednesday off or something. i'd even settle for that. i wish they'd give us an option to work 10 hour days, 4 days a week. that would be nice. and it's not my boss. i mean, he makes my job tolerable. i think it's just the thought of working for The Man.       i really should do something about that... but, what????

       i started playing ff:cc on saturday night, briefly... it was kinda fun... the characters are oh, so kawaii!!!! gameplay's a little hard to get the hang of. and it's not turn-based which i like better for the ff games... but, it's okay... EXCEPT... the saving. you have to leave the town you're in to save. which would be fine, if they plopped you back where you saved. but, no. they put you back at the beginning of the town and you have to fight all the same monsters again. which is a serious pain.      so, on saturday night, i played for maybe an hour or so... and went to sleep... now, throughout the level, it will stop the gameplay after something happens and it'll say: New Diary Entry... and there were no save points... so, this whole time i'm assuming that the new diary entries are saves. i'm just glad i was too tired to play anymore. i would've been PISSED OFF if i played any more than that...      yeah, so i had to redo it yesterday... when i found out, i was all mumbling: goddamn mother fucking whores... good thing steve already knows i'm crazy. otherwise, he would've been scared. heh.      things they could do to make ff:cc better:   1. make the characters more responsive to the attack button. every time i push the "A" button, it takes forever for the stupid character to attack. it's almost impossible to make the character do a combo move.   2. make the character MOVE when you push the thumbstick. i kept on getting hit even when i was trying to move it. you can't hit and run as fast as you'd like to. it sucked ass.   3. put some effin' save points in the damned game. and start you off where you saved last.      i only played that one level, so i'm sure i'll have more complaints... hehe... i was so pissed yesterday, i was gonna get rid of the game... i'll give it another try, though. maybe tonight.

       so, i get onto my dashboard and i have 69 posts... damn. i ramble a LOT. scary.      last night we went to a friend's housewarming party (jules, you get that pic? hehe. send it over to me... i wanna see what i texted you. i can't remember....hehe)... it was all right.... i never hang out with that many korean people at a time... it was like culture shock for me. hehe... i'm ji's whitest friend. hehe... everyone was nice enough, i guess... i didn't really know anyone... so it was kinda weird. drank too much. and then i passed out in the car on the way home. heh...      i had like 3 cigarettes though. i felt sick afterwards. and the night before i had 2 or 3 drags off of ben's cigarette... i think steve's okay with it as long as i don't start up again. i think i'll be okay, as long as i don't buy my own pack. heh. as long as i have to mooch, i won't get hooked again. yeah. yeah. yeah. actually, i'm not craving any today. so i think i'm good. ... do i sound like i'm trying to convince myself? heh. i'm serious, though!      but, this is my year to have fun... you know, go nuts and get all my vices out of the way... heh. although, after taking that hell test, i think i may not need to have any more fun. hehe... i'm still baffled that jules got a lower score than i did. sheesh. what is this world coming to.      mmm. steve just made us blueberry milkshakes. i told him i like his milkshakes... he told me he likes mine :P he's silly.      the japanese executives are back next week... that's the only reason why i'm on a computer today. i'm working ... only on draft 2 of the final presentation i need to do. hopefully this week will go by fast... i'm looking forward to seeing jules and jeaneil up in napa.      which reminds me... the massage people never sent me any sort of confirmation that they were gonna go to jeaneil's on saturday afternoon... i'd better email them again.       Okay. Bastards. They'd better email me back this time.      Yesterday, Ji was trying to tell me that I needed to be friends with Mel because we've been friends for over a decade. Whatever. I told her, "Uhm, no. I don't."       Ji: But, Grace...   Me: Yeah?   Ji: You should call her.   Me: No. I really don't want to. She's so different now, we have nothing in common, she's condescending and judgemental, so no.   Ji: Okay...      hehe. since when did ji turn into the nice girl? sheesh. hehehe. ooh,   i hope our 10 year reunion isn't uncomfortable, though. i keep having friggin' dreams about her stupid wedding. i can't wait until this whole clusterfuck of an event is over!      it's 11:15 sunday... hehe... waiting for julia to call me.... can't wait to hear the scoop on his stupid family. heh.      powerpoint calls. kill me now.

       so, i watched 13 going on 30 last night. for the record, i didn't pick the movie... but in his defense, i think he just wanted to see jennifer garner in a pink nightie. anyway, yeah. despite the fact that i seriously thought i would never see that movie, i did... and surprisingly enough, i enjoyed it.    the two kids that play jenna and matt as kids were terrific together. you could really believe that they were best friends... and in the beginning when she hurts him, you could seriously feel that pain. i almost cried. i swear! hehe. i was all tearing up. hehe.      jennifer garner does a kickass job of portraying a confused, awkward 13 year old in the body of a successful, beautiful 30 year old... there were quite a few cringe moments... heh. like when her boyfriend starts stripping for her... to ice, ice baby... and a medley of other songs... of course he's a hockey player which makes it even funnier because of the song and the ice... and well, never mind. you get it, right? heh.      ooh, ooh. one of my favorite lines was when jennifer garner is in the elevator with a 13 year old girl and the girl says to her: i like your dress. and she replies back (a little too enthusiastically): thanks! that's cuz i've got these incredible boobs to fill it out!       when her 30 year old body is walking around on those heels in the beginning, she has the awkward coltish gait of a 13 year old trying on her mom's heels... it's really quite endearing...      andy serkis is devilishly wonderful as jenna's boss. every line he delivers is crisp... it took me a while to realize that he was andy serkis... all i could think about was gollum ... "we wants it! and the nasty little hobbitses took the precious!"      but, i have some beef with the movie... i know it's just a movie and all but...    1. if her family and matt's family live next door to each other in new jersey all their lives... WHERE'S the NJ accent???    2. (this is actually a funny comment from steve) what white taxi driver is not gonna know rick springfield from springsteen?   3. and my comment was: what guy from    NJ    is going to confuse rick springfield with THE BOSS? good god! jersey LOVES springsteen! hehe...   4. so, in order for a woman to be completely happy, she shouldn't be a successful mag editor.. instead, she should get married to her childhood sweetheart and move into a friggin' pink barbie dreamhouse? what, she couldn't have it both ways? sheesh... in order to be nice, you have to be conventional? in order to be happy you can't be a high-powered executive? (although, in my company, you can't be woman and nice and powerful... but that's a whole other rant... i don't know how it is in other corps...)   5. if matt's an artsy photographer living in the village, he is NOT moving into the damn 'burbs into a friggin' pink barbie dreamhouse... if he marries her and they're all nice and happy together, he wouldn't turn into the quirky artist type he became... he's going to wake up and ask, is this my beautiful house? is this my beautiful wife? and he'll realized that he missed out on life.    6. and finally, you know part of the reason why she decided on getting together with matt in the end was cuz he ended up being a sensitive hottie, as opposed to the blond idiotboy she WAS seeing.      who knew i would get so heated about a movie geared to 13 year olds????    okay, but despite my cynicysm, it really was pretty enjoyable. a lot better than i thought it would be. also, when i first saw mark ruffalo, i didn't think he was that cute, but he sure got a lot better looking as the movie went on...

      yes, he was a little crazy, but still... damn, nobody could make me shake my money maker the way he did...  Funk Singer Rick James Dies in Los Angeles  LOS ANGELES - Funk legend Rick James, best known for the 1981 hit "Super Freak," died Friday, apparently of natural causes, police said.  James died at 9:45 a.m. at a residence near Universal City, said Police Department spokeswoman Esther Reyes.  "We learned of his death after responding to a radio call," Reyes said.  After his big hit, James' fame began to fade as he became embroiled in drugs, legal problems and health issues.  James was convicted in 1993 of assaulting two women. The first attack occurred in 1991 when he restrained and burned a young woman with a hot pipe during a cocaine binge at his house in West Hollywood. He was free on bail when the second assault occurred in 1992 in James' hotel room.  James was sentenced to more than two years in state prison.  In 1997, he released a new album, but a year later he suffered a stroke while performing at Denver's Mammoth Events Center, derailing a comeback tour.  In 1998 he also underwent hip replacement surgery.  With his trademark Jheri curl, James was one of the biggest R&amp;B stars of the 1980s, using danceable rhythms and passionate ballads to gain a wide following. Aside from "Super Freak" — which MC Hammer used a decade later as the backing track for his monster hit "U Can't Touch This" — James' hits included "Mary Jane," "Ebony Eyes" and "Fire and Desire," a stirring duet with Teena Marie.

        i'm guessing they can't figure out if i'm rational or emotional since all the other letters came out the same. although, this description may fit me better, i think i'm more emotional than rational. well, i dunno. i'm emotional about certain things... but other things... well, hrm. i have no idea. now i'm just confused.     also, i'm very, very funny. no ifs about it :P     You are an SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a font of knowledge. You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.    You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.    You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.     You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.      Addendum, 2004/07/19: this fits me 99%, there is a slight inaccuracy however. We are not necessarily completely unfunny. If we have a sense of humor (I do) it surfaces on the occasion with well-timed, completely dry, very sarcastic, wit. - Chase

       i just took a personality test that labeled me:       You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.You are not to be messed with. You may explode.      check out the test:   urlLink http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personality&amp;page=1    i'm not sure if this is right or not... i don't think it is... i'm totally easily distracted from the task at hand. for example, i haven't done shit at work all day. now i'm going to have to take it all home. heh. i don't think my friends find me remote and a hard nut to crack... or maybe they don't tell me that cuz i'm inaccessible :P i may need to take the test again. heh...

       i know my blog has gracie in it, but it doesn't mean that just anyone can call me gracie... i don't mind when my friends call me gracie... and it's basically just my friends who read my blog... so that's okay... and if strangers read my blog, i don't really care if they think my name is gracie...      what bugs me is when people at work think it's okay to call me gracie. it is not okay to call me gracie. only people who i am fond of can call me gracie. there is one lady at work who calls me gracie that i'm cool with. unfortunately, she's friends with other people who think that because SHE calls me gracie, THEY can call me gracie. i'm not sure if this is even making sense...       anyway, it fucking bugs.  i don't know why. it just does.

       so, i just looked at mel and stan's wedding registry again. now she's got the vera wang and kate spade stuff...      the funniest part about that, though is that she did that after jules told her about abigail's registry. now, we all know abigail's gonna have a princess wedding...   but, we never expected mel to, really... now she's wanting it to be like a real princess wedding because she's gotta have something... since she doesn't have a real groom.       this whole wedding is such a farce. to be honest, i feel like she just REALLY, REALLY wanted to get hitched after i got married. she's always been a little competitive with me in weird ways.      it's too bad she slept with him. some people can sleep around, others just can't. i knew she'd get all attached to him if she slept with him. i warned her.       EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO ME! I KNOW EVERYTHING!!!! buuuwahahahahhahaha!

      my husband got this from a customer today...   "Also, this week, we are having problems with different fax machines. We have had this problem before and it was because our lines and Qwest we not "in sink" with each other. I don't know the terminology. It is spermatic, but most of the faxes can sometimes send and sometimes not."   and you gotta LURVE the "in sink"... it almost would've been better if she typed "n'sync."  okay... what the fuck????  hehehe one of his friends wrote back with:   sperm.at.ic -- Pronunciation Key (sperm-AT-ick) also sperm.at.i.cal adj. 1. Occurring at irregular intervals, in spurts or gobs; sometimes prematurely or not at all. See Synonyms: gismodic. 2. Appearing in large, swimming schools, as a fish or tadpole. 3. An Ecstatic display of appreciation; "He was spermatic at the sight of her"    *i heart his geek friends* hehehe

       so, we took the bunny in to get spayed today. apparently, if you don't spay them, female bunnies have a very high chance of getting uterine cancer. *sigh* so i'm in a bad mood today. i feel all worried.      we were in the waiting area and someone brought their cats in (they were in carriers, the bunny was not). so, one of the cats starts meowing and you should've seen the bunny. her eyes grew all wide and her pupils dilated and her ears went flat down against her back. she was so scared. it was funny... in a sad sort of way.       i hope they get done fast. i wanna take her home and baby her.      *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~      we watched starsky and hutch last night. it was pretty darned funny. maybe more so because i had read so many bad reviews on it, i was just expecting the worst? i dunno. i absolutely adore owen wilson, though. he is so goddamned funny. he just has that comic timing and he can pull off lines like nobody's business. i like ben stiller, too... though i think he's a tad bit overrated. i did like him in zoolander, though. heh. anyway, the extra content on the S&amp;H dvd is enough to rent it. there's a snoop 'fashion show' and some interviews that just cracked me up.     *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   i got this great brown rice and green tea stuff at the korean store the other week. it's WAY better than the other brands i've been drinking. this is much smoother and there's no sediment at the bottom of the cup. mmm. tasty.     *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~     i got an email from this guy who apparently has his stupid short film showing at some festival. normally i would be excited for people who could do such things, but he's such a wanker. when i was at my cousin's funeral (miss you, joe) and we were all hanging out at someone's house, he like, forced people to watch his stupid flicks. i had to leave. i was so annoyed so i never saw either one of them. i did hear that his movies absolutely bite, though. farkin' wanker.      it's so annoying. all of a sudden, he's best friends with joe. what-the-fuck-ever. he was already getting on my nerves, but then he starts talking condescendingly to my brother and sister like they're stupid or something. ("you remember your cousin, joe, don't you? joe? your cousin? i was his best friend.") and then somehow the fact i got a 99 percentile on the psat came up and he was just FLOORED. ("oh! i didn't know you were smart. wow! i can't believe YOU got a higher score than ME. etc, etc, etc.) he just thinks so highly of himself, it's unfuckingbelievable. i hate people with his characteristics. normally, i respect artists. it's definitely not easy making a short film or making music or writing... lord knows i can't do it... but i can't respect him. he reminds me of someone else i hate... stan. fuck stan, too. mel's making the biggest mistake of her fucking life. it's too bad she's too stupid to see it.      i'm so sick of dealing with the majority of people. i wish i could live out in bumblefuck somewhere. it's too bad i would miss korean food... and just the option of going out, even if i don't feel like it. heh...       anyway, thank god it's hump day. wish it was friday, though....

       i can't believe that it's already august. where does the time go? before ya know it it'll be winter again. i feel like every time i blink another day goes by.       and i'm in a bad mood today. we have to take our bunny to get spayed tomorrow and i really, really, really don't wanna do it :( :( :( *sigh* i have to quit taking out my bad mood out on steve :( i did it again this morning :(      and i'm annoyed with this new terror alert. the repubs are gonna play it up as much as possible and then say it was due to w's hard work and dedication that we thwarted another enemy attack. greeeat. that's another 4 years for him. *sigh* i mean, i'm not saying that the information they got was fake or that they were holding onto it until it was most advantageous... well, maybe they were. hehe... but, i know what's going to happen in november. and it makes me really sad. also, teresa would've been a kickass first lady to have. even better than hillary. oh well. i'll still keep my fingers crossed, though.

       i just remembered... on the hellboy dvd extras, there were these cartoons about a boy named gerald mcboingboing... it was kinda trippy. instead of using words, he'd make noises like boing boing and other things like trains, etc. anyway, the first one was written by dr. seuss. it was entertaining... the other 2 weren't written by dr. seuss. the 2nd one was all prose and the third was written to emulate dr. seuss... and the writers tried, but it just didn't flow like the dr. seuss one. anyway, yeah... i've never heard of such a cartoon! crazy.

       i didn't know this, but 311 did a cover of the cure's lovesong. now, i love that song. sure, it's cheesy and stuff, but i still love it. so, how did 311 manage to fuck it up? i dunno. it's got this slight reggae beat in it... and the guy isn't doing his normal stupid voice... so, that's good... but, it sounds dead. i dunno. robert smith gives it a desperate edge, i guess... 311 managed to completely kill it.       i could dig the songs... if they didn't ruin it...  like the remake of mad world. i dunno who did it, but it's awful. and i hate those flashdance outfits. well, maybe i hate them cuz i wouldn't be able to pull it off. hehe... the only song that's decent is no doubt's remake of it's my life...      i noticed that there seems to be a resurgence of 80s songs and fashions..... scary. heh. i'm going to cut bangs and make them skyhigh again. oh, yes and purchase aqua net and wear leg warmers... yeah, baby :D

       well, i've always been disturbed, but right now i'm more disturbed than usual. a friend sent me this porn pic of this woman and she's on the ground and her legs are in the air and we have a very clear view of her butthole... which would've almost been normal... except... the hole is HUGE i mean.... you could put softballs... or whiffle balls in there... i dunno... i'm just going to say it was photoshopped... it had to have been. i mean... is that possible? i should've paid more attention in anatomy class. heh.      i'm feeling ill.      i had to share with someone so i sent it to steve... heh. he's gonna be like, "wtf???? my wife is crazy."       poor guy. heh.

       why is it that i can wake up on the weekend at 6am and be fine, but come monday, i can barely roll my lazy ass out of bed at 7:30? and then i'm groggy all day... sheesh...      weekend was good. went to my cousin's to celebrate their 10 year anniversary (i was wrong about the 11th or 12th anniversary... ). i really didn't do much of anything all weekend. it was kinda nice, especially after last weekend. too much to do.      we watched hellboy, finally. i liked it. if i tried to explain the plot here, it would sound all convulted. but, when you're watching it, it all makes sense... and despite the moral underpinings of good versus evil (and how everyone has both seeds in them, it's up to the person to decide which seeds to cultivate) it was a really fun movie. even with the lesson in morality, it never gets bogged down. it manages to stay light and fun. del toro does a good job of keeping the movie going. and the look of the movie is really nice... i really liked the movie sets. just creepy enough, but not overdone. anyway, i may have to start reading the comics now...      but, when we're about halfway through the movie, my mom calls. i ignore it, as i usually ignore the first call she makes. i figure if it's important, she'll leave a message or she'll call again. 15 or 30 minutes later, she calls again. so, i'm thinking it's important. but it's not. she just keeps talking and talking... and i'm telling her i'm busy watching a movie. but her reasoning is: you're watching it at home, so you can talk and watch at the same time! i kind of just said, no, i can't and said i had to go and hung up on her. i called her later to apologize, but jeez. that's just annoying. she does that all the time. i went to breakfast with a friend and his brother and my mom's all trying to have a conversation with me... this is a woman who won't talk to me on her way out the door. she's on a cell phone. it's mobile. she's gonna get into a car and drive somewhere and she can't talk to me? whatever.       i do need to work on my temper, though. i tend to lose my temper at my mom. and people at work. and pretty much everyone. this morning was bad. i wanted to get to work on time today, but i couldn't find my keys... and i was already 10 minutes late... so i'm cursing and slamming doors and yelling... it was quite unnecessary... and i felt better... but that was after i subjected steve to about 5-10 minutes of screaming and yelling and cursing... *sigh* i really have to learn to control that. i don't know how steve can be so calm all the time. never loses his cool... well, almost never. heh... there are those videogame moments... :P      speaking of videogames, my thumb is sore. damn those ham-ham games. kawaii! i can't get enough of them! i'm playing at lunch today :D i played a demo of sudeki yesterday. i thought i was going to like it more. the movements are kind of awkward and the gameplay isn't exactly intuitive. but, at least now i know i don't need to buy that game... maybe tonight i'll try to play final fantasy crystal chronicles. i know i really should play more of FFX-2... but jules ruined it for me. hehe. she played it and in one night passed my level... by a lot... and i'd been playing it for a while. so yeah. i suck. heh.      yeah, this weekend was good.... all i did was play video games and read and eat. :D it was nice. i'm already thinking about next weekend... heh
