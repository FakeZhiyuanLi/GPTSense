      Ok, so, I went shopping today.&nbsp; I bought a pair of jeans at The Buckle.&nbsp; I also went to American Eagle.&nbsp; I got a belt, and when looking at the racks I saw something that amazed me:&nbsp; a pair of 26/28 jeans.&nbsp; I did not know such creatures existed.&nbsp; I immediately felt the need to try them on.&nbsp; They fit.&nbsp; I bought them.&nbsp; I think I shall lose weight to celebrate.

      I am trying desperately to get the forum working.&nbsp; I have discovered that while I could never design an entire site in php myself, I can most certainly handle adjusting code written by others so that it will work on free hosting sites that have weird server settings.

      I have a little story to tell.  To understand this story you must know two things:  there is this random storage building thing shaped like a barn in my yard and our lawnmower has headlights.  Because our lawnmower has headlights, I felt the need to mow the yard in the dark.  A short while ago my mother came outside and started yelling something to me.   What she was really saying:  "Put the lawnmower in the barn." What it sounded like she was saying:  "Add water to the porn." Yep, that's my story.

      I hate listening to my parents argue.  I slipped and mentioned that my dad had yelled at me to my mother.  It doesn't bother me for any of the normal reasons that it would bother a sane person, but it still bothers me.

      My father took auto classes in high school.  This fully qualified him to buy an old jeep and re-build it.  It is bright green and red and a piece of crap.  He forced me to drive him in it today.  He brought the dog.  The dog is evil and weighs at least as much as I do.  I would give more specific details, but I am afraid that I would combust.  It was not fun.  It will never happen again.

      It was on Friday.  This is the post in which I re-hash the happenings.  We met at Denielle's house.  I saw her new room multiple times.  I am very fond of the random chair.  We rode horses.  I named mine Horse.  I will always remember him fondly.  Then we returned to Denielle's house. Other people ate cake and ice cream, and I had a nice bottle of water.  Many things were discussed, including the fact that someone I know has three testicles.  I want to know who peed in his gene pool.  Later, while not even pretending to watch Dirty Dancing, we played with an exercise machine and started trying to play Girl Talk before I had to leave.

      I have a split personality.  Do not be confused:  I do not have multiple personalities.  I have one personality which is divided into two distinct parts.  Upon learning that one of my father's friends shot himself in the leg while hunting, the first part of my personality said, "Oh, that's horrible."  It also warned its counterpart not to say what it was thinking lest it prove itself to be an asshole.  Ignoring the order, it said, "Haha, karma rocks!"

      Since my father's heart surgery, I have become his official driver.  It's a crappy job, but it gets me drive-time and, occaisionally, money.  Thanks to the money, I have been listening to my new Melissa Etheridge cd and feeling very secure in my masculinity.  (I also bought Maria Mena's single, since her cd doesn't come out until the 20th.)
