						   Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!

						   "Marriage, Marriage is what brings us together, today." -- The Princess Bride  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure, so I should just be content with that.
