      The earliest memories I have are foggy.  It is difficult for me to tell the difference between a memory and something I've been told so many times I assume it is true.  I apparently didn't speak until "I wanted to."  Four or five years of age, right before Kindergarten.  As near as I can tell I had some hearing issues and required tutelage in order to speak.  The tutor cost my parents plenty, I'm sure.  I think we lived in Wichita, OK then.  Near Lawton, OK.  I can vaguely remember the house:  a small one story wooden structure in a decent neighborhood.  I distinctly remember the "Witch's Castle."  The Castle was a huge smoke spitting plant that we drove by every time we went to town... huge then.  Probably not there at all now.  Wichita, OK is where my Aunt Vicki woke with a scorpion on her chest.  She was staying over and had to sleep on the floor.  Our family of six didn't leave much room for guests to sleep anywhere else.  It was also where I dressed up as a 1960s punk:  blue jeans, white t-shirt, and a box of candy cigarettes rolled up in my t-shirt sleeve.  (Imagine doing that now?  The kid would be expelled from school.)  I played a reindeer in a school play... or was that my sister?  Wichita is where I supposedly received an F and promptly beaten for it.  The next day we discovered that it was a horrible mistake and I had straight As.  I suppose some child went home and received thirty dollars for his excellent grades.  Karma is a bitch, after all.  My brother was beaten up by two bullies only to be chased by him wielding a knife.  My Grandma Dorene told all of us grandkids that we weren't hers, and to get "the fuck away from her car!"  This same Grandma would make us watch television.  You heard me right.  Make us watch it.  Of course she wouldn't turn it on.  She was screwed up more than any of us could ever be.  I don't know how many husbands she had but every one of my aunts and uncles are from a different father, and my Dad always told me she married many, many times.  Wichita, OK is where my Dad played Santa, God rest his soul.  We never had much money then... it wasn't hard to pretend that Santa brought our gifts because if Dad didn't get a Christmas bonus, we often didn't get a Christmas.  You know I count that as a blessing now.  As a child I'm sure I cried and cried, I didn't understand, but now to look back on what my Mother and Father achieved with what little they had... I'm very proud of both of them.  My Dad made the most in life that he ever did when he died, working for the Federal Reserve Bank.  $24,000.00 a year.  My Mom would never have made much more.  Even with inflation I can understand now.  I sit here with my job and look at the numbers and want to break down crying.  Hell, I did break down crying at work today.  I make good money, I want to give my kids a good life, and somehow I screw it up.  I always screw it up.  There was the time I fell off the large slide while playing tag.  The slide was apparently eight foot high and the fall broke my left arm clean.  I was in shock, I know this now, but for years my family pelted me with tales of my courage and strength that I didn't start to cry until Mom told me that we had to go to the hospital.  I've never had courage, and only rarely have I wielded strength.  The large three story farm house in Illinois, where my father worked as a pressman for a major comic book publisher.  He'd bring home boxes and boxes of comics every month consisting of misprints, overruns, or just not wanted issues.  We had pigs that we had to take care of for the landlord -- which meant we fed them their slop and our scraps every night.  There was even a small pond that my father tried to teach me how to fish on... unfortunately I was much too young and didn't have the patience or insight to appreciate the event.  That was also the house that my Uncle Calvin scared the living daylights out of someone.  The memories get foggy but he wore a gorilla mask and traipsed around on the outside porch roof, clawing at the windows.  Seeing some unexpected, strange monster outside my window would certainly scare me!  The more you dig the more you find.  I want the happy thoughts though.  I want to put my thoughts down on something I can read and cherish and bring up when things are starting to bring me down.  That's my goal, for now.    To find something to cling onto while my life falls apart.

      It's too bad.  I've been hoping they'd resurrect the service soon so I could begin to use this blog without the annoying banner ad at the top.  It's not the banner ad itself that bothers me, it is the fact that I don't control it.  And I don't care that it costs money to get rid of the banner ad.  I'm okay with that; free rides don't come as cheap as others think.  Oh well, go figure.   In either case since my domain has no home at the moment this will have to become my new one.  At least it qualifies as graphically pleasing. :)
