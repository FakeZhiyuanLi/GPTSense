I saw a Dean Koontz book and i just stood there and stared at it for a while. I had a funny feeling. She loves Dean Koontz, i promised to buy her one for her Birthday. Odd thomas.

      Yesterday was a good Saturday, sort of. I went to KL, got money and treated scoot and his friend at KLCC. just three guys hanging out checking out stuff and chicks. We had some beer(god i feel awful about that) at shrooms, checked out the live music and got drunk.Thats when everything gets fuzzy.It seems i called Rini, i blew all my credit on&nbsp; her.I cant remember what i said.I called her just now and she confirmed it but she said i didnt say anything bad or embarassing.I hope she's not lying.This is gonna come back and haunt me. I know it.  I do remember us going to Uncle Dons later that night in Hartamas. There was this woman Scoot met on Frenster and she was nice and stuff. Scoot was like telling us, this girl used to be a model but the girl we saw well..lets just say she's not my cup of tea. We talked and joked and she was quite the conversationalist. Good company. But i got this vibe from her.She's like 28 and not married.complaining about the lack of good men around blah blah blah.She seemed desperate.I could almost hear her tell me her falopian tube is&nbsp;singing its farewell song before it dries up. tick tock tick tock.The guys told me later today that she really hit it off with me,and most eye contact was with me.They're gonna sell her my phonenumber...i'm apallled but somehow amused. I spent the night at Scoots place, damn his place is as clean as ever.Its so fucking homy.comfortable.With the 5ft tall Cure poster, those collectible action figures, damn i wish my place was like that.Mike the cat had grown considerably since i last saw him. He has a new fren, another stray Scoot adopted. Awww..I was lying down reading a book (High Fidelity, that made me laugh a lot) and he slept on my tummy. Went to sleep around 6 am. got up at 2pm, watched Tv and had coffee, went out to eat and Ali drove me to the lrt station. and here i am in Shah Alam again..yay..but it was a good weekend.Scoot was still the same, always reminding me my life is different from him, and not be him.He's like saying its too late for him and he's only 31.Stuck in a dead end job with no money etc. He's a happy chap but somehow i sensed regret and sadness in his tone when he says stuff about his life.But he's a good friend. Whats with weekends and clubs and bars? you see all these young middle-class professionals making so much noise. a futile gesture of defiance.Its when their lives are starting to disappoint them."look at me!" "i know how to have fun!" Tragic, good thing i learned how to stay home and sulk. I learned some lessons today, i &nbsp;was unhappy. i was in self-denial. first it was numbness, then silly optimism and then unhappiness. the phase i am in now.If not why would i need alcohol to have fun? Why did i drink? WHY. i swore i'd never drink again. I comprimised myself. I'm sorry Zul. i wont do it again. I need ballast. Too much ballast and i'll sink. no ballast and i'll float away.Amy was my ballast, now she's gone and i'm floating.I dont think its clever using relationships or women as ballast. I need things to do,details,clutter,people,to occupy me so i wont float off again. end.

Uncle was passed out, so was Bob and Zam, the other 3 strangers were still there.They had this desperate confused look on their faces. They really have bad poker faces. Hisham, now he was on a lucky streak. I could see like 600 bucks with him. I dont know what goes thru the minds of these shitheads.there doesnt seem like a limit for them.most of them have families and they are wasting money gambling.(sigh)I got 50 bucks. heh just to go to the office. its saturday(ija quit today). now what am i going to do?

      I took an online pysche. it told me this  Of the four aspects of strategic analysis and definition, it is the structural engineering role -- architechtonics -- that reaches the highest development in INTPs, and it is for this reason they are aptly called the "architects." Their major interest is in figuring out structure, build, configuration -- the spatiality of things.   As the engineering capabilities the Architects increase so does their desire to let others know about whatever has come of their engineering efforts. So they tend to take up an informative role in their social exchanges. On the other hand they have less and less desire, if they ever had any, to direct the activities of others. Only when forced to by circumstance do they allow themselves to take charge of activities, and they exit the role as soon as they can without injuring the enterprise.   The Architects' distant goal is always to rearrange the environment somehow, to shape, to construct, to devise, whether it be buildings, institutions, enterprises, or theories. They look upon the world -- natural and civil -- as little more than raw material to be reshaped according to their design, as a formless stone for their hammer and chisel. Ayn Rand, master of the Rational character, describes this characteristic in the architect Howard Roark, her protagonist in The Fountainhead:   He was looking at the granite. He did not laugh as his eyes stopped in awareness of the earth around him. His face was like a law of nature-a thing one could not question, alter or implore. It had high cheekbones over gaunt, hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and steady; a contemptuous mouth, shut tight, the mouth of an executioner or a saint. He looked at the granite. To be cut, he thought, and made into walls. He looked at a tree. To be split and made into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust on the stone and thought of iron ore under the ground. To be melted and to emerge as girders against the sky. These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the drill, the dynamite and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn, waiting for the shape my hands will give to them. [The Fountainhead, pp 15-16]  Many regard this attitude as arrogant, and Architects are likely, especially in their later years, after finding out that most others are faking an understanding of the laws of nature, to think of themselves as the prime movers who must pit themselves against nature and society in an endless struggle to define ends clearly and adopt whatever means that promise success. If this is arrogance, then at least it is not vanity, and without question it has driven the design engineers to take the lead in molding the structure of civilization....(hmmm...)  I then took an online temperament test. it told me this.   Rationals, are the problem solving temperament, particularly if the problem has to do with the many complex systems that make up the world around us. Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better. In working with problems, Rationals try to find solutions that have application in the real world, but they are even more interested in the abstract concepts involved, the fundamental principles or natural laws that underlie the particular case. And they are completely pragmatic about their ways and means of achieving their ends. Rationals don't care about being politically correct. They are interested in the most efficient solutions possible, and will listen to anyone who has something useful to teach them, while disregarding any authority or customary procedure that wastes time and resources.  Rationals have an insatiable hunger to accomplish their goals and will work tirelessly on any project they have set their mind to. They are rigorously logical and fiercely independent in their thinking--are indeed skeptical of all ideas, even their own--and they believe they can overcome any obstacle with their will power. Often they are seen as cold and distant, but this is really the absorbed concentration they give to whatever problem they're working on. Whether designing a skyscraper or an experiment, developing a theory or a prototype technology, building an aircraft, a corporation, or a strategic alliance, Rationals value intelligence, in themselves and others, and they pride themselves on the ingenuity they bring to their problem solving.  Rationals are very scarce, comprising as little as 5 to 10 percent of the population. But because of their drive to unlock the secrets of nature, and to develop new technologies, they have done much to shape our world. The Four types of Rationals are: Architects (INTP)  Masterminds (INTJ)  Inventors (ENTP)  Field Marshals (ENTJ)  i guess i was just trying to find an explanation for myself..dont we all? p/s today was a good day,despite insomnia.&nbsp;2 girls told me i was handsome, and one wanted to screw my brains out. you still got it Zul. ;)

      2 minutes ago  my sister sms'ed me. our cat is dead.got bitten by wild dogs last nite.received 25 stictches.he always sleeps outside.I could see him putting up a fight. That cat had spunk. I still have scratch marks on my arms from his claws while we were playing around.I dont know&nbsp;which is sadder, the cat dying or my grandmother losing a friend. She loved that cat. I remember her sitting at the living room, giggling and talking to the cat.It was her companion when everyone is not at home..Now that me, my brother and my sister moved out, she only has my little sister and my mom..god i hate dogs

      i choose itzli because its the name of the Aztec stone knife god, the god of sacrifice. Why?  Because there have been many sacrifices made these past years and many more to come.  3 days ago i had to make another one, i had to let go someone i truly loved.&nbsp;Amy was at first a friend, a very good friend and i cared for her. We were friends for 2 years and along the way somehow, she fell in love with me.But i didnt love her, not in that way. I was lost that time and i had no room for love or relationships. I was busy trying to get out of that hole i dug myself. But she waited for me.. in her own way  I had a good streak last year, i found forgiveness from my family, i found absolution. I found hope. I found a job at a music store, i had a home, i had a friend i could count on. I started to feel good about myself and i didnt have to force myself to smile. I stopped wanting to run away.Then i met Rini, first i found her annoying but then her bubbly cheerful personality became contagious. I enjoyed it when i was around her and she enjoyed being around me. She was beautiful, radiant, energetic,intelligent. she was an art school girl as well..heh. I fell in love, could you believe that? But she was still in love with her ex.And she was afraid of my past.&nbsp;Man that hurt. hurt so bad i had to cut myself in the bathroom. that was stupid. Really really stupid. I stopped seeing her all together the day she told me.  I was lonely after that, i was sad so i sought out Amy. I needed a friend. as always she was always there, always understanding and strong. she was my Sunflower. But somehow i could see she had changed the last time we met. There was something&nbsp;i recognized in myself&nbsp;in her eyes. It was sadness.  she had been drinking and partying aggresively, and she was doing drugs. She cut classes and her grades were falling. Something wasnt right. She questioned her purpose for being in school, for having to do all of it. I told myself i would be there for her.I didnt want her to make the same mistakes i did.&nbsp;Everytime she looked at me, everytime she dropped those hints, i knew it, i knew she was in love, with me. Those sad eyes.. Then i did something unthinkable. I told a girl i didnt love that i loved her. I lied. I closed my eyes and i clenched my teeth and i lied.&nbsp;That did the trick, she got better,she went back to class, she&nbsp;was happy. I made her happy. it felt good.We took care of each other, we made each other happy, everything was daisy picture perfect.Along the way i fell in love, completely and utterly.Its when you close your eyes and you see that one special person.It was her face. It wasnt Rini's face, it wasnt Emma's face, it wasnt any others but hers.Then i remembered my&nbsp;task. My future, my life.&nbsp;I was broke, working at a music store and i had no&nbsp;future. I wanted to go back to Uni and finish what i started, get a career. it got to me, i began to worry again. It tore me up inside for not being able to give Amy things, sometimes i couldnt even afford to buy her icecream,the only thing she ever asked from me..But she never complained.Bless her.(never have a girlfriend if you are poor, NEVER)I tried and i tried but nothing came up. I was sad again but i didnt give up. I couldnt.  Looking back&nbsp;perhaps it was my fault, i shut down on&nbsp;her and maybe thats what drove her away.She told me she only loved me for me. I didnt&nbsp;believe her and i was right.She wanted more and i couldnt give it to her in time. but i understood it,god i understood it though i wish i didnt and i could just hate her.. and now she's in australia doing her final year in pyschology and dating&nbsp;this guy who's studying art too. ironic isnt it.&nbsp;heh at least i achieved what i wanted in the first place, to make her better, to make her happy.i cant do anything for her now, its up to her to choose whats right and whats wrong and i believe she will do just fine.  and me? i'm still here,alone again&nbsp;but i havent lost hope on myself yet. so here's looking at&nbsp; you Zul, good luck and god speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;p/s dear god please cut me some slack
