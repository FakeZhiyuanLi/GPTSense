      Always fun to have a happy hour piss-up with Fletcher who has, might I add, determined that the drink for the summer will likely be the lovely Sancerre Rose.   Friday morning hangover steps aside to prepare the evening for a Saturday morning hangover as the Author prepares to move on to happy hour round II..  On a different note, Mother Nature must be on crack this week.. Between the sunshine and unbearable heat and the cold, damp rain and hail, my body undecided whether it should suffer from sinus problems, hayfever, colds or frustration.. Congratulations, Mother Nature, you've fucked it again..  Looking forward to a relaxing (!) weekend with the parental units..  Will post again on the weekend..

      London weather has always been a pain but I really didn't want to wake up to a cold damp day this morning. Sometimes I wonder if my mood changes with the weather or vice versa..  Something new I've been reading about recently: "Qualia". A Sony Computer Science Laboratories scientist named Ken Mogi has written several papers on the topic, one of which I've linked below:   urlLink    Will comment further on the topic when I return in the afternoon.. :)

      Have been in Istanbul for the past ten days.. Inconsistent humid weather is not my favorite thing to wear on top of my suit!  After a frustrating Monday, I'm looking forward to whatever chance has in mind for me today. I'm all prepared for it.  Note to self: Don't drink and drive. Hell, maybe you should quit driving altogether.

      You know that the red-faced fucker with the pitchfork is having a good time when I start sweating in my suit before I even get a chance to leave my flat in the morning! Speaking of Lucifer:  After a few weeks of watching Gordon Ramsay's "Hell's Kitchen" (Popular UK reality show with celebrities attempting to work as Gordon Ramsay's kitchen minions, being voted out by the public via phone each week) I've determined that Jordan's tits are indeed filled with helium, I still love cooking and, Gordon is evil incarnate. You gotta love the bloke. ("First you shagged the prime minister, now you're trying to shag me from behind!")  On the downside, the show's like a mikado set on a wooden plank, with Ramsay as the plank. Without him, it's a pile of crap..
