      Here I am trying to download anime all night in this government computer. Somehow I end up losing 4 download that night. These computer is slow and it takes like an hour each. You know how much time jts wasted trying to fix this problem. The whole time I was thinking only if I have my own computers. While I am mad at these computer something horrorable was happening out side the camp. 20 mile south of here is the town of Najaf. Those crazy people was acting up all week, threaten to blow up oil line and stuff. So the US marine when down their and kill 300 militia. They got us here alerted of possible counter attack. The trouble they case us just made me want to go down their to joint the fight. I just hate wearing body armor to walk around the camp.

      QRF (Quick Reaction Force) for those who are not in the military the job of QRF is to be the first responser to any threats happens on camp.  QRF night, like most of my QRF duty I spend hours looking at the night sky. QRF is lame and that shows you how much action this camp gets. Well Iraqi night sky is nice its almost as nice as the Hawai'i night sky. Of couse hawai'i is at a much higher location. The city just don't know what they are missing. I just wish I have a camra that could take picture of the stars so I could show it to people back home. As I lay on top of my hmmvv staring upward at the sky I easy counted hundreds of stars. However I wasn't bore enough to name them. Even thought I feel that they needed names. About an hour into endless staring I notice stuff are flying across the sky. They look like tracer rounds. I was like wow we are under attack. But hmm.... they look like they are 300 miles up in the air. Than I was like well they are shooting no were need us so I just watch the growing stuff flying 300 mile over me for 3 more hours. By the way I did see few huge growing flying stuff fly across the sky. That could of be a missile or a meteor burst. If its a meteor I am going to name it "shooting cock shit".
