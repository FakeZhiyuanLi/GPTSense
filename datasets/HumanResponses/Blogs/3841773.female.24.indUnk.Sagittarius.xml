       So I blow off work today right, and when I went back to sleep after making the fakeout phone call to my scumbag employer, I had the strangest dream.   I don't really remember what happened in the dream, but it sure was strange.   Turning back the clock to late last night on the LIRR, here is an actual exchange that took place between Lorraine "Filter" Cassidy, and myself:   Charlene: So, you won't get a tattoo because you think they're trashy or because of the pain factor?  Lorraine: They're trashy.  Charlene (tatx3): Oh, ok then.   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand here's to a certain unnamed good friend who is hanging out with his unnamed coworker who has an unnamed boyfriend who is out of town today. Good luck with that, buddy. If I see you two around the hood this afternoon, I'm probably going to vomit.   Fresh Lorraine quote, from 3 seconds ago:   Rainy97: whos bright idea was it to do shots?? i feel like poop   I need to have more caffeine immediately.

       Shakespeare Sister! If you know what I'm talking about, then you rock. If you looked it up on the internet, than you rock less, and if you're trying to figure it out because you want to sleep with me, then join the club. Ha ha haaaaaaaaaaaa.   If I were getting laid on a daily basis, I'd probably be a much happier person.

       It's after 9pm and despite my prediction there is still vino left in the bottle.   I''ll admit, it's probably only because I switched to beer for minute.

       Two things that I think are a wasteland. Must See TV is watched almost exclusively by enormous cashiers from Kentucky who collect those Precious Moments figures and semi precious jewelry from QVC. Midtown is inhabited almost exclusively by enormous cashiers from Kentucky who collect those Precious Moments figures and semi precious jewelry from QVC.   Hello, does anyone see a connection there?

       Thank You Lorraine, for totally corrupting my nice peaceful relaxation and recovery day. All was fine until you suggested just "running to the liquor store." Now I'm drunk and I have to take a shower and I don't know how I'm going to accomplish this task. Fuck you. All these years of friendship for THIS?! HA! This cab is really fucking good though.   The whole thing will be gone by 9pm. Unless I take a really long time in the shower.

       Downloading movies off the internet sucks.  MTV Cribs sucks, and this is primarily because I'm not on it.  I should not have eaten ice cream for dinner.  I should stop drinking this beer right now.  I should not have ingested so much beer over the past 72 hours. Nor for the past 10 years-ish, for that matter.  What the hell is the point of M-80's anyway? The explosion isn't even that cool.  Tobey MacGuire was the absolute wrong choice for the role of Spiderman. Have I seen the most recent installation of Spiderman? No, but I was just thinking about it.  The Postal Service rocks.  This painting my brother painted in school rocks.  Will Ferrell is hilarious.  Kickboxing is more fun than an hour on the elliptical machine. Also, it's probably improving my balance.  The Postal Service rocks.  Who in the hell IS this guy on Cribs anyway? I'm sure he made his living ballin' and shot callin'. Fucking asshole. He kind of looks like Dr. Dre, except he has a plunger clearly visible in his bathroom, and that doesn't really strike me as pimp.  Deep Dish was right on the money when they remixed Lustral's "Everytime."  I don't really like the pants I bought the other day, but what I like even less than the pants is the thought of returning them.  I saw someone I went to high school with in the featured Nerve Personals that get e-mailed to me in my weekly Nerve newsletter.  I really fucked up this hamstring.  I wish I had a better working knowledge of HTML and related languages. I could make my site kick ass. But then, I don't really have anything to put up on it anyway.  The Way Out West remix of Lustral's "Everytime" is equally as good as the Deep Dish one.  Now who is THIS guy on cribs? Have they just selected random people off the streets now as celebrities have become more concious and protective of their privacy? Hey, and this John Doe even has several bottles of Cris! Now that I'm paying more attention, I think he might be some sort of athlete. The only think I'm sure of is that he does not make his living with a mic, glove, or bat. That's all that matters anyway. He kind of looks like DMX. Isn't DMX marrying Kelis? I wonder how long her milkshake will keep him occupied for.  Mike Koglins remix of "Everytime" is not nearly as good as Deep Dish or WOW. It's way too close to the original.  I cannot believe I do not have an I-Pod yet. I'm breaking down. I need one.  BMW is the first automobile maker to integrate I-Pods into their auto's. Now that is fucking cool. Leave it to my German brethren.  My So Called Life is/was the best television show to ever grace the airwaves.  Is Sausalito slightly North or South of San Francisco?  I never called that Marc from San Francisco back. I bet he knows where Sausalito is though. Maybe I should call him back.  Why does Shaggy have this old school TV in his crib?  Being a baseball fan is going to kill me before I'm 30. That is of course, if I even make it through this season.  Thursday night at Yankee Stadium was the best baseball game I have ever seen in my life.  My laptop screen is wobbly.  The new Incubus record is better than I expected it to be.  I saw a bumper sticker today that said "Bush Lied." I wanted to knock on the guy's window and say "Oh yeah buddy? Yeah he did, but so did everyfreakingbody else! Politicians LIE, Mr. Idealistic Man, it's their JOB." What a stupid stupid man. They should make a bumper sticker that lists every politician that ever lied. It'd be more like a car cover than a bumper sticker. Ignorant fools.  BT and Micro should collaborate more frequently.  I wonder if there is any of that Ketel One left.  Having multiple jacuzzis and steamrooms in your home leads to alot of sex, I bet.  I created this blog because Evo said so. She's 30 now, you know. Come to think of that, there was that funny guy who was one of those space invaders at her party on Friday night. He was almost wearing my earrings, he was standing so close. I think he was talking about real estate. I don't really find that interesting.  YES, BT and Micro are a match made in heaven. Hahaha, no pun intended there. Get it?

       It is strange that I ended up at Welcome to the Johnsons twice in two weeks, with two different groups of people, having never been there before.   Stranger than that was the Italian restaurant/batcave that primarily caters to the indian set.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; &nbsp;    Red Rock West is always a good time.&nbsp;    It's hilarious that I always insist on getting train beers for the long haul back to the Long Island at 4:30am,&nbsp;drink most of it,&nbsp;and leave just enough to spill on the party next to me when I pass out.&nbsp;   I had a conversation with Evelyn at 5 in the morning.&nbsp; I don't know what it was about.&nbsp; I wonder if she does.&nbsp; Hmm.   That reminds me, I should check my phone to see if I made any stupid phone calls last night.   This room is a fucking mess.&nbsp;    I wonder if William Hung is hung.   I wish Kennedy was still an MTV VJ.&nbsp; Also, I wish MTV was still MTV.   "Being poor sucks," said the girl via the laptop that she paid for in cash just a few short months ago.   Things change really fast and really hard sometimes.   I really really really really want this new job.&nbsp;    I'm glad my face has stopped flaking off, but now my arms are getting out of control.&nbsp; Maybe I'll lose some weight since all my skin is falling off.&nbsp; That would be a pleasant side effect.   I wish I had a bottle of wine.&nbsp; I don't feel like drinking beer.   The PR and Joe really do make a pretty cute couple.   I can't believe my brother said I looked like a stripper last night and told me&nbsp;to watch out for anyone trying to "cop a cheap feel."&nbsp;Where do 12 year olds learn these things?&nbsp; He's a funny boy.   Simon Rex is hot.   As a low carb enthusiast, I often think things have gone too far when I see low carb cereal and Doritos.&nbsp; If you're going to eat cereal and Doritos, just fucking eat them will you?&nbsp; There isn't that much of a difference.   LIGHT BEER IS ALREADY LOW IN CARBOHYDRATES!&nbsp; Do NOT drink that ultra super duper light stuff!&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with you and your Aspen Edge?&nbsp; UGH!&nbsp; You're just going to drink more anyway.&nbsp; Have an Amstel, it actually tastes like beer.&nbsp;    I'm tired.   I'm going to take a nap.    &nbsp;  It sucks that Daniza is leaving tomorrow.&nbsp; Good luck, girl.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Hey, and Lorraine hasn't checked in yet.&nbsp; Better alert the authorities.    &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;     &nbsp;

       So last evening, after another miserable disgusting day, I make the usual walk from above ground hell to below ground hell. When I get there, I notice there are an unusual number of people lingering near the turnstiles, and lined up all the way down the stairs to the jam packed platform. I make my way down the stairs, only to find that there is an uptown 3 train stuck almost entirely in the tunnel. The head car was out, and there was a police officer chatting it up with the train conductor. Neither one of them seemed particularly alarmed about the situation, nor did it seem that anything was going to be done about it soon.   Thus, I decide to book before everyone on the platform caught on and realized they were going to have to take another route. I think to myself, OK, I'll get on the 4 and switch to the N/R at 14th St. Now this, while mildly inconvenient, was not a huge deal. Now, when I went down the stairs initially, the sky was fairly dark, but no weather events were really happening yet. Well, wouldn't you know it, when I left that station, the sky had darkened even more, and there were tremendous claps of thunder and bolts of lightening everywhere. This didn't bother me at all, as I dig that kind of stuff. It was the threat of the impending downpour that was a tad bothersome. I didn't not have an umbrella as usual. Somehow, thankfully, I made it over to the 4 without incident, no rain. Here I am, swiping my MetroCard and thanking Mama Nature for this small favor, when I hear "HEY, don't look so TIRED over there!" At this point, I almost jumped on the tracks, because I recognized the voice. It was none other than one of my very favorite co-workers, Scott. You might recall Scott being profiled in a previous entry. Now, Scott and I had gotten into a little battle earlier in the day, as he thought it would be a good idea to send a 20 minute RMA file as an attachment to an e-mail. I warn him on the perils of this, but as usual, Scott knows everything so he must vehemently insist that that is the ONLY way his client can access the file. I ask "Why can't you just send him the link to the file? It's on the site." He replies, "Well, he can't access it because he doesn't have RealPlayer!" Oh yeah, fuckhead? Then why are you sending him a REALMEDIA FILE?! He has now confirmed my suspicion that the only reason he wanted to send the entire file is because surely, he would look very important and technically savvy to his client if he could accomplish this. He finally decides to just send the link, but not before he calls one of the tech guys, repeatedly says "Well, CHARLENE is telling me that he's not a good idea to send such a big file without compression" and yada yada yada. This in a last ditch attempt to prove me wrong. He asks "What are the benefits of sending the file in it's entirety?" This is not a huge office, and the tech guy sits just on the other side of a cubicle wall, so I heard him loud and clear when he said "There are no benefits. Charlene is right. Just send him the link." Oh, thank you. Really. And here I didn't even finish college. Look at that. Anyway back to the train nightmare. So it's him, Scott, and I have to politely converse with him all the way from Wall to 14th. To be honest, it wasn't too horrible of a conversation, but irritating nonetheless. At 14th, I get off the train and head for the N/R. I get slammed into by a big, wet man. Now, in a different situation, this would not be a problem for me. Big wet men are attractive in some situations. However, this man confirmed my fears that it was now pouring out, and I'm pretty sure some of the moisture could have been attributed to sweat as well. I make it to 34th St. without further incident, but when I get there, you guessed it, I walked right out into the middle of a monsoon.   I believe people should have to have licenses for some things. Among these things are umbrellas, and being allowed to walk anywhere in Midtown at rush hour under any circumstances. I get poked in the head repeatedly, stuck behind families of tourists, etc. It takes 12 minutes to walk a block. I am now soaked. As God was attempting to get the biggest laugh out of the situation possible, he decided to throw me one last obstacle. As I was crossing 7th avenue and almost at the other side, this insane bus driver turns onto 7th and comes to a screeching halt right in front of me, so now I have to go around this stupid bus. By this point, I am hysterical laughing. It was like some ridiculous romantic comedy, only I didn't get to bang anyone at the end.   Damnit.

       Since my work situation is really, really bad, as stated and defined in an earlier post, I decided that instead of doing "work" today, I'd analyze nursery rhymes in an attempt to find their true meaning. I'm pretty sure that that Mama Goose was one freaky chick.   There was an Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe   There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,  She had so many children, she didn't know what to do;  She gave them some broth without any bread,  She whipped them all soundly, and put them to bed.   Translation:   There was an old woman who lived in the projects. Actually, she wasn't really that old. Say like, maybe mid 30's. Anyway, she had slutted around in her 20's, and now she was really paying for it. Well, not paying in a LITERAL sense. It's actually me that pays for it, out of every "paycheck." Bitch.   The Little Pigs   This little pig went to market;  This little pig stayed at home;  This little pig had roast beef;  And this little pig had none;  This little pig said, "Wee, wee, wee!  I can't find my way home."   Translation:   This little pig fit, active, and probably is the only one who ever cleans up after himself.  This little pig is a lazy bastard, and makes messes for the active pig to clean up.  This little pig should probably be a vegetarian, no?  This little pig has an eating disorder. Perhaps a cocaine addiction.  This little pig is an aspiring country music star.   Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. One for my master, one for my dame, and one for the little boy that lives in our lane.   Translation:   Yo man, do you have a coat or some shit? It's fucking cold out here!   Hickory Dickory Dock   Hickory, dickory, dock, the mouse ran up the clock; the clock struck one, the mouse ran down; hickory, dickory, dock.   Translation:   Hickory, dickory, dock, the mouse ran up the clock. The clock struck one...   ...and crushed that little bastard.   Jack and Jill   Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water; Jack fell down, and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.   Translation:   Jack and Jill went up the hill to get it on. Jack fell down because Jill shot him. That's what happens when boys lie.   Old King Cole   Old King Cole was a merry old soul, and a merry old soul was he;  He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl, and he called for his fiddlers three. Each fiddler, he had a fiddle, and a very fine fiddle had he; Twee-tweedle-dee, tweedle-dee, went the fiddlers, Oh, there's none so rare, ws can compare with Old King Cole and his fiddlers three!   Translation:   Old King Cole was a merry old soul because he smoked a lot of dope.

       I am a terrible person. Oh, you knew that? Oh oh, I see. Well, let me give you another reason to believe this.   I have blown off work again today. Somewhere between April and now, I seem to have lost that inherent sense of responsibility toward work. I have never had this problem before. Work has always come first and above all. Maybe that is the problem, come to think of it. Anyway, I could care less what happens to those Wall St. fuckfaces. The idea of busting my ass to make someone else rich and successful has always irritated the hell out of me, but this is like a whole other level. My entire job is to do the same thing over and over and over again. The primary function isn't even interesting, so this redundancy can make one suicidal. I can't imagine how people do the same exact thing over and over every single day for 30 years. You should see the faces of the people on downtown 2/3 in the morning. All blank. My job is horribly soulless, not remotely challenging or stimulating, and I'm quite certain it's making me dumber than I actually am. I cannot afford this deterioration of intellect. I don't have that much to spare, after all.   Let me give you the rundown of a few of the non-stimulators. Be forewarned that this is blatantly stereotypical, and while I hate to be like that, it's just impossible to find anything about these people that is even remotely interesting or outside of a stereotype.   Alan (Al): The big guy. About 70 years of age, Al wanders around the office all day yelling at random employees and once in a while shouting "Where's my MONEY!" He sits at the head at a huge conference table with a cigar hanging from his mouth and his hands behind his head, as if he's expecting a playmate to come in and blow him. No dice, Al. He stocks the office with candy and thinks this makes him the savior. I suppose he is able to afford this with the money he saves by not paying anyone. It appears to me that he only hires people he thinks he can control. If this is the case, he is sorely mistaken about the author of this blog. He believes that nobody can achieve success without his supreme guidance and supervision.   Jack, AKA Jacob: The subject of a recent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jack comes into the office once in a while, says something about the artwork, makes a few calls and leaves. Probably to go back to his bachelor pad in the east village to bang teenagers and girls in their young 20's who have recently made the move to NYC from Iowa. Jack has a face probably even his own mother doesn't love. He covers it up with those big stupid plastic framed glasses that are supposed to be trendy. You're so loaded homeboy, who not get some work done? Jack was born Jacob , but evidently didn't appreciate his Russian Jew roots so he fled his native land and made himself sound as American as possible. Al calls Jack his son, and loves him to death for coming up with the fantastic idea of getting people to pay for editorial coverage.   Jeff: Jeff is a 43 year old divorcee originally from CA, I believe. He's lived in several cities from what I understand. I'm sure I'd understand more if I listened to him, but generally when he talks to me I sit and nod and think about what a phony jackass he is. Also, I think about how good my pen would look sticking out of his eye. Jeff is primarily a nice guy on the surface I guess, but he's still a lying manipulating salesman, so he's worthy of these evil thoughts. He's absolutely transparent. He wears Polo, says things like "Hot Bod" and rides a motorcycle. Jeff is uber confident in his ability to make tons of money. I would imagine this is a characteristic displayed in most salesmen. I wonder though, if they ever actually do. God knows he's not making me a cent.   Scott: Scott is a short curly haired 25 year old U of Maryland grad who was formerly a hotshot salesman at the WSR, but is currently in a drought. This drought, of course, is everyone's fault but his own. It's the market, it's the analysts, it's the damned PR and IR people who are discouraging companies from spending any money. It's the companies I'm getting, it's the analysts! Scott is totally envious of Jeff, and often comments how pathetic it is to be a 43 year old salesman, yet he absolutely idolizes all Al, who is essentially a 70 year old salesman. Scott walks around and feigns importance. He can often be heard on the phone saying "I'll have someone who works for me send you some material" or "It's crazy here, we're totally swamped," when in reality he just sits at his desk with his foot on the wall all day waiting for something to happen. He treats everyone like they're his secretary. Scott is also one of those people who emphasizes random syllables for no real reason, like he has selective tourettes or something. "This IN-terview is now LIVE on the site. Again, Wall Street Re-PORter...ah..." That is a typical sentence that comes out of the idiots mouth. Often he'll comment on something, and when you reply, he'll say, "Oh well, it's a very interesting technology. Do you understand it or do you want me to explain it to you?" or something similar. Yes Scott, I can see how your understanding of technology is far superior to mine, even though my entire background is in technology and YOU can be overheard telling clients how a standard firewall always blocks RealPlayer. You show me 100 firewalls, and I'll show you 98 that do not block RealPlayer. Scott also thinks that Wi-Fi and ZigBee will control the entire world inside of 5, yes FIVE, years. "Overhype, underdeliver," is that the mantra of a salesman?   Michael: Michael runs around in circles dropping&nbsp;slips of paper&nbsp;with cryptic messages printed on them on peoples desks, always has stains on his shirt, and blinks a lot. He has kind of a stutter but I do not think it's clinical, I think it's because he's just really really nervous. Al makes Michael sit on the other side of the office in his own cubicle because he annoys everyone. If Al notices Michael on our side, there is hell to pay. Michael spent a lot of time seemingly trying to get into my business casual slacks, but then one day he said something like "You know, this is not a sexual thing, I'm gay." I could not believe it, he's too skanky. He later retracted the gay remark and then re-stated it. He's fucking crazy, yes. I suppose he could just be a really eccentric gay man but I don't think so. I'm pretty sure only straight men are that nasty. At the height of his harassing me, he came over to my neck of the woods, sat down, and proceeded to tell me how telling a joke is like an orgasm, and how I needed to have one. I stopped listening after that, so I have no idea what his explanation was. I just didn't want to know, man. I finally had to give Michael the coldest of shoulders when his harassing phone calls and e-mails got out of control. Sometimes you just have to blow people off. I just feel like if I interact with him too much I'll catch whatever it is that he has and I'm already twisted enough, thank you.   Russian HR Person whose name I don't even know. We'll call her CRHR: CRHR was hired when Natasha, the first Russian HR person, decided to go back to Russia. Sidenote: I think things have to be pretty bad for you if you flee the United States for RUSSIA, of all places. I'm sure a good chunk of bad could have been attributed to the WSR. Anyway, back to CRHR. CRHR speaks very limited English, spells everything wrong, makes 9's that look like G's, and R's that look like Z's. I once had a situation where I was trying to cash a check that CRHR made out to Charleen Kirchner. With her handwriting being what it is, it actually looked like Chazleen Kizchnez. This obviously did not match the name on my drivers license, and was almost a fiasco, as I had like maybe $4 in my pocket. Luckily, the guy wasn't too interested in what it said and cashed the check anyway. Not that it was for that much.    I have so much more to say I think, but I have to wrap this up because I'm becoming increasingly infuriated and disturbed.

       Six Feet Under is undeniably the best show on television. No argument against this could possibly dissuade me. It is so fantastically brilliant I can't even stand it. "Fine. I'll just resign myself to receiving excrement in the mail" is one of Ruth's greatest lines. "If he's sending us shit in the mail he's part of your life" is the other.   In keeping with the theme of growing up in a family where the business is dead people, let me tell you a story about a friend of mine. We'll call her Lorraine, because that is her name.   Yesterday afternoon, after a lovely dip in the Atlantic, we returned to our little area to find that some seriously vicious seagulls had attempted to make off with a bag containing a half eaten bagel and some assorted condiments, only to be thwarted by a good samaritan who took off after those jokers and retrieved the bag.   Maria, Lorraine's friend from NEU that was visiting the Longest of Islands this weekend, was a few steps behind us, and was understandably puzzled when she happened onto the scene. "What happened?" questioned Maria. Lorraine, quite obviously puzzled at the agility displayed by the good samaritan, who also happened to he an older gentleman, said, "Whoa! Those crazy seagulls tried to make off with those Doritos and the OLD MAN chased those suckers down and got 'em back!"   Mind you, the "old man" in question was approximately 3 feet away from us, and didn't look to be old enough to have his hearing affected by aging just yet.   Yes, Filter Cassidy had struck again. I think this ailment is improving though, as she did make an "uh oh I did it again" face this time.   As a result of this last minute trip to the beach and my new tight schedule in which a job on fucking Wall St. is involved, I decided I had better fry myself up good. Who knows when I'll get to the beach again? I mean maybe after I quit my job tomorrow, but we'll jump off that bridge when we get to it. I think I said the same thing last week. So anyway, I'm all fried up, AGAIN, as if I didn't learn my lesson after the sun poisoning incident of last year. I also have this strange white spot right above the tattoo on my ankle. I don't know how every other spot managed to redden sickeningly, including the specific spot where the tattoo is, but this one spot was really defiant. Luckily, I drank so much yesterday that it wasn't nearly as painful as it is now. I don't remember it bothering me too much last night, but this afternoon it was reported that I kept getting goosebumps and saying things like "Goddamnit, it's like freaking February out here!"   I'd also like to send out an apology to Daniza, Jason, and everyone in Steve's phonebook that got a drunken ludicrous phone call from us due to last nights idiocy. I have to accept full responsibility for this, as it was related to a rule that I had created as President of several rousing rounds of Asshole. Oh yeah, and I'm still President for next time suckers! You know you love it, I created the best rules ever.   So, I ended up having a pretty good low drama weekend, and to top it off, the Yanks finish out the first half of the season @ 55 &amp; 31, the best record in the game. Of course, as I'm writing this, I'm listening to the news where they're reporting that the past 30 hours have been the most violent and bloody of the year in the boroughs, so evidently someone's weekend was not as good as mine. Or, to be more exact, 12 dead somebody's.   I'm out to slather myself in aloe so I can stick to things.

       I started reading a new book this afternoon, and much to my dismay, I came across a word I have never seen before in my life.&nbsp; This never happens to me.&nbsp; The word:    &nbsp;  Concupiscence.    &nbsp;  The meaning:    &nbsp;  Function:&nbsp; Noun   Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Late Latin, concupiscentia, from Latin, concupiscens,   Present participle of concupiscere.&nbsp; To desire ardently.&nbsp; From com-+cupere.&nbsp; To desire.&nbsp; Strong desire.&nbsp; Especially:&nbsp; Sexual desire.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I should have known this.&nbsp; Especially this, since it does apply to my everyday life and all.   &nbsp;

       Booze, Music, Money, Sex, Baseball.&nbsp; These things are tied for first.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   The following are in no particular order.     &nbsp;   Manny Ramirez striking out.&nbsp; He is such a big dumb ass. "I wanted to play for Boston" he says.&nbsp; Oh yeah, fuckface?&nbsp; You do not grow up in Washington Heights and want to be a member of the Boston Red Sox!&nbsp; I grew up on Long Island man.&nbsp; That's about as blasphemous as my saying "Oh, no, no bagels for me thanks."&nbsp; The&nbsp;free thinking thing doesn't work for you Manny.&nbsp;I love the look on his chaw chewing face when the bat swings through after it has forgotten to make contact with the ball.&nbsp; I love how he disagrees with Blue when he&nbsp;gets called out on&nbsp;strikes.&nbsp; Oh YEAH!&nbsp;That shit is SEXUAL!&nbsp;YES YES YES!&nbsp;And I LOVE how he made that bizarre cutoff play the other night vs. the O's.&nbsp;On the plus side of that play though, it was about the best catch that lumbering idiot has&nbsp;made all year.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   HIP HIP...JORGE!&nbsp; No gloves, no appratus, he just goes up there and swings the bat.&nbsp; No pauses, no adjustments, he just produces.     &nbsp;   Mondavi Cabernet.&nbsp; Only $12.99 a magnum.&nbsp; Oh yes, I know a bargain when I see one.     &nbsp;   Fucking around with the heads of 45 year old men who want to bang me.&nbsp; I think they deserve it if they can't take the initial polite hint that I'm not at all going there.&nbsp; Granted, some chics my age think&nbsp;older older men are sexy.&nbsp; That's fine with me; to each his own man, but I just think they're old.     RUBEN SIERRA pinch hitting!&nbsp; Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuben!     Queen.&nbsp; As in Freddie Mercury.     &nbsp;   When LC picks up the tele and goes "Tami Fang."&nbsp; Hahaha, LC,&nbsp; you really are pretty funny sometimes.     &nbsp;   Gary Sheffield.     &nbsp;   9.5 games. &nbsp;

       I like orchestras.&nbsp; I like big dramatic loud buildups.&nbsp; Note on top of note on top of chord on top of note.&nbsp; I like strings and horns and&nbsp;organs and tympanis.&nbsp; Just a thought.  &nbsp;  It's 11:13pm and I'm drunk again.&nbsp; Yep, and this time it's nobody's fault but my own.&nbsp; I went to the liquor store all by myself.&nbsp; I got carded, come to think of it.&nbsp; The same man sold me booze a few days ago sans the request for my identification.&nbsp; Maybe because I was wearing a hat today.&nbsp; Maybe it was because I had my sister with me, and she looks 14.&nbsp; She is, by the way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think last nights&nbsp;"Get drunk and blog!" portion of the evening didn't really work out because I was actually TOO drunk.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I wonder what the problem is tonight.&nbsp; Note it took me 13 minutes to even come up with this crap.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       No, I'm not going to start talking about chads.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Two things:     &nbsp;   1. I kind of felt like the black blog template was a little bland, so I've switched it up to this new fangled colorful polkey-dotted one.&nbsp; It might be a little too cutesy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Comments/suggestions welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  2. The following is NOT a political commentary.&nbsp; I hate politics, and I think all the bastards are lying to us.&nbsp; I don't even vote.&nbsp;     I keep hearing how "tasteful" it was for Michael Moore to NOT show the scenes of the destruction of the WTC and the Pentagon.&nbsp; He chose to illustrate the horror with sound, which I happen to think always has way more of an impact anyway, but I'm weird.&nbsp; I would be willing to guess that a visual affects at least 80% of the population in the same way that sound affects me.&nbsp; I think this actually means I'm smarter than 80% of the population, but that's something we'll discuss another day.&nbsp; &nbsp;So&nbsp;this fucking idiot who is, according to the liberal media and most of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, "taking the high road," is getting kudos for this?&nbsp; Is that a joke?&nbsp; Did all of these people just walk out of the movie immediately following that scene and NOT see the depiction of the horror in Iraq using dismembered and dead Iraqi children, for christs sake?&nbsp; To quote Will Ferrell in Zoolander, "Does ANYBODY else notice this?&nbsp; I feel like I'm taking CRAZY PILLS!"&nbsp; He then goes on to mock and alienate totally innocent, albeit a little "off" Americans living in a tiny Adirondack town in Virginia.&nbsp; Granted, perhaps they're not as (Fuck me, the Yanks just lost) intelligent and knowledgeable as those of us who have access to big things and big information and big books&nbsp;in big cities, but they're just doing what they think is right, and that is supporting the country that they live in.&nbsp; It is irrelevant whether anyone thinks they're right or wrong.&nbsp; They're just people living in a simpler place man.&nbsp; He goes down there to get their opinions, and ends up editing a bunch of words and clips together to make them look stupid?&nbsp; And he gets acclaim because he didn't show 9/11 in graphic detail?&nbsp; HELLO!&nbsp; He gets acclaim because he didn't show 9/11 in graphic detail, but he shows me a 2 year old Iraqi boy burned almost beyond recognition?&nbsp;He shows me a father screaming in agony and carrying HIS dead son through the streets?&nbsp; It's ok though people, he&nbsp;DID NOT, I repeat, DID NOT,&nbsp;show graphic scenes of 9/11.&nbsp; Phew, because that might have really&nbsp;upset me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well Kudos to you, you dumb fuck, you've managed to be exactly like the members of an administration you've spent the past several years trying to smear!&nbsp;Presenting parts of stories&nbsp;to suit your cause.&nbsp; Nice job, Mikey.&nbsp;Then you hear how&nbsp;he's&nbsp;is so "brave" and "courageous" to make a film like this.&nbsp; That might be my favorite part.&nbsp; &nbsp;To me, courage and bravery mean presenting the whole&nbsp;story and letting people judge for themselves, rather than jamming your ideas down their throats.&nbsp; Knowing full well that some people might disagree, think you're wrong, and maybe even have something to say about it.&nbsp; Hell, someone might even be able to prove your scared ass wrong.&nbsp; What a frightening thought.&nbsp; The truth is that you present half a story because you're kind of worried that someone might have an opinion contradictory to yours, and might even have the "balls" to make it known.&nbsp; Maybe even in a fair way.  &nbsp;  Not making all the information available to the public, presenting half truths and stories, omitting&nbsp;fact, these are all things&nbsp;Moore accuses&nbsp;Bush and his cronies of, no?    &nbsp;

       I was just reading on CNN about that freak situation where those people got stuck in a hot air balloon over Baltimore.&nbsp; The interesting part about this is that the ads on the page were all&nbsp;for hot air balloon rides.     &nbsp;   In other news, Jon Liebers sinker isn't sinking.&nbsp; Because of this, the Yanks are down 3-0 in the 3rd.&nbsp; Stop throwing it, bozo.&nbsp; A-Rod and Jeter have both dropped foul balls that they should have had.&nbsp; Foul territory on the left side @ Comerica isn't that tremendous.&nbsp; The two of them look like they were out drinking all night.&nbsp; Good for them, bad for baseball.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I hope the Cheerios I ate give the old tummy a good enough coating to handle all the booze I plan to drink today.     &nbsp;   Oh YES, a PICKOFF!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   This commercial for Zap Lube starring this random Jersey girl that they play on the Yes Network all the time is alternatley hilarious and irritating.&nbsp; I couldn't get to North Bergen if you gave me a map, a GPS, and a chauffer.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I love the Internet.&nbsp; Big fan, I am.&nbsp; One of my favorite parts about the Internet is that it makes human interaction almost completely unnecessary, and since sometimes members of&nbsp;the human race make me nauseated and/or sociopathic, it's better that I have as little contact with them as possible.  I can communicate with others via the written word.&nbsp; I can read the news without having to engage the newspaper guy in one of those ridiculous phony weather related exchanges while I'm forking over the cash and getting newsprint all over me.&nbsp; I can order cd's and books and shoes and food even.&nbsp; The Internet is a beautiful f-ing thing.&nbsp; It is SO beautiful in fact, that in the Microsoft dictionary, it is capitalized.   In the past few years everything has gone the way of the Internet.&nbsp; You can literally do hundreds of things, conduct thousands of transactions, talk to millions of people&nbsp;via&nbsp;the Internet.&nbsp; We can all simultaneously read the news, check out our&nbsp;bank&nbsp;balances, transfer&nbsp;funds,&nbsp;learn how to make chicken marsala, buy the ingredients&nbsp;to do so, and say fuck it and just hire a fucking chef instead.&nbsp; While all this is happening, we are offering our feedback on an internet poll, sending an e-mail to Uncle Gene in Arizona,&nbsp;researching a friends wedding gift registry, getting directions to the church, buying dyeable shoes, checking out a restaurant for this evening, getting movie tickets, and making sure that some snide pseudo intellectual movie reviewer agrees with that particular&nbsp;movie choice.&nbsp;   Yep, I do believe that most things can be done&nbsp;via the internet.&nbsp; Something I do not believe should be an internet activity is dating.&nbsp; I do think that dating does still require some sort of human interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of cyber dating is kind of ridiculous if you think about it. Allow me to break it down: Go to a website&nbsp;a la nerve.com, look at a tiny picture of a face partially obstructed by someone else's&nbsp;hand, read a profile that&nbsp;is so obviously&nbsp;not real or true to the person writing it,&nbsp;and send/receive a message that goes something like this:&nbsp; "Hey I saw ur profile and pict and u look real hot and sound fun n interesting to.&nbsp;I m a 28 yr old ntelligent well read ivy league grad.&nbsp; I m n2 clubbing n rollerblading n taxidermy.&nbsp;Wanna meet fr a drnk?"   Ok,&nbsp;now let's dissect this.&nbsp; What this says to me is:  "I saw your picture and I want to bang you.&nbsp; Here I will insert a blatant lie about myself.&nbsp; Following the lie I will insert these three generic things that range over the broadest spectrum possible so that I&nbsp;have more chances to seem compatible.&nbsp; Let's do something normal and pedestrian together."   After these messages are exchanged, you meet the person, who is inevitably 3 inches shorter,&nbsp;30 lbs heavier, and has about .00003% of the personality indicated in the original ad, which wasn't that interesting in the first place.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;I feel that the biggest problem with the&nbsp;Internet dating sites is that people freaking LIE man!&nbsp; Don't you know that if you are planning to schedule a meeting, the other party is&nbsp;going to see you?&nbsp; Talk to you even?&nbsp;  I think a&nbsp;big part of getting&nbsp;to a good place&nbsp;with a potential mate is CHEMISTRY.&nbsp; How can one assess chemistry via the freaking Internet?&nbsp; No,&nbsp;I'm not talking periodic tables here man. You can have 600 interests in common with someone but have&nbsp;zero attraction to them otherwise. Basically what you're doing is setting up appointments to test chemistry.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just me that thinks it's kind of a time waster.&nbsp;  Now you're stuck in some lame bar&nbsp;on the UES with some person who might not be lame to someone else but is definitely lame to you, drinking lame Mojitos and talking about The Da Vinci Code.&nbsp; Everyone IS reading it, after all.   Now, where did all of this get you?&nbsp; Maybe for a few lucky gamblers, a second date, a good bang, a trip to the cape, whatever.&nbsp;  Like I said,&nbsp;a might be the perfect match for someone else but as for you, you&nbsp;just want an Amstel and a shot of Soco anywhere that doesn't have a line or a doorman or a dress code or a cover.&nbsp; Oh wait, maybe that's just me.&nbsp; The point is that I would not mesh well with a suit, a martini, and a conversation about a recent bestseller at Sutton Place.&nbsp; Could I handle it?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Would I deal with it?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Would the other person have an idea that I wanted to stick my toothpick with the olives on it in their eye?&nbsp; Nope, and that is the beauty of me.&nbsp; That's a story for another day.&nbsp; This isn't about me, man.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am all for entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Make money any which way you can.&nbsp; I am not at all harping on the creators of these websites, as they're probably just trying to jump on the bandwagon and make some loot on the next big thing.&nbsp;The responsibility lies with the users of these dating sites&nbsp;and their unrealistic expectations of finding&nbsp;the L word&nbsp;on a website and paying to do so.&nbsp; You desperados are enabling the Nerves and the J-Dates to continue on like they are a necessary and relevant service, when in reality maybe they are taking you away from the best way to meet your mate, human interaction. Instead of sitting at your computer weeding through profiles of stock brokers and yoga instructors, go to a bar, a party, a bowling alley. A Church, for Christ's Sake.&nbsp; Pun absolutely intended;&nbsp; just couldn't help myself.   Just remember, if you insist on using these "services," screen your candidates carefully, or this could happen to you:  "Hey Jane, look at this, Walter LOVES the outdoors, authentic Guatemalan cooking, and breakfast in bed, just like you!"  Morning after the date: "Yeah, Walter and I do have a lot in common, but Walter has three legs and a wife."   There are the things Internet dating services cannot weed out.

       Oh yes, we have our first guest blogger!&nbsp; This certainly is an exciting moment.&nbsp; This is written by a person who insists they would "never have anything to say in a blog."&nbsp; Looks like something to me, man.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;  Phantom:    &nbsp;   Ikea is a suburban nightmare... Attention Ikea shoppers please refrain from bringing your children into Ikea. They do not want to be here and God knows I don't want them to be here... Strollers have become assault weapons and an excuse for soccer mom rudeness. They will not think twice to cut you off and rolling over your flip flopped toe so they can get a complementary germ ridden yellow Ikea shopping bag&nbsp;&nbsp; They wont thinktwice and they wont apologize either.&nbsp; They wont even think to stop their child from screaming MAAAAMMMY UPPP MAAAAMMMY UPPP at the top oftheir lungs while a long strand of snot hangs from there "cute" little noses... Pick the f-ing kid up and get her a tissue... Oh and then there is the parent that lets the kid run around Ikea like it was a park. This parent yells out "Timmy... no come here mommy is very disappointed in you" Lady he doesn't f-ing care. So parents of long island leave thekids at home...     A seperate thought from the 1st phantom blogger:    &nbsp;  this is something about my job I don not understand... I am sitting here at my desk quite as a mouse...&nbsp;swiftly typing away at my computer... tongue slightly sticking out of my mouth to indicate true concentration... when all of a sudden Phyllis Testa (who farts at her desk and thinks turning on the fan masks the smell) comes up to my desk and asks if I am on the phone... Phyllis do I LOOK like I am on the phone... Do you see my lips moving... do you hear my voice... do you see the phone pressed against my Face... NO YOU DON'T.... this has gone on for 3 years...     ***IMPORTANT NOTE***Guest blogger posts are always completely unedited.&nbsp; You HAD to know that.&nbsp; Would you&nbsp;check out this f-ing grammar, man?

I just want to be unnecessarily rich, have anything I f-ing want, watch the Yanks whilst wasted, and then get laid afterwards. Repeatedly.I ask you God, is THIS TOO MUCH TO FREAKING ASK?!

       For those of you who watch the Yanks and/or have been to the stadium to see a game, you know that they play different songs/types of music for each Yankee batter coming up to the plate.  I.E. Some 50 Cent for Jeter and Sheff maybe, some crazy Salsa for Enrique Wilson and Jorge, and so on.   For Hideki Matsui, they play Lenny Kravitz.   Can someone explain this to me please?

        ...bright like the sunlight...Mama's got the magic of Clorox 2.  In other news, I drove to Yankee Stadium today for the first time in my life.  By this I mean I was actually operating the Bronx bound vehicle rather than just playing drunken radio DJ.  What a fiasco.  This is the last time I let my 78 year old Grandfather navigate anything.  He tried to combine these two different routes so as to save time or avoid traffic or something.  It didn't work out correctly.  I don't know what was so wrong with just taking the ever popular Tri-Boro/Major Deegan combo.  No no, we had to take the Whitestone to somewhere else and bad things happened.  On the way there I almost ended up in Westchester and had to make my way back south.  I succeeded in this, but then I suddenly realized that I had gone TOO far South and somehow ended up too far East as well.  I am now in the ghetto.  My companions for this journey were the following:  Grandpa:  Hilarious man.  One of my favorite people on earth.  78 years old.  Can't see shit. Greg:  Cousin visiting from Ohio.  16.  Nice kid.  No help in this situation. Jamie:  Sister.  14.  There is no explanation needed here. Matt:  Brother.  Recently hit the big 12.  He is SO cute, but he just likes to sit aaaaall the way in the back and talk.  Once in a while he'd notice a street name and just call it out.  Also no help in this situation.   Oh yes, and we're all white suburban people.  I need to get out of the ghetto, right now, stat, let's go.   Grandpa keeps saying "The Grand Concourse, Charlene, we need to get to the Grand Concourse."   I say:  "I know Grandpa, look at the compass, we're going NW."  Grandpa says: "What?  What compass?  Where is the compass?  How do you know we're going North?"  I say:  "The compass says so.  It's right here on my right, the electronic center console thing.  Look, there.  See?  There it is.  The streets are going up, we're going north."  Grandpa says:  "Oh ok, I was just making sure."  The above conversation happens at least 6 times.  I then get into a drag race with a man so I could cut him off and make the next left.  The problem was that there was no next left so now I'm a dick and I just cut him off.  He was pissed.  His Xterra was no match for my Durango anyway.  I think we got there without further incident.  On the way home I made this quasi left-ish u-turn that was SO bizarre in nature that I couldn't even accurately explain it via the written word.  At one point I was actually facing the wrong direction almost entirely and kind of in oncoming traffic. 2 (two) police cruisers witnessed this spectacle.  Neither one stopped.  I swear I initially though it was a legal move anyway.  Those lines on the road HAD to be for something.  I have since been contacted by the NYPD and told that I am never allowed to drive in the Bronx again.   Driving is bad for me anyway.  I think too much when I'm driving.  I'm not thinking about driving though, and this is the primary problem.  Oh, and the Yanks got trounced.

       Saturday morning after a long night of drinking I awake to find part of my ceiling had collapsed. There are tiles, screws, nails, and some sort of saw dustish substance everywhere. There are electrical wires hanging out of what was previously a tiled ceiling but sadly, none of them are exposed and/or live, and they do not respond to my repeated attempts at self electrocution by licking them. Anyway what happened was, after I thought I had been hearing intermittent clacking noises but kept dismissing them as a dream about skittles, I finally hear this loud crash and go to investigate. I see the spectacle before me and am like "whuuuuuuuut?" I stood there dizzy, kind of nauseous, half naked and totally confused for a minute. Then I just said fuck it and went back to bed.  Later in the day, after 78394 cups of coffee/cans of Diet Pepsi, I realize the dust is probably imbedding itself in my lungs and suffocating me, and I went outside and smoked a butt so I could think about what to do. I decide to clean it up immediately.  More alert now, I assess the situation and think this is a job for the manly Shop-Vac, not the wussy Hoover. I only know where to find the manly Shop-Vac because I keep tripping over it in the laundry room. The cord is like 4 inches long. I wonder if that's a metaphor. Anyway, obviously, this requires me to get an extension cord. I miraculously find this item all by myself, simply by looking for it. So now that I have everything together, I plug this bad boy in and fire it up. I start furiously attacking this mess and realize suddenly that it has become very difficult to see or breathe. Only 60 seconds have passed, and I look up and notice that the entire room is filled with smoke. I still don't know if it was from the dust that had fallen out of the ceiling, or if the manly Shop-Vac wussed out. I suspect it is the Shop-Vac that has become fussy, and I think that since I am already at risk of starting an electrical fire (what with the wires hanging out of the ceiling and all) I should unplug it. So as not to damage my lungs any further, I leave the room to go smoke more so I can contemplate my next move. I obviously can't just leave it there for several reasons. One, I hate messes. In particular, looking at them for extended periods of time. Two, the dust was probably really killing me And three, who the hell else is going to clean it up? The "Ceiling Tile &amp; Dust Cleaning Fairy?" Additionally, it was SO hot out and I was missing the Yankees.  I have no other choice other than to break out the wussy Hoover.       The fucking thing is like an animal. No mess stands a chance against this machine. It rolls by itself right into the fray like it has eyes and can SEE it's challenge before it. I plug in the attachments and the thing still doesn't back down! It keeps RIGHT on moving even though the suction has now been redirected to the connected tubes in my hand. I swear I heard it growling at one point. Anyway, I finally just plant my foot on top of it so it stops advancing, and go at the mess myself with the tube thing. The rest is history. Mess gone. All better.  I think this is a testament to the fact that size doesn't matter.

       I have long since made it clear about my distaste for Indians in general. Not feather wearing chiefs, but dot-wearing Jericho dwellers. Only those from Long Island will understand the previous sentence.  Thus, I don't know what spurned my newfound interest in this crazy Indian/Indian inspired music. I am currently going on a downloading spree and have uncovered some pretty fucking cool shit. Good beats and new sounds slammed together in an almost unnatural fashion...but it works. Well. I feel like going out and partying even. Jay-Z and Missy Elliot are even involved. Here I am complaining about the music industry having no balls and how nothing is new and it's all nonsense, yet there is all this new stuff right in front of me that I don't know about. I think this is because I've recently seen Bend it Like Beckham. I'm too prejudiced. Why, just yesterday I said that if I were gay I'd NEVER date a Spanish chic because they're fucking crazy.  I wish I could elaborate on this music situation because I have so many thoughts on the matter. It's just that I'm so fucking stupid and now it's finally coming out. I cannot write or speak properly anymore. I couldn't find the words to describe a fucking apple eloquently if I tried.  It's so fucking hot and I'm almost out of beer.  And I just told my sister that having a creative mind sucks, and she should abandon her creative side and become an accountant instead. Yep. No more Ketel One for me thanks.  Lastly, the aforementioned sister has decided she will call me Big Money C from now on. Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa, is that a funny contradiction or WHAT?! Hahahahaha. Oh life. Hahahaha about life. Hahahahaha.

       Much like those "It's good to be..." and "The Fabulous life of" type shows represent what I like to call destructive television, I think WebMD is destructive use of the internet.        I think they should take it down.  I'm writing a letter.      Just as soon as I get back from the Dr.
