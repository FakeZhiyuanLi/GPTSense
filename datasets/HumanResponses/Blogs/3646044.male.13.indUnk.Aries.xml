       According to   this  urlLink article , the Dean Scream wasn't nearly as bad as it seemed. Apparently, he was using a microphone designed to filter out noise from the audience. People who were actually there to see Dean speak could hardly even  hear  his now-famous shriek, the audience was cheering so loudly. So, contrary to my previous assumption, Dean didn't really screw it up for himself (though the speech in itself was pretty terrible). The media screwed it up for him.       I finally took the initiative to find out Dean's positions on the issues. I agree with him on most points - I tend to agree with the Democratic Party in general - but there are a few key exceptions. For instance, he supports the death penalty and the right to gun ownership. So I don't particularly regret not supporting him from the beginning.      I then took a  urlLink quiz  to test how my opinions match up to those of the candidates. My results are as follows, from best match to worst: Ralph Nader, Carol Moseley Braun, John Kerry, Wesley Clark, Dennis Kucinich, Dick Gephardt, Howard Dean, Al Sharpton, John Edwards, Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush. Yes, Bush is dead last, as expected. I am a little surprised that Kerry is so high on the rankings. I guess I'm just not thrilled with how he's running his campaign. (On the other hand, I liked how Kucinich ran his. Too bad he's a hopeless dweeb and therefore never had a chance in hell.) Really, when the so-called most liberal member of the senate is using his military record as the focal point of his campaign, we have a problem.       Which brings me to my next point. I've recently become interested in the  urlLink Green Party . I believe in the importance of environmentalism, non-violence, social justice, and grassroots organizing - the four main ideas to which the Greens are committed. The two major parties are both ruled by corporate interests, while the Green Party is truly government by the people for the people. It's time that the duopoly over US politics is broken. So, check out the website, register Green when you're old enough, and maybe together we can build a party to rival the Democrats and Republicans.      I know, I know - the problem with being a Green is that voting Green just takes votes from the Democrats. This is why we need Instant Run-off Voting. Using this system, people would rank the candidates on the ballots. For instance, let's take the 2000 election. Voters who supported Nader would've ranked him #1, Gore #2, and Bush #3. The ballots would've been counted, and since no candidate would've gotten over fifty percent, the candidate with the least number of votes (Nader) would've been eliminated. His votes would go to the second choice on each of the ballots - generally Gore. This system eliminates the risk of third party candidates spoiling the election for major candidates. Also, it allows small parties to grow by giving voters no reason to fear giving the election to the Republican. And if we had used this system in 2000, Bush would not be our president.       Here ends a rather long and unorganized post that truly doesn't deserve the title "Poor Howie" as it's not about Howard Dean as much as it is about the Green Party. Oh well. That's just how I work. So, my first post to this blog, and you can surely tell from the randomness of it that I don't really belong in a blog for intelligent people...

      This is an article from my other blog: Under the Ice at astuteobservation.blogspot.com that I thought was extremely relevant to this page.  Adults have a common problem of classifying young people as one mass, not normal people but sort of semi-human group with relatively consistent opinions and tastes. Think about it and you'll see what I mean. Signs of it are everywhere: Kid's meals, kid's Post, kid's shows. All this because of the mistaken belief that all kids like the same things. This amalgamation of America's youth is a symptom of a bigger problem, which I call the "Sub-Human Child Mentality." This, quite obviously, is the belief that, as a very wise man so cogently put it, "children are in training to be people." People with this mentality (most of the adult population) assume that children have not developed a full enough spectrum of emotions, thoughts and experiences to be treated as relevant members of society. I, as someone who has recently undergone the change from a childlike mind to a more adult one, can testify that this isn't true. As a child, one is more fresh, more alive, more human in many ways than an adult. A young person hasn't had as many bad experiences as an adult, so their minds aren't clogged with fear. This is why children's opinions should be respected. I'm not trying to pretend that young people can decide everything by themselves. It is incredibly important, especially in the early years, that an adult's experience by factored before a decision is made. In an ideal world, experienced adults would explain the guidelines and limitations they understand from a long life, then let children decide within those parameters what they believe. The Sub-Human Child Mentality has grave repercussions in a young person's life, the primary one being inability to express oneself. Because children are not viewed as people with valid opinions, they don't get chances to say what's on their minds when they're young, and grow up not knowing how to communicate. It's satisfying to avenge all the young people who were classified as "below normal intelligence" or "ADD" because their culture disrespected them and not because they were born with a sub-normal cranial capacity. There are two fronts that must be tackled in the destruction of the Sub-Human Child Mentality and it's replacement with a respect for the young. First, there are the adults who must be re-educated to understand the ideas stated above. Second are the children, who will need no more than freedom and encouragement to make their mark on the world.

      What's your favorite part of the newspaper?  For me it's the editorial.  If I could have only one page of the newspaper, I would take the editorial page.  Or maybe the front page.  Let's just say that I'd go for section A.  Frankly, there's a lot of dumb people out there.  Then they write their annoying pro-Bush articles.  Make sure you read today's editorial, Elm.  There's a horrible letter about how Kerry is evil, etc. that really got under my skin.  But there was also a letter of questions to ask yourself about the candidates that was clear-cut, concise, and wonderful.

      On the war in Iraq:  People tell me that the war in Iraq was necessary, that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, and he was going to attack us with WMDs. After I finish laughing, I reply as follows:  "A) Although Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, he was killing fewer Iraqis than we have in our war. Isn't it also more important to focus on the welfare of our own country before we take into our own hands the welfare of another country? After our country is in working order (no multi-billion dollar defecit), then we can focus on other countries, some in far worse condition than Iraq. We can do this in peaceful ways, such as providing basic immunizations (the money spent in Iraq could have paid for basic immunizations for every child in the world for 42 years!).  B) Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. And don't come back to me in a month or so telling me that I was wrong, because they 'found' WMDs, which they probably will. There have been numerous inside reports of WMDs being flown into the country, not to be dropped, but to be "found"."  Someone needs to teach "President" George W. Bush. I mean that in a literal, non-threatening way. Please don't arrest me I'm just a minor. (Damn Patriot Act)!

      Quite frankly, I do not belong here.  Yes, I am a youth of the nation.  No, I am not informed.  No, my intelligence is not greater than that of many adults.  Yes, I have thoughts and opinions that differ from most.  No, they are not beyond the intelligence of any.  I guess all I've got is an annoying habit of forcing in my two cents worth.  But maybe that's all I need?

      What is my voice? My voice is who I am What I like What I dislike What I want Who I want. My voice speaks in many ways. My art. My writing. My music. My appearance. When one is young, They want to be heard more than ever. When one is young, It is harder to be heard than ever. But just as long as my voice echos through my head through my heart through my Blog MY VOICE IS STILL HEARD.  Poetry by Me.

      Blah....today sucks.  A)My sister is sulking because she doesn't want to go to swimming. She is embarassed about some really ugly scabs on her face she got from wiping out on her bike. Funny...She fell because her helmet, wich was on her handlebars-not her head-somehow made her fall. Darwin Award all the way.  B)My brother is sulking because Dad got mad at him for not turning on the stove. My bro is afraid to turn on the stove by himself because he does it wrong and all the gas blows up in his face. He left his half cooked eggs in the pan on the stove. They will go to waste.   C)My dad got in a power struggle with my brother about the eggs. It was pathetic. My dad is 54, my brother is 10. For the gods' sakes, they need to realize that neither of them are acting their age. My dad needs to learn that my bro will refuse to conform. Dad needs to conform and trick my bro into conforming. Get it?  D)It's raining.  E)All my friends are out of town.  I've been glued to the computer all day, listening to music. "I beleive in a thing called love" by The Darkness just finished and "I wanna rock and roll" by KISS just started. I have too much time on my hands. I need a job. Just insaled a scanner to our computer so I can upload some of my artwork.

      Tatchel...Although I appreciate your flattery, I feel that you are gravely mistaken in your judgement.   a)The type of kids that post blogs (the kids that you are seeing) are not good representations of America's kids. The type of kids that Blog are the intelectual kids that make America look good. In America there is a wide range of kids...Going from horrificaly stupid and anoying to smart, intelectual and prematurely wise child prodigies.   b) I am curious what movies and TV shows from America that you have seen. Few TV shows or movies that are accualy targeted towards teens our agesare as intelectual as you say they are.  c) American in general are pretty imbicile. *See post 'Political Stuff'  I'd love to talk with you some more so keep on posting!

Mugger, Blah, Weeble, Farting dildo, etc. For checkin' out girls that we have no chance with... For burning stuff (hehehe)...For shooting stuff... Good times. Rock on! -Jordan Caldon: You have always been there for me...Even when we were fighting (sorry) I could recall advice that you had given in the past. You were willing to take me back when we made up...Despite our social class differences, you've stuck with me. I still wish that I hadn't dumped you and let us drift apart. From the good times with Connor...To the  other  good times. Berwick hopefully won't be a roadblock. Lots of love. -Will Walker: EVERYONE is afraid of us! "touch my butt-on" "my...butt...itches..." "SNAIL!" "Observe the tall fences surrounding the school..." "I want pi" "OWWWW!" -Katie Deangelis: Thanks for giving me a second chance! See, I'm not such a total loser...Sorry for my 'antics' in my younger years. Yeah. -Hannah Glover: My Cinquain said what I needed to say...accomadating to my bizare sense of humor...friendly...Regis...Bart...Nelson...  DIANE KRUGER, ANGELINA JOLIE, AND URSULA ANDRESS! -Emma Westrasmus: See above. Your intelligence and strong opinions shed light on many subjects for me. You made me more intelligent, I made you more tainted. Sorry. That's just the way I am.  -Keely Ryan: To quote Adam Sandler, "Sorry I'm not better looking!"

Any way...Now that I'm done listing people that nauseate me, I will move on to things that make me want to break out the ol' flamethrower. -Dogs barking non-stop especialy when I'm trying to catch some Zs and the dog has a high pitched bark. -Food thay gets left out of the fridge and turns CRUSTY. Crusty is a word that I hate to use unless it is in reference to Krusty the Clown. (Simpsons rock the house.) -When people add the french word "Tres" to an english adjective such as "tres cool," "tres awsome," or "tres sexy." -Drama queens. When some girl is crying because some guy was hanging out with some friends instead of slow dancing with her, that just is really anoying. OMG...You're gonna die! -Clutter. Useless stuff lying around that no one has the initiative to pick up. Junk. -Animals and people that smell. I don't know what it is that smells about you, because whenever I try to figure it out, I throw up.  -Inconsistency.   Trust me folks...I have more. That's just the preliminary list.

      I was looking for some inspirational junk on the net to help me in my writing and I found a handbook to journalism. The Handbook outlined some basic guidelines to journalism. The first was to write down your pains, fears, worries, and discomforts before they make you ill. This seemed like a good idea because it gives me an excuse to complain. Because school is now out I am entitled to list some people that make me want to wretch. Let's begin. (Please don't hate me)      Austin Richards: You really need to assess your priorities in life. Unless you apply to a private high school, your middle school grades don't matter. That problem is out of the way. Unfortunately, your permanent record is warped from your bad decisions: bullying, drugs, and premature sexual intercourse. Look at yourself. See your weaknesses. See your strengths.   CHANGE  . Bullying people in middle school will not help you. I may be an underling now, but what makes me a 'nerd' now will make me president if I so choose when I am older. What you may think makes you 'cool' now will make you a convict when you are older. I am terribly sorry that you come from a broken household, but that doesn't seem to affect Cynthia in a major way.  IT ISNT TOO LATE FOR YOU. IT WILL BE TOO LATE TOO FAST!      Josh Fisk: Unlike Austin, you walk on the dark side but you don't run on the dark side. IE: If you continue to live the way you do now, you will end up like Austin is now. You are a good kid...Something drove you to change that. The choices that you have made have been bad ones, but it should be relatively easy for you to make better ones. Don't be a follower. You sided with Austin when he first picked on me, but you lost interest and began to warm up to me.       Sara Hatch: It is fine to be a Goth. It makes you individual, but to be an individual who chooses to dress all in black is better than being a robot that wears makeup and dresses in 'Abercrombie and Fitch'.  BE AN INDIVISUAL. DONT BE A LOSER . Wash. Wear clean clothes.  TRY TO SUCCEED . To be an individual is okay. To have bad hygiene and not to even try and improve your life is NOT.       Katie Deangelis Ella Nimmo Maddy Roberts Lauren Belady Tiffany Whoever Tess Crane Devin Kirby and all the other popular girls whos names won't come to me right now:  BE A FREAKIN' INDIVIDUAL . Have an opinion of your own. Start a style cut your hair short. Do something that makes you stick out?  DON'T BE MEAN TO YOUR UNDERLINGS . If you’re not mean to them already, go a step further and acknowledge us.  DO A GOOD TURN DAILY . Good examples of people that are nice and individual are... Bridget Hart and Marie Collins. I would consider both of them to be popular, nice, and  INDIVIDUAL .      Noah Brickner Wood:  YOU AREN'T BLACK. STOP TRYING.       Ibo Oner:  DON'T BE A JERK! "Be nice to nerds, chances are you'll end up working for one some day."     -Bill Gates      Laura Gallant: If you are fighting with someone, and they try and make up, don't be a moron. Make up with them.

      I said that I'd get into political stuff in a different post...and this is that post. Here's my political standpoint: DEMOCRAT Let's start by looking at some of the dumb stuff that Bush has done. First of all, he had his liscence removed for DUI. Consequentaly, he was the first president to enter office with a criminal record. During his term as governer of Texas, he made Austin the most poluted city in America, instead of LA. As president, he started a war that killed over 700 american citizens and over 1000 Iraqis. Bush racked up the largest defecit that our country has seen since the Great Depresion (4 trillion dollars). Oh yeah. The entire reason we went to Iraq in the first place were WMDs. Well mr. Bush...Were are the freakin' WMDs!!!

I don't think anyone does. (If you know, please comment!) So my goal in life is to find the goal of life in general. Wow. That was really random

      Blog number 1 So there's this girl that I like. I had someone I know (Nancy, not her real name) tell her that over the phone. When I asked the Nancy what was said the next day, she gave me this note. "I found something out today," said Nancy "Yea," said u know who "Miles likes you" Nancy "O OK" said u kno " just thot i'd tell you" Nancy "OK" said u kno who The above note was not altered in any way.  Oh, OK? What kinda response is that when you find out that someone likes you? It should be like, "For how long?" or "No way!" or even, "Ewwwwww!" Those responses would at least give me some idea of how they feel. But "Oh, OK"? What kinda response is that! Anyway, That's my rant for today. Tommorow yearbooks come out and we have no classes cuz of this thing our school does were we run a mile for gym. Tommorow is the accual run and the whole school goes out to watch. Chao!

      This was all written by a 13 year old like you and I. It is very similar to my views, but he manages to articulate them in a much better way than I would be able to. I went through and highlighted the key sections because these few paragraphs are above the reading levels of many of my peers.   The Sub-Human Child Mentality   "Adults have a common problem of classifying young people as one mass, not normal people but sort of  semi-human group with relatively consistent opinions and tastes . Think about it and you'll see what I mean.  Signs of it are everywhere : Kid's meals, kid's Post, kid's shows. All this because of the  mistaken belief  that all kids like the same things.

I, as someone who has recently undergone the change from a childlike mind to a more adult one, can testify that this isn't true.  As a child, one is more fresh, more alive, more human in many ways than an adult .  A young person hasn't had as many bad experiences as an adult, so  their minds aren't clogged with fear  .

It's satisfying to avenge all the young people who were classified as "below normal intelligence" or "ADD" because their culture disrespected them and not because they were born with a sub-normal cranial capacity.  There are two fronts that must be tackled in the destruction of the Sub-Human Child Mentality and it's replacement with a respect for the young. First, there are the  adults who must be re-educated to understand the ideas stated above .  Second are the children, who will need no more than  freedom and encouragement  to make their mark on the world."    posted by Zak the Philosopher

      I haven't been posting much lately for one reason or another...I guess nothing has really sparked in me since that corny little poem I put up...But t was suitable at the time of it's writting. Since I've posted last has been a bit of a rush, in retrospect. I did some interesting things: -Waterskied -Met Evan, who will be in my Berwick class next year. -Got together with Cristian -Got together with our friends the Drakes, whom we met camping years ago. -Got together with our friends the Batts (Shelby and Diana were good friends in preschool) -Got a book I've been wanting for a while -Got together with our friends the Puffs. (from our old Playgroup from when we were kids) -Played paintball at Bryce Harding's house.  I'll be heading off for two weeks of camp on sunday, be back home for one night, then off to another camp for another week. Should be quite a rush...

      Alrighty, then! Today was my first full day back from D.C., so I took the day to unpack and help straighten up the house. Anyway...Here's the play by play of our trip.  We woke up at six to drive down to Boston where we'd catch the train to D.C. unfortunately, my sis' had been sick the first couple of days and my parents weren't even sure if we'd be goin'. The trip was almost called off! Luckily my sister mustered up her energy and we packed for my winy little bro' last minute, piled into the car, and headed out. We were afraid that we might miss the train, but we managed to catch it. One breathtakingly boring seven or eight hour train ride later we found ourselves in D.C.. We took the metro to Dupont Circle, home of one of the longest escalators in the world! We walked the few blocks to our hotel and checked in, luckily making it in time for "happy hour", actualy two hours of free drinks and snacks!  The next day, after the buffet breakfast (courtesy of the hotel), we took the metro to The Mall. For those of you that don't know, The Mall is not actualy a mall, just a long chunk of grass in between the capital and the Washington Monument. We walked up the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. In front of the museum, there was a thing set up trying to persuade people to become vegetarian. They were playing a movie of a slaughter house, which very vividly depicted pigs having their throats being cut. Uncensored. Yuck. I'm now vegetarian (But we'll have to see if it works out). Inside the Smithsonian we decided to see the Gems and Minerals exhibit. We saw the Hope Diamond, which six years ago was appraised a $60,000,000, but is now said to be priceless. We also saw tons of gold and silver and other rocks and junk. Sweet. That took up tons of time though, so we decided to leave the Smithsonian. I mentioned that I had heard from a friend that the Air and Space museum is good, so we decided to check it out. I wasn't really that interesting, the best things were all the planes and missiles and rockets and the like hanging from the ceiling. We had lunch at a McDonald's in the food court (Broke one of my vows, no McD's, and another vow, no meat. What can you do). We left the Air and Space museum, and headed home (hotel).  The next day, my sis' felt like crap so she stayed at the hotel. Again, we took the metro to The Mall but this time walked down, past the Washington Monument to the newly built WWII memorial. It was really cool...The neatest feature were the brass plaques showing scenes from the war and the draft. Cool. Then we walked down to the Vietnam Memorial, only to find that all but a small section was closed. Even that little bit gives you a real idea of how many died in that equally stupid war. A real shame. We then headed down to the Lincoln Memorial, which was massive and grandly breathtaking. We were all very pooped and hungry, so we took an expensive cab to the USDA (US department of Agriculture) where we heard there is a great cafeteria. Unfortunately, the USDA is the largest building of all of the US departments, so we failed to find it. My little bro' was complaining profusely, so I led him and my Gramma through the metro back to the hotel while our parents split off to investigate the National Gallery of Art. In a few hours, the rain was pouring down around the hotel. In fact, they sandbagged off one area where all the water was poring off the streets (clogged storm drain) and down a ramp into the garage. They had a bilge pump working and sandbags holding back the water. Impressive. Our parents got in a little while later totally soaked. After they changed, we headed down to happy hour, and happy-a-fied ourselves. If you are still reading at this point, I admire your perseverance. You can do it. Only two more days.  The next day we headed out to see the White House. It was a long walk. A very long walk. But this was cool: In the movie Fahrenheit 9-11, there is a scene were Michal Moore visits the White House. Or at least stands outside and smirks. Anyway...There is this woman there that lives in a little plastic hut thingy with all sorts of signs protesting Iraq and nukes and the like. In the movie, she talks with Michal and the other woman, who tells her about her son in Iraq. That woman is still there, and has been there on the street 24 hours a day since August 1st, 1981. I had a chance to talk with her briefly, but she seemed a bit loony, so we drifted away. We walked and walked, aiming for the National Gallery of Art, which my mom thought we should breeze through. We stopped on the way for frozen custard. Mmmmm...In the Gallery, we saw a few famous pieces including Van Gogh's  urlLink self portrait  and Monet's  urlLink The Japanese Footbridge . My personal favorite piece was  urlLink The Sanctuary of Hercules  (looks better in real life) because of how realistic the stones and tree look. In my opinion, the piece would be better without the people. We were very tired again from all the walking so we headed back to the hotel, again in perfect time for the beginning of happy hour. Yay.  Our last day we got up, had breakfast, wrapped up our packing, and headed out. Remember the huge long escalator at Dupont Circle I wrote about earlier? It was broken! We had to walk the whole way with out luggage! Grrrrrr... Anyway...In another twist of ill fate, the metro was under construction so we had to wait about 25 minutes for a train, which was held up for about 10 minutes at one stop waiting for the track to clear. When we finally got off, we had to run to catch the train, which we ended up missing anyways. Yay. We managed to get seats on the next train out of there, which we boarded successfully. The first four or so hours passed uneventfully, but about halfway through the ride I met a group of three girls my age headed to camp. I particularly like one of the girls named Kory. I learned from her that all three of the girls were celeiacs, which means that they can't eat grains. The camp they were going to was all for celeiacs, which I thought was pretty cool. They got off about an hour before we did, which was a major bummer. It was sad parting, but I got Kory's email, screen name, and website (not a blog, geocities). We got back, and drove home. Like I said, today was spent tidying up the house from our five day leave of absence.  You are now up to date on the everyday happenings of me. Don't you fell special.

      Tommorow we leave for The Center of the Center of the World...Ah, I love being American (not really) Anyways, we'll be taking a loooong train ride to D.C., where we'll stay for three or four days. We'll see all the sites, memorials, and museums. Most of them, anyway. My mom still won't let me wear an anti-Bush pin. Damn secret service.  Today was quite uneventful. Vacuumed, gamed, blogged, and packed. Boring.  I'll try to blog from D.C., but our hotel might not have internet service.  Hasta Luego, The Reactor

      Dangit, I have no purpouse. My summer is wasting away. Aside from camp, I have done nothing productive. I want to get back to my school routine, but am worried about starting at a new school. I've been working out...That's the only productive thing I've done over the past couple of days. Blah. One and a half books on my required reading list. I like to read. Just not when I  need  to read. I hate being forced to do things. Feeling like I have no purpouse. Mom won't let me get a anti-Bush pin to put on my backpack. Mom also won't let me get an anti-Bush sticker to put on my nalgene bottle. Mom also won't let me put anti-Bush stuff on the net. Whoops. Mom, if you've been reading my blog, DON'T.  I love disjointed ramblings.

      I recently saw two movies: Girl With a Pearl Earing and Anchorman.  Anchorman: although funny, it was not quite as good as I hoped. A lot of the really funny parts were shown over and over in the comercials, which spoiled many of the jokes. Will Ferrel was great though, and the co-stars supported him well. The funny parts that weren't spoiled by the comercials were, well, funny! 8 of 10 stars.  Girl With a Pearl Earing: This movie was slow and quiet. There was very little speech, very little plot, very little conflict, and almost no conclusion. Don't see the movie. Read the book instead 3 of 10 stars.

      This post may spoil the book for those people who haven't read it. Please be catious when reading.  Philip Pulman is a bastard. A brilliant bastard. His "His Dark Matterials" Trilogy is a work of controvercial genius, no doubt. He masterfuly allows the plot, characters, and book in general to expand and complexify. The Golden Compass, the first book, begins with one girl in one place. By the last book, the reader has experienced one girl, one boy, witches, bears, aeronauts, ghosts, specters, harpies, spread across a score of unique worlds. But back to my first point. Philip Pulman killed my favorite character. (Lee Scoresby). Philip Pulman made Will and Lyra fall in love. We all were just waiting for it to happen...But I didn't like it...Just as the series is concluding, one more stupid twist is thrown in! Then he goes and  splits them up ! Grrrrrrrrr... Philip Pulman made the book much too personal! By the end of the series you are taking each twist, each death, each parting, very personaly and emotionaly! Damn  brilliant  book! A MUST READ!!!!

      I love technology. It rocks. And I'm not neccesarily talking about military technology or science lab technology. No, plain old urban around the house technology is enough to rock me down to my second pair of socks (  ;) Jordan ). Honestly. First of all, just take a good look at my blog. I managed to do all this in about two months. I work on my Blog (tech I), then go downstairs and microwave some dinner (tech II). Then I hooked up a device that plays audio from the computer on my stereo (techs III&amp;IV). Soon I'll head down and watch a bit of TV (tech V). Technology rocks. On a seperate note...Nah. Technology rocks.

      Woohoo! I'm psyched to discover that Keasby Nights is not the only really-great-get-up-and-skip-around-the-room-singing-so-loud-that-your-neighbor-calls-up-angrily song by Catch 22!! I think that I'll need to buy the CD! The only problem is...Which one!  Biked up to Jordan's house today, and we hung out. We had trouble getting her bro Mikal to buzz off, but he left after we stopped trying to get him to leave! Arggg!  Cleaned my room and my stairs today...Jordan could do the same (sorry Jo). I was happy to find that I have a carpet. Crazy!  I also worked on my HTML coding on my Blog. I finally got everything working correctly. I added a few things also. My feng shui feels balanced with my blog and room both tidy.  Today is turning out to be a snazy day!

      You know when you go onto those websites that rate other peoples blogs, and you look at these highly rated blogs with tons of features and thousands of posts, and you go,            "Holy crap. I want my blog to look like that"? But those people accualy lead interesting lives. They do neat stuff. They have things to write about. But honestly... as I'm thinking this, I'm goin':            "Hell no, Miles. Since May 29th, 2004, you've; Spent 10 days traveling through Japan. Gone to summer camp for two weeks. Gone to Boy Scout Camp for one week. Soon your Gramma will be visiting, and then you go to visit Washinton D.C. for four days, then, when school starts again, you're begining 8th grade at a completely new private school. So don't fuckin give me that bull that your life sucks."  Here's where my problem lies: I don't have the initiative to put all those crazy thoughts and experiences into writing...I don't think...            "Wow, that was friggin cool...I'll put it on my blog!" I just don't think that way. And I need to start. So I will start posting my feelings, thoughts, and experiences, begining with our trip to Japan, which took place about two weeks before I started my blog (There's my excuse)     JAPAN

      You know that kind of song that makes you so exited and exilarated that you blast it from your stereo and junp up and down in the room? Yeah... Anyway...I heard this song  one single time  at camp and could not get it out of my head! I was desperate to find out the title and/or the artist so I could get it! I spent an hour on the net finding the artist, then the song, then a program that would allow me to download songs. I downloaded the program, downloaded the song, then uninstalled the program.  I love this song!  If you're curious, the song is Keasby Nights by Catch 22.  It rocks.   On a seperate note... I love it when I'm browsing other people's blogs and I come across someone my age with a similar intelect. Example: Elm...Who's favorite books include such classics as The Davinci Code, Catcher in the Rye, and To Kill A Mockingbird. Folks, these are all high-school level books (And they're good, too)! I wish that I could organize a gathering of people like this...Just a huge get-together where we'd all chat. That would rock. That would rock like Keasby Nights.  We'll be heading to the airport in a couple hours to pick up my gramma. On August 10th we leave for Washington, D.C., home of "President" George W. Bush *CoughCough*  Hang loose, Rock on, Love plenty, Peace out.

       What the  fuck  ... I just got the wierdest response to my "Handbook to Journaling: Lesson I Part I" They wrote... "dude i am an indiviaual and i do not pick on people only YOU because you are so gay and pick on ppl because you are jelous that they have friends and you dont..... what was that huh? thats what i thought.. " What the Hell???  A) Learn to type. That was a major run-on-sentence, and your capitalization was...well,...What capitalization?  B) I have no idea on what grounds you base your accusation of my sexual alignment. I have never done anything that might lead someone to believe I might be gay. I do not dress, act, or think in a gay manner. Hell, even if I  was  gay, what would be the big deal? 1 out of every 10 people are gay. That means that two people in last year's class will grow up to be gay. Could be you, you close-minded pregedist male chuavist bastard!  C) If this blog the "picking on people" that you spoke of in your comment, I feel you must reed more carefully. This is not picking on people, though some may find it offensive. Sorry. On this blog I am simply trying to express my opinion in the way that makes most sense to me. Although you may interpret it differently, that is not the interpretation that I intended.  D) I have friends. Unfortunately some of my closest friends don't go to this school. (Dan Kleinman and Cristian LaCourse).  E) Posting as "Anonymous" is a wimpy way to do things. It's like you're hiding your name so that you won't get in trouble. What are you afraid I'm going to do, tell a teacher? You don't even have to do it on my site! just send me an email or IM ( urlLink drgncharmer@comcast.net  or BADbadger18)!  What was that, huh?  Eagerly awaiting more of your comments (They're so much fun to critique), The Reactor
