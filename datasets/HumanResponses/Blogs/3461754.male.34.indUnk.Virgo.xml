       urlLink ChristianExodus.org    It is evident that our Constitution has been abandoned under our current federal system.  The efforts of Christian activism have proven futile over the past five decades and, whereas desperate times require desperate measures, we are now in the most desperate of times.   Ya know, maybe if they would quit putting into office those who campaign like Libertarians and govern like Democrats things may not be as they are now. For years and years we were told that Democrats wanted to turn our country into a socialist utopia and we had to put a Republican in office so they couldn't take over. Maybe Republicans now will see that there really is no difference between either party. One part wants to drive us over the cliff at 100mph, the other wants to do it at 55mph. Either way, you going over the cliff.  Also, why this pulling God's people out of a society that needs them so badly? If we are the salt of the earth, a city set on a hill...why would we want to hide ourselves? I think this is just part of the escapist mentality that has caused Christians to pull out of the public arena and expect the world to get worse and worse so the Lord can come and put an end to it all.   Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.

      Okay, here is my attempt at a blog. What is my goal with this? I have no idea. Maybe I will one day have a 1000 links to my little place here, or  maybe I will just be a bit on road kill on the information superhighway.    A bit about myself.    My name is Robert and I live in the Kern River Valley which is in the mountains about 45 miles north east of Bakersfield, CA.  I am 34 years old and I have already been married and divorced. I have no children.  For years I worked as a correctional sergeant in a private correctional facility which was contracted out by the state of California to house their inmates. When Grey Davis was first running for Governor of this state, the CCPOA (California Correctional Peace Officer's Assoc) gave him a mighty nice campaign contribution in the tune of millions. The catch was, Davis had to hold the line that the state could not afford private prisons. The truth be told is that its costs the state 30,000+ a year per inmate to hose them in their facility, and it only cost the sate 13,000 a year per inmate to hose them with us. Yes, there is a reason why the CCPOA union wanted us out of work, it was because we were efficient and created jobs for the community. Well, Grey is now out of office because the voters in the state did the math and it didn't add up, but Davis got his money and the CCPOA got what they paid for.  Now, I am employed as a EMT for a local hospital. I work in the Emergency Room as an ER Tech, which means I assist the doctors and nurses and do most of the paper work and make all the calls that need to be made all the while keeping patients and visitors and staff happy. Its a great job, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I was upset when I got laid off from corrections, but now I am happier than I have ever been in my life when it comes to enjoying my job.  Now, I am a Christian, and a eastern Orthodox Christian at that. But here is the problem, there is no Orthodox Church where I live.   Most of what will be posted on this blog will deal with my faith, so this is a theological blog more or less. But really, this blog is a meeting place for friends that I have all over the place to check in a see what is currently on the menu in my life.  Also, some things I will be posting on here will be political (great politics and religion) and I am a libertarian, so hang on.  All in all let me say welcome, and if I post anything that you would care to comment on, please by all means do so.  Until next time.
