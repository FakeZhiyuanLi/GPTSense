        Quiet    &nbsp;    Osho.    I like Osho a lot.  Pure, True and Holy . This morning I asked Him what to do with this pure and strong hate and anger I feel inside. It's like I had a perhaps little messy but at least clean house and now all of a sudden I see dirt and rubbish everywhere..  &nbsp;    Listen.    The answer is never clear. The purpose is to hear it and then find out its meaning for me. This is already listening to myself&nbsp;- it makes me able to find my way by myself. With all this  noise  in my head, I will never be able to listen inside..  &nbsp;    Shut up.    For a while it is better not to open my mouth. Let go. I need to relax and feel numb. I have to feel how is it to take everything that&nbsp;enters my receptors (let it be good or bad), and instead of sending a lightspeed fast message to my brain, just  ignore  the perception..  &nbsp;    Meditation.    Actually this is exactly like when I sit down, let all my muscles relax, close my eyes and get into my Inner World. This is full-time, awake meditation. This means that instead of  me entering  my Inner World, I  extend  my Inner World to my whole being..  &nbsp;  I am fighting to achieve this Awake Meditation.

        Lesson    &nbsp;  This is one of the hardest lessons to learn. It sounds very simple, but very very hard to follow and fully understand. This is one of those that you have to experience on your own skin.&nbsp;Others you just discover and they are easy to apply from the next available situation. This one is about something that comes from  you . Your lack of self-controll will create the inner "situation" and the only one who can do something about it is you. Not as easy as it sounds..  &nbsp;    The Bug.    I am happy for my experiences. But I still have a little Bug in my system that constantly has the need for sharing. I know that my perceptions are getting stronger and stronger since that night on the Island. I even had them before but never wanted to find out how and why they work. But they do work. And they tell me the Truth. Even if I don't want them to.  &nbsp;  This little bug made me think that if I share my thoughts, especially when they are built on True experiences,&nbsp; it will make me happier. I tried several times to resist, and I have to say that the little bug was wrong. I felt happier with myself. I felt happier keeping my thoughts inside and chewing them, discussing them with myself&nbsp;while I was waiting for a green light at a zebra crossing, or in a queue at the post office.&nbsp;     Love.    I think I only find it hard to resist when it is about someone who means much for me. People I love. With them I get more passionate, and like a mother, I want to save time&nbsp;and energy&nbsp;for them by telling the Truth. But it doesn't work like this. No-one can take the pleasure of experience from anyone.  &nbsp;  And if I put it this way (this is the first time I managed to put it this way), I think I understand more.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am fighting with my bug for&nbsp;respecting everyone's pleasure&nbsp;in experience.

         Fighters         &nbsp;    Instinct.    I think the main thing that makes the difference between human and animal.  My father is too instinctive. Far too instinctive. He has always been like this. A Natural Born Animal. But there is an evil mixture in his blood. An essence that makes him able to lie and fool anyone who stands infornt of him. He fights to keep himself for himself only..  &nbsp;    Sixth sense.    Women have it. No doubt. For years I thought my mother was notoriously jealous. My childish mind was only able to see that she is ruining the peace of our family. Now she is the one who's ruined. Completely. Her life is in constant danger, her nerves are wrecked, her goods what she earned with sweat and blood&nbsp;are in danger if she&nbsp;makes a step for her own safety. She had a rough childhood. My father was the only person since 30 years she trusted. It was an illusion. Both for her and for me. Now she's fighting&nbsp;to survive..  &nbsp;    Sorrow, anger, empathy.    I have them all. In the same time. I feel sorrow&nbsp;because I can only watch my roots rotting alive.  I feel anger for all the disgusting things I had to find out about my father. I have nightmares because I can not identify him anymore. He disappeared in an ugly mist.  I feel empathy&nbsp;for both. When I go to bed and all my senses open, no input, only my thoughts are shouting in me, I become my mother. I feel his fingers around my throat, I feel the frustraiton of lack of air. Then I become my father's lonely self all&nbsp;along his life, and his&nbsp;lost soul after it leaves his body. I feel so much pitty for all the pain that soul is going to go through.  Now I'm fighting for equilibrium.. here.. inside.

        The use    &nbsp;  Confessions, painful memories, self-checks started to grow around me everywhere.. I had a thought about it and finally found it rather useful than fashionable..   Let's see what use it can be for me..     Hypnotic regression.    I am 4 years old..   my mother is throwing a shoe at me.. I pause the picture.. I make a wish.. I wish she aimed well.. picture rolls along.. she missed..  At night when everything is quiet, I feel encouraging hands on my body.. but when I open my eyes I can't see anyone.. I can't see but I can feel very well.. I am not scared..     I am 12 years old..   as every year my father takes me to the mountains.. something changed.. instead of asking questions with enthusiasm and hanging on every word he sais, I start doubting.. he doesn't understand me anymore, I don't understand him anymore.. my own world opens.. I start to build Her deep inside..     I am 16 years old..   I only see the living ghost of my father.. I see my mother every day shouting around me and telling me I will not go anywhere in life if I keep on going out with my schoolmates after school.. I continue taking my usual place of the Weak and Young Daughter, but I also contimue defeating them in my own World of Graphics..     I am 18 years old..   My wish comes true.. breaks my physics.. I could have lived my life with the idea of being physically perfect.. But after now, this opportunity is gone.. I burry my sorrow, but deep inside I blame and blame, and most importantly feel so sorry for myself..  I meet my first Master.. the Master who took the energy to drive a lost soul in the normal circulation.. I resist a lot.. I cry a lot.. I lie a lot.. first of all to myself.. I think tears will make him pity me and stop him teaching and judging all the time.. but he was a taugh one.. thank God..     I am 22 years old..   I changed a lot.. but not enough.. I am yet just Normal.. I leave my Master for all the pain he caused me.. Meant to be..  Red hot summer.. naughty spices.. all alone.. I close my eyes and I feel I am being watched.. "Who are you?" - I ask in the palace of my mind.. "I am you." - She sais.. "Why are you here now?" - I ask with anger as I start to doubt my own sanity.. "I have always been here, but you were so afraid of me that you never even wanted to notice that I am around.".. She sounds so strong, so sincere that I become courios.. "I know you very well, I have been observing you. But do YOU know me?" - She asks.. She's right, I can't deny it. I don't know Her, indeed.. I start a conversation with Her and She tells me about Herself.. She tells me what She likes, what She doesn't like.. what She is, what She is definiately not.. She answers the same things I would answer to my own questions, but every time I ask "Why?", She is honest.. She is honest to me!.. not like I would be to a person infront of me asking the same question.. She shows me what a liar I am..  By the end of the conversation she makes it clear to me that all these years I have been trying to be someone else.. instead of facing my faults, I always lied something on my advantage proudly.. like it would be me.. and I believed I was.. sounds disgusting..     Wide awake.    She worn me out.. I fell in deep sleep..  The day after I could have said "Too much spice.. never again.".. But I didn't.. It was a real awakening from a long-long sleep..&nbsp;Her voice echoed within my skull.. I felt happy.. I felt happy with my new companion.. I knew myself - never alone.. when I had some spare time I always managed to find company in one of the people I know.. Now I had Her.. I was walking around on the Island happily.. would say completely alone.. but I didn't at all feel alone anymore..  Slowly (however later I learned how quick it really was) I accepted Her teachings.. I implanted Her in me.. I became..   ME  .
