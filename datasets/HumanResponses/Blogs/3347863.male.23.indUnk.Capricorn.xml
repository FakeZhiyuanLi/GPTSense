      That's Right, my site Http://www.geocties.com/twisted_balloons/  will be updated soon and the new improved version should be on-lined by tuesday or wensday at the latest. preferablly tonight, but realistically, it will be up tommorow night, as it will take me time and I have to be off-line during the day due to phone constrants.  When it is updated let me know what you think of the new look, go ahead and check it out now and let me know what you think of the current, very basic look as well.  TwistBs Signing off for another night.

      As I write this, It is the end of a very long day. Toady, Saturday, May 15th is the first blog posting I have ever done, some of you who read this will go, big deal it's just TwistBs or TwistTim or however you know me posting, others will say, why did he not write sooner?  The answer is late last night I finally found out how great this service truly is. I had heard about it before but didn't think it would be any good.  How did I hear about this? Lockergnome.com's Windows Digest, I have been a subscriber from earlier on...96 I think was my first issuse, I left readership for a while, but came back, I had to leave it to focus on school, I came back because I reliazed all the tools I could find in there, amongst the stuff that didn't fit me was useful. even what didn't fit me could have a benefit to someone else.  I will conclude this post with two of my favoriate quotes.  One : "Never give in, Never, Never, Never, Never,- in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense" - Wintson Churchill Two : "Do not medle in the affairs of dragons, for that are crunchy and taste good with Ketchup." - Unknown. Check out my site sometime, Http://www.geocities.com/twisted_balloons. also if you use StumbleUpon(Http://www.stumbleupon.com) look for me - Twistbs.
