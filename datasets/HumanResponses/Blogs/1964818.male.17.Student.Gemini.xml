      Damn, I just haven't had the time to come here the past few day, with so much going on.  Well, for some reason I cant seem to remember what I was doing on Monday, but I am pretty  sure I was busy...  But, anyways,  yesterday I went over to Mike's with Luke and that was the first time I had seen him since we got out of school.  By that point I was starting to wonder if he even existed and I didn't make him up...  Luke was feeling nice I guess because when we went out to the mall he bought me a meal, as kind of a birthday present.  Later that night I got the Spiderman 2 game, and holy crap is it great.  I love it, it's so much better than the first one and I don't suck at it.  I also finally got my new memory card, so all my storage problems are over.  So I guess that's it.  later...

      I finally reformatted this computer, and I'm really glad I did.  Now I think that its working much better, and I've also gotten rid of a lot of clutter and stuff that should be there.  Now I just have the task of putting everything back in...  I had my second driving lesson today.  I'm glad I got a different guy because I couldn't hardly understand the first one because of his accent.  I did some things that I haven't done before, and I didn't really make any horribly bad mistakes.  later...

      It's almost gone.  My parents and my mom's brothers and sisters finally finished cleaning up their fathers house and its time to sell it.  I'm going to be glad when its all finally over, but I cant begin to imaging how happy my mom is going to be when its done.  She is the executor of the estate, so she's been the one that has been doing almost everything, and also my dad did a lot of stuff.  I think each of them did more work than all 5 of her brothers and sisters put together.  Now we know that the house will be sold for at least $400,000.  Drool...  I'm crossing my fingers that some money will come my way for something like  kick ass computer.  But I can only hope...  Speaking of computers, I am really getting sick of this one.  I've decided to back up all my stuff and reformat the whole thing and start over.  I'll probably do it on Monday, but I'm burning disks tonight.  I'm sure that I will be happy with the results after I do that.  later...

      It's is amazing how stupid I can be.  It seems that every time I drive I do something extremely stupid, and almost get in an accident.  Just a few minutes ago I did one of the dumbest things.  At a stop sign I look, see a car coming and just I start going. My parents started yelling and I stopped.  If I kept going I'd be screwed right now.  I must have thought the other Things like this keep happening and its making me question whether or not I should continue driving.  But, what I need to do is just go on and learn from my mistakes, because I am sure that I am learning from them.  But enough of that crap...  I ended up seeing Dodgeball today, and it was really good.  I though I wasn't going to though, but after a lot of stuff happening I did.  First I thought Mike wasn't going because he didn't wanna spend the money, but then I get on this morning and he says he's going.  So when Luke came online Mike asked him if he was going but he just said he couldn't go and logged off real fast...  I don't know what going on with him right now, because he started acting really strange last night, and then the weird responses this morning...  Well, Mike was going to the movie anyway so I decided I would go cuz I didn't know what's going on with Luke.  If he's pissed that we went it's not my problem.  After the movie I just went back to Mike's and we played Soul caliber for a really long time.  I mostly got my but kicked...  And now that brings me back to now, so I'm done.  later...

      I've got some relatives staying at my house right now, but that is definitely not a bad thing.  These relatives are my favorites.  Our two families get along so well, and we seem to like the same things.  So, they're gonna be here a few days, and were going to go out to eat on Friday all together with even more family.  It's always fun when we get together and go out together, so I'm looking forward to that.  I'm crossing my fingers that I will be seeing Dodgeball tomorrow.  This will be like the first movie like that that I have seen in a very long time.  My parents don't like that kind of movie, and I always go to the movies with them, so I never see half the movies I want to.  But this time I have other people to go with, and if Mike can get some money ill finally get to see the movie.  later...

      My book finally came!  I've been waiting since Friday for it to come, even though it did on Friday.  Well, what happened was I ordered a few books off of Amazon and I got them on Friday.  So I was all excited and everything, and I start reading the main one that I wanted.  Then al of the sudden I finish reading a page and look to the next and see that it isn't the book I've been reading.  In the middle of my book, for 30 pages, it is a completely different book.  So, I went on the site and got everything fixed, and I finally have a correct copy of my book and I just want to read it.  later...

      You meet some strange people chatting online.  I have had many very odd conversations while in the chatroom for gta-sanandreas.com.  Like today for instance.  We spent a lot of time talking about $hit pies.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh agian.  I wouldn't let anyone eat any, i kept taking them and eating them first.  Yea... i don't know how it got started, but it was kinda funny.  It's nice to talk to people who are just as crazy as me, so i know i'm not alone.

      OK, I've decided to try this whole blog thing again.  This time I will try not to get sucked into revolving everything around my sick twisted obsession for a damn girl.  I need to move past that and just write about my whole life, no matter how boring and pointless.  Lets see what happens...

      I've just started watching a show called Naruto, and I really love it.  It was quite a quite ago when Luke first showed it to me at his house, and now in the past few days I decided to download some episodes and check it out.  And I am very glad that I did.  The show is just very interesting and some of the things they do are unbelievably cool, and others are absolutely hilarious.  Thanks to my blazing fast internet or I wouldn't be able to even watch this show, and thanks to Luke for showing me the light.  A couple more reality shows started last night that I am going to  have  to watch now.  And before now I already had two shows that I've been watching on that night.  The Amazing Race is a pretty interesting show and I watched it last year.  But at the end of the  race, after watching the whole thing from the start, something goes wrong and my DVR doesn't record the last show, so I never did find out who won...  Just a few day before I go on vacation...  I think it will be fun... I hope...  later...

      Still nothing really going on...  In about a week I'm leaving on vacation.  Still playing Spiderman, although I'm not playing nearly as much since there is less to do in the game.  Only things to do are look for tokens, do the insanely hard challenges and do the random crimes.  I just wanna get Tales of Symphonia right now...  I saw the Spiderman movie on Saturday, and it was really good.  There was enough difference from the game so that I didn't know everything that was going to happen.  Now I cant wait for the third one.  later...

      I'm still addicted to the Spiderman game.  I can't stop playing it.  I've beaten the main story, but there is still so much for me to do, and a lot I'm thinking I will never be able to do, because there are some objectives that are just too hard and I simply don't have good enough skills.  But still, no matter what, I love this game and I want to try it all.  Now that I have beaten it though, I know exactly what's going to happen in the movie, but it doesn't really matter though, since none of it surprised me.  Now I know all the things that happen are what I wanted, I'm glad that it will turn out the way it does.  Now I still have two weeks to wait until I can get Tales of Symphonia, since I will be in LA the day it comes out and wont be back until the end of the week.  I want that so bad, I can't wait to gee it...  later...
