      "Hi, Mom."  "Hi, honey.  What's wrong?  You don't usually call this late."  Catrina looked over at the clock - 10:41pm.  Her mother was probably in bed by now, but not asleep.    "No, nothing's wrong, I just need something."  Catrina rushed through her words, not wanting to waste any time.  "I left my address book at the house the other day, and I need a number out of it."  "Sure, hon'.  I picked it up the other day as I was cleaning, I put it in my purse so I could give it to you the next time I saw you."  Catrina's mother drowsily spoke these words.  At the same moment, Catrina opened up the underwear drawer of her brureau, looking for just the right pair of panties.  Looking at the clock once more, she decided that time was at a premium, and skipped the undergarments completely.    "Mom, the number I need is under Johnson.  Chris Johnson."  Catrina couldn't help but let a mischevious grin pass her lips.  Pulling a short black skirt over her hips, she could already feel a dull throb between her legs.    "I'm just finding my glasses...  Jacob, Jeffries, ah, Johnson.  It was Chris, you said?"  Catrina began to curse herself for ever letting her address book out of sight.    " Yes , mother."    "It's 839-2755."  Catrina could hear her mother take in a long, deep breath, as if she was about to say something.  "Thanks Mom, got to go, sorry."  Catrina hung up the phone, with only the slightest amount of guilt and finished dressing herself.   She decided on a light, almost sheer, button down shirt.  Her erect nipples, without the trappings of a bra, showed through the shirt, two dark points leading the eye to her rounded, voluptuous breasts.  After pulling on strappy sandals, with a slight heel, she grabbed her bag and headed down the staircase and out the door.     ***************************************************************   Sitting in the dark cab, Catrina began dialing the number her mother had given her.  She could see that the cab driver was looking at her lasciviously.  She met his eyes in the rearview window, and uncrossed her legs, teasing the driver with bare skin, and a few light, curly hairs protuding from the darkness.    "Maybe you should watch the road."  Catrina said, with a smile.  The driver obeyed.  A voice on the other line answered.  "Hello?"  "Chris, it's Catrina."  Catrina said with a warmth in her voice.    "Hey, Catrina!  It's so great to hear from you, babe.  What's up?"  Chris had a smoothness to his otherwise masculine voice.  Catrina noticed goose bumps on her arms.    "I need to see you."  Catrina felt like she was the top of a roller coaster, full of anticipation and determination.  "I need to see you, now."    She could hear Chris quietly laughing on the other end of the line.  She could also hear other voices.  She feared rejection, but was confident that she would get what she needed tonight.  "How does 10 minutes sound?" said Chris.  She knew that she held a special position in Chris' agenda.  She knew she had power.  Control.  "I'm on my way."    ***************************************************************   As the cab pulled away from the large condominium complex, Catrina hesitated momentarily.  This was not the first time she had been here, but it was the first time she had been here for selfish reasons.    She remembered her first time in the elevator, with Dex, making their way up to the penthouse. Chris' penthouse.  Chris was a successful architect by day.  He, in fact, designed the condo he was currently living in.  By night, however, Chris was a master of ceremonies, of sorts.  Chris held monthly parties for the young, the open minded, and, well, the horny.  Chris was Bacchus reincarnate.  These parties, which were of course through invitation only, featured the finest wines and most delectable food.    Then there was the sex.  The parties were not orgies.  Chris felt that orgies were too primal; too  bourgeoisie .  Instead, he provided comfortable, private (or semi-private) spaces for those interested in intimate companionship.  Some were there to make love with their wives or husbands. Some were there to fuck a stranger.  Some were there to fondle themselves as part of an audience; or for an audience.    Dex and Catrina knew what they getting themselves into.  At least, they thought they did.  Dex had met Chris through a shared acquaintance.  After several meetings, Chris invited Dex to one of his gatherings.    Dex mentioned this to Catrina.  She struggled to contain her enthusiasm.  Dex and Catrina had been dating for over 2 years, off and on, and she was excited to try something new.  Though she and Dex had a very active sex life, she felt they had both fallen into a routine.    So, wearing their most revealing and tight clothing, they set off for the penthouse.  The elevator doors opened, revealing a somewhat subdued gathering of Chris' guests.  A few people, both men and women, were standing about drinking wine, smoking cigars, or sampling the various platters food.  A few more people were lounging on couches and chairs.  Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" could be faintly heard weaving throughout the large, open penthouse.    "Dex!  Hey! Welcome!".  Chris came bouncing over to where they were standing.  His white, though slightly crooked teeth shone in the dim lighting.  He was, Catrina noted immediately, tall, dark, and handsome.  Like her, he had large, deep brown eyes.  His lips were full, with just a hint of facial hair on his chin.  Catrina was attracted to him immediately.

      He began to make his way out of the room as he finished buttoning up his shirt, but had to stop when he reached Catrina.  He slid his hands inside the sheet and pulled her close to him, spreading his fingers out along the small of her back.  Catrina tried to remain cool, but she felt him harden against her, and she could barely help herself.  Dex raised one hand to the side of her face, grazing her breast on the way by.  He kissed her fully on the mouth.  As Catrina returned his advance readily, circling her arms around his waist, her sheet dropped to the floor.    Dex pulled away abruptly, loosening his hold on Catrina.    "I have to go.  You have no idea how sorry I am, Cat."  Catrina winced.  She had never been particularly fond of that version of her name.  She let her arms fall away from Dex, and said very quietly, "You have to do what you have to do," in an effort to leave it open, so that he might understand that she herself was something that he very much needed to deal with.  Dex smiled and traced his finger along her cheek and down to her collarbone.  He gave an apologetic smile, before turning and walking out the door.  Catrina stared after him, mouth agape.  She had thrown herself at Dex, and now stood alone, naked, and getting increasingly annoyed, in her bedroom.  Sitting down on the bed, Catrina sighed.  As her anger faded into a feeling of should-have-known-better, her arousal, surprisingly, would not subside.  Considering her options, Catrina reached into her bedside table for her box of goodies.  Rummaging through them, she paused to think.  This was supposed to be an exciting night, passionate, not her alone with some double a's.  Before the disappointment could settle in again, she came up with a brilliant idea.  A smile slowly spread across her face.  She would not let this night be a waste, and she knew just who to call.

       Bzzzz.   Silence.   Bzzzzz.   "Oh, damnit," said Dex as he leaned over the bed, looking for his cell phone which was the cause of the mood-ruining buzzing.    A few feet from the bed still stood Catrina.  Once a vision of sensual beauty, Catrina now looked dejected, even annoyed. She pulled the sheet around her shoulders.  She was cold now, but not as cold as the icy stare she was now projecting at Dex.  Dex slid out from under the covers, still listening intently to whoever was on the end of the line, his brow furrowed.  He stood up, his rippling muscles backlit from the moon.  He began searching for his clothes.  Catrina poured herself a glass of wine.  There were two glasses on the bedside table, but she knew that tonight only one of them would be put to use.  "I will be there as soon as I can."  Dex ended the conversation, and slid the cell phone around the waistband of his jeans.  Catrina hated the look of cell phones on waistbands, and she was just about to say so, when. . .  "I've got to go."  Dex looked at Catrina with disappointed eyes.  The rest of his features, though, were strong and determined.

      She paused, briefly unsure of her decision, but then remembered her earlier bravado and climbed the last few stairs.  Dex remained in his position on the bed, lying on his back, propped up on one elbow, watching her approach.  Although he made no move toward her, Catrina could see that he was as relieved to see her as she was excited to see him.  She tried to read his face, but could not see anything in it beyond his easy smile and ridiculously beautiful brown eyes.  She covered the distance between them slowly, wanting to savour every moment of their encounter.  The bedroom window was open, and the cool night air caressed her body as she walked.  She felt her skin prickle as her nipples tightened into firm rosebuds.  Her entire body quivered with excitement, and she had to make a concerted effort to stop herself from sprinting the last few feet and throwing herself onto the gorgeous man in her bed.

      As Catrina mounted the grand staircase, the sheet fell from her ivory shoulders. Dex was waiting for her.

      Ok folks, welcome aboard, enjoy your stay.&nbsp; A very few guidelines before we get started: &nbsp; 1) Do your best to use proper punctuation, spelling etc.&nbsp; It's a bit distracting reading erotica if you can't really understand what's going on. &nbsp; 2)&nbsp;Do your best to follow the narrative of the&nbsp;person who posted before you;&nbsp;the idea here is to create a story.&nbsp; Naturally there can be twists and turns, and new characters, but let's try to give it a kind of flow. &nbsp; 3)&nbsp;Use your imaginations, and have fun! At least for now, I've taken the 'posted by' tag off, so you can all post without fear of anyone finding out how truly dirty you are.  ;)
