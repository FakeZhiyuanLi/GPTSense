      Readings: Job 38:1-11, 42:1-5/ Rev. 19:4-16/ John 1:29-34  This is no way a complete or finished reflection. But to do nothing is to not engage the text. Engaging the text begins the process of starting to understand.  With the above readings there is no mistaking God is involved! He is all over the page. This is not the quiet God in the whisper or the burning bush to Moses, or even gentle doves. On this particular Sunday we get power and might. God takes the gloves off to remind the direction of servanthood lest we forget and start beliving that God is in our pocket. These readings very effectively remind us that we are most certainly are in his pocket and that our compassionate God's mercy is not neccesarily sit back and take as a given.  In Job he trounces Job for daring to pigeonhole God. God reacts and with vengence. While humans might get a bit squeemish with Jobs plight here, God does not seems to take note or even lower himself to human ethical concerns. For some reason the line that stands out so forcefully is "Have you ever in your lifetime commanded the morning?" This is included in a whole litany of things beyond Jobs control and however much we humans want God to come and comfort Job He does not. God here very forcefully reminds even his most faithful Job  that there are things in His Dominion that Job can not even begin to fathom. In chapter 42 we get that turnabout face of Job where he submits into to dust and ashes. Even in Job's perdicament and percieved moral highground, he retreats into servitude reminded and reminding us that for as stong or powerful or just we may become we are still simply the dust and ashe of One whom Created us.  Revelation also points to servanthood. Even the angel falls back to remind the writer of the vision that all of us are brothers serving Jesus Christ. What stikes me here is there is no doubt of Jesus' Divinity here. Riding a white horse his kingship "Faithful and True" he sets out his "name was called the Word of God." While the vision is confusing and may point to a time of tribulation I think what is most encouraging is that the battle is already won. The use of Word of God in conjunction of judgement and power reflects again the power of God of Genesis. Out of his mouth the world was created. Out of his mouth the world is recreated. While disturbing at times the world as reflected in Revelation is at the feet of God as Job is. Job repents.  In the Gospel the divinity and Power of God is less flamboyant then the demonstrations of God's power in Job and Revelation. Yet one is supposed to make the jump that this Jesus as Baptised by John at the River Jordan is the same power who guides mornings and rides white horses. The baptizer reveals that his whole purpose was in encountering this One upon whom the spirit descends. "I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing with water was that he may he might be known to Israel...Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God." What is so interesting here is that a whole community of Jews have left the cities and towns to come and hear John. The baptizer has created a community of repentance, a community of those who are surrending to God. So there amidst a worshiping community God reveals himself. He reveals Him self not in their glory but in their seeking Him in their weakness.  Repentance preceeded worship. Worship revealed God's greatness.  In forming a sermon I would focus on servanthood. With Easter can come the security that God is with us and that is certainly true. I think however that Christians and myself included can become complacement based on the ego that all is well due to such salvation. What the Trinity Sunday readings stress is that Kingship and Divinity outweigh all that I think and encourage me into turning towards the God I can not comprehend and surrender myself to Him.   I think I would also stess that surrender is not an individual duty but that servanthood takes place in community. The Baptizer is surrounded by those seeking repentance. It is a community. In Revelation the writer is encouraged to recognize that all our servants even the speaker who appears to be angelic. Brotherhood only comes in relation to others. Brotherhood requires siblings.   The last ideas that is swirling around as I write this is that the Gospel has God recognized not to those of the world but to those who are seeking to repent. The powers of the Roman Empire, Eygpt, Mesopotamia, ... the capital markets, Viacom, GE, The United States, England, etc, etc can not see. Not because they are evil or of no value. They are. Our Creator created good. What blinds them and can so easily blind me is that the world believes its own press that they are actually in control. If you believe you are in control then your job is to build yourself up. If it is by your will then one must protect your position. There can be no room for repentance if one is in control.  Trinity Sunday reminds me that I am not running the show. It reminds me to seek God out in a community that also recognizes it's dependance. Only then does the Creator reveal himself.
