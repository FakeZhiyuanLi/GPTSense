      I just realized this is my 11th post.  Break out the fucking champagne.  I now have archives.  This was the first CD I ever bought.  Before this, I was just content to listen to the radio.  No longer.  With this CD, I started a collection that will be treasured and eventually either passed down to my children or sold on ebay when it gets expensive (either way).  Anyway, the songs I heard on the radio by Shinedown were sufficient enough to make me actually want to buy the album.  This review is of the original release, not of the excellent rerelease (I am getting that one too, if only to get my grubby little hands on "Simple Man" and to see the 45 video).    This CD rocks from the first track to the last, easy and simple.  Their most prominent feature is the incredible vocal talents of Brent Smith, their lead and only singer -- any vocal effects on this album, the harmonies, the backup singing, any of that, is done by him.  They also have a relatively good guitarist, bassist, and drummer, but their main thing going for them is Brent Smith.  Now, onto the song-by-song:  1) Fly from the Inside Solid stuff.  This was their first hit, and for good reason!  This is easily one of my favorite songs by them.  Good, unique intro, awesome singing and lyrics, great harmony on the prechorus between the lyrics and general singing, good screaming bridge, and awesome bass and drums.    2) Left Out A much, much darker song, but still excellent.  Good guitaring, alright lyrics and vocals, and bass and drums that blend seamlessly in make this song of revenge and abuse an excellent addition to the album.    3) Lost in the Crowd This song illustrates the lyric-writing talent of Brent Smith.  He manages to take an otherwise average song and give it incredible new life.  This one got more than a few repeats by me before I actually comprehended the lyrics.    4) No More Love I'm still not sure why this one didn't make a hit.  Awesome guitaring, great singing and lyrics, and a good, faster-paced tempo make this one indispensable.  5) Better Version I absolutely love this song.  It speaks complete truth, that no one is perfect and people should just accept each other for what they are.  Great lyrics, vocals, guitaring, and bass, and some incredible harmony near the end.    6) Burning Bright A slower song, this band manages to pull it off really well.  Great lyrics as usual (that must be getting really repetitive, but it's completely true), pretty good instrument sounds, everything you need for a good song.  And with a new version of this song coming with the rerelease, even better.    7) In Memory Most bands crap out at about this point in the album, but Shinedown's still kicking.  Great intro (I don't know how they did that), a different feel, and incredible lyrics make this my favorite song on the album.  That is, until I get the rerelease and I get my fingers around "Simple Man"...  8) All I ever Wanted An easy second (or third) to "In Memory", this one has a softer feel right up until the chorus, where it unleashes some of the most kickass lyrics ever.  Second to "In Memory" and "Simple Man", that is.    9) Stranger Inside Meh.  Not a very memorable song.  Average lyrics, guitar, bass, and drums.    10) Lacerated Wha happen?  We went from 60 to 3 in 10 seconds, because we hit a proverbial brick wall with this song.  This would be average if it weren't THIS band.  Shitty lyrics, unnoticeable instrumentation.  The only saving grace of this song is that you can skip it if you're using a CD player.  The curse of the shitty song on the awesome rock album strikes again.  11) Crying Out There we go, temporary insanity's over and we're back on track, pumping out hits.  Great intro, kickass everything, and a bridge that startled the hell outta me with just how random it was (but it fit so perfectly!) A great second to last song.  12) 45 And we're here, standing on the edge with this song about suicide.  It's not bad, but these songs are not my favorites.  They're way too disturbing.    This CD is a normal length (47 minutes), so that's not an issue, but there's more to it than that.  Now, mind you, this is only the normal version.  With the rerelease (which came out July 15), you get all this, their "Simple Man" cover (Skynyrd song - bass - drums + Brent Smith = best cover ever), a different version of "Burning Bright", the acoustic 45, and the 45 video, along with the normal CD and the "Fly from the Inside" video.  What else could you ask for? Go forth, my children, and buy this.  Now.  Right now.     Report Card  + Awesome lyrics + Great instrumentation + Variety like all hell + Simple. Man. What else do you need? + Just get the fucking thing already!  Grade: A.  A big, solid A.  Nothin' but.  If this band doesn't survive long enough to put out at least 2 other albums, someone's going to die.

      I don't really have a unified topic I really want to talk about, so I'll go through the strange things I noticed during the day.  First, while I was at work, we got a phone call.  This was the first of 3 total phone calls by this person, each about 30 minutes long, that we got during my shift, out of which I got the honor of taking all 3 calls, due to my closer proximity to the phone.  This lady was definitely a senior citizen, definitely an immigrant from India, and definitely unwilling to have things any way but her own.  I work at a golf shop on a walking course -- and by walking, I mean not only no carts available for golfers, but no carts allowed to any but employees of the shop or the camp held on the same course.  She didn't like this idea, insisting that she be allowed to use one because she was partially disabled (she had a metal hip).  Every time she called, she asked the same questions, and it got to the point where it asked me if I was angry (I was pretty frustrated, explaining everything for the 3rd and sometimes 4th time) and then accused me of making fun of her because of her age, even though I was just trying to not scream at her.  I finally made her understand, but it took around 2 hours of my life.  What a waste.    While I'm working, we had the radio on (the main 3 ways of passing time are listening to music, watching crappy daytime TV, and comandeering the carts reserved for maintenance -- especially that one without a governor! Yeah joyriding!) and I noticed something.  I was listening to the stupid commercials, most of which I heard for the 6th time that hour, and while I was listening to a Navy commercial I heard a very familiar tune in the background.  Not until I heard the distinctive drumbeat did I realize that it was none other than the intro to "Awake", one of Godsmack's most popular songs!  What a strange song to use for a Navy commercial...or, for that matter, for a commercial, period.  After work, I went to a Borders close to the shop because I had a fair amount of time in between when I finish work and when I got picked up.  There, I found one of the greatest bargains for a full-length, pretty old but still totally awesome CD.  I got Alice in Chains' awesome self-titled CD for an incredible $12 -- actually the normal price of a buck a song.  Now, that doesn't seem like that incredible a deal, but when you consider that I paid $21 for Godsmack's self-titled, unedited version (I hate edited music. It takes that important part of the song out) and that it is the longest CD I own (clocking in at 64:15), that seems like the fucking Louisiana purchase, considering how many people consider AIC as some of the founders of the modern metal movement.  Whatever inspired the pricing comittee at Borders to lower that one, it was founded in none other than the Savior, Jesus the Christ.  Nothing short of that could have inspired them to do such a noble thing.  There is some hope for humanity after all...  No, I lied.  There's no hope.  But I got a cheap CD, and that kicks ass.  That'll do for today.

      I was listening to one of my usual radio talk show programs on the way home from work in the shittiest summer job ever (that is an exagguration, my apologies to all of you in my grade working at coffee shops doing everything from serving to being entertainment...you I feel sorry for.  At least I don't have to do jack shit to get $6 an hour) when I heard something that made my stupid detector start flipping a shit even from the 3 second preview of the story.  And it was indeed going absolutely crazy; the preview stated something about temporarily bringing back slavery to promote racial equality.  But that isn't even the worst part...  They weren't kidding about slavery...except they've switched it up a little this time.  Now black people (I'm not going to use the long, hyphenated politically correct name because political correctness is just another form of oppression) are going to walk in a parade in Annapolis, holding chained up -- you guessed it -- white people.  Now, if you can't think of something wrong with this, you're missing the point.  Just walk away from your computer -- or better yet, unplug your computer, put it back in the box, and return it, because you are far too stupid to be eligible to use a computer.  If you can, then get a load of this: it is a BRITISH group who is organizing this.  Yes, that's right -- the British, who ran rough-shod over anyone they conquered, are going to lecture us on racial equality.  I feel honored.    But the real kicker here?  This isn't just a group of crazy people involved in this.  The local government has essentially written a blank check paying for this load of crap.  A blank check paid for with our hard-earned tax dollars.  Now, I have seen 95%, solid bullshit and I have seen THIS.  The stupidest idea ever, which is most likely just going to inflame racial hatred rather than quell it,  which is run by a British corporation, is going to be funded by the government.  Someone needs to die, and quickly.  Decisions this crappy don't just happen once by a person.    This shit is pathetic.  I have nothing more to say about this giant load of stupid.  The post will end.  Here.  Now.

      Sure, I may seem like all I'm doing in this blog is whining again and again (except for the reviews).  But there are some things in the world worth mentioning that keep me going.  I'll list a few of them here, because I bet all 3 (on a good day) of you reading this are just dying to know.  I'm not at all worried about the November election, because that is a sure deal.  If Kerry keeps opening his stupid mouth and contradicting himself, he's done for.  Him and his prettyboy male prostitute of a runningmate, Edwards.  I'm not going to obsess about how we're all fucked from here to kingdom come if he gets elected, because it's not going to happen.  I'm more concerned about Hillary S. Clinton (S stands for Satan)'s campaign in 2008- you know it's coming, so don't complain about the Botox-using, personality-less dick telling us in completely uncertain terms what his stance is on every issue.  He'll campaign himself out of the running.    Punk is a dying medium.  You may not agree with me, but this is my fucking blog, so I'll say whatever the hell I want.  Punk is slowly losing ground to numetal bands, who are getting better and more numerous.  And again, I raise my imaginary tankard of mead in salute.  Rock on, numetal!  One day, the country will realize that they're being force-fed propaganda by the majority of news organizations and boycott them, evening out the political field again.  Those useless bastards will be forced to actually give news, so they will go out of business, and everyone will be on the same mental page finally.    Now, it's a good day when a christian metal band makes it as big as Demon Hunter has.  But when I realize their lyrics make fun of punk, it goes from being a good day to being an awesome day.  Get a load of these:  "So you can chant your anthems to the deaf And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left Or we can take our voices with our hands Make like knives and make demands"  Those limp-dick punk bastards never saw it coming.  Disguised in the eloquence of the first track of their second CD, this is a jibe at punk's basic 2 modes: repeat the same damn thing over and over mode, and bitch about everything mode.  Oh, what a good day it becomes when I remember this.  If any of the 3 people I mentioned in my "God hates me" article are getting me down with their problems and their, I know I could always go back to Whitman and rekindle something that could get somewhere.  Yes, if you are one of the few people who know what I'm talking about, I mean the crazy Bulgarian.  Not exactly a prize in personality or beauty (or English skills), but it was going somewhere.  That somewhere was not very good, necessarily, but still better than nothing.  If I understood her right...  Sure, downloading music for free through programs such as Kazaa has become nearly dead to many people.  But it still lives on!  Hard-to-trace websites such as negativebeats (see the link in the title of this post), positivebeats (www.positivebeats.com), and elizov, who has nearly every linkin park song in existence (www.mp3.elizov.com) keep it going strong.  Pretty soon, the bloated, corrupt music industry will capitulate to demands to reduce prices ($20 for a 3-cent CD, no matter how good or popular, is fucking crazy), and it won't be necessary to download to keep money in our wallets.    Sure, those punk bastards have it awesome now.  Living the high life, doing everything (and everyone) they can get their hands on, living life X-tremely.  However, all I have to do is wait 20 years.  Those little pricks will be completely burnt out and peniless, and I will go and laugh at them.  Oh, will I laugh.  Then I'll throw them a penny, give a last chuckle, walk away, and forget about them.  Damn, giving up shit kicks ass.  And the last thought, the one that keeps me smiling even when I hear something so stupid it makes me want to projectile vomit for several miles. Within about 40 years, everyone will finally "get it" and realize that they're full of shit.  From then on, we can go and start actually doing something that can help everyone.  Well, that's enough for today.  If all 3 of you reading this like it, I might just make a follow-up.  Maybe.

      Wow, that last post was pretty angry.  I need to calm down a little, so here is something that somewhat ties into those last 2 posts...an alternative to punk.  Yes, they're almost as commercial as most punk bands.  Yes, they're milking their success for all it's worth.  But no, I'm not contradicting myself in saying I like this band.  Why?  It all comes down to that one issue, the one that should dictate whether or not anyone should actually like certain music: they're actually talented enough to pull it off and still sound original in the process.  This is partially due to the fact that they have tapped into the forbidden fruit of the rock world.  Yes, that's right, I'm talking about...numetal.  Numetal has been trashed left and right by everyone and his mother, and I'm getting really tired of it.  I'm convinced that people just trash it because it is slowly accomplishing the noblest of duties: it is replacing punk as the "teenage" rock...  Yes, that's right.  And I, for one, raise my nonexistent tankard of mead in salute.  Take those punk bastards out!  So, back to the CD.  This CD had been long - awaited by fans complaining about them taking too damn long to record the thing.  Compared to TFSOP's recording time of one week, this one took 2 years or so to record.  And it really shows: this CD is really polished, with interludes smoothly moving song to song.  Good vocals and guitars make this decent, but what really makes this shine is the drumming, bass, keyboard, and orchestral sections.  I'll highlight some really good points in my song by song review.  1) We Still Kill the Old Way One hell of a way to start off the album.  Awesome intro, great scream harmony with the singing, overall great song.  2) To Hell We Ride A darker song, this has a really intricate guitar intro and good screaming where it needs it.  Excellent stuff.  3) Last Train Home If you haven't even heard of this song, you live under a rock.  For the rest of us, this is, some say, their best song on the album.  I disagree, but I'm putting a solid second place on it because it kicks so much ass.  Emotional singing/lyrics/keyboard, talented, well-played...the list goes on.  4) Wake Up (Make a Move) I'm not a huge fan of this song, but it has its good points, I'll tell you that.  A very small orchestral part in the second prechorus, but otherwise a pretty boring song.  It bridges the gap effectively, though.  5) Burn, Burn The skater song in the album.  I'm not a big fan of this type of song, but it's good for what it is.  For what it is.  Good guitaring, so-so vocals/lyrics, nothing much else significant.    6) I Don't Know Listen carefully on this one.  In the background is one hell of a complex drumbeat, but it fits in with the syncopated vocals and the simple guitaring.  Definitely above par.    7) Hello Again (Gothic) A very interesting song, this is probably the darkest on the album.  Definitely not something you'd hear on the radio, but still good stuff.  Excellent lyrics, good growly verse vocals, generally awesome.  A good middle song for the album.    8) Goodbye Tonight And we've changed gears on this one!  We go from the darkest song in the album to the closest song to becoming pop.  Even though it bears the feelings of that other genre, though, this is still kickass 'prophets all the way.  Good lyrics/vocals, great guitaring in the hook, overall a good song before the turning point of the album.  9) Start Something And I mean a turning point!  You see, this CD plays almost like a story in music.  This is the song closest to being full-fledged metal on the album, right before it starts the last 3 songs...those 3 that will determine the fate of the universe! (Or, at least, the album's grade...the story analogy only goes so far)  Great heavy guitars, awesome bass, so-so lyrics, alright vocals, and a nice piano part at the end that leads to...    10) A Million Miles I had to blink a few times to avoid crying at the beauty of the complete harmony of this song.  Excellent lyrics/vocals, great guitaring, and the best part: the best upbeat support violin in the album.  I mean, this thing had a fucking solo in the middle of the song.  The awesomeness of this incredible feat is too much to explain.  It's just that incredible.  For this, Last Train Home is bumped down to #2 and this one is put up there...supreme champion of all.  11) Last Summer We have their obligatory song about summer right here, with awesome vocals, great guitaring, and the best bass on the album.  This, my friends, is #3.  12) Sway And here's the slow song...yeah.  Not as good as Demon Hunter's slow songs, but no one can beat Hunter for those.  Emotional vocals, good piano, and an interesting coda for around 6 minutes or so after the song proper ends...but the song proper is not that good.  An average end to an excellent CD  As a side note, Lostprophets considers this their first "actual CD", because of the time spent on it compared with TFSOP.  TFSOP was not as polished, but it was definitely better.  If the material (Wake up, Burn, Burn) is inferior or repetitive to start with, polishing up the things in between ain't gonna help.  Clocking in at a healthy 54 minutes or so (49 without the coda), this is one helluva buy at $13.  So, go for it, but don't be expecting the complete excellence associated with Demon Hunter.  This band is definitely one to look out for in the years to come, but for now, fans will return to TFSOP until a 3rd comes out.   Report Card: +longer CD +inexpensive +great secondary effects +good vocals - a little too punk-y on some songs - some repetitive stuff - weak slow song appearance  Grade: B+.  Overall, pretty decent, but some little things drag it down.  I cannot in conscience give it an A grade, because even these little things make a huge difference.

      I was going to just add this onto the other part last night, but that time you see was when I started posting.  It was getting pretty late, and about halfway through I decided to just fuck it and do it today.  Now, where was I?  Greed is a big part of what punk is, deep down.  But that is not just why I hate it.  Punk fuels a group mentality, one that severely impairs the minds of listeners/subscribers/followers/cult members (it all amounts to the same thing) and in the process drains their wallets.    Want to be a part of the crowd? Can you mountain bike? How about skateboard? Well, do you play guitar or bass?  You see, there is no real room for individuality in the punk subculture.  There is only more of the same (and in this case, the same means shit).  Now, I'm not saying other types of groups don't do the same thing (the "ghetto" culture, for example).  However, even that other horrible subculture has a small glimmer of honesty to it.  Punk has none.  And it does more than just that.    Now, have you ever seen a perfectly nice, awesome guy turned down by a girl (a girl who says that looks don't matter and that she is looking for someone who won't just constantly demand action) because he wasn't "good enough" or "cool enough" (I have personally heard those two nauseating excuses and many more) but then she turns around and starts going after some total asshole because he fits the stereotypical "cool guy" look?  Well, I can rightfully say that you can blame punk for that too!  How the hell does that have to do with anything, you ask?  Well, I'll tell you.    You see, punk puts a labels the type of guys girls should look for (and vice versa).  To get to anyone, you have to be "in". You have to be "part of the crowd".  You have to be "cool".  To be sure, this has the smallest (thin enough to slice your finger off) glimmer of truth.  The very smallest.  But that's where it ends.  Punk takes this and emphasizes it as much as they can, to the point where if you aren't an exact member of the punk movement, where if you aren't perfectly uniform with the rest of them, you are on the outside.  You are left out in the cold.  You miss out on life.    I myself went along with this bullshit for many wasted years of my life.  I never really got it until around 4 years ago, when I met someone who I still hate to this day and will hate until she is dead.  We had met at the beginning of the summer, in early June, and were interested in each other from the first time we met.  For 4 weeks, we were inseparable, until she said something against my religion and I defended it.  This is not what brought about my eternal anger, though.  What did was, when I defended myself, she simply looked at me, said, "I thought you were different", and went on to the next guy like nothing had happened.  I could not say anything to respond to that verbal betrayal of my trust.    Since then, I have mostly accepted my role as the outsider, the loner, the one on the outside looking in.  However, in this past year, I have reopened my wounds (in the ways explained in the "God hates me" article), but there was something I forgot to mention: both girls that rejected me there were avid punk fans.  The one from Nevada was going for me (maybe) ...until I was supplanted by the guys from Washington who are all complete followers of the movement (extreme sports, the whole drill).  Pathetic knows no bounds.  Oh, and as a side note, I relinquish my provision about Nevada being spared.  It can all go to hell too.  As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if she liked me anyway in the beginning, and it's no use to complain.  The outsider will have his day, and when he does, he will show no mercy.  No mercy for those fools guilty of profiling.  No mercy for the greedy corporations fueling the fires of corruption.  No mercy for punk.

      Now, I was talking before about how I don't really listen to punk music, but I can understand the spirit behind music like country and see the talent behind some rap (not that gangsta shit).  Many of you reading this may be wondering how the hell that came into being.  Well, let me explain.  I mostly listen to metal, myself.  I have a lot to be angry or saddened about, and just as some are uplifted by their music, metal is just a part of who I am.  I like it because it's not as diluted as some of the other types of rock, and it sounds much purer than other types of music to me (this is my blog; if you disagree here, you're just wrong.  Refer to the disclaimer at the top of the page).  As such, I can enjoy the simple honesty of country, the complexity of good rap, and other types of music that do exactly what they say they do.    I'm getting to a point here.  Punk, unlike many other types of music, is completely impure.  It focuses on the material aspects of the music industry, more than any other type of music (have you ever seen a heavy metal shop? a country shop? I mean, really).  A lot of metal focuses on opposition to Christian virtues, but most of that which does (death metal doesn't count because that stuff is made for the sole purpose of being immature) does it from an adult perspective, and generally gives a more mature, direct outlook on that.  Punk, in contrast, does not take a direct stand against Christianity.  Why, you ask? Does it support Christianity? Considering just how many punk songs are about fornication and drinking, I think the answer to that one is a resounding "Hell no!".  It instead attacks the "mainstream" as a whole.    Now, you may be asking yourself 2 questions at this point (at least): what's wrong with that, and why is "mainstream" in quotes?  It's pretty simple, really.  They can't attack something that doesn't really exist as an item and still say that they are doing something original without being hypocrites.    If punk were still out of the musical loop, do you think punk bands would make half as much money off of things such as clothing, posters, and other memorabilia? Do you think they would have almost anyone buying their music, except for the cult following that other less popular types have?  Hell no.  Thus, it stands to reason that they are definitely in the "mainstream" by this point in their existence.  That is, if the "mainstream" actually exists as a thing that can be opposed like they are opposing it.    Now, when you think of an average punk fan, what do you see?  I know I see an irresponsible teenager, holding a skateboard, defying his parents on everything, with no real direction in his life or even ideas about what he or she would do.  Why is this my average stereotype?  Because punk fosters complete commercialism, spawned by the very thing much punk proports to hate: corporate greed.  Because this the type of culture punk supports:  irresponsible, carefree teenagers, dumbed down enough to actually believe all the shit all those who foster punk culture spew out.  Basically, bacterial culture.  If this keeps up, there won't be enough real people left in this country to actually do work.    But it can be so much more disgusting than that.  In my Che post, I said that I've been seeing communism and socialism coming back into prominence.  This is what I was talking about.  When these punk fans are way past their prime of DO THE DEW, X-treme, happy-go-lucky youth, something deep within them realizes that they have nothing to contribute to society.  So, who should pick them up? The far left faction in the country, of course.  They recognize that these people have nothing to lose, and so pick them up with easy, false promises of financial stability and environmental co-existence with wildlife.     Through the lovely system of disguised socialism.  And that is what it really is, no matter what they call it.  And it sounds like a good idea.  However, since there is no incentive to work, any socialist economic system as a whole will quickly (historical time-wise, don't comment to me about how the Soviet Union was significant in the greater scheme of things; they were communism, anyway, so they don't count) fall apart.  Moving on to communism, it does work, but so did Hitler's regime.  This doesn't make it desirable by anyone's standards.  So why do the far left in this country want this?   Power.  It controls every aspect of this mentality, no matter how small, to every corner of it.  Money is just another form of power, really, albeit a less direct one.  And power is why I hate punk (to get back to the point).  Lust for power ruined what could have been a legitimate branch of the noble lineage of rock and roll, corrupting it for something as fleeting as power over a socialist government.  And that is why I call you, whoever the hell you are, to boycott punk music.  Turn off the radio when you hear it, burn any CDs of theirs you find, don't download a single song of theirs.  If they want to get away from the mainstream, they can...with a little help.  Help out the American way and join me in hating punk, that unholy font of corruption.  Now, I have other reasons for hating punk, but this post took me way too long.  I'll finish it up tomorrow.

      All sorts of stuff going on...but with a theme now! Now it's not completely random -- now it's all related to God hating me!  One of the only girls I had a chance with lives in fucking Nevada and thinks I'm crazy, the other is obsessed with her asshole ex, and one of the only girls that like me is an ugly stalker.  Now, where do I begin...  Now, I've met some girls I've been interested in in my time.  None so much as this one.  This girl is not only hot, she's smart, she's funny, she has a personality (a rare thing indeed), she speaks fluent German and she plays guitar in an all-girl punk (made me wince, but fixable) band.  However, there's 2 large problems in my way.  One of these is the fact that she lives in the shithole known as Nevada, which is as far from Maryland as possible as far as I'm concerned.  The other is that, because I had a song stuck in my head, didnt have the CD with me and felt a compulsion to mouth the words, she thinks I'm absolutely insane (no matter how I tried to explain, she still thinks I talk to myself).    On the positive side, because of her, my sentence upon the West Coast (it all needs to be blown off the face of the earth) has been revised (it all needs to be blown off the face of the earth, except for Nevada).  I feel proud of myself.  Now, before I met her, there was a girl I knew locally.  Not exactly a prize trophy, but relatively good looking nonetheless and cool to boot.  One little problem.  Some people have love triangles screwing them over; I happen to be fortunate enough to have a love pyramid here.  She is also being chased after by 2 boys who both go to her school (I don't) and so see her every day.  The one she hates, and so is inconsequential.  The other is the problem, in that he's not all that interested but she can't get enough of him to the point where she ignores nearly everything else as a possibility.  She was bragging at one point that he called her up wasted and told her he loved her (if you feel good because of something like that, you're really obsessed or just screwed up).  Now, I would just leave them be, but I know he's gonna disappoint her again and again (it's just that they're incompatible), so I (idiotic moralist that I am) am trying to find someone (anyone, not necessarily me) who she will be happy with who won't let her down.    You may be wondering, does anyone show any interest in me? The answer is yes, but I wish they didn't.  About 3 years ago, I knew a girl who had the biggest crush on me, and though she was ugly, I was going along with it for a while (hey, why not).  That is, until she gave out my screen name to every girl on her street, which was not cool when I couldn't get on without at least 3 people who hadn't even heard of our school wanting to talk to me.  So, I shut her out, thinking it would just fade into the past after a while.  I thought it had, until about a month ago when I got the creepiest one-letter IM ever to my screen name ("y?").  Now, I hadn't even seen her in the distance since about mid-eighth grade, so this came as a complete shock.    That is why if I ever hear from her again, I will welcome her with open arms...and a machete in each hand.  Well, that's enough self-pity for one night.  Hey, maybe I'll come up with something productive tomorrow!

      About a month ago, I was looking for something on the internet when I stumbled upon a group of links bearing the title "Bands to check out".  Crossfade, one of my favorite new bands, was on there, right next to a band called Demon Hunter.  The name sounded somewhat intriguing, so I decided to go to their website (www.demonhunter.net) and see if they had any clips of their songs.  What I found there (Full versions of Not Ready to Die, Infected, The Latest and the Last) made me a huge fan, and impressed me enough that I went the next day to go buy the CD.  I was not disappointed.    I have read many reviews of this CD in the meantime, some good, some bad, most ignoring the fact that this CD stomps so much ass that it doesn't matter if they "sold out by using some melodic songs".  If it sounds this awesome, who gives a flying fuck?  This is another pet peeve of mine (I have many), but I can easily counter that by making one helluva good review.  So, here goes...  Demon Hunter is a little known Christian metal band who has 2 albums: their self-titled effort, released in 2002, and Summer of Darkness, released last May.  I am reviewing the latter, in case you ignored the title of this post.  This CD has many interesting facets to it, including the use of cellos in one song, guest singers from bands like Agony Scene and Thousand-Foot Krutch, and Hunter's lead vocalist's nearly unintelligible growling and incredibly clear singing.  Hardcore metal fans will love growly, fast-paced songs like Not Ready to Die, Beheaded, and Beauty Through the Eyes of a Predator, while fans of lighter stuff will appreciate the singing in their incredible slow songs, My Heartstrings Come Undone and I Play Dead.  Without further ado, here is a complete list of the songs on this album.  1) Not Ready to Die Excellent lyrics, good vocals, awesome guitaring, and an awesome ending.  What more could you ask for?  2) The Awakening An interesting song, this song has the melodic chorus happen before the verses as opposed to after them.  This makes a song that is clearly different from the normal pattern, but still excellent.  3) Beheaded One of their strangest songs ever, this features the singer from Agony Scene singing in what can only be described as a demon voice opposite Hunter's vocalist, which is a lot creepier than it sounds but is a very well done fast metal piece.  Very well done, indeed.    4) My Heartstrings Come Undone Wow.  This is the type of song that separates the whining little wannabe metalists from the true men.  Not only can they pump out awesome heavy, fast metal songs, they can completely change gears and make this incredible demonstration of their talent.  A slow song with metal undercurrents, this is easily one of my favorite songs on the album.    5) Our Faces Fall Apart The Agony Scene singer is back, but this time singing the same words as Hunter's vocalist.  Good intro (especially when listening with headphones), great lyrics, overall good song.  6) Less Than Nothing With this song, I realized something:  If Linkin Park stays around long enough, they might just transform into something reminiscient of this band.  The beginning sounded so much like Papercut, it wasn't funny.  Of course, Less Than Nothing kicked so much more ass than that other one, so it's safe to say that the song is good and original.    7) Summer of Darkness We have a winner!  With a strange, whispered intro, growled verses, a chorus that alternates between singing and growling, and some awesome lyrics, this is my favorite song on the album, hands down.    8) Beauty Through the Eyes of a Predator Not my favorite song on the album, but good nonetheless.  There is a guest singer on this one, though I can't remember what band he's from, and he does a good job getting the edginess in the prechorus down.  As a side note, it sounds like the song is going to end about a minute before it actually does, but then keeps going for one incredible ending.    9) Annihilate the Corrupt A cross between a metal tempo and guitaring and nice, even singing from another guest singer.  A really good song for the home stretch of an album, where many less talented bands crap out usually.    10) I Play Dead Their second slow song on the album, this is one of the most emotional songs by them.  With good lyrics and singing, heavy guitaring, and cello played 2 ways for emotional emphasis, this song will get you feeling for them.    11) Everything was White Even in the last 3 songs, we're still pumping out hits here.  This is a nice, lively lighter song, with good growling and singing.  Excellent.  12) Coffin Builder A darker sounding song, a combination of good lyrics, a strange tempo, and good guest singing from who I think is the singer from Thousand-Foot Krutch make this an irreplaceable addition to the album.    13) The Latest and the Last A very fitting end song, this is heavy and meaningful, with awesome playing to boot.  A good way to finish off this album.    On a side note, this CD is almost 55 minutes long (with no long gaps) -- an excellent length considering I only paid $15 for this CD.  If you're a metal fan, this is your CD.  If you have even a slight interest in metal, this is your CD.  If you've never heard of metal before, this is your CD.  So what are you waiting for? Get off your lazy asses and buy this thing!  Report Card: +good fast songs +slow ones kick ass too +good guest singers +good length +good price  Grade:  A.  This isn't the holy grail of music, but it's damn close. So very close.

      Alright, here we go.  I was walking around with a group of my friends the other day when I made the unfortunate mistake of walking into a "punk shop" with them.  Now, this should stand out as a poor choice of judgment on its own, but it doesn't end there.  I walked in and was immediately accosted by a t-shirt, right in my face.  I recognized the front at first as reminiscient of Maddox (www.thebestpageintheuniverse.com) 's t-shirts (and I thought it was at first) but something nagged at me.  It just wasn't awesome enough. So, I looked harder and harder, and as I was looking I remembered something he had mentioned about his logo making fun of someone named Che and how Che was regarded as a revolutionary but was really just a pinko.  So, when I got home today, I did a little Google search under "Che".  What I found was not pretty.  Not pretty at all.    Now, if you have any information about Che, you will know that he was a marxist who raised all sorts of hell in Guatemala before going to Cuba to support Castro in his takeover and later got killed in Bolivia.  This alone is beyond disturbing, considering that HIS HEAD WAS ON A FUCKING T-SHIRT IN AMERICA.  But if we delve deeper, we find that his belief was that a violent revolution alone could change the status quo in Latin America.  Now, I'm not saying at all that the dictators who held those countries were great guys who were completely innocent; they were right bastards themselves.  However, stirring up guerrilla wars across the whole continent without trying anything else is not the act of a true leader; it is the act of a cowardly terrorist.    Disagree with that assertion?  Then consider this.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the USA was not just unjust; it was extremely fucked up.  Racism, sexism, and all sorts of that shit abounded in forms we who were born in the later half of the 20th century can't even imagine.  Did we have to have a violent, bloody revolution to get racial equality? Hell no.  Those incredible activists in the days of the civil rights movement managed to get equal rights for all races and both sexes, and with nonviolent techniques to boot.  Now, you may be thinking, "BUT ANDRAS THEY WERENT UNDER ANY PRESSURE THATS NO REAL COMPARISON LOL".  (By the way, if you do think that way, there is something serioiusly wrong with you.)  Well, then, I guess it was just absolutely safe for any African-American to simply walk out in the middle of town after a nice long protest speech or sit-in, right?  Wrong.  They would probably get their shit ruined, if they weren't simply lynched on the spot.  You see, repression doesn't necessarily need to be government-sanctioned to still be repression.  This is something Communists, Marxists, and Socialists never really got, and have a tendency to ignore even today.    Now, if a minority of people in this country could bring about equal rights for generations to come (I think they're regressing with affirmative action, but we're getting off topic), then what was a majority of people in those countries could have conceivably held a nonviolent movement to reform the militaristic governments ruling them.  But then Che and his "revolutionaries" (I say this with deepest contempt) came in and completely fucked up the process for these countries.  As an indirect result, long after many of those governments were overthrown in Che's style, we have "democratic republics" there.  I use the quotes here because they're democracies only in name; in practice, they are no better than the regimes they overthrew.  Thus, what did he really accomplish? He helped Cuba go from bad to worse, and later completely screwed over the Latin American continent.  I bet at least half of the Che supporters who are reading this page are probably putting their fingers in their ears, squeezing their eyes closed, and murmuring,"SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP..." while curled up in a fetal position.  I'm guessing this because most of what I found in my search was propaganda by radical groups, the reality chewed up and spat out by a bunch of rich children who only have the luxury to be this stupid because we helped put an end to this menace to society.    Now, I'll get into the punk movement (almost like the bowel movement, but much more disgusting) later, but still, when a group focuses on someone who basically fucked up the entire Latin American area for the duration as a role model, one tends to wonder what is really going on behind the scenes.  I, as a good American citizen, have the obligation to cry bullshit on this one, not only because it is frightening beyond belief that teenagers all across the country are flocking to this terrorist hack as a role model but that it could mean a much more dangerous trend -- yes, I'm talking about a resurgence in Communism and Socialism.  I've seen it coming on over the past couple of years, and this sighting of that unholy icon on a T-shirt only reinforces my point.  I only hope that people will realize they're being dipshits before the American way is completely fucked over.

      First blog, first post, first random bag of complaints, rants, raves, reviews, and something else that starts with an R.  Where to begin...  I live right in the suburbs of the boondocks of Maryland, and I go to a Jesuit high school.  No, don't ask me which one; it doesn't matter.  At the time I am writing this, I am nearly 16 and have just completed a 10-day leadership program (which basically taught me that it isn't just Maryland -- people are two-faced, lying whores across the country) and am returning to my incredible summer job in which I do all the work and whichever spoiled brat is working the shift with me slacks off and gets paid the same.  I listen to most types of rock, shying away only from the soft and punk varieties (we'll get into why later), but I can also appreciate the spirit behind such music as country (although you ain't gonna see me jamming out to that anytime soon).  I, unlike pretty much every other quasi-intelligent student in my school, am a devout christian, but not necessarily a Catholic anymore (another thing I don't feel like talking about now).    If you're still awake after reading this, you either drink way too much caffeine, are incredibly bored, or know me.  In any case, keep reading these posts.  You may find them interesting, funny, or useful for toilet paper.  I'd prefer the first 2, but I honestly couldn't give a damn about the last one in that this blog is free.    Fun stuff.

      Now, I've listened to some scary shit in my time.  I listen to death metal on a regular basis, and none of that stuff, scary as it is, has put me quite off-balance as what i heard today.  What I heard today will haunt my nightmares for a long, long time.  Like the whore's manifesto I saw the other day, this was beyond the pale.  This is what prompts things like the whore's manifesto.  This song made me want to vomit, and then take a few cold showers...of flaming gasoline, to purge away the uncleanliness.  This song is called "She will be loved", by Maroon 5 ( I want to spit at any mention of that blasphemous name, but have no good place for it).    I was introduced to this song by a quote in some girl's profile.  This quote goes as so:  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved  It seemed innocent enough, so I downloaded it (illegally; this is the only reason I haven't commited Seppuku for listening to this, I didn't pay a dime) and let 'er rip.  This song was disturbing on several levels, 2 of which I will cover in this post (which you are all dying to read).  To say the least, I felt like my life had just been shortened by around 10 years.  This was disturbing on these levels:  1) Shitty music backbone This same-same, Pop-rock, trendy shit is normally stuff I don't listen to.  At least, normally, it's harmless enough.  It might give me extreme diarrhea, but it won't give me thoughts of ritual suicide to restore my wounded honor.  This was that bad.  It was everything every stereotype is, and much more.  It was so bad, so tacky, so overdone.  If this had even had decent lyrics, it would still be pretty bad.  But it didn't, oh no, and it only goes downhill from there.  2) Brainwashing lyrics And this is the real point of this article.  These lyrics are exactly why I keep fighting, even when hope fails me.  This shit is what inspires things like the travesty that was that single away message, for which I will never forget her name in my "Dear Jesus, please have ___ get hit by a bus" prayers.  These lyrics are the train wreck of the century.  If these lyrics got more of a hold on society...I don't know what would happen.  We would all become schmaltzy, sentimental communist pigs, all hailing the almighty stereotype of a lonely girl and a guy with a choice to help her.  Well, I hope you didn't put much stock in diarrhea medicine, because here comes the relief!  Aaaaaahhhhhh.  It's called "Reality check", and it's good stuff.  Nowadays, if a girl is in that position, she is baiting the trap, waiting for some poor sucker to come in and try to actually love her (you know, the thing she was looking for?) before she turns around and stabs him in the back, like is much more usual, and then resets the trap, hoping to get more idiots.  What, do you think I've never been down this road before?  It's happened more than once to me before.    Now I have to go, before my power goes out.  Now that I think about it, don't just kill a whore to help society.  Kill two!

      Well, the title speaks for itself.  I'm just wasting time on this Saturday night that I should be actually doing something, so here goes nothing.  "You've got a lot of nerve And I got a lot of fingers to point While you were busy building knowledge I was already right And a voice like yours Is not a weapon at all Even mine is not a chisel For a thickened skull  So you can chant your anthems to the deaf And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left Or we can take our voices with our hands Make like knives and make demands"     -Demon Hunter, Not Ready to Die    "Everwinter - Divine state of mind..  In the heart of the north I have walked through the snow; I look back at the trail that I came. One set of footprints I see, but now I know I wasn't alone; Because the trails are not mine..  Into the purifying light I walk without fear; I feel the frost of holiness carry me..  Frozen from the world I'm in; State of mind.. ..of divine! Everwinter.. Frozen state of my mind; Divine in the world I'm in; Everwinter is nigh!"      -Immortal Souls, Everwinter       "I guess you finally made the deepest cut I guess the blade on my tongue was just too much All the words came from my dark side, Now this emptiness is real  You reach beneath the surface more  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Too blind to see You stole my honesty  I think about the time we lost I think about the time the silence could be words And now the only sound I hear is my guilty conscience Screaming out your name  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Too blind to see You stole my honesty  So could you leave me with my last regret Let me feel the way you left me dead Steal away my thoughts of honesty"       -Sevendust, Honesty    "She is everything to me The unrequited dream The song that no one sings The unattainable She's a myth that I have to believe in All I need is one more reason I don't know what to do I don't know what to do"      -Slipknot, Vermilion Pt. 2    "I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit Tonight"      -Linkin Park, Breaking the Habit   That's enough for now.  I don't feel like wasting another hour finding a few quotes awesome enough to fit in there.    Damn, I'm bored.  I have no one to share any of this shit with (who would give a damn).  So, it'll just fester and rot in some long-forgotten part of my archives.  Isn't that nice?

      Song of the day:  "Man of Sorrow", by Immortal Souls on the album "Ice upon the night".  This song is like heroin to a fan of classic metal, the stuff the best people in this nation were raised on.  Finnish Christian Winter Death Metal kicks ass.   Confused yet?  Well, I have seen something that has disturbed me to the point of writing about it: one of them has finally admitted it.  One of them has admitted she's a drunken, dirty whore.  This is a recopying of an away message of hers.  GET DEM HOTTIES DEN DRINK TILL THEIR CUTE!! CAUSE THATS HOW THE LADIES ROLL!  HAPPY B-DAY (******) (name of person) B.B. LATE  Wow.  Just, wow.  I had to read that a few times to try to understand it, and when I did I nearly projectile vomited far enough to hit her door (a thirty minute drive away).  That there is just disgusting.  It is exactly what I fight against.  This message, the author of which will remain unknown to you, is a filthy, two-faced bitch's manifesto.  It might as well read so:  DRINK TEL DEY HOTTTT CAUZ DATS HOW WE START BECOMIN CRAK WHORES HAPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY, FELOW ASS-BITCH B.B. AFTER DEGRADING SELF REPEADEDLY CAUSE THASS HOW WE ROLLS!!! ROTFLMAO@US!!!!!!!11  Now that I think about it, that's exactly what it means.  Thanks for helping out, ladies!  Your invaluable contribution to society's morals is most appreciated.  Now, get down on your knees, 'cause that's gonna be a very useful position to remember for the rest of your life. First, it will be useful when with your obvious leaning towards intellectual prospects and responsibility makes you the office whore and later the feature at the sleazy shack down the street.  Later, when the rest of us see the news headline about the K-town (if you aren't from the Maryland area, don't worry about it) hooker ring getting busted for drug possession and prostitution, it will be useful to use when pleading with the judge that your parents are really the ones to blame.    Sadly enough, they would be partially right.  Many of the parents of these spoiled little shits don't really care what their kid is doing, no matter how illegal or immoral it is.  Worse, some know, but don't do anything because they don't want to be too harsh.  Now, I speak for all the angry conservatives/ moderates/ idiots out there when I say the following:  GROW SOME FUCKING BALLS, YOU LIBERAL PUSSIES, AND DISCIPLINE YOUR CHILDREN!  This is one of the few things I agree with Maddox on fully.  Corporal Discipline (TM) is never used these days, because of the 60's.  So here I can rightfully say that the hippies fucked it all up for everyone.  Today, we call them "environmentalists" and "activists".    Activists, huh? Well, I'm an activist against your activism.  And I say: beat the hell outta those little shits.  Maddox says it more descriptively, but that should cover that.  In fact, I say go back to the way it was before political correctness took hold like a herpes virus.  That should get us back into being a productive, moral society.  And we've come full circle back to the issue: girls today are all whores.  End of class.  Save society for the future --  kill a whore!

      Now, something really pissed me off the other day, so much that I have to put it down here before I forget it.  I, while walking around with that girl (you should know which one by now, I've written 2 posts before this relating to her) saw one jackass in my class driving by in a golf cart (he works at the golf camp).  Now, I expected him to, at the most, wave to me and call out some kind of greeting before driving away.  I mean, after 2 years in the same class as me, he should know better, right?   Wrong!  Walking to and from my work, we were accosted by this asswipe, who proceeded to talk to us for a good 10 minutes each time.  AAARRRRGH!  I'd worked months to get to even that point, so I am thoroughly pissed at him.  Unfortunately, she was right there, so I couldn't even make a horrifically violent death threat.  Damn.    Of course, if that bastard (or any of the other dipshits in my class) tries to nose in on my action again, I am not going to settle with threatening to carve out little parts of their small intestine while pouring industrial-strength acid over the wounds.  They are simply going to get Ol' Faithful (read: switchblade) in the brain.  It saves a lot of energy and time, on my part.    Now I have to go, I have an entire day ahead of me.  I'll be back later.  I know you'll miss me, but you'll just have to bear the pain of separation.

      Song of the day: Vermilion, by Slipknot on "The Subliminal Verses".  The creepiest love song ever, including "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails.   It's that creepy...and it's one of Slipknot's best.   Alright, this post refers to my "best day all summer" post a little.  If you haven't read that one, you won't know what the hell is going on.  Do so.  In fact, if you do indeed have enough time to read this, read all of my posts before reading this.  It's a lot more convincing when you agree with me before reading this article.  I decided to talk to my friend, the one who gives out my screen name to random girls (once again, I have no idea why, but I count my blessings), because he had just come back from Turkey.  He thinks it's better than the US of A, but that's because he's a fucking liberal.  Go figure.  Liberals are stupid enough to believe that anywhere's better than the US, but that's because they're dipshits -- nowhere else can you get the freedoms granted to us in the constitution, even though those are being slowly eroded away by political correctness.  I would go on, but I have a subject line here, no matter how thin, so go to the link in the title for more information on this.  Back to the topic, he mentioned how it was his advice that I not get any ideas about that one girl -- whose screen name he gave me, to whom I have been talking since March, whom I met last Thursday, who is incredibly hot, and who is the only one of these girls who shows any interest in me at all.  Now, I've known this guy for nearly 2 years now, so I figured he had better have a fucking good reason for this one.  Then, he pulls the weakest excuse I've ever heard: she has been known to give up on guys after a week or so.  Now, that is weak.  Even if this were applicable to yours truly, I wouldn't give a damn.  She is hot enough that if I were with her for one week only, I would consider that time well spent.  Really well spent.  Now that I think of it, it would put me beyond the nerd hall of fame if I got busy with her:  it would put me in nerd Godhood, at which point people tell their children of my exploits and say "See? You can get laid, too, if you kick this much ass."  Of course, this wouldn't be true, because I kick way too much ass to emulate, but it's the thought that counts.  Besides, it would pretty much wipe out all the "Final Fantasy" geeks.    But it's not applicable, I figure.  Why?  Well, let's consider the facts.  I had been talking to her since March online (of her prompting much more than mine) before I actually met her.  Thus, there's gotta be something interesting here that kept her talking to me.  She goes to a public school, so I assume from this fact that most of her guys that she "gave up on after a week" were smacktards (I picked up that phrase from APB. I feel very patriotic) with cookie-cutter tastes and attitudes who had the intelligence of a bag of shit. (My friend has a tendency to leave out these details.)  She probably saw these idiots day after day, which would get monotonous even for me, and was probably constantly pressured by them to do more and more.  Damn, no wonder she gave up on them after a week:  that would even drive ME crazy, if I were in the opposite position.  Hell, she probably talked to me to break up the monotony.  I wouldn't get the chance to talk to her even every other day, really, so it wouldn't get too boring.  If you have been reading these posts, I would assume you have a good idea of just how unconventional and interesting everything I believe really is.  (Unless you're a commie punk fan who watches chick flicks, in which case you should refer to the notice at the top of the page in the light blue section...and by the way, if this applies to you and you are a guy, get a sex change or cut off your balls.  It will make it all less confusing for you whether you should be looking at guys or girls.)  Seeing all that varied shit I managed to pack into only a few posts, you can imagine just how interesting it would really be to pick my brain on a daily basis.    So, my friend tried to shut me down (he wants me to go for another one of his friends, but she just isn't interested.  I can't do anything if she isn't willing to hold up the other end), but I'm gonna keep on going, by God.  I won't be denied this one thing that is going right because some guy decides it's not in his gameplan for me to go out with one of the few girls who showed any (positive...in my life, the two majorities of girls are ignorers and stalkers) interest in me.  And, as God as my witness, I will prove him wrong about her, because it's the American way, dammit!  Damn, I feel patriotic now.  It feels like testosterone.  Having said that, there is nothing else I can really add to this post, so I will leave now.  Thank you, g'night!

      Song of the day: "My Heartstrings Come Undone", by Demon Hunter.  Because it's the most kickass slow metal song ever.  Ever.  Chick flicks are a stain on America.  I mean, really.  These things break at least 3 fundamental laws of life that I cannot tolerate being broken.  Law 1: The "Don't undermine the non-radical feminist movement" law  Now, there are some honest-to-goodness feminists out there, actually trying to help their gender.  These are undermined every time another of these pieces of shit come out.  How, you ask?  Well, since you are ignorant enough to not get it, I'll spell it out for you.  These pieces of shit encourage the radical, FemiNazi movement, the "I am Woman, hear me roar" bull-dykes who think that they need to emulate the actresses in the movies in being independent, intelligent: the woman's woman!  This does nothing for the feminists who aren't just in it for the publicity, those working behind the scenes, those actually making a difference.  I mean, if you really want to make a difference in the movement, we real men are rooting for you...if you boycott these pieces of shit.   Law 2: The "Make money despite having a thin plot, shitty acting, and no real redeeming characteristics" law  This one speaks for itself.  These things have nothing going for them, and yet succeed because of all the pre-pubescent girls who can't possibly think for themselves to actually pick a worthwhile movie.  Even Roger Ebert, the living half of Siskel and Ebert, is starting to pan these pieces of shit (There was a link on Fark to this, and as soon as I get a hold of it if it hasn't expired I'll put that baby up).     Law 3: The "Prevent the Vader from getting laid by anyone worthwhile" law  Another one that speaks for itself.  If you are slow enough to not get who the Vader is from the URL of this site, you are a bonafide douche.  These pieces of shit raise the bar for guys high enough that I, your beloved blogger, can't get over.  The guys in these movies are hot, sensitive, nice, and a bunch of other things that don't fit very well together.  These movies make it seem like many guys are like this.  But let's face it: if such a guy existed, he would either get killed by all the other guys in a heartbeat or he would just snatch up the hottest girl around and leave all the rest of us in the dust.  Most likely, the first.  Now, every girl wants their own Prince Charming, but none exist, so they obviously settle for the hottest one, ignore the fact that he's a jackass, and then complain when they find him sleeping around.  (Everyone knows someone like this, because there is no short supply.)  This means that I, who am intellectually superior, actually give half a damn, and am generally nicer to girls than the average future grocery-bagger (I tip my hat to the Master of the Universe with that one) get shit (because I am around par for the course on the looks department), while those dipshits get 'em every time without much work.  Over and over again.  I mean, if these girls don't get it after they've been cheated on for the fifth time by some jock who can't even read (If you are reading this and go to my high school, I shouldn't have to go farther.  How these idiots get in to a Jesuit school is beyond me...oh wait, that's right, they're around the average age of 18 in freshman year), then they've been so thoroughly brainwashed that I don't have a snowball's chance in hell.    On a side note, I just finished off the best week this summer.  Kick ass.  That week was awesome.

      Now, I've had good days this summer.  I had a surprise trip to King's Dominion during Engineering Camp.  I had the distinct pleasure of slowdancing with a crazy Bulgarian who kept telling me how naughty she really was (...?) and completely ignoring her.  I went to Italy for 10 days.  I was one of 40 people (evenly matched, gender-wise) at a dance, and actually got some dancing in (right next to the guy from Baltimore, an admitted nerd, who was dancing his fucking pelvis off...what a beast).  I've floored it down a hill on a golf cart with no governor (and nearly bounced los cajones into oblivion because the fucking thing has no shocks).  I've met another person who's double-jointed in the shoulders.  But I have never had so many things go well in one day.    To start it off, I had a morning shift in the golf shop.  Now, normally this would suck.  But I got to listen to 5 albums on my ipod (we'll get to that later), and actually broke even in the daily hold 'em match (I won, and then lost, 2 dollars).  On top of that, I actually got the chance to tell one of the fucking campers to piss off.  Normally, I am not allowed to tell kids, no matter how annoying they are, to get out of the shop, but one of them broke a glass pot cover, so I could tell them to go away.  Thus, with them gone, I could turn off the AC (which blows right on my neck) and just space out, like normal.  But this was nowhere near the best thing that happened that day.    One of my friends has this strange habit of giving out my AIM screen name (no, its not the handle in the hyperlink, so don't try it, stalkers) to random girls I've never met.  Don't ask me why; I don't ask (I just count my blessings).  One of these, a girl I had never met (most of them I did at one point see, but never again, so it matters little either way), but had been talking to since March, had mentioned something about doing nothing this summer.  So, I extended the invitation for her to come by the golf shop and go to lunch with her, figuring she would just find some crappy cop-out excuse to not go to lunch, or for that matter see me at all.  She surprised me by accepting, and right after my shift we walked over to the local mall, had lunch, and saw a movie.  And one thing my friend didn't remember to mention about her: she is HOT.  Really hot.  I mean, some of his friends are OK- looking, but this one was above par, even to my jaded eyes.  Even better, she mentioned something about some movie showings in late August across the street from where I work.  That's right, I didn't even need to introduce a lead-in to more: she beat me to the chase.  Oh, baby.  This is good stuff.  Thus the best day ever ends with me writing a post for all 3 of my devoted fans while listening to Slipknot.  Pure bliss.    Oh, yes, and for my birthday on Sunday I got an ipod.  Nice.  Now I don't have to lug around a huge CD player when I've got something in my head.  That's good stuff.  They should have invented these things earlier.  And that's it.  Good stuff.  For once.
