      Here I am at 2 in the morning on the damn computer, evil insomnia/nightmares. Well, anyway, it's Easter weekend and yea. I saw Hell Boy today, it was an ok movie, IT HAD BLUE FIRE IN IT!! Crap-munkies, that creepy ass Robin guy is coing to Guelph tomorrow....I mean today, and yes, I have made friends with the dust bunnies under my computer desk because that is where I'll be hiding for the whole day. Well in reality I'm going to the Humane Society tomorr...today...and maybe JUST MAYBE my dad will buy me a damn web cam at some point this weekend. I can't glare at myself but if I could I would for breaking the old web cam.  My fat hairy beached whale cat is staring at me right now and it's creeping me out.  What else should I write? Maybe I'll tell you about the dream I had. I was being chased by some psycho killer that cuts people's faces off and wears them as masks......that is all.  OH YEA! I forgot about Joel. I thought I should mention him in here since I was a meanie and tripped him earlier, yea I'm angelic......I also kicked him in the shin....ahem.  I should try and get some sleep. Maybe I'll have less creepy nightmares.  Good night. Good early morning. Whichever.

      Stupid subsitute teacher. Stupid ulcer. Stupid sewing machines.  Stupid bald teacher eating fries in the classroom. Hungry.Need.Fries. I was very close to killing him.  My ulcer is being retarded today.  Ooo, funny story. I was sewing my skirt and my mom said something to me so I turned to answer her and the sewing needle went through my finger. Nail and all. Well, not that funny. Just owwie painful.

      I've been updating alot lately. I've already updated today and I'm doing it again.  I can't say that I'm bored. I'm too worried to be bored. It feels like my ulcer is doing a jig.  I have about 875364587437678568726547 viruses on my computer right now. It'll take me at least 24 hours to go through all the files and get rid of the viruses. Fun.   Well, bye bye.

      My aunt never came to pick up the brats last night, so I had to make them breakfast and get them ready and take them to school this morning...I feel like a mom :S  I've been trying to get ahold of my aunt but her cell phone is turned off and she's not at her house. Humbug.  Have to pick them up from school in a half an hour.  I hope they at least behave a bit. Stupid, evil terrors. Also hope my aunt calls soon.  Well, bye.

      A pile of shit. That is how I would describe my life as of now.   So many things going wrong. It would take at least an hour to type ALL of them out so I'll be vague.  - Problems at home. With family. - Problems at school. - Problems with friends. - Problems with my health.  Just alot of problems. Bah!

      Tighten your tie boy. You're something to die for. But don't hold your breath now. You're just killing time. Tonight you can dream boy. Imagine a whisper. If you can keep secrets, then I'll tell you mine. Remember a promise you couldn't hold on to. Though it brings me to tears now, I need you to know. Look in my eyes boy. Nothing like yours now. It seems like a lifetime is passing us by. So open your eyes.  This is forever but it won't last long. This is a memory that fades away in neverending. In the death of all that's long been said and done before, we'll wish that you were something more.  Stop wasting time boy. You're late all your life boy. They won't have the patience for someone like you. Your memory's fading. I'll love you forever. I'll try to remember. I'll try to hold on. You're standing alone boy. Waitng for dreams boy. Waiting for someone to make them come true. Don't ever leave boy. I'd miss you too much boy. I'll never forget you, as long as I'm here.  ...I'm becoming addicted to this song.  http://nothingandnowhere.com/flash3.html

      I want to talk to somebody. Anybody.  I want Jack. I want him to come online. I want to talk to him. Want, need, all the same.  I feel like crap today. I'm worrying my ass off. I haven't been able to keep any food down. I have nothing left in my stomach now.

       Passing out   I thought I should start putting titles on my entries. Or maybe I'm just ripping off Daina. =D  I've been passing out alot lately and I'm starting to think It's more then just low sugars and such.  If my stupid doctor would stop staring at my boobs for two seconds and actually pay attention maybe he could tell me what's wrong. Ass.  I'm really hot. Stupid boiling weather.  I want my dad's purpley car. It's like from the sixties and such. I want! I want! Gimme! Gimme!  I should go to bed now before I ramble on even further.   Night.    P.S. I forgot to steal Daina's chair again. Crap. Oh well, I will later.
