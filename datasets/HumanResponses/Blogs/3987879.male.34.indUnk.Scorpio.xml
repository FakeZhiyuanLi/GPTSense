       Today was another aerobic day. I spent an hour on the stationary bike and burned 504 calories. This is considered a light to moderate aerobic workout but my room mate makes it out to an intense energy draining exercise. So much for the Atkin's Diet.  There's a formula that says you need to burn 3500 more calories than you take in to lose one pound of fat. This isn't totally correct because your body doesn't just use your fat as a fuel source when your body isn't getting enough calories to burn from food. Without proper training and diet, you could lose muscle mass once your glycogen levels are depleted and your fat stores barely touched. If you are losing more than two pounds a week, you are most likely losing muscle mass along with your fat. In my case, I don't want that. I actually don't want to lose any weight.  Weight training burns more calories than an aerobic workout for the same period of time but it's a carbohydrate fueled exercise. It's going to burn fuel from what you eat and what's stored as glycogen. Aerobic exercise is fueled mostly by free fatty acids which come from your body fat stores. I'm not saying weight training is not good for burning fat because weight training does increase your metabolic rate more than aerobic exercise does. You need both. It's just that aerobic exercise is a better indicator on how much fat you are losing during an exercise. Then the weight training helps you to store whatever energy you are getting from food back to the muscles and not to fat. That's my key goal in my workout schedule. It's not to cut 3500 calories from my diet, but to burn 3500 calories from fat stores with aerobic exercise to lose that pound of fat.

       Today is chest and tricep day. This is my weakest area. I couldn't even bench 135 for more than one rep and couldn't do more than one unassisted dip (I did try the dip after the chest workout though). I'm happy I'm losing the fat but it just shows how small my chest really is. My room mate suggested doing strength training on the chest and tricep day and worry about bulking that area up later. I'll keep pushing through. I'm not expecting a huge chest overnight.  After the chest and tricep workout, we did cardio on a stationary bike for about 20 minutes. I kept my heart rate up to 150 but it took me about 5 to 6 minutes before my heart rate even got up to that level.  My room mate keeps trying to go on the Atkins diet but never seems to last a week on it. I personally think it's stupid to deprive yourself of carbs. I think it's better just to watch your calorie intake if you are wanting to lose fat. Since I'm trying to lose fat and not lose lean body mass, I'm more about just increasing metabolism than anything else. I'm not even watching the calorie intake that hard. I'm also not overloading on food for bulking up either (I may do that later when my body fat percentage gets low enough). I haven't lost any weight since I've been working out, but you can see by the pics, I have lost some fat. I'll wait until about the two month mark before I get an appointment to check my body fat percentage again. Until, then I'll keep working hard on that midsection.

       Today is a day of rest. Well, sort of. No weights and no cardio today but every Sunday my room mate and I babysit a seven year old girl for a woman with work with (I used to be really infatuated with the mom; I guess I still am a little bit). You can't really rest being around a seven year old. They have way too much energy and this girl is above the norm in energy. When she is playing on the moneky bars, I'm amazed by the strength of a little girl who doesn't even weigh 50 pounds. She has more calluses on her hand than most bodybuilders I know. If I could bottle that energy into a supplement, I would be a billionaire.  I weighed myself today and was at 186 pounds. So, I am assuming I'm losing fat quicker than I'm gaining muscle. I would hate to think I'm losing both. I may take some more pictures and put them up since it's a week since I've started this blog, but I have to go into work soon and don't have time to do it now.

       My room mate and I did legs and shoulders today. I did a little more on leg presses than I'm used to (360 pounds instead of 320 pounds), which should be a good thing. My room mate said that by next year we should be doing 900 pounds. I'll wait and see.  I'm trying to talk my room mate into getting into a more regular schedule because of moving the leg day back one day. He wants to do shoulders on a seperate day than legs. I'm willing to compromise but that means four days a week instead of three days for weight training and he is already missing some days. I proposed that we do chest and triceps on Monday, back and biceps on Wednesday, legs on Friday, and shoulders on Saturday. Do thirty minutes of cardio on days that we do weight and an hour on the days that we don't do weight. I think he wants 45 minutes on days that we do wieghts. I think that's a little to much even though I think Bill Davey says he does 40 minutes every day.  There's another friend of mine who wants to work out with us too, but that means we would have to go to a different 24 Hour Fitness than the one I'm going to now. He also has a four year old daughter which won't be going to school yet. So, I'm still not sure this will work out with my room mate's and my schedule. I think that's one of the hardest parts about working out; finding a good schedule. Nobody likes going to work out by themselves, but they have a hard time to schedule to go with someone else.  Today, I have been a little bit more thirsty than usual. I do get to a point of drinking too much water and have to go urinate about every fifteen to thirty minutes. I know it's important to stay as hydrated as possible and drinking a lot of water a day keeps you feeling full and you don't seem to eat as much. I used to do this a lot before, so, I don't really think it's the diurectic effects of Rev XP. I'm sure it's much better peeing a lot than not knowing if you are dehydrated or not.

       Today was suppose to be leg and shoulder day but my partner woke up late and didn't have time to go work out before he had to go to work. So, I went in by myself and just did 30 minutes of cardio workout on a bike. Tomorrow we'll go do leg day.   I'm not sure I would of been able to handle legs today anyway. Last night I spent a couple of hours after drinking some Guiness with another friend of mine and didn't get to sleep until about 5 am. I don't drink very often and I know it's not the best thing for me when I'm trying to cut a lot of fat. But, what the hell; it was only one night.  I have my spherical ab pic in my Yahoo! profile and have had a few people from a bodybuilding chat room about it. Some where just assholes and they usually don't have a pic up themselves and others kind of understood what I was doing, which is showing my progress.  A couple of people at work think they already see results in me. I'm not sure because it's so soon and measurements really haven't changed much except for about an inch and a half of my waist. I'm sure I'm slimming down; just not to the point where I think it would really be noticable. I'll still take any encouragements and compliments I can get.

       I woke up this morning with pain in my back right shoulder and neck. I didn't think I over did my workout yesterday and I usually feel the pain two day later instead of the next day. Maybe I slept on it wrong plus the fact that I worked out my back yesterday. I think I need to get a bottle of Advil or Ibuprofen.  My buddy and I went to the gym today to do a whole hour of cardio. Once he saw that I was burning more calories than him with both of us having the same heart rate, he had to pump up his heart rate because he's kind of competitive that way. We both ended up burning around 500 calories during that work out and then went out for chinese afterwards.  At the chinese resturaunt I saw someone who looked pretty much like my ex-girlfriend that I had 5 years ago except that she was much healthier looking. It makes you wonder, but I'm not going to dwell on it.  I started hanging out in a  urlLink Yahoo!  chat room on body building last night. I've been hanging out there a little today. Doesn't seem like they talk about bodybuilding too much. Seems like a place where most people try to go see other buff people on web-cams or to spam porn to people. I have had a few good conversations with young beginning bodybuilders asking for advice. I'm not sure how many would take my advice looking at my current physique, but I'll give what information I can. Hopefully, some of them will keep track of my current progress and see the results for themselves.

       I subscribe to the push-pull method for training. I do chest and triceps one day, back and biceps another day, and then legs and shoulders on a third day. In between the days I do cardio and work on my abs. I take usually just one day off a week doing nothing, sometimes two.  I used to be really skinny up until I was 27. Never weighed more than 170 pounds until then. I used the same method as above then and went up to 198 pounds. Then I moved out to California for a computer related job and sat behind a desk for about five years. I even got up to 210 pounds then and it was all fat.  Today was back and bicep day for me with a short 20 minute cardio on a bike. I'm having problems with my left arm being so much weaker than my right. If anyone knows how to get both arms about even in strength quickly, let me know.

       My friend and I went to do 45 minutes of cardio and watch some Riki Lake today at a  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness . I actually did about 30 minutes at 65% and 15 minutes at 85% of my target heart rate. I forgot exactly what my target heart rate is even though a personal trainer figured it out for me one day. I just went by what ever the machine on the bike told me for my age plus upping it a couple of numbers. I'm thinking about just doing the 85% cardio zone instead of the 65% fat burning zone just to keep up my metabolism for the rest of the day. This is something I used to preach around 10 years ago that sprinting is much better for fat burning than jogging just because of the increased metabolism for the rest of the day.  On Day One I gave overall measurements that still don't take fat into considerations. When I first starting working out a personal trainer used calipers to measure my body fat percentage. She came up with 24%. I knew it was high but didn't know it was that high. 25% body fat for men is the line on obesity. I do have some subQ fat but very little of it. My main problem is visceral adipose tissue which is that midsection fat.  A few days ago I let a  urlLink GNC  clerk talk me into trying a product called  urlLink Rev XP . It's seems to be mostly just a lot of methylxanthines ( caffiene and caffiene relatives). I'll finish the bottle and if I don't see dramatic improvements by the time I finish the bottle, I'll most likely move on to  urlLink Ab-Solved  next.  Here's some more stats that I didn't mention before. I'm 6'1", 34 years old, and started off my training at 191 pounds. I'm at 188 right now. My personal trainer said I will probably get to 180 pounds before I get back up to 190 because fat loss will occur quicker than muscle gain. I set my measurement goals in Day One with the assumption I'll be at those sizes with around 10% body fat. I'm not sure what the total weight of my measurements would come up to but I'm estimating around 210 to 215 pounds. This means I need to lose around 25 pounds of fat and gain about 45 pounds of muscle. Like I said before, this is a lofty goal and is going to take awhile, but I can do it.

       This could be Day Fourteen or Fifteen since I started working out about two weeks ago. But, I might as well start off the blog simple with Day One.  For the last 5 years I've been sitting behind a desk and my midsection got to a point where it was too spherical for me. It's 40 inches around while my chest is only 41 inches around. I'm not too happy about that.  I started thinking what would be the perfect body size for me and to do something about it. I always thought Bill Davey was a good size to be, but could only find measurements for his chest, waist, and arms. I did some more looking on the internet and found this nice  urlLink calculator  basing measurements just on wrist size. The problem is that it still doesn't show anything about the midsection. I guess if you can see a well defined six-pack it doesn't matter what size it is.  My wrist is 7 inches. I'm going to round off and adjust to where I think I want my goal to be. I want (where I'm at to where I want to be):   Chest: from 41 to 46 inches.  Waist: from 34 to 32 inches.  Hips: I'm at 39 inches and want to stay there.  Biceps: from 13 to 17 inches.  Forearms: from 11 to 13.5 inches.  Thighs: from 21 to 25 inches.  Calves: from 15 to 17 inches.  Neck: I'm at 18 inches and want to stay there.  This is a somewhat lofty goal and is going to take awhile to get there and I believe I can do it.  I'll try to keep this updated every day and talk about some of the training and supplements that I'm using 2 B Cut.
