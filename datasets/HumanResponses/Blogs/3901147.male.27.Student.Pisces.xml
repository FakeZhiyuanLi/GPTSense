      This is a set of situations from work that show just how freakin stupid and rude people truly are.  I help this guy several weeks back before I go on vacation.. the guy picks out the cheapest frame we have and puts glasses lenses in it (which like 1% of the population wear) and leaves knowing he picked out crap.&nbsp; So meanwhile I go on vacation and the guy comes in and picks them up.&nbsp; While he is in working with one of my co-workers he decides he wants a clip-on for the glasses.&nbsp; She of course orders some in for him.  I get back from vacation and end up getting him for my next patient and he tells me he is here to look at the clip-ons that were ordered in.&nbsp; I go back into the lab and get the tray I take them out to him.&nbsp; Every clip ordered in was too big or not quite the right shape at all.&nbsp; I say, "hmmm looks like she had the right shape on order and crossed it out.. no wonder they don't fit.&nbsp; There has to be a reason she did this."&nbsp; I tell him I will order the right shape in for him however the reason it was changed could be that they might not make the shape he needs in the size that he needs and that might have been why she changed it to something similar.&nbsp; I also tell him I will call him if that is what I find out.&nbsp; He leaves and I go back and call the company... sure enough that was the situation.&nbsp; I call three other companies only to find out the same thing.&nbsp; Ah yes.. keep in mind I also told him that if he wants a clip to fit exact.. we can order a custom clip made for that frame that will match exact but it has to be custom made and it costs 60 bucks non polarized and 90 bucks polarized.&nbsp; He ignores me on this saying it's too much.  So I call him back and tell him there is nothing available for that frame unless he does the custom clip... the 25 dollar over the counter clips simply don't come in the right shape and I tried all three of our clip companies.&nbsp; The asshole gets pissed and hangs up.  A week goes by and the guys wife calls and I take the call being pure luck.&nbsp; His wife proceeds to tell me that no one ever called them back.&nbsp; I proceed to tell her I called them back and talked directly to her husband not 15 minutes after he left the store last time and told him nothing was available.&nbsp; She goes on to tell me that we didn't call them again and what the hell are they supposed to do for sunglasses for him if there is no clip.&nbsp; I tell her they can have a custom clip made that is the only option.&nbsp; She says, "WE WERE TOLD A CLIP IS MADE FOR THIS FRAME THAT IS WHY WE BOUGHT IT!!"&nbsp; I say, "Well mam there isn't a clip made for it and if you want want you have to have it custom made.."&nbsp; she hangs up on me.  So five minutes afte that call the phone rings and my manager says... ok that's her again.&nbsp; Sure enough it was psycho bitch all over again... complaining about how we lied to them about the clip.&nbsp;&nbsp; The manager proceeds to tell them she may of found another kind of clip that MAY work and she will order it in and they will see what she can do.  So yesterday my manager calls in sick to work.. guess who comes in.&nbsp; Jackass comes in and says he is there to see the clips we ordered in.&nbsp; My co-worker goes back and gets them and they try them and they aren't even close to his frame.&nbsp; We tell him once more there aren't any clips for his frame.&nbsp; he says, "I WOULD HAVE NEVER ORDERD THIS FRAME HAD I KNOW THAT!!!"&nbsp; He then goes on about we lied to him and "I" told him he could get a clip and I sold him the glasses and that he wanted a clip.&nbsp; I of course am working with another patient sitting next to him and my co-worker.&nbsp; I had to chime in... "Sir we never even discussed clip-ons and you ordered these in while I was on vacation...&nbsp; none of the frames in the room you picked yours from have any kind of clip nor have we ever told anyone there is one.&nbsp; If you want a clip for it we can have a custom clip made and that is 60 dollars and polarized is 90 dollars."&nbsp; he goes on and on about how we told he there was a clip and he is gonna get a clip for it.&nbsp; We all tell him there is no clip and he says, " I want to see the manager!!"&nbsp; Well we tell him she called in sick cause her dad is in the hospital and she would be in the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fine I will be in tomorrow morning!!! this is ridiculous!!" he yells.  Today he neither called nor came in..  These type of people are the reason I hate optical.. I hate retail and I detest people in general.&nbsp; By the time I get home from work I am so turned off by people that I can stand to go anywhere.&nbsp; I will do anything that requires I don't have to go out in public and deal with more rude people.&nbsp; That is part of the reason I went back to school two years ago and picked computer information systems as a major.. work with computers!

      A patient walks in and says.. I'm here to have my lenses put into my frame.. I have a 9am appointment.&nbsp; I say, "oh yes mam... I will take these back and she can get started right away."&nbsp; The time is 8:45am...&nbsp; She says, "I am going to get my contacts from the contact area.&nbsp; I just nod and she goes on.. meanwhile I take the glasses back for the lab girl to get started on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still yet I go back out and start talking to a co-worker about the previous day and about 5 minutes go bye when the same woman walks over and plops her ass down in front of us.&nbsp; I ask if I can help her again, "Can I do something for you?"&nbsp; she says, "Yes you can bring me my glasses.."&nbsp; The girl I am working with says, "they aren't done yet mam.."&nbsp; (keep in mind only 5 minutes have gone by)&nbsp; she says, "I brought my glasses and gave them to this young man (being me) so that they could be put in , in a timely manner and I can get out of here!&nbsp; How long can it take to take lenses out of one frame and put them in another!!!&nbsp; What do you mean they aren't done!"&nbsp; I say, "Mam the lenses come in and are about 5 inches across.. they have to be traced and then cut down on the edger, sized and verified for the correct prescription, angle and defects.&nbsp; This usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.."&nbsp; she yells, "WELL!! I didn't know that!&nbsp; I guess I'll have to come back later!"&nbsp; she then stomps off and leaves.&nbsp; My coworker and I look at each other in disbelief of her rudeness.  AHHHH!!! (pulls hair out)

      Patient comes in with her young three year old son.&nbsp; "Yes, I have come to pick up my son's glasses... his name is yadda yadda."&nbsp; So I go back and look and look and I don't see the glasses in the completed area.&nbsp; I look and look and finally one of the girls find it in the (on order) side of the lab.&nbsp; The order had been placed late friday night when the labs were all closed and the labs are not open during the weekend.&nbsp; Therefore, the glasses don't get ordered till monday&nbsp;and most glasses take a week to a week and a half to come in.&nbsp; The day was Wednesday!&nbsp; I go back and and say, "Man, the glasses order was placed late friday night so they didn't get ordered till monday.. it takes at least 5 to 7 business days to get a pair back from the lab..."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her response is took look at me with the vacuous blank look and say, "The time has gone bye! I am here to pick up his glasses.."&nbsp; Mam it has only been on order for two days and the lab is in Kansas City and they just got the order next day as of yesterday.&nbsp; "The time has gone bye and I am here to pick up the glasses!!!"&nbsp; Well mam... they aren't here so you are gonna have to just come back on another day!  She I walk off and leave her sitting there and she eventually leaves...  WTF!!

      Many people that know me.. know how I feel about circumcision because of what I have gone through.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out there that say it says so in the bible... BEEEEP!&nbsp; Simply not so...   urlLink http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass2/   What people don't realize is that it was from the old testament and a LOT of things have changed from the old testament.&nbsp; Lets give a well known fact as well... the United States is the only country in the world that does male genital mutilation on a large scale basis.  Women and people in general are completely brain washed here in the United States.&nbsp; People are taught that intact men are unclean and are often made fun of and told their item is "ugly".&nbsp; Simple fact of the matter is that it is not unclean and it may have been a problem a long long time ago when hygeine was a problem; but that is simply not so these days.  Men today are also confused because they think what they have is fine.&nbsp; Which for most men they don't have any problems with their circ's; but some do.&nbsp; If men knew how much better their love making would be and feel if they were intact.. hell no they wouldn't put their children through it.&nbsp; Men just don't know any better and women are taught that it is dirty if they see a guy that isn't cut.&nbsp; All of this madness drives me to almost pure insanity sometimes because of the problems I had with my botched childhood circ.  Maybe as time goes on I'll go into more detail of what I grew up with.  Rob

      I want my friggin Jeep Liberty.&nbsp; I want it in such a bad way I would give up my left testicle (besides it's bad anyways).&nbsp; I keep pricing and talking and pricing and waiting for my miracle LOL.&nbsp; But hey, who knows when this time may come.   Well, to tell you the truth I have lots of things I want but do I necessarily need them no.&nbsp; I have however, driven a 1992 Buick LeSabre for like the last 5 years if not more.&nbsp; I have only had one true cool car and I was 16 when I had it; I am due damn it!&nbsp; I guess I'm just tired of driving my car around with the head liner floppin in the wind all while my radio crackles cause it doesn't work; the paint is chipping and it's full of 2000 door dings.&nbsp; Meanwhile the check engine light on then off then on then off as well as the anti-lock brake light and now the regular brake light dings at me.&nbsp; I mean how fricking white trashy can I get?&nbsp; All I need now are some bumper stickers and a black Def Leopard T-shirt and I have it made.   I do have the knowledge that I want too much however; and I need to get my priorities straight.. but living in this instant gratification society it's hard not to go right out and but whatever the flip I want.

      Been out of town for a couple of day... my mother has been quite sick and they don't know what is wrong with her.&nbsp; So we have spent the weekend down here to visit and keep my dad occupied.&nbsp; Funny how when you think everything is going your way then poof speedbumps always pop up out of no where.

      So today I was helping this little girl pick out glasses and her mother was helping.&nbsp; This little girl also had a younger brother that was four years old.&nbsp; As we they were trying different things on I was watching the younger brother perferom his power ranger moves on the wall and try on all the 80's motorcylce cop glasses.&nbsp; The kid would put them on look in the mirror and dance around.&nbsp; It was quite comical to see this kid in his own world.&nbsp; I kept looking at the kid and laughing internally and thinking of how fun it will be when I have my own kid being dumb like this.&nbsp; I drew my attention from the child and started helping the mom and daughter when I felt something poking me in the ass and squeezing and then poking me in the ass again.&nbsp; I look to the side and see the little boy standing next to me with his hand behind me like he was putting his around around me for a hug.&nbsp; He just kept poking and I tried to ignore the little one.&nbsp; Then I busted out and laughing and said, "What do you think you are doing!?"&nbsp; The little boy looked at me with his brown eyes and says to me, "I'm trying to give you a wedgie in your butthole."  I lost it!&nbsp; I could not stop laughing.&nbsp; The mom just looked down in disbelief but never did anything.&nbsp; I love this about children; the pure chaos that runs through their hads at any moment.&nbsp; It was classic and I will never forget that moment in my life.

      I didn't realize how much time it takes to maintain something like this.&nbsp; It's really easy to sit and type something; finding the motivation to drag yourself in to do it is another story all together.   However; in retrospect I found an interesting story on one of my favorite topics.    urlLink http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64254,00.html    Those that know me in person know how I feel about circumcision.

      Just another day at the dollar maker.. nothing too eventful today.  I was thinking of how bored I am getting recording tv shows on PVR and watching them.  I may actually have to bust out my PS2 and start playing some games I have.  I guess I haven't completely given up video games; just online games.  I probably wouldn't have done that but the main game I play didn't work on my computer after I fixed it's major death spell.  So rather than pay for it I cancelled my subscription.  I woudl love to play it but that would require me reformatting my hard drive and backing all my saved stuff up to try and fix it.  You know what.. I'm too lazy and I guess I wasn't that obsessed with playing that game after all hahaha.  I'm waiting for a couple of beta test cd's to arrive for me to test some up and coming games for the public.. sometimes I sit and think about how much fun it will be and almost start drooling.  Then again sometimes I sit here and wonder why I would waste my time.  Ahh well.  The wiff and I are in desperate need of groceries, but we can't seem to drag ourselves to go.  Both of us get home and are too tired or get busy watching some dumb tv show to drag ourselves there.  We have got to get our motivation back soon!  Rob

      This will also be my last post of the evening as it's getting late, and tomorrow is my first day back to work since I went on vacaction July 3rd.  Should be a fun time helping all the people that don't properly take care of their glasses; you know the ones with frame cheese that grey and greenish goo that gets trapped amongst the nosepads that us opticians get to clean out day in and day out.  How people can wear their glasses for hours on end with this crap just millimeters from their eyes I will never know.  Anywho, off to bed again to see what tomorrow brings... if anything maybe the new Jeep Liberty CRD I've been waiting for will be released!!!  This has been a small obsession of mine for quite some time.  I almost bought a jeep about a week ago just before vacation.  I have the perfect little badboy all setup, picked out and actually had a weekend test drive with it.  However, the dipstick of a salesman tried to pull a fast one on us and we dropped the whole thing like one of the kids at the pool.  We've decided to wait a couple of months to pay off a little more debt and see what the 05's have to bring.  Rob

      Ugggghhhhh...  I don't know what happened, but during Spidey I started to get a headache.  Throughout the day that headache started to get worse and worse.  Then at around 6pm after I ate with Betsy; I literally thought I was going to barf and had a fever.  However, after napping I have woken up and poof all better.

      I just went and saw Spidey 2 this afternoon also giving myself time to reflect on what is important to me.  I have come to the realization that having no friends gives me a unique perspective on things.  Sure I have friends that are family but those are different.  I don't have anyone that I confide in other than my best friend that is my wife.  You know, play video games with *that I gave up* talk about what's going on with your woman.  Someone to shoot the breeze with and talk about mowing the yard.  Not having anyone to talk to gives me the unique ability to listen to others.  I have this strange knack for dragging the mundane craziness out of almost any stranger without even asking.  I go to get my hair cut, and the guy just goes on and on about his girlfriend of three years and how they just put her on birth control and of course it caused her to have a breakdown.  He proceeds to tell me all the details of it and I am thinking, "Omigosh I am trapped in this chair and this guy has scissors!"  I have so many examples I may use this site to someone drudge up a few of the more memorable ones I have had the pleasure to experience over the years.  Anyways I'm going to work on some laundry before this wiff comes home and take something for this rockin headache.  Rob

      Thought I would create my own site for the pure sake of nothing else to do since I gave up video games completely about three months ago.  Or was it longer?  I'll use this site to post up some everyday pics of what goes on in the life of the "Littles."  After mowing the yard in the heat of midmorning I thought I would take a break and prepare to go watch Spidey 2.  Nothing like going to watch a movie by yourself when everyone else is out working.  I'll post a small pic of Betsy and I starting our vacation in St. Louis on July 2nd at the Double Tree hotel.  I must say these damned cookies are positively sinful!  Best cookie I have had in my life hands down!  Hmmmm considering I know nill about html as I find it boring I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to add a picture to the post.  This should be a fun afternoon.  Rob

      Oh btw.. here is something funny. On my way back I was driving extra slow to be careful of critters and stuff. So I get to the last street that my house is on and stop at the stop sign. I go around the corner and I see a car coming out of the apartments there and it is like 200 yards away.. pretty far away. As I am driving those last couple hundred feet home they flip their lights on and chase me down and I pull over in the apartment driveway.  "Sir you failed to stop at that stop sign!?" the guy says.  I said, "Ummm I have lived here three years and you guys always watch that spot.. I have NEVER failed to stop at that sign and I swear to GOD that I didn't run it. Sir you did not stop at the sign I need to license and registration. So I give it and he goes to his car .. then I hear a knock on the passenger window.. CLICK CLICK sir roll down the window! Ummm they thought I was out burglarizing on top of that because of my digital camera in shambles in the seat next to me. They searched my car and everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So the guy has his radio on and I hear them calling my name in.. in code... Roger Omega Brenda Ernie Roger Tango, Daniel, Asshole, Licker, Egotist.. sorry I got a bit carried away there but it made me made. So as I am sitting there listening to them call my name in I start to laugh. The other officer is like "SIR IS SOMETHING FUNNY!" "DO YOU FIND THIS FUNNY!" "TELL ME WHAT IS SO FUNNY!"  I was like WTF!! So I said it's just that.. then I decided to shut up and not say anything about my uncle Pat teaching me as a kid to listen to radio talk and what the codes mean and I thought that it was funny and afraid they would think I was trying to get out of a ticket by saying my uncle was a cop. So I shut up.  So I am sitting there trying to keep from laughing. . . cause you and I both know how funny it is to get pulled over for no reason.. harassed by the cops and sit and wonder if they are going to give you ticket just to be assholes when you are completely not guilty and they are abusing their power to feed their shortcomings elsewhere.  Anyways I am sitting there and the cell rings and my wife is wondering if I am ok of course... I answer and she says, "Are you O..." they cop yells, "NO CELL PHONE USE!!" and makes me slam it shut on my wife.  I said that she is just seeing if I am ok and he says again no cell phone use while being pulled over.  So of course my wife calls back and I pick up the phone and hand it to him and tell him to tell her.  He says no cell phone use again... and I slam the phone down.  GRRRRR!  The guy continues to make small talk asking about how fast the car is and the fastest I have ever had it up to and whatever like I am going to self incriminate!!?  They gave me my stuff back and told me to watch the sign. I was so infuriated! GRRRRRRRRRRR  Rob

      I have to be at the Urologist at 7:45am. I get to give blood, whack off in a cup and get my balls felt up and my rear fingered. You can't ask for a better way to start your morning! *cringes*  No really, I am having a consultation about a testicular cyst removal via surgery. As well as talk about a few other things that are a result of my infant mutilation I mean childhood circumcision. Wish me luck and I hope you all have me in your prayers.  Rob

      Ok I just got an email from Champion Jeep in Independance MO.  Jeep Liberty Limited 4x4 with Wheel Pkg and the Sun Roof.  They say 23k for it.. I say go for it! ! That's way less than Heritage in Ozark or anywhere else I have seen around.  The trick now is talking my wife into letting me have it before they sell the damned thing.  ARGH I could scream and run down the street streaking.  Rob

      Ok my air conditioner doesn't work; the radio doesn't work.  My headliner is falling the paint is cracking the brakes are doing weird things.  The check engine light keeps coming on and I have a weird rattle and the thing acts like it is going to die when it idles.  I just dumped 200 bucks into some brake stuff and it still acts weird.  After picking up my vehicle tonight and driving my wife home in it so she could experience what I feel everyday..  I almost started to cry.  She is bound and determined not to let me have my Jeep until  I get out of school 10 years from now when gas vehicles won't exist.  BAH!!  I'm sick of feeling like white trash as my headliner in my car flops around in the wind as a drive to and from work!  Rob

      I was thinking the other day while I was walking through the fair.  I should set up an anti-circumcision booth at the fair.  You have to admit... if it were presented to men like this.  How would you like your sex life and sensitivity to be 100 times better than you have now!?  Too late for you; but you can help your boys.  Don't circumcise.  Most of us don't know what we are missing so that is fine and dandy... however, if you are disatisfied with what you do have.. try searching for Foreskin Restoration on the internet.  Many good sites out there and I started it a couple years ago.  It helps!  Though it is no true replacement for what we lost it will do and is better than nothing.  Rob

      I have an appointment with the Urologist next Tuesday at like 2pm.. to have a cyst on my left testicle looked at and a possible surgery consultation.  I am none to pleased about this turn of events (sighs).  I also have to give a sperm sample to check and see if my boys are making swimmers properly since we are thinking of having kids in the near future.  Plus I get to continue my discussion with a new urologist about my delayed ejaculatory response.  Let me put it like this...  I can't have orgasms very easily if at all.  Oye TMI!   However, I really have nothing to hide.  Rob

      Went to the fair the other night... and I must say that the Ozark empire fair is one of the dorkiest things to do while in Missouri.  They have the exact same things every year in the exact same places.  It would be fun to take children to; but that is about it.  Something about walking around with bugs, strange people in wife beaters will beer bellies and the smell of livestock  all mixed into temperatures of about 95 degrees and no breeze!!!!  Things good about the fair though:  -  Philly Cheesesteak Sanwich *this thing was good even though we aren't in Philly  -  It makes my wife happy so I grin an bear it  Bad things about the fair:  -  Lots of large, smelly wierd people with no manners  -  Farm animals all around with farm poo and yummy farm smells  -  5 bucks for the Philly sandwich!!  No drink no extras!  -  Carnies... yes there are carnies  -  Crafts made by the public that should truly be kept to country stores that no one ever visits  Oh my there is a lot more to the list but I could dedicate an entire blog to fair idiosyncricies.  LOL!!  I walked by this one game and this guy says to me... Come throw the ball and win your woman a prize.  When I ignored him he continued to tell me how I wasn't man enough.  I turned and said in front of our group out to the man,  " It's ok I'm hung like Mr. Ed she will forgive me."
