      Winnion has arrived safely in India and is actually enjoying herself quite a lot. I am writing this from an internet cafe which is just dandy. Today is my fourth day her and I still have another six to go. We have bought all the sarees and given them to tailors to make my costumes. We have also been to some printers and had a meeting with a designer to design some invitation cards. Now that all the work is done we can just wander aimlessly around shopping centres and sit in our hotel room and watch terrible repeats of really bad programmes. I do love it so though. Overall I am having a much better time than I had anticipated but I can't wait to get back home. I didn't bring my digital camera with me so I will put up some pictures once they are developed. Luv, Winnie

      Look what I just bought. Oh the lovelies!     I am leaving for India in one hour but I felt the need to share my feelings of utmost joy at my purchase. I really want to say a huge thank-you to Farha who inspired me and also told me where to get them. Of course I would also like to thank my mum for taking me to buy them about one and a half hours before leaving to go on holiday. Bye bye all you beautiful people.   ~Winnion~

      Tomorrow I am leaving to begin myexplorations in India which of course I am much excited about. I therefore feel that it is my duty to leave you with a thought that will keep your minds entirely satisfied until my return when they will be hungry for more. Here goes:     "The building is sending you a warning.      Go home!      Tis not safe to be wandering the streets at this late hour.      A storm is a-brewing.      Go home and take Courtney with you.      The building is sending you a warning!     GOL!!!!!!!!!!"        &nbsp;   I understand that you are now probably too moved to speak and fully appreciate what a big deal my going away is so that you cannot have a daily helping of absolute nonsense. At this point, to avoid being taken to court, I feel the necessity to point out that the above quotation was in fact a shared creation between me and my good friend Eleanor Higgins. She must not go unnoticed. Ever.   On my return I will try and write as soon as possible. I am also working on a page about one of my very good friends On-Yee Wong so if anyone has any facts about her please e-mail them to me at   urlLink  bromwin_huddersfield@yahoo.co.uk    I will be most grateful.   Lots and lots and lots of love   The one and only Winnion

      I got back from Canterbury yesterday after a week's trip. it was very enjoyable. We sang Evensong every day and did the Sunday morning service. Add in lots of three hour rehearsals and you have a recipe for fun!  i was most honoured to share a room with Ellie and it was kept very tidy for the whole week. *cough cogh* Overall it was an extremely enjoyable trip as we were allowed to go anwhere we wanted entirely by ourselves for hours on end. yay for Mrs Jewell. The only thing that disenhanced the trip was Gail. Don't want to talk about it.

      Really, what is the point of them? You know you're going to the dentist so the day before you brush your teeth like hell so they don't actually see your teeth like they normally are so the whole thing is completely pointless. Add having to get up for an appointment at 8 am and I am not feeling particularly kindly towards them.

      Yesterday I had the 'immense privelege' of visiting the National Theatre with Mr Campbell, Mr Hargraves and some of the cast of 'The Musicians'. Here are two attractive young ladies who accompanied us:           There was some very interesting music being played and some equally interesting dancers! (couldn't get a pic) The actual performances were alright ( Bedbug: The Musical  and  The Musicians ) but of coursenowhere near as good as the performance of Old Palace School of John Whitgift! I have one last very important question to ask.    A haaandbag?

             My room isn't normally like that. I decided I was going to do this major cleanup but then I got bored halfway. I'm meant to be tidying up my room now but it's just so boring. I really need to do it but it takes so much effort not to fall asleep in the process.

      Hello everybody. So. This is the beginning of a new era. A wonderful era. An era when goats rule the world. Well, maybe not. However goats are very cool creatures. All I really want to say is hello and thank-you for bothering to look at this. Summer holidays are very cool!
