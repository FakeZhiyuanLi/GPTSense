      	Like many people born in the late 1970s, I grew up watching  Superman .  I suppose a lot of people born before me grew up watching it too, but at a certain age, a person can think about a film and question it.  When you're five and you're watching  Superman  on video, it's about the magic, not about the questions. 	So, twenty-one years later, I sat down and watched  Superman  again.  I was excited before we started it because the last two times I saw the film was on its DVD release, which only features Richard Donner's inferior 2002 "Director's Cut."  This director's cut, which isn't a subject worth too much discussion, invalidates the point of  Superman . 	And what is the point of  Superman ?  It's a film cut in half, prepared as the lead in for a sequel by the Salkinds--though I remember  The Three Musketeers  wasn't even coherent if watched alone.  Watching the film tonight, I paid a great deal f attention to the film's structure, the way scenes and storytelling were constructed.   Superman  is about the growth of the human heart.  It's about growing up.  When Superman's father (you know, Marlon Brando) says "The son becomes the father, and the father the son," it's not about him.  It's about Glenn Ford.  It's about Superman becoming a human being. 	Brando sent Superman to earth to become its leader.  Not in a bad way, but he doesn't expect Superman to really assimilate to the culture.  The structure of the film reveals its purpose--Lex Luthor's early shenanigans show the negative sides to humanity, the much-maligned Lois Lane narration gives the film one of its most beautiful moments--she's humanity, waiting for Superman.  But Superman is Clark Kent . . . and Clark Kent has been waiting for humanity to welcome him since childhood.  Always on the outside, he slowly becomes acceptable as eccentric (or goofy, whatever) by the Daily Planet's staff.  Superman, the alien, brings Clark Kent into the human fold.  At the end, Superman is "part of the . . . team."  This membership directly contradicts Brando's predications at the film's start. 	The second film takes away Superman's humanity--the point of that film is that Superman never, ever gets to live a human life.  I'm not sure this change in direction was intention, as I don't think its makers would look at  Superman  in the context I outlined above.  Once you decide (or realize) a film's excellence, the next step is to properly identify its excellence.  I smile like a child when Superman catches Lois Lane and the helicopter.  I feel sick watching Lois buried alive.  There's no doubt it's an effective film.  It's also a film with enormous plot holes and things that just don't make any sense--the "turning back the earth," for example.  But none of these points speed-bump the film, which is extraordinary. 	I didn't sit down and watch  Superman  tonight determined to develop a reasoning for its excellence.  Mostly, I just sat down to watch it absent of all the muck added in for the DVD release for the first time in years (how come laserdisc is even cooler now than it was when they still pressed discs?).  But the story structure intrigued me and I started thinking about it.  The film is not so much about Superman's internal conflict.  It's about his growth to have internal conflicts.  If Superman was human the whole time, then he would have been able to save Glenn Ford. 	Of course, being human isn't always that great. 	At one point, Clark tells his boss he can't understand violence at any level, but then he tosses Lex Luthor around his hide-out.  Why?  Because Lex really, really pissed him off and Lex got tossed around for it.  In the film's context, that's something human. 	I just finished saving my copy of  Superman .  It's so big it'd take up two data DVDs (I made it computer-playable only since I have my Mac plugged into my TV).  It's a different film than the director's cut, which isn't bad at all--but it's not this film.  This film is wonderful.  It's the human heart's journey from infancy to adulthood, told in a story-telling style that only film can accomplish.  It's just great. 	And it'll be even better next time.

      	I read about this film, a "TV-movie" from 1983, in Leonard Maltin's omnipresent  Movie and Video Guide .  I once went through the book, probably the 1995 edition, to pick out films to watch.  I don't know how I ever got to "P," but I did.  (While Maltin's opinion on films from about 1972 through the present is questionable, this book is an excellent resource for older films.  Not as excellent as, you know, the Internet, but if anyone out there really likes having a 1,637-page paperback adorning their shelf.  Something besides  Infinite Jest ). 	On to  Prototype .  It's 91 minutes and it's definitely a TV-movie, from the directing to the story structure.  However, for a film about the world's first android, it has no special effects sequences--no demonstrations of android-might, no futuristic laboratories or even explosions.  It doesn't even have a car chase. 	Instead, it has characters.  Characters with complex relationships, ones that start before the film begins and ones that last after it's ended.   Prototype , in its 91 minutes and with its paltry budget, has more to say about human beings than current cinema.  To be fair, I haven't regularly gone to the cinema since 2002.  Something about  The Mothman Prophecies  made me never want to see another new film again . . . and I didn't even make it 10 minutes into that one. 	A lot of this film's success is in its cast: I initially wanted to see it because of Christopher Plummer, but it also stars a young, thin David Morse and Frances Sternhagen.  Plummer is  Prototype 's Dr. Frankenstein and Morse is his creature.  But this creature, as Morse discovers, is not a Frankenstein.  It doesn't have that potential.  As Plummer and Morse go on the lam, the film explores Plummer's life--with his coworkers and his wife, over thirty-odd years, all in the span of a few weeks.  No flashbacks, no lengthy exposition.  Just honest scenes. 	Most reviews I read today complain about the use of conversation to reveal character.  Most modern films that use flashback--something like  The Royal Tenenbaums  is an exception--shouldn't.  Like theater, film has actors.  Actors, as the word suggests, act.  If a person has a traumatic event, revealing that event to another person is a situation ripe with dramatic impact. 	 Prototype  is a beautiful film.  It's got pedestrian direction and cinematography--but there are beautiful relationships and moments in which people interact.  The core to any piece is the people and their relationships with each other, everything else is the window-dressing.  A TV-movie doesn't have much possibility for window-dressing (though I suppose modern ones look like music videos or something), so it's got to have a rock-solid core.  This core cannot be independent of quality, of course, as a piece can have a good core and poor window-dressing. My writing professor used a hanger as his metaphor.  You hang all the accruements on the hanger, the explosions and the car chases.  (He'd probably shit if he knew I was bastardizing his metaphor for film). 	 Prototype  has a cast-iron hanger.

            Everyone should read Flannery O'Connor.    I'm an authority:    I've read four of her stories.      The first person to recommend her to me was Kurt Vonnegut.  Not personally, of course, but in his introduction to  Bamboo Snuff Box , a collection of his short stories I picked up for $5 on remainder at Barnes and Nobles. Nice hardcover edition. He called O'Connor the best writer of his generation (or something to that effect). I read one of her stories for a writing class, talked stupidly about it in that class, and coveted the nice collection of all her short stories every time I saw a copy at a bookstore. Finally, a few months ago, I bought a copy at a used book store (a Powells for all of you who care).    I read the first story in the book that night, "The Geranium."  It's excellent.    Then I put the book aside to read a novel.  Then I misplaced the book. I found it yesterday and set about to start reading it again. Reading short stories is an excellent way to get the mind going, in addition to passing the time if you've eaten too much Chinese food or some particularly good Mexican food. But it's difficult to learn to concentrate on short stories if you've fallen out of practice of reading them. I can read one, of course, without any trouble. I can't just sit and read story after story. I need time to digest them. I finished "The Crop" around noon today and only know can I think of anything to say about it besides "it's good." "The Crop" is not the strongest O'Connor story I've read (and, like I said, I'm an authority--I've read four). However, she makes some important observations about writers in this story and everyone should be aware of them. O'Connor isn't the first person to have these observations, but she does insert them into a narrative. This story is one of the first steps a beginning writer ought to take in learning how to think about the craft. I've had two fiction writing professors. The second, the one I mentioned above, is excellent. The first was garbage (he gave me an A, however). Here's why: When I took that first class, I'd just read something Hal Hartley said about how people should make films about what they know--not about guns. This first writing professor said no. He said there's nothing interesting in just writing about what a person knows first-hand. I was a little more ignorant then. Today, I know the correct answer--a fiction writer doesn't write about bank robberies and submachine guns and jetboats. A fiction writer writes about people. These are people who go to the bank and find a twenty dollar bill in the cash machine. These are people who rob that bank. There's no difference between the two. That first writing professor never said that. He never said anything intelligent about writing, never stimulated me to write. In fact, when I wrote what I thought was garbage (and it was bad), he loved it. "The Crop" is about the difference between the bank robber and the lucky person. I frequently frustrate myself by reading people's half-assed opinions on literature and film. The Internet is awash with people who have (somewhat) public forums to spout ignorant opinions. Most of them don't even know not to write "I think" in these critiques. Would reading "The Crop" suddenly make everyone know a little more about literature, suddenly make these reviews I pass my time reading a little better? Actually, it would. And, given what I've been reading lately, if these reviews got 0.0015% better, I'd have a little faith in my fellows again. It's not like you have to go buy "The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor" or anything. I mean, libraries do carry it. It is requisite.

           When I read about Fay Wray's death yesterday, I read the New York Times obituary. IMDB had yet to be updated with the news and, as they did not post any obituary for Jeanne Crain, I wondered if they would for Fay Wray. Since yesterday, they have posted one and, like all the others, it concentrates most of its attention on her role in   King Kong  .  It goes so far as to say   "her career fell into decline following"   Kong  . Now, that statement is a false one. It's smelly bullshit, in fact, and it's an example of what is disappointing me so much about the way people today look at film.        (If you haven't figured it out, this post is not much of an obituary. All the pertinent information about Fay Wray has been posted by widely read sources, I recommend  urlLink the New York Times ).        Most online sources credit   The Wedding March   (1928) as Fay Wray's breakthrough.  Her initial career ended in 1942 with   Not a Ladies Man  , when she stopped to concentrate on her marriage to writer Robert Riskin (  Mr. Deeds Goes to Town  ).  She appeared in fifty-seven films in between these two films, having starring roles in all but two:   Paramount on Parade   (1930), a "studio" musical guest-starring many of Paramount's contract players, and   It Happened in Hollywood   (1937), in what appears to be a cameo appearance.  If  Kong  killed Fay Wray's career    , no one seemed to notice at time.  She made ten films in 1933, the same year as   Kong  , and nine the following year. She only made five in 1935 and three in 1936. Until 1941, she appeared in one or two films a year. I've never read a biography of Fay Wray so I don't really know what I'm talking about (but I at least looked at these figures, which is more than imdb's writers seemed to do), but it looks like she got a little bump because of   Kong  --the bump just didn't last.       Or maybe she didn't want to make so many films every year.       Now, if you want to go out and rent a bunch of Fay Wray films on Digital Versatile Disc, well, you're in trouble. Warner Bros. has been fiddling with   King Kong   for five years now with no release date in sight. DVD message board commentators assume it will be released with Peter Jackson's remake next year.   The Most Dangerous Game   (1932), filmed on the same jungle sets as   Kong  , has been out for years and is certainly worth a look.    The Mystery of the Wax Museum   (1933) is on the flip-side of the   House of Wax   DVD.    Adam Had Three Sons   (1941) is available and so are two films from her second, supporting actress career in the 1950s:   Queen Bee   (1955) and   Crime of Passion   (1957). Netflix, which I use and recommend for its extensive catalogue and price, carries these films--if you look by title. Fay Wray doesn't make their requirements for a decent "by actor" search. That's it for DVD. Five titles. Of seventy-nine.       Turner Classic Movies is the superior source for Fay Wray films. Anyone who says he or she is interested film but isn't addicted to TCM, well, I'm not sure what he or she is interested in--but it isn't film. It's the finest, readily available source. I know TCM has broadcast, at least,   Doctor X   (1932),   One Sunday Afternoon  (1933),  Small Town Girl   (1953), and   The Cobweb   (1955).  They have five other Fay Wray films in their library.  The Fox Movie Channel has one I know of,   The Affairs of Cellini   (1935).          Yesterday, I found myself hoping TCM would broadcast a career retrospective, playing some of the otherwise unavailable films, then got queasy at what a ghoulish hope I had made. If someone has to die (to be fair, Fay Wray was 96 and, from all accounts, had a full life) so we can see his or her films, something is wrong. No library exists for films. I saw a terrible bootleg copy of   Dirigible  (1931). Most films, not just ones starring Fay Wray, in the Columbia and Paramount libraries are not available and these companies are making no strides toward remedying the situation. While working at a video store, I met sales representatives from two video companies, Universal and Paramount. The Paramount representative understood films should be presented in the best possible version for DVD. The Universal representative had no interest in respectful presentation. I can't particularly fault her, since she was only further evidence of that company as a heinous offender to film history (I knew her around the time Universal released  Jaws   on DVD with the new sound effects--but before they wanted to release only the new edition of   E.T.  ).       TCM does play   King Kong   often, of course.  Usually once every two months.   King Kong   is a great film, but as evidence of Fay Wray as anything but a "scream queen," it's decidedly lacking. The opening scene in New York, when Robert Armstrong takes her to dinner, shows a little of Fay Wray's acting ability. The scenes with Bruce Cabot on the ship, the scene with the monkey. This woman was a fine actor and no one's giving her the due respect for it.   The Most Dangerous Game   is the best example, of her films that I have seen, of her acting. From the list over at allmovie, I can tell there are some better examples. But I can't see those.   	    The New York Times obituary mentions that she turned down the opportunity to cameo in the 1976   King Kong   because she was satisfied with the original.  In the 1990s, before   The Lord of the Rings  , when Peter Jackson first planned his   King Kong   remake, he wanted Fay Wray to deliver the "it was beauty who killed the beast" line at the end. She declined. Now, Jackson is preparing the film again, with Naomi Watts starring in the Fay Wray role--sort of. Fay Wray played an actress out of work because of the Depression. Watts' Ann Darrow will be an archeologist. Jackson felt the film needed to be remade because children can't watch it the original--it's black and white and the special effects are bad.       Peter Jackson is, obviously, an idiot.       Those people are raising their children with an inablility to watch black and white films without CG special effects are idiots too. Their children will probably be idiots too, but it's not really their fault.       There's nothing wrong with   King Kong  's special effects. They convinced the people who flocked to Radio City Music Hall to see it in 1933. Those people in 1933 were smarter than the people today . . . or, at least, they had larger vocabularies than people today and knew something about art. The GI Bill made college more accessible but also took a lot of pressure off high schools to properly educate their students.       But Peter Jackson isn't from the United States.  He didn't go through our public education system--something else caused his stupidity.    	    By the time his   Kong   is released, most people will have forgotten that Fay Wray died. of course, most people don't even know now that she lived at all.  Or that she contributed something to film, that she helped further the examination of the human condition. So they won't blink when he dedicates his film to her memory. The film he "had" to make because her's was not good enough anymore: it's gross--it's black and white. Whatever its faults, the 1976   King Kong   never bastardized the original film.         Now, if I tried to do something, if I started a petition to get Fay Wray's Columbia films on DVD, I could get 100,000 signatures and Columbia would do nothing (they're currently the worst DVD producer, still releasing Pan and Scan titles--even of niche titles). But I'm not sure 100,000 people care about her films. In fact, I don't think 100,000 people care about film. Less care about literature.        So, maybe I'm the one who's wrong. Maybe everything should be colorized. Maybe everything should be remade. Maybe Fay Wray isn't good enough for people today.        But I'm not wrong and it's the other way around.     People today aren't good enough for Fay Wray,  King Kong , or most anything else.     After all, almost half of them voted for George W. Bush.

       Well, I abandoned jablog.com.   This infidelity--well, wait, I was unfaithful when I started looking into blogger--so I guess I left jablog.com. It's not a bad place to have a blog. I have no problems with it.   It just doesn't integrate with my fine MacJournal software, which I sort of need to allow me to work on a post over extended periods of time. I haven't posted there in a month--mostly because I spend most of my blogging time writing comic book reviews for  urlLink Paperback Reader .   The format, which started as straight, 500-word reviews of comic books and films then became progressively looser, is now gone. I'll just be ranting and raving--my first real post will be a look at Fay Wray's career, why I've only seen four of her films, and what's wrong with that--with some recommendations (both film and literature).    So, without further ado, get going.    But come back.
