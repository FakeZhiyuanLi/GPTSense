       I give you, my mighty reader, LUKE WARM - the babble of a delusional, lest we forget insane, man/slacker! Now I’m sure most of you are currently applauding with great adulation and shouting aloud, “Hooray! I’ve always wanted to read self-serving, hypocritical drivel!” For this I thank you ahead of time, as I am master at driveling (it is inherited).  So what can you expect from me? Amazingly enough...nothing! I could go into detail the long hours I pondered on writing my own column, loosely termed, until I was distracted by a shiny spoon (I have eight…I counted). The spoons soon lost their luster, as do many things that fail to project flashy images in my face at break-neck speeds, and I realized that I have so much to give to the world. As to what, I’m at a loss.  My hope is that you, my dear reader, will learn something from this mess of words - that you will take example from my life experiences and act in a completely different manner. This is not for your sake, mind you. I just don’t want anyone cramping my style (patent-pending).  --Krispy out

       It was last week that I lost a dear member of my family. Yes, I waved a tearful goodbye to my beloved spectacles. One moment you’re showing off your eyewear to fellow co-workers, cleaning them lovingly with a polyester cloth made in Taiwan…the next thing you know, there is a lifeless corpse resting in your palms. It was a tragic case of acute rimsatic-breakadontis. Who could have guessed they had a weak bridge. It’s not fair!  Oh sure, I tried to resuscitate them at the local jewelry doctor, sparing no expense (fifteen dollars). There was a shining glimmer of hope that my prescriptive companions would pull through, but in the end their weld wasn’t strong enough. It was saddest ten seconds of my life.  How does one move forward after such a devastating experience? My glasses completed me - turning an otherwise normal joe schmoe into a joe schmoe with glasses. What’s even worse is, in a moment of weakness, I fell back into the arms of the ex-glasses. They aren’t even attractive. They mean nothing to me anymore. Sure, they have large lenses…but large lenses don’t necessarily make them right for me! Then again, I’ve always been a nose-piece kind of guy.  Deep down I think I’m afraid I’ll never meet a pair like that again. Who knows though, right? I did have my first eye exam in several years. It went okay, but I was so nervous. The chemistry just wasn’t there.  Not like it was with my…glasses.

         You're a Speak & Spell!! You nerd, you. Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard.   urlLink  What childhood toy from the 80s are you?     -----    "L-I-M-P. Now say it."       Speak &amp; Spell was great. You could make it say naughty things like:      "U-R-P."      Sure, your options were limited. But you were a kid and you didn't need much. I miss those days. Now, as an adult, when I flop down on the floor and throw a temper tantrum, Mandy hits me with bat.

       Okay. People keep telling me I need to post on my blog, as I haven't done so in over a year. And I tell them, "Hey, voices in my head...I'll get to it when I get to it". That seems to shut them up.      So here it is. A new post.      Ta-da!
