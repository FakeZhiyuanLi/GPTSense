        With today's technology, we should be able to acheive fantastic gas mielalge, doing wonders for the fight to preserve the environment. However, if people burnt less fuel to get where they were going, one thing would happen: consumers would spend less money on gas. This would in no way hinder the economy, as people would spend their money elsewhere. It would, however, decrease the amount of tax money the government would receive, as gas is taxed by the litre. This is the only reason that no legislation has been introduced forcing car companies to lower emissions and increase fuel efficiency. It is appalling to think that suburbanites everywhere burn incredible amounts of gas while driving their SUV's, when these gas-guzzling beasts are not really necessary. I family sized car, such as a Taurus (which doesn't get great mileage, but it's good in comparison with an SUV) has hample trunk space for soccer balls, jerseys, groceries or whatever else one may need to carry, other than large items, which do not fit in an SUV anyway, but would require a van or truck. It is society's incredible lust for new and spectacular that lead to the grotesque amount of waste that North Americans produce.  I hope they suffocate in their exhaust and drown in their plastic shopping bags and styrofoam packaging

      As I lay here with the lights off, I feel a small amount of familiarity. I lay here on the bed, where we've had so many late night conversations about everything we never thought we could share with anyone, and I feel a little bit at home. I wrap myself in your bed sheets, hoping that maybe - just maybe - I'll reach out and find you laying next to me, but I only find emptiness in the darkness. The sheets are usually warm, heated by your body, but now I feel them cool against my chest, scratching in an awkard way that I have never noticed before. Thoughts fill my head about all the things we've done. In the darkness, I know I am surrounded by pictures of you, us and of myself. I can feel them near me, and as my eyes adjust to the dark, I can see vague outlines of us in days past, days that we will never see again. I still believe that we are out there somewhere, still living those days, and that moments never cease to exist, but we merely move through time, as though it were a big bowl of fluid or strawberry gelatin. I ponder these and many other non-important thing. All while lying alone in your bedsheets.

      I missed mass last night. I thought it was at 6:30. Apparently, it was at 5:30. It matters not. I still went down to the tracks with them. Rhonda was hoping to see Allison's mom there, because she's actually speaking out now, trying to educate people about the dangers of railroad tracks. After, we went into Dairy Queen. It was fun just to hang out with those guys. I miss Jason and Clayton. They're fun guys. Clayton is working at Boston Pizza still. Jason is in college. Who's have thought he'd be the first one there? Actually, it makes sense, because he's really the only one who knows exactly what he wants to do. I got my Kiros pics back today. They should be in the SHOW REVIEWS section of my page later today. Go check right now to see!!! Afterwards, I went back to Crystals. It was a good night. Sometimes I like nights like that, too.   urlLink  postCount('2002november2');

      Don't ever have sex with a strange woman. She will stalk you. She will date your friend. Then kill him. She will bring flowers to your mom. She will sabatoge your job. She will sabatoge your chances to getting onto a first rate sports team. She will steal your car and try to kill your girlfriend with it. Don't ever have sex with a strange woman.  For those of you who are wondering, I went to see the movie "Swimfan" last night. The movie has a good plot, everything ties together nicely at the end, but there are some really cheesy lines and the acting is only mediocre. Other than that it's a good movie.   Last night was Halloween. Crystal and I did nothing special. It is one of my favorite holidays, but nothing interesting ever happens on it. Just stupid haunted houses. I want to be the kind of guy who builds a sweet haunted house in his garage every year. Tonight. I am going to church. I am wearing a tie.

      I don't have much to say, so I'm posting for the hell of posting. Thursday was my 18th birthday. Ate supper at Earls, went to see "The Ring", went back to Crystals. Crystal gave me a bottle of Cherry Whiskey. MMMmmmMMM. Yesterday, went to Calgary, bought some sweet shoes. I'll put a picture of them up here later. Got stranded in the snow, Crystal missed work today. Now I'm waiting for her call. No comments on this one. If you have something to say, comment on the last post.

      I love Crystal. She wanted me to write more about her, so I will. Her sense of style if perfect. She has great style. Her music tastes...they're great. Although I hate to admit it, I like almost exactly the same music she does. Well, actually, I like almost everything, which is probably why I like the same as her. But a lot of stuff she listens to are my favorites. Her laugh. The sound of it, the way it feels when I have my head on her chest or belly. It vibrates my head funny. I love it. The way she kisses. Soft, slow, then all of a sudden right there. Tingles in my stomach. The way the things I don't like about her make me like her more. Late nights. Early mornings. Sleeping in. Watching TV. Going out. These are just a few of the things I love about her.  urlLink  postCount('loveabouther');

      That band that elise lent you the cds, i wanted to download stuff by them, but i couldn't remember their name. Then I was downloading stuff by bright eyes, cuz he's the most amazing artist of all time, and i found a few songs, so i did the little "search for more from same user" thing, and the user had a whole bunch of stuff by Tegan and Sara, too. It was like fate or something!   urlLink  postCount('kazaafate');

      My webpage does not work on Crystals computer. I believe it is something to do with the style sheet, however, I've looked through the code time and time again. (actually, twice). I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. If it is broken on her computer, it must be broken on other computers. Being the web-design perfectionist I am, I must completely redo my page. Another 15 hours of work in front of my computer awaits! A new concept, a new look. Perhaps I'll design it with my domain in mind, because that is my next "me" purchase. A domain name.   urlLink  postCount('nov42002');

      You’ve been worrying about your faith for quite some time. I know you have, I’ve been watching. You no longer see the point. No reason to get caught up in religion and the such. There’s no room for individualism there. They don’t like revolution. Sit. Kneel. Obey. You don’t like the idea of it all. I know you still believe in God. I know you still feel guilty in the middle of the night, while laying there awake, looking back on all the thing you’ve done. I know you still believe enough not to say there is no God. You know there is a God. However, religion, like all things, is man-made. This is what you believe, isn’t it? And so, if it’s man-made, how can it be perfect? How can it be true?  Once, you were so strong there. So much passion. So much love. Now what have you got? So much hate. So much rage. Apathy. Lethargy. All of that. And more. Or less. You hate organized religion. I know you do; I can feel it in you. The councils. The education.  The politics. They’re not better there than anyone else in the world. They’re not any better. No, organized religion is not for you. Or for anyone, really. That’s just what they’re adjusted to. The world hates change.  I know you still need to worship. So you occasionally go back there, to their building, to their House of God. You go to celebrations, like Christmas, like Easter. And you still go a few Sundays a month. It can’t ruin you that way. I know, because I’ve seen it. I’ve seen you sitting there, reflecting quietly in your room. Your faith is pure there, with no one else around. No priest and his message. No Vatican Voodoo. Nobody with a show put on, singing, dancing, praying, just so everyone can see them and say “Boy, are they ever a good Christian”. No. Maybe your faith isn’t as strong as theirs. But then again, it might be, because it’s true.  Sincerely, Yourself    urlLink  postCount('nov32002');

      Prayers. Sometimes we pray for something, and we really want it. We wait, and we wait. It doesn't happen. So, we go on about our lives, and eventually, we forget about our unanswered prayers. Then one day, out of nowhere, BLAM, God listens. So where was the prayer. Was it lost in the mail? Was God's inbox a little too full? Or was He simply waiting for the right moment to respond?   A while back...like maybe 10 or 11 months, I was still big into God. I used to pray that Crystal would find God. She always said he hated her. I told her otherwise, but she never listened. So I prayed, that God help her know Him. Eventually, I gave up. Then, I started falling away from God. Some of my personal views and beliefs aren't in agreeance with the church. Most of them are, but there are the few exceptions. Anyway, last night we had a talk. She's been talking to Barry, and now we've decided to slow down a bit. Well, a lot. She wanted to act completely like friends. I can't have that. So we agreed on holding hands and kissing each other goodbye. She challenged me to put my life in perspective, and when I look at it, I have really grown away from what I once was, and what I love. I don't know where I'm going with this, but I do love Crystal, and I guess God knew exactly when he'd need her to find God, because I'd need to find Him, too...   urlLink  postCount('prayers');

      Your face has all but faded from my mind. The only reason I have some conception of what it looks like is because of the photograph hanging on my wall. Do you remember my face? Is there still a photograph of me hanging on your wall? Did you ever even have a photograph of me? I don't quite know. Wait, yes, you did. I remember which one it was. Someone once told you it looked as though you were crying in it. You weren't, or course. The camera just took you by surprise. Even if you did have that photo somewhere with you, it would be irrelevant. I have changed a great deal since those days. You probably have too. You did mean everything to me at one time, but now, you are nothing but part of a past I'd rather not discuss. I don't know where you are living now, or what you are doing. The importance of the late night phone calls seems to have diminished now, reduced to a slight attachment to the photo on my wall.  urlLink  postCount('nov232002');

      Last night was splendid. First off we went to the mall, and we ate ice cream at the Laura Secord store. Ice cream is a great thing, it makes people happy. After I was done my ice cream (i eat it slow, she was waiting on me), we went to a play at the college. It was an interesting play. I'm sure it'd be better if I understood it, maybe I'll look it up on the internet tonight and see. After the play, we went to Tim Horton's. I love that place, so many memories. She has an idea for a grad dress, and I really like the idea. It's really...her. Afterwards, we went to Superstore so she could pick up some stuff for a school project. We talked to Paul. I seen Shawna. They all have to wear ugly red shirts. On our way back to the car, she kissed me, and it was a great feeling. I got that feeling, the one when you kiss someone for the first time. Butterflies, heart skips a beat. It was great, like our first kiss all over again. It was a great feeling. We went to see "One Hour Photo". It's a decent movie. I was sitting with my slush on my chest...kinda holding it there, and I was slouched over. Anyway, there was a hole in the bottom of the cup, and it leaked red stuff all over one of my good shirts. I was mad. I soaked it in cold water and my mom said she would try and get it out today. I haven't seen her or the shirt today, so I don't know. After the movie, I took Crystal home. We kissed in my car for a long time. It was the most pure kiss I have ever kissed, where it is just "i love you" with nothing else...no lust, no anger, no "this is fun"...just "i love you". And I do.  urlLink  postCount('nov212002');

      I've heard these songs a thousand times before, but for some reason they are affecting me more tonight. I don't know what I should do. I feel so shut off from you. Jason Wade keeps singing his Lifehouse songs:   Could you let down your hair Be transparent for awhile? Just a little while To see if you're human after all Honesty is a hard attribute to find When we all want to seem like We've got it all figured out Well let me be the first to say that I don't have a clue I don't have all the answers Ain't gonna to pretend like I do  Just trying To find my way Trying To find my way The best I know how  Well I haven't memorized all of the cute things to say But I'm working on it Maybe I'll master this art form someday If i quote all the lines off the top of my head Would you believe I fully understand all these things I've read  I'm just trying To find my way Trying To find my way Trying To find my way the best that I know how  Well I haven't got it all figured out quite yet but Even if it takes my whole life to get to where I need to be and if I should fall to the bottom of the end I'll be one step back to you  Tryin to find my way    There is a cat on the road. An ordinary housecat, reduced to roadkill. It makes me sad to know, that in a blink of an eye, you can loose everything. And we will all die. But I'm not ready for that yet, and so I ignore the cat, that reminder of frailty and mortality. I pull into your driveway. You hug me. For a long time. It is nice. You know I'm sorry for what I put you through. But what about what you put me through? Love is a funny thing.

Everything that I find mildly interesting or that I get a little bit excited about he finds a way to cut it down. Aren't parents supposed to be supportive of what their kids want to do?

I went Christmas tree hunting with Crystals family. They fight a lot, but it's not as much as my family when we do things like that. That is probably why my family never does things like that.

I just wanted to live my life, help people as much as I could, be a good person. Now. I work at RadioShack, convincing people they need that $500 stereo instead of the $350 one. And for what?

      Like a Saturday Night I'll Be Gone Like a Saturday Night I'll be gone before you knew that I was there  So you wrote it down  I'm supposed to care Even though it's never there Sorry if I'm not prepared  Is it hard to see the things you substitute? For me and all my thoughts of you It's eating me alive to leave you  Maybe it's childish  And maybe it's wrong But so is your blank stare in lieu of this song Maybe it's childish  And maybe it's wrong  Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong You're leaving me, you're leaving me  in lieu of this song Don't wanna be don't wanna be wrong You're leaving me, you're leaving me  in lieu of this, lieu of this song  I'm breathing in your skin tonight Quiet is my loudest cry Wouldn't wanna wake the eyes that make me melt inside  And if it's healthier to leave you be May your sickness come and set me free Kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me  (Humming Part)  Finding my own words my own little stage My own epic drama my own scripted page Send you the rough draft I’ll seal it with tears Maybe you’ll read it and I’ll reappear  From the start it was shaky And the characters clash A nice setting for heartache where emotions come last All I have deep inside to overcome this desire A friendly intentions and fair-weather smiles  And I don’t wanna be, don’t wanna be wrong You’re leaving me, you’re leaving me  in lieu of this song Don’t wanna be don’t wanna be wrong You’re leaving me you’re leaving me in lieu of this, lieu of this song  Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone Like Saturday night I’ll be gone before you knew that I was there   Lyrics from the band Yellowcard.

      We all have something, don't we? So we all have a past, things left behind, in search of better things. Take me for example, I was once told by someone on the scene that I had great potential in mountain biking. And now here I am, 3 years later, with nothing more than a hundred dollar jacket and a bike that I don't ride.   I went to see the movie "Sweet Home Alabama" tonight. The character played by Reese Witherspoon reminded me so much of Amanda. Great fashion sense in a town full of rednecks. All her childhood she longed to get away from the small town, move to the city and find her calling. Once in the city, however, she realizes that nothing can compare to home, and that nothing can replace what was once took for granted.  My mother. She wished my brother and I were still 3 or four, still dependant on her. She tries frantically to get us back there, but she cannot do the impossible. She cannot find her way back there, no matter how hard she tries. This could be the starting point, the crack that makes her what she is today, and could lead one day to her possible insanity.  Yes, we wall have something left in the past, something lying there, waiting to be re-discovered. And just like the movie poster says, "Sometimes what you're searching for is right where you left it". But then again, maybe the today you want to escape will one day be the yesterday you long to have back....   urlLink  postCount('sweethome');

      It's the worst feeling in the world, the one that I have right now. There is so much that I try to say, so many words and feelings that want to come out, but I can't seem to put them to words. I feel unhappy, but happy at the same time. I feel healthy, but know that I am sick. Sick Sick Sick. And how.  urlLink  postCount('dec2302');

      My jacket smells of cigarettes, and my wallet is a little lighter. Oh, the wonders of the bar. I hate the bar, I really do. I've only gone twice, both to different ones. I think i'd rather get drunk at home instead of sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't like playing pool. I'm sure it would be cheaper, as well. I have a whopping 3 dollars left in my bank account. And a 20 dollar bill for gas until payday on Friday at 12:01am. I spent 600 dollars in 2 weeks. I think that's a new record for me. Granted, some of it was on Christmas.  The last year has been...well, interesting. I think I've changed so much. I feel like I don't even know the person I was back then. Can you really be compared to yourself...I mean, we all change so much in the course of a year, can we even be considered the same person? In a way I don't think so, but there's another part of me that knows nobody ever changes  completely , and there will always be part of what once was in all of us.  Bah.   RESOLUTIONS  1. Stop living from pay cheque to pay cheque. 2. Put 200 dollars a cheque away for school 3. Really decide what I want to do for a career 4. Hunt down and have reunions with at least 3 people from my past.  Meh. I'm rambling. I probably won't write tomorrow night...so, Happy New Year, guys... To each his own, and to each a great year!  urlLink  postCount('end2002');

      Wow. Today was like a big rollercoaster ride on a stomach full of corn dogs and churros. Started off with a very bad conversation with Crystal. Hence started the low part of the day. We fought online for a while, and then I went over there. Things got better and better as the day progressed. I bought a new jacket today, I quite like it. I've never really owned anything like it before. I also found out Crystal has a secret online diary. I know the URL, just not the password. I'm sure if I really tried I could find it out, maybe get Marks help with that. But I won't because I respect the fact that she set it up so that I didn't know what was going on inside her head. I also started one a while back, but never followed through with it and now I forget my username. Ha, well, that's how it goes, I suppose. Ugh. I've had enough pizza the last couple days. And I probably get more tomorrow at work. I have to stay 3 hours after close and clean, put out stock, and help move the stuff from the toystore and remote storage back to the store. How fun does that sound?  Ick. I'm hoping to see crystal monday. Holy shit, then tuesday is New Years Eve already. Crystal is trying to throw together a last minute thing at her house...I hope some ppl show up.  I injured my elbow.  urlLink  postCount('aq2002');

      I must admit, I haven't had much to write about as of late. It's pretty much all the same stuff I've said time and time again. Life is getting rather boring. If it weren't for Crystal, I suppose I would go mad, locked in my dark room...typing away...I'm sure I would have finished writing a book or something by now. I'm off tomorrow, so maybe I'll write something of substance later tonight or tomorrow...maybe.

      I went to the musem today to see the exhibit of artwork by Carol Ho. I found it quite intriguing. It wasn't really all that disturbing, and I don't see the point of this hoo-ha that has been going on lately concerning her work. She's an artist, and this is her way of getting her message across. So deal with it.   I apologize to those of you who actually visit my site (which isn't many, I know), for my recent...neglect. I've been working on this new and fantastic site for most of the time I spend online. I sincerely apologize if any of you were upset by this absence, although I'm sure it cause little, if any grief on your part. I just really haven't had all that much to say. All around me I see change, it really, I have no opinion on it. Edward and Miranda. I don't understand those two. I'm sure they were married long ago, and have gone beyone that "happy couple" stage. Now I'm almost certain there in their mid-life crisis. Almost menopausal of them. Ashlyn and Brian. I've been informed that they're all but engaged. Good for them. It's an interesting match to say the least, but by no means a bad match. I suppose those are the kinds or relationships that are the best though, the kind where you never thought they'd end up together. It's those kinds of relationships that last because they were founded on friendship. Not alcohol or looks or clothes or any other factor. Just friendship. And that is what is most important in a relationship, is friendship. Sean and Leah...they're getting married soon as well. June or July...I don't quite remember the exact date. It doesn't seem that long ago that I went to cadets, but ended up skipping it with Sean. I think I was in about grade 7. We walked around downtown Red Deer, eating Subway and McDonalds. Those were the days when I didn't give any thought to the rest of my life. I could just go day by day, watching the world spin around me. I was by no means still, though. I was a raging whirlwind of hormones and rage. And then there's Crystal and I. The original plan was to buy her a ring with part of my inheretence money from my deceased great grandmother, and give it to her this summer after she graduated. That plan when down the toilet after one of her little spells when she told me she didn't know if I was the one, if she really knew that she wanted me around forever. So, if you look at it in one way, I am, at this very moment, typing on her engagement ring, becuase I spent that money on this computer instead. It's really kind of depressing. But when I think about Brian and Ashlyn, Sean and Lea, Eddie and Miranda...I know that I'm not ready for that yet. I know that Crystal is amazing, and I know that I want her forever...but I'm not ready for that commitment yet. Even being engaged...usually you set a date, and the deadline would drive me nuts. I'm not ready for that yet. If you do get engaged, but don't set the date right away, I can see it becoming easier and easier to put it off as time goes on. It only takes 3 months of living together to become common-law husband and wife, and in today's society, what else do you really need? Yes, I think it would be better to be able to know the date as soon as you become engaged. Does this make sense to anyone?

      Sigh. What am I doing? I really have no idea anymore. Friday night, I went out to Manhattan's with Alisa and some of her friends. I had a great time, but everytime I saw someone kissing, I just wanted Crystal there with me. I did dance though, and it wasn't that bad. After seeing some of the other guys dance, I figured I couldn't do much worse than that. Last night, Crystal came out here with me after work. It was different. We had a talk...I'm not sure I can post the topic of the converstation here...but I've been thinking.  Maybe she's right. Maybe she's not what I want. But she is what I want. I want a girl that likes to go out and have fun, I want a girl that knows how to have a good time. Crystal used to do those things, and me, being the stupid kid I was, discouraged it. And now look, it's what I want, but we've both changed. We've almost switched positions. I used to love just staying at home with her, and she used to want to go out. Now, I want to go out, and she just seems to want to stay at home, although I know she really wants to get out and do something different. Hopefully things will change when she turns 18. Then she can go out...Sigh. I really want things to work with her. The other day, when we were walking around the furniture store, talking about what furinture we would like in a house, I was happy, I really was. She is what I want, it's just buried inside of her...  urlLink  postCount('whatiwant');

      AAARGH....I"ve been in such a bad mood lately. Taking words for what they are and not what they mean in the most frustrating thing in the world. I was supposed to be off tomorrow but because Stacy got his ass fired I have to work. Crystals mom thinks I'm evil, which I guess in some eyes I might be, but I don't think I'm evil. It all adds up and I've just been so....easily angered lately. I hate it, but lately, I just don't really know how to be happy. Every smile is forced, every laugh is fake. I have to go to work. 15 bloody hours today. I'll write more when I get home if I don't collapse from exhaustion first.

      fucking blogger. there is no fucking way i'm typing it all out again. fucking fucking blogger.  Well, so much for my all amazing entry. Blame blogger. Due to lack of any real motivation to retype it all...i'll stick to the basics. Crystals parents are mad at me. I apparently "peeled out" of their driveway. Yes, I see the danger a 1989 Nissan Sentra piece of shit car could pose. Watch out, the tire might fly off and break your window. I don't think I really did anything wrong. Ooooh, my tires may have spun a little bit. It's fucking winter, shit happens. It's the way I drive. I don't think I really caused any harm or danger or any other negative effect. Assuming I even did it. And her mom also thinks I'm evil because Crysal and I occasionally sleep in the same bed. It's not like I've caused her to become the High Priestess of the church of Satan. Honestly.   I'm sick of this. All through bloody highschool, my life was an act. I didn't drink, I didn't smoke, I didn't do drugs. And for what? So parents might like me. And look, they still hate who I am, so I guess I wasted my entire youth away trying to be something I didn't want to be. I really need a change. I don't care what Crystal thinks anymore. I'm getting the tattoo I want, and I'm going to wear the clothes I want. I'm sick of all of this. This is me people, if you don't like it, get rid of me...

      They came, they laughed, and they left. Yes. The little gathering at my house is over, and I escaped with a mere broken blind, tipped over barbeque, and a little disapointment. When we were sitting in the bathroom with the door closed, her shirt open, I may have been the happiest person in the entire world. Nothing to care about, no worries about me at all. Then all within 10 minutes, the night came to a very sour end. "Brian has some, you wanna try?". Of course I don't want to try. My beliefs on the subject are something not many people understand. And as is usually the case with things not understood, they are often not respected. Even by the people who claim to love you the most. Am I still mad? Of course. Have I forgiven her? Not entirely. Have I found it in myself to move on? Certainly. It always happens this way, though. As soon as I begin to trust, as soon as I begin to really believe, it is destroyed. A little alcohol and the peer pressure of one person she doesn't know that well is all it took. Even with me standing at the top of the stairs, screaming, begging her to stop, she put it in her mouth. At that moment, I was destroyed. Nothing I've ever felt compared to that moment...my heart sunk. I can't say as it's completely floated back up yet. It usually takes dead things a few days to resurface. I was begging her to stop. She just looked at me, with a look of pure disgust, a look full of hate. Like nothing from the past year and a half mattered at all...there was so much I was feeling for her just moments before, and with that one look and the decision to go to the backyard, she threw so much of it away. It may take a long time for either of us to get them completely back. Finally, I went out to get her. The smell, I couldn't believe the smell on her breath...It was the smell that drove me to take most of the pictures of her off of my wall. I don't know when, if ever I'll put them back up. I'm not a huge fan of empty reminders of days past. It's the same type of reminder that has led to the depression and lethargy I've been feeling the last couple days. It was that smell that drove me to consider myself for a few hours to be her ex-boyfriend. Yes, for a few hours, I was just a friend, taking care of a sick companion, stroking her hair as she filled with vomit an old tupperware container that used to hold the brown sugar I'd pour on my oatmeal when I had nothing like this to worry about. Then, as the alcohol wore off, I considered what had happened. It was alcohol that led to all of this. It was alcohol that clouded her judgment, it was alcohol that made it seem right to rid myself of all the reminders of her I had collected over the past 18 months. And so, today, I'm pouring the remaining alcohol down the sink...I need a break from this shit...

      She's not very good at keeping promises. So I guess she owes me. Although the opportunity probably will not come again for a few months. Besides this, it was a splendid Valentines day. Supper went well, as did the massage and time following supper. She really looked beautiful. Hopefully her gift will arrive in the mail sometime next week.   My parents come home today. This makes me sad. I am going to the Kiros/Deville/Sewing With Nancie show tonight in Calgary, and we wanted to leave early to go shopping, but no....I have to wait until they fucking get home. We'll probably have an hour tops to shop before everything closes. They're not even here and they find a way to ruin a perfectly good day. Fuch You.  Meh.

      She says it's in the way that I act. I thought I was being understanding, content to sit there typing away on my computer while she quietly did her homework. And it's in the way that I act. I don't care that I don't always get the attention that I want from her, I realize it's not always possible. But there's always something that eventually sets me off into my little world of unhappiness. Today. I know what it was today. We got back from the little pot-luck thing, and I was happy. Happy with her, and generally content with life. She still had some homework left to do, so I got out my computer and started playing a game. She sat down beside me and started kissing my neck and giving me the attention that I had been waiting for all day. I knew she still had homework left to do, so I paused my game, gave her a kiss back, and then resumed my game. She persisted in kissing my neck and putting her arms around me. So I quit the game and shut my computer. As soon as I did this, she ignored me again, and decided to go back to the table.   I hate her house, I really do. I'm sick of her family. Her and her sister are the only ones I can stand anymore. It's not that I don't like them, I'm just...I see them too much. I'm there too much. If I told Crystal that, she'd say "well then, stay home". or "it's not my fault you work till 9 every night". Well, I can't stay home. All I want to do is spend time with you. It's not my fault, I don't write the schedule.   All I do want to do is spend time with her. I don't care what we do. I would love to be able to have a conversation with her, but I can't. I don't know how. But really, I can't blame myself for this one. Recently, we don't get much of a chance to actually have a conversation. There's always someone around. At her house, NOBODY GOES ANYWHERE...there's usually at least 4 of the 5 of them there...and they are constantly checking up on us, making sure I'm not assaulting her or something. My house...well, let's just say my mom does too much laundry. I'm not a home-body. I like to go out, even if it's just to the mall or just to run a few errands. She hates the mall. If I suggest that we go for a walk at Kin Canyon like we used to, the idea is immediatly shot down. I learned to stop making requests like that a long time ago.  She's always tired. Or I'm always tired. Or she feels like crap. Or I do something to piss her off. There's always something standing in the way of us being totally happy. She blames it on me, and I blame it on her. I don't know who's right, or maybe we're both just wrong. I try not to complain anymore about not seeing enough action, not feeling like she's there, not feeling like she cares. She constantly asks me why I it doesn't seem like I'm happy anymore. I say to that, my feelings are directly related to how she treats me. When she treats me like she did on Sunday, like she's happy to see me, like there's nothing she'd rather do but run away with me and never come back. Those are the times when I'm happy. When she treats me like she does most of the time, like an annoyance, just someone who won't go away. Then I get...well, grumpy, for lack of a better word.  There's been many stages in our relationship. From the weird feeling I got from her putting my arm around her to last Easter Holidays when we would spend every night on the pullout couch in her basement just...exploring, to the incredibly "open-minded" time to where we are now.  I can't tell you how much I miss all of them.  All in all,  I'm a simple person to keep happy.

      I'm up at 9:30 on my day off again. Does anyone know why? Is it because my mom demands on waking me up at 9:24 every single fucking day? And for what? Because she's a clean-a-holic? Her voice is definatley not the first thing I want to hear in the morning, nor is the washing machine, the vacuum, dishes dropping or pots clanging. It puts me in a shitty mood for the rest of the day. I need a fucking apartment.  On the brighter side of life, yesterday was not too bad. Sure, I was pissed off because I didn't get the day off when I had already paid $25 to go skiing with Crystal, but I did do over $2000 in sales. That may not sound like much, but working at RadioShack, it is, trust me.  Oh look, she's bitching at me again. "Get out of bed" she says. "Let me critisize you some more" she says. "You're a lazy bum with no talent who's never going to amount to anything" she says. blah blah blah blah blah. I would like to stick a sock in her mouth and feed her some sleeping pills.

      I just don't know today. I have no answer for any of the questions I ask myself.  You know, John had a good point. About her.  I get like this everytime, and everytime I promise next time will be better. I promise next time will be better. I never change though. And why should I? I guess the feeling is less now than it used to be, but still. I want to be with her.  She says I never enjoy myself, that I'm always too quiet. But where was the last place we went? Chads? When was that? Right after I got my wisdom teeth out....hmmm...when was that?  dissapointed? read my poems.

      I can't be forced to write. I can't be forced to have deep amazing thoughts. How I wish I could, because I want nothing more than to make her happy. But when she is continually asking me to write about her, it breaks my heart that I can't. I was tired. I was far too tired for the deep thoughts she was seeking anyhow.  There are no thoughts I've been hiding from her. Just actions.   "I hide behind these books I read, while scribbling my poetry. Like art could save a wretch like me, with some ideal ideology that no one could hope to achieve. I want to rise to the occasion, meet all of their demands"   It's early. For now I'm content with my life. Again, she feels close, it feels like she wants to be here, too. But how long will it last? How long until she's back to yesterday?   "If you don't, I'll start drinking like the way I drank before, and I just won't have a future anymore"

      I don't know what I'm supposed to say. For one thing, today was a lot better than yesterday. She was happy. Or so it seemed. And honestly, I was happier than I've been for a while.   I made $20 selling some old computers to Matt from work. I think I may have ripped him off. I should offer to give him some of his money back.   At the moment, I'm not thinking that much. I haven't really had many thoughts the last few days. I've been so busy with work and Crystal. Today was the first day in a long time I've been able to just sit and do nothing for a while. Too bad it was freezing out today. I really miss my bike.    The thoughts are coming in fragments now, nothing's coherent anymore

      Well. That was a pleasant break in the clouds. Who would have thought that sunshine could start with a K? Or that the clouds would part so quickly and unexpectedly....Some people just have that ability, to lift my spirits, to make me happy, to make the pain and depression and mild alcoholism not seem so bad.  I spend many hours talking to Crystal tonight. Not the Crystal you've come to expected to be mentioned on these pages, but a different one. To clear the confusion, This latter Crystal will be reffered to as Krystal with a K. I don't think I've smiled that much for a while. And I don't think I've seen someone smile that much because of things I've said for quite a while. Tomorrow, I get to see Crystal with a C. She will be at the show. So much has changed since I last need St. Tibs Day. I can spell Konfusion with a K.  More may follow in the morn, but I'm sure I'll be up before you all anyway...lazy bums!!!!

       music: bright eyes - it's cool, we can still be friends queens of the stone age - nobody knows   Yesterday, it was hard. I was fighting back tears for most of the day. It was probably the most torturous three hours of my life thus far. The hardest part was not being able to just put my arms around her or tell her that I love her. Those are things I took for granted that would always be there. I guess I was wrong. For those of you out there with someone to love, don't ever take that for granted. Remember everytime you kiss them, it could be the last time, remember that those plans you make for the future, the house, the kids, the dog, the fish, they're not for real. When you wake up hungover in their arms, hang on the them as long as you can.......  The average American falls in love 6 times. No wonder the divorce rate is so high. As soon as you love someone, you can never stop loving them. Sure, they may drop down on your priority list, but you can never stop loving them. To say that you stop loving them means you never loved them at all. But is it really possible to carry on in a marriage if you are still in love with five other people? I don't think so. If I fall in love one more time, and it ends, I think I will live a life of lonliness, just because when I get married, I want to be able to give them everything I have, and not have a past full of other things that I still may or may not be attached to.   it's a lesson learned.

      ON DEATH AND DYING:  I've often thought of what it would like to be dead, in fact, over the past 3 or 4 years, it's been almost a daily thought. Even on my way to Crystals house after my staff meeting, not knowing what conversation was to occur just a few moments later, I wondered what would happen if I turned in front of that snowplow, or drove off the overpass.  Now, I'm not saying I'm suicidal, I'm not. I realize that if I ever did do something stupid like that, everything would be over. Sure, it hurts to know that Crystal may not be back, but there's still a chance. If I wasn't here tomorrow, all that chance would be dead, just like me. No, I'd rather be alive and suffering than dead. I'm just saying, the thought has always been there....yes, it's been stronger the last two days...but it's just thoughts.

      And so, this is my brutally honest entry. Everything you may have read here thus far has only been half truths, half of the story, half of my insides. And so now I'll spill them out for you, set them out there for all the world to see, for everyone to judge, for everyone to read and disregard. This is my confessional.  ON LOVE:  I've always been searching. Crystal pointed out to me last night as she was breaking up with me that she's never known me as a single person, I would go from relationship to relationship, never taking a break from the dating scene. She thought this was a bad thing, but it's what I want. I've known what I wanted ever since I was 15, and had my heart broken for the first time while talking on the phone, sitting on the floor of my room. That was the first time I had ever loved, and that was the first time the girl didn't love me the same way I love her. I've been told by someone that  I have a larger than average capacity to love. Perhaps this is my downfall. Everyone I love is not mentally capable of loving me back that much. So, the first time I fell in love I was only 15. Some would say that's far to young to know what love is, but I have to disagree. I realized not long after that day, that there were few, if any people out there who were capable of the love I was looking for, but I wanted it so bad. So I continued to look. Everytime, I'd have my heart broken, either by a girl, or by some twist of circumstance. Or both.   When I met Crystal, I was dating Shyla. I knew that Shyla cared for me a great deal, but I was still looking. I was looking because Shyla didn't love me, and I knew she never could. She was simply infatuated, and that was all. I met Crystal at a youth rally, and while sitting on a gymnasium floor, I could tell instantly that there was something very different about her. I thought..."perhaps this is the girl...one of the few..." She did seem to be a girl that was capable of love as deep as I was looking for...there was something about her eyes..I knew she was looking for something, if not to be rescued, at least to be taken away. I wanted so bad to take her away and keep her all to myself. Alas, it couldn't happen. One night, Amanda, Ashlyn and I were going to a punk show. I had just broken up with Shyla a few days before, and was planning on having a... discussion with Crystal, and was hoping by the end of the night I would have a new girlfried, and she would have a  new boyfriend. It was not to be. By the end of the night, she had a boyfriend, but I was still alone. When I first met Crystal, I had given her the drawstring to my hoodie, she tied it around her wrist like a bracelet. I told her to wear it forever. The night I seen her with her "new boyfried", I asked Chelz to look in her giant purse for some scissors. Nobody understood, but that was OK, they didn't need to. If I had gotten a hold of some scissors, I was going to walk up to Crystal and cut the drawstring off her wrist. I didn't find any scissors, and the drawstring survives to this day. I didn't talk to Crystal for a long time after that. Months went by. I continued on my quest, and started dating Brandi. Brandi and I did have some great conversations at the beginning of our relationship...and we did get along great. However, we held on far too long after anything that had been there was gone. I couldn't stand to let her go, but it was hurting me so much to be with her. I'd often cry to myself at night...I think she's inspired some of my best poetry as well, just because of the pure emotion she made me feel. After we broke up, we were both dating someone else within 2 days. It should have happened long before it did.   I was finally with Crystal. It was what I had been after for so long, just couldn't admit. I was scared I'd get hurt, and loose her, like had happened the last time I met someone like her. As our relationship progressed, I fell in love more and more, and so did she. However, as her feelings of love grew stronger, so did her doubts. She's always doubted....  *TO BE CONTINUED****

       I dreamt of a fever, one that would cure me of this cold, winter-set heart With heat to melt these frozen tears and burn with reasons as to carry on Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow But I swear that I would follow anything- just get me out of here But you get six months to adapt and you get two more to leave town And in the event that you do adapt we still might not want you around But I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose but I know that's impossible now And so I drink to stay warm and to kill selected memories 'cause I just can't think anymore about that or about her tonight And I give myself three days to feel better or else I swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff because if I can't learn to make myself feel better then how can I expect anyone else to give a shit? I scream for the sunlight or a car to take me anywhere. just get me passed this dead and eternal snow 'cause I swear that I'm dying. Slowly, but it's happening and if the perfect spring is waiting somewhere just take me there and say and lie to me and say it's gonna be alright.    --Bright Eyes

      to write or not to write. that is the question.   damn, she looked good last night. I was going to ask her if they wanted to go to BPs or something for a bit, but by the way she was acting, I knew what the answer would have been. Still. I should have asked. So much to say...better left until I'm there...with her.  it would make me happy if she came to see me today. She won't.  i'm only happy when it rains

      And where have you all gone? Heather? Are you there? I read your blog sometimes. I think of calling, but I can never bring myself to dial the last number. The 9. It's always been the hardest button to push. Crystal? Where have you gone? You know I still want you around in some capacity. Jason...Jason my good friend, I saw you getting gas the other night, but I was too tired and too scared to pull into the parking lot to say hello. Courtney...ah Courtney, my short little friend, and Chelz, where the hell are ya? All of you, I wish things were like they were, I wish things could be the same.   and maybe it's all my fault, and to each of you, my sincere apologies

      Six hundred and fourty seven songs in my playlist. And there isn't a single one that I want to listen to. It makes me sick. I've been wondering where my other songs went, there's so many songs I remember having, and don't remember deleting. Meh. I'm such a confused, sad, happy boy right now. And I say the "F" word a lot. The drinking has subsided, though, and the bottles of alcohol that previously littered my floor are now stacked neatly on a shelf, waiting till the day when I need them again. Hopefully next time I drink it will be for social reasons, and not to escape. I got a speeding ticket in the mail today, and I would like to shoot a policeman. There is a major flaw with our traffic system, and that is that a Semi-trailer can go the same speed as a compact car. This defeats the purpose of limits. The limit should be measured either in a)The amount of forward momentum carried by the vehicle, or b) Braking distance (my car will be able to stop a HELL OF A LOT FASTER THAN A FUCKING SEMI TRUCK). I should write my local MLA. Yes I should.

      Because I found one red hair on the night table beside my bed. Because I feel so torn. Because I hate the way you act towards me sometimes. Because I miss your cat. Because I miss shopping with you. Because I miss coming over work and drinking juice out of the big green glasses. Because I miss your mom and dad, and they way you don't appreciate how much they care for you. Because I bought this shirt with you. Because you hate these fucking pants. Because your baby picture is on my wall. Because you changed me in ways you'll never know. Because every song I've heard lately has at least one line that reminds me of you. Because I miss your dog. Because you understood Moulin Rouge. Because you loved to hide me away. Because I felt so free. Because of Heritage Park, and walking the dogs in the snow in Canmore. Because of Petland, with potato fishes. Because of wishing wells. I threw a coin into a wishing well, and now I'd throw my whole billfold in if I thought it would help. Because of your drug use. Because of the way you'd walk on my back. Because of Elimidate and Jay Leno. Because of Easter holidays of last year. Because I feel in love with you on a pullout couch in your basement. Because of your eyes. Because of the way I thought you'd always stay. Because of YC, because of burn french toast, because of tears on your shirt, because of punk shows and kiros and st tibs day and making pizza with Ryan and Kelsey. Because you were my first. Because of the trampoline, because of Mike. Because of the way you smelled, because of all the gifts I bought you. Because of the letters you used to write, back in the day when you appreciated my mind and everything you meant to me. Because you don't care. Because there will be someone new, because this book is probably all lies. Because you never write. Because I never write. Because I have no ambition, because you don't know what you want. All that I wanted was you, and a simple life. Now I don't know what I want. Because you were there  for me when my grandpa died, even thought I showed no emotion. Because you wanted me to meet your family in Saskachewan. Because I never did. Because you might think I'm a stalker now, because you hid me away from your friends. Because I wanted to fucking die almost every day. Because you kept me alive. Because you still leave me for them when you said to let you know. I JUST DON"T FUCKING KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THESE EMOTIONS. These are the reasons. These are the reasons I loved you, and now these are the reasons that drug me.

      Here's the math. Night before last, I talked to Crystal on the phone for roughly 3 hours. 3x60 = 180. Last night, I talked to her for about 2 hours, then we fell asleep on the phone, disconnected at 6 am.  This totals roughly 8 hours. 8x60 = 480. 480 + 180 = 660 minutes. Every month with telus, I get 1000 Canadian long distance minutes. I have 340 minutes left. Unless the billing cycle starts on the first of the month. That would mean most of this math is irrelevant.  I should ask my mom. Except it's 6:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING!  Crystal Beuker's livejournal has been scaring me. She is not a happy person these days, and that is too bad, considering that was the point of this in the first place, was for her to be happy. Maybe I should e-mail her. Maybe she doesn't want to hear from me, she never answers my comments in her livejournal...of course, I don't say too much. Sigh.  I want to move to Red Deer. I need roomate. Roomate can be plural or singular.  e-mail  me.

      Who really knows what I want? I don't. Yes, I want to move out. But to where. They've all crossed my mind. Red Deer, Lethbridge, Toronto, Florence, Paris. I just don't know. In so many ways, I want to just dissapear...not tell anyone where I'm going, just save up some money, and run away. Not forever though, no, just for a year. I'd like to live far away for a year, just start an entrie new life, not have to worry about everything that's happened over the past few weeks. I think Lethbridge would be the best, I'd still be able to get home if need be, but I could forget everything. And so I plot my escape. I save up my money, I bring up your hopes. Will they come crashing down? It's hard to say. I don't want to feel trapped like that. Perhaps two bedrooms.  Last night, Crystal went out with Skye, and I'm assuming JP, although she never mentioned his name. Good for them. I must say, it would make me more comfortable if she started seeing one of them, even if not seriously, than some kid I don't know. It's easier to feel resentment to someone you don't know. I remember the summers Skye and I spent together, he's a good kid.  I know I said I need some time to be single, but I can't ignore this feeling that keeps nagging at the back of my head. I need to find someone again, if that sounds desperate, then fine, I'm desperate. But I'm not. I don't want to find just anyone, I want to find   someone  . Some people may say I have it right in front of me, waiting for me, but as much as it pains me to say, I don't think it is. I'm sorry, but the converstation from last night, it still stands, you're always welcome.    music : Bright Eyes - The Difference In The Shades Bright Eyes - Tereza and Thomas Bright Eyes - Basketball Geoff Berner - Clown and Bard    I can't turn these songs off

      It's come to my attention that Crystal has me blocked on MSN. I suppose that's fair. I might even go so far as to say I deserve it. I really don't want her to be bitter at me, and I'm trying my best not to be bitter with her. Things are hard these days. Everyone has been telling me they're worried about me, they're saying all these nice things about fate and thigns. I don't believe in fate. I don't believe in the fact that there is only one person for everyone. She says she's moved on, and honestly, I'm doing my best. There are things she did that nobody will ever be able to replace, but it's not the end of the world, it's not the end of my life, either. I've decided I need some time to be single, just do whatever. Find out what I need.  I was listening to my Bailey's Car CD today, and I heard a song that almost moved me to tears. I'm not sure why. Here's the lyrics.    Away From You  © 2002 Bailey's Car Written by Cam Stephens   It's not your fault,  It's what they've made you  That makes you unattractive to me  I'm not willing to commit what you want  To give up what you want me to.   You were my life I found myself in you  But now it's time to say goodbye It's time I found out who I am  Away from you.   It was fun while it lasted  But now I don't love you like I did before  Two hands full with one fist was too much  All or nothing you said  Well nothing.   I will always carry the memories  You were more to me than you know.  Regrets, I may have some  But sooner or later  We'd be at this point again....     Yeah. That's that.  Anyway, Crystal. I know you have me blocked. I'm sorry you felt you needed to do that. I would love to talk to you, if you're willing to talk to me, that is. Tell your mom I say hello and pat your dog on the head for me.

      Ok people. The links, they are coming back. Don't worry. If you need to access my poetry, the URL is http://rough-draft.tripod.com/poetry.html.  Wow. You said the words I wanted to hear, but I'm not sure if they had the desired effect. I thought they'd make me feel better about my current situation, instead, they made me feel worse. I realize now, you're going through much the same as I am, except I still believe I see things a little more clearly than you do. I honestly believe that in a while, months, years, maybe even decades, you will think back to this. You are confused right now, and I think someday, after you've done a lot of growing up, you will realize what you've done, and what you had. And I'm fine with that. I may or may not still be waiting for you.  Today, I played Monopoly. I've only ever finished that game twice. Today was not one of them. I watched a fuck load of television today. I needed to turn my brain off. She told my parents her age. I can just imaging the talking to I will be getting tomorrow. I will tell them I will just sit in my room and drink whiskey instead.

      Last night, I fell alseep with a pen in my hand, my face resting on my notebook, crumpling the words I had written hours earlier. I awoke sometime early this morning, probably 6 or so. My jeans (which I was still wearing) were twisted sideways, and rather uncomfortable. My light was still on, so I turned it off, took off my pants, and tried to go back to sleep. My parents woke up. My brother woke up. The usual bickering and fighting ensued. I covered my head with a pillow. My mom came to my room and started yelling something at me about the internet. Yes mom, I will hook it up, but you have to realize, Telus has to do their part, and I'm not going to sit around all day until they call and say that everything should be ready to go. Then I told her to go away. She pointed out that I was already up because my light had been on earlier this morning. Obviously, she has never fallen asleep with the light on.  I am hanging out with Krystal today. I have no idea what we're going to do. I'm sure I'll dress up all nice, shave my face, cut my toe nails. I don't think I've cut my toenails since before Crystal and I went our seperate ways. Maybe I'm holding on to something. Maybe I'm just lazy.   My dad has been nagging me about school. Him and my mother. They both desperately want me to go to RDC, although I have no clue why. I think I am taking Business Administration, but I was comparing the course at RDC to the one in Lethbridge, and the one in Lethbridge looks one hell of a lot better.  and so, I plot my escape . I think it would be a great place to go...it would be good for me. My parents, they have no idea how badly I need out of this house, out of this town. Red Deer, that place is no better. I am anxious, I've been here too long. I'd say I feel like I've overstayed my welcome, but it's almost the other way around, like this area...Red Deer, Sylvan...it's overstayed it's welcome in my life.  and the town stopped pulling it's weight .  Hm. Should I post the poetry from last night? No.  I'm not allowed to feel those emotions.

      Everyone should see this movie. It is called "Chelsea Walls". Everyone should watch it at least 3 times. Yesterday, I went to Crystals house. It was nice to just sit on the couch and eat popcorn with her, it made me really happy, to know that we can still just hang out. Yes, I'm happy. She made one of those "Quiz Your Friends" quiz things, and I got 50%. In some ways, she's changed, I see that in my test results, and other things, I'm sorry to say, I may have never known the answer, or was mislead to believe somethign other than the truth.   Work. Why am I here? I just want to go hang myself in the back room. Swing back and forth to the beat of my boss' depressing music. BLAH.

      The show last night was alright. What do you expect from Dayz Wage, Kiros, Trow and Slick Shoes. The guy at the Slick Shoes merch table tried to get me to buy one of those stupid cloth wristband things. I told him I don't wear them. He said it looked tight. I don't want to look tight. I bought a T-Shirt.  Lost my earing in the mosh pit...should buy a new one before it grows over.

      The other night, Crystal and I talked. We haven't talked like that for quite awhile, and it really seems like we're friends. She says she doesn't want to talk about the past, and really, neither do I. It will always be there, and I don't want to forget it. I know it's going to come up sometimes, but...Somethings are better left unsaid. Or unthought.  And so now, I'm at work. I need to get someone to watch the store while I go and buy me some lunch, because I'm stuck here all by my lonesome.  I've been trying to be happy the last few days. My problems seem so small and trivial when I look at the lives of other people. Like Heather, or my cousin Chris. No, I should be happy that I had the opportunity to be hurt.

      When you're young, you don't notice your surroundings quite so much. Dirty or clean, new or old, the difference is obscure to children. Last night, I vistited an old burger joint my family used to frequent when I was younger. It really is a run down old place. And not run down in just a little way so that it's just different from when I used to go there, no, its the kind of run down that looks decades old.  Maybe it's just my outlook

      My comments seem to have vanished? I guess I'll have to look into that.  Tonight. Tonight was actually great. Not just alright, it was fucking great. I got off work at about 7ish, and came home, tired as fuck with no solid plans for the evening. I noticed the little green light flashing on the answering machine, and found that it was a message from Edward. Him and Miranda came over at around 9. After a few hours of sitting around here downloading miscellaneous things, we left to pick up Niki. I'm not sure how to spell her name, so I'll just leave it as Niki. If someone corrects me, then I will change it. If not, her name is Niki. I'd only met her once, briefly, last week at church. Apparently, everyone on the face of the planet knew her before except for me. We headed off to Red Deer, in search of the elusive Sonja and Karin. We first went to Billy Bob's. What a great place that is. We left, and I splashed Niki with a puddle. It started a thing. You know the things, where everyone decides to join in briefly, until you all realize that you don't really want to be wet, and then you all stop. Good times. After a snack at Timmy's, we travelled over to Manhattan's, still searching for Karin and Sonja. And we found them. And we hugged. And I danced. And I was happy.  And I'm tired. Sorry for the lack of insight into my thoughts, I know how boring "what-i-did-tonight" entries are. Maybe sometime by Tuesday I'll write a long one, on what I think. About everything.  Good night, world.

      in response to some anonymous commenter:   uhm.  what's none of my business? I never claimed to be a tortured goth. Actually, I'd be more likely to say that I'm not. Yes, I was born and raised in suburbia. I'm not complaining, but I'm not exactly thrilled about it, either. Wanna be spooky kid? Not really. My room is bright green and blue. I don't wear any clothing that would make a "wanna be spooky kid". Actually, I dress quite average.  I am ridiculed, but only by you.  I'm not looking for a group of people to pat my head and tell me it's all ok. I continue to write on here because they ask me to.  I will "stop wasting my time and move on". Yes, I am saddened by some recent events, but I also realize that in time, that will pass, and I will go on to lead a full and happy life. If you've never been sad in your life, then I would venture to say you have no emotion. By the way, although I only seem to put my sad thoughts on here, They aren't the only thoughts I have. Most days, I usually do feel some happiness throughout the day.  I don't whore my poetry. Again, it's there because I've been asked to put it up. I've taken it down many times, and have always been asked by many people to put it back up.  And so. I'm not gothic. I'm not a punk. I'm not depressed. I may whine a little, but that's simply because I find it easier to write about the sad than the happy.  P.S.  I have no intention of making your life hard.

      And so it's another night in the past. I dressed "scungy", and fuck did it ever feel good. I forgot I even owned those pants. Well, they haven't been pants for a while...they turned into shorts right before one of the Broomfiller concerts.   If felt good to be drunk. So drunk that I was drifting in and out of consiousness for a while, just laying on the floor, listening to the rap music on the television. It felt good to be drunk. To kill selected memories, to kill selected personalitiy traits. To kill selected parts of myself. It felt good to be there, hungover this morning, feeling like shit. Feeling like dead.  *THERE IS ONE MORE PARAGRAPH, HOWEVER, IT'S BEEN CENSORED IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP ME OUT OF TROUBLE*

      Well then. I guess I'm not allowed to put my emotions on my own webpage. So I guess I'll stop writing now. If you don't want to hear it, stop coming here. I accept that you've moved on, but for fuck sakes, it's been less than a month. Give me some time to grieve, I don't know why you expect me to have moved on completely after this short of time, after all that I felt and gave to you. But fine, if you want me to stop, i'll stop.   breathing that is.

       to sleep, perchance to dream   I've been reading Poe again. Although this entry didn't start with a quote from him, it's his words that are crawling through my head at the moment. So morbid, yet so full of love and truth.  Krystal has gone missing. Not only missing to me, but to her family as well. I sincerely hope she's ok, and I hope she's enjoying herself. Last night, they made Tina leave. I can't believe that Krystal didn't stand up for her. I think it shows...a lack of...character..or dignity..or something. It actually saddens me to some extent, maybe she's not the person I had thought her to be. Oh well. It's out of my control.  Speaking of out of my control, Crystal hasn't exactly been being nice to me, but when I look at her situation, I can't blame her. She wants so desperately to sort out her life and figure out who she is, but she can't because there's so much in the way. One being a hurt ex-boyfriend, but that is the smallest, probably the easiest to push out of the way right now. I really hope things work out for her...I hate to see her down.   you've lost all feeling for this town  hm.

      My ear - or rather the hole i put in it - is infected. Now I understand why Crystal got so mad at me when I would accidentaly bump hers when they were infected. It is not a very fun thing!   So, after 3 and a half weeks of bitching and complaining, Telus is finally sending a tecnician out to my house to hook up the god damned internet. I looked at it, and Mark looked at it. There is something wrong, and we tried to tell them that a long fucking time ago. All they kept saying is it can take 24-48 hours to work. They said that for roughly 336 hours before they decided to actually send someone out. Too bad they're sending him tomorrow, and it kind of interferes with my plans of not coming home tonight. Meh. There's always other nights to drink my worries away.  And damn all you anonymous commenters.

      I just finished cleaning my car.  It is amazing how many memories the trunk of a car can hold, I spent almost an hour just looking through old papers and photographs and notebooks...oh the notebooks. There was 6 of them there, all with various things written in them. These are things I didn't want people to read at the time, but now, now I will post them, for little of it matters anymore.   old journal entry #1  There is a box, it is sitting idly on the floor. In inches, it measures 23x29x16. I measured it. I could probably fit inside. I wonder how long I could stay there. Hours? Days? Perhaps I could stay there long after everyone had stopped looking for me. I could remain there, entombed in cardboard, while someone else cleaned the toilets and loved my girlfriend.    old journal entry #2  I hit a new personal speed record for Taylor Drive today. 107km/h    old journal entry #3  She fixes her hair and says it never does what she wants it to. She turns around, her hair is in braided pig tails. We laugh. She puts on a toque. She looks good. I'm happy. She doesn't...nevermind. Women always insult themselves to that men compliment them. We're going to a party soon. On Some farm.    old journal entry #4  They sit idly at the table in her kitchen, talking softly of things important to them. In future years, these things will be forgotten, but for now, their six year old minds find it important. He tells her of one time he walked by the park and it was pitch black. She points to a black star on her hot pink swimsuit. "Like this?" "No, darker"    old journal entry #5  I've heard these songs a thousand times before, but for some reason, they are affecting me more than they have before. As I drive you home, I think of nothing. I loose myself in the song. We pass some roadkill. A cat. An average, pet cat. It sends shivers down my spine. We will all die. You. Me. Will die. maybe someday I will be ready, but not today. There is so much to do. I want more chances to make you tea biscuits and do your biology homework. I want more chances to try and get some sexual activity out of you, and get shot down so bad I don't even get a kiss. "Sexual Activity" is a quote from your bio homework. I pull into your driveway and turn the music down. we hug. For a long time. You go inside. I drive away. I think about the cat, and take and alternate route home.

      My car is fixed, but not repaired. It's a temporary solution that may last a while or may leave me sitting on the side of the road. Fantastic work, dad. But seriously, it's appreciated that he at least tried to fix it, even if I do end up stranded somewhere in the middle of the night. It will be an adventure for all.   My district manager was in the store yesterday, and if I want to transfer to Lethbridge at the end of summer, then the job is mine. If not, I'm free to stay here. I don't know. In one way, I want so badly just to leave, just to forget all of this. Another part of me, however, is saying that I should stay, see how some things pan out. I mean, today, today could just be a shitty day, right? And maybe all in all, it'll be a shitty month, but things have got to get better, right? I'm just not sure.   I need $200. Right now. Well, ok, not  right  now, but soon, by Wednesday, and payday is Friday. Maybe I'll go pawn off my laptop...those places keep things for a bit so you can buy them back, right? Isn't that how they work? Or is that those payday loan places? I just don't know.  Tonight, I'm supposed to go out with Edward and Nikki and presumably Miranda. Hopefully it will dig me out of this stupid little hole. I'm so fucking broke though, but still, I need to get out of this house, to forget about things for a bit....

       FUCKING HORRIBLE DAY   1. Couldn't sleep last night, tired as hell today 2. Got in my car that's supposed to be fixed, stalls halfway down the fucking alley 3. Coming to work, got stuck behind HUGE truck, 60km all the way 4. Late for work. 5. Store is in pieces, and they expect Bryce and I to fix it. Fuckers at head office just decide to "change the store layout". That means they sit behind a desk and draw pictures while their minimum wage sales associates bust their backs. Corporate whores.  Bah.

      Ok. I'm going to attempt to finish my entry from last night.  I still smell like tobacco smoke, and my head hurts a little. It's what I deserve, I guess. Hm. So, my mom dropped me off at Amandas, and we walked up to the bar. I had never been to that one before. It's a totally different atmosphere than Manhattan's, or even Billy Bob's, and I think, If I had to choose, I think I like the small bars better, where you can just go get drunk with your friends, and name the drinks that the bartender invents. She invented one yesterday, and we named it the Red Foreman. What a great night!  It was nice to see Amanda again, I really miss her. So many memories with that girl.  Nikki was there also...so comfortable. I'm told she's    . Silly people.  Ugh. I'm going to go have a shower.

      So here I am. Drunk as fuck and smelling of tobacco smoke. I need to stop drinking so mauch. It is tapping me out. I have a car to pay for, gosh darn it. SIgh. So, I spent the majority of the night almost passed out on Nikki. There is something about her that is just comfortable.   hhh...too drunk tot= tyoe. will finish tomorrow.

      Well, my car is dead. The clutch is gone, which means I have to drive the loser cruiser (mini-van with wood panels) until I remedy this situation by either buying a new car, or fixing this one, neither of which I can really afford.   So. following suit with mark, I am now "whoring my self out for money if any of you would like my services email as well ;)"

      SATURDAY MORNING:  Drug my ass out of bed having not slept more than two hours, still tired as fuck from the night before (see entry below). Stumbled over to the shower and turned it on. I just stood there, leaning on the wall...not thinking about anything at all. When I got out of the shower, I felt a lot better, very much awake and ready for the day. Then, I looked outside and noticed the huge white blanket that had swallowed my car. I bravely stepped outside and was pelted by hundreds of speeding blowing ice shards. My good mood was gone, not to return until the evening.  SATURDAY EVENING:  I decided the roads were too shitty to drive back to Sylvan for a few hours, only to venture back into Red Deer. Bryce and I went to his house, and just chilled on the couch and drank a little. Around 9:30, we took a cab to Boston Pizza for Chantelles 18th birthday. I love 18th birthdays, but I must say, I wouldn't trade mine for anything like that. My birthday was perfect, I wouldn't have it any other way...  Chantelle's boyfriend drove some of us to the bar, and Bryce and I had to fight over who was going to get in the car first. You see, whoever got in first got to mash up aginst the hot chick in the backseat. I won, and I sat beside the hot chick. I bought her and Chantelle a drink later, and starting telling me things, interesting things. I really have known her for a long time. Whenever I've thought or spoke about it, it's always been "I've known her since Rome". It didn't dawn on me until last night actually how long that is. Two and a half years. Wow.  After the bar, Bryce and I found some drunk guys with a free cab fare coupon. We took advantage of the situation and shared a cab with them. I fell asleep almost immediately.  SUNDAY MORNING:  Fell off the couch at around 8am. Got back on it for another hour, and then stumbled over to the bathroom. Did my hair. Tried to wake up Bryce. Left.  I went over the Sacred Heart Church, and brushed my teeth in the parking lot. It was weird to be there. I only knew half of the people, the youth group has changed so much.   SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING:  We came back to Sylvan, and a few people came here. They were bored, I know they were, but I was so tired, I just didn't feel like doing anything. They were free to go whenever they wanted. And they did. Jason at 8:30 or so. Miranda, Eddie and Matt at 11ish, and Nikki at 12. I must apologize to Nikki for my napping, I couldn't help myself. In fact, I should probably still be sleeping, except I fell asleep on the couch, with my computer on my lap. I was awoken at 7 this morning when my mom woke up my brother. I guess that's what I deserve, should have went to my bed instead of the couch.   still, life is good

Forget My Name says:  ya maybe casue most girls do   can i touch you? says:  read the last paragraph on my site. it explains it.  Forget My Name says:  okie dokie  can i touch you? says:  make sense?  Forget My Name says:  you know that is the exact reason that no ever meets the girls that anderson is intersted in cause friends make small things into somethign that sometimes its not  can i touch you? says:  indeed. it can ruin things.  can i touch you? says:  just because you're both interested doesn't mean you should get married.

I mean, sure, you can say "if", and plan for an "if". But you must both realize it's a big "if".

      Hello. It's been quite a while since I've actually put anything of substance here. Yes.  I was supposed to call Sonja to get her new Edmonton number before she left. I was supposed to do that at 9:30, but I seem to have slept in. It is now 10:50. I will call her sister later and get it. I was out with them last night, well, I ended up with them. First I went in to Red Deer to meet Jenise. I was also supposed to meet up with Ashley and Chantelle and some other folk, but that never happened. Anywho, after getting to Catwalk with Jenise, we met up with some of the guys, and JP, Jason A, Skye and I ended up going over to Manhattans.  Some day, I'm going to wear a suit to the bar . This is where Sonja and Karin came in. It felt kinda like old times, but a thousand times better in a way. I really do miss those girls, well, actually, I miss all of the Rimbey people. Brodie, Jer, Mel, Shayna...yes. All of them. Meh, time goes on and friends get lost along the way. And still, there's some people, like the Hehli's, or Amanda, where you feel like no matter how much time passes, some things will never change. And that's a good feeling. I'm rambling.  The last week, I've spent almost as much time with Crystal as I have since we broke up. It's kind of nice, where we are now. The bitterness has almost faded, and we can get back to just being friends, talking about things, chilling on the couch watching TV, me doing her social homework.  I'm so used . I've also been spending a fair amount of time with Nikki. This makes me confused. I really do enjoy her company, but things have just kind of whirlwinded themselves into place, and I fear perhaps things have happened a little fast. I don't blame anyone for that, but as soon as everyone else found out we were both interested, it was just kind of assumed that we would date, and I don't know why. I mean, don't get me wrong, I would, and probably will. And with expectations like that from others, what do you do if you decide you don't really like the person like that and it was just a passing crush? I mean, so far, she's great, but what happens if in the short future, something changes, she thinks I'm an ass, or something else just doesn't seem right? How do you end something when you're in that situation? Oh Boy.   A  urlLink FRIEND  OF MINE ONCE WROTE:   It's painful to make someone cry. If you have any morals at all, seeing someone in pain and being the cause of it rips away at your own soul. Sometimes the pain you feel is more than their own. You can't condemn two people to a failing relationship. You have to be able to let go. Anything else is inhuman.  And how true it is, for a while, I relied on that fear without knowing it. I relied on Crystals fear of hurting me to keep the dying relationship on life support. And then with Krystal, it was me with the fear. I didn't want to hurt her, and so I led her on, which in the end, only hurt her more. Fear of hurting others is very real, and if left unconquered, it can do some serious damage...   And then there's my current beliefs on the "dating" situation. Titles, like "dating", they mean nothing. I don't think you can just start a relationship by mutually agreeing that you  should  be in a relationship. A relationship has to be something that grows from a friendship and just sort of evolves to a point when you think about that person enough, and feel enough for that person that there is actually a commitment. And that's my problem right now. As much as I want to be in a long term relationship, I don't know if I'm there emotionally enough for that yet. Last night, I felt so free, for the first time in a long while, there was little holding me back. And that is a good feeling.   I guess there's a few people I need to talk to, huh?

      ugh. too much to say. not enough time. will write tomorrow...promise.  until then, i leave you with this:  Name by Goo Goo Dolls   And even though the moment passed me by  I still can't turn away  'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose  Got tossed along the way  And letters that you never meant to send  Get lost or thrown away  And now we're grown up orphans  That never knew their names  We don't belong to no one  That's a shame  But if you could hide beside me  Maybe for a while  And I won't tell no one your name  And I won't tell 'em your name  Scars are souvenirs you never lose The past is never far  Did you lose yourself somewhere out there Did you get to be a star  And don't it make you sad to know that life Is more than who we are  You grew up way too fast  And now there's nothing to believe And reruns all become our history  A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio And I won't tell no one your name  And I won't tell 'em your name  I won't tell 'em your name  Mmm, mmm, mmm  I won't tell 'em your name... Ow!  I think about you all the time  But I don't need the same  It's lonely where you are come back down And I won't tell 'em your name

I'm working late again tonight. The mall closes at 5, but I guess I'll stay until 7, get the store looking snazzy.   Oh yeah, I found the best payday loan, my mom. :)

       an old piece of paper under my bed reads:   The rain hits my windshield. Because I'm in the parking lot. In the confusion of the past 24 hours, I showed up an hour early for work. I hate the way it rains. Only when I'm down. As if to mock me. And take away the last of the sunshine. Never leave, never sorry. Hate me because I cause the guilt that you should feel. Hate me. It will be easier for me.If you still love me, don't tell me now. Hate me for this moment. Let the anger you feel for me get inside you. Scream at me, but when it's all over, see what it is that you've broken, and remember, nothing ever falls. Nothing ever changes. And as shattered as I am right now, I'll still be here, with nothing but love. (originally written in August 2002).

      Over the next few weeks, you guys will probably be seeing some major changes on this site. Not only with the way it looks, but also in what you read. I'm trying to get back to how my "bigdumbgrin" page was. For those of you who never visited that site, it was more focused on stories and essays than the daily activities of my life, that's what my livejournal was for. In the next little while, I want to find a balance between the two on this page.   This is mostly Claytons fault, for asking me all those questions and making me go through the bigdumbgrin archives to find the answer to the religion question. It made me realize how much more fun it is to keep up a site like that.   and now to the shack...

      What are your spirtual beliefs? (Organised religion, God(ess), etc.) To answer this question, I will repost something I wrote on November 2, 2002.  You’ve been worrying about your faith for quite some time. I know you have, I’ve been watching. You no longer see the point. No reason to get caught up in religion and the such. There’s no room for individualism there. Sit. Kneel. Obey. You don’t like the idea of it all. I know you still believe in God. I know you still feel guilty in the middle of the night, while laying there awake, looking back on all the thing you’ve done. I know you still believe enough not to say there is no God. You know there is a God. However, religion, like all things, is man-made. This is what you believe, isn’t it? And so, if it’s man-made, how can it be perfect? How can it be true?   Once, you were so strong there. So much passion. So much love. Now what have you got? So much hate. So much rage. Apathy. Lethargy. All of that. And more. Or less. You hate organized religion. I know you do; I can feel it in you. The councils. The education. The politics. They’re not better there than anyone else in the world. They’re not any better. No, organized religion is not for you. Or for anyone, really. That’s just what they’re adjusted to. The world hates change.   I know you still need to worship. So you occasionally go back there, to their building, to their House of God. You go to celebrations, like Christmas, like Easter. And you still go a few Sundays a month. It can’t ruin you that way. I know, because I’ve seen it. I’ve seen you sitting there, reflecting quietly in your room. Your faith is pure there, with no one else around. No priest and his message. No Vatican Voodoo. Nobody with a show put on, singing, dancing, praying, just so everyone can see them and say “Boy, are they ever a good Christian”. No. Maybe your faith isn’t as strong as theirs. But then again, it might be, because it’s true.    What do you WANT to be when you grow up, really not actually. (astronaut, actor, mime, stripper, ballerina) I don't really have any definate plans on what I want to be when I grow up, I just want to be happy and successful with whatever I do.    How do you respond to these worldly issues? War-  The only purpose of war is to boost the ego of those in power. Sometimes, I guess war is justified, when there is a real threat. Most of the time though, war is useless. The war in Iraq, for example. Sure, "the good guys" won, and they did it quickly, but what you don't see is how many innocent people died to remove a dictator who gave them free healthcare and free education.  Poverty-  Poverty is an inescapable side effect of capitalism.   Gay marriage-  I think that people should be albe to do whatever they want, so long as they are not harming anyone else. Sure, gay people should be allowed to get married and live long and happy lives together. By "allowed to get married", I mean by a judge or a ship's captain. Catholics, Christians, they're allowed to believe whatever they want, and if they don't want to marry gays, then they shouldn't have to. New laws that are coming into effect could technically send priests to jail for refusing to marry gay couples. That is wrong. As long as there is some sort of legal binding, like with a judge, then that should suffice.  Legalizing Marijuana-  Again, people should be allowed to do whatever they desire, so long as they aren't harming other people. In a basement, in a garage, sure, why not. If you want to pollut yourself like that, then fine, have at it. However, it should carry laws that would make it illegal to be stoned in public, especially around areas like playgrounds and schools and the such.   What does your faminly look like in the future? (Spouse, children, pet,etc.) I would like to be married somewhere between the age of 21 and 25, but do not desire children until at least 3 or 4 years after that. I'd rather wait a little while and be financially stable before starting a family, not just so I can drive a nice car instead of an old beater truck, but also so my children have the opportunity to attend which ever school they want, wherever they want. And so my family and I have the opportunity to spend time together like holidays and such. I want to live in an average house with a paved driveway and a basketball hoop. Maybe even a dog.    Are you a party animal or a classy swindig kinda person? I have my moments of both, but if I had to choose, I'd probably pick black tie events over a night in the club or some house party.    If you could have any car or truck in the world, what would it be? 2003 Monte Carlo or 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer.    What would you do if you won the lottery? Spend none of it, invest in a few business ventures and build a business empire (damn capitalism, eh?).    What does your fantasy wedding look like? Whatever my bride to be and the wedding planner come up with.

      Where do you draw that line? When does seeing someone casually become dating them, and when does dating them become a serious relationship. It's a line that I'm being quite careful not to cross, but I think I may have crossed it already.  I know I crossed it with the last two. I tried not to, I tried to keep things platonic, or at least very very casual. It could never last that way, though. As soon as some one, him or her, or both. takes their pants off, the relationship is pretty much over, because you've crossed the line. I'm not saying that is the line. No, the line comes way before that. I'm just saying that once you get there, the line has obviously already been crossed. And when you cross the line there's only two directions you can take. Either you're ready for some kind of relationship, or things fall apart and crumble away and you never see her again.  I am a firm believer that people should be allowed to do whatever they desire, so long as they are not harming anyone else, or anyone eles's property in the process. Yet look at me, I choose to hurt people. I hurt her, and her, and her. And now it comes to you. I don't want to hurt you, but is it avoidable? Really? Do you think there's anyway to overcome the emotional roadblocks that have been placed in front of me? The ones that make me tremble in fear at the mere mention of the word "girlfriend"?  All I can do is stand here, alone, in the middle of it all, and apologize.   Apologies will never be able to turn back time

      Good morning. Shit, it's been a long time since I posted, and I really don't have a ton to say. I spent an evening with Crystal on Friday. Interesting to say the least, but at least now we know where each other stands.   Meh. Things have been progressing with Nikki. Progress scares me. I am very...i don't know what I am.  Perhaps I'll say something more tomorrow morning, perhaps not.    I hate this kind of post

      The question has been asked many times before, and answered differently just as many times. A true friend is defined differently by different people based on their beliefs and values.  To me, a true friend is someone who will stand by you through anything, even if they disagree with what you're doing there in the first place. A friend is someone who will try to protect you when you refuse to protect yourself. A friend will take your abuse time and time again and forgive you every single time. A friend will let you go when you say you need to go explore the world alone, and will reply with a simple: "I love you and will be waiting here for your return". A true friend would take a bullet for you on a seconds notice.  That is what a friend is to me. And I would die for almost every one i know. Don't doubt it for a second.

      She says to me that she doesn't really know herself, and that is her problem. Yes. I can see that being a problem. Not knowing who you are or what you want or even what you like. Those can be some pretty big obstacles sometimes.   But really. How many people out there really know themselves? I don't know who I am. I know what I'm not. I'm not skungy hotel rooms and cheap thrills. I'm not a fighter and I'm not someone to hold a grudge. I'm not really anything at the moment, and I suppose that is depressing to some degree. I don't know. I'm just rambling, so I will leave. Do you know who you are?   how the heck did my room get so messy?

       Sunday, May 26, 2003         Does anyone know what an IP address is? It's 4 numbers used to ID your computer (there's a bigger explanation, if you want it, look it up). Anyway, Haloscan records these IP addresses so that I can go back and see who posts from what computer. Using this method, I have found anonymous. It saddens me to know the true identity of this person, as I feel a great friendship has come to an end. Oh well. Easy come, easy go.        posted at 5/26/2003 07:00:16 PM       urlLink  postCount('whoyouare');

      Ok. A few things to get straight here. So you think it's sad about how I sulk about my ex-girlfriend. Take a look at my last few posts...it has been quite some time since I've actually written about her. Sure, I still feel some feelings of sadness, but look, THEY'RE NOT FUCKING ON HERE, RETARD. Fools around with others eh? Yeah, so it was a mistake. It was done out of lust and anger, and I apologize to those who got hurt. So unless you're her, then it doesn't fucking concern you. And besides, I didn't sleep with her and tell her I didn't like her like that. I slept with her and told her it happened way too fast and I wasn't ready for that. Then she left and found Chad or Dom or whatever his name is. I am very happy that she's happy with him. SO SHUT THE FUCK UP IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE GOD DAMMED STORY. Yes, I was holding hands with Nikki a couple days ago. And yes, I kiss her occasionally too. So sue me for trying to move on with my life (isn't that what you want me to do, is try to move on, DUH!). She knows where I stand, and where she stands. We're being careful not to let things get out of hand before I'm ready for anything serious. So again, if you don't know the whole fucking story, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! By the way, Nobody else here seems to have a problem putting their name, regardless of what they have to say. If you're going to talk trash about me, fine, maybe I deserve it, but at least have the decency to reveal your identity. Even if it is only to me, I will keep your name off the site if you just drop me an e-mail containing your name.   in response to a previous anonymous commenter  i personaly think its sad how he sulks about his ex girlfriend and then fools around with others, telling them he likes them, then acting all confused and not forgeting about the past and not giving the other girl a chance. In fact i think its sad how he sleep with another girl, tells her he doesnt like her like that and leaves her in the dark. Starts bitching about his ex some more of how much he wants her back while a couple days ago hes holding hands with ANOTHER girl. Not his ex, nor the girl he slept with. Yeah i say hes got some issues to work on.

      And so what's done is done. There's only so many times I can say I'm sorry before I move on.  I think this is my best template thus far. I really like it. I promise I'll get all the links working, and some content of some sort in the columns. Any suggestions, anyone? So tonight, I'm supposedly going to Edwards to watch a movie. I'm sure it'll be a rocking time. Although I don't know if I really want to look at a screen for two more hours. This computer has only left my lap for a few seconds to go to the bathroom since I got home at around 4 o clock this evening. Disgusting I say.  I have nothing to say, and the only purpose of even posting tonight was to point out the new template to you guys. I know how observant some of you are sometimes;). But seriously. Any content suggestion would be appreciated.

      And so my boss is pissed at me for two very stupid reasons. Reason number one. On Monday, I called Bryce on his cell because I had to open the store. Since I was gone all weekend, I had no key, so I figured I'd just stop by Bryce's house and pick one up. Bryce answered his cell and told me he was in Edmonton, and Aaron was supposed to get a hold of me to arrange to get me a key. Aaron had never called, so I had no key. I couldn't get a hold of Aaron because I didn't know his phone number. And my boss got mad at Bryce and I when Aaron didn't bother to do what he said he was going to. Then, he knew I didn't have a key and that Bryce was out of town, and he still didn't bother to even show up to unlock the store. And somehow it's my fault. The second reason my boss is mad at me is because of yesterday. I was scheduled to work 9-4. Fine. Then he asked me to stay later to clean the store and get it ready for the president of the company (who was supposed to show up sometime today). That's fine. I stayed until 6:30, thinking I was making overtime. Turns out, I wasn't even getting paid after 4 o clock. So I walked out. Now, how can he be mad at me for that? I don't know, but he is.  That's my rant.  Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped Crystal with studying for her social exams. She keeps telling me about her current situation with this Jew guy. Not that he's Jewish, I don't think he is, that's just a nickname. As far as I can tell, anyway. At any rate, she keeps asking what she should do, and it really hurts me that I can't offer her a fair opinion. Any input I would have into the situation would be biased. Biased in the way that I can't tell her to go for it, because my personal opinion is that she shouldn't. But the reason that my personal opinion stands there is because I still want her. So, I can't possibly tell her to go another way. It just wouldn't work.  That's my other rant.  I'm done now.

        Is it worth it?   That is the question that he asked. This man, Steve Vandegriff, he may have saved my life today. Not by pushing me out of the way of a speeding bus, nor by single handedly taking down a mad gunman with me in the crosshairs. He didn't save my life by stopping me from eating that sandwich in the back of my car. Rather, he saved my life by asking me that simple question. Granted, he didn't ask it directly to me, but I was there. I was part of the audience he was speaking to, and he may as well been speaking to me alone. I was spellbound and amazed by the words this man was speaking. Is it worth it? Smoking, drugs, booze, sex. He was asking  me  if any of it was worth it. I just don't know anymore. I've been feeling like crap lately, and there hasn't really been an explanation for it. Nothing in my physical habits, such as sleep or eating have really changed. So why then, has the sky above been left with so many clouds? Could it have been the lack of God? Could it have been?  So many words entered my head this weekend, but most of them left just as quickly. There is only a few key phrases that left the building with me today. "Is it worth it" is one of them. Another: "God hates religion". Another: "The church of the next generation may be so radically different from the structure we know today, that Christianity may be unrecognizable from what it is today". And yet another: "...maybe it's a relationship that you need to break off". It wasn't just the speakers that affected me this weekend either. It was other youth attending the event. "I hate Christians, they're the fakest people I know". "This is what I mean, He's preaching about how much God loves me again".  "It's so traditional, so structured, but and it's all they know".  This is what I've concluded: We need to change the face of Christianity in a radical way. We need to make it relevant to the next generation. Relevant in a way that it is unrecognizable from what it is today. We need to stop talking about Jesus, and start demonstrating about Jesus. Gandhi once said "I like your Christ. I hate your Christians, they are very much unlike your Christ".  How true it is. We, all, every single person who believes in Jesus Christ, we all need to commit ourselves in a radical and refreshing way. We need to stop talking the talk and start walking the walk. Christians have become so two faced, so corrupt, and so much like everyone else, that we have lost all power to the forces of evil. He have lost the attention of so many, and so many have been conquered by sin and Satan. We must sacrifice ourselves for the sake of these unfortunate. WE MUST CHANGE!  I know I've spoken these words before. You know the one's, about a renewed faith in Jesus Christ, about wanting to change, about changing the direction in my life. And every time, it's lasted about a week. Until the next party or the next time I jump in bed with someone. Well you know what? I'm sick of it. I'm sick of chasing my tail and lying to myself. This time, this time I'm going to do my best. I'm going to try harder than I ever have before. Because honestly,   IS IT WORTH IT????

      You call the first gay marriage in Canada an embarrasment? I find it splendid! It shows a great step towards the liberation of all human life.   I, personally, believe in the bible's teaching about homosexuality, that it is morally wrong to "lay with a man as you would a woman". And so, I do pray for gays and lesbians everywhere, that they would one day see the true way and that God will guide them in the proper direction.   However, as a "free country", we must allow things such as gay marriage. Many have suffered and died for our religious and personal freedoms. If you look at the majority of third world countries, they have a forced religion, they have very limited freedoms. Yes, it is great to live in a country where we are allowed to practice Christianity, but we must keep it out of our political system, because that is not what this country is. I think it would be fantastic if every single person in the world lived by the words in the Bible and the teachings of Christ, however, while we must remain vocal about our faith, we can not ram it down others throats against their will. You expect satanists and bhuddists and african tribes people to keep their religion out of their dealings with politics, so why is it so much to ask as politician to leave his Christianity at the door?    Christians can be tyrants, too

      Much better. This kind of weather makes me really happy.It makes me want to not be a homebody, it makes me want to go out and burn my gas and spend what little money I have left. This weather makes me feel like I should either be a) heading to work at A&W or b) Waiting for Skye to either walk or ride his bike over to my house for a day of lazing around at the beach, looking at women we would never have the guts to actually approach. Hmmm. The joys of summer time. I often think I'd love to move someplace warm, like florida or cali, where it would be like this year round. But then, in the grand scheme of things, I think we all need to go through winters. Times of cold and depression. Isolation and lonliness. We need to experince things like that in order to truly appreciate days like today. It is really beautiful out here.  Last night, it was Clayton's birthday. 19. Jeez. We are getting so old. Anyhow. Amanda is in town as well, so she came, and it was great. We didn't do anything super-special, just went to Bramleys for a bit. Ashlyn, Matt, Clayton, Amanda. Eddie. Miranda. So many memories there. And Nikki. Well, someday I'll be able to look back when I see her and think the same thing, but as for right now, she's just a cool newbie. You learn something new everyday. And last night, I learned something new about myself. I will never be attracted to the "hot girl". Sure, there's plenty of physically attractive girls out there. But the really "hot" ones. Super skinny, super skanky. Tight clothes. No clothes. It just doesn't work for me. The hottest girl at the bar last night wasn't all dressed up special. She was wearing semi-baggy pants and a t-shirt. Hair tied up into a simple ponytail. I think there's tons of guys out there who share the same sentiments as me when it comes to that kind of stuff. Sluttier is not necessarily better. Showing self-respect is also a very important thing.  The other night, I went over to Crystals. I was supposed to help her study, but she didn't feel like it, and there's no arguing with that girl. There never has been. I took her to McDonalds. And we went to Chapters. She wouldn't let me leave the magazine rack for almost an hour while she scoured hair magazines for a picture she had seen earlier. She never did find it. Later, we went for a walk. A walk in the rain. And as the worms crawled out of the ground and into the streets, she told me of her situation. Her current boy situation, things about Mike and Janelle and their situation. Most of it, I found very interesting. We hugged at the end of the night. I miss those hugs.  sI'm looking down my street. Just from what I can see there's 5 houses for sale. One of them is sold. If my parents ever get their shit together, there's supposed to be on in front of my house soon. Every one is moving. Everything is changing.   seasons change with time, feelings come and go

      I've decided to get another job. A part time job to supplement my current income. Because my current income is just not cutting it. Sigh. I think I can handle another 15-25 hours a week. It's not like I have anywhere important to be. I never go anywhere important like Calgary or Edmonton. I don't really have any relationships that require a huge amount of maintenance. I think I'm going to apply at the Bay. It'd be swell to have two jobs in the same mall...so convenient. If not there, then something on the southside.

She puts on eye shadow A deeper shade, a deeper shade of blue And then she gets in bed with you Man, sometimes I get the feeling so left out And then I'm here again I'm crying in my beer again Loneliness closes down like a jail This is a lonely tale I'm singing in my jail cell She's got a smile so wide to ease the pain The pain I'm going through And then she gets in bed with you She's brand new, she's brand new, she's brand new We walk Manhattan in a dark silver suit In the blowing wind, no demons persecuted And in the darkness, candle light across my face In my mind I see... She's got a smile so wide it eats the pain The pain I'm going through And then she gets in bed with you She's brand new, she's brand new, she's brand new Man, sometimes I get the feeling so left out But then I'm here again I'm crying in my beer again Loneliness closes down like a jail This is a lonely tale This is a jail cell She puts on eye shadow A deeper shade, a deeper shade of blue I'm very pleased with meeting you She's got a smile so wide to ease the pain The pain I'm going through But then she gets in bed with you

      Not long ago, I had a conversation with someone about this website. I was asked if these feelings, there entries, if they are how I really feel. She apologized if they were, for causing some of the thoughts that I had posted on here, mainly "The Ex-Game".  I suppose by now you know who it was, but it doesn't matter. I explained to her that sometimes I come up with something, such as the "Ex-Game", and want to write about it, so I find a way to relate it to my life. Well, recently, while looking through the archives of a website I frequent, I found something that explains it pefectly:   urlLink link

      And so that's how the night went. It started off with me leaving work an hour early because I'm sick of that god dammned place. Bryce was off at 5, and I was supposed to be off at 6, so I just left and 5 with Bryce. For a while, we just hung around the malls. I went and showed him how much better the other RadioShack is. Then, back at Bower Mall, I seen Shayna. I think she looks really different, but she still looks good. Hm. It was just kind of a "hey" in passing type thing. After she walked by I decided I should have asked her to come out with us, but, alas, it was too late, she was already down the hallway. Good times with that girl...sort of. I guess as good as a 15 year old can have. It was really bizarre to see her, because I had just ran an internet search on her a few days before. Now, don't think I'm going all stalker, I've just been thinking a lot lately about people and where they've ended up, and I know if you type my name into Google, you will find me very easily. I was simply seeing if perhaps a few people from days long dead may also be found as easily. They are not. Although I did find this photo.    The girl with the cow on the left is Sonja Hehli. Ha. Neat.  At any rate. Then Bryce and I decided to go to the pawn shop and get some money. So we pawned a voice recorder and a discman. We got 25 bucks and it's gonna cost 31 to get it all back. That's not really that bad. After a meal at McDonalds, we went on a quest to find skull shaped cup holders for my car. We failed miserably.  As the evening progressed, we ended up back at Jamie's house (Bryce's girlfriend). Her cat is really cute. It's still a kitten so it's all small and playful. Bryce and almost fit it's head in his mouth. Then blah blah blah, headed to Billy Bob's. I love that place so much. I gave everyone a speech on the perils of chocolate cake and opening the fridge... meh. Bramley's, beach night, bikini contest, slutty chicks, blah blah blah.    teach me to be happy, teach me to love again. My heart may be in other places right now, but with love you can move a mountain, so why not a heart?

      I have nothing to say tonight.  I will just leave you with some Foo Fighters.      Everlong    Hello,  I've waited here for you...  Everlong. Tonight, I throw myself into, And out of the red, out of her head she sang.  Come down and waste away with me, down with me... Slow how, you wanted it to be, I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.  And I wonder when I sing along with you, If everything could ever feel this real forever. If anything could ever be this good again, The only thing I'll ever ask of you. You gotta promise not to stop when I say when. She sang:  Breathe out, so I can breathe you in, Hold you in, and now, I know you've always been  Out of your head, out of my head I sang.  And I wonder when I sing along with you, If everything could ever feel this real forever, If anything could ever be this good again. The only thing I'll ever ask of you, You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.

      sometimes when i reflect back on all the beer i drink i feel ashamed. then i look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. if i didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. then i say to myself, 'it is better that i drink this beer and let their dreams come true than to be selfish and worry about my liver.'  from j.h. http://morg13-2.signmyguestbook.com/

      I've invented a new game. It's called the Ex-Game. No, it doesn't invlove skateboards or rollerblades. Sure, rock music is an option, but not required. There are no banners promoting the newest energy drink littering the fences. In fact, there are no fences. Step one to the ex game, is to get an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend. Then, have a contest to see who can do the most damage to the other. Weapons of choice include: Weblogs, similar to this one. Being seen with members of the opposite sex, or better yet, the same sex. Asking your ex for dating and relationship advice. Sleeping with as many people in as short of time as possible.  And so on. This is the ex-game. Which I appear to be losing.  Today, what a horrible day it was today. One of those "I-should-have-stayed-in-bed-and-watched-the-price-is-right-days". Except of course, that today is Sunday, and The Price Is Right only airs on weekdays. I worked alone today, and had to go to the bathroom like you wouldn't believe. Of course, on Sunday, there isn't a single moment when there isn't  someone  in the store, so I couldn't even close for a few minutes. That kind of pressure just makes you hate everyone who sets foot in your store.  I'm sick today, as well. I think it's a combination between my neck, the lack of sleep, and the heat. I know it's not that hot out, but lately I've been feeling very sensitive to heat. I'm not sure why.  Yesterday, it has been 3 months since I began living the single life. Three. that's a quarter of a year. How time flies when you're not having fun. Also, today, is exactly half way through the year 2003. I haven't fulfilled a single New Years Resolution. Oh my.

      Alright, first off. Some conversations have led me to believe that there is some confusion over my beliefs. If anyone has been offended or confused by anthing I say, especially if it seems like i'm contradicting myself, just drop me a line or give me a call or talk to me in person. I hate it when people are confused about me.  That said, I can move on to this night's entry. I just got back from Amanda's house. It was nice, just Clay, Nikki, Ash, Manda and I all sitting around a fire, chattin it up about various things. I've been having some really good conversations lately. It makes me happy. Crystal always used to hate that I could never speak my mind if I wasn't writing. I think I'm starting to fix that shortcoming. Well, yay me!  I took a nap this afternoon. Or evening. It was nice, I haven't had a nap for a long time. It reminded me of a day a while ago that Crystal and I were just laying on her couch, watching Oprah, and she fell asleep there in the middle of the afternoon. I felt happy after I woke up. Tonight, I'm going to turn off the computer before I go to bed, and I'm going to set the sleep timer on the TV and turn the light off. It should be a good sleep. I haven't had a good sleep for a while now. Last night was the worst sleep I've had in weeks. Damn couches and other people. I hate the feeling of being so incredibly uncomfortable, but at the same time don't want to move because you don't want to disturb someone else. Worst feeling in the world.    it makes me sad to read these words, because I've tried so hard and they've done nothing   Good night.

      Ahhh....home again, home again, jiggidy jig.   Friday Night Apathy.   So there I was, just working away, minding my own business, when who comes in? An Ashlyn and a Sonja. Short story shorter, I ended up going to the bar with Danielle and Ashlyn. I never realized how much I miss Danielle until last night. Her and I get along well enough. Guh. Came home, slept for a while, and went to work on my day off. *surprise, surprise*.    Saturday Night Vomit With Karin  Bryce and I were off at the same time on Saturday night. We started drinking around 7ish. We talked to one of his friends from Edmonton on MSN, and he decided that he should be there, so he came down here. By this time Bryce and I had invented a game. The game is to jump really high and let the ceiling fan hit you in the head. We headed out to the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find KARIN HEHLI! She found me, eating a hotdog in an alley. My last post is a song I have been listening to a lot lately. It's how I feel these days. I had coffee with Crystal the other day, and I think I finally feel how I'm supposed to feel towards her. Instead of all sad and depressed about the fact that we broke up, I'm happy for the fact that I know her and that I had the chance to be a part of her life. That's how it's supposed to be. It's easier for everyone that way. At any rate. I also feel like I want a new girl. A girl like Karin.  NOT necessarily Karin  (circumstance has a funny way of fucking you over that way), but a girl like her. Someone that you feel comfortable with. And not comfort from familiarity, just plain old comfort, the kind where it doesn't matter if you've hardly seen the person in the past year, you can still be completely your self. The kind of person who will ditch her friends on the dance floor to stand by the door with you while you decide whether or not you're going to vomit up the hotdog you ate in the alley. Crystal was not like that, and though I did love her, I can see now what she saw. We weren't the people each other wanted us to be... ANYHOW, that's where I stand on that issue.   Sunday at the Shack  Sunday Morning, I went to work. Still a little drunk, i suppose. Work was work was work. Then it was time for inventory at the other RadioShack. Bryce's sister, Ashley was down for the day, and so she came with to help. I felt really sorry for her. Bryce had this big idea to go get drunk after, but since we didn't get out of there until 1 in the morning, it was a short lived period of drunkeness. Bryce and Jamie left for Jamies house, leaving Ashley and I alone. We talked for a while about religion and the such, and why or why not there is a God. We got bored. And you know what people do when they get bored......MAKE NOODLES!!! We made two packages of noodles in one bowl, and due to the fact that we can't even cook noodles proper, we only ate about three bits each and decided that was enough. Bed time it was. This morning came far too early.  Monday Night Sleep Now.  Ahhh...my own bed, for an entire night. Here I come....  nite, world.

      Alright. Here I am, I'm sitting down. And I'm writing.  Crystal's grad was on Thursday. The ceremonies were longer and more boring than last year. Although I did get to miss a part of it because the silly girl forgot to change the batteries in her digital camera, so I went to work and got her some more. The banquet was good though. I got to see a lot of people that I know, either from going to school there (which isn't many), or from youth group related functions (which is a few). The music sucked at the dance afterwards, so Crystal decided to leave. We had a pretty good talk in the car I think, about where our lives are at these days, what we're feeling. It almost seems like she's relieved to finally have me over her. Well. Yay us.  Karin was supposed to come out and play on Saturday night, but she wasn't allowed. I don't quite understand her parents. If my kid was leaving for some far away place, I would ecourage them to go out and have a good time before they left, not try and keep them in the house. But that's just me, perhaps I'm just a little off in that way. So what did I do Saturday night...I don't remember. Oh yeah, I remember. Bryce and I boycotted the bar and played Street Fighter all night.  Sunday. Meh. Went to work. Got off work. Came home. Bryce called. Went downtown with him and Jamie and Amber. Sylvan was too crowded, so we went to uhm...The Blarney Stone, then to Branleys. Woke up at 9 with the worst hang over I've ever had. Went to work.  Blah blah blah.  Last night, went to Gull Lake with Karin and Sonja and some of their friends. It was a good time. Short, but good. Then to the bars. I wasn't really in the mood for the bars, and I'm sure it kinda showed, but that's alright. Ha. I had written that sentence, and not more than 20 seconds later, Crystal told me I looked sad last night...so yeah, I guess it did show. Meh.   Canada Day. Let's go thrust ourselves into a drunken stupor and stumble around downtown! YAY for resort towns!

      i don't know what to say, yet I feel I should be saying something.  i want to play in the rain, but i have no playmate.  words are my chosen medium. for words, really, do not exist. sure, there are markings on paper or symbols on a screen, but who owns a word? you can't put a word in a jar. You can't smell a word or taste a word. Words are simply the keys. Triggers that cause reactions in your brain. words are not material.  since i am lacking a playmate, tonights agenda: 1. put selected pieces of poetry up for the world to ravage. 2. become a creative genius. 3. deny the existence of the middle class. 4. to be announced.  despise the judgmental. art.  real? perhaps.  civil? of course.

      I got a phone call the other day. Apparently, after sitting on a waiting list for quite some time, I was offered a seat in the journalism course at SAIT. I had to decline. As much as I would love to move to Calgary right now, it simply isn't feasible. The notice is too short, the money isn't there. And to top it all off, I don't think that's what I want to do anymore. Oh well, as is life. I think I would rather take out a loan and get a car anyway. My car is dying a slow, painful and drawn out death. Stupid thing.  Now, I am going for ice cream.

      Is tomorrow Friday? Tomorrow is Friday. I am going in to work tomorrow. To "Power-Up" the computer speaker section. It is part of my AssMan training. To "Power-Up" a section of the store. Sure sounds like a clever ploy to make me do actual work for a change. Meh. It's not all bad, at least I'll get the money...no wait, I'm off tomorrow, no money. Well, self-satisfaction at least. But when was the last time self-satisfaction ever bought a pretty lady lunch?  After I'm done that, the staff of RadioShack 5868 will be heading out to Boston Pizza to spend our well earned cellular bonus gift certificates. Not the ideal way to spend a Friday night, but I guess free food isn't such a bad thing, and perhaps I was invited to the Country Club by Stacee and Lindsay tomorrow night. Might just take them up on that offer.  Chantelle and the hot-girl-whos-name-i-can-never-remember...Ashley...came in to RadioShack today and I went and ate lunch with them. Chantelle I think is one of my favorite people right now. She's so friendly, and is also a direct link back to another best summer of my life (the one previous to the one discussed in the last entry).  Tonight, on my way out of the mall, I hear this female voice yelling at me (it's been happening a lot lately, all calling my name to get my attention, but they're all attached). "Tanner", the voice called. I stopped, looked around, surprised. There is a pretty girl sitting on the curb, looking up at me. "Do you remember me?". How could I forget such a pretty face? I'm not sure, but I did. All I could say was "No". But as soon as I said it I remembered. Melissa Derksen. She's the reason I know Shyla, Collette, and the better part of all my Red Deer friends. All because she wanted to talk to me at the dAYZ wAGE concert so long ago. I sat down beside her on the curb and started to talk. I've been taking every opportunity to work on my conversation skills. One thing I've really been trying to work on is talking about the other person, making them tell me everything about them. I guess all that sales training has been paying off. Ha. But seriously, I have been trying to ask them questions, and if they say something that happened to them, I ask more questions about it. She said something about scewing up at work, then stopped talking. I asked her how she screwed up, and she seemed surprised, almost shocked, that someone would want to know. Then her boyfriend (as far as I could tell) pulled up in his car, and I wasn't surprised that she would feel that. From what I see, he doesn't seem like the type that would care. That's not my problem though.  I'm going to get a haircut tomorrow.

      I haven't been sleeping that well the last few nights, and I'm not sure why. I guess I have been sleeping in some sense of the word, but it's not a deep sleep, full of dreams and continous wakings. I can't believe I still dream about her as much as I do. I haven't even had a real conversation with her in over two years, and yet there she is, in my dreams once every three or four weeks. I heard she was moving to Texas, and though I harbour no romantic feelings for her and never talk to or see her, it still makes me a little sad to know that she's going to be that far away. To me, she is the direct link back to one of the best summers of my life. Yes, the summer was full of emotions, some of them good, and some of them bad, and really, I don't know what I was thinking, things could have been fantastic if it hadn't been for my refusal, or perhaps lack of courage to kiss the girl. Story of my life you know. Two amazing, beautiful girls, both lost to me because I couldn't find the nerve to kiss them. Well, I suppose that's how things go when you're young. And stupid. Ah well, so the cookie crumbles, and anyway, I am happy with the way the last two years have turned out. Perhaps minus the last three of four months, but what happens happens, and you must just move on.   Crystal updated in her journal sometime last night, and I'm glad to hear that she's been doing well. It seems that everywhere she goes, people fall in love with her. She never saw it before, and she would never believe me when I told her that everyone did love her. She is perfect. She does have a lot to offer the right person, and is great in many other areas as well...hm. I'm glad to hear that she's ok. (and about Mike Diemand, that turd *evil cackle*). Guh.  Well, I guess I should drag my ass out of bed and do something constructive. I have a huge AssMan training binder sitting on my table that I should go through. Hooray for Assistant Managers. Gag.

      I need a girl in my life. I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Not just any girl, either. A dream girl. Like the girl who will remain unnamed at the grocery store. Or the other girl who will remain unnamed who is a friend of a friend of mine. I miss having a reason to go out, and I miss having someone to spend the night with. I haven't woken up beside someone and felt happy for quite a while now. I don't really miss the girl that much anymore, but i surely miss the feeling.  Guh. Search for a roomate is slow and unproductive.   the two of you. the two i've always loved but could never have. the notes are in the drawer. will never be the same

      Modelling is such a tough business to break into. She started so many years ago, and has still not found her fame, nor her fortune. She has tried so many different areas. Runway, magazine, soft-core porn, and even those lame ads for car dealerships and online casinos. And so here she is. Sitting silently in that bar where her and her friends would waste away their Saturday nights all those years ago, she silently sips a Caeser, stirring the drink slowly with the stalk of celery.   Bankrupt. How did that happen? Divorced. Didn't even see it coming. She took everything. The money, the money is nothing. His entire life has been a constand cycle of bankruptcy, turning life around, amassing huge amounts of wealth, and losing it all over again. The kids. That is what hurts. She took the kids and moved back to New York, leaving him here, alone, in a house that is about to be repossessed by the bank. Not that the house matters to him, either. The money he made and everything he ever bought was always for her. Life has always felt so empty for him. This bar reminds him of the places him and his friends would stop at on their long road trips. How he longed for those days back, just him and his three best friends, cruising around the country in Scott's 15 passenger van.   Old man sitting in a young man's bar. That's how she would describe the guy. After some careful thought, she realizes that's exactly how she must look, sitting here, all by herself, watching the girls dancing while the boys fight over who will buy which one a drink. Nothing has changed here. The boys still all watch the one or two girls who know how to shake their ass the best, while the smart girls with subtle, but still sexy features go unnoticed by all the a few guys. She always wanted to meet one of those guys, but the modelling profession that consumed the better part of her life always prevented it. Everyone she came in contact with just wanted to do drugs, have sex, and brag about her to their friends. The old man sitting in a young man's bar looks over at her, and she quickly looks away.   Those eyes. There's something about those eyes. Vaguely familiar, from a time long ago. She saw him looking at her, she turned away almost as quickly as he did. She obviously had a few years behind her, but she was still goregeous. God, how many women had he looked at in this exact same way? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? Instead of looking at everyone of the opposite gender as a potential mate or girlfriend, try looking at them as a sister in Christ. That's what the priest had told him all those years ago, before the road trips, before the binge drinking, before the one night stands. Thirteen years old. What a great time it was for him. The friends he had then had never really been replaced, though as his belief in things such as God and Heaven waned over the years, he fell out of contact with them. Sure, he still believed in a God of some sort, but not the same one they did. And so, they prayed and prayed for him. Those were the days. Before the internet exploded into consumer culture, before the wars initiated by the cowboy president in Afghanistan and Iraq and Korea and a few years later in Cuba and China. One of his friends from elementary school had been killed in action in China. What was his name again?   He sits. Stroking the cat. He is bored. Life has been feeling so wasted lately. Such educational pursuits as downloading porn and listening to "You're Pretty When I'm Drunk" by the Bloodhound Gang just aren't fulfilling him anymore. People fill their lives with such trivial things. A young woman flashes on his screen. Such a beautiful lady, reduced to nothing more than a nameless promotion for an equally nameless casino. Gambling never really appealed to him. As he is about to close the window that has interrupted his game of solitare, he notices her eyes. Beautiful. Shimmering. Sad. He doubts she was supposed to look sad, and without a real close inspection, you wouldn't be able to see it. He wonders what she is doing at that very moment.  Sitting at home, reading the TV Guide, not really wanting to watch TV, but with the shoot tomorrow, she can't go out. Dark circles under eyes are surely  not  a models best friend. She settles on a re-run of a sitcom she grew tired of long ago. She's reminded of high school, and Nathan Moore. Her first, and only true love. His real name was Johnathan. They would spend endless summer nights under the stars, watching meteor showers or just watching the stars inch slowly accross the sky until the sun would come up. Some nights, she hated the sun. She hated the fact that it meant he had to leave. But he did leave. And later, she would walk away from him, leaving him kneeling there with a diamond engagment ring. She would never see him again, although she tried.      Here. It's an unfinished rough draft. Heh. Get it? I will leave it here unti it's done. I will change it and add to it when i get the chance. It's a rough draft. I get it.

       Taking things for more than what they're worth   And there we were, trapped together, surrounded by the things I've come to hate and the things she will learn to despise. Funny, how we are revolted the most by the very things that allow us to survive. He was talking. Not really to either of us, and neither of us was really listening, both of us, or myself anyway, off in some other world. We stood there, side by side, pretending to care to what this poor man was saying. I remember not what he said, nor what he looked like. And there we were. My sleeves were rolled up, revealing my forearm. She wore a t-shirt, revealing the better part of her entire arm. I crossed my arms, trying to convey my feelings of impatience to this man who would not cease his jabber. At that momen, she took a step. A small one, but a step none the less. Towards me. She leaned in, and her arm brushed against mine. I felt it coming before it happened, and did not move, neither towards or away from her. Contact was made, and as is expected from accidental physical contact, I was fully prepared for her to move away suddenly. I was pleasantly surprised when she didn't. Rather, she held the position for roughly ten seconds. The man stopped talking, obviously satisfied that he had conveyed the message he was trying to get across. With this, I took a step away, and we both went our seperate ways.

       Undialed   We forget things so easily. Time spent together, chemistry, daily rituals no longer needed, people. So, I don't miss you all that much, and I don't suppose you miss me either. Wait. That previous statement may have been a lie. I do miss you, yet still, I don't call. It is easy to forget things. Out of sight, out of mind. Or at least out of touch. So we mix and we mingle with our new contacts and pretend that nothing had ever happened between us and that we are merely two people who once shared a few moments, even if they were, and will be, some of the most important moments and steps in our entire lives. And how. There is a large difference between pretending to be what we said we'd be. There is no real explanation for the actions we find ourselves performing. I need you as much as I ever did, but in a very different way. And I believe you still need me to play some role in your life, albeit a much, much different role than I had at one time become so comfortable in playing. Playing. That's what we were doing, I suppose. Playing with fate and love and eternity and mortality. Playing grown up when really we were only children. Young, and naive. This is the point that was so hard to prove, but only to ourselves. And so I miss you, and you miss me, this we have admitted. And still. The phone remains silent, and also remains undialed.

       hello all, sorry for the lengthy period between posts. I found this today, and found it rather amusing. let me know what you think. it originally appeared in the April 2003 issue of Details magazine, and is written by none other than the great Bill Maher.     I have some questions about fucking kids. Not that I want to do it, or that I even think about it - I'm not nearly that religious. But apparently a lot of people do, since it seems to be in the news pretty much on a weekly basis (and across such a wide spectrum of society: clergy, rock stars, U.N. inspectors), and I'd like to know why.   I'd also like to know if it's as big a problem everywhere in the world as it is here. I do know that in America the absolute worst thing anyone can ever do-even worse than drugs! - is to even think about sex with minors, despite the fact that we live in a culture where every image in every music video, magazine ad, and billboard dares you not to.   Okay, not every image, but please, I think we've all had the experience of leafing through a Vanity Fair and thinking "Wow, she's hot," only to realize it's an ad for GapKids. How could a society not have a pedophilia problem when we not only jonbenet our kids physically but even insist that at the tender age of 9 or 10 they pose for ads with a professional model's disinterested sneer? How can a society look at such a picture, like the one I'm looking at right now, and not think this is trouble: a 10-year-old girl looking jaded, contemptuous, depressed, put-upon, spoiled, used, and unhappy - like a young Courtney Love. This girl doesn't need a wardrobe, she needs Prozac. I say no girl should suffer from ennui until she can spell it.   The hypocrisy of it all: Everything in America in recent years has been done "for the children," from cleaning up toxic waste dumps to fixing social security to the wars on drugs, sex, and tobacco-all for the children. But when we need to snatch one for entertainment or to sell shit, then fuck it! All the lip service about "education is our most important goal" and "leave no child behind," yada yada, but if they need you on the set, then school will just have to fit into that, now won't it? We'll get you a tutor-go study in your trailer with Mr. Pesci. Test tomorrow? Sorry, gotta get you to Milan, orders from your pimp, I mean the head of the agency.   Yes, little girl, we are fucking up your mind and your life, but sorry, society does need virgins to throw into the volcano. Children are important, but if you're 14 and hot, sorry - priorities! It turns out "Sex sells" was an understatement. Sometimes it seems like the entire economy revolves around hot, young girls giving older men boners; certainly that's the case at Scores. Also in Bob Dole commercials. Remember Britney Spears giving him a boner at the 2001 Oscars? After she gives America a video lap dance, he says "Easy boy," supposedly to his dog, but we all get it that it was the Viagra talking.   A bit later, Ms. Spears was on the cover of US Weekly with the message "It's Hard to Wait" - you know, because she was a virgin. Of course, she had a look on her face like "Please, someone do me soon or I'm gonna do myself with a pointy shoe." I'm not saying this is all Britney Spears's fault - she herself is a kid.   But where are the parents? A friend of mine told me that his wife once warned him about a 6-year-old girl who was coming over to play with their little girl. "She dances provocatively," the wife said. "Don't be silly, 6-year-olds aren't sexual, they can't dance provocatively," my friend said. Well, the little girl comes over, and the kids put on videos of Britney, Christina, etc., and start dancing along. In ten minutes my friend said, "Get that little whore out of my house."   Yes, parents are horrified by pedophilia, but they fight it with the same effectiveness that SUV drivers fight terrorism; you know, not "connecting the dots." Hey, it's your kid - I don't have kids, so I don't have a dog in this fight. But if you're going to let them leave the house with - as I've seen on children-T-shirts that say slut and porn star and I'm with molester (okay, not that last one), dressed in do-me rags and jeans cut so low they're weaving a vulva belt buckle, then please don't stare at the rest of us when we stare.   The combination of media images making little kids want to wear sexy clothing and parents too lame to put their feet down about anything (two-thirds of parents admit their kids are spoiled - the other third haven't been released from the basement) of course makes for a pedophile's paradise. It's very politically correct to say that men are solely responsible for their own sexual restraint and that liberated females - even children, because they are, in p.c. eyes, equal to adults - should feel free to "celebrate their body." But here on Planet Earth, dressing up children like Lil' Kim at the MTV Video Music Awards and encouraging them to flaunt a sexual power they have no handle on is naturally going to angry up the blood and trigger the launch system in boys and men.   American Beauty is a great movie because it keeps it real about how Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham really wants to fuck not his frigid wife but his daughter's hot cheerleader friend (Mena Suvari). I know, men are disgusting, but it is coming from biology, and Lester Burnham is different from other men only in that he goes crazy and thus becomes truthful. Because on biology, lizard-brain level, "barely past puberty" is still past the point where our biology tells us, "Okay, good to go - mate with the young, healthy one."   So, knowing we need to fight this biology with our civilizing ways for the few years when the first has raced ahead of the second, it seems as stupid to let your teen diva put on a thong and pasties and head off to the dance as it would be to tie a lamb chop to her ass and let her skip into a den of wolves. I would never defend R. Kelly or any male adult who had sex with a girl as young as 14, but somewhere along the way, other adults, including the parents, had to be enablers of their tryst.   If a bartender can be sued for serving drinks to the guy who smashes his car on the way home, and the Columbine parents should have known about the pipe bombs under the dresser, sending little Camel Toe off to a concert has to rate. About Mr. Kelly, his case illustrates that sex with kids is not always the same crime - it has levels, like murder one, manslaughter, etc., although that is rarely the view adopted here. "Zero tolerance" is a fitting invention for our era in America, because it combines self-righteousness with not having to think. Fake moralists love to shut off all attempts to differentiate between levels of the crime, because that's so much easier than thinking and makes you seem more pure.   But the truth is, although of course any kind of adult - child sex is wrong, a priest forcing sex on a 10-year-old boy is worse than someone having sex with an eager 14-year-old girl, even with the peeing, which is both horrid and amazing, because I can't even go when there's another guy in the room. Remembering Catholic fear from my own childhood - thankfully about things much less intense than molestation - I can only imagine a young boy in the clutches of an authority figure like a priest, terrified and crying. But I saw the R. Kelly tape, and the girl in it isn't terrified or crying. She looks starstruck and dumbfounded, but not like she didn't want to be there. He was definitely taking advantage - but she wanted him to. It was wrong, and he should be punished, and under 18 should always be considered too young to consider.   But the motivation for sex with priests? Fear of hell, fear of punishment. The motivation for sex with R. Kelly? Excitement and desire. If your victims come to you - if, in fact, they seek you out - that's quite different. I'm guessing altar boys don't hang around after Mass in hopes of being invited to a sex party with the lead priest.   In conclusion, I'll just say that although this pedophilia craze America is going through is sickening, I am nearly as upset when I read about the sex kids are having with each other: girls rarely staying virgins through high school, oral sex given out like handshakes - God, I was born too late!   Or, maybe not. I love kissing, and I also read that teen girls nowadays often think kissing on the mouth is too intimate, but oral sex is okay.   So they'll blow you, but not kiss you on the mouth-congratulations, America, for raising a generation of whores!

      Tanner, you show a slight right-hemisphere dominance with a moderate preference for auditory processing, an unusual and somewhat paradoxical combination of characteristics.   You are drawn to a random and sometimes nonchalant synthesis of material. You learn as it seems important to a specific situation, and might even develop a resentment of others who attempt to direct your learning down a specific channel.   Your right-hemispheric dominance provides a structure that is only loosely organized and one which processes entire swatches of reality, overlooking details. You are emotional in your reactions and perceptual more than logical in your approach, although you can impose structure and a language base when necessary.   Your auditory preference, on the other hand, implies that you process information sequentially and unidimensionally. This combination of right-brain and auditory modes creates conflict, as you want to process data more rapidly than your natural processes allow.   Your tendency to be creative and free-flowing is accompanied by sufficient ability to organize and be logical, allowing you a reasonable degree of success in a number of different endeavors. You take in information methodically and systematically which can then be synthesized rapidly. In this manner, you manage to function consistently well, although certainly less efficiently than you desire.   You prefer the abstract and are a theoretician at heart while retaining the ability to be practical. You find the symbolism in a great deal of what you encounter and are something of a "mystic."   With regards to your lifestyle, you have the mentality which would be good as a philosopher, writer, journalist, or instructor, or possibly as a systems designer or social worker. Perhaps most important is your ability to "listen to your inner voice" as a mode of skipping over unnecessary steps to achieve your goals.

      I'm sorry, but life just seems so pointless these days. I have no motivation to write. I love my job, but it doesn't pay nearly enough. I do think I am going to move to Red Deer. If I have no car, which I don't anyway, then I can afford to pay rent. I've talked about moving out before. I know. But I have always stayed. And now, with no car, there is no reason for me to stay. I can't get a car until I work, but I can't work until I have a car. Or my parents move to Red Deer. Not likely. And so. That is what I think I will do. I don't think there is much point in me staying here. Of course, I will end up staying. But it is nice to have ambition.  My ambitions haven't really been that great lately. I find myself nearing the second rung of a coprorate ladder that I have no desire to climb. The only friend that I bother to see is a 23 year old athiest. I only see him because we work together. The only real female interest I have is pretty much untouchable. I don't want a new job, I just want more money. No. It's not even a matter of want. I need more money. Plain and simple. I am not paid for what I'm worth. I know, I know. Story of everyone's life. But I do a whole lot of extra stuff, customer service, delivery, shit like that. I could make the same as I make now flipping burgers, and not have to worry about all of that. I love my job. I hate Intertan. Intertan=Tandy International=Owners of RadioShack. Such is life.  Life. With no God, there is no afterlife. With no afterlife, there is no reason for this life. So, if there is nothing before, and nothing after, it is the cause for nothing now. The process of belief is an elixer when you're weak. Was I right and now am wrong, or was I at one point wasting my time?

      People. Piss. Me. Off.  Yes. They certainly do. But that is another matter. And all I will say, is your trivial stories mean nothing. That is why they are trivial. Nobody really cares how drunk you were or how much partying you did. Nobody cares if they should call you on your cellphone. MSN names will just make you look stupid. So why bother.    My car died. It is just the clutch cable, but I can't drive it now, and have no money to fix it. What am I to do?

      There, I finally found a roomate. Problem: I am fairly confident there is no longer an open apartment in the building I had been looking at. I will have to find out, i suppose.      Bring Out Your Dead  Strung Out      one brief recollection of all the people in my life that have come and gone one brief fleeting moment of people I've loved and the people that i have wronged  long lost are the loved ones gone but this bird cannot seem to  mend it's broken wing so the lust for life dissipates and a new greed rises for the needful things  don't wanna think about it  i indulge myself distraction means less pain bury my emotion to protect myself 'til i can't feel a fuckin' thing i've dared to dream and i've tried to live but I'll play it safe again I'm just a slave to my vices now... BRING OUT YOUR DEAD  Voices wither and crack then die the ringin' in my ear will sing me soft asleep dead silence now is all I hear inspration following me don't wanna think about it  i indulge myself distraction means less pain  bury my emotion to protect myself  'till i can't feel a fuckin' thing  I've dared to dream and i've tried to live But I've played it safe again  Just another slave to my vices now...  my addiction, my illness my only trusted friend my addiction, my illness my only childhood friend you twisted warm embrace engulfing all i tried to be my body's breaking under arms that will not SET ME FREE my addiction my illness my only childhood friend  my addiction my illness my only trusted friend.......  Locked in this cage that I've built myself constructed out of twisted cold reminders of a life once lost but i've found my way again here among the wreckage and the vampires but i'll play it safe again i'm just a slave to my vices now...  my addiction, my illness my only childhood friend my addiction my only life      what a fucking great song.

      We talk, and we talk. And we hang out behind the back counter and ignore customers all night long. She states that her old boss was a lot like us. Then says that by like us, she means that we're a lot alike. I can't really disagree.  I hate myself for allowing me to feel this way.

      It was a very good night. It all started at around noon, when Matt called me up at work and asked what Adrienne and I were doing after work. Neither of us had any plans, so we got some beer and went over to John and Matt's place. Dr. Smooth strikes again, breaking both a hand railing for the stairs, and the towel holder in the bathroom. Rye, pringles, beer and ju jubes. Those four things do NOT taste that good the second time 'round.    And I, for one, am not the type of person who will dwell on things that happen when drunk. If something happens, you can't allow it to affect your relationship with others once you are sober. It's like living two lives.  Still, I can't ignore it.    all in all, i feel good today.

      Is it my brain of my body that is tired? It can't be my body. I slept for over 12 hours last night. I did little physical work today. In fact, I spent the majority of the day leaning on the back counter, talking to  her , as we do almost every time we work alone together. Yes. It must be my mind that is tired.   I've been seeing a lot of my cousins lately. In the past week, I've seen both Jamie and Candice. It's been years since I've seen either of them, which is especially sad because they both live in Red Deer. Just thought I'd write about it, even though I have nothing more really to say about it.   i've spoken too soon before. this time, i will remain silent until i know for sure

      If I could read your mind, would I be with you right now? I like to think that I would. I can't read your mind though, and even if I could, I think I would probably be too afraid to. What if I did open up your mind, and was able to know exactly what you were thinking at any given moment? Would I find what I want to find, or would I simply find reason to avoid any conversation with you at all?    I am different than the rest. Perhaps you've seen glimpses of it that I have tried to make visible to you. Perhaps you haven't. Either way. I am not like them.     History repeats itself. Every form of competetion I've ever met, I have fallen to. It is accurate to say that I have never won. Or at the very least, that I have rarely won. Every guy I have ever competed agains for the attention of a lady, I have lost. Even my own girlfriend. Everyone I have ever competed with is sports, I have lost. Career wise, yes, I've lost. For some reason, people can't see what I'm really like. My commitments, my motivations, my goals and aspirations. Always pushed aside. They think I can't handle myself.  I refuse to be handled

      Sometimes, the most wonderful people in existence are taken away from us. One can only hope that we are strong enough to pull through it all.  The mother of a friend of mine passed away yesterday morning. This friend of mine is one of the strongest, and most profound people I have ever known. I did not know her mother that well, but I do hold some memories of her. She was a happy woman, always smiling. She told me a joke once. If I could remember the joke, I would tell it to you, but instead, all I can recall is the punch line, and the look on her face and the way she laughed when she said it. "Dead Bobbies". And that was enough. It was enough to make us all crack up. Dinner with her and my dear friend at Swiss Chalet. When all I would eat were perogies because I hate to spend other people's money. It was a wonderful day.   I, too, have watched people deteriorate and die. Their minds, once strong and alert, I've watched them regress into a state of confusion and paranoia, not remember who you are, or who they are. Spewing sentences about their horses, or asking if we've hauled enough ice off of the river to keep the ice box cold. This is usually the point when I stop going to visit, when I stop caring. It's not that I don't love them when they are in that state, it's simply that they are living in better times. Their mind has regressed to a point when they were truly happy. I can't bear to see them in such a state of delusion, so I choose not to. Just as they remain in the past, I, too, choose to ignore the present. My friend, she was there until the very end, with an open heart. For that, I admire her.  I love you, friend.

      I just don't know sometimes.  Last night. Hmmm. It's a half smile that I'm wearing on my face right now. It's how I am. I could never have asked for anything more than what I got. And although it was forced, and awkward, and a little slow, and defensive, it was one of the best conversations I've had for a very long time. How am I supposed to be honest?  Honest: I know what I want, and I know what she doesn't.  Dishonest: I never want it to happen again  Honest: I can see us being amazing friends in the future  Uncertainty: These feelings will fade  Talking. Admittedly, it is sometimes over rated. Sitting on the kitchen counter, staring at her, wishing I had something of value to offer. I was lost. But we've all been down this road before, and we've all seen me make these mistakes before.   you can sit there in complete silence and walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had

There is a storm coming in, and I really want to go to the beach and watch the lightning as it lights up the sky over the water. I won't go though. Because the beach over there, and I am here.

      There are some children playing outside my house tonight. They are skinny, basically just a bag of bones. You know how children can be when they are young. I always see these kids playing outside, and they always seem happy, energetic, and...skinny. There is another girl who lives across the street. The only time I ever see her outside is walking home from school. I never see her out playing, or even going to get the mail. She is a little on the larger side. When I do see her, she seems sad, sombre and a little depressed. Not to mention...large.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, childhood obesity is a growing problem in the US, with one in ten pre-schoolers considered clinically obese. So. What do the powers that be do? They create a drug. That's right folks, a diet pill for children. This new drug is called Pedia Loss, and they berry-flavoured tablets supposedly address "the crowing healthcare issue in children 6 years of age and older" (Good Housekeeping, July 2003, P. 157).   While I won't deny that child obesity is a significant North American problem, I hardly believe this is the way to control this problem. And besides, it is just that. A North American problem. Instead of breeding a generation of pill-popping, medication-reliant, slim-fast drinking children, why don't we do the obvious. Turn off the TV, unplug the X-box, and send the children outside to play. Sure, at first, they may notice that their pasty skin has taken on a bit of a brown tone, and they may feel a little fatigued after breathing in that fresh air, but these are merely side effects of the best diet-aide known to man: ACTIVITY!!

      Well, the weekend is over, and I am back home again. I spent a lot more than I should have, but that is alright. It's better than not spending it only to spend it sometime over the next two weeks on fast food. I haven't shown my parent my tattoo yet. I don't think I will. It's up high enough on my arm that even my smaller t-shirts cover it, so I shouldn't really have a problem with covering it up. Hm.  I want to say more. As is usually the case, I have tons to say, but can't seem to find the words. So I stay in silence. Good night.

      A few days of anonymity and silence can do a person good.  My webiste disappeared, and I have no idea when it will be back, so I will be setting up a temporary home here. Tell everyone you know. Hopefully within the month I will have a domain up, with hosting on a paid server with better up time. That will be swell.  This is probably the most disgusting hamburger I have ever eaten. When I chew it, things are grinding in my teeth, almost like it is coated with sand. Tastes splendid, but the texture is a little much.   I had today off, and I really did enjoy myself. Lots of TV, eating junk food, and working on my computer. Did you know that the dollar store is the only place in Sylvan Lake that sells CAT 5 network cable? Shocking, isn't it?  Well. I shall be letting you go now.

      Why? Of all the people from my past, she has to be the one I always dream about. Even while I was dating Crystal, she would be in my dreams every couple of months. And since, the trend has continued. I haven't thought about her in quite some time, and there is absolutely not reason at all that she should be in my mind, and yet she appears. Last night at a picnic table downtown. Is it perhaps that I never should have let her go, or for once in my life I actually did the right thing?    Last night. Went out with Robyn. Nice girl. First off, we went to dinner at the Mongolie Grill. I seem to have aquired a certain amount of celebrity (although not the kind most people like), as when I walked in, the girl at the counter's eyes light up and she loudly proclaimed "You're RadioShack guy!". It made me chuckle. "Yes, I suppose I am". The food there, oh my God. If you have not eaten there yet (as I'm assuming is the case for most of you), GO THERE NOW!. Expensive, but well worth it.  A walk in the park followed. There's nothing like a walk in the park to get to know someone better.  We ended up seeing "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". I quite enjoyed it, Robyn didn't know quite what to think. All the heroes I looked up to as a 12 year old with a love for books. Tom Sawyer, Skinner, Dr. Jekyll, all thrown into one fantastic movie. Must buy.  The movie was over and we still had some time before she had to go home, so we had a campfire in the park. I love campfires and I love the dark and I love parks. I had a wonderful time. Sigh.  And now. RadioShack Guy must go to work.

      Ah. Nothing like half a day off to stress you out. Listless, I lay here on the couch, with an internet connection that comes and goes, watching the circus that is the california recall election unfold on CNN. I will restore my computer again today, for the fourth time in as many days. This time, I will not put Kazaa back on it. If i need a song, I will use the computer upstairs and transfer it from there via CD, or in the near future, JumpDrive (I've been told by my boss that I absolutely must have one). I also need a PDA. But that is my own perogative. I am supposed to do something with Robyn tomorrow. I am quite looking forward to it, provided it actually happens. I requested two days off this week in lieu of the Monday night that never happened. It will remain to be seen if this is actually the case. I'm really sick of cancelling plans with the people most important to me because of work. I've missed birthday parties and movie nights and just simple times hanging out and chilling with my friends. It's inhuman of a job to ask that of you, no matter what position you hold. Dwayne, the manager of the other store, has gained a new respect from me. The other night, I heard him talking about work, and how on his day off, he would tell our Regional Manager that he's not coming into work because he's going to spend time with his son, and if he doesn't like it, then he can fire him. That is admirable to me.

I have a terrible headache and my neck really really hurts. Sure, I've woken up in this condition before, but this time I didn't drink a thing last night. Kiel and Justin are both sick, and I think that I must be getting sick as well. Not cool, not cool.  Crystal left me a note on my car last night. Made my day, actually. Sigh.

      Oh boy. Dayven is gonna kill me. I told her I wouldn't fall asleep, and then I had to go and put my head down. Stupid Tanner. The sleep wasn't all that good, either. Well, what's done is done.  Lately...ok well, not just lately, but the past few months anyway, I have been feeling completely exhausted. I'm sick of just writing about it on here, so I'm actually doing something about it today. I'm going to write a resume. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, but recently it's been so much more than a job, it's almost been a lifestyle, and I can't handle that. I mean, I have no problem staying late once in a while, or working the odd 12 hour shift if need be, but not over and over again. When you have to start turning down invitations to go out with people just because you're too exhausted from work and all you can think about it going home and sleeping, then you know it's time for something to change.  Alexisonfire/Billy Talent. 3 more days. Can't wait. Can't fucking wait.  Also,  urlLink The Reason  is playing on October 10th with Midpoint, Belvedere, and a few other bands. Perhaps Crystal would come with me. It's in Cochrane, of all places. The reason is doing a cross Canada tour, and their only Albertan stop is Cochrane...makes me wonder...WHY? Meh. Less gas for me!  Well. I'm sure I'll be posting again later....

      GOOD MORNING!  well, that's what we're trying for anyway.  I wish i had something profound to say this morning, but I don't. I'm just posting as a means of putting off everything else.  rawr.

      Justin.  All he does is stand around, and play on the computers. I took the router away. Literally uplugged it and took it away. Then I had no internet. So I hooked it back up. Now he's standing there again. I'm watching him on the security cameras. He quit today, but he was decent enough to give two weeks notice. Lovely. You might say I have no place to talk, since really, I'm doing the same thing he is. Sitting, on a computer, wasting time. Au contraire. I am exhausted. I am tired. I have been working far too much and far too hard. I have also been whining too much. So lets talk about sometihng a little less depressing.  I got a phone call last night from Mel. It was to apologize on behalf of Dayven. I wasn't really expecting to hear from either of them, so it was a welcome surprise. A nice gesture anyway. I never did finish "The Manchurian Candidate" though. Which is fine, the only reason I was watching it anyway is because it has Frank Sinatra in it. Hm.  As soon as this week is over, there are some things I am going to do.  1. Apply at London Drugs. Cooler toys, better pay, looks like less work. 2. If get the job at London Drugs, probably turn it down. 3. Call and spend at least 3 hours with: Ed, Mel, Shyla, Mark (depending on their schedules, of course) 4. Minor tweaks to this webpage.   And that's that. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular,but all probably very difficult to accomplish. I am so unmotivated.   I still need a goddammed hug

No big deal, I'll just make Lindsey put it away, right? WRONG. Lindsey never shows up, doesn't answer his phone. Just between you and me, he's gonna be fired. Well, that's fine, I have two people in at 9 this (Wednesday) morning, to put it away, right? WRONG. Get a phone call from Andrew, "Yeah, I won't be coming in today, I found a job that's gonna pay the bills a little bit better". Well you know what, shithead. Fuck You!  Anyone want a job?

      Bah. If i could kick the entire being of TELUS square in the balls, I would. Apparently they are having "network" problems, which means I have no god-dammed internet. AGAIN! So here I am. At work. I came in at 8 this morning with every intention of doing tons of work, but I'm not feeling the greatest, so I will do my work later. Right now, I will just sit.  I've been thinking a lot lately. I need to find a good way to finish my Chem 30. Next fall, I am seriously planning on going back to school. And all y'all, if I don't, you should be smacking me.   Sometimes, personalities just...mesh well, I guess you could say. She says she's the same as the other, but I think she's completely different. Completely. Maybe it's just a matter of perception, but that's ok with me. I'd say it's the most fun I've had on the computer in a long time. But honestly, half impressions are hard to deal with.  Well you. And you should know who you are, and those of you who aren't you, should also know who you aren't. Supposing (actually, predicting), that my internet at home still is broken tonight, You. (with a capital), should give me a call, say, anytime after 8ish..9ish...meh. Even if you just want to call and give me your number, so I can incur the expenses.  403-887-3556.   6 days until  urlLink Alexisonfire .  And now, I return to work. *breaks computer, fax maching, telephone, and little toe in a fit of rage*   Either you build the shovels, or you dig the graves, either way, your body decays

      Ah. The joys of having a social life. I had forgotten how much fun it really could be. Pool. I haven't played that horrible since those days hanging out with Tammy and Chris and Eddie in junior high. I even managed to knock my ball off of the table, and onto the table next to us, where some whorish looking girls were playing with some loser guys. You know...the "hollywood" type, who wear their sunglasses everywhere. Yes. It didn't even seem like they noticed, but we all busted a gut. Heh.  Next topic. Dayv. Seemingly, an amazing girl. Seemingly, our personalities seem to be very compatible. Seemingly. Seemingly. God Damn SEEMINGLY. heh. I'm done now. I know, I'm not allowed to talk about girls anymore, because it seems like every time I talk about them, they disapear. Not that it's their fault either. Usually, it's mine. I just push people away a lot when they start to get close. But she can't get close, so maybe that's...I don't know. Geography is a great thing sometimes, terrible at others. Ahem. Little of this paragraph makes sense, so...moving on.  I bought the Spitafield disc the other day. They were one of the bands at the Billy Talent concert, and I didn't really like them then. But for some reason, the CD at HMV just jumped out at me, and I bought it. Well, I haven't stopped listening to it since then. Today alone I listented to it 14 times. (I didn't count, it's simple math based on minutes i was at work and the length of the CD). It's AMAZING!  I LOVE IT!  heh. well. good night.

      I still have a ticket to the show. Amber from the other RadioShack was supposed to come with me, but Dwayne is making her work. It's crazy, we go way back. She used to sign my guestbook every once in a while back in the awakeatmidnight days. And we've been to a lot of the same shows and know a lot of the same people from the Bently/Rimbey area. But she can't come. I suppose I will have to make some phone calls today.  Inventory last night was hell. Well, not so much last night, but this morning is. I am like, deathly ill. My insides are swimming, and everytime I try to eat something, I just feel sick. Blah. Then I'm going to the show tonight, I'm sure tomorrow morning won't be much better. In fact, I'm almost scared to drive home tonight. Oh boy.  Well, I'm just updating before heading back to work. *crosses fingers for tuesday off*.   Oh. I was thinking of You.

      Evening. I'm angry today, or sad. Perhaps a little of both. I've been searching for something, but I've not known it. Well, I have, but it was easily pushed aside or moved to the back burner. Or just plain unwanted. Or unclear. But now. Now it's different. Now I know exactly what I want. Well, not exactly. I suppose there's always room for compromise. But you know. I want it so badly now, and I...I feel so angry at the degree of difficulty there is to finding what you want in this world. So much anger.

      Trust  no one. This is what I've learned today. I feel no remorse for any ties that I may have cut or bridges I may have burned today. In one way, it makes perfect sense. In another, it makes absolutely no sense. Earlier today, I was ready to explode with one emotion. Now, tonight, I'm ready to explode with another. How can I do this? How come it has to be this way? BECAUSE YOU LIED TO ME! YOU DID THIS TO YOURSELF! You exposed me for what I am. Shallow, heartless, and self-serving. And if what you say is true, then you are a genius. The intricatly woven character and the way you can create a day to day ordinary life. But like most geniuses, you got ahead of yourself, and it collapsed. Didn't it? DIDN'T IT? ANSWER ME!!!! Nevermind. Don't answer me. I don't know what...I don't know...I. AHHHHHHHHH. Fuck. FUCK. DOUBLE FUCK. This is how it has to be....because you've proven something to me about myself. And I hate you for it. And I hate myself for it.  I think I will be taking a break from internet life. Maybe a long one, maybe a short one. I may still blog, I may not. I may be back. I may not. Probably, eventually.  But for now.  it's odd how feelings linger. Well fuck you too

      Well god dammit. I'm only part way through restoring my computer, and it's time to go to work. I'm on the shitty computer. So. I will probably be late getting on here tonight, but I know You will wait up for me, right? ;).  Heh. The cheese.  On a lighter note: My birthday is almost upon us, yo! Today, I believe is the 7th of October, meaning my birthday is exactly one month away! Also, one month until the third Matrix movie hits theatres. What is Tanner doing for his birthday? Well, isn't it obvious? (for those of you who aren't that quick on the uptake, he's going to see the goddammed movie, yo!)  *cough*  Well. To work I go.   it's a little bit funny

      Oh boy.  I have been cleaning my room for roughly 2 hours. And I mean REALLY cleaning. And still, it is a disaster. My dresser. It's empty now. Before, it was overflowing with useless garbage. Most of it is in a black garbage bag just inside my door now. I took my old chair away, and now the new on is in here. This one if far bigger, and looks rather out of place in this room. Oh well. One day I will be able to fill more than just one bedroom with stuff. And it will be grand. At any rate. Currently, my bed has on it: a laundry basket filled with pants, a VCR, three DVDs, 5 books, 12 notebooks, a TV, 2 binders, 1 jacket, one shoebox filled with pictures and letters, a blue shirt, and some toothpaste. No sheets though, and no place for me to sleep. So, I think I will either sleep in this chair, or perhaps move to the couch later. But right now. I'm in my chair.  I found a lot of stuff while I was cleaning today. Including some Grinch boxers from last Christmas. The tag is still attached. I think I will wear them tomorrow. They have a picture of the Grinch on them, and they say MEAN 1. It's all rather exciting. I hope that they're mine.  Oh boy. Look what happens when Dayv isn't here. I start writing about my underwear.  Oh. There she is!

      *cough* Yes. Tanner is sick. I don't quite know what is wrong with me though. At the risk of giving you guys too much information, I have been vomitting a lot lately. After the show in Cochrane, Robyn's, and tonight. I don't feel sick most of the time, but then all of a sudden, it hits me. I think it's my neck, I really think it's my neck. Who needs money? I'll give somebody 15 buck to give me an hour massage. As long as you're good, yo. Any takers, comment.  I sold my first Christmas present of the season today. A depressing reminder that Christmas is upon us, and in just over two months, many people will be broke. I, being one of the lucky retail workers, will have their money. Until January. When I will be flat broke. But really, I like Christmas.  Why though, does everyone celebrate Christmas? I understand the religious foundations for the holiday, which makes me wonder why many people do celebrate it. It's become so much more than just a religious thing, I think. It's a time for people to rush. All of November and all of December, people rush around, filling their carts. It all builds up to one climactic day (Christmas Eve), and then they can rest. And it's the best kind of rest. Chilling with family, calling up friends. Yes. Aside from the religious point, we as a society need Christmas. It keeps us sane (as insane as it makes us).  anyway.

       Birthday Tribute For Shyla   (at the risk of sounding really cheesey)   Shyla is one of the best friends I have ever had. When I decided to go do my own thing, she let me. She didn't constantly talk to me on msn if i didn't initiate the conversation or call me repeatedly. She didn't pray for me. If she was frustrated with any mixed signals I may have sent her, she didn't let it show. At least not around me anyway. She understands that I am a growing, changing person. Especially at this point in my life. I think she knows what I'm looking for, and I think she knows where I might find it. She's content with who we are.   Shyla. I do consider you to be one of my best friends, and we do go back quite some time now. Thank you for being around, and thank you for understanding me. Happy Birthday.

      You may have noticed a new link to the left. That's Ellabel. She cheered me up with some e-mail, so she gets a link. I need to seriously revamp my links. Hm.  Tonight was Shyla's birthday. 17. One more year and we can go wreak havoc on this town, dear. I'm in a rare good mood tonight, and I do have a real feeling of regret that the night is probably going to end as soon as I am finished typing this. I did have fun tonight. Actually, more fun than I usually have when I do get up the energy to expose my face to light that isn't radiated from a computer screen.  Judging by the nature of the comments left on this site, it is doubtful that I will be seeing Robyn anytime soon. That's too bad.  Get ready for the confession:  I do like her. Like is a silly word though. I do have some attraction to her, not only on a physical level, but on a mental and emotional as well. She is fun, and when she's around, the rest of my life doesn't seem that...stressful. Like that Friday that we went out, and it had been the week from hell, and I was sick and wanted to die. At the end of the night, I felt better. And sometimes better is all you can ask for.   and the cursor flashed on

      Well. The internet seems to be a quiet place today. Not much in way of comments, or posts in mine, and other people's blogs today. I suppose everyone has better things to do sometimes.   A day off tomorrow. I might go get a haircut. Doubtful, but I might. More likely I will read and play computer. I should call Mark in the morning as well, I'd like to go check out his place of employment.   Robyn and Collette came to see me at work today. It made me rather happy. I talked briefly to Amber about Robyn today, and...*ahem*.  After work, I went to Timmy's with Amber, where said conversation occured. Hm. Well, for lack of anything better to do...sleep time it is.  Too bad, too. I feel  hot  today.

      I have a whopping 14 dollars a day to spend until payday. And I suspect payday is not going to be spectacular, as I have spent all of my time training new staff. Thus, not selling anything. Yesterday I sold one hundred dollars worth of stuff. My average is about twelve hundred. I write about work a lot.   I simply cannot drink anymore. Sunday night, I tried drinking Rye. Did not work so well for me. Last night, one beer. Also, did not work so well with me. I write about drinking a lot.  I feel the urge to be educated. I need to learn something. Something useful, which will allow me to make money. Even if it is on the side.  Three posts this morning, and it is only 11:23 am. It is time for me to get off of the computer.

      I applied at London Drugs yesterday. And the Bay. Both are only seeking part time help. This depresses me. RadioShack raised the wages of everyone in my district, to $7.00 an hour plus commission. That should help. But still, I don't want to make the same as everyone else. I want to make more.  Last night: Mark, Kendra, Alex, Me. Blarney Stone South. Lots of good music, and excellent wings. Tipped the waitress 8 dollars. On a $32.32 bill. I will not be known as stingy. Dress pants make you spend more, anyway.  Alex: New girl at work. A PoliSci student. Seems to have half a brain. Nice girl. Did not expect her to accept the invitation to come out for a drink. Surprised.  This morning: Tired, neck hurts. Fell asleep on book last night. Crumpled book. I've been trying to read this one since Christmas. Mother woke me up this morning to ask if I had replaced headlight in car yet. Headlight has been burnt out for the better part of a year. My mother is crazy. Literally.  Mark: Going to set up my wireless network on Friday? Marks a good guy.  Work: Unfulfilling.  Adrienne: Should call  Bryce: Should call  Robyn: Should call  Breakfast: Cereal. Again.

      For those who read this site on a regular basis, you may be aware that I have dreams. Not dreams in general, we all have those, but every few months, I dream about a particular person. She won't leave my head, and I really do not know why. She lives in Texas now, but is from Sylvan Lake. I haven't talked to or seen her since just after Crystal and I broke up. I still dream about her. I dreamt about her again last night.  I also bought a pack of cigarettes in the dream.

      Last Sunday, a new family sat in front of me in church. With them, they had two small children. One was roughly six, and the other no more than 4. Church progressed normally for the majority of the service. Then, just as the priest was blessing the eucharist, the four year old started screaming. The six year old scolded him, saying "shhh...you'll break his concecration".  *groan*  those catholics, I'll tell ya.

      I saw a man talking to himself today. His hair was greasy and matted, and he seemed confused as to which direction he should walk. Or rather, which road he should cross, as he was standing on a street corner. I wondered just who it was he was talking to. A former co-worker, an imaginary friend, or perhaps a long since deceased spouse. At first, I was mildy depressed at this sight, knowing full well that a few years down the road, I may be just like him. Mumbling to myself on some random street corner. Then a thought occured to me which caused the mild feeling of depression to become an overwhelming feeling of hoplessness. I am that man. Teetering on the curb, I long for some direction in my life, wondering exactly which street it is that I want to cross. I talk, but does anyone really hear me? They talk back, but does the fact that someone will talk back to you make them real? If so, then who's to say what's real at all? And if not, then what does define real? As cliche as the questions are, I will ask them anyway. Does real mean something you can touch? smell? hear? taste? feel? sense? imagine? Perhaps love is just like Santa Claus, or God. Something made up to control your behavior, something that is not really real, but is real to many because it's what they  believe  And if belief is all it takes to be real, then I suppose  you  are real...

      First, I must say this: Darren Aronofsky is the most amazing director in the movie business today. I watched the movie Pi last night, and it was god dammed amazing. Also, Requiem for a Dream was his doing, as well. Amazing.  The show in Cochrane was pretty spectacular. At first I was concerned about the amount of bubble gum there, but the mosh pit was one of the best I've seen. Ever. However, sweaty twelve year old boys must realize that the point of a mosh pit isn't to actually try and hurt one another. Ah. To be young again. I feel I'm getting too old for that sort of thing, as I would only be able to jump and flail around for about sixty seconds before having to stop and catch my breath.  I also bought a CD at HMV the other day. Pretty Girls Make Graves. Not my usually preferred type of music, but I am in love with the CD.  Work. 10-5:15 today.   breakfast first.

      I am in a wonderful mood this morning. Well, this afternoon for most of you.  Yesterday, I spent $300 on books, CDs, and DVD's. Included in the splurge was the CDs "The Used - Maybe Memories" and some CD by Shai Hulud (I'm not overly impressed by it). I also bought the movies "Hard Core Logo", "House of a 1000 Corpses", and the first and second season of the TV show "Trailer Park Boys".   I went shopping with Phaedra.  Then we returned to Red Deer with Kylie, and ventured over to Chapters, where I bought some giant book (it's friggin huge) on Vampires, and the book "Breaking Faith", by some guy...I dunno, he wrote "Hitlers Pope", as well. Then Tim Horton's then blah blah blah.  We ended up just watching movies at Phaedra's house later. I've concluded that Kylie and Phaedra surpass Shyla and Laura as the funnest people I know to hang out with. (Although not by very much at all). I had fun.  When I got home, I decided to watch the first four episodes of "Trailer Park Boys. I succeeded, and managed to go to sleep at around 5ish.   The next thing I remember, is Kiel my boss calling me. This is how I recounted the story to Mark:   yeah. my boss called at 8:30 this morning and was like "where the fuck are you, you were supposed to be here for a staff meeting, even though it's your day off". and i was like..."guhhhhfuckthatguuu" and he was like..."you're in trouble, go back to bed". and i was like...guhhhhh   So I guess i'm in a little trouble.  On the agenda for today:  Eat Fish and Chips. Watch Trailer Park Boys Find Used CD in my car somewhere. Call Manda.    It was a very blustery day yesterday, and the wind managed to strip every tree of every leave that had been holding on. I hate winter.

      So. I started writing the bio for this site. Eventually, when you click on the "identity" link above, it will take you there. However, the bio is unfinished, and I don't feel much like writing any more tonight. Just wanted to blog before heading to bed.  It's almost November 1st. November 1st is a very solemn day in my life. I have been thinking of Allison often lately, but I dont' know if it has anything to do with the upcoming anniversary of her death, or something a little more than that. No matter. People get taken away from us, and then they're gone. No matter how much you cry or mourn or wallow, they aren't coming back. It's even more depressing when you don't believe in a God or an afterlife. I'm not going to deny that it's a horrible way to live, thinking that once you die, that's it. There's nothing. I sincerely hope I'm wrong about this one.  Hope is all we have sometimes.

      I haven't awoken to the sound of rain in quite some time, and it was rather soothing. I hate waking up to silence, I absolutely despise it. I also hate waking up to the sound of an alarm clock, or pans falling on the floor in the kitchen above my room. Rain is a pleasant medium. Although, it is late October, and it really shouldn't be raining today. There's usually snow by now, isn't there? When I was growing up, there was snow by now. The last few years, I don' tthink there has been. No matter. There were days when I would wake up early every morning just to peek through the blinds and see if snow had fallen. Those days are gone, and now I just see snow as something I have to brush off of my car. It can be beautiful though. I'm rambling, and probably boring you people. I should clean today.   I'm a sexy monkey!

      My dog is asleep on the floor. In front of the door that I need to open in order to get out of this room. I don't really want to wake him, so I decided I would post before going downstairs to tackle another chapter of my book.  My dog is getting old. It makes me sad to know that within the next year or two, we will probably have to put him down. We're his third home, and he's spend more time with us than with the other two families. He used to be such a pretty dog, now he smells of decay. You know how animals get when they age. He's been a good dog.  I must say, I am fairly pleased with the current staff at RadioShack right now. Alex is great, she's fun and seems to be fairly smart. She's also a Scorpio, so we get along well. Megan, she's great, too. Great taste in music. Andrew brings a level of maturity, something that is needed very much in an atmosphere like that. Scott, he's a good guy, seems like a really caring person. A softie. And Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Goof.   I can't wait till friday. For three reasons.  1. The first of two days off, planning on shopping, and watching movies. Chilaxing. 2. Payday. Will make shopping worthwhile. 3. Am planning on doing all of this with Phaedra.  If that is not a perfect Friday, I don't know what is.  Well. It's time to wake the dog.   link of the day:  urlLink the natatorium

      11 hours of sleep last night. That is the most beautiful thing. Actually, no. 2 consecutive days off this week.  That  is the most beautiful thing.   I have plans with Phaedra on Friday. I am very much excited for that.  The other night, I went out with Bryce and Josh. Good times, I tell ya. It had been quite a while since I had seen Bryce, what with his school and with my work. It was a nice break though, to go out and drink. Like before.   God. I wish I had something of substance to say. I wish I had something to write that would change the world of make someone happy or cause those tingles in your face and up your spine. I wish. I spend most of my life  wishing  and  apologizing   ;lasjdf;oiajef;lk;h

      It seems that everyone is broken these days. In one way, or another at least. Crystal, in her journal, doesn't seem happy. Heather doesn't seem happy. Mel doesn't seem happy. Ellabel doesn't seem happy. I am not happy. Everyone is not happy.  I had plans on writing a long entry tonight.

      I work at 1pm. Correction. I'm supposed to work at 1pm today. In actuality, I'm about to leave for work. It is 10:18 am. The CEO and the President of Sales are both going to be in my store today. IN MY STORE. This thrills me to no end (sense the sarcasm). So. Today, all the hard work and effort I have put in to making the store look like a store and not a storeroom, will be told that it's not good enough and that we should work harder. Maybe I'll just crash my car into the back of a truck so I can spend the day in the hospital instead.  I talked to Phaedra last night. She's a good kid. Even though she didn't get a birthday tribute like Shyla, I love Phaedra. I love all of you. Take a bullet for any of you, ya know.  Well. I suppose I'll post when I return.

      I can honestly say that I don't care. It saddens me, yes, but I really don't care. It's sad that anyone can live that way.    but now you're more of a basketball, boys just pass you around, bounce you hard on the ground, and  dribble . And we all get high fives. You think I'm an asshole now, and you're probably right....Still I hope you get everything that you care to possess, and ubelievable sex, with him, or any one of my friends.    This is a slow Halloween, not nearly as many trick-or-treaters as usual. Must be the temperature outside.   I don't really have anything to say. I have two and a half hours to get rid of this headache before Kylie calls.

Was worth it, was in good company. -Got beaten up -Did not set foot in RadioShack today, even though I was in the mall -Was going to try and pick up waiter guy at Boston Pizza, decided not to toy with young boys hearts. -Played pool. Was good. -Supposed to do something with Kylie and friends on Friday (Halloween) night. Should be fun.  Good Nite.

      Wow. 4pm. Already. All I really accomplished today was to get my haircut, and mess up my room just enough that i don't think people should be in there. Smells good though.  Other than that, I have done nothing but watch the Used DVD, and a movie...The Rules Of Attraction, also, still playing in my room. I came upstairs for a drink and planned on going back down there, but that was half an hour ago.  Phaedra and Kylie should be calling soon, although I don't know if anything will come of that, as the roads are mundo shitty. If you haven't figured, I hate winter. I hate having my birthday in the winter, I hate having friends in the winter, I hate working in the winter, and I hate being in the winter. I would rather fall out of existence for 5 months of the year than have to drudge through all the snow and wind and cold. This is not the last time I will complain about winter.   sometimes cold nights are all we need, everyone wants someone to hold

      I'm sorry. I haven't been writing much lately. But most of my online time has been taken up the past few days. MSN is the slayer of all creativity. So now, now I'm off work, and there is no one online. So, I will write...  It snowed yesterday, and in typical Alberta fasion, it wasn't just a little snow, or even a lot of snow spread over a long period of time. No, we got completely dumped on last night. Driving home, the roads, they were shitty. 75 all the way home, took for-freaking-ever. I only saw one car in the ditch though, which was good. Wonder how many there were by the end of the night?  I had a dream last night. I think, I think it was about God. I remember only a few things about it. I remember standing in line at the bank without my slips filled out. I was fourth of fifth in line, and all of a sudden I heard a voice all out to me from behind the counter. "I can help you here, Tanner". It was Harry Bodja. For those (most) of you who don't know who Harry Bodja is...Back in my church-going days, Harry was one of the guys I looked up to the most. Family man, booming voice, very nice. I like Harry. Anyway, I haven't seen or thought of him for months, so I have no idea why he was in my dream. The second part, Rhonda (also a very influencial figure in my teen-years), was buying something at RadioShack, but all she had to pay with was a Bible. Or something to that effect, I don't really remember. Anyway, I just remember waking up cold, with a feeling that I had lost something.   I always speak too soon. So for now, i exist in silence, and you, dear, do not exist at all...

      It was a night like this when I first said "I love you", and meant it. The snow, the cold, the shitty roads and the slow drive home. And it was a night like this, when we would finally give in and call it quits.  I was talking to Amber today, and decided that "pre-winter depression" is going around. Nobody feels content right now...most people that we know are sad at the moment. More than usual, anyway.  I fucking hate snow. It can be as god dammed cold as it wants, but I really do not like snow.

        You are Form 7,  Gryphon : The Wyrm.   "And The Gryphon displaced the balance of the world in his favor.  With grace and control, Gryphon deceived mankind and ruled over civillization.  But even he realized that all good things must come to an end."   Some examples of the Gryphon Form are Satan (Christian) and Baphomet (Assyrian). The Gryphon is associated with the concept of control, the number 7, and the element of wind. His sign is the gibbous moon.  As a member of Form 7, you are a very in control individual.  You maintain your coolness in most situations and always seem to be prepared. Though some may say you are a bit of a control freak, you know that you really do make the best leader even if others can't see it. Gryphons are the best friends to have because they have a positive influence on people.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Ahhh...Good morning.  Well, I don't really have anything much to say, so I'll just give you the point form...  -Last night, went to Kylies. -Phaedra and Holly were there. -It was a good ol' time. -Woke up to one of my "half-awake-hallucinations-about-stupid-things". There hallucinations are caused by lack of sleep, but are multiplied by the consumption of alcohol. They often revolve around work, as well. This time, I thought Kylie was trying to sell me a digital camera. Wonder if I said anything, I usually talk when these things are going through my mind. -Dog chewed holes in my socks. Place blame on Phaedra for stealing my socks.

You'll never know my mind Or the scars under my long sleeved shirt Still, you welcome me inside Music pounding, we dance as we flirt  As the sun comes up Awkwardly we we part Tomorrow night's another nameless face Tomorrow night, I've got a fresh start...

      I ran a stop sign last night  A policeman must have witnessed this violation of traffic laws, for he turned on his lights and chased me down the highway. I debated running. Had no gas, figured I'd pull over. $280 dollars for running a stop sign these days. He didn't give me that ticket though, just a "failure to produce drivers license". My wallet was in my pants. I think I'm going to start leaving my ID in my car. Anyway, make sure you have your licence with you, $189 for that one. If only it had been Cst. Bengert instead of Baker. Meh. I'll survive, I have until December 29th to pay up, and Christmas paycheques are coming.  Jingle Bells, Chequebook swells, laughing all the way...   That was on my way to Kylie's house. w00t w00t, yo!  I must say, it's nice, and rather refreshing, this thing with Kylie. Sigh. *enter*  Well, I'm off to work, even though the mall is closed at the moment because it has absolutely no power. Hurrah.

      Over and over, I keep telling mysefl that I have to get the links on my webpage working. The bio, the poetry, and whatever else is up there. And that's the kind of person that I am. I will put things off, even though the feeling of "unfinished" drives me insane, I leave things until I can't take it anymore. I'm the type of person who will cut my hair way to short and let it grow out way to long, all in the interest of saving the time it takes to go to the barber. And so. Here's the beginnings of the bio:  I grew up, and still live in, a small town in central Alberta. That's in Canada, for those of you who don't know. The town is called Sylvan Lake, although there is really nothing sylvan about it. The permanent population is roughly 8,000 people, but in the summer, we see roughly a million pass through. The beach is where I spent most of my summers as I was growing up. From the time I was about twelve to when I was sixteen, I spent almost every day of summer at the beach, picking up girls, hanging with friends. Good times, yo! Now, I hardly ever go to the beach. I don't know what it is really, maybe I'm always at work, maybe something about it just got old. Who knows.  I was born in Red Deer, Alberta, on November 7th, 1984. I spent the first few years of life in Red Deer, before moving to Sylvan Lake, about 20 minutes west of Red Deer, where I've lived for the majority of my life.  Musically, I have a pretty broad taste. I like everything from country to metal. Favorites of the moment are Boysetsfire, Pretty Girls Make Graves, Inventing The Wheel, and The Reason.

      On Saturday, May 10th, 2003, I posted the following on this very website:   And then there's my current beliefs on the "dating" situation. Titles, like "dating", they mean nothing. I don't think you can just start a relationship by mutually agreeing that you should be in a relationship. A relationship has to be something that grows from a friendship and just sort of evolves to a point when you think about that person enough, and feel enough for that person that there is actually a commitment. And that's my problem right now. As much as I want to be in a long term relationship, I don't know if I'm there emotionally enough for that yet. Last night, I felt so free, for the first time in a long while, there was little holding me back. And that is a good feeling.   I guess there's a few people I need to talk to, huh?    That was a few months ago. And now, now I don't know what I'm doing. Now, I think I'm back at an emotional level for some sort of relationship, and that is all well and fine, but perhaps I've been going about it the wrong way. Perhaps we need to draw that solid line, make that solid distinction between "she's just a friend" and "she's my girlfriend". But then, where is the proper place to draw that line. Have I chosen correctly here, or should this be left for a longer time. Is it better to grow together as friends first (which, might I add, I have tried, and instead of growing together, it's just caused us both to become discouraged and drift apart), or, is it better to dive head-first into some sort of "status" with someone that you hardly know, just because some sort of chemistry feels right. Because you both hate the feeling of being alone. From one extreme to another, I guess.    Let's give this a whirl

      So. The last few days have been, well, good. Frosted Flakes, actually (grrrrreat!). Halloween, I spent the evening with Kylie and her friend Darcy. We made Darcy say "w00t w00t, yo!". It was great, because I got the impression that she's not really the type that would just blurt things out like that. She had a cool tattoo, though. She had to be home shortly after one, but Kylie and I weren't tired, so I stayed at her house for a bit. A long bit, actually.   Then work, home, blah blah blah blah blah....Last night. Last night. Went to movie with Kylie. Scary Movie 3. It's frosted flakes. Then played pool...I've been playing a lot of pool lately. It's a good game. Meh. This is lame. Completely not in the mindset to write right now.  I have teeth marks on my neck.   under my nose

      My parents have been talking about going on another holiday. To Mexico, or Cuba, or someplace over-toured like that. They keep asking me if I want to go. Honestly, I do not. Not because I don't want to go on a holiday with my family. That is not it at all. It's just that I don't have much desire to go to places like that. Honestly, I'd much rather go to some place like Texas, Illinois, or Oregon. Lately, Edward and I have been talking of visiting Missouri. After we began talking about it, I discovered that  urlLink Natalie  and  urlLink Hannah also live in Missouri (correct me if i'm wrong). Coincidence? I think  so . Anyway. I really need to save my pennies, because I have lots of things to spend them on. First of all, a new car. Well, new to me, used by someone else. My car is probably not going to last through the winter. No siree. Secondly, a  urlLink Minolta Z1 digital camera . And thirdly, the trip mentioned above. As soon as I buy the Matt Good CD that I want, the Autumn to Ashes CD that I want, and the Boys Night Out CD that is on order for me at the HMV in the mall, then all of my extra money is going to be set aside for those three things. No more fast food at the mall, no more movies, CDs, and otherwise useless and wasteful things. And most of all, NO MORE CLOTHES. Oh. Shows. I still have to go to shows.  urlLink Geoff Berner  is playing Red Deer soon, and I am HELLA STOKED! All y'all should join me. That includes you, Ellabel, Natalie, Amber, Manda, EVERYONE!

      What a great day/night it was. Phaedra and Kylie came out here for a change. First off, we just kinda sat around in my messy basement, watching TV. Someone decided it would be great to go and see Holly. So we picked her up and went and got some pizza, which we brought back here and ate while watching the movie "Willard". I still can't decide if I really like that movie or not...Yes. Yes I did. It was only mildly disapointing, all in all, it was good. Hmm...what else did we do...Holly went home because her parents wanted her home for supper, but she ended up coming back here after we got off the phone with Eddie. Then, we pretty much just sat around until Kylie had to take her car back to her mom, but we all went out there, played Taboo, and had a good old time. Now, here I am. I must apologize for the awkward silence while driving Holly home.    Sorry, no deep perspectives on the world tonight

      Last night was frosted flakes! Just went and chilled at the Blarney Stone with lots of friends. Almost everyone who really matters showed up. The big surprise was Crystal. I haven't seen her for quite a while, and though she says she'll call me soon (quote: "sooner than later"), I know it's probably just forced politeness. I could call her, but I'm sure there'd be something going on. Meh.  The music was great. Sam Druckers General Store. I'll find a link later when I have a little bit more time. I have to leave for work in about 20 minutes, and still haven't eaten breakfast. Anyway. I'm just a little hung over today, and if I can sneak a nap in after work before Kylie calls, I should be ready to tackle another evening. Hurrah!  rawr.

      A while ago, it has to be a year, or a year and a half, maybe even two...I was half asleep on the hide-a-bed in the basement of Crystals house. I believe we were waitin for some stupid show to come on, probably Elimidate. As you may or may not know, before the time slot that used to (and I guess, may still) be Elimidate, is a show called Wired. There was a man on the television that night. A man dressed in a suit and playin an accordion. He sang, too. Some of the most beautiful lyrics I had ever heard. I fell in love instantly with the music of  urlLink  Geoff Berner    Last night, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Berner play a live show at the Vat in Red Deer. All I could do was sit there in awe as he picked up his accordion, and I could barely pull my eyes away from him or listen to anything but the sound of his voice and those amazing words for the entire set. Great show...  Some lyrics:  urlLink   Clown and Bard     Her grandfather opened the trust fund In a Baltimore account, But she was six months in the Paris of the Eastern Block By the time it ran out. I met her in that filthy basement Where a fat man ran the bar, and she said "If you're gonna drink that green stuff, you got to light it on fire."  I guess she knew me pretty well Despite the questions that I ducked 'Cause she said, "You'll like it here, Prague is like a Disneyland For the terminally fucked. But it don't fool me cause I can see All this beauty's just a trap set to kill." Then she grabbed my hand tight, said "Let me show you the lights From the top of the hill."  I don't know why I find the leaving so hard I'm so down, Hanging around At the Clown and Bard.  Oh the water in that river's as dirty as the cops, But it shines so pretty at night, That when I held her head as she puked absinthe Off the Charles Bridge, It was a tender and a glamourous sight. We kept up the charade just as long as we could, 'Til I had to get back in the van. She said "I'd like to come with you, But I'm saving up for Baltimore Just as soon as I can..."  Chorus  When I got back into town she wasn't hard to track down, Though they'd moved her down a couple of floors. Cold and half-dead on the un-made bed, Trying to squeeze the speed out through her pores. I offered to buy her a one way back state side, But I cried, begged, pleaded in vain She said "I don't think that I have an urge to die, I really just can't explain"..  Chorus.     see, amazing     By the way, I've moved. http://t-waldo.diaryland.com

      This always happens to me. Find the perfect car, nice, cheap, low kms, owned by an old man, perfect. Was supposed to take him a money order today and sign the bill of sale...but he calls this morning, and says "yeah, my son wants to look at the car first, he thinks he's going to buy it". Jackass. Don't you usually have these things sorted out before you start offering it to other people. Jeexus.

      I'm really not feeling like myself tonight. I feel kind of dazed, and confused, and listless.  I've been thinking a lot lately, and that is usually a bad thing. It usually happens when there's a girl around. We all know where all of my recent "relationships" have gone, and it really is depressing. But I don't know how to stop it. I'm always wondering if I'm doing the right thing or the wrong thing or if I'm going to get hurt or if she's going to get hurt or if I'm standing in the way of something...My brain is travelling at a thousand miles a minute, and it's showing no signs of stopping. I really do need to get away. A change. Something. Anything.  TAKE ME AWAY   I've been trying to write lately. I dug up an old piece of unfinished fiction, and have a poem going as well, but nothing seems to be working. The characters clash, they lack direction. The words don't fit well together. There is something wrong, something is very wrong in my world, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm not sick. And I'm not fatigued. And I'm not drunk.  I don't know. I just don't know anymore...

      Hello. Just a quick update while I'm waiting for my car to warm up and defrost.  Last night, hung out at Kylie's with Phaedra, Holly and...Leslie. Watched movies. Not quite until my eyes hurt, but almost. Had it not been for the trip back into Red Deer from Blackfalds for some more Timmy Ho's, it would have been a lot of movies. 'Twas a grand old time.  Not a big fan of Dirty Dancing.  Or Footloose (which had been in the plans, but was already rented at the movie store). Damn that Kevin Bacon.  Well. My car is looking somewhat melted, so at least it's blowing warm air. Farewell.

      I've been staring at this blank screen for hours now, waiting for something to come to me. I've started writing dozens of poems and dozens of letters, but nothing seemed to accurately convey the feelings I still have for you. That linger inside of my brain, that stay locked forever inside of my heart. You still smile at me from a picture I have taped inside of one of my notebooks. You still have that power over me. You still have a large piece of my heart. I was fifteen when I took that picture of you. Actually, it was my fifteenth birthday. You got me doughnuts, because it is what I asked of you. There's so much more I ask of you now, but, alas, you can not hear this, you will never read this, and all of this wishing will be in vain. In roughly half year, you shaped me in ways that you will undoubtedly never know. Ways that I will probably never fully understand. Sure. There have been girls since you, and you're right, I did love one of them. But why...why then did I always think of you. Why would I feel so lost and angry and hurt when I would look at this picture of you. This picture in my notebook. We were fifteen. Fifteen. Too old to leave well enough alone and just be friends, too young to understand about love and how powerful of a force one's emotions really can be. You're sixteenth birthday, I got you a necklace, and wrapped it tightly in purple tissue paper. What was it? Gold..something. A cross. A gold cross with sparkly stones of some sort in it. Where is that now, I can't help but wonder. Surely, at best, it's tucked in a hidden drawer or packed in a box somewhere. You come across it, once in a while, I would imagine. When you see it there, tucked in the drawer or buried among the other cheap and meaningless trinkets in your jewellery box, do you remember me? Do you think of all those conversations we would carry out on the phone, while playing grown up and pretending what we had was a real relationship? I was afraid to touch you. I was afraid to put my arms around you or wrap my hand around yours. What would have happened, had it all happened years later? What would have happened had we just met now? Would we fall madly in love, or have some sort of meaningless fling  - try desperately to seduce one another, and loose interest a short time later? I suppose there is no way to know, or much point in trying to guess... You were looking good the last time I saw you. Had I not been on my way to the pawn shop to get money for rye, I would have invited you out for an evening. Either to catch up on old times or to get into your pants. Or both. But still, circumstance is circumstance, and I didn't feel that bringing you to the pawn shop with me would have really helped anyway, better to have you see me smiling, walking the mall with a friend, and hardly give you a passing glance. I've still got my pride. But I don't have you. You would think, 5 years later, I would have gotten over such a stupid and petty teenage relationship. And really, I have. I guess you're still in my heart though, and when I listen to the music of the era, I am always reminded of you. The way you said the word horses, and your perfect teeth. It's late now, and I admit, I might be a little drunk, but I've been drinking these memories like they are wine. Not to mention the vodka I just finished. I don't do this often, but I've been drowning in my sorrows ever since I hung up the phone...ever since you hugged me in Rome. Rome. Do you remember Rome? I didn't talk to you the entire time we were there, although at the time, I was still very much in love with you. Well, a different type of love than I have for you now. I hated every single second I was around you, because I wanted to be the one sitting there on the rooftops, breathing in that italian night air, laughing with you. It wasn't me though, it never could be. And so, I wait for you. Next time I see you, I will invite you to come out. And to find this, all you have to do is type my name, Tanner Waldo, into Google. We will meet again, I assure you. What will come of it, though, I can only wish....

      Yeah, so, the diaryland thing obviously isn't going to work for me. I don't know why, but when I'm typing into a diaryland window, it just doesn't feel the same as blogger. Let's just hope that the problems I was having here only temporary.  So, not a lot has been happening as of late. I have been feeling rather good about everything that has been happening, though.   Last night, I went to see "Intolerable Cruelty". I had never heard of it before, which is surprising because it had George Clooney and that other girl...Catherine Zeta Jones..maybe. It was alright. I was with Kylie and Phaedra, so it would have been a good time, even if the movie sucked. Afterwards, I was on my way home, Driving past the road that goes to Crystals house. It made me think, so I pulled over and called her up. So, we hung out for about 45 minutes before she had to leave for some prior engagments. It was nice to talk to her again though.  Yes. Everything is ok.   sunrise, sunset, you hope for, then regret

      My feet hurt so much. *groooaaan* I started to watch the movie "Fubar" last night. It's some mockumentary about two "metal-heads" in Alberta. It was sponsored by the Alberta government, and I must say, I am pleased at where our province puts our tax money.

      So. Last night, at Boston Pizza, Phaedra was playing with my phone, downloading a ringtone, so that my phone would ring differently when she calls. She chose some song I had never heard of before.  Tonight, I'm sitting in Kiels living room, listening to some music on the sattelite. This song comes on, and I really was enjoying it.   Here it comes: It was the same song. Hey Ya by Outkast. It's a good song, and after downloading it and listening to it about 10 times, I've decided it's one of my favorites of the moment, which is odd, because it's not really my preferred genre of music. But hey.   By the way, Phaedra. Since you spent my money to download a ringtone, lets make it worth while. Call me once in a while, so that I can hear the ringer you chose, yo!

      A gathering of RadioShack employees from three different stores. Boston Pizza. Two Future Shop employees sitting a few tables over. Things can get ugly. Well, not really, because Shackies are generally good natured. *mumbles something about Future Shop employees*.   Last night was Justins b-day. I sure am glad I suggested going to BP's, it was a lot funner that sitting around his house watching anime. Blargh. Almost everyone showed up, except for John. John never shows up. Oh well, nothing to be done about that, I suppose. I have been neglecting my photo blog. I have been neglecting my camera. I should go take some pictures sometime.   I'm scheduled to work 11-10 today. I don't really have a problem with that, should make for a profitable day, but tomorrow, I work at 8 in the morning, until 6 at night. I am not doing this. I will go to work at 9:15 tomorrow to open the store. Then, I will leave when I get tired. So take that.  My arm is horribly bruised. I will take a picture of it tonight. My friends bite hard.  I don't really want to go to work today. Wait. Let me rephrase that. I really don't want to go to work today.

      Good morning. No better way to start your morning than by blogging! .....except I have little to say.  So, fellow Canadians. How about that new Primeminister? Let me tell you. Our political system is totally fucked, even more so than the system in the States. I think it's rather stupid how someone, a.k.a. Paul Martin, can be sworn in as Primeminister without an election, but rather, just because he is affiliated with the party in power. I can understand if he was placed there because the elected Primeminister died or got sick...But Jean Cretien was all but forced to resign by his own party. If a party is going to mutiny it's leader, I would imagine it is time for another election. That is the great thing about Canada's political system, we can have elections any old time the government wants within four years, as opposed to exactly every four years in the States.   Meh. I'm gonna stop ranting now. Paul should not be Primeminister. Period.   While we're on the topic, ABOLISH THE SENATE  and  DECLARE INDEPENDANCE FROM THE MONARCH.

      In 45 minutes, the clock will tick past midnight, and Christmas Eve will give way to Christmas Day, 2003. Over the years, Christmas has meant many things to me. Years ago, I would stay up all night, listening to the "Santa Report", a radio show put on by one of the local stations, tracking Santa's progress around the world. I would stay awake all night, giddy with excitment, waiting for the moment, when I could run to the living room to find a mass of pleasantly wrapped boxes under a lighted tree, and together with my brother, tear away the shiny paper and reveal what we had behaved all year for.   Then, as I progressed in my life, and came more in touch with the spiritual side of life, it was a time of rejoice, a time of happiness. It was a time to celebrate the birth of a savior, a man sent to wash away the sins of the world. A time of fellowship and fun. This stage of my life was a defining one, and shaped me into the person I have become today.  Last year. I spent the evening at Crystal's house, with her family, playing Ski Resort Tycoon on my brand new laptop while her extended family rushed around the house, getting ready for supper. Her family did everything on Christmas Eve, and mine did the majority of it on Christmas day. So it all worked out. If I remember correctly, she spend Christmas Eve in my bed, and I had the privilege to wake up on Christmas day with her arms wrapped around me.  And though I don't remember what I got from anyone but her, it may have been the best Christmas of my life.  How things change in the course of a year. Now, I have no one. In a way, I am content with that. I had a conversation with Kiel the other day about how materialistic we are. He brought it up, and I see it in my life, as well. Even the girls we take out, they have to look a certain way and behave specifically. We want to look good, and sometimes, the women we're with end up as accessories, like a watch or a belt. It's not something that I plan for, or soemthing that I even want to happen, but it does. I don't know what to blame for how I've been lately. It could be the work, it could be the music, it could be leaving the church. It could be anything.  This year, Christmas feels so empty. So much nothing.   I want someone, any single one of you, sitting at my kitchen table with me, drinking Rum and laughing about the old times, or the new times, or the unfolding times...Depending on the situation, I suppose. I just don't feel....real, tonight.  I want that feeling back

       In response to "LIberal All The Way"   In Canada, when we hold an election, one votes for their local MP, which are usually, but not always, associated with a federal party. The party who ends up with the most MPs in parliment is then declared the winner, and the leader of said political party becomes our Primeminister. That is fine, while it's not a perfect system, it is surely one of the better ones I had come accross. So. What is my beef with Paul Martin and the Liberal party? Honestly, nothing. Come election time, they may very well be the party that I vote for, so don't go passing me off as some "Liberal-bashing, uneducated kid who knows nothing of anything". In my post, which you clearly misinterpeted, I was simply stating that if, for any reason, a leader is removed from power, another election should be held. In this country, the Primeminister chooses his cabinet, which are the people who essentially run the country. The Primeminister also appoints the Senate in this country. Just in case you don't know, the Senate, which is appointed, actually have more power than the elected Members of Parliment. Since it is the Primeminister that chooses both the cabinet and the senate, it is safe to assume that even though Paul Martin and Jean Cretien are both Liberals, they are still going to take the counrty in very different directions and are going to have differing views on who should be part of their Cabinet. This is the reason why when a leader is removed from power, that a new election should be held; because when the Liberals were last elected to power, they were under rule of Jean Cretien, who had certian goals and visions, which the majority of (voting) Canadians obviously agreed with. Mr. Martin clearly has very different views and objectives for the Liberal party and the country of Canada. An election should be called to determine if Canadians still like what they see in the Liberal party.  And on a more personal note:  I write on this page to encourage healthy discussion and debate. Your comments do not seem to serve any purpose, except to prove how arrogant, unedcuated and just plain stupid some people can be. Your statements contain only opinion. Not that I have anything against opinions, they are yours and you should stick by them, but at least have the decency to support your opinion with fact, logic, and reason. Also, you stated: " Thats just the way it is and you better learn it. " All I'm going to say to that is if every single person in history had that attitude, we would still be living in caves eating grass. Every idean and step forward in the history of man has been a result of someone refusing to settle for "it's just the way things are".

I'm supposed to be going out for drinky drinky with Ashlyn, but she's working until 9ish, and I have a feeling she's going to be too tired, which is fine, because I am also too tired.  I haven't been writing lately, I've fallen into another slump where I have nothing really of substance to say. Maybe a little later.

      Why hello. I know it's been a while since I actually sat down and posted, so I'm going to do a *quick* update right now. It's New Year's Eve. In some parts of the world, 2004 has already arrived. And I still have no idea what I'm doing tonight. Nor who with.  Sure, Kylie is coming. But other than that, I'm totally clueless. Ashley might call. Chantelle and Sherri might call. I might call Edward. Who knows. This is what happened last year. Last year was alright, I suppose. Good company, anyway.  Well. This is probably going to be my last entry for the year, so have a good night, don't do anything too stupid.   Happy New Year *blows on party favour noise maker thingy*.

      I heard once, in CALM class, I believe, that a person's morals and belief system are intact at about age 15, and barring some life changing incident, usually do not change for the rest of their life. I would beg to differ. I've now been out of high school for about a year and a half, and I am a very different person now than I was then. Almost every single aspect of what I believe has changed. I used to believe that alcohol was a very evil thing, and should not be consumed by anyone. Now, I see it as something to enjoy, in moderation, to heighten conversation and meet new people. In politics, I was once very leftist in my beliefs, with a socialist attitude that made members of the NDP look like Conservatives. Now, I'm almost more to the right, I still believe in social programs and a degree of welfare, but also value the economic upsides of a free market. On a religious note, I was once a strong Catholic, out to convert the world. Now, while I don't deny the possibility that there may be a higher power out there, I do know that it is  not  the God that has been created by mankind. As mel put it, I was "out to save the world, or at least that worthy of being saved". It rings true, I was going to save the world, I was going to make a difference, I was going to win.  It's a different world out here, and I suppose people change accordingly to their surroundings. Or perhaps we just grow up, grow out of the feeling of immortality, and realize that the world just isn't meant to be saved.

      So. I'm eating one of those microwavable chicken bowls from Superstore, and the only thing I'm finding worthy of entering my body is the chicken, but the "chicken" bowl is mostly comprised of gross noodles. How quaint.  The other night, I wentout. A night on the town, it was supposed to be. With Ashlyn and Danielle. Sadly, I got seperated from them after only a short while at Bellini's, and ended up at Club Xtatic with Bryce. I'm sorry, but there's just something about watching girls dance around naked and throwing quarters at them that doesn't really make me think "hey, this is a good time. Yes. I'm having a good time". A beautiful woman is to be held and cared for. A beautiful woman is not a play-thing for you. Boys are stupid.  A note about Bellini's. It was the first time I had ever been in there, and I really did enjoy it. There was still decent music, ladies, dancing, and all that jazz, but it was a better atmosphere. Sure, there were a lot of old people there, but I think that's what made it good, it wasn't all beautiful people, it wasn't all young people, it was just people. People out to have a good time. I'm just out to have a good time.     When people are young, they are so full of life, so full of talent and beauty. I was reminded of this truth last night, in a few ways. I was at my old high school, for their production of "Village of Idiots", which my brother is in. I was reminded of the fun had and the friends made there. The same art is hanging in the hallways. Something seen every day by so many is probably long forgotten by the artist. I couldn't help but wonder if that artist still paints, if they're still involved in the creative process. Did they continue doing what they were good at and what they loved? Or did they simply become working drones, letting that creative flame get snuffed out by the harsh winds of the world? I'm willing to bet the case is similar to the latter.  As I sat down in my chair, my grade seven bus driver was sitting beside me. I've always thought that everyone should be just like her. She is one of the happiest, friendliest people I know. She was always in such good mood when I would ride to and from school every day. I started to talk to her, and she said she wanted to let me know that she appreciated the articles I used to write in the local newspaper. It's so great to see people say what they think. Especially young people. She said. I got to thinking about all of the things I had written about during the final years of my school career. Everyone seemed to enjoy what I was writing, even if they didn't always agree. Again, I began to think about talents, and how passionate we are about everything when we are young. So many people lose that when they graduate and go out into the world. I've lost it, I can't write anymore. I read back over this blog, and there is so much crap on here, despite my best efforts, nothing works, it's gone, and I don't know how to get it back. You have to do what you love, otherwise, what is the point in living?  The play started, and this subject was on my mind for the entire night. So many gifted actors, my brother included. But what is to become of them? What is to become of these gifts they have? Maybe life really does end after high school. I'm sure the best day of my life has already passed, as most of the people I know have probably already experienced the moment when they will be happiest. It's sad. This kind of world, where it's a sin to be creative, it's taboo to do what  you  want to do. I don't want this kind of world.  So. I pray you, continue doing what you love and what you're gifted at. Don't ever stop. Don't let it stop....

        Finding Arar 'leaker' is the priority: Martin   CTV.ca News Staff  The investigation into a leaked secret document in the Maher Arar case should be looking at  who leaked the information, not the journalist who received it , Prime Minister Paul Martin said Thursday.  He was commenting at a news conference in Davos, Switzerland on the RCMP raid Wednesday on the office and home of Ottawa Citizen journalist Juliet O'Neill. They were looking for any secret documents she might have that were used in a Nov. 8 story on the Arar case.    I'm beginning to rethink my point of view on Paul Martin.

      I've been following your actions from behind this screen, accross miles and miles of wire and electrical signals. I see you struggling, and my heart still hurts for you. I've moved on, of course, but you were, and will always be, I suppose, an important part in my life. Without you, I would be a very different person than the one I am today. And though we may have been so terribly wrong for one another, I thank you for the things I am achieving, the mindset you left me with, the feeling that the "next one" has to compare to you. I've told them all that "I just want to be friends", or that "It just doesn't feel right". It's true, I suppose, to tell them those things. It's not a lie to leave out the reason why, is it?. That the confused girl with the burning passion and utter apathy for everything has raised my standards so high, to such an unreachable level, that nobody I have met would ever suffice. I am greatful for that.   Our promises all become lies, and we grow into very different people. Tim Horton's will not always be there, and there will always be a growing distance and discomfort between two souls

      I went to see "The Butterfly Effect" last night. It is possibly the saddest movie I've ever seen. It demonstrates that life is full of compromise and sacrifice, to get one thing, you have to go without another, and if you really, truly love someone, and sincerely want what's best for them, you would be 100% willing to take them out of your life so that they could be better. And he did.  You all have to see that movie.

       Those Loving Rafters   Four a.m. with the frost on the lawn It's happening now, so suddenly, no one knows It's been inside me for far too long Keys in the ignition, backpack full of clothes  I couldn't say that I love you Without the truth showing in my eyes I couldn't bring myself to say farewell I couldn't live with those lies...   So I'm driving faster Nothing seems as important as before Not looking to see who's running after Yeah, I'm still craving an eastern shore  So who are you going to be, My faint and faltering friend? Just one more headstone along the way Another casualty of my hesitations  We've made a rope to hang From the ties that bind Rafters of our love Still, I hope that you will find:  All that you desire and a little bit more A thousand lonely beaches and a silent shore Twenty million smiles and love worth dying for But me, I'm still craving an eastern shore  Does it really matter who Wakes up with their head on your shoulder At least you've got someone to play with your hair It's better than being alone.  I'll send you a postcard or write you a letter Just to let you know that I am alive But I'll be dead, I'll be dead, with you in my head It's better than being alone.

        Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     i also updated my fotopage today.

      Oh wait. I guess we don't have to wait for a new disease for pigs, turns out, they've got bird flu, too!   reposted from CTV.ca    Concerns about a mutated form of a bird flu arising in pigs have long troubled medical experts, who are worried that it could be the next step in a human-to-human mutation.   Pigs are unique in that they can be infected by both human and avian influenza viruses. That makes them an ideal vessel for bird and human viruses to mix and mutate into powerful and dangerous new strains.   Epidemiologists warn that keeping animals in close contact on farms promotes opportunities for cross-infection. The markets of Southeast Asia, with birds, pigs and humans in close contact, are prime breeding grounds for such events.   The flu pandemic of 1918 was due to a virus that was avian in origin, but also had strong similarities to pig flu viruses. A completely new virus emerged and spread around the globe in around six months, killing as many as 40 million people worldwide.     While we're talking about diet, according to the current fad diet, which declares war on carbohydrates, we're all supposed to stay away from high-carb foods, such as bread and orange juice  So. For breakfast, I guess we can't eat bacon and eggs, nor can we eat toast or orange juice. If you ask me, bacon, eggs, toast and orange juice is one of the best breakfasts a person can eat. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to sacrifice those foods (which have been around for centuries with little evidence of them causing heart disease or obesity throughout history), in favour of safer, healthier foods such as Corn Pops and dark colas. I know that if it's made by humans in a factory, it's got to be far safer than all this disease infested stuff nature can throw at us!  I'm going to start a diet, called the "LOW PARANOIA DIET".

      I guess we can't eat any meat anymore. What with BSE (Mad Cow Disease), and the Chicken Flu. I guess we could still eat pork, pork is probably still safe, until they come up with some sort of Pig Meningitis. And then maybe they'll move on to fish.   Once again, the human race has blown things totally out of proportion. Don't get me wrong, Bird Flu, though I don't know all of the details, appears to be a very lethel virus, but destroying thousands of chickens that may have come in contact with a bird that may have come in contact with a bird that may have come in contact with a bird that has tested positive for bird flu.

      I was thinking about going to bed. In fact, I've been in bed since about seven o'clock this evening. Then I decided that I should write. So I tried to write. I stared at this God damned blogger page for an hour, while idly talking to Robyn and Phaedra. They're typing, expending energy to communicate with me, and I feel guilty that I can't give all of myself back to them, but my mind is elsewhere.  Nowhere in particular,  really, just elsewhere. Really though, isn't that the story of our lives? So many of us are restless, waiting for an excuse to be elsewhere.  Nowhere in particular,  really, anywhere but where we're at. If you could relocate, just be anywhere, where would you be? I think I would choose Nebraska. Or Witchita, I've always like the sound of Witchita. Maybe even as far south as Texas. It's of little consequence, as I said, elsewhere. It's not that I want to be in Texas or Witchita, i just don't want to be here. What I wouldn't give to just get in the car, change my name to Tobias, and drive, with camera or pen or both in hand. Maybe a girl named Sarah or Melody or Chastity or Sue in the passenger seat. No, sleeping in the back seat. I could wake her up every 100 miles so we could get some lemonade or some pancakes. We could live on the third floor of an aging apartment building in the middle of the city and she could fall asleep in my arms on the couch in the middle of the afternoon.  But after a while, Sarah or Melody or Chastity or Sue would leave, because it's what people do these days. We all crave change, and eventually, the sex would get old or one of use would develop a drug or drinking problem, and those days would be gone. She would get the apartment, and I would be alone again, sitting outside H & R Block, posting to my blog via the wireless internet connection that I stumbled accross. And just like now, I'd be screaming for someone to take me away from here. That's why I write. That's why we write. To be heard. Stephen Boissoin once asked me why I write. After telling him I didn't know, he told me why he writes. "To get a reaction". I pondered it carefully, and silently nodded my head. I think that is the second last conversation I ever had with the controversial Stephen Boissoin. Stephen Boissoin has nothing to do with this entry.  Why though. Why write? I will die, and you will die. We will all change and drift away, and then eventually, we will die. How many of you will be at my funeral? Two? Three? If I'm lucky. We are all alone in this. A depressing, yet very accurate truth. And after I'm gone and you're gone, who will this matter to? When the end of time is upon the world, what will it matter if I wrote or not? What will it matter if I ever got to Witchita or not? It won't. And so, I will stay here, in bed. And sleep.  Not because I am tired, but because I simply don't want to be awake anymore.

      I am so bored. A boredom that goes deeper than just "there is nothing to do right now". No. This boredom is much stronger, and long term than that. I am bored with my job, and I am bored with existence in general.  The other day, I was in HMV, squandering more money on DVDs and CDs. I got to talking to HMV-girl. We went to the same school for one semester, and talked around the fire one night at a punk show. She was telling me about the one act she's working on right now, and I told her to let me know when the performance would be. She said she would, and proceeded to ask me if I was still into photography. Now, I was never  really  into photography, but I guess it was enough for her to remember me for that. I told her that I never had time for anything like that anymore. So. Today, I am going to put on my hat, get in my car, put gas in my car, and go to take some pictures. No theme, no "artistic message". Just pictures.

      I haven't written much about what has been going on in my life lately. Really, there hasn't been that much. Amanda was down last weekend, so I was out at the bars for two nights. Ran into Angela. I never really was friends with her, she was more of a friend of a friend, but I bought her and her friends a drink anyway, danced a little. Nice to see some familiar faces. Going through my phone book the other day, I noticed her phone number was in there. Did I put that there? Maybe. I can't remember. I probably won't use it anyway.  Going to Lethbridge next weekend. Got bill for dentistry work yesterday, got reminder notice for insurance yesterday, cell phone bill should be here in a few days. Going to be a tough two weeks. Probably will not pay dentist for another two weeks. Good thing my work benefits are covering most of it. Probably won't pay cell phone bill until later, either. Singed up for long distance calling plan on cell phone. Now need to find someone to call long distance? Probable waste of money.  Going to be expensive trip to Lethbridge, I think. What with bars and tattoos. Or piercings.  See. Told ya. Nothing.  Oh yeah, Scottish girl is back in the mall, this time her booth is set up directly outside of RadioShack. Heh Heh.

      The world around us in changing. 10 years ago, certain words weren't allowed on television at all, and now are found commonly spewing from our television sets during "family based" prime-time hours. 10 years ago, teachers in public schools would talk somewhat openly about God and Heaven. Now, the mere mention of religion in a public school is taboo. 10 years ago, a person could smoke in the food court of a mall. While I don't agree with some of these changes, they are a perfect example that society is changing, and it is changing quickly.  10 years ago, talk of a casino was rejected by this community. 10 years is a long time, and much has changed here. This town does need more "razzle dazzle". If you drive down Lakeshore drive on any summer night, you will find the bars packed to the rafters with young people from accross the country, out just to have a good time. On long weekends, and perhaps even a regular Saturday night, I think it would be safe to say that many of these bars and lounges are filled to capacity. The demant in definatley there.  Yes, Sylvan Lake is a "family oriented town", and we do hold many events geared towards families. A casino would not change this in any way, it would just add a greater diversity to the activities this town offers. It's not like the casino would set up a dozen VLTs at the Polar Dip or have a Blackjack table set up outdoors for 1913 days. It would stay confined within it's walls, only accessible to those of age. To the argument that casino's harm people with gambling problems, I won't completely disagree. So, should a casino go ahead in this town, why not pass a bylaw, that would read something to the effect that "10 percent of all funds generated by a commercial establishment as a result of games of skill or chance be placed into a public fund". Use this public fund to sponsor a gambling and substance abuse awareness and recovery program.  The idea of a casino in Sylvan Lake needs more research and public debate, no doubt, but don't shoot the idea down before it's had a chance to get off the ground.

      Holy cow. It's been over a week since I've posted. It's not that I've been busy, and it's not that nothing has really happened. Still, just haven't had much to say.  So. Instead of telling you about all of the not so exciting things that have been happening to me lately, I'll just rant.  The copyright board of Canada is following suit of the Americans and is now suing people for sharing files on the internet. Unlike the states, here in Canada, it is not illegal to download copyrighted material off of the internet, but it is illegal to upload, or "share" it. Half of my purchased CD collection, which is at roughly $500 since I started it in October (I've owned CDs before, but have always lost them or whatever, this is actually a "collection"), are from artists that I would not have known existed if not for Kazaa and Bit Torrent. Anyway. This rant is not about sharing music. It is about the waste of resources that is going on by tracking down the people who share music and video files. You know what would be a far better use of the same resources? Tracking down those who share child pornography. Let's face it, Pedofiles are a much bigger concern for society today than are music lovers.  Ok. Short post, but I'm done.

      I am stuck at work right now, watching the people in the hall walk by, hoping that they don't come into the store. The store is in shambles right now, they took half our lights out and put them in the new store, so it is somewhat dim in here. The back room is a mess, because they took our shelves and put them in the new store, as well. Ah. The joys of moving.   This job is driving me squirrely. I am pacing around, like some kind of animal trapped in a cage (despite all my rage). What I need is a change. I don't want to hate old people, i don't want to hate children, and I don't want to feel that I have to rip people off so that I can barely scrape by financially.  I think my days as a RadioShack whiz kid are coming to an end.

      After some recent discussions, I will offer my insight into the world of blogs.  I've been talking with a few different people about the feelings to harbour towards people who's blogs you read regularly, even if you have never met them in real life. If you don't hear from them for a few days, sometimes you get worried that maybe they have been in some horrible accident, or even perhaps that they are just sick. So why do we worry about our blogging peers?  I think the reason is because if you have read someone's blog regularly for any length of time, you probably know them better than people who have spent time with the person, but has not read the blog. This is due to the very personal nature of blogs, as many people write with little, or no inhibition that would normally keep them from letting the rest of the world know the true them.  A blog is a window.   In other news. Last night, I got on a bus with 250 other people, and rode it all the way to Edmonton. Sonja and Amber met me at the bar. It was good to see Sonja again.   ....i really thought I'd have more to say about that.

      I was here, at 4:27 in the morning. There are two things I want to write about. No, make that three. But two that I will write about.  However. I've noticed since I've started typing this, that my fingers seem not to be co-operating, and I have been using the backspace key about twice as much as usual. So, I will wait until the morning, even though it's a fact that most people write better during the early morning hours. Just look, I am not saying anything and I've managed to fill up a few lines of space. More shit to sit on Blogger and Tripod's servers. Note the proper use of the apostrophe.  I will update tomorrow about: My night at the bar and Sonja Hehli. and Why blogs are important for the world.

      So, I've been watching this new show, and I'm really liking it.  From  ABC.com :   Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital is the haunting new 15-hour drama series created directly for television by the award-winning, bestselling master of horror. Using Lars Von Trier's Danish miniseries Riget (a.k.a. The Kingdom) as a point of inspiration, King tells the terrifying story of The Kingdom, a hospital with a bizarre population that includes a nearly blind security guard, a nurse who regularly faints at the sight of blood and a paraplegic artist whose recovery is a step beyond miraculous. When patients and staff hear the tortured voice of a little girl crying through the halls, they are dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or unseen powers … but at their own peril.    It's got it's moments full of cheese, but who can name one creation of the horror genre that doesn't? Anyway, if you're even remotely a King or Horror fan, you should check it out. In Red Deer, it's on ABC (Channel 20) at 11pm on Wednesdays.  And guess what that means? It's on....RIGHT NOW!

      So, I'm sitting on my couch right now, watching CNN, just killing my last day off before I head back to work. There was just a story on about three girls, all eleven years of age. They apparently falsely accused a homeless man of attacking them in a park to cover up why they were late coming home from school. The guy served eight months in prison before the girls confessed that they had made it all up. If i knew more about the case, I would tell you, but I don't because the story was interrupted by a press conference about John Ashcroft's gallstones. I mean, come on people, I know he's a big part of the American government and all, but do we really need a 5 minute segment about him going to the hospital for gallstones? I don't think the story even warrants one of those little headlines at the bottom of the screen.  The things that pass as news these days.

      Tanner would like to put in on record that he officially supports Jeff Sloychuk.    from: http://ca.geocities.com/rdpoc/executives/chairperson.htm    "Jeff is looking forward to leading POC forward through 2004, while finishing his second year of a BA in Political Science. As last year's External Affairs Executive, Jeff gathered contacts and supporters within the news media and other community organizations and hopes to put those to good use this year. He also writes a political column for the campus newspaper, The Bricklayer, and is the President of the Political Science Society.  Jeff is a libra, bisexual, and deejays at the FarSide Lounge and elsewhere!    Jeff is also your (Red Deer's) official nominee for the Federal NDP party in the upcoming election. If you are concerned with freedom, democracy, health care, and human rights, vote NDP this year.  Vote for Jeff!

      My story starts at roughly four in the afternoon, while I was waiting in Starbucks for Robyn to show up. I was getting a little bored, so I started wandering around Chapters, looking at various books and magazines. I picked up this months issue of "Skeptical Enquirer" for two reasons. The first, this months theme is religion based, on whether or not God is real, which is an issue that interests me greatly. But we'll get into that later. The second reason I bought it, is because my friend Bryce Williams wrote a letter to the editor which was actually published in this issue. It is all rather exciting.  Robyn showed up and we hurried out of Starbucks because that place was crazy busy this afternoon. After wandering around the mall aimlessly for a while, we headed to one of the local theatres to see "The Secret Window". It is a good movie. Not one of my all time favorites, but I will see it again, for sure.  After the movie got out, I drove to Tim Hortons, where we talked casually about my (fictional) gay relationship with a man named John, his drug dealing, trial, prison time, and how it all affects our eight year old daughter, Maya. For further insight into that, read today's "Dear Abby". Also included in the conversation were teenage lesbianism and the benifits of pillow fights.  Then, just as we were leaving, the worst thing happened! Robyn walked right smack into a truck! It was partially my fault, for distracting her with my intelligent conversation, and as it was driving by, she stepped off the curb and walked right into it!   Alternate (and true) Ending   Then, I drove her home.   The end.

      So. I felt like I should write. So here I am, quickly leaving a few lines for you to read. As soon as my waffles are done, I'm afraid I will leave again. I haven't had a lot to say lately. Some of my longer term readers my remember the short story I had started a while back:   He sits. Stroking the cat. He is bored. Life has been feeling so wasted lately. Such educational pursuits as downloading porn and listening to "You're Pretty When I'm Drunk" by the Bloodhound Gang just aren't fulfilling him anymore. People fill their lives with such trivial things. A young woman flashes on his screen. Such a beautiful lady, reduced to nothing more than a nameless promotion for an equally nameless casino. Gambling never really appealed to him. As he is about to close the window that has interrupted his game of solitare, he notices her eyes. Beautiful. Shimmering. Sad.   I think I might finish it. Although, I don't remember where I intended to take the characters...perhaps.   The toaster pops as the smell of burnt waffle fill the air. He ignores the flashing orange box at the bottom of his screen, indicating a new instant message.  Let the waffles cool

       Found on Kylie's Site:   TWO TOUGH QUESTIONS   Question 1:  If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?    Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.     Question 2:   It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.    Candidate A -   Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists.  He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.    Candidate B -   He was kicked ou t of office twice, sleeps until   noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.   Candidate C -   He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.     Which of these candidates would be your Choice?   Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.     ----------------------------------------------      Candidate A: is Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Candidate B: is Winston Churchill.  Candidate C: is Adolph Hitler.    And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.   Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone.   Never be afraid to try something new.   Remember:   Amateurs built the Ark   Professionals built the Titanic

      Sorry that I haven't written in a while. I have been very busy, but I have seven minutes to tell you about my busy-ness, and then I must be off for lunch at grandma and grandpa's house. (Apostrophe). We have successfully moved the Bower Place RadioShack to it's new location. That was a lot of god-damned work. Sunday: 8 hours. Monday: 12 hours. Tuesday: 15 hours. Wednesday: 8 hours. Thursday: 12 hours. Friday: 15 hours. Needless to say, I am quite beat. And as I'm sure many of us know, moving anything causes countless injuries. I never want to see another RadioShack again. Luckily, I am off today, and better yet, I'm out of there in two weeks.  Jeff Sloychuk was here. I feel touched. VOTE FOR HIM! Anyway. Off to lunch, now.

      I decided something today. When I booted up my computer, I would not close a single pop-up ad. I have now been online for roughly 5 minutes, and the current count is 13 internet explorer windows, and 2 other windows. Of these, one is my doing. The rest came from nowhere.  But that is not why I am writing. I am writing to complain about the new Godsmack album, "The Other Side". I do like this album, it's a fairly good disc, however, it is not the acoustic awakening it is proclaimed to be. When I think "acousitc", I think raw, pure music. Twangy guitars, one or two off notes, and one-take recordings. I guess my view of acoustic is different from the rest of the worlds, because this album, though good, is still very much a studio album, with obvious mastering and pitch-shifting. It sounds like a blatant rip off of the band "Tantric" from about 3 years ago. That said: Buy this CD, it's 9 dollars at HMV. Just don't expect the genius that this album has been made out to be.

       Raw. (Santa's Tabernacle)   Give me a few more days And a list of demands So long you work your tongue. Raw. Just reading it to me.  Commandments scrawled across Tablets cold as stone. To scrape knees. Raw. As you fail. Fall. Fail. Fall.  I didn't know that wine could sour And this bread has long been stale. From the outside looking in. I can see the strings. I can hear.  You and Dayven. Have worlds in common. Imagine. They can make themselves feel anything. It's all in your head. Hoping for something else.  I've taken a few more days. We've broken up. Like radios through snow. Ears frostbitten through snow. Raw. Raw. White.  So bring your reward. A bag full of toys. They'll behave for you. They'll be. Have. Give. For you.  It's the coal that keeps us warm.

      it snowed again today.  Here's some lyrics from the song "Swing Life Away" by Rise Against that I found fitting to the mood of the day.  "...I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move, The winter's so cold, summers over too soon. So let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow.  I've got some friends, some that I hardly know, But we've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world....  ...If love is a labour, I'll slave 'till the end. I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand..."    indeed

      I feel so empty today. I'm laying here on my couch, basking the halogen glow of my basement lighting. My basement is a mess, and in desperate need of decorating. I'm surrounded by these things...magazines on music and art and politics, books on religion and war. Soda Cans and plates with some sort of dried up sauce on them. At first glance, it must appear as if I'm a rather intelligent person. The type of person who, though a little sloppy, is creative and will one day make a big name for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am uninspired and unmotivated. There's much I would like to accomplish, but what for? I guess we all feel like we have nothing to live for sometimes.   It's been a while since I've genuinely smiled. I laugh sometimes, at work or with friends, but there's always something fake about it. Something...forced.    she has to love music. and the somewhat eccentric.

      So. It seems I've recently falled to the epidemic. The same one that has plagued Mel and Natalie and Colin. I feel like I have abandoned my blog. Not because I don't enjoy writing anymore, and not because I don't have the time to (today, I watched a movie not just once, but one and a half times). It's not like I don't have anything to say, either. There's lots of things I would like to write about...but...I don't know what's going on.  I am alive though. Been going to work, reading a book, getting phone bills. I got my long distance bill today. 17 minutes worth of calling to New Mexico for $1.80. Since the service charges are $5.00, it doesn't make any sense to have this plan. Maybe I should move someplace far so I have an excuse to call long distance.   Easter was good. Dug out lawn furniture for deck now that snow is melted. I love my deck.  Meh.  Here's to blogging.

      Notice the new link on the right of your screen. You should click there, and join the boycott against the RIAA.  I am boycotting the RIAA group of companies until they drop the lawsuits against our American friends who enjoy file sharing. The site to which I'm linking you contains a nifty little RIAA radar, where you type in an artist, and it will tell you if it's safe or not!  Hooray for passive activism.

      I've written about it before, and I'll write about it again. I hate the bar. Not all bars, mind you. I like pubs and lounges, where you can chit chat with your friends and eat wings. I was at Catwalk tonight, and nobody looked happy. Why go someplace or do somthing if it doesn't make you happy? Everybody just seems to put their bodies on display for others to grope and fondle. I want to meet a girl at a pub. That's my kind of people.  *cheers to cell phones and new jobs*

      I took my poor old dog, Jake to get his nails clipped today. They were getting really long, so much that they were starting to twist under his feet so he was starting to walk on them. He seems to be moving a little quicker now, and I think that was part of the reason why we wasn't walking unless he absolutely had to.  I got my income tax refund from the government, went to the bank and cashed it, then gave all of it to my parents. While I was at the bank, she said there was a note on my account to offer me a Visa card. So I filled out the application. Hopefully it goes through, so I can finally start selling things on e-bay (instead of just spend, spend, spend).  I watched the movie Big Fish last night, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I am going to watch it again tonight, since my mom's aunt from Canmore is going to be here, and she has an appreciation for fine films.  And that, my friends, is my update.

      BANDS: Crowned King, Blue Skies at War, Boys Night Out, Alexisonfire VENUE: G-Mac Hall, U of C, Calgary.  This was probably the best show I've ever been to, as far as the level of energy from both the bands, and the crowd.  Crowned King was one of those bands I'd heard of, but never actually heard. At first I was a little skeptical about them, as they do have a three piece brass section. Don't get me wrong, God bless ska bands for doing their thing, I just haven't really been into the ska thing for a few years now. Anyway, they ended up being really great. Their lyrics are great, and they don't go to overboard with the horns, in fact, you hardly notice them at all.  Blue Skies At War was up next, and damnit, they rock. For a band that had their van "turn(ed) into confetti" when they hit some black ice and slid into the side of a mountain, and having a sick lead singer, I thought they sounded surprisingly solid and together.  I had wanted to see Boys Night Out since buying their album in early November, and was thrilled when I heard they were doing some local shows. They sound completely different live than on their heavily produced studio album, Make Yourself Sick. (Ferret Records) That said, they still put on a very good show if you can put expectations aside. High energy and great hair, what more could you ask for in a rock band?   And Alexisonfire was Alexisonfire. Great show band. I've seen them before and believe I've written about it before. This was exactly the same minus the 200 people on stage.   And now:  HURRAH FOR :   1) UofC Student's Union member who were the event staff. They have a neat system for dealing with crowd surfers and rail jumpers. First time you go over the rail, you get shown a sign that says "next time, you're out", then they but a big fat permanent marker line down your arm. If you end up over the rail again, the guy sees the big line, turns it into an 'X' and kicks you out of the show.  2) Crowned King for coming from Vancouver to a city that kicked their team right out of the playoffs, and proving that Ska can be cool.    POO ON YOU :  1) The girls with the photo passes. Somehow, three girls, one with a shitty $200 digital camera with the slowest shutter speed I've ever seen, and two with handi-cams got photopasses, yet the guy with the $1500 Nikon next to me, did not. If you're going to videotape a show, cover the microphone with a think piece of cloth, such as a touque, otherwise the audio will sound like shit, and the photo pass may as well of gone to someone else. Like me.  2) The 12 year old girls next to me. Whenever the pit would get kind of crazy and someone would hit them from behind (we were standing at the front of the crowd), they would jab an elbow into their ribs. After a few minutes of that, I said to them "if you don't like it, get the fuck out", to which they replied with "fuck you". The kid behind them gave me a thumbs up and crashed into them extra hard. 5 minutes later they were gone.

      You know what my absolute favorite thing about work is? When someone brings in something that is broken, looking all mad and stressed, throw the thing on the counter and stare at me. Like I know what the fuck is wrong with it. Why don't you tell me what it's doing? Usually I just say "Hi", and stare at them, until they realize that they might actually have to *gasp* talk to the salesperson. Stupid People.  Another favorite situation of mine, is when someone is yelling and yelling and making a big huff, and I just turn to them and say, "Sir, we don't tolerate this kind of behavior in our store, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. When you're ready to use your "inside voice", you're welcome to come back and if you can treat me like an adult, maybe I can do something for you".  Usually, if someone has a problem, and they didn't purchase our extended warranty, there is nothing I can really do right at that moment. Sure, if they're good natured, or really nice and understanding about the situation, I am willing to bend the rules or pull some strings for them, but as soon as they call the phone a "piece of shit", use the word "fuck" in my store, are rude to me, or use threats to call the BBB or whatever, I pretty much just say there's nothing I can do. It's for the same reason governments don't negotiate with terrorists, because if you let them get away with it once, they will try it again.   So: The moral of the story. DON'T BE A FUCKING ASSHOLE!

      Wow. Blogger changed, again. For those of you not using Blogger, you probably don't care, and those of you who do, probably already know. So nevermind.  Sorry I haven't updated for a while. I only really have one story. The other night, I went out with Megan (formerly of RadioShack fame), because it was one of her friends going away celebration type things. Anyway, when I got there, Terry Anderton and Kelsey Lavoie were both there. I was super surprised to see Terry (I knew Kelsey and Megan were kind of chummy). It's such a small city.  And that's really all the news I have.

      EPISODE 350!  Yes, that's right. This is my 350th post with Blogger, though some of those were at awakeatmidnight instead of rough-draft. It's of little concequence anyway.  So. I've secured two job interviews in the last two days. First off, I was dealing with a customer at work, doing a huge activation, and my cell phone would not stop ringing. Turns out, it was the Ford dealership giving me a call back. Interview there on Thursday.   A few weeks back, when I was drunk out of my tree, I applied at Tim Horton's (don't ask, it seemed like a good idea at the time), so who calls last night? Tim Horton's. "Were you still seeking employment with us?" "Uhm....No." "Oh. Alright then."  Today, while talking to my father about the job interview at Ford, he decided to walk next door to my uncle's house (who's worked at just about every car dealership in town), and see if he could call the Chevy dealership for me. He did, and I have an interview there on Monday, as well.   A penny for your thoughts, I'll try to understand Let's go out for a walk, c'mon baby take my hand, I'll listen really hard, to everything you say, I might not change your life, but I just might make your day.

I can't really say why, I only had one drink last night, and was in bed by midnight, as well.  I've been listening to a lot of Ani DiFranco and Alison Krausse lately, a lot of mellow stuff. Seems to fit the mood of the day. The other night I just sat on my bed, playing with my slinky (get your mind out of the gutter), and thinking, for about an hour an a half, before finally falling asleep with the light on.    someday, some morning, sometime

      The past is not always a pretty thing, and it's something many of us prefer to keep hidden. The skeletons in the closet wouldn't be so bad if they didn't talk. I was reminded of this today, when asked about the activities of that other kid, the other Tanner Wade Waldo who existed a little over a year ago. He was the one who drank until nothing hurt anymore, and he was the one who aquired a reputation as somewhat of a player, a slut, a man-whore. I don't believe there is any basis for such talk against me, though I do understand there the mis-understanding could occur. Luckily, I killed him off before the trend continued. Now, I'm not sure what she thinks, because I know what I would be thinking if I was in her situation, and that's not what I want her to think at all. I almost feel terrible for what is developing between us, because she deserves a thousand times better than the view I have in the rear view mirror. The decisions I've made have been killing me since the day they occured, and they are killing me now. We've all wished for a giant eraser, just to clear the slate, start over at square one, and have the change to make the same mistakes over again. Or different mistakes.  I don't know where I was going with this. So I'm going to go to bed.

      Dear Sylvan Lake residents, business owners, and media:  Please be advised that I, Tanner Waldo, intend to run in the 2004 municipal election in the town of Sylvan Lake, AB, for the position of town council.  With the number of young people running in this upcoming election, I would like to take a moment to state that my decision to run for council was made long before Chris Janke and Kevin Brown made their intentions known. The platform you will find attached has been in the works for several months. While I do welcome the amount of youth running in the election, I am aware that, as a young candidate, I must strive exceptionally hard to help voters distinguish between a “fringe” candidate, such as Janke, and reliable, sincere candidates, such as I consider myself.  With that said, I am looking forward to running with Janke, Brown, and all the other candidates. I am confident that together, we all believe in the power of the vote, and will be able to rally a large voter turnout. When citizens vote, democracy has prevailed, and we all win, regardless of who is elected in the end.  My platform is one of change, and emphasizes safety, smart development and creating a “walkable” community, as well as recognizes the importance of youth and seniors in our society. While the entire platform can be found enclosed, here are a few key objectives:  Engage young people in local politics by holding occasional town meetings at the local high school, H.J. Cody. Encourage more “away from shore” commercial development. Require residential and commercial developers to create “green space”, such as playgrounds and walking paths in all new developments. Create a safer municipality by lighting up identified “dark areas”, and making it illegal to cross the railway tracks anywhere other than at designated crossings. Restrict the parking of recreational vehicles and trailers along Lakeshore Drive during summer months, and act on completed traffic studies.  Please watch for me around town, and if you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me at tannerw@telus.net, or (403) 392-5721. Regardless of who you vote for, stand up for your freedom this fall, and vote!  Sincerely,   Tanner Waldo, Sylvan Lake, AB.                  Tanner Waldo Sylvan Lake Municipal Election Platform 2004                Seniors and Youth:  Seniors and youth are two very important parts of our society, yet they are often over looked when it comes to making decisions that matter most to them. Currently, Sylvan Lake does have a “Youth Advisory Board”, which is a group of students and youth, appointed by council, to represent the youth of Sylvan Lake at meetings with council. However, it is the general feeling that this board is rarely taken seriously, and has essentially been disbanded. If elected to council, I would encourage the youth to re-form a similar board, and would be willing to personally meet with this board once a month, and in addition to their meetings with council, I would personally take their views and opinions to council at every meeting. I would also encourage our senior population to form a similar board, and I would likewise be willing to meet with them on a monthly basis.   There has always been much talk in our community about creating a Youth Drop In Centre. I would support the project that is currently underway, under direction of the current Sylvan Lake Community Youth Services Association. This is an independant non-profit volunteer board that governs themselves, is not connected to the Town of Sylvan Lake or the Community Youth Services Project.  If elected to council, I would attempt to work closely with social studies and humanities teachers in our local elementary, middle, and high schools to get youth involved in the political process by inviting the classes to attend town council meetings, and propose to council that regular town council meetings be periodically held in the schools of Sylvan Lake, with an open question period for students to voice their concerns. I believe more students would attend open council meetings if they were held on “home turf”, somewhere more familiar to them.  I would also propose council look into the cost operating the current seniors shuttle to transport seniors to and from council meetings, with a “meet the council” night held at the Friendship Centre, or other nearby available venue, after select meetings.      Development:  Sylvan Lake has always been a town with a strong sense of community. Every day, a large part of that community travels to surrounding cities and towns to work and to shop, taking valuable economic activity, and the skills and talents of our citizens, away from Sylvan Lake. We rely heavily on Red Deer to provide the bread and butter for our children. I would love to see a more economically independent Sylvan Lake, a town where skilled citizens can work within walking distance or a short drive away from their children's schools, child care facilities, and extra curricular activities.  When citizens leave their community to work, they inevitably take their business away, as well. Every week, our citizens are supporting other economies by purchasing gasoline, groceries, gifts and fast food in other communities because it is convenient to where they work and play. When community members work in Sylvan Lake, it not only builds a stronger sense of community, a large part of our citizens spending is put directly back into the local economy.  I would bring to council ideas of strong commercial and industrial growth within Sylvan Lake, while also stressing the importance of preserving our lake for future generations. Commercial development in Sylvan Lake should be directed to more “away from shore” projects, similar to Hewlett Park Landing.    The Environment:  The environment is the most important part of our lives. Without it, we literally would have nothing, not even our own lives. I am dedicated to protecting the fragile ecosystems in our lake and surrounding wooded areas, as well as setting a positive example for our regional neighbors and the rest of the country in general. At council meetings, I would bring to the table ideas to encourage more “away from shore” development, while slowing lakeside development. I would also introduce ideas to council that would provide special incentives to home builders, development firms, and residents for building structures that operate with solar, geo-thermal, or other sources of “green” energy.  I'm dedicated to an active and “walkable” community, and would also like to see all new subdivisions and commercial developments contain “green space” and walking paths.  For years, there has been talk around town about developing the former CP Rail line into a pathway and public green space. Rather than building houses, the town should be looking at properly devloping this valuable area with playgrounds, public water fountains, benches and picnic tables.   Accessibility and Transparency:  Accountability. It's something that is becoming harder and harder to come by in all levels of government. Wasteful spending doesn't occur only on federal and provincial levels, but on a municipal level as well. This year, Sylvan Lake town councilors sent themselves on a budget retreat to Canmore, Alberta. I would never vote in favour of such spending, and would urge council to hold any meetings or retreats at one of the many venues that are available locally.  All municipal politicians should be easily accessible by the general public. The current town website contains no e-mail links to any of our elected officials. All municipal politicians should make publicly available their contact information, and be dilligent at responding to the people who elected them to power.   Safety:  In 2002, A program was launched in Sylvan Lake called “Community Works”. The youth working on this program identified several projects to enhance safety in our community. One of the projects was to “light-up” several areas in Sylvan Lake. As a councilor, I would propose to my fellow members of council that the Town of Sylvan Lake proceed with this project. A few of the areas to be lit-up include:  a) The alleyway behind Bikini's and The Big Moo b) The Pier (which would require co-operation from the Province of Alberta) The paved path that runs alongside the railway tracks, behind Pizza Hut Express. The shale pathway along the beach (would require co-operation from the Province of Alberta).  If the rest of council could be convinced to proceed with this safety-enhancing project, I would also make several suggestions that would make these lighting projects more sustainable for the future, and to set a positive “green” example for neighboring communities. These suggestions would include using solar powered lights to save on power costs and costs associated with running power cable to all of the areas to be lit.  To further enhance safety, I would propose the extension of the current chain link fence along the railway tracks for the entire length of the rail line within municipal limits, as well as propose a bylaw making it illegal to cross the tracks anywhere but at specified crossings. Additional crossings for pedestrians and cyclists may also be an option, to ensure a convenient, 'walkable' community.   Another safety enhancing step the town could take is to monitor more closely the bars downtown, and ensure they are adhering to policy in regards to fire-code and capacity. Bars that become too crowded are more often to lead to fights and other disturbances.     Parking and Traffic:  In the summer, downtown traffic causes a concern for everyone. I'm in favour of making it illegal to park recreational vehicles and trailers along Lakeshore Drive from June to October, and would rather see a separate, paid lot for such vehicles. I am also in favour of using parking meters downtown, with residents being offered to buy heavily discounted “flat rate” permits that would allow them to park anytime.  There have been traffic studies completed within recent memory, but we've seen little real improvement in the flow of traffic in Sylvan Lake. If elected to council, I would push for real changes, as recommended in the recent traffic studies.

      I'm back from the middle of nowhere, and a day early, no less! Looks like a thunderstorm knocked out our power. Figures. We had quite a lightning show at Medicine Lake but there really wasn't any power there to knock out. Yes, I went camping! Mmhmm. It was great, really, in a muggy days, chilly nights, hiking, swimming, fishing, campfire, s'mores kind of way, of course. Oh, and a note: there's always a new way to blow up water bottles in a fire.  And now, on to my MST's! I'm putting together a binder of my favourites. They're crazyamazingly funny. Yay!

      This might incur several weird looks and turned up noses, but I'm going to suggest that we all post a small (SMALL, Hannah, SMALL) survey about ourselves, since most of us don't know each other, even over the internet. Well, okay, *I* don't know most of you. So yeah. If anyone can come up with a short, humorous, to-the-point questionaire for all of us to post, please, er, do so. Yes, I'm too lazy to do it myself. I suck at writing surveys, but I happen to know that someone else on this blog has a rather nice talent for it... ::coughhannahcoughcough::

      So, hi. When I first saw this blog, I whined to Tanner that he hadn't invited me to join. Then I noticed that he had, repeatedly, but he'd been sending the invites to my old address. Then the invites didn't work. But I'm here now! Really!  And now, in the interest of saying something meaningful, I will recount once more a conversation I had this afternoon over lunch on my break from nerd camp, which and oldish friendish kind of person is also attending. Somehow we stumbled upon the subject of good and evil.  Him: So, do you think that intelligence is good, benign, or evil?  Me: (confused) I'm not really sure. I suppose I would hesitate to categorize it as any of those.  Him: Well, _______ told me she believes that intelligence is inherently good, and therefore "evil geniuses" naturally have some defect, as in they were never really intelligent at all.  Me: Interesting. (long, pensive pause) I suppose it's very difficult to decide, since it requires a very generalized and absolute statement. I certainly wouldn't call it benign, because that implies that it can do no evil, and therefore it might as well be good. But I wouldn't call it good, either. I guess I think of it as a tool, and whether it's good or evil depends on how you use it.  Him: (echoing) Depends on how you use it.  Me: (thinking to myself) I totally stole that from Spider-Man 2.  But on my way back to class, I thought about it a bit more, and the tool analogy is very fitting after all. Hammers are neither good nor evil. A hammer exists. It can be used. It has no will, no bent towards good or evil. But when someone picks up the hammer, they can use it to build a house, or to destroy or even kill. This is not the hammer's fault. The hammer did not tell the person to destroy or kill; the hammer didn't even make suggestions. There is nothing in the nature of the hammer that implies it must be used for either good or evil.  If intelligence is inherently good, it negates all the cunningness and wit of these "evil geniuses," and it's obvious that many of the most "evil" people in history have also been extremely intelligent. If it's inherently evil, shouldn't we all strive to be oblivious and vapid? (It seems as though far too many religious zealots seem to answer that question with a resounding yes, as though independent thought can somehow lead to Satanism, and blind acceptance of whatever we're told is the only thing that can save us.)  Use your hammers in whatever way you see fit, but when someone calls you evil, don't blame the hammer.

      Can you turn your back on someone else's pain? Is it harder to comfort them and share their tears, or turn away and walk in the other direction, ignoring the forgotten tears pushing against the backs of your own eyes?  I don't think there is an easy choice. If you share pain, you feel pain, and if you turn your back on it, well... I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't admit that a little piece of our humanity gets chipped away.  Most people know that the shortest verse in the bible is John 11:35, "Jesus wept." But how many of us know why Jesus wept? Many mistakenly think that he was mourning his dead friend Lazarus, but this makes very little sense since Jesus knew he could, and in fact did, raise Lazarus back to life. Jesus wept when he saw the pain of Mary, Martha, and other Jews over Lazarus' death. "He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled" (John 11:33). So was it the God in Jesus that reacted to such suffering, or was in the man? Was it Jesus' humanity that shared Mary and Martha's pain, or was it something higher, his Godliness, that allowed him to be so compassionate?  My point is, what is our natural instinct when we see something, or someone, suffering? What is the first reaction? Is it to ignore, use, or taunt? Is it to comfort, heal, and save? Which of these is the instinct, and which is the learned behavior?  What is the nature of our humanity?

       Just one more time running down this road. One more time walking in footsteps past. So here we are again. Just walking down this road.   I always end up in a rut. Always following the same path, over and over again. I suppose one could suggest that it's human nature to become accustomed to our routines, locked into them for large spans of time.  I get sick of it, of course, just as any human being becomes irritated by repetition and monotony. The question I suppose I need to ask is how I always end up like this in the end.  It's nice to break the cycle every so often, but it's easier to just accept it. It's always easier to do nothing than it is to even consider doing something. It's always best to take the path of least resistance.  I just need a break. But I'll get to it later.  When I feel like it.

       "It is human nature to want to exchange ideas, and I believe that, at bottom, every artist wants no more than to tell the world what he has to say.      "The primary purpose of all art forms, whether music, literature, or the visual arts, is to say something to the outside world - in other words, to make a personal thought, a striking idea, an inner emotion perceptible to other people's senses in such a way so that there is no doubt as to the artist's intentions."     -The immortal words of MC Escher.  Chew on that.

         Alden Nowlan      A Note on the Public Transportaion Sysytem     It's not hard to begin a conversation with the person who happens to be seated nearest you, especially when she’s been reading with apparent interest a book that's one of your favourites and can’t find her matches.           The difficulty is once you've spoken you can never go back to being comfortable with silence,              even if you learn you've nothing to say and would rather not listen.           You can stop talking but you can't forget the broken wires dangling there between you.           You’ll smile almost guiltily when your glances accidentally bump.           It may get so bad that one of you will have to pretend to fall asleep.      This poem has been one of my favourites since I was roughly 16. At first, I took it at face value, picturing in my head, two people seated on a bus, engaged in polite chit chat. Within a matter of minutes, they both run out of things to say. What do you do in that situation? If you simply stop talking, the silence becomes increasinly awkward, until one you has to "fall asleep".  After being assigned to present an analysis of the poem to the class, I realized there was a broader meaning behind it. It explains, in a subtle way, a very real phenomenon in our society. No longer are we born, raised, and buried in a small community, only interacting with maybe two hundred people in our entire lifetimes. In the modern world, our social circle is constantly changing and evolving. Every so often, we run into "someone we used to know". We all know what happens, your eyes meet, and for a second, you assume that you can pretend you haven't been absent from each others lives. As soon as the conversation starts, however, you're thrown into an awkward, forced swirl of "So, how have you been?", "How's your brother", and "Have you talked to Sandi, lately". Finally, one of you can't take it anymore, and cuts themselves loose. "Well, I really should be going", even though you know you've got three hours to kill before Footloose comes on TV.  So what is it, that causes us to be so close with someone that you could never imagine your life without them, and then within a matter of months, being reduced to a mere set of dangling telephone wires? It's happened to almost all of us.

      So. In a last ditch attempt to save this site, which has been a very important part of my life for the past 2 years, I'm turning it semi-public. Handing over the reigns to my friends. A place for use to come together, share the "human experience".  That sounds very new age and hippyish. I apologize.   in pursuit of something more. i'm inviting you to write with me.     From the movie "Waking Life":  Hey.......could we do that again? I know we haven't met, but, I don't wanna be an ant, ya know? I mean, it's like we go through life with our antennas bouncing off one another continuously on "ant" autopilot with nothing really human required of us. "Stop," "Go," "Walk here," "Drive there." All action basically for survival. All communication simply to keep this ant colony buzzing along in an efficient, polite manner. "Here's your change," "Paper or plastic?", "Credit or debit?", "Do you want ketchup with that?" I don't want a straw. I want real human moments. I want to see you. I want you to see me. I don't want to give that up. I don't want to be an ant. Ya know?
