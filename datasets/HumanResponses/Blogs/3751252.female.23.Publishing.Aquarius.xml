       Charlotte woke in the early hours of Friday morning, to hear someone shouting below her window. “Help! Please, help me!” She paused briefly to wonder at the power of the subconscious (had she already been dreaming of a dramatic mountain rescue previous to hearing the cries?) before rolling out of bed and walking over to the window.  Having unlatched and heaved the window open, she looked down to the street below. Peter was standing there, his hair and clothes somewhat creased as if he had been sleeping rough for a week, gazing up at her. “I’ve been calling you for almost 20 minutes” he said accusingly. “What do you want?” she asked, justifiably enough. It was still dark outside. “I want you to help me,” he sounded drunk “I’m madly in love, and it’s tearing me apart!” “With whom?” She asked kindly; despite her rude awakening, she was a compassionate enough person to see that Peter was truly distressed and would benefit from a little of her time. “Oh, it’s useless anyway, forget it, forget it.” Peter’s body seemed to crumple beneath him, as he flopped to the pavement. Charlotte was more than a little shocked; the transition from human being to pile of dirty laundry was alarming. “No, no, no, what’s the point, stupid, stupid.” He began to rock haphazardly on the ground, apparently unaware that his right foot was sticking rigidly out, ruining the illusion of genuine human abandonment.  “Enough!” Charlotte was firm, “Either you tell me the whole story, or I’m going back to bed right now. I’ve got earplugs!” Compassion was one thing, but patience was hard to muster when confronted with such a pathetic spectacle. Peter quickly got up and stood looking up at her, as if waiting for more instructions.  The old fashioned street lamp he stood below did nothing to aid his dignity; his skinny frame could not pull off such an excuse for a suit, and he reminded Charlotte of a homeless Charlie Chaplin caricature she had once met at a party.  Neither of them spoke; to Charlotte the silence was somewhat painful, but she bore it bravely because she refused to give in to his childishness, and besides she didn’t really have any earplugs.  “I’m in love.” He said it so simply, not as if it were the most marvellous thing in the world, nor as if it was the most horrid. He said it in a tone and manner that suggested he were talking about something else, his star sign perhaps. “With you.” It took Charlotte just a few moments to gain composure, before she closed the window and phoned the police.

       Mary Ellen Mark At Manchester Art Gallery  There is something different about Manchester these days. Upmarket shops have eagerly migrated north to find sanctuary in a city whose 439,000 and rising population is, possibly, only outnumbered by the abundance of luxury apartment blocks and trendy restaurants. Since the IRA bomb 8 years ago, Manchester has experienced a complete overhaul and, egged on by the 2002 Commonwealth Games, can now barely conceal its smugness, as affluence and fashion take the city for their own. The changing image of Manchester has forced the world to redefine its impressions of a place formally associated with industry, crime and gritty rock acts. Manchester is now a shopping Mecca, a desirable place to buy a property, and a cultural hub that is ready and waiting to take on rival artistic cities, such as Liverpool and London. Having secured national and international attention as a prototype of successful regeneration, Manchester is now reaping the rewards of its efforts, as the arts scene bears particular witness.   On first moving to Manchester, 4 years ago, I was somewhat dismayed at the apparent lack of a integral art scene; while contemporary and underground art flourished, the absence of a large, regional gallery was noted and oft regretted.  Therefore, upon hearing the news that the renovated Manchester Art Gallery was to re-open in May 2002, I felt a sense of urgent anticipation; how might this new and improved art space advance the cultural identity of the city? Would its collection of Victorian paintings bore us all to death, or would it manage to solicit exhibitions and artists away from London, and do justice to Manchester’s new reputation? Two years on, Manchester Art Gallery is blooming; late last year it accommodated the acclaimed exhibition Turner: The Late Seascapes, and this autumn it will be the only other UK destination for the Barbican retrospective of Helen Chadwick. But the summer blockbuster, the show that will put the spotlight on the gallery and Manchester alike, is undoubtedly the international tour of American Odyssey: Mary Ellen Mark from 26th June to 5th September, of which Manchester is the only UK venue. Recently voted the most influential woman photographer of all time, by readers of American Photo, Mark’s black and white photographs document the last four decades of American life and history. At a time when America mainly graces headlines in conjunction with the bitter war against terrorism, Manchester Art Gallery curator, Natasha Howes, hopes the exhibition will challenge preconceptions and present ‘a complex portrait of a country and its people’.   Part of Mark’s skill as a social documentary photographer, lies in her ability to connect deeply with her subjects, by immersing herself in their lives. Her images present deeply personal yet unsentimental insights into those that live on the outskirts of society.  Tackling sensitive issues such as homelessness and the Klu Klux Klan, alongside humorous extracts of the ‘wacky’ American way, Mark offers the overlooked a visual voice and, in doing so, captures the essence of humanity. Despite the images charged contents, Mark does not funnel the viewer into a particular emotional response; ‘What’s interesting is letting people tell you about themselves in the picture’ she has stated, identifying herself as merely a ‘voyeur’. This is particularly apparent in her series ‘Twins’, a two year project documenting identical siblings at the annual ‘Twins Days’ festival in Twinsburg, Ohio. The images are neutral, and Mark has avoided using her influence as a photographer to make comment on the sitters lack of identity. Mark does not consider herself to be an art photographer (‘I am a documentary photographer’) and is therefore liberated from the incentive to incorporate messages and meaning into her work; she simply uses her technical skill and eye for composition to illustrate what she terms the ‘universal subject’.     American Odyssey is the first ever major exhibition of Mark’s work in the UK, and offers the only opportunity for those throughout Britain to see her work. Such exclusivity reflects favourably on Manchester Art Gallery, and suggests the £35 million overhaul was well worth it. The building itself echoes the regeneration of the city; two of the three parts were originally designed by the architect Charles Berry, who is most famous for the Houses of Parliament. These once separate buildings, built in the 1800’s, served respectively as the Manchester Institute for the Promotion of Literature, Science and Art, and the Athenaeum, which for many years was the centre of Manchester cultural life. Now seamlessly connected to each other and to the blissfully light new building, designed by Michael Hopkins Associates, Manchester Art Gallery has become whole, and reclaimed its rightful place at the crux of the cultural experience. Such revival points to Manchester City Council’s Arts and Culture Regeneration scheme, which has invested £395 million in the cities cultural infrastructure since 1995. There is a now nation-wide recognition of Manchester’s cultural assets, and the Council is working hard to elevate Manchester’s national and international reputation as a cosmopolitan and innovative city, with a distinct heritage and a diverse accumulation of cultural attractions. Despite losing out to Liverpool as European Capital of Culture 2008, Manchester is striding forward, proudly proclaiming her rightful place as the regional leader of cultural vision and influence.   And while the city and its art gallery have much to gain by hosting the internationally important American Odyssey, the public that come to see Mark’s work, have much to learn.  Along side personal projects documenting the unseen side of America, Mark has also worked as a photographer on several Hollywood films, and taken portraits of a number of celebrities. There is a paradox in her portfolio, for while the majority of her work is far removed from the mainstream, she has not shunned the glamour of Americas biggest industry. She justifies her dual interests through the quality of her work; celebrity photographs suit her style of portraiture and reportage. More so, her work with Milos Forman on One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, inspired an interest in institutions for the mentally ill, and led her to pursue her most demanding and personally rewarding project, Ward 81, portraits of the inhabitants of an Oregon hospital for mentally ill women. She depicts a country of mixed backgrounds and situation, something the Manchester public can emphasis with. As infamous for its neglected areas as much as its residents that drip with wealth, Manchester is home to a population of mixed ethnic background, economic circumstance and mental outlook. Mark’s photographs prove that there is a common thread in all humanity, and it is impossible not to connect as deeply with her subjects as she obviously has.    American Odyssey is testament to Manchester’s flourishing art scene and gradual emergence as a city worthy of national and international cultural reputation. Manchester has recovered from a century of underestimation, and is slowly climbing the ladder of cultural standing by hosting a exhibition that examines the underdogs of society and shows their common humanity. If major shows such as American Oddessey continue to grace the formerly gritty, industrial city, then Manchester will reap the rewards of its urban investment, and reach dazzling new levels of notoriety.

         Helen Chadwick: A Retrospective   18th September – 21st November 2004 at Manchester City Art Gallery  Helen Chadwick (1953-1996) is best known one of the first women to be nominated for the Turner Prize (in 1988), and as the founder of contemporary British art. Her first major retrospective offers a survey of work from her twenty-year career, and delights in all the controversial and provocative dimensions of her art. Chadwick pioneered photography, sculpture and ‘alternative’ materials to create highly personal works that confront traditional aesthetic expectations. Her most famous sculpture, Piss Flowers (1991-1992) is a collection of casts resembling human genitalia, made from the cavities left after Chadwick and her boyfriend urinated over snow. However, the central penile form is the result of Chadwick crouching in the snow, whereas it is the man’s urine that has created the labial shape surrounding it. Piss Flowers disrupts the viewer’s notions of body and gender, and highlights the pleasure and beauty of the taboo.    Helen Chadwick: A Retrospective is on tour from the Barbican Art Gallery, and will complement Manchester City Art Gallery’s beautiful new space for temporary exhibitions. The exhibition hopes to reacquaint viewers with Chadwick as one of the most influential British Artists of the 1980’s and 1980’s, who described her work as ‘gorgeously repulsive, exquisitely fun, dangerously beautiful’.

       A Manchester Tradition  Venue: The Gallery, Manchester Art House, Manchester City Centre  Dates: Until 22nd December 2002  Rating: * *  *  The Gallery Art House offers its visitors the chance to view contemporary, popular and renowned pieces of art in a public exhibition space without having to leave a comforting, commercial environment. While artists might prefer to claim indifference to the modern worlds money orientated ways, it is inevitable that the production of art depends on its consumption by those who can afford it, and The Gallery makes no apologies for such a state of affairs.   ‘A Manchester Tradition’ is to be the last exhibition held in this essentially retail space and comprises of work from many local artists, including Bolton born and bred Roger Hampson, Salford’s own Harold Riley and not forgetting the predictable inclusion of L.S Lowry. The exhibition aims to explore the roots of Manchester through focus on the representation of its buildings, inhabitants and favourite pastime - football. Such a collection at first seems to promise little inspiration, but among the rather drab and depressing offerings are several pleasant surprises. T. Major’s ‘Industrial Scene’ depicts a smoky view of the cities prominent industrial buildings with a lonely figure standing listless in the foreground. In contrast Helens Bradley’s ‘It Was A Beautiful Place’ depicts 19th Century upper class leisure pursuits, with industry removed to a mere speak on the horizon, a very distant world. Together these unconnected paintings speak both sides of Manchester’s history.    The exhibition is let down by the lack of information provided on both the artists and their work. Industry is obviously a reoccurring theme, but there is little sense of any cultural history that might explain local artists lack of escapism. The Gallery replaces useful titbits with oversized price tags, perhaps a sign of their descent into the pure retail side of art? Rather than completely repelling the viewer, this merely reflects the images of Manchester’s decaying industry; although the end is nigh for The Gallery’s days as a public exhibition space there is still a chance to grab a glimpse several important art works in this final exhibition.

       He wanted to know her as soon as he saw her because, unlike his previous girlfriends, she was unafraid of spiders. This may not have been immediately apparent, but it was nevertheless shortly obvious. She stood on the pavement outside his front garden, leaning curiously close to the unidentifiable bushes that boarded the property. He watched from his deckchair, as over and over she swept her left hand over and away from her right arm, stared intently into mid-air, then diligently switched her attention back to the faint, black spot on her right arm. He moved a little closer to the bushes, pleased that she seemed oblivious to his rightful presence in the garden. Closer inspection confirmed that what had originally masqueraded as a mole, was indeed a spider, of moderate proportion, tapping its legs contentedly upon the skin of her forearm. He could tell she had no fear, disgust or impatience with its presence, but continually offered it her left forefinger as a lifeline, an escape route. He liked her good manners; the spider was a trespasser, but this was pardonable, and he felt that any projection of guilt would be petty, not to mention pointless.    “Come on,” (was she aware that she spoke out loud?), “come on, come on, come on, little one, you’d be much happier on this bush, it is a far more habitual home for you… come on, piss off, you can’t stay on me forever, neither of us should like that!”   He contemplated what he should say to her; he wanted her to notice his proximity and bestow her attention on him, rather than the spider (though he hoped that she would welcome his advances, and be rather less keen to part company). Should he tell a little white lie, and inform her that her little squatter was a money spider and would bring her luck? Or perhaps suggest that they call it Charlotte (he liked this idea, as it not only alerted her to his sensitivity towards children’s literature, but also included him in what was really her dilemma)? Should he be honest and openly admire her untraditional comfort with creepy crawlies, or even confess his own amateurish fascination with the inspect world? There seemed so many options, so many possibilities for introduction, that he feared that the wrong choice could spell his dismissal – oh to be rejected like a spider! He chewed his lip, silently signed and opened his parched mouth to speak… But oh, too late, too late. Having grown bored of the spider’s stubborn refusal to vacate her body, she cried accusingly, “Oh, don’t you know I have somewhere to be?” and brought her left palm down with a slap onto her forearm and, hence, assured the spiders demise. Her cheeks flushed ambiguously before she flicked the remains into the bushes and carried on her way.  He watched her go in awe, his prefect woman. Grinning inanely, he realised that she did exist, his Eve, his Juliet, no, his Hera. Was it possible, could it be, that there existed a creature, easy on the eye and ear, who not only had no fear of spiders, but also shared his own simple, if not morbid, pleasure in the act of slaying, assassinating, massacring eight legged friends?

       The Drifters 50th Anniversary Tour 6th August 2004 – Theatre Royal, Brighton 19.45pm   It is never easy to predict how a certain style, that is both time and site specific, will translate for a modern-day audience on the other side of the Atlantic. But rest assured that during the opening night of their 50th anniversary tour, The Drifters recreated the mood of the doo wop days of the 1950’s in an entertaining concert that proved to be an unanimous crowd-pleaser.     Formed in 1953, The Drifters epitomised the R&B and gospel sound of New York City, and readily went on to become the longest running band in pop history. Over the years the line-up has changed, but their astounding collection of romantic and catchy tunes have not lost any appeal and remain dance floor favourites. Sporting lead singers such as Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis and Johnny Moore, the group is responsible for wedding reception classics such as Under the Boardwalk and Up on the Roof.   Accredited as the original boy band, The Drifters continue to attract their fair share of loyal fans; the Theatre Royal concert witnessed two long-standing ‘groupies’ complete with chocolate love tokens. Throughout the show the four singers encouraged clapping and jiving from the audience, and they were rewarded with whooping cheers, from their female fans at least. Dressed to impress in matching suits, the present day line-up flirted, bantered and strutted their stuff, while demonstrating an impressive collective vocal range. Indeed, it is only superb individual voices and a penchant for harmonising that excuse The Drifters and their smooth talking, pelvis thrusting ways.   Despite the concert’s success, the Theatre Royal’s lack of dance floor rather inhibited the opportunity for a serious boogie. The band did not fare much better; the stage was overcrowded, and the plain backdrop, unimaginative lighting and scruffy stage floor did little to compliment the animated singers and their toe tapping tunes.   While the audience relished the nostalgic performance, there was at times a sense of watching a tribute band, rather than the ‘real’ Drifters. The singers confronted this directly, pointing out that they are the direct descendants and protégés of the initial line-up. This seemed to satisfy any concerns the audience might have harboured, although from the lack of empty seats, it was obvious that it didn’t really matter. New members or no, The Drifters have still got some of the best tunes, which they perform with flawless talent and credible doo wop style.
