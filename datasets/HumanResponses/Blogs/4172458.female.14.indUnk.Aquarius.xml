      Wow, I created a blog! Don't I feel special?  Well, no actually...  I feel the same as I did ten minutes ago. No one is going to care about a teenager's petty problems, so lets face it. Who exactly am I writing this to?  Two or three faceless, nameless people who will just happen to stumble across my life.  They will read a few lines, realise there is nothing of interest here, and will move on, never to return.  But anyway, on with the Blogging.   I had a dream last night. [ gasp! omg, a DREAM!!!]  Wind, rain, thunder, cold, dark, the memory of a horse and it's previous owner you would rather forget. All the components for the perfect dream. Pia is an aggressive horse who cares for no one, myself inculded. But I can say modestly that I am the only person who she ever trusted, and almost showed feelings for. Eli was her owner. I don't knwo if she really was her owner, or wether she had been stolen, or something of the sort, Knowing Eli this was very possible. Eli was also the owner of the riding school, and the one who had taught me to ride. Surprising, seeing as she probably has never sat on a horse herself. Anyway, there was a bunch of lies, misteries, cheating on girlfriends, and the riding school shut down, taking Pia, now sold to another owner, with it. So. On with the dream.  I was walking, no, running alone down a lane, on a dark and stormy night ( I know, what a cliché ). Turning around, I see Eli, or maybe it was her girlfriend, Txell riding in a hrose cart, coming towards me. Pulling the cart was  none other than Pia, the bitchy mare who handed out bites and kicks, for free!  You have to understand Pia and me had a special kind of bond. And Eli broke it. A year later Pia came back into my life, and we bonded again. Trust Eli, to ruin it again. Anyway, back to the dream. Eli seemed to think I had forgiven her, or something along those lines, she talked to me like nothing had ever happenned. Pia reared, and Eli smacked her across the face with a whip, and shouted at her to stay still.  She got out of her carriage, and held Pia. thunder clapped overhead ( cliché alert ) Pia, scared and rolling her eyes as horses tend to do when petrified or just plain angry, tried to spin around but Eli forcefully held her still, hitting her all the time. I obviously love Pia vey much, and told Eli to sell her to me. Eli said no. I said "Eli, I am buying her."  Then, I woke up. I have never seen Pia so worked up as in that dream, it was scary almost to see her like that. I have been thinking about Pia a lot lately. I also dreamt my parents  bought her for me on my birthday. But I have long given up hope for that.
