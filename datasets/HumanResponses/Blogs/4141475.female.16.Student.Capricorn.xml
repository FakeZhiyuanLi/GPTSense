       Ok I know the whole sayings and things was a very bad title idea. OK so it was very very stupid, but hey... It popped in to my head, and I wrote it down. That is how I am MOST of the time. Anyway just saying that most of the stuff on this page is just pretty much just what ever randomness comes out of my mouth, or what I hear, or worse... What I think!  ~L8R

         When something goes wrong, I look into your eyes, And everything turns out alright.  When I am depressed, I look into your eyes, And I am filled with happiness.  When I am in pain, I look into your eyes, And all of my pain disappears.  When I cower in fear, I look into your eyes, And my fear goes away.  When I feel that I might loose you, I look into your eyes, And I know that I can trust you.  When I am worried, I look into your eyes, And I know that everything will be ok.

           It hurts me to breath, When I see what has been.  People's minds being tromented, Their bodies being devoured.  No where to run, No where to hide.  Running around looking for something, Something that just can't be found.  I look around, I see the pain.  There is a place to run, A place to hide.  This is a place I just can't seem to find!

       Like cold, crying clouds, Pouring through the sky, Sinking to the ground.  Like a silver dragon, Flying through the air, Landing in a cave.  Like a glowing light, Flickering in a lamp, Suddenly extinguished.  Like a star being born, Than a fast explosion, And it dies.  Like getting a wild buzz, Hiding in the clouds, Dreaming a luring dream.  Like rain splashing in puddles, slithering in anger, Stealing a metal-iron obsession.  Like everything that begins, Something has got to end.

       When I look at the world around me, I see people laughing in amusement, But I cry in vein.  When i look at the world around me, I see people people's enjoyment, But i am in agony.  When i look at the world around me, I see forgiveness, but i feel revenge.  When i look at the world around me, I see happyness, But I feel sadness.  When i look at the world around me, I see what I want, But it doesn't want me.

       Hiding in dark allies, A place to run and hide, There is nothing to fear when all alone.  Running from my fear, Hiding in the darkness, I am getting away from all that I fear.  Darkness hides me when I am alone, No one can hurt me, I am hidden from the world.  There is nothing to fear anymore.

       Sorry, I couldn't find anything else to talk about. I haven't really done anything sense the whole 'Some coffee and talk' thing with Mark. But anyway... yeah...   >>>>>  This morning I woke up at about 7:00 AM realizing that I got 5 hours of sleep!  (I don't usually get any at all!)  I had to get up and clean up the backyard so that my dad could cut it before some people came over. Then I went in my room and meditated for about 45 minutes. Then at 8:00 I went into the kitchen, and got a glass of water then went and laid down in front of the TV. At about 8:45 I went and took a shower, and got all my shit and stuff ready to go. And at about 9:35 I ended up at Revan's house.   >>>>>  After arguing in the driveway with my dad about not wanting to come home till late, I went and climbed in the back of Revan's truck and we sat talking for a while. After his "ex step-dad" came home with what-a-burger, I ate some of Revan's fries with him in the back of his truck. Then after a while we went in to the house to put my shit in his room, and just sat in there talking and listening to music.   >>>>>  I went and changed my clothes, after we look ed at some pictures that he wanted to see, and he put my make-up on me (He is very good at that!).  I put my cape, and my boots on. !It was great I was all Gothic( My parents are 'hard core Christian Nazis' so I hardly get to unless they are not going to be home at all)!  His mom then told us to keep an eye on the yard sale, so we just laid on the couches that were out there for sale while people were coming and going. After that we went back in to the house and told his mom that it was their turn to watch everything   >>>>>  We went up to Revan's Room and turned on some Dark Opera. We listened to it while he did something on his computer and I meditated. We did that for like an hour or so. Then we were running around the house tackling each other, and messing around. He bit me and the whole left side of my neck is numb and tingle. After that we went down to the Kitchen, and got some grapes, and went out side to eat them for a while. Then we went up to his room yet again and hung out some more.   >>>>>  His mom and dad then had to go box hunting for boxes to pick up later. Then we went around picking up all of the signs that had yard sale shit on them. Then Revan, his mom, "ex step-dad", and I went out for Ice-Cream at Baskin-Robins  urlLink   , I got watermelon Ice like Revan. After that we went back to the house to hangout some more.   >>>>>  We were hanging around in his room for the rest of the time. Listening to music, and talking, and then we just decided to rest for a bit so we both laid on the floor for a bit.   OMFG... I got all pissed off because now I only get to see him on the weekends, because he starts school on Tuesday, and we both go to two different schools. I made me feel like summer was coming to an end, even though during the summer I get all depressed.   He was trying to comfort me, and I was just being dumb, because of this new thing I'm doing (medical reasons),  I easily get all emotional. Anyway...   >>>>>  After that we got a call from my dad, and so instead of him picking me up, Revan's parents gave me a ride home as they went around getting boxes so that they can finish moving.  SO... Yeah that was pretty much all that we did to day! It was really fun. Especially sense I haven't wanted to talk or hangout with anyone lately.   DEPRESSION SUCKS ASS!       ~L8R
