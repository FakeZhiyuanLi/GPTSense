      For half a decade now, the Bernat yarn company has been selling fine yarns over the internet, and they have likely been in business much longer than that.  That's why I don't mind that  urlLink bernat.com  takes you to everything I could ever imagine wanting to know about yarn, knits, and crochets.  I'm less enthusiastic about  urlLink davidbernat.com , current search engine wrapper and "future home of a Doster registered domain."  So perturbed am I that I hereby retract my endorsement of the davidbernat.com domain and all its practices.  That is, until I register it as my own (which is why I was poking around in the first place).  And this leads to "great revelation and idea #16": Everyday people will soon start registering domain names. So register them first.  It's already pretty common for speculators to gobble up probable domain names for up and coming politicans, sports stars, actors, and anyone else who might become famous and interesting.  It's a great idea, but play the percentages instead of instead of buying lottery tickets.  Scroll through a database of possible first name/last name combinations, google the name and if enough hits are returned purchase the website.  If you set the hits threshold high enough (maybe ~70?) chances are good that someone will want that site.  On the other hand, I'm quite unhappy to find davidbernat.com purchased and readied for development by another David Bernat.  It was probably that  urlLink Seattle Mariner pitcher  with the rocket arm.  Or maybe it was the  urlLink Weslleyian Theologian .  Or the Chicago banker....it could be  urlLink him .  That's not cool.  What to do now?

      Having given up on Dell DJs and finding that work without music is no fun at all, I've started listening to  urlLink Yahoo's Launchcast  again.  It's a free, online radio service that attempts to determine that uses listener preferences to predict future song selections.    For my first twenty hours the service was pretty fantastic and I heard nothing but the hits from all my favorite bands.  But then the algorithm, well, she started to show.  Understandably trying to reach the widest audience, Launchast gives strong preference to singles over album tracks and will tend to play more currently marketable artists.  In theory that's wonderful; the intersection of playability, preference, and the present.  A week around the release of  urlLink Springsteen's Essential  collection and Warren Zevon's last album was particularly rocking.  I heard "Disorder In The House" (playing at the moment, coincidentally) two dozen times that week.  "Rosalita" should be stamped on a gold disc and shot out into the cosmos.  My satisfaction dissolved quickly thereafter.  After hearing every Springsteen and Dylan re-released single, 'the algorithm' started thinking for herself.  It virtually ruined Aerosmith's anthemic Dream On by playing it every two hours.  It was a nightmare.  I started piling on more and more preferences to give the algorithm something else to bite.  Despite adding a dozen classic rock artists, I heard Allman Brothers Allthe time: turned out they had another greatest hits collection coming out.   Having been saturated with classic rock enough to keep me turned off until it starts spinning on the Oldies stations, I rated a collection of current artists hoping to hear some new pop rock.  What I got was twenty four hours a day of Shakira.  While Whenever, Wherever and Ojos Asi are quite enjoyable, it was all too much for me to handle.  Having lost control to the algorithm, I stopped listening.  But now I'm back.  Day Zero, Song Three.  "Disorder In The House".  Cool.  Michael Jackson's playing now.  What caught my attention today was one of the promotional ads for the premium Launchcast pay service.  "Ever hear a song that you wish you could skip but you've already used up all your skips?"  Oh yes, especially when you think I'd like to hear Limp Bizkit's blasphemous cover of Behind Blue Eyes.  Apparently the premium service gives you unlimited skips (the free service girls 5 every hours I believe). The thing is, if I'm skipping that many songs then either my music preferences suck or your service is skewed away from what I want to hear.  Clearly one of us doesn't know what he's doing...so that means I should pay money?  But hey, she's giving me Neil Diamond's "Heart Of Gold", and until something better comes along, she'll do just fine...

      Relevant to Moore (as disgusting a proposition as it is)..  Some people protest for a better world, but some people protest for entirely different reasons.  I leave you with a verse from The Beatles' " urlLink The Ballad of John and Yoko ."   Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, Talking in our beds for a week. The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?" I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace."   Aren't we all?

      Finally, a topic to write about. I've been wanting to post to my blog for a week now, but I haven't had anything to say that wouldn't cascade away into an uninteresting, overly-personal rant.  Last week, I signed up to lead a Goldman Sachs Community Team Works project.  I will be leading a group to help a larger group build Goldman Sachs Habitat for Humanity low-income housing. Now, look, I understand the importance of volunteering.  My father used to drag my ass outside to pick up trash along the neighborhood playground because the city wouldn't pay to have it done.  And needless to say that I would love to get out of the office and  sacrifice a day to help those less fortunate, but really, shouldn't I just write a check?  Writing from the Capitalist Center of the World, let's be honest.  Considering that 20% of the Goldman Sachs employee body carries the title "Vice President," it's not outrageous to estimate that the median salary for a GS employee hits somewhere around a thousand bucks a day.  My father helps manage a carpenter and contractor business.  He doesn't build houses, he mostly refinishes basements, but it means that I know what your average for-hire spackler makes.  And it's a hell of a lot less than a thousand bucks a day.  In fact, I wager that you could hire 10 very happy for-hire carpenter laborors for what it costs a mid-upper level Goldman Sachs employee to miss work.  That doesn't make good business sense.  Of course, it makes for a great photo-opportunity.  After all, Goldman Sachs makes sure that each of the houses its employees work on are only worked on by Goldman Sachs employees, thus allowing the company to hold the good-will rights to the house.  Collective effort?  Hell no, this house was built with Goldman Sachs' blood, sweat, and tears, at 10 times the cost, for the less fortunate.

      It's been about thirty minutes since my last point.  Of course, I checked CNN again.  Right on cue, CNN has updated their picture of a random Reagan mourner.  Of course, perhaps to prove me rediculous, this time it's not a semi-attractive twentysomething white girl.   It's a middle aged American Indian in full headress and wardrobe... ...didn't see that one coming.

      The long stretchs of boredom at work are ripe opportunities for thought.  It's frustrating that, with the constant monitoring by co-workers, company compliance, and the dedication centers of my brain leave me unable to nurture the seeds of those thoughts. I'm fed up being an 18-24 year old white male.  Yes, I know I that we, collectively, are the largest gear in the commercial machine.  And Yes, I know that our wallets are loosened at the very site of an attractive woman.  But must the every new piece of clothing, every nightclub, every pill, website, soft drink, sports event and computer game be introduced to me by a stunningly beautiful yet seemingly obtainable 18-24 year old woman?  Must I be forced to differenciate, yet not contrast, every item's usefulness with its alluded sexual fulfillment? I studied as a physicist with the goal of simplifying the universe.  Boil everything down to a few equations that represent the whole chaotic mess.  It's a search for clarity.  It's understandable that advertisements, that serve only to confuse and disorient, would rub me the wrong way. Now, this is all a matter of opinion, of course.  Some out there will gladly spout off economic principles that not only validate the need for advertisements, but can claim that it contributes to a greater good, a better world, and a maximized ultility.  I'm a fan of market forces as much as the next guy (assuming he's not a whack Libertarian or Communist*) but I don't see how showing me a picture of a beautiful woman (airburshed to arousal) so that I buy your car insurance is going to contribute to a better world.  And don't give me a "product awareness" speel that it would stimulate the economy, leading to a more efficient market, and better product availablilities.  My male mind stopped thinking about car insurance six seconds into your 30-second spot. Why do I care at this particular moment?  Because I'm bored at work, and habitually checking CNN like some sort of socio-political-gloabl-economic-hypocondriac secretly hoping there's something wrong in the world that will amuse me for a few minutes.  How's that for a fucked up mentality, and the cable news channels know I'm not alone.  But, that's fine, after all, global goodwill only goes so far before self-preservation takes over and I've started asking for the sacrific of innocents to keep me from being bored to death.  What really bothered me after after my continual CNN viewing was the constant coverage of Ronald Reagan's funeral, god bless his soul. I'm sorry to see him pass as he was the first president sworn in on my watch.  At the time, to my young mind, he was an archtype of The President: he helped win the cold war, saved the world, he was a strong willed leader and a great speaker.  Sure, turns out he was a hell of a lot more conservative than I'd ever vote for, but that doesn't matter.  I'm sad to see him pass.   Perhaps it's the near saturation of sexuality on the internet, but I'm struck (sadly, not stroked) by the parade of somewhat attractive, twentysomething women that CNN show mourning Reagan's passing.  Every thirty minutes it seems like it's another one.  Am I seeing things?  Apparently no men, no elderly, no parents, no uglies, no non-caucasions are mourning for him.  Now, I don't know his politics very well, so perhaps the elderly or non-caucasions AREN'T mourning for him.  Maybe I'm being come on to, and CNN wants my patronage.   Sigh.  Yeah, Market Forces.  Ronald Reagan's legacy will live on.   * That is to say that my opinions on market forces have not hardened and I could still be considered a wishy-washy moderate.  I've heard that last phrase used as an insult at times, but I'm unsure how any person with four years of casual economic observation can claim to have any opinions of merit, to be capable of saying much worth its salt.  The fringe doctrines are generally marginally easier to side with or against, although ironically because of their extreme nature it's more difficult to prove their validity.  Who knows, maybe we'd all be better if the fire or police departments were subsidaries of GE.  I doubt it, and frankly I never want to find out.  Oh, and why the hell can we contract a war out to private companies?  Either the DoD has been asleep for the last 10 years or someone's planning a coup.

      As Goldman Sachs is currently smack in the middle of Employee Evaluation Season, I thought it'd be interesting to see how Goldman Sachs has been reviewed.  While searching for a quote in which the GS CEO Hank Paulson flat out devalues the worth of most of his employees, I came across the  urlLink Vault  and its Zagat like  urlLink review  of Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; In the interest of full disclosure, I used the following search: "Goldman Sachs Paulson quotes"  I've been quite miserable at my job and I find the culture completely unbearable.&nbsp; People live for their jobs, and they live for the power and money that comes with future success.&nbsp; Friends are few and acquantance is another work for networking prospect.&nbsp; Meet-and-Greets are not like college Freshman informals.&nbsp; They are professional business events.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even smaller, divisional events, for instance, to introduce new summer interns to their temporary co-workers.&nbsp; The future stands in the room, and its best to get&nbsp;your hands on it now.  Personally, I believe that Goldman overhires for their positions, supressing curiousity with money, and breeding an employee base&nbsp;ready to strike you down for your power and only as loyal as their next bonus.  I work as a foreign exchange strategist.&nbsp; It's a mathematical-finance programming job that pays far too much for a programming job of this level.&nbsp; Since the day I joined, the head of my group has been working on assassinating his boss.&nbsp; He has decimated the core of the FX Strategist group by moving all the best employees to other neighboring groups, thus planting roots in the battlegrounds of his boss.&nbsp; Both men are born power brokers.&nbsp; The FX Strategist group is in constant transition, lead by a proxy-manager.&nbsp; He is very intelligent, with a deepening understanding of mathematical finance.&nbsp; He is, however, an intellectual at heart.&nbsp; He is not a manager.&nbsp; The strategist group has been coasting on its previous success since the break-up began.  The CEOs do what they do well.&nbsp; They are in the business of making money by buying and selling money.&nbsp; Corporations like Goldman Sachs are a necessary evil of capitalism.&nbsp; They provide efficient methods for the world to move.&nbsp; But watch them.&nbsp; Watch them like a hawk.&nbsp; They want something from you, or they don't want you at all.  Let's here what other employees have said. Goldman Sachs is a phenominal corporation and many, many people could thrive there.&nbsp; I can't fall asleep at night because I don't want to go through it again tomorrow.  -------------------------------------------------------  Healthy pride or hubris? Goldman Sachs' workplace is legendary for its "intense, hard-working and competitive" ethic where "success is taken for granted." One insider says Goldman "really has the most hardworking, and probably the smartest people, on Wall Street." While the rest of the world may exalt Goldman employees as "arrogant" and "snobby," insiders note the firm "cuts their egos down to size," making it clear from the start that "individual personalities are insignificant" and "the firm comes first, second and last." A Goldman source explains, "Employees really get taken care of and are treated with the utmost respect. But when times are tough, it's every man for himself." The contact adds, "They will smile at you, and then stab you in the back." Another Goldman source has a more positive view of the inside. "Goldman tries to take care of its people. Even when the firm is downsizing, HR is eager to find you a position within the firm. There are lots of nice people to work with."  One employee says the Goldman culture is "strong and well defined, emphasizing clients, reputation and employees - in that order." Another insider likens the firm to "the god we are all meant to bow to." Says one source, "I've seen some people from top schools who came across as a bit arrogant, and they were very unwelcome [at Goldman]." One vice president remarks that Goldman employees certainly "take pride in the company's reputation, in preserving the brand." But some insiders say Goldman employees might take a little too much pride in the brand. Some have an "unjustifiable pompous pride about being employed here," offers one source. Concerning the mystique and secretiveness surrounding Goldman ("In order to get your severance, you basically have to sign your soul away saying you won't write anything about the firm without getting permission"), one contact explains the firm has opened up lately: "The firm works very hard to maintain and build on this mystique, but there is a sense that it has been degrading since the IPO." Even so, this contact continues, "The overall standard for excellence and integrity is very high." Another insider adds, "The partnership is gone, but it's still a white-shoe culture."  Taking one for the talented teamNew hires take some time to get used to the careful scrutiny to which they are subjected, and employees sometimes feel that they "are under constant surveillance." At the same time, analysts and associates praise their fellow employees for being "extremely intelligent and perceptive." Explains one junior Goldman-ite, "Across the board, the people are very bright, talented, driven and excellent at what they do. The type of people [Goldman] attracts makes you want to do anything for the company. If you don't like intensity, it's not the place to be."  One banker thinks his colleagues are "incredibly smart," but believes "there's a lot of nerds" around the office. Nerdy or not, employees are "prepared to make the sacrifices that have to be made for the team to succeed." Reports one associate: "Teamwork is a word that's clichéd and overused, and I sort of cringe when I hear it elsewhere, but in some sense that's really what the firm prides itself on." Consider this tactic: "One of the messages of one [investment banking division] winter conference was the willingness to go anywhere and to do anything for the firm, particularly overseas, and to be flexible enough to be uprooted at any time," explains one insider. Teamwork, which is "definitely rewarded," does play out in everyday office life at Goldman. "If you need to talk to someone, they're not going to stop everything they're doing to talk to you, but they'll say come back at the end of the day. Even senior people are very accessible," reports one contact. "There's a hierarchy, but there's open access to all levels," echoes another insider.  However, working as part of a team of Goldman employees "can also be challenging, because you have to hold up your end, and there's always pressure to measure up to your co-workers' high standards." A current employee says, "Colleagues are always demanding and hard work is the norm." Some insiders also feel Goldman's emphasis on teamwork comes at a cost. "Individuality and creativity usually are considered much less important than being a good team player," says one contact. Even the most enthusiastic confess "the stress of work can get to be too much, and you come close to cracking." "One must conform, which feels quite oppressive at times," says one associate. "The day to day environment can be quite unpleasant." Another contact says the culture cannot only cramp individual style but might be limiting the firm as a whole: "Because of the corporate culture and the goody two-shoes image, [the firm is] less inclined to take risks." Insiders cite other problems. "Talent is mismanaged because of cliques" inside the firm, says one contact. "[There are] huge overlaps, gaps and wastage due to poor people-management and bureaucracy." Another explains how the bureaucracy might have come about: "There was a hiring binge during the boom of the 1990s that led to increasing layers of bureaucracy, which was followed by waves of layoffs during the bust years."   &nbsp;

      On July 15th, I volunteered for  urlLink Habitat For Humanity - NYC  through the Goldman Sachs Community Team Works program.&nbsp; As a team leader, I loosely supervised eight of my co-workers as we worked on a low-income housing site in the Bronx.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier in my blog, I'm a little at odds with the corporate showboating and lack of fiscal sensability that the CTW program represents.&nbsp; Have now completed the program, this is my updated story.  &nbsp;  Volunteering for Habitat for Humanity was possibly the best day of work I've had in the two years I've been working at  urlLink Goldman Sachs .&nbsp; I recommend it for everyone, not just you&nbsp;guilty, white&nbsp;liberals out there.&nbsp; I would have volunteered even if I wasn't receiving a full day's wall-street pay.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thankfully, by the time my group volunteered in mid-July, the thirteen small, three-level, two bedroom, one bathroom rowhouses located at the Bronx site were nearly complete.&nbsp; The project was already six-months over schedule and the Two AmeriCore workers supervising the site in were finishing up their one year tour of duty within the month.&nbsp; Including their meager salary and the $5000 education bonus they recieved at the end of the program, the AmericaCore volunteers were making below minimum wage.&nbsp; Of course, they weren't volunteering for the money.   The Goldman Sachs&nbsp;team, as well as another corporation's team,&nbsp;wandered in around 9am.&nbsp; Outside the work site, a pair of&nbsp;Hispanics&nbsp;were asking if work was available on the site.&nbsp; Trabajo&nbsp;Hoy?&nbsp; No, Voluntario.&nbsp; They understood and went elsewhere.   After a brief description of Habitat For Humanity's mission, periodically interrupted by morning JFK air traffic overhead, the corporate volunteers split into smaller task groups led by AmeriCore and hired volunteers.&nbsp; One group drove finishing nails into staircase banisters.&nbsp; One group swept up nails and scrap metal from the mud backyards.&nbsp; A few groups painted floors and doorframes.&nbsp;  My group&nbsp;built frames&nbsp;for gravel beds&nbsp;along the base of houses.&nbsp; Without these grave beds, rainwater spilling over the roof gutters would fall to the&nbsp;ground and splash dirt onto the stucco walls of the house.&nbsp; Because gravel is expensive (who knew?), frames are built&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep as much of the gravel by the house as possible.&nbsp; This task required driving a few stakes into the ground and securing the guiderails to them with screws; a simple task for any experienced carpenter.&nbsp; After four hours,&nbsp;my team had completed&nbsp;frames for four of the thirteen houses.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the volunteers weren't screwing things together -- they leaned the wood pieces against each other and slowly backed away -- thereby not actually completing anything.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;hey, we&nbsp;didn't do this every day.   There was an old Simpsons episode that floated around my head all day.&nbsp; In it, Ned Flander's house is brought to the ground by a freak tornado.&nbsp; The town of Springfield volunteers to rebuild his house.&nbsp; And the result is a mess.&nbsp; No floorboards could be found, so the dirt was painted over instead.&nbsp; The hallways were so badly contorted that the doorway to the master bedroom acted more as a peephole than an entrance.&nbsp; The Flander boys' new bedroom&nbsp;was decorated with a Krusty the Klown poster and, not liking the clown, they tore it down.&nbsp; "I wouldn't do that," warns a volunteer, "that's a load bearing poster."&nbsp; Seconds before the entire house creeks and crashes to the ground.   After a morning working along side one of the AmeriCore volunteers, Emily,&nbsp; she began to tell me more about the business side of the Habitat for Humanity volunteer program.&nbsp; I was surprised to learn that organizations were often obligated to donate for the privledge to volunteer.&nbsp; Their donations&nbsp;helped pay&nbsp;for supplies and labor costs.&nbsp; Goldman Sachs was paying eight thousand dollars a day to give our team the opportunity to volunteer.&nbsp; Eight thousand dollars.&nbsp; Of course, this money is grately appreciated by the charity.&nbsp; "It'll probably help pay for church groups and&nbsp;students&nbsp;to come out and volunteer," Emily said.&nbsp; "They won't need to hold a bake sale to raise the couple hundred dollars donation."   By 10:30am, those who were volunteering to "see what it'd be like", figuring out what it'd be like and started visably slacking off.&nbsp; Picking up nails was boring, and a job not nearly glamous enough to strive for doing well.&nbsp; The understaffed site wasn't able to keep them motivated.   Emily was impressed with our group.&nbsp; "Usually volunteers come out and just sit around all day.&nbsp; At least your guys are doing something," she said.&nbsp; I agreed, having not yet learned that my team wasn't using their screwguns.&nbsp; So impressed with our psuedo-productivity was Emily that she taught me how to use the  urlLink compound miter saw .&nbsp; I had miter saw privledges.&nbsp; Awww, yeah.  At 11:30am we had a watermelon break.&nbsp; I've only worked a few dozen days of hard labor in my life, but breaks are always sweeter on those days.&nbsp; Somehow, a trip to the office watercooler is rarely as rewarding.   By 12:30am, we started cleaning up.&nbsp; Our 210 minute day of volunteering was over.&nbsp; It was time to go home.&nbsp; The hired and AmeriCore volunteers stayed behind to finish the day, and the corporate volunteers wandered out of the Bronx and back into Manhattan.   By 1:30am, I already had my paycheck.&nbsp; I don't know if the Hispanics found work.  ***   Let's again crunch the numbers.&nbsp; Ten volunteers, at a median corporate salary of $1000/day, plus an $8000 a day flat fee puts the Goldman cost at around $18000 a day.&nbsp; There are well over fourteen thousand Goldman volunteers&nbsp;globally.&nbsp; A thousand volunteer days puts the cost at over $26 million dollars.&nbsp; Next, include the dozens of full time Goldman employees who coordinate and run the Community Team Works project.&nbsp; Salaries would come to at least another few million dollars, so let's put the entire Community Team Works cost at&nbsp;$30 million a year.   For this, a few houses are built.&nbsp; Of course Goldman Sachs is not motivated simply to help the less fortunate.&nbsp; Someone once said "Any nation will act in its own best interests first.&nbsp; If those actions also benefit another nation, all the better."&nbsp; The same principle applies.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to think that Goldman would lay off 120 employees (coming to approximately $30 million dollars a year) for the sake of goodwill.&nbsp;   Goldman encourages volunteering, but does not encourage taking vacation days.&nbsp; That implies that it expects its $30 million (or 30  bucks  as its said on  the street ) to provide benefits beyond simply taking a day off.&nbsp;  It may be true that people encouraged to volunteer will in turn become more generous and volunteer more often, but Goldman gains nothing directly from this.&nbsp; It is also very unlikely that Goldman believes that volunteering will increase employee moral so substantially that productivity will outweight the costs. I wish I could find the source, but the Goldman Sachs CEO has been quoted as saying something to the effect of: one-fifth of our employees generated 80% of the profits.&nbsp; Needless to say, I don't think he cares much for pions' incremental increases in moral.  The answer is that Community Team Works is a supposed networking venture.&nbsp; Volunteer groups are pulled from across the firm, bringing employees together that would never usually come into contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;   In theory, this is a bargain at twice the price.&nbsp; For a company that pulls in ten digit revenues, $30 million is a drop in the bucket.&nbsp; It doesn't take many extra intra-department&nbsp;deals to make this a worthwhile venture.&nbsp; Whether this is true in practice, I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief is that it does not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are natural networks&nbsp;network at these functions, and those who are&nbsp;not or&nbsp;who are lower level employees do not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people I have seen associated with Community Team Works are either lowe level employees who can easily schedule time to play carpenter for a day or those who are happily stuck in middle are approaching the outting as a chance to do something new.&nbsp; Those who are natural networks will&nbsp;probably have networked anyway.  But hey, at least a few houses were built.

      I'm babysittin' a kitten this weekin'.&nbsp; Thanks to my wireless laptop, this blog, and the internet, you can read my story realtime.&nbsp; Intel should use me in a commercial.  Despite the persian rug, my apartment is not kitten friendly.&nbsp; The leather furnature, high bookcases, and dangling wires have forced me to box the kitten inside my kitchen alcove.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have anything with which to block the three foot entrance to the kitchen. Ad Hoc improvision has begun.&nbsp; It started with the dismanteling of an old wire lattice shelf.&nbsp; It's since included a picture of Bruce Springsteen, the side of my computer desk, and an umbrella to the stack of obstacles pinning in the cat.&nbsp;   He's out now and fishing around my laundry basket.&nbsp; Because that's what I'd choose to do with new found freedom.  He knocked over the picture and the desk side fell, releasing the umbrella which sprang into the air...ugh.&nbsp; (Rube) Goldberg, or the Three Stooges would be proud.&nbsp; Back in he goes.  It's like trying to cage in the Raptors from Jurassic Park.&nbsp; He attacks the boundary, tests the fence, evaluates and attacks again.&nbsp; Everything just collapsed onto itself and the kitchen is quiet.&nbsp;  Uh oh....

      To say that Hollywood lacks originality is as tired a story as, well...  Police Academy 8 will be coming too-soon to a theater near you.  To  urlLink quote  series creator Paul Maslansky, "I thought, 'Why not?'"  I loved the original  urlLink Police Academy , but at 13 I also understood that "Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow" was a rediculously un-necessary seventh addition to the series.  I'm still not sure why they set it in Russia, 5 years after the collapse of the USSR.

      Who wants to make a decision when all outcomes feel so far from ideal?  If it has not been said before then I'm saying it now: it is the leaders who make those decisions.  At some point within the last year, I decided that I am to be a leader and that I will assume all the responsibilities that being a leader entails.   Never have I felt more like a child being dragged through a crowded department story by a hurried parent. Suddenly, I think I understand why an artist can draw a simple, single line in the sand and call it art. Will a decisive future always require what feels like a forceful departure from habit?  No one ever told me that  life  took such a long time.  During these times that I balance myself on the fence, I think of a lesson I intercepted from the airwaves one Saturday morning.  The characters and plot have long evaporated from my mind, but the lesson and  deus ex machina  have remained. Our protagonist, faced with a seemingly unanswerable dilemma, most likely deciding which girl to the ask to dance if this was Saturday morning television, is told by a friend to assign side of a coin to one of the girls.  The friend will flip the coin and the decision will be made by the random coin.  The protagonist, thankfully relieved of the decision, assigns the girls to the coin.  With the protagonist anxiously awaiting the outcome, the friend begins to flip the coin but instead startles the protagonist and asks him what side of the coin, and what girl, he was hoping would turn up in the flip.  That girl is the choice he should make.  While we're quoting life lessons learned from network television, there's a great allegory from the  urlLink West Wing  ( urlLink episode guide ) that seems appropriate to rip off. A Dutchman was out walking one morning when his path was blocked by a seemingly impassible wall.  Unsure as to how he would find his way to the other side, he took off his cap and threw it over the wall.  With his cap on the other side, he had no choice now but to find a way over the wall.  On the toughest days, it's sometimes all we can do but throw our caps over the wall.  But perhaps sometimes, and maybe on those days especially, that's enough.

      The  urlLink Microsoft .NET Terrarium  looks pretty cool.  The Terrarium is an application provided by Microsoft to test the .NET Software Development platform for code and platform incompatibility errors.  Developers use .NET to create virtual bug organisms and write the hunt/gather/reproduce logic that their bugs will follow while co-existing and competing with other developers' creations in the Terrarium.  It looks like it could be amusing, particularly for all those programmers out there who dream of world domination (or of virtual bugs eating virtual plants).

      Big things. Big, big things, my friends.  Today, I, David Bernat, am happy to announce the first of many events in this autumn's highly anticipated "I Get Around" tour.  This September, for three nights only, the tour bus will be rolling into Charleston, SC for the annual  urlLink NeuroEconomics 2004  conference at the beautiful Kiawah Island Gold Resort.  Check out this list of  urlLink performers ! It promises to be one mind-blowing show.

      An excellent  urlLink NYT article  on the psychology of revenge.   "In some cases it may be possible for people to assuage their feelings of outrage by publicly protesting the injustice.  Signing a petition...seemed to give many some satisfaction."   Maybe this is why a protest is sometimes claimed more important than a proposed solution.

      This  urlLink flash movie  is an amusing, dire  urlLink warning  from my favorite chicken little protest group, the  urlLink ACLU .  There's a large difference between pooling public data and infringing on the public's liberty. This is somehow missed whenever a politician decides to end his career and propose national ID cards. How is a database that contains my name, address, phone number, thumb print, eye color, height, and weight anything other than a convenience? It's information already dispersed in the public realm.  Crime Reports are available to the public and often published daily in local newspapers. Speaking in sweeping generalities, most definably hazardous jobs are rewarded with bonus hazard pay, a right that many unions are happy to fight for.  Why is there protest if state governments want to network their crime records?  It would tremendously powerful crime fighting tool, a wealth of information available to every cop in a squad car.  No longer would a bank robber from Missouri be given only a warning when he's pulled over without a break-light in Kansas.  A more slippery slope... The integration of medical records and insurance information will be a welcomed improvement for anyone who has ever filled out another damn clipboard or needed duplicate medical tests because originals could not be found.    Underneath all the fluff, the ACLU does highlight a real possibility. There will unlikely be any "High Cholesterol Meatball Sub Surcharge," but just as insurance companies offer discounts for customers who drive safer cares, if the technology existed, they'd offer discounts for customers who make it a habit to go to the gym and eat healthy. A government mandate that forces all customers to adhere to such a plan is certainly a violation of their rights, but an opt-in plan would be a blessing for those tired of paying the high healthcare costs of some schlub whose three square meals a day are Wendy's Hamburgers.  The bottom line is that these technologies will exist, and in my opinion, they should exist. Each improvement allows corportations to provide better service and tailored prices. This is capitalism. It's neither than problem nor the concern...   "While the private company that runs the [Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange] program has been very secretive about what data MATRIX contains, government sources report that it includes names and address of family members, property ownership, marine vessels, bankruptcies, liens and judgments, voter registrations, and criminal offender information."   This, I believe is all public data. The real debate is of BIG Government vs. small gov't. Who should hold this mass of data? While it may seem ominous for the Government to hold all this information about its citizens, the Government exists to serve the public and a series of checks and balances are in order to give us at least some power over our data. Private companies exist to generate profits. There aren't even any shareholders.   "However, given the amount of information that is available in today’s commercial databases, even more details of your private life might be captured and catalogued."   It's a scare tactic, but it's true. But there's probably no one out there reading this who hasn't used a supermarket value card to get a discount off their groceries.  The concern shouldn't be the technology, the concern is that sufficient guidelines, user permissions, and "chinese walls" in place. (A "Chinese wall" is an intra-corporation barrier restricting the passing of information between two seperate entities that would give each other unfair advantages in a public market. For instance, the credit department of Goldman Sachs can't tell the Equities traders of any propriety, non-public credit information that would influence Equities traders' decisions in the market.)  This may be so difficult as to yield the technology valueless. I don't know. But I wish the ACLU would focus its lawyers on these questions instead of using the database's "ominous name" as a chance to gain ground on its perpetual fight against the government. Sometimes I'm left thinking the ACLU is just looking for a good fight, or a good target, rather than looking to fight for my liberties.

      Frickin' Phillies. All I wanted was to go on vacation to Boston for six days and come home with the Phillies lead in tact. Six days later, the Phillies are 5 and a half games out of first place.  Tonight's post-game headline on the Phillies  urlLink web site , after forfeiting the lead to the Cubs, reads "Phils keep Maddux at 299, but fall to Cubs." Are things suddenly so bleak that we cheer our keeping of a hall of fame pitcher out of the record books for another week?  Sure, the Phillies never win the games that World Series teams need to win. But as history has shown us, the Phillies are supposed to stay atop of the division all year, stall in the final weeks of the season, fall two games out of first place and give up on the pennant race. It's as much a part of the Philadelphia sports tradition as Rocky and the art museum or arresting Eagles' fans.  Fire Larry Bowa.
