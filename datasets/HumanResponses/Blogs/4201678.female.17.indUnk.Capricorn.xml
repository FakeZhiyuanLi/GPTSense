      Have you ever wondered which hurts the most?    Saying something and wishing you hadn't?    ?or-    Saying nothing and wishing you had?    I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.    Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might    break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.    Have u ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid    of losing what you already had with that person?    Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't.    You can't tell your heart what to do.    It does it on its own.... when you least suspect it, or even when you    don't want it to.    Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that    other person was too afraid to let you?    Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too    much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at    all.    Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of    rejection was too hard to handle?    We tell lies when we are afraid...    afraid of what we don't know,    afraid of what others will think,    afraid of what will be found out about us.    But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.    Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.    Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have    done, or could have had.

      y do we love b? so we can have somebody to talk 2? someone who can be der pag gus2 natin gumala? a person na pwedeng manlibre satiin? taong magbibitbit ng gamit mo? alalay for short! eh panu kung di ka nya mahal would u still love him/her? would you still continue 2 care 4 dat person? bakit naman endeeee? u didnt love love dat person para magkaroon ka ng alalay, magkaroon ka ng instant meal dahil libre, taong gagawa ng assignments mo or projects, or taong mihihila mo if u want to go out... if dats wat u think about love well sori ang babaw mo, loving a person doesnt nid 2 hav a criteria na dapat maganda o guwapo, dapat mabait or understanding, kc once u fall inlove u take the risk of accepting dat person kahit maingay sya ma2log, ung hilik ng hilik kahit matakaw sya o sobrang fat na indi kau kaysa pag puno ang jeeep! kahit sobrang moody nya na kulang nalang ay sapakin mo sa inis! ung sobrang selosa na pati barkada pinagseselosan bad3p dbah? and ung napaka-arte OA kung baga! o kahit anu png things dat would turn u off... hirap tlaga magmahal trying 2 be perfect kc gus2 mong magtagal pero endi un ang sagot sa lahat... ACCEPTING da real person fully kc if u said na mahal mo sya u dont nid 2find answers kung y mo sya love... kc lahat ng tao nagbabago but if u accept dat person magbago man sya in da middle of ur relationship endi ka masasaktan kc u know dat darating din un.. tsaka tanggap mo sya ng buo... mahirap gawin pero masarap subukan dahil wala ng sasaya pa if u let one person feel na MAHAL NA MAHAL mo sya without asking 4 any return... den u can say wow un pla ang LOVE!

        Lahat ng tao ay may pakiramdam. Kahit sabihin mo pa na manhid sya may pakiramdam pa rin. Kaso may mga tao na nagpapanggap. Para hindi malaman ng iba kung ano ang tunay na nararamdaman. Sa pagkukunwaring yun parepareho lang nahihirapan.Kung ayaw mo sa tao. Sbhin mo ang totoong nararamdaman mo. Wag mo syang pahirapan pa. Masakit man ang katotohanan at least d na sya umaasa pa. Pareho lang kayo mahihirapan. Makukulitan ka sa kanya at maari ka pang magalit sa kanya. Aasa sya at pag nawalan ng pagasa magagalit pa sayo. Hindi dahilan ang hiya para hindi mo i-turn down mo ang manliligaw po. Saktan mo sya habang mas maaga dahil pag tumagal pa mahihirapan na sya lumimot.Kung mahal mo naman ang isang tao. Sabihin mo sa kanya. Malay mo mahal ka rin nya. Kasi habang tinatago mo ang nararamdaman mo para sa kanya ikaw rin ang mahihirapan. At kung mahal ka rin nya sya rin ay mahihirapan dahil aakalhin nya na ayaw mo sa kanya. Diba nagsayang ka ng pagkakataon.

      My Confession   My love for you is  Fake it was never  True and I promise not to  Love and care for you again. I’ll  Suspend all the love I’m offering.  I also want to tell you that  The last time we met and spoke was  Really making me feel disgusted it’s  Really planted in my heart and brain. I  Hate to remember it, I’ll never ever  Miss your company and I would love to  See you jump off a sky caper, I hate to  Be with you again, one more thing is  The caring I’ve showed you is nothing and that  I hate to see you  Not for another chance and I really don’t  Cry whenever you’re down or misunderstood  I hate also you’re company that  Sometimes I’d rather be  In school because I’m really bored when I’m  With you and I wish that we will be  Enemies forever, I don’t want us to be  Together again and never ever again  Cross each others path. I long  That we will be apart, because life with  You is hell on earth, being without  You is pure happiness and there will be  Supreme you and there will be  No loneliness, I hope we will  Forget one another and never  Meet again at any place and time because  I can’t really bear to see you  Just to see you one more time  Coz that could make me vomit, I know you  Will give me enough feeling of  Nausea that will never again would have the  Strength to continue living  And your memory will irritate me  For the rest of my life, I  Long to tell you this – I don’t  LOVE YOU!  Goodbye.   (Read it again skipping in lines)

      Travel more then one (1) hour out of town together.  Dance with or without music. (Always ask first, not only with words). Be a prince to her parents. (Brownie points) Share a plate of spaghetti. (Ever see Lady and the Tramp?) Give her roses or wildflowers. For no reason, often. Do the little things. (I.E., Pull out chairs, open doors, Notice when she does the little things. Never, ever forget  urlLink holidays ! (Take him/her somewhere!) Girls like guys who will listen to sappy love songs. (When she's around, and without groaning) Always ask them how their day was...and listen! Tell her you love her only when you mean it and make sure she knows you mean it.  Write poetry/songs for her Sing or play a musical instrument. (If you can) Draw. (If you can) Be nice to her friends, but not too nice. Call from your vacation spot just to say hi. Go 30 minutes out of your way just spend a few hours with her. Do things you have never done before with her. DON'T make her do anything she doesn't want to. Be there for the good and the bad times. Walk her to her door. Don't just tell her you love her, show her. Spend all day with her doing nothing. Go home and call her to talk about nothing. Find out her favorite flower and give it to her for her birthday. (No matter how difficult it is to find) Know her favorite flower, color, number, animal, song (or band) and movie. Treat her the way she wants to be treated, not the way other girls want to be treated. When you say I'm sorry look them in the eyes. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. Staring is rude Share your deep dark secrets with each other. Tell them your fantasies. Make them feel important. Have your picture taken together.Eat ice cream together. Send a silly/sappy card just because you were thinking about them. Carve your names into a tree/table.I f you cannot feel their heartbeat, you are not close enough. Everyone deserves a second chance. (Or third...) When people put them down, defend them. ALWAYS be honest with them. (Even you know it's gonna hurt it'll hurt more if you lie.) Give them stuffed animals Treat her like a princess Keep him company when he's outside
