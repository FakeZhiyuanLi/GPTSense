      Well, our week is winding down... we had so much fun visiting with my Mom and my Grama. What a wonderful visit we did have! I hadn't seen my Grama in about 8 years. She's 80 years old now and still as beautiful and as feisty as ever. :) Eric got a kick out of having my Mom, Grama and I all here, because we are three versions of each other. My Grama is a great lady. She has raised a huge, successful family and it's so fun to reminisce!   I'm the second grandchild that she's actually stayed with which I thought was neat, considering we have such a huge family with nearly two dozen grandkids. I had fun doting on her and taking care of her. Plus, yesterday we went to see Shrek 2 which was a cute movie. We all go back up to north for a mini-reunion next weekend.   My Grampa passed away four years ago today. I hope he was smiling down on all of us having such a good time back in Iowa where he's from. The reunion is actually at the cemetary where he's buried. Grama comes back every year to visit.   I have so many stories to share, but am zombied out right now. Am going to go put my feet up out back and watch Jakey play with the neighbor kids. Hope everyone is doing well!

      Jake and I are driving up to Wisconsin to get Mom today, then back tomorrow. Then airport to get Grama on Friday. Then up to Cedar Falls on Sunday. Back at it on Monday! Thrilled to pieces to have my Mom and Grama here for a visit. See you all next week. :)

      Good Monday afternoon, y'all. Heh Heh Heh! :) All is well in our corner of the world. This weekend seemed to fly by. We had company yesterday that begun as a BBQ in the park and turned in to a full-blown ordeal late into the evening hours. Ahh, good company, so it's okay. It made for a head-ache ridden morning today though. *yawn*   Jake's feisty today, making up songs about escalators of all things. He's currently eating lunch for the second time this afternoon... scooby doo mac & cheese with extra parm. I just clicked on the A/C, it's already darn humid out there today, and my headache won't tolerate too much today. Ahh, creature comforts.   I'm busy preparing for my Mom and Grama to be here later this week. Actually, I feel like I should be busying, but mostly the house is pretty darned clean and spiffy, if not downright pretty. Can't complain! I do still have to tackle a little laundry but that's about it.   Was that thunder? or a jet plane? We're supposed to get strong storms this afternoon. Would do us some good what with all this humidity.   I went container-gardening crazy again this weekend. Ahh, the joys of apartment gardening. Actually, I'm getting mighty sick of sharing walls with other families, but I'm dealing. Life is good! Anyway... I planted some basil and cherry tomatoes. I also have some fabulous mixed plant pots overflowing with geraniums, petunias and fuschias. Downright loverly! Everyone who comes over asks me what the flying pig out front is supposed to mean, and I dunno... expect the unexpected! We pride ourselves on being a little off kilter here, ok? That should be apparent by now, right?   I'm off to make chocolate cocoa cookies with peanut butter chips. Fattening, eh... probably, but I did buy myself Target's Finest shorts today, a size SMALLER than expected. Four sizes smaller than LAST YEAR even! Yay! But it's not something I'm up in a squander about... life's too damn short not to enjoy a cookie now and then.   Cheers!

      I've fallen out of the habit of blogging, so I've decided that it's not something I want to pay for right now. Blogger has gotten all fresh and has sparkly new features, so I'm over here, coincidentally, where I began blogging almost three years ago. I did register swirlypants.com which I may be hosting in the future, I dunno. If so, this blog will be moved over there.   I love these pre-made programs... blogger is really a great one if you don't feel like doing the whole shebang. Plus, I've signed up with hello.com for the image hosting (which is also free) so there really isn't the necessity to shell out a darn dime. Typepad was a GREAT program, don't get me wrong... perfect for MT fans who want something a little more ready-made as well. I just like blogger because it's freefreefree.  The thing is, I once had several blogs going, with various programs, complicated layouts, extensive conent... etc etc etc. I'm just not into it anymore. I could do all of the stuff it takes to get a big, full-blown web site going again, I just don't feel like it anymore. Got the point? Good. ;)  I just don't feel the desire to devote a lot of time to online blogging projects lately. Honestly, I don't really like (or fit in to) the whole blogging thing anymore. My posts are definitely rambling and I'm never really writing for an audience other than a hand-full of friends I care to keep up with and of course, my family who also reads my blog. If it weren't for them, I'd probably just pack up the computer and call it a day. :)   As far as feedback, I believe you have to register here to be able to comment which is a handy new feature, but if you'd like to drop me a note now, or ever in the future, just send an email to liz@atypicalmom.com. It will still get to me.   My life lately... has been busy. Not with any major monumental stuff... just life. Busy life with my almost 5-year-old and his friends mostly. They dominate our afternoons and that's okay... he totally deserves it!   I'm still considering going to work part-time somewhere. The extra income would just be a bonus at this point because our financial situation has improved greatly due to a much-needed raise that hubby conquered. Of course, every penny counts and debts rue the day... so the faster we can dig out, the better.   We're looking forward to my Grandma flying in from Denver for a quick visit here next week! I'm going up to Wisconsin before-hand to gather up my Mom and we're going to greet Grama together at the airport... what fun! I haven't seen her since I graduated high school and I'm just tickled about finally introducing her to my family.   Our little family has already been so busy with plans lately... we're thankful to have great friends in the area from 'back east' as well as the new friendships we've begun to make with people in the area. We're jam-packed with plans and fun over the rest of the summer. Hopefully highlighted by a visit from Amy ... the one piece of the puzzle that remains in New England.   It's chilly and rainy here in the midwest today. Chilliest it's been in weeks. Hubby and I have a date tonight, doing what I don't know. I just look forward to holding his big, warm hand and enjoying some alone-time with my best friend.
