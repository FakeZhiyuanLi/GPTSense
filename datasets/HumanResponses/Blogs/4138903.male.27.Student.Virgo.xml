      i am off to new york for the weekend and i cannot wait to eat cafe habana. i am going to eat cubans and steak enchiladas until the cows come home. on an exciting side note, the anaheim angels are in town playing the yankees and they are staying at our hotel (grand hyatt). caroline said she saw a couple of them last night (francisco rodriguez and tim salmon), and that at least those two are staying on our floor. i will hopefully run into garrett and try and talk to him. too bad we do not have time for a game.

      it is friday morning and i just finished learning how to properly brief a case. at least i think i learned how. i suppose i will not know for sure until i am forced to complete a brief on my own. regardless, i feel like now i am authroized to throw around legal jargon such as torts and case briefs. i just hope too many people don't ask me what they mean.  i also met a girl who is originally from the valley. she said she was born in sepulveda but currently lives in saugus. the only bad thing about her is that she went to notre dame. there are actually quite a few people here from southern california and it is kind of nice.

      two straight losses by the dodgers do not have me in a good mood. also, what has happened to the god that used to be known as eric gagne? all of a sudden he appears to be human. personally i blame the general manager for a series of poor trades and i am going to do what i can to have him replaced. any thoughts?

      i am hoping that things will settle down since everything has been so chaotic the last couple of days. i think a large part of it though is simply trying to get organized with all of my new books and such.  i took the train in this morning and it was nice not having to sit in traffic. the train itself was not anything to write home about though, and it seems like everyday they find a new way to make me mad. a few days ago i discovered that you cannot purchase tickets from the website. well, i guess you can, but in a much more convoluted way. you have to fill out a form, mail the form in with a voided check, and they will send you a password. you then take your password and can order tickets online. the only problem is that they will still have to mail you back your tickets and that will take a extra few days. i am not really sure why i cannot simply print it out on line, after all, you can even do that for movies nowadays. to make matters even more annoying, they do not take any credit cards at all. they have no automated machines to purchase tickets from, and they are more expensive when you buy them on the train. taking all of this information into account, i went to the train station last week to buy some tickets, but they were inexplicably closed. why in the world were they closed at 1:15 p.m. on a friday. anyways, today was the first day i rode the train so i made sure to arrive early enough to buy my ticket from the counter so i would not be charged extra for buying it on the train. any ideas what happened? they told me they do not accept out-of-state checks. they said they only take checks from areas they serve: illinois, indiana and wisconsin. these people are killing me. luckily i had a few dollars in cash, which is usually not the case.  school was fine this morning. i was finally able to log in to my e-mail account and i had 147 messages waiting for me. it took forever for me to delete them all and they were all pretty much useless.  more soon

      today was my second day at school, but really our first in a classroom setting. nothing too intense which was nice. we discussed one of our summer reading assignments, a civil action written by jonathan harr, and it did not last too long.  after our classroom session was the exciting part: i got my locker. i felt like a junior high kid all over again hoping i got a locker near my friends and not in the "d" building. shannon always said that "d" building was the worst place at frost to have you locker. i also began making some friends. shawn: one kid today saw my michigan notebook and he started to tell me he went to notre dame. he said he was depressed about how bad their football team is and he said that last year's usc game was the worst. i told him we went and that we loved it. who knows if he will want to sit near me again tomorrow. it is kind of surprising, but everybody has been very warm and friendly. i think it is because we are all desperately hoping that having a few friends will dramatically help us out through the entire process. personally, i do not think anything will help us out through the process.  i ended up driving to school again today. that was the last of that though as i am all set to take the train on wednesday. i got stuck in a bit of traffic and all i kept thinking about was how nice it would be to be able to simply sit back and relax. or maybe even do some reading. it was also be nice not to have to pay the $11 for parking. not a huge deal though as i will simply have to pay for a train ticket. at least i do not have to pay for gas going downtown.  i bought some more supplies from the bookstore today and i am praying my student loan money comes through soon.  are any of you guys watching the olympics? i have paid very little attention myself, other than to see that the basketball team is embarrassing themselves. oh, and i wish i was michael phelps.  the reading assignments have not kicked into high gear yet and i am thankful for that. unfortunately we are still keeping very busy taking care of little things such as registering for various accounts and finding our way around the campus.  more work to do then off to bed. talk to you soon

      tonight has been a rough night for julius (my computer for those of you who did not know). i attempted to download an update from aol and the next thing i know is that julius is completely screwed. i have no clue what happened. all i know is that my start up menu was different, my taskbar had been rearranged, my printer no longer worked, and worst of all, i could not surf the web. i was seriously concerned that serious damage had been done.  i ended up spending over two hours on the phone with multiple toshiba representatives and i basically had to reset my computer to the way it was when i purchased it. i saved a few files that i had created, but it was almost like my computer was brand new again. i had to re-install softward that i had personally installed and it took quite a while.  i am not really sure what happened, but i really do not think it was a problem specific to my system. i think it was a problem specific to the aol download, needless to say i will not be doing that again, and i am not too concerned at this point. you will all be happy to know that julius is up and running again without any apparent side effects.

      the first day of school has come and gone and it was actually not too bad. i suppose that should not be too much of a surprise though, as we did very little work of our own.  we began the day by piling everybody into a cramped elementary-schoolish auditorium where they proceeded to tell us that they were happy to have us and that they just knew that everyone of us was going to succeed. i think just about everybody in the room was kind of thinking that everybody except for them would succeed. we were all a bit nervous as we really did not know what to expect. we have all heard the horror stories.  we left the auditorium about 10:00 or so and began our first exercise. we had to read a short article and then write a persuasive article on what our feelings were. the point was so that they can evaluate our writing and assign us to some extra saturday sessions if they feel they are necessary. i think my essay was fine though so i am not too concerned. after all, i was a professional journalist.  that took us up to lunch and i headed over to johnny rockets for a quick burger. our after-lunch activities were just as boring as the morning. i took a picture for a law school i.d., i bought my books and that was about it. books were ridicuous expensive but i guess that was to be expected. this is, after all, law school. at least they are big and jam-packed with information so i feel like i am getting my money's worth. and no, joan, i did not buy any used books. why would i want to save money? my arms will probably be sore for days simply from carrying my books a couple of blocks to the car.  that was really about it for the first day. the most exciting part of my day might have been finding out that i am deathly afraid of covered parking garages. they scare the hell out of me and i am going to try and avoid them at all cost. mainly i am scared that i am going to scrape the top of the car on the roof and scratch it up. i am also concerned that i might hit a bump, bounch a little, and get decapitated. are these thoughts rational? moreover, these things collapse during every earthquake. and no i do not want to hear about how there are no earthquakes in chicago.  gotta run. more later

      hello all...my inaugural post is going to be a short one as the first day of school has nearly arrived and i am determined to get a good night's sleep. it is hard to believe that i will officially be a law student in less than 12 hours, but that is the twisted and confusing world in which we currently reside.  i really am not sure what to expect tomorrow, next week, this semester, or from law school in general. i am both excited and terrified about what the coming days, months and years have in store for me. i am obviously excited about the myriad of challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, but as with any new experience, the uncertainty you have is not a pleasant feeling. i am anxious to get started though and establish some sort of routine. i am really hoping to try and maintain order in my life, and not be the stereotypical graduate student who cannot even find time in his or her day to shave/make dinner/check e-mail...... i say now that i will keep on top of my workload and never fall behind, but what student has not uttered that phrase at least a thousand times in their life.  at least i know i am not alone in my ventures into the unknown. i know that i have the support of my family and that means the world to me. just don't expect me to show much love to anybody over the next three years. well, maybe a little bit over christmas vacation or during the summer. maybe.  perhaps i should not be so worried about starting school. after all, brenden is beginning his first day of kindergarten and i am sure he is just as nervous. i suppose it is fitting in a way that we are both starting together.  thanks again for everything. i will do my best to make everybody proud. hope all is well.  devin
