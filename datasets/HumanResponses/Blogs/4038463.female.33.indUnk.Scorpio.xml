      Well the inevitable happened!  I was on the phone with my mother-in-law pouring myself a cup of coffee this morning and my front tooth fell right out of my mouth and into the kitchen sink!  As you can imagine I was in a panic to be sure that it did not go down the drain!  Of course I am using the word tooth loosely since it is actually a piece of metal.  This crown has been my tooth for about 25 years, and I can hardly believe it.  Way longer than the adult tooth that I lost in grade five!  So now I am left to try and figure out the best way to solve the problem.  Depending on how much vanity I am willing to sacrifice, it will cost between $1000 and $10,000 to be able to continue smiling.  The saga continues.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I have a long week end to hide from all my "funny" friends (I'm expecting compant tomorrow.  How vain should I be?  Would you cancel?).

      Today is Friday!  Horay long weekend!!  This will be three out of three long weekends this summer that rain has been called.  Can you believe it?  Hopefully there will be some grace this weekend.  I'm glad that we have no plans that will be in jeopardy; that is as long as we will still be able to go out on the boat with my parents tomorrow.  The boys did well in their swimming lessons: they both graduated into the next level.  Jadon has passed into level 4 and Killian (as he has decided to call himself from now on) into level 3.  They worked hard and it shows!  Harley has also worked hard.  He is completely toilet trained.  He is out of diapers and has had no mistake since he learned two days ago.  He did "miss the pot" on a bowl movement today, but it was at the pot, so that was just because of lack of experience instead of lack of control.  I am so impressed by how willing he has been to learn and to try.  Harley Rocks!!

      Today was the second last day of swimming lessons for the boys.&nbsp; It has been pleasant enough but I will be pleased to go back to the days when we are not expected anywhere.&nbsp; It makes for a week of very little work done since I try to get my work done in the morning since my discipline seems to dwindle as the day gets hotter.   I'm so proud of Harley.&nbsp; Both yesterday and today he woke me up in the morning saying "mummy I have to pee!" as he was holding himself.&nbsp; He seems to be completely trained!&nbsp; Incredible!!&nbsp; I guess he just made up his mind.   I'm reading a book about setting boundaries in marriage.&nbsp; Evidently, I have a lot to learn.&nbsp; I feel like I am learning a new language when I read it.&nbsp; I know that I have a long way to go since my instinct on&nbsp;the teaching&nbsp;is that it is missing the point and perhaps a little pat.&nbsp; Because I know I do not have it all figured and am over my head in some areas, I conclude that&nbsp;my instincts are&nbsp;very, very wrong.&nbsp; I just started the book so I will speak about it again later after I have gotten in a little deeper.

      When I was in grade five I fell off my bicycle on the way home from school.&nbsp; I smashed out my two front teeth.&nbsp; Since about 1992 they have been kind of loose.&nbsp; Every&nbsp; year one or the other falls out and I look like...well you can imagine.&nbsp; It really messes with my vanity since I am not bad looking....with the teeth in that is.   So anyway, finally my husband has a job that has a dental plan.&nbsp; I have been so excited because my head has grown since grade five (I'm 33) and my teeth, well they stayed the same.&nbsp; So since he started his job I have been anticipating October so I can go and take some dental action.&nbsp; My one tooth has been very loose and I was hoping and praying that it would stick until then.&nbsp; Then last week I found out that the six month wait for the plan to take effect begins after the three month probationary period, thus extending the wait until January.&nbsp; My tooth did not hold.   I was at the dentist yesterday to have the thing pasted back in and what a bunch of drama awaited me there!&nbsp; I had to take the kids in with me and since it only takes about 10 minutes to have the tooth reattached.&nbsp; We all piled into the cubicle and I got comfortable in the dentist chair (I guess) and before I knew it my six year old hits the floor!   He fainted if you can believe it!&nbsp; He turned out to be fine but I sure wasn't.&nbsp; The dentist told me that to have my teeth repaired it would cost $10,000!&nbsp; I guess the tooth was fractured and there was nothing to reattach the crown to and there was an infection to boot!!   So that so far is the end of that drama since I do not have that much money.&nbsp; I guess I have some decisions to make.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; As you can imagine I am pretty upset.&nbsp; And O, about the tooth, I had the dentist go ahead and paste it in until I do make that decision but it is of course loose again already.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that moment however, I can still manage a smile.

      Last night my husband and I went to see King Arthur.&nbsp; It was a pretty good movie although it was a bit insubstantial.&nbsp; Still it entertained us.&nbsp; neither of us are familiar with the story of King Arthur so it was good to become more familiar.&nbsp; I do wonder if it is very close to the first story or if it was more of that Hollywood stuff.   It's another week of swimming lessons.&nbsp; The kids are enjoying it.&nbsp; Last week was the most busy week I can remember having in some time.&nbsp; I am hoping for a quieter week this week.   Harley is toilet training this week.&nbsp; He is wearing underwear and has done a great job so far.&nbsp; He does the best job on days he is outside since he is so entertained by being able to pull his pants down and make his older brothers laugh as he pees.&nbsp; Keegan has a good belly laugh every time.&nbsp; Kids and toilet humour.&nbsp; It's a crowd pleaser!

      The summer is almost over and the kids will be back to school.  I can't wait to have a clean house again!  I have been spending a lot of time with the kids and have enjoyed them a lot.  We have had fun, but the house has suffered from neglect!  I bought a bunch of perenials for my garden today.  I am looking forward to planting the ones that I have yet to plant tomorrow.  My gardens are finally looking lush and full...sort of.  I am getting there anyway.  My goal now is to try to move plants so that the blooms are well distributed throughout the blooming season.
