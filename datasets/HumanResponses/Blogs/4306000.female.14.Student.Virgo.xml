       So, last night i watched  this documentary...       It was about some really really backward tribe in [i think it was] Papua New Guinea. The women had some sort of skirt thingy wrapped around their bottoms, nothing on top & the men.... hahaha.. i'm not sure what was 'there'. Anyway, the husband of one of the women (Alohop) had died, they (the tribe) said sorcerers ate him and they were going to eat the sorcerer as revenge.. but they were also scared of the sorcerer, so they built a treehouse to stay in and went down in groups to hunt for food. Apparently, sorcerers could take many different forms of animals and catch human beings to eat. Sorcerers look at people as animals to eat...      Meanwhile.. the uncle of the guy (who was in another tribe) who was accused of being a sorcerer said that, indeed, his nephew (Nanole) was a sorcerer.. he said that his nephew ate the guy's flesh, then put his skin back on, after a while, the guy woke up, then died later that night. he said Alohop's tribe was too weak and Nanole could easily kill them.      Back to the tribe of the guy who died.. their hunting wasn't going along very well, their food was running out, and it was raining a lot, so their wood for fire was all wet... and they actually said  "Who's causing all these rain?"  and  "If a child dies of hunger, we will definetely ask them for payment."         What the?! rain is rain.. well, later they sacrificed a pig to the gods, to stop the rain... they also decided not to kill & eat the sorcerer Nonale.. they were afraid Nonale's family would kill them..      I mean, wow, this is just  amazing!  these people are  so  weird... but it was awesome.. i learnt something.. gross as it may be..

       for me.. it would have to be music..    family.. they are alright.. nothing much.. friends.. also alright..   but music.. there is one particular song.. it's not a pop song.. it's an instrumental, not very famous.. by this violinist called Mayya, the song is called Golden Rain..this is a really great song.. helps me think.. really  think  about everything.. so.. anyway..       What inspires YOU?

      some people their parents are like, super overprotective.. why? what the hell? i mean, don't they raise their kids well enough to trust them?!    好孩子是不会变坏的， 而变坏的本来就不是好孩子     (in case you cant read that... it means kids who are good won't "turn bad" & those who turn bad weren't good in the 1st place.)         i have a friend... she's quite rich.. it's very very hard for her to manage to go  out & play..   she once told me she's not supposed to "simply mention" her father's name...   What The....? it's not liike she's Paris Hilton or something.. rich is rich.. but not famous... what's the big deal? is someone going to pop put of nowhere &amp; kidnap her? no! she still looks ordinary, like the rest of us..      it's when i see ppl with this problem i feel thankful for my parents (technically, father)... i have no limits, because i know mine, i know what i'm not supposed to do

      is there a god? i really don't know.... every religion thinks their god is the ultimate best one, but.. really? how do they know there IS a god.. let alone whether it's the best god or not..  if god is like.. the almighty... why does he lets all these terrorist attacks, wars, bombings happen? ok, so maybe it's his freakish way of controlling population... then what about things like child abuse? what about that? why does it  happen?  i used to be a baptist... kids usually follow whatever religion their parents believe in.. but now? i dunno.. maybe i should have no religion.

      do any of you like... hate your siblings? i have an older brother & 3 younger half-sisters.. they're quite alright, but i always feel like i'm sort of 'in between'... not cute &amp; not smart. my brother is my father's darling.. they've always been close. i'm also close to my father, but not as much as my brother.. my half-sisters... they don't really like my father, so he sort of tries to be as nice as possible to them.. i hate it.. he doesn't know.. he doesn't see the way they look at him... he doesn't know they couldn't care less about them and they wouldn't care if he dropped dead right now.. i do. i know. it isn't fair  so for me.. i just "fall-in-between" not cute, not smart, not anything

      what do you think about divorce? my parents are divorced. they never really got along well, so, i guess it was for the better.. anyway, sometimes you read some story where a kid's parents are going to get divorced.. then they feel like the 'want to die' or something.. is that right? somehow.. i never felt that way. maybe it's because my parents were always arguing, so i was somewhat relieved that it would be over... i dunno. i forgot.. it was a long time ago. (in case you're wondering, i live with my father. my mother is.. sometimes..... a bit bitchy... sorry that i have to say this, but that's how i feel)  so, you guys think, if your parents got divorced, how would you feel?

       so.. anybody ever thought about what you're gonna study in college/ university? (frankly, i don't know the difference.. i think some people go to college then university.. is it?) do you ever think, what's to become of you? will you be able to cope with the college/ university work? Or will you fail horribly and get stuck with some idiotic 9-to-5 job..  i think i wanna study Psychology or Marketing, not very sure.. originally was marketing, coz.. i dunno why... then i just suddenly got interseted in Psychology.. now i'm thinking more about Psychology.. not sure which field of Psychology yet, but i think Behavioural Psychology would be interesting.. learn what makes people act the way they do..   as for people who are already in college/ in university/ working.. (though i don't think there are any..) Good Luck!

       so... it's day what of Olympics now? day 8? 9? ahh.. right.. day nine.. except for ppl in a different time zone maybe..  my favourite sport [to watch]-swimming- is now over! gone! kaput! and i DIDN'T get to watch the last day of it! why? you may ask? because i have a #^%&*!@ family! [no i didnt swear aloud, just typed those stuff, but i do feel freakin' angry..] anyway... the bottom line is.. it's all my father's fault.  so.. about Olympics..who're your favourites?   as i said.. i like to watch swimming.. i absolutely love U.S.A's  Michael Phelps , Australia's  Ian Thorpe  &amp; Hungary's  Laszlo Cseh .. as for female.. Australia's  Jodie Henry  &amp; Netherlands'  Inge de Bruijn ...   i also like to watch gymanstics... but... no favourites..    basketball... i love basketball... but... no favourites either.. i'm a   Vince Carter   fan, but he isn't in the U.S. Dream Team ...   i also like diving.. but no favourites (again!). the stupid China men's team (forgot which category) they had one gold guaranteed then they blew it on the last dive.. one of them got an "Incomplete Dive"... stupid nutter... being chinese i can't help hoping china will get as many as possible..  Equestrian... recently i seem to be interested in horses...i thought equestrian would be nice to watch, right? wrong! the one jumping over fences is alright.. but the one where the horse walks around in a funny manner on some field is boring! sorry, i know the way i explain is messy.. but... dunno what are the categories called.. so...    so.. what's your flava ['04 Athens Olympics]?
