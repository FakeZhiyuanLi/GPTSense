      S went to New York on personal business on Tuesday night and though he emphatically promised to call Wed morning to say he arrived safely, there was not a call until Thursday night. That means he missed the opportunity to wish me a Happy Divorce (WA and OR residents -  urlLink these people rock .) I understood that he was busy, but it was the day we had been looking forward to the entire time of our togetherness. I was already disappointed that he was to be out of town for the big day, so the fact that he didn't call me really burned me. So when I was at Green Lake (do I go anywhere else?) on Wednesday night (DDay), I was pretty excited when a hot rollerblader approached me while I sat on a bench retying my trainers. He said he was new in the area and asked if I would like to have a drink with him, perhaps show him around the town. That was pretty lame- he found Green Lake didn't he? I respectfully turned him down - said that my boyfriend probably wouldn't like that, but got a pretty nice boost to my ego from the whole experience. So when S called me late last night (Thurs) we talked for a while before he finally said:   "So your divorce is final isn't it?"   "Mm hmm."   "That means you are a free woman, doesn't it?  I better get home before some man tries to snap you up."   "Actually some guy tried to pick me up last night."  Silence.   "Where were you?"   "Green Lake - he was a rollerblader."  Silence.   "I am a jealous man, you know."   "I know - I respectfully declined, of course."  "If you have a thing for rollerbladers I can get a nice pair of spandex - bright green ones, and I can wear the helmet and wrist guards to bed."  I told him he was so silly and to just get his ass home. I don't know why I got so much satisfaction about creating that twinge of jealousy. Perhaps I was put off by the fact that it took him so long to call me. Perhaps it was a part of me that wanted him to know that if he doesn't shape up I have other options.  But I don't want other options- I only want S.

      It's final today - I am officially a divorcee - Lucky me! I have had four people including X excluding S call me and congratulate me on my divorce. It's nice but really depressing that so far more people have called me today about that than called me on my birthday. I guess people are just genuinely happy for me that I have made it to Splitsville. How sad is it when you tell people you are getting a divorce and their first words are I don't see why you married him in the first place. He was always... Or I saw better things for you... You were meant for the catwalk not that, that... It's about time... why did you ever marry him... I never saw you two as a match... I told you you were too young... And so on. I mean I know I made a mistake - hence the divorce. So rubbing it in - really not that necessary.

      Yesterday was another beautiful day in Seattle. As I have said - how typical - sweltering 100 degrees Saturday, overcast and frigid Sunday and a beautifully perfect sunny 80 degree Monday. So after work I headed to Green Lake. This time I was walked around the lake sans Discman mais avec mon frere and his live-in girlfriend. They have become the shoulders I lean on in this time of transition. I can talk to them about anything, although my brother pushes his fingers into his ears and goes LA LA LA loudly anytime I get remotely near talking about anything close to sex - understandable since I wouldn't want to hear him talk about it either. But it is nice to have a couple to confide in about anything. My other friends (read: my conservative Baptist pals from the South) were shocked and dismayed at the news of my impending divorce and even more amazed at my rapid leap into the arms of another man such that the nature of our friendships has been irreparably altered.  The friends X and I shared here in Seattle were all his friends and their wives from long before we met, so with the split he inherited the friends leaving me with a very small social circle consisting of family and S (boyfriend). Yes, the urge to inhale large doses of Ben and Jerry's does creep up on me on those evenings when X has Bubba and S and family are unavailable leaving me with a night to entertain myself by myself, but I am happy and have come to cherish my evenings alone - typically I spend hours playing the piano annoying my neighbors as I stumble through Moonlight Sonata or The Swan. Being self-taught leaves me far from Carnegie Hall-ready and I am sure a source of many an ear plug purchase, but it fulfills me. It was a life-long dream to own and play the piano, and there has been nothing better than realizing that dream.  But I digress....So we were walking around Green Lake in my typical counter-clockwise fashion and a couple of very attractive men went by on roller blades. I all of the sudden found myself wondering what it would be like to ask out or be asked out by one of them (it wasn't that I was interested just curious). I asked my co-walkers if they had ever tried to pick up a perfect stranger. Both admitted to the negative and inquired if I had either tried to pick up or had an attempted pick up by a stranger. I was about to say no but I remembered an occasion from a few years ago.  I said "Well, there was this one time that I was working at Crab Co (local restaurant) as a hostess and a very handsome man came in. He gave me his takeout order. When I returned with his food, he paid, leaving a sizeable tip  - and his business car. He said 'I think you are just absolutely beautiful and I would love to take you out some time. Here is my card, give me a call sometime.'  From his card, he was an investment banker and, by the looks of his suit and car, a very successful one too.  B (my brother) said "Did you ever call him?"'  "No," I said, "he was just too short for me."  K (his girlfriend) said, "What's wrong with that?"  I said, "I just had and have a standard that a guy has to be taller. The guy is supposed to be taller. I need to be able to wear high heels and still be shorter and at 5' 10" that is a tall (no pun intended) order." And just as I uttered those words I noticed the man walking in front of us, close enough to hear all I was saying. He was short, around 5' 5". He looked back at me to see who was so unacceptable of the shorter man and perhaps to see how tall I was. He smiled at me and shook his head. Immediately I felt mortified.  He said, "geez, no wonder-I'll never find anybody."  I tried to apologize, but the foot was firmly stuffed in my mouth, so I dug my grave a little deeper by trying to illustrate how it would never work by bending my knees until I was shorter than he. I was almost completely kneeling down - it wasn't my finest moment and probably did nothing to make the poor guy feel any better. He was cute and young too, just short, and to make matters worse, K is shorter than he and B is 6'5"(another short girl snapped up by a tall guy and a tall guy hogged by a short girl - disgusting to all of the short guys and tall girls who find such mismatches mortifying and unfair to the proper balance of the circle of life). I decided to speed up my walk a little bit and take my red cheeks with me and hope that the poor guy finds love - and soon.

       Tomorrow, tomorrow.  I love you tomorrow.  You're only a day away!        Yes folks, tomorrow marks the day - Divorce Final Day. Tomorrow some judge in some courtroom is going to put an end to my marriage. If I feel great today, tomorrow I am sure that I will feel even better - relieved, excited, weightless, on top of the world. Or maybe I won't feel any different. Maybe it will feel the same way as turning 25 did. I already feel like I am divorced and have felt that way since I made him pack his bags, but at the same time tomorrow marks the day when the strings are officially cut. He can no longer call me his wife without putting an X in front of it, and that is wonderful in and of itself.     No regrets here, though I am jealous that my boyfriend (I hate, hate, hate that word) is working hard so that when his divorce is final, he will never have to see or hear from the WWN (wicked witch of the north [my affectionate name for his X]) again. Unfortunately I am bound to my X by a child. Now I understand how things can turn ugly with custody battles and the like. When you divorce someone it is because you no longer want to be with them and in some cases you never want to see them again. When you have a child you have to see X and talk to X, because there will always be something to deal with. Some days I just want to take my daughter and flee to Europe.  But my daughter is my first priority and taking a daughter from a father who has caused no harm would be the worst possible thing I could do. All I am saying is that I can relate to the desire to do something of that nature, but you can relax, I would never do something that nutso no matter how tempting.     So even though the divorce is almost final and that provides a freedom much anticipated, I will always be bound by the ties of parenthood to X.     So I made my flight. You can figure out for yourself what made it narcissistic. I am ready to come in for a landing. My wings are clipped and I have gone as far as I can go. I have found the man of my dreams and though I will walk through the rest of my life and any subsequent relationships with the Ghost of Husband Past tied to my ankle, tomorrow marks an ending and a beginning - a new chapter (apt description no matter how hackneyed). The first half of my twenties have been so eventful - a wedding, 2 cross-country moves, graduation from college, birth of a child, a divorce, etc., etc. I have married, had a child (and no the child wasn't the reason for the marriage - she was born a year and a half into it) and divorced before most of my high school and college buddies have even thought about getting engaged. (I guess that is why so many wise people advise against young people marrying). I can't imagine what the next 5 years will bring but I am looking forward to them and whatever life changing events that come my way. I look forward to getting married again, but it scares me that I will have the same result. I don't want to be a serial marry-er a la J Lo or Ross (from Friends). But to marry once at 21 and then again at 25 (I hope)... Could I entering some weird cycle?

      A heat wave in Seattle - 100 degrees of miserable miserableness.  Saturday was one of those days when you envy the Southerners that, even though they endure 90 degree weather and 99 percent humidity, are blessed with air conditioning in every home, and for the most part it is central air, so there is no looking at those ugly AC window boxes that enjoy stupendous sales here  over weekends like the last.   It was too hot to even go to the lake and swim.  But alas, sans AC most homes were stifling with no respite in sight, so I decided to avoid both my house and outdoors by heading to my local grocer's freezer section.  Aaah, sweet relief - and it was even a little too cold - dressed in a tank and shorts, I left frozen to the core and even enjoyed the heat of the sun when I stepped back outside, but that ended the second I got back in my SUV, which was a regular sauna.  I made it through the day somehow, though and that night I slept on the floor in my living room by the open screen door because it was the only semi-cool place in the house.  When I woke the next morning I decided to make use of the hot day and this time go swimming - why not endure the heat and car ride for some splashing fun?  I got myself dressed in my bikini, board shorts and tank and dressed Bubba, (a nickname for my 2.5 y/o daughter [yes a product of unhappy marriage- yes one of many contributors to soap opera current state of life, which I've touched upon and may expand on later])  in her suit and terry cover-up, slathered us with sunscreen, gathered snacks, towels and a magazine pour moi.  I made sure Bubba went potty and loaded myself up and went outside only to discover that it was overcast and frigid.      Typical.

      Yesterday was a beautiful day in Seattle – the kind of day that makes people forget about the 360 cloudy days of the year and remember why they moved here in the first place. The kind of day that you can’t experience in any other city in the country – okay maybe I am biased- the mountains were out (even on some sunny days the mountains can remain hidden in a far off haze), Mount Rainier was unfettered and the Seattle skyscrapers and the Space Needle all made for the picture perfect day – especially for the tourists. So because it was such a beautiful day I, and hundreds of other Seattleites descended upon Seattle’s Green Lake, a pond really, at three miles in diameter. People come to walk, jog, run, bike, roller blade, or skateboard around the lake for exercise, conversation, or just to enjoy the day. There are soccer players, volley ball enthusiasts, basket ballers, filled tennis courts and even a little rapier academy that sets up on nice days. There are families galore picnicking, playing Frisbee or catch, enjoying the wading pool or even fishing. I was just there to exercise via speed walking (not nerdily, just at a brisk pace) as I listened to the music provided by my apparently obsolete Discman (everyone is carrying the ultra-hip iPod now) and people-watch of course. I love to see the people that come out on a lovely day to walk around Green Lake. It is more varied than your average cloudy, drizzly day, when the park is populated by hard-core sporties (one of which I will be someday, I just know it). So I embarked on my walk – I always go clock-wise around the lake because the people on wheels all have to go counter-clockwise, so by going the opposite, I have double the people to see face on. I set myself a nice pace and began to look around me at the people I passed or approached. I would smile at the cute little puppies, ugly dogs and old people, I would pretend that I didn’t see the hot guys jogging sans shirt (but try not to appear snobbish by maintaining a half-smile), I would try to check out other girls’ bodies as I walked by to compare mine to theirs (it is amazing how much more eager I was to check them out than I was the guys –granted I do have an incredibly gorgeous boyfriend already, so why check any others out because they won’t compare – but I guess I wanted to see if her stomach was flatter than mine, her hips more shapely, I already know that her boobs are bigger, so I don’t even bother with those). I felt almost like a man trying to gawk without gawking. I felt the girls looking at me in the same way I looked at them and realized that we were all scrutinizing each other. Here we are trying to get in shape for ourselves and we are all sucking in our stomachs so the next girl will be jealous. I think that maybe girls are a lot harsher critics when it comes to bodies than guys will ever be and it is not that I am critiquing their bodies but rather making a comparison with mine when she is in better shape than I am because I want to have a six pack and I want my calf muscles to ripple when I jog (yeah right). But I digress, I wasn’t just checking out the girls, I was admiring the babies in strollers, the old men and their old wives, the young studs with their girlfriends, the couples linked arm-in-arm so obviously in love walking at a snail’s pace as they gaze into each other’s eyes and coo lovingly at each other (these were my favorite people because that was me and S just a few days ago).  So as I progressed I felt utterly content...that is until a bug flew in my eye. I could feel it in there and wanted to throw up. I pulled to the side and tried as hard as I could to get it out – the acrylics were no help. I couldn’t get it, so I resumed walking with the knowledge that I had a bug in my eye – a phrase that kept repeating over and over in my head. My eyes were tearing, my face distorted and I was no longer getting the looks of approval from the men that I encountered on bike or roller blade but rather of avoidance. They would glance then look away quickly. But I didn’t care about that, embarrassment was nothing compared to the most disgusting feeling (well having a roach crawl across my face in the middle of the night it, but that is a different story) of having a bug in my eye, so I sped up to a jog and made it to one of the conveniently placed restrooms and prayed there would be a mirror...there was! I rushed over and pushed my eye up close to it and pulled the bottom lid down, and there he was tucked neatly down in the bottom corner of my lid. I shuddered as I pried him out knowing that my early attempts to remove him were responsible for lodging him so deeply in my eye socket.  So trauma over, I resumed my walk. I now walked with my head tilted down slightly hoping that the brim of my hat would prevent any other such invasions of self and I tried to calculate the odds of such a thing happening again. I tried to figure out the number of gnats (millions), adding in my height (5’ 10”), rate of speed (10-15 minute mile) and thanked God I didn’t try to be a mathematician (there is a reason that word sound so close to magician) cause all those numbers meant nothing to me when added together. So I just decided that I had never had a bug in my eye before when walking around Green Lake, so maybe this experience would last me for a few more years and concentrated on my people watching and walking again. I found myself passing a woman who was walking at the same rate as I was but the length of my legs allowed me to cover a greater distance in the same amount of time, and I have tucked her into the back of my mind with all the other people that I pass had she not sped up her walk into a sort of walk/jog combo and passed me. I was in no mood to compete but part of me wondered if she was. I forgot about her for the moment as a young guy jogging through the grass with a puppy who was only a few weeks old (no more than 12) distracted me. It was such an adorable site because the puppy followed his master so adoringly, but the puppy was of the killer dog variety (which I despise, why not have a nice golden retriever if you want a big dog) so I lost myself in the vision of the dog biting some child’s arm off in a couple of years and the cuteness of the scene was lost on me as I found myself passing that woman for a second time.  She seemed to speed up in attempt to thwart my passing her as she looked back out of the corner of her eye at me, but I passed her anyway. Then a few minutes later she super speed-walked past me (nerdily) and then I passed her and she passed me and I was getting so fed up with that game that I was glad when my walk was over. I never once changed my pace, but the fact that she seemed so determined to stay in front of me was infuriating and that she wore overly-tight spandex that I was more than glad to leave behind on my first passing just didn’t help matters much.

      I know now that some things are just better to wait for.  I don't want to stress out about a proposal and when it is going to occur.  I just know that if I have some idea when it is coming, the element of surprise will disappear and we won't have the magical she's crying so hard she can't say yes moment.  Well I don't think that would happen - I'm not the melodramatic type, but at the same time, since I am expecting a proposal I won't have one of those shocked responses that women who have been waiting forever project.  I just will be very, very happy, but since it is out of the blue I won't be going out of my mind.  So I don't mind waiting. If we just stop talking about it, and I stop thinking about it, perhaps we can approximate a moment experienced by the unsuspecting.

       Today returning from an errand, I entered my work’s office building and saw a man about to come out of one of the other offices that share our building. I watched him go to the door, then pause, look down at the magazines sitting on a nearby table and select one.  Please don’t follow me , I thought to myself. But he did, and the unfortunate thing and reason for my hope is that the only place for him to be going, if he followed me, was the bathroom- we are the only other office in that direction. So as I got to our door, I did a little half-turn (why? Morbid curiosity, I suppose) and saw him entering the bathroom with said magazine folded under his arm.   I couldn't help but laugh as I walked in.  I wanted to tell co-workers but feared that the humor in the idea of a man reading a magazine in a public restroom stall would be lost on them. Maybe I am the only one who doesn't understand it.  Will someone please explain to me, who in his right mind would find the idea of reading in a public restroom pleasing? Hello! I just want to get in, do my business and move on to other things, but he seemed like he was ready to settle in there and maybe have a siesta if the mood struck. I know that people all over the country enjoy reading while on the “throne,” but I was not aware of those that do so publicly. Now I will admit to reading All in a Day’s Work from an 8 year old issue of that Reader’s Digest that’s on the back of everyone’s toilet now and again, but I will only do so in the comfort of a home, where there is no possibility of other people coming in to do their business at the same time. I don’t know why I pick up that magazine, sometimes the urge just hits me. But the idea of just hanging out in a stall at work reading that same article seems a bit absurd.  I don’t know about you, but I don’t have an appreciation for doing my business with other people around and I certainly don’t enjoy serving as their audience (if only from an auditory perspective), so why would I want to elongate the process?   Why is it that people feel the need to read in the bathroom in the first place? Is it really an activity that necessitates outside entertainment? My little brother used to spend hours reading his books in there. My mom would take the Sunday papers with her. What about number two makes people desire mental stimulation? And why can’t it wait for us to be done. Why do people linger? Really, why hang out?   I would love to know what people get from the "reading on the toilet" experience.

      I am the monkey in the middle.  Not a good place to be.  I am the monkey in the middle.  Won't someone come rescue me?    He said, she said, they said = trouble.      R said something to S about something that X said about J and X having S trust issues.  R warned S not to make trouble and tell X et al that news came from R because she was sworn to secrecy but opened big mouth anyway.  So S went to X and J and tried to make them believe that some random person called him about these issues.  X especially does not believe cockamamie story and instead suspects R.  R is the only likely suspect- the only one who could say anything - the only one with the information.  R lies to X and denies whole thing (usually R is the most trustworthy of people and never lies, but in this circumstance she has to, even though she knows that chances of being believed are slim).  Both X and J are upset with R and S.  All involved think whole thing is juvenile, but friendships are damaged nonetheless.      R should have kept her trap shut    Lesson learned?

      So the ring was trapped in the jeweler's safe.  No one could get it out, and the jeweler disappeared (he's gone for the rest of the week).  Or so the man said that was supposed to be doing the proposing.  Besides, he said, you didn't want me to do it on your birthday anyway and have that day have two meanings.  There are plenty of other days in the year that need a special meaning, and you wouldn't want to wear the ring anyway since you are still married.    Me thinks the man doth protest too much.  What's the deal?  It wasn't me that brought it up.  He is the one that told me that my birthday present was something valuable and beautiful and recently arrived from his valuables in London in need of a good cleaning. So I put two and two together and decided that it was an antique ring with which he would propose to me on my birthday.  So why tell me that stuff about not wanting to be proposed to on my birthday?  Was he just trying to make me feel better because I had no birthday present at all now?  Anybody up for a little jeweler hunt?  How dare he ruin my proposal...

      I just celebrated with my co-workers - they went all out, beer, wine, chips, dips, cheese and cheesecake, usually the birthday person just gets a cake. Maybe they feel guilty for all of the phone calls they pass along to me that they don't want to make themselves - such as the one to the CEO of a company to make sure that it is in fact his direct line (what was I supposed to say - uh is this you, k just checking). It must be nice to be able to pass stuff off to the little guy. I am the end of the line. I don't get to pass off the annoying, backbone testing chores to some poor, underworked, bored administrative assistant who resents that the only work passed her way is the stupid stuff that no one else wants to do because that poor soul is me.  I have never had a job on my birthday before. I went to school - had summers off, had a baby and didn't work till she turned one, then got fired in June and didn't work till last September. I have never even worked through a summer before, so you can gather that I have never had a job for more than a year. This will be my first - if I can stick it out - but argh! the boredom is killing me. Hence the blog. I have been reading them for months, figured I like to write meaningless so and so like the best of them, and have forty hours a week to burn through so why not?  So needless to say, this was my first daytime co-worker birthday party. It was great. I stuffed myself on cheesecake and Minute Maid Lemonade while listening to shopper insight talk (I work for a marketing research firm) and frequent flyer perk conversations. I wasn't much of a contributor. It is so awkward to sit in a room with all of those people and try to be social. I am the Honey-do member of the team, so I don't get to hang around with them too much during the day - I am relegated to my post, whereas the rest of them wander freely, stopping by his or her desk for a little chat about the baby or the hockey game. I just get to see them as they go to and come back from the bathroom - and that just isn't a chatty time for most people.

      Since when did pampering yourself become sheer torture?  I know that some routes to beauty are supposed to be painful – waxing, plucking, facelifts – but a manicure?  Since when is getting your nails done supposed to involve an hour of torment?  Perhaps doing so in one of those strip mall shanties is just asking for it.  I liken my experience to going to the dentist after not flossing for a really long time.  The hygienist gets to dig at my gums with a sharp metal thing scraping away at my teeth in theory, but in reality more just torturing me.  You would think they would try to avoid the gums, but no, they just poke that metal thing right down there and jab away – torture.  But it is also torture that I have come to expect from going to the dentist.  If I flossed like I was supposed to, I wouldn’t have to endure such agony, so I deserve the punishment and the resultant abused and bleeding gums.  But I know that I didn’t do anything wrong to deserve the beating my fingers endured last night.  See the whole reason I went to get my nails done was to have a fun, little outing with my sister (we don’t do stuff just the two of us too often – it’s an oil and water thing) with the ulterior motive being that if I was going to be proposed to on my birthday, I wanted my nails to look good when I show off my ring, so naturally I wasn’t expecting pain and misery when I stepped into the little shop.  Now for those of you rich people who can afford going to one of those ritzy joints that offer you tea and soothing music, let me tell you this wasn't it.  We walk in and there are two people lounging in front of a television blaring a baseball game.  They look over at us, but make no move to welcome us or even stand up.  It wasn't until sister reminded them that we had an appointment that they made any movement to treat us like customers (so much for the "walk-ins welcome" sign. Fortunately for me, they didn’t speak English well, so any questions resulted in a nodded head from my side and a puzzled look from theirs.  Maybe the torture was a punishment for my inability to understand.  The woman who sat in front of me at the nail station looked innocent enough, but deep down inside she must have some traces of evil, or maybe not deep down inside because she seemed to take pleasure in the pain I was clearly experiencing, each time I winced or flinched and my hand jerked to escape the pain, she merely cooed and smiled to herself.  She first took a lovely sander with which to rough up the nails in readiness for the acrylics and was nice enough to rough up the cuticles for me as well.  Very kind lady.  That is where the dentist comparison comes in.  The scrapey thing is fine and dandy on the teeth, but watch out if they start going to town on the gums, and so goes with the sander- heaven help me and my poor nail beds.  So I flinched and winced my way through the sanding process and thought it was done as she attached the tips and applied that mystery stuff that turns into hard nails, but then came the buffing process.  She took a little 4-d rectangle that was covered in sandpaper and set about attacking each nail.  Oh the pain!  She banged down on each nail with this lovely devise of torture as if with a hammer while sweeping to the side to polish – so it was bang, sweep, bang sweep (kind of like a hard smash then drag the nail to the side - try it on your nails a couple of times- push down really hard on your nail and then push it to the side and imagine that happening again and again without reprieve for your already tortured nails) in rapid succession again and again on each nail.  It seems like it would never end.  It wasn’t even so much this new pain of the bang and sweep that bothered me, but the fact that it accompanied the old pain from the sander, because she was nice enough to include my cuticles in the bang and sweep process – sandpapering away at the raw sores that I had hoped were to be left alone for the rest of the evening.  When the torture was over – after another go with the electric sander, which this time wore the cloth buffer (didn’t make it any less painful), I paid up and gave the lady a five dollar tip.  What was I thinking?  I have never paid for pain in my life, and here I give a 20% tip to this, this spawn of Satan.  My fingers were swollen from the beat and sweep, my cuticles were bleeding, and to top it off there were bubbles and a speck of dirt in the acrylics – just lovely, and here I go and give 5 of my hard-earned dollars away.  I began to think that maybe that was all a part of her plan.  Torture, instill fear, reap money from the weak – as easy as 1, 2, 3.

      Did you ever get the suspicion that your life has taken on a certain soap opera quality? Okay so I haven’t just discovered that my husband was actually my long lost twin or anything freakish like that, but for a girl who thought her life was somewhat normal, the truth is creeping in – Okay well I never really believed that my life was normal. I just wanted other people to think it was. And hey, if I can convince people that I had a happy childhood or a great marriage, then really I should be President of the United States of America, or at least work for him (or someday her?) [isn’t that what politicians and their trusty sidekicks do – take the bad and twist it so "hey everything looks great doesn’t it?"]. I am great at giving the impression that things are a lot rosier than the darkness and despair (read: bad dad and bad sex {don’t combine the two, people!}) that truly lingers (oh c’mon it wasn’t that bad). Read on.   Tomorrow is my 25th birthday. I’m sure I won’t feel different, does anyone ever? I am hoping to be proposed to tomorrow, and the funny thing is – I am still married and feeling a little like J-Lo or more appropriately her other half oh I can never remember his name – he always reminds me of a rat for some reason – he is so skinny and little. I just don’t get that he has sex appeal, he certainly doesn't appeal to me. Anyway he had to wait for his divorce to be final before he could get married again – he even hurried it up by traipsing down to some Caribbean courthouse, and here I am the conservative Baptist who doesn’t believe that divorce is right (but wait there’s more!) tapping her watch in anticipation of an approaching end of marriage decree from some judge who must get a little burned out ending so many marriages. Or maybe you don’t get burned out, maybe the knowledge that you are ending someone’s misery is satisfying. I can’t decide.   I am convinced that if I were the/a divorce-signing judge I would have the hardest time not turning into the GOSSIP QUEEN of the UNIVERSE. Take that scandal with Jeri Ryan and her senator wannabe husband (why can’t I remember men’s names today?. I'm sitting there in my mahogany clad office reading reports of a scumball dragging his wife to odd sex clubs and wanting public intercourse and all that, how could I keep it quiet? Sealed, my ass. I’d be taking it down to Access Hollywood. Reason #1 that Roxy is not a judge (maybe I will explore that later because I am certainly judgmental, so you’d think that there might be a few reasons why I should become a judge (or is that just stupid? No need, I already know)).   Not everyday will be like today.

      My boss (a 59 year-old man) just walked up to me and asked him if I thought he looked like Eminem today.  I looked him up and down taking in his baggy blue sweater and loose-fitting dark blue jeans and white sneakers and said "that's funny."   He said, "What's funny?  I'm hip."  That's when I realized he was serious.

       Part One: Piquing His Curiousity  Friday morning I called S and left a message. I had a proposition for him. Late that afternoon he called me and asked me about the proposition. He seemed very curious, which was my intent in leaving such a vague message. I told him that I didn't want to talk about it on the phone. He was sick, so I said that I understood if he couldn't see me that night - he interrupted and said that he would try to meet up with me and would call me later that evening. We said goodbyes, but neither of us said "I love you." The absence of the phrase hung ominously in my mind like a thundercloud over a tender crop of nearly ripened cherries. It bothered me, and I wondered what it meant. I knew that I still loved him, but I didn't want to say it if he wasn't going to say it. My mind went into overtime.  In order to escape my brain, I plunged into traffic to go to K's house because I knew that the drive would distract me. Because I have been spending so much time there lately, I am now a proud new owner of a key to K and B's home. I let myself into the empty apartment and lay down on the couch and vegged out on cable tv (it is a luxury I myself do not possess) while I waited for K to come home. I thought about how I felt exactly a week before - like the end was absolute with S, like I would never hear from him again, and now here I was trying to see him again despite Tuesday's Decision.  The rest of the evening was spent eating Taco Bell (I had my first Gordito - not too bad) and watching the Olympics Opening Ceremony - I must say that I was very impressed. The bit with Eros (?) flying over the parade of statue-like people was breathtaking. I wish I had Tivo so I could watch it again. It is amazing all that went into the production for one little night.  At 9:30 I gave up on seeing S and decided to go home. He called me while I was in the car - and of course he wasn't coming. He asked me again about the proposition, and I again told him that I wanted to talk about it in person. He said that he would try to see me Saturday morning - I didn't want to, because I didn't want to compromise on my decision not to see him on days when I have Bubba, but I didn't tell him that. I just said that I was busy until the afternoon, and then we hung up. Again no "I love you"s. It continued to bother me. Were neither of us really in love? I had paused and given him time to say I love you, but he didn't. I didn't say it because I didn't want to hear I love you too. So I didn't hear anything at all.  I got home, got ready for bed, and put the Olympics Ceremony on (geez it was long). I continued to think about the I love you thing until I broke down and called him. He didn't pick up (big surprise), so I left a message saying that I had a question for him.  I wanted to ask him if he loved me, but then I wondered what would be the point of that.  He would just say yes; what else would he say?  It would just be non-conclusive - I wouldn't feel any better.   Leaving the message did nothing to calm my mind,  I continued to think about it, so I finally called him again.  I said, in my message (were actually thinking he would pick up?), that I really needed to talk to him.  Why do I let him get into my head?  I must be going insane.   Part Two: To Meet or Not to Meet  Saturday morning he called me, just as I was settling into the chair at the salon (I was getting some bold highlights).  K was with me, so I decided not to pick up (why I am playing these games I will never know).  I listened to the message and he said that he was wondering about my question, still curious about the proposition,  sorry that he missed my calls - he had fallen asleep early due to being drugged up on Sudafed- and looking forward to seeing me that afternoon.  I let K listen to it.  She said that he didn't sound very nice.  I rolled my eyes - he sounded fine to me.  She didn't think that I should meet up with him.  I wasn't so sure.  I really needed to talk to him, but I had Bubba, and I didn't want her to see him anymore until I was more sure about things with S.  I tried to call X - he had to go to a wedding.  My mom was on a singles hike.  I couldn't think of anyone else, and K wasn't volunteering.  I didn't want to ask her because I could tell that she didn't want to watch Bubba.  One, she nannies all week, so watching a kid on her day off isn't so ideal, and two, she didn't think that I should see him and compromise on my decision not to see him on days I have Bubba and besides he missed his opportunity the night before.  I didn't call him back.  I just got very glum.   Hours later, my hair done, we went to the grocery store to pick up some lunch.  On our way there, however, as I griped about wanting to meet with S, and tried calling people to watch her, K finally offered to watch Bubba.   I hadn't wanted her to volunteer, because I didn't think it was at the top of her list of fun ways to spend her Saturday, but after making sure that she was sure, I accepted her offer.  Then while at the grocery store S called and said that he would call me in an hour to meet up with me.  We went back to my place and ate our lunch, and Kristen left with Bubba right as the hour was up.  I hopped into the shower and beautified myself, but no call from S.  Two hours went by, and I finally called K and said that he could forget it.  I was just going to come over there to be with her and Bubba (who was still napping).   When I arrived we jumped on the computer and I looked at singles sites - how depressing.  While upstairs at the computer, we heard my phone ringing from my purse downstairs on the dining room table.  I sat there and let it ring until it stopped ringing.  He had let me wait long enough.  I was just going to tell him that I couldn't see him until Wednesday.  And then I realized that I should have picked up the phone to tell him that, so I bolted downstairs to listen to the voice mail.   There was no voice mail.  I looked at K - she said, "Just call him."   So I did.  And I arranged to meet him around the corner in twenty minutes.  (Why can't I resist the man?)   Part Three:  My Own Happy Ending   I was nervous as I approached him.  I knew that I looked good - I had spent long enough on myself, but it wasn't that.  When he hugged me though, as always, my fears disappeared.  Now I just needed to get my proposition out and find out what is going on in his head.   We walked towards Green Lake, and though he wanted to continue around the lake, I stressed the need to start off on a bench.  I couldn't walk and talk about this at the same time.  He seemed nervous, which made me feel good that I wasn't the only one.   "Okay," he said.  "What's going on in that mind of yours?"  "What's going on with us, S?  Things have been so weird since you got back from NY and I guess even the whole time you were gone.  I have felt so far away from you.  What do you want with us?  Where do you want this to go?  Are you ready for it to just fizzle out and end?  Do you want things to go as they have been going?  I just need to know where your head is before I can tell you where mine is."  "I certainly don't want this to end, R," he looked at me tenderly and then spoke the words I had been waiting forever, it seems, to hear, "I love you."  "You do?"   He nodded.  "Then,"  I poked him in the chest, "Why haven't you been saying it?"  "I have."  "No.  You haven't."  "I'm sorry,"  he said, head hung low.  "It's just that I have been feeling horrible lately - like an admonished school boy.  I have treated you so badly and was rightly scolded for it, and I guess that I sensed a certain distance from you.  I wasn't calling you regularly because I wanted this to blow over a little, and be sort of redeemed in your eyes.  You have been so doubtful and critical of me lately - and rightly so - but it has been difficult to endure.  I have never doubted my love for you, but I could sense you were doubting yours for me, and I needed to think about the rut I have dug this relationship into. "  "Well, that is understandable and has a lot to do with why I wanted to talk to you.  I really think that we need to change the nature of our relationship.  I think our biggest problem is that we have moved far too fast, and as a result I have come to expect far too much from you - more than you can afford to give right now with all that you are going through. I think we just need to take a few steps back and stop talking about marriage, until you actually propose, moving in together, until your bags are packed, etc., etc.  I want to simplify us - to go back to just having fun.  I want to lighten things up a lot."  With this I paused, I figured that I had said enough to get my point across.  "That is a great idea,"  he said.  "I wish that I had thought of it."  And then he looked at me strangely.   "Do you want this to be a casual relationship?"  "I suppose so,"  I shrugged.  "Will you be seeing other people?"  "I might,"  I didn't want to see other people, but the ways things had been going, I was ready to throw in the hat in exchange for a nice normal relationship.  He seemed dismayed by my answer,  "I love  you ,"  I said.  "I don't want to see anyone else, but the way things have been going.... Besides I don't mean that by casual, what I mean is that I just want a lighter relationship.  I don't want to be upset with you all of the time.  Do you think I enjoy calling you up swearing and angry?  I don't like to run a relationship like that.   My aim is to remove the stress and strain we have been feeling, so we can go back to just have a good time."   He was visibly relieved.  We kissed, stood up and had a lovely walk around the lake - we were one of those slow-walking lovebird couples that I mentioned in a previous post.  At the end of the walk he said, " Now I know that I have no right to say this to you, and I don't want to sound possessive, but I really don't want you to see other people.  I love you and only you, and I want you and only you.  I know that I am technically still married, but I have no other women in my life."  I kissed him and assured him that I loved him and that I would keep him informed should a suitor step into the ring.  Back at K's house, after I had said a lengthy goodbye at S's car,  I was happy, but emotionally exhausted.  I gathered up my stuff and Bubba and drove home completely at peace - all of my anguish was dissolved completely.   Postscript:  Completely Oblivious   But shortly after I got home I received a call from B.  I asked how he was doing, but he wasn't up for small talk.  "I am really disappointed in you.  You said that you were going to spend the day with K; she was really looking forward to it, and you promised not to pick up the phone and then you dump Bubba on her and ditch her for S, and then when he doesn't call you call her and again say you won't pick up the phone, but you ditch her again.  You made her feel like crap.   And aside from that I can't believe that you are letting S in your life.  He has treated you horribly, and I don't think you should be with him."  "Wow,"  I took a deep breath.  I was completely shocked and taken aback.  Not by what he said about my being with S - that was not a surprise at all.  The surprise would have been if he hadn't reacted that way.  In fact when S and I first began our walk toward the lake, he asked me if anyone was waiting around the corner to beat him up.  But I was completely surprised that K felt as she did.  I had not even been thinking.  I  had  ditched her, and I felt rotten.  I thought back to the event of the day and realized that I had been so self-absorbed that I didn't even see how my actions affected her.  What a dick I can be.  She eventually talked to me and I apologized and told her always to tell me when something bothers her and slap me if I even do that again.  I thanked her profusely for giving me the opportunity to sort things out  with S - it really had made a big difference.  She said that she could see that already too, just by the way I was when I returned.  We said goodnight and were, thankfully, on good turns again.  And I vow never again to risk a friendship in that way again.  Is there a girl version of "bros before hos?"

      I have always admired Rollerbladers. They seem to effortlessly glide around the lake as I huff and puff through my jog or brisk walk. I wanted to be them. I wanted to effortlessly glide around the lake. So one day as I was perusing eBay (my semi-new sick obsession) I decided to become one of them. I hightailed it to the Rollerblade auctions, placed my bid and had a nice, new, used pair of Rollerblades post haste. It wasn’t until yesterday, though, that I gathered the courage to use the things. I felt so nervous as I put them on, hoping they would fit right, hoping that all the time I spent on roller skates in middle school would translate into a current skill in Rollerblading, hoping that I wouldn’t fall and break my wrist because I wasn’t willing to spring for the proper safety gear until I knew for sure that I enjoy the whole Rollerblading experience.  My first challenge was to make it from my brother’s apartment building to Green Lake – two blocks and two busy streets lay between them. It being rush hour, my first humiliation was crossing the street. It seemed like I couldn’t remember how to launch off into a smooth stride. Instead I appeared to be walking across the street as fifty cars waited for me and of course I tripped right as I made it to the curb. I was able to drag myself out of the street and shakily regain my footing. I slowly pushed myself forward with one blade and then the next. I seemed to be getting the hang of it. I was so proud. I held my head up high and tried to channel all of the hot chic Rollerbladers I had ever seen in a movie. There must have been something wrong with the connection.  I arrived at Green Lake and plodded across the grass field that lay between the street and the paved path around the lake. I was getting excited. This was going to be fun. I was going to get some exercise, go around the lake a couple of times, and hey maybe even meet a cute blader. I quickly lost my enthusiasm. Once I got to the path, I realized that Rollerblading business isn’t as effortless as it appears. My second challenge was a mini-hill that I had never noticed while walking (of course I usually go clockwise around the lake against the Rollerbladers so it was downhill), but all of the sudden I felt like I had reached Mount Everest. I grunted and pushed and somehow managed to make it to the top. Winded and extremely exhausted, I looked back longingly at the grass field from which I had come, but I kept on. Soon my chest started to burn and my face started to pound. I didn’t understand it – I wasn’t even going fast. Every single other Rollerblader passed me, joggers passed me, and, saddest of all, speed walkers passed me. Try as I might, I couldn’t get myself into a smooth rhythm. About a quarter of a mile around I could take it no longer, I had to sit on a bench. I was so confused. Rollerblading looked so easy – besides I wasn’t that out of shape, this should have been a piece of cake. I watched more rollerbladers pass by and I squelched the desire to ask them to tell me what I was doing wrong – why, when my legs were going at the same speed as theirs was I incapable of achieving the same speed. I didn’t want to carry on. I was frustrated, depressed and extremely disappointed in myself – but rollerbladers can’t go back – they can only go forward on the path. I wanted to cry, but I stood up and onto the path and prepared to pass again all of the slow walkers. I didn’t want them to see me again – I looked ridiculous, but I had no choice, I couldn’t turn back. I didn’t even have my cell phone so calling my brother to rescue me was out of the question.  When I had gone 2 miles and after 5 more breaks, I could take it no longer. I sat down on the grass, removed the offenders and walked the final mile in my bare feet. I HATED those Rollerblades. I considered leaving them by a tree, hoping that by chance some girl with a size 10 foot would pick them up and take to the activity with far more gusto than had I, but I kept a hold on them. The worst part of the whole experience is that as I trudged through the cool grass all of my frustration with my rollerblades and with S combined to make me very emotional. I spent the entire walk choking back tears and just being utterly pathetic.  When I arrived at B’s house, I could no longer hold it in – after greeting B and K as they sat smoking in the garage, I excused myself to get some water and sobbed in the kitchen. I couldn’t understand what I was feeling at the time. I played it off as PMS to B and K when they asked about it, but it wasn’t that. I am beginning to think that the divorce, single momhood, and this whole S thing are all starting to take a serious toll on me.

      If you were able to plod all the way through to the end of The Last Six Days then you know that last night I was on top of the world - excited about my decision and ready to conquer the world and ignore all of S's phone calls for the next couple of days. This morning however, just as I was leaving the apartment ten minutes late, cell phone and purse in hand, S called. I stared at the phone in my hand. I watched it vibrate again and again and tried to urge myself to ignore the call, ignore the call, but just before it went to voice mail I picked it up.  R: Good Morning.  S: Hey baby, did you get any sleep?  R: No, Bubba decided to start the day at 3:30, my neighbors were outside swearing at each other at 5 am and someone wouldn't turn off their alarm. It was pretty bad.  S: You must be exhausted, poor thing. Anyway, I just called to tell you that last night was beautiful and I will talk to you later today.  And that was it. I answered the phone. I felt disgusted with myself. I called K as I loaded into the car; she was just as disappointed in me, of course. I told her I wouldn't answer the next call, but of course now there has been no next call.  And being the worrier that I am (plainly evidenced by many of my previous posts),  I now worry that if I continue in my resolve to ignore his calls, he won't call me ever.  It used to be that on a night like tonight if he hadn't called me like he said he would, I would have left at least one message, but I have not even tried to call him.  I am so proud about that.  But what if he doesn't call me tomorrow.  I am not going to call him.  The ball is in his court.  Why worry about something that isn't even an issue yet?  I spend too much time alone.

       The Call   Thursday – 8/5. I was settled into bed just beginning an episode of Sex in the City from the Complete Second Season DVD lent to me by K when I receive a call at 10:25 pm – it is S. My fears are confirmed. He is not coming home on Friday. It turns out that he misunderstood. His ticket wasn’t actually for Friday, rather for Sunday. I couldn’t believe my ears. Did he actually expect me to believe that crap? I couldn’t take it.  S: I am still going to try to change the ticket.  R: This is too much. You call me from the airport on Tuesday and say that you are going away to New York and will be back as early as Friday, but no later than Sunday, then you are coming home on Tuesday with your standby ticket, and then you are coming home Wednesday, then Friday and now Sunday?  S: Are you mocking me?  R: Am I mocking you? No I am not mocking you. I just don’t know how you expect me to believe this. You tell me that you have this web special ticket and you got another ticket for this absurdly cheap price and you are trying to get a ticket changed and 9 times out of 10 these tickets are unchangeable through the bargain sites. I deal with travel arrangements all of the time. I am just not sure how to believe what you are saying. Especially when you won’t give me your flight details.  S: What are you saying, R?  R: I’m not saying anything. I just don’t know how to believe all of these fantastical stories….  And from here on for the next few minutes I went off on him – pouring out all of the feeling that had pent up - until I noticed that he was no longer on the line. I freaked out. Had he hung up on me? If we were disconnected wouldn’t he have tried to call me? In the minutes that I had been going on and on with a one-sided barrage I would have thought that he would have tried through. I dialed him – nothing. It went straight to voice mail. My heart dropped. I left a message asking him what was going on. I called again. I left another message – I don’t remember what I said which isn’t a good sign. Then I called X. I don’t know why, but I did. He didn’t pick up the phone, so I left a message saying that I needed a friendly ear. I knew that he would understand, and he has been so nice lately. My next call was to B. He picked up – thank God for small wonders.  R: B, I have just been talking to S. He isn’t coming home like he said that he would. I confronted him with my disbelief and he hung up with me. I think it is over.  B: Are you okay?  It is amazing how three little words can trigger the floodgates. At that moment I realized that I wasn’t okay- I fell apart then, entirely and completely. He hung up on me because I said that I didn’t believe him. I believed with all of my heart that I would never talk to him again. I couldn’t believe that it would end this way and I began to sob. I told my brother that I wasn’t okay, but horrible in fact. He told me to get Bubba and come over. But I was in no shape to drive - I couldn’t even stop shaking. I was devastated. It was as if in the instant I realized that he hung up on me I received confirmation that he couldn’t deal with my suspicions, that I was right, and the easiest thing for him to do was to extricate himself from the situation and prevent my being able to speak with him any more. I felt betrayed and as I put the phone down my movements woke up the computer. My desktop background is a picture of S and I that was taken on my birthday. The sight of his and my smiling faces ripped at my heart. I stared at it for a moment as tears streamed down my face. I had given him so much of me and it was to end like this?  B had decided that he and K would come get me and Bubba and I would call in sick Friday and they would take care of me. While I waited for them to arrive, I cried, called S a couple more times (left one teary message saying that I was sorry and another stronger message saying that I was sure that I wouldn’t hear from him that night but that I hoped to the next morning), felt sorry for myself and then finally dragged myself up to pack a bag. I felt like an automaton as I walked around the apartment mindlessly pushing things into a bag, all the while shaking my head, whispering "no" repeatedly, and brushing the tears away.   The Longest Day   Friday 8/6. We arrived at B’s house a little after midnight. While I sat in the basement with K, B put Bubba to sleep in the spare bedroom. I told K the details of The Call and she tried to make me feel better. She reminded me that he had been having signal problems.  K: So maybe his phone just cut off.  R: Well he would have tried to call back then and the phone would have rung through at least.  K: You need to stop thinking the worst-case scenario.  R: There is no best-case scenario. He hung up on me because he didn’t like what I was saying. He never wants to talk to me again, and it is either because he can’t be with someone who mistrusts him or, and I am leaning this way, everything he has ever told me is a lie and I just got too close to knowing it for sure. I just can’t believe this will be the end though. It can’t end like this. It just can’t. I won’t let it. I know where WWN lives. I will go talk to her and find out the true story.  K: I will go with you, but R, he will call you. He loves you and won’t let it end like this. There is a reason.  My brother wasn’t so understanding.  That night after they went to bed, I lay on their couch with my phone in hand. I called him at 1:30 and 4:00 and 6:00. The calls always went straight to voice mail and I never left any. By the time my brother came downstairs later in the morning around 10, I had already called S 14 times since the disconnect. It was borderline obsessive, but I kept it to one call an hour after that, which was approximately 1% of the amount I wanted to call. I just needed to know when it would ring through. I could understand if he wanted to ignore my calls, but to keep his phone off for all this time and remain disconnected from the rest of the people who may need to speak to him seemed a little excessive to me.  K had gone to work at 7:20, but returned with her charges (2 girls 6 months younger than Bubba) at around 9am. After B went to work at 11, we took the girls to the library. It was unfortunately an extremely rainy, dreary day - apt for my mood, not so great for keeping toddlers occupied. I continued to call S again and again. I remained true to the one-hour rule, of which I was extremely proud. I had decided not to leave any messages as I knew that he would not be able to tell that I called.  Only a voice mail would be a true sign, and that was reassuring.  I spent the next few hours in a melancholy mood and eventually took Bubba over to my mom’s house. K and I were planning a trip up to WWN’s house, and I didn't want to drag my child along. I wasn’t going to knock on her door, just do a little watching. I wanted to see if perhaps he was actually home rather than in NY. I know that I sound psycho, but I wasn’t in my right mental state.  When K came home from work I asked her if she thought that I should leave a voice mail. She said no. I agreed and said that I should probably stop calling so much as I was driving myself crazy. She readily agreed and decided to go upstairs to order pizza. I sat down on the couch and looked at the phone still clutched in my hand. I shrugged, it had been almost an hour, one more time wouldn’t hurt, but I got voice mail again. Twenty minutes later, K and I decided to go to the garage so she could smoke a cigarette while waiting for the pizza man, but before we went down I asked her if I could use her phone to call S because I was curious if it would go through. I had used it while at the library because I was curious if he had somehow managed to block my number from going through. It went to voicemail then and that had lightened my spirit to some degree. So I just thought I would try with her phone. I dialed his number and then gasped. It was ringing! I couldn’t believe it! I was so nervous – what if he picked up? K said that she could feel my heart pounding across the room. It was funny because my heart  was  pounding out of my chest. I made her feel it. The call rang to voice mail. I didn’t leave a message, because I didn’t want him to connect that number to me. I decided to wait to call him for 20 minutes. I thought that it would be suspicious if I called on the tails of the unknown number.  We went to the basement and right when the pizza man arrived and just 2 minutes short of my 20-minute goal line my hand vibrated, or rather the phone that had become a permanent fixture in my hand vibrated. I turned it over to see the caller id – it was S! I just stared at the phone – unsure what to do. The moment I had waited for was here and I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was scared and nervous and angry and just managed to answer the phone before the call went to voicemail.  I went to the top floor leaving K in the living room with the pizzas. S asked how I was doing and I returned the favor. He apologized for the call last night. He said that his phone all of a sudden cut out and he tried frantically to call me again and again, but the phone said signal lost. He eventually gave up and went to bed, and had spent the bulk of the day on the phone with Sprint trying to retrieve his service. He had only just gotten it back and I was his first call after he retrieved his messages (so since the time between the snuck call while K ordered pizzas and the call on K’s phone minutes later, his service had been recovered and he must have been listening to messages when I called). I was embarrassed about my messages from the night before, but we both opted not to mention them at all. He explained the cheap price with his usual very interesting could-be-true explanations (see the thing about S is that every thing has an explanation and they are usually extremely different and unusual, but not totally unbelievable, it is just the fact that he gets the lion’s share of such different and unusual occurrences that it just makes it all a little unbelievable). So he went on and on about how much he loved me and couldn’t lose me and blah, blah, blah. I was just happy that he called me and figured that as long as I could see him again, I could wait to confront him again with my disbelief. Oh and if you are wondering – he hasn’t memorized my phone number yet and it is only accessible through his phone’s phonebook, but it just now occurred to me that his phone wasn’t off or broken, he just lacked service and if he had a phone to call Sprint, then he had a phone to call me, hmmmm.  Needless to say, K and I cancelled our voyage to WWN’s house and spent the rest of the evening pigging out on pizza, watching movies and playing Frisbee (to work off the pizza).   Too Much Wine   Saturday 8/7 – After a day of swimming, jogging, tanning, and fun, B, K, Bubba and I went over to my mom’s house for a nice steak dinner. I was starving and ate a ton of food. Right after my third extra large glass of red wine, S called. He had been doing this and that the whole day and was just now able to call me. He said he hadn’t been able to change his ticket – raise your hand if you are surprised. I said that I didn’t care as long as he wasn’t home any later than tomorrow. He said absolutely. He even gave me his flight info – complete with flight number. He spent much time getting the paper out of the wallet and crinkling it loudly before he gave me the info. He said that he was confident that he would get an earlier flight tomorrow, because it is easier to do it the day of (whatever). I hung up with him, and gulped down a final glass of wine.  Well apparently my lite-weight self can’t handle drinking four glasses of wine in under an hour. I was sloshed. B put Bubba to bed at my mom’s house and practically carried me to his truck. Both K and I had our vehicles and B had his, but neither K nor I were able to drive, so we got to leave them at my mom’s house. I felt horrible. I tried so hard to normalize – to not be drunk (I thought that I couldn’t possibly be like this after 4 glasses, it must be psychological, therefore I can just snap out of it). But I couldn’t snap out of it. I got really dizzy, and finally threw up just as they shoved a bucket in my face. I was really embarrassed, but thankful that they were so good to me. But how pathetic do I feel for getting drunk at my mom’s house?   Meeting the New Girl and Much Worse   Sunday 8/8 – B rushed off to work at 5 am leaving K and I carless, K phoneless (it was in her car), and me with an almost dead phone (my charger was in my truck). I awoke at 7 am still buzzed and in serious need of a toilet. I went upstairs to relieve myself and decided while I was up there I would hop on their computer and check out the flight number S gave me. My heart seized when the computer flashed in bold red letters that the flight number doesn’t exist. I sat at the desk staring at the screen. He had lied to me again. But didn’t he know that I would check it? Did he think I was stupid? I tried other airlines, and other than a flight to Bombay, the number didn’t mean anything. I went back downstairs and fell back into an uneasy sleep.  Our original plan was that we would just walk to my mom’s house to retrieve our cars, but the fact that my trainers were locked in the Durango and my only choice was flip flops, we opted to call X. It was his day with Bubba and he was on his way to pick her up from my mom’s anyway, so I called him and asked him to swing by and pick up K and I on his way. He decided to pick up the Durango on the way and when he arrived – who would happen to be in the front seat, but C, his new (in a line of 2) girl. I saw the first one, but never actually met her. X offered to introduce us, but frankly I was never interested. So here I was with the lovely situation of riding in the backseat of my own car with my ex and his girlfriend in the front.  She was nothing like me – short and chubby, with garishly died hair, multiple tattoos and piercings – pretty much the anti-R. Whatever makes him happy. He said that he is going for girls who like him as he is and are nice to him – I say good for him. So the ride to my mom’s house was awkward, but the period spent in my mom’s house was worse yet. She stood by the door watching me as I interacted with Bubba –kissing her, telling her I missed her, and that I would pick her up from daycare the next afternoon.  We were all together for about 15 minutes and that was more than enough for me. The fact that that woman would be around my daughter the whole day was disconcerting, but as long as X never shows her any affection I am fine. I am pretty confident that she will never be stepmom.  So after a busy day meant to keep my mind from worrying about whether he would actually be at the airport, I made my way home for the first time since Thursday night. I called S and left him a message saying that since I hadn’t heard otherwise from him, I was just going to assume that he was on a plane and I would be at the airport at the agreed upon time – 11:30 pm. I spent the next few hours cleaning my house, playing the piano (oh how I had missed it) and taking a shower and beautifying myself. I had just sat down on my bed to watch one episode of  Sex and the City  before I left for the airport, when my phone vibrated. It was 10:40 and it was S.  S: Hey baby, how are you? I just got in. I managed to get on earlier flight, and you are not going to believe this, but I accidentally called WWN and asked her to come get me. When I realized that it was she, it was too late. I couldn’t take it back without causing WWIII. So she is on her way her right now, and I am going to go home with her. I probably won’t be able to make it down there tonight, but…  R (screaming with anger): You have got to be kidding me! I am just about to leave to pick you up at the airport and the first call I get from you all day is to say that I won’t see you. WWN gets to see you and pick you up from the airport, and you are not even going to see me? I don’t think so. I have to see you. You have to see me. I will drive up to fucking WWN’s house, but I am not going to go without seeing you. You can’t do this to me. You have put me on an emotional roller coaster, turned me into a wreck, and now this. Why didn’t you call me after you called her to let me know what you had done? What is going on with you? I don’t even believe your story about calling her accidentally. You…  S: Don’t go there. Don’t go to that house. I will come to see you, or we can meet somewhere. I am sure this is hard for you. Don’t be upset. I am sorry. Can I call you as soon as I get there and we can make arrangements?  R (calmer): Are you going to turn off your phone and ignore me for the rest of the night?  S: No, because I know that you will go up there.  R: You better believe it; I can’t take this anymore. So you better see me.  S: Okay. I will call you.  So an hour later, I was in my car on my way to the halfway point between our houses. I was angry, more angry than I have ever been at someone I love. As I pulled into the deserted parking lot of the closed grocery store and parked next to his car, I avoided looking at him. I was nervous. It had been two weeks since I had last seen him, and so much had happened. I didn’t know what would be said, but I hoped that I would feel better.  He got out of the car and walked around to the passenger side, and as I watched him get into the car, all of the iciness in my heart melted away. He reached over and hugged me and I had to fight the tears from flowing down. It was an emotional overload. Seeing the man that I love so much, but who has fed me so many unproven stories (or should I just up and call them lies) and treated me in a way I honestly don’t deserve to be treated, confuses me. I kissed him and felt all of my desire for him bubbling to the surface, but I sat back and let him speak. And speak he did. He explained the call to WWN again. He had some story about deleted entries making her name down the same times as mine used to be. A cockamamie explanation because the way he explained it, my number would have been higher up. I figured I knew why he made it up, but I let it pass, and though I didn’t confront him with it, my suspicions were pretty much confirmed last night.  I asked him about how he said that he would move in the day after he returned from his trip. He was confident that the move would occur the following day. I told him that he now needed to show me that he is a man of his word. He can’t just tell me things anymore. He has to show me. He said that he loves me. I told him to show me.  We left off in good terms, and we drove off – he to the north and I to the south – I was exhausted, but happy that I had forced the meeting. To be honest, I wasn’t really gung ho to drive up there, but I had to see that he was actually in town and the WWN pick-up an excuse to delay his return even longer.   An Odd Coincidence   Monday 8/9 – I left work at around 11 am to run some errands. I had just called K and was dishing about the events of the night before. I pulled out of my office park and up to the stoplight when a familiar car turned onto the street ahead of me.  R: I think I see S!  K: Are you serious?  R: Yeah, I don’t know the license number, but it is the same model! This is so weird. He lives 25 miles away and I pull out of my office park on an unscheduled errand just as he is getting off the freeway. Weird!  The light changed and I floored the gas to catch up to the white BMW. I was almost positive it was S. He pulled into the left hand turning lane and I pulled in behind him – it really was the way I had to go. I could see his face in the side mirror – his hand was obscuring his face. WWN was in the passenger seat, and they were both still and not talking. S said that she was calling in sick so they could run errands and discuss things together, so I wasn’t surprised that they were together. I just thought it was funny that I saw them. I was on the phone with K the whole time, and she was getting a great kick out of the whole thing. So when the light changed to permit the left hand turn, I was able to see S’s face. He looked at me out of the corner of his eye and wasn’t smiling, though I was. I pulled into the right lane and he was in the left but quickly accelerated to pull into the lane ahead of me and then made the first possible right. I knew that he thought I was following him, which made me laugh hysterically. I figured that he was about ready to shit a brick and trying to figure out how to elude me without raising WWN’s suspicions. I imagine he was massively relieved when I didn’t make the same right hand turn. I was tempted, but I didn’t. When I arrived at my destination, I told K that I wanted to call S, just to assure him that I wasn’t following him.  I thought sure that he wouldn’t pick up his phone since he was with her and was fully prepared to leave him a voice mail, but apparently the time between his turn and my arrival at Kinko’s had been enough for him to get to his destination and separate from her in order to answer a call from me.  S: Hello darling.  R: I wasn’t following you. My destination was on Main Street.  S: I thought that was you. I kept looking and I could see that you were on the cell phone, but my phone wasn’t vibrating. Normally, I would have waved, but WWN was with me, I’ve just managed to step away for a moment.  R: I wouldn’t have caused trouble for you. I know that you aren’t too keen for her to see me, and I completely understand.  Don’t worry. But is everything going on schedule?  S: Yes, and I will call you when I know more.  So I called K back after I finished my business at Kinko’s and told her that I was confident that today would work as planned. But the day went on and I didn’t hear anything. That night after I put Bubba to bed, I left S a message. I said that I had to see him tonight and I would come up there if necessary. He called me at 10 pm. He said that he had been working on WWN’s car all day and had no time to get his things ready, but was on his way to see me for a short time. I was furious. I called K and asked her advice. She said just follow your heart. So he came over and we talked and he explained and said that Tuesday would be the day. I let him say it. I decided to give him one more chance because he was covered in grease from the car, so I believed his story, but it was his final pass.  Our time together ended with me bringing up some stuff about the people he works with. They were all speculating about his disappearance and came up with some rather interesting theories. One of them mentioned that S said he was going to AK and never returning. S told me once that he recently had a girlfriend living in Anchorage, so the news was extremely disturbing to me. The fact that his co-workers didn’t know where he went, the fact that one of them thought he was in AK, the fact that all of the friends I used to share with X disapprove of my relationship with S, and the fact that S has told so many weird stories and now let me down with showing me that he is a man of his word, all combined to make me a very unhappy girlfriend. S was understandably disturbed about all of the things that were being said about him, and let in a melancholy state. It wasn’t good.   The Decision   Tuesday 8/10 – I called S first thing in the morning, because I asked him on Monday to pick up the phone, so it was more a test than anything else. I left him a message instructing him to call me as soon as he got it. An hour later he called me, said that he got the message and would call me later. He didn’t let me get a word out. The rest of my workday was spent-  well...working.  After work S called me. He said that he had just gotten home and would make his way down to me in an hour and a half. He wasn’t going to move in but had a proposition for me. I was pissed. I called K. She asked if I was going to let him come over. I said that I was. I wanted to know about this “proposition.”  So later that night we sat on my bed talking. He said that he had lied to me – he hadn’t told WWN as much about me as he said he had. He said that he lied to me to make me feel more confident in our relationship. He said he couldn’t move in right now. He needs more time to finish things up with WWN. He went on for a long time explaining as he does. I listened to him without saying a word. When he was finished, we sat there in silence for a long time. He watched me – I could feel his eyes on me as I looked out the window and fidgeted with my acrylic nails. Then I took a deep breath.  “I have made my decision,” I said finally looking into his eyes, which immediately filled with something close to fear. “I can’t do this any more.” The fear deepened – I really think he expected me to end things with him completely, but I had something else in mind. “It’s just wrong. I hate to do this, but I have to. I have been through an emotional roller coaster; I am spent. You have been treating me like crap, so you take all the time you need to resolve things, but I can’t see you again until you have finished. I want to make love to you tonight, but after this we can’t see each other.”  He nodded his head and said that he understood. He said that when he showed up on my doorstep with his things, he would be completely free. I didn’t care. At that moment I was in control of the relationship. I took the cake away. I had sex with him, but only because I wanted it and needed it. I felt good about myself and happy, and realized that if the relationship were to end right then, it would be okay. I had what I wanted. I was no longer going to spend sleepless nights waiting for him to call. I was independent and strong and it felt damn good. When he got up to get dressed he asked if I meant what I said about making love and then not seeing each other. I said I was. He nodded again sadly. I felt triumphant and not sad at all. I felt better than I had in a long time. I still don’t know exactly what about the night changed the way I feel about S and myself and the two of us together, but I have a fresher view of everything.  I called K the second he left my apartment. I shared my excitement with her. She was very proud of me. I promised not to answer the phone the next time S called to make him sweat a little, and we hung up. I was so happy. I popped in another episode of  Sex in the City  and enjoyed a few laughs before I headed off to Dreamland.

      Today X called me.  "Happy fourth", he said.  "Fourth what?"  "Anniversary."  "Of what?"  "Our marriage..."  Oh, that. Who cares anymore? Obviously not me since I didn't remember the darn thing. Once the divorce is final, do you keep counting? Here marks the day when we would have been married for four years? I don't think so. August 5th no longer has that meaning for me. I just told him that I had forgotten. I hope his feelings weren't hurt.

      Everybody is growing suspicious about S's absence - myself included. What was supposed to be a brief trip with a return as early as Friday and as late as Sunday is still going on. My heart hardens when I can't get a hold of him and I promise myself that I will just walk away. But then he calls. I never thought that love could be so hard. It was easy to walk away from X - it was a loveless relationship. But I can't imagine letting S go. I feel so foolish for all of my fears, but then I will talk to X and he will tell me something that stirs suspicion about S and I wonder what the hell I am doing.  He says he may be home tonight - he is trying to get his ticket switched, but nevertheless he has a ticket for a return tomorrow. If he has some lame ass excuse for that not working then I am thinking the end will be.

      I knew it - I would speak to S and all my fears and doubts would fade to the background. Not because the problems are resolved but because of the things he says. If you have seen the film or stage production of  Chicago , you will recall the tap dance scene where Billy Flynn razzle dazzles the court room. Essentially you are witnessing a variation of what S does. My knees melt and he becomes the puppetmaster.  The sad thing is that I am not sure that I believe all that he says.  And as he said to me today, a relationship must be built on trust and if there is no trust there can be no respect.  The two come hand in hand. He said that he can't be in a relationship that lacks trust and respect.  The truth is that neither can I.  How much longer can I let this go on?   He said that if necessary he will work till his dying day to prove to me that I can trust him.  It really wouldn't take that much, but I haven't the courage yet to ask him for the one thing that would take away any doubts I have ever had and prevent any new ones from blossoming. I've decided that I am afraid that if he is unable to provide it for me, I will have tobe logical and end things between us.   I know that his absence is kindling all of these feelings and I can't decide whether or not that is a good thing.  Perhaps I need the separation to take a good and honest look at the path I am walking down.  One thing is for certain - separation sucks.  I don't do well with and never had.  I have to admit that it had a lot to do with my marrying X.  I was about to move back to the South to finish my final two years of college, and it was either break up or get married.  I chose the latter.  I still haven't decided exactly why I made that choice, but I think it must have had something to do with returning alone, being separated again .  Who knows?

      There must come a time at the end of every relationship when you take a second look at the person you are no longer with. I have been so consumed with my new relationship and having the custody agreement formulated the way I wanted it that I allowed myself to see new and terrible things in X that weren't there. It is amazing how consumed by one's self a person can become. From the beginning I have been a very selfish person - - and as a result I have pushed away a person with whom I hoped to maintain a friendly and civil relationship. After we split X seemed like such a stranger - a completely new and undesirable person. But I am beginning to see that it was in fact I who became a stranger. I emerged as an individual who didn't give a damn about the person she spent four years with, a person who became the evil and reviled ex-wife (I could be exaggerating, but I am sure that X would agree with me to some degree).  Throughout this time that S has been gone, I have been thinking a lot about my relationship with him and the one that just ended with X. I am beginning to wonder why I am so quick to jump into another marriage. Why can't I just be alone for a while? Am I so afraid of being single? Could it be that I don't want to be a single mom - that I am afraid to raise a child by myself? Could I be afraid that I will have a hard time finding someone who will want to be a father to my child without already being a father himself and that in itself defines S's attractiveness to me? Nothing will ever bring me back together with X, but why I am so anxious to be with S so completely so soon is beginning to be of concern.  I am so happy when S is here with me, but when he is gone doubts and fears and questions creep into my heart and mind and I am not quite sure what to do with them. One thing I do know is that I will no longer treat X like crap. It's the least I could do.  But the questions linger - will I remain with S? Will the problems be resolved? Will I discover that life can be just as fulfilling alone and that being a single mother isn't the end of the world?   Stay tuned for the next posting of....   just kidding.
