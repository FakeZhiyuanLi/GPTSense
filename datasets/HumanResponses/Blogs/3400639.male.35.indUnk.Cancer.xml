       This is my sisters ( urlLink cristina orr ) website.  It's a little ominous witht the music in the background but she does have some really nice photos in there.  She takes pitures of her "diaramas" and then, using a process called poleroid transfer, she makes prints, each one being unique.  Pretty cool.  Not for the squimish.   urlLink skeletal dropkick

       I've been working on the fence in the backyard.  It incorporates a retaining wall which cost us $2,000 and won't be going anywhere soon.  The fence sits on top of it.  I also had to repair the neighbors dilapidated fence as it fell over when I took mine down.  I had to tie some wire on it to keep it from falling over.    UPDATE: I'm done with all that I can do.  Now it's on to taking out old vegetation that we dont' want.  There is a shrub and some rosemarry and a thorny blackberry vine that need to make way for a vegetable garden and some grass. :)

       The fam is going to travel up to northcounty this afternoon to visit Armidas new friend who started this small vineyard in his spare time that makes  urlLink remarkable wine .  I can't call him her boyfriend because I got in trouble after introducing him as that at a recent party we had (Arms told me it was no big deal but obviously it made her uncomfortable).  So, in the spirit of fighting off awkward moments I will wait for the green light before applying the coveted title of boyfriend.

       We used to be at the top of the list for  urlLink Yahualica  but it seems we have been replaced by the .net version.  I need to get some more links to my page.     urlLink Google Search: yahualica

        Well, I don't think the guy trade marked his invented word so I don't see how their claim can hold up.  Maybe if it was his family name or something but it seems like they are just another example of people trying to cash in on Google success.    urlLink Gmail Supply and Demand (TechNews.com) : "Professor Edward Kasner, who invented the word 'googol' in the 1930s to describe a very big number. He wrote about the concept in a 1940 book, describing a googol as the number one followed by a hundred zeroes. Kasner's great-niece, Peri Fleisher, now insists that the US-based company has gained financially at the expense of the family. She said: 'If we do have a legal right, we're certainly going to exercise that. And now is the time.'' NPR"

        Man, eBay is like the best thing since the invention of the garage sale.  You can get anything on here.  The best part is that people on here are crazy!  They bid like 80% of the new cost for something that's used.  For example, a newflashlight normally sells for like $20, some people would bid $15 for it even though it's no longer new.  I guess they think it's just as good as new therefore deserves a near new price.  Go figure.  So it's really good to sell, but getting worse to buy, however, you have a pretty large pool of registered user's who are likely to see your item.  What are they up to now?  Something like  urlLink 30,000,000  users?!  Nice!    urlLink eBay

       We have two sisters we rent to in unit A.  They have been gone since Sunday and have left their large dog in the apartment by himself.  Last night, my sister-in-law got a frantic phone call (she lives in the other rental) to let the dog out and give him food and water.  The dog has pooed and peed all over the floor and tracked it everywhere in the apartment.  Mind you, this is a large dog, the kind that you have to trim the hair from his eyes so he can see like a big sheep dog so his paws are like 3 inches across.  Maria and I wrote an official notice that the dog must go if they want to continue to live there.  The lease states no pets.  They were supposed to come back last night but didn't.  I hope the dog hasn't trashed the place too badly.  It's mostly tile so it should clean up ok but the carpet had tracks on it too.  It's all just so wrong.    My gut reaction is to just give them their notice for there are several things that bother me.  I hope I'm handling this the best way I can.  I don't like kicking people out and they are nice people.  It's just they have a big dog which they didn't have when they moved in, they smoke occasionally which they didn't do when they moved in, they have a hard time backing up the driveway, and they have guests who park in the driveway.  Some of these things were laid out when they moved in (smoking, pets) but the others weren't so I am to blame for those.  I need to make a list of things the can get you in trouble around here.  The list: 1. No Pets 2. No Smoking 3. No Guest parking in driveway 4. No Trash in greenwast bin 5. No Loud late night parties 6. All tenants must be able to navigate the narrow driveway in reverse.

       This morning I was walking to the post box and noticed two birds, one big one and one small one.  The big one was eating and the small one definitely wanted some too.  My first thought was to somehow scare the big one to let the small one eat.  I ended up just walking by.  On my way back I saw the same two birds only this time they were right next to each other.  It turns out the big one was actually putting the food into the mouth of the small one. It was a parent/child relationship.   It just goes to show, sometimes even the best intentions are just wrong and it always makes sense to just wait and see what is going on before you jump in and do something drastic.

       Well, I was offered to teach the  urlLink CRP 457  course in the Fall.  I would enjoy teaching again very much there is just one problem...  I'm not in the teachers pool this year.  During all the things going on in my life over the last year I forgot to send in my letter.  This means that Linda Day who offered it to me has to search the list and make sure there is nobody on it that can teach it.  If there is, she has to offer it to them first.  If there isn't anyone or they refuse to accept then it's mine.  I hope there isn't anyone on there who wants it.

       Maria and I have recently been discussing getting into real estate.  She was looking into getting her appraisal license and I would get a realtor license.  We would work as a team.  We have been talking about this for a week or so.    Just today, I met with Bob Grayson (a realtor friend of ours) so he could show us a couple potential homes.  Guess what he brought up?  He would like to set up a meeting where all of us including a couple of our friends, Dustin and Vanessa, get together and discuss creating a real estate firm!  I actually got tingles up my spine.  I am really looking forward to meeting with him.

       I just got out of watching  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I have to say, that it is a pretty powerful film.  What makes it so powerful is that those are real people, that's real blood and tears.  Those are real New Yorkers burning, and young GI's from places like Iowa.  For anyone to dismiss this film as propaganda is to act like a two year old who's only existence is within one foot of themselves.  Moore puts it all together in one package.  Sure he manipulates and shows only what he wants to but.... Don't let that cloud the real message, big business is what drives the war machine and is what drove us to Iraq and is partially to blame for driving Bin Laden into the WTC.  Make no doubt about it.  There are a lot of millionaires being made from Iraq on our taxes.  It's bigger than Bush, it's congress, it's the senate, it's the supreme court, it's the majority of our elected/appointed leaders.    I now realize what Dean was talking about when he said we need to  urlLink take our government back . It's been hijacked by big business and special interests who don't care about the welfare of all Americans only about their money.  Kerry is also to blame for he too voted for war in Iraq and for the Patriot Act.  But I would rather have Kerry in there than Bush Inc.  Bush has failed failed failed us!  And he is a  urlLink Miserable Failure  as a leader too!
