      Yeah! Stayed up to watch the first quater finals match between Portugal and England. Woah... it was definitely worth watching... Both teams showed determination to win and not giving up till time up and both also showed worldclass soccer...But in the end... Portugal wins. England took an early lead but after that, u could hardly see England going into Portugal's penalty box. haha... Portugal sure deserved to win... they took all chnaces they had and try to score a goal... well... no offence ok... but i supported Portugal during the match... so when they score the equaliser, i was very happy... well... i can tell that both teams did their best during extra time and i think everyone can see that... But i mus comment on Rui Costa's goal... that was beautiful... But too bad... Lampard equalised.... Then comes the penalty shootout... so exciting... Beckham missed the first... and Rui Costa missed for Portugal. But whos the hero? Portugal's keeper Ricardo. He saved the crucial shot from Vassell ans scored against James to win... So exciting... the shootout went all the way to 14 kicks... haha... but who cares? Portugal wins and that is most important :P... Hope the rest of the matches will be tat exciting.  Final score:  Portugal 2 England 2  ( Portugal win 6-5 on penalties)

       Today's jus another ordinary day... went to sch... study... but i will be one of the best day in my life... Well... first, we got early dismissal because almost the whole sch went for the NDP thing including the teachers...Although its only for one period, but it was better than nothing... Heres the best part... After sch... we played soccer... Woah... wad a match... had so much fun... even scored two goals... one header and one making a run from my own half and had a shot that went in... so gd... haha... After that... we went into penalties... we played six goals as there were 6 ppl each team... haha... i saved from Nasir and Guan Zhu and some others they miss... in the end... we won... yeah... but thats not the end... while some of them went to play basketball, a few of us played penalty shootout... i was the keeper... and guess wad... i saved  all  the penalties from Guan Zhu, Francis, Clement, Kai Jie, Danny, Cheng Ning, Ming Kuan, Yong Cai and Htet Win... and some of them shoot more than once but i  saved all ... haha... But as it goes, i of course will have fagtiue and became tired so i start to let in some goals... but overall, i am very very very happy with my performance today and the save that i will remember most is the save that i had made from Nasir's penalty. :)
