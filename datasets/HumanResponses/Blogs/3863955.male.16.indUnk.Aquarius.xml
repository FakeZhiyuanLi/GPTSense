            The thought of leaving the school.. now saddens me even more... just now... during the  NYAA  physical recreation...   Mr Neo   showed some of the seniors pictures he have taken... since the past... the sight of those pictures... brings back fond memories... how long ago was it... when the 1st batch of Secondary One fencers... came togede from different schools... and formed the 1st spine of the team... i saw the powerpoint presentation... which shud be shown to the school during national day if not for the technical failure... memories came streaming back to me... the 1st photograph... was the photograph of the 1st batch of Secondary 1 fencers... which is my batch... we were all so different then... in our fencing jacket and breeches... smiling smartly at the camera... i dunno how can i describe the feeling of me when i saw the photo... all of us have changed... for the better... and some for the worse... but it sort of give me those kinda  "We are one family"  feeling... i felt so touched then... there's other photographs... and yes... i think the song  "Seasons in the Sun"  ... "we have joy, we have fun, we have seasons in the sun..." there were photos of the club togede at   Sentosa  ... how we have enoyed back then... under the hot sun... yet we do not mind it.. we enjoy the company of each and every of the fencers... there were rivalry... hatred between fencers... but at the end of the day.. we were always able to put all those things down... the kind of support that we get from each other during competition... imagine that u were me... you were behind in a fencing bout in a competition... evry point ur opponent hit u... u are losing hope.. losing faith... however... u see those frenz outside there.. screaming.. cheering... wildly for u... even ppl that u nv really like.. they are screaming at the top of their lungs... just to hope they're able to help a little by cheering... then... u started scoring hits... and they scream again.... every point was crucial... and then... u overcame that fencer... in the finals... u just sort of burst up inside of u... jumped up real high... hugged whoever wud offer their shoulders... despite urself noeing some of them dun like u... they did not lose faith... that's the scene... that pushes me... it's nv the medal... i can nv give a damn for medal... i m not fencing because i want medals.. i have enuf of that.. it's the support... it is... awe-inspiring.. how gentle.. caring.. sweet can all of the fencers get... whenever one falters... he or she cried... and u can see a group of us... flocking to them... all wanting to comfort the fencer...       A few other photos shows us training... and the time in   Sentosa  ... yea.. training all these years.. it's tough... some fencer may go cursing at   Mr Neo  ... but i do feel... that we have enjoyed all that... we took the sufferings togede... we strive to be the best... togede... we share the happy times togede... we share jokes that we have... there is always laughter during trainings... there were times... we were lectured... but if u were to think abt it...   Mr Neo   haven really treated us badly during the time we were in there... when he was in  Europe ... he kept reminding us to ask him to buy some chocolates back for the fencers... he is fierce... he is strict... but how much he care abt the club... is unquestionable... how anxious he was... when one of the fencers... was sort of  "bitten"  by barnacles... and cant swim back to shore... he wasn't a good swimmer... but yet.. he dived in selflessly... trying to reach the fencer... the time in   Sentosa  ... will be a memory i'll nv be able to forget... if u fencers can forget... i certainly cant... we had fun... we really had... we were all laughing... and moaning when we find out the day isn't getting ani younger...       Those were the days... my friends... those were the days... i hope that in the future.. if i had seen ani fencers of my batch in the streets... i can tok to them abt the club... with them having as much fond memories as me of the club... i wonder how many of u ppl will actually go back to fencing... i certainly will be fencing... i hope... i can see a few of the current  Express  fencers going back to fencing after they have graduated... so much for toking abt the club... i hope i can add in more emotions to wat i have typed... but my expression is poor... nvm... those expressions... shall be left inside of me.. inside the deepest chamber of my heart...

             Finished another day of fencing... rather an eventful day for me... and tiring too... needa wake up at like 6.45am... and fence till abt 5pm i think... my main event was of cuz the  Men's Foil Team   Event ... we're seeded 1st ! haha... guess my 2nd and   Xavier's   3rd ranking in the Individual Event done it all... we sort of avoided the "big fishes" till the finals... haha... main attraction... i always had a rivalry with that   Russian Puppy  ... it intensify much further in the final bout... when i meet   Alex  ... he started it 1st... not me... i'm innocent.. see a halo on top of my head?    *laugh out loud*    he started the shouting... wat i did is just to shout back... and that freaking   Russian Bitch   and   Russian Butch   irritates me further... saying things like  "If you do this in international competition, you'll get a black card"  hey... it wasn't me doing it.. ur son started it... and that   Humpty-Dumpty Felix  , warn me abt sportsmanship, hey, i have it, i have always display it. I m sure my own fencers noe wat i meant... and those who have played games with me be4... i sure do have that.. it's ur freaking son that dun have it... nvm, we won it aniway.. right team? we are still the   BEST   in Under-17... nobody can beat us... so long as me and   Xavier   are togede... we're literally   UNBEATABLE   ! i dare to make that claim... haha.. ;)    The other weapons... well.. the  Ladies' Epee  won onli a bronze.. but hey.. it is good.. considering their age... three 15 year-olds and a 14 year-old... cummon   Pei Jun  ... if u are reading this entry... dun be disheartened... i trust that u have a stronger character than that right? haha...  the  Minime  is urs for the taking... it's up to u whether u want to hit it with ur  Epee  or not... oh... and ya... the  Men's Sabre ... i dun want to blame anibody... but if i want to blame.. it might just be   Mr Neo  ... he played with the tactics.. put me as reserve and   Gerald   to start... putting me 1st to end.. followed by   Xavier   and   Jefferson  ... it cud have been us in the finals   Jeff  ... i really could have been us... i sure had one glorius moment fencing sabre... my team was losing like... 22 - 30? or more? not sure of the exact score... i was 1st to end.. so i m to fence till 35 points.. didnt do well for the 1st few points... but i dunno wat got into me... perhaps the idea of me being the best fencer.. right   Marlina  ? i cant lose right? i wun... and nv will.. =)  Under-17  is my domain... nobody takes it from   Mighty Eugene   over here... haha... i'm so full of myself right? well.. back to the  Sabre ...  I fence from 8 points down till we were onli 1 point down... 35 - 34... oh man... i cant believe myself... how did my  Sabre  get so gd? luck? haha.. thanks   Farah  .. for the compliment.. for saying the way i fence looked nice... haha... i sure want to see myself on camera... but too bad.. next time perhaps... i m just doing the same thing.. step fwd... dodge back... becomes my priority... and i attk him... for 10 points.. i do just that... call him dumb or daft.. i dunno... but he got hit by that for 10 times... but well..   Xavier   and   Jeff   perhaps just put a lil' too much pressure on themselves... in the end.. lost 40 - 45... u have next yr   Jeff  ... dun worry.. u are better than them... but u used too much techniques against beginners that practically cant fence...    And that   Mr Neo  ... quarrelled with  Felix ... my fault again? seems to me like it... i m always causing trouble for him... he must be glad i m leaving school... haha... he can save himself from all these quarrels... but then again.. we were accused of smt we didnt do... nobody likes the feeling of being accused... i m no exception... so.. i support u all the way   Mr Neo   !    *winks*    making sweeping statements... stupid egg... listening to everybody... but nvm... i get   Mr Neo   in trouble... but i had my sweet revenge... i have gotten the last laugh...     *evil laugh*      Back again to my dear friends   Xavier   and  Fadhil  ... i have done my part... i promised to fence... and i abide by it... i fenced... and we won... so... well..  i can leave the club with no regrets... no regrets at all... with the exception of maybe.. unable to get closer to some of the fencers... i loved the club... and i still love it... i hope the club do too... but it's unlikey... it'll be  "Good riddance"  ... for ppl like   Xue Qian   and some others.. me leaving the club is the 1st that they want...   Nicholas Goh  ... it's time for u to take over... i've left the club in good condition... i want to see it the same again... not the same.. even better... i m onli left with the  Pesta Sukan ... it'll just be for fun... win or lose... no pressure... my official last tournament ends today... i can officially step down from fencing...  15/08/04... memorable one... togede with 13/04/04... and of cuz.. 13/02/88  =P dun ask me wat these dates means... i'll nv ever tell... but the 2nd 1... u guys can forget abt it... i m trying to forget abt it aniway too... haha... i may just fence in the same team with   Xavier   again next yr... who noes... time will tell... remember team.. for the last time...   WE ARE THE BEST   !

            End of yet another day. went to watch the fencing in the afternoon.. when i reach there... it was already the finals of the last event of the day...    *phew*    i manage to catch my brother and Harry in action... against  Duxton Plain Fencing Club(DPF)  ... amazingly...  DPF ... they manage to beat our  PRCS B  which consists of   Nicholas  ,   Nazreth  ,   Daniel   and   Ronald  . Heard that it was   Ronald   losing the pts... felt sorry for   Nicholas  ... always deprived of medals.. he's one of the best around... but it's just.. he dun have the luck.. better luck next time...      Well.. on the bright side...  my brother's team is the champion... putting one gold in the bag of the 3 expected of us in this compt... the other 2 is up to me and  Xavier  to get ... if we fumble... none of the 2 will come true... if we dont... it'll be so called double gold... back to my brother's bout.. when i reach there... it was 33-35... with our  PRCS A  losing by 2 points... next bout was   Harry's   bout.. he was well.. as usual.. injured... he lost points... and that made it  36-40  and the last bout was up to the anchors for the 2 team...   Derrick   and   Yuan Hao  ... u shud have seen   Mr Neo's   face...  red as tomato !  haha.. he was just that angry... practically cursing and swearing away next to me... haha... pressure... hehe.... -.-" well.. gd job my brother.. u've grown up... he won later  45-43 ... catching up 9 points and conceding onli 3 points.. well done !      Heard how the fencers dun listen to instructions by   Mr Neo  .. could have got 2 more medals... no complaints for the  Ladies' Sabre ... well done to u gers... against a team which has 2 national fencers.. and ours with none.. u gers sure went out and show them wat're your're made of...    *clap clap*    losing by a margin of 6 points was it? that makes it  45-39 ... not a bad result... u gers will go far next yr.. continue working hard... but   Mr Neo   had most complains for   Daphne(Ah-San !)  ...  ok.. the   Ah San   just means  Skinny  in a dialect... heard in the 3rd and 4th placing match.. our   Daphne   was leading  43-41 ... and   Mr Neo   told her not to attack.. she attacked.. and was parried riposte twice.. force the bout to sudden death as it was  43-43  at the end of 3 minutes.. and later went 1 point shy to lose  44-43 ... yup.. no doubt u have lost... but   Daphne  .. i think u've learn well without   Farah  ... how anchoring a team feels... dun feel bad.. it's not ur fault... u did well.. and to think u're onli  Sec 2 ... and dear   Farah  ... i dun think u need to worry for ur team event next yr animore right? haha...  u have a gd batch of ladies' foilist at ur disposal...       So... it's time for me to make some mental preparation...  tml's my big day !     *looks around*    Hey ! dun gimme that look.. i'm not getting married.. perhaps nv in my life? haha... time to clear all.. stupid thoughts outta my head... and not hope for ani external motivation to be there..   Fadhil   and   Xavier   sure has theirs there... but well..  i m self-motivated !  haha... i'm independent.. not forgetting..  i'm the best !  so... i'll sign off here... wish me luck eh everyone? =)

            Wow... didnt expect me to slp till 1pm today... i'm so dead tired... even skipped all the remedials and tests today... darn... nvm... who cares... just leave it be... just needa retake the test at a later date...  this sucks... making me type all over again.. hate repeating ymself... going mad soon... haha...wonder how my frenz are doing... heard that the  Ladies' Foil  losing... well.. without   Farah  .. the mainstay in the team... it's pretty obvious how they wud fare... i just dun want them to lose hope and fence... it's a learning experience after all... for the rest.. hang on till i m there...       Overwhelmed by this sense of guilt ... playing floorball when me stick hit   Wenna   and cut her right above her eye... i didnt do it intentionally.. i didnt even break ani rules.. it wasn't high stick... my stick is below me waist.. but her head lowered and i cudn't pull back my stick in time...    *guilty conscience*    haix...  Friday the 13 ... a bad day after all... shud have gone home instead of sticking around in school and getting ppl hurt... was feeling hyper ytd... perhaps i m trying to push those thoughts outta my head... thus... the best way is distracting myself... even played basketball... i usually dun do that animore... onli recently when that   "thing"   is making my head whirl... i started playing bball again... to release stress... vent anger...       Tml's the day... my final competition.. my final gift... i've had good years in the club... 4 years... my last compt for them... the  PRCS Fencing Club ... the last thing i can do as a captain of the club... i've fulfilled it during the  June Holidays ... now... the last thing i can do as a fencer... is to win them 2 more medals... a double gold wud be nice... tt'll meet   Mr Neo's   proposal to   Mrs Teo.  .. and we might get even more money next yr... i'll be captaining the  Sabre  and the  Foil Team ... i hope with my influence... i can get them going...  Let's do it boys ! We'll show the rest what we can do !  we're the best  Foil  team ever to appear in the  Under-17 ... the   Eugene-Xavier   combo... the veri same combo which win us the  bronze  in the  Under-20 Team Event ... let's do it   Xav  ... it's onli us... i promise i'll do my best... and   Jefferson  .. dun worry.. i may not be trained in  Sabre ... but i sure isn't ani walkover... i'll do my best... give them a hard time... and if possible.. give them a good thrashing...      More actions will be for tml... i'll be coming home a big winner... let's do it guys ! peeps out there... wish me luck okay? for the   Mighty Eugene   will come marching in the school a happy and satisfied man... finally completing his service to the whole club... at least as a   PRCSian  ... =)

             Bad bad... a string of bad news after another... guess what.. scored a  B3  for my  MT ... and my mum aren't happy with... most mums might find it a gd result... but to her... no A... means no good...    *sigh*    what can i do... retake? i want to... but well... since the result is out... there isn't anithing i can do to change it... heard   she   scored a  B4 ... but she had a merit for  Oral ... must be rather disheartening for   her  ... but well... good luck eh? i dun have a chance to console u... so well.. make ur choice wisely... but honestly.. i think u can fare better  ;)  Good luck if u were to retake  =)     Still letting the same thing affect me... it's... crap... darn it... my fencing.... 10 - 6  against   Fadhil   and  10 - 8  against   Xavier  ... doesn't prove much right? if not for my counter-attacks... wud have lost... cant do ani crap but stop hit... but the timing was good... and perfect in some case... fence   Sabre   later... won 10 - 4 against   Gerald  ... and 10 - 0 against   Christina  ... was somehow playing... but well... i feel better holding a   Sabre   in hand than a   Foil   nowadays...    Cannot cannot... i need to wake up and perk up...   Gerald   and   Samuel's    EAGLES Award  is depending on me... if we win smt.. they'll get the $150... so it's $300 for both of them... gives me a feeling i m doing a gd deed at least... haha... damn... i dun have the mood to fence at all... nvm... just needa have this mindset...  "I am the best in Under-17. Be it Foil, Epee or Sabre, I am the best. And being the best, i cant lose to anybody else"  Arrogant? but well.. it's onli this mindset that can keep my fighting spirit inside of me now... time to retrospect....

            Still letting the same old thing bother me... y cant i just get it out of my head? it's stuck there... perpetually it seemed... nth can change that... i cant concentrate... concentration is at zero... sort of screwed my  Biology  paper.. wasn't in the mood to study ytd... the  Maths  wasn't bad... luck? perhaps... the whole day in sch.... and i dun seem to pick up anything... getting distracted... how often do u see me rushing to complete a  SS  paper on time? Never... practically... in dreamland.... yea...  i weren't concentrating... it's like... my body's there... and my mind... drifting... farther and farther away... i want to reach it... but it just seemed so far...      After collecting the keys from my mum... i walked home... the 1st time after like...  the last time i remember walking home from school was when it was beginning of the year... sec 3... so it's like... 18 months? 18... i dun like the number... dun ask me y.. i just hate it... dun even ask... many a time... while walking...  while retrospecting... i wan to scream real loud... cry out loud... and run as fast as i can back home... that urge is inside of me...  but... dun think it wud look nice on me right? ppl may think i m from some madhouse... and i'm on the loose... wasn't aware of the vehicles around too... saw a car last minute just as it went over the hump...    *phew*    that was close...      I wanna vent out my anger... on myself... on others... my only destination... the basketball court... i hope that  1/6  guy who tried to play punk with me was there... i wud make sure he's injured... sweetly... not quite the word to describe an injury? haha.. heck it... i cant be bothered...  i'm just so... enervated... yea.. in a state of capitulation... it's exasperating trying to put up that front ... hell yea... it is...   Nicholas   tried telling me things just now... sorry fren... but... just spare me for this week... leave me to concentrate... i m darn distracted already... good news or bad news... it dun matter... if it's good news... it'll be double bliss if i got the golds in the team event... and the gd news... if it's bad... at least i get to be happy... and at least it wun affect my performance... it's already affecting real badly... screw it... thanks   Nicholas  .. for helping all these while.. but just kinda leave me alone... i noe u wun read this... but i just pray u wud...      4 tests tml... and a  Oral  exam to take... i hope this wun affect me at all.. i need a major boost... but... i dun think anithing can boost me right now... i dun wan to flunk the  Oral .. but i cant do it well... i bet of it... perhaps i can... if i show more confidence and i dun let anithing affect me when i m taking the exam... to put everything aside... fark it... i dunno... if i can...    *sigh*    perhaps more time left alone wud be gd.. but it'll onli make me think more than wat i shud be thinking... i'm not sure...  just good luck to myself...    *sigh*    last but not least... good luck   Farah  ... on ur exam...

            Yea... from the title of the entry... u guys shud have guessed... i've watched    Ella Enchanted   ...   Ella   is it? not sure... and hell yea... i am enchanted... it's more like a fairytale... things screened in the movie can onli happen in a fairytale... but then again... a fairytale is wat most of the peeps out here ask for right? A fairytale huh.. i used to believe in it.. when i was young... how young? haha... i m young ytd and older today.... so i wun give u the timeline on how young i m toking abt... and yea... i cant get over wat i've read... it's sad... sad sad...       I would really want to focus... just shut all the crap out of my mind... and fence... but hell... i cant do that.. i just cant... perhaps u guys are bored over this thing and the fencing thing... but it's just the 2 things i can nv get out of my head... i would want to get it out of my head... really... but hell again... i cant...  "Just fence  Eugene "  ... i've heard my inner voice telling me...  "Forget all those craps..."  I would love to... pls tell me... how to?  Life isn't fair ... spoke to   Angelina   i presume? cousin of   Norin  ... i told her life wasn't fair... and hell yes...  Life isn't fair ... we can strive to make it fair... and we shud make it fair... i m sure   Melissa   would have said those if she were to hear me say that life wasn't fair...  life wasn't meant to be fair... the truth hurts... but... it's the truth...         There is no way... i repeat.. no way wat happened in    Ella Enchanted    to happen in real life... noe the reason y i m just so fascinated with the word  "Dream"  now? yes i agree... it's just dream... but in dream.. i can be wat i want to be... i can be the   World Champion    in    Foil Fencing  ... i can even be   Bill Gates   ! but damn it, reality just stings... i didnt mix it up with stinks... i really mean it.. reality stings... it hurts... need some alkaline... anibody got ani?      And once again.. i fooled my frenz... they tot i m the same... happy and all... but they didnt noe how gd an actor i can get... for those who have the benefit of reading this blog.. u noe how i m feeling.. those i think it's just 2 ppl... perhaps   Marlina   can sense... but i noe u are just blindly guessing at times... u got things wrong too.. but   Farah  .. i m quite certain u cant see me acting... it's too real to be fake... Hollywood shud get me... but dun need to worry abt me.. both of u...   Marlina  .. u have more things in ur life than mine.. thus... well... get a grip on it... i noe u are gripping it well...   Farah  ... ur prelims remember? study hard and good luck will ya?       Dun need to worry abt this  big big fren of urs ... he's   Iron Man   remember? haha.. i'll be fine.. i m just unsure of whether i can perform my best...but well.. once again.. i wud love to live in the tale... but well.. reality and dreams... they're 2 different things right? quit lying to urself... and get a grip... oh drats.. i'm toking to myself again.. dun bother okay? haha.... =)

            I just got a feeling... i wun be feeling gd at all today... i've read smt.. heard smt... i've this feeling for a veri long time.. but didn't dare to verify it... running from reality? it's not for no reason... man i just cant... i dun want to write it out... it hurts... badly... and deeply... guess i'll put this all aside... after the competition...  sorry guys but... i'm not even sure i will have the heart to fence in the competition... i will fence... but... i dunno.... i noe... the results will depend greatly on the way i fence...  i noe it's a little late to tell u peeps out there... but...  argh !  i dunno.. i really.. cant put my heart to fence animore... i'll try... i promise...      There ain't ani words to describe how i m feeling right now.. that's wat u get when u put too much hope in smt.. false hopes it turn to... and it will just sink u.... that single line is enuf to sink the so called   Mighty Eugene  ... winner of a dozen medals.... perhaps more... the most feared in the  Under 17  along with   Xavier  ...  craps... rubbish... trash... absolute craps ... even the greatest will fall... i've fallen this time... but i'll try to pick myself up... i sort of wanna tell myself.. i dun give a damn animore...      But it's disheartening.. i believe... it's really disheartening.. i believe those reading wun even noe exactly wat i m toking abt... ya... i still prefer the word  ' Dream '  .... in dream... really..    *sigh*    i dunno... i'm really afraid my mood today will affect me when i go out with my friends later... i'll pray... damn it... ya.. i dun blame anybody... i only have this   Stupid Eugene   to blame... y the 3 years and nth...  tt's dumb... utter dumbness... pure stupidity... i'm daft... i nv tot i could be like such a fool...        Pls   Farah  ... and pls   Marlina  ... upon reading this... dun even attempt to ask me wat's going on with me... i suppose onli u 2 will read mine... and perhaps another fren of mine... but he'll nv leave ani comments... for this blog is unknown to many... i wud prefer it this way... just at least.. let me pretend that i'm toking non-stop to myself... that's how i face problems since i was in sec sch.. write it out.. and tear it away... unfortunately.. u dun expect me to tear my com away rite? haha... trying yet to attempt a dry humour there... yea... perhaps views of other ppl of me... they're right... i have nv put myself in front.. thinking onli abt others 1st nowadays...  but it's okay... it's onli the 2 of u gers knowing.. unless of cuz there's unknown visitors to the blog... haha...      Everybody in school thinks that i m... well.. haha.. able to handle many things at one go... multi-tasking? haha... i realise how stupid i m to think... that i m that capable... it's either...  i m too dumb.. too stupid.. too daft... too foolish... too moronic... too gullible... too asinine... totally witless... or all of them...  i believe it's all of them...    *sigh*    ... i daren't have too much hope in everything that i do anymore.. like i've always say to ppl... it's time for me to say it too myself...  the higher your hopes... the greater your disappointment...

            Was terribly pissed today by both   Fadhil   and   Xavier  ...   Fadhil   thinks he is too smart, trying to get the better of me... nowhere near boy... try harder next time... and   Xavier  ... darn him... can u at least tell me when u want a change of plans? u didnt even intend to tell me do you? if i hadn't ask, i doubt u wud even tell me that you are going out with ur family? pls.. have the courtesy to tell me, dun make me wait in vain at home since morning, and once u come online, u didnt even bother to tell me that u are going out with ur family.. hey listen up... i'm not saying u cant go out with ur family, but if u want to change our plans for today, at least tell me urself, if   Fadhil   had not tell me wat u told him ytd.. i wud not even noe... and u said u are going to see   Mr Geza   off that day, when i called, u said u aren't going animore, did u even tell me again?      Bleh... forget it... it's not the 1st time...   MANY     times... darn it... u nv learn aniway... forget it... i practically just sleep the whole morning... didnt tok much to anybody online even...  so i took a shower and just sleep... woke up later... watched    Collateral      ALONE  ... but hey... watching a movie alone ain't that boring after all... maybe partially it's because   Collateral's   not as boring as   The Village  ... it's full of action... not those types of movies that a normal girl-next-door may like... it's more like a guys show...  but hey... wat's with those love thingy that's in every show now... u can nv get away from those...   The Village   has one...   Collateral   has one too... but i'll give   Collateral   a thumbs up for those who wants to watch it... it's nice... it shows how much somebody can do in 1 night... at least it didn't bore me to death right? it's  NC-16 ... that's y i watched it... had to save those non  NC-16  to watch with my frenz...  they cant watch those  NC-16  shows...       Now i'm back at home again... sitting on the same chair facing my  darling  computer... hehe... dun look at me like that...  this com's my girlfriend for as long as i have her... so she's my girlfriend for like... 2 years?  hehe... dun think of me as such a brute or smt... i have my caring side too =p hehe... this com hardly broke down... hehe.... Watching   Singapore Idol   here... how come i dun see   Mr Azhar   and   Nadia  ? sad sad... it'll be interesting to see how they fare... haha... I am currently  LMAO ... they're just hilarious... but well.. i admire their courage to go in front of the judges... that courage is smt i wud nv have? daren't even ask for a movie, wat more going in front of the judges? my courage is different from that of those ppl.. mine's more of those being able to confront ppl kind of courage... for eg. speaking up when required? hehe... that's wat   Marlina   told me.. i didnt noe that's considered as courage too... shall end here... nth more to add...  SmiLe =)

It was really... hmmm.. fun at my cousins' place... all my relatives are there... and i really chatted with them... reach there at abt 3.30pm perhaps.. after eating... it was all chatting all the way to 10pm.. nv knew i can tok for so long rite? chatted abt many things... past... present.. future... haha... also abt wat course for me to go after Os... still haven made up my mind... it's either IT... something to do with nature or the outdoors... or i'll go marine... haha...    What shud i do for the next 2 days... they will be my last few days playing... after next week's competition... i'll stop fencing... coming out for a cameo in the   Pesta Sukan  ... but i'll not train... so... need to play hard the next 2 days... and i need to date my books daily after that... not a perfect date... i wud rather the date to be a person...    *giggles*    but well.. no choice rite? haha... perhaps... swimming tml... and movie on Tuesday? wud the cinema be open tml? not sure... but i think i'll be watching  House of Flying Daggers ...   Xavier   wants to watch it... which means we'll have to leave   Fadhil   out... he dun understand  Chinese .. it'll be a waste of his money...  The  Collateral   sounds nice.. but..  NC-16 ? darn.. none of my frenz can watch it... only 1 can.. but i'm not trying... dun have the courage to... hehe...  next yr i'll all be able to watch with my frenz... missed so many shows because my frenz cant watch... hmmph...    Shall come out with plans of wat to do tml... after i seek   Xavier's   opinion... currently watching  Arsenal vs Man Utd ... hehe... man... the defence of  Man Utd  needs improvement... haha... need to go dating with the TV right now.. before i start to date my books after next week... hehe... =P

            Haven even got over my coach's thingy... here comes another few problems again...   Xavier   and   Fadhil  ... i'll cry if i were to type everything...   Xavier  ... trust is the key word... it's not ur fault   Fadhil  ... i wun side with anibody.. i need to be fair... but since everything is over... i wun comment much on that...   Trust is the key word ... remember that...      Got to know better wat's going on between my teachers and   Mr Geza  ... haix... money... it's crap... not a bad session i had with some of my fencers today...  Handball  was fun... till tt incident occur...  Captain Ball  wasn't bad... my team scored more than 10 points? haha... gd job gers ! went home after that... went to watch  The Village  with   Farah   and   Fadhil   later... a waste of money with no storyline... till now.. i m wondering wat in the world are they saying... borrowed 2 books from the libary...  Stephan King  and the other guy.. been a long time since i last read...      Tried solving some problems when i reach home... and it instantly took me 3 hours ! wow... my hand can continue typing for so long... and i'm still typing... haha... some ppl just cant face reality huh? Talked to   Marlina   abt the council... my views are somehow prejudiced in a way... dun bother abt me... yes u are right... my dealings with ppl in the club isn't right.. but it is that way that keep them moving right? ppl lead differently... tt's my style... at least i have it...   Ranjani   dun have... at least it worked...      darn lazy to add a proper entry nowadays... maybe tt's wat caused my blog to die 2 years back eh? laziness? haha... and still now... shall stop here... those problems are killing me in a way... lol... but luckily... generally.. they are solved... haha... efficient huh? =P                                                                   t r u s t

             Money is the root of all evil ... i understand wat this statement means now...  Money change ppl ... i tot i wud nv come across such a case... ironically... it happened on my veri own coach... overwhelmed by greed... he can even burn a bridge to his income...  is money really that almighty?         Money cant buy everything .. at least... money cant buy u sincere frenz... money cant buy u true love... love in the case of a  BGR  or even smt as simple as a family relationship... relationship driven by money usually turn sour once the money is gone... He's the best coach ever... he's one of my 2 coaches... ( I dun consider   Slava   my coach at all)... he's a really nice guy 3 years ago... maybe u really do need those time to understand the person better... he has make me to a fencer of my calibre presently all by himself... he has single-handedly make the   Foil   and   Sabre   in the club great... a reputable coach in  Hungary ... is money really that impt? It's sad... for things to end this way... nobody wanted this to happen... i sure wish i can train under him again... but i cant even see that glimmer of hope... perhaps time for a change of coach...      I m not in the mood to write much today... i m feeling slppy and my eyes are closing... i think i shud just end here... will be going to school tml for a  handball session ... hope it will be a fun one... update more next time... ={       F a r e w e l l  M y  C o a c h . . .

That   Mr Neo  ... again... saw me toking to   Wan Ying   on 3rd floor during  A Maths ... which i was doing  E Maths ... becuz i've dropped  AM ... and he started his rubbish again... dunno what he told   Melissa   this time... perpetually irritating me... and hey   Melissa  , i dun have  another girlfriend ... hmmph... and   Le Ying  ... i current do not.. i repeat... do not have one... maybe except   Xavier  ? hehe... well..   Melissa  .. u're right...   Xavier   is too bz with his own  darling  than to be bothered with his this  darling  right?  "xiang dang nian..."  literally... translated to chinese... it just mean... " Those were the years..."   hehe... i'm no gay... dun get me wrong... =P      Manage to slp for 1 hour during   Miss Salinah's   class.. she was on  MC ... so... not bad... but i wonder... how do i manage to slp in a class that is  soooooo  noisy? the rehearsal after school is a waste of time... as if i dunno how to collect the prize and bow? haha... dun look down on me... i've had more experience than many others out there in such circumstances... =P just being a councillor means that i need to be on stage for at least once a year... hehe...      Well... looking forward to tml... get to fence   Jeff   in  Sabre ... now i can see if i can still match him in a weapon i'm untrained in... hehe... it'll be interesting... and the 5 days... which we deservingly need... time for me to plan a study log... haven started planning yet... abt time to do so... shall play a little.. while studying a little... to prove my class wrong...  hmmph ... hehe.. alright.. nth else to add... signing off... =)

              Been one heck of a day... the day started well inititally.. maths wasn't tt boring.. amazingly..  Chemistry  passed by fast... and it's recess... as usual... hang out with my group of frenz... the usual ones...   Mr Shafie   had tt standing up and sitting down "game"... haha... escape most of it as i m hiding... lolx... The periods after recess was quite ok..  Bio...  had 3 free periods... and   JT   and   SH   had that "game" they were playing... and   SH   came out with a chipped teeth...   *Ouch*   ... i understand him... i've chipped my teeth before.. it hurts... yup.. the one that is veri veri veri obvious... the onli yellow one... kekez...     Back in class... had a terrible verbal assault with   JT  .. he tried to stuff words into my mouth ! things that i didnt say... he claimed that i say... and said   Harry   and   Jie Sheng   told him... liars... i did tok to   Harry  .. but i didn't tell   Jie Sheng   anithing at all... must be him adding the spice and everything... the whole class went quiet when me and   JT   argued.. kekez.. so funny.. i apologise again to   Shun Man   and   Shi Min  ... for shouting at them... i was really  "hot"  ... haha... didnt noe i can be so fierce? u guys haven seen the last of me... but that   JT   is really tooooo much... it's gd i tok some sense to him so he can be less  conceited  and  mulish ... and learn to  retrospect ...     The  CME  was gd.. got to play with  Play Dough ! yup.. i'm a deprived child.. hehe... it has been long since i last mould something.. so.. today's session is fun... the  Bio  test wasn't as hard as i tot it wud be... all i studied came out... with exception to the fermentation thingy... hehe... but i guessed i'll smoked the test thru... just pray.. or   Mr Neo   will have my head... he's serious abt me passing my  Bio .. but without his and   Ms Oh's   help.. i really wud not have passed... i owe a lot to them...      Competition's soon... Prelim's soon too ... well.. will be able to concentrate once i well... finish my season for this yr... didnt come back with any individual gold... but nvm.. i'll work even harder... and i will prevail ! hehe... have abt... 3 tests tml? again? haha... we're nv short of tests... going bonkers from the test... teachers think we arent smart enuf... nvm... i'll show it to them... and that   JT   thinks he's god damn smart aniway... i'll need to do smt abt it... and i'm sure he's bound to tell diff things to diff ppl in the class... nvm.. condemned once last yr because of some msg i failed to pass... again this yr if he were to malign me... i'm use to it... it's hard being   Eugene  .. but i've grown accustomed to it already...     Guess there's nth for me to add now... i wish myself a nice day tml... with no more quarrelings... shouted till my throat goes dry... haha...

            Here i am again... hmm.. feeling sort of... tired and refresh? after slping for 4 and a half hours after returning from school just now... left   Fadhil   alone to play his game while i go and slp... hehe... woke up a few times in between... but refused to get up until now...*yawnz* it can get sort of tired if u dun slp well the nite before u noe... i realised it today... i had training ytd.. and just slp at abt 11.30pm... and i was sooooo tired today...   Mr Luo   said i dun look veri well too... well.. stress have been building up unknowingly... 52 days was it? or is it 51 days? to the prelims? and to think that i can onli start revising onli after next week... and even after that... i need to make a cameo in the    Pesta Sukan Team Championship   ...      Had a really weird dream last nite... the more i think abt the dream... the more i was fascinated by the word dream... like wat i said previously... hehe... the dream's nice... but well... things that happen in a dream... will onli happen in a dream... but then again.... in a dream... u get to be who u want to be... u can to be with the person u wan to be with... and many other things... it's just that fascinating... to me at least... childish? i'm like a small boy still discovering what a dream is rite? haha... but the dream's sweet... y must my brother wake me up just when things are going to get better? *awwwww* but well... all dreams are like that... u wake up nearing the climax...      Things had gotten better... manage to speak to  her  a little today... helped in the correction of essays of students from 4/9... but i regret not apologising when i have the chance just now... even though it wasn't me at fault... but thinking again.. it couldn't have been  her  anyway... so it's better off me apologising to  her ... shoudering wateva i can... i dunno... it's easy... yet difficult at the same time when u need to apologise to someone u hold close to ur heart... sincerely... during my teenage years... the only time i really apologise sincerely was when i did an unfilial act... to my mum... so... well... but nvm... i noe i will be able to do it... it's better off for me apologising... so... i can have a piece of my mind... to fence in the    Under-17 Team Event   ... i dun need to fence.. but i decided to anyway... the last thing i do to   Fadhil   and   Xavier   as a fren... they wun be able to find another   Eugene   in their team animore... but i noe i wun be able to fence well without getting everything solved before the competition... fencing with a heavy heart... is as if fencing half-heartedly... u wun be able to concentrate... i noe of it... haha...      It's so late already... and i have yet to study for   Biology  ... but i dun think i need to slp early... after slping for 4 and a half hours... cool... hehe... somehow got addicted to the word dream... so below is are lyrics to a song by the  Everly Brothers - All I Have To Do is Dream ... courtesy of   urlLink  http://www.LetsSingIt.com    ... i dun meant anithing else from the lyrics.. just sharing a nice... old... song... so here it goes...      The Everly Brothers - All I Have To Do Is Dream      Dream dream dream dream dream dream dream When I want you In my arms When I want you And all your charms Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream...    When I feel blue In the night And I need you to hold me tight Whenever I want you All I have to do is dream...    I can make you mine Taste your lips of wine Any time Night or day Only trouble is Gee whiz I'm dreamin my life away    I need you so That I could die I love you so And that is why Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream...    I can make you mine Taste your lips of wine Any time Night or day Only trouble is Gee whiz I'm dreamin my life away    I need you so That I could die I love you so And that is why Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream...
