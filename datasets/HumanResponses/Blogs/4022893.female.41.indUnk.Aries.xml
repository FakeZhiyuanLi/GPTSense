      I'm proud of John Kerry. He had some tough acts to follow, but he did well. After the powerhouse speeches delivered by Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Al Sharpton, and John Edwards, he had a pretty tough act to follow, and he did well. John Kerry will never be Mr. Charisma but after hearing one of his daughters talk of her dad giving CPR to a hamster that nearly drowned, and seeing photographs of Kerry with both of his daughters throughout their childhood, last night we were shown more than just the war veteran politician. His entrance to Bruce Springsteen's "No Surrender" tore me up. With all of the ups and downs of the last two weeks, hearing the words of my favorite singer as the man who is our hope for the country received a tremendous welcome from the delegates just put me away. Okay, so there was the PMS factor too, it was still a great moment.  What I do want to know is just what is Hillary Clinton's problem? Wait, let me clarify. Over the 4 days of Convention coverage, she was shown on screen many times. Once, of course, was her speech, but the rest were just shots of her in her seat watching the proceedings. The only time she didn't look bored out of her skull was when she was at the podium. These "anywhere but here" expressions on her face were not during the ramblings of some no-name speaker - they were during the speeches made by the big guns. WTF? I would have given my right arm to be there in a city that I dearly love and hear those speeches, but Hillary, who's political aspirations are coming to fruition now that her husband is done with his gig couldn't even  pretend  to be interested? I couldn't stand her before, and I really can't stand her now. It will be very, very hard for me to vote for her if she ends up as the Democratic presidential nominee in the future.  Another interview opportunity has come up, and this may be a good one. It's for a packaging company that is looking to replace someone who is retiring. It's a customer service/account rep position with a very large company. Rather than being a call center where you handle calls on a transactional basis, it's a situation where you handle client orders from start to finish, building relationships not only with the client but with the vendors who are servicing the order. It's the closest to home of any of the places I've been and that's a plus, as well as a job description that has me hopeful that it would pay reasonably well. The woman I spoke with is very nice and I have an interview next Tuesday at 8:30.  I'm still having NYGuy Angst, but will save that outpouring for another entry. What I do find interesting is that the blow-up occurred and when the dust settled I was offered a job much more quickly than I had dared to hope and I'm also going to be able to take the classes at Ohlone that I had thought I would have to put off! Yay! I admit that the Film History class is what I think of as a "carrot" class - one that is as much, if not more, for my own pleasure as for whatever requirement it may fill. Cultural Anthropology and Censorship/Literature are the other two. I imagine that they will all be a good bit of work, but the huge plus is that they are all subjects that I am very interested in. Pardon me for going all Shirley MacLaine here, but I have to wonder if the bad karma or whatever that was coming from the NYGuy situation was messing up more than I realized.  I'm looking forward to tonight. I'm going to dinner with Mommie Dearest and then on to the Paramount Theatre in Oakland to see "Jailhouse Rock." Yes, the Elvis movie. The Paramount is a restored Art Deco theater, and they show a newsreel and cartoon before the feature, and even have prize give-aways like they used to do at theaters in the '50s. Oh, and they have a bar, too. I've never been there, and I'm looking forward to seeing the theater as much as the movie. There are some great photos on their website ~  urlLink Paramount Theater . It's also the home of the Oakland Ballet and the Oakland Symphony. Looks like a pretty classy joint.

      I just got a call from the  Perfume in a Box  people about my interview yesterday.   Wouldn't you know; they offered me the job. I accepted, since in this lovely Dubbya economy I'd be crazy not to, but they did agree to an 8/16 start date so I have 2 more weeks to continue looking. The pay is a bit lower than the last place, but not by much, and the offset of the shorter commute will help even things out. The benefits plan will allow be to stay with the doctor I have been seeing for several years now, and they are going to give me the time off for a trip to Portland (Oregon) that is already booked. Could be worse. Could be better. It is a huge relief, though, to have accepted an offer.     Now if NYGuy would quit being such an anti-social bitch and call or e-mail me to tell me off about all those responses I sent him a week ago, I could rub his face in my newly re-employed status and my day would be complete. I got so tired of his whining about how hard it is to find work that this would be sweet. What he never seemed to get is that you have to be somewhat flexible and, here's the real catch,  you have to go look for it!    Seriously. He had gotten fired from a job right before we met and a couple of weeks later, I left a job. When I would tell him about places I had applied or interviews I had been called for, he would make comments about how I was going to find work before he was, and he had been out of work longer. Well no shit, Sherlock. Last I heard, there was no Job Fairy that is going to come in an leave an offer sheet under your pillow as you sleep. Like it or not, you've got to pimp yourself to the people with the jobs to fill.

      I did not sleep well at all last night. Maybe I should switch to  decaf  after 7:00pm or so, eh?      When it was time to get up and start getting ready for my interviews, I had to do some serious self-motivation to get moving. So I get my act together, get out the door and am almost at the freeway on-ramp when I realize I've forgotten my purse. Nice start.     I arrived at the first interview only to walk through the door into a cloud of horrific perfume stench. My guess is that one of the 3 women in the office had a gallon jug of one of those   "Smells just like Charlie!"   knockoffs stashed under her desk. Is there such a thing as Perfume in a Box? Being that perfume is one of my asthma triggers, there is no way I could work in that place. I played nice and did the interview, trying to convince myself that it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Well, I was wrong. The whole interview was wrong. The woman I spoke with asked me 3 different times if I had any accounts receivable experience. What really surprised me is the that this place looked pretty shoddy for a $4 million dollar a year operation. Just...well, tacky and run down. It  looked  like the sort of place that would reek of Perfume in a Box. To be even more blunt, so did the people working there. My interviewer told me that she had "just bought a home" and it was all I could do to stop myself from asking if she had found a place to park it yet. So after the chat portion ended, she asked me to take on of those personality assessment tests. My appointment was at 9:00, and I didn't get out of there till 10:15. I don't even know why I bothered with treating the test as anything serious. Now for a complete contrast...     My next interview was sooooo much better. A printing company where people were very casually dressed, but still maintained a very nice atmosphere. I liked the person I spoke with, and we seemed to hit it off pretty well. I think that the job sounds fine, and I like the location. The downside is that it doesn't pay as well as I had hoped and benefits don't kick in for 6 months. They have more interviews scheduled and will be calling people back for 2nd interviews. I took it as a good sign that she asked my availability regarding a start date.     I had a couple more calls about my resume this afternoon. One from an agency who found my resume online, and one from a recruiter who also found me online. The conversation with the recruiter sounded promising, so I may be getting a call from the company she was representing.      Convention Watch:  What I wouldn't give to be at the convention this time around. Not only is it in my beloved  Boston,  there have been some great speeches.  Barack Obama  just blew me away.  What a way to announce your presence to the national political arena! And Teresa Heinz Kerry - the more I see her, the more I like her. Ted Kennedy seemed a bit off his game. He's usually among the best and while he was good, he wasn't good enough to keep me from thinking that I haven't heard anybody's voice cracking so much since Peter Brady went through puberty. "When it's time to change, it's time to rearrange"      Hi, my name is Mary and I'm a reality TV addict.      Trading Spouses:    Could Tammy Nakamura  be  any more of a bitch? I seriously cannot stand this woman, and her TV life was only 2 hours long! Her "$50k may not be much to you or me.." comment really took the cake. I'd be willing to bet that "Let them eat cake" is embroidered on this woman's towels.          Last Comic Standing   just hasn't grabbed me the way it did last time around. I do like Anton enough to really hope that he wins, but the rest of them? I'd be hard pressed to tell you their names. Yawn.      Amazing Race    I love this show, but turned as green as the title text when the contestants were sent to St Petersburg. What is wrong with all of those people crying and gagging over the  caviar ? I would have been mad that I had to wolf it down rather than enjoy it. Okay, so it  was  a huge amount to eat, and it probably wasn't the best  caviar  in the country, but it's not like I'm used to partaking of Osetra or Beluga on a regular basis. I don't even eat the cheap stuff on a regular basis, but I do love it. Then they had to either choose between roadblocks (detours? whatever) involving either vodka or hockey ~ then to  Catherine's Palace  by horse-drawn sleigh. That would have been it for me if I were a contestant. Go on with your silly race and leave me to Russia.     No comments on  Big Brother 5  yet. I had to tape it so I could watch  Last Comic.     I don't know how long I'm going to stick with BB5. This is the first time I've watched this many episodes (about half a dozen) since BB2. I found it was taking more energy to keep up with that it was worth.     Damn, my throat is sore and raw, and I'm all congested. May all of the Perfume in a Box wearing people be forced into acute awareness of their own stench for the rest of eternity.

      It's been 5 days since my return barrage of e-mails to NYGuy, and no response. I'm surprised that he hasn't fired back, even though he said "it's over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Not like him at all to let go without getting the last word. What is making me nuts is that I don't have any way to know if he has read the e-mails, deleted them, or is just letting them sit there. He's on AOL, and I've got a different ISP and read receipts are not an option. There will be a notification sent if he picks up the e-card, but nothing so far. Yes, I admit it, I want to know if  I  got the last word in.      Did I mention that I called his cell phone on the day of the e-mail war? He didn't answer and I have to say that while I don't remember the whole message, I did start out by saying that I wasn't surprised that he didn't have the  balls  to answer. There was also mention of his own martyr issues and the advice that he may wish to seek help for that because Jews and crosses don't go well together. Hey, if he's going to read sarcasm into placed where it doesn't exist, I might as well serve it up. I've been very careful  to avoid   being sarcastic in conversations with him  because he's just a  tad   sensitive  about such things, but he insists telling me what my intentions are/were, which is pretty much guaranteed to  piss me the hell off.   I realize that things may sometimes come across in a way that was not intended, but he goes out of his way to look for the worst possible spin and then refuses to believe that what was said can be any other way than the way he wants it to be. It becomes very difficult to apologize for the miscommunication when the person who is misinterpreting blows up rather than talking it out. I do admit that I am nothing short of stunned at his  Drama Queen  reaction to the whole thing. It shouldn't have been a big surprise that I was feeling this way, as I had explained my feelings in the e-mail where I told him that I thought it best for me to bow out of the friendship. An e-mail that was never replied to, by the way. It pains me that after all the times he asked me to trust him, and asked me to please talk about anything that is bothering me rather than hold it in, I try to do just that and as a result get told that I'm psychologically damaged and that I was  "never really there."  Let this be a cautionary note to anyone in a long distance thing like this; it's a bitch when there aren't any mutual friends to shed light on something like this. Is it a pattern? Is he like this with everybody? Do other people see him as more upbeat as he thinks he is, or do they see the negative side that I have been seeing? And yeah, it would be nice to have someone to tell him that he's being and  ass.  Or someone to tell me if I have been. Or someone to tell me that I'm not. Or, more realistically, someone to tell us that we both have had a hand in it.  The complete, unedited text of the IM that started this and the resulting e-mail may be available upon request to anyone who hasn't seen a really good train wreck lately and wants a fix.  I'll stop obsessing about this. I promise. I just can't promise when. ;-)       I'm sure I wouldn't be so wound up about NYGuy if I wasn't also dealing with the unemployment thing. I could be registering to go back to school at the local community college in the fall - a plan that has had to be scrapped an upsetting me a great deal. I'm going to finish my degree even if it takes me until I'm 92, and since I'm not maxed out on the number of community college units that I can transfer over to Cal State SomewhereOrOther I figured that I might as well be as cost effective as possible. I had some good stuff picked out: Censorship in Literature, Film History, and Cultural Anthropology. Blah.     On a more positive note, I've got 2 interviews tomorrow. Both for customer service, but it's still good to know that my resume is being noticed. I've also got a phone message that was left by an agency that found my resume online and has a CS job that the would like to speak with me about, and an e-mail directly from an employer who has a position that they haven't even posted yet and they want me to interview. The e-mail was kind of obnoxious, though. "We have this job and found your resume online. What day would you like to interview, Tuesday or Wednesday?" Nothing about the company, just a link to the website, and nothing about the specifics of the job, just that it's a receptionist position. Not what I'm looking for really, but if they pay enough and the benefits are good I would take it if the hours would work with school.     So how about that  Democratic   National     Convention , huh? (yes, I know that the white text won't show up well at all, but I want red white an blue! I want an Oompa Loompa now!) If the Al Gore who spoke tonight had been the Al Gore who ran against Bush, the outcome of the election wouldn't have been left to the Supreme Court. I do love Jimmy Carter, but as a speaker, he's a great tranquilizer. And then there's Bubba. The smartest thing that the convention organizers did was have Bill Clinton speaking as far away, time-wise, from Kerry as possible. I'd vote for Bill Clinton for just about anything, anytime, anyplace. The second smartest thing they did was have that kid play  Amazing Grace  on the violin in tribute to those who died on September 11th. But still, to see Bill Clinton walking onstage as  Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow  played...very sweet flashbacks to better times.      It's 11:18pm and Mr Landlord's doorbell is ringing. I can hear it through the heat vent. This happens from time to time, but thank doG if it's a booty call or some sort of paid companionship (and what else would it be?), I most likely won't hear the gory details. There was one time that  he turned the volume on some porn up loud enough to wake the dead , but that was only one time in the years I have been here. What pissed me off about it is that the damned cheesy music and moaning woke me up at 1:30 in the morning! I was none too thrilled about the time he left some porn DVD covers in the trash so that when I lifted the lid off of the can I was confronted with  Horny Hairy Girls , vol 1  and  2.   TOO MUCH INFORMATION!  These 2 incidents were a couple of years apart, so it's not like I'm feeling harassed or anything. Quite the contrary, actually. This guy is generally pretty cool as landlords go. I was a bit startled to see that he has dyed his hair. It was salt and pepper, but now is the color of iced tea. It's not that it looks bad, but it was a rather abrupt difference. No gradual Grecian Formula plan or anything.     I'd best be getting to bed. I've got one interview at 9:00am, and another at 11:00am tomorrow and I think that getting a reasonable amount of sleep would be a good idea. What I'm really hoping for is a call from a particular company about an interview. It sounds like a great fit, both the position and the company philosophy ~        keeping my fingers crossed!

      This week has not been so good. I got fired last week, Thursday to be exact, and have been devoting my time to tracking down potential jobs and sending off resumes; online, in envelopes, wished on stars, any way I can think of. What I do not want is another customer service job. What I will probably have to do is take another customer service job since my savings are...well, I work in customer service. You do the math. Anyway, I'm okay for now and have already been contacted by a couple of call centers, but I'm going to try and stall the interviews to see if I can come up with something better in the next couple of weeks. Yes, kids, I am an example of what you will become if you don't go to college. Unless, of course, you are Walter Cronkite. He was a high school drop-out and he did okay.     Today had been planned as a sort of a break day; spend the morning checking the employment websites and then read or watch a movie. Something to de-stress. But  Nooooooo . There's this guy. In New York. I met him online in May 2001 and have spent more time online and on the phone with him than anyone I know in real life from that time on. It was good. Very, very good. Then it wasn't. It very, very wasn't. So after many thought, I sent and e-mail to him saying that since I seemed to be bringing him more hurt and anger than joy and happiness, I would bow out of his life. His response was - no response at all. No protest, no rant, no "don't let the IM door hit you on the ass..." nothing. Nada. Zip. But then...    Me being me, I couldn't leave well enough alone. I sent him a big ol' box of stuff that I had been putting together for him. A jar with some sand and shells from a beach I love, a photo of said beach, some really old (1930s) road maps, a book about an artist that we both love, a Springsteen CD, and some other things. I included a note telling him that even though we had parted ways I still wanted him to have this stuff, and that what had happened did not change what I felt for him during the time I was thinking about and collecting those items. Mistake.  BIG   mistake.     So he gets the stuff, waits a few days, and then sends a very sweet e-mail. And leaves a message in the same tone. Then I was online one night and he IMs to thank me for the stuff. Dumb move not to block him. Dumber move to go back to IMing and phone calls.  I should have left well enough alone.      Yesterday he IMd and started to complain about his sister. Again. It's his favorite topic. She showed up at his place a little over a year ago and never left. There is no reason for her to. She's been homeless (living in another state) for years, and he's always sent money to her whenever she asked. She knows that he won't say no to her. So she showed up on his doorstep 13 months ago to visit their ailing father who was being cared for by NY Guy. She's still there, their father has dies, and she's still there. The landlord gave her 10 days to get out, and Sis ignored it. She know that NYGuy will yell at her to leave but won't do a damned thing to back it up. What he was doing was complaining about her in conversation after conversation about about how resentful he is that he is supporting her. I told him if he stopped buying her cigarettes and food she would either leave or find a way to contribute. He agreed, but keeps on keeping on. More fun to whine and be used, I guess. There are other things on his gripe list and they are all aired frequently. Regularly. Almost constantly. So he was complaining and I was stressing hard about where my September rent is going to come from, where a new job might be found, how I'm going to tell my family about my firing without causing them any more worry thatn necessary, and apparantly I wasn't responding properly to NYG's his needs.     He stomped out of the IM in a hissy fit.     I wrote an e-mail.     He replied with 10.     Yes, 10 replies. Telling me just what an awful person I am. Let's see; I'm void of compassion, self absorbed, and psychologically damaged. There were more, but you get the jist. So, you are asking what I said in my e-mail? I said that he has spent a great deal more time complaining about his life than I think he realizes, and that I feel like my only worth to him is as his personal venting outlet. What I think really peeved him though is that I ended by asking if he ran away from our IM to another screen name, like maybe SelfishPutz100? (yes, he has an annoying tendency to end his screen names with "100").     Anywhoo, he has declared the friendship dead since he cannot be friends with someone who would send such a sarcastic e-mail. Oh, I'm also a horrible rotten person for not sending him a sympathy card or e-mail (yes, he said e-mail!) when his father died. Apparently the fact that when I found out that his father had been hospitalized I was spending my breaks and lunches calling him to make sure he was okay were not sufficient. The calls I made on my way to work didn't count for much either, I guess. That I regularly told him that I was sorry for his loss and all he had gone through were not nearly as meaningful as a mass produced  Hallmark  card would have been. Should I have sent a card? In hindsight, I guess I should have. But to say that not having done so means that I am thoughtless and self-centered is way off the mark. I gave and gave and gave, and am being punished for not having given enough. He's told me many times that he doen't stand on convention or ceremony, and to limit yourself to such things squelches individuality. So he will find 20, yes 20, e-mails in his box. He may delete them all, but at least it will give him tendinitis or something in the process. The main point of my replies is that I am surprised to know that these are his thoughts about my character after all this time, and even more surprised that he would spend so much time with such a horrible person as me. Also that it saddens me to know that even if he didn't find me so vile he would rather throw away a 3 year friendship than consider that there may be another way to view a situation than his, and that if he had paid attention he would have noticed the part where  I said I may not be remembering things 100% accurately either  since reality is usually different than either person's recollection. Also too bad that he doesn't realize that I can't see him as the "positive, upbeat" person he insists that he is if he only shows me the negative "my whole family is cursed and I don't know how much more I can take" side.     Oh, wait, I almost left out the best part. He ended one of the e-mails by saying that I don't realize what I "could have had." Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Pretty safe to pull a statement like that out of your ass once you've announced the end of a relationship.    If he aggravates me so much, why does this hurt so bad?      Coffee  is my comfort food. I'm gonna go make me a whole lot of it.

      Every day this week I have had the thought that I need to pay some attention to this blog, but every time I sat down at the computer I ended up on salon.com or one of a number of my other favorite sites. I've been avoiding some subjects. Okay, so one subject in particular. Bet you can't guess which one!  It's been tough for me to come to grips with the who NYGuy thing. He made me hurt, and that made me mad because if I had stuck to my guns the first time it wouldn't be so bad, and then add to that the fact that even though there were things that needed to be fixed, I really miss him and I end up with quite an emotional quagmire. I spent a really great evening with my sister yesterday, and told her about what happened. She was wonderful. She always is. Not only does she really listen, but she is honest and empathetic, and it was a huge help to talk to her about all of this. I haven't talked to anyone else about it, but it felt really good to finally be able to. I just wasn't ready to before.  My new job starts tomorrow. I'm extremely concerned with the possibility of asthma problems. I've gone back on Advair and also the generic version of Claritin, and am going to make the best of it.  I also start classes at the community college tomorrow. Nothing like a new job and going back to school all on the same day, huh? Tomorrow night it's an Censorship in Literature. I'm really looking forward to it, and am glad that I was able to find some classes that really interest me for my first semester back.  The last 2 jobs I've had all began with a call from NYGuy to wish me well and encourage me on my first day. How come I miss him so much when things were so difficult for the last year? Shouldn't I feel better about this? Or at least less bad?  Damn it, now I'm crying again.

      I didn't sleep well at all last night. I don't think I slept more than an hour at a time without waking up thanks to some random abdominal discomfort. I'm feeling better now, but I've been crabby all day thanks to the lack of sleep.  The guy from EDD (unemployment) did call me back yesterday. I'm not feeling too hopeful about getting payments. He was very nice and everything, but as expected, my former employer told him some things that just aren't true - about "written policy" that does not exist.  Nothing  in that department is documented. My manager and I discussed that very thing at my review two days before she fired me! I was the one who brought it up and suggested that a procedure manual be written since the plan was to expand the department from a staff of 8 up to 40 for the Christmas season. She thought that was an excellent suggestion, as there is nothing even remotely like written documentation for anything in Customer Service.  Tomorrow I'm taking a bunch of framed prints that I got while working at Allposters.com (yep, that's my former employer) over to my sister's house. She's having a garage sale and since I've just got most of this stuff sitting in the back of my closet anyway, so I might as well see if I can get some money for them. One of the perks of working there was that we could have framed items that were returned ~ free of charge.  It's been 3 weeks now and I'm still annoyed that I left a framed print that I really loved behind when I left work on that last day. It was a Bettman photograph titled "Gems of Manhattan," a night photograph of some buildings on the edge of Central Park. I loved that print and was too upset to think to take it off of my cube wall. I left behind some unframed prints as well. Most of those I am okay with, since my wall space is limited, but my favorite of the bunch was a black and white photo of the Empire State Building. I love the Empire State Building. I need to get over this. Might be easier if "Gems of Manhattan" hadn't been a $75 print that, with framing on it would have cost $150. Not only is that not something that fits into my budget, but to add insult to self-inflicted injury, the print isn't even listed on the Allposters website anymore.  It's warmer than necessary in here, and I'm too grouchy to type anymore.

      Wow. I didn't realize that so much time had passed since my last post. Nothing much to tell at this point. It's been nice to have some work-free days between being offered a job and starting work, but I'm stressing pretty hard about money at the moment. I did file for unemployment when I got axed, but they have to go thorough a whole big investigation deal to decide if they are going to approve benefits. I had my phone interview on Tuesday, and the gentleman I spoke with told me that he had hoped to have everything wrapped up and a decision made by the end of this week. I just returned from running errands and found a message from him asking me to return his call and now my stomach is in knots. All I can do is be honest with him, as I was in my interview, and hope for the best. The amount of the payment I would receive is not large, but it would be immensely helpful. What has me really frightened is that my former employer is  very  vindictive, and I have no idea what they may have told the Employment Development Department people. If I don't get the unemployment money, it could screw up my ability to go back to school in the fall and make things really tough for a couple of months.  blah   I've spent quite a bit of time obsessing about the situation with the guy in New York. I was fine with it a whole lot faster when I was the one who called it quits. Then he came nosing around being a sweet and cute and stuff and I bought right back into it. I guess what it comes down to is that he is so quick to throw everything out over his perception of the tone of an e-mail. No talking about it to see if I truly intended it to be as sarcastic as he perceived (I honestly didn't.), as well as his usual habit of twisting whatever he can into the most negative perception he can come up with and applying it to the entire history of our friendship. I was very clear to specify in my e-mail to him that I was talking about a specific time frame and that I did my level best to understand the pressures on him during that time. What my difficulty was with was his relentless complaining about the same situations over and over and over. To top it off, the main issue he was having is one that he could have taken control of had he chosen to do so. He didn't and he's certainly entitled to that choice, but damn it, if you are going to let somebody use you as a means of support then take responsibility for that decision and shut the hell up about it once in awhile. Everybody needs to vent sometimes, but to let it dominate every conversation? Oy vey. I did get an e-mail notification that he picked up the e-card I sent as part of my response to his 10 e-mail tirade. I'm betting that he read the rest of my responses, but I don't have any way to know. It does make me feel better to know for sure that he at least read that one. I've not gotten any sort of reaction from him, and that's fine. What I am hoping that means is that he's realized that he had a hand in things going wrong, too, and that he's giving it thought. Based on past experience with him I know that when he feels that he has been wronged, a tantrum is to follow. When he has understood my view and even partially agreed, he usually does not acknowledge it directly (Yes, it's one of those Men are from Mars things) but does, in the course of conversation, let me know indirectly that he's aware and acknowledging whatever bump in the road we had hit. Of course he may not have answered because he really doesn't want to have anything further to do with me. That's okay, too. At this point I think it may be what's best. He had become so reactive to everything over the last year that it was hard to know what to say, or how to say it, without it triggering him to become upset about something going on with his home situation. And that was even with general topics, not things specific to him. I'm feeling bad -guilty, I guess- that I was not able to provide the amounts of unconditional support that he wanted, but I know I need to get over that. I'm human too, and like everyone else, I have limits as to what I am physically and emotionally able to do.  Once again, blah.   I had a job interview on Tuesday for a position that I think I might actually like. I just hope that the interviewers liked me enough to keep my resume at the top of the pile as they go through the interview process. I did consider it a positive thing that once the department manager completed her interrogation, she had me speak with 2 other managers as well. If she had thought I was not suited for the job, I doubt she would have had them take the time to talk to me. It's an account rep position with a company that sells packaging (bottles and containers for perfume, shampoo, and probably lots of other stuff) and the things I really like about the company are; 1. they do not manufacture the stuff they sell, so as the middle people they promote their attention to customer service very heavily and value the people who actually do that job (so they say) and 2. they have offices all over the country, including Paramus, NJ, and Boston - both places I would love to live. :::crossing fingers:::  It's been an hour and 20 minutes since I left the message for the unemployment guy. I know that he was probably on lunch most of that time, but I'm getting more and more nervous about the outcome as the minutes go by. More later...
