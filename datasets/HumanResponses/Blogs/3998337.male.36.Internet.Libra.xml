          "The ONE Thing That Separates the Men from the Boys in the Google AdWords Game"  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is ONE central idea, one key concept that Google wants you to understand.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have this right, Google will literally reward you by giving you lower prices on clicks, and your customers will reward you by buying what you have to sell.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you DON'T have this right, you'll pay way too much for clicks, your campaigns will get disabled, and your whole Google experience will be unpleasant.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing that matters on Google is relevance.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might think of this as "message to market match."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will make complete sense once you understand a bit of Google's history.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google started in 1998, after the "big boys" in the search engine game like Yahoo and AltaVista were well-established.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, few people would have bet that Google would overtake them all - but in five years they have done exactly that.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's even more remarkable is they did so without a bunch of hype and loud marketing.&nbsp; They literally built a better mousetrap and the world beat a path to their door.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what happened?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google's mission in life was to build a search engine that would give people exactly what they were searching for, as fast as possible.&nbsp; If you were searching for "California butterflies" they wanted to give you the very best and most popular California butterfly websites on the very first page of results.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They developed an amazing mathematical formula for figuring out who visited websites and why, and using that information in their search engine.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So.... when they began to sell Pay Per Click advertising, they were extremely concerned that advertisers also put out messages that were highly relevant.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google rewards you for being relevant, and they let people who are searching vote for you.&nbsp; If your ad gets clicked on, it's relevant.&nbsp; If it doesn't, it's not.&nbsp; It's that simple.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can't get 5 out of 1000 people (0.5%) to click on your ad, Google disables your ad.&nbsp; The higher your click thru rate, though, the less you have to pay for the position you want.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this creates a "Darwinian" effect, a deliberate natural selection that weeds out bad advertisers and rewards good ones.&nbsp; What's good for Google's customers is good for Google and good for you.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all the dust has settled, what really matters is that your ads and your content be relevant to the keywords you're bidding on.&nbsp; Your message must match what the person is thinking.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So... what were they really thinking when they typed in "California butterflies?"&nbsp; That is the question.&nbsp; Figure that out and put it in front of them, and you'll win on Google.&nbsp; Write an ad that matches exactly what they're searching for and you'll beat your competitors by a country mile.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow's installment is called  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How Changing ONE Word Can Cut Your Bid Prices Nearly in Half!"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;Regards & Good Googling.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.adwordsmarketing.com
