      I posted this under Sweetwater results, but it'll probably get lost.  Please let me know if you have paid the $14 tournament fee for Sweetwater.  I know that Angela, Kate, Eric and possibly Wood have paid.  If you haven't paid, please do so at skills/drills tonight.  Thanks!

      Rival's first charity poker tournament was a success.  We had 16 entrants and made $200.  We can either put this money straight towards tourney fees, or look to using it to buy discs to sell.  Maybe a disc with a bomb on it.  Also, let's start looking at dates to host the next tournament.

      Looks like we finally have enough dues in to buy jerseys. (Note: if you haven't paid your dues yet, please do so, Bill and I are still in the red and we still need money to get the jerseys printed.)  If anyone wants an extra set of jerseys or would like me to order some other underarmour stuff (click on the title link to see what the place carries) for them, you need to let me know by the end of the day thursday.  Also, if anyone knows a place to get the jerseys printed, let me know, I'm going to start trying to get quotes.

      We're having skills practice at MLK on Wednesday at 7pm again.  Hope to see lots of people out there.  The current plan is to go over some specific skills as a group, then let people break up into smaller groups and work on the individual skills they want to work on (hucking, throwing against a mark, etc.)  Also, please remember to get your dues to Bill, we still don't have enough to buy jersey's yet.  Last thing, the beginnings of the offensive playbook is up.  Currently it only has Spiderman in it but please check it out, especially if you missed practice this weekend.

      Well we have returned from Sunbowl . . . victorious.  There were four games Saturday, and we won all of them.  The closest game Saturday was against Soul Patrol from Augusta.  A bunch of people that we have seen before (Chip, Spencer, Greg Murray, Driver, Jess, etc.) and will see again at Sectionals.  The game was 12-10 Rival.  Sunday there were only two rounds, which was fine for everyone since it was so f-ing hot.  First round we played a team that we had dispatched Saturday with relative ease.  They showed up in new jerseys in an attempt to break our mental game but fortunately we were not so easily diswayed.  In the finals we saw Soul Patrol again, and after being down at half and trading points for much of the game we took the last two to win 15-13.  We ran the SUPERMAN offense, and although I'm sure the opinions will vary, it worked reasonably well at first, but eventually smarter teams recognized it and adjusted.  The other pitfall it had was the it could be a lot of running, and by the end of the game the routes were falling apart.  To solve the monotony of the offense we have and will incorporate more things to do from that set.  To get rid of the running we'll get in better shape and learn to run more efficiently.    The tournament was a success, not only because we won, had a good time, now get to call Katrina fun names, worked on our offense, but in the end we were all better people . . . although I'm not sure how.

      Sunbowl games start at 9:30.  Be there and be ready to warmup by 9.  If you miss the warmup you will be benched for the first game.  Directions to the fields: North on I-85 Take the SC-28 W exit, exit number 19B, towards CLEMSON. Merge onto US-76 W. Once you reach Clemson (coming from HWY-76 or Hwy-123)……need to get on HWY-123 north towards Greenville. Get off on Isaqueena exit only a mile or two down the road, take a right. Go down Isaqueena Trail for about a ½ mile, the road will fork at a church, take the left fork which is Nettles Road….take nettles road for a ½ mile and Nettles Park will be on the left can’t miss it. The soccer fields are all the way in the back.  The Hotel is the Holiday Inn Express on I-85, exit 19B, same as you'll use for the fields.  It's behind the Wendy's.  See everyone tonight or tomorrow morning.

      We will be starting track workouts relatively soon, and we need to make sure that we are in the proper shape to get the most out of them.  Track workouts are a common place of injury if people are not prepared so the following is what I want you to do to get ready for the track workouts.  This does not apply to everyone, obviously people are at different levels already and some people are already doing their own track workout.  If this is you then don't worry about this, just continue what you are doing as long as it isn't too much.  I'll leave that decision up to you.  For those that aren't doing something already and need to get ready this is what I suggest:  We need to build a base right now.  So what I want you to be doing before track workouts is running FOR TIME, not for distance.  Start out some where between 10 and 15 minutes at a comfortable pace (sub 8 min/mile).  Run every other day, I know that might seem like a lot but you need to do it.  The goal here is to ease into run for 20 minutes straight at a good pace.  The way I want you to do it is if the last two runs felt good (weren't significantly fatigued at the end and no muscle issues) then either up your time or up your pace.  So a progression might look like this:  Mon 10 min @ 7min/mil    Felt good Wed 10 min @ 7min/mil   Felt good Fri    15 min @ 7min/mil   Tired, sore hamstring Mon  15 min @ 7min/mil    Felt good Wed  15 min @ 7min/mil   Felt good Fri     15 min @ 6.5 min/mil  Felt good  Hopefully this makes sense.  The last element of this is I want you to be stretching both before and AFTER you are done.  The streching before can be light, and can include at 2-3 minute walk to get the blood going.  After the run I want you to strech, especially your hip flexor, quads, calfs, hamstrings and back.  These are long stretches, get to a comfortable length, then hold it for a minute, pul the stretch a little bit father if you like then hold it for another 30 seconds.  At no point should you be straining to hold a stretch, if that is the case then you are risking injury which is what we are trying to avoid.  The reason for the held stretch is that for the first 45 seconds you are stretching muscle, which is fine, but for the last 45 you are stretching tendons and ligaments and that is where you get good gains in flexibility.

      Man, I'm glad Lori wrote something about the engagement.&nbsp; I been curious as to why nothing had been said yet.  But back to seriousness.&nbsp; We're going to be doing more track workout stuff this week.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we're going to be at MLK wednesday, which means no actual track and no distances, so the mentality will have to switch a bit.&nbsp; Rather than running distance at a feeling (between moderately hard and hard), we'll be running a time at the same pace.&nbsp; This will change if we end up being at grady, but here's the idea for this week:  &nbsp; We are keeping everything at the same pace as last week.&nbsp; Just short of your 10 k, right around your aerobic threshold.&nbsp; It should be hard, but not really hard.&nbsp; The other difference is that we'll be taking a more active "cool down" in between runs.&nbsp; The times are as follows:  WARM-UP with a few laps of walking/jogging mixed with stretching 2:00 on at pace  2:00 walking  4:00 on at pace 4:00 walking 2:00 break 2:00 on at pace 2:00 walking 4:00 on at pace 4:00 walking 4:00 on at pace 4:00 walking 2:00 break 8:00 on at pace  that's about&nbsp;44 minutes of action.&nbsp; May seem like a lot, but the breaks are factored in and we spent about that long last week.&nbsp; See you all wednesday.

      So we need to start doing track workouts.&nbsp; Many of you already have been doing stuff on your own, and have a good/great program.&nbsp; If that is you, then keep doing your thing.&nbsp; People on our team are all over the place as far as where they should start in a track program, so this is designed as a pretty middle ground (you've already got a decent base), endurance building to speed development program.&nbsp; It has a bunch of stuff in/behind it that might be pretty new.&nbsp; If anyone has questions about it just ask me and I'll be happy to explain.&nbsp; So here's the program this week:  Always warm up properly!!!&nbsp; Stretch a bit, but definetely go for a few laps and a walk/jog/run progression.&nbsp; People get hurt at track workouts by not being warm and not pacing their progress, don't let that happen to you.  The workout this week is 4 x 800's followed by 1 x 1600.&nbsp; The pacing for all of these is NOT as hard as you can run them.&nbsp; We are building endurance so there is a specific threshold that you should be running at.&nbsp; It can be hard to describe, and is different for everyone but here are some guidelines to what this run should be like.  One way to think of it is that these should be run at 10-k pace, maybe a few seconds slower per mile.&nbsp; I personally have no idea what my 10-k pace is, but if you do that is one way to think about it.&nbsp; Another is that you should be running at 85% of your maximum heart rate (if you have a heart monitor that is a lot easier).&nbsp; The "easiest" way to figure this out is using the Borg scale (Rate of Percieved Exertion).&nbsp; Here's the scale:  6 7 - Very, very light 8 9 - Very light 10 11 - Fairly light 12 13 - Moderately hard 14 15 - Hard 16 17 - Very hard 18 19 - Very, very hard 20 - Exhaustion  point 6 would be the equivalent of sitting down doing nothing, 9 would be walking gently, 13 a steady exercising pace and 19/20 the hardest exercise you have ever done.  We are looking for something around 13-14 so moderately hard to hard.&nbsp;   &nbsp; O.k. so again:  4 x 800 1 x 1600  all at 13-14 RPE with plenty of rest in between (anywhere from 1-2 times your run time).&nbsp;   Sorry this is so long, this is what happens when you sit at your computer all day doing rehab.

I asked the secretary about parking and she said there might be parking on that side of the street, otherwise folks can park and walk from the HS.

      Rival's second poker tournament will be held this Sunday at 4:30 at Lauren's house (Lauren can you post directions?).  Please recruit your friends to come play.  You need to email  urlLink Drew  to let him know if you and/or a friend are coming.  We'll need tables, chairs, and for you to bring snack food with you if you come.  The deal is it's a $20 buyin and that winners are encouraged to donate some/all of their winnings to the team.

      We need to decide on a logo soon.  Our options are keeping the same logo from last year or using a new one that someone makes.  We have a few new logos so far, and will let everyone vote on what they want soon.  If anyone would like to send in a logo for consideration, let me know.

      As some of you may have read in my comment to Crystal's sponsorship post, we are now being sponsored by Patagonia.  This means we get our jerseys for really cheap and we will no longer be getting Underarmour jerseys (though we'll still get their shorts).  The Patagonia sizes are a little more standard than the Underamour it looks like, so some might want to switch back to an extra large.  Click on the title link to see what the jersey's look like and see the sizing info.  Also, you can track down Bonk this weekend, they have the same jerseys.  If you don't tell me you want to change sizes, I'm going to guess, hopefully it won't be a big deal to exchange.  Ladies, we're just getting men's through the deal, but they do have extra smalls.

      I've finished making a sponsorship packet to try raise money for us and have gone to several places in town to give them out.  It's really time consuming, so I need your help distributing them.  If you have the chance, please ask your work or local businesses about sponsorship.  Email me if you're interested, and I'll give you the link to the packet.  A lesson I've learned...when approaching companies, tell them we're interested in advertising for them and emphasize that we travel all over which would give them tons of exposure.  If you mention sponsorship, they usually are reluctant to hear you out since they automatically think of donations/charity.  Here's a list of places I've already gone to/contacted: Adidas, Coke, Delta, Footlocker, Kroger, Publix, Red bull, Sam's club, Sports Authority, Target, Underarmour, Wachovia, Walmart (Cobb), Mac's liquour store, Spa Sydell, Whole foods (Ponce)  Places people should hit: Duprees, Fellini's, Loca Luna, Park Tavern, Radio Stations, Soccer store (Decatur)  Thanks!

      I'd like to welcome a new member to the Rival team.  Martha McLain needed some time off this summer to recover from the college season, but she's back and ready to help Rival get to Nationals.  I know you'll all treat her like family, and hopefully it'll help us get enough women at practice :)

      Wow, is it week 4 already?  This is going to be the last week of this endurance stuff.  Hopefully people have been doing this on top of other running so our pacing should be getting better.  Here's the work out  2:00 warm-up stretch walk/jog 8:00 on at pace 4:00 walking 2:00 on at pace 2:00 walking 8:00 on at pace 6:00 walking 2:00 on at pace 2:00 walking 8:00 on at pace 4:00 walking  IMPORTANT:  As we're getting better with this our pace should be getting better.  The effort should still be the same (around 13 or 14, between moderately hard and hard), but the speed should be increasing a bit as we get better at this.   Well, that's it.  Hopefully I will see you all out there.  If not, run this on your own.  M

      Making a topic where everyone can list their tickets for Austin. Those wanting to drive can try and organize that here as well. Currently Delta costs $303. Rumor has it there is only one flight out of Austin at 7pm and that we should get our tickets before that flight fills up as it is the last one of the day and the earlier flights could prevent playing in the later games Sunday.  Please post your flight itinerary here so we can make sure everyone has a ride in a rental car at the appropriate time. We'll make a link to this on one of the menu bars so we'll be able to easily access it.

      Making a topic where everyone can list their tickets for Chicago.  Those wanting to drive can try and organize that here as well.  Currently Delta costs $222 and Airtran costs $216.  Please post your flight itinerary here so we can make sure everyone has a ride in a rental car at the appropriate time/airport.  We'll make a link to this on one of the menu bars so we'll be able to easily access it.

      Right, so we have this scrimmage on top of the workout, which means that we will decrease the volume a bit.  We're still working on endurance so I want people to run at the same pace.   Since we are at MLK we will be running times again rather than distances. Here are the times:  Stretching 2:00 walk/jog as a warm-up 8:00 on at pace 6:00 walking 4:00 on at pace 4:00 walking 2:00 on at pace 2:00 walking 8:00 on at pace Cool Down  And that's that.  We'll be doing this stuff for the next few weeks.  Whenever we make it back to Grady there will be ladder and form work for us to do.  M

      Just wanted to remind everyone about the scrimmage tomorrow currently scheduled for 7pm at MLK.  We're trying to get Coan Rec, but no word yet.  Try to check the blog tomorrow afternoon to make sure we're still at MLK.  Also, please let me know if you will be unable to attend.  We should have the track workout up soon.  Also, we do have practice this weekend, 10-2 on both days.  Again, don't have a definite location yet, and again, please let me know if you will miss practice.

      Hopefully this will be the last post of the day.  Most of you probably know that our own Amy Smith and Greg Swanson are over in Finland right now playing for the Junior National team at Worlds.  Both teams are undefeated currently.  Check the afdc forum for a write-up from Mark Swanson and click on the link above to see scores.  It sounds like they're both playing great.

      From Lee...  Everyone must be current on their UPA membership and have a current waiver on file with the UPA.  You can check the status of both at  www.upa.org/members .  I have also printed out a roster page which everyone will need to sign and fill out.  If you owe any dues or don't have a current waiver on file, they need to be sent in with the roster page as well as.  I need everyone to fill this out by our Revelry & Rivalry tournament.  If we are late, our region could lose out on a possible extra bid and we will be charged with a late fee.  DO NOT BE LATE!

      I'm not sure why, but I get the nagging feeling that not everyone knows the scoop on team shorts. Thank god I have the blog to dessiminate this kind of information so people don't feel it's necessary to ask me over and over again about it.  I need everyone's short size. Click  urlLink here  to see the shorts and for help on sizing. For the women, if you hate the idea of wearing the regular shorts, you can check out  urlLink their supply of women's shorts.   Email me what size you want, and if you want a different style (you may have to pay extra for some alternate styles).

      Good work this weekend everyone.  We lost in the finals to Olio, a team out of North Carolina.  It was a great first half, but the dreaded army clothes showed up in the second half and took their toll on our throws and hands.  I think we learned a huge amount this weekend, and everyone seems to be getting more comfortable with the new offenses.  They both looked really good when we were able to run them correctly.  Defensively people got the opportunity to play lots of different positions in the d's.  I think we have lots of room for improvement but made a great start this weekend.  Overall 6-2 on the weekend, we improved a huge amount, keep it up Rival!
