      So today is my second day in Chicago.&nbsp; I haven't seen much of the city, as I am working a LOT right now.&nbsp; We are trying to make the transition from the close of this tour to the opening of the new one as easy as possible.&nbsp; That is like trying to teach an old dog new tricks....as soon as you think you are caught up........something breaks.  I arrived in Chicago yesterday to join my current tour.&nbsp; My plane landed at 3:30pm.&nbsp; I should have been to the hotel by 4:15.&nbsp; Instead, I didn't get here until 5:40.&nbsp; That was due to traffic.&nbsp; Now, don't get me wrong...my cabbie was doing all he could to get me here on time.&nbsp; He would cut through traffic, speed up, slow down, take the car up onto the curb....you name it.&nbsp; That is what I call service...even if you feel your life is at stake.  Upon arrival, I got to watch the show last night.&nbsp; Now for those of you who know what show it is, DON'T TELL.&nbsp; I am just going to leave little clues and see who can guess it.&nbsp; Yeah right, like THAT many people read my little journal.&nbsp; Anyway, here's one clue...the show runs ALMOST three hours.  It is great, but that is almost longer than Les Miserables...the longest show EVER!!!....oops another clue.  So now I am here, trying to learn everyone's names, who does what, who's butt to kiss....and all that jazz.&nbsp; I am sure things will get much more interesting as time passes.

      So, things are definitley changing for me right now.  I just found out I am on the finialists list for the job at the state performing arts center, but then I was just called yesterday and offered another job going out on the road.  I swore to myself I would not travel again.  I said I was over it, that I wanted to settle down.  When the prospect of traveling again came up though, I totally perked up.  I think once you get traveling in your blood, you just can't get rid of it.  There is something about the excitement of going city to city, and being a part of something that is such an event in each town...it really is great.  Just when I think I don't want to do it anymore, I meet someone or I have a great night, and it propells me on.  Of course, this will change the whole reason for my blog.  They say change is good...  There is one catch in this whole plan.  I haven't told anyone this....I think Cortney knows.  Since I have been home, well for the past month anyway, there is a guy......  We are talking and want to start dating.  I think we may be falling for each other.  We really balance each other out.  We can see ourselves settling down and establishing a life together.  This is of course, only expostulation.  Things can change and go awry.  If I leave, this will sabotage us before we get a chance to see if it was going to work.  I don't want to put too much pressure on us, but I really feel good about this, like it could really really work out.  Then again, so can the road...  I would love to settle down with Scott in the distant future.  I don't want to stay here and date and then wish I had gone out on the road.  Nor do I want to go on the road and lose Scott.  I know this is a lot of pressure, when we are barely dating, but one can't help but think of what could've been.  Things at home were boring, I guess you should be careful what you ask for, huh?

      Have you ever seen the movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray?  I feel like I have been sucked into the cellophane captured story it portrays.  I am trying to save money, get an apartment, pay some student loans, get ready to spend quite a bit of time here at home.  This all depends on one thing....getting a job.  I have my resume out to hundreds upon hundreds of places nationwide.  As a matter of fact, I could've sworn I saw it lining the bottom of a hampster cage the other day.  I have three companies that want me to work for them.  The one job I really want to land, hasn't told me yes or no for sure yet.  I NEED TO KNOW, the three others aren't going to wait forever.  But I dont' want to pressure them for fear of running them off.  I don't want them thinking I am some great control freak.  Even if I am, they don't have to know. LOL  I feel like my life is in some great holding pattern right now.  I go to sleep, I wake up, I go to sleep, I wake up.  I feel like my future is in the hands of an executive sitting in an office.  The kicker is...they don't know that my future seems to be hanging in the balance.  It is like the beginning of some great Greek Tragedy.  I have to put everything else on hold until someone from the great concrete jungle decides to call me.  I don't know how to react, or even to proceed.  Maybe I just have to keep living in this holding pattern until fate decides I get it right...thanks Bill Murray!!!!

      So, here we go.  This is my first posting on my new blog.  (It seems so official.)  For those of you who don't know me, I will give a little background.  For those of you that do, bear with me, you have heard this all before.  I grew up in a small town in Tennessee called McEwen.  Now when I say small, I mean small.  We have a Sonic, a Dairy Queen, a funeral home, countless churches and four gas stations...all on one street.  But no stoplights...not one!  My graduating class had a total of 70 people.  Now, I know there are folks out there that have me beat in the "small town" department, but when you grow up here and it is all you know...it seems like the smallest place on earth.  Especially when you are 18, out of high school and ready to face the "real world" they prepared you for in school.  (Which, by the way, is NOTHING like they said it would be.)In a nutshell, it is the kind of town where you go to church just because, everyone who is anyone is at the Friday night high school football games, sweet tea flows like water, and when someone dies we bake the family a nice casserole that will freeze nicely...to help them along.  I spent most of my life growing up with my Mother, Stepfater, and two Stepbrothers.  My biological father passed away when I was eleven.  My relationship with my Mother is sacred, I would trade it for nothing in the world.  It goes above and beyond anything I can describe in words.  My Stepbrothers and I are great.  I usually just refer to them as my brothers, seeing as how I changed their diapers.  They are now 13 and 14.  I, by the way, am 24.  My relationship with my Stepfather is....strained and rocky at best.  I spent 13 years (counting Kindergarten) in the Humphreys County School System.  It was unique.  I was kind of a loner.  It wasn't until high school that I really made friends.  You will probably see their names mentioned, but none as much as Cortney.  She is my Best Friend, and will always be.  Not only was she there in the tumultous years of high school, but beyond.  Every new idea I had and change I underwent, she supported me 110%.  I am eternelly grateful for that.  McEwen High was kind of like the school that time forgot.  All the boys played sports and joined Ag.  All the girls were cheerleaders or basketball players, or they were in Future Homemakers of America.  For my first two years there, the Business Professionals of America club was still only a way to prepare girls for the local secretarial pool, if they didn't have any other marketable skills.  Football, basketball, and baseball were the only three sports offered.  It was a very direct formula for high school life, and anyone who differed from this equation would see reprocussions.  After high school, I attended the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  Those four years were the most tumultuous years of my life.  I, like so many others, underwent so many changes.  I discovered there was a LOT of life outside of my tiny caticlysm of a town, and it was waiting for me to grab it.  I found my calling, to work in Theatre and Entertainment.  I found my personality.  I came out of my shell, a process I go through every day.  I came out of the closet.  I learned about where I wanted to go in life, and what kind of person I wanted to become.  I learned what I look for in another person to love.  And I learned that the most valuable investment you can make is an investment in people.  I would go more in depth with my college experience, but would be here all night.  After college, the fun didn't stop.  I went on the road with touring productions.  I did theatre and company management for theatrical and arena tours of Sesame Street Live and The Full Monty.  This took me to so many great cities over two years.  New York, Austin, Dallas, Hollywood, San Fransisco...the list goes on and on.  These two years were kind of like the payoff.  I was finally seeing the world.  I was working at a job I loved, and meeting some of the most unique people ever.  These two years would truly shape my view on the world.  I felt as though I was grabbing life by the throat and taking all I could from it...all that it owed me.  Those two years are over now, and through a series of circumstances I have found myself back in the same town that I left what seems so long ago, back in the same house with my Mother, Stepfather, two Stepbrothers, and now a Stepsister.  My personality, life, view, and demeanor have all changed.  They are clashing with this town and family every day.  I hope that this blog will provide me an outlet for the frustration, comedy, beauty, and overall strangeness that I see.  Also, I want it to simply be a record of my daily life.  Hopefully, I can acheive a balance of the two.  Well, if you have gone this far, congrats and thank you.  I ASSURE you my postings will not be this long as a norm, altough I can't guaruntee there won't be a rant every now and then.  I hope you find my life as interesting and ironic as I do. :o)  Thanks

      I am still in Milwaukee, but I have to post something, and I want everyone who reads this to spread the message. I am 24 years old, but this year is the first time that I have really taken an active part in an election. This election is too important to sit by. Can the country really take four more years of W. Bush? I think that it is no secret that I am a Democrat. There is a GREAT radio station out there called Air America. If you don't have the station, you can listen over the Internet at  urlLink www.airamericaradio.com . Now, this is definitley run by the democrats, but it is eye opening radio, from both sides of the election. It begs to be listened to. Go there....listen...draw your own conclusions...just be active in this election. If you are not registered to vote, you can do it online now. Go to  urlLink www.declareyourself.org . This is nonpartisan website that allows you to register to vote and even register for absentee voting. You now have no excuse. lol Also, this website provides a non biased view on where the candidates stand on many issues. I normally don't get on a soapbox like this...but for those who are middle class, working guys and gals, gay, straight, who know someone in the Armed Forces, who are struggling to make ends meet...generally most of America.....you can't afford NOT to vote in this election....please do. I know this sounds like a public service announcement, but if you got this far, thank you for reading.

      Wow, the last time I was here there was like a thousand feet of snow on the ground. Now it is just raining. Things here are getting crazy.....a have a thousand different people needing a thousand different things from me, and none of them are being clear about what they want AUUGGHHHH.........i am drowning in a sea of information.  There are three legs of flights I am trying to book, and no one can give me the information that I need to completley book any of them. But oh well, such is the life of micro management. LOL. I am just thankful that I have a job to complain about.  Milwaukee is a great city, I have been here once before. I went to a bar last night that I was in back in January. It is the greatest little place. It has NO sign and NO windows, you just have to know where it is located and go in. Very low key, hush hush kinda thing. The secret of this place, though, is that it has the best jukebox in the whole city..so naturally I was there. They have the usual gay bar fare....Barbara, Bette, any musical made after 1960....But they also have some of the best indy music I have ever heard...it is wonderful. It creates a great atmosphere, that no one really wants to destroy. The feeling there is one of talking, meeting others, sharing ideas, and just relaxing. It is very nice.  That is all for now...talk again soon  Thought for the day: "When you take dancing lessons, you learn steps and you learn steps and you learn steps. It can take a long time. And then one day, you just learn to dance, and it is so different." DISCUSS!!!!
