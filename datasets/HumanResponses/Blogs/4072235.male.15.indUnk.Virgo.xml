      As I said in an earlier post, while in London, i had my wallet pickpocketed. I hope the lovely gentleman who did this gets run over by a steamroller and leaves his wife to pick him off the ground with a shovel, as if he wasnt an illegal immigrant but rather a hilarious coyote. i wasnt too upset about the wallet thing, until i fucking realized about the shit inside. Literally for like ten minutes after finding out about the wallet getting stolen I just sat with a smile on my face, the kind you have before you take out several pipe bombs out of your coat and massacre a small Colorado school. I was pondering about what was in it. Basically I lost a hundred bucks, my permit, my credit card, and like 6 different library cards. My parents encourage me to read but i choose to be an illiterate nothing and sit at home looking at pictures of 40 year old internet whores claiming to be 18.  Out of the stolen articles the only one I was really pissed about was the permit. I quickly canceled the credit card (I wish i was there for the moment the thief attempts to impress his slightly retarded pals by making a sandwich out of it), and by the time i found out about the wallet i knew the cash had been long spent(i hope the hooker that guy got gave him 16 std's, preferable 9 of them fatal). The permit pissed me off simply because i would have to deal with the DMV folk. You can tell these life-long losers from a mile away. The Mask of working at a dmv blemishes one for life.  at the dmv there was the usual line longer then the pubic hair of a 70's pornstar. when finally i got up to the counter i encountered the smelly stereotypical nothing who works at a DMV. the type with GED written on his forehead, and karl written on his nametag(the k is ofcourse backwards.not because our karl is trying to be cute and childlike, its because karl has the intelligence of a retarded kid sitting ona bench passing out chocolates.) well karl had to fill out the form for a new permit issuing and started asking me the usual questions. i cant blame him for doing it, its the poor bastards job. i can blame him for the look he gave me when i said i lost it in london. the stupid hick stared at me as if i was munching on a newborn baby while simultaneously burning an american flag. i had the biggest urge to just break a brick over his head while yelling "i m sorry if u stupid white trash has never left the state of illinois, dickwad" in his general direction. finally after another half dozen of these pleasant, casual encounters with people i wish were aborted 40-odd years ago by their crackwhore mothers, i finally walked out with a shiny new migraine...oh and a permit. and if u think this ended my encounter with the manual labor stupiddity that is customer service guess again. After canceling my visa after it being stolen i needed a new one. so i called the fucking hotline on the site and was met by the most ghettofied, nerve grating voice known to men. this stupid bitch was talking like she had a bit part in a rap video. shut up stupid, if i wanted to hear "whats up, whats goin on wit u" i wouldve popped in a dr. dre record not called a credit card hotline. Well she transfered me to another illegal immigrant with no handle on the english language, which wouldve been ok had i needed her to suck my cock BUT I NEED THE FUCKING BITCH TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT TO DO. after an hour or so of talking to a bunch of morons in deadend jobs, who apparently arent aware of that, i finally got my credit card. after writing all this i hope one person boring enough to read this whole thing leaves a comment.

      Well alot of people i know (i wont call them friends for i am sure they just call me shithead behind my back.this doesnt make them mean, just makes them honest...i am a complete shithead) have been asking about the eurotrip(o how clever that serge is always using movie titles in everyday speach (elbow, elbow), i suck) so i suppose ill bore u to daeth with a page long recounting of an event that could be summarized in 3 words, I had fun. I will tell this in completely random order considering i have the concentration ability of a add kid fresh out of rida...lets go play tag. Basically the trip consisted of a group of kids from 15-17 in age. there were 2 groups one from chicago and one from oregon/washington state. thank god we chicagoans were in the minorities. the other people on my delegation were possibly the most boring, know it all, want to seem more mature then they really are, annoyinh bunch of douche bags ever. aside from tim, tim was just smelly and boring. and zach just followed. i sincerely hope everyone else on that trip, specifically no-chin nick and grandma, get hit by a semi just after watching their mother die from cancer and finding out their father was actually a homosexual who gave them aids when he butt raped them. the people from oregon/and washington were also, mostly, terrible pieces of crap worthy of a xyklon 2 filled gas chamber. there were exceptions. i am going to refer to these people often so i will make a list of the people from the trip who i didnt think were complete digshits: caitlin, matt, jayel, katie, kristie, zach. wow, out of 36 individuals i do not wish a painful death on 6. either i am very easily hated or hate very easily. For the first time in my life i met a mormon. that how i begin the actual summary of the trip...the unintellectual zero i am. i begin it with meating a mormon. not the fact that i saw the mona lisa or the eiffel tower. basically we saw most of western europe. i accomplished some of my lifes greatest wishes on this trip; saw the arc de triomphe, was near stone henge, made a jew joke at the anne frank museum (of course this is coming from my stupid hook nosed and jew froed ass). damn im a classy guy.  as far as the hotness of girls on this trip nothing special. there were a few 7/10 but that was it. but there were definetly some ugliness. and i dont mean roseanne ugliness, i could deal with that, i mean overweight tranny with goatee still in tact after a botched operation ugly.  the most interesting thing about the trip was the fact that people actually considered me kinda cool. or maybe my massive ego jus got in the way of my realization that i will b hated for the rest of my life. i guess i didnt really explain the trip at all so i guess i ahve to kinda of do it so ill paraphrase. we traveled through switzerland, germany, belgium, the netherlands, france, england. we saw all the important landmarks. in between that we got free tiem in amsterdam to waste our money on smoking marijauna in a dingy coffee shop with some annoying college douchebag from michigan pretending to be a pseudocool european fashinista. drop dead douchebag. the person i hated most on the trip was most definitely this bitch from oregon named mckenzie(its a last name not a first name, although her dumass parents decided to use it as a first name, so i shouldnt b held accountable for spelling.)this bitch was pushing 18 and looked maybe 7th grade. i mean her tits were like training bra tits, and that in itself is not a big deal, Kiera Knightly (girl from king arthur) has small tits n shes still hot. mckenzie, tho, had the appearance to match the tits, like 0 signs of any physical maturity. but apparently her mental maturity made up for it. she constantly criticized me for being immature. i hope that hyppocritical whore is tied down to some train tracks, raped repeaedly, and then ran over by an amtrack. i suppose to her maturity is a serious face, arguments about nothing, and whining about other peoples behavior. just writing about her makes me pissed off. anyway her whole group hated my whole group. just as i wrote that last sentence my stupid a.d.d. mind began to think. how sweet would it be if we had like a west side story style showdown, and, yes, rhythmic ballet dancing would be included. o ive got to mention this( im pathetic i jus stole a conan obrien line)  the two kids who followed me. the first one was zach. this blue eyed, blond, aryan jerkoff made me feel real uncomfortable in germany. i found it pretty ironic that my dumb hebrew facce was talking to his stupid hitler's fantasy child mug and there wasnt an assault rifle pointed at me. at first i hated him with a passion unseen since a mel gibson movie. this kids jokes were the dumest shit ever. for two weeks strayt we tested him n he couldnt make ten good jokes in one fuking day. but in comparison to my other follower, tim the smelly kid as his friends call him (wait maybe thats not friends, its people who he thinks are his friends but really cant stand him). this kid not only didnt usually talk, he also made jokes more terrible then dat phan and smelled worse than a crackwhores butthole. the kids jokes were just putrid, kind of like his smell. i mean like the number of total laughs he got is equal to the number of rave reviews gigli got. to answer the stereotipical questions: yes it was fun, no i didnt fuck anyone, and yes id do it again. alright i wrote way too much anyway peace.

      I suck. i am slightly below average in everything and having a blog proves it. people who are good at life don't have fuckin blogs. My life has all the interest of a slightly retarded girl, a bottle of vodka, and my penis (wait that is pretty exciting). anyway my life is boring as fuck but ill tell you about it simply to be a hyppocritical jerk off( to paraphrase "i am a boring nothing, now let me tell u a little about myself" god i suck). I am about 5' 6" 145 and mediocre at every activity you can imagine. My birthday is september tenth, ironically the most interesting thing about me is i was born 13 years and 1 day before 4 muslims with 17 different last names between them decided to hijack a plane or two. I am of russian origins and no I don't drink all the time. i hope every fuking person who thought they were clever with their "hows the vodka" line gets his sexual organs mutilated while getting oral favors from a bipolar whore who goes over the edge while sucking his mule. I just got back from a european trip (with people to people student ambassadors) which was a surprisingly great time, that story needs its own post which i will give it shortly. In short though, i was considered fairly cool, that should give u a scale of how cool the general delegation was. Half of the guys had no chins and the others the maturity of paris hilton throwing a fit because her father is refusing to get her another lear jet (i hope that big nosed ho drops dead, preferably after getting married to me cuz i could sure go for some inheritance). Alright well i ve got to go to the dmv to get new papers cuz my fukin wallet got stolen.

       You know the feeling you get when masturbating without lubrication after the guilt has already passed but the pleasure is not going to set in for another 30 seconds or so. The feeling of self inflicted pain, not enough to really hurt but enough to be annoying, but you still keep at it because of the promised joy to finish it off. That’s my personal opinion on Costco(I should get every finger on my writing hand get bitten off by a squirrell with rabies for that horrid analogy). I hate everything about the fucking store. It screams suburbia more then a twelve year old in an Abercrombie t-shirt trying to act black, while waiting for his mother to pick him up from the mall. The concept of needing supersized portions of everything (the next time I see a two gallon jug of contact lens’ solution I am going to shove it down the throat of the overweight monstrosity buying 20 cartons of Oreos.), the need of every fucking attendee to have a conversation with the fucking cashier (I am getting a woody at the pure thought of shutting one of these motherfuckers up by choking them on the 12 packs of Pringles they just purchased), and of course the balding, flabby, middle aged man making excuses to his wife (But they give you a dollar off if you buy 4 boxes of Crispy Creams.), it all angers me to the eXtreme (isnt eveything a little cooler if its to the eXtreme). As I just wrote about the fat man in need of his overly glazed donuts above, I realized what pleasure I would receive from watching him suffering from cardiac arrest, as his wife bitches at him without getting up from the couch. In there, I watched no less then four individuals meet their long lost acquaintances. Only in this fucking Midwestern nothingness that is Glenview, Illinois is the “town meeting spot” a fucking wholesale store. No, I do not aspire for the neighbors to suddenly become Sex in the City characters and start meeting people in a fucking sushi bar, but come on, COSTCO? The next person who I hear shrieking to their old college roommate about their three bedroom home while picking up a crate of cherries is going to get their wrists slit vertically courtesy of a Parkinson stricken AIDS patient’s disposable razor. I will end the post by going back to the obnoxiously pretentious analogy that I began with: every fucking minute I spend inside that shitbox of corporate orgy I get this much closer to testing out my new home made grenade launcher on a mother and her perfectly average 2.4 children. I nonetheless attend, simply because my stupid Jew consciousness feels good when I save $2.75 on toilet paper.    I hope the person who created this wholesale piece of shit gets orally raped while watching his 17 year old daughter have unprotected sex with an aging Herpies patient.

      Granted, television is a medium created to produce cash for executives in dire need of a hooker snorting coke out of their butt crack. Nonetheless, there should be certain levels of common decency put forth on this programming. No, I'm not going to start a two page long whine fest about janet jackson's nipple (it wasn't that good anyway). By common decency I mean the need to think of viewers' intelligence as something a bit more than that of a retarded goats. Granted a TRL audience may just need this sort of entertainment, but obese 12 year old girls fainting at the site of Ashton's trucker hat do not account for 100 percent of television viewers. Being the pretentious asshole I am, I was watching Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO about an hour ago. I am a big fan of political parody in general, Bill Maher not so much. Although the idea behind his show is half decent, the way that jerkoff hushes any opinion opposing his own makes me want to get a butcher knife and scalp his enormous forehead. Nonetheless, I do have some respect for the guy because of his involvement with NORML (National Organization for the Reformation of Marijuana Laws  What pisses me off most about the show is its, above mentioned, attempt to cater to mass audiences. They do this by trying to balancing out their panel of political analysts by bringing in a wacky, topical comedian to lighten the mood. The problem of course is this stupid, GED recipient of a human gets twice as much airtime as everybody else (other than Bill Maher's pretentious ass of course) because of the TV executives, earlier mentioned, need to have hookers taking blow from a balloon knot.  It drives me to the point where everytime I see another african-american (these "wacky comedians" are always black. as bill would say "have to appeal my new hampshire bred douchebaggines to the hood, yo.") comedian interrupting an intelligent discussion on WMD's to yell "yo dmx rapped about this shit all the time (insert uproarious laughter here)" i want to rip out their tongue and feed it to a hungry child from sudan.  Sorry had to get that out of my system. Check ya lata, home dizzles (acting white is so 1996).   Fuck you, asswad!

      At twelve noon on the wonderful morning of August 4th, I had a big fuckin smile on my face, and no there was no retarded girl with a need to suck on pickle shaped objects involved.  I have the emotional range of a slightly retarded snail, unless of course there is a women with a miniskirt and some nice meatflaps present (two easy girl reference in two sentences, I stink). This event though caused great emotion in my pathetic mediocre brain. Opie and Anthony are finally back on the air. I didn't actually get into the show until well after it got canceled. I found out about through a network of Jim Norton fans.  Jimmy is by far and away my fucking hero. Of course considering the similarities between us: bald, 5' 7", white guys with skinner lighter than a jizzed on polar bear, he happens to be the funniest man on earth, though, while i have the comedic appeal of the Vietnam memorial. I am by far away not a homosexual but can easily say Jim Norton is a god. As I wrote that last sentence I realized how much I am angered by people not secure enough in their own sexuality to admit any kind of attraction to the opposite sex. God if I had the option I would open the old Auschwitz playground just so those dicks could take a ride on the ol' gas chamber of fun. Go watch Nascar while sipping on a cold one and describing to your bodies the hot chick you almost picked up at the mall, simultaneously your needy searching eyes look for any sign of acceptance. Then go back to your bedroom, dim the lights and wack your bag to an old Backstreet Boys CD booklet. Fucking douchebags. Anyway back to Opie and Anthony. These guys are probably two of the most hilarious people you will find on earth. And, no, I don't want to hear your fucking argument about how Howard stern is the originator if this genre. Howard stern went Hollywood a decade and a half ago. Once you've banged a superintend your mass radio appeal has gone the way of a catholic alter boy's anal virginity. His show has now resorted to forced shock radio (Mancow outdoes him hear easily) and celebrity interviews with "wacky" questions ( can you say "he wishes he had half of ali g's ability"). That condescending prick. The funny thing is I still listen to the guy religiously (I am nothing but a hypocritical, middle class fucker). Like I said earlier I never actually caught o and a on the air, only recorded sessions downloaded off of various sources. The guys just got a chemistry about them. There is a downside to their return. Because of their exile from FM, they're switching to satellite. Now its not that much money, u don't need to take out a fucking second mortgage for 13 bucks a month, but I am a Jew... hope I can get the episodes commercial free of bit torrent.  Alright thanks for listening to me rant kiddies, and good night.

      As a general rule of thumb I do not attend anything with my family involved unless i absolutely have to. It isn’t that I don’t like my relatives, although I do despise them, it’s the fact that I am sick and tired of watching old people complain. (ie my aging relatives bitching about those infernal horseless carriages, while simultaneously making sure their depends haven’t been filled with brown goodness yet, to celebrate my great uncle's birthday.) Not to exaggerate how terrible it really is, there are other elements to these events other than a constant state of whining. How could I forget the sugar free, carb free, fat free, taste free cake they'll serve later.  in the event that something like this does come up, i attempt to come up with a medical excuse (But mom, that tramp from last night gave me crabs) not to be there. Yesterday, though, was an exception. We had ourselves a good old-fashion, red neck outdoor adventure (all we were missing was uncle Billy-Bob trying to hit on Aunt Peggy Sue. While old cousin Henry Rex played horse shoes and ranted about that damn Ulysses S. Grant). Its not that anything exciting happened its just the whole event had the aura of confederate flags and American made pick ups. I won’t go into detail because it was just a really boring, Russian people trying to act all American (Easter European Immigrants’ children know) camping trip.  The only thing that I really liked about it was the beach. It wasn’t the beach really, more the people there (and no I’m not gonna go into talking about all the hot bodies in tiny bikinies. come-on, this is in fuckin Wisconsin). As I examined my terrible pasty white skin, I realized that damn near a third of the beach had skin whiter than me. And this is quite a fuckin accomplishment. I have Casper the friendly ghost just snorted a line of coke before taking a load of man juice to the face-white skin. An albino compared to me is a Rio de Janeiro beach babe. The people on this beach were just ridiculously white. I just thought of the poor artist who would have to paint this scene. “No sir, no other colors. Four ten gallon drums of white. No, not tan. White. A light pink will never work, white. No sir, definitely not a light peach. White!”  Other than that absolutely nothing happened. A complete waste of a perfectly good day. O yeah, I had to retell my trip to Europe 5 million fuckin times. By the time I finished my 53rd retelling of my London hotel room, my throat hurt more than a girl’s from deepthroatdivas.com.
