          Dear R,

I had so much fun last night because I haven't been drunk in a long time. My favorite part of the evening was talking right before we fell asleep. If the room wasn't spinning, I would've talked and talked and talked. I miss talking to you that way. I miss being able to say anything I want to say without worrying about what you might think or say. Sometimes, I feel like I can't be myself around you for fear of offending you or giving you a reason to snap. Honestly, when we're sober and immersed in our normal, hectic lives, the silence is deafening. And you know what? You were so attentive! For the first time in a while, you were asking questions and looking at me while we were talking. Maybe my drunken state was amusing you, maybe you were fishing for info because I was in such a madaldal mood, but I don't care, it still felt great to be looked at, talked to, and to hear "I love you" before closing my eyes. Same time, same place again tonight? =)

Love,
D

          Woohoo, how exciting! My very first blog entry! What inspired me to create a blog?

1) I'm addicted to other people's blogs and now I want my own.
2) I want to write letters to my husband but he would find it weird if I gave him actual letters. But I want to write to him, in the spirit of the letters we wrote each other during Discovery Weekend. One of these days I shall surprise him with my fantastic writing abilities when I present this blog to him.
3) I sit on my ass in front of this computer at least 8 hours a day, blogging should be a convenient task to accomplish in the middle of the turnaround documents and post-mortems.
4) I've never had a mommy diary and as each day goes by, I regret not documenting tiny details about my son. For example, I was unable to write anywhere about how depressed I felt when he had his first haircut. So depressed that I cried (silently and secretly) when my husband said, "Next thing you know, magpapaalam na yan ikasal." *sob*

How exciting. Okay, gotta go now. I want to mess around with the settings and figure out how to post pictures and links. Ciao.
