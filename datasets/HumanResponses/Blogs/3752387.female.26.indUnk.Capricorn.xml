      I think it's going to be hard to  make this a habit...we'll see!  Well, the working out is still going well.  My triceps are sore today, but I like to think that's a good thing!  I did all cardio this morning and hated every minute of it.  I'm not gonna lie, I skipped the stair machine at the end! :)  I've lost 3 pounds so far so I'm on track.  The real question here is whether or not I will keep this up once I have to go back to Bally's.  Even I don't know the answer!  That will definitely take a lot more discipline on  my part!  Especially, with Ali not belonging there.  It definitely helps when someone else is getting their butt up and ready at 5am with you!  We finally got to go grocery shopping so at least I'm pretty much back on in the food department!    This weekend Vern and I went to see Farhenheit 9/11.  Talk about effective!  I can't imagine a single person walking out of that theater and not fuming!  Most of it was stuff I already knew, but it was nice to have it all officially validated!  I want everyone I know to go see it, which reminds me, I have to send an email to Dave & Ali about that!  Last night I went to the Buddha and was part of a conference call with Michael Moore.  He really spoke well and it was great to be there.  He had some great ideas about what we need to do between now and the election.  Next time I go to an event at the Buddha, I think I'm going to try to talk to the owner about helping him out with the events since I live right in the neighborhood.  I'm going to try to make Vern do some of these events with me because he's the only person I know that feels somewhat passionately about it.  Everyone else (excluding my mama) is just like, yeah, I know he's bad...and then that's it.  They don't think to try to do anything about it.  Like they don't have a choice in the matter!  Very frustrating!  I've got to get these people motivated!  Um, I guess that is pretty much it.  Hung out with Dave this weekend and had a big fight...that was interesting.  Got my flight to Boston yesterday...really excited to go back there.  And that's about it!  :)

      So, I totally worked out hard all week, but then for some reason I've been hoarding food like it's going out of style!  Where is the balance?  Better yet, where is the self-control???  At least I have half of this battle conquered.  Hopefully, I'll get more on track after this weekend.  We are renting a car so I can actually do some real grocery shopping.  No more eating out for lunch!    Let's see...Ali and I are going to the Prince concert tonight.  It should be awesome!  Too bad I haven't even listened to his new album yet.  I love going to a concert and not knowing half the songs!  I can't tell you how many times that has happened to me!  I've got to start preparing in advance!  I think tomorrow will mostly be errand running...and a workout in the morning.  Sunday, I can go to the Sox game, but I don't think I will.  Baseball just doesn't do it for me!  Other than that, not a damn thing going on!  Until next time...  :)
