      I'm 40 years old, female, single, working as a paralegal in a government office in a third world country, the  urlLink Philippines . I'm working on my law degree. Been working on it for the past ten years. Gotta have something to aspire for. At the very least, all my skills and persuasions lean toward the legal practice. Not that it's a tradition in the family. We have no lawyers in our family. We're mostly employees, eking out a living in this corruption-ridden economy, this much ballyhooed only-Catholic-country-in-Asia myth.  Obviously, I'm no big fan of the Catholic religion -- or of religion, in general. I'm spiritual, but not religious. For one thing, faith in this society is more superstition than anything. Admittedly, faith is blind belief, but to be uneducated as well as blindly following is too Spanish colonial for me. A large majority of the population live below the poverty line. Way below it and extremely uneducated. I live just a wee bit above this cut-off and know just a wee bit more than the average guy on the street. Or so I hope. After all, all that education hasn't really gotten me anywhere.  I'm moving into my own place -- or I've been trying to. I don't know where the difficulty lies. I've lived on my own before: rooms, dorms, an apartment. It's nothing new to me. However, I can't for the life of me understand why it's so difficult this time. Maybe it's because this time, it's a house, with a second floor and rooms upstairs, a downstairs and even an upstairs toilet and bath.  It's only a small affair, 42 square meters floor area. No yard. It's part of a row, townhouse-style. Very small houses, most of which have a second floor balcony, with grills out front, covering the ground floor bit of a terrace and the balcony. They're very charming, really. The owner is away in Dubai, another single woman working for her keep. Anyway, for the meantime, it's my house. It's in  urlLink Bacoor , a small municipality in   urlLink Cavite province, just outside Metro Manila .  Like I said, I've been trying to move in, trying to borrow a vehicle. My own car's too small for the wooden table, the ironing horse, the screen, the 21"-screen tv, the mini-compo, and my books. The other stuff I can load onto my old battered car. Note to myself: buy clothes iron, and new car. Hah! I wish!   Illegalities in Moving Furniture   Last Saturday, I picked up the  urlLink living room set made of giant bamboo trunks . It still looked nice, and still in one piece: a large piece and two small pieces. They wouldn't fit in the rear entrance ot the  urlLink jeepney  I hired. So the men tied the big piece and one small piece onto the jeepney's roof, with the other small piece tied to the handles of the rear entrance. It was such a strange sight: a jeepney with a piece of furniture hanging from its rear and some more slithering right to left and vice versa on its roof, and all that space inside unutilized.  What's more, the driver warned me of the possibility of being pulled over for "illegal topload." Apparently, if the vehicle doesn't have a luggage rack, it can't carry toploads. Before I could freak out, Raffy, the driver, came up with the obvious solution: bribery. It would probably amount to a mere P150. Laurent, friend, future neighbor, office-mate and former cop, assured me that he could probably bring that down to a smaller amount. So, with no little trepidation, we set out, me driving my small Japanese car, following that artifact of Filipino folk art carrying more native artistry.  We got to the house without much adventure, just a lot of traffic which proved to be a blessing in disguise, as the traffic police were too busy keeping crazy drivers in their place. And we all know that driving insanely in the streets of Manila is the norm. Anyway, Laurent worried what we'd do if the furniture wouldn't fit in the front door. Of course, he was joking but it did make me think. It would have been hilarious.   Operation Mopping   I spent the rest of the afternoon till late at night cleaning the ground floor. First, the toilet and bath, which I hated. Then the laundry area right outside the t&b. Then the kitchen. I don't know which I hated more, cleaning the t&b or the kitchen. The wooden drawers I had all pulled out from the kitchen cabinets and given a shake outside. The wood had that rotten smell and it didn't look at all well. Someone suggested that I give it a good coating of varnish. Maybe a double coating. Or triple.  Once I had the drawers out, the cockroaches scurried all over the place. Not to worry, I was prepared for just this eventuality: insect spray. And not the water-based formulation either, which was gentle on the nasal passages. I went for the strong, original one which always made me wheeze before I pass out. No gentle hand in this situation. I was merciless, and ruthless, and scheming, and dizzy. I had to stop.   Christmas & other spirits   Being as it was December, the kids in the neighborhood were going around in small groups, singing Christmas carols in monotone, each one in his own pitch and pace, asking for small dole outs of money. Being extremely taken up with murdering insects by use of superior force and with a weapon of mass destruction (Saddam would have been real proud!), I screamed at the brats to take their gadawful racket somewhere else. Then it dawned on me: I was in my own home, being caroled at, and I finally had the right to scare off unwanted guests at the front step. It made me feel warm inside.  By the time Laurent poked his head in (actually, he sneaked in onto the terrace and called out through the window bars, speaking very loudly, asking if I'd taken my dinner and causing me to jump), it was already a quarter past nine in the evening. I had just come from my bath.  Interestingly, I could sense a presence in the rear part of the house, on both floors. That would be the kitchen, laundry area and the t&b on the ground floor, and the rear bedroom and t&b on the second. Now, I'm not one who scares easily. I've experienced two incidents of haunting in my life, and once, when I was four or five, I saw house gnomes. I believe that I'm attuned to this frequency of what is popularly known as the supernatural.  In this case, the feeling is the usual one: like there's someone behind you. It's not a malevolent presesence. More like curiosity on its -- or their -- part. I feel that there are several spirits in that house. Which is really surprising because it had never been left vacant for very long. Maybe a couple of weeks. The former occupants, a young family, never spoke of any such experience in that house. The reason they left was because they found a cheaper place, or so I was told. Besides, I don't think they'd keep anything like haunting a secret. Such stories get good mileage in this society. They make for good stories. Also, the place has a reputation for hauntings and poltergeists. Laurent himself was interviewed on national tv once about a figure who's often seen hanging from a large mango tree right outside the subdivision gates. And he himself experienced, along with the village volunteer security group, following a woman who disappeared into thin air right inside the subdivision.  I do, however, think that talking to the house alleviates the distress of these spirits. I feel that taking pride in the house and voicing out my appreciation of the place ease and assure these spirits that I have no intention of "negating" their presence, or trying to take them out of the scheme of things. Just like the movie, "The Others," I feel that they're just as scared of me as I am, of them. The trick is not to rock the boat.   Terrible beauty   The first time I came to that subdivision, I fell in love with the place. There were rice fields flanking the road to the entrance, with a bamboo grove to the right, and large mango trees scattered here and there. These days, there is a big haystack in one corner of the field, and farmers are busy tilling for another planting, driving that huge beast of burden, the carabao. It's idyllic. It's straight out of an  urlLink Amorsolo  painting.  It is, therefore, not surprising that spirits of the supernatural abound. Not to mention that a lot of people met their end savagely in that area. It's a killing field where the bodies of those "salvaged" were thrown away or where the victims were actually killed. It is also a favorite place for murderers and rapists. The road leading to the barangay where my house is located used to be a really desolate place. There were no houses, just rice fields. Unlike these days.  There are two big fancy subdivisions being developed, which is a good sign. More of the living, please. What will eventually happen to displaced spirits is anybody's guess. One of them in my house is more than enough. I hope they don't invite any more of their kind to the place.

      I went home early yesterday, planning on studying for my exam this afternoon. Mainly because in my hurry yesterday morning, I left my school things on the bamboo set. What an idiot.  3 pm and I was dozing on the same set. I wake up to my mobile fone beeping. It was Dale and he was in a meeting. This, in reply to my earlier text message saying that I miss him terribly. So I did what any mature person would do: I sent him sexy text messages about how horny I was for him.  I sent about three then went back to my nap. An hour later, my fone rings and it's Dale. We spent some 20 or so minutes laughing at how he had to keep a straight face while talking to some business associate or something. I got him real good. After he hung up, I hunched down to some serious cramming.  But then my kidney started to ache with a dull throbbing pain. In a few minutes, it was too much to ignore. I had to drive to the drugstore for some meds. The boon of having a sister who's a doctor is that you don't have to go to the clinic to get diagnosed. With the modern wonders of communication, all it took was a text message. I asked Laurent to go with me.  An hour after taking the antibiotics and the painkillers, I'm curled up in my bed, crying and feeling sorry for myself for not having anyone to hold me in my moment of kidney ache, not even cats to shoo off.  I wake up at 12 midnight to take the meds again and tried to study. Nothing doing, so I went back to bed.  4 am, and I'm up, taking a bath and shaving for my date with Dale tonight.  5.35 am, I'm at the office trying to study through the dull throbbings of my kidney.  8.00 am, I take the meds again, check my email, my blogs. No, no comments today. Belle de Jour has two new posts, very entertaining. I've sent the url to her blog to Dale who's found it very addictive, and very entertaining. He said her blog makes voyeurs out of her readers. I wondered if I should send him the url to "The Inner Slut."  Nah.  8.10 am, my mom calls up to tell me that she and my dad will be leaving for my place at such and such an hour. I told her I planned to buy mussels Saturday evening, and asked what I should do with the buggers. I'll get oysters as well.  She's bringing adobo. Mmmmm....home-cooked meal after a month of isolation. Can't wait.

      I understand the logic of site feed. For purposes of newsreaders, yes, it's a great tool. But I don't really understand why I have to put up a link to my blog's site feed on my blog itself. When I click on the link, I go to this page where my entries are shown, without the sidebar menu.  So?  What do I do with that, then?

      My folks are coming over this weekend, along with my niece and nephew. I have to get some mussels and oysters for them, especially my dad. Cavite, being a coastal municipality, is famous for mussels. Not so much oysters but I suppose where there are mussels, oysters won't be too far behind.  Raymond's going to be with them. He's a friend of my brother's, and has easily become a friend of the family's. Great guy, him. He's my car's mechanic and my tv's technician. He's coming over to connect my tv to an outdoor antenna. Needless to say, it's been four weeks of no tv. No big deal, really, as I get to watch tv only on weekends.  I'm actually looking forward to having my mom come over. I met her last Monday for lunch. We went to this Vietnamese noodle house and it was good. I miss her. I miss the craziness in that house. All these characters, aged five to sixty-five, parading around as a matter of course. It's only when you put some distance between yourself and your small little world that you get to appreciate the uniqueness of each other. It's easier to forgive when you're not so close to each other's throats.   More on laundry   I don't know what it is about laundry, but I seem to be obsessed with it. Yesterday, an officemate asked me why I looked so tired. I said it was the laundry. I've never realized it till last Sunday that being a mother was a monumental task. And I was doing laundry for just myself. I got a glimpse of how it was to manage a household of five, and it nearly drove me insane. The physical exhaustion is just too much for one person to handle. I now have new respect for mothers and wives.

      Dale has diagnosed me with laundritis. I had remarked to him with much passion that I wasn't doing laundry that way again. Otherwise, I'd die. Hence, laundritis. I had to get the cure (a washing machine). Ah! But she doesn't have any money! Yes, but doesn't she have plastic currency? Yes, she has three of those, two of which are maxed out, and the third is an extension card of her dad's.  Never fear, as my  urlLink Chinese horoscope  has predicted for me in the Year of the Monkey, benefactors will appear left and right to lend a hand. And, voila! Nelson offers the use of his credit card, payable on the 15th of next month, extendible for another 15 days should I have difficulties in coming up with the money. Cool.  So we're picking up the machine on Saturday morning, after which i'll go report to work and then to school, and meet him again afterwards so we go home to my place together. He'll stay overnight and till Sunday, I suppose. This is something new.

      I did my laundry yesterday. A week's worth of laundry. Gad, how my body aches. It was hand-washing, folks. I still have to get a washing machine. I could have sent the whole caboodle to a laundromat but it was too much of a hassle, considering that I still had to locate one near my place and especially because I had run out of money. I honestly don't know where my money went.  Now that I'm living on my own -- again -- I have to watch every centavo. Back to scrimping and saving -- again.  This past week, I had nothing but bread and margarine, with a bit of fruit, in the evenings. I didn't have any money and nor time to go to market for greens for a salad, or even the vinegar, salt and pepper for the vinaigrette. Even the apples I got from my mom. I miss being at home with my family. But I have to admit, eating less in the evening has led to some loss of weight.  Back to the laundry. I was thinking this morning in the car, driving to work, that I had this wonderful opportunity to compalin about the division of labor in the house, except that I didn't have anyone to divide the labor with and, thus, to complain to. Did I feel lonely? No, I was grinning as I handed the toll gate teller my fee for that morning. But, seriously, folks, I need to get me a washing machine.  I also thought about the fact that I have two blogs. The "Dying" blog, I realized, is for my secret identity, the one no one knows anything about. This "Alone" blog is for the real me. This is me.  This is me.  Me. One who does laundry. One who runs out of money. One who goes hungry in the night.  Me. Alone, I have meaning, existence, plot and funny lines. I'm a sitcom all by my lonesome.

      I've been asked so many times why I chose to live where I now live, as it is so far from my workplace, and the traffic is reputedly terrible that I feel I should really address the issue. So, finally, when the question was asked the umpteenth time, I reached deep inside and found out why: I like the drive.  I like to feel that, after one whole day of bullshit and kowtowing to the powers- that-be, I am actually leaving all that behind. I like to see the difference in landscapes and topography from one city to the next as I drive by, traffic or no traffic. In fairness, the traffic in that area where I live is not so bad. It's no worse than that in any other part of the metropolis.  I love to see the change from towering concrete electric posts to the short, thin wooden posts of fluorescent lights along the road; from the hard, concrete five-lane highways to the softer, asphalted two-lane back roads flanked by rice fields and old trees; from skyscrapers to wooden houses. It's a change that heralds the homecoming, no matter how short the time I actually spend "at home."

      So. I've let go of my efforts to become a lawyer. I'm no longer going to classes. I'm not taking the bar exams ever. I'm looking to earn more money. I'm looking for financial security. I'm looking at life in the long term.  Omigads, but I've grown up.  ADB has called to request for a statement that I've no relatives working at the bank and that I'm available as a consultant on call at any time. I've submitted. Next stop: the Consulting Services Office for some creative price haggling.  Nelson has been invited to be Vice President of a local bank. I hope he's chosen. Remember, long term financial security. We both have the same goals and aspirations at this point in our life. Might as well help each other out, become an economic unit, a business partnership, with benefits on the side, like kinky sex.  Well, at least, things are moving. I intend to go back to grad school and finish my master's degree in education. Then go on to an industrial relations graduate course for a possible HR career in training or something or other. Makes sense.  Nothing's for certain, except that I've gotta keep moving. And I gotta move fast.  Emyn's next big grand adventure takes off. I just hope she survives it this time.

      Last Saturday, Nelson was at my place to talk to L and his wife, T, re: possible business ventures. He cut a deal with T who left shortly after to put the kids to bed. L stayed behind. The two were up discussing business till 3 in the morning.  It wasn't all business, though. Nelson informed me that he had decided to buy a house in the locality, and that he wanted me to live with him. He was very clear on marriage: he didn't want it. But what got me was his plan to register the property in my name. With that, I could then, according to him, present him to my folks.  That was met with stunned silence. I could feel myself withdrawing from Nelson.  Do I love the guy? No, but in all practicality, there couldn't be a better guy to provide for me. I would assist him in all his business dealings, help him with the management of any business I'd be qualified to oversee. I think that he sees in me someone he could count on and trust, especially in money matters. I'm very flattered, and overwhelmed.  Does he mean what he say? I don't really know the guy well enough. That's the bottom line. But I think he's sincere, as he did ask L to look for a house for sale. And he did bring it up without any prodding or hints from me. I told Mara about it today and she could only roll up her eyes and call me an idiot for not grabbing at the chance.  I'm overwhelmed. I'm terrified of this decision. But it's been made. Gung-ho and all that.  There's also news from the ADB front. I'm being considered as an editorial consultant by the Energy Division of the East and Central Asia Department. My main task would be to edit and/or write reports on projects financed by the bank in the region. Interesting stuff. Tough job, reading and distilling engineering technicalities into the language of laymen. That shouldn't be too difficult. After all, I don't have to bother with content, only with form. And there is a handbook.  Things are moving very fast. At the start of the year, I had this very strong feeling that I was in for a change, another one. It's going to be a wild and bumpy ride. Forth, into unchartered waters! Let's hope that, this time, it works. Actually, I have no choice. I have to make it work.

      I saw LOTR: ROTK last night for the fifth time. I'm not going to write a review about it, no. Let me just say that Peter Jackson and his crew did a really great job on this last installment of the trilogy. Although I still hate the way he shot the fight scenes, I must admit that Return of the King is a true cinematic experience. You can fully experience the work only on the widescreen. And it totally transports you to Middle Earth.  It is so difficult to leave that place where Jackson takes you, back to this dismal existence. It makes me want to die, get on that last ship for the Grey Havens. To finally see those white shores and, beyond that, a green country under a swift sunrise.  We have all become orcs.  And what is that with those Jackson kids? First, they were adorable hobbits listening to Bilbo's account of the trolls. Next, they're in Minas Tirith, forming part of that sad crowd taking leave of Faramir and his small company. It's things like this that ruin the experience. What does Jackson think I am? Needless, it's an insult to my intelligence. It totally stretches "willing suspension of disbelief" beyond endurance.  Despite this, I think that the casting is perfect. I can't think of anyone else playing the starring and supporting roles. But the most perfect, I think, is Cate Blanchett. When she helps Frodo up (in ROTK, after he's fainted on the path toward Minas Morgul), she gives a smile like that of a child. You can really see the innocence on her face.  The attention to detail in this series is amazing. But I really would have wanted a closer look at all the creatures and flora and fauna of Jackson's universe. The orcs, the trolls, the Uruk-hai, the beasts, and especially the dragons. I just love it when they swoop down from the skies.  Another show-stopper is Shelob. The audience just gets into the act when it creeps up behind Frodo. Pure Hollywood. Fantastic. And, yes, the reason why I keep watching it (ROTK) is because audience reaction is such a sure thing, it's just heaven. I can imagine the thrill that Jackson must have gotten when he saw how the test audience was so enthralled by his work. His work. Hmmmm. When the work was produced by hundreds. But I must give him this: leadership counts. A lot. What vision. Entire generations to come will owe him such gratitude for faithfully bringing Tolkien's universe to life.  LOTR, the films, might have been built on Tolkien's universe, but it is Jackson's, entirely.  Did I say I wasn't going to write a review?

      Sunday, and my folks arrived at a little past 10.30 am. They got lost. My dad just enjoyed the open highways too much, he went up the fly-over instead of going under it. Anyway, they got to my place alright.  All four of the little devils were with them, including my beloved little doxie, Pippa. Her real name's Pippa Pepita Petunia Preponderous ____. But we all call her Pippa. My mom calls her " si pandak " (the short one).  Earlier that morning, I had gone to the  daungan  (the small pier) where the bancas dock, and bought some kilos of freshly harvested mussels and oysters. They turned out to be fat and sweet, dipped in a garlic-butter sauce (for the mussels) and vinegar with chili peppers and garlic (for the oysters). I had a crash course in preparing the shellfish from my mom. Nothing to it; you just pour boiling water on the oysters, and steam the mussels in a pan.  The kids ran up and down, up and down, up and down the stairs with the dog who was barking every half second or so. And they got onto my airbed and created a make-believe circus with trapeze artists. The only circus in the world where you can find a doxie trapeze artist.  Lunch was served and that gave us some half hour of relative quiet. My mom had brought these small plastic disposable cups and so I was busy refilling four of them every two minutes while their owners busily applied themselves to rice and pork adobo. Pippa was so hungry, she didn't need prodding to finish her food. It was actually gone in four seconds flat.  While the kids and my dad were at the table (which could seat only four), and myself waiting on four small disposable cups, I noticed my mom had gone over to the corner shelf and starting putting my very few knicknacks in order. I patted my dad on his shoulder and pointed this out to him. We both snickered as we didn't dare laugh out loud.  My mother is an obsessive-compulsive woman. She loves knicknacks and decor and has them all over her house. It's a lovely house, hers. But I wouldn't want to own it with all those small porcelain or ceramic things to clean and dust and put in order everyday. I have very few, myself, and these were given to me as presents by friends, too precious to give away.  After they'd gone, at around 2 pm, I proceeded to clean up the place (at least, the ground floor) as it looked like a tornado had gone through it. And the floor was sticky with spilled water and food. The toilet floor was muddy with small footprints, and a paw print here and there. But I felt good. The house felt like it felt good. So many warm and excitable bodies in it, even for just a short while.  After an hour resting, I ironed my clothes (which I had washed the night before!) and prepared the bedroom (read: put up the mosquito net). Then I plopped in front of the tv set and watched the second half of "My Cousin Vinny," consuming the last of the  urlLink  pan de sal  . I was in bed by 9 pm, bushed and out a few minutes after that.

      I left the house late this morning. It's been summer for two weeks already and yet the house still feels very comfortable. It's a bit dirty, I must admit, but comfy. I really will have to give some time to cleaning. Would help a lot if I didn't hate it so much.  Waiting for the light to change, I happened to look out onto this open field by the highway and I realized: it's been sometime since I last appreciated tall grass bending in the wind, blue skies overhead with little puffs of clouds under a bright sun.  Yesterday, I put in a few hours researching for my boss at the ol' college library. The staff members were all saying that I looked really great, compared to the last time they saw me, which was some years ago. I'd looked tired and hagard then. I suppose I did the right thing in giving up the dream of being a lawyer. I didn't realize that it was affecting everyone around me, especially me.  Like what Mara said: Finally, we'll have Emyn back.  Sweet.  Ah, but life is sweet. Except for cleaning dirty floors, especially under furniture.

      I'm broken-hearted. I still can't believe that I've given up on being a lawyer. So I'm eating myself out of house and home. I bet I've gained a few pounds over my already overweight weight. There is still no word from SISC, the college I applied with. Depressing. And to top it all, I haven't been going to the gym. Been three weeks already. Perhaps that's the reason why I'mso down. I need endorphins. Bummer.

      From the irascible Conrado De Quiros: The world may no longer trust the Philippines to do the right thing when a Filipino is endangered? Well, why should we want to endanger any Filipino to begin with, and for no other reason than to support a war that has proven as ugly and iniquitous as the Vietnam War? The only way to turn our pullout of troops from Iraq into an act of principle and not of cowardice is to reject that war, as we should have done from the start. The only way to rise from these ashes is to say that henceforth we will follow our own stars, friend to America but only as a sovereign and self-respecting nation and never as a vassal. The full essay is  urlLink here .

        I'm amused at how a lot of people seem to be taking too seriously the resulting "uproar" of some countries, such as Australia, over the Philippine government's decision to pull out from Iraq a month ahead of schedule. The  urlLink Belmont Club  has several posts on the matter, the most recent being one on the Philippine government's call for the Australian ambassador to Manila to explain Australian Foreign Minister Downer's statements criticizing Malacañang's caving in to terrorist demands.  Ladies and gentlemen, please. Let's not be naive. It's what is called face-saving. The entire thing is a diplomatic charade. The Australian government has just recently inked a Free Trade Agreement with the US whose Senate had already approved the agreement. The Australian Assembly, on the other hand, is still in the process of approving the same. It doesn't take a genius to see that it is to Australia's best interest at the moment to appear the strongest US ally in Asia.  After the pull-out, the Philippine government can only deal with the harsh criticisms from the international community by going through the motions of defending its sovereign pride. Everything is matter-of-course. Let's not overstate the obvious. There are bureaucratic and diplomatic courses of action that must be taken, which are expected to be taken, in this kind of situation.  A sovereign nation has made a decision. Right or wrong (from the point of view of the Coalition of the Willing), that decision must be respected under the principle of sovereign equality of states. International law and diplomacy requires this. That Australia keeps on using the Philippines as a tool to kiss Uncle Sam's ass is at once despicable and pathetic.  I agree with Ruth Pearce, the Australian Ambassador to this country. In a tv interview a couple of days ago, on her way out of Malacañang, she remarked that the two countries are friends and this incident would not at all affect the relations between them. She ended her statement with, "Let's move on."  Philippine media made much of the fact that the Ambassador made no apologies. She's a diplomat, and the statement made was very well prepared. She knows it. She's aware of this whole diplomatic crap. Hats off to you, Ms. Pearce.

      She had just been elected President of the Republic. Elected into office, not shoed in. This was a fresh six-year mandate. She'd always worked for the Presidency, if the biographies about her are to be believed. Even from a very young age, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo knew she was destined to step into her father's shoes. Then, the kidnapping of Angelo Dela Cruz happened.  In her ten-point agenda, she vowed to uplift the conditions of the OFW, Ang Bagong Bayani. Prior to this, she had also committed to Bush' Coalition of the Willing. Who would have thought that the two would eventually come to a head.  A new group of Iraqi terrorists have captured six new hostages, all citizens of Third World countries as poor as the Philippines, or poorer. The NY Times'  urlLink editorial  harshly criticizing GMA's decision to pull out the small contingent from Iraq heaps the blame for this new development on the Philippines' surrender to terrorist demands. At the same time, it states:    We are not arguing that allies show blind loyalty to the Bush administration. If anything, President Arroyo's surrender shows the perils of assembling a coalition of weak allies eager to please Washington but lacking much conviction in the American cause. I find it surprisingly naive of the NY Times' realization, more perhaps an open admission, that there is a (not-so) hidden agenda behind the Philippines' commitment to the Coalition of the Willing, as well as to all other American global pursuits. Ultimately, the editorial paints the choice between national interests and international relations in simple black-and-white. It shows a complete ignorance of a people's culture, the typical arrogance of white (alleged) supremacy.  The editorial does not ask for blind allegiance. Then what does it ask of its government's allies? Isn't it pure naivete to believe in altruisms in international relations such as those involved in this war? Of course, allies will expect rewards in aligning themselves with the "American cause." What would, say, Australia, expect from this exercise, the advancement of the American economy? I think not.   In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so.  Robert Greene, Power: The 48 Laws  Is the question one of the sacrifice of one Filipino life to save the rest of the world? Are we really so naive to think that the crisis has become now so much worse because of the decision of one nation? Aren't we missing the bigger issue here, that the war in Iraq was a stupid, egotistical, selfish war, not to mention unjustified, waged by the most powerful nation on earth?  The editorial also stated that with her decision to pull out, GMA wasn't helping the Iraqi people any. Again, if the US didn't love playing GI Joe so much, the Iraqi people wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.   1.  Do I support the decision to pull out? 2.  If not, do I agree with the NY Times editorial?  First Question.   I'm no admirer of that hick, Dubya. I have no love for war, especially his and his dad's. I've always maintained that Saddam Hussein was an internal problem for Iraq, much like Marcos was for the Philippines in his time. Like I always say, you deserve what you get in this life. If you don't have the guts to fight your own fight, live with the evil. I was not encouraged by GMA's decision to join the Coalition of the Willing but I must admit, I never foresaw this kind of danger to Filipinos. Which only goes to show that terrorism on this scale -- or on nay scale, for that matter -- is new to us as a people.  I suppose we've been so used to being insignificant in terms of global importance that to have a countryman held hostage shocks us. On the world stage, the Filipino has become a valuable player -- as a potential victim. The Filipino psyche is so romantic that it totally loses sight of the fact that he voluntarily accepts overseas work in countries like Iraq and Saudi Arabia despite the knowledge of the risks involved. And when the worst happens, all melodrama breaks loose. The Filipino doesn't lack in intelligence; he's just too maudlin and selfish to be of much use to his country.  Even then, no Filipino should die for The Hick and his stupid war. The Philippines should no longer get involved in any more of The Hick's terrorism against his country's perceived enemies. Lately, he's been eyeing Iran as another hoarder of WMDs. This guy is stark raving mad. Anyone who's in league with him is either just as mad or desperate, and the Philippines, unfortunately, is that: desperate.  Kapit sa patalim.   I support the pull out only if it goes beyond that. If GMA makes the decision to pull out completely from the Coalition of the Willing (Idiots), then, yes!  That , I support. Otherwise, I maintain my stand that the only way to deal with terrorists is to ignore them and not give in to their demands. You got yourself in this mess, you get yourself out of it. I believe in finishing what you start. GMA got the country into this mess, she has to see us all through to the end, and suffer the consequences of her actions. The only statesmanly thing to do. That is what it means to live in this world today.   Second question.   Then do I agree with the NY Times? Yes and no. I agree that the decision to pull out is, under the attendant circumstances, a sign of a weak leadership and political immaturity, but the editorial's premises and arrogance rub me the wrong way. I suppose the paper can be forgiven for upholding the "American cause," whatever that means, as it is, after all, an American publication, but its shortsightedness appalls me. Shades of 9/11; very vague, very nebulous, very dangerous.  That other nationals are placed in danger because of the withdrawal of the Philippines from Iraq is rather limited in vision. Again, the same argument applies: foreign nationals in Iraq are there voluntarily, with knowledge of the risks they stand to meet. It's unfair to put the responsibility for the plight of others on one nation's actions. In situations such as what we have in Iraq at present, things can hardly be viewed in simple terms. To say that the new six hostages were kidnapped just because the Philippines pulled out from Iraq is preposterous. Foreign nationals are ALL in equal danger of being taken hostage by Iraqi militants, and will always be open to such a danger, whether or not the Philippines withdrew its troops or not.  Sadly, I have to agree that copycats will arise when a hostage situation succeeds, especially when it involves money. But this all goes back to the issue of looking at the bigger picture. it's no use putting the blame on the Philippines when this whole mess began with the US.     July 19, 2004 A Filipino Retreat    Terrorists in Iraq scored a victory when President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines decided to accelerate the withdrawal of her nation's token contingent of troops to spare the life of a Filipino hostage. A group calling itself the Islamic Army had threatened to behead Angelo dela Cruz, a truck driver, unless Manila withdrew. To the dismay of her allies, and possibly even of the kidnappers, President Arroyo is hastening to comply.  It's hard to imagine the anguishing helplessness felt by a leader — or someone's relatives — watching such horrifying deadlines come and pass. The United States, South Korea and possibly Bulgaria have lost hostages to gruesome beheadings in Iraq.  But President Arroyo deluded herself into thinking she could actually do something about the situation, and has now allowed the kidnappers to alter Filipino policy. One can understand the desire to save a life, but Manila's retreat will only place all other foreign nationals in Iraq in greater peril.  President Arroyo's decision may play well at home in the short term because Filipino involvement in Iraq was never all that popular to begin with, but it could have disastrous longer-term consequences for her government. The Philippines, after all, faces a number of terrorist groups on its own territory, and millions of its citizens work overseas. It is never wise for any government to be blackmailed by terrorists into abandoning its policies, but it seems especially ill advised for Manila to be doing so.   We are not arguing that allies show blind loyalty to the Bush administration. If anything, President Arroyo's surrender shows the perils of assembling a coalition of weak allies eager to please Washington but lacking much conviction in the American cause. President Arroyo is certainly not helping the Iraqi people with her decision. Spain and some Latin American countries had every right to exercise their sovereign judgment that it was best to leave Iraq. But their decisions, unlike President Arroyo's, were not driven by terrorist demands.

      22 July 2004 4:00 p.m.  My dearest Carl,  I hope you got my birthday greeting via SMS today, for Sean. Well! So today your baby boy is a grown man. How does that feel? I imagine having a grown son feels differently from having a grown daughter. A daughter will always be her daddy's baby, but a son always grows up into a man. So congratulations, to you and your son, for having survived each other!  I'm all better now, thanks. In fact, I'm going back to the gym tomorrow.  So you have freshly squeezed OJ every morning. That's very good. But do I get just a hint of regret in your words that you only have oranges to squeeze in the morning? You can try squeezing laundry in addition. Very good for the muscles, you know. Improves the grip. :))  I'm looking forward to a quiet weekend at home. I bought (discounted) cds to watch: the second Lara Croft (Cradle of Life), the first "Babe," which I love very much, and "The Italian Job," for the racing Austin minis. That, plus laundry and house cleaning! Boy! Will I survive too much excitement? Tune in next time to "The Life & Laundry of Emyn Galad!"  Don't forget to take photos of Agnes Water and the property. You should compile an album of the construction of the house up there. It's bound to be exciting. I'd love to be there to do just that. And put up a blog! Serialize the construction of the house, describe in detail the technicalities in constructing a Queenslander, record the agonizing moments and frustrations of the owner in not having his wishes followed to the letter. Wow! What drama! I would LOVE to pester the building crew! Not to mention the owner. And what about video footage? Yes! A documentary about the construction! Wow! Exciting! That's a great idea. Too bad you won't be around most of the time during the construction.  Do drive carefully, and stop when you feel tired. And don't drink while driving! I know your good buddies are gonna be with you, and when men get together, they tend to forget to act their age. So I expect you guys to act like the ol' farts that y'are. Aaarrrggh! Be a good boy, ok? I'll be hoping to talk to you over the weekend.  Happy birthday again to Sean!  Love you,  Emyn

      22 July 2004 11:06:30 +1000  Dear Emyn  So good to chat to you yesterday and i hope by now you're starting to feel better. Touch wood, I've managed to stay free of the flu that's around just now and I'm putting that down to all the fresh oranges I've been squeezing each morning. ( Sounds fair to me anyway. )  So now I'm doing the usual franatic few days - trying to get things organised for the guys, leave messages / instructions etc - whilst I'm away for next week. Gonna be so busy right up until the time I leave. It's Sean's birthday today - tomorrow i pick Roy up from the airport and get him sorted and Sat i'm back up to the airport picking Laura up! Then have to prepare for the trip, frame some of my photos I've promised a gallery up at Agnes, book some appointment at Agnes with builders and engineers, finish of a load of quotes people are waiting for and about a dozen other things! God I'm sick of being so busy all of the time! Can't wait to make the move to Qld and kick back for the next 20 years or so.  Anyway, although i may not be writing much i will be thinking of you and looking forward to the next time i can get over. I believe Agnes is now covered by mobile service so i should be able to call you whilst I'm away. I'll try and call this weekend anyway.  I haven't forgotten about the old photos you want - just not enough time right now.  Stay safe and well and eat lots of fresh fruit and drink lots of pure water to get well and strong.  Thinking of you - Love Carl xxx

      15 July 2004 7:45 PM  Dearest Carl,   I'm very disappointed. ADB has rescheduled my exam for next week. I called this afternoon to confirm and was told they'd call me back next week. I think the HR people forgot to schedule me for tomorrow.  The training company, X.com, has emailed me my interview schedule for 2 August. I'm  starting to get a bad feeling about ADB, and my gut feel is that X.com will offer me a job first. My worry is that the longer it takes for me to finish the ADB tests, the longer it will take for me to get in. By the time the people who are looking to hire get to see my application, the vacancies will all have been filled.  I'm losing my hair over this crap, you know. I'm obsessing again. I hate this feeling of uncertainty. I just wish that people would get their act together, and let's get this over with!!! Arggghhhh!!!!  I went to the gym this morning and went on the Stairmaster. Cool, but I like the transport machine better. Hey! I just realized something! I can go back to the gym tomorrow! Great! In case you're entertaining thoughts about seeing a new, slimmer and sexier me, don't. I do not lose weight easily. I enrolled myself in a gym so I don't have to take maintenance meds for my hypertension. I like how I feel when I work out. I breathe easier, move easier, and my skin looks really good. Most importantly, my bp stays normal and I don't get asthma attacks at all. So stop salivating.  I miss you. I look at your foto all the time, wondering what you're up to. It's almost  time to go home. Take care of yourself.  Love always,  Emyn

      Been a long time. I see there are new templates on Blogger, so I thought I'd try one. It looks great! I'm thinking of getting The Inner Slut a new look with the itemized current posts appearing on the sidebar there. But I don't really like the My Profile portion. I suppose I can take that one out, but the overall design would look, well, incomplete, wouldn't it?  I've had three job offers since last month. First, from the Court of Appeals as a legal researcher/writer. Writing decisions for the appellate judge. Nix that. The court attorney in charge is a real bitch. She's got issues.  Second, my application with the Asian Development Bank is finally moving. Entry-level position: secretary (tactfully re-named Administrative Assistant). Good things going for it:    Higher salary rate for the same position compared to other local private companies, at P28,000++ a month. (Three times the usual rate.)   The Bank is not required by the government to withhold income taxes from the salaries of its employees who are, thus, free to report their income for tax purposes or not. (Do they or do they not? I'll give you one guess..)   Fairly easy to apply for higher positions once you're in (which I intend to do once I am).    Third, a large multinational training company based overseas is putting up a call center in Manila and is looking for an English trainer for its agents. I'm to be interviewed for the position at the end of the month. Advantages over the ADB post:    Possible higher initial salary at P35,000 a month.   More interesting and challenging work.   Possibility of overseas training or post.      Pros and Cons    The ADB offer may be lower, initially, than the training post but the possibility of getting promoted in the first seems stronger. But the work is going to be very very dry and boring. The training job seems more exciting and challenging but there's no doubt that ADB gives more in job security.  Really, at this point, there is no basis for a decision. I'll just have to find out during the interview. I can't help but think of Tom. The last time we saw each other, he taught me a few things in marketing myself and my skills. He's been very helpful. If I get a good deal with this training company, I'll be forever grateful to him. I'll have to send him a letter thanking him. I miss the guy, no matter that he's a jerk. To be fair, he's not really a jerk, just immature and insensitive, carried away by his new-found freedom. Anyway, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. If I get there.  But this blog's looking good!

      Ross Gittins of the SMH goes down to the basics of the opposition to the AUSFTA. It all revolves around the American strategy of furthering global corporate interests via intellectual property (IP) rights. Selling off a slice of our country August 11, 2004  The funny thing about the free trade agreement with the United States is that Australians and Amer-icans see it as being about completely different things. Australia's businesspeople see it as about eliminating the barriers to exports and imports between the two countries, which they regard as a good thing.  The premiers see it as about our Government giving up the right to vet US takeovers of mid-sized Australian companies or proposals to set up shop in Australia. The premiers think this will bring a lot of new investment to their states.  To the Americans, however, the deal is about something most Australian businesspeople don't take much interest in - intellectual property rights.  Intellectual property rights are protected by such legal devices as patents, copyright and trademarks. Copyright covers things such as books, music, recordings, movies, computer games and software.  Patents cover a multitude of mechanical inventions, but also medical drugs and aspects of computer software.  The US is by far the world's largest exporter of goods and services with intellectual property (IP) embodied in them. It rightly believes that the production and export of IP is where its future prosperity lies.  So a primary objective of the US Government's trade policy has long been to make the world a more congenial place for US exporters of IP.  It's trying to get other countries to "harmonise" their IP laws with US laws, to act as policemen in prosecuting citizens who pirate American IP, and to enhance the ability of US companies to protect their rights in other countries' courts.  This is all very well for the Americans, but it offers little benefit to us, just costs. Why? Because we are, and always will be, a heavy net importer of IP.  Another concern is that the US Congress has allowed America's IP law to be debauched by powerful commercial interests. Big American drug and software companies have turned the patent system into an anti-competitive rort.  They do this by using many dubious patents to extend the life of a patent ("evergreening") or just to box in their competitors. They've become highly litigious, suing competitors or threatening to sue small innovators they want to push around. This has been possible partly because the US patent office is hopelessly understaffed and thus incapable of vetting dubious applications.  On top of this, Congress allows industry lobbyists to persuade it to extend retrospectively the duration of patents and copyright. Copyright has been extended from 50 years after the death of the creator to 70 years, mainly because the Disney Corporation was about to lose control of Mickey Mouse. Such extentions do little or nothing to increase the incentive to create, they just give a windfall gain to copyright holders at the expense of consumers.  And yet the free trade agreement obliges us to extend the life of our copyright to fit in. We have already been obliged to extend patents from 16 to 20 years in the name of harmonising with US law.  The section dealing with IP is the longest chapter in the agreement. And it presents us with a puzzle. Our Government repeatedly assures us it has given the Americans little of any value, so there's nothing for us to worry about. But US politicians and lobby groups say they're well pleased with the precedent our deal sets for the many free trade agreements the US intends to reach with other countries. How can this conundrum be resolved?   Well, it may be that one or both sides is lying. But I think it could be that our Government is talking about now, whereas the Americans are thinking about the future.  Take the classic case of the US objection to our rules specifying a minimum level of Australian content for television programs and ads.  Our Government has acted to protect its existing local-content rules for television. But it has limited its ability to extend local-content rules to cover new electronic mediums as they arise. So the Americans know they have only to wait for changing technology to give them the upper hand.  Or, take the "standstill" principle we've agreed to. We can't decide to increase the existing local-content requirement and, should we ever decide to lower it, we're forbidden to put it back up. So, over time, the Americans benefit from a kind of downward ratchet.  Mark Latham's last-minute amendment will do nothing to stop this loss of our control over local content. It merely ensures that any reduction of the existing standard must be decided by the Parliament, not a bureaucrat.  As part of its obsession with advancing the interests of its big IP exporting companies, the US Congress deeply disapproves of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which allows Australians to pay two or three times less for their drugs than Americans do.  Our Government swears it's agreed to nothing that would add to the cost of the PBS, but various experts in IP law see loopholes in the free trade agreement that the US drug companies are bound to exploit over time. Those academics doubt that Latham's amendment is sufficient to solve the problem.  In this and other areas, the agreement gives US companies considerable scope to use our courts to argue the toss with our Government when it seeks to do something they believe is contrary to the provisions of the agreement.  Now consider this. The deal prohibits Australian companies from exporting drugs to the US (and thereby undercutting local US drug prices). Our Government says this is not a problem because Australian law already prohibits such exports.  What we've given up, however, is our ability to change that law should we see fit at some point in the future. So I suspect the deal involves us giving up a fair bit of our future room to move - selling off a slice of our sovereignty - particularly in the ever-more important area of intellectual property.  And don't forget that, should our Government persist with actions the Americans consider contrary to the agreement, they have the right to impose sanctions on us.  I have a fear the Howard Government's wonderful trade agreement with the mighty United States may turn out to be a Trojan Horse. Sneaky, these Americans, you gotta hand them that.

      Randy David, my favorite op-ed columnist in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, writes about the new Presidential Commission on Values Formation. He certainly hits the spot: Our Constitution's Declaration of Principles and State Policies may be read as a litany of our nation's core values. Yet the conduct of our national life is antithetical to almost everything the Constitution celebrates. We don't take our constitutional values seriously. It is obvious that enshrining them in the nation's basic charter does not guarantee their realization. The problem is not their lack of clarity. The problem is their irrelevance to our national life.  The fault is not in the values themselves, or in our genes or stars. It is simply that the conditions that make it possible for us to live up to our Constitution's value aspirations are not there. We actually live by another set of values that are more congenial to the kind of society we are, more feudal than democratic, more traditional than modern, reflecting the social instincts of a highly unequal and underdeveloped nation. Read with Peter Wallace's Report (June 2004), David's  urlLink article  certainly puts a lot of things into perspective.  I've been trying to find ways to publish The Wallace Report on this blog. It's kinda long and incorporates graphs.

      Peter Hartcher of the Sydney Morning Herald has presented a fascinating analysis of the political maneuverings of PM John Howard and Mark Latham as against each other in re: the AUSFTA. I'm reproducing the entire  urlLink article  here for posterity. It should be interesting to observe how the (election) game is played out from hereon. Game of bluff against all interests August 6, 2004  The debate between free trade and protectionism was the original divide around which Australian politics was organised. It wasn't just a lively subject of debate. The names of the two main political parties reflected the overwhelming importance of the issue - the Free Trade Party and the Protectionists.  The question was settled decisively in favour of the protectionists. It didn't work. Australia moved away from protectionism from 1983 when the Hawke-Keating-Button regime dismantled tariffs and quotas that had been designed to keep Australia prosperous. Instead, they had bequeathed the country what Hawke's industry minister, John Button, described as an "industrial museum".  It was hugely controversial. Together with a brace of other economic issues, this was one of the reasons that the big political arguments in Australia in the 1980s were all about the economy. Today it's foreign policy, not the economy, where the big arguments rage.  Australia's two main political parties have reached consensus on the big economic questions. Both sides are committed to keeping the federal budget in surplus; both sides agree on an independent Reserve Bank; and both sides favour free trade.  Mark Latham threw this consensus into doubt in February. When the Labor leader heard the news that the Howard Government had agreed on a free trade agreement between Australia and the US, he said it did not to appear to be in the national interest and Labor was inclined to oppose it. This was a mistake - Latham didn't know the content of the agreement. John Howard put Latham on the rack. He taunted him for obstructing Australia's economic opportunity, for being indecisive, for being viscerally anti-American.  The big news this week is that Latham changed his mind. "Despite several flaws in the agreement, it has net economic benefits for Australia," said Latham's statement on Tuesday. "Over time, the agreement will allow Australia to establish closer economic relations and integration with the world's largest economy with increased two-way investment flows. This will be of long term benefit to Australia." The deal "will increase access to US manufacturing, agricultural, services and government procurement markets".  Latham proposed two amendments necessary to put the deal into law. Neither would interfere with the trade agreement; both are designed to guard against any harmful side-effects. One seeks to protect local content rules for Australian TV and radio; the other seeks to guard against any abuses of the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme by multinational drug companies. "We won't be giving an inch" on these two conditions, he said.  Latham's tactic was to turn a necessity into a virtue. He had to agree to the trade deal, but rather than appear to be merely capitulating to Howard's agenda he would portray himself as the protector of Australian culture and health.  Howard agreed to the first amendment, but not the second. Latham's amendment to safeguard the PBS was unnecessary and unworkable, he said. Howard was too emphatic too soon - he should have reserved his position until he saw the text of the Labor amendment. It was Howard's turn to make a political blunder.   Now, Latham is in favour of new economic opportunity by supporting the trade deal. Now, Latham cannot be accused of being viscerally anti-American, and now he is the defender of the PBS, a mainstay of Australia's universal health system and an electoral sacred cow.  Howard's position instantly does four important things in the shadow world of public perception.  First, it turns the national political conversation to the subject of health. This is an advantage for Latham. The electorate trusts Labor on health much more than it does the Coalition - by 42 to 36 per cent according to a June 20 Newspoll. And if we're talking about health, we're not talking about the subjects of perceived Coalition strength - the economy and national security.  Second, it casts Latham as the defender of the system and throws into doubt Howard's commitment to it. Third, it denies Howard a major prize - he cannot harvest the fruit of his labour, the free trade agreement.  And fourth, the people most disgruntled and chagrined by this happen to comprise key Howard constituencies - big business and the farm sector. And, despite the controversy about this trade deal, it also frustrates the national interest.  Free trade does not work for all countries. Some are not equipped to exploit the opportunities as others are. Trade liberalisation has been critical to East Asia's rise from poverty over the last half-century, but has not worked to the advantage of Latin America. But where a country has risen to prosperity, trade liberalisation has been a vital component of its success. In short, free trade is a necessary condition for prosperity, but it is not a sufficient condition.  Since 1970 world trade has burgeoned from $US1.5 trillion ($2.13 trillion) in today's dollars to $US8 trillion, or from 13 per cent of world economic output to 25 per cent.  Countries that made major trade liberalisations in the 1990s enjoyed an average national economic growth rate 2.5 percentage points higher than those that did not, according to the International Monetary Fund.  Despite the doubts and fears about Australia's ability to compete in the world, it is one of the countries that has benefited from embracing open markets. The protectionists said dismantling of protection for Australian manufacturing would wipe it out. Many uncompetitive firms did go under. But overall it has been one of the major sources of vigour in Australia's economy.   Manufacturing output has surged by 40 per cent. Tariffs on imported cars have fallen by two-thirds, and Australia's car industry, instead of collapsing, has emerged as an export success story. It was sadly uncompetitive, but today exports 32 per cent of its output and generates $5 billion in export earnings a year.  We know, from experience, that Australia will stagnate if it hides from the world, but that it can prosper if it embraces openness and seizes the opportunities the world trading system presents. One job in five in Australia depends on exports, according to the Federal Government, and one job in every four in rural Australia.  Bilateral trade deals are not ideal. But with the ideal - global market-opening deals negotiated through the World Trade Organisation - in an eight-year twilight of indecision and anti-climax any prudent government must take trade opportunities where it can find them.  Howard knows this and has done a great deal to advance Australia's trade agenda. The national interest, and his political interest, impel him to correct his blunder, cut a deal with Latham, and grasp the fruit of his labour. He does not have much time - Parliament's sitting, possibly the last before he pitches the country into an election campaign, ends next Thursday.

      Peter Wallace, former president of the Australian-New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, rebuked the Philippine press of irresponsible journalism in the face of social, political and economic instability in the country. As an example of this, he cites the reportage of coup plots which have no basis whatsoever aside from rumors and war-mongering of publicity-hungry politicians and political wanna-bes. The  urlLink editorial  of the Phil. Daily Inquirer today, however, shows how the press can, instead, aid efforts in boosting the people's morale, as a way of cultivating a people's identity and a state's sovereign independence.  The Philippines has held fast to its emerging, more independent policies, and retained the moral advantage in its relations with Australia. For our officials to back down now would only send a message that our reaction to Australian rhetoric was merely emotional pique, and not a substantive difference. Most of all, it would send the message to the Australian government that we are easily bamboozled. Only say a nice word, and Manila is all but ready to dance to Canberra's tune. Congratulations are, I believe, in order. We need more of this kind of analysis and responsible treatment of news. However, the Palace needs to catch up, as can be seen in this  urlLink article  on ABS-CBN news.

      3 August 2004 5:00 p.m.  Dearest Carl,  I went to that interview last night, with the training company, X. The CEO himself, F, conducted the interview with his assistant, a Filipino, present. The CEO's French, very young, no older than 32. So was the Filipino, DO, who's in his mid-20s, and asked one question during the entire hour. They're both based in France. It started well, but ended disastrously.  First thing was the handshake. As CEO, the French guy shook hands unconvincingly. Limp, weak, and just plain confusing. I can't remember if he looked me in the eye. I guess I was looking confusedly at his hand.  The training company offers English language tutoring or coaching via telephone (landline) or videophone, on a 1-on-1 basis. The clients sign up for programs of lessons at 30 minutes per lesson. The client signs up, but the teacher calls him up at a designated hour. Teacher and student then converse in English for half an hour. The CEO says that most of their clients are Eureopeans, a majority of whom are French, since under French law, companies are obliged to allocate a portion of their budget for training, and honing English skills is part of that training.  At first, I was deeply puzzled. I've never heard of anyone learning any foreign language with any appreciable result via the phone. It simply isn't done. So I ask them if they have set modules for teaching. The CEO says no, as the company has been growing so fast (at 300%, if this guy's to be believed), there simply is no time to establish any uniform system.  The obvious question then is how the company measures the effectivity of their teachers. The way he described it, clients are at first assigned to two teachers. Then, he is asked to choose between the two teachers as to his preference. If the teacher gets requested for by clients, then she's considered effective. Because the company's main emphasis is that the client enjoys ("has fun," the CEO's very words) the learning process, as long as the client signs up for more lessons, it doesn't matter if he learns, does it (his own words)? Conversely, if the teacher doesn't get enough requests or none at all, then she's considered ineffective and terminated.   Then there's the payment scheme. The teachers are to be paid a fixed monthly salary of P16,000, plus a fee for every lesson given. Teachers are required to work a maximum of six hours a day, so one teacher can give a maximum of 12 lessons per day and, if sustained for a month, can earn a maximum of P38,000, inclusive of the fixed salary.  The first thought that came to my mind upon learning about the system of "teaching," and the technology used in this, was "phone sex," without the sex. After learning about how teachers were paid, I said to myself, it might not be sex, but it's definitely not teaching English. If you think about it, it's very easy to cross over to erotic chat in this kind of set-up. A complete stranger calls you up, presumably of the opposite sex, and what the hell are you going to talk about? The client sets the topic, he needs to be entertained if the teacher is to continue receiving requests. It can harmlessly start with easy banter, off color jokes, then slight innuendos to sexual matters. Very easily, it becomes erotic chat. Or it could remain on the flirting plane. Why not? The client is kept happy, he remembers the teacher's name, signs up for more lessons with the same teacher, business flourishes, the teacher's pay is assured. It's a phone pal service, in English.  The CEO finally got tired of my questioning, because he could see that I was so disbelieving, and I guess I was trying so hard to find justification for giving credulity to the entire thing, I came across quite aggressively (think courtroom cross-examination of the witness). He ws put out by my tearing the payment schedule and scheme apart and getting into the little details like tax shields (of which he knew nothing about), etc., that he started to act petulantly, like a kid, really. And he didn't particularly like it that I referred to the lesson fees as commissions as, according to him, they were not selling anything. sure. I got the distinct impression that I put him on the defensive and that he was not trying to explain the confusion. So I said goodnight and left. He didn't extend his hand.  It was the strangest job interview that I've ever had in my entire life.  If you check out their website, X.com, you'll notice two things: 1.  no specific geographical addresses for the home office or the branch offices, only phone numbers and email addresses; and 2.  they accept payments by check, wire transfers and credit card payments online, secured by VeriSign, not PayPal.  The first is very suspicious at the outset because it makes no mention of the principal office of the company, where it's based and the address. The same goes with the branch offices. The second one is frightening in itself since VeriSign is not known to verify the authenticity of the company and/or the services offered. Note that Amazon, eBay and similar sites use PayPal, while Adult Friend Finder and sites of that nature carry VeriSign.  I'm convinced it's a scam. Teaching English, my ass. I went to that interview all prepared to discuss teaching methods and lesson plans. For what? To be offered a job idly chatting with European men who might or might not call again. Fuck them.  Anyway, ADB called and set me for an interview on the 12th. The job's boring but the pay's good, and the benefits, better. Let's hope. I really miss you, sweetheart. Write me something funny and light. I need you to keep me sane, you know. The duck joke doesn't seem to be working anymore. I need my complete and utter bastard fix badly.  Love you,  Emyn

      Talked to Carl on the phone yesterday. Complained about how much I was missing him, how things weren't moving as fast as I wanted them to, insofar as job transfers were concerned, and how I was falling ill because of my obsessing over things I have no control over. Again, my sweet could only remind me to take it one day at a time, and be patient.  I did tell him I was amusing myself with this diplomatic row between the Philippines and Australia. We talked about it for a bit and he did enlighten me with an explanation of that part of the Aussie psyche which deals with the Yellow Peril Syndrome. He defines this as an unfounded fear of a takeover by Australia's Asian neighbors. Ridiculous as it may sound, it seems that landlocked Aussies actually are terrified by the fact that they are alone as a non-Asian nation in the Asia-Pacific region. I broached my theory that Australia's present leadership is seeking a stronger presence in that region. Carl says it's not farfetched.  Below are "clippings" from articles in an Aussie paper. I like the SMH. It's easy to read, the op-ed writers are very down-to-earth in their writing style and clear in their views. Suffice it to say, I find these Aussie sentiments quite refreshing.  From the  urlLink SYDNEY MORNING HERALD , online edition:   urlLink No free trade in so-called free trade agreement  By Ross Gittins July 19, 2004  Citing Peter Urban, Australia's consul-general to the US from 1989 to 1994 and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's chief economist in 1995 and 1996: The area where the United States retains a global competitive edge is in services and goods embodying intellectual property - software, films, music, many capital goods, pharmaceuticals etc.  And the last thing the US wants for these IP goods and services is free trade. The fact is, the US wants monopoly or oligopoly pricing for these goods and services, not competitive pricing.  The US has been pursuing its IP trade agenda quite single-mindedly for more than the last decade.    xxx   xxx   xxx  xxx   xxx   xxx  xxx [T]he US has a culture of aggressive use of patents (and patent enforcement) and the US patent office is granting very broad patents (for example, on double clicking) for IT.  The result - the US government and US industry are looking to trying to use IP protection as a major element in their strategy to protect the position of the United States as a major economic power.  xxx   xxx   xxx  We (i.e., Australians) are significant consumers of IP goods and services. Indeed, Australia's fast uptake of IP has been a major driver of our rapid productivity growth over the last decade or so.  For this to continue, Australian industry needs access to these goods and services at competitive prices. Yes, it is in our long-term interests that US producers of IP earn reasonable returns. If they don't, they will reduce their investment in new IP.  It is not in our interests, however, to help the US institutionalise its market power in IP markets.  The bottom line: AUSFTA is just another case of that hoary old marketing ploy of "bait and switch". We were promised a real FTA but that's not what we will get if we sign this FTA.    urlLink Sovereignty lost in the trade-off  By Alan Ramsey July 31, 2004   Consider reality, not make-believe. The so-called FTA is not a trade agreement, free or otherwise. It is a political deal with George Bush. What the United States Congress, at Bush's bidding, has given the Howard Government, in gratitude for embracing the lies and manipulation that took both countries into Iraq, is a signed piece of paper, no more and no less. Its immense value is that it enables Howard to spin an electoral illusion to seduce voters, as well as use as a cudgel should Labor challenge it. It is, Howard prays, the key piece in his election strategy to stay Prime Minister.    urlLink A plague on both their houses on the FTA  By Margo Kingston August 1, 2004  Citing Ex-Australian ambassador Tony Kevin's stunning commentary: Latham’s fateful choice, and Peter Beattie’s cargo cult economics   This FTA isn’t about protecting Australian jobs or capital. This shonky deal is about John Howard trying to salvage something politically from the mess of his Iraq policy – to try to convince credulous voters that he has plucked some alleged economic benefit for Australia out of the tragic and shameful Iraq invasion imbroglio.  But he hasn’t. The Emperor has no clothes. There is not enough real benefit in this FTA for us. Even Vaile wanted no deal in the end – why are we all burying that recorded fact?  Ironically, the structure of this agreement – the small print - offers good prospect of benefits for US exporters and investors. Zoellick knew a good deal when he saw one. They are being offered preferential access to Australia’s national garage sale. Lots of good stuff to sell – but only one buyer, thank you – big, rich and white. You can see who will win there. No wonder the US Congress fell over itself to vote for this deal. As Zoellick murmured quietly, Australia offers "the low-hanging fruit", The Canberra Times' Jack Waterford reported the US diplomat as saying to him? "We like you Aussies, because you are such an easy lay". Thanks again, John, for taking such good care of us. There is no net benefit to Australia in this FTA. There is only farmer disappointment, and unacceptable risk, and loss of sovereignty. We do not need this so-called Free Trade Agreement.    urlLink Political drama without a happy ending  By Alan Ramsey July 31, 2004   Megan Elliott, executive director, Australian Writers Guild: "What is in this agreement for the US? One might ask how much bigger a share of the Australian audiovisual market do US companies want? Or is this free trade agreement more about setting a precedent for negotiating with the European Union? We have now had the opportunity to study the text of the agreement and we have found there is no economic benefit to the audiovisual sector at all. Australia will not gain any greater access to the US market ... [And] the agreement will severely constrain the ability of this and future Australian governments to determine cultural policy, giving the US government a much stronger role in determination of that policy. We will be moving from a position of being solely in charge of our own cultural policy to one where we must consult the largest cultural producer in the world..."  This is a mere taste. The detail of what the proposed FTA means for Australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme and its consumers - the real detail - is a nightmare by comparison.    urlLink Picking the low-hanging fruit first  by Brian Bahnisch    What's in it for the Americans?   First of all there are strategic geopolitical considerations. You do not have sign up to every military adventure, but you do have to behave. New Zealanders need not apply. The US does see trade in terms of national security, indeed in terms of consolidating their hegemonic position in the world.  Second, the US will always act to further the interests of its corporations.   Third, this FTA is said to be the first with an advanced economy. (I'm not sure where that leaves Singapore!) As such it is important in setting standards for further deals, both bilateral and multilateral.   Anti-US? Most Australians would call it Anti-Bush.
