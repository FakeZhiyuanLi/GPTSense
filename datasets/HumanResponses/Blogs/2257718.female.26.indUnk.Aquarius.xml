        urlLink Flicker Fashion    Blatant advertising for my friend's new fashion website.  I would only go so far as to call it "absolutely fabulous".  And that's just me.  She makes the clothes and she's an awesome C++ developer.  How much more talented can one person be?

        urlLink IdealsWork: Compare the social and environmental records of thousands of companies    One of the things I like most about IdealsWork is that it's turned me on to an entirely new way of thinking about what to do with my shopping dollars.  Basically, I can decide, based on how I spend my money, what kinds of things are important to me in a customer.  It's interesting to think that your dollar has that kind of power.

        urlLink MSN Women - Gals' Getaways    I need to remember this for the future.  I have some girlfriends coming over to bake cookies in a month or so and I'm considering throwing out the idea of a "girls only" trip somewhere.  I loved going on vacation recently with my husband, but I realized that there were definitely times on my vacation where a gal pal would have been great to have a long.  Don't get me wrong, I love Dale to death, but sometimes there's no replacement for the women in your life.

        urlLink Whack-a-Pol - Slate helps you choose your presidential candidate    If you're anything like me, you've got no idea which presidential candidate you'll back.  Or, more honestly, you'd like to back Howard Dean, but you really aren't sure he stands for everything you do.  So, to help you out, Slate has Whack-a-Pol.  Answer a few questions, and they'll help you determine which candidate best meets your needs.

       MSNBC -  urlLink 2 more judges block abortion law    I don't know about you, but I'm scared of our government and the power they have to control my choices.  I'm only scared of a few things, but one of them is President Bush.  He seems to be able to get by with things so underhandedly that no other president could.  I'm glad that there seems to be a fight at least in the courts to prevent the passage of the laws he is somehow managing to pass.  I'm not planning on having an abortion, but I at least like to know that the option is out there and available should I need it.

        urlLink Spank Free Discipline  - MSN   A lot of people seem to think that spanking their kids is just wrong and makes them a horrible person.  I can't say that I agree.  I was raised that, if you did something wrong, there were repercussions, one of which was being spanked.  And I can only say that I think I'm a more well adjusted person because of it.  We were out somewhere and this kid was screaming his head off about something.  I remember asking my dad, "were we ever like that as kids."  And my dad said, "if you did it, you only did it once."  Enough said.

       Action Item -  urlLink Kids Should Get Big Bird, Not Big Mac    When kids sit down to watch Sesame Street, they will now get a "corporate sponsorship message" from McDonald's. The message shows a flower blooming in a pot emblazoned with a McDonald's logo; happy children stand atop the earth with the famous golden arches below, promoting yet more brand recognition for the largest fast food chain in the world.   Sesame Street thus becomes yet another advertising vehicle for McDonald's, hooking a new generation of children on its high calorie, high fat, junk food -- junk food that has helped cause an epidemic of childhood obesity and soaring rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other serious illnesses among children. Sesame Street is one of the most popular children's television programs on PBS. Parents expect the popular children's show to educate their children about letters, numbers and healthy lifestyles, not entice them to eat more empty calories. Click  urlLink here  to tell Gary E. Knell, CEO of Sesame Workshop, to stop running corporate sponsorship messages for McDonaldâ€™s before or after Sesame Street.

       My first blog... should there be a book or something about that?   So this is my first blog.  Ever.  I saw this site on the website of an interview candidate.  Funny the things you learn from your interview candidates.  Yesterday, I learned that the latest twist on a "pimps and hos" party is "golfter pros and tennis hos".  If this Saturday's party goes well, I may have to have one of those.  I've been doing a lot of different things with my life lately, so I figured a blog would be a cool way to tell people things that I've found and that I've been up to.  So watch.  I may just through something in here that interests you!

       First day, new revolution...   Okay, so I didn't do so well on the watching what I eat part.  Well, I watched it go in my mouth, but unfortunately, that doesn't make you thinner.  But I did do my make-up this morning and my hair!  And I took a lunch and went to eat at this new place in Charleston called  urlLink Firehouse .  I bought two t-shirts from there for Dale and I because I thought they were cool and I have this tradition of bringing Dale back a shirt from some place I ate when I travel.  Work is stressing me out a lot.  I told Dale yesterday that I'm feeling like I can't breathe or get my head above water.  I really need to relax a little more, take one day at a time, do what I can handle, and just let everything else go.  I think it's that I'm somewhat of a control freak with this stuff and I worry too much.  I need to change my ways with that, so that's my focus for tomorrow.

       A New Year, A New Me - Hopefully   I've been reflecting on my life in the past few weeks and trying to figure out what I need.  So I've looked at a bunch of books and websites for "tips" on how to make a new start.  Here's what I've come up with.   Traits and activities that I think describe me:  - Giving and thoughtful - Cross-stitcher - Movie watcher - Magazine fiend - Book reader - Thin person in someone else's body - Lover and friend to my husband - Loving dog owner - Environmentalist - Socially responsible - Sister - Card aficionado   My definition of success:  Success for me is feeling fulfilled with my life and not asking "Is this it?"  I like a life of doing for others.  The problem is that it can make other people uncomfortable (understandably).  That's what I like about  urlLink Chemo Angels .  I can do as much for someone as I want and it's okay because it's part of the program!  I just need to find more outlets for myself.   What are my goals?  - I want to make the world a better place by being here.  As part of that, I want to help save the planet, bring joy to others, and provide a loving place for my family. - I want to be classier and more put together.  I need to pay more attention to my looks (like actually wearing make-up) and buy higher quality, versatile, classic clothing. - I need to branch out of my "safety zone" and try new things.  I need to try one new thing a week and make more of an attempt to get out of the house. - I need to learn to relax.  I will take lunch every day, even if it's only to read a book.  I will not work more than 10 hours in one day.  I will not work on the weekends unless I absolutely have to. - I want to lose weight.  My mini-goals for this are to run 1/2 mile by January 12th and 1 mile by January 31st.  Additionally, I will log all my food into Weight Watchers, even if I go overboard.  One of the things that I read was that it's easy to make a private resolution.  But when you keep the resolution private, you are giving yourself an out:  By refusing to let others in on your "secret" resolution, you can fall off track, and no one will be the wiser.  So that's why I'm putting this here.  I'm sharing my resolutions and goals.  Hopefully, by sharing them, I can get support from the people closest to me to help me stay on track.  To that end, here are things I'm doing to meet my goals.  - I will remember to do my make-up every day, except weekends when I'm not going out. - I will give something new a try each weekend.  This would be best if it's incorporated with an outing with friends. - I will take lunch.  I will make time for me to try new things and work-out. - I will work hard to watch my weight by getting fit.  I will make it a goal to start by working out at least three times a week and work up to five.  Here's my Winning Outcomes for weight-loss from Weight Watchers:   Amy's New Year's Resolution  It's a new year for a new me! This year, I will focus on getting fit. I'm doing it for myself, because I want to feel like the thin person that's buried somewhere in my body.  I want to look at myself in clothes and feel attractive when I do it. And I want to know that I'm healthier. This is the year I'll make it happen.  I know it won't be easy, but this is the year I'll overcome the things that have stopped me in the past, such as lack of time because I work too much, getting sucked into sitting on the couch, and not being diligent about what I put in my mouth to eat. This is the year I'll dedicate myself to my weight loss journey. I'll do whatever it takes to make it to my goal and stay there, including working out, even if it means that I have to take 2 showers in one day, using the dogs and my husband to encourage me to work out, and trying to have fun while I'm doing it. I'm resolved, and I'm going to do it: This is the year I'm going to make my dream come true, my dream to feel better about me. This is the year!  To help me make my resolution more public, I will update this blog frequently with my progress.  To let people know about it, I've printed cards that include my goal and the web page address.  So if you're reading this, you got the card and now you know why.  Please help me to be the person I hope to be this year.

        urlLink ESPN.com - BCS chooses Oklahoma over USC    I watched the announcement show on ABC yesterday, saw the news clips on Fox this morning, and am reading even more about it on ESPN.  The BCS chose third ranked Oklahoma over USC to play LSU in the championship game.  There are a lot of people upset with this, but here's the way I see it.    In the people polls, USC is ranked first, LSU second, and OU third.  However, in the BCS computer polls, OU is first, LSU second, and USC third.  So the two sets of polls are a wash.  What makes OU head to the Sugar Bowl is strength of schedule.  OU's SOS is 11th overall, where as USC is pulling in at 37th.  It's actually the lowest SOS in the top 7 teams of the BSC.  Sure, you can have a great record if you don't play anyone with the potential to kick butt and take names.  For OU, only Texas has a better SOS in the top 7 teams.  For me, that's satisfying enough to allow OU and LSU duke it out at the Sugar Bowl.

        urlLink Partisan Power Loss    I recently sent my state senators letters, full blown letters, complete with a stamp and all.  I did this for the same reason that Harvey Wasserman wrote Partisan Power Loss.  Because our elected officials are screwing the environment left, right, and sideways and I decided that I wasn't going to take it sitting down any longer.  I get so upset when I read these things because it just makes me really how much people in this world really don't care about the impact they're making to our environment.

       Fresh Me!   I just got off of a great three day weekend where I did almost nothing and found that I really needed the rest.  I couldn't even think about work.  Dale's planning our trip to Vegas and trying to put some things together for that.  For me, I asked for the last week of March and the first week of April off, so I've planned a great road trip for the two of us.  Here's the plan:  - Visit my great Aunt in Norton, VA - Stop by the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC - Visit a couple of friends in the Atlanta area - Spend some time in Nags Head, NC - Stop for a bit in Colonial Williamsburg - Visit Monticello - Head home  It's 11 days but I'm excited.  I've never done a road trip with Dale.  We're even taking the pups with us. I'm really looking forward to it.  New Year's Resolution Status: - I did my make-up today!  I'm even wearing pantyhose, which is a feat in itself. - I'm having lunch tomorrow with a Chemo Angel member that I've never met, so that's my new thing this week and going to lunch for tomorrow.  I'm not going to lunch today because I ran behind and didn't make it out before my conference call. - I'm doing good with the "watch what you eat" thing so far this week.  But I'm usually good during the week, it's towards the end and weekend that gets me.  I'll just need to keep this up this week.

       I'm Spread Too Thin   I started writing this blog once already and then explorer crashed on me.  I feel sort of defeated today.  I've been working like crazy and all I've wanted recently is to spend more time with my husband.  It's been frustrating.  I haven't kept any of my resolutions this week.  I didn't do my make-up the last two days of the week (mostly because it snowed) and I didn't try anything new.  Most days this week, I didn't even eat lunch, let alone take one and working out, I'm not even going to go there.  Hopefully, this next week, even though I'm in Charleston, I hope to be able to get back on track with everything.

       How are things going?   Okay, so I have a couple of resolutions and here's how I'm doing with them:  - Make-up - I've actually been doing that every day and making an effort to look nice and not put on sweatpants and a t-shirt.  I'm actually quite proud of myself. - Something new - Dale and I tried a new restraunt, Carrabana, this week.  The food wasn't too bad. - Take lunch - Well, I haven't really worked too many full days this week, so I can say that I took lunch. - Working out - I worked out twice this week so far.  I'm not doing so well with that.  Three out of four isn't bad, but I really need to pay more attention to that last one than anything else.  I will get back on track.  Things are going well for me right now.  Christmas is over and we're just now putting things away for the holidays.  There are so many people I need to write letters to and thank for sending things to us over the holidays.  I'm going to try to use January to catch up on that a little.

       It's 7:00 In the Morning.  Who comes to work at 7 AM?   I'm not doing so well with my diet lately.  I've come to the conclusion that I'm definitely an emotional eater.  I'm finding it hard to not eat when I'm stressed out, upset, or tired.  I did manage to work out yesterday.  It wasn't for very long though.  I was running and walking on the treadmill and got very bad shin splints so I stopped.  I get frustrated when my body doesn't last as long as my mind.  As for my other resolutions, I haven't been wearing make-up every day but I have worn a suit for at least 3 out of 5 days a week, if not 4 days a week since I've been in Charleston.  And for trying something new, Dale and I took the dogs to the beach this past weekend, which we've never done before, so that was nice.  And I took lunch yesterday, if not Monday and Tuesday.  Whenever I start to feel strained by things with Dale and I, he always manages to do something really sweet.  On Friday night, he and I were talking on the phone and I had a migraine and wasn't feeling well, so we finished our conversation really early and I went to bed.  On Saturday morning, he calls me at 8:00 in the morning.  I said, "Dale, it's 8:00 in the morning.  Why are you calling me at 8:00 in the morning?"   Dale says, "Because I'm here."   I said, "What do you mean you're here?"   "I'm in the lobby," he says. That's when I realized he'd called me on the hotel phone rather than my cell phone and there was all kinds of noise going on behind him.  He'd driven all night from Washington D.C. to Charleston (an 8 hour drive) with the dogs in the back seat just to come see me.  Now if that isn't love, I don't know what is.  I told him that the funny thing was that I'd thought about driving up to see him, so if we'd both done it, we would have been in trouble.  :)

       I wanna go home!   Okay, so it's been an insanely frustrating day at work today and all I want is to go home.  Dale drove down for the weekend and I really miss him and the puppies.  It's hard to have a rough day and not be able to go back home to your family for support.  Dale talked to me on the phone but it's the not the same as being there in person to get a hug and a kiss to help you feel better.

       Check Up (AKA Where is my husband?)   It's been a while since I've checked in here and I should be doing it more often.  Right now, I'm at work waiting for my husband to get done with whatever he's doing (I'm actually sitting at his desk typing this now).  It's 8:30 and I know the pups are at home squeezin' their legs together and wondering when we're gonna get there.  I need to get home and pack.  I'm heading to Charleston tomorrow for 2 1/2 weeks so I have a lot of clothing that I need to put together.  For that long, you have to have a range of outfits because it's not a "recycle these two suits for a couple of days" trip.  Hopefully, the traveling will end soon enough.  Life hasn't been too bad lately.  I spent a really relaxing Valentine's Day weekend at home with Dale, just hanging out and having a good time.  It was nice just to spend some time together.  I feel like we haven't had a chance to do that much lately.    Time to check in on my resolutions (it's not going to be pretty):  - Make-up - I do it every day when I'm in Charleston, but when I'm in Fairfax, I just can't be bothered.  So this week, nope. - Something new - We tried a new restaurant with Dale's family this weekend.  It was Roosters and it was actually pretty good.  I enjoyed it.  And the best part, it had chocolate meringue pie, my favorite! - Take lunch - Nope.  I planned to go out to lunch with Dale today, but I had to go downtown to get my badge before I left for Charleston. - Working out - Nope.  I pretty much haven't even thought about working out this week.

       Hello from not-so-sunny Charleston!   I'm back in Charleston and it's rainy and not at all fun.  I've had a not-so-great day today and I'm really just all around tired and not ready to face the world tonight for dinner.  Hopefully, some good warm food will put me in a better mood.  Things are going okay for me.  I'm traveling a lot for work which can be stressful, but otherwise, it's fine.  Dale and the pups are doing fine, so I think there's a lot to be said about that.  I started booking hotel rooms for our road trip.  I need to call and confirm their pet policies, since we're taking the pups with us, but I'm getting very excited about visiting my friends and family.  I can't wait to see them, it's been a while since I've seen them.

       Hello from Charleston!   It's been a busy couple of weeks.  I went to Charleston, then to Vegas, now I'm back in Charleston.  I'm really looking forward to spending next weekend at home doing nothing and not traveling.  Things are going pretty well for me right now.  Wednesday was my birthday, and while it wasn't barrels of excitement, it wasn't horrible.  So now I'm 26 and I don't feel any different.  I'm just ready to go home and be with Dale and the dogs.  It's an interesting time to be here in South Carolina.  The primary is on Tuesday and it's neat to see the advertising of the different candidates and the mudslinging that's taking place.  Today I heard that the Republicans are saying John Kerry uses botox.  All I have to say is, who cares?  I can't believe things like that are even discussed.  It's not important when you're dealing with political issues.  I highly doubt that Kerry's use of botox will impact his international politics.  But hey, what do I know?

       I am home!!   I came home yesterday and I feel SO relieved to be here.  I missed sleeping in my own bed and playing with my dogs so much.  It was good too to have a chance to wear totally clean clothes that haven't been in a suitcase for forever.  My family came today to celebrate my birthday with me.  I haven't seen them since early January, so we're just now getting around to doing my birthday.  They got me some nice gifts and it was good to spend some time with them.  To be honest though, my brother is really annoying.  He's pretty much a total jerk, so it's hard to spend any amount of time with him.  The whole time he was here, I kept wanting to kick him out of my house.  But he's gone now, so no worries.  I just balanced my checkbook and I'm really really close to paying off my credit card.  I'd run up quite a bill, so I'm really psyched to be paying that off.  The fourth quarter work bonus really helped with that.  I just put the whole thing toward my bill, so one more month or so and I'll be home free!  Okay, time to order some house warming gifts for some friends, so I'm off.

       I'm so lost.   I'm starting to feel like I'm having a mid-life crisis.  I'm questioning my job, my home, my extracurricular activities.  I'm really confused and I know that Dale's having a hard time with it because he just wants us to be happy.  He came to visit me here in Charleston this past weekend and it was really nice to have him here with me.  Ericka's got me involved in some things that are happening here in Charleston, which is nice.  This weekend Dale and I went to church with her and husband.  I'd never been to a southern baptist church before, so it was definitely an experience.  On Wednesday, we're going to the  urlLink Carolina Lady Anglers  meeting.  I asked Ericka if it was okay if we didn't fish.  She seems to think so, so we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed.  They're dedicated to raising funds for breast cancer research.  I think that's got to be worth going to one meeting.  I just need to try to get myself together.  Hopefully, everything will fall into place soon.

       urlLink MSNBC - Kwame, not Trump, needed to say "You're fired!"   I love the Apprentice.  I'm definitely getting into it at the beginning of next season because I missed the first few of this one and really regret it.  However, Omarosa.... How can a woman lie on national television and still get jobs?  It just amazes me.  She has absolutely no credibility, yet she's raking it in.  It's not fair I tell ya.

       I think I'm losing it.   I don't know what's wrong with me lately.  I feel like I'm completely losing control of myself.  This morning, I didn't want to get up and go to work.  I didn't want to do anything really.  I finally dragged myself out of bed to work at home so the people I work with don't think I'm total slackers.  I had a case of "IBS" this morning that made everything even more enjoyable.  Around lunch time I finally got the energy to shower, take my pills, get dressed and start doing things.  I paid my bills, cleaned the kitchen, put dinner in the crockpot, watered the front lawn.  Just generally got my butt moving.  I don't know what it is.  Lately, my depression has been really bad and I have no idea what to do about it.  I don't want to go see anyone about it because they'll think I'm crazy.  But on the other hand, if I don't and I keep going downhill like I am, I'm liable to hurt myself.  It's hard to talk to Dale about it because I want someone there to be supportive, but when I'm honest with him about how I feel and what I'm thinking, he gets really upset.  I don't want to upset him, so I just end up not telling him anything.  It's not good either way.  I'm not doing great with my weight loss.  I'm at 155 pounds and I feel like I've been stuck there forever.  After 1 year, I've pretty much lost 5 pounds with Weight Watchers.  And it's because I just can't get myself motivated.  I  know  I shouldn't have that huge piece of cake.  I  know  I should go and workout.  I just don't feel like listening to all of that.  But I'm really going to try.  I had a piece of chocolate pie today at lunch so I'm not having any dessert for dinner and I'm going to stay within my point range today.  I will make it.  I will, I will, I will!  I got my offer letter from MIL today.  I'm excited in a way because I really am ready to start this new job.  On the other hand, I'm really frustrated because I don't know when I'll start.  We geared up to put the house on the market and go and then got stuck in this stall period.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed every day that we'll hear when we start and we can move on this.  I know Dale's tired of my frustration, so I hope it happens soon, if for nothing else than his sake.

       So I said it   I finally told the people I work for today that I'm quitting in a few months.  I was going to wait to do it, but there's so much work going on in the next 8 months that they're depending on me being here for that I thought it would be best to tell them and help them keep out of trouble with staffing if I could.  So, what that means is that Dale and I are moving to Charleston, SC.  We have this great house picked out and as soon as we figure out when we're going to start working down there, we'll sell our townhouse and buy the house (a full house!) down in Charleston.  I'm really excited and can't wait to make all of this happen.  We've been trying to get our house ready to go on the market and keeping it clean is a nightmare.  But it's easier when you don't actually cook.  I'll keep everyone posted with our doings!

       I know it's been a long time....   It's been almost a month, I know, but at least I'm writing now.  I just got back from our vacation and it was really great to get away.  We just threw the dogs in the back seat and hit the road.  I love doing stuff like that with Dale.  He's a lot of fun to do new stuff with.  We spent the weekend cleaning our house and trying to get it straight.  Dale and I  scrubbed  the entry way floor on Saturday and I pulled a muscle in my butt that still hurts.  Okay, I have to get back to work (whether I like it or not).

       I'm not doing so well   I haven't been doing so well lately.  This morning, I squatted down to move some stuff around and I split the lining in my pants (luckily, it wasn't the pants themselves).  But it just points out that I've put on 4 pounds in the last week.  Here are my new year's resolutions:  - I will remember to do my make-up every day, except weekends when I'm not going out.  - I will give something new a try each weekend. This would be best if it's incorporated with an outing with friends.  - I will take lunch. I will make time for me to try new things and work-out.  - I will work hard to watch my weight by getting fit. I will make it a goal to start by working out at least three times a week and work up to five.  Here's how I'm doing on them: - I have been wearing make-up more frequently than I was last year.  However, I haven't been doing it every day.  I'm trying to take more care in how I dress and not look like a slob.  Some days it works, some days it doesn't. - I didn't do anything new this past weekend, but it was largely because we went to a dedication service for a cousin of my dad's who past away.  My parents stayed with me this weekend, so there wasn't much time for doing stuff.  Wait, I did do something new.  We went to  urlLink Cold Stone Creamery  in Manassas, which was fun. - I haven't taken lunch every day.  I don't really make time for new things or for working out. - I don't work out three times a week and I haven't been watching what I put in my mouth.  That's probably why I put on four pounds.  Okay, so now that I've taken stock, I need to focus on making this stuff better, and essentially, making myself better.  I will write down everything that I eat and make it a point to take the dogs for a walk every day to get myself out of the house.  Let's see how I do with that.

       Long, Overdue Update   This past week and a half has been absolutely crazy.  We put our house on the market on Friday, April 30 around mid-morning.  By the time we left for Charleston that evening, we already had a half-dozen people tour through it.  We left for Charleston and bought ourselves a house down there.  Well, really, it's a plot of land right now.  They're going to build the house and have it done in September.  I wish I had a picture on-line to show everyone.  Anyway, when we got back to our house on Sunday, we had 7 (!!) contracts on it by the time we got back.  How crazy is that?  Needless to say, we're getting more than the list price for it, which is great.  That same night, I found out my mom was having surgery on Monday.  You know how I said she never tells anyone?  Well, I think she purposely called us over the weekend when she knew we wouldn't be home to let us know she was having surgery.  And I'm pretty sure the only reason she called is because my dad made her.  I went to stay with my mom and dad in Maryland for a few days to help out around the house where I could.  I went back this weekend for Mother's Day and she's doing really well.  So now I'm looking for apartments for Dale and I to live in after we sell the townhome, but before we move into the house.  We also have to figure out storage and all kinds of fun stuff like that.  I'm hoping to have a professional move everything so we don't have to worry about it, but we'll just have to figure it out.

       It's been over two months!   I know it's been a long time since I've written in here, but I hadn't realized it's been over two months since I last posted anything. I need to get more on the ball with this. I can't believe there are people who have more than one of these that they update a day!  Dale and I are finally settled in Charleston, although not yet in our house which is still being built. We moved last weekend and I'm glad to have the long distance part of the move out of the way. Dale's got his home-office set-up going on  for him . I keep reminding him that I specifically asked for some desk space of my own that was out of his way and where I could work without bothering him. Somehow, we ended up with a super huge desk and plenty of space for one (Dale) and zippo, zero, nothin' for the other (me). We'll definitely have to remedy that.  The doctor said I need to lose weight. I knew I was putting on a couple of pounds I didn't want, but it seems so bad when a doctor tells you you need to drop them. So Dale and I went out jogging this morning. I really have no stamina, but we went for 30 minutes, so I have to be proud of myself. There's this  urlLink Atlanta Bread Company  place around the corner from our apartment complex. I wanted to run there and grab breakfast to walk back with, but Dale, who doesn't eat breakfast, vetoed that pretty quickly. I'm still proud of the fact that I dragged my butt out of bed and got running. That in itself is an accomplishment.
