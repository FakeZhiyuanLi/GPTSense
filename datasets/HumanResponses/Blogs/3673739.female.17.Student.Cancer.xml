       well tonight is my first entry its almost one in the morning but theres just a lil i want to say dont worry i wont bore anyone..first of all to my friend ala one of the kewlest grls i know this is how i view her really out going loving personality and just down right fun to be around...but theres also a side that i dont think she lets ppl see for ex: i think she has really low self confidence! wich she shouldnt and i dont know why she does just sometimes i see her and she looks so down like she wants to change her self...but if that happens she wouldnt be the same person that everyone loves so much..she talks alot about how her family isnt always there for her and i hope that me and others as her friends can help her with for being there and all... i read her live journal thing tonight and i just have to say that i luv u soo much and i hope that u dont let what ppl say get to u all the time and dont change for anybody u already have everyone as a friend ...i dont know i hope u take this entry as something that u wont get amd over and take it as me saying i luv ya and i hope we stay bff's hehe muah!!
