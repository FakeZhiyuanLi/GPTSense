       urlLink     What a nice fat world we live in...  "McDonaldâ€™s and Sony Connect have  urlLink joined forces  to offer every customer who purchases a Big Mac Extra Value Meal an access code worth one free song download at the online Connect music store."  Yes, now I can see the  future...  heavyweight fatasses with headphones on their ears? Great, you say there is  urlLink life on Mars ? I am the first to go...  PS Maybe if they do "All kids eat free", this is gonna be the end of the music industry...  G.

       urlLink     On chats I am always getting the same question over and over again - complaints from submissive males that they have so hard time finding the right partner, they vanilla g/f says no to even such a small thing as worshipping (sic!) etc etc... I am getting bored from it a little bit to be honest - but I can understand it in some way so I make a step - appreciate it - I have read it somewhere some time ago, so inspire yourself:  1. for sure you can not take Her to a bdsm shop on the very first time (if at all in your city is one, which is rare), but a classical sex-shop will do the job. Approach with: "I was always curious what do they have there inside... wanna check with me?" She should be at least open-minded for this, if not - change the subject and look elsewhere(politely, She is a Female, dont forget about Female Supremacy)...  2. Step by step, slowly. You might rent a vanilla movie with some "light" bdsm contest (especially good are some French productions but search yourself) and go back to the shop, maybe you wanna buy some "toy" (dont like the word much) related to what you have seen.  3. Think about the times you were starting, how it come? dont use the "special" words and talk, talk, talk to Her about how She feel about what is goin on. Do not push Her into something She dont like or to your favorite fetish too fast, Her needs are in the center of the attention now even if She finds the sub position more arousing  And how it goes... you may be very well surprised if She in the end ties you up and you get a nice bondage with some hard spanking (yummy) and you will have to be the one who will scream at Her to stop...

      The official ceremonial part of taking My degrees is coming this weekend on Saturday 12 @ 7.30a. Some "genius" has thought that the best is to held it in the early morning hours.  So Me and invited family members need to wake up just at 4a in the morning.   Bravo.  G.

       urlLink     Probably if you are online quite often as Me, you have heard about  urlLink Gmail  and that this service is gonna offer 1 Giga mailbox. And if you do mail a lot or are you trying to mail quite often with huge attachments (exchanging pictures or so), the 2 or 4 Mega large mailbox on yahoo or hotmail is not really a big deal and you have to delete mails very often (Myself like weekly or so). For this reason Gmail would be nice. Some say I am a little bit technical type, when in fact I would say I just like smart things making My life easier and more comfortable.   I have read some articles about warnings that google will read your mail or obtain some information from your mail and then show some ads matching keywords from the mail. Some "guardians of privacy" have warned that this is maybe gonna threaten your privacy. Well, I would say simply do not sign up for it but I have found an interesting thing.  I was curious and looked at the  urlLink privacy policy of yahoo  (Yes, the thing which everybody simply scrolls when registering). And guess what: this is what I have find but nobody is making no deal about it:  Yahoo! uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:   Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Yahoo!.  Please note that Yahoo! allows other companies that are presenting advertisements or researching users' response to advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer.   Probably somebody was heated up and and just shooted without any real knowledge. But All of us are not that stupid.   G.

       urlLink    From daily news:  "One of the  urlLink rarest events in the astronomical calendar  will be visible accross Europe tomorrow morning when Venus ( No, not Venus Williams as you might think ) passes in front of the Sun.   For the first time since 1882, the planet will appear as a small black disc gliding slowly across the Sun's face from left to right. Astronomers and doctors have warned people not to look directly at the sun when witnessing the phenomenon. Instead, they should use a telescope or pair of binoculars to focus an image of the sun onto a sheet of paper."  When I read a story like this, I am wondering if there always needs to be a warning with every single issue possibly having damage on your health if you do not naturally possess some common sense.  One story comes to My mind - when there was the total eclipse of the sun visible through Europe I think in august of 1999, it was best seen from Hungary. There has been a warning that it may have a large impact on animals. One of My friends comment after the event was this: "Yes, it had a large impact on animals. Have you heard how many people went down to Hungary just to see what in fact can not be seen?"  G.

       urlLink     Back from Budapest from the T-Mobile Day with  urlLink concert of Sting  as the highlight of the day. The concert was extremely good with some 350 000 viewers. But the organization was a disaster. Right before the podium and on the right has been places just for "VIP persons" who as I have seen gave no sign of interest what was goin on. It looked like that somebody "normal" who gives damn about his music is able to view the event just because they can not have it somewhere on a closed place.  I was standing on the left with some guys considering themselves "hardcore fans" on the street which was closed. He (Sting) was really great (though looking a little bit tired, oh My) but there was really no fun cause we were there standing like sardins.  Now I see that the old local truth - if something is for free you better dont pick it up - has been confirmed again.  G.

       urlLink     I have received an IM from a sub from Italy - he had some comments on My previous article "How to turn vanilla into Domina" from Friday. hes writing that he has made all the steps I suggested with next the answers (please dont laugh)  1) "i love you too much to do it with you"  2) "i am not interesed because i like only what mama told me" 3) "but...if...i tie you to the bed and i will have an heart attach (or vice versa), what can say neighbourghs"  It is a real shame that some of Us Women dont want to try the Dominant side of life and can be really "creative" only when it comes to denying... Well, I hope not everyone have had the same creative "No" cause I dont have really all the time in the world to show you that it is not this way always... I am curiously waiting for other comments on the article...  G.

       urlLink    You may very well ask yourself if you like what you read- how to start a thing like this - a blog -yourself? Well, it is very very easy. All you need to do is just register  urlLink here , give some information about yourself (though you may very well leave all the blanks empty) and you may start! What to write? Your opinions on nearly everything, a diary, you may leave there your work projects, comments - its easy as one two three really.  You may want to download the hello messenger  urlLink here . It is good for 3 things: 1. post pictures via it to your blog, 2. add comments - it is as you would type something into yahoo messenger and after pressing enter it would publish the text on a webpage, 3. to communicate with others and easily share this way pictures. It is also possible to add your own articles via email.   I am really not very much into making webpages or whatever at all cause I have no clue about programming but this is really very easy, smart and impressing way of expressing yourself.

       urlLink     A quote from todays news: "Saudi Arabia has  urlLink lifted a ban  that kept women from jobs in most fields in what analysts see as a way of fighting "terrorism" and boosting the economy."  One would question how much time should run in rivers to finally at least be born wherever in this planet as a woman and have the same right as a man.  I just looked on  urlLink alt  how many FemDom's do have a profile from Saudi Arabia. I consider it as an "index of power women possess in the local community" - and have found not nothing worth mentioning. All said.  G.

      I am receiving and endless stream of offers for 24/7 D/s... I have to always think about this kind of offer that the person has no family, no friends and no job and I call them simply "Dreamers" - in fact what they do is just sitting 24/7 before the screen and having no real life. There is a funny comics as My reply:   urlLink      Take it easy on yourself...  G.

       urlLink    Hmmm using the new gmail now for 1 day - I thought after yahoo has introduced 100 MB mailbox, I will stay because there is no real reason switching because of space. I was WRONG. Why is gmail so fantastic?  1. Fast. OMG how incredibly fast. Faster then google.com. You click on something- it opens. Instantly. PS I am not connected by adsl.  2. Conversations. Great idea. You are able to see the whole chain of mails from the very first to the very last - the whole replys and so.  3. You can use shortcuts - except of clicking. You hit c - and you are composing a mail. You just have to remember which key stands for which commmand. Easy.  I bet you find yourself mailing more, much more - cause it is easier, damn easier, a lot more convenient and you are able to write a mail from a "cold start" to hitting "send" faster then in your MS Outlook.  No return - sorry yahoo, even the new interface and all ... simply ages behind. Take a look if you do have the chance.  G.

       urlLink     I was just watching yesterday a pathetic britney video on MTV (bored to hell) and it came to My mind that there are some songs with titles screaming with D/s. So the MTV FemDom chart of the week 06/07 - 06/13 is as follows:  1. B. Spears     - I'm a slave for you 2. Jay Z         - Excuse me miss 3. P. McCartney  - Mistress and maid 4. Kevon Edmonds - 24/7 5. B. Spears     - Hit me baby one more time  If you do know about a song which would fit, do not hesitate to leave a comment.  G.
