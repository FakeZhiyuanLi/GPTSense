       A potential Democratic candidate against Crapo?   Man claiming he's God arrested in Buhl  11:04 AM MST on Wednesday, March 24, 2004 - Associated Press   BUHL -- Buhl police say an armed man -- accompanied by his five children and saying he was God -- demanded 40 dollars from convenience store clerks.   Forty-two-year-old George Crider of Castleford was charged Tuesday with felony injury to a child. Authorities were considering additional charges.   An affidavit by Detective Karen Trent said the man, wearing a gun on his hip, walked into the Oasis Stop 'N' Go Monday night and asked two clerks if he could have 40 dollars.   He said it was O-K to give him the money, because he was God. They didn't give him the money and he left.   The affidavit says his five-year-old son, carrying unpurchased toys, tried to follow but was stopped by a clerk.   The detective said the man returned, slammed the door, demanded that the clerk give the items back and again demanded 40 dollars.   The clerks said they would call the police and the man left and was arrested a short time later.   The five children were turned over to family members.

       THE BUILDUP 	  The buildup to a campaign is a time of great intrigue, gossip, parlor games, and speculation.  Generally speaking very little of it is accurate.  Potential candidates, political observers, journalists, and political hangers-on are all engaged in a game of determining who has the best, most current, and most outlandish gossip.  While the residents of “political gossip world” ply their trade, real potential candidates are lying awake at night contemplating the rather incoherent and mixed feelings they are having.  Potential candidates each day are shaving the face of the next governor in the mirror and applying their lipstick in the rearview mirror to the face of the next U S Senator.  But the ones without delusions are also nauseous at the prospect of giving over the next months or year of their lives to a cause that will be uphill, demeaning, and embarrassing on the best of days.  Both attitudes and activities are valid.  A successful candidate needs a healthy mix of outsized ego to withstand the brickbats and humility to keep the fear of God coursing through them so they knock on the doors needed and make the fundraising calls to pay for the barrage of letters and advertisements that will hopefully “move numbers”.  At this point in the process a small group of people who make their living (or who derive life’s meaning from politics if they are unpaid) are sitting in fluorescent lit conference rooms going through lists of districts around a state and trying desperately to come up with the right name to fill a slot on the ballot so the unwinnable seat in East Bratslovia won’t go uncontested.    Or they are trying to find the candidate who can run and win in the primary to knock out the extremist who won despite all odds and logic in the last election.  Now that the pros have been proven wrong and a formerly discarded district has proven winnable, the pros spring back into action to orchestrate the right person into the race.  Most of this never works.  But it is delicious fun to watch the machinations.  Now is the time when fairly unpleasant people summon all their unctuous charm and work the phones to convince candidates to put aside long-held goals and dreams in favor of pursuing a better seat because another person with more time in the trenches wants to run in that slot.  This process isn’t about good governance – it’s about making sure that the slots are filled and the annoying fundamentalist is pitted against the sainted chamber of commerce director to ensure they don’t have a chance of winning and embarrassing the party in November. The pitch is always the same:  “I’ve been looking at Smith’s voting record and I think you stack up better against Jones because your strengths and Jones’ weaknesses are a better contrast.”  “The truth is that Marcia is going through a really rough divorce and she shouldn’t be running, so she will be sufficiently distracted and will be an easier candidate to beat.”  “I’ll tell you that damn district is difficult to win – I don’t know why you aren’t throwing your hat into the Commissioner’s race – there’s a much better chance of winning that seat than this one.”  Until a few days before filing deadline, and then the script changes:  “Jane, please.  This primary will be so divisive – would you consider an appointment to the state Dental Commission in exchange for not running?  I know we can get the Guv to buy off on that.”  “Mark, dammit.  You’ll never get the party to back you if you run against Claude.  I know he can’t hear, collapsed on the House floor twice last year, and mistakenly voted twice to cut off all funds for kindergarten, but he’s an icon and no one wants him to go out this way.”  And my personal favorite: “What’s your price to not make this race?”  And the filing deadline comes, and all members of the party committee trudge to the bars to drink heavily and assess how long and intense the shower will have to be to cleanse them of their candidate recruitment sins.  Journalists wait at the Secretary of State’s office, getting the updated printouts of the candidate filing lists and laughing at the harried party volunteers racing with faxed, forged forms and $50 checks to pay fees to ensure the single strongest slate of candidates we’ve had in years is put to bed.  Hapless candidates from the hinterlands inadvertently file for seat A when they needed to run for seat B, thus setting up primaries in one half of a district while the other goes unopposed.  Place holder candidates begin wondering if in fact they really should run after all instead of bowing out - even though the deal was cut weeks ago that they would step aside when Kim Marshall was ready to run just one month after the filing deadline, because she will be the strongest candidate and just needed time to take care of a few work issues before moving forward.  Consultants pull the names of the new candidates to do some background checks to see which ones have money and are targets for getting some “message work”.   Lobbyists go through the lists to see which districts they are going to get screwed in, which ones they will have to pick a side and play ball, and which ones they’ll have to begin the process of buying themselves new votes all over again due to retirements and ambition leading their wholly-owned subsidiaries to the siren-song of higher office.  Potential campaign managers call through the list trying to schedule breakfasts, lunches, and coffees to suck up to an entirely new group of targets for work.  Journalists retire to their bars to find out which candidates have the best scoop and place bets on how long before the election the goods will get dumped.  And most pathetic of all, newspaper readers scan the names of the candidates for a total of 16 seconds on their way to reading Heloise or the local college game wrap-up, not caring even remotely about this list of people who will be determining how much their kids schools will get funded and how much of their taxes will shift to the ag subsidy caucus in the house revenue and taxation committee without so much as a recorded vote.  The campaign season officially begins.

      If you're from the Northeast and anywhere less than 45 or so, you grew up with Bruce Springsteen.  I'd do this just to have him give another concert.  I finally saw Springsteen in concert in Portland, Oregon in 2002.  Broke my hand at the concert tripping UP a flight of concrete stairs, but had to stay to the end.  Worth every pain-filled, self-anesthetizing (beer only) moment.  Check out this site: www.draftbruce.com or click the Bruuuuuce headline above and sign the petition!

      A Matter of Faith By DAVID BROOKS  Published: June 22, 2004 When Bill Clinton was 8, he started taking himself to church. When he was 10, he publicly committed himself to Jesus. As a boy, he begged his Sunday school teacher to take him to see Billy Graham. And as anybody watching his book rollout knows, he still exudes religiosity. He gave Dan Rather a tour of his Little Rock church, and talked about praying in good times and bad.  More than any other leading Democrat, Bill Clinton understands the role religion actually plays in modern politics. He knows Americans want to be able to see their leaders' faith. A recent Pew survey showed that for every American who thinks politicians should talk less about religion, there are two Americans who believe politicians should talk more.   And Clinton seems to understand, as many Democrats do not, that a politician's faith isn't just about litmus test issues like abortion or gay marriage. Many people just want to know that their leader, like them, is in the fellowship of believers. Their president doesn't have to be a saint, but he does have to be a pilgrim. He does have to be engaged, as they are, in a personal voyage toward God.  Clinton made this sort of faith-based connection, at least until he sullied himself with the Lewinsky affair. He won the evangelical vote in 1992, and won it again in 1996. He understood that if Democrats are not seen as religious, they will be seen as secular Ivy League liberals, and they will lose.  John Kerry doesn't seem to get this. Many of the people running the Democratic Party don't get it either.   A recent Time magazine survey revealed that only 7 percent of Americans feel that Kerry is a man of strong religious faith. That's a catastrophic number. That number should be the first thing Kerry strategists think about when they wake up in the morning and it should be the last thing on their lips when they go to sleep at night. They should be doing everything they can to change that perception, because unless more people get a sense of Kerry's faith, they will feel no bond with him and they will be loath to trust him with their vote.  Yet his campaign does nothing. Kerry talks about jobs one week and the minimum wage the next, going about his wonky way, each day as secular as the last.  It's mind-boggling. Can't the Democratic strategists read the data? Religious involvement is a much, much more powerful predictor of how someone will vote than income, education, gender or any other social and demographic category save race.  Can't the Democratic strategists feel it in their bones how important this is? After all, when you go out among the Democratic rank and file, you find millions of Democrats who are just as religious as Republicans. It's mostly in the land of Democratic elites that you are likely to find yourself among religious illiterates.  But of course this is the problem. Forests have been felled so people could publish articles and books on the religious right's influence on the Republican Party. But as the Baruch College political scientists Louis Bolce and Gerald De Maio have suggested, the real political story of the past decade has been the growing size and cohesion of the secular left, and its growing influence on the Democratic Party.   According to the American Religious Identification Survey, the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has more than doubled since 1990. There is now a surging but unself-conscious power bloc within the Democratic Party.  Like the religious right in the Republican Party, the members of the secular left are interested primarily in social issues. What unites them more than anything else is a strong antipathy to pro-lifers and fundamentalists. While 75 percent of Americans feel little or no hostility to fundamentalists, people in this group are far more hostile to them than to other traditional Democratic bête noires, the rich or big business. They don't like to see their politicians meddling with religion in any way.  Just as Republicans have to appeal to religious conservatives but move beyond them, Democrats have to appeal to the secular left but also build a bridge to religious moderates. Bill Clinton did this. John Kerry hasn't. If you want to know why Kerry is still roughly even with Bush in the polls, even though Bush has had the worst year of any president since Nixon in 1973 or L.B.J. in 1968, this is one big reason.

      From the Idaho Falls Post Register - by Marty Trillhaase   Idaho's democracy: 1890-2004  Idaho's democracy, born with such promise on July 3, 1890, passed away on May 11. It was just shy of its 114th birthday and had been in failing health for most of the past 10 years.  An autopsy revealed the following:  * Idaho's once-robust electorate had atrophied. Only half of the voters bothered to show up. Last month's primary had one of the lowest turnouts in recent years.  Voters were also less informed. They didn't read newspapers as much. Weakened by well-meaning reforms, political parties engaged in less voter education. Money took over and much of it came in big chunks from special interests. In Idaho's last election, for example, just 73 contributors provided 20 percent of the $7.85 million spent on campaigns.  * Competition disappeared. The supply of sacrificial lambs and millionaires willing to spend their own money to create the illusion of campaign contests ran out.  Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, became the first Idaho incumbent re-elected by default since the 17th Amendment to the Constitution set up direct election of senators in 1913. Democrats failed to come up with an opponent by the May 11 deadline.  For the moment, 1st District Congressman Butch Otter, R-Idaho, also has no opponent. Democrat Naomi Preston intends to withdraw. If that stands, it would be the first time since Idaho got its two congressional districts in 1918 that an incumbent won without a fight. Democrats plan to name a replacement in a couple of weeks.  And the campaign for Idaho's Legislature is all but over. Of Idaho's 70 House seats, 34 are already decided - for lack of serious opposition. Of the 35 Senate seats, 15 are essentially uncontested.  * Politicians started giving Idaho voters the brush-off. Last week, Crapo and his fellow Republican Sen. Larry Craig voted against Idaho's interests, their own governor and their fellow Idaho Republicans in the House to back the Department of Energy's ploy to leave some high-level radioactive wastes - and thereby save money - in South Carolina. It's a precedent Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said could hurt Idaho's ability to get its wastes cleaned up and removed from the INEEL.  State Senate Majority Leader Bart Davis, R-Idaho Falls, and Senate Pro Tem Bob Geddes, R-Soda Springs, pushed the state to cough up an estimated $50,000 to $60,000 to overturn the voter-passed tribal gaming initiative. Davis did so even though his own constituents supported the gaming pact.  When Kempthorne appointed his former chief of staff and Republican Ÿber lobbyist Phil Reberger to the council responsible for nominating and policing judges, nobody stopped him.  And nobody seemed all that upset about high-level appointees trading on their political connections. Kempthorne's natural resource adviser, Scott Turlington, went to work for Tamarack Resort near the Cascade Reservoir. The resort needed and got a 49-year lease of state lands during the time Turlington advised the governor.  The State Board of Education's chief academic officer, Randy Thompson, signed up as vice president for marketing and business development for the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence. Before that, he helped the outfit get State Board approval so it could sell computerized tests to certify Idaho's public school teachers.  Idahoans aren't condemned to this fate. They could allow parties to fill ballot vacancies more easily. And public financing of campaigns would yield a dividend of real choice at the ballot box.  But without that, this corpse is headed to the morgue.  May our late democracy rest in peace.  Marty Trillhaase

      There's a lot of concern within Democrat circles that Naomi Preston, Idaho's 1st CD Democratic candidate, isn't proving to be a person of her word.  Many Democratic insiders tried to talk her out of quitting the race initially (more than once) when she began to have misgivings about her decision to run.  But she decided to quit anyway for theoretically legitimate reasons - at least the ones she gave publicly.  The party went out and recruited another candidate, who would have been terrific.  Yet here comes Naomi to change her mind - again.  And unfortunately many of the people that initially supported her aren't now.  Wayne Hoffman of the Idaho Statesman wrote a story from the Demo State Convention that addressed some leadership concerns.  The media is starting to pick up on the dissension...  The following is from Dave Oliveria's online blog at The Idaho Spokesman Review:  "'She's in, she isn't, she's in' Dunno how I missed Wayne Hoffman's report about the state Demo convention at Pocatello here. But one insider tells me that the grafs toward the end about Naomi Preston are pregnant with understatement. Preston? She's the cowgirl who planned to take on U.S. Rep. Butch Otter in the 1st Congressional District race. And then dropped out. And now wants back in. And has gone thru a campaign manager or two already. With or without a cooperative wannabe, the Demos have little chance of winning this seat. But they have enough problems trying to make gains in the Legislature without having to fight their own wannabe in an important race." Find it at: www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/nhb/

       When not obsessing with the feet of paid ladies of the evening, Dick Morris has been known to have some good political sense.&nbsp; This is his take on his former boss's speech last night.    July 27, 2004 -- THE master returned to center stage last night as Bill Clinton showed how to address a convention and use issues to win elections. Facing a national consensus that terror, Iraq and homeland security are the key issues, Bill Clinton dragged America back to the domestic issues on which Democrats retain a strong edge. Long after Clinton's recitation of his own achievements has faded, his effort to reinject health care, Social Security, Medicare, drug prices, education and crime into the national debate may endure...    urlLink New York Post Online Edition: postopinion

      This book ("Father Joe - The Man Who Saved My Soul") and its author, was profiled on National Public Radio in June.  I was taken by the author, Tony Hendra, who is a completely irreverent former editor of Spy Magazine and National Lampoon, classmate of several of the Monty Pythons (Cleese and Chapman), and screenwriter of lots of classic comic sketches.  As proof of the six degrees, I bought the book recently and the acknowledgements thanked a priest in Boise, Idaho who shared a name with a long-time priest friend of my wife's family that I've gotten to meet a few times.  I tracked down the author Tony Hendra by email and he responded rapidly that in fact the two Father Tom Fauchers were one and the same.  Turns out Fr. Tom was equally impacted by Father Joe as was Tony Hendra, and they struck up a friendship.  Anyway, enough blather - go out and get this book.  It's good for the soul.  mk

      Having grown up with Springsteen and gone to college contemporaneously with two Dixie Chicks, this hits close to home.   Springsteen asked a valid question on the Ted Koppel show tonight - why is it that only entertainers are challenged on who they think they are by getting politically active? Republicans don't question business leaders who weigh in.   I for one am glad to see these folks speaking out and using their talents in service to a cause.     urlLink CNN.com - Springsteen, Dixie Chicks stumping against Bush - Aug 4, 2004
