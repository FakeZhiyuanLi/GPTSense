      Yup, it's official. Spider-Man 2 is the best movie ever. More in the morning.  Tired, sleep. Wanna be a superhero.

      D'oh! Missed a whole day in the daily posting thing! Is this the sign of a new trend?   Man, do I feel burned out. I seriously need a vacation. Planning on having some insightful observations about humanity here, but it just might have to wait 'till tomorrow.

      Friday at last! I would normally be at work right now doing this, but today, I wasn't feeling too good, and decided to stay home. Of course, that doesn't actually mean that I can rest and feel better; completely the opposite. I need to clean up this place to make room for some visitors that I'll be having later on... well, next month. Hey, if you saw what kind of mess that this place is, you'd need a few weeks to clean it too. Of course, I don't really know who "you" are, but I'll keep refering to it as though we were familiar with each other. Hell, if there's someone out there reading my thoughts, then I might as well pretend that I know you. So, there. Yup.

      Hmmm. Another journal to record my thoughts in. This sort of thing is supposed to be good  for you, right? But I can never seem to keep up with these damned things. Is this wise? Should I be starting a new journal with the full knowledge that it may end up like the last few?  You're supposed to update these things on a day to day basis, yeah? Recording thoughts, feelings, and day to day events and your take on them, all the while trying to understand the reactions and things that go into your thoughts. I've never really been able to keep up with that kind of thing. Not that I don't have thoughts, but more that I never really had the need to put them on paper. It's probably the perfectionist in me, knowing that I'll end up looking back on this someday, and saying "damn, what a fool I was back then".   Should I do this then? Write something that I know will make me feel like a fool sometime in the future?  Yeah, what the hell.

      So, it's the final weekend that she's gonna be here and I'm kinda excited to see her again today. If I get to see her, that is. Things have been going well lately, and I think I've finally found my place in this strange little relationship. At the very least, I can look at the Looney's and see that this whole thing worked out for them. And if it worked out once, then it should be repeatable (unless that's just the scientist in me talking). Well, I'll get more into this later. Still have a few things that I'd like to get out of the way before she gets here.  Maybe. Probably. Yeah.

      Just came back from Comic-Con International yesterday, and I have to say that it was damned fun. Next year can be even better with some proper planning and neat costumes.     Show highlights:    Half naked women  Cool freebies  Neat sketches  Finding neat new geek stuff    Hopefully next year I'll be able to go with both of the women that I love (though that may make for an odd hotel situation). Ah, well, we'll see.     Enough of an update for now, more some other time.

      And now I miss her. Sheesh. Who thought that one person could make this kind of an impact in one week. We spent the day with her yesterday, got some good food and shopped around. Then we spent some quality time in bed, reading and other things. We made plans to cosplay at anime expo next year, and we came up with a variety of costumes that should work for the three of us. After that, I drove her to her folks place in Ventura. We held hands most of the way up (resulting in a cramp for me). She'll be back here in about a week; she's going to a family reunion. Aiya... part of me can't wait 'til she comes back, while another part is deathly afraid.   I mean, what if she's changed her mind about us in the next week? What if she's decided that the whole thing is kinda stupid, and that she was just doing it on a lark. This is a serious thing for me, but what if she feels like it's a fling? Man, I kinda just want to talk to her about it, but I'm nervous about doing that too.    This is dumb. I love her, and that's all that really matters, isn't it? I just want her to be happy, and know that she'll never be alone. It doesn't matter if she doesn't reciprocate the feelings, does it? I mean, I know that she does, from the way she talks to me and acts around me when we're alone. Well, at least I hope she does. It's all a matter of interpretation, isn't it? Ah, it's a good thing I have this journal. It feels good to get all this insecurity crap out of my head. When She gets back here from her trip, I plan on showing her a grand ol' time. I want her to always remember that I love her, and I want her to have an experience that she won't soon forget.

      Yeah, I love her, what's wrong with that. Why do I love her? Everything she likes appeals to me. We have a lot in common, some of which she doesn't even know about because I've chosen not to tell her. I find her to be someone who always tries to do the right thing, even though they don't always succeed. She's beautiful on the inside, with the kind of wonder that makes a person open their eyes wide and see the world for what it really is. She's nice, caring, sensitive (though she tries to hide it), and intelligent. Being around her makes the world a little less of a dismal place. Hell, she even loves the same (other) woman that I do. What could be wrong with this?

      So, can one man love two women? One of the age old questions of time, aina? And what if neither woman objects, then what? Man, have I got some strange conundrums in my life recently.  I found someone else that I really do care and she'll be going home today. I'm gonna miss her.

      The most frustrating thing has been plaguing me for the last week. Laryngitis. No voice. It really wouldn't be that much of a big deal, normally, but one of my most favorite (is that how you say that? Stupid grammar.) people in the world is visiting me for a limited time only, and it would be nice to talk to her without sounding like a creepy stalker. Right now, I've resorted to not saying a whole hell of a lot and instead trying to be expressive with my face and actions. Of course, that doesn't really work that well...  But the frustration! The way that it builds up within my head; all those little things that have to remain unsaid on my part, all the quizzical looks from the people that I'm trying to talk with, having to repeat myself over, and over, and over, and over again!!! Just having a phone and not being able to answer it when it rings is enough to drive a man mad! Every time that I wake up, I hope to have a little bit of my voice back. Just enough to talk to Liz without having to resort to a crappy little whisper. I dunno.   Just needed to vent I guess.   This makes me think about the human need to communicate, but I'm too pissed about my situation to actually write anything about it.   Oh, Hell.

      Ok, so I haven't been keeping up for a few days, but I have a really good reason! I've just been really sick lately; the kind of sick that you don't just get up from. Hell, I've even lost my voice and haven't been able to communicate with anyone at all. Kinda makes you feel lonely, you know? Ah, well, enough whining for now. Gotta clean the room, I'm gonna have a house guest tomorrow!

      Ok, ok, so I missed a couple of days. Not that big of a deal, considering that I eventually got back to it.  Watching Spider-Man 2 got me to thinking what the nature of a hero is. I mean, what does it really mean to be heroic? I've always heard that true courage is the ability to face something that you're afraid of, but that doesn't really explain what true heroics could be. More on this later, since I'm at work and should be working.

						    Okay, you have to go see Avp!  It is sooooo cool! I'm not going to say anything more though, because it would be redundant because of Krispy's post and because I might give something away.      Also, on a lighter note, I found out that since my grades are getting better (it might also have to do with the fee increases which really don't affect me, but either way, extra money is cool), and I am going to be getting about $600 at the end of the month instead of $300!  It is great!  I love leftover finanial aid!  More to spend on myself and Krispy and you, Mieko-chan!  I am just so excited....I also want to put some of it away, though.  I try to save money, I really do, but it is a real pain.  Emergencies and that occasional rare chance comes along more often than my willpower kicks in, so that's that.  Nest egg gone, just like that.        I am also feeling like drawing something today, but Krispy wants me to write instead.  I would like to do that too, so let's see what happens tonight.        We are also going to send your package tomorrow Mieko-chan, so expect it on Monday or Tuesday.  ^_^      Love you!

						   And ain't they though? Saw Aliens Vs. Predator at a midnight showing last night and it kicked some major ass. It was kinda like having Jack and Coke for the first time; at first you're a little concerned about whether or not it tastes good, then you nervously take a sip and find yourself enjoying it. I'll talk about it more when I know that Mieko-sama has seen it, as I wouldn't want to spoil anything for her.  In other news... classes are about to start soon, and the makes me nervous to no end. I don't know why, I guess it's because of the way that last semester went, with the only class that I took being a computer interface course. It's been awhile since I've done any real hardcore theoretical number crunching, and that makes me feel like I may not be prepared for it. I guess I'll have to buckle down and review all that nice maths that I went ahead and forgot. :P  Card-wise I'm still struggling with that new lion deck concept. I'm thinking that I may have to wait until Wrath comes out before I can really try it, but I'd like to at least lay down the framework for a good deck so that I'll have an idea of where to go with it.  Really, the only thing the deck needs to do is hand Mieko and Rose their asses. Yup. A collective ass-hander is what I'm trying to design in lion. (although it is wierd that I didn't get to play Mieko the whole time she was here. maybe she's scared?)   Ah, well, enough for now. I gots more things to say, but I don't wanna use it all up right now.  Love you Mieko and Rose.

						    Yeah, gonna play some City of Heroes and Heroclix tonight, then going to try to catch a midnight showing of Alen vs. Predator (am I looking like a big nerd yet? Yup, thought so). Will post afterward sometime to let you know whether or not it was worth it. That's about it, really....I really missed you the last couple of days, Mieko-chan. What can I say, a day doesn't feel quite complete anymore until I get a chance to talk to you at least once. Here's to hoping that we can call you more often in the future. :) Bye for now, and love you both.

						    Well, since I am here at Krispy's work with him today, I decided to get some work done that was assigned to me by him/his family. While I like helping out people, I do feel unappreciated sometimes, especially when they ask me to do something that I feel that they can do their own darn selves...although I do get compensated fairly well for my efforts, most of the time.  Not this time, though...  ...today's item on the menu is a CSS Profile for Krispy's sister. I have never had to fill one out for my school before, so I have no friggin' clue on how to do it. Plus, I think his sister could have done it easier if she had just listed down what info she needed from us and gone from there because there is a lot more from her side that I don't know. Instead, she leaves me but a fraction of the necessary info that I need and asks for me to do it because she doesn't know when she will have internet access again. Why couldn't she have done it when she had the internet access?!? Sorry, but I worry about other people, more than I should. Which is why when something like this comes up, I get extra-special streesed out and infuriated. I can't wait for the day (if there will even be one) in the future when I will have enough money to hire everyone their own personal secretary/accountant/paper-pushing whore. Which is certainly how I feel sometimes. Okay, done venting.  I also get to work the last couple of hours worth of shift for a co-worker today. He covers for me a lot during Convention season, so I didn't mind much. Plus this is more pay that will go towards a couple of boxes of Wrath of the Emperor, including the pre-release. :)  We are also going to try to get to a midnight showing of Alien vs. Predator, because getting to movies suring the actual opening day isn't as easy as it used to be now that I am working Friday nights.  Let's see, what else do I need to do? Oh yeah, I have to make sure Krispy updates his resume and that it gets sent out and dangled in front of the right faces so he will hopefully have a job in the industry by the time he finishes his Thesis. Fun stuff. :P  Hope to hear from you soon, Mieko-chan. I love you, and miss you a lot. I love you too, Krispy!

						   Hey there, I'm actually back at work now, finally grinding away at my research. I'm planning on starting the actual thesis writing within the next week or so. Until then, I'm going to be working on data analysis and programming. At some point today, I need to stop by the comic shop to pick up this weeks new releases, as well as any new stuff that Rose or Mieko might want. Also, Rose is going to be working her job tonight after 8 pm. (Of course you know, that means that I'm going to be playing City of Heroes for the rest of the night).  I'm starting on some new writing, the goal of which is to get my creative ass in gear and actually create something (yeah, I actually do want to stay in the laboratory for the rest of my life, but I'd also like to contribute something to the scifi/fantasy community that I call home). So I'm going to get on that now... Or something :P  Until next time, aishite to mieko and rose, and  FIAWOL

						      Well, since this is my first *real* post, I thought I would get all elaborate and mess with the fonts and color settings and stuff.  Today was more or less another relaxation day, although Krispy and I went to Best Buy and a couple other DVD stores and ended up getting Kill Bill vol. 2 ,  Unbreakable, and the first season of Dead Like Me.  Hadn't seen it or heard of it before, but Krispy seemed real excited to try it out, so we got it and are watching it right now.  It's a great show, I'm happy to report.  :)  Other than that, nothing much is going on.   We are going to wake up earlier tomorrow so that Krispy can go to work, and we can go to the gym and work some pudge off.   Also, unless Krispy's mom forgets, we will be going to her place in the morning to help her out with reorganizing some of the stuff in her garage.  I am not oh-so-happy to do it per se, but she is a nice woman who needs our help, and it will only be for an hour or two, so it shouldn't be too bad.  I have been thinking of trying to get some writing done before school, just for the hell of it.  I have a bunch of ideas that have been waiting for me to do something with them for a long ass time, I just haven't gotten around to starting on any of it as of yet.  Maybe there is still some time, I don't know.  Well, that's about it for now.  Hope to see this thing grow and prosper as a way for us to just kinda' talk and stuff.  It would be a neat thing to look back on sometime later.  Bye all.  Love you, Kaneshiro and Mieko-chan.

						   Cool I finally got this thing working right. It's really kind of cool. I'm really hoping that this'll keep us closer together n' stuff. Yeah, I know, I'm nerdy. But hey, ya'll are gonna have to deal with it, you know?  Tee Hee...  Yeah, tomorrow, I'm gonna go to work and actually do some work for once. After that, I'm planning on stopping by the comic book store to go and buy stuff. Ne, Mieko-chan, expect to get a package of some kind pretty soon, ok? Madore-chan, by the way, we're going to the comic book store tomorrow.  Love you guys. Miss you Mieko. Very much so.  Let's try to make this journal thing work out, ok?
