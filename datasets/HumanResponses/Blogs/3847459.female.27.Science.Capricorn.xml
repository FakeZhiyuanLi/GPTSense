      Okay, so maybe this isn't a unique thought, but it is for my brain. I have come to the realization that colleges and universities create programs so bloody specific that companies end up looking for people ONLY who have these speciaizations. They do this of course so they will make money off the suckers like us who attend these programs.     Now is it just me, or the following programs a f*&@ing joke?      Office Administration -You need a diploma to be able to answer the phone, make appointments and photocopy things? I can see maybe taking a course in Microsoft office, but hello? You can learn as you go along...   Volunteer Management   As a trained social worker this one always makes me laugh. Here's the deal, I learned all that shit in social work, but now I can't be a volunteer coordinator because all these assholes get the jobs instead of me.    Police Foundations    Okay, you have to go to college for two years, then go to police college. WHY? They reteach you everything at police college only now you know it better. Firefighters also get this...these are people who are saving out lives, I guess it is nice that that are overeducated...    retail florist   So if I have worked in retail for a while and am really good at arraigning flowers I will be lost without this program right?       Anything relating to retail management, or merchandising If you want one of those jobs just graduate high school, save your $10,000 apply full-time at a retail chain with good abilities to advance and you will. Retail is easy (I've done it). And people get pissed off in it so easily that they move around a lot, therefore making your chances of advancement greater.   Now on to universities If you are going to put some letters behind your name here are some points:  B.A.=crappy job in retail, sales, customer service unless you upgrade to M.A. and Ph.D and the worst of all...LLB B.COMM=Job, it may start off slow, but it will grow. You may be a capitalist bastard taking over the world, but idlest your education took you somewhere. B.SC This is a tricky one. Some B.Sc get good jobs, but many also have to upgrade to M.SC and Ph.Ds or whatever the hell it is to be a medical doc, dentist etc.     Here are the most useless majors according to me:    Philosophy-all this will do is allow you to think in a way that will make everyone else think you are obnoxious and weird.   Sociology-You can study groups-great...do you see ads wanting group studiers in the local newspapers, NO! Because it is a stupid major! You may think it will help you in business, but that kid who applied with the B.Comm before you already go the job.   Psychology-This just turns you into a nervous reck full of psychosomatic symptoms. And to go anywhere you need an M.A or Ph. D  Art-Yes, art is great, but lets face it, you won't get a job in a museum because some asshole somewhere has decided to create a museum person course at the local community college, thus ousting you from the position.   Music-Yeah...I think Britney Spears, 50 Cent, and Nickelback all when to university to study music and that is why they are so famous. C'mon...Music? Be a teacher 'cause that's all you can do with that degree.   English-All you will do with English is make yourself one of those annoying bastards who constantly corrects people's spelling and grammar. Better apply to teachers college or you'll be correcting people when they say "can I biggy size that order?"  History-Again apply to teachers college or hope to get on jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire 'cause you ain't going anywhere with this one!  Math-hello who cares, go be an account already.  oh and to end the list properly  Women's Studies-so you will learn the world according to women. What do you think this will get you a job in? You won't be able to work at a shelter with abused women because you need social work skills for that. Maybe you can hop on a plane and start helping women in other sexist countries to rise up...but this will probably pay nothing and get you killed.   Well that is my thoughts on the useless waste of time of post-secondary education.   P.S. To the english major who read this and has written down the grammatical and spelling errors, you do know where you can put that piece of paper right?
