      "...there is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment. A man's whole life is a succession of moment after moment. If one fully understands the present moment, there will be nothing else to do and nothing else to pursue." - Yamamoto's Hagakure&nbsp;

      That common saying that "it's never summer in the sunset" is probably true from the looks of things over there today. But I can't say much more for the rest of the city, either. It's that whole  coastal  thing, I guess. It's probably soaring into the 90's less than 50 miles East of here, but we'll never feel it, even though it's July 29th and we're in the very THICK of summer.   On days like this, it's easy to miss the dense heat of summer mornings in Roanoke, Virginia.   Although it isn't easy to forget the way it feels, it's still hard to imagine that someone else is feeling that heat right now at this very&nbsp;moment.   ...the buzzing of insects, the flashes of fireflies at night, the steady chirp of crickets outside the open bedroom window on warm nights. It's an almost lonely feeling that&nbsp;this kind of reverie brings.   Harder still is it to imagine the tranquility of the Nigerienne desert landscape after the oppressive sun has set and the final call to prayer has ended. From far above, one would be able to point out the tiny fires that dot the landscape at night, revealing the modest settlements of the Fulani and Bela pastorialists who have long resided far from the local towns. Those towns, one would notice, produce the same red spots of cookfires along the circumference of larger groups of light, including traces of white light from whatever scarce source of electricity exists there--perhaps a single Al Haji shopkeeper's storefront or the dim glow of the 10-inch television screen that serves the entire neighborhood with a sort of open-air theatre. Children and elderly alike flock in droves to surround the tiny screen that sits on a short stack of large mud bricks outside the shopkeeper's  concession . They love the low-budget Spanish soap operas, dubbed into French (another language they don't understand) and aired with nighly regularity, usually following highlights of the latest presidential address on the state-run news programs. They laugh and talk loudly, making up their own plots to follow the images they see. Simple people, they are generous,&nbsp;lighthearted and inteliigent in all the ways that matter to them.   Their creativity knows no limits. It evolves out of a condition of scarcity. One must improvise when a breakdown on the regional highway between two towns can deliver a crippling blow to their fragile livelihood or even, in more remote areas of the extreme North, mean the choice between life or death for everyone involved. I once witnessed the inginuity of a local truck driver as he replicated his broken oil filter by hand from an empty coffee tin sealed with a rubber strap.    A sera , he said,  It's broken .   While the rest of us--villagers, travelling workers and livestock--waited in the sparse shade of the roadside  Goa  trees, the driver and his crew worked dilligently and patiently to fix the engine of the  grande camion . I walked over at one point to gaze in curiousity at their efforts and discovered that post-war German engineering, with all&nbsp;its glorious reputation of fine craftsmanship, had its limitations as well. Evidently, no matter how much constant&nbsp;maintenance you apply, you can't run a 60 year old engine&nbsp;along rugged laterite roads for years without it suffereing from the abuse. It would be like wearing a pair of plastic flip flops to hike for ten kilometers every day through thick sand and rocky terrean. The tattered rope they were using as a fanbelt was my first clue that this was not the first time they attempted to fix the ancient motor in that&nbsp;tired and rusty&nbsp;beast, but I realised that these were patient and persistent people dealing with an all-too-familiar problem for which they were well prepared.

       ...just at different points along the way.     &nbsp;   I mean, since I've started looking around at the rest of my fellow bloggers' profiles, I've noticed the&nbsp;commonalities we too often fail to notice when we pass each other on the streets on our way home... or stare shamelessly at each other, casually feigning fatigue, as we ride together on the train... or glance over at&nbsp;another reflection of ourselves&nbsp;driving in the car next to us, yes,&nbsp;the SUV that we would never own but which we're convinced somehow reveals the true personal character of its occupant.     &nbsp;   No, we're all pretty much the same. Same fractured thoughts, same incomprehensible emotions... same undeniable identity complexes...     &nbsp;   So right now I'm listening to Miles Davis on some kind of roadhouse blues-type rendition on this webstation I'm addicted to.&nbsp; Man, what happened Miles? It used to be&nbsp;you were blowin' like mad, in crazed and complex rythmic jams.&nbsp; Was it the Heroine? Why so cosmic and diffused&nbsp;... but I digress...     &nbsp;   I heard once that buddists have this notion that everyone in the world, that is, everyone you see on the streets, at the stores, in their cars, on TV, or behind bars&nbsp;is&nbsp;related to them through a kind of cosmic familial connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;I beleive it. It's hard to explain but easy to feel. I think it's got to be true, not for any logical or rational reasons (to which I happen to be prone),&nbsp;but for the same reason we are able to feel or at least imagine living another&nbsp;person's life--  which is&nbsp;unique,&nbsp;truly, but not so&nbsp;different.     &nbsp;   And why not ...&nbsp;the&nbsp;old woman sleeping on the sidewalk with dirty hair, the angry youth on the corner who stares at me&nbsp;as I pass&nbsp;(I don't break eye contact either, just give a look that demands mutual respect), or the regular on Larkin and Hemlock&nbsp;who comes out every night in her clear heals--you can tell she's not used to it yet because&nbsp;she'll soon get&nbsp;goosebumps from the cold, ...or the worst of the money-whores, the polished saleman&nbsp;who sizes me up for his own personal gain, who, with a religious beleif in his own superiority driven by a desperate attempt to survive himself, tries to&nbsp;make me the prostitute instead of himself. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   they are my mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I wonder how this nihilistic sense of the futility of humankind can coexist with a passion for humanity. And I wonder if we&nbsp;don't&nbsp;all feel this way on at least some level?

      ...is there anyone home?"   Today the fog is a high cloud covering the sunset district, leaving the rest of the city to bask in a kind of cold sun. On the ground below, the tiny people file like drone ant colonies around the towering concrete trees they've built their nests in.&nbsp;   From my perch on this tiny leaf I can see as far as the ocean and, on a clear day, even beyond to the Farallon Islands, two tiny shining humps&nbsp;on the distant horizon.&nbsp;

       One night about five years ago   my grandfather started telling stories about the war in his usual, impromptu way of swerving the conversation back to wartime Germany. It's still hard for me to keep these stories straight even though I'm susposedly the one who's been entrusted to record them. There are details that I'm sure to have forgotten since their original telling, but I'll tell them in the way I remember them being told to me. I don't make any pretense that these stories can be any more profound reflections of a time in history that is sure to have created many men like my grandfather, but they are important stories to me because they have become, by association, a part of my experience as well. Otto Thillman is one most experienced and learned sages of his generation and his wife, my grandmother, reflects the same vitality and sagacity.  Too often, I took the gentle nature of my grandmother and the quiet, although often blunt, compassion of my grandfather for granted during much of the time I was growing up. This was simply because I did not realize how different they were from others their age who I've since met and who are absent these features because they've not been as lucky to have been given a glimpse at the world that reveals its human depth and true ironic beauty.       Here are the stories he told that I remember, in the way that I remember him telling them      His Father before him   The nightly patrol   The Russian soldier in the field   The Frenchman and Italian at gun point   Escape   My Grandmother

      Fast forward to a small town in rural Oklahoma, where he was growing up on a street lined with fences and pickup trucks, tire irons hidden in overgrown lawns.  Fastforward again to a lakeside town in central Michigan on lake Huron and the gray sky scent of ancient glacial waters. Days of jumping into the Au Sable river from the lower beck of a train tressle. Nights of summer heat and mosquitoes in Michigan and Virginia.  Now once more, fast forward to Mons, Belgium, a little-know European town with cobble-stone side streets. Three years here and then to Colorado Springs, high school graduation and subsequent college days in Greeley, Colorado. What a strange adventure so far...  Then came a year in Northern Ireland, another four seasons in Colorado and the departure to Niger, West Africa.  There are too many stories to tell, to many emotions to go with each place and time... so many secrets that I will have to keep to myself for now.

      He didn't have much except vague snapshots of memory from time before then. He'd only heard stories of him crossing the busy four lanes of mainstreet traffic, clad only in a diaper, in order to climb up on the gleaming red tracktor parked in the sale lot across the street. He remembered the shine of the bright red paint that he could almost taste as he gazed at it in infantile wonderment, the feel of the hot vinyl seat he sat in when they were around to prop him up there, the hard steeling wheel. The enourmousness and complexity of it all.  He heard the stories of him climbing out of his bedroom window to throw toys down onto the lawn. How it went unnoticed until the steady rain of tiny trucks and homemade wooden cars could be seen from downstairs living room window, where eveyone sat assuming he was fast asleep up there.    He also vaguely remembered the taste of the cherry schnapps he'd found in the cabinet at his grandfather's house and the weight of the revolver in his hands. "Look Oma." He'd giggled "Pow, Pow!" Tenderly, his grandmother had removed the pistol from his 4 year old grasp, speaking softly and slowly.  Once in a while, he would encounter a scent on the street or in the country that would remind him of his early youth, but, much like the abtract atches of memory from those days, he would never be able to exactly place them.  Those were the sights and smells of being born into the world and discovering a place that was completely open to curious exploration.  That was the universe he'd arrived in and that would frame on some level the rest of his experiences in life.  They often laughed over those stories during the breif time they had to spend together during the rare holidays when the family was all together and the Denver sky was bright blue as leaves rustled or snow fell slowly over the ground.

      As far back as he could remember, he was running barefoot through the algae that grew between the concrete housing developments on that tiny tropical island. Secluded and unknown to the rest of the world, it was to him infinate. He climbed around on long-abandoned and rusted Japanese army tanks and tiptoed along the jungle paths that led to empty, cracked and potholed roads where frogs slept in warm puddles. He explored his world with the lust for adventure that lives inside every child who has discovered the limitless possibilites of how far his bare feet can take him.
