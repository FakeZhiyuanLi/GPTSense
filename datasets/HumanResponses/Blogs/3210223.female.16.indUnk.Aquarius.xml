      i just thought of this... today has been a thoughful day  it drives me absolutely insane when people don't stand up and be respectful for the Pledge of Allegiance... absolutely nutty... it's like no one understands what the flag means, what kind of sacrifices and pure hell that people have gone through and are going through to save its integrity...    I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America  (that means you swear not to do the flag wrong and you pledge to be loyal to it)  And to the republic for which it stands  (that means that you also swear to be loyal and true to the country it represents)  One Nation, Under GOD, indivisible   (this is the most important part, i think... this means that we, as America, are one single nation under God... meaning that as God as our witness, we are one people, one body, one united America... indivisIble means that we can not be divided - not that we are see-through)  With Liberty, and Justice for all  (this means to you promise to treat people with liberty and justice... everyone...)  so now that you know what it means, everytime you say it, mean it.  we are the luckiest people on the planet.  say it as a tribute to fallen soldiers... Pat Tillman...  And it's a MOMENT of silence... a single minute out of our days... come on, y'all... we can do that

      here's another one i like :)      Letters from Home     By: John Michael Montgomery My dearest son its almost June I hope this letter catches up to you and finds you well. Its been dry but their calling for rain and everythings the same ole same in Johnsville. Your stubborn ole daddy aint said too much but I'm sure you know he sends his love.   And she goes on in a letter from home.  I hold it up and show my buddies like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy And they all laugh like there something funny bout the way I talk When I say momma sends her best y'all I fold it up and put it in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me driving on waiting on letters from home  My dearest love its almost dawn I've been lying here all night long wondering where you might be I saw your momma and I showed her the ring man on the televison said something so I couldn't sleep But I'll be alright I'm just missin' you and this is me kissing you Xes and Oes In a letter from home.  I hold it up and show my buddies like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy And they all laugh cause she calls me honey  They take it hard cause I don't read the good parts I fold it up and put it in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me driving on waiting on letters from home  Dear son I know I ain't written But sitting here tonight alone in the kitchen it occurs to me I might not have said it so I'll say it now son you make me proud I hold it up and show my buddies like we aint scared and our boots aint muddy But no one laughs cause there aint nothing funny when a soldier cries I just wipe my eyes  I fold it up and put it in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me driving on waiting on letters from home   again, long but well worth it... those guys over there are amazing

      here it is!      If No Body Believed In You   By:  Joe Nichols I watched him take the two strike call: He hadn't tried to swing at all I guess he'd had all that he could take He walked away for goodness sake His father's voice was loud an' mean "You won't amount to anything."  That little boy quit tryin' He just walked away There were teardrops on his face Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too If no body believed in you  That old man said "One more try, I'm know I'm not too old to try. "I promise, son, i'll do my best, "This time, I'm gonna pass the test." "Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in." His father never drove again.  That old man quit tryin' He just walked away An' there were teardrops on his face Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you  We take His name out of schools. The lawyers say it breaks the rules. Pledge of Allegiance can't be writ, An' Under God should not be said I wonder how He will take it I just pray it's not too late  What if God quit tryin' He just turned away? There were teardrops on his face? Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you  Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too If nobody believed in you.    OH YEAH!  great song... all his songs are wonderful... go to www.joenichols.com :)

      hey you guys :)  so the astros are on right now... and i'm in here... that's how you know you're important to me... i'm missing the astros game...  :)  let's see.... what's new.... NOTHING....  same old same old  oo... i was upstairs writing a letter bound for Germany, so i put some music on... i was singing while my dad and brother were gone at the store... i'd forgotten how much i love to sing, but i'm not that good... i just like it :)  mmmmm ice tea... i am convinced that is the reason northern folks aren't happy... no ice tea or cornbread... man... they dont know what they're missing  quote of the day:  (music line)  "But there's always someone at home who never forgets who you are" from the Alison Krauss + Union Station song, Broadway... beautiful music they have  joe nichols has a new song i absolutely love... it's called If No One Believed in You.  The whole song he talks about like what happens when people loose faith... at the end, he tells it from God's point of view... he says something to the effect of if they won't let us say "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance (can't spell it), would God lose faith in us?  What if God stopped believing in us because we stopped believing in Him!  oooo it's good... maybe i'll put the words up here :)  geeze i almost forgot some big news... Tim Cousins, a friend of mine who entered the Marines last July, is serving in Falujah, Iraq right now.  He needs prayers, guys... thanks  ok... this is a long one :)  peace in the middle east

      i found this in Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul on pages 96-97 a long, long time ago... this is it perfectly... this is everything i think    Have a Seat Upon a Cloud   Have a seat upon a cloud and make yourself at home. You are now inside my dreams, inside a book, inside a poem.  Where anything can happen if you only make it real Plunge into my waters if you're not afraid to feel  Take off your shoes and close your eyes, relax upon my sand Join me in the land of dreams, reach out and take my hand.  Let me share my dreams with you unitl you find your own I'll take you there if you believe, take mine out on laon  Where birds are words so gracefully they glide across the sky Leave behind your worries, here the rules do not apply  Pick my flowres if you like and plant a seed or two Paint the sky in polka dots if you do not like it blue  Climb my trees, face your fears; erase them one by one See the world from up above and don't stop at the sun  When the world starts raining down and the sun is out of sight Let your dreams control your mind and help you through the night  There's a place inside my dreams for all who care to roam So have a seat upon a cloud and make yourself at home  ----bootleg b/c i had to change a few words around... it made those 2 words into links so i had to misspell them... bootleg...------

      so... i'm going to germany tomorrow... TOMORROW...  geeze!  i can't believe how quickly this past year has gone... i'm sooooo excited about seeing all the Germans again.  i missed them all so much...  a few days ago, i realized that i wouldnt see an astros game for 3 1/2 weeks, drink ice tea for 3 1/2 weeks, eat enchiladas for 3 1/2 weeks, listen to talk radio for 3 1/2 weeks, see my Grandparent's ranch and my family for 3 1/2 weeks, talk to all my friends back here for 3 1/2 more weeks, sleep in my own bed for 3 1/2 more weeks, swim in our pool for 3 1/2 weeks, see our kitties for 3 1/2 more weeks, or see my parents for 3 1/2 more weeks... it's crazy!  i'm going to miss all of this, this life, for a while... even things i hate about it like cleaning the stairs, vacuuming pool, taking out trash, and washing dishes will seem so fictional for a while... it's really weird!  but i am really looking forward to things that i am going to see and people i am going to meet.  i am German, so seeing Germany for the first time will be awesome... aww... i'm not gonna hear my brother sing or play the guitar or say "That's awwwwwwwwesome" for a while... aww... i can honestly say i wont miss houston or the smog therin... nope... wont miss that a bit.  so if you read this before tomorrow, it will be the last entry until about June 24, maybe June 28.  goodness gracious.  thank you for being a friend (anyone ever watch that show "The Golden Girls?"  i love that show... lol...   hahahaha... ok... so my mom's friend gave my sister and i gift certificates to get our nails done.  if you know me well, you know i do not do things like this.  i dont really care about finger nails and i think its stupid to spend upwards of 10 dollars on them.  they're finger nails!  insanity... anyway, i was going to get them painted clear because that red and purple and pink just wasnt going to happen... so i sit down and this poor girl doesnt speak any english... almost not a single word.  she knows hello and goodbye... anyways, i told her that i wanted clear and she held up a bottle of white polish.  i knew that meant that she wanted to do a french manicure and i said ok because it was like whatever then... but then i changed my mind before she started and said "oh, i think i just want clear and not the french manicure..."  so she kind of nodded and said ok and kept right on going with the french manicure... i was like no i just want the clear.  she was like no this looks nice.  (HA!  that was so irritating it was funny... lol)  i think i told her again that i just wanted clear and my mom did too but she kept right on going... so now i have a french manicure.  ugh.  i'm taking it off in a few minutes for three reasons:  1.  i just think it's ugly.  2.  it doesnt fit my personality.  3.  it contains the word "french"  so... off it comes...  i have to go and get ready for Church... so... i'll talk to you all soon!!

      i've been replaced... and by whom?  oooo it makes me so mad... everything feels like its all been swept out from under me, all 2 years of my high school "career."  starting small about in august and suddenly mushrooming into this bohemeth of a shithole.  let me be stranded on an island somewhere so i can be my own friend.  works for me.  i'll have a wilson or something... maybe a rawlings cuz it'd have to be a baseball or baseball mit.  this whole like 2 weeks has sucked.  plain sucked.  i can't wait to be on that plane away from this hell-hole city and school.  please Jesus let me make it throught the next few days.  omgosh i can't stand it anymore.  that's all.  my tolerance level has been pushed to the max and its spilling over.  in english at the beginning of the year, mrs. la fleur had our parents write us letters so we could respond to them at the end of the year.  well i read mine friday and my mom was right.  and i cant even put it here because of what she was right about... geeze she was right.  i can't tell anyone, not even the person i love the most and trust the most... it sucks.  SUCKS  i'm like spitting nails.  i want to not be here anymore.  *poof* into Germany... ta da... there i go... 10 hours and i'm there.  it's getting close.  i think i'd rather spend the rest of my life on my grandparent's ranch building fences and branding cattle or mowing their super huge lawn or driving a tractor or anything on the planet and at this point, i mean that.  that's it.  hey, grandma asked... the offer is there... what keeps me here?  the few people that havent repalced me with a hipper, newer, more MTV version of myself...  i think that's all it is... there's a school within 1o mins of their ranch... i could go there... Navarro High School in Geronimo, Texas... Population: roughly 100, not including cats, dogs, chickens, cows, horses, or pigs.  i want to go somewhere where there are opend fields and corn growing and milo and conbines rolling through those fields when it's time to harvest... i want to see longhorns and goats and old rusty trucks.  i want to be free to breathe clean, sweet country air in the middle of summer far, far, far away from houston.  i want to eat watermelon and drink freshly squeezed lime-lemonade and catch fire flies in a jar... i want to pick a fresh peach or a fresh tomato from my Grandma's garden and listen to my Grandpa tell stories of being in the NAVY.  i want to live a pure, country, simple life far away from the complexities of this city... can't i just go?  i want to go to a good Catholic Church far away from St. Laurence... St. Peter and Paul's Catholic Church in the center of New Braunfels is perfect.    and to top it off, there hasnt been a day in a week that i havent cried.  but that's another entry... another gut-wrenching entry... i can only take so much heartache a night  i'm out...

      i just spent the better part of my day with my best friend in the whole world... it was great... george washington was a woman!  lol... crazinness!  we had a good time... i cant imagine ever being so close to anyone as i am to him... it's cool tho... i looked into my "center bubble" and examinined myself... and when i examined myself, I saw my best friend, someone i love and fill up on... looking inside me, i found him and every single amazing moment with him... and i hoped and i prayed to anyone that was listening that he'll be in my "center bubble" forever... like it is with a cow, he's branded my "center bubble" and i dont think that will ever go away... i have a few of those people... ("i can count them on one partially amputated hand" - Chris Crutcher book)... 3 to be exact...   the whole time at Church yesterday, while desperately trying not to break down and cry until my body got tired of producing tears and shut off, i thought about what i learned at Steubenville South last year in Alexandria, Lousiana... they said that anything you're stuggling with, turn to God and ask Him to help you through it... i've been struggling hardcore with the prospects of next year... graduations and movings on... so i prayed almost the entire Mass and asked God to give me some kind of hint (not sign... no lightening or anything) as to whether or not this friendship was strong enough to make it through next year... today proved 2 things: this friendship is plently strong and God is amazing... absolutely astounding... i've never felt more secure and prepared for what's coming as i did today... best friends forever means best friends... forever... "But for the grace of God" - Keith Urban song...  i often say that he's my best friend in the whole world... it took me a long time to realize that means anywhere in the world, not just here at home.  it'll be tough, but i have God to guide me and i'm thankful for it.  i'd be lost without Him.  i don't remember the exact verse, but i remember the words... All things are possible through Christ...    being a teenager is difficult... there are so many uncertainties like which college, which friends, which decisions are the right ones, which classes, not to mention all the pressure from society to screw up and do something completely stereotypical of a teenager... there are some things all of us are sure about... for example:  i know that i will never do drugs or smoke... i've seen the outcome around me in a very personal manner... i know that AP Algebra is not for me because i am horrible at math... i also know that i never understood the term "i love you with all my heart" until about 2 weeks ago... when i scratched my surface and found that i truly love someone who isn't my cousin or brother or something... since this entire entry has been about one person, you can probably infer the person i am referring to  and with that, i'm finished... these have been amazingly uplifting days... i am at 100% happinness, and i hope that you are too :)    to the other person (the second of the three from my "partially amputated hand"):  thank you for your system of circles... it's helped me figure me out... it was difficult, almost painful, but i'm so much better off... thanks, buddy.  you mean a lot to me

      hello again... seems like it's been forever since i've written anything in this, but it's only been a few days. the last 2 days, i've stayed up until at least 7:30 in the morning working on the set and props for the play some friends and i put on at club sienna. we did the wizard of oz with like 25-30 of the neighborhood kids... it was so much fun. i was in charge of making the set, which took considerable amounts of time, paint, patience, time, water and soap to clean up the paint i spilled on the carpet at club sienna, time, paper towels to clean up the water and soap suds from the spill, cardboard, paint, time, paint brushes, card board, hot glue and glue gun burns, time, paint, small plastic jewels, and again, lots and lots of time. i probably spent a total of 40 hours working on the props and set and had a total of 5 hrs. of sleep in the past 2 days. it was so worth it tho to see those kids so happy and excited. they were all so cute, too. ahh good times. the parents ate it up, too :) so that was really cool... part of me wishes it was still going but the other part is like "shut up and go to sleep!"  lol the cats are being fed their little friskies wet food... they know what's comin as soon as they see the can and hear it make the spam noise... one of them, shamu, makes the funniest little meow/whine/growl noise... lol... i missed that in Germany  ok... i'm gonna go now... later :) God Bless

      howdy... let's see... today is the 21, so only 4 more days til andrew gets back :) ... i miss my buddy...  pretty slow day today... i went to the astros game last night and watch in amazement as david weathers blew a 4-1 lead... i kept asking myself, "why is he in the majors?"&nbsp; oy...&nbsp;we traded octavio dotel to one of the best teams in the game for HIM!&nbsp; even astros fans booed him!&nbsp; and what's up with jeff kent?!&nbsp; he's not preforming well!&nbsp; i agree with my brother... with the exception of bagwell, biggio, berkman, oswalt, clemens, pettitte (who is borderline), everett, lidge, ausmus, maaaaybe ensberg, and i think mike lamb, trade them all... they all need to go... geeze especially the relievers... my goodness... this was supposed to be our year because of our pitching!&nbsp; psshhh... munro did a good job in yesterday's game... i liked him.&nbsp; my goodness y'all...&nbsp; the stros are still my team tho... the stros, oakland, boston... my top 3  so how about sandy berger "accidently" placing classified national security documents in his pants and socks?&nbsp; what was that?&nbsp; in case y'all don't know who he is, sandy berger was clinton's National Security Adivsor during his second term.&nbsp; so he goes into the National Archive building up there in washingon d.c. and starts stuffing documents in his pants and then claims it was "an honest mistake"... and then he lost some of them!&nbsp; classified national security documents that he just misplaced... maybe they fell out of him pants when he was walking out of the building... ugh!&nbsp; politicians!&nbsp; i wonder if he's trying to hide something by taking those... he was around in the days where clinton and his administration passed up on getting osama... not to take sides because the bush administration lost out a few times too... but he was only in office for 8 months when the attacks happened, so he didn't miss it as many time or as blatantly as clinton.&nbsp; i dont think i would have taken the reports of impending terroristic violence seriously either... we were very naive back then about that ocean protecting us from all the crazy terrorism and wars...&nbsp; so fingerpointing is useless...&nbsp; we were all unprepared... i could never have fathomed an attack like the one on that Tuesday morning  well, that's it for now... later!

      things aren't as they should be.&nbsp; an amazing&nbsp;guy shouldnt be looked at as an inconvience by his parents.&nbsp; no one should be looked at that way.&nbsp; what allows parents to treat their kids like they arent even there and then just expect them to&nbsp;force that treatment out after 18 years?&nbsp; why should they be allowed to make him feel like he doesn't belong in his own home in his own room?&nbsp; i guess i'll just add that to the list of things to ask God when i die &nbsp; my Oma (that's Grandmother in German... we've always called her Oma) just had surgery for a bladder condition.&nbsp; it's not an unusual procedure or condition, so i think she'll be ok.&nbsp; it's really hard to think of her, this strong, sweet woman lying there in a hospital bead and for her to be depending nurses and doctors.&nbsp; people depend on her, she doesnt depend on people.&nbsp; &nbsp; i don't ever want to come back to houston ever ever ever ever again after i graduate.&nbsp; it's such an unhappy town... i'm unhappy here.&nbsp; i want to go west and live the simple life.&nbsp; oh to dream... i feel like i'm being stuffed into a sprite bottle or something, like suffocated.&nbsp; everywhere around me there are things i wish werent there and things i cant do anything about... i hate that.&nbsp; i find a problem and solve it, not let them build up.&nbsp; but these are unfixable problems that just sit and pile up. &nbsp; me and chris stayed up until about 7 this morning.&nbsp; at about 3, we went to whataburger and then we played mario bros 3 on the throwback nintendo, the gray box.&nbsp; that was fun.&nbsp; but then i overslept and totally blew my friend off... which i'm super sorry about.&nbsp; i'm so out of whack lately.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The Green Mile is a great movie.&nbsp; i loved all the religious symbolism and stuff... man that was cool &nbsp; ok i'm done.&nbsp; later

      the other night, chris, mimi, my brother, and i were sitting in the kitchen playing Phase 10.&nbsp; someone was dealt a bad card, one they didnt need, so in a completely joking way, they did that&nbsp;thing where you make your hand into a gun by making an L-shape with just your index finger and thumb and pretended to shoot themself in the head... that made me think of something and i was sad for the rest of the night.&nbsp; i couldnt play the game anymore, or at least i couldnt concentrate.&nbsp; i went in the living room and sat down&nbsp;in the really super comfy&nbsp;armchair and cried, but no one realized it.&nbsp; i think i was pissed off for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp;i still am.&nbsp; i dont want to give any of the details of what it reminded me of here because it's too public and it's a&nbsp;very personal thing but seeing that brought back some really horrible memories.  &nbsp;  speaking of horrible memories... when we were at my Grandparent's ranch 2 weekends ago for the family reunion, i remembered something pretty vividly that has haunted me for the past 4 years.&nbsp; i got all emotional and i was crying, but i was sitting by myself out on the hill because out there you can see stars for miles and miles around.&nbsp; so my brother came over after a little bit and told me what i needed to hear.&nbsp; that was good... and again, being as he is, my best friend came over and sat with me and held my hand.&nbsp; it seems like everytime something bad happens, he's right there... like when we were in Germany and at state 2 years ago and all kinds of things... what would i do... and when my mom was in the hospital last year, he gathered a bunch of German club people up and we went and visited her in the hospital...&nbsp; some people were sent by God as angels, and he's definately one of them.

"i dont wanna grow up cuz i'm a toys-r-us kid..."&nbsp; i actually never shopped there... but that's besides the point!&nbsp; and the worst part is that i feel old... like i'm a 16 year old girl trapped in an 80 year old woman's body &nbsp; alrighty then... time for me to go... talk to all you (old) guys later

      heeeey you guys... man... i've been jogging&nbsp; around the block twice, sometimes 3 times at night around 7:45.&nbsp; it took me about 12 minutes at first, but now it only takes me about 7.&nbsp; i started doing it&nbsp;to clear my mind at first and that worked, so now i do it for that reason and because it feels good to beat the arthritis and not let it control me anymore.&nbsp; for almost 5 years now i've been letting it tell me what to do and i'm sick of it.&nbsp; my knees hurt for the rest of the night but i don't worry about it because i'll be going to sleep and they don't hurt in bed... sometimes they hurt into the next day, so i take some aleve and look forward to&nbsp;jogging again that night.&nbsp; so yeah... yay for exercise!&nbsp; lol i went tonight in windpants and a t-shirt with my bathing suit underneath, came back and took off everything but the bathing suit (duh) and jumped in the pool.&nbsp; oh yeah... only took me 2 weeks to figure that out... lol... so yeah... i like jogging at night... great fun.  &nbsp;  i went to the beach today with my aunt, little cousin, brother, and sister... we had a great time.&nbsp; i got burned a bit, but it was worth it.&nbsp; my little cousin is so cute.&nbsp; he could get away with murder with his little dimples and blue eyes... cute kid  &nbsp;  it was so weird... i heard a song today that i almost wrote... it had a phrase in it that i was going to write a song about, word for word, so it was cool to see that an idea i had was like professional... i relate everything that's going on in my life to a song, and when i first started listening to that song, i thought of something - the same thing as the word for word phrase... so yeah... it was really cool... i like that song, too...&nbsp; "I Know Why the River Runs" by LeeAnn Womack... (country of course)  &nbsp;  my brother is recording his first CD tomorrow!&nbsp; i'm so excited for him!&nbsp; i can't wait til it comes out.&nbsp; i have to babysit, but it's all good... i don't mind that much... i love his music!&nbsp; sometimes, i sing along and go "hey&nbsp;i like this" and then realize it's my brother... lol...  &nbsp;  umm... yeah... that's about it... happy summer!  &nbsp;  God Bless

      ah i love baseball... i went to the homerun derby yesterday with my brother and my mom, but my mom was working... doesn't she have a sweet job?  she gets to watch the games and get paid for it... anyways... when we got there, my brother and i walked down to visit my mom before we headed up to our seats, which were up in the rafters second row to the top, so when we got down to my mom, she said to hang around for a second because the best damn sports show period was taking players off the field and interviewing them in the crawford boxes... so my brother and i grabbed a seat about 5 rows off the field and were within reaching distance of first Curt Schilling of the Boston Red Sox, then Joe Torre, manager of the New York Yankees who was walking with Jack McKeon, manager of the Florida Marlins, and then we saw Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez together.  Jeter is 3 base and A-Rod is shortstop.  After Jeter and A-Rod came Roger Clemens... if you don't know who he is... geeze... and then Lance Berkman at the end.  They came about 20 minutes apart, but Torre and McKeon went at the same time and so did Jeter and A-Rod... man it was so cool... i got pictures of them... i saw Tejada set the record for most homeruns in a derby with something over 30 and the most homeruns in one round with 15... amazing... he ended up winning, but my guy, Lance Berkman, was right behind him in second (he beat Sosa, Bonds, Thome, and a bunch of other huge names)... man that was fun.  once in a lifetime chance...  so... i might be able to be the baseball manager and be able to get my gym credit that way!  sweeeeet!  ok... thats all for now...  bis spaeter

      hey you guys... it's the Fourth of July and i just watched fireworks with my best friend... it was cool.  we watched them from the balcony thing outside my room, so we could see fireworks for like 4 different locations... :) i love fireworks...  since there were so many different kinds, we were looking at different ones the whole time.  my sister gets home from Germany tomorrow, and i can't wait to see her.  i miss he so much.  before she left, i didn't know how much i like having her around...  so yeah... and mimi is coming to stay for seven weeks also.  i have some work to do to get ready for them to come here, so i better wrap this up  can't forget this... thanks for the reminder... when we were eating dinner, i was cutting my baked potatoe up because i eat it with the potatoe skin and it was hard to cut, so it flew on the floor... i was getting up to clean my potatoe mess up when i tried to bend over but got my sleeve caught around the top of my chair.  if you've ever seen these chairs, you know what i mean.  they're tall and kind of elegant i guess... so yeah... it was hilarious and chris kept laughing at me... lol... and then i threw alluminum foil at him, so it was even...  God Bless America... thank a soldier

      something pretty big happened in Germany... i was at a party at the house my sister was staying at that about 30 people were at, including all the people from our American side of the exchange group.  it was Friday, June 18 and i was online talking to an old friend... i looked in his profile and read something that would stun me and really knock me off my feet... an old friend that i grew up with died in a car accident on June 3.  it took my breath away and when i told my sister, she kind of nodded quietly and teared up.  i signed off, not much in the mood to talk to anyone anymore, my sister grabbed me and we went on a walk without telling anyone... so we walked down the road in this little German town and down to the Church... we stopped there for a minute and talked about what happened because my sister has had a rough year dealing with losses.  she lost at least 4 friends this year, and i think she hit her max when i told her about my old friend... our families knew each other... so we were talking and each of us was pretty angry at God for taking away these young, nice people.  we were mad and we couldnt figure out the reasoning in it all.  we kind of started walking back towards the girl's house when we saw a dark shirt and khaki shorts running full speed towards us... i knew who it was immediately...  when he got within hearing distance i said "i need a hug" and he grabbed me and let me cry.  i cried and cried and cried and he just held me.  when i could support my own body weight again, he and i went over to my sister and we all sat together on the steps of an appartment or something for a little while... frau tanner came over and offered her support... we sat there until a guy opened he door and chased us off in italian... we walked a little further and stopped again... i looked at him and gave him a big hug and said thank you quietly because that was all i could manage.  he stayed with me all night and comforted me.  i don't know what i did to get such an amazing friend.  so for a little over a week, i carried a pretty hefty resentment towards God.  i was tired of losing amazing people and then turning on the news to hear of another robbery or child abuse case.  that all went away when i was at this retreat called Steubenville South last weekend.  again... amazing friends...  i was hanging out with a close friend and 2 of his buddies for most of the weekend... well on Saturday night, the speaker (i dont remember if he was a priest or just a speaker) said that if we were angry at God, we should try to make peace with Him... so i was sitting there siging the words to a song where the only words were "embrace me"  so i sat there with my eyes closed and prayed the words to the song because i was tired of feeling so low and broken and torn up.  i remembered in fourth grade singing this song where the only words i remember were "fight fair" and i asked one of my closest friends how it was fair for God to take young people and he simply responded "it's part of His plan and we won't understand until the final day."  that was what i needed to hear... so i kept praying with my eyes closed and Jesus and my friend walked up out of nothing and Jesus pushed my friend toward me and my friend gave me a hug.  i was so relieved and so at peace after that.  the mercy and glory of God is so amazing.  all you have to do is say yes to Him and everything begins to make sense again.  it's awesome.  there's something that i've been holding back from my friends for over a year now.  i've felt it in my heart that God was calling me to be in the religious ministry but my head has always disagreed.  it's scares me a lot.  the whole weekend i tried to figure out what God wanted.  i didn't want to say "ok, God.  i'll be a nun or youth minister" out of obligation.  it should be out of love and firmness... so on Sunday at the end of Mass and right before we went back to the buses for a 6 hour drive, the priest that gave the Mass asked any young people out of the 5500 of us teens that have considerded the religios minitstry to come forward, so i did among about 200 others.  he answered all my questions in a 5 minute span.  all i had to do was open my heart up to the possiblity.  so i'm sharing all this with you to let you into a side of me i've been to afraid to show; my spiritual side.  the theme this year was Rise Up: A Catholic Revolution (and no, that doesn't mean Catholics are trying to take over the world..."  it means that we're tired of seeing porn in public places like gas stations and we're tired of music where they tell little kids that it's ok to take drugs and to treat women badly.  it means that it's time for the light of God to come back to the world.  so that's my story.  anyone can go to Church.  it's not a club or frat or sorority (whatever the spelling) - it's the house of God.  don't feel like you don't belong there because of what you've done.  anyone and everyone is welcome in the eyes of the Lord.  let me know if you want to go with me to Church because i'd love to take you.  He died on the cross to forgive all sins, not just the small ones.  you just have to say yes to Him
