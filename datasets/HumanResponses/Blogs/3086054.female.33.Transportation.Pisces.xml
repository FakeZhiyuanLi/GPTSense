      I just found out that my best friend is (finally) gainfully employed, which is delightful as I was just offered a great position a week prior!  We were both laid off last April-ish & fled to Mexico to lick our wounds & learn to surf, letting the ocean absorb our fears and doubt. Neither of us had the inclination that a year later we'd still be ungainfully employed and on the verge of suicide because of it.  That's a little extreme, but the break downs & backlash from rejection were clearly apparent to everyone. A ton of other people we know are/were in the same boat especially in CA. It's daunting, really, to be underappreciated/underpaid and working toward making a success of yourself when the economy can't bear it. We kept telling each other we were just 'too good' for this time & when things improved we'd find a new dream job. It was what kept us going even tho the going was rough. You need people like that in your life, supportive friends who understand even if they can't relate - fortunately (?) we related and were having the same experience, thus we're both beginning June with the greatest outlook either of us have had in over a year. Last year was my "Jesus Year" I'm not sure if there really was supposed to be any relevance, but it was a shitty year all around so thankfully there is no catch phrase for 34...just plain living another year. That must mean that it's good enough to not need definition. Right?

      Temp job ugh - waiting to get back to actually using my brain, taking too long.... at least other people are in the same boat. Who honestly believes that the economy has bounced back? Maybe for people who don't really work, high level execs who have lots of meetings and play too much golf. This job is only bearable because everyone is way too nice, it's 'just a job' to most so they're happy paying the bills and gettin their action on after work. Since it's N. Beach the food is pretty splendid but the best part is everyone is well read, book clubbers abound and I'm turned on to something new daily. Additionally, all the other women are oversexed so we talk about that all day: erotica, threesomes, social mores, good vibrations, men..... Today is terribly quiet & I have a hangover, at least the Kings won

      Making the scene mine...  Hardly.   So yeah - I went totally gallery cruising this weekend. The CARL BERG Gallery has a nice show up ... Ed Templeton needs to start se lecting bigger spaces. HE is SO popular and can't seem to fit the masses into these wee galleries. I guess that its a great concept; If passers by see loads of people standing outside in the rain, just waiting to get inside to see the marvels of E.T. - more people will be curious and perhaps he will sell more of his dirty, dirty artwork! Isn't that the same ploy used by all those Hollywood type dance clubs? I know that there's one on the corner of Hollywood and Vine where there are always tons of girls standing outside in short, frilly mini-skirts and stilettos. They all wear the same fuckin' uniform. Just like any scene. They pay $5 to pee at the tattoo shop next door. They complain about standing in line, yet they do it anyway.   Grant Brittain has a lil' opening at the Volcom Store, on the trendy part of La Brea. More open bar action! The free bar was also out in the open and it just so happened to be raining. Yes, it rains in LA sometimes. Props go out to the umbrella'd bartenders and their services.  Of the fab black and white prints, there's a particular one of Rodney Mullen, (one of my former "bosses"), that I hold dear to my heart. Lovely. I mean it.  I saw the STEREO Skateboards show too. Jason Lee and Chris Pastas have decided to make a comeback with their former company that was the darling of the NorCal scene for many years. Having seen what has happened in the skateboard industry in the past year, I have given this concept a lot of thought. What is Jason Lee thinking? Sure, everyone loved STEREO, but will they love it again this time? Is Scientology going to affect the sales? Is skateboarding ready for L. Ron Hubbard? It's going to based in SoCAL ... under new distribution, under a "new" Jason Lee. I have much respect for Jason and Chris, but will the community understand? Will the kids want STEREO? Will they have a promo budget? ((Most skate companies do not have promo or advertising budgets anymore)). Where will the wood be made? China? can they compete with China? Or maybe now is the time to start a new (Old?) company? I don't know. The show was great ... excellent party. Jason was a great host. Chris Pastras' art makes me smile. The old ads brought back memories. EVERYONE was so there. Oh yeah - one of thier new riders is a buddy of mine. Just wait.  Free Red Stripe maketh one drunken and party take-over stylee. It was time to take me home - so I did.

      New Years and shit....  Yeah ... its almost New Years. I usually don't care about it very much, but this is the year I am ready to put behind me! YAY ... GOOD RIDDENS 2003!! Go away!!! Go FUCK YOURSELF, YEAR!  Growing pains suck. I have felt SOO damn awkward all year ... I felt like that boy in sixth grade that got the first growth spurt, (out of the entire class), and my feet were too big and I was tall and all the other children made fun of my pants for being floods ... but wait, I was five inches shorter just a day ago? I haven't had time to get that new wardrobe. I don't even know what wardrobe is! I can't seem to fit into my skin anymore.  My whole exhistance was retarded this year. The universe had me under it's scrutiny and man, I'm tired. I have to say that I did have a great summer surfing and playing outside. I did a lot of things that I loved, like posing for photos, that I probobly wouldn't have done if my 2003 wasn't so fucked! (Yeah, I needed cash to get tires for my truck, dammit!). Oh, and that trip to the Portland was priceless; river trash party and many amazing skateparks filled with cult-like figures rippin' up the tranny. Damn. Were these neato events supposed to help me "find myself"? Mid-30's crisis???  I'm still not sure who I am; besides a very, very stubborn girl that would rather be miserable then sell out to whatever society wants to dish my way.   I know that I'm not the only one who has had a tough year. There are tons of people that are worse off then me and I try to keep that in mind as I have panic attacks, freak outs, mood swings and pill benders. We are all growing, or at least trying to. Oh the process is killing me. Can't it be instant??? DAMN THE ALMIGHTY FOUNDATION! Next; make some goals? Surf more next summer? Get more out of life? I think that I want to get the STANDARD issue out of life next year. There will be no rest, but perhaps things will be a little easier emotionally.  My friends really helped me ... I love my friends. And my old man ... he has put up with a lot of my psychosis in the 2003. What a champ! I love him the mostest. Maybe this next year I won't take as many pills, drink as much wine, eat as much food and grass ... t-yeah, because I DO NOT PLAN on having much time on my hands! That's about the only goal. No more freetime for crazy think.  GOODBYE 2003.

      More crazy dreams: Paris Hilton????...  Oh man ... last night was the topper for the completely odd dreams! I think that all the hype about Paris Hilton has finally pushed me over the edge! Hey, I have to admit, the gently scripted drama of the "Simple Life" has us in front of the T.V. every Tuesday and I like it. Those girls remind me of these two crazy sisters that I knew back in High School. They were inconsiderate and rude too. Watching the show is kind of like picking at a scab ... you just can't help it. You know there's puss under there, but you must pull the thing off. You know that those girls are shitty and you watch anyway. It make you feel good about yourself. WOw, they are SO sheltered and clueless? or do they just pretend to be?   So in my dream, they came to live with my roomate Sharan and I in our lovely, late 60's ers, run-down Hollywood apartment. We made them sleep on the floor with all the cat fur and the farting dog. They were really curious about our obsession with "Charles Shaw" and artwork made by our friends. They were nice and Nicole Richie looked more like her dad. But they were stupid; a box of rocks may have more intelligence! We were buddies and it was fun teaching them how to boil water, do laundry and create. Then we went to some party in a shack up in the Hollywood Hills and everyone was really impressed with the "new" company we kept. Why we so special? Me no know.   Thats it. The end.   Oh ... "Rich Girls" is a good show too ... East Coast vs. West Coast? Blondes vs. Brunettes? Dumb vs. Smart? Non-Emoting vs. Emotions?   Is it Xmas vacation time yet?

      SOAPBOX! SOAPBOX!...  Yeah ... well, here comes another blog ... blong - bong entry that no one will ever read. Just so you know, I am VERY afraid of the Totalitarian route our USA has been taking in the past few years. The rebirth of McCarthyism really freaks me out and I have become quite the armchair activist. These are some sites worthy of checkin out if you reall care about your "freedoms":  www.alternet.org - The REAL news reports. Not CNN. Not Walmart. Not Clearchannel.  http://truthout.com  http://www.bushtax.com - huh? Taxcuts - what the fuck?  http://www.truemajority.org - Great mailing list to keep you posted  http://moveon.org - Great mailing list to keep you posted and probobly the most successful internet activist site. They have get money to run ad campaigns to tell the masses what's 'really going on' on Capitol Hill!  The internet makes it SOO easy to get yourself heard ... write to your local reps. Vent about stuff to them ... thats what they are there for. If we stay passive, the right-wing will slowly creep up and take away things that we've worked do hard to achieve as a nation/people, (such as a Women's Right to choose: www.plannedparenthood.org). Speaking of Planned Parenthood, since Bush has come into office, there's a three hour wait JUST TO PICK UP A PACK OF PILLS. No funding.  Other things that have been plaguing me lately ... LARGE GIANT CORPORATIONS buying up everything ... including media! Yikes. These folks have a lot of money invested in certain companies/people/etc. If these investments do something wrong, why ruin a good thing and REPORT on it on the hundreds of radio/TV stations that they own:  Just the Facts: What the Media Won't Tell You The media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) surveyed more than 300 major news networks' interviews during the build-up to the Iraq war. Less than 1% presented an anti-war viewpoint.  FAIR’s review of ABC, NBC, and CBS nightly newscasts in 2001 found that 92% of all US news sources interviewed were white. (worldsocialist-cwi.org)   HEALTH Insurance anyone? HA! I don't think so. Many companies don't even offer it anymore. Pharmaceutical companies have TONS of lobbiests and throw millions of dollars into politics a year ... its a big business that depends on sick people. If you are a politician, whyfix it? They just donated money your campaign. How do we fix it? FUck. I don't know. That is the one cause that makes me feel completely hopeless.  Okay. That is all for now.

      TV Commercials that can go fuck themselves...  1. Boost mobile's ghetto black santa commercial - ya know, doesn't anyone actually own a boost phone? In the US? Why is black santa so ghetto? 2. Video Game commercial: Bodies falling out of the sky into the beautiful Pacific ...well, it just makes me think that the secretary of defense had something to do with it - SECRETLY planting the WANT of WAR into peoples heads. Let's approve another 87 billion!  3. Video Game commercial - same shit. War propaganda ... the video games companies work for the US Military 4. The commercial about taking pictures with the ANNOYING Lilith Fair shit singer singing about “staying forever” … make me kill! Oh wait, am I being influenced by the video game war machines? 5. ANY OLD NAVY COMMERCIAL... don't you think that its time for a new campaign?   Fuck you. I'll never buy your stupid products.  On the other hand ...  I love the Target Commercial with that one old punk rock song that I don't know what it is. I will shop at Target. SO there.  That is all.

      The "cosmo" = DANGER DRINK!...  After a lovely Hockey Night at Carnie's; where we drank red wine and had sophisticated dicsussions of music, arts and culture - Sharan and I decided that it was time to head east to Echo Park to find my Old Man and his buddies. We went to the Short Stop and a very nice man bought us ONE Cosmopolitan. We split the drink and made new friends at the bar. Then last call came. Everything was fine. We got in my truck and drove a couple blocks away. Then we decided to stop and pee at the Old Man, Mike's, place. I got upstairs and my entire body and brain just shut down! I turned into a complete retard. So did Sharan. She ended up taking a cab home and I left my car parked in front of someone's driveway, (don't worry - it didn't get towed). Mike was completely frustrated with our behavior. I vaguely remember him trying to make me drink water and it just cascaded down my face, onto my fabulous sailor/schoolgirl striped sweater. I was "THAT GUY". DON'T BE THAT GUY.  Come to think of it ... what if that "nice man" at the bar slipped us a ROOFIE?  Didn't get him too far now, did it!?

      Driving in L.A....  Oh man ... yesterday was a doom day as far as driving was concerned. I was following a black SUV that was swerving all over the place. He was speeding up and slowing down ... I thought, " Maybe he's lost " - or on the celly? Well, the jerk let me pass by, so I was okay. I looked in my rearview and this guy was FLOSSING HIS TEETH. Flossing. Its not just for bathroom sinks anymore. THEN, I end up behind a lil' white car. This was one of those drivers that leaves two - three car spaces between them and the rest of traffic. Well, this korean woman was applying make-up the whole way down Venice blvd. She finally put away her lip liner, eye pencil, blush and concealer. I got excited a bit too soon because then she picked up her CELL PHONE!  Come to think of it ... I usually see a guy shaving in his car on the way to work too ... but he has this talent down! He must practice a lot because his driving didn't freak me out. But, damn - shave at home!   Who the hell do these shitheads think they are??????  Don't even get me started on watching TV in your car ....

      Narc-out day rules!...  Its always difficult for me to understand the amazing things that can happen in a healthy relationship. Ya know, its fuckin' hard to find someone where everything just meshes ... and once you do find it, the best thing to do is practice "Narc out Day"!  My main squeeze and I have dubbed our days of piling out, "Narc out Day". We dabble in the "Devil's Lettuce", red wine, (among other things), and watch football. Its really fun! Sometimes, our clothes fall off, "Whoops! My pants just fell off" ... and on occasion, there are excursions away from the couch to the "rain forest", (my new wonderful shower!!!!!!!!). When snacktime arrives, I'll have to go to the kitchen, so I put on my stipper heals for fun. The walks to the food can be treacherous! The danger of random cats and big dog on the floor are eminent. Its always good to have your friend watch over the mission.  We did leave the house because we were very hungry after a day of gymnastics, wrestling and football. Baskin Robbins saved the day and gave us energy to stay up for the Simpsons.   Ahh ... I didn't even mind getting up this morning. Next time you have nothing to do on Sunday, do nothing with a makeout friend: HAVE NARC OUT DAY!

      i got drunk!...  No really ... I got really wasted in SF! I forgot how much I love that city ... New Years was celebrated, by me, in the boys bathroom at the Hemlock. I was on the toilet and my friend's boyfriend was on the urinal. We peed and wished each other happy new year! Yay ...but I wasn't drunk.  Then, the next day, our beerleader, Tim, gently guided us out of the house back to the Tenderloin. I love the Tenderloin! Hookers, trannies, Drugs, gross things, fights in the streets; PURE ACTION! So yeah, we went to HARA's. This is the best "old man bar" i have ever been to. we met some amazing old timers like Heinz, (ex Navy guy that repairs SF train tracks), and Cleveland John, (who's from Cleveland and has a country CD in the jukebox). There were others, but they came later, when i was DRUNK!  I think that I did more shots of Jagermeister, along with my irish coffees and beer, then I have in years together. I forgot what its like to swagger and not be able to focus on anything. I lost my two friends and ended up with another at a NICE italian restaurant around the corner. I thought that "eating would be a great idea". I was too drunk to eat and puked in the bathroom at this fancy place. I kept trying to apologize, but I was having trouble forming words and seeing. WAit ... I kept the puke part a secret.  Later that night, (like around 930??? I don't know), I ended up at a family house, drunk, speaking German to a toddler for hours.  HAPPY NEW YEARRRRRRRRRRRRR! Thanks SF!

      New Transworld Video makes me giddy....  "Are you alright?" is an appropriate title for Transworld's latest, (well, maybe not latest? I don't know when it came out. I'm outa the loop. I just saw it, so it's the "latest" to me dammit!), video. I think that it contains one of the gnarliest slams I have ever seen. I almost cried. Oh, to emote! Oh! - to feel the passion! John Holland has always had a knack for making passionate films, but I think that this time he has out-done himself by letting Aaron Harrison and Ped Urtz participate in the fun! Yeah, sure - they are my friends and shit, but that's not the only reason I could relate to the video!  Ped and Aaron take a twenty-three day journey around the Northwest with a rotating cast of gnarlers including Pat Duffy, Burnside Favorite "Danger", Ryan Wilburn and Danny Way. They skate a shitload of parks and pull off some amazing stuff! I really like the transition skating because there's so much style involved - and these guys definately have style. It's actually gripping! Yeah, there's a little bit of street stuff in there too. This video will make everyone happy - these guys are "all terraine vehicles".  Other highlights ... the session at Klamath, (yeah, I've been there, what? I got drunk and had the gnarliest sunburn from sitting in 100 degree weather watchin' my old man & his buddy Mick shred!), Hairball's dance moves, Danny Way's knee and "Danger's" true spirit in skateboarding. And, can I say that I think that Pat Duffy has been "practicing" a lot? Hmm, soberiety?  I have escaped the business of skateboarding ... and now I'm "friends" with it again. It's good to see that a media giant can allow me to renew my faith, (or maybe refresh my memory????), in the culture. I'm stoked to see that they have gotten away from the same old boring format of: "HEEEEERES BLAH BLAH ...and their part". Repeat. Maybe the kids will see that there's more to skateboarding then going to a set of stairs and breaking yourself off for six hours to get one photo ... just to go sit in two hours of traffic before getting to the next "spot" - only to get kicked out.  Just get the DVD. Watch it. See for yourself. THe soundtrack alone will make you happy.  Aaron & Ped ... I love you fuckers.

      Euros R Us - Ode to our new Swedish friends: Hannah & Melinda from GOTEBORG...  A few weeks back, my roomate Sharan & I went to see the Biblical Proof of UFOs. They are a rock-n-roll band that is from Cleveland and they've been out in LA for a few years. It was their record release party, and judging from the crowd, they have quite a following these days! AND, the fuckin' rocked! My neck was sore for two days due to rockin'out. What do they sound like? Let's say a cross between Weezer and the Melvins. And it works.  They finished playing and I was talking to some random guy. He was checkin' out these rocker chicks that were sitting in front of us. Little man was intimidated because they spoke, " some other language ". I was like, " Aw man, they have to be either Swedish or Italian". Since I was drinking beer, I was feeling very friendly and walked up to the girls, " HI! Are you from Sweden "? As it turns out, yes. AND, one of them is half Sicilian.  We started talking about places to hang out in Los Angeles and the next thing ya know - the bar was closed! Sharan and I asked how they were getting back to the hostel. " We are taking a bus, or some-ting ". Nope. There are no buses at 2am ... so we gave them a ride back to Hollywood Blvd. Did I mention that we totally cock-blocked the guy who was checking them out? Haaa HAA.  Hannah and Melinda, "The Swedish Meatballs", are some of the coolest women I have met in a long time. They live in Warehouses and have rock shows in the their living room. I guess that they have a zine too, but they didn't think to bring any because they are written in Swedish. They are here in the Americas until the end of March. They are spending a portion of the time traveling in Mexico. I wish I was going with them! They stayed with us for about a week and we talked about fat Americans, how well they speak English, metal and cultural differences. They were a breath of fresh air to my, (as of late), stale LA life. If you can't travel to other lands, let the people of the lands come to you!    Side Note** They met another Swede on Hollywood Blvd. He's a tattoo artist. He has long hair, (complete with receding hairline), and a style that sits well around 1987. He's very nice guy that has played in many bands, (including, I think, a Motorhead cover band??). The best part about this dude is that he drives a 1987 CAMARO with T - TOPS! Unreal. The glass on the right side is broken, so he has it taped up with red tape. I don't think that I have set foot anywhere NEAR a car like that since MAYBE - 1988?? The Swedes have an insatiable love for the weird and cheesy America rock culture. And they don't skimp on the details!

      I went to see THE SHINS!!!!! (LA INDIE crowd still doesn't dance or look the least bit enthused)....  I finally got to see the SHINS ... and it was so much fun! Much to the dismay of the LA Indie Rock crowd, we pogo'd the whole time. Mercer & his vocals lurked in the corner, while the wide-eyed, (hmm, how fast was this boy going we wondered???), keyboard player presented "front man" antics. There was a lot of instrumental musical chairs going on ... never a dull moment! The BASS player, (I think? I was kind of drunk. I kept losing track of where the instruments where going), was wearing a 400 BLOWS t-shirt. I think that he's the rocker in the band. I know that he liked to pogo. Why doesn't the LA INDIE ROCK CROWD believe in the fine ART OF DANCE?? There were a rowdy bunch of blokes behind us yelling, "What the hell is wrong with you people? There isn't glue stuck to the FLOOR!!!!!". Those guys had the right idea. The wimpy crowd was very scared of these comments. I think that I heard someone crying. Great beats to move your feets, duh! If you want to stand around, go back outside onto Hollywood Blvd ... or better yet, STAY HOME and SIT on your COUCH. Oh yeah, there were some people sitting on the front row floor? Was that some sort of protest? Didn't stop us from dancing around the "sitters".  The HENRY FONDA THEATER is my favorite venue in LA at the moment. Yeah sure, I can walk there from my house ... that helps - but I must say, the staff is pleasant and rad. Even the security guard that kicked us out of a balcony seat was apologetic for flashing a bright light into our eyes, (rendering us BLIND). No attitude. Great door people. Nice bartenders. HEY EL REY - you could learn soemthing from the HENRY FONDA!  Thank you "The Guy from SUB POP" for hookin' us up with tix.

      Raji's -Best Bukowski dive bar in Hollywood has been canceled and taken over by people that use a lot of hair product...  First it was the SKI ROOM. That was before I moved to LA. I remember hearing the stories about the ski room before I moved here. My friends Johnny and Paula lived here about 8 years before I moved to Hollywood. Their stories drifted back to Kent, Canton and Cleveland. I got here, and they were all walking back from Raji’s. “It used to be called the SKI ROOM …. The Bukowski Bar … yeah! Everyone got excited; “you know that’s where they filmed the fight scene … from BARFLY!”. Yeah, in the alley, Right behind John & Paula’s.   It was a scary alley where there were dudes getting/.giving blowjobs. Crazy trans-sexual- homoerotic-cracksmoking-herion shooting ALLEY. I remember seeing one of the people that I didn’t know trapped in that alley. Someone told them ,”get out of the ALLEEEY”. And we let them into the backyard. IT was gnarly going to RAJI’s. But, we went all the time anyway …   The cast at RAJI’s included Mari, (best shot drinker with clients in town), Vern: Loves all your, “where do you find all these cute boys!!????”, Wobbling German and his tranny girlsfriend, Mary the Junky that was, “Mick Jagger’s clothing designer”, Jack …ah, Jack, “Don’t take advantage of me because I’m Mexican” … I must reiterate VERN. He came to our apartment for Thanksgiving. He loves champagne. There are so many more … all the folks from the St. Mortiz Hotel: Shot/killed/blahblah, justgotout, drunktankfor5years, etc. Tere was one guy with white socks pulled up to his knees and a teardrop tattoo. He lived on my roof for a while.   While Mari was working there, we got to know Vern, He represents the RAJI’s crowd. He is a kind and loving alcoholic that found the same comfort in his corner barstool as he would on his own loveseat. He held the place down. Oh wow, another great RAJI’s story … Our friend Jason got locked in one night. He may have fell asleep in the mensroom … no one knows for sure. He got locked in. The AIR was left on full blast and Jason had to sleep in the bar. He drank as much alcohol as he could to keep himself warm and eventually retired to the pool table. Oh, how many game we have played on that lop-sided table????? Half asleep?? Breakfast pool? Nothing else to do pool??   Yep, that was RAJi’s. And then one day it was closed. That was about a month ago. Jack told us that they were remodeling it. So they were. Finally, it opened and it was always closed and full of “private party”. Mike skated by and saw that they put in a, “booth”, or something. Oh, it’s so much worse.   Tonight, we went to Raji’s. Tom and Saskia would bother going in. Mike was repelled almost instantly; as if there was OFF! In the atmosphere. The door guy was wearing a striped sweater. It fit well and he talked like an east coast frat boy. “It’s the BEST BAAAR in LA now!!! Come on innnnn!!”.   Yeah.   Sharan and I needed to go in to see it for ourselves. We walked in and were speechless. I nearly wept. Bleached blonde bartenders in ponytails. They were wearing black pinstriped pants, white wife-beaters and suspenders. Could one of them been named, “Leni”? Scary. But I didn’t blame them. They were just doing their job. The girls served up a nice strong drink … for $7.00. Up nearly $3.00 from the last time I visited the place.  “everything needs to change” said the blonde sitting at the bar.   Indeed it does. I want to react. I want to take over that bar … AGAIN! But do they deserve our alcohol savoring appetites??? The revenue? The local attitude? I’m not sure. This whole event has left me speechless all the sudden. The bathroom … the walls held our poetry. Now it’s gone. Along with the roaches, vomit aroma and the sticky floors. And our friends.

      My hood, Hollywood...  I have been thinking about abanding my home of five plus years. I have been hating the city more lately and I'm becoming intolertant of publicists, egos, movie makers, trailers, traffic, smog, movie stars, movie star wannabes, non-working-waitor-actors, commuting, junkies sleeping in my garage, music industry dorks, the anythingwestoflabrea, etc, etc.  Tonight, I went out in my hood for the first time in a while. Being broke prevents me from doing these things and part of living in a big city is enjoying the "city life". Sure, I can go walk around Hollywood window shopping and watching the kooks, but it's not truly a great as going to get some dinner and drinks. Birthday funds have allowed me to relive the days of the "living wage". Tonight, I went out to dinner at Kung Pao Kitty. It's a new chinese place on HOllywood and Ivar. And it was tastey!  My roomate and I joined the "Swedes" for some BYOB Coors and fantastic gourmet Chinese. It's a addition to the neighborhood and we always like to see these things. There's something about sitting in a restaurant and chatting over new flavors that inspires me! I love it. We finished our 12 Pack as the restaurant owner and staff watched our every move; not in a bad way, but just trying to pinpoint what we are into! Afterall, we DO live in the hood! we reqested "more hotsauce and starters" for next time and took our stuffed bellies to the Burgundy Room.  To me, The 'B-Room' is the best bar in town. No matter what, I just like it there. the music is always choice. Steph, Loomis, Torrence and Ian always take good care of locals ... and it's nice and dark in there. It's always the same.  Tonight, Torrence told us about his new CD that he's been working on; "Torrence the Band". He sang everthing. It's like a "one man" George Forman or Ramones. I saw one other local ... he hasn't been to the bar in months, (wintertime makes people cocoon- whether you are in LA, or the Great White North). It was nice to see a familiar face! He wanted to buy me drinks... or date me. I don't know. We were oggled and hooted at by all the "newcomers". (These are the folks that come from the west side because they red that the Cahuenga area is the new best "walking party street area" in LA). The crackheads, Trannies, Rockers, Stilletto Wearing beauty-bar clientelle are all still there.   Earl Parker was there. He was, "worried about (his) knees. California's insurance doesn't cover MRI's, so I haven't had one in a year. I can't believe that I have been living in Hollywood for a year. I have been writing movie ideas. And my roomate freakd out and moved out ..." - or he said something something like that.  ... I guess that Kosick was supposed to be making the scene ... along with McKee: all veretans of the new "cool" in my hood. Maye Jeff would show up. I don't know. I had to get home because I hate my job and resent the fact that it doesn't allow for my weekly jaunts around Hollywood ... east of Highland!  I still love my neighborhood. Many have to drive to all these places, where as I just walk down Hollywood. I don't pay for parking ... my price is getting propositioned by outsiders while I walk with my hood over on my head and leftovers. It's a fair price most of the time. It's annoying - so I can easily take the "way" home ... Selma to Carlton Way. I know the shortcut through my gym, Ballys. Once I cross Gower ... I'm home free. I know the street and I'm not afraid.  Voodoo Tatoo is bright and cheerful. Kung Pao Kitty will be visited again. Star Shoes and it's silly crowd will be mocked ... and hopefully, I can achieve greatness in my work-job that will allow me to go out and ENJOY my hood - the place, (that I realized tonight), that i MISS.

      I just got back into town from Cleveland. My old man Mike and I went to visit my parents and brother. We have returned to LA covered in bruises. We got into a RUMBLE. Bar fight. Mêlée: in the name of passionate and firey personalities that think rather "highly" of each other!  I was sitting at the bar trying to order a round of PBR for us. I ran into my friend Brian. He’s a great guy and I hadn’t seen him in a while. He owns a skate shop. We talked about skateboarding and some other stuff. It’s vague. I had already been to a couple bars … one is called, “Pat’s in the Flats”. Fast Mattress and the Drips were playing. They both rocked. Midwestern bands make me want to DRINK. So, I was a happy drunk – chatting to Brian when I heard a scuffle. I turned around to see Mike’s beanie getting shoved towards the front of the bar. “what the fuck”, I mumbled as a grabbed my purse to get see what was happening.  I get closer and all I could see were two dudes trying to beat the shit out of my old man. One was wearing a black trench coat and the other had some sort of greaser “bride of Frankenstein’ hair style. I don’t know. It’s Cleveland fashion. Trench coat guy is wrestling Mike to the ground. Frankenstein might be trying to break it up. What’s a girlfriend to do????? FUCK YEAH, JUMP RIGHT IN!!! I start to peel Trench Coat away from Mike and in a calm voice I’m saying, “stop it. Okay, stop it”. He wouldn’t listen. Then I went into auto-pilot. I stuck my fingers in his eye socket. “C’mon man, cut it out” I told him. He was being a dick and I think I started kicking him.  Bride of Frankenstein hair was also in all of this. I saw a pained look on his face. I think that Mike was trying to use some of his grappling moves on him. There was shattered glass everywhere. Somehow we all went through the door. Someone and I finally got Mike away from Trench Coat and we were almost safe. “you can’t hit a girl!” he screamed as he took his shirt off and ran after Frankenstein.  I was just sitting on the ground wondering what the hell I’m gonna do with my six-foot-one-180-lb boyfriend after he plowed over me to attack some guy that didn’t do anything to me. I was staring at my feet. Mind you, I was wearing heels through all of this …  The battle had moved into the crosswalk. Frankenstein clocked Mike and knocked him on his head. Out cold. Concussed. Foaming at the mouth. That was pretty scary. By this point, my brother and all my old Cleveland buddies were outside. There was a tall guy in a plaid shirt telling me that Mike was, “gonna be okay”. As long as he was breathing, everything was cool. My friends were asking me, “did someone try to hit you???”. I had no idea what the hell they were talking about. I just wanted an ambulance. I was scared. Boyfriend foaming at the mouth is not cool. “get an ambulance over here already”.  The fire truck showed up and by that time Mike was mumbling something about going home and that “we are right down the street from Echo Park. Let’s go home”. Instead of home, we went to the ER. Head injuries need to be checked. We went to Lutheran Hospital by the Westside Market. There was a cackling lady making fun of Mike. Mike thought he was in LA.  By this point, My brother and I were laughing our asses off. One of the medics went to our high school. Imagine this: We were in and out of the ER in two hours.   I’m back in LA. I have a bruise on my cheek, my elbow, my left ass cheek, the back of my thigh, my knee, my calf, my knee and a knuckle print on my shoulderblade. Mike, well, his collarbone is fucked up and he feels, “bubbles floating” in his brain. Yeah, we’re pretty tough. He thought that someone was trying to beat me up. But it was a figment of is beer-drinkin’ imagination. He was protecting me, as I was he. Hell yeah! When Mike & Rita come to town – it’s all over. Like every fight … it was a stupid misunderstanding. One thing I do understand is that it was my second fight ever. And just like the first one, it was verses DUDES and I was defending a man in my life. In my first fight, I was in a “rumble” with my brother. Guess that says a lot for my current relationship. Mike is my family.   Wanna fight?

      I found my first gray hair today. It was in my eyebrow. I thought that it was cat hair at first because my enitre exhistance is swimming in it. But no. It was a little, almost clear, white hair. I Plucked it out and looked at it closely. My eyes crossed as I inspected what was to be, "the beginning of the end".   Yeah, right. I'm not going to join in the obsession of looking young forever. Joan Rivers creaps me out. Joan looks like Michael Jackson! I don't want to stay looking, "young" if it's going to be like that. It' just a freakin grey hair, right? I probobly hair them on my head too ... but I dye my hair, so I can't tell. AND I KNOW that it's not really aging ... it's the fact that I'm always stressed out about my job. I supposed that stress can send one to an early grave. Gray hairs, bleeding gums and a disapearing stomache lining are all a result of where I spend my 40-some-odd hours a week. Ya wanna see? Here are some of my latest stress makers, (which I have to sell to Alberstons, Walmart and other gnarly mass retailers that REALLY do not mesh with my constitution):        I want to kill my boss died.

                                    SENDING OUT RESUMES: not fun anymore   Really, realllly sick of it. I used to find it entertaining to send out 5 to 10 resumes a day! The more the better. Not anymore. I don't care about any of the job postings ... and there haven't been any good ones: careebuilder, monster, vault, hotjobs, showbizjobs, 4entertainmentcareers, entertainmentcareers, flipdog, boardsportsjobs, craigslist, malakye, talentzoo, creative circle, apple one, thejobshop ....   dizzying, isn't it?  I thought that I could function in the "real world", but I don't want to anymore. I want to work in skate/surf/snow. That's where I belong. Those are my people.  I can't relate to the people wearing the suits. I can't relate to not drinking beer with my co-workers. It's seriously killing me. BUT NOW, what do I do all day long if I'm not sending out resumes? I can't put up anymore postings on friendster and myspace because you will all end up hating me. Then I will be alone and have to re-up my prozac prescription. Oh wait. I don't have health insurance.

      "If I were to fuck with someone, it wouldn't be me" ... Things Chicks Do Sometimes.  Tonight, my roomate and I went on an excursion that many women and girls go on. We went to see the band that my roomate's boyfriend left her for. Got that? She was dumped for the singer of a band from the Pacific Northwest.  Our friend Jill and my boyfriend Mike - both asked the same thing: "Are you guys going to cause drama"? No. We just wanted to see. It's a mere couriosity that most people have. You HAVE to be curious about your current/ex/boy/girl friend's ex/future. I find it to be human nature. No drama. Just wanted to see her. So we did.  We got to the venue and opened out fine European beers. The venue is in downtown LA and is wedged between "skid row" and the future, "gallery district". It's owned by vegans. They have great shows there. The door guy will ask you for food. It's one of the best places in Los Angeles to see a new & fesh rock show. People won't dance, but they will pay attention. They are there to discover and see new music.  We see a tall, blonde and slendor girl. She has the same haircut as my roomate's ex ... let's call him, "Snob". She's wearing his tapered, mod style suite. It just had to be her ... when he first met the alleged girl - that's when he cut his hair just like her's! The girl was hangin' out by the merch table. It HAD to be her! Then she climbed on the stage - IT WAS  HER! Until ... "Hello, we are called -----". Not them.  Shit.  The stress started all over again. My roomate's face turned red and my left arm went numb. Sharan got anxious. I knew that my arm hurt from working out yesterday. Which girl was it then???  So, we walk to the loo and squat over the scariest toilet. I rolled my pants up to wade back  out. Outside, people are peddling their wares at the merch table. We walk by and my roomate says, "they were giving us hard stares!!! I swear she looked at us". We giggled and walked outside, "do you think it's the girl that was, CRYING?????", I asked.  That's when we were told, (by the door man), about the funeral he went to on Easter. It was his ... "friend of 30 YEeears. I didn't eat anything alllll daaay on Easter. So, errr - I didn't eat! It's nice to see you gurls again"! Again? Huh? What is this guy talking about?   So, yeah - the next band was setting up. There were TWO girls on stage. The story goes that the girl that Snob left for: moved to a big city, got into some trouble, joined a band, married one of the guys in the band, had more trouble, split up, he got re-married and now they all live together. And play in a band. So, which girl was it?  I had an idea! I was to look on the back of one of their cds and figure it out. I went to the merch table. I looked. I found the  picture. I thought that we had made a dire mistake. Again.  Part 2:  The picture on the cd showed a cute girl as the singer ... I thought maybe it wasn't her. Maybe it was the little pixie-lookin' keyboard player? I went back and told Sharan that I didn't think it was the "crying girl" - but that she should look. I think that my judgement was getting a little silly after the beers, etc. Sharan returned. "it's her".  It was the tall, out of shape, trashy and depressed girl. I couldn't believe it! We were giving Snob the benefit of the doubt with the first girl. THis second one ... so mopey and homely. This was the girl that Snob LEFT my roomate for. This was the one that he tortured her with. This sad girl. We couldn't stop laughing. I feel a little bad for it now, but dammit. Snob had these sky-high "standards" that he tried to portray to Sharan ... and he would school her on them. He was fucked.  So, the band got on stage and the sad girl got angry. She played bass ... aggressively. Their Joy Division-esque rock-n-rolll, (that at one point I really did like), seemed very real and depressing. We giggled more and decided that we'd seen enough. No drama. Just pure satisfaction.  We walked outside and the weird door guy insisted on walking us to the end of the alley. Afterall, it is skid row. He didn't really need to ... we had nothing for them to take from us. Especially Sharan. She had left all her baggage back at the show ...

      Why Wal Mart makes me angry - a nice little story  Inglewood, California voted against Wal Mart. That's right - about 11,624 Inglewood residents voted on April 6, 2004 whether to let the retail giant plant it's seed unto thier community; or not. Of that number, 7,049 folks voted against it.   For those who don't know what Inglewood is: It's a community of about  112, 000 people near LAX. Inglewood was catapulted into the public eye via various rappers such as Mack 10 and Westside Connection, not to mention all the "bloods & crips" stuff that was going down there for a while. It's mellowed a lot since those days. It'a a nice community with a mixed culture and an average household income of about 46K a year; it seemed to be well suited for a Wal Mart store. Los Angeles' first.                     The expansion encountered fierce opposition from                     organized labor, which insisted that Wal-Mart's                     aggressive business practices and anti-union employment                     policies would result in lost jobs and depressed wages for                     millions of workers. - Los Angeles Times, April 7, 2004   Wal Mart tries to put a spin on their bad business practices by bombarding the people with PR about, "Giving back to the community" and such. Much to my dismay, I even hear it on NPR these days. But the people from Inglewood wouldn't stand for it. Now I hear rumors that Wal Mart plans on trying to open in a neighboring community in order to mess with Inglewood by causing traffic congestion, loss of tax breaks, etc. Hmmm ... we'll see.  So that's the biggest story on the MONSTER ... but I have something that touches home. This story was told to me by someone that I KNOW ... who's buddies started a waffle business. I didn't get the details of the waffles, but I am guessing that it was an instant batter type deal. And business was going great!  They were selling waffle mix to a variety of shops. They started out "grass roots" and eventually sold to larger chains. They were approached by Wal Mart to sell their product in a small portion of the marketing ... as kind of a "test". The waffle company was ecstatic!! They could finally gain a little financial freedom and really make their dreams come true. Wal Mart took in a very nice quantity of the waffle mix and the stuff, according to Wal Mart, was flying off the shelves. They called the little business a few months later and requested a meeting at the Wal Mart HQ in Arkansas. The waffle company footed the bill for the flights and met with the retail giant's buying department. They were set.  Upon their arrival in Arkansas, they were told that Wal Mart was interested in buying a HUGE quantity of waffle mix! It was doing great and they wanted to start shelving it at all locations. They started going through all the contracts and filling them out with fervour. The little waffle business that was started from their home was finally going to pay off!  After everything was finished, there was ONE more contract to sign. The buyer was very nonchalant about this, "last little detail" ... "it's just a small portion" of the final sale. It didn't seem like a big deal. It was just a form that allowed an extension on returns. And if they returned unsold item within 30 days, it held a "guarenteed sale" type of note. No biggie. Standard procedure. And besides, the Wal Mart buyers had just told them that they couldn't keep the waffle mix in stock! So they signed and hopped on an airplane to head home. Life was great!! Celebrating was next!  THE NEXT DAY: The little waffle company got a call from Wal Mart requesting to return nearly ALL the cases of waffle mix that had initially been shipped for the TEST SALE. They were contractually BOUND to accept the return and refund Wal Mart the entire payment that they had made for the product.  Apparently what had happened was that Wal Mart had forgotten about the waffle mix and had never even put it out to sell. The product expired and now the waffle company is out of business. True story.  How many others are there like this one? How many people have lost welling paying jobs with benefits (because Wal Mart moved into their town)? How many cities have been trampled?  Peter Kanelos, a Wal-Mart spokesman in California, said:   "The reality is that this is not some huge grass-roots uprising," he said. "Most communities in the state do not believe that government should be restricting the shopping choices of their residents."  Wal Mart was banned from Inglewood. Small grass-roots organization played a pretty big part in it. Screw Wal Mart. Tell your friends.   If you'd like to learn more about the "wonders" of Wal Mart, check out the LA TIMES article:  The Wal-Mart Effect         PART I: An Empire Built on Bargains (11/23/03)  PART II: An Obsession With Costs (11/24/03)  PART III: Unions Battle to Stop Invasion (11/25/03)

      Relationships are weird like that ...  I want to get married. Eventually. Some day ... well, it's not actually not a priority. It's such weird thing.Weddings. They are always the same. There's always that drunken relative. drunk-uncle ("druncle"), proud father, the chicken dance. Food. Booze. "it's my day". "it costs only 25 thousand dollars!" ... dresses and gaining a losing weight, "whoa, I can't believe that wedding went OVER by 5,6,7,8,9,10K!", bouquet bruiserz: "I've been to four weddings since four months ago and this is the 4th one I've caught! My boyfriend is getting scared".   If you're gonna get married, there should be nothing scary or stressful about it. Just like a relationship. Honestly, if shit gets too crazy; I'm out. However, I am into the psuedo drama - like grandma & grandpa bickering. I think that make relationships fun! Especially if you have a lot in common- and you like to debate. You like to preach to the choir and laugh at the techniques used my your mate because they are the same as your own. That's love.  Marriage doesn't freak me out. It's divorce that does. And the fact that I believe that people will have, (and should have), many "love of my live's". I have had mine and I think that I have found, "the one" and it's everything everyone said it would be: I just know. Ya need proof? Well, Look at what you're reading. Stuff about relationships. Crappy romance novel stuff. That's not what I write about.What I have seen in my 1.5 years with my old man makes me want to tell everyone what it's all about. Just like everyone else does. And I knew it 4.0 years ago ... when I remember meeting him for the first time.   So, divorce is a shitty thing. My parents have not divorced. Neither have my old man's. I don't ever want to. But when I REALLY think about weddings - it comes down to cash. Yep - "god money". For ONE night, people spend insane amount of money. twenty five to over a hundred thousand. Or even more. I can't fathom the larger amounts. Fuck that. I would take whatever amount spent and go on vacation ... a quick wedding in big sur -No one will know! and then a nice lil' trip to Fiji ... or New Zealand. I'd spend the rest on real estate. Not only are you investing in each other, but you are investing in the RAD. Building a place that becomes the, "happy place" for both of you. Incorporation of ideas to make the peace piece. The ultimate art.  That's what I would do for my marriage. INVEST and CREATE in the name of love. Well, some people have trust funds, inheritance, rich family and can afford to pay for a wedding. I still think it's a huge waste of cash. It's not logical or practical. But I guess that marriage isn't supposed to be because you are, "in LOVE" and nothing else, "matters". I wrestle with these romantic ideas all the time and I can't justify it.  There will be less stress involved in the place and life you create together. When it all just "meshes" - it just works. Let the audience see your travels by way of digital imaging. Let your audience feel the intensity of you relationship outside the bounds of church and state. Let them see and undergo the way you emote to each other via the estate you have built together. Let them notice maturity verses undeveloped personalities, (trying the grow into each other instead of WITH each other).  You won't need to seat the audience on, " the bride's side" or the groom's. It doesn't matter where they sit. It's not going to be an ordinary marriage. There's not going to be a "big DAY". It's going to be a big and extraordinary life ... and that's what i picture for myself. My friend Pat said to me yesterday, (reguarding him & his wife's awesome marriage), "we got married after we were thirty". I believe in their relationship.  They have been through thick and thin. They haven't followed the rules. They are going to make it. Just like my old man & I.  It's 2230. I am waiting for adult swim to be on tv. Shake makes me think of Mike. I don't think he's on tonight.

      I wonder if my choice in music is any reflection upon what kind of summer it will be? KARP, BIG BUSINESS, PARTYTIME ... and more stuff that makes me want to smash things.  I'm angry at the parking Nazis on my street. They "save" parking spots for each other on my street. I am ready to start bombarding them with lil' notes: "Monopolization if parking spaces is not nice", "I park like the dumb guy", "I don't know how to drive, therefore I can't park right", etc, etc.  Then there's "Shadow" and "Lil' Boy". These shitbags think that they live in my garage and leave up stupid tags about, "Shadow + Lil' Boy TLA", whatever. Their tags will be crossed out with my almighty words: "Shadow is a dork" and "Lil' Boy gets his name because he has a lil' penis" ... "People that squat occupied buildings have no originality" and then there's just plain, "NO". I just write "NO" over their tags. Mike asked me why I am, "stuping to their level"? Well. Because. I don't think that they'll understand any other way. I'm just communicating.  The Tight Bros from Way BAck When. Yeah. Rock out.

      Yup. This is another bad week in my bi-polar career. I hate my job more then ever. Yesterday, after being yelled at to, "think outside the box!!!", by my short man boss - I walked outside and wanted to just keep on going. It took every ounce of my energy to come back to my desk and continue sending out packages to wal mart, albertsons and many other places that I have moral issues with.  I have never had a job that I hated so much. It's difficult to know that there are people that go through life not LOVING what they do! Everyday, I fantasize about writing my letter of resignation, walking out the door forever and never having to see these people again. Selling out and knocking off ideas is not a good business. That's what the company I work for does. I am a slave. I don't make very much money ... and what little I make, I need to pay rent, etc. I don't have health insurance, (STILL), and there's nothing that motivates me to do anything here: not one perk. I wonder how long this guy will be in business for?   I find solace in emailing out resumes while I am at work. I average about five a day ... sometimes more. I think that my record is 25 in one day, (out of which I got two interviews and still no new job). It's pretty shitty out there these days. What if I get stuck doing something I despise for the rest of my life? Would it make me feel better if I made at least enough money to go buy some clothes and go out to a bar and have cocktails; without feeling guilty about it? Or if I could go to the doctor? Stop ordering my perscriptions from Mexico, (one month ahead of time)? What if I got really sick? And I couldn't pay my medical bills? Would my wages that I barely get by on be garnished?  I'm not the only one that's going through this. I know many people that have had their killer, "dream jobs" and are also going through this humbling experience. We are all losing it. We are all emotional timebombs. Are we being punished for loving our lives and careers before? When did the job/career become so important?  Since I work at a company that provides no culture and is against everything I stand for. I am a slave - Just to pay my bills. I am "lucky' to have a job in these times of a bad economy. I sell my soul to live. My gums bleed from stress. I have anxiety and stomache problems. Dumb luck, maybe?    Here's something that keeps me in check:  http://stopthewall.org/

      Greetings! This my first Blog ever!! I always thought that it was kind of silly, but now I'm into it. Go figure. I am always stubborn about shit when it first happens. Especially when everyone thinks it's, "So cool". I immediately reject it. Oh well. My rejection has yet again been foiled by reading people's creative, (and not so creative), writing. The same thing has happend with numerous bands. I can't think of any of them right now. It's too damn early.  So, yeah - I live in Hollywood. I didn't come here to be an "ACTORRR", or director, dictator, or rock star. I just came here because it's an exciting place to be. Plus, I needed to get the hell out of Cleveland; FAST. There's a whole little Ohio community that I joined that put me on a little street between Sunset and Hollywood boulevards. Yep, I live under the almighty "Hollywood Sign". Not fancy, pretty ghetto actually, but it's HOME.  Anyway, I am posting some other stuff that I wrote from another journal I keep on www.myspace.com. Yeah, I'm a myspace/friendster junky. That stuff keeps me busy while I am at my POINTLESS workplace. Read it. Or don't.

        A Panty Story    Most of the time, I don't wear panties. Low slung hip-huggers (seriously) do not beckon the thong! It's very, "Orange County" to me ... seeing that string peek out of a girls' butt crack when she leans over. I think that buttcrack, sans the panty, is way more attractive: And Comfy!   Sometimes, however, I do wear boyshorts or thongs. If I wear them for a couple days and then return to the natural panty-less form - but I forget that there's nothing there. Today I caught some pubic hair in my zipper by accident. Don't worry ... it's cool. I'm tough.

       Friendster, ex-wives and my friends vs. those other people (A long story, dammit)    ...my honesty here may get me into trouble   So yeah. My boyfriend is married. Still. We've been dating for about 1.5 years and we've been friends for ... um, I don't know. Three or four years? When I met him; he was "with" his wife Suzanne. I mean, I have never seen them together ... but they were living together and married.   When I first saw Mike at Heather's house. I was in love. Fully attracted.   I asked Heather, "Who's that sad guy that hates me so much"?  "Oh, that's my assistant Mike. He's married".  That was fine and dandy. I respected it. I mean, I was still attracted to him, but OKAY - he's married. But DAMMIT - he's hot! And as Heather and I proceeded to become better friends, I kept telling her:  "Yeah, he's married. But there's something about him. Either way. It's there". She was grossed out by it. Not by the fact that he was married - but because it was, "Kassak" and he was like the "dorky little brother" to Heather. And a year went by. Or some time ... two years? I don't even know.   I thought Mike hated me ... it was alright though. WE had a lot of friends in common ... and we'd see each other around. He'd smirk at me and I would - I don't know. I was afraid of him. (As it turns out - he was afraid of me too ... this could turn into some Cosmo article on male vs. venus and mars or some shit. I'm not taking it there. Sorry - no I'm not). AND it was on that satanic and unholy day that I met Dave and Alexa at the Whiskey for the first ever ANDREW WK show in L.A. Mike was there. It made me nervous.   We all went to dinner at the Red Rock. He ate a burger. I couldn’t eat. I wasn’t hungry. I drank beer and we watched celebrity boxing. Was it Danny Bonaducci? Tanya Harding? Really not sure. I was on a, “double date”.  We got to the Whiskey and AWK was ready to play. Dave and Alexa quickly scurried off and Mike and I were left to fend for ourselves. It was awesome! We got along famously. We pogo’d. We danced! We clapped our hands over our heads and worshiped the PARTY-TIME MUSIC OF ANDREW WK. At some point in the conversation, I had mentioned Mike’s wife Suzanne. I hit a wall. They were separated. I was sorry. I was sorry for him. I was excited for me. I was confused as fuck. I WAS STOKED. I offered him a beer.  When did AWK break out? A couple years ago? No wait. Three years ago. Mike and Suzanne have been separated for three years. I don’t hate her this month. I hated her a lot in November when she was being the bad ex. Then I hated her for being “Hollywood”. After all, she worked at PMK … with Eve and Shannon Elizabeth. A slave to the Goddess of Celeb Ass Kissing: Pat Kingsley. Ick. I do will always dislike her for the … well, whatever. It’s over now … but dammit – I’m curious! What’s her deal?   I’ve only seen one picture of her. She looks nerdy … with kind of a “hot dog curl” and “frost & tip” hair. I picture her disposition, (do they use that term for humans?), similar to that of Monica Lewinski. Sometimes she’s a monster. Sometimes I just feel sorry for her. She treated Mike like shit. She’s a bad person. She’s the first love. But hell, WHAT THE HELL does a fifteen year old know anyway? First. Pre mature. Just like the marriage that she bossed him into ...  The fucked up part is … that inorder to bury this whole thing; I need to meet her. I found her on friendster. Yup. Her profile isn’t available to me because we are sooo many people apart: “not connected” … but by one man.:  Sorry! · Suzanne's full profile can only be viewed by members in Suzanne's personal network. · Suzanne can only receive messages from members in Suzanne's personal network.  She’s: 28, female, San Luis Obispo. But really, she’s from Los Osos.   I know where she lives. I know that she’s been in my neighborhood lately. I know that NONE of Mike’s friends have even said ANYTHING nice about her. I really feel like I need to see it for myself. Could 99 percent the people who have met her be right? Is that extra 1 percent right? What about the people who have randomly met her … and wanted to run away from her? What about his parents' opinion?  THE OTHER people on friendster … the “normals” … they just joined. They are all high-school notebook signers. Wait! Have I written about this before? These are all, “FUN” people … social, fun, party-girls. Suzanne’s “friendsters”. They like movies that are BOX OFFICE HITS, the Dave Matthews Band, Kickdogs, Reality shows, hiding their profiles … She's a part of a whole differnt breed of people. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them; but when I look at my eclectic list of friends and aquaintances ... they are a bunch of kooks. My friends are interesting. They have traveled to far off places and don't prefer to see every, "BLOCKBUSTER SMASH SEQUAL SEQUAL". Suzanne's friends are mostly party girls ... the sorority type. At least that is what I gether from their profiles.-  Just one meeting. I’ll be polite. Do other people feel this dirty need to, “stalk”? I know where she lives. I know she’s on friendster. I know I want her to prove everyone wrong. I have to meet her first. Is this right? Has this ever happend to you?  “You don’t ever NEED to meet her”.  And why not? Because she sucks? Because we have nothing in common? Because we have too much in common? Because she’d spar? I wonder what she thinks. That’s why.  Her name is tattooed onto his leg. I see it all the time. It drills itself into my brain. I try not to think about it. He is infused into my blood and my soul. She may always be his "first "- but I'll probobly be the "last". I find comfort in that ... maybe eventually I'll refrain from my stalking of Suzanne; if my curiosity lets me.  The divorce papers have been sitting on the table in his living room for over a month. She won't help him pay for any of it because she's busy buying shoes. Soon, he'll have the $300 and she'll legally go away. Of their two year marriage, they will have been separated and divorced after four years, (six years total). Maybe then I'll be able to let her go as well.   **NOTE: We didn't actually hook up till about ten months after the Andrew WK show.

        Hella FUCK  I know that Spring has sprung because I just want to babble about nothing all day long. I can't keep a straight thought. Roughing-up my cats is a big part of the day. I constantly want to molest my old man; I worship his wiener. Food eating is becoming less important. White wine sounds a lot better then red. Been drinking beer again too. The days are long. I walk my dog around the block. Second interviews for jobs prevail, (though - no job yet). I'm cocky. Wrestling sounds good. Maybe this summer I'll get to go to Dodger Stadium. More beachtime. Sunburn. Heartburn. Burn.

      PMDD ... Yup. Crazy. But only for about one week a month.  When I had PMDD spells, I can't really remember them too well. They are severe about ever other month. I drive anyone within a few feet of me crazy. I talk in circles. Try to start fights. Make NO sense at all. My doc gave me prozac. I only have to take it when I feel the "crazies" coming on. I have to take it. Even the devil's lettuce can't help me.  It usually starts with uncontrolable crying. I feel really dumb. I just cry and go about my business. Tears streaming down my face; knowing that I'm not going to be able to control myself within a few hours. I'm conscious of what I'm doing. Sort of. I just have no control of it. My brain tells me, "Oh, you're just being the dumb PMS Kook!" - but then the stuff that comes out of my mouth is outrageous!!!   Everything swirls around me ... remember the scene in "Poltergeist"? When all the toys and crap are whirling through the air in the little girl's bedroom? That's what the ideas, visions, agressions, confetti, hilarities, alphabets, crayons, wind and notions look like in my brain. I'm just watching it. Inside.    plaid boxcars swirling, stuff things, air and no air; suffocation tied tired, tense, sick stupid furniture, life, trees, wind basketball sky, drink, melt, swim creep.

      At the end of the "POOR days" ...  I will get the "play" button on my ipod fixed. I will buy a fire-wire adapter. I will buy a new laptop. I will replace the shitty carpet in my apartment. I will trade in my Escape for the new Hybrid. I will find a rad house to live in with my old man, Mike. I will get my cat bludgeoned designer couch reupolstered. I will take Mike to Slovakia. I will take a trip to Colombia and Ecuador to visit Kaleroy. I will take my dog to get bathed more often. I will travel to the Pacific Northwest. I will take some classes at UCLA Extension. I will start putting money into my 401K again. I will start to avoid future "poor days". I will buy more art. I will go out to eat at every restaurant in LA. I will get more massages. I will go wine tasting in San Luis Obispo. I will adopt more Maine Coons.

      Sen. McCarthy vs. President Bush = tie game  This morning, I was driving to the stupid West Side of LA as usual and listening to NPR. Bob Edwards, one of the the Morning Edition guys, wrote a book about the great Edward Murrow ... the PUNK ROCK reporter of World Way II ... he defied the status quo ... along with his bosses at CBS to bring the truth to, "The People". His words weave pictures as vivid as you'd see in one of the those Imax Theatres.   During this morning's broadcast, NPR finished the interview with Bob Edwards by playing a soundsbite of Murrow. It touched me. I completely missed my street that I needed to turn down to get to work!   "Oh shit! There goes Venice High School..." as I drove past.  Edward Murrow summed up McCarthy's BS in this paragraph. Just replace Sen. McCarthy with "President Bush" ... and SEE:  This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it -- and rather successfully. Cassius was right. "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves." Good night, and good luck.   -Edward Murrow, 1954    Bob Edward's book is called: "Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism".

      David Bowie  Last night I had a dream that I was hanging out with David Bowie. I was in Cleveland at a party or rock show and my friends ran off without me, or something. And I was in an elevator ... guess who got on?? Yep. Bowie himself. He was plastered. There were other people around me whispering and motioning at him: "that's David Bowie". No one would talk to him though. I figured, well, Bowie's wasted - so he's TOTALLY approachable now. So I started talking to him. He was somewhat bashful and giggled a lot. We had a wonderful talk about - I'm not even sure what.  I got to where I needed to be and I saw my friends Steven and Wendy: "I JUST HUNG OUT WITH BOWIE ... for like a half hour!!"  I don't know why the half hour was so key ... but it was. That's a lot of time. Especially with Mr. Bowie. I was soemwhat afraid of him because of this book I read about the life and times of Ziggy Stardust. Like back when he was humping Mick and Mick's wife ... he was quite a weirdo. A difficult person.  Not in my dream though. He has redeamed himself.  Perhaps this was a result of my roomate meeting Sir Paul McCartney at one of our favorite local hangouts the other night. She dropped him a note. He was sitting with his wife ... they read the note: "when I was in 6th grade I fell in love with you. then I went out and bought purple eye shadow". Paul & wife shrugged off the note ... but my roomate got to meet her childhood idol: now a KNIGHT, nonetheless.  For most, stuff like that only happens in thier dreams. Like Bowie and I. I feel the need to make a "friendship montage" of my thirty minutes with Bowie.  Maybe I'll watch Christiane F. tonight after I bake some cookies.

      The Lassie Foundation ... I went to see them  It was acoustic. Happy played the bells "ding dong". The singer made funny jokes. He put on an eye patch. Everyone was quiet: not us. We yelled, "AVAST!" and "ARRRRGH!".  We ate Indian Food. It was delicious. And free.  I want to see that band plugged-in. We yelled, "ARRRGH". It annoyed everyone. We like rock shows.  They gave us gift bags.

      This is a letter I sent to ABC, CBS & NBC ... please see why by going to:  http://www.fair.org/activism/womens-march-networks.html   To whom it may concern,   I was on vacation last weekend. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make it to Washington and I didn't have access to my usual news sources: Alternet, NPR and Free Speech Radio. I did, however, peruse the media giant's channels.    I am very disappointed that the reporting on the largest "Pro Choice" march on Washington was lukewarm at best. It makes me feel like your news coverage doesn't take women seriously: I am not a part of your target market, so why bother? It kind of renewed my faith in alternative news sources that aren't governed by advertisers, large corporations and (male?) politicians.   The thing that makes me truly sad is the fact that there are other women out there, (perhaps in smaller rural areas), that do not seek out the "real news". They watch your programs only. Perhaps they would have been inspired by some quality support from your affiliations? What about the men? How are they to know that there's a solid movement of women's rights? Perhaps some of them could have gained some understanding of the issues at hand?    What about the analysis of women's issues? Whether pro or con?   The public counts on YOU for fair and accurate reporting: especially if the don't have cable or satellite TV. This was not some "rinky-dink" little event ... about 1,150,000 people marched on Washington in the name of WOMEN's RIGHTS. I think that it deserves a little more credit.   Thank you.   Sincerely,   Rita Nadhazy Los Angeles, CA

       "BIZARRO CITY" - I mean, "Business as Usual" ...   BANG!  a giant BANg at that ... so I waited a few minutes to take out the dog. That was just about 20 minutes ago. Dog and I walked outside and the femmie mohhawk guy from next door was outside with one of his little buddies. One cop car drove by, "Did you guys hear a gunshot? Do you know where it came from?", they asked.  "Nah, you may want to ask her" and their fingers drew up from the ground and pointed in my direction.  "Yeah, I heard something. I can smell it. It may have been an M80, or something ..." and the cops didn't semm convinced by my answer. They asked me my name.   "wow, thanks for caring about our neighborhood"! - FINALLY.  It smelled like not sulfur, or the smell of fireworks in Ohio. Hell, it's 4th of July week. Terror may be in the alleyways and streets of Hollywood. Los Angeles would be flattered if someone - something, would strike here. Not this time. It may have been a gunshot. It set off the car alarms. Scared the animals. Made me a bit uneasy. The smell was different ... like the smell of soldering. What does a gunshot smell like?  "Wow, there have been a lot of cops around here lately ... what's going on in the hood?" - sassy mohawk and friend asked me.  The cop-cars continued to shark around the hood.  My dog sniffed them and made friends, I snarled at them like some sort of Vet, "awwww, man - you know. Scientology has bought out half of Hollywood Blvd, DIsney the other half and Sunset has been driven to commerce, (AKA 'Urban Renaissance'). So, the hookers, crackheads, kooks, gangs and 'crusties' are being driven into the neighborhoods".   My garage. OUr treelawns. The alley. Shit - that stuff's been here forever. Used needles, condoms, tampons ...people having sex in my garage. But not it's "extreme streetfolk". Fuck, it's Hollywood! Harold Way is getting bad. The "BAdtimes Renaissance". Again.

      Today a manlady, (gender unrecognizable), was stopped in front of me at Washington & Lincoln. If you have ever been to this intersection - you KNOW that it's always tied in knots. It's one of the gateways to Venice Beach, so its certain that there will be mass amounts of lost tourists, hippies and locals trying get get places. ANyway, the Manlady slowly rolled backwards and hit my bumper. S/he got stuck under my truck. I had to back up to unleash her! I couldn't care less. We passed through the intersection and s/he merged into the turning lane. Heading right to COSTCO to buy the extra double sized portions that suited her extra doubled-sized self.  I waved, "Don't worry about it".  S/he obviously had enough, and beyond, to deal with in her mega-shopping store life.

       My Mouth.   Fuck. I wish that I could keep my mouth shut sometimes. It goes on auto-pilot ... once I focus on something, I can bludgeon it with too many words. Sentences are manipulated. The mouth twists up topics until they are turned completely inside out. It starts off as a sunflower and I can magically turn it into a monkey wrench. Mouth says things that slice people's egos, feelings and souls. The words are hurled threw my body, out of my mouth and onto the floor into a pile. My vocal cords are selfish and vile.   I take responsibility and I am sorry.

         I wanna be a COP!!!!    If I was a cop, I would be a special one. The police stations of Los Angeles would create a unique position just for me. My job would be to drive around and give tickets to ONLY people that DON'T USE THEIR TURN SIGNALS. Yes, that's right ... I would cruise the streets in some sort of neat car, like, one of those silly Toyota Scion mini-vans. Or perhaps I'd get frisky in a Mini Cooper.  My car would be unmarked. Nothing could give me away! I'd have a radio - just incase someone tried to kick my ass for giving a ticket for such a "lame" reason. It's not lame to me. I really don't understand why folks don't use their turn signals. Is it such a huge burdon up on the driving experience? Perhaps the left hand is broken? (which also would cover the fact that IF, IFFF you signal is broken ... you CAN'T stick your left hand out the window to signal! Didn't we learn that in driver's ed???).  I would put my little 1970's style red-disco-light on top of my gay little car and hit a little button:  "BWOOOP", would be the sound that comes out from under the hood.  No. You weren't speeding. You were not drunk, or crashing a stop sign. Forget about turning left on red. You- DID NOT use a turn signal. You just cut me off ... no use of the ole blinker. You didn't signal that you were pulling out of the spot that you parallel wedged your automobile into. Lane change? No signal? TICKET.   The ticket would cost you about $100. I would make a 25% commission on those buggers ... I could become a millionaire!! I would work reaaalllll hard to help curb the mistreatment of that little stick that somes out from the left side of your steering column. I could turn the world on!   "See this right here", as I'd point to the mechanism, "If you push it up ... it tells the other people in cars around you that you will soon turn RIGHT".  My "student" would ask about the others on the road ... and I would put them at ease:  "You aren't the only one on the road. Look over there. See those cars? There are other people in them! Can you believe it? If you push the lever down ... it will tell them that you will turn LEFT. AND, you shouldn't wait until you are already turning to use it. It's kind of a warning device so they can slow down and .... perhaps, not rear end you!".  My law breaker would be so happy that I helped them out ... "THANK YOU!! THANK YOU! I would have NEVER remembered learning that if it wasn't for you!".  I'd hand them the ticket, "Have a nice day ... and drive safe".

      Correction ... for the "Ex Wife" entry ...  Yes, I still hate HER. I will until it's final. If ever. She can eat a bag of dicks.

       I met a publicist.  A “Hollywood” one .  Today I had the pleasure of meeting, “Tuh-Ray-Seee-ah”. She pranced her way into my office to say hello to my boss. She was wearing one of those horrendous tube-top dresses. It was pastille pink with diagonal stripes across it … it looked like something right off the 80’s era American Bandstand: the worst era for fashion ever. Heavy cotton fabrics modeled after gym clothes.  And Pastel.   So, like, Tray-see, like totally bounced into MY office because, like, her firm is so doing the PR for the girl’s clothing line that my company is designing! I was interoduced to her and she reached out part of her hand and her pinky and ring fingers just melted into my genuine handshake:  “Oh – Hiiii-uh! Mah name is Tuh-Rayy-seee-ah. Like, Nice to meet you!!!”  Likewise.  I went back behind my desk to brace for cover because I could feel the swell of bullshit coming on. I even underestimated it. She went on the talk about her: “AY-DEE-DEE” and the “gala, but not black tie event that the tickets are like, $100 to get in the door. But it’s a total evening event and there will soooo be a fashion show and silent auction. Like, it’s this Friday … and it’s totally booked, BUT: I’m sure that I could squeeze you in” … she was pouring it on … for my boss and the owner of the company.   “Like, blah blah blah – Avril Levign ...buh-blah blah blah- Paris Hilton is totally my buddy!!! I have her number in my cell phone … like, we could totally get her to wear you clothing line … and she’s like totally the fashion icon of the day … OH AND WAIT … Shannon Elizabeth … Oh –muh-GAWD, she is soo TOTALLY indebted to me! Maybe I’ll just call her and she would LOVE the line” …  I had to interject at this point. I was getting swallowed up by her nonsense and my boss’ smile and nodding.  “Oh! You know Shannon Elizabeth? Wow, my boyfriend knows someone that used to do her publicity at PMK when she was there!”  It was at this point that Tuh-ray-see proceeded to turn her back on me as she continued her mindless natter.  And her back stayed turned as she walked out the door without making any sort of eye contact with me. Her head faced down. What could I have said to make her so rude to me all of the sudden? This is a great mystery.   “Good bye, Tray-seee”. Thanks for the inspiration. Gee, it’s really great that you don’t even have to work in porn to kiss celebrity ass.

       Picture story time ... a picture book of not much.     Heather gets busted taking a photo up a waitress' skirt at the "Wilboyz" party.    Great snacks.   This is Marc. He's my Maine Coone. He's a good boy that loves spicey cheese and playing in the sink. Since we once teased him with one of those, "laser pointers" ... he is obsessed by flashing red lights. Someday you'll see him doing a back-float on the dining room table. That's where he lives.    Skateboarding has come to this. Paparazzi mob Lance Mountain at the pink motel. Yep.    Some of the most bizarre characters always show up at the Pink Motel. I'm not sure what it is about that place, but it's always a freak-scene. And there's always one'them kookie, "snake sessions" that Eddie Reattegui is always in the middle of.

       Lady in the Apron.   Today I saw a lady by the dumpster in the alley. She had a stick and was poking through the trash. I hucked my bag of dog shit into the dumpster that was to be next on her route:  "Be careful. There's dog poop in that one", I told her.  She answered me with, "Seniorina! I hongry. Change?".  Of course, as usual - all I had on me was a gromit from a belt I broke last week and some crinkled up paper.  "Sorry".  She was wearing an apron while digging through the trash. She was wearing an apron - kinda like my grandma used to. Like my great aunt did in "Torokszentmiklos" ... a tiny village in the flatlands of Hungary. Fuck. She's hungry. And she's someone's grandmother that should be baking a pie or something. Not digging through dogshit and needles for bottles and cans.  I made her a sandwich. Sharan threw in a banana.   I ran through the alley looking for her. She's fast ... she was already behind Sondra's apartment. I heard the bottles clanging. I gave her, "comida", in a  Bath & Body Works  bag. She didn't hesitate to accept it from me.  "Senk Yoo! Senk yoo varree much", she said. And I almost cried.
