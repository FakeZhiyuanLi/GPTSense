       Hello Everybody!   I think this is way cool. I have missed everyone for so long and think it's great that we are all trying to keep in touch again. I did go to our 10 year reunion thinking I would get to see everyone from our "gang", but nobody! Was there. That was the whole reason I went and so excited about this. Well let me let you in on what's been going on in my life...The short version. I am still working as an RN. I have been in pediatrics the whole time. I have done the pediatric wards and the pediatric ER and now gave up working nights, weekends, and holidays to work at a special needs day care. I love it, but am a little bored, but being bored isn't a bad thing. It's a lot less stress and the kids are great. I did get married in 1993 to a guy who I thought was the best. He decided to like guys instead of girls and we got divorced in 1996. I did some travel nursing for a few years and ended back in Florida. I guess I was meant to be here. I have been here since 1996. I bought a house and then met the most wonderful man in the world....Edison. We just got married June 26th of this year. We have been together for 4 years and this is the one! We have 2 kids....Ha..Dachshund Baxter and Princess. They are our kids for now...Who knows about the future. My parents are still at the same house 15th and Porter Ave. If you are in the neighborhood you should pop in and tell them hello they would love it. I have kept in touch with Amber. I have sent her the web site info and will let her fill you in on her life, but I can tell you that she is happily married and living in North Carolina. Well that is my life in a nut shell and will keep posting as long as everybody else does. Love you guys!    PS.  I did change my name it's now Lisa Torres

       Schmer wanted us to post our bios on here, so here is mine. Robert and I have been married since September 6, 2003; hence our new e-mail address:  urlLink robandrobinscott9603@verizon.net    Bob is 47, he works for ISG(formally known as Bethlehem Steel). I work for Life Care Center of Valparaiso, but I am pursuing the Electricians Apprentinceship Program and I am taking classes for a steelmill workers certificate, which ISG wants you to have before they hire you. We have 3 daughters(I don't call them step-children): Sherry is 28, she is a Surg-tech in Chicago. She is married to Ivo(pronouneced Evo) who is from Slovakia and is contracted to paint new houses in the Chi-town area. Heather is 23. She has an Associates in Business through Purdue North Cornfield. She is currently pursuing a degree in Horticulture from the main campus of Purdue. She is going to Greece this fall on a scholarship. Jessie is 22. She is her third year of apprenticeship for the pipe-fitters. She is engaged to Will, who is an apprentice plumber. All 3 girls are trying to have kids, so I may be a grandma soon. Also, Bob and I are trying to have a child. We already have the names picked. If boy, Zachariah Augustus, if twin boys, then the second one will be named: Stephan Micheal James. For our first girl: Catherine Marie, if twin girls the second one will be named: Amber Elisabeth Marie. This is my bio. Hope to hear from everyone soon.

      I just got off the phone with Robin - I was sitting here at work and the phone rang and there was this familiar voice on the other end that I couldn't quite place... it's so hard to believe that it's been fifteen years since high school!    It's great to hear what everyone is up to and find out how they've spent those years.  I spoke with Lisa Lorenz on Friday and sent her the invitation to this blog - I think Robin did also, so hopefully she'll be online soon.    Hey - in the "missing list" - how about Mike Butler and Matt Dougherty?  Does anyone know where they are?

      Hi, guys! &nbsp; Schmer, thanks for setting up the blog... great idea! &nbsp; Looking forward to reconnecting with everyone - it's been far too long. &nbsp; I'm living in Los Angeles these days.&nbsp; It's definitely an interesting city, but not someplace I'd like to stay indefinitely.&nbsp; After living in Boston&nbsp;during college, I ended up traveling around for a while, living abroad for a bit and then in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and then in Chicago, with Lis Peters.&nbsp; I met my husband of three years John [Luciano] there.&nbsp; We moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to check out the animation scene (John's an animator).&nbsp; I'm the media relations person for a medium-sized university -  urlLink www.lmu.edu . &nbsp; As John's canadian (he's from Toronto), we have to split our time at Christmas in both places, but I'm hoping we can get back to Chicago for at least a couple of days this year. It would be so great to see you all! &nbsp; Melissa Abraham [kept my maiden name, too] 323.654.2512 or cell 310.345.8698 (hey, since I have to have it for work, might as well use it for fun, too!)  &nbsp;

      Okay Schmer-a-licious, &nbsp; This is my "maiden posting..."&nbsp; Just wanting to see if I can figure it out.&nbsp; Fabulous idea of having a central blog for everyone.&nbsp; I called Diana on Friday to chat and had too much fun!&nbsp; I commented to her that while she sounds the same, her voice is somehow " different ."&nbsp; Minus the pounding of other women in a pro football league, our lives are strangely similar! &nbsp; A few quick facts:&nbsp; I've been married for ten years this month to Matt.&nbsp; We met at IU when we were sophomores.&nbsp; We have no kids as of yet.&nbsp; We haven't tried, but maybe in the near future.&nbsp; Our current children are two scottish terriers named Maggie and Dolly.&nbsp; We live in northeast Indianapolis.&nbsp; I teach Spanish at Lawrence North High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt is the "I.T. guy" for a company called Cardinal Service Management in New Castle.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Okay, can't think of anything else at the moment. &nbsp; I look forward to reading everybody else's posts..... &nbsp; Kelly

      Monica Marlowe emailed me and asked when we were thinking about getting together at Christmas time - she can PROBABLY get either the two days before OR after Christmas off.  We haven't really discussed a day yet, but I guess I'm thinking that we should do it on the 26th or 27th.  That's just my initial thought.  Any other thoughts/suggestions/questions/comments/concerns?  If anyone is lost in regards to what I'm talking about, Robin Wilson [new last name "Scott"] and I talked about having all of us actually GET TOGETHER AT CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR.  This year marks our 15 YEAR ANNIVERSARY of graduating from high school, and, while it seems like we should be having a formally organized 15 year REUNION, one doesn't seem to be in the works.  SO, Robin and I figured that we'd still like to get together with those that we actually cared about in high school anyway.  Robin has graciously offered up her [furnished?] basement and leftover wedding alcohol.  I still don't have a job, but I'm hoping that I will get one within the next month.  If I somehow DON'T get a teaching job, then money might be tight and there would be a chance that I couldn't make it back to Cheesetown for Christmas [although, since I haven't been back there for Christmas in 4 years, maybe my parents would spring for a ticket for me...].  If/When [let's think positively] I do get a teaching job with the school district here [San Francisco], then I will get a couple of weeks off for Christmas and should have enough money saved to get my butt back to the Midwest [plus, I'm DYING to go to  urlLink H&M  in Chicago - why isn't there one in San Francisco yet??].  [The above paragraph is not my official "bio" - just a pathetic snapshot for the moment.]

      Diana posted the following as a "comment" off of my first post the other day.  I thought that it deserved to be on the front page - the submitting/posting a bio is a great idea and I think they deserve to be showcased as posts, rather than being relegated to a "comment page" where people might not find them.  Here's what she wrote:   At 4:42 PM,  Diana said...  This is so cool! I am looking forward to hearing from everyone. I think we should all post a little blurb about ourselves--you know, our "grown-up" lives.  I've been married for 8 years to Chuck Michel (CHS 1988). We have no kids (yet) but are hoping to adopt a newborn this fall or winter. It's very exciting for us. We live in Kokomo, Indiana. I'm an audiologist and Chuck is a psychotherapist. I play and officate sports in my spare time. I am currently trying my hand at women's professional football--I'm an offensive tackle ( urlLink www.indianaspeed.org ) --check out the website, there are a few pictures of me there, too. I'm also playing volleyball (court and sand), and I play and umpire slow pitch softball.  I still play cards with friends, and try to take their money whenever possible. Miss the old days. Loved all of you guys tons, and can't wait to get together.  Diana Sowers (kept my maiden name) (765) 864-0362   Hey, Eric again.  I sent out something from Blogger [the host of this site] to a number of you whose emails I have and trust, "inviting" you to become members of this site.

      This is set to be the [un]official board/blog for the Freaks & Geeks of the Chesterton High School Class of 1989.  Hope no one is offended by the title - just thought it somewhat appropriate.  I wrestled with using the term "Outsiders" instead [sounds much more literary, eh?], but ultimately went with  urlLink "Freaks & Geeks"  because I've always been more "pop culture" than literary.  Oh, and I also considered calling the site "the Gang" from CHS, but I thought that the Department of Homeland Security [that whole "Patriot Act" and all] would be on our asses if I went with that name.  SO, the purpose of this whole thing is to get the old "gang" [had to use it in this context] back together again.  Beyond that, I hope that it can be a place for years to come where we can all still be in touch.  I know that I'm not alone in thinking that the high school experience, as a whole, blew.  BUT, hanging out with all of you made it all SO much more bearable.  You all brought fun and joy during that awkward time, and for that I am eternally grateful [crying yet?].   So, I'm going to post this and begin to figure out how we can ALL use this so that we can cut down on the flooding of messages to our individual email boxes.  THIS IS SO EXCITING, huh?  Oh, one last thing:  I am all about Free Speech and the Rights of all human beings, and I hate to sound all "exclusive", but let's keep certain people out of the loop of this thing.  The more the merrier, but remember the title -   the Freaks & Geeks  of Chesterton High School Class of 1989 .  The "cool" and "popular" folk never paid attention to us in high school, so...  Can you tell that I'm still a bit bitter?  ERIC [Schmer]

          Hello everyone! Sorry it’s taken me so long to post, but we just moved and have been having internet issues. Here’s what we’ve been up to:         After Purdue I went to the University of Illinois at Chicago for social psychology and Rob went to the University of Chicago for molecular biology. After grad school I started teaching psychology and statistics at Valparaiso University. Rob did a post-doc in plant biology at the U of C for several years and in a couple of weeks he begins his first year as a professor at VU! We just moved from Chicago to Valpo and bought our first house. It’s very cute, but its best feature is that it is so close to campus that we can both walk to work. We don’t have any kids as of yet, just two cats.          We got married in 1997. We both really wanted to avoid a huge wedding that would take years to plan, but our families seemed intent on a big fiasco. Our solution was a surprise wedding. Rob told our families that he wanted to throw a surprise party for me because I had just finished my masters. So, both families planned a great party. When we showed up and they yelled surprise, we got to spring the news that we were getting married right then and there. We had a friend of the family (John Misher’s dad) become a justice of the peace for the day so that he could perform the ceremony. It was perfect.          Oddly enough, I just ran into Amy Snearly’s sister Kathy. She said that Amy is living in Chesterton with her husband Steve and their two adorable little boys. Amy is teaching grade school in Michigan City. However, I don’t have her email address or phone number. Unfortunately, I can’t remember Steve’s last name either.                   I also have some info about Michelle Jobin that might help. She married David Engen and worked at Eli Lily in Indy. Last I heard from her they had two kids and David was a dentist.         Since I’m practically living in Chesterton, I’m sure I’d be able to make a Christmas reunion. It would be great to see you all again.

      Steve Levy and Michelle Levy (Ream) say hello from Indianapolis.  Yes, we finally did get married and yes, we, believe it or not have been together for over fourteen years now. :) Steve's a tax attorney for Ernst and Young and I am an age group coach for a swim club (I guess it's kind of like track and field!##% in that they both require stop watches.  We have a home right outside of Indy so if anyone is in town feel free to call or stop by.  Our e-mail is  urlLink Meshellev14@aol.com .   Can't wait to hear from everyone.

       I see that several people have mentioned a possible "reunion" around Christmas.  I thought maybe we could start a post to discuss plans.  As for me, my family and I will be "...back home again, in Indiana..." for part of my Christmas break from school.  We'll be attending my grandmother's 80th birthday party on Dec 19th.  We haven't decided how long to stay in IN yet.  With 3 kids, Christmas is easier if we're home, but it would be nice to see snow.  I know snow isn't guaranteed in IN at Christmas (I remember playing basketball in shorts & a t-shirt on Christmas day one year) but the chances are better there than here in TN.      What plans does anyone else have?       -Mike

      Hi Everyone. Thanks to Eric for organizing this internet page. It is great!!  So....the short version of what I have been up to. Did undergrad up in New Hampshire at Dartmouth College, graduated in '93. When I was done with that I did a year for the "domestic Peace Corp" in Eugene, Oregon. I was working with a parenting education organization. The experience was both very rewarding and challenging. When I was done with that, I took another year off and more or less hung out in Chesterton for a year before starting medical school at University of Vermont in 95. There I meet someone and became engaged to someone who I thought was the most amazing man in the world ( I later found out I was wrong). He had his dream job in New Jersey (ewww) and so I did my internship for pediatrics there. After the first few months, I realized that the program was not what I was looking for (it was too easy). So, then I transferred to Emory in Atlanta for the last 2 years of pediatric residency. Right before the completion of residency in 2002....the engagement ended (which was a very good thing, although it was hard on me). I ended up having a job in private practice fall into my lap and joined this great group of about 6 other pediatrician. Overall, being a pediatrician is a great job.... very rewarding and have wonderful patients. I have been with this group for the last 2 years (since I finished residency) and looking at being partner in a bit.  Been living in Atlanta for the last 4 years and really love it here....the weather is great, nice people and yummy restaurants, fun things to do and there is no snow. I have been looking to buy a house here in Atlanta for the last 7 months, no luck yet. Otherwise, on the relationship front, I have had some wonderful relationships, but no Mr. Right yet.  If anyone finds themselves in Atlanta, let me know. My phone is 404/486-0850 and my email is  urlLink mmar@alum.dartmouth.org

      Hi Everyone, Here I am...I finally figured out how to do this! No computer genius here.  I've been enjoying reading about everyone else, so now here's a little bit about me... After college I was living in Chicago for a while and just wasn't figuring out what I should be doing, so in '97 I picked up and moved to New York City--well, just outside of the city in Westchester until I figured out whether I wanted to stay.  Some of my college friends (Kent State) welcomed me with open arms and soon became a second family.  I lived in Manhattan in the East Village for a while--figured if I was going to be in NYC, I should live in the heart of it all which was really awesome.  Did a bunch of temp work finally stumbling on the offices of Clinique (the cosmetics co.), then tired of my expensive shoe box apartment, I moved to Brooklyn. Now, thanks to a tip from a co-worker I've moved to Astoria, Queens into what here is considered a huge apartment which I share with my boyfriend.  It's a great, diverse neighborhood only 15-20 minutes on the subway to midtown Manhattan. [Contrary to popular belief (Robin) it's nothing like the part of Queens you see in that Eddie Murphy movie Coming To America!  I have worked my way up at Clinique in their in-house advertising department as Manager of Creative Operations.  Basically it's a lot of just making sure people are sticking to timetables, but it's comfortable and has a lot of great perks (only it took me 5 years to get them to hire me on as full time).  So I'm finally getting settled in--definitely plan on staying in NYC for the indefinite future. Ok, the boyfriend...  He's Courtney Prescott.  I met him through mutual friends.  In October it will be 4 years since our first date.  He's terrific.  Wedding bells somewhere in the future.  We don't have a home computer yet (saving up to get one soon) so I may not write very often unless I get more down time at work or feel like staying after like now.  I will be in Indiana at Christmas so I'm totally in for a reunion! I love the photos!  xo Lis

       Felt like a purple mood today!   Jenny Winquist just e-mailed me about an hour ago to say that she deleted(on accident) the invitation I sent her. So another one is on its way. Hopefully, her and Rob will be joining the "f&gs" soon. I am excited that everything is moving along so well. Talk to you all soon.

      I'm not sure where to begin.  OK - well I start by thanking Eric for putting this together - what a great idea!  I'm totally up for getting together in December.  Lets make sure we make it happen!  I guess I'll start with college & go from there-- I graduated from Purdue in Dec. 92 in Fine Arts, moved to Denver a year or so later with my finace at the time.  We lived there for a year [and had a lot of fun hiking and biking] but I moved back home when things didn't work out.  Then, I moved back to Colorado for about 6 months on a soul searchng adventure and ended up in Lafayette, IN - where I lived until last year.  I worked at Purdue for a few years in the in-house printing operation.  I left a string of disasterous relationships and my first house, which I loved, and moved back to Valparaiso to get married to a wonderful man who my sister introduced me to.  His name is Al and we are happy as clams.  We were married last September (27th).  We have two dogs and two cats and will probably start working on the family next year.  As of late I've been working in printing and making art on the side [I always leave art on the back burner & don't know if I'll ever change that].  I have begun to exhibit my work and hope to get more out there.  This fall I'm going to start my yoga teacher certification program in Chicago - so I'm very excited about that.  I started taking yoga several yars ago after a bad break-up, and haven't stopped since - I love it!  I recently left my job at a local printer and am currently looking for work in marketing/communications.  In fact, I logged on to quick check my email before I dug into my job searching efforts for the day - and here I am - freaking & geeking!  Oh well, that's the way it goes.  I miss you all and remember those times as bittersweeet.  Besides all the family crap I was going through at the time, it was so hard to be a teenager and to figure out who you are and where you fit in.  You all made that a bit easier.  Man, did we have fun.  Amy

      Hello to everyone and thanks so much for including me! It is really great to read about everyone. I am extremely bad at keeping in touch with people so it is nice to find out what's happening. I definitely like the name of the group and would like to place myself in the "geek" category. I was on the high school math team so how much cooler can you get! (and Monica Marlowe - don' t try to hide because YOU were on the math team too as I seem to recall).  We're supposed to give a little blurb about ourselves so here is mine. I've been married for 7 years now to Lisa (she is from Crown Point). We met in high school but didn't start dating until much later. We have three children - Joey 5, Olivia 3 and Sam 10 months. As you can guess things are quite busy at home. I went to Wabash College (with Mike Butler actually - Eric, please email me as I think I can help you get a hold of him). After college I attended IU school of medicine and got my M.D. degree and subsequently did five years of residency training in anatomic and clinical pathology at Ball Hopstial in Muncie. After residency I got a job at the South Bend Medical Foundation as a pathologist and have been working there for the last 2 years (I am not a forensic pathologist, though). We live near South Bend so as you can see I've never left Indiana - pretty exciting, huh?  As far as some of the other lost members, I can help out with two. Rob Swanson got his PhD from the University of Chicago and is still working there as far as I know. Check out  urlLink http://preuss.bsd.uchicago.edu/people/swanson.html  if you want to know what he is up to. I haven't talked to him in ages. I emailed him awhile back but didn't hear back from him. He and Jenny Winquist did get married and she is a psychology professor at Valpo U (also has her PhD degree). Check out  urlLink http://faculty.valpo.edu/jwinquis/  if you want to see what she has been up to recently. As far as I know they live in Chicago but I could be wrong - it has been a very long time since I heard from either of them.  I very much look forward to hearing from/about everyone. If there would happen to be a get together I could probably make it whenever as I live fairly close to Chesterton and my parents are still there. My email address is  urlLink dforchetti@msn.com  so feel free to drop me a line. I am a very poor conversationalist but my phone numbers are (574) 243-5533 (home) and (574) 245-7553 (work).  Bye for now,  Derrick

      Hello, everyone.  I have never participated in a "blog" before, but thanks to Eric for making it happen.  As Lisa mentioned, I live in North Carolina now.  We moved here about 3 years ago from Miami, and I love it. I got married in '95 to my college sweetheart, Steve. We have one daugher, Emily, who is 51/2 and another baby on the way.  Yes, that's why I don't think I'll be able to make it in December, but I promise to keep up with the freaks & geeks.  I don't make it back to Indiana anymore. My parents moved to Buffalo, NY then Park City, UT and now they are in a remote part of Washington state. Remember little Scotty? He just graduated from U of Washington in Seattle this spring.  He's over 6 feet tall and could easily push me around if he ever cared to.  Right now I work for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina.  Don't ask how I got started working for health plans, but I really enjoy what I do.  My husband is a computer engineer and works for Nortel Networks. Emily is about to start Kindergarten next week, and I'm quite  a basket case.   Those are the basics. I'd love to hear about what everyone else is doing.  I hear you're looking for Amy Davis.  These addresses were recent as of last year, but I'm awful at keeping in touch.  Try this one:  urlLink zipogo@yahoo.com   or her work address:  urlLink adavis@homemountain.com

      Schmer, the photos you posted are hilarious!  The one of you and John and the one of Lis are ones I took in photo class - I think I have tons of those somewhere of all of us, I'll have to try to dig them up and send some more to you!  Robin - so great to talk with you.  Sorry our conversation got cut short - it's hard to talk while I'm at work, and sometimes the cell doesn't get the best reception inside the building.  Anyway, glad to hear you are doing so well!

      Just a few things to mention:  Diana - I don't know what keeps happening, but, once again, you aren't listed on the "Member" page at all.  Right after I sent you another "invitation" email, you showed up as being in "pending" status, but, now you don't show up at all.  John, Lis, Monica - get on the ball and sign up for goodness sake.  You've all been "pending" for weeks now.  We want your active participation here, so give us what we want.  Welcome to Lisa!  Lisa, I got the pictures that you sent.  Where the hell did the picture of Rob, RHODA VALPATEC [sp?], and myself come from?!?  I don't remember that occasion at all!  By the look on my face, it must've been while Rhoda and I were "going out"...  What was I thinking?  The big group picture must've been at some dinner party - was it a COUPLES thing?  That one is so good that I think that I will just figure out how to post it in a actual post rather than shrinking it down to fit on the side.  If I shrunk it, you wouldn't get to see everyone's bright, shining faces.  Oh, and the one of you 4 Purdue Ladies [that's what I named the photo] is just SO college.  Amber and Derrick have been sent "invitations" to join!  Amber is now completely aware of what we are doing here, but it looks like she might not be able to attend in December.  I'll let her tell you why when she signs up and starts posting.  As for Derrick, I found an email from him off of his personal website:   urlLink http://www.forchetti.org/ .  Oh, and exploring a little more there, I just found an MSN email address that I will try sending something to as well.  Haven't officially gotten his attention/participation, but hopefully we are on our way.  Oh, and I'm hoping that Amber can get us back in touch with Amy Davis.  She [Amy] contacted me a few years back, we lost touch, and a couple of weeks ago  I tried calling the number that I had for her but it wasn't an active number anymore...  I called Ream's parents last week and left a message on their machine asking them to pass along to Michelle my contact info.  Haven't heard anything from her yet, so I may call them again this week.  I did a search on whitepages.com for "Winquist" and "Chesterton" - assuming that HER parents were still in the same place - and came up with a Winquist on some strange street that I had never heard of.  Anyone know where she and Rob are [I'm assuming that they are married by now...]?  It seems like when I last heard from/about them they were both working/in school at UIC.  Actually, maybe that was when I talked to them at Diana's wedding...
