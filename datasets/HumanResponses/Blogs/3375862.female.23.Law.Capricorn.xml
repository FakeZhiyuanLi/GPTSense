      Last night has confirmed what I always suspected - I am a genius at making prawn curry. Actually it wasn't a prawn curry proper, but a really easy recipe which had the definite virtue of not requiring me to buy anything more taxing than a lemon and some tomato puree - I had everything else in the house - and being staggeringly simple. And I found the recipe on the internet! God bless it.  Tonight I am having what I have so far only been able to define as a 'drinks thing' in a pub, as a sort of leaving Bristol do. I have sent out an e-mail to people I think might like to come, and a few text messages to non-e-mail-type philistines, and that's all, apart from a couple of pleas to close friends not to leave me sitting there all alone at eight this evening... so it might be fifty people or it might be five. We'll have to see. At least one ex-boyfriend is going to be there, possibly with new fiance in tow, which is a bit scary, but he is known to be friendly, as opposed to the sort of hostile ex who only comes to see if you've put on weight and to make sure you know how much more successful they are than you.  Other than that I am packing up my office today - going through files and boxes and throwing away pages and pages of notes it took me years to compile. Ah well. Realistically speaking, life would have to take a real nosedive for future years to see me anxiously seeking out those notes on Free Movement of Goods in the European Union I wrote in the second year. Actually I sort of have a duty to ensure I never, ever do such a thing... so out they will go, and good riddance to them.

      Busy day yesterday. My mother commented that when I'm in a lazy mood, nothing can get me off the sofa and away from my computer or my book... but when I get going, I become what she calls a 'woman of action'. I don't know about that... but I did get a lot done yesterday. All the boring moving house admin stuff, writing letters, pressing numbers and speaking loudly and clearly after the beep... I also schlepped up Park Street with a carrier bag of books in one hand and another five in a rucksack - if you have never been to Park Street, which I strongly recommend for the shopping, be prepared for it to get pretty sodding steep just when you start to lose your puff. I arrived red-faced and dishevelled, and looking almost exactly like the sort of person whose textbooks you don't want to buy back for 50% of their value in vouchers. They still did, though. Fifty pounds' worth of book money!! Heaven!  Apropos of which, I did give myself a bit of a treat, and visited the Green Leaf bookshop on Park Row. It is the kind of place that bookshops should be, that my bookshop would be if I ran one. It is run as a collective, and stocks all the stuff you can only find a small snooty selection of in Waterstones - LGTB fiction and non-fiction, books on Wicca, on solar-powered houses, on gardening according to the lunar cycle... and a lovely collection of fiction lovingly handpicked by the staff. It's a tiny room, but they find space for an armchair and an enchanting children's section, so that parents can browse undisturbed - it's the kind of place you spend an hour or so in without much trouble, just looking... As ever, I got chatting and ended up walking away with a clutch of new recommendations, which I shall seek out and might share with you later. Lovely stuff. I must find out where this sort of place can be found in Birmingham, of which I have so far only seen the high street big brand bits in the middle. There must be people like me in a place that size, surely?  I found a brilliant present for a person I know who is currently on a personal journey, though - a 'healing words' version of the magnetic poetry kit. Normally I avoid these things as overpriced and a little redundant - can't you do it with a pad and a pen? Or a computer? But with this I can imagine the recipient being able to look at a new meaningful message they have written for themselves every morning on the bathroom cabinet as they brush their teeth, and on the freezer among the Edinburgh festival magnets as they wash the cats' dishes. I feel very proud of myself.  Well, I have another list of things I ought to do today, but tonight is my indulgent night in - ER, Frasier and two episodes of Sex and the City. I may be a free thinker keen to seek out new independent bookshops but I still love a night of good quality American telly. I am going to make myself a prawn curry (my only miscalculation this month has been to buy a large bag of frozen prawns for use in risottos and things, which usually lasts me months and which I am now going to have to dispose of in two weeks - last night was prawns and fresh veg with coriander cous cous, the night before was garlic prawns with pasta - not bored yet, but I will be), invest in a bottle of wine and chill out after my hard day of doing stuff. Which I must get on with.... bis morgen.

      Well, I'm nearly there. This morning's criminal law exam went relatively well - relative to the disaster it could have been, that is. The exam has been one of those frustrating occasions when you encounter a subject which fascinates you, which you work hard to understand and read widely on, and which you then totally underestimate when you come to revise for it. I found myself panicking, feeling that I could never ever learn all that detail, and getting up at five-thirty this morning to recite cases and statutes to myself. But when it came to it, I realise now that an understanding of the law is about the most that you are going to get across in such a short space of time, barely forty minutes per question. Even if you learned every case and every comment on it, you could never demonstrate your knowledge because there simply isn't time. Annoying, in a way - I feel I've not been able to show off all my hard work - but then my study of criminal law is one of the things that has informed my decision to study an LL.M in Law in Development at Warwick, so everything bleeds into everything else, as it always does.  I only have one more exam and then I will be leaving Bristol, and UWE, and this lovely flat, for an equally lovely house in Birmingham. As the date approaches, I'm starting to feel increasingly odd about it, as you do when the reality of a big change hasn't yet sunk in. I've lived in this city for five years, give or take a few months in Germany and Edinburgh. My time here has included some of the most difficult experiences a person can have - the loss of a sister, the rejection of my peers, confronting my sexuality and my relationship with my father, depression and finally admitting that I'm not ok, after all; and my first home with the Soulmate. Leaving the city means leaving a place where every street is overlaid by memories of past experiences as I walk down them. Thinking about it, this time living here with the Soulmate has softened the pain of older memories, and replaced them with new, happy ones. New cities built on the ruins of other cities, like in Greece. The old cities are blurring over time, and I'm glad, but I won't forget them.  I'll miss this flat, though. It's beautiful, I wish everyone had somewhere this safe to be. It's snug, tucked away in a beautiful building in the oldest part of Bristol. The developer's literature says it's part of the old orchestra gallery. It only has three rooms, but while the main living room has high ceilings, big windows, friendly old wood panelling and a beautiful fireplace, the bedroom is up a couple of steps. It has a lower ceiling, and a beautiful deep square window that is actually the top of the tall windows that run from the first floor to the roof. We have chinese lanterns in bright pinks and yellows slung from the frame, and dim lamps in cosy corners - I don't remember feeling so safe anywhere. I guess part of that is down to my Soulmate, with whom I can argue and bitch with impunity without ever worrying he won't love me still. It's our first home together, and we're leaving it, what an odd thought. I'm glad we have so many photos of us taken here.  But I am excited about having a bigger house and part of me wonders whether we don't need it - it's wonderful living so close with my Soulmate, but I think we might be able to be a bit more rational about our effect on each other if there was more room. My constant tidying wouldn't worry him so much, for example. A bit scary though. A whole house, I'll have to be a real grown-up... and do more dusting. I hate dusting.  And on that note: time for a cup of tea.

      A hiatus - the university requires me to prove my excellent understanding of the English Criminal Law by spending another couple of hours tomorrow in a collective sweating and scribbling session with a hundred or so other scared scribes... and I'm not sure I know it all yet. So, I am writing revision cards full of spidery writing and phrases underlined in fluorescent pen, and preparing to learn them by heart, in order to parrot it all out onto the page in the exam. If my Trusts and Civil Liberties exams are anything to go by, I will then come home, have a celebratory glass of wine or two, and forget everything I have learned almost immediately.  More tomorrow, when I am allowed to think about other things again.

      Well, I'm fed up.  Moving house is supposed to be one of the most stressful things you can do, next to taking your A-Levels, taking your driving test, and taking four small children on holiday. Even moving out of a rented flat, which we are doing, into a rented house, which we have found, is made inordinately difficult by little twists of fate and ankle-twisters of ill-fortune which pop up everywhere. Our current estate-agents can't return calls... Our incipient estate agents can send neither fax nor letter without four days of gentle reminders from me, progressing to terse promptings as the time wears on. I have no job yet - everyone I know is self-employed and therefore scum in the eyes of landlords who want a guarantor, except my father, who apparently can't  receive  a particularly vital fax... And so it goes on. Sitting amid the half-packed wreck of her hitherto snug little house, Myriadesque feels another hair turn grey and thinks wistfully of a camper van or a teepee somewhere.  The piece de resistance came last night, however, when before my horrified eyes a glass of red wine leapt from the coffee table, escaped the agonised clutches of the Soulmate to jarr sploshily against my outstretched hands, and deposit its contents in a graceful patter of astonishing area all over the sofa (ecru) and the carpet (cream). A moment of aghast silence and we sprang to our feet shouting and pushing and grabbing for cloths and sponges and carpet cleaner full of bleach, and generally getting in eachothers' way and inhibiting all useful action. After a couple of minutes of frenzied swearing and scrubbing, the Soulmate detached himself from the madness and turned to our saviour in times of spillage, www.ehow.com. Within moments he was knowledgeably rubbing salt into the stains and concocting some evil brew involving Sarsons' and White Wine Vinegar, and dabbing same onto the sofa with a professional flick of the wrist, which I despite my best efforts remain unable to emulate.  I remained sceptical, even after rubbing and dabbing through two episodes of Sex and the City. But although the carpet seemed to be rallying, the sofa is sadly marked and now possesses a distinct Eau de Portion of Chips fragrance. Panic. We move in two weeks, we have no money, and the agents will fleece us of our entire damage deposit for this without breaking a sweat. What to do? Glum and grimly certain of approaching penury, we betook ourselves to bed.  But everything looks better in the morning. A newly purposeful Myriadesque got on the phone this morning, and after some fast talking and thinking our wonderful landlord, who, in his great wisdom, bought sofas from IKEA for which tailor-made covers are available, has graciously allowed us to buy the covers and fit them to both sofas (saving us from having to explain away the unfortunate water-stain on the other sofa) for a measly £40 each, without taking anything off our deposit. Wonderful man. Furthermore, there is no red wine to be seen on the carpet, so I am definitely converted to the EHOW way.  A crisis averted. Now all we have to do is move... and not drop any more red wine. From now on we are only allowed to drink it sitting on the kitchen floor or leaning over the sink. Fortunately our new house is wine-proof - all furnished in sensible dark colours and wooden floors... thank heaven.  Is it wine o'clock yet?

      Had a lovely, decadent, European, cultured day yesterday, and have come out of it with a signed copy of Lighthousekeeping, a sunburnt shoulder, a dented credit card and a nice warm feeling of wellbeing.    The fire alarm went off at around 1pm, so we made an executive decision and went out for lunch. Well, we didn't have anything in the house... Sadly I was enjoying my glass of wine too much to notice my shoulder turning a stunning shade of pink - a small price to pay, in my opinion. Then came home, worked all afternoon, and then went to a book reading by Jeanette Winterson, followed by a delicious dinner with The Soulmate at our favourite Greek restaurant.     I've already been asked how the book-signing thing was - Jeanette was really sweet, an interesting speaker. Her reading (the first couple of chapters, slightly more than appears on her  urlLink website ) was lovely to listen to - I think I will hear her as I read, which I haven't before.     I watched an interview with her on the South Bank Show a few weeks ago, which included a reading by her of an excerpt from the Powerbook - it was odd, because I knew the words so well - to hear her read them in her distinct, individual way was a bit of an intrusion. Odd, isn't it? They were her words first! Much more enjoyable listening to her reading 'fresh' words to me. Delightful, in fact, when the words in question are so fresh themselves. I think we take ownership of books we love, after a while.     And of her, too - in the question and answer session afterwards there was the occasional person who seemed to want to fit her into their idea of Jeanette Winterson. Her writing is so passionate that you form a bond with her while reading - strange then to meet a real person, who gets hot and tired at the end of a long day. She seemed amused by the academics who pore over her work and dissect them word by word, and by us, all sitting there breathlessly waiting for her to pronounce on chick-lit, the war, religion... Well, it wasn't that bad, but it could have been. I would tell you what she said... but as Billy Connolly says, you can never remember what it was after the show. She did promise us a 90 minute Channel 4 drama and another play in the near future - original this time, not an adaptation of a book.    And she was wonderful - gracious and funny, dealing very well with the obligatory odd person, and patient with her collapsing microphone stand, which seemed to feel that  it  should be the star of the show. I'm glad a favourite author turned out to be so likeable.

      It’s so good to write freely, my only censor my search for the right words. I can kick off my shoes here, curl up and tell stories with a glass in my hand. Here I disappear into an old red leather armchair, creaky and soft with age, a blanket over my knees and a sheepskin rug at my feet, inches thick. From my glass the spicy, heady smell of whisky rises although in real life I can’t drink it, a sip sets me coughing. Here it is full and thick, the feel of old flames as it goes down. A fire is chatting in the low fireplace, casting playful shadows and spilling warmth onto my face and hands. I could catch the glow in my fingers, let it drip down my arms like wet sand, like syrup with the sun on it. No electric light in this room of mine, we sit in a dusky wavering pool of candlelight and firelight.  Because you are here too, I keep an extra armchair on the other side of the fire for guests. Make yourself comfortable, have a drink if you’d like, I shall want your full attention in a moment. what do you think, do you like it? I don’t suppose it matters, you’re a visitor, a transient guest. You’ll move on within a few clicks. Still I court approval, even from strangers. Especially from strangers, in fact, they are the potential that mean that disapproving acquaintances are replaceable. Approbation on a conveyor belt, instant dismissal once the doubt creeps in. Welcome to the consumerist society.  Still, since you’re here, what would you like to wear? The clothes make the man, my dear. Or woman, whatever and whoever you want to be is determined by your choice of costume. Choose hunting boots and I shall be Elizabeth Bennet to your Darcy. Pick out a kimono and you’re Madame Butterfly, with me as the cowardly husband. Only have a care. A frost-encrusted pair of gloves can lead to Scott’s fate as easily as to Amundsen’s. Would you adjust that bright silk sash over there with such particular interest, if another five minutes would see you hurling yourself under the King’s horse at the Derby as Emily Davidson rather than standing on a soapbox in Hyde Park as Mrs Pankhurst? Why do your fingers linger over jewelled sceptres and tablets of heavy stone, over thick robes and much-decorated military uniforms, while scorning notched swords whose blades have grown dim on the whetstone, the torn cap of a corporal, the battered breastplate of a centurion? Who says all heroes have management roles anyhow?  Well make your choice, kid, or I’ll make it for you.  Aha, a chancer. I thought I saw the glint of the gambler in your eye. Very well, I am to have the choosing. But you must accept the consequences. I make no guarantees of your safe return once we’ve begun. And you must make the move, start the game, give the snowball its first push down the hill.  Go ahead.   click.

      Well, we have a shiny new house. I live in a proper residential street, for the first time in two years, and am the custodian of stairs for the first time ever. I also have a shiny new job, which has been the main reason for my silence. My mission to get rid of the evil credit cards unfortunately necessitates working a 50-hour week.  We're mourning the loss of our lovely little flat, though, just a little bit. For one thing, we really didn't realise quite how much stuff we had squeezed into those big beautiful built-in cupboards in the living room... and for another, the house feels a bit unwieldy at the moment. We lack certain essential bits of furniture, and I, for one, definitely lack money. In every room there is a niggling pile of boxes waiting to be unpacked into the furniture that, as yet, remains unbought... and bitty but vital things infest every flat surface, including the floor (frankly I have never known anyone with so many bitty but vital things as The Soulmate, and a lot of his vital floor-lurkers are also sharp and pointy - eek).  But on the upside, we only need a few things to get it all straight. The living room will look beautiful with some pictures on the walls, and a rug on the floor. A dining table will work wonders in the front room, and the blast site in which I currently sit, which eventually will be our office, is likely at some point to enjoy the dubious improvement of one of those Swedish collections of shelving and drawers that cover the whole wall, complete with drawers specifically for all those bitty, sharp and pointy things.  The Soulmate is away working hard almost every day at the moment, including this weekend. I was going to spend it in the garden, taming the wilderness, but apparently in weather terms we've had summer, it was last week while I was sweating under immaculate make-up in an office. As of yesterday it seems we have regressed to March. So, I shall do the washing, drink lots of tea, and possibly unpack all my notebooks.

      It's moving day, finally, and of course having had days and days off to prepare, I'm not packed. And, of course, there are about ten thousand things, roughly, that won't fit in a box and for which I have no bags left.  An illustration of the other problem I often encounter at about this time is this; having heroically struggled for twenty minutes yesterday to fit all our clothes into one mammoth suitcase, four boxes and a huge holdall, I then stumbled wearily into the other room of our two-room flat to see two airers full of smug washed clothes, which I had washed and hung out earlier and had then utterly forgotten about. Murphy's Law of Packing Your House Up - for every given category of possession you pack and seek to keep contained, there will always be a few escapees, renegades who lurk in corners until you have taped down the box or broken a nail trying to do up a zip while sitting on the bag, and then suddenly leap triumphantly into view, and sit smugly masquerading as inanimate objects who cannot bear any fault of their own, but whose motives you know are deeply suspect.  Hate it. Hate it. At this point, I have decided that while I have an aversion to packing up, I really don't mind unpacking and finding homes for things. This will last until ten minutes after I start unpacking at the other end, I imagine.

      A long silence, for no good reason other than logistics - i had no computer. Now I have a shiny new one, to go with my shiny new house, which finally is warming up and feeling like home.  We've been here nearly two months now - a difficult month or so at the beginning, with the Soulmate away working all the time and me all alone rattling round in this house with neither pictures on the walls nor rugs on the floor.  Funny how the lack of a safe place to go home makes life so much harder - I found it hard to cope with work, felt depressed... so we took a week off together and bought furniture and unpacked a bit. It has helped immensely. In fact I'd say we were better friends for it - this was a house full of tension and niggly people for a while.  Anyway just wanted to break the silence. It's like anything, the longer the break the bigger the build-up, and the better you feel your comeback should be... so I just decided to get on here and write this, straggly and unlovely though it may be, just to get going again. I shall go, now, and collect myself in order to write something more meaningful and intelligent next time. Wine may help with that, I think....

      Snatching five minutes to write this. I am so jealous of my thinking-space... The worst thing about the nine-to-five is the lack of time to THINK... especially when what you do all day isn't what you think of as your 'real work'. I come home exhausted, no energy being pleasant company for the Soulmate, or for writing. I have a million ideas a day, but no time to use them, and then I get home and exhaustion has driven them all from my head. I really believe the quote from Leo Tolstoy which goes; 'The changes in our life must come from the impossibility to live otherwise than according to the demands of our conscience ... not from our mental resolution to try a new form of life.' Despite this, I think sometimes you have to put your foot down, to stop yourself being too lazy to make a change. Left to its own devices my lazier self would happily go on eating in front of the TV and staying slumped on the sofa watching American television until tiredness forces me up to bed. However, I have decided to find some discipline from somewhere, and change things. I'll get up for an hour or so of thought and reading before work, and only watch the television if there is something on which meets the standards I would set for a book or a film at the cinema. Today I have also dutifully drunk more water and had fruit for lunch... before being seduced by a chocolate cookie. Ah well, too much healthy living is bad for the personality....
