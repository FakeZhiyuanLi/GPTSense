      Ok, so everyone has brainfarts sometimes.  Sorry to all of you who tried posting on this blog but couldn't.  I was stupid and accidentally set it up where you could only post if you were a member of the site which publishes my blog.  My sister alerted this to me a few days ago, and I have finally got around to fixing it.  Sorry again.  And Jen, it's not something I really want to talk about right now.

      I have a little advice to a few of my friends out there, who should know who they are. You guys have found something that is hard to find. I know, I started looking too early and have landed myself in a strange situation. Try to hold on to what you've got. It's great while it lasts, but it's only fleeting. As far as I can see, it works out for you. I'm holding out hope that something will work out for me, too, but that hope is fading fast.  Carpe diem -  seize the day.

      Ok, pretty soon I'm gonna have to stop with all the bible references because my friends will treat me like I'm some sort of evangelist.  No actually, this one was a really bad pun.  I officially got my first job today, working as a Service Clerk at Walgreens for $7.30 an hour.  Not bad, but I'll end up only working like 21 hours a week, so I'm not exactly rolling in the money.  Plus I have to wear a tie all the time to work.  Ugh.  I hate ties.  Hey, Sara, I want to thank you again for talking with me last night.  I was in one of my pensive moods again, so thanks for dealing with me and my prying questions.  I'm here for you if you ever need a return of the favor.  Joey, we need to pummel Anthony when he gets back from South Carolina, because of his stupid post on his blog.  But I got him with my comment.  We need to make him realize how bad the White Sucks - I mean White  Sox  - really are. (Lol, j/k Anthony)  See ya later all  John

       Hey all of you out there who know me and all of you who don't (though I can't imagine why you would be here), welcome to my new blog.  I got this idea from Anthony, so I'm not sure how it's going to work, I'm not accustomed to writing about myself (just talking, and besides, we're talking about Anthony's idea here).  For all of you who don't know me, I'm John, and I call myself the giant genius because of my tall stature and annoying ability to retain useless knowledge to impress my friends and teachers.  (Those of you who know me, you know what I'm talking about).      Today I just kinda chilled at my friend Joey's house.   Anthony was over too (his blog is   urlLink  here    for all of you who want to see it).  No matter what they say, I kicked both their asses in every game we played (especially Joey's ass).  Well, maybe that's a little fib.  Ok, a big fib.  But I did win in Monopoly (now I really need a life).  I also had band tonight, which is fun, if blowing your brains through your mouth is your idea of fun. Lol j/k I have a blast with band.  I saw Sean and Jen there too.  So really, my only friend I didn't see today was Sara, which is kinda ok, since I went to her house last night and watched Braveheart, but I still like seeing all my friends in a day.  Plus I enjoy hanging out with Sara, cause I she cheers me up when I'm down.      I'm really kinda sick of the whole thing going on between Sara and Joey.  Both of them kinda use me as a person to talk to, mainly Sara, cause Joey's got Heather and Anthony, and the rest of Sara's friends familiar with the situation include me, Sean (to a lesser extent), and Jen, who's on Joey's side due to Anthony being on Joey's side.  Really, in my opinion, the whole thing is a misunderstanding.  If Sara would just deal with Joey's limited perspective (because it is limited Joe, when your girlfriend is involved), and Joey would realize that Sara and Heather have come to an understanding already, then we would all be much better off.  But maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I'm just trying to clear everything up.      So, that's it for my first post.  I hope I don't stir up to much animosity (sorry to all of you I've ticked off).  Please post your comments.  I'll talk to you all later.  School starts in 9 days.  Yeehah. Time to finish my Huck Finn Project (oh, goodie...)
