        At 2:25 AM, Bigandmean said…  Jen, I know you love the theater. I have an idea for a screen play. Maybe Broadway too, like Mel Brooks in the Producers. ALa71 and I have planned over on her blog to invade France. We know how easy it'll be so I'm taking Paris by myself, she'll take care of Cannes and the South of France. I think we can recruit Rose and Rhea. They'll have the toughest job. They'll be in charge of education. You'll hold the cabinet position of fashion commissioner.  Wardrobe: I'm wearing jeans and boots and a big ole John Wayne hat. You, Ala71, Rhea and Rose will be wearing black matching leather outfits and look like those Charley's Angels girls, leaping up and down and making martial arts sounds.  The French women will be wearing berets, striped shirts and short skirts. The French men will be wearing berets, striped shirts and short skirts.   Scene I - The French will be caught completely by surprise when I invade Paris. They will all be riding around on bicycles, eating cheese and saying bonjour a lot. They say Wee Wee a lot too. When they find out that I'm invading and declaring myself emperor for life they go wee wee a lot.  The French break out in a spontaneous chorus from "Le Miserables". "Do you hear the la, la, la, la, la,.... it is the sound of angry men wearing tight skirts". When they finish the first verse they immediately surrender and begin speaking perfect English.   ALa71 reports in and she has all of Cannes and The South of France locked up. They're in a prison called "le abu gruib la Bare". She's having Michael Moore stand in front of them naked until they talk. They spill their guts. So does Michael Moore.  Rose and Rhea report that they are having a hard time teaching the French any common sense. The French can be so stubborn. And little. Rose and Rhea try to explain to them that they will all have to work and that the welfare state is a dead pressed duck under glass. No work, no pay and certainly no more snails and goose liver. The french don't understand the relationship between work and reward. Gene Hackman makes a guest appearance and announces that there is just no french connection.  Scene Two begins with me walking the grounds of the palace followed by several frenchmen carrying little buckets just in case I..... well you know. It's good to be the King!!!  What do you think so far? Hello Broadway? Are we talking the Great White Way?

      Ala71 rules.    Friday, July 30, 2004 What I Have Learned From the Left -"Crystal Clear"   1. The first rule is to question everything that the President does –even in a time or war. It is our duty in a democracy and it is unpatriotic not to do so –especially in a time of war. If the ‘other side’ says that we are aiding and abetting the enemy –we scream ‘foul’ and claim that they are contesting our constitutional guarantee of dissent.  2. The second rule is ALWAYS distrust the motives of the President –it’s a personal check and balance that keeps us safer.   3. We must always criticize the economy –regardless of what the numbers show. It is unpatriotic to assume that ‘America can’t be better’. It would dishonor those killed on 9/11 not to expect more of our leaders.   4. We must always remember the economic horn of plenty that Clinton provided-don’t let anyone imply this was a tech bubble; and reject the idea of the Clinton/Gore recession in 2000-2001 because they can not be blamed that a tech bubble burst.   5. You can cover all political bases by voting for a war, but then criticizing it later. This is an important rule as you will always have two sides to stand on regardless of the crowd that you are addressing. The hawks will respect you for voting for it, and the doves will love you for protesting against it.   6. If your constituents are mad that you voted for the war just vote against the funding of the war. To avoid people saying that you are hurting the troops, claim that the bill was worded wrong and that you didn’t want to give the President a ‘blank check’. When all else fails continue to evoke the evils of the President.   7. Attempt to discredit everyone in the current Administration even if some were appointed by your political allies. When they are correct –take credit. If they mess up –cut them and run and blame the Administration for keeping him too long.   8. Use any minor infraction to discredit the opposition. Try not to belittle the soldiers, because the American people won’t like that but the Administration is fair game. If you discover people putting underwear on someone else’s head or treating a prisoner in any way less than would be expected at the Waldorf Astoria, report ‘wide-spread torture’ and keep using the word ‘atrocity’. While you are at it –bring impeachment charges against the President just incase he wins a second term-start proceeding immediately. Downplay any horror committed by the opposition as retaliation for the war in general.   9. Do not let them use Nick Berg / Paul Johnson as a diversion to any news here at home –dwelling on these deaths may remind the people what we are fighting for and there is a possibility they may rally behind the President.   10. Constantly remind your constituents of all the awful things that America has done –never let them de-humanize the enemy or label them as ‘terrorists’ because they will relate it to 9/11 and may rally behind this corrupt administration. Remind them that we have done terrible things to African Americans and the Japanese and that we are not superior to anyone-reiterate cultural tolerance (Maybe even quote one of the 'nice' verses from the Koran).   11. Don’t let America forget that we too have bombed things and killed innocent civilians and that the opposition in the Middle East are just young freedom fighters who strongly believe in what they are fighting for …didn’t we kill the British when we felt that they were invading our land.   This is what I have learned in the past two weeks in my conversations with liberals on these blogs. It is wrong for me to have a flag or a yellow ribbon because that is implying that Republicans own Patriotism and that those who don’t want to fly the flag somehow love the country less than I do. I should be more worried about protecting a person’s right to borrow 'Tthe Anarchist Cookbook' from the library, and having it be kept private, than the security of my homeland –because that is the premise my homeland was built on. I should never insinuate that we should feel funny if 5 Muslim men -in there 20s- all get on my plane reading the Koran... because that would be racial profiling and lots of Muslims love the West and if we go down that road they may all end up in interment camps. The other side can accuse the president of every atrocity known to man, but I can question nothing about John Kerry because he served in Vietnam…   Does everyone know that…John Kerry was on a swift boat in Vietnam?  posted by ALa71 @ 5:35 PM

      I believe that in order to join in on a political debate, you must do your research. I cleared my evening and tore myself away from the “Blog that ate my brain” in order to watch and report on the “boneless, skinless, boiled chicken convention”. Am I calling the Dems poultry? Nay, my happy little flowers. I am calling the convention bland. Homogenized. Fat free. Flavor free. Like boiled chicken. I want someone to run up to the podium with a mighty Dean “YAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!”. Alas, other than the all too brief interlude with Reverend Sharpton, I have been disappointed thus far.  So, for those of my dear, fellow Republicans who opted out of watching, allow me to relay my experiences. I poured myself a fabulous glass of wine, grabbed pen and paper in case something struck me for the blog, put on my fuzzy bunny slippers, and settled in to a comfy chair to watch this one-term senator make his case that he’s a bad-ass.  Cute family. Daughter intros. Edwards walks out, hair nice and shiny.  Internal dialogue  – ooooo!!!! Shiiiiiiny. I like shiny things. I write down the word “Shiny”.  Thunderous applause. Dems go crazy. I take a sip of wine.  "Where I come from, you don't judge someone's values based on how they use that word in a political ad. You judge their values based upon what they've spent their life doing,"  Internal dialogue  – uhmm…Ewwwww. Trial lawyer. Ewwww. I raise my glass and toast the poor souls who get screwed with their medical bills because of Trial Lawyers pushing up costs of medicine through their frivolous lawsuits (and before you ninnies start screeching, I know some of them are valid, but I’m anti-ambulance chaser!)  blah blah blah   Internal dialogue  – Southern accents are fun. I take a sip of wine, mesmerized by the Carolina lilt. I write down accent and draw some hearts.  blah blah blah “Two Americas” blah blah.  Internal dialogue  – I thought there were three – North, South and Central. I drink a toast to all three. Steve Martin pops in to my head saying “I was born a poor black child” from the movie “The Jerk”. Hmm. I need to watch that again. I giggle, and take another sip. I write down “Three Americas”.  blah blah blah I write down his parents are cute. I drink a toast to them. I can’t imagine how cool of a moment it must be for them. I drink a second toast to Mom and Dad Edwards.  "So when a man volunteers to serve his country, a man volunteers and puts his life on the line for others, that's a man who represents real American values."  Internal dialogue  – Huh? Did Edwards go to war? Hmm. Confused. I write down soldier and some question marks. I start to take a sip of wine. Hmmm, Empty. Where’s that bottle.    blah blah blah “Hope is on the way”  Internal dialogue  – Why are they chanting? Hope? Who is Hope. Is she the next speaker? I find the bottle, lose the glass, write down “Who the hell is Hope”.  "You cannot run. You cannot hide. We will destroy you."  Internal dialogue  - Terrorism! Yes!!!! Kick all their asses!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I take a swig from the bottle. Dubya, is that you? I write down I heart Dubya. Three times.   “Between now and November, you, the American people, you can reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past."  Internal dialogue  – Woo-hoo!!!!!! They’re finally putting Ted Kennedy out to pasture????  Rock on Shiny Hair! Rock on!!!!!  I take another hit off the bottle, and lose my pen.   Me - Honnneeeeeeeey?!?!?!?!?!  him - WHAT! Me - I need a pen!  him – WHY!!!! me – For the greater good! him – HUH? Me – I like shiny hair!!!! Him – HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND????? Me – The BLAHHHHG! For the BLAHHHHHG! him – mutters…efffing blog…WELL GET ONE FROM THE DESK!!!! Me - I can’t.  Him - WHY!  Me - Because I have no legs.  Him - ARE YOU DRUNK?!?!?!?!??!?!??!

      Since I believe BigandMean is the smartest, most handsome man on the planet, I must repost this as it's own topic. Does it have anything to do with the nice compliments he paid me? Perhaps. :)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   At 2:19 AM, Bigandmean said…   Lefty, Yes, we've had massive government spending since 9-11. Increased security, victims compensation, ad-nauseum administrative costs for hearings such as the 9-11 Commission, and a WAR. Like it or not we are at war. Wars (I feel silly explaining this to you) cost lots of money.   Maybe I have to explain this to you because although your light is on nobodies' home. Or is it that you're a few fries short of a Happy Meal. Or not the sharpest tool.......never mind, that's the one you used on MrMalcolm. But hey! Just kidding!  Not only are we at war and trying to pay for all the costs associated with it, we have also had to replace a good portion of our equipment and armament because they were so ignored and depleted in the 90's.   The Republicans have fed at the Federal trough once they gained power, almost as much as the Democrats do. No politicians that I have seen, other than maybe the Govenator in California, has had the guts to say no to their constituancies plans to raid the coffers once they have the chance. The Democrats though, have created an entire underclass that is dependant upon government largesse and repays the Democrats with votes. They will always remain dependant unless they abandon the plantation mentality that the Democrats have so successfully shackeled them with for so long.  On another note Lefty, Jen tells me you're an OK guy. I'd believe anything she says so you must be OK. I've read everything Jen has written as far as I know and I think she is brilliant. Her parents must be very proud.  And MrMalcolm, what was it with that "bite me" stuff. Are you serious or were you just flirting? Behave now. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      First, the new...  To my fellow republicans - if you have not seen this video going around in email-world yet, check it out immediately - http://www.republicangear.com/ It brought tears to my eyes. I love that Josh Groban song.  And The old (well, old in that it was written yesterday) I keep going back to re-read this comment from BigandMean. In case you missed it, here is part of it. I think it's fantastic.  At 8:38 PM, Bigandmean said… Conservatives, in general, are hard-working decent people who value home, family, God and country. We distain the political kooks on the far right as much as we distain those on the left. We realize that having a dialogue is healthy for a democracy and that there are two sides to every argument and that people who disagree with us may be as well meaning as we are. We believe that our country has benefitted from both conservative and liberal philosophy and that neither side has a monopoly on virtue. We are usually too involved with our jobs, families and churches to get very much involved with politics until the presidential election comes along. We hunt and fish. We love sports, especially football, but don't care a thing about soccer or the Tour-De-France. We obey the law and respect law enforcement personnel. We know that some law officers abuse their power and should be punishied when they do. We don't ask for govenment help and have a strong belief in self-reliance and taking care of our own. We believe that abortion should be regulated and not available on demand as a birth control device. We believe that the govenment should not pay for abortions nor use the tax money of those who oppose abortion to fund it. We believe in a strong defense. We believe that a strong defense is a deterent to future 9-11s and Pearl Harbors. We believe that the First Amendment was intended to protect religion from government rather than the other way around. We do not believe that the govenment should be subserviant to religious interests and should remain independant of it. We believe strongly in volunteerism, and that we can do things better ourselves rather than get the govenment involved. We believe that someone living in public housing who complains that the government has been too slow to clean the trash from her yard or paint his walls is in serious need of re-education. We have a frontier like mentality that mirrors our independance. We are tough physically, mentally and emotionally - just like our frontier ancestors were. We accept the judicial process even though we may not always agree with the results. We don't agree with Roe vs. Wade but we accept it as the law of the land. Whining about a lost election four years after the fact by clinging to an unrealistic claim seems childish and immature to us. We believe that former presidents should refrain from publicly critcizing sitting ones and to do otherwise is crass and disrespectful of the office. We prefer the approach in this regard to that of Bush I and Reagan, rather than the political pot-shots lobbed at Bush II by Carter and Clinton. We think that Clinton was immoral and that the president, while not infallible, should show some semblence of morality. We believe that having oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office is obsene and shameful. Lying about it on national televion is not good either. We believe that theft of top secret government documents from the National Archives, followed by the failure to return all that were taken is criminal. We believe that no matter what the politcs of a person who may have done such a thing, a complete investigation should be demanded and completed, not stone-walled. We don't believe that the Attorney General has done anything wrong by investigating this incident for the past 9 months without public comment. We don't believe that all liberals hate our troops but that they are often insensitive and disrespectful to those who serve and their families.  We do not hate liberals but love and respect them as fellow Americans with many of the same wants, needs and values that we have. We are self-disciplined to the extent that we try to refrain from name calling and vitriol comments. We are imperfect and make mistakes but we mean well.  That's who we are. Do you think it is possible to have political discourse with people who define themselves in this manner? If not , then you may continue to call us insane liars, etc., without objection from us. We are too busy living life, volunteering, going to church, caring for our families and taking care of our careers to spend any time arguing with you to the contrary. Here's hoping we can have an honest dialogue without the emotional name calling.

      By Special Guest, "Bigandmean"  The Dems hollered censorship when thousands of former Dixie Chicks fans threw away their records and refused to buy any more of their music. Censorship is actually government action, and of course, when private citizens make choices for whatever reason, that is not censorship. Neither is it censorship when a private corporation, such as USA Today makes a choice as it did by refusing to run Ann Coulter's column. It was obvious as to why thousands of citizens took the action they did in the Dixie Chicks matter - they disagreed with the DC's politics and weren't interested in supporting them. USA Today did the same thing. They disagreed with Ann Coulter's politics and weren't interested in supporting her. The only problem here is that USA Today, a national newspaper, is pretending to be fair and balanced but still wants to reserve the right to edit Ann's column if they disagree with it's political content. Their hypocracy has reached new heights. Why not publish the article and let the public decide?  As to her style, most of us "get it" when she calls the Democratic delegates the Spawn of Satan. She's kidding, making fun, not really serious and maybe a little over the top. I wouldn't use such terms to refer to those assholes but everyone has his own style.

      I know this will get your motor running Ala71. Can't wait to read your reaction.  So brace yourselves, and delve in to the mind of a Left-winger. It's a scary place.   This is from Davesplash's blog, part of a post titled 7.26.2004 Taking the cat to the vet and other exciting events  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- From At 10:26 AM, DaveSplash said… Been watching the Democratic National convention tonight.  President Carter just finished speaking a few minutes ago.  Al Gore was on earlier, and President Clinton will be up in a little while.  I have never been so convinced in my political convictions before in my life.  John Kerry HAS to win.  This country simply cannot take four more years of W.  The Republicans are VERY afraid of losing, and it is beginning to show.  Fox News Channel (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican party) didn't even air the Gore speech.  Hmmmm, didn't want to remind the viewers of who actually won 4 years ago?  Also, the right-wing media (in addition to Fox) is getting increasingly nasty.  Right-wing wack-job Ann Coulter in her column today called the Dems convention the "spawns of Satan" convention -- and which side is slanderous?  USA Today correctly refused to run the column, but, of course, a far-right fringe website called 'human events' ran it.      Coulter is a perfect example of conservatives in America: dishonest, slanderous, paranoid, violent, morally bankrupt, divisive, and completely insane!  The Republicans have gone so far to the right that it is truly frightening in some parts of the country. I am one of those people that wants to believe that all Americans are on the same side.  We may have different ideas about how to deal with our nation's problems, but we all have the same goal.  I have begun to question whether people on the right share that view.  Their vitriol has gotten so extreme that I am starting to believe we may be becoming a Balkan-ized type of country.  When people like Sean Hannity (of Fox News of course) can publish a book that on it's cover says the two biggest threats to America are terrorism and liberalism, I have to question the motives of those on the right.  Right wing radio host Neal Boortz said on his show last Friday that people who would vote for John Kerry are a bigger threat to America than Al-queda!  What sort of person could actually believe such crap.  I don't think I share the same values as those two (just two of the many), and the millions of people who buy their books, listen to their radio shows, and watch them on TV.  Liberals get a little animated sometimes, and occasionally cross the line, but no one in the mainstream of the Democratic Party would ever say that republicans are as dangerous as terrorists.  That is unacceptable rhetoric, and I have not heard a single prominent, or even obscure, conservative condemn Hannity, Limbaugh, O'reilly, Coulter, Boortz, Michael Savage, or any of the so-called news reports on Fox.   Don't be fooled, the negative tone in politics did not begin recently.  These far-right lunatics began in 1992, and have never stopped.  We were forced to hear their garbage about Bill Clinton for eight years, and the right has only gotten more negative.     I gotta go.  Clinton is on in a few minutes, and I don't want to miss it.  Makes me nostalgic for better times.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm....speechless.

      Punkin' on dems in a place called Beantown  The first kick she gave was when she hit the ground   Banned from the USA (paper)  Anne was banned from the USA (paper)   Here's excerpts from the contraband Coulter article. I feel so frisky all of a sudden.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- excerpts from PUT THE SPEAKERS IN A CAGE Posted: July 26, 2004 4:15 p.m. Eastern By Ann Coulter -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- © 2004 WorldNetDaily.com    ...As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the U.N. Security Council's approval. Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie-chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention.   ...Apparently, the nuts at the Democratic National Convention are going to be put in cages outside the convention hall. Sadly, they won't be fighting to the death as is done in W.W.F. caged matches. They're calling this the "protestor's area," although I suppose a better name would be the "truth-free zone."   ...I thought this was a great idea until I realized the "nut" category did not include Sharpton, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and Teddy Kennedy – all featured speakers at the convention. I'd say the actual policy is only untelegenic nuts get the cages, but little Dennis Kucinich is speaking at the Convention, too. So it must be cages for "nuts who have not run for president as serious candidates for the Democratic Party."   ...Looking at the line-up of speakers at the Convention, I have developed the 7-11 challenge: I will quit making fun of, for example, Dennis Kucinich, if he can prove he can run a 7-11 properly for 8 hours. We'll even let him have an hour or so of preparation before we open up. Within 8 hours, the money will be gone, the store will be empty, and he'll be explaining how three 11-year olds came in and asked for the money and he gave it to them.   ...Walking back from the convention site, I chatted with a normal Bostonian for several blocks – who must have identified me through our covert system of signals. He was mostly bemused by the Democrats' primetime speakers and told me he used to be an independent, but for the last 20 years found himself voting mostly Republican. Then he corrected himself and said he votes for the "American."   ...I'd say I love all these Democrats in Boston so much I want them to go home, but I don't. I want Americans to get a good long look at the French Party and keep the 7-11 challenge in mind.

      ....on the Dem convention.  This morning I heard on the radio that John "I am just a poor conservative farm boy even though I'm a leftist hippy billionare" Kerry's press passes have some sort of Rolls Royce logo on them. HA. For the little people my ass. The radio host was talking about the "spin" that the Kerry spokesperson put on it. It went something like this:  "...uhm...yeah...so...like...it's like, you know, a like...uhm...comment....on you know...how uhm....Bush's tax cuts...were...uhm....like for the rich....so uhm...like...we used that...uhm....symbol...to like...uhm...show that and uhm....like...the staffer that...uhm....put that together...like...had no ones...uhm...permission, yeah permission....to do that....but it wasn't like...uhm...because Kerry's loaded....because he's not, I repeat, NOT...it's all his flaky...oops! I mean....it's all his wife's...but uhm...yeah...republicans are bad...mmmkay?"

      I've been hooked on zefrank for years. He was responsible for the "How to Dance Properly" email that circulated heavily a couple years ago. I surfed over to his site today, and found this new film.  My fellow Republicans - view this at your own risk. It makes fun of Homeland Security. I was laughing as I watched it, but I also had to fight the urge to throw something.  My dearest Dark Imperial Overload LeftyJones - you will love this.  http://www.zefrank.com/redalert/index_better.html

      This is going to be a hard post to write, because I need to stay vague to protect the innocent (ie…ME) (no laughing allowed scarlotta!).   Through my job I have encountered famous people and their families pretty frequently over the years. I have a thousand hard-to-believe stories about working with them (almost all of those people are insane. Seriously.) but out of fear of my identity being revealed (and of being sued of course) I’ll have to try resist the urge to tattle.   Late last night at the end of my obnoxiously long work day, I began thinking about how or if I could begin talking about my job adventures, without giving away too much. I think if I keep it simple, I can get away with it.  I have some favorite stories from over the years.  The Political Sort – working with secret service agents to enable “first daughters’ to see live music, and a former “first couple” to enjoy a night at the theater several times over the years. I still have business cards from the agents I worked with. That was so darn cool. The last one I dealt with opened up about the Clinton years. Boy was that interesting. She told me that all the agents she knew were thrilled to have the Bush's back in the white house. The Clinton's apparently treated them with contempt and like servants, for the most part. No big surprise there.   Actor related – watching Jerry Lewis goof around with a police officer backstage while Jerry was touring in a musical (they were play fighting, it ended with Jerry "arresting" the cop, and then he heard his cue, and scampered back to the audience, back in character. I was amazed.).   Musician related – I don't even know where to start with them. In fact, maybe it's because I'm exhausted, but pretty much every story that is popping in to my head is a tabloid friendly one involving drugs, prostitutes, toilet seat phobias or green M and M's.   But what prompted me to want to write this post today was a wonderful encounter I had Friday night.   One of my employees came in to my office and told me that JP Richardson was on the phone for me. Who is JP Richardson, you may be asking yourself? Be patient, my flowers.   I had this terrific conversation with this funny man with the familiar voice. It was driving me nuts. I knew I should know him. We were talking about how he is close friends with Hank Williams Jr, so I thought he must be a musician.   And then BAM! It came to me!!!!  JP Richardson Senior was from Beaumont, Texas. His stage nickname was "The Big Bopper". He was killed along with Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens in that terrible plane crash.  Here's a clip from JP Senior's (known as "Jape") biography on Jr's website:  Throughout '58, Jape signed onto many tours to promote his record. His last tour being the Winter Dance Party of 1959. The tour was scheduled to play in remote locations throughout mid-west United States, and the mid-west was suffering a harsh winter. The bus provided to the musicians had engine problems and no heating system. For this last reason Jape had caught the flu. When the tour rolled into Clear Lake Iowa, Buddy Holly chartered a plane to fly his band to the next gig. Jape approached Buddy's bass player, Waylon Jennings, and asked for Jennings seat on the plane, so that Jape could get some rest and a doctors appointment. Waylon agreed and gave his seat to Jape, a decision that saved him, but killed the Bopper. Waylon would feel guilty for this for some time. The plane took off from Mason City Airport around 1:00 the morning of February 3rd, 1959, and crashed 8 miles after takeoff, killing Jape, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the pilot Roger Peterson. At the time of his death, Jape was 28 years old. His wife, Adrian, was pregnant with their second child. Jay P. Richardson would be born 84 days after his father's death. Jape's body was flown back to Beaumont by private plane. After his funeral the streets were lined with fans watching the long procession of cars moving to the cemetery.  So I am having this conversation with JP Junior and it dawns on me who it is. I was raised on JP Senior's song "Chantilly lace".....Heeeeeellloooo BAAAAAAAAAY-BEH!!! Chantilly lace and a pretty face and a pony tale, hangin' down.... JP Junior sounds just like his Daddy. During this great conversation, he asked me if I knew who his Daddy was, so I gave him my best Hellllllooooo BAAAAAAAAAY-BEH and he started laughing (I am always told I sound really young on the phone). Gosh it was fun talking to him. It turns out he even has recorded a cd, ala Natalie and Nat King Cole, with a lot of his father's music. JP junior sent me signed, personalized photo and cd. I absolutely spazzed.   Why did I spaz?  I can't even remember the last time I actually enjoyed an encounter with a famous person or a family member of a famous person. Over the years, when you do what I do, it is easy to become jaded and cynical about famous or related-to-famous people. It was just......the coolest moment. I flashed back to child-hood memories with my  Daddy singing that Big Bopper song...I can't wait until Dad gets back from Florida so that I can tell him about it.

      1. Change title of blog from “Think like me” to “Liberals for Bush”   2. &nbsp;Place the following bumper stickers all over your brand spankin’ new SUV (complete with gun rack of course) &nbsp;“Flush the Johns” , “I heart Halliburton”, “Dubya Reloaded 2004”,&nbsp;&nbsp;“10 out of 10 terrorists agree, anybody but Bush”, “PETA – People for the edible treatment of animals”, and last but not least, “Even on drugs…Rush is right.”   3. Seek and destroy Ben and Jerry’s “Pants on fire” Bush effigy so that a certain republican may once again enjoy her beloved “half-baked” ice cream in peace.   4. A quote from the divine Ala71…”5 simple words: I will vote for Bush.    &nbsp;  And number five……………a SHRUBBERY! (and if you know that reference, you may eliminate the bumper sticker of your choice)

      Bless your heart dponce80. You really are a good sport.  &nbsp;  What began as a heated political debate under the thread “a reply” has morphed in to a lesson in “Texas Tall Tales”. &nbsp;Before I post part of the conversation, here’s the deal with the “Triple T”. The thing that makes them great is that there is always just enough truth in them to make you think the whole thing might be true.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So please allow me to&nbsp;set the scene.   -dponce80 and BigandMean debate politics, disagree, find common ground, make friends  &nbsp;  -BigandMean invites dponce80 to Texas, and several other Texans jump in and also extend an invitation.  &nbsp;  -dponce mentions he has always wanted to visit Texas, and that he has heard of a steak house&nbsp;where if you finish a giant steak you eat for&nbsp;free.&nbsp;The Texans confirm it is true.  &nbsp;  I'll put dponce in bold. His reaction is&nbsp;truly, as we say here,&nbsp; a hoot.     The stage is set, so let the stories begin and the bullshit fly…       ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  4:30 PM ,  urlLink Bigandmean  said…  Hey dponce,We do have that steak thing that you mentioned. To get it free, you have to eat a 5 pound sirloin in one hour. I'm 6"8" tall and weigh 310 so it's not a problem for me. I try to make it once a week but I have to go in disguise because they've banned me from most of the local restaurants. It's not easy going in disguise when you're my size.   There is a restaurant in Midland, Texas that has a new twist on this "eat it all and it's free" thing. The customer is locked in a rodeo area with a live cow. All you are given is a butcher knife and a barbeque grill. You have two hours to produce a five pound steak, cook it and eat it on the spot. If you finish on time, it's free. If you don't, you have to pay for the whole cow. They call it "kill it and grill it". So far it's only been done once so I'm itching to give it a shot.   urlLink     ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  7:43 PM ,  urlLink scarlotta62  said…  Once, my family was out at the ranch.

We hung out with those pigs so much I'll swear I think my brother grew a snout! The first cold day that fall we found out the awful truth. Our parents intended to kill and eat Oprah and Porky.

He decided he was a cow. He acted like a cow in every way. He refused to talk anymore, he just mooed. He insisted on sleeping in the barn and wouldn't eat anything except hay and grass. He grazed all day long and insisted on wearing a bell around his neck. This went on for about ten years. We were so poor back in those days on the farm that we all agreed not to tell him the truth earlier because we needed the milk.   urlLink     ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At    2:42 AM   ,   urlLink  dponce80    said…  This is like being in the twilight zone.     &nbsp;   Look, you guys.

      My husband and I have joined the low-carb craze that is sweeping the nation. It was extremely difficult, until I discovered Ben and Jerry's low carb ice cream, "half-baked". It's low-carb cookie dough ice cream. My name is Jennifer,&nbsp; (hello Jennifer) and I am an addict to Ben and Jerry's "half-baked" ice cream. It has been approximately twelve hours, since I last tasted this manna from heavan.   My fellow conservatives, do you find yourselves skipping a Tim Robbins or Susan Surandon movie like I do? I used to admire them. I loved "Shawshank Redemption" and "Bull Durham", but I just can't sit through them anymore. Did you throw away your "Stuart Smally self-help cd" (Al Franken comedy cd)? Mine used to make me laugh. Not anymore. Did you vow never to watch "Yentl" again? Well, maybe that one doesn't count. Yentl sucked.   Though I appreciated some of their earlier work, it was not difficult for me to put any of the "screaming meanies" (those mentioned above plus all the other usual suspects) on my internal boycott list.   But now I have reached a serious delimma.   I just read this artice from the Seattle Post Intelligencer (is it me or is that rather pompous?)through a link on drudge. Here's part of it:    Ben & Jerry's co-founder inflamed by Bush  By CHRIS RODKEYASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER  SPOKANE --     &nbsp;   Call it the burning Bush.     The co-founder of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream is on the road, towing a 12-foot-tall effigy of President Bush with fake flames shooting out of the pants. Ben Cohen believes it is an acceptable way to point out what he calls the president's lies.&nbsp; "In a polite society, you don't go up to a person and look at them in the face and say, 'You're a liar,'" Cohen said Monday in a telephone interview. The Pants on Fire Tour rolled into Spokane on Tuesday.     "We think it's a lot more dignified and there's a lot more decorum to say, 'Excuse me sir, your pants are getting a little warm, don't you think?'" Cohen said. The "PantsOnFire-Mobile" is a trailer pulled behind a car. The Bush character is wearing a flight suit with the words "Mission Accomplished" emblazoned on the back, a reference to the president's declaration that major hostilities had ended in Iraq. An electronic ticker on the front shows what Cohen says are Bush's lies.&nbsp; The head is a rotating cylinder with various Bush facial expressions.     Ben &amp; Jerry's pioneered "mobile promotions," when Cohen and co-founder Jerry Greenfield took an RV across the country and doled out ice cream on a nationwide "scooping tour," in lieu of expensive national advertising. The same concept is at work with the PantsOnFire-Mobile, Cohen said Monday. The project is run by volunteers. Cohen flies to a town to train a crew of drivers, teaching them things like how to crank up the smoke machine. Volunteers come from an Internet organization Cohen founded called TrueMajority.org, which he said has 500,000 members.    Blah blah blah. Blather on. Blather on. There's more to that article. I just don't want it on my site.   I guess my ice cream isn't the only thing that is "half-baked".   *heavy sigh*   I don't want them to have any more of my hard-earned money, but how, oh please tell me how, am I every going to survive??!?!?!

      Laura Ingraham rules.  &nbsp;  I found a link to this on Drudgereport.com...  &nbsp;   Monday, July 19, 2004    Las Vegas Review-Journal     At Aladdin, singer rubs wrong way    urlLink    Linda Ronstadt apparently got what she wanted -- to be 86'd from the Aladdin.  In a bizarre performance notable for its bridge-burning comments, Ronstadt inflamed more than her Aladdin audience on Saturday by taking potshots at Las Vegas and dedicating "Desperado" to "Fahrenheit 9/11" filmmaker Michael Moore.     When her show was over, the Aladdin had her checked out of her room and escorted off the premises.     Many walked out during the show, one concertgoer tossed a cocktail on her poster, others defaced her posters and the box office was "a mob scene" of people seeking refunds, according to an Aladdin spokeswoman.     "It's amazing how ugly it got," said Tyri Squyres, director of public relations at the Aladdin.  Ronstadt was a one-woman heat wave.     Early in the show she told the crowd not to expect her greatest hits and added a snide remark or two about Las Vegas and the Aladdin. Scores of fans filed out when Ronstadt made her dedication to Moore and his controversial political film.     "Our management is incredibly upset," Squyres said. "We're just very disappointed because we hired her for a good evening of entertainment for our guests.     "It was like she came in with a chip on her shoulder," Squyres said.  Ronstadt allowed no meet-and-greets and no photographers.  Squyres said Ronstadt "inaccurately" told the crowd she saw a billboard that promoted a greatest-hits show. Ronstadt's camp had provided and approved all ads, commercials, billboards and news releases, Squyres said.     "To be clear, the Aladdin does not condone the comments made by Ms. Ronstadt," Squyres said by e-mail. "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse her political views. Following her performance she was escorted out of the hotel and immediately checked out of her room. And she will not be welcomed back."     In an interview with the R-J's Mike Weatherford before the show, Ronstadt said with a laugh: "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back."   -----------------------  Alicia, aka Ala71, has a great post on  urlLink http://mobyrebuttal.blogspot.com &nbsp;about values. She compares the "Flush the John's" Hollywood bashfest...errr....I mean fundraiser...to Sean Hannity's Freedom Concert. Quite a startling contrast. Check it out.

      Very interesting comments under the post "A Reply". I look forward to joining in when I get a break at work. Thanks to everyone who has contributed their thoughts.  &nbsp;  WollyBully, I read this Ahnald quote this morning and it made me laugh.  I'm posting this in for you. *grin* &nbsp; "If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... if they don't have the guts, I call them  girlie men ," Schwarzenegger said to the cheering crowd at a mall food court in Ontario.

      I'm addicted to the Iraqi Citizen Blogs. One of my favorites is  http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com/. I've been involved the last couple days in some heated debates on Iraq, America and our military. After reading the "iraq the model" blog today, I decided to let these Iraqis speak for themselves... these are all copied and pasted from "iraq the model" ------------------------ "I think that Bush and Blair are the heroes of democracy, humanity and the war on terror and state terror. It’s possible that some intelligence reports were exaggerated but the result at the end is in the interest of the Iraqi people. Those two men deserve all appreciation and respect.  I can say that there was some exaggeration in the criticism also because Saddam did use chemical weapons against us and against Iran."  Zana sefeen-Iraq.   "Who said there are no WMDs in Iraq? The most dangerous WMD exists and the American troops captured it. It’s the weapon that exterminated five million Iraqis and hundreds of thousands from our neighbors impoverished, detained and tortured. Saddam Hussain is the WMD in Iraq. Isn’t a weapon with such capabilities worth to go for a war to (disarm it)? Saving twenty million people from that weapon, isn’t that worth the effort?"  Hasan Al-Shammari-Baghdad.   "America and the UK have offered the human race the greatest favor ever by toppling the ghoul of Iraq. All the debates and the investigations in these two countries are motivated by political ambitions and jealousy rather than the protection of the country and constitution. Bush and Blair deserve a Noble Prize for peace"  Abdulrahman Al-Alwani-Syria.     "Tony Blair made a decision for which we thank him. He’s the man who rid us of the worst dictator in history. Yes, he did a mistake when he didn’t find chemical weapons but Saddam Hussain is more dangerous from those weapons for the Iraqis and Saddam had the money, the scientists and the programs and if he had remained in power he would’ve continued producing WMDs. A world without Saddam in power is safer"  Abu Mohammed Al-Shammary-Danmark.   If the British and American Intelligence have made a mistake and this mistake lead to the decision of the war on Saddam and liberation of Iraq from the hands of what was probably the worst tyranny ever, then what a wonderful mistake! The truth is, Blair was brave in his decision and defied all difficulties in this decision. How can anyone imagine that this was wrong? They gave us back our lost freedom and dignity"  Fakhelddine Sharif-Iraq. -----------------------  We DID find a weapon of mass destruction. His name is Saddam. And that's the talking point to end all talking points.

      I thought this "comment" was so dang funny that I just had to make this it's own post.  It was in response to my "Reagan Hood, Man in Tights" topic.  &nbsp;     urlLink Wollybully  said...   The reason Junior is speaking for the Dems is because of his and Kerry's common background: Yup, before he got into the "marry a wealthy widow thing", John and was into ballet just like Junior. His maternal grandmother, the Baroness von Stumpt, had little John in tights before he could walk. His little diaper hung so far out of the back of his tights when he tried to dance on his tippy toes that it made him look like the Pilsbury Doughboy. As if that wasn't bad enough, all the other boy dancers were more "impressive" than Little John if you know what I mean (think men in tights). Why do you think they called him Little John? Did I mention what they called his brother Dick? Well, never mind. Anyway, Little John and Junior struck up a long standing friendship when Junior introduced him to citrus fruit. Yes, citrus fruit. John had been so distraught because he remained so "unimpressive" and the extent of his unimpressivenes was always so evident when he suited up for a little Swan Lake action. Junior taught Little John the girly man trick of stuffing a few oranges and grapefruits down the front of the old tutu and voila! No more Little John. Since then, other than committing a few war crimes in Viet Nam and lying about it, things have gone pretty good for John F. Kerry, nee Little John. Out of gratitude for the timely advice given him by Junior many years ago, John insisted tha Junior be invited to speak at the convention. And that's how it all happened, I'll swear.   10:41 PM   &nbsp;  Wollybully, I think I love you.&nbsp; (and what am I so afraid of...) hehehehe

       ....We're men, MANLY men, we're Men in Tights, we're BUTCH....  &nbsp;    Mel Brooks rules.    &nbsp;  I have to say that twice.  &nbsp;      Mel Brooks rules.      &nbsp;  So I just&nbsp;read this article on Reagan Junior, former ballet-dancing-dog-show-hosting-MSNBC- commentating "First son",&nbsp;that really irritated me.&nbsp;Before I dive in, I have nothing against ballet dancers (sometime I will write about dragging my husband to see a ballet once, heavy emphasis on ONCE), dog shows (I&nbsp;appreciate a nice bitch as much as the next person), or anything else.&nbsp;I can't help but find Junior's resume amusing though.  &nbsp;  So back to&nbsp;my beef with Junior...  &nbsp;  Is anyone else mad that he is now using his father's death/disease to further the leftist agenda that his father completely disagreed with (HELLO?!?!? Father of Modern Conservatism!!!!!!). Mike Reagan has said that Junior never even voted for his Dad for President.  &nbsp;  I'll say that again too.  &nbsp;     Junior never voted for his father.     &nbsp;  Now that I think about it, that's ultimately the biggest reason why I despise him. I love my parents so much.&nbsp;My brother and I were so blessed to be born in to our&nbsp;family. I cannot imagine how a person could completely reject the ideals and values instilled upon them by their parents. I'm not saying a person shouldn't think for themselves.&nbsp;I rebelled&nbsp;a little. I thought I was a democrat for about five minutes in college. God help me I even voted for Ann "Helmut head"&nbsp;Richards for Governor&nbsp;(Whew. Feels good to get THAT dirty little secret off my chest.).  &nbsp;  I have heard one theory about Junior - that his parents were so deeply in love that they never saw another person in the room, and because of this great love between them there was little love or time left for the kids. I hope that's not the case. Even though I'm irritated with him, I can't help but feel a little sorry for him   if   that's what happened to him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But dang. Speaking at the dem convention!??!?! Why not just drive by your father's library and shoot the finger at it.&nbsp;It would have the same&nbsp;effect (effect? affect? I always confuse those).  &nbsp;  I'll post&nbsp;most of the article that got me all fired up. It's by Steven Milloy.  &nbsp;      "Reagan told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the speech was intended "to educate people about stem cell research" rather than be critical of President George Bush. But the Kerry campaign seems to want to scare people by having the son of the revered late President Ronald Reagan decry President Bush and his pro-life supporters as the major roadblocks to a host of supposedly just-around-the-corner miracle cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and other dreaded diseases.         It will be a junk science-fueled spectacle.       The controversy centers around the use of stem cells derived from destroyed human embryos. So-called "embryonic stem cells"     give rise to all other cells and tissues in the human body and have been touted as possibly yielding treatments for a variety of diseases.      &nbsp;    Moral concerns over the destruction of human embryos caused President Bush to limit taxpayer funding for embryonic stem cell research to stem cell lines already in existence. Researchers who were counting on taxpayer funding to conduct research on embryonic stem cells  and then rake in millions of dollars from naive investors&nbsp;     were enraged and began a campaign to pressure the President into opening the taxpayer spigots for embryonic stem cell research on the basis of a wide-eyed hope that cures are near at hand.       Though embryonic stem cell research advocates euphemistically refer to the current state of research as an "early stage," the unfortunate reality is the goal of embryonic stem cell therapies is, at this point, more accurately described as a pipe dream. No researcher is anywhere close to significant progress in developing practical embryonic stem cell therapies.  &nbsp;      &nbsp;      The difficulty of embryonic stem cell research is underscored by the lack of progress in cancer research. Despite a 30-year, $40-billion "War on Cancer" launched by President Nixon, researchers continue to have great difficulty in controlling, let alone eradicating, the vast majority of cancer cell growth. Conceptually, controlled deployment of "good" stem cells should be vastly more complex than simply destroying "bad" cancer cells.       None of this is to say that embryonic stem cell research can't possibly lead to some improvements in biological understanding or future therapeutic treatments, but such speculative progress of who-knows-what value isn't in the foreseeable future. The only thing certain is that the cost of that research will be high.        &nbsp;    The spectacle of Ron Reagan at the Democratic Convention will be sad,&nbsp;the disgruntled son of the beloved former president misleading the public with naive hopes while being exploited for political gain by opponents of his father's party. That cynical strategy may get John Kerry a few more votes in November, but it's not going to produce any medical miracles anytime soon, if at all."        &nbsp;  Junior is being used. His father was pro-life for pete's sake!  &nbsp;  I hope this stunt back fires.  &nbsp;

      I had this posted in my "comments", but decided to&nbsp;copy it and turn it in to an official post.  &nbsp;  I do understand your point duponce. The world IS a scary place right now. But I completely disagree when you lay blame on Bush's doorstep (and NO, I am not a blind follower of anyone or anything, I do not always agree with the "party line", but that's a different topic).  &nbsp;  The thing that makes me so angry, is that people seem to have completely forgotten 911, the bombing of the Cole, bombing of various embassies, the first world trade center and even Somalia. We have been "at war" for years with terrorism. Most of the population just didn't realize it until 911. 911 was the final straw, and our people demanded action. Those responsible for 911 and the people who prop them up and fund or support them are the reason this world is a more dangerous place. I do not understand why certain parts of the world think we should have just sat on our hands and let Al Qaeda and Saddam decide where to hit us next.  &nbsp;  And NO, I am NOT saying Saddam was responsible for 911. But he hated us, and rejoiced when it happened. He thumbed his nose at the weapons inspecters and UN sanctions (I still do not understand why the heck he did that if there were no WMDs. Why not just come clean and say here ya go.&nbsp; He'd still be in power living in a palace and murdering dissenters. That doesn't seem to smart to me). I truly believe he would have come after us. Now that monster is behind bars where he belongs.  &nbsp;  You said "what the US does has implications for the entire planet". I hope and pray that is true. If Bush is able to spread democracy to Iraq, and some of the other countries that surround Iraq take notice, maybe the whole world could truly change. The world is dangerous because the terrorists do not want religious freedom or democracy to spread. How exactly would you have had us handle this differently? Put our heads in the sand while they continue to plot to destroy us? Can you not see this a common enemy? Who do you think they will go after next? Any free society. How do you know your Canada isn't next? Just because you did not send troops? That's not going to save you. These people will keep going until they wipe out any free society.  &nbsp;  I don't know if democracy and peace could reach the middle east region in my lifetime, but it could happen some day. The ball is rolling. No one thought the Iron Curtain would fall but it did. You never know.  &nbsp;  In regards to this comment - "and this I say to YOU, not CBFTW, ok? I don't want to make him feel like he's wasting his time and endangering his self for nothing)That's why I got so mad. When you make comments like the one you did about wondering if our soldiers are blind sheep, that IS belittling. Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that is how it came off. I am very protective of that kid. Maybe overprotective, granted, but I took that as a slight against CBFTW and our military in general.  &nbsp;  On a final note, I was at the World Trade Center one month after 911. It was still smoking. I met firefighters and policemen and relief workers and heard their stories. It changed me forever. I get it now. You cannot sit around and wait for someone to hurt you, and I do not understand why people would begrudge us this fight for our way of life.

      Do you lower yourself in to a duel-of-words, or do you let it go.  &nbsp;  I've been so frustrated with the anti-war rhetoric and the holier-than-thou insults thrown about by the left that I am&nbsp;a frazzled mess. I suppose that is their point though. Stay negative, beat the other side down, tap-dance with your psuedo-intellect, and hit all the damn talking points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I see it poisoning a blog that I love, and I am just beside myself.  &nbsp;  An individual on a blog a read&nbsp;actually posted this:  "I want to know if American soldiers are intelligent, rational human beings who truly believe that what they're doing is right for a variety of reasons, or if they're just mindless drones following orders and falling victim to group-think."   And this&nbsp;was on a soldier's blog!!!  &nbsp;  Holy crap.&nbsp;This soldier is in Iraq, going through hell, losing friends, fighting for democracy in the middle east,&nbsp;fighting terrorism so that this dude can be safe at home, and this guy had the NERVE to&nbsp;say he wants to know if soldiers are "mindless&nbsp;drones following orders" or "victims to group think".  &nbsp;  I'm so stunned that I can barely compose a coherent thought.  &nbsp;  How did we come to this? How can an American be so completely ignorant of our armed services and the honorable men and women who sacrifice their lives for our freedom? I am&nbsp;terrified for the future of our country.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I am praying that the&nbsp;soldier does not read that thread. He has enough to worry about as it is. Crikey. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just had to vent.

      I'd love to read your book one day. Fantastic title. I'm so glad you are encouraging cbftw to write a book too. You are both excellent writers, and I would be proud to read books by both of you.  I did the same thing you did - I signed up for a blog so that I could post on cbftw's site. Isn't it amazing how you can grow to care for someone so quickly just be reading someone's words? The power of the pen....or in this case, the keyboard and an internet cafe...is truly astounding.  I'll copy and paste some of this on his site too.   Thanks for posting on my site. -Jen

      Iraqi kitten reunites with Fort Carson soldier  posted by: Susan Wells        COLORADO SPRINGS (AP) - Saving Pvt. Hammer became a mission for Fort Carson Staff Sgt. Rick Bousfield of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.      Pfc. Hammer is an Iraqi tabby cat the unit adopted after he was born last fall at a base in Balad, 50 miles north of Baghdad. When Bousfield found out his unit was leaving Iraq in March, he decided he couldn't leave a member of his team behind.      "He has been through mortar attacks," said Bousfield, a 19-year Army veteran. "He'd jump and get scared liked the rest of us. He is kind of like one of our own."      Pfc. Hammer got his name from the unit that adopted him, Team Hammer.      Soldiers would tuck Hammer in their body armor during artillery attacks, and in return, Hammer chased mice in the mess hall and chased the blues away among soldiers.      "He was a stress therapist," Bousfield said. "The guys would come back in tired and stressed. Hammer would come back and bug the heck out of you. He wiped away some worries."      The kitten earned his rank after nabbing five mice.      When Bousfield learned in January that his unit was going home in March, he started looking for ways to rescue the kitten.      He sent an e-mail to Alley Cat Allies, a national clearinghouse of information on stray cats, asking for help.      "We had to say yes to an American soldier in Iraq," said group director Becky Robinson. "We had to do it for the animal's sake and the men's sake. They were over there, fighting, doing their job -- and rescuing a kitten."      Her group turned to Military Mascots, which helps service members who befriend pets while they are deployed on foreign soils.      Alley Cat Allies raised $2,500 for Hammer's shots, sterilization, paperwork and a plane ride to the United States.      Hammer left Iraq with his unit in March, then flew from Kuwait to San Francisco in cargo-class, and then flew first class with an Alley Cat Allies volunteer to Denver.      Bousfield met the kitten at the airport.      "Only my husband would go to this extreme for a cat," Sheri Bousfield said.      Hammer is now in Colorado Springs with the Bousfields; their children Tiffany, 15, and Jeffrey, 13; the family's five cats, a dog, hamsters and two geckos.   (Copyright 2004 by The Associated Press.

      "Let us endeaver so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry". -- Mark Twain  That quote is my mantra.   I had planned to be kinda silly today, but changed my mind after I read on the drudge report that the number of American casualties in Iraq is over 1000 as of today. Reading the latest number always upsets me, but crossing the 1000 mark really hit me hard today.  God Bless our troops. Please be careful out there guys.

      ...and says "bartender! Get me a drink!" The bartender looks at the string and says "WE DON'T SERVE YOUR KIND HERE". The string walks outside, ties his hair up, messes it up, goes back in the bar and says "BARTENDER! Get me a drink"!!! The bartender says "aren't you that string I just threw outta here?". The string replies, "No, I'm a frayed knot".   ba-dump-dump   I've known that joke for 10 years and it still makes me giggle. Don't know if it's the joke itself or just the memory associated with the joke. Maybe I'll write about that memory some day. *evil grin*   I'm an addict. A blog-reading addict. Never thought I'd actually write one myself. Did I wake up today and say "I must throw my hat in the proverbial cyberland ring?!?!?". NAY! I wanted to post a reply on a soldier's blog wishing him well and was unable to without registering. So I registered.   So I am an accidental blogger...?   Hmmm...I must go ponder my possibilities.....   to be serious or to be silly...that is the question.

      I don't know if I can write about this experience and do it justice, but I have to try. I hope I remember all the details. I’m sure I will leave something out.   A few weeks ago I received a phone call at work from a lady whose son in law was a soldier in Afghanistan. She had some questions about how the place I work at handles people with special needs, disabilities, etc. Her son-in-law had been hurt pretty bad, so I gave her a lesson in ADA (Americans with disabilities act)101. We had a wonderful conversation. She asked if her daughter could call me for ADA school too.  Her sweetheart of a daughter, who is all of 21, called me and we discussed ADA laws and such. She explained to me what happened to her 22 year old husband. The story, and the spirit of this amazing young couple floored me. I have to share their story with my blog friends.  Katy's husband, PFC Kenneth (that’s his first name, not his last name), was stationed in Afghanistan. He was some sort of scout (I wish I had written it down). It was a very dangerous job. He was there for 8 months, with barely a scratch. One night, while he was sleeping, one of the other soldiers in his platoon was cleaning his rifle. The gun fired, and shot PFC Kenneth in the head. Katy received notification that her husband would not survive. She heard from others in his unit that after the gun went off, PFC Kenneth stood up and grabbed his gun on reflex, and then crumpled. His heart stopped. A nearby medic ran an I.V., and performed CPR. They got his heart going again, and the medics put him on a helicopter to Kuwait. He crashed several times on the helicopter.  While in Kuwait, a team of Kuwaiti doctors worked to save him. He was not doing well. He lost both eyes, part of the frontal lobe of his brain, had a cracked skull, major concussion......truly devastating injuries. A visiting American doctor heard there was an injured American soldier, and asked to review the case. The visiting doctor discovered that PFC Kenneth was on the wrong meds. He most likely would have died if the American doctor had not stepped in.  After PFC Kenneth was stabilized, he was sent back to the US (I think she said Bethesda?).   Katy said that before he was able to comprehend the extent of his injuries, he kept talking about how he had to get back to his unit. Isn’t it awe-inspiring how we keep hearing stories of injured soldiers with that same thought - "I must get back to my men".   PFC Kenneth has had multiple surgeries, all brain or eye related, and all very dangerous. He has come through all of them with flying colors. He is tough as nails.   It has been about three months now. PFC Kenneth was sent from the hospital to a rehab center that specializes in sight disabilities. His wife called it "blind school". They teach people who have lost their site how to take care of themselves. They also teach their principal care-giver the dos and don'ts. He has been staying there Monday through Friday. Every Friday, Katy drives three hours to Waco to pick him up, and drives three hours home. On Sundays she makes the six hour trip again.  So fast forward to the present.  PFC Kenneth has made remarkable progress. His graduation from his sight impairment school was Friday. His wife wanted to take him on their first big outing to see a Toby Keith concert (Toby is one of Kenneth's heros) as a surprise, and this is how I became involved and got to know her. We had such a great connection, and she asked if I could meet them when they got here. Good grief. I told her it would be MY honor to meet her and her husband.   I began telling any person who would listen about this young man's story. I called in favors, worked every angle I could think of, and gosh did this turn out well.  On the day of the concert, our fabulous police officers held the very best parking space for Katy and PFC Kenneth. I can't stress how big of a perk this was. Parking can be a nightmare out here. I conspired with the police officers, our VP, backstage security, the promoter, the production people, the marketing team, and the band security person to roll out the red carpet. When they arrived, they gave their names and were shown to their special parking spot. Our fabulous police officers escorted Katy and PFC Kenneth to the back stage gate, and called me so I could meet them and take them around. By the time I walked out there, they were surrounded by police officers and security guards all wanting to meet them.  I wish I had been able to take a picture of this scene. All of the gigantic officers and security people were clamoring for an introduction and wanting to shake their hands. These officers deal with famous people all the time, and I have NEVER seen them excited like this before. Everyone was so emotional.  I walked up and introduced myself (I am tearing up trying to write this). The first thing that popped in to my head was "Gosh they look young". I knew they were 21 and 22, but they looked like high school kids. They both had giant grins on their faces and looked so excited. PFC Kenneth was wearing what I think is a formal military uniform hat, but I am not sure. It was dark blue, and shaped like a cowboy hat with military insignia on it. He had on dark sunglasses. He has not had cosmetic surgery yet, and his scars have not fully healed and were visible. Man oh man. That kid has been through hell. Lovely Katy was decked out in a military shirt and military wife cap. Despite all they have been through, I thought they both glowed. You can just feel the love between them.  So I walked up, and Katy told him I was there. He asked to shake MY hand and said he was thrilled to meet me. ME?!?!?! Good grief. I was trying not to cry, and boy was that a losing battle. So Katy told him I was right in front of him and he raised his hand (she will say things like “he or she is right in front of you” or “he’s to your right”, she is always giving him cues. It’s amazing to watch.) So we were shaking hands...and shaking hands...and shaking hands...and shaking hands…and finally Katy started laughing and reached out and touched him and said “that’s enough silly”, and he started laughing. LAUGHING. He told me it was “nice to see me”, paused, and started cracking up again.   PFC Kenneth is a first class jokester and a total smart ass. I of course fell instantly, madly in love. I have a feeling this happens to every person who comes in contact with him.  While we were standing there talking, he paused and said “Katy, where are we?”, and Katy said “We’re back stage at a concert”. He kinda cocked his head and said “Why are we here?” and she said “To see Toby Keith”. He said “Who is Toby Keith?”, and then Katy paused and busted out laughing. He was messing with her, and pretending to be confused. He started laughing again and said “She falls for it every single time”.   After a while, one of my favorite police officers walked the three of us through the backstage maze to get to the VIP club area. All of the performers and roadies were playing a rowdy game of basketball. John, the police officer, pointed out Toby. PFC Kenneth said that he wanted to go play and started laughing. Unfortunately we couldn’t do that, but Katy was excited about getting to watch for a second. As we walked towards the club Kenneth said “Oh well. I’d probably be a lousy shot anyway” and started laughing again. Did I mention this guy is, as we say here in Texas, a "cut-up"?  When we got to the club, John had to leave us and go back to work. As he was leaving, he shook PFC Kenneth’s hand...and shook his hand...and shook his hand...it is so funny the way he does that. John thanked him for serving our country and had tears in his eyes.(By the way, John is about 6’4” and one of the toughest guys you ever saw, and it was overwhelming to see him emotional.)  The three of us sat on the patio for a while before I had to go back to my office. I got Katy’s cell # from her, and told her I was working on a surprise. She handed me a gift bag before I walked away.  When I got back to my office, I opened the bag. There was a beautiful silver cross paperweight and a beautiful card. I lost it. Completely lost it. She had told me that their faith in God and in each other is what keeps them going. Then I read the card. Oh my gosh the card. It was really lovely, with a nice note from Katy. The thing that sent me completely off the cliff was PFC Kenneth had signed his name, in a shaky crooked hand. The significance of that...my god I just can’t put it in to words how overwhelming this was.  So like I said before, I had been conspiring with a lot of people to show this beautiful young couple a good time. After calling in every favor I could, I found out at about 6pm that Toby wanted to meet PFC Kenneth!!! This is a huge deal these days, because security is super tight and passes have become a rare thing. The production guy called me and I met him and the tour security guard outside. We found PFC Kenneth and Katy in their seats. The tour guy shook Kenneth’s hand...and shook his hand...and shook his hand...and gave them their special passes to go back stage.  By this time, the word had spread about who Kenneth was throughout the staff, and everyone was going up to them and saying hello. Katy and PFC Kenneth were positively BEAMING. It was the most humbling, awe-inspiring, life-changing, rewarding experience I have ever had.   For all of us who were involved in this special moment, PFC Kenneth is our rock star, not the artists who perform on our stage.

      I've seen this list before, but it still makes me laugh. Anybody have one to add? -Jen  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  "How to maintain a healthy level of insanity" At lunch time, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars.  See if they slow down.  Page yourself over the intercom.  Don’t disguise your voice.  Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that.  Put your garbage can on your desk and label it “In”.  Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks.  Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.  In the memo field of all your checks, write “For sexual favors”  Finish all your sentences with “in accordance with The Prophecy.”  Don’t use any punctuation  As often as possible, skip rather than walk.  Ask people what sex they are.  Laugh hysterically after they answer.  Specify that your drive-through order is “To Go.”  Sing along at the opera  Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don’t rhyme.  Put mosquito netting around your work area and play tropical sounds all day.  Five days in advance, tell your friends you can’t attend their party because you’re not in the mood  Have your co-workers address you by your wrestling name “Rock Hard”.  When the money comes out of the ATM, scream “I won!  I won!”  When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot, yelling “Run for your lives!  They’re loose!!”  Tell your children over dinner, “Due to the economy, we are going to have to let one of you go.”

      My cousin emailed this to me. He works with this soldier's step-father.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Dave will be moved to Bethesda sometime today for surgery on his eyes.  It’s a 10+ hour flight, so surgery may not be until tomorrow or the next day.  Dave still has shrapnel in his face, near his brain, and near his retina. We were concerned about possible damage to the brain either by movement before the surgery or during the removal process. The doctor assured us that is not likely. He has 20/200 vision in one eye and no vision in the other. They did an ultra sound on the eyes and the good news is the retinas are not detached. The outcome of his vision is undetermined. They started him on a clear liquid diet, trying to get him used to foods again and have started walking him a little, getting him out of bed.  He may also receive skin graphs on his thigh that has a hole about the size of a 50-cent piece, about an inch deep. One of his eardrums is burst, but that either will repair itself or can be repaired.  The doctor said he believes the other shrapnel wounds will be fine. The doctor feels positive about his recovery.  I have a little more detail about what happened.  Dave’s platoon was called out in response to the helicopter being shot down early Thursday morning. They had been actively engaged in a firefight at the cemetery for about 10 hours.  Now for the real miracle: We told Dave he is on the prayer list of so many churches and people all over the country are praying for him. He said, “Mom, I want to make this real clear. When people pray for me, I want it to be prayers of thanks that I’m still alive. I should be dead now.” Then he told us the RPG hit his helmet. He said if it was not a direct hit, it was a partial hit. He saw it coming and felt the impact. Please remember that in your prayers and give thanks. Dave said he will never be so vain as to complain about some blurred vision knowing how close he came to death. He said he can’t even pray for his eyesight because he feels God has already done so much for him.  Dave is in good spirits and has a positive attitude.   He said, “Mom, I want to be real firm about this and you have to understand. Once I recover from all this, I’m going right back. I have to be with my Marines.”

      I wonder if we will see something akin to Bill Clinton's impeachment where the ''fair-minded'' Democrats and their liberal supporters refused to even look at the evidence? The press will bury it in their back pages, then drop it forever and go back to scrutinizing President Bush's National Guard records...  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Unfit for command?  By Tony Blankley  I stayed up late last night and read from cover to cover the book "Unfit for Command — Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry." An impartial reader (if there is still such a beast in this election season) would have to conclude that either the book is a pack of lies or John Kerry is in fact a reckless, lying man who misrepresented the facts in order to receive medals he didn't deserve, and is indeed unfit to command even a tug boat, let alone the United States military as president.       The book appears to be meticulously researched and reported. It is replete with copious footnotes, a detailed index and two appendices. First-hand witnesses are named and quoted verbatim to support each specific, shocking charge. Each charge of false heroics is logically presented. Theauthors quote the official Navy citation and then present the purported eyewitnesstestimony that refutes the official finding. The witnesses who are summoned forth are officers and men who served simultaneously with Mr. Kerry in Coastal Division 11 and purport to be eyewitnesses to the events in question.       And yet, there is another group of men, the sailors who served directly under John Kerry on the same boat with him — his band of brothers. They have traveled around the country with Mr. Kerry and have vouched for his description of his heroic, able and selfless service to our country.       One of these groups of men are lying through their teeth. This is not a case of failed memories. In a few instances, it could be a case of honest differences of perception of events. But considering all the testimony and evidence, John Kerry is either Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. As of this moment there is about a 50-50 chance that we will elect, in the person of John Kerry, either a very fine man or a truly despicable man president of the United States.       Either group of men, if we knew nothing else, would seem to be credible, reliable witnesses. Both groups of men served honorably in Vietnam, gained many medals and have apparently lived respectable lives since then. Few if any of them have been politically active in the last 30 years.       The men making the charges are almost all of his fellow officers and the higher chain of command in Kerry's coastal Division 11. The book points out that on John Kerry's Web site he has a photo of himself and 19 fellow swift boat officers, taken while they were simultaneously serving in that unit. Of those 19 fellow officers, 11 have asked him to stop using their image with him. Of the remaining eight, two are deceased, four don't wish to be involved and one is not a supporter of Kerry but didn't have the opportunity to sign the letter calling for the photo to be taken off the Web site. Only one of the 19, Skip Barker, supports Mr. Kerry.       There has been some confusion about whether the witnesses against Kerry had an adequate view of his conduct, compared with the view of his supporters who were on his boat. The book explains that the swift boats usually moved in a pack of three or four on the same mission. They operated within yards of each other. Moreover, they all docked, bunked, ate and lived in the same camp.       If one compared their relations to an army company of men, the fellow junior officers who captained the tiny swift boats were the functional equivalent of squad leaders, each with their own handful of men under them. Squad leaders, operating on the same mission together, are in excellent positions to assess the performance of their fellow squad leaders. They are covering each other's flanks. The book is filled with testimony of these men, describing what they claim they clearly saw John Kerry doing and not doing.       Of course, almost every presidential campaign has an outcropping of scandal charges. Usually it is by one or two people — a woman who claimed she met the candidate in a bar, some political opponent from a long forgotten campaign reprieving his shopworn, uncorroborated calumny. If a book is involved in such charges, the opposing party usually finds a hack ghost-writer.       But this scandal charge is by more than 200 respectable former naval officers and men. The primary author, John O'Neill, first started publicly challenging Mr. Kerry more than 30 years ago on the Dick Cavett Show. The co-author, Jerome Corsi, is not a political hack, but a college friend of Mr. O'Neill, with a Ph.D. from Harvard and a distinguished writing career.       The book has the ring of sincerity to it, and the mark of careful research and writing. If they are not telling the truth, all these men have exposed themselves to financially ruinous libel actions by Mr. Kerry — who has the private resources to prosecute such actions. Even as a public figure, he might well win such an action, if this book is the pack of lies the Kerry camp says it is.       If it is not a pack of lies, the nation needs to know that, too. I would encourage some of the major voices of the non-conservative mainline media — Tim Russert, Dan Rather, Leonard Downie Jr. of The Washington Post — to do as I did. Spend an evening reading the book. If they are not struck by the damning picture it paints of John Kerry and the credibility of the presentation, forget about it. But if they judge it as I did, then let their consciences be their guide.   http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20040810-100236-4377r.htm

      Found this in my email today.....-Jen  (Author unknown)  For good and ill, the Iraqi prisoner abuse mess will remain an issue.  On the one hand, right thinking Americans will abhor the stupidity of the actions while on the other hand, political glee will take control and fashion this minor event into some modern day My Lai massacre.   I heard some Arabs and Muslims are asking for an apology.  I humbly offer mine here:   I am sorry that the last seven times we Americans took up arms and sacrificed the blood of our youth, it was in the defense of Muslims (Bosnia, Kosovo, Gulf War 1, Kuwait, etc.).   I am sorry that no such call for an apology upon the extremists came after 9/11.  I am sorry that all of the murderers on 9/11 were Islamic Arabs.   I am sorry that most Arabs and Muslims have to live in squalor under savage dictatorships. I am sorry that their leaders squander their wealth.  I am sorry that their governments breed hate for the US in their religious schools, mosques, and government-controlled media.   I am sorry that Yasir Arafat was kicked out of every Arab country and highjacked the Palestinian "cause".  I am sorry that no other Arab country will take in or offer more than a token amount of financial help to those same Palestinians.   I am sorry that the USA has to step in and be the biggest financial supporter of poverty stricken Arabs while the insanely wealthy Arabs blame the USA for all their problems.   I am sorry that our own left wing elite, our media, and our own brainwashed (from elements of our society like radical professors, CNN and the NY TIMES) masses do not understand any of this. I am sorry the United Nations scammed the poor people of Iraq out of the "food for oil" money so they could get rich while the common folk suffered.   I am sorry that some Arab governments pay the families of homicide bombers upon their death.  I am sorry that those same bombers are brainwashed thinking they will receive 72 virgins in "paradise."   I am sorry that the homicide bombers think pregnant women, babies, children, the elderly and other noncombatant civilians are a legitimate targets.   I am sorry that our troops die to free more Arabs from the gang rape rooms and the filling of mass graves of dissidents of their own making.   I am sorry that Muslim extremists have killed more Arabs than any other group.   I am sorry that foreign trained terrorists are trying to seize control of Iraq and return it to a terrorist state.  I am sorry we don't drop a few dozen Daisy cutters on Fallujah.   I am sorry every time terrorists hide they find a convenient "Holy Site". I am sorry they didn't apologize for driving a jet into the World Trade Center that collapsed and severely damaged Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - one of our Holy Sites.   I am sorry they didn't apologize for flight 93 and 175, the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, the murders and beheadings of Nick Berg and Daniel Pearl, etc....etc!   I am sorry Michael Moore is American; he could feed a medium sized village in Africa.   America will get past this latest absurdity.  We will punish those responsible because that is what we do.  We hang out our dirty laundry for all the world to see.  We move on.  That's one of the reasons we are hated so much.  We don't hide this stuff like all those Arab countries that are now demanding an apology.   Deep down inside, when most Americans saw this reported in the news, we were like - so what?  We lost hundreds and made fun of a few prisoners.   Sure, it was wrong, sure, it dramatically hurts our cause, but until captured we were trying to kill these same prisoners.  Now we're supposed to wring our hands because a few were humiliated?  Our compassion is tempered with the vivid memories of our own people killed, mutilated and burnt amongst a joyous crowd of celebrating Fallujans.   If you want an apology from this American, you're going to have a long wait.  You have a better chance of finding those 72 virgins.

      Famed oil field firefighter Red Adair dies at age 89 By DANNY PEREZ and RASHA MADKOUR Copyright 2004 Houston Chronicle Legendary Houston oil field firefighter Paul "Red" Adair, renowned worldwide for battling some of the fiercest oil fires in modern times, died Saturday of natural causes. He was 89.   Adair had been in and out of the hospital over the last few years for various reasons but was full of vigor after retiring from fighting fires, his daughter, Robyn Adair, said.   "He had been battling different diseases off and on. He was elderly and had issues with his health," she said.   She said fighting fires was her father's passion. "He knew his talents for putting out oil-well fires was a God-given gift and he was thankful for that," she said. "He was very energetic and quick on his feet."   Around the world, governments and billionaires sought out Adair to battle and cap their raging oil field fires. He spent nearly five decades putting out fires and was renowned as the best in his profession.   "He's probably up there right now telling Jesus how to rearrange things," joked Sunny Abel, a granddaughter who gave birth to Adair's first great-grandchild, 15-month-old Emma. "That's how he did his life, he was just so meticulous and so intelligent."   Adair got his start in 1946 working for Myron Kinley, a pioneer of well-fire and blowout control in Houston. In 1959, Adair bought Kinley's equipment for $125 and started his own business.   Within a few years, Adair and his crew were battling a fire at a natural gas well in the Sahara Desert known as The Devil's Cigarette Lighter.   Flames shot 800 feet into the air with a sound that shook the ground for miles. Within a half mile of the well, the desert sand was melted into glass from the intense heat.   After deciding that digging under the natural gas well would be too dangerous, Adair put out the fire with a single blast from 750 pounds of nitroglycerine.   "Got it on the first shot," he was quoted as saying in a 1994 Houston Chronicle article.   His company brought 119 well fires under control in Kuwait, out of about 700 that were torched by the Iraqis.   But Adair himself has had some close calls. He was working on a well near Falfurrias, in South Texas, in the 1940s when an explosion under the platform propelled him upward through the derrick for an estimated 50 to 60 feet. He escaped without injury.   On a job near Weatherford, Adair was holding a handful of blasting caps with dynamite at his feet, when a bulldozer operator carelessly drove over the electric wires leading to the caps. Heralded jobs performed by Adair included extinguishing a massive offshore blaze at Bay Marchand, La., in 1970; the Bravo offshore blowout in the North Sea in 1977; the Ixtoc blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 1979; and the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 that killed 167 men on a North Sea platform.   Adair was the inspiration for a 1968 movie called Hellfighters, starring John Wayne. Adair said he got to be friends with Wayne while serving as a technical adviser for the movie, and even took the actor to see a real blowout.   Adair Red put out fires in Kuwait in 1965; Algeria in 1972; Gaylord, Mich., in 1977; Sumatra in 1978; Libya in 1979; Mexico in 1980; and Germany in 1981.   Capping wells and fighting some of the most dangerous fires came second-nature and he welcomed the challenges such as the fires in Kuwait during the first Gulf War. "It wasn't that big of deal to him. Everything happened so quick. The most difficult thing about Kuwait was there was so many of them," Robyn Adair said.   Adair, one of eight children of Mary and Charles Adair, grew up in Houston. He was born June 18, 1915, in Houston. He attended Harvard Elementary School and Hogg Junior High School, and dropped out of Reagan High School to help support his family.   He enlisted in the Army in 1945 and served in the 139th Bomb Disposal Squadron through the end of World War II.   Adair is survived by his wife of 64 years, Kemmie; a son, Jimmy; a daughter, Robyn; grandchildren, Sunny Abel, Paul Hinson and Derek Adair; and a great-granddaughter.

      This will bring tears to your eyes. --------------------------- At 12:08 PM, Bigandmean said...  My cousin Joan and I met another cousin, Janet, at our Uncle Marvin's house on Saturday. We talked and laughed and listened to his stories for about four hours - until he obviously was very tired. Joan lives in Chicago and can't get to Texas often so she's afraid she'll never get to see him alive again each time she leaves.  He's still feisty and very quick mentally but his body is failing him a little more every day. He endures an incredible amount of pain every day. His weight is down to 123 pounds, although he works hard to gain weight. He says that if he never gets back to the 180 pounds he once was he can always become a jockey. His sense of humor is still like it always was.  When we left, we slowly backed out of his very long driveway with him walking along with us and waving goodbye. Joan and Janet were fighting back tears. As we reached the end of his drive way he straightened up, clicked his heels together and gave us a perfectly executed military salute. He stood in the street and held the salute as we turned the corner. By the time we got out of sight, I was in the same shape my girl cousins were.

      A little more about Uncle Marvin, whom I have mentioned before. I'm going to try to have a post of his WWII experiences up within a week or so.  At 8:48 AM, Bigandmean said...  My Uncle and Jen's Great Uncle Marvin has written about his recollections as an infantryman, beginning with being at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 and continuing through heavy fighting, some hand to hand, against the Japanese in the South Pacific. Some of it was dictated to his sons who transcribed it.   He tells of being pinned down by sniper fire in the jungles of the island of Leite, crawling on his stomach to fill canteens with water for his squad and many other acts of bravery by members of "the greatest generation". There's no mention of purple hearts awarded for self-inflicted scratches.  Jen is planning to post some of his account on her blog.  My cousin Joan is visiting from Chicago this week-end. She and I are leaving Houston in about 10 minutes to make the two hour drive to Uncle Marvin's home for a short visit. He hasn't been doing well and every minute with him is a real treasure. Joan's dad and mine were Marvin's brothers and both have been gone for some time now. Being with him is almost like being with our dads again.   Jen, I'll tell Uncle Marv you said hello.

      I was lucky enough to find this blogger today. Her name is jules, and she’s only 18!   http://wildred2004.blogspot.com   MONDAY, AUGUST 02, 2004 My Stance on G.W. & Kerry  A couple things.   #1: I believe the Pres. did the right thing going into Afghanistan and I’ll probably write another blog in a few days discussing why I agree and disagree with the invasion of Saddam's territory, but I can tell you right now that the “pro” is going to outweigh the con. It isn’t like I haven’t heard both sides of the issue.   #2: I DO believe that National Guard service "counts" as serving one's country. I also understand that the pay stubs of President Bush's "AWOL" weekends have been dug up and do exist and eyewitness' have come forward, people who served w/ Bush, stating that he was present. The President was not AWOL though the (admittedly) biased Media keeps saying he was. In continuation, people who say: "because he didn't go to Vietnam" that his service somehow didn't count, are full of it. My dad enlisted in the Army--everyone in his family up 'till him had always been in the Army--thinking he'd go to Vietnam. His wanted to be a medic. He ended up switching gears, learning Russian and working in Germany. Did his service some how not "count"? Is the Left's overly simplistic message one that says: "If you're not killing something, if you're not 'over there' then you're not serving"? If that is true, then the following example should be true as well: Right now we're at war. If you're a member of the Arizona, Texas or New Mexico Air Guard, your service doesn't count. Because if it didn't count then, why should it count now? (I'd like to see the fallout from that statement, go ahead DNC, equate then with now, I dare you.) I’d like to also pointing out that Kerry himself had a deferment for school AND that President Bush made his Military Records available to the public years ago, Mr. Kerry has not.   #3: I do not trust Politicians. They should never be completely trusted at any point in time, especially those who dream of power from a very young age. Mr. Kerry has always wanted to be President. If it means reinventing himself, reinventing his family, trying to pass the Democratic Party off as 'Mainstream America', he'll do it. All because he wants to be President. A reporter in 2000 asked Bush what would he do if he lost the Presidential race. Bush replied that he'd go back to Texas. He doesn't need the Presidency the way Kerry does. I don't trust either of them the way I trust my friends and close family, but here you go: I wouldn’t trust John Kerry or John Edwards with my dog, let alone my country. Who do I think my puppy would like more? Dub-yah and Cheney, hands down.   #4: I have tried to stay focused on why I prefer Bush to Kerry. But in the end it comes down to "Bush is the best of 'em." John Kerry I loathe and do so for several reasons:  A) He went overseas, served his country (I don't loathe that--he has my respect, he did serve) but then he came back and promptly stabbed his fellow soldier, his brothers in the Armed forces, in the backs. He called them "baby killers", threw his medals away (the same ones he keeps trumpeting about now), made himself a public figure in the destruction of the American soldier. I loathe him bitterly for that. These are his fellow unit members, his crew members...people who would have died for him...and he comes back and disgraces them all.  B) He has, repeatedly in the past, voted against increases in military/intelligence spending. But he has the gall to stand in front of the American public and declare that he is concerned for our troops and that he’s going to work for a better intelligence community. How is he going to back that claim up when he votes to cut intelligence spending by 50%? Kerry, are you going to support troops like you did during Vietnam, you disgusting puke—after you got back and were no longer in the danger zone? Are you going to call my friends and cousin "baby killers" and say they killed civillians willingly? Are you going to cut spending so badly that my friends and family are forced to try and "get along" in a war zone?   C) John Kerry had the nerve, all week at the DNC, to talk about "values" and how his administration will bring them back to the White House. John Kerry is not worthy enough to lick Ronald Reagan's boots. President Regan, recovering in the hospital after being shot, accidentally spilled water on the floor. An aide walked in and found that the President of the greatest nation on the planet was on his knees, weakly attempting to clean up the spill because he didn't want his nurse to get in trouble. That is humility, true compassion, a concern for those around oneself that John Kerry does not evince. John Kerry, in his home state, makes a habit of budging to the front of lines, being rude to restaurant workers and despite the touching (and I believe trumped up) story of saving Licorice the Hamster, I have an entirely different story to tell. Mike Gallagher stayed in John Kerry's neighborhood of Beacon Hill, (he has 5 houses--man of the working class my ass) at a historical B&B with his wife for the DNC. The B&B owner, a nice woman, told Mr. Gallagher a story. She owned a dog, an incredibly friendly dog that everyone in the neighborhood knew and loved. One day while walking her dog on a public-fricking-sidewalk, John Kerry came striding up (can’t you see this man is important, woman!?) and growled out: “Get that damned dog out of my way!”  John Kerry is no man of the working class. He is not some great person concerned with the way America is moving. He bragged about how foreign powers support him (undermining the current administration??) and is endorsed by one of the biggest lobby groups in the Washington D.C.—the Trial Lawyers Assc.. This man is a two faced liar. A Shameless, hypocritical, complete joker. He is your friend as long as you serve a purpose and as soon as he's no longer "in the swift boat", he stabs you in the back.   He purports to support causes then votes against them. He insults our sitting President (and by default, all veterans of the Texas Air Guard) by claiming that his military service doesn't count. Kerry allies himself with those who compare Bush to Hitler and then expects to lecture me, the average American, on values? This is a man who claims to be a Catholic, who claims to believe life begins at conception but votes against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?? That last bit, in and of itself, should give enough credence to what I am saying.   His values are his values only until they fail to get him where he wants to go. Then he changes, yet again. John Kerry would destroy us all in a heartbeat, while assuring us he has our best interests close to his heart. He would turn our sovregenity over to the UN without a second thought. He is a liar and a sneak, and should never be trusted with the presidency.   God forbid, another 9-11 happens, who would you rather be President, VP and First Lady? George Bush, Richard Cheney and Laura Bush or John Kerry, John Edwards and Tereza Heinz-Kerry. Not for a moment would I trust the Johns of the Democratic Party and their back-peddling, haughty, elitist, ice-queen of a First Lady with my life and the lives of my family and friends (this includes those who are serving overseas in Iraq.)  I would rather have a Texan who clears his own brush on his own ranch, represent me. I would rather a Montanan who isn't going to back down for telling a dirty little sneak to "fuck off" represent me. I would rather put my life in their capable hands.  Never would I calmly vote for some smooth-talking trial lawyer who couldn't get reelected in his home-state or an elitist, money-sniffing, back-stabbing wannabe-Kennedy.   Bush may not have been my first choice, but he is the best choice in this situation. And I'll take him over Kerry any day of the week.  POSTED BY JULES AT 6:26 PM    urlLink

      	  	Future of Texas  	  	Please note that Texas is the only state with a legal right to secede from  	the Union (please refer to the Texas-American Annexation Treaty of 1848).  	  	We Texans love y'all, but we'll have to take action if Kerry wins  	president over Bush. We'll miss you, too.  	  	Texas has given all those complainers plenty of time to get used to the  	results. After seeing the whiners along the campaign route, the folks from  	Texas are considering taking matters into our own hands.  	  	Here is our solution:  	  	#1: Let John Kerry become President of the United States. (all 49 states.)  	  	#2: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of Texas.  	  	So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic?  	  	1. NASA is just south of Houston, Texas. (we will control the space  	industry.)  	  	2. We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States.  	  	3. Defense Industry. (We have over 65% of it) The term "Don't mess with  	Texas," will take on a whole new meaning.  	  	4. Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of Texas will need  	for the next 300 years. Yankee states? Sorry about that.  	  	5. Natural Gas - Again we have all we need and it's too bad about those  	northern states. John Kerry will figure a way to keep them warm....  	  	6. Computer Industry - we currently lead the nation in producing computer  	chips and communications: Small places like Texas Instruments, Dell  	Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Intel, AMD,  	Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas Semiconductor,  	Delphi, Nortel, Alcatel, Etc, Etc. The list goes on and on.  	  	7. Health Centers - We have the largest research centers for Cancer  	research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world and  	other large health planning centers.  	  	8. We have enough colleges to keep us going: UT., Texas A&M, TCU,  	TexasTech, Rice, SMU, University of Houston, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's  	University, etc.   Ivy grows better in the south anyway.  	  	9. We have a ready supply of workers. (just open the border when we need  	some more)  	  	10. We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.  	  	11. In case of a foreign invasion, we have the Texas National Guard and  	the Texas Air National Guard. We don't have an army but since everybody  	down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammo, we can raise an army  	in 24 hours if we need it. If the situation really gets bad, we can always  	call Department of Public Safety and ask them to send over a couple Texas  	Rangers.  	  	12. We are totally self sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs and several  	types of grain, fruit and vegetables and lets not forget seafood from the  	Gulf. And everybody down here knows how to cook them so that they taste  	good. Don't need any food.  	  	This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of Texas in  	good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need and don't have.  	  	Now to the rest of the United States under President Kerry:  	  	Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only  	President Kerry will be able to drive around in his 9 mile per gallon SUV.  	The rest of the United States will have to walk or ride bikes.  	  	You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off your  	communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but  	since Mr. Kerry has predicted global warming, you will not need the gas.  	  	  	Good luck,  	Signed, The People in Texas

      from nypost.com  RUDY: JOHN IS MOORE'S STOOGE   By VINCENT MORRIS August 6, 2004 -- WASHINGTON — Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted John Kerry yesterday as a Michael Moore lackey after the Democratic hopeful mocked President Bush's initial reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks.   In a statement issued by the Bush campaign, Giuliani charged, "John Kerry must be frustrated in his campaign if he is armchair-quarterbacking based on cues from Michael Moore."   Giuliani pounced after Kerry hammered Bush's first reaction to the news of the Twin Towers attack, which came while the president was reading to schoolkids in Florida.  Kerry yesterday said that if he were president on Sept. 11, 2001, he wouldn't have continued reading for seven minutes as Bush did after learning of the attacks — which is highlighted in Moore's "Fahrenheit 911."   "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to . . . and I would have attended to it," Kerry said.   Giuliani commented, "John Kerry is an indecisive candidate [with] an inconsistent position on the War on Terror, who voted against funding for our troops and who cannot give a clear answer on his position concerning the decision to remove Saddam Hussein."

      Ala71 wrote a post the other day that revealed some personal stuff. I thought that was really cool. We are all pretty used to giving our opinions on various subjects out here in blogland, but what do we really know about each other? Rose reveals a lot about herself on her blog, Ala71 wrote some posts about herself, so I thought I'd follow suit.  - - - - - - I was a twirler for the first 19 or so years of my life.   My Mom was one in high school too. So was my Aunt.  I miss performing in front of a crowd.  I still twirl everything I pick up - pens, rulers, umbrellas, whatever. - - - - - - I'm related to a bunch of pro-football players - Terry Bradshaw, Bubby Brister,  Hall-of-famer LeRoy Jordan...all cousins.  My Uncle (BigandMean's little brother) looks an awful lot like Terry, only with brown hair. - - - - - - My Great Uncle Marvin, who is pushing 90, was in Pearl Harbor. I'm working on a transcription of his experiences for the blog. - - - - - - I used to work in the Theater, but I don't act.  Now I work in the music industry, but I don't sing.  I see an average of fifty concerts a year.   I have seen over a hundred in one year.  You'd be surprised how boring that can be. - - - - - - I met Scott, aka Love-o-my-life, almost 7 years ago. It was love at first site. BAM.   Scott moved to Houston from New York two weeks after we met.  I married Scott a year and a half later in Dalhousie castle in Scotland.  No, we are not Scottish. We just love Scotland.  Scott is half Italian, on his Mother's side, which I find fascinating.  Yes, they had relatives in the mafia a couple generations ago, but they still will not talk about it.  His family is larger and louder than any family I have ever encountered in my whole life.  The first year we were married, Scott was traveling with an oil company all over the world, including some scary places like the Columbian Rain Forest, where he was surrounded by drug running guerilla fighters who wanted to kill him. (run on sentence alert)  We were together a total of three months that year, and that was not consecutive time.  The money rocked, but it was incredibly painful.  Scott left that world before 911, and works in Houston now. Thank God.  I wish Scott would blog. He's hysterically funny.  He'd have to kick ME off to do it though. *grin* - - - - - - I have an Irish-German temper, which I occasionally lose.  I'm a cancer, so I am always devastated by guilt afterwards.  I'm a cancer, so I am always worrying about someone or something.  Despite my astrological sign, I'm more laid back in real life than I am in blogland. - - - - - -  So now you know more about my world. Tell me more about yours....?

      First - much love to Lefty, TWD, Rose, Ala71 and artbyruth for the back-up.  This was in my comments today:  At 3:35 PM, Mermaid said…   I don't understand the title of your blog: "fair haired yet strangely unbalanced" ????? maybe I am just dumb or something. however, I certainly have to disagree with your political veiws... I can understand if you are married to an army man then you are probably republican and all, but what if he dies in the war or something? bush is the one sending our soldiers across the ocean so they can go and get killed. not kerry. kerry is simply running for president so that us people who want a more secure united states which is not billions of dollars in debt will get what we want. kerry has done nothing wrong, there is no reason to put him in your computer trash. anyway that's just my opinion.    Mermaid - Where oh where shall I start.   The title of my blog is a bit of a joke. Originally I called it Jen's ramblings, but I found another blog called something close to that so I decided to change mine. My title is a play on the Fox news channel slogan "Fair and Balanced". "Fair haired", because I have blonde hair, and "Strangely unbalanced" to infer I am a little quirky. I admit it, and I own my quirkiness. Last week I changed my subtitle to "The blog that ate my brain". I've been thinking about changing the official title to that, but lots of people already have me linked this way, so I guess I'll keep it as is.  Yes, I am a republican, though I am not married to an army man as you stated. My husband is a veteran of the Navy, you know, the branch with boats and stuff. This may come as a shock to you, but not all veterans or veterans' spouses are Republicans. I recommend you read "This We'll Defend's" blog for a view from the left and "91ghost's" blog for more of an independant view.   In my post that you commented under but did not comment on, I mentioned many blogs that I read that are all over the spectrum. Leftyjones, aka "Knight in Shining armor" and "The wind beneath my wings", is a democrat. So are Davesplash, JFM, and the already mentioned "This We'll Defend", whom I have great respect for despite the fact that he wants to impeach Bush. :)  I read lots of republican blogs too, and some by people who don't talk about their political affiliations much. I read the blogs of people who interest me, for whatever reason.   I was going to wrap up my post there, but then I popped over to read your blog. http://thisisrealpostmodern.blogspot.com Interesting stuff. From the post called  "Thru these stoned person's eyes (or lips, I guess) ".    "It is absolutely amazing how eloquent and intelligent some people can become when they are on drugs. Forget about creativity and being able to play better music and all that shit. Tooney smokes the average amount of pot for an artistic, borderline-anorexic guitarist who also chain-smokes clove cigs...it is expected and all. I guess you don't live as long when you do a lot of drugs, but music and weed sort of go together for some people. You have a life that is fast and short and vicious and uh whatever. It is probably all worth it in the end; I probably would not know, though, because I don't normally do a large amount of drugs. However, when a person who usually does "nice" drugs like pot decides to dabble in the naughty material (vair illegal but hey, this is the internet and I tell all, so let's just say this is is one of those things that come in a powder) once in a blue moon, there are sometimes different effects in addition to creativeness. People can actually get SMARTER. "   This part was fun too:   "I just read everything that I wrote. I am like the rambling-on queen of all ramblers. I will go to Rambling Heaven. Actually I don't believe in heaven, being an athiest and all. But nonbelievers go to HELL baby!!!! Or that is what all the stupid relgious people say. So I am going to hell. So I will roast in the flames and get sodomized and whatever happens when you meet Satan. I don't care, I will just seduce Satan and trick him into letting me go to that place where you sit and wait for judgement and get stoned. "   But the post that really touched me, truly touched me, was  "The elderly mad"   "I am starting to realize that, apart from my specific relatives and freinds, most older middle-aged people (as in over 50) are mostly really stupid and just not worth being around at all. When you get old, your brain gets eaten away very slowly until there is nothing left except for a feeling of weird self-confidence. There is of course the occasional nice, freindly, cultured older person who has not yet given in to the lure of Alzheimer's, but these days they all seem to be stupid bastards."   I'm sure my blog friends are reading my mind at this point.  Bush is not sending troops over to like, you know, get killed deliberately. He like, sent them over, to like, ya know, fight terrorism and like, protect you at home, so that, you can like, write crazy things on your blog and stuff.   I'm too tired and too sickly to go through the reasons I am voting for Bush instead of Kerry. Look through my past posts and the comments and maybe you'll see why. Go read some of Ala71's blog called at mobyrebuttal.blogspot.com. See TWD's or Lefty's for the other side. Do some research. Think about the things you learn. Then I'd be happy to discuss the pros and cons of political candidates and their policies with you.

      Hello, my name is Jennifer (hello Jennifer) and I have a new addiction to confess.    *cough*cough*ACHOOOOO!!!*   I'm home sick today.   I was sprawled out in bed, snuggling with my cats and trying not to cough.  Still a bit fuzzy from the niquil enduced semi-coma, something began nibbling on me. And no, it was not Crash and Missy-Mouse. It was "the call". What exactly do I mean by "the call"? I bet you guys know. You've answered "the call" too, since you are reading this.  Even in my sorry state, I dragged my arse out of bed, threw on my favorite fuzzy bunny slippers (and yes, I really do have fuzzy bunny slippers), crawled down the stairs, battled an 85 pound golden retriever for my computer chair, and turned the power on.  So here I sit, trying to form a coherent thought...but I am BLOGGING damnit. I MUST blog. If I do not, I feel deprived. Left out. My fingers itch for the feel of a keyboard. I NEED A FIX.   I have to make sure CB posted and he's ok. I look for new comments on my blog (Comments rock). I pay special attention to anything left by BigandMean (in case you missed it, he's my Dad), look for an update on MrMalcolm's cat, a comment from rheaosun or scarlotta, and see if anyone that I'm not familiar with has posted here (I LOVE NEW PEOPLE!). I have to read the latest at the Rowhouse with Rose and P and S and check out Ala71's latest masterpiece and get inspired.  91ghost's latest chapter of Cakewalk Slaughter calls me, and then I check in on his cool wife Bonnie. I seek out Lefty's latest, because he always makes me laugh, especially when I want to throttle him. I look at Adiemantus and This We'll Defend's blogs because they make me think. I have some new ones I have added to my daily mental list like Kat and Davesplash and JFM and Frater (artbyruth - you should write one too!) and the list is growing by the day. I am sure I have left someone important out, which I will blame on the niquil haze still dragging down my mental capacity.  So....My name is Jennifer (hello Jennifer), and I have replaced my ice cream addiction with a blog addiction. (Lefty, you'll have to come up with something new to tempt me with *grin*)   Now that the call of the blog has been answered, I must surrender to the call of the flu.   Until tomorrow my friends.....(or if I get up in the middle of the night like I did last weekend...).....adios.   *cough*cough*ACHOO!!!*

       1. Open a new file in your PC.  2. Name it "John Kerry."  3. Send it to the trash.  4. Empty the trash.  5. Your PC will ask you, "do you really want to get rid of John Kerry?"  6. Answer calmly, "yes," and press the mouse button firmly.  7. Feel better.....

      This is a wonderful post from one of my favorite blogs - www.mobyrebuttal.blogspot.com - by Ala71.  This eloquent post means a lot to me.      Sunday, August 01, 2004 His War: Our Soldier   FOX NEWS: ANCHOR-We are getting reports of a car bomb that has gone off in Baghdad –tentative reports say it may be in front of a Christian Church…wait we are getting the first pictures. The smoke looks very black, can this really be a car bomb or was a fuel station hit?  REPORTER-No, this is a car bomb –they have gotten very good at making them out here.  ME: That’s was CB said the other day.  HUSBAND: Yeah, I know.  SISTER: Who is CB?  ME: He’s our soldier…  Mine, justrose’s, ~Jen~’s, 91Ghost’s, EXFBonnie’s, ThisWe’llDefend’s (the list is endless)….he has become ‘our soldier’, and many of us are here because we started reading his site and ours evolved from there.   Fox News: Anchor:We are also getting reports there was a bomb in Mosul…  My heart sinks…I will be checking every hour to see if CB posted now. How did this stranger become such an important part of my life? I have been thinking about this all day as I fretted over the fact that he has yet to post at 10pm EST. What if something happened to him? How will we know? Do his parents know about the site? His wife?   No matter what our politics of origin, those of us who flock to his site -(for the most part) leave them behind there. It is a sanctuary from the vitriol. There we don’t care so much if it’s Bush or Kerry –we only care to know that he’s OK and that he continues to feed our addiction to war-real-time. Maybe somewhere deep down we all feel guilty (stateside guilt I always say)…if we read each and every day we are involved –invested even.  JUSTICE: Mom, I want to see what CB looks like.  ME: You can’t, he can’t put his picture up.  JUSTICE: You have yours there.  ME: I am not at war.  Sometimes I feel like we are all being selfish –maybe not consciously, but selfish none-the-less. We want confirmation to validate our point of view… “See he says that he is mad at Bush for stop-loss…” “No see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerry…” and so on...  I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in ‘concern’…”CB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.” In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.   ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?  DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.  ME: Read his instead then, you will love it…read his. Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in Iraq is?  DAD: What?  ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bomb….  Here is a person that I have never met…a person who has no first name…no face…yet a friend. His words have become so familiar –so anticipated. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country. A hero….yet he is often blunt, disgruntled…and human. A visitor to his site once pointed out that the ‘hawks’ were overlooking glaring signs that say, “Anti-war” –the painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompson…but I think that’s what I find so wonderful. He seems mad about the war sometimes –yet the next day touched by a gesture from a local. He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson. He comes from a republican family –yet contemplates a vote for Nader.   ME: Do you think more than one person writes CB’s page?  JUSTROSE: Why?  ME: Because he just doesn’t make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administration….  JUSTROSE: No, it’s just him…  I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism. Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion. His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.  The things that many of us say/want to say to him –“We are proud of you”, “Stay safe”, “Thank you for what you are doing”…seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blog…but I know they are all truly from each person’s heart.  There is no figuring this soldier out –and that’s why he is everyone’s soldier…he is our soldier.  *For anyone that hasn’t read CBFTW’s site –please do at http://cbftw.blogspot.com/

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's another interesting tid-bit from  http://kare11.com/news/news-article.asp?NEWS_ID=67485:  St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly broke Democratic Party ranks on Sunday to announce his support for President Bush's re-election.       "George Bush and I do not agree on a lot of issues," Kelly said in a statement. "But in turbulent times, what the American people need more than anything is continuity of government, even with some imperfect policies."       Kelly, who said he's remaining a Democrat, said the economy is going in the right direction. "There's no reason to believe a change of course will produce better or quicker results," he said.       And the mayor said the United States will bring the troops home from Iraq a lot sooner if "we don't try to bring in a whole new leadership team to run the show. We must stay the course."   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- A new terror threat in NY and DC....  Press conferences all day...  Kerry gets little to no bounce in the polls. fromNewsmax.com -  "A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Sunday shows that among likely voters, President Bush reaped a five point bounce from the Democratic confab, and he now leads Sen. Kerry, 50 to 47 percent." (Is that a death rattle I hear?)  Kerry gets dissed by Marines in a Wendys (ny post). Turns out it was a fake appearance anyway. Also from newsmax.com "When John Kerry, John Edwards and their wives descended on a Newburgh, New York, Wendys on Friday for a 'lite" lunch with the common people, it was all just a photo op. Team Kerry Edwards had already ordered their real lunches - consisting of five star gourmet food from a tony local restaurant - with instructions to have the haute cuisine ready for pick-up after the top Democrats ditched Wendy's."  (Not surprising....)  Kerry's sister is claiming then 17 year old Alexandra influenced Kerry's vote against the first Gulf War. (That's kinda scary.)  Kerry admits abortion takes a life, but remains pro-choice (huh?).  Tropical storm brewing. Those are always fun. (Not.)  The Saudi Royal Family blasts Michael Moore for making stuff up. Not that I'm a fan of the Saudis, I'm not, but that's kinda cool.  Moore also got busted on faking a newspaper front page for Farenhate 911. Also from newsmax.com - "The [Bloomington] Pantagraph newspaper in central Illinois has sent a letter to Moore and his production company, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., asking Moore to apologize for using what the newspaper says was a doctored front page in the film, the paper reported Friday. A scene early in the movie that shows newspaper headlines related to the legally contested presidential election of 2000 included a shot of The Pantagraph's Dec. 19, 2001, front page, with the prominent headline: "Latest Florida recount shows Gore won election." The paper says that headline never appeared on that day. (no surprise there)  Interesting day.
