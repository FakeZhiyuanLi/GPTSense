						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Java! & Java 2-introducing Swing!”    I am SO psyched! I totally saw this book and thought, “JAVA! Yah mon!” I went and made myself a WHOLE POT to suck down, ‘cuz this book is gonna be SO righteous! It’s got exclamation points all over it!!! And it’s by Deitel and Deitel, so to rhyme with that, they put these little beetles on the cover and they’re dancing the Swing, and I’m like suckin’ down the go juice and getting’ hyped ‘cuz I LOVE Swing and Jaz! So let’s get those hearts racin’ people! Get your jaboolies moovin and let’s SWING on into the new year!!! 	 Wait a friggin’ minute here….what the HELL? Aw man! This is the frickin’ crap my husband stares at all day long! This isn’t coffee and dancing at all! This is all (“/n/nThe +c+ / new location and radius of c ore/n” precision2.format” ) blah blah blah. It’s the same garbage that makes your brain swell like a startled blowfish and deteriorates your mind until you’re slobbering and babbling things like,  “ Must interface string volume to buffer zone.” I’ve seen it in his blank, dead eyes a thousand times. You think smokin’ crack screws up your brain? It’s got nothin’ on programming! Well this just bites. What a freakin’ let down. Now I’m all hopped up on caffeine and have to pee.  	 So today’s lesson, boys and girls, is- never marry a programmer because you’ll end up with a whole library full of books that suck. Also, they have a tendency to babble incoherent things in their sleep like, “That’s right baby…override that polymorphism!” 	 Next week we’re going to skip right over my husband’s suggestion of his all-time favorite book- “Consumer Reports 2003 Buying Guide” (I kid you not), and go on to one of “The Classics”. Maybe some Shakespeare, eh? Talk about your incoherent babbling….

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.    OK everyone, happy holidays, blah, blah, blah, whatever.( Rule # 1 in writing-set your tone right away.) This is the time of year when families come together and homicide rates double. True fact. At least in my family. If you’re one of the thousands (Oh, all right-two of you) who have begged for more of this torture, I figure there’s something wrong with you to begin with and the pressure of the holidays aint gonna make it any better. 	 So let’s get on with it. Today’s book is one of my children’s favorites: “The Mitten” by Jan Brett. This was always touted as a holiday story, but as near as I can tell, all it’s got in common with Christmas is some snow. Whatever, here goes.   A kid loses a mitten. A bunch of animals (including a bear) squish inside of it like co-eds in a phone booth. I forget why. The mitten gets all stretched out. (big surprise ending there) The end.  Seriously. I don’t make this crap up. I did, however, have a tendency to zone out a lot while reading this one for the 7-billionth time.  That’s a clever little trick Catholics know from childhood. It came in especially handy when I was reciting one of the three thousand ninety-two really long prayers that are said during the mass. I could actually be saying a prayer out loud while thinking, “ Starsky and Hutch really aren’t that hot, but man, what a cool car!” or “Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are really just a couple of DORKS!” Those are the types of revelations that came to me during mass. I am so going to hell.  	 Well people, with that in mind, let’s not forget the reason for the season…oh crap. I KNOW this one. Man! I’ve got the attention span of my dog on crack.  	 Next week-screw next week. My kid is home from school and I can’t get near the computer anyway. When we come back, maybe I’ll condense something I’ve actually read. Could happen.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 60th Edition 1979-1980, 1913 CRC Press inc. 1980 CRC Press”   Boy, they sure are hot on themselves at the CRC Press. Maybe they could get their name in the title one more time? This book is so hideously long and awful that its pages not only have numbers, they also have letters. So it goes like, C-781 and F-432 and stuff, so you can’t really tell that it’s 4 bazillion pages long! Man am I saving you time today or what? OK, so if I remember correctly, my husband bought this book when he was a high-school senior in order to impress the chicks. Right. Chicks dig geeks. Right. So that was a total waste. Far more impressive was his purchase of the book, “ The Book of Licit and Illicit Drugs”. That book was righteous. If your friends were stoned you could spout off the technical names of Bennies and Uppers and Downers or whatever you thought sounded cool at the moment. Not that we did that. Cuz we didn’t. That book isn’t even here anymore. We don’t have it, so you can just forget about my condensing it for you, and frankly I don’t like your attitude or tone of voice right now. You’re making me paranoid. Go away.   So getting back to today’s book, it has charts and junk about chemistry and physics. Oh, like you’ll ever need to know. Please. This book is, all in all, pretty worthless. Except if you have an old, green couch with one of its legs missing, then this book makes a bitchin’ and very stable wedge. Not that I’d know.   That’s this week’s Cream of Condensed Book. Maybe next week I’ll look for something with a little more holiday spirit. I found some old books in the attic with titles like, “Santa Melts the Ice Princess” and “Ho ho, ‘Ho!” and such, but I think those are mostly picture  books.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is:  ...going to be fantabulous! I found a book in my kid’s bedroom that’s going to solve the mysteries of the universe for us! True! It’s titled, “Mysteries of the Unexplained.” By the good people who bring you the Reader’s Digest, so you know it’s all true. 	 I’m not going to explain the simple things about the universe, like Dark Matter, Quantum Mechanics, String Theories, and where DOES that other sock go? That’s for poindexters and nimrods. I’m going to delve into the stuff that REALLY matters to people like us! Things like, how can you learn to play piano when you never practice, and WHY am I still paying for lessons? Or-You lost your retainer AGAIN? How long have you been without it? How did this happen? Oh my God, WHY was it in a napkin? And the truly mysterious and ever-incredible; I just cleaned this kitchen, when did the dirt-bomb go off?   Maybe it’s just me, but I want to KNOW! So let’s start some ‘splainin’! Let’s see…monsters…ghosts…bizarre wart abnormalities… 	 Oh man. Well this is just great. I’ve been seduced by a fancy title once again. Sorry people. Our hopes are once again dashed upon the slippery rocks of my own stupidity. This is just junk about the Loch Ness Monster, Big Foot and space aliens. Ok, once and for all people; Big Foot (AKA my cousin Randy) and Nessy met at a resort in the Bermuda Triangle where all the hip young aliens, poltergeists and other pan-dimensional beings go to be wined, dined and otherwise mess with the occasional small aircraft. The unfortunate result of this tryst was their rubbery love child, Bat Boy. (Who, according to “The Globe” recently led U.S. armed forces to Saddam’s stink-hole). Go team Bat Boy! If you start questioning this or think about it too hard, your brain will seize up and you’ll spontaneously combust like a koala suckin’ on a gasoline soda and lightin’ his farts. 	 So there you are. Mysteries Explained. So much for the “good” people of Reader’s Digest. I’ll never trust them with my quantum mechanics questions again! I gotta go. Another dirt bomb went off. But hey, maybe I’ll find next week’s book under the pile of rubble I call an office.

						    Today I’d like to take a moment to thank all of you who not only read this crap, but in an attempt to annoy the hell out of others, actually send this on to friends, family and co-workers. Get help man. Seriously.   But really people, your deluge of e-mails has been very flattering in a really creepy sort of way. I’m surprised that busy people who don’t even have time to read a freakin’ book have time to e-mail me and all. Especially the hundreds of you who I don’t even know! About 150 of you have alerted me to the fact that I can refinance my mortgage at the LOWEST RATE EVER! So thanks. Like I’d do anything about it, but thanks. And many of you have written to tell me that I need a larger penis to satisfy “her”, although I don’t really know who the hell “her” is. Also, I don’t have a penis, but obviously your hearts are in the right place. And the well-over 200 of you who seem to be obsessed with my losing weight “right away”, well um, all I can say to that is BITE ME. Jeez. Make me feel bad. Nice.  	 The rest of you who have threatened me with restraining orders to “cease and desist” these e-mails, c’mon man, I know you don’t really mean it. Who’s your buddy?    So today’s book is really more of a pamphlet from something called “MSN” titled, “Setting up your e-mail account.” Actually it’s been lying under this stack of papers on my dresser for about 2 years now, so I’m thinkin’ it’s probably not that important anyway. And if I have any questions, I just whine to my husband when he gets home, in that tone that hurts the fillings in his molars. He used to try to show me stuff on the computer, but apparently it’s a whole other language, and believe it or not, I don’t care about the integral workings of the piece of crap. My main system of working with the machine is this; I want to touch the clicky-thingy and it auto-magically reads my mind and does what I want. In case it “deletes” something or tries to put a hex on me or anything, I keep a sledgehammer next to its big brain-box on the floor and sporadically threaten it. Stan and I found that our differing operating techniques are not quite compatible, and do nothing for the harmony of our marriage. So now he just puts some kind of “shortcut” on the computer and tells me to leave the rest of it the hell alone.  So hey, we don’t really even need this pamphlet and can just throw it out now. Man, that is by far the best condensation ever! No words at all! Everybody wins! Sometimes I amaze even myself.   For next week, I’m just gonna keep on working on this pile, and see if we can’t condense a whole lot more of this crap down to no words at all.   And in an effort to clean up my cream of book lists, any of you who want to get off this list and on with a normal, happy life, can just reply to this with “delete me” and/or “bite me” and I’ll take you off without any form of retribution whatsoever. (yeah, right). Except for Terry T. If you think I’ve lost it before, just wait ‘till that flamin’ dog-poop baggie ends up on your doorstep!

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Ok man, you know what? I am in such a crap-tastic mood I’m not even sure I can condense a whole friggin’ book today. But since it’s just the “Pocket French-English/ English-French Dictionary” by some idiot named “Larousse”, and not really a book with sub-plots and all, I guess I can handle it. Just keep your distance, OK?  So we’ve got 390 pages, and according to the cover, “Generous coverage of idioms and grammatical constructions.” What, do they think all grammas working in construction are idiots? That pisses me off.  Let’s just find the words you’ll need if you ever find yourself stuck in France. Today’s word is: “syndrome premenstrual”. I’m pretty sure that in any situation, all you have to do is give someone “the look”(ladies, don’t forget to practice your “look” regularly when your partner says something exorbitantly stupid.) and growl, “Syndrome Premenstrual!” and they will leave you the hell alone. Make sure you say it with that “fake French” accent which is done by saying the words through the back of your throat, like a cat cacking up a hairball.  Then add a “Oui,Oui” (in English-Wee Wee). Other useful words include:  Hurt-Blesser  Choke-etrangler  Kill-Tuer  Fed up with-En avoir marre  Porcupine carcass- le carcasse porc-epic  Monkey Dung-Singe fumier  French is so totally screwed up that the word for “groin”, as in, “Don’t make me stab this fork into your groin.” is “aine”. But the word for “snout”, as in, “ Snout-faced dingo-eating waiter” is “GROIN”!  	 It’s just so frustrating that I could CRY! Let me check today’s schedule…  2:00- Piss and moan  2:10- Get really irate over sister ruining my “Malibu Barbie” in 4th grade  2:12-Call sister, forgetting both why I’m calling and WHO I’m calling  2:13-Laugh with sister and get warm fuzzys  2:15-Hang up and swear to, “Kill the bitch”  2:16-Forget who to kill and why-assume it’s husband  2:17-Become morose over those poor little elves that are being forced to bake cookies in   a hollow tree  2:19-Burst into tears because that “Subway” commercial shows such a beautiful sandwich  2:22- Attempt to get a grip by snarfing down a bag of chocolate chips and screaming, “C’mon you freakin’ endorphins! Work for Mama!”  2:25-Become sullen and miserable as I stand on the scale and watch my weight visibly go up.  2:26-Beat scale to death with a golf club  2:40-6:25-piss and moan  6:26-Give husband “the look” when he asks what the hell happened to his 9-iron   Next week-whatever. Deal with it.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is, as promised, William Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”  	 This is one of Billy’s madcap comedies. He’s got a lot of ‘em.  There’s the overly-obvious title, “A Comedy of Errors” about two sets of twins who get all mixed up and stuff. There’s “The Tempest” about a storm on an Island, which he clearly just ripped-off from “Gilligan’s Island”. “The Taming of the Shrew” about putting an uppity woman in her place-gotta love that. Then there’s “The Two Gentlemen of Verona” about…well duh.  But “ A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is by far and away the best of his comedies because very few of you have read it and will therefore have no idea if I’m lying about it or not.  	 So, in the actual dialogue of the Bard himself, I give you…”A Midsummer Night’s Dream”  LYSANDER- Hermia!You are babe-o-licious!  HERMIA-Cha!  DEMETRIUS- Totally!  HELENA- Like chill on that biatch Demetrius! “Hermia”…more like Her-N-ia with that chunk-a-booty she hauls around! I am all that and a bag of chips!  DEMITRIUS-So you are,Helena!  SNUG- (to BOTTOM and SNOUT) Dudes! Your names are “Bottom” and “Snout”! I’m gonna blow a wad laughin’!  SNOUT- Dude, your name is “SNUG” so like, don’t cop a righteous ‘tude dude. 		 THE END   So all’s well that ends well. No wait, that’s another comedy. Or maybe it’s a tragedy. I never really get what the hell Bill is saying with all his “thou for” and “where goest” and “yea thy sallow visage”. Why can’t he just say, “Man, you look sick” I mean, is that really so hard? Jeez, no wonder the English is a dead language. 	 Next week, since English went and committed suicide out in “The Valley”, Cha! Let’s delve into the French Handbook. Au Revoir!

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is a children’s book: “Everyday Science Experiments in the Backyard” By: John Daniel Hartzog   Oh pu-leez! Like kids have time to read a BOOK before they go out to destroy the yard? I got a science question for ya- how many dog turds can pile up before the yard becomes a superfund site? Or let’s find out- if we throw all the sand out of the sandbox, will it kill ALL the grass or will there be 2 blades left standing? How about my family’s favorite experiment, sort of the “Pavlov’s Dog” test for the world’s dumbest dog- if we leave the gate open, will the dog escape or just go out and crap in the driveway?   Here’s a good one for those of you who’ll be in the same house for several years: take every bike you’ve ever owned and lean them up against the deteriorating swing set. Don’t forget to lay one down in the half-filled, cracked wading pool that lies at the bottom of the broken, jagged slide. Now see how long it takes the collection to corrode and fuse into one giant, metallic work of art. Try to sell it to your local arts commission.   For those of you living in the arctic wastelands of the North, have your kids build one of those cute little snowmen in the front yard. Now see how long it takes before it starts to melt into a hideously mutated “Freddy-esque” burn-victim creature. Remind the kids constantly that, “Frosty came alive you know.” Calculate the cost of their psychiatric treatments.   One of my favorite wintertime experiments was always, “Will a snow fort with no visible means of roof support, cave in and kill us all?”   Or the ever popular, “If my arm “accidentally” launches this snowball in a direct trajectory to your head, how long will I be grounded for, and what’s the ratio of that time to the millisecond of joy derived from the action? Is the equation irrelevant since the snowball has already left my hand?    I hardly think kids need any more encouragement. I’m dumping this book right into the circular file bin where it can’t do any damage. Kids and science- just say “No”.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s selection is entitled: “Robot Building for Dummies” (seriously) By: Roger Arrick   OK…I’m not really certain how to even BEGIN to mock this. (Or, rather, condense this.)  Yes. If you’re a “dummy” I’m pretty sure that you aren’t thinking,  “I say. I could really use a robot. By Jove, why don’t I just build one? Oh golly, I guess I should have paid more attention during those cybernetics courses I took. And I’m beginning to really regret skipping so many of my atomic circuit board lessons. I know. I’ll just pick up a “dummy” book.”    No, it’s more like,  “Hey, Skeeter! I dun think Mama’s gone to that big trailer park in the sky ‘cuz I keep pokin’ her with the cattle prod an she still ‘aint moved in 3 weeks! We need one a them there metal men to cook up that possum afore it dun gits rank. Why don’t we fetch us that there “dummy” book an make us one!”    Hell-O! Because you’re a DUMMY! Jeez.   Dummies like me are going, “Robot? Oh that’s just great. Because I’m already picking up after a slew of LIVING beings, why don’t I just start cleaning up nuts and bolts too?” How about having something besides the dog’s ass that will leave snail trails across the floor? I really need yet ANOTHER machine for my husband to “work on” all weekend because the cars and computers aren’t enough. Oh that’d be great…  “Honey, I’ll be down in the lab creating simulated life! Call me when dinner’s ready, OK”?   Sure baby.   If you’re dumb enough to think a robot will make your life easier, you’re definitely too dumb to build one.   This “dummies” thing has just gone too far. It’s getting cruel. What book am I going to find next? “Illiteracy for Dummies”, with the audio version for the deaf? Or the audio version read by Sally Struthers for the blind? What the hell? What about “How to make it in Politics for Dummies”. No, wait, that’s required reading.   Next week, “Picking your crap up off the Floor for Dummies”. If I get it written in time.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “How to Give a Damn Good Speech” by: Philip R. Theibert   Well this better be a damn good book what with the damn swearing in the damn title and all. We never swears ourselves. Whoa, that was a bit Gollum-esque. Never mind that it’s a damn lie.   Anyhow, if your gonna give a speech to a lot of people, you should speak loud enough that your voice bores an imaginary hole in the back wall of the room.    In high school, one thing I learned vicariously through a particularly severe stoner buddy of mine (his motto-“That’s why they call it “HIGH” school man!”) was not to get stoned then try to speak. Because one time while he was giving a speech, he was hallucinating that he was actually drilling that hole, (which pleased him immensely because of the vandalism aspect), but he was suddenly distracted, and finishing half a sentence, he squinted out at the audience and whispered, “Was I just talking reeeeeally loud?” Then he fell to the floor laughing hysterically and wet himself. Ok, so he didn’t really wet himself, but this is MY story damn it, and I can remember it any way I choose.   So don’t get stoned before a speech. Unless your Hunter Thompson or Woody Haralson, in which case it’s just sort of expected. And don’t get all whacked out about pronouncing things correctly. If our President doesn’t have to, why should you? Also, if you get flustered, don’t flail your arms and legs around in an attempt to get the audience to focus elsewhere. It just doesn’t work. Trust me.   Don’t imagine everyone naked either. Real people are gross when they’re naked, and it just freaks you out and makes you queasy. Especially if like, your Grandma’s out there or something.   It helps to speak in the language of the audience and not in Klingon or Elvish. (A mistake made by many a novice speech-team member.) And finally, if all those people make you nervous, just look directly at one person and talk solely to him. Stare without blinking; make him squirm until he starts to cry. Kill him softly with your song.   Well damn! That really wasn’t very good, but I’m sure it was a hell of a lot more useful than anything you’ll find in a damn book. Damn Right!   Next week will be one damn thing or another!

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Pleasure of Finding Things Out” By: Richard Feynman   Well I’m pretty sure this guy is starting out with a grammatastically incorrect title. You can’t end a sentence with a proposition see. ‘Cuz of the conjugation of the carburetor. In writing class, you find stuff like this out.   I don’t know about you, but my personal experience with “finding things out”, has always been far from pleasant. Starting with “finding out” that my mother’s 6th pregnancy meant she’d be bringing home yet another baby, and not a puppy at all. Or “finding out” that sweet, succulent, delicious lobsters are actually the bottom-feeding centipedes of the ocean.  Then there’s the time that I “found out” my taillight was burned out and my tabs were expired. Maybe it was a pleasure for the nice officer, but for me--not so much.  How about “finding out” that your kid has put a dent in the car. Then “finding out” that by “dent” they mean, “sheered off the entire front fender”. Or “finding out” that the best party ever thrown was at your house.   While you were out of town.   I mean, “finding out” about your partner always means that they’re cheating or gay. Or both.  And “finding out” that you don’t like a certain food is always done the hard way. Same with going on that very expensive cruise just to “find out” that you’re heavily prone to seasickness. Or “finding out” those lifeboats only hold 20 people by being number 21 in line. Surprise!  What the Hell? I think this Feynman guy is one shanker shy of a cold sore. I think we should all just stop finding stuff out about other stuff. That’s why you read THIS stuff, right?   OK, so next week, I don’t know what our book will be, but I guess I’ll go find out.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Mushroom Cookbook and Primer” By: Amy Farges   Whao! This book is just sitting in an actual public library!  Well not anymore. I brought it home.  But I’m like, what if kids got a hold of this man? Like MY kids. This could do some serious damage! I mean, what’s next? The Hophead Cookbook? The Magic Brownie Recipe Cook-off? The Toad Licker’s Manual?  I looked. Couldn’t find any.  But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t out there man!  	 Ok, well let’s just flip through and see if there’s anything we don’t already know. Uh, as usual, you people need to just settle down there and not get yer undies in a bunch. Seems that Amy here wants you to eat only the NORMAL mushrooms.   I knew that.   Like Morels or buttons or those ones they keep saying are “meaty” but when you cook them they’re really not so much “meaty” as “slimy”. Some of the pictures in here look vaguely like cow dung. I’m pretty sure that even if you were higher than Jerry Garcia on Mount Everest, you wouldn’t want to eat this stuff. I’m gonna be sick. 	 To each his own. That’s what I always say. I mean, if “your own” happens to be this stuff, then you’ve got some real problems, but hey, I don’t gotta live with ya. Viva La Mushroom, man. That’s what I always say. Viva la slippery, rubbery fungus. You do know they call them toadstools, right? And that fairies dance around them during the full moon. But that doesn’t make them vaguely eerie or anything. No, that’s cute. Like leprechauns aren’t shrunken mutants whose skin has turned green, first from eating mushrooms and then dancing around them until they hurl. Not at all.  	 Ok. I’m done. This book goes back to the library TONIGHT! It’s a lot more dangerous than I thought.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Pressured Cook” By: Lorna Sass   ‘Scuse me. Aren’t we all?   Well that was easy. Maybe next week I should try some of the other cookbooks. Maybe I should look for “The Steamed Cook”, “The Pickled Cook” or “The Fried Cook”. How about “The Stewed Cook” or “The Sauced Cook”? Maybe there’s one made just for me called, “The Bitchy Cook”. Why are so many words for cooking also words for inebriated? Think about it. 	 How about “The Low Fat, Low Cal, Low Cholesterol, Low Sodium, High Fiber, High Vitamin, Vegetarian, Incredibly Delicious, Totally Satisfying, Easy to Make, 365 Different Meals Cook Book”? No? There isn’t one? Huh. Real surprise there. Since I can’t even find a SINGLE recipe like that. 	 And yet we have the low-carb, high-meat, heart-attack friendly cookbook. We have the vegetarian-everything tastes like overcooked baby food and aardvark snot cookbook. There’s all those deep-fried Fatty McLardass cookbooks. And the “Be a Chocoholic Choco-Addict Who’d Sell Her Living Soul for a Dove Bar You Weak, Worthless, Vile, Choco-Whore” cookbook.   Or maybe that’s just me. 	 What was I going off about now? How I hate to cook? How I’m on a diet? Whatever. I’m off to the kitchen for a rice cake or perhaps a piece of chalk if I can find one. You’re on your own.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Vegetarian Pleasures” By: Jeanne Lemlin    Right. This is the best oxymoron I’ve come across since, “jumbo shrimp”, “military intelligence” and “management support”.   I’ve been easing into vegetarianism for a while now. By “easing into” what I really mean is that I save a chunk of my steak for tomorrow instead of snarfing it all down in one sitting. Hey, I figure I’ve already saved the life of half a cow this way, so idle on back people.  It’s not like I don’t try. We went down to chicken and fish, but my kids kept looking at their plates in confusion and saying, ”Where’s the bloodied animal flesh?”  So I got rid of the kids.   OK, I didn’t “get rid” of them as much as they “moved out”.   Mostly.   Boxes of their crap still lurk mysteriously in the basement and the closets. But the kids insist they’ve moved on and have their own places, so I only feed them once a week or holidays or whenever I find them hanging out in my kitchen looking like starving dingoes left to waste away in the Nairobi Desert. ‘Cuz, what the hell, I did give birth to them, and apparently after that the law says you have to care for them or something.  So I’ve still got a freezer full of raw meat, mostly for my youngest who apparently was either a T-rex or a lioness or some other meat-devouring carnivore in her former life. ‘Cuz man, if she doesn’t get in some sort of mammal-flesh on a daily basis, that kid gets edgy.   So anyway, the vegetarian thing isn’t going real well, and quite frankly, the recipes for Dried Kelp Burgers, Seaweed Dijon and Rubber McTofu Delight really leave something to be desired. Let’s just say I have yet to find the “pleasure”.   Well, I’m off to raid the freezer, anyone have a good recipe for half a cow on a spit?

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “You CAN say NO to your teenager”   By: Jeanett Shalov, M.S., Irwin Sollinger PhD, Jules Spotts PhD, Phyllis S Steinbrecher M.A., Douglas W Thorpe M.S.    Ok, after I quit laughing, I realized that it took 5 Doctors of varying degrees to tell me I can say, “No” to my kids. Hell, I can say, “Purple dingo snarks are plorging in the Oggle Shlepps.” And I get the same reaction as “no”.  Which is none at all.   I’ve taken to dying my hair pink, wearing neon-plaid army boots and a tutu, and my kids still don’t acknowledge my existence, much less anything that might be gurgling from my kid-damaged brain.   It’s a well-known fact that it’s your teenager’s sole and sacred responsibility to be completely and totally non-reactive to anything you say or do. This takes a great deal of concentration, determination and fortitude on their part. From the age of 13 on, they practice daily, harder and harder, ever advancing in their ability to look at you blankly and say, “Huh?” in that one singular tone that shoots to the core of your brain and infuriates you so completely that you temporarily go blind with rage.   They attend meetings with friends, work on pitch and range of voice, staring without blinking, eye rolling and the ever-important total void of facial expression. Botox was created just so we ancients could get that look back again.  I’m sure this book has all kinds of contradictory advice like, “Be Firm but fair. Be tough but tender. Be strong but soft.” What, are we paper towels here?  My advice to you, dear reader, is when your kid turns 16, say, “Happy birthday honey!” Give them a kiss, turn around and run like hell. And I’m not even a PhD.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:    Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Six Stages of Parenthood” By: Ellen Galinsky   ***If you’re at all squeamish, skip the very unpleasant part with the warning stars. ***		  Let me just give you a quick run through here of 6 ACTUAL stages of parenthood, and not some snibbling crap about respect and sensitivity.   #1-I like to call, “Disillusioned Idiots.”  These are the young people who think babies are adorable and that having a child will somehow “complete” them. Hey, if ya got chunks missing, an infant isn’t going to fix it. Get “complete” first, because a baby is about to shatter your world. Do you like shopping, eating out, time with your spouse, a clean house, unstained clothes, sleep, sanity or a modicum of dignity? Then babies aint for you.   #2 -Yippee, we’re PREGNANT idiots!  WE aren’t anything. Until the guy lugs 30 pounds of potatoes in a front pack for 9 months, ingests syrup of ipecac 3 times a day and finally *** without anesthetic, has his rectum slit open to his testicles and it doesn’t matter because he’s in such excruciating pain anyway, that he can’t tell the difference, *** until that day, WE aren’t pregnant.  The WOMAN is. I’ve got issues. So sue me.   #3  -Let’s just call #3 “Puke” and leave it at that.   #4  -The flip-flop.  Wherein this incredible miracle, your beautiful, amazing bundle of sweet precious life stirs your heart to the very depths of your soul. Punctuated at 3 AM by the pooping, barfing, screaming, demonic creature from Hell, which makes you certain Damien is alive and has possessed your child.   #5   -You’re an idiot, I’m an idiot, we’re all idiots. This happens at some time in your child’s adolescence. You will know the moment. You will see the belligerent look in their eyes. A flash of sheer hatred right before – for girls- they scream, “You’re ruining my life! I hate you!” then they run to their room and slam the door. And -for boys- they growl, “Fine!” Then they storm to their room and slam the door. 	 For girls, this is where the screaming begins. It ends when they move out and need money. Then it’ll be, “Daddy, I love you soooo much!” 	 For boys, this is the last speck of emotion you’ll get from this stone. It ends the day they turn 34 and you ask if they want a beer. They’ll say, “Sure. Thanks.” Revel in this moment of overwhelming sentiment and appreciation. He’s a guy now. Get over it.   #6  -Babbling, incoherent old idiot.  YOU think you reach this parenting stage at age 85. Your KIDS think you hit it the day you sat down with them and tried to give them the talk about sex.  	 For those of you who are all smug and feeling safe right now because you don’t have kids- next week- DOGS!

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: Skill Assessment Guides By: Various idiots getting paid too much to think up stupid questions.   Well these things are just totally bogus. My kids have them lying around because they’ve come to that point in their college careers where they have to declare a major or declare they’ll be “Professional College Students”. You know, those 30-somethings hanging around campus in their hideously outdated sweaters and kakis, still living with their mothers, taking a class now and again to justify their existence at the college. No spouse, no family, no job… those clever BASTARDS! 	 Anyway, my kids took these tests and figured out their mom would kill them if they chose “Professional Student”, so they decided on other things, and are getting on nicely with their lives. 	 I took one to see if I could decide what I should be when I grow up. No rush. I’m only 42 and still have plenty of time to work it out- but I thought, “what the hey”. 	 So basically, you answer a wad of stupid questions, most of which begin with, “Would you like…” As in, “Would you like to clean up elephant dung?” “Would you like to get your eyes clawed out by feral monkeys?” “Would you like the opportunity to see ‘Clowns get theirs, man!’?” (Well duh- who wouldn’t). This, by the way, is the ONLY question on the test I replied “yes” to.   Then Circus Freak it is, people! 	 Or, if you can answer “yes” to these questions- 	 Are you missing most of your teeth? 	 Do you urinate in public? 	 Do you have a criminal background? 	 Do you have a not-so-secret desire to annoy, offend or destroy humanity?  Then you should apply for Carnie Worker! Although closely related to Circus Freak, it’s apparently a whole other “profession”. 	 As it turns out, other than clown eradication, I have no desire to do anything. I figure it’s because I’ve already done everything. Seamstress, daycare, construction, cashier,receptionist, restaurant manager, artist, other than prostitute, if you get paid for it, I’ve done it and I’ve ended up hating it. So I answered, “no” to “Would you like…anything” and got the lowest score in the history of assessment tests. 	 Somewhere in the very back of the pamphlet it told me to, “Lay down and die then you crabby bitch!” Which I’m pretty sure they’re not supposed to do, but there you are. 	 So if you come across any of these pamphlets, just chuck ‘em in the trash. Whatever you do for money doesn’t define who you are anyway. “Who you are” is buried in your heart, your soul, and the joy you find with your loved ones. And we all know, deep down inside, we’re all “Circus Freaks” anyway. So just relax about the whole “career” thing and have a nice day.

						   Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Dictionary” By: A bunch of guys   I know you’re all thinking, “Whoa, what kind of lazy-ass crap is this? What? Did she sit down at her desk, take a big slug of nasty, day-old coffee, spew it back out all over the piles of junk lying everywhere, and as she was cleaning off the dictionary said, ‘Good enough.’?” 	 I just don’t know where you people get this stuff. My intense research often requires me to get out of bed. And sometimes even to get dressed.  So today, (as my mother would say) you’ll get the dictionary and you’ll like it! 	 I myself hate it. I can’t spell worth beens. This is definitely a disadvantage in writing. First my spell-check nicely highlights everything in red, just as a little, “Ha, Ha. You must be a bit bleary-eyed today! Let me just ‘remind’ you how to spell ‘anaconda’.” So I go in and let it re-spell the word for me in whatever bizarre ancient-Grecian way its “suppose” to be spelled, then it asks to re-check my entire document.   “NO!”  I’m always emphatic about this because checking my whole document means half a day of this insidious machine highlighting every word. It laughs at me with it’s little bell and says, “Did you mean…anthrax/antelope/anomaly?”   “NO!”   Then we argue for a bit, going back and forth until the spell check starts to get angry, its bell starts to “gong” in a “WRONG” sort of tone, then it starts running out of words and asks things like, “Is it animal, vegetable or mineral? Is it bigger than a breadbox? Do you speak-a-da-ENGLISH?” Then it starts to throw off sparks and smoke and we both give up and I’m forced to turn to the PAPER Dictionary. Which, as it turns out, is only good for people who know how to SPELL! And why else would you look up a word? To find it’s meaning? Puh-leez!  	 So then I’m stuck going through all of the “A’s”- A-N-A, A-N-N-A, A-N-H-A… then I forget for a while what the word was in the first place. Then I pretend I’m not even really looking at the dictionary. I put it down and pretend I’m looking over THERE somewhere, while I’m really looking at it out of the corner of my eye. Then suddenly I pounce on it and we wrestle, with me screaming, “Give me my word dammit!” Then I chuck it into the corner of the room where it lies deviously with its vile pages rustling fiendishly at me. Laughing. Always laughing…. 	 Then I call my husband and ask him how to spell the word and he informs we it’s with an “O” or something incredibly stupid, and it’s not the dictionary’s fault, really. So I pick it up, throw it back on my desk and say, “Well alright, THIS time you can stay, but you better just watch yourself mister!” 	 So if I were you, I wouldn’t even bother getting a dictionary because they really aren’t good for anything as far as I can tell, and they’re also made of pure, refined evil. 	 All right, I’ve got coffee I have to soak up before it oozes down into the keys here, and geez, I’d really hate for it to disengage my spel-chek.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Seven Worst Things Parents Do” By: John C Friel PhD and Linda D Friel MA   First and foremost, the worst thing ANYONE can do is work with their spouse like these two yokels have. I have a friend who worked with her husband in an office run by him, and frankly, it came down to one too many eye-rolls on his part coupled with, “It’s OK, honey.” Done in that “You stupid b**ch” tone. 	 She says the 10 to 20 she’s doing now is a freakin’ cake walk, comparatively speaking. Plus she gets 3 squares a day and never has to hear, “Oh, did I say THIS?” Because I meant THAT.” (And you should have picked up on that with your psychic powers.) So parents, just say “No” to working together.  	 #2 worst thing parents do: talking and #3-dressing like your kid.  There’s nothing as bad as a 45 year old mom standing in front of her kid and his friends, wearing baggy pants that are falling off her butt, revealing her iguana boxers; her hands flailing about in mock gang signs saying to her son, “Yo, Yo, Yo! What’s which your ugly voo doo, Neegro?” And they’re both white. This kid has just died a thousand deaths and has retained the legal justification to divorce his mother.  	 Just as bad is the ex-cheerleader mom, who still fits into her high-school uniform, her hair in ponytails, saying to her daughter, Brittany Bambi Von Bumblebee II, “When are OUR friends getting here for the sleepover? I am so totally psyched!” This type of Mom-friend needs to be placed in the psyche ward and left there without access to her botox, chemical peels and personal trainer until she’s hopelessly old and fat like the rest of us. 	 #4- using your kid’s knick name, “Little Pooper” in front of his friends. Resist the urge. Kids can and will shoot powerful hate-rays from their eyes. 	 #5- that licking your thumb to clean their face thing. What? Are we baboons here? 	 #6- showing any form of dislike for the boyfriend/girlfriend. I’m not certain of the mathematical formula, but it goes something like this. Your disdain for the child’s date is immediately transferable into length of time the child will go out with this person. Therefore/ greater hatred (> H) = longer time (>t) dated L. If you feign disinterest, they will break up tomorrow. 	 #7-three words- plaid peddle pushers. Mom-I’m looking at you here. 	 Now there’s just so many other things parents do wrong, starting with the skewed notion at conception that this tiny human will love, adore and obey you; right on up to when they accidentally spill your cremains onto a huge gut pile at the after-funeral kegger they’re holding up at your cabin which they now own and are destroying, that this list could go on to infinity. So my advice is to skip the books (like you have time to read anyway) suck it up and get on with it already. Your kids are here to hate you. Get over it.  	 Now, has anyone seen my iguana boxers?

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.  Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Sleepwalker’s Son” By: Bill Meissner   Hey! My kid can totally relate to this one! When He first moved back in with us, we shoved him into the room next to the refrigerator because we figured it would save time all the way around. Unfortunately that room had already been my office/art room for 3 years.  As it turns out, I’m a sleepwalker. No one in my family knew before because I only plod about the house at approximately 2 AM and I only rummage around for things I truly need at that hour of the morning. Things like paintbrushes, acrylics and drawing charcoal. Unfortunately, all these items used to be housed in what was now my kid’s bedroom.  So there I’d be, muttering obscenities about easels and paints and my kid would wake up shouting and swinging because there was an intruder in his room. This would wake me up, shouting and swinging because as far as I knew I was in my bed and there was an intruder in my room who was shouting and swinging at me. After brief coronaries on both our parts, we’d both go, “What the HELL?” and I’d sheepishly go back to bed.  Then there was the night (true story here) that I was sick with a high fever, so I wasn’t so much sleepwalking as I was deliriously stumbling around. What I remember was going out to the hall and looking down the flight of stairs to the refrigerator, which was magically a half-mile away from me. Crap. I knew I didn’t want to walk all that way, so thankfully a very small yellow and black checked VW Beetle pulled up beside me.  This “taxi” was about 3’ tall and 6’ long with a convenient sun roof, so when I walked directly through it, my torso stuck up through the roof without any problem at all. The cabbie then “drove” me down to the fridge where he patiently waited for his money.   Unfortunately, I had no money in my pajamas, but I was sure Kris would, being the money-conscious kid he was. So I went in his room, knelt down beside his bed and whispered,  “Kris. Pssst- Kris.”  He woke up, a little startled.  “Kris, I need money for the cab.”  “What?” He seemed slightly confused.  “I didn’t bring any money and I need it for the cab.”  I nodded my head towards the open door where I could still clearly see the cabbie waiting for me. I smiled at the guy. Gave a little “Be right with ya” wave. Kris looked at the door. He looked at me.  “Right. Money for the cab…right.” He sat up and hung his head, just another night in the loony bin.   “C’mon Mom. Let’s go.” He took my elbow so he could lead the loony back to her ward, but the cabbie was right there, man,  “ He’ll SEE us stiffing him!” I protested.  “ I took care of it, Mom. Gave him a huge tip.”  That’s my son…so generous to the nice imaginary cabbie.   Kris has moved out since then. I’m sure it’s got nothing to do with his lack of sleep from episodes of giant iguanas and huge, hairy spiders the size of dinner plates. And I’m sure this book is just fine. But if you want the inside scoop, I suggest you ask the real sleepwalker’s son. Just grab the first invisible taxi you see and greet Kris at his door with a pleasant, “I need money for the cab.” And  just see if he doesn’t break down sobbing.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: Haunted Houses: Chilling Tales From American Homes By: Nancy Roberts   OK. Confession time. My house is haunted. Now I seriously considered not sharing this with the rest of the world, as all of you will think I’m nuts. But it’s just you people, and like you don’t already? Puleez! Like your perception of me could be any lower, and like I give a damn. So here goes.   The guy who built my house lived here for 7 years before keeling over from a massive coronary at his office one night. He was 40-something and I’m convinced that he was so stressed out about how cheaply he had built this place, and how it might actually come crashing down on his family during the next strong wind, that he just couldn’t take it any more. So, “urk” and he’s dead.   Now when I say the place is “haunted” by him, people are like, “Do your walls bleed?” Cuz that would be really cool and all, but no, they don’t. Scary books such as “The Amityville Horror” which I speed-read in one sitting on a summer day long ago, have you thinking that your tap water turns to blood and your pipes become serpents that snake around your ankles while you’re sitting on the toilet in the middle of the dark night to pull you down through a sudden Hells-mouth that has appeared in your bathroom floor. Right. I’d have to say that’s a slight exaggeration for the sake of book sales. Here’s how a real “haunting” goes:  Late one night, when everyone’s in bed, I see a man with very ugly hairy legs and a plaid bathrobe scrounging around the closet looking for his Polo shirt. Wait, there’s more. He’s a guy. He can’t find it. He dissolves into the blackness. Ooooh. Got chills yet? Ok, there’s the dark and not very stormy night at all, that my husband lies snoring next to me. The toilet seat falls, crashing down onto the rim! I’m startled. It falls again! What the hell? It falls a third time and I yell at the ghost, “Knock it OFF!” (I’m tired, it’s the middle of the freakin’ NIGHT man!) He cuts it out.   Then there’s the turning on of the sports channel! That’s not really a terribly good story thought. Or the random opening of the two different garage doors! Yeah, now that I come to tell it, it’s just not that fascinating. Oh wait, there’s that one time he was sweeping up behind me in the workshop, and when I turned around, NO ONE WAS THERE! Well, that just kind of pissed me off though cuz I thought maybe I wouldn’t have to clean up, but he just really did a half-ass job at sweeping and I had to clean up after him anyway.   So in my experience, real hauntings are done by real guys who can’t find stuff, are trying to go to the can, want to watch the tube and are just kind of in the way and not really helping to clean up or anything. Some things never change. Freaky? Disturbing? No. Annoying? Yes. I’ve gotten to the point where I just yell at him, “You’re DEAD ya know.” In that tone that says, “Can’t you do ANYTHING right?” Which is probably how his wife used to talk to him, so I guess he finds it comforting or some damn thing.   Maybe the stories in this book are told a lot better or other people get to live over a Hells-mouth or maybe their ghosts are interesting or something. I think I’ll try to find a particularly gruesome passage and leave it open and maybe my guy will read it because it WOULD be cool to see the walls bleed JUST ONCE! But I’m NOT cleaning it up!

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Habits of wealth” By: Bill Byrne   If you bought this book, I think you just got “Byrned”! Oh man, that was bad. I just can’t help myself sometimes.   OK, habit #1, never buy a book when you can get it, or one just like it, at the library. If you can’t find this book, there’s a whole shelf of these money books out there. Hell, you could probably make money by getting a bunch of them at the library and then selling them yourself on a street corner. Although I think libraries tend to frown on that sort of thing. Also, people don’t usually buy books on the street. That’s mostly drugs and prostitutes. And if you’ve got drugs and prostitutes then I’m pretty sure you’ve got some habits other than wealth that need taking care of first. Or if you’re just SELLING the drugs and prostitutes, then you’re probably already pretty wealthy and don’t need me or anyone else telling you what your habits should be. Even though most of your habits currently entail keeping the gun loaded and the IRS off your back, I’m sure you’ve got it all worked out.   Right. So for the rest of us poor saps, I guess you’re suppose to save some money and invest it in weasel pelts or something, even though you haven’t got a single extra cent. Cut back on the weed people. Or sell Grandma’s walker. C’mon man, you know she’s just gonna fall down anyway, why prolong the agony? What about the kids? Can they walk yet? Do they have jobs? So there are labor laws here, send ‘em to China! The key to wealth is creativity! Is the price of dairy going up? Beer’s cheap! The cost of food getting you down? Cigarettes suppress the appetite! There are plenty of habits out there if you just look hard enough. You can’t just sit back on the welfare dime and wait for the trickle-down theory to kick in. That’s MY gig! Get your own!   Good enough. My current habit is napping. It not only expends almost zero energy on my part, thereby conserving both food and fuel, but it also makes me pretty much totally inaccessible to my readers. Creativity people. Embrace the concept.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Cats and the Law” (serious cat laws from various states)  By: Anmarie Barrie Esq.   First off, I can’t stand it when people don’t spell their names right. You don’t see me spelling my name Pawlein Slypork do ya? This is because it’s pretentious and does some mighty screwing with my spell-check. Second- ESQUIRE? If ya got an Esquire at the end of your name, shouldn’t you be doing something better with your time than looking up laws for CATS? Like working at the UN saving humanity, or growing truffles or creating a fine wine that’s reasonably priced or something?   Anyway, Auntmarie here has taken what must have been a vast amount of time to research actual laws regarding cats. Most of these have to do with leash laws, which means you’re suppose to keep your cat on a leash whenever you let the happy little tabby outside. Right. What Andymarine has failed to recognize is that it’s a CAT! Have you ever tried to tie a cat to ANYTHING? And if you have, have you recovered your eyesight yet, and when do they think the claw marks will heal?   I suppose Arniemary would tell you that the law says if you can’t leash your kitty, you shouldn’t let it outside. Once again, right. I have a friend who’s cat mewled so much and so often that she finally put it on Prozak. And this cat was let outside on a regular basis! Can you imagine an outdoor cat being kept in? You’d have a ferocious tigress on your hands! It would skulk on top of cupboards, crouching in wait for you to come through the back door. Its tail twitching in anticipation of the moment you’d walk into the kitchen so it could lunge for the back of your neck, lacing you open as it razored its way down your back, catapulting off your butt and pouncing out the quickly closing door like a convict escaping on the last boat out of Alcatraz.   And let’s just say that you’re able to keep Fluffy inside. Cats get even. Love that new $957 dollar comforter you just bought? The only question the Fluffster has is, “Should I shred it, spray on it or both?” If you were thinking the Fluffmeister is going to cough up a nasty hairball on it, you’re wrong. He’s saving that for the Persian rug.   I’ll bet Alicemoira’s cats are great law-abiding animals. They probably don’t lurk under the couch until she walks by and then bat at her ankles. They probably EAT their cat food instead of sniffing at it in confusion, like she’s just served them jagged glass and gravel. I’m sure they use the litter box for it’s intended purpose instead of peeing just outside of it and then kicking all the litter out with their hind legs as though it’s an Olympic shot-put event where the farthest pebble wins. They don’t claw up the couch, hiss at her boyfriend and they come when they’re called. And maybe, right at this moment, monkeys are flying out of her butt.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Cream of Book is by:  John M Simon, DVM, with Stephanie Pedersen Titled: “What your dog is trying to tell you.”   “I have to pee.” “Feed me.”   There, I just saved you 200 some pages of boring doggy psychobabble. Like dogs have psyches. Puh-leez! I’ve seen spiders with more complex thought processes. At least THEY have to spin a web. Dogs are the village idiots of the animal kingdom.  Dogs, when left to their own devices, will eat their own poop. They will bark endlessly at individual molecules of air. They roll around in road-killed skunk, and then come home to please you with the scent.  I’ve seen my dog dig at the middle of a cement sidewalk as though it’s the entrance to a hidden Aztec temple. Then, in a sudden moment of brilliance, when she realizes there’s nothing there, she’ll dart off to dig up some freshly planted flower bulbs. I’ve seen her become startled by her own fart and growl at her butt. She chases cars by getting IN FRONT of them. She barks at waves on the beach and tries to bite them. Then she gets upset and rolls around endlessly because she hates being wet. Then she barks at the waves again and tries to bite them. Dogs eat DOG FOOD! How bright can they be?   For those of you who insist your precious puppy can converse, here are some of the basic doggie communication techniques and what they mean:    When your dog wags his tail and is excited to see you, he’s telling you,  “ I peed on the rug while you were gone!” or   “I chewed up all of your shoes for you!” or   “In the two seconds you were out, I miraculously got the hot dish off the counter, ate it all and horked it up on the rug!” or just plain,  “How are you? I’m an idiot!”   There’s also the “invisible intruder” frozen stance with the low growl. This means,  “I’ve got you in my sights. If you move I WILL kill you.” (Very threatening when it’s coming from a 10 lb poodle.)  It happens to be the same all-purpose stance used for the invisible squirrel, the invisible rottweiler, invisible alligators, invisible aardvarks and, the ever-popular invisible aliens. This is always followed by a series of endless hysterical barking that finally calls me to the front door so I can yell,  “There’s nothing out there you idiot!” At which point my dog wags her tail to say,  “I know.” and comes inside and goes back to her bed in the front hall closet to go to sleep. But first she looks up at me and thinks, “You idiot.” Just to be fair, next week-CATS!

						      Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Dark Plums”    By: Maria Espinosa                  I’m not sure why this title caught my eye. I’m not sure why this book exists. Why not light plums? Why plums at all? What’s the matter with a nice cumquat or a light palmagranite? Why does my spell check hate the word “palmagranite”?   There’s just too many questions surrounding this book, and frankly it’s pissing me off. So let’s just go on to some other book.                  Today’s book is: “All the Women of the Bible”     By: some guy.  Mary. The other Mary.                Ok. Now I kinda feel like I’m ripping you off. So Let’s try another one-                  “Unfinished Tales”    By: J.R.R. Tolkien  Uh yeah. They aren’t really finished yet, so maybe we should just wait till he’s done.                  “Dune”    By: Frank Herbert.  Ever seen a bunch of sand?                  “1984” By: George Orwell  We all lived through that year. Nothin’ to write home about, much less a whole book.                  “Fahrenheit 451” By: Ray Bradbury  Apparently paper spontaneously combusts at this temperature. Hope I didn’t ruin the ending for ya.                  “Slan” By: A.E.van Vogt  I thought this said “Stan” and was about my husband. But it wasn’t.                Alrighty then. That’s 7 books. That should hold you over for a while. I’m just glad that I can be the fountain of knowledge that satisfies your thirst for wisdom. Next week, a book about pot roast.

						    &nbsp;Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.  &nbsp;   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is:&nbsp; "A Short Guide to a Happy Life"  By: Anna Quindlen  &nbsp;   I don’t really need this book as I’ve already got a plan to my happy life. First I’m going to write this really great novel. Not THE great American novel as that’s been done to death and every writer says that’s their plan. So screw that. This is just going to be a really great book about life or maybe death, and maybe it has some squids in it or a dancing weasel trying to make it in the big city or something. Anyway, it’ll be really great and I’ll make oodles of money from it and travel on lecture tours talking about how Wumper the one-legged weasel finds love with the squids. And how that’s actually a metaphor for the political strife in Farquhar and people will be really impressed with my writing skills and my sensitivity to the plight of humanity and all that rot.   So then I’ll be wealthy and I’ll live wherever I want and eat lots of junk food and just be incredibly fabulous in every way. The End.   But then usually some spoilsport professor or some other buzz-kill comes along and points out that I have to actually sit down at the computer and WRITE the book. OK, so every day I sit down (alright- once a week) and I get to the turning on of the computer part, and the checking of the e-mail part and the part where I surf the web for the answer to 9 down and 17 across (which always turns out to be “Ono” by the way) and then it’s lunchtime. So after two or three hours of lunchin’ I come back, check my e-mail again and then it happens; the Siren song that is Tia Pei. Everyone has his or her game; so don’t tell me you don’t.&nbsp; Maybe it’s Solitaire or Dragon Quest or Incredibly Violent Disembowelment Fun-time. Whatever it is, you know it’s always there. Lurking beneath the layers of “work” on your computer screen. Like delicious brain candy calling to you sweetly, “Take a break, you deserve it, you’re mind needs a rest, come to meeee….” And suddenly your fingers are clicking the magic mouse, and your game appears. You’ll only play it for a minute while the boss is out or while you’re waiting for that program to finish running, or until that phone call comes in or your friend arrives with his big bag of ganja and a bong the size of a silo. (How should I know what you losers are into?) And suddenly it’s 6 hours later and no actual “work” has been performed at all.&nbsp; This happens to me more often than I like to admit. So maybe I should adjust the plan a bit. I think we could all really stand to lower our standards from time to time. Being wealthy is great and all, but how much do we really need to eat? And as long as there’s a roof over our heads does it really matter if it’s cardboard? A truly “happy” life doesn’t come from work or obtaining mere possessions anyway. It comes from playing hours of computer games. Ok, so happy life = computer games. Glad I could help. Now quit bugging me. I’ve got some “work” to do.

						    Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is:  The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-create Your World Your Way By: Wayne W Dyer   Oh I am all about the power of intention!  I’ve got things I intend to do every day!  Starting with my genuine intention of getting up early. After I’ve slapped the snooze button about 37 times, my intention is to throw the alarm clock against the wall, but being groggy and slow I usually end up just dropping it on the floor. When I finally get up, I always intend to get dressed and exercise. Sometimes I actually make it to the getting dressed part, but I’m still working on the whole “exercise” thing. I figure, “Hey, housework is exercise!” and every day I intend to clean the house. Then things come up. Like not cleaning it.  	 I intend to take the dog for a walk and fix that hole in the screen door and hose that bird crap off the front window. I like the sound of, “I intend to take care of that.” because it sounds like I’ve sincerely considered the problem and my true objective is to resolve it, instead of, “Ah, screw it.” Which is what I really mean, but which tends to piss people off. 	 As long as you truly “intend” to do stuff and you obviously have “the best intentions,” you can pretty much live your life your way all the time. Didn’t get that job done on time? Just tell the boss you honestly “intended to.” Didn’t get to work on time again? Just say you had the “best intentions” of getting up earlier. Didn’t fill out your unemployment form completely; tell the nice social worker you “intend to do better next time.” 	 Man, this “intention” thing is really empowering isn’t it? If you just don’t get around to stuff, you can always act like you really intended to do it and just say “Hey, The best laid plans of mice and men…” I don’t know who said that, but I intend to find out.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham:   Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “Batman! The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Night” By: Scott Beatty   Geek. The dude wrote a whole book man. Kinda sad. I mean, if I had to write this book, every morning I’d get up, grab a Red Bull, flick on the computer and the theme would start going through my head. “ Bat man! Nana nana nana nanner Bat MAN!”  I mean that crap will make ya CRAZY! I just saw the TITLE and I spent a week singing, “BAT man BAT man BAT mannn…..nanna nanna nanna nanna nanna nanna NA! BAT MAN!” and if you’ve never seen the old Batman series, then OOFF! BIFF! BOFF! I feel bad for you. Cuz it was by far the grooviest series ever. Being about 7 at the time, the whole sarcasm and gay issue was totally over my head. So it was like, Dude lives in a CAVE man! How cool is that!? And he’s got the Batmobile, which was based on the Corvette, and the villains were all mutants and the governor was a dork  (just to add some realism). But the coolest thing by far was that all the hideouts were either leaning haphazardly to the left or to the right. Sometimes the same hideout would change chaotic angles right in the middle of a fight! Talk about messing with your mind! It was like they were all filmed in the Leaning Tower of Pisa on a rotating disk!   This book barely even touches on the 60’s series. It just dismisses it as a sad attempt to humorize a great, dark hero. Bite me man. Great “Dark Night” my ass. The dude was a confused, demented psychopath with an obsessive-compulsive disorder about bats.  So the series had a little fun with the guy and his mental illness, it was all in fun! No one gets their undies in a bunch over “The Brady Bunch” and it’s parody of a blended family dealing with incest. No wait, that was off the set. Well how about “The Addams Family” and its spoof on death? It was a GREAT show! But its hideous cousin, “The Munster’s” was a show that should have been set on fire and run out of town! Or what about that precursor to the music video, “The Monkees?” Was that not a great show or what? What did I just ask there? Doesn’t matter. My point is, anyone who spends that much time thinking about people who aren’t even real, needs to get help. I think that’s my point. I dunno man. I’ve got some serious brain damage from too many 60’s TV shows. I really think it was Gilligan’s Island that did the most damage, but I don’t want to get into that because that’s a whole other rant. So, I just don’t want to get all swamped with e-mails now because you’ve got the Batman theme or some other TV theme running through your head, or your parents didn’t let you watch TV so this column sucked. What, like you didn’t have FRIENDS with TV’s? Gimme a break.   OK, I gotta go listen to “In Da Godda Davida” about 67 times now to flush all these excruciatingly bad tunes out of my head. Go do what ya gotta do, and I’ll see ya next week. Same bat time, same bat station.

						   Welcome to “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham.  Today I have a special “Cream of Book” for my sister Annie’s birthday. I actually wrote this for her last year, it’s a piece about one of our favorite books we liked to read “up at the lake” when we were kids. So it’s a pretty cheap-ass gift, but I thought I’d share it and if any of you want to wish her a happy birthday or send her an e-card, her e-mail is: Anniezee@cs.com and I think that’d be way cool of you.   The library book’s plastic cover makes a crinkling noise as I open it up. The pages slap softly past my thumb as I shuffle by large chunks of the book held together by suction. I’m in bed and a sudden gust of warm wind whistles through a crack of open window, bringing with it the sound of crickets and the rustle of leaves.  	 This is the sound of a summer night. Of many summer nights long ago, spent in rented cabins. With no TV or radio, the only bedtime diversion was a stack of library books brought along to entertain us.  	 During one forgettable pre-teen summer or another, I had borrowed a large book. It made me feel older than my years, for it was 10 inches tall, 6 or 7 inches wide and a good 2 inches thick. The heft of it, the feel of its mass in my hands, made it seem as though I was reading a true “grown-up” novel. Even though the print was too large and the stories too tame, it was the same size as the books my older siblings read, and not one of the “baby” books I had read the previous year when I was still “just a child”. 	 It was titled, “Alfred Hitchcock’s Terrifying Tales” or something equally creepy. Its contents weren’t nearly as frightful as I had hoped, but scary enough to remember fragments now and then. Bits and pieces are still brought to the forefront of my mind, as the occasional movie will cannibalize chunks of these old tales. All I recall now is a piece called, “Lemmings” in which people lined up to jump off a cliff without any provocation, rhyme or reason. They just did it because everyone else did.  	 It wasn’t the stories really; it was the moment. Lying in a bed I shared with my sister, in the cramped bedroom of a small cabin. A cheesy lamp gleaming dimly, its 20-watt bulb bouncing eerie dull-yellow light off dark wood paneled walls. The wind stirring up across the lake, carrying the low rumble of thunder and the pale flash of distant lightning from a threatening storm. That heavy book in my hands. Reading slowly so I might feel the chill within those final paragraphs. 	 A house haunted by you, the reader. A trucker giving a lift to a hitchhiking girl who had been killed exactly16 years ago to the day. A devious man, attempting to poison his wife, accidentally poisoning himself instead, and then dying slowly and wretchedly by his own murderous hands. 	  The delicious endings to spine-tingling tales. The book’s own spine, with its clear plastic cover crackling in my hands, like the sound of cellophane pulled from my father’s cigarette pack, crushed in his hand, crumpled and carelessly dropped into the huge ceramic ashtray on his nightstand in the room next to ours. 	 The sounds of a perfect summer moment, in an imperfect world.
