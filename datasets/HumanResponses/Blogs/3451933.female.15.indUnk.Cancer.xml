Well, My baby and me went out late Saturday night          I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right          Well, pick you up at ten, gotta have you home at two          Mama don't know what I got in store for you          But that's all right cause we're looking as cool as can be           Well, we found a little place that really didn't look half bad          I had a whisky on the rocks          And change of a dollar for the jukebox          Well, I put the cold rock into that can          But all they played was disco, man          Come on, baby, baby, let's get out of here right away           We're gonna rock this town          Rock it inside out          We're gonna rock this town          Make'em scream and shout          Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock          We're gonna rock till you pop          We're gonna rock till you drop          We're gonna rock this town          Rock it inside out           Well, we're having a ball just 'a bopping on the big dance floor          Well, there's a real square cat, he looks a 1974          Well, he looked at me once, he looked at me twice          Look at me again and there's gonna be fight          We're gonna rock this town          We're gonna rip this place apart           We're gonna rock this town          Rock it inside out          We're gonna rock this town          Make'em scream and shout          Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock          We're gonna rock till you pop          We're gonna rock till you drop          We're gonna rock this town          Rock this place apart

      This song is dedicated to one of my good friends, becasue this song reminds me, and her, of her family. Here you go Jerricka!  The winds of fortune  Don't blow the same  She had to get out  And make a change  She had a kid now  But much too young  That baby daddy's out having fun   He's saying  I'm on a roll  With all the girls I know  His baby momma  She ain't so slow  He's saying  I'm on a roll  With all the girls I know  I know you wanna hit that  I know you wanna hit that  All the world is gettin' with, I say  Consequences are a lot, but hey  That's the way it  That's the way things go   What was family  Is now a shell  We're raising kids now  Who raise themselves  Sex is a weapon  And it's like a drug  It gets him right into that grave that he just dug   She's saying  I'm on the run  I'm chasing guys for fun  Her baby daddy  It ain't his only one  She's saying  I'm on the run  I'm chasing guys for fun  I know you wanna hit that  I know you wanna hit that  Everybody's gettin' with, I say  Consequences are a lot, but hey  That's the way it  That's the way things go   Well it winds up  Broken up  Really such a shame  But why not  Take a chance  Everything's a game  And it don't stop  Hooking up  Nothing's gonna change  The more he's trying  The more he's buying   He says  I'm on a roll  With all the girls I know  His baby momma  Don't need to know  He's saying  I'm on a roll  With all the girls I know  I know you wanna hit that  I know you wanna hit that  All the world is gettin' with, I say  Consequences are a lot, but hey  That's the way it  That's the way things go

      This is one of my favorite songs EVER...the lyrics are great, I LOVE the band, and the song is altogether great, and the music video is hala-rious! That is...if you have ever SEEN it.  Run and tell all of the angels This could take all night Think i need a devil to help me get things right. Hook me up a new revolution Cause this one is a lie I sat around laughing and watched the last one die.  (Chorus) I'm looking to the sky to save me Looking for a sign of life Looking for something to help me burn out bright. I'm looking for complication Looking cause I'm tired of lying Make my way back home when I learn to fly high  I think I'm dyin missing patience It can wait one night Give it all away if you give me one last try. We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life Running down the angels and everything's alright.  Im looking to the sky to save me Looking for a sign of life Looking for something to help me burn out bright. I'm looking for a complication Looking cause i'm tired of trying Make My way back home when I learn to fly, high  Make my way back home when I learn to  Fly, along with me, I can't quite make it alone Try and make this life my own Fly along with me I can't quite make it alone Try to make this life my own.  (X2) I'm looking to the sky to save me Looking for a sign of life Looking for something to help me burn out bright. I'm looking for a complication Looking cause i'm tired of trying.  Make my way back home when I learn to fly, high Make my way back home when I learn to fly Make my way back home when I learn to, learn to, learn to...

      Today we got to Cosmic Bowl at the bowling alley! You know, when the blacklights and multi-colored disco balls are all over the place. All my rave jewelery was glowing, and my pants were too, it was SO cool. But on the way there, Ezra got me wet with his hair, because he took a shower and shook his head because I asked him if he took a shower...I will never ask him that ever again, or go anywhere NEAR hi8m when he has wet hair.

      I went with my good friend Jerricka today to see the movie 'Dodgeball,' with one of my favorite actors in it: Ben Stiller! But, seriously, the movie is awesome! and worth the price of 5.00, including tax, to see it. If anyone says otherwise, it is probably because they are the Ben Stiller of dodgeball. Speaking of dodgeball, on the Game Show Network, dodgeball is now an actual competetive sport! When I watched it I could NOT stop laughing, and uttered over an over until my head fell off, "This is a joke, right?" The teams costumes are as ridiculous as the concept of taking an utterly traditional, cherished, and American sport of Elementary School dodgeball, and turning it into a laughable joke on the face of momentary pop culture. Any-ways... After me and Jerricka got back, we watched a terrible, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE GOD-AWFUL movie called 'The Stuff.' It was SO bad that after this suck-fest, me and Jerry went outside and played frisbee and baseball with the DVD of this travesty on the art of film-making. It was VERY fun.  OK.....bye.

      She wore a  Raspberry beret The kind U find in a second hand store Raspberry beret And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more Raspberry beret...  I have had this song stuck in my head for the last...week, or so...don't get me wrong, I LOVE...ABSOLUTELY L O V E... this song, and if you haven't heard this great Prince song thats beat is bubbly-beyond-reason and catchy to the core...you should hear it, then you'll understand. And fate seems to have a way with me, because I was in my favorite vintage store (my secret fashion consulate) downtown, and on the wall for 4.00......was a RASPBERRY BERET!!! .....I know what you are asking yourself ....and Yes, I did get the hat, and joyously sang the Prince song as I pranced to the counter to purchase my now favorite hat. *grins bubbly* I am even wearing it as I type this entry...

      Sorry I have been gone so long, I was...uh...busy, I guess. On Friday I went shopping. Saturday I had the worst headache in the world and couldn't even stand up for a mini-ute without passing out, but the upside is that there were a lot of good movies and shows on the T.V. Sunday was a blah day, but my Dad and I ripped up the ugly carpeting on my parent's stairs going up to their bedroom and polished the really nice wood that was underneath it. And Today, my summer gym class started, and I met some new friends, and sported with my old (but still great, vintage if you may)friends, and a great part of that class is that Mr. Weber, my old elementary school teacher, teaches the class.

      So, yeah, of course, I went to see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban on Friday at noon, and overall, despite the pickiness of OTHER people in this godforsaken have-to-be-perfect-and-can't-simply-enjoy-something-for-one-fricken'-moment...world, I would say it was pretty good. I guess, reading other peoples *ahem Robin's ahem* blogs, some people didn't like it, but I for one, DID!!! It was a GREAT movie, because I don't feel like picking things apart, and the critic almost NEVER gets the last laugh.  Then, on Sunday, I went to Noah's Ark, and it was GREAT FUN, FABULOUS EVEN!!! I went with my Mother, Father, Brother, his friend Bobby, and my good friend Romi. We went on almost everything twice, except the Flash Flood, only me and my Dad went on that one...oh well, we all have our fears. My favorites are the dark rides, and the ever favorite wave pool, and someone, I won't say who, almost drown, and I saved them...and it scared me sooo bad! *shiver*

IT IS GOING TO BE SOOOOOO MUUUCH F-U-N :P So...I said bye to almost everyone, and the one's I didn't get to, I will se next year anyways, and possibly in my summer gym class.

      YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! WWWWWWWHHHHHHOOOOOOOOO-HHHHHHHOOOOOOO!!!! THATS HOW PUMPED I AM!!! YYYYYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! *runs around in circles* *whoo* I took my History, Science, and Math finals today, and surprisingly, they were pretty easy, considering i didn't study as hard as I should of or as much as all of my brainy friends. I had "Ride on Shooting Star," stuck in my head ALL DAY today, again. BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY EASY SONG TO GET IN YOUR HEAD, EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW JAPANESE LYRICS LIKE I DO! Here are the lyrics, but it's easier to understand them if you've heard the song:  ORENJI no SURAIDO utsusu sora SUPONJI no PURAIDO burasa gete  SUPAIDAA teketotta so no yuka wa kakusa naku tatteiinda ra no tsuita yume mitai na  ride on shooting star kokoro no koede san tanzu no youni rai tsuzuketa  KURANJI no HAMUSUTAA otonabi de RIBENJI no ROBUSUTAA kikijurete  SUNAIPAA kochitotta sono sekai ni ani ga mierutte yuunda rau mai ni soware tai na  ride on shooting star kimi wo sagashite kin da shoujo juu so wo tsuita  ride on shooting star kokoro no koede san tanzu no youni rai tsuzuketa  The show that it is the end song to is FLCL, it's on at 11:00 on Saturday nights on Cartoon network, it's part of adult swim. It is a REALLY cool show, it is SO me.

      Well, this weekend was....fun?  Oh, yeah...it was! On Saturday I went downtown to the best store EVER (opinions may differ), which is Deaf Ear records. I got 2 CDs and an AWESOME sticker of Weezer. The 2 Cd's included an 80's rock CD with 3 of my favorite 80's songs   out of 100 top favorites, which include "Turning Japanese," "Too Shy," and, "Always Something There To Remind Me." The other CD was "Insomniac," by *drumroll*....Green Day!!! Big Surprise there :P. The Rest of the weekend was boring, and I prepared for finals.  Today, I took the Art, English, and Spanish finals, which were surprisingly easy. I had the song "Ride On Shooting Star" by The Pillows, the theme of my favorite show in the whole world FLCL, stuck in my head ALL DAY.....I highly recommend downloading it. *cough* *cough*   * http://digikawaii.tripod.com/main.html/ *  Anyways...seeya.

      Well, I finally, FINALLY finished my pixel doll of Ed from Cowboy Bebop.Today, we went up to Viroqua and Westby to visit where Nana grew up, and that was fun. I bought a 20's hat, you know, the ones that have the skimpy top to hold the veil. It's really cool, I love it, obviously. We also went to the resturant that was in the Jeopardy question about a couple weeks ago...the name escapes me right now. We, of course, couldn't leave without going to the Westby creamery and buying some cheese curds, RIGHT before they closed to our good fortune and your dismay, hahahahahaha. Then, to MY terrible dismay, we had to go into the Scandenavian gift shop at my Nana's request...I LOATH that store to DEATH...AAARRRGH! So TACKY and townie it drives me nuts...not that a little townie is bad, but Norwegian townie is the WORST. Anyways, I survived, if I didn't, please bury me with all my stuff, because you know its mine.

      Today, I went shopping, like I said, with my Nana and Mother. I got 50.00 from Nana for my Birthday to spend and 40.00 from my bank account, and then...went nuts. The first thing I bought was from foot locker...A pair of Pink Converses, high top, because low tops suck. Then, here are the rest of my purchases, along with getting my left ear cartilage pierced: -A 'The Doors' patch from Indian Weavings -A rainbow bracelet, keychain, and a Happy Bunny button that says: "crazy doesn't even begin to describe it." I also got a button that says "Yes, it does hurt being this good looking." -A pair of pink pants, retro gray on top of white ripped t-shirt, and neon striped shirt from DEB. -A My Little Pony charm...hehehehehehe...I am a girl. -A Strawberry Shortcake doll...hehehehehehe.... -A pink poodle Beanie Baby...hehehehehe...MMMMWWWAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  More to come...I still have 40.00 left, and a vintage store to hit, along with another mall, and Deaf Ear records for buttons/patches/CDs/a band t-shirt.

      That was SSSOOOOO much fun, and I didn't realize that I enjoyed watching Baseball that much, until I started cheering like a lunatic for the Cubs. Don't get me wrong, there is definately a place in my person for the Brewers, but I was raised a Cubs fan. All I need now is a small Cubs button to put on my jacket or purse, I have been on a huge button hunt because I feel like it, and I have found some nice patches, but I will tell you about my purchases in Milwaukee later on in my post. Any-ways, after that, as you could imagine, there was a HUGE traffic backup and we were too impatient to wait, and be SAFE, so we accidentally ended up in the projects/ghetto/da hood, of Milwaukee. My parents were panicing, but I wasn't...because, well, I just wasn't... When we got back to the hotel I fell asleep, woke up at about 9:00, we left at about 10:00, then went SHOPPING!!! WweEeEeEeEeEeEEEEEE!!!! We went to a mall in Milwaukee, and the Johnson Creek mall outlet place, and here is what I bought: -Invader Zim choking GIR cuff from Hot Topic -GIR patch hitchhiker from H.T -My Little Pony patch from H.T -GIR in the air with tongue out catching candy; says "Whooooo-Hooooo!!! CANDY!!!" on the bottom; postcard -Red pants from Pac Sun -Polka-dotted (black and white)tube top from some preppy store -Pink foil studded bracelet from Claires (Ah, what the hey)  and there is more to come, because I plan on taking my Nana shoppin at the mall on Friday when my Papa, Dad, and Alex are at the Brewers and Cubs game.  Seeya...bye.

      OK, so, we got to Yogi, and did practically nothing the Sunday we got there, except the candy bar horse races. The next day, me and Brittany went for many walks and tried to find the skate park, and on the way were asked by at least 5 golf carts if we wanted a ride. It was weird and...well, weird, but still pretty cool. Brittany and I came up with soooo many personal jokes...i'll type them in some other time, there are so many of them. Then, and Wednesday night, we managed to meet 2 new guy friends who we had seen throughout the park on the previous days, including Joe, who was the guy I was hell-bent on finding out his name instead of referring to him as 'blondie,'he's cool and I miss him, and Jessie, who liked Brittany more, but I didn't really care too much. No highlights from there I can think of except for my Birthday...gimmie a break, do you KNOW what TIME it is? I can't sleep, and that's why i'm up. I got a lot of great gifts, the best being the black and white striped shirt I got and the 15.00 CD gift cirtificates for ShopKo (.....where the heck else would they be for...) and a 30.00 gift certificate to Deaf Ear record, an awesome Cd, vinyl, and sticker/button/patch store that I LOVE going to. I also got a lot of Jewelery...because, you know, I WEAR A LOT OF IT! I got some scetch pads and...oh yeah! The best, actually, gifts I got were the *drumroll*.... first and second season of AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE!!! YEAH, BABY!!! Now all I can do is sit here and eat my Pops cereal at the computer, and maybe i'll find the time to e-mail Joe...or Jessie...who knows. In the mean time, my Dad and Uncle Bob should be waking up, but I am the only one awake, and the first too, and that NEVER happens. My Grandmother is coming over to visit family and my parents for their anniversary (weird that it's the day after my B-day) and give me my gifts, and we are also going to the old train tunnel that has no lights and is about a mile long...but really fun and creepy...         well, better go, here's a shout-out to my new guy pals, Joe and Jessie, Love and Life to you both (Jessie! step AWAY from the skateboard!)              Bye 4 now, Angelica

Me and her are hangin here at her house this fine ummm i guess morning now :-P...im almost done braiding allllllll of her hair, and iv already been at it for 2, yes 2 hours!! So here's a great story...we were up in her room, me braidin her hair, and my sister, sarah, sees this box of 'ribbon candy'... and of course sarah, being my sister decides she wants some. So she asks Angelica, and Angelica says yes, being the good cuzin she is. All of a sudden I, Brittany, realize..."THAT CANDY IS FROM CHRISTMAS!!" ok, so this is ribbon candy, a HARD candy, hmmm at least it's suppose to be HARD! Now seeing as how this candy is 6, YES 6 months old, it has gone SOFT!! EWWWW, who eats that, us!! We eat it!! Of course i have the concern of POISONING, but hey, its fine, we're healthy enough! Then Angelica has to make the great remark about GUYS!!! "guys are HARD until they see their gramma NAKED, then you get the SOFT candy!!" oh god are we ever weird! Well i think that's it...im sure when we come back from Jellystone in like 5 dayz we will have plenty more stories for y'all out there! Until then, please leave your nice comments to me, Brittany, and/or Angelica! I hope you all have a GREAT weekend! MuAh!! :-*              Love,                 Brittany And Angelica!! :-D

      Some songs make you think of the way this world works...how much we actually do suffer, no matter what race. We get so caught up in our own petty problems we can't stop to realize that there are actually people out there that are suffering much worse than you are. No matter how big you think your problem is....  ...and truly think about that...  ....there are still bigger ones out there that matter to more than one person.....  .....more than one society......  .....more than one race......  As I sat on my bed a few days ago, I heard a song that made me truly think about this world, and how much we have not changed in the past 10 or 20 years for the better. No matter how much we say we care about each other, we are still killing each other for reasons that are temporary, we even kill ourselves for temporary, solvable, reasons. It seems that nobody can lean on or talk to anyone without a sacrifice or cost to their being and mind...an insecurity that comes from our own doubts and pessimistic alligations. So as the song by Tupac Shakur, "Changes," wisely shines light on,  "We gotta start makin' changes   learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers  and that's how it's supposed to be  How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?  I'd love to go back to when we played as kids  but things changed, and that's the way it is"  All that is in my power as of now is to hope that you take this post seriously...when you read it once, you'll think I am crazy, read it twice you'll think about it... read it three times...  ...you'll cry.   All I can say is that I hide my true sadness for this world...  But when i'm alone...     ...all I do when I look at this world together is cry...     Forget all of my previous posts in this blog.....  ....this is the real me....  im sorry but I have to go....

      Has anyone ever heard of the band "The Undertones." I got the CD yesterday, deciding to take my chances, and I have come to find that they were really popular in Great Britain in the late 70's and early 80's, and even in the U.S were semi-popular. I really like their music, because it is old-school punk, and I LOVE punk music, and garage, and rock...I love it all. And, inevitably, I checked out a Pearl Jam CD, too, they're cool too, because a little Grunge is OK once in a while, but too much can drag you down into a seemingly endless abiss. OK...thats it.

      Well, I gotta say, that was pretty fun. It wasn't as bad as I thought, having different personalities clash like that for almost 2 weeks. Yesterday was fun, too. I got three new CDs in one day, and a Rainbow Brite doll that I have been wanting for about 5 months. The Three Cds include Punk-O-Rama #8, an 80's movie hits CD with such songs as "If You Leave" "Maniac" and "Bette Davis Eyes" Which is the song that drives my Dad crazy.  Hahaha.  And the last CD I got, and don't come after me for this, The Greatest Hits of Elton John. Ah, donthitme!  So, i'm happy things are starting to unwind after 4 weeks of family, and getting sick of them altogether...*clenches teeth* especially  YOU  BRATTANY WEAN SPAZNEY!!! (Brittany Jean C.) Anyways... Have a nice freakin' day, morons and peons.

      OOOOOHH! THAT WAS SOOOOOO MUCH FUN! I just got back from a party at my friend Brittany's house, from 4 to 10, and it was SSSOOOOOO much fun. Well, actually, it got fun at about 6:30, when me, Romi, Tom, Micheal and a hyperactive friend of Emily's, and Mike, who watched and joked around, started to play Spoons...well...it turned into forks. lol. Then, soon after that started the band that came over left, and things finally got fun between the people that I knew. I sat between Romi and Mike on the swing, and Brittany sat on Mikes lap, and Tom sat next to Romi...and then we swung for about 45 minutes. We talked, told jokes and stories from this summer, and I got relly uncomfortable when someone, I don't recall who, brought up the subject of Vampires. Mike REALLY freaked me out because Mike sat RIGHT NEXT TO ME. Now, he reminded me of one of my cousin Steve's friends cause of his personality, but he has the hairstyle where you shave the sides of your head and leve the hair one inch on each side of your hairline, including the back, and he has a mustach and goutee sort of thing, and he's about 5'8", or 9", whatever. He kinda scares me, but I like him, he's cool. I got along with him, but we messed around with each other a lot (not THAT way sickos) > BOOM! We fell down to the ground! It was so funny, me and Mike couldn't stop laughing. LOL!!! So, it was a good night,  So...  Good night

      Everyone is gone, it's just me...ME ME MEEEEE! ALONE YAY!!! Anyways, the song of the moment for me is "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" by Elton John, its a really touching song to me...  When are you gonna come down When are you going to land I should have stayed on the farm I should have listened to my old man  You know you can't hold me forever I didn't sign up with you I'm not a present for your friends to open This boy's too young to be singing the blues  So goodbye yellow brick road Where the dogs of society howl You can't plant me in your penthouse I'm going back to my plough  Back to the howling old owl in the woods Hunting the horny back toad Oh I've finally decided my future lies Beyond the yellow brick road  What do you think you'll do then I bet that'll shoot down your plane It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics To set you on your feet again  Maybe you'll get a replacement There's plenty like me to be found Mongrels who ain't got a penny Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
