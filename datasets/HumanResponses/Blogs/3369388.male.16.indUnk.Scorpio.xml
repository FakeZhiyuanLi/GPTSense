      Wow!  So alot has happened in the past few days.  First of all my house was broken into.  Which has to be a mega bummer.  We had some things stolen , but no-one was hurt.     Now I have a camping trip coming up next weekend.  I am still not even close to being ready.  Procastination is such a wonderful and evil thing.  Oh well, it will be a mad rush towards the last few days prep time, as usual with me.   Next, I would like to say to all of my friends, Thank you.  This year has been a good one.  School ended and I really didnt get to day good bye to anyone. Please dont be affended.  I look forward to seeing you all next year.   Also, I would like to say to my family that I dont get to see very often, I'm sorry but it will be a while before I can come up for a visit.  I have a lot on my plate right now. But I will come visit  ALL  of you.    Lastly, I would just like to say hi to a wonderful person.  Her name is __________.  I know alot of people are dyeing to know who it is.  Maybe I should tell you the girl?  Would any of you want to know who my secret crush is?  Drop me a comment and say you want to know, and maybe if enough people post it, I'll give you her name...  Then again...   Well thats all for now.   I am LOVING my SUMMER as a Junior!!  Tony Smith

      Well today was interesting.  Craig Riccardi seems to think that he can kick my butt and threaten me all the time.  Well I aint takeing it any more.  I hate dumb people and this dood just makes my skin crawl.  Everyone I talk to wants me to kick the crap out of him.  Even teachers at school are giving me tips to getting away with it.  I dont like to fight, but there is a point when you have to draw the line.  Well here it is ________. and he is so far past the line that it is off the chart.  Why do dumb people have to go and ruin a good day.  Well he was going to try and call me out after school, but I gave my word that I would "try" to stay away from him to 2 different people.  I consider my word to be worth something so i did stay away from him.  Well let him try to do something tom. b/c the gloves are coming off.  In fact I want everyone to tell Craig that I was talking about him.  That way he gets so angry that he will throw the first punch (or try to throw the first punch).  Then...thats when him and I will go at it.  Do it, Tommorrow tell craig I was talking Trash.  He has an attitude that will make him go nuts to know I was talking about him.  Well see you all tom.

      Well this is my first post and I thought that i sould introduce myself.  My name is Tony Smith, I am 16 years old, and I am a sophmore at Charlotte High School.  Well that's me.   I truly am very boring.  My life is busy though.  Almost an oxymoron, isnt it?  I am a Life Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.  I am also the president of a club at school called the Venture Out! club.  I am a Hospice of Southwest Florida Volunteer.  I also work for McDonalds (yeah, I know, but it isn't all the bad).  So I am always busy but have a really boring life.   I have never really had a "Girlfriend".  Yet I do have lots of friends that are girls. I have a girl that has stolen my heart, but she is already going with someone.  Not for very long but long enough to be serious.  Not noly that, but I am pretty sure that I dont have a chance with her.  You see, I am a very heavy set guy and I'm not an athletic guy so I am pretty much screwed.  So thats all I have to say for now.  I hope to update maybe once a week or so.  So stay tuned if you want to hear about the rest of my boring life.

      So yeah.  Its been a while since I posted something so I thought that maybe it was time that I did.  I was able to complete my eagle scout porject this past satruday.  I would like to thnk all my friends inside of the scouting program, the church, and freinds that were able to show up.  There were a few problems along the way, but as long as it got done, I am a happy guy.  If any of you dont know what an eagle scout project is, it is one of the most prestigous awards inside of Boys Scouts of America.  It takes alot of work, planning, and alot of time.  I havent got the award officially, but now that I have the project completed, everything is easy as pie from here.  So in closing, thanks you guys. Tony

      This trip to the keys was absoloutly awesome.  I had the best of time, I made new friends and we had a blast with old friends. The trip started off late.  We were supposed to leave the school at like 3:30 A.M. but Lisa Moran was late and we couldnt hardly fit everything that needed to go.  But we did finally manage and we left like at 4:15 instead.  We drove for what seemed like forever to meet Ms. Correll in Florida City.  We met her at McDonald and we ate breakfast.  I had the hardest time staying awake b/c  i was driving down there.  Then after we ate we had everyone change into swim suites.  Then we gassed up and made our way to to the keys.  We stopped to go kyaking on the ocean about a 1 1/4 mile to a botanicle garden.  We toured that and then we had a race back to were we started. This was the frist of our Survivor games.  I did not participate b/c i was trying to proctor.  Then we left for camp.  We got there about 1 o'clock or so.  We checked in and it was blazing hot.  We could hardly work it was soooo hot.  After getting camp together for the most part.  We took off for the beach.  We were dripping with sweat.  We swam for about two hours or so.  Then we left to go back to camp to eat lunch.  It was a late luch but it was good.  I'll tell you about the rest of the trip when I have more energy to type.  Or better yet call me.  It is easier to talk than to type.  Call my cell at 941-380-3614.  Talk to you all later.

          I was truly hoping that I would be able to go on a date on Tuesday.&nbsp; I was really excited.&nbsp; Her name is Crystal.&nbsp; She is going to be a sophomore.&nbsp; So she is like a year or two younger than I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truly an awesome girl.&nbsp; And the best part is, is she said yes when I asked her out......&nbsp;BUT.&nbsp; Yeah there is a but.&nbsp; Her mom wont let her go on a date with me.&nbsp; So I am kinda down&nbsp;right now.&nbsp; I was kinda of expecting it, about her mom.&nbsp; We still might be able to go, but it wont be a date, but instead a couple of freinds going together.&nbsp; There also might be other people going with us now just to satisfy her mom.&nbsp; So right now, I feel like crap, and dont want to do anything until I hear back from Crystal tom.&nbsp; Sorry if i dont have much to say tonight.&nbsp; I'll get over it eventually.

      Well friends, the Englewood Beach was amazing.  I did have a great time.  I am glad that the ppl that went did.  Even though I am fried to a crisp right now, and will probably be hurting for like the next few days, it was worth it.  Maybe next time I wont be stupid and will put some sun screen on.  I only wish that one other person would have gone.  But she said she was sick of the beach and was working on her room floor.  Lunch was funny.  But some of the things said took me back.  But it was ok.  I hope that we can do this again sometime.  And I am sorry Deena, but I  just like to plan things out.  I know that annoys you, but its just the way I am.  We'll have to find a happy medium.  Well all in all it was great.  We'll have to set up another date to do it again.  Thanks for inviteing me. Tony

      So, I was at the mall on Wednesday the 30th.  And I was planning on going to go see Spiderman 2 with Kyle and David.  But I had a scout meeting in Port Charlotte from 7-8.  So we were going to go see the 9:30 showing.  Well I cut out of my meeting early and went to the mall to turn something in for the uncle that I am really pissed off at.  But that is not what this about.  So in any case.  I brought a freind with me from scouts to go to the movies with me.  Well we are going to go buy our tickets and I see none other than Laura and Keith.  So I stopped to talk to them and told them what I was going to go see and what time and they said "no your not, they are sold out."  So I called kyle and told him that we were going to go see the 10:00 showing.  That wasnt a problem.  So Me and my friend waited around for kyle to show up.  Well when he does, we go to the food court so that he could eat.  So we are sitting there eating and talking, and all of a sudden I see this girl walk by and I could have sworn that I recognized her.  I just knew it had to be my old very best friend that moved away 6 years ago.  So my jaw dropped like I had seen a ghost.  I told my friends who I thought that she was, and they said that i should go talk to her.  So I got up finally after alot of hesitation.  And i followed her a bit and finally I caught up to her and said,  "Excuse me, are you Nicole Chester?"  And she says yeah.  Then she kind of looks at me and she yells, "TONY!!!"  and she just wraps her arms around me and gives me the biggest danm hug.  We talked for a few minutes, seeing how each other was doing.  She said that she was going to see the Spiderman 2 movie aswell.  Thank God for small miracles.  So I let her go walk and talk with her friends and I went back to mine after we gave each other another hug.  So I sat behind her in the movie theater and we talked for about a half an hour before the movie just trying to catch up.  It was sooo awesome..  When she moved away my heart was crushed.  I am so glad to see her again.  I used to still think about her every now and again.  We were so tight all through elementary school and even into 6th grade after she moved away.  I now have her Phone number so that I can call her and play a little more catch up.  But Wow!  What and awesome day yesterday!  I left walking on cloud nine I was so excited.

             I just got back from vacation and it was fun.  But the realization that school starts in one week finally set in.  I'm worried about alot this year.  I dont know why, but I just am.  And I have a question for everyone, is it possible to know something will happen, but there is no possible way that u can know.  For example, if I knew I was going to die young.  Would that be weird.  And when I say young, I mean in like my twenties or thirties.  Not real old.  I dont know, its weird.  I just have this feeling.  I know.....its crazy.  Oh well.   I'm kinda just ready for school.  My brain is fried from the trip.  I'll ttyl. Tony
