         Microsoft is to launch a cheaper version of its Windows XP operating system in an effort to halt the rise of low-cost Linux software.      The software giant said the new system, named Windows XP Starter Edition, would go on sale in Asia in October. The company said the cut-price software was designed for "first-time desktop PC users in developing countries".      Competitive threat      Analysts say Linux poses a growing threat to Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system, used on more than 90% of the world's computers.       A so-called 'open source' system which PC users can install on their machines and modify without paying a license fee, Linux has made significant inroads into the software market in Latin America and Asia.      Earlier this year, computer giant HP began shipping computers equipped with Linux to China and India.       Linux is also championed by Microsoft critics who say the firm's dominance of the global software market makes computer systems more vulnerable to potentially disabling viruses. Microsoft's new software - dubbed "XP Lite" - will feature lower resolution graphics and limited options for networking computers together.           Microsoft said it hoped the new software would also help deter consumers from buying pirated versions of its XP system, widely available in many Asian countries.

         Sri Lanka underscored their supremacy at home with a 25-run win over India to win the Asia Cup in style. The R Premadasa stadium reaffirmed its status as one of Sri Lanka's safe houses. When Marvan Atapattu won the toss and unhesitatingly chose to bat, India's chances of winning the Asia Cup receded ever so slightly. Ashish Nehra, one of two other left-arm fast bowlers in the Indian line-up, did his bit by removing Avishka Gunawardene (31 for 2).      Then, just when India sniffed a chance of kicking Sri Lanka when they were down, Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara came together in a match-winning 116-run partnership for the third wicket that took Sri Lanka out of the woods. An already slow pitch grew steadily slower and lower and the spinners began to come to the fore.       Two carved boundaries through point, one crunching cut off Harbhajan Singh and a forceful pick-up shot over midwicket signalled Sangakkara's ability to put the chance behind him. However, on 38, Sangakkara was left stranded mid-pitch when he played the ball down to short third man and thought about pinching a single. Tendulkar (2 for 40) and Sehwag (1 for 32) did a fine job in tandem, and Sri Lanka only managed 228 for 9 from their 50 overs.  India's run chase began as a mirror image of Sri Lanka's. Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Zoysa bowled to the field set to them, put the ball in the right places, took the pace off the ball, and got rid of two batsmen with only 26 on the board. Virender Sehwag was trapped in front by Vaas while Ganguly's nibble at a ball was exhilaratingly snatched at slip by Mahela Jayawardene.  With Sehwag the powerhouse back in the hutch India shifted to the lowest gear. Tendulkar battled for survival, only chancing his arm when the ball begged to be hit, and VVS Laxman tried to find his groove. Rahul Dravid, India's crisis man got off to a fine start under the circumstances, stealing singles to the keep the strike rotating. Then, with 16 to his name he shaped to cut Upul Chandana and Dilshan snapped up a sharp chance at slip after a quick juggle (96 for 4).   Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif, heroes of many an Indian run-chase, came and went without much impact. After Billy Bowden repeatedly reprieved Tendulkar on close shouts, his painful innings of 74 (100 balls, 7 fours, 1 six) came to an end when he was bowled through the gate by Dilshan. India was 140 for 7 needing 99 from 64 balls, and was dead and buried. The match ground to its inevitable end, only delayed by some old-fashioned slogging from Zaheer.
