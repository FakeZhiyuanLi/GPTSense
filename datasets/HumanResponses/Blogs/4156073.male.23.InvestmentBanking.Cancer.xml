      Whilst talking dirty shouldn't be a problem for most men, I know it ain't for me. But the other day when in the middle of some great sex my girl friend suddenly had the brain wave that my talking to her during intercourse would be a real turn on for her I was at a loss of words. I prefer the sighs and the aahs but actual talk requires processing of signals in the brain which are not instinctive thus, requiring “concentration”. Now good sex does not generally inspire me to think (well at least not while I am indulging in the actual act).   So here I was "committed" to the "hilt" with my girl friend urging me to converse with her and all I could think of was "Honey, you more than make up for my absence of conversation in our relationship" Hmmm.....apparently not a very bright thing to say under the circumstances. Translated ---------> Blue Balls and me meet again !  So here's the million dollar question: Do women like screaming panting men talking to them urging them to ever newer heights or are they content in making the majority of the noises ?!!

      Girl friend took me to this movie last night called  urlLink "Julie" ) The promotions promised skin and sleaze aplenty, the actual movie fell way short. If you expected a decent script you had better chances in  urlLink Spidey   ) which was running on the next screen ! Can't call it a disappointment as I never really did expect anything ! Just went because I was asked to.....  Although it did inspire my girlfriend for some weird reason (that only babes would related to) to introduce some kewl variations under the sheets later on. For some reason she decided that love making should be something that should be dictated by a man with the woman as a guide on the trip to the great venus ! Whose complaining ?!! I had a marathon session lasting a good 90 minutes and finally ended when my neighbour rang the bell coz he heard someone screaming ;-)  Why is it that girls would go an extra mile to compete with another woman that she “presumes” to be competing for her man's fantasies ? Don't they reaslise that fantasies are some place where 'real women' hardly find a place ?!! Anyways I am not going to complain anytime soon.

      So my dear friend has gone out and done it again. Impressed my boss with MY idea ! Its getting riduculous having to sit there and see myself get outmanouvered !  Always thought I was a good chess player .... well well....back to checkers I guess. What I am wondering is should I be reacting to his plays (my colleagues) or should I be content in the knowledge that at the end of the day my work shall come out on tops by its merits ?!! Somehow the idea of responding to someone's agression seems petty when in the long run it hardly seems to hold any importance.  Immediate versus Future is that the debate? Or, my lack of response to such manouveres gives my boss the impression that I am laidback ?

      For the last couple of days boss has been behaving a bit weird. On one side he has been contstantly reminding me that “I am the next in line to the throne”! Translated -------> Take over a large investment division. But, on the other side he seems to be constantly reminding me of his admiration for this colleague of mine who has been working long hours and producing some comparable results lately.  Issue here: This “colleague” is someone who I would term as very industrious and strong-willed, he has a reputation of not letting go when the cards he has been dealt with are bad. He would instead make someone else trade his cards instead of throwing his towel. But, he also has a slight drinking problem and has been known for a handful of mishaps that could be traced to a bottle of booze or two. In short, he might be get the work done but he is as likely to get it wrong.  Personally, I feel that he is a fast learner but has LOOONG way to go before he becomes svaue enough to hide his disappointments and learn better people management skills.  The mere fact, that I have a better track record (though I have been going through a dry spell lately) but am still being coerced to compete with someone who I clearly deem to be a sprint runner has left me wondering it makes sense to cut some corners in the short term as long as the long term goals are firmly in mind.  Success or the lack of it......makes one do strange things !

       Had to travel to Bombay recently to meet couple of companies that we just made an investment in. One of them is in Vashi and develops a cool product for automotive manufacturers. But the promoter is a damn bore.....so is his financial guy....can you believe CA's in India make a bomb just for introducing a client to a bank??? I mean the chap is giving collateral and on top of it a 12% interest ! This after the company being listed on the Stock Exchange for the last couple of years. Anyway, I think the company is highly under-valued and there is hardly any movement in its scrip so we decided to buy a healthy portion of its stock and join hands. Just made some introductions to auto manufacturers which have ended in the company getting huge orders. There revenue should more than double this year. Translated --------> Good Money !    Second meeting was with a great buddy who runs a software firm out of Andheri. The stock price has multiplied more than 4 times in the last 2 years and the revenue is growing at a healthy 100% year on year. Wanted to pitch some companies to him for an acquisition as they recently raised a bundle of cash through placements to Foreign Investors. This one particular company that I came across works in the RFID space and is very interesting with a couple of US patents that we helped them find recently. So anyway, looks like the deal will be closed soon. With my listed entity taking over a bunch of new technologies and the promoters of the startup getting a bundle of cash and some very kewl stock options for their efforts.  Then over to my soon to be in Mom-in-law who was down in Bombay for the week. Paid my regards and wanted to move on but she insisted on a cup of coffee. When are we getting married was the first salvo....second being....pre-marital sex is in fashion but it is WRONG....blah....blah....blah.  Anyway, got her a flight back home and dropped her to the airport. Drove back home with my girl friend who seems to think that her Mom is the BEST and just about everyone has to love her.....yeah right :-)  Shitty weather all through out with heavy downpour and some traffic jams all along the highway. Reached home at about 10 to find my roomie having a chicked biryani and watching a movie....it was his birth day so made sure a party was arranged on the fly....couple of drinks some good food .... some reasonable babes and another late night.  Crashed after coming back from the party at 2 in the morning only to find that my oh-so-sweet girl friend is in the “mood” ! Since, she never drove to Bombay and never thought of driving on the way back either I don't blame her. Sex even at 2 in the morning is something to cherish so never one missing on opportunity we indulged in a brief session and for a change I was absolutely content in her being on top and all that. A good BJ later all my girl friend had left with her was a drowsy (probably half-dead) guy so she took mercy on me and let me sleep.
