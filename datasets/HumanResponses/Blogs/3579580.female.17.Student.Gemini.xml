      This is my fourth posting today... I guess I'm feeling bloghappy.  ANYWAY, tonight was my "goodbye" dinner with my girls before the summer.  I leave for Costa Rica on Wednesday, Mel leaves for a Eurotrip tomorrow (terrible movie), Kat for Finland on Thursday... and Alexa is home, her only friend her brand new Blog.  Check that out by the way, there is a link on my side menu.... it's like  Sex and the City  moves to the suburbs so far, our own little Carrie Bradshaw. Delicious.  Once Lex and Mel had left, Kat and I went into e-hood and ran into this guy she knows since she was three.  He lived in the Galaxy apartment buildings with her.  We bought a cookie with a Sacajawea (my new FAV currency) and then he gave each of us a free lemony-limeny sorbet... not to mention somthing else green.  It was an interesting experience, and every time I hear the song "Hey Jude" by the Beatles, I will think of it.  Here is a cute pic of me and my girls (and some guys) on our crayzay night on the town:       The girls are me, Kat, Lex, and Mel. (Bex took the picture, she's hot too though, don't worry...hah)   What a night that was, last Wednesday.  We went to this party at Coral hosted by the infamous actor who played young Ben Stiller in "Keeping the Faith" who forgot to tell us that it was for 18 and older only.  After some arguing though we got in.  We then procedeed to have a rockstar night, loose my lipgloss and Kat's eyeliner, and end up at the Plaza diner in Fort Lee at 6 in the morning.  Good times.  Ok, I'm tired from my rendevous in the back of Ben & Jerry's, I'm off to dreamland. tata.

      First car accident today! well, actually it wasn't that bad to even call an accident, but I hit the back bumper of my "piece" (short for p.o.s (piece of shit)) on the retaining wall next to my driveway.  Mater and Padre both said "be thankful it happened here."  Yes, there were tears, the sound of a car hitting a cement wall is a little unnerving.

      This is just a test post, because all the stats about my blog said that I only had 1 post, when I in fact had 2.  Hopefully now they will say I have 3.  By the way "Testing 1 2 3" - Barnaked Ladies song. Saw them in concert, met them too.  Didn't even know their names, bad girl.

      Because I do.  That is where I will be taking a plane to on Wednesday the 30th.  For four weeks I will be in Costa Rica doing community service in a village called Guadeloupe (could be Guadaloupe, not sure), rainforest trail maintenance, white-water rafting, and "roughin' it" (or so I thought).  I was looking over the packing list, and noticed that there was no need for a sleeping pad.  I thought this was quite odd, considering we would be sleeping on the floor of tents at some points in the trip... so I e-mailed one of the leaders.  Much to my dismay, she responded to let me know I didn't need one, becuase we would be sleeping in hotels while we weren't in Guadeloupe. HOTELS?!  I took so much pride in the fact that I had never gone on a "teen-tour" where kids stayed in hotels and shopped for 4 weeks straight.  I was excited to go camping, and have the same experience I did the summer before freshman year, when I camped and backpacked for three weeks in New England. MY DREAMS ARE CRUSHED. Now I'll be staying in hotels, sleeping in beds, and using toilets that have plumbing.  You would think that any other person would be happy to hear this news.  Well I'm not. I must go back to packing now.

      Today I am a new woman.  Spamantha and I have created blogs.  I used to think that blogs and "Live Journals" and such were for the computer nerds, or the poor unfortunate souls who didn't have anyone else to talk too... but they're not! I can't quite tell you what they are for yet, but I will tell you soon.  So far I only have one Blog viewer, Sam.  Keep it quiet baby.
