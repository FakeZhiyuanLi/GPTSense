      I'm here at work, and I was just sent on An Errand. The errand was to pick up a book from another office, the Foreign Languages Department, here on campus. And so I did, and it was a nice walk in the soupy heat over to this building, which used to be called Lakeside. I'm glad they changed the name because there is no Actual Lake, there is only a pond, and you can tell whoever came up with the building name knew it wasn't quite right, but he or she couldn't very well call it   Pondside  , for that name would be completely unattractive. ("Yeah, I've got to my next class over at    Pondscum ,   I'll see you later....")   Walking into the old Lakeside is like entering a freezer. On the second floor, I wander up and down the halls a few times looking for Room 278, feeling like I'm in a labyrinth, new halls and doorways appearing everywhere, students and university employees peering curiously at me from their desks. And then I find the office, finally, and I step inside, and I look around to see how    nice    it is in there. Look how    nice    it is. Lit by corner halogen lamps rather than overhead flourescence, the dim office contains two Ecko-ish desks facing each other, spotless ceiling-high shelves, new flat-screen computers, carpet that is flat and institutional, yet pleasing (color-wise) to the eye. The two ladies working there maintain pleasant conversation with a very pregnant co-worker, speaking in low tones before breaking off to ask how they can help me today.   "I'm here to pick up a book?"   I feel so young. I feel, incidentally, just like I have in past jobs where I have been sent on errands to obtain Important Things from Older, Wiser People. People with Real Jobs who looked at me, the cute, slightly meek office "helper," college-aged and hourly-waged, one day destined for Bigger, Brighter Things. A college education, even more schooling, amazing job, nice house, beautiful family. This will be me.   Except now I am 26. I have my Master's degree (from this very university). There will be no more school. And, at least for this summer, I am still the Office Helper.   What comes next?
