      Today I'm going to my older brother's house for a swim party/early Father's Day dinner.  Aunt Flow arrived yesterday so I'll participate in the dinner but not the swim party.    Damn it.   I wanted to practice my cannonballs.    Music Playing: What It Feels Like For A Girl ~ Madonna

      I survived last night.    I picked up the girls from daycare and off we went. Sonic for drinks, Walmart for a couple toys (and to pass time) and then Full FX for gymnastics/cheerleading. Things were going great. Chloe runs in the gym to her class and Brynn and I try to find a seat in the Parent Arena so we can watch her do her thang. I spot a folding chair in between a young girl and an older lady.  The old lady was probably 70.  And MEAN.   Brynn gets down from my lap and just stands there staring at her at first. She gives Brynn the evil eye and I direct her attention elsewhere as she has been known to pat, poke, and even hug complete strangers. Nothing doing.  Brynn touches her and then laughs.  Here's what went down next:  Mean old lady (MOL): What a cute little boy!  Me: Actually, she's a girl.  MOL, cleary irate: WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?  Me: Um, she's wearing a dress?

      My niece, the very one that broke my heart this past weekend, called me last night and wanted me to pick her up from daycare and take her to her cheerleading class this afternoon.  I said no.  Played hard to get.  Hee.    Ya right.    So I started thinking today that it would be fun to pick up her 1 1/2 yr old sister too.  I went back and forth on it for a couple of reasons. One being I want to spend quality time with her without her having to compete with the other sibling. Another is because I want to be able to concentrate on her cheerleading class and watch her because I hear she's gotten killer at her russians. And my last reason is her little sister can be...well, colorful! I remind myself that I've had taken her many places before but, of late, little girlfriend has developed what can only be described as a hungry pterodactyl shriek. And it is LOUD. It doesn't necessarily mean she's unhappy. It just means she's kind of...rowdy, I guess. Or spirited! Yes! Spirited sounds good!  Either way it's already gotten her booted from Logan's Roadhouse and Hobby Lobby.  Perhaps she'll wait to release the shriek until I've dumped her off at home.  But if not, my apologies in advance to all the poor souls at Full FX Gymnastics tonight.     Music Playing: Livin' On A Prayer ~ Bon Jovi

      So, I'm back from my dermatologist appointment. No they didn't amputate my arm. No, I didn't faint, thus you can already assume La Mole was not removed. He jerked my arm up to him, took one look and said "nothing to worry about".  Whew.  What a relief. I worried myself sick (which I have always done when I have something like that facing me) for nothing.   I walk in and it's this small, quaint waiting room. I am, by far, the youngest present, with none of my fellow cell mates being under the age of 70.  I listen to what has been removed off of each and every one of these beings with vivid details given. Sweet.  So my brother, qualified RN that he is, owes me $40 because a while back he saw Mr. Mole and said "wow, Jame, you REALLY need to get that removed!" And my insurance copay was $40.

      I was flipping through the channels last Sunday morning and this documentary on HBO caught my eye.  I had seen this extraordinary woman, Susan Tom, on talk shows before and I'm happy they made her story into a documentary. It is called  urlLink My Flesh And Blood . I learned a few things about life after watching this film:  (1) you can make the best of any situation (2) you can find a way to love anyone (3) you must have hope for tomorrow (4) you can be a survivor of detrimental circumstances (5) happiness lives; even in the most difficult situations (6) my life does *not* suck  It was the most profound, raw, deep documentary I've ever seen.   And A Dermatologist Appointment.... I have one at 11am.  Yep, I do.  I'm having a mole looked at that I've had since elementary school.  I am deathly afraid of needles so if he has to remove it, I will no doubt faint or do something stupid.      Music Playing: Love's Divine ~ Seal

      Monday's are always err...fun.   This weekend I managed to get my feelings hurt, go shopping and reconnect with my brother.   First things first...my feelings getting hurt. My niece was suppose to spend the night but decided that'd she had rather stay home with her rents. Yep, major failure-to-be-the-perfect-aunt-with-the-fun-house feelings happening. In all fairness she was exhaused...she had swam all morning at home, went to a baby shower with her mom that afternoon and went to a wedding that night. The poor kid had had enough fun for one day so I'm sure the thought of being with her overenthusiastic aunt was the last thing she wanted to do. I mean I'm okay with it...nah, I'll be fine....after a few therapy sessions I'll get over it..really I will. ::sniff sniff:: Hee. I guess what shocked me the most was that this is a little 4 yr old who calls me daily asking when she can come over..she acts like my home is Casa La Bella. Homegirl won't leave! I guess I better sit back and enjoy the peace while I can, I'm sure I'll be screening calls from her soon enough.   Shopping. Yep, did some of that...don't care to tell how much I spent and what I fell prey to.  Reconnecting with the El Sibling... He came over Friday night and we talked for a long time. I'm the *sister*, hence I should have more drama in my life. However I have aptly named him The Drama Queen of the family.     Music Playing: Manic Monday ~ Bangles

      Changing my ISP has proved to be The Mishap of all mishaps.    I must dish.  I thought this would be a pain free ordeal, thus I wouldn't need to go into further detail in the blog.  I was wrong.   It all started this morning with the installation.  The cable company sent out a Chinese young man to do the installing.  I have the utmost respect and normally a non-judging mentality towards anyone from another country, however, I can truthfully say I fell short of this quality today.   9:10 - Enter Chinese Cable Guy; materials in hand.  I lead him to the computer and sit on my bed while he begins to hook up everything.  CCG: (Mumbling) Ahh, uhh, see, fa, fu, chu..  Me: Can I help you with something to make the installation go smoother for you?  CCG: Uh, no ma'am....er, eh, ha, bo  Me: Um, what?    I could tell this was not going to be easy and/or fun so I decided to go make some toast because I started feeling queasy and I didn't want to stand over him while he tried to do his thang. I didn't want him to have horrific flashbacks of the sweatshop he worked in when he was 2 back in China. So, after scarfing down a couple of bites, I go back to where he is and he's sitting there staring at my computer screen, which gloats a bright blue "fatal error" message.  A full-screen one.  Not just those little small boxes that you can control-alt-delete out of your way. Whatever he had done had totally locked up the entire computer and we both received a message that we had never seen.  CCG: You seen dis?  ME: No, what happened?  CCG: Er, uh, ble, ca, cu. I turn off.  ME: Um, ok. No big deal.  CCG: Der we go. Up and running.  ME: Great!  CCG: Do have en questions?  ME: If you don't mind, can you just show me how to access my email and a little about RoadRunner on the whole?  CCG: Here your email. Click here for email.  ME: Ok. Got it.  CCG: Click here to go homepage.  ME: Ok.   CCG: En uder questions?  ME: No, sir, thanks a lot.  CCG: You pay check?  ME: Pay for what?  The customer service lady told me Tuesday that it would be added to my bill.  CCG: You pay check?  ME:  Alright. Whatever.  CCG: Tanks. Have good day.  ME: You too.   Thus, I sit here at 1:22 in the morning trying to figure everything out, remaining in a state of bitterness.    Music Playing: Proud To Be An American ~ Pat Boone

      So today is Friday.  Yippee-freaking-yea.  My day started off with meeting the cable man at my house so he could install RoadRunner on my computer. They tell you they will be there "sometime" between 8 and 12...he called at 8:15, 15 or so minutes after I had gotten to work and I had to drive all the way back. Blah. I never realized how slow a dial-up connection was until I played with RR this morning. I get to see how the rich folk live now! Hee.  I'm getting off work early (thankfully) and I'm picking up the little girlfriends.  I think we'll play for a while or maybe make the ever-so-glam trek to Walmart to see what new toys they *don't* have. (There aren't many, I assure you.)  Then I'll probably deposit the little one at her hacienda and take the eldest to see a movie..I'm thinking Garfield or Shrek 2.  I'm out! Or as Chloe says "It's party time, Woody!"

      There I said it. I don't like cats.  So sue me.  Two little homeless kittens wondered up from the field behind our office and have made their home under our carport. When you open the door they dart in the office and won't leave. They crawl all over our cars and shit everywhere.   So I called the Humane Society and they aren't taking any cats. They are overloaded. Go figure. "You can call this number XXX-XXXX and they can help you" the lady from the Humane Society said. I go "who's number is that?" She's like "the Animal Control office".  Great. We all know what that means.  So I call and, lucky me, I get this horribly rude, obnoxious idiot who tells me that I need to contain them before they can pick them up.  Ya right, you try to contain two fiesty, filthy, fast, little rats and come back and tell me how it went.  Gees.  Then the mean Animal Control idiot goes "we have cat traps you can buy for $45." Um, sure, because that's what I like to spend my money on....effin cat traps. I bought groceries for 2 weeks last night and it didn't cost but $42. Then they *might* come pick them up within the week once they're contained to the cat trap.  Great, sounds just effin great.  If you like cats, more power to you but adopt one, love it, take care of it and keep it confined within your property. Or at least check up on it and keep tabs on it once in a while. People get them and just conveniently forget about them.  That is so effin irresponsible. There is a leash law with dogs. There are consequences if you let a dog roam and the laws are very strict.   I can't even count how many people I've pissed off in the past 24 hours by saying "I'm not a cat person".  Well, hell, if all these people are such "cat lovers" then come pick up these two little rodents and make me a believer.    End vent.   Music Playing: Feed Jake ~ Pirates Of The Mississippi

       In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life.  It goes on.  ~ Robert Frost   Oy, isn't that the truth.    When I got to work this morning everyone was buzzing around and it turns out someone broke into the back equipment area. They stole one of our Ford trucks, ran it through our huge gate, drove it to a little store down the road, broke in and stole an ATM machine.    This is the fourth time something like this has happened this  year so the general manager over the location is adamant that we move.  Hitler and I work at this location but we work in the sourcing department that is located in the corporate office in Houston so nothing is up to us since we just office here.   I have to admit that I was just getting comfortable with our office setting, or lack their of. In 2002 we moved from a building up front where we had our own offices to where we are now. Hitler and I share a big office with a bathroom and kitchen and although he's not the best cellmate I'd rather bunk with him versus one of the people up front that actually works for the location. So, if we move, all the changes that will ensue will be scary.    I like change for the most part, but on the other hand it sucks in many ways too.  And since we're basically renting from the location we have to go where ever they go despite our personal wishes.   I dislike not having a voice in a situation.

      So I come in from work this afternoon.  For a recap of how I was feeling check my below post.  I plan an afternoon of relaxation.  With eating dinner, napping, and watching tv on the agenda.  6:30pm:  I crash on the couch.  7:30pm:  Sound asleep.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Here's the conversation:            ME:  Hello           Mom's Annoying Friend (MAF):  Hi Jamie! It's Mrs. X           ME:   (Not awake) Oh hey, how are you?           MAF:  Great, thanks. How's the family?           ME:   (Still not awake) Everyone's great...           MAF:  Well fantastic. Hey listen, could you do me a favor?           ME:   Sure, what's up?           MAF:  Well Mr. X needs surgery on his back and I called the blah-blah                health department and supposedly the doctor we're wanting to               use has had 12 malpractice lawsuits against him since 1995.           ME:   (Totally not interested) Really?           MAF:  Yes, and so I was wondering if you could look up this website...she               rattles off some long ass address...and see what the suits are over?           ME:   (Nowhere near a pen or piece of paper)  Sure, I got that address and               I'll look it up and call you back.           MAF:  His name is ::insert the most foreign name you've heard::           ME:   Okay, great, I wrote that down.  I'll call you back shortly.           MAF:  Wonderful.  Talk to you soon darling.  Eff.  I fall back on the couch and wake up at 9:45pm.  I jump up and run to my computer, trying to remember all the stupid information she told me.  I start to panic because I can't find one single document about him.  Turns out she spelled his name wrong.  But of course.  I finally stop searcing at 9:55pm because I'm scared her and said husband have went to bed. I call her and half way make up what I found. I pray this will be a short phone call, to no avail. I am finally released at 10:15.  People, it's called an internet connection...look into it.     Music Playing:  Unhappy ~ Outkast

      My dad is 48...he'll be 49 on September 26th.    I was born when he was 24.    I'm 24 right now.  It's odd to think, if I were to be in my father's position, that I would be the proud owner of twins right now.    I could go on and on about my dad but I'll shorten the sap to one story.   When my brother and I were 9 years old my brother got hit by a car. He was riding his bike with a friend and like a stupid kid will do he thought he had enough time to cross the street before the car would come in contact with him.  He didn't make it and it flipped him about 10 feet in the air. His friend's mom called my mom and we met them at the hospital. He had a bunch of x-rays done and came out with a broke leg and minor bruises. We got home and mom tucked Justin in her and dad's bed and we sat with him until he fell asleep.  Mom had not called dad because she knew he would get really upset at work and since Justin was okay, she decided to wait to tell him until he got home from work. Dad arrived home and mom told him what had happened. He ran into the bedroom and fell on his knees, crying and praying, thanking God that his little boy was okay.  That's my dad.

      I got home from the below mentioned shindig about 2 hours ago. I did some laundry and also cleaned the bathroom. And changed into my ever-so-sexy pajamas. Those being comfy, stretchy Mossimo shorts from  urlLink Target  and a t-shirt with clouds on it from God knows where.    I got hot and decided the sleeves on my shirt were bothering me.  Enough to take it off and grab the scissors.  I proceed to cut the sleeves off.  One sleeve down, one to go.  Cut, cut, snip, snip, jab, oops.  I got in a hurry and cut the piece that was connecting the front part of my shirt to the back part of my shirt (aka: shoulder piece).    It now looks like  urlLink Donnatella Versace's  special sister designed it. One side looks great...just like a sleeveless shirt. The other side has nothing over my shoulder....and just sorta sits over my right breast and hangs on my back.    So ghetto.    Music Playing: Hot In Herre ~ Nelly

      I picked my nieces up from daycare yesterday and we had a groovy time. I pulled them around the neighborhood in the wagon for the majority of the afternoon. We wagoned over a couple of streets to the little elementary school and they played on the equipment.  Just for the record, I still suck at the monkey bars. Hang on the first pole, drop....hang on the first pole, drop.  Story of my life.   I have enjoyed my day off today. I slept in, cleaned up a bit, read, watched Oprah and took a nap.    The next couple of days should be fun too. Tomorrow I'm going out of town with the 'rents and a few more people to relax and soak up the rays.  Sunday I'll be going to my brother's for a 4th celebration and pool party. And Monday I'm going to the 'rents humble abode for a little BBQ fiesta they are having.    Life is good.

      The one that lives a couple of doors down.  No relation to the below mentioned music-playing-to-loud neighbor.  This guy never goes to work.  And I've tested the time thing....he's there morning, noon and night. He's in his 30s. Probably more late than early 30s, but not over 39 for sure.  He doesn't appear to have any family living with him. He drives a new ride. Has friends come over often and enjoys a good BBQ.    When I wake up in the morning, go struggling out the door to work, not at all awake, he's leisurely sitting on his porch just hanging out.  Chillin'.  Smokin'. Lovin' life.  He'll wave real big and shout "mornin'!" to which I'll smile and wave back, mumbling under my breath "wussup lazy ass!".    I'm not jealous of him, it's just odd to me that he doesn't work. He could be on disability or something.  Of course he may be independently wealthy. And if that's the case then I am, infact, jealous of him. Who knows. It's really none of my business.  Maybe I need to stop being a nosy neighbor and leave him alone.   This reminds me of a quote by Mignon McLaughlin:   The total history of almost anyone would shock almost everyone.

      I *heart* weekends like this.  My plans?  Nada!    I took my nieces to Chuck E Cheese (A.K.A: The Adult Torture Chamber) last night. They had the requisite good time, and left exhausted (score!). Hee  This morning my 4 yr old niece did not forget our agreement from last night, which was, if she stayed with nanny and poppy (my parents) last night, I would come pick her up "when da sun comes up".  So, I did. We hung out and played Polly Pocket and watched Grease (her fav).  She now knows every song and almost every word.  I'm not so sure if that's good or bad.  Tonight and tomorrow will be All About Me!   Alright, now on to the funny story about Hitler.  Hee.  He comes back from lunch yesterday and is all "I ate so much, now I need a nap".  I was at my desk eating my sandwich and so I just nodded and said "uh huh" (which is my response to most anything he says.....which translates into "just shut up ya schmuck!").  So, I'm eating my lunch, the noise level is minimized to my small fountain on my desk and all of the sudden I hear "SSSSNNNOOORRREEEE".  Yep.  That's right....Hitler caught a little catnap. After the second snore he popped up so fast he damn near fell out of his chair. He hurriedly picks up the phone and dials someone, anyone!, and then can't remember who he was calling.   What a fat gut.     Music Playing: Goodnight Sweetheart ~ Al Bowlly

      Mom called tonight and wanted to know if I could show her how to set up an Ebay account so she could find some antiques she's been wanting.  She's not very computer saavy.  "Do I need to pick up my mouse and point it at the screen and *then* click?"    This will take 20 years off my life.    No.  Way.    Music Playing: You're Momma Don't Dance ~ Poison

       urlLink The Race  is back.  I'm obsessed, already. Like wanna-join-the-cult obsessed.  My favorite team so far is  urlLink Brandon and Nicole  because I like the way they calmly communicate.  And they are so damn cute! I'm also enjoying the  urlLink father/daughter team  and the other two I like are the  urlLink moms  and the  urlLink little person team .  The little person team cracked me up with the "let's play a round of blackjack!"   The team I am currently loathing is the former big brother idiot and her ex-boyfriend, A.K.A:  urlLink Allison and Donny .    The other teams I feel neutral about.   Have I mentioned I'm obsessed with this show?    Music Playing: Crazy In Love ~ Beyonce

      So, allow me to recap.  Sorry if I get chatty. I've missed Da Blog!  Saturday was fantab.  The highlight was getting a spa pedicure.  Oh dear sweet Jesus. I know the whole "you're going to get a fungus" spiel everyone's blabbing right now so please don't email me and reinforce it, mkay?   So, after getting the pedicure, I aptly named the spa lady, Nancy-The-Spa-Nazi. Hee. Girlfriend knew what she was doing and did it without telling you anything. I upgraded the normal spa pedicure to the "super spa pedicure" so it was an hour long with a lot more benefits.  One of the "benefits" was getting all the dead skin shaved off my feet. Sexy, right?  She lathered my legs and feet over and over with various creams, salt scrubs, oils, lotions and even dipped my feet in hot wax in the end. Ouch! My favorite part was the salt scrub that made my skin tingle...then she wrapped my legs with steamed towels and when she took them off it was bliss. My least favorite part was when she popped my toes....like you would your knuckles....she literally pulled them until they popped. It was odd to me that I was paying someone to inflict torture on me in that capacity. (I believe that was about the time I came up with her nickname.) However, in the end I didn't even want to put back on my shoes my legs and feet felt so good. After shopping all day and being outside in the sun it really helped to relax like that.   Sunday I did the requisite 4th of July hoop-la....family and food. Both in excess. Hee.  That night a bunch of us loaded up in my brother and sister-in-law's suburban and went to see the city fireworks show. My nieces went with us and I still can't believe how my 1 1/2 year old niece acted. Her and her 4 yr old sister crawled over the seat in the "way-way back" as my niece calls it...and they played and danced around to  urlLink The Girl From Ipanema . Hee. (They love that cd and all the adults did too so it worked out great.)  When the fireworks started my niece was still in the way-way back and she started jumping up and down screaming "wow!".  One of her first words has became "wow!". It was hilarious. She was banging her head on the window in hysterics over the fireworks. It was worth the waiting, traffic and all to see her so excited.    A fun time was had by all.  And I really enjoyed my 4 day weekend. I could get use to that.    Music Playing: American Child ~ Phil Vassar

          Good News:       &nbsp;   Dear Blog People, &nbsp;    Thanks for the  c  o  l  o  r , fonts and HTML upgrades.    &nbsp;  Love,     Jamie        Bad News:      Martha was   urlLink  sentenced    today.&nbsp; Many more trades were made the very day Martha made hers.&nbsp; A women builds an empire from the ground up and they find a way to destroy it.&nbsp; I know she lied.&nbsp; And I know that is the ultimate reason she was indicted.&nbsp; I agree that she shouldn't have lied, but I don't agree with the bad rap she's getting or her sentencing.&nbsp; It's as if the feminist movement never happened and it's unjust.&nbsp; It just is.

      Does it get any better?!  Buh bye team  urlLink Dysfunction ! I knew they were next although I was a little sad to see them go because I was looking forward to their final relationship meltdown.    I now love team  urlLink HiLo .  Team  urlLink Runway  is still up there in my book.  The  urlLink twins  are annoying the heck outta me. Hating someone because they're competitive?! The nerve!  This isn't a race or anything!  Team  urlLink Wounded Knee  is still rocking along much to my excitement.  The  urlLink bowling moms  have *the* best attitudes!    I'm still enjoying the  urlLink parents  as well.  And I'm afraid  urlLink Colin and Christie  are going to take their boring selves pretty far in this competition.  They're quiet, confident and so blase' about life.  The rest of the  urlLink teams  I still feel neutral about.   Music Playing: Anywhere Is ~ Enya

        My grandfather turned 86 today. We had his party at a local restaurant.&nbsp; The whole family was there, including my mom's brother's family.&nbsp; My uncle is married and has two sons.&nbsp; One is 35, the other 43.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   My 35 year old cousin arrives at the party, gives my g-pa a very classy, nice gift and decides to sit next to him.&nbsp; In an effort to make conversation, here's what my g-pa comes up with:     &nbsp;    G-Pa: &nbsp; (serious) Say, Jeff, you think you'll ever make anything of yaself?      Cousin: &nbsp; (shocked and offended) Oh, I guess I'm doing the best I can.     &nbsp;   I sized up the situation and could tell grandpa wasn't going to relent and Jeff was obviously very offended so I&nbsp;looked over&nbsp;and said&nbsp;"well, that wasn't very nice.....and soooo not accurate".&nbsp; G-pa said "aww, I just speak my mind!"&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;      Jeff is,&nbsp;at&nbsp;35 years old, a Professor of Mathematics at a local university.&nbsp; He has a doctorates, which he finished in record time.&nbsp;He has built 2 homes, pays cash for everything, is always investing and saving, and is very respected in his profession.&nbsp; He has a beautiful wife and isn't an eye sore himself....wasn't hit with the ugly stick......or gross stick....or any other less than adequate stick.&nbsp; He's very involved in his church, is good to his family, very respectful to all he meets and lives life to the fullest.     &nbsp;   "Will you ever make anything of yaself"? &nbsp;    Oy.    &nbsp;   I don't care if you are 86 years old and HAVE lost your marbles...you just don't say something like that.&nbsp; Is there some law that&nbsp;grants you permission to&nbsp;say whatever the hell you want when you reach a certain age?&nbsp; I don't give a rats ass if you are old, if you can think up something mean to say you can think up something nice to say.&nbsp; Ignorance is ignorance...young or old, it doesn't matter.     &nbsp;   This hit a real sore spot for me because had he said it to me I would have told him to mind his own damn business because that's the attitude I take with people like that.&nbsp; Jeff, on the other hand, is not as mouthy and is, although very manly, not very confrontational so obviously this embarrassed him.&nbsp; Another reason this pissed me off was because when you're an over-achiever you tend to already push yourself to the extreme without anyone else getting in on the pushing. And so those kind of people don't need to hear what they are or aren't from outsiders, they are usually pushing themselves in excess on the inside.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Old people rank right up next to cats on my "Loathe List".      &nbsp;    Music Playing: Shut Up ~ Kelly Osbourne

       My nieces&nbsp;have been battling colds&nbsp;and have been staying with my mom this week. I know they are feeling better because I went to see them on my lunch break.     &nbsp;   My 4 yr old niece takes gymnastics.&nbsp; She flips, flops, cartwheels, stands on her head, throws herself in a backbend and acts like a spastic rabbit&nbsp;every free moment she has.&nbsp; My 1 1/2 yr old niece usually just watches her and looks at her like she's lost her mind.&nbsp; Well today, the older one decided to throw herself into a backbend and I guess the little one had had enough of her hyperactivity because she went over there and knocked her legs out from under her and went "sissy, top!"&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   That's my little Brynni....doesn't put up with any shit.     &nbsp;    Music Playing:&nbsp; Jump Around ~ House of Pain

       I need to wear a depends if   Team HiLo   keeps up the antics.&nbsp; I could *not* quit laughing.&nbsp; Between Charla being electrocuted&nbsp;and them parasailing, I couldn't contain myself.     &nbsp;   I was really sad to see the   Father/Daughter team   go.&nbsp; The ending was a definite Hallmark card moment.&nbsp; *tear*     &nbsp;   Still loving   Team Model  , Brandon and Nicole.     &nbsp;   The   Bowling Moms   are moving up my most favorite list as well.&nbsp; They are so athletic for their age and have the best attitude about everything.     &nbsp;     The Parents   are still high on my list too. I like the way they really trust each other and communicate....awwww. (shutup)     &nbsp;   I can relate to   Team Boring  , Colin and Christie for some reason.&nbsp; Colin finally showed some personality last night. Come to find out they are a good couple for each other.....he's high strung and very demanding and controlling, while she is laid back and very understanding.&nbsp; They wouldn't make it if she was high strung or if he was laid back.&nbsp; They're a good match. Not my favorite team, but&nbsp;you can relate to them&nbsp;which makes them fun to watch.     &nbsp;     The Brothers   annoy me for some reason.&nbsp; But then they will say something hilarious and I will, for a moment, enjoy them.&nbsp; Like when the one brother was trying to get the bandana off the cows neck and goes "I disagree with the whole running thing".&nbsp; Hee.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     The Twins   aren't very amusing anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's annoying when they are&nbsp;blatenly mean to&nbsp;The&nbsp;Parents. &nbsp;What was Chip suppose to do....let them win?&nbsp; Come on! It's a game, every team for themselves.     &nbsp;   And lastly, the   Internet Couple   is getting on my nerves.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are just goofy.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Oh, I can't wait until next week!&nbsp; It keeps getting better and better.&nbsp; My obsession for the show has crossed into the danger zone.&nbsp; I will hang on to my tapes of the episodes and probably watch them for months after the show is over.&nbsp; However, if I'm watching&nbsp;them 6 months from now, my family and friends have my permission to&nbsp;commit me.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    Song Playing: Check Yo Self ~ Ice Cube

         STOP BEING SO DAMN NICE TO STRANGERS .    &nbsp;  Really.&nbsp; It's getting to be a problem.       &nbsp;  Case #3,497    &nbsp;   I make the Wal-Mart trak.&nbsp;&nbsp;I drift all through one side of the store...from the garden center, through the necessities part (tampons, toothpaste, ect..), then on the toys, and electronics, then to the kid clothes department, and up and down all the dishes, laundry, cleaning products isles.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At this point I was calm, cool, collected and enjoying myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I start on the second leg of tour de Wal-mart....the groceries.&nbsp; I round the first isle, pick up bottled water and I'm off.&nbsp; I get to the end of the isle and just as I'm fixing to round the corner another buggy pusher is trying to turn into my current isle. Without seeing the pusher I say "you can come on around".&nbsp; I'm smiling, being warm and nice and an old, short, homeless-looking man rounds the corner.&nbsp; He is filthy from head to toe and smells like he's bathed in whiskey.&nbsp; He says "thanks" and goes on.&nbsp; The next 10 or so isles every time I look up he's there. Smiling, saying "hello".&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Then I get to the frozen food section and&nbsp;notice that an older black gentleman and obviously his grand-daughter are standing in front of the door of shelves that hold my beloved splenda-sweetened frozen yogurt ice cream bars.&nbsp; Hmph.&nbsp; I park my buggy on the opposite side and wait patiently.&nbsp; Out of the blue, and before either recognize me, the grand-daughter asks the grandpa if she can have some ice cream she had spotted and he goes "no, you'll grow up to be a fat girl....big and fat and ugly!"&nbsp;       &nbsp;   Oy.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     The little girl turned around, as if on cue and made eye contact with me and looked funny, obviously, as I fit the description of a "big, fat girl"....but not of the insult he added on to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Author's Note:&nbsp;Watch my blog the next few days for an editorial regarding Being Fat In America.)&nbsp;There are a ton of people around at this point all sorta staring to see what was going to unfold next.&nbsp; The little grand-daughter looked terrified and embarrassed so I&nbsp;winked and &nbsp;laughed to the little girl to ease&nbsp;her embarrassment.&nbsp; She laughed and said "grandpa you shouldn't say stuff like that...you never know who is around!"&nbsp; He goes "well dats da truef".&nbsp; Then he turns around and sees me. Great.&nbsp; He starts trying to backpedal..."I like all womens, every one...and I really love the ones like you....big, shapely, sexy curves, welcoming hips and thighs,....curves are sexy, fine, love em...just like you".&nbsp; (note to wide-eyed reader:&nbsp; I'm not kidding).&nbsp; And then the&nbsp;grand-daughter chimes in "my sunday&nbsp;school teacher said to love e'ryone&nbsp;da same&nbsp;and&nbsp;dat's what I does,&nbsp;and I think yo purtty, I do's".&nbsp;  &nbsp;   I. JUST. WANT. MY. FROZEN. YOGURT. ICE. CREAM. BARS. &nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I could see they weren't fixing to move anytime soon so I go&nbsp;to the&nbsp;door next to him&nbsp;hoping that I can reach the&nbsp;box I want from there, to no avail.&nbsp; F-I-N-A-L-L-Y he decides on&nbsp;some Carb Smart Chocolate&nbsp;Bars and moves about a foot to continue his "I likes all womens...every single last one of em'.....I do's, I love dem all".&nbsp; I&nbsp;race&nbsp;to the door before he changes his mind and&nbsp;almost break my neck trying to get one of the last&nbsp;two boxes&nbsp;and he&nbsp;opens the one up next to it and we're face to&nbsp;face, not 3 inches away from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he starts (in my face)&nbsp;"OH MY GAH,&nbsp;have I been in yo way da whole time?!"&nbsp; I refrained from&nbsp;saying "HELL YEA".&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I throw my box of goods in my buggy, literally and haul ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were both still talking to me as I ran away.&nbsp; I ventured into the produce department thankful that little exchange was over and was getting cantaloupe when I heard them nearing. I ducked down and squatted between the cantaloupe and apples.&nbsp; I eased back up a minute later and while I looked like a fool to all the produce buyers, I had managed to escape round 2!&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;   All in the name of being nice.&nbsp; One day I'll learn.     &nbsp;     Music Playing: Enough ~ Heart &nbsp;

       This post may not be for anyone with a weak stomach and/or strong wordly opinions.       Before I go any further, let me say that in real life, I don't consider myself a nosy person. On the whole, I pretty much like to tend to my life and what's happenin' with my family and friends and it stops there. I care about people, but I pretty much keep to myself and obliviously expect others do the same. However, for some reason I love being nosy on the net....looking at family webpages, blogs and such on the internet because it astonishes me some of the things people put on the web. Personal issues. Triumphs. Victories. Heartaches. Despair. Regret. Deep thoughts. None-the-less ALL personal.       So, on to the point of this.      After reading one of my favorite blogs from an author, I clicked on a link from her website. That link took me to another website, which took me to another one. You get the drift. I landed at this "All About Our Family" website. One of those "billy just started his freshman year and loves army men", all-too-often updated family websites. After just leisurely scanning through the various pages, I clicked on a memorial page. It was a page dedicated to this couple's 28 year old son.....the lady's biological son, the man's step-son.       I figured it would be a wreck or accident of some sort that had claimed his life. Some tragic event that is usually to blaim for claiming a young life. Instead as I read further I found out he had died of AIDS . I kept reading about how he was diagnosed at the age of 22 and how he so bravely went through numerous tests, self-discovery, and even planned his own death (in a round about way) and funeral. As I scrolled down my heart broke for this family and for this young man.       I got to the end of the wording and there were pictures. Pictures of his funeral. Everyone (including his partner) in beautiful rainbow colors. Balloons, smiling, celebrating.      Then as I moved the page down further there was a statement that read (paraphrased) "Ken wanted pictures taken of his last days". And there before my eyes were pictures of a withering man. A man that was succumbing to a horrific virus. Very real, however gruesome. Ghastly. Horrifying.          I know I have lived a somewhat sheltered life, for the most part. I, myself, do not have any homosexual family members or friends. That's not to say I disapprove of the lifestyle, it's just the way my life has shaped up. So it's safe to say, I've never been a part of AIDS research, donations or the like. Homosexuality is not something I ponder on a lot. The closest I've came to having an opinion on this subject is when Rosie O'Donnel came out in 2002. I enjoyed her talk show and decided that it's important to be accepting of others because you never know what they have went through in life. Thus, I don't condemn homosexuals. I think that you should be able to love who you wanna love but be safe, legal and humble. I personally don't care what goes on in other people's bedrooms.       To me the part that is wrong is when people are closed minded about others. It's not right to force your opinions on someone so strongly that they become depressed, bitter, angry, and promiscuous. What good comes out of that? Nothing. In the end a young life is taken and that is officially The End of the fight. A mother has lost her son. The End.      Acceptance and love go much further then hate and judgment.       That webpage has forever changed my thoughts and perspectives on homosexuals. My prayer is that one day we can all live in a world where no one is judged for their differences.       We all end up in the same place.

        How much do I love thee? Let me count the ways.     Ahhh, I've been without my beloved Honda for 5 days now because it's been in the shop getting fixed from my wreck that I had two weeks ago. I've had a Toyota Camry rental car which has been a pain because in order to stop or halt the moving contraption you have to put both feet on the brake. I suppose the previous chumps who rented it turned it in to the Shaggin' Wagon' or something.      So I get it back this afternoon and I couldn't be happier. In fact, I'm so happy I wrote a little poem about it. Wanna hear it...here it goes:          Ode To My Honda

       Ahhh the 5th episode of  urlLink  The Amazing Race  ! Five glorious, fun-filled hours so far!       Oh how I love this show.      So,    The Brothers    quit. Marshall's knee just couldn't' take it anymore. Although they weren't one of my favorites, I did begin to like them in the last couple of episodes.       I'm loving    Chip and Kim    and    The Moms    more and more. They are my top 2 teams.      Still loving    Team Model    and    Team Boring   ...which should be renamed Team No-Patience.         Team HiLo   , Mirna and Charla....Oy Vey. Those two are something else. They're funny and entertaining, yet odd and annoying all at the same time. I love when they fight with the other teams...it's even funnier when little Charla is looking up trying to get all up in it.       And    The Twins   ......they're just yappy and flighty. No real strong feelings of love or hate for them.      Have I mentioned I soooooo love this show?     Song Playing: Better Than The Rest ~ Queen Latifah

       Mom is having a little back-to-school party/luncheon for her friends today. She asked me to come over last night to inspect the house and make sure it was good to go. When I walked into her and dad's room I go "YO! Ma, when you bring your homies through your room, pat your bed and go THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS!"       She goes "ALRIGHT! I WILL!".       I know she didn't get it but I'm dying to see if she follows through with it!       Poor moms.......and they love their kids unconditionally.       Song Playing: P.I.M.P ~ 50 Cent
