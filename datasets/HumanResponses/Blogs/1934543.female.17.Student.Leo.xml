      Saturday  Just a normal day in a german soccer fan's life. I am sitting here watching TV (my favorite soccr team) and just talking to some people on msn.  My soccer team is winning right now-just the way it should be- and so i am really happy right now. I am also talking to this american gal, i dont wanna say names. And i am really happy....soccer team scored again. Now it is 3-0 and i am really happy about that.  Today was a really crappy day outside as it was raining all day long and i was just lying on my bed watching TV and eating. I think i will get fat again as there is nothing to do.

      Well it is really boring. I got so many channels in my TV and satellite and I don't care about any of the movies that are on.  What a sick day. None of the movies I have ever heard of and the only thing that I stop at is the soccer channel with games that I saw about a million times already. Why don't these Hollywood buttheads tape their movies faster so that there is more good stuff to watch on TV. So the only thing i am doing apart from zapping right now is talking to some people from back over at the midwest and the person i am really waiting for aint coming on and i sure hope that that person will come on really quick. I know it is early but i am already really tired. Watching TV and eating the whole day makes everyone really tired. But on the other hand i am on break, so i can sleep tommorrow :-) For now i am still hoping for that person to come online and then we will see!

      Hey Everyone  Just woke up on a crappy sunday morning. It is raining it is too early to do anything but watch TV and eat. As i am just the only one thats awake at this time it sucks too, because i would love to just run thorugh the house yelling, just for the sake of yelling. Well  i hope that everybody in the midwest gets some good night of sleep and for now that was ME with a few words of wisdom. GOOD NIGHT (?or are you already sleeping?)

      I made you an administrator. So now you can also change some stuff if you would like to.:-)  Good morning/ good night  It is about nine in the morning and i just got up so i can barely hold my eyes open but i am trying hard. I got myself out of bed that early because i was kinda hoping that holliejo would still be on but she aint. Thats alright i guess because she wrote in the blog.  First things first. I wont get together with that girlfriend again. I thought about that last night and i figured that it just wouldnt be right and so i am not gonna be with that girl anymore/never ever again. I dont know if that makes hollie happy but it sure makes me happy because no i can worry about other things and dont have to think about my lousy relationship with that girl. For the next months you can also be sure that i wont get a gf.So nothingto worry about and if holliejo finds someone that perfectly fits to her she can always tell me because i will be really happy for her. Because hollie needs a guy that stays with her no matter what, that can deal with her time to time attitude problems and crazyness, and can handle all the power that shes got. I know this sounds really hard, but someone that will really love her will be able to handle all those problems and still be able to smile all the time just like hollie herself. WEll i kinda gotta get some breakfast in so i wish you all a good night and take care until the morning.  Lovelots German

      Hey....I need to talk to Stefan about getting all the coments and stuff thing up...and then I don't have a title bar thingy so I can't really put in a title...so that sucks   How Do I Do This Without Hurting Him...No Not You Stefan :D   This shout out...or thank you...just prefer to be dorky right about now...anyway...so Stefan is great...he doesn't think he is...but whatever...he doesn't know what he is talking about...cuz he's German...and that explains a lot of things...well...Stefan is great...he really is...I mean from the last what?? year or so..we've gotten so close and that totally rocks becuase I never thought that we could ever be so close...so that means that I could tell him anything and know that he would help me find the right path to go down...because well...I seem to get lost really easy...it's just one thing...but Stefan he helps me down the right path and makes sure I run...by threatening me with a volleyball...he's great...you know...just great...he's helped me a lot of times and I wished that I could just help him as much as he helps me...because that is what friends are for.  I'm prutty proud of what we have done...just becasue how many people can make a friendship out of something that wasn't there before he left to go half way across the world?? Well...that's just what me and Stefan did...we made our lousy relationship into what we could call: kick ass friendship that nothing is gonna seperate us.  Okay...so he's great and he's one of my many best friends...I mean I can't think about him without realizing that he's always gonna be there for me no matter what...there's Stefan then everyone else...that's the way I feel about it.  He's great and I wish that I could have someone like him near me all the time...not odd times of the day on the internet for about 20 minutes...that bothers me...I just want him all the time...oops! I forgot this is his blog..oh well...I dunno...he's great..  Okay...so now to his gurl problems...when I  heard that...I mean I got jealous...becuase I mean I don't like when people have a love life and I don't...okay...so I do kinda...but no that isn't the half of it...I mean I think that I wish I was with Stefan for some stupid reason...maybe so I don't have to be scared anymore...but you know that isn't gonna work..I just want him to be happy...and I mean I know that I have to learn to be happy too...and if he gets with his girlfriend then you know that he is going to be happy...and if not...well he always has me to fall back on...I mean not like that...but he always has me to be there for him...no matter what...always and forever...and I'm leaving it at that...  Lovelots holliejo

      Hey  Back in business again. I know its been a while since i last blogged in my blog but now i am finally back because i want all of you guys to know whats kicking in my life...and whats not. Well just talked to holliejo before she left and we talked about some serious stuff concerning her love-life...if there is one, because she isnt really positive about that aspect of her otherwise hard life. Not really lots new here. My ex-gf stopped by the house today and i kinda didnt really talk to her so she left after about 10 minutes, kinda angry that i didnt really talk but thats alright, too, because she was an ass first and now shes gotta pay for it. On the other hand i still like her a lot, but shes back together with her old boyfriend and i dont really know what to do. She s telling me all those things about that she still loves me and that she is only with him because she made a mistake and didnt wanna admit it to me. Well anyways. i dont really know what to think about the whole thingy with her. All i know is that my heart keeps telling me that i still love her and my mind says that i should stay away from her.....oh man this means hard times for a german.  WEll for now i gotta go because there will be the next match for the european soccer championships which i dont wanna miss because they are in the quarterfinals. So hope that you might also post something in my blog now that i am back on..,...yeah i am talking to you you crazy american girl holliejo... take care you guys and gals  lovelots Da German

That is all..nothing else...that is prutty bad if you think about it...I dunno though...I guess it isn't all that bad....I hope not anyway...so I'm out...I have to write some more thank yous and what not lovelots holliejo :D
