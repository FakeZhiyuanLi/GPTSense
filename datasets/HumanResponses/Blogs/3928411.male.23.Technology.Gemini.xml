       TOO MUCH SEX CAN KILL YOU    from the article on "The Good Life" in Manila Standard by Marie A. Acosta   This is a take off from the movie "Ants in the Pants", a German satire which explores sexual fantasy of an adolescent. What is original about the movie, although I would never recommend it to my son, is that here the penis  talks to the teenager.  If only the male organ can really talk, based on medical science and Oriental books on sex like the Kama Sutra from  India, Tao of Sex from China, Pillow Book from Japan, and the Perfumed Garden from the Arabs, it would beg every man - the unfaithful married husband and the promiscuous unmarried man - to be more careful about sex, otherwise it can really derange his mind or shorten his lifespan.  Sex is meant for pleasure and procreation. Good sex adds joie de vivre to life and work, and lengthens the years of one's life. Abused sex results in loss of money, shame in the family, and lack of respect in society, besides all the physical symptoms of chronic fatigue, low resistance to diseases and excessive strain on the circulatory system.  One can live to about 101 years, if one makes use of sex for the good of the body and soul. But one loses extra years, mind you, not just days of one's life, for every bad sexual trip.  As a form of appreciation for all those e-mail and telephone calls and positive feedback about my last article on "Sensing an Unfaithful Husband" I am also revealing and unrevealing in a very hermeneutic manner certain personal discoveries I have learned while reading ancient Oriental books on sex and teaching psychology. Let us just call this a primer on sex therapy.  1.  Healthy sex is not just getting orgasm between man and woman or between mates. There must be an exchange of essences or fluids between lovers.  Just as a man should give his semen and his seminal fluid, which is the purest protein in the body, he must also receive the three essences of a woman. These fluids flow from the following:  The two ducts under her tongue (accdg. to the Tao of Sex, the man should lick this secretion with his own tongue and swallow it for it is extremely beneficial to health; Her breasts, white, milky, sweet tasting, and superior to all three libations,  especially if the woman has not yet lactated; Her female organ.  These three secretions come only when she is fully aroused, her face red and her voice moaning with passion. Thus, if the man does not carry her to full arousal and ejaculates beforehand, he gives but never receives. He loses his semen and gets nothing in return. This shortens his life.  2.  Upon ejaculation, a man depletes precious stores of essence and energy and it would take some time - a minimum of three days - to replenish them. It takes longer to replenish semen than blood lost in a blood donation. So all those men boasting in talk shows about making love five times a day to five different women or even to the same woman are really lying through their teeth or dooming themselves to death. Assuming there are professional studs who can service five women one after another or the same woman in up to the fifth session, they would have lost so much seminal fluid, which is also the cerebrospinal fluid coming from the brain, and such a massive loss would derange the mind. Only human beings and a few apes engage in sexual intercourse without rhyme or reason, all year long, day and night, in any season or weather.  Even lower forms of animals have better instincts. Experts in sex choose the woman of good essence, healthy and young even after midlife, and makes love regularly with her based on the needs of the body and time. Preferably, according to sex adepts, it should be done at 10 to 12 midnight, when the moon is waxing and never when the moon is waning, also preferably during spring, never in winter and seldom in summer.  3.  The female is really like the black widow or praying mantis among the insects. The male praying mantis deposits his seeds. Then promptly the female kills and devours the male as a post-coital snack!  If a man knows how and when to make love, the better becomes his health. While if the man is ignorant and careless, just one woman, one mistress, or one prostitute is sufficient to hasten his journey to the grave.  4.  For health purposes, a robust 20-year-old male may ejaculate twice daily. A 30-year-old should do it once every two days. A 40-year-old may do so only once every four days. A 50-year-old should do it only once every ten days. A 60-year-old may emit once every 10 days but prudence requires that he should do it only once every 20 days. At 70, he can emit once a month,but then again, it is advisable for him to refrain from emitting semen at all.  Artists and athletes rely on the optimum levels of physical and mental vitality in their work. Thus, they are more sensitive to the loss of semen and vital energy through uncontrolled ejaculation, which makes them more prudent in their bedroom arts. They should not ejaculate before a sports event or an artistic endeavor.  5.  If the tendency of a man is to sleep after making love, it is a prime indicator of complete exhaustion. It is not orgasm, but the physical ejection of semen that harms man. Incidentally, orgasm never harms a woman.Man should therefore learn to make love, without ejecting semen or the technique of semen retention, or without ejecting much or all of his semen. He should know how to retain enough for his own good health, vigor and strength. When semen is retained, it goes back to the cerebrospinal fluid and nourishes the brain. Post-coital blues or depression does not occur when a man retains enough semen.  6.  Ejaculation is strictly forbidden when a man is drunk, sick or gorged with food. And yet now many men insist on doing so. Such injure a man a hundred times over, causing dizziness and sores. Men who ejaculate at the rate of more than once a day may eventually lose their minds, since 20 percent of male semen is composed of cerebrospinal fluid. It causes chronic drain of the vital fluids that the brain and spine require to function. Deficiency in cerebrospinal fluid results in premature senility, inability to concentrate, chronic depression, loss of sexual drive, loss of the trace element called zinc and therefore loss of memory, mental confusion, paranoia and hypersensitivity.  7.  Masturbation is an irretrievable and uncompensated loss of semen essence. Healthy males between 16 and 21 are fountains of semen. Loss of semen in self stimulation or wet dreams are relatively harmless at that age. But by the age of 25, there will be weakness in the thighs and knees, numbness in the lumbar region, loss of vitality, and depression. By age 30, men should give up this self-destructive habit and start conserving semen. Men who habitually abuse themselves in their 30s, 40s and 50s rob themselves of the very essence and energy that fuel their lives and protect their health.  8.  Homosexual relations is relatively harmless to women but highly detrimental to men, both physiologically and psychologically. Two passive female forces do not conflict. But two active male forces result in a fundamental conflict of energies. The necessary exchange of essences between male and female is absent there. In medical research, when sperm from two different men are mixed together and observed under a microscope, they are observed fighting one another in a desperate struggle for supremacy. At least both ancient books on sex and modern medical research agree on this, without going into moral issues. The end result of such physiological exchange is weakness, fatigue skin ulcers, boils, low immunity, and impotence.  9.  It is important for lovers to breathe each other's breath and exchange bio-energy during foreplay. But one should not breathe in the other's mouth during orgasm for it is full of waste and toxins. On the other hand, there is a profound physiological and electrical outburst of energy that partners can absorb radiating from maximum surface skin contact. The bio-energy comes from the skin of a woman in heat. Good sexual energy goes inward and upward and should not be lost downward through the organs. This energy can be felt coursing up along the spine as goose bumps or heat waves.  10.  The essential elements of good, healthy sex is balance, harmony, and the union of opposites. Making love can nourish and preserve precious vital essence, cure ailments and promote long life.  To conclude, the art of the bedroom consists in suppressing emission, absorbing a woman's fluids, and making the semen return to strengthen  the brain, therefore, attaining longevity. Man must learn how to treasure and preserve the semen and maintain high levels of testosterone, sperm, and other male essence.  Sex is for good health and social peace. It should not be motivated merely by physical beauty or romantic love. Even Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung argued that most crimes and anti-social or asocial behavior can be traced back to dysfunctional sex. Men and women, therefore, who are adept in the bedroom arts, contribute to social order and even world peace, as they promote good health and happiness.
