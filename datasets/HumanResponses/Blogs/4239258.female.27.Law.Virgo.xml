      So I have to be in this wedding in September.  I am trying to convince my friend Peter M to escort me to this wedding, but so far he will not commit to it.  My Hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so I am going to have to go solo if Peter doesn't go.  It is a Bolivian/Irish wedding.  The bride is about 5'2" and the groom is about 6'4", plus the groom looks about as Irish as Irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the Bride looks truly Bolivian.  They are quite an interesting couple to see.   So the problem is that the only people I will know at the entire wedding are the bride, groom and bride's mother.  Most of the people on the bride's side are from Bolivia and speak very little English.  I know that this sounds like a very fun event, but if Peter M was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me ; )  Oh, here is the interesting thing:  The groom has multiple piercings.  Including his penis and testicles.  I am all okay with the piercing thing and everything, but I can't help but thinking the ding-a-ling piercing has got to hurt.  Oh and he did them all himself.  I asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did.  Dude, that means his dick is like a freaking colander!  That is a bit strange to me.  I would be afraid to have sex with him (not that I would want to anyway), for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located.  Okay that would be just TOO CREEPY!  Okay enough rambling about nothing, anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her.

      I have tried the blogging thing and I am confused.  I am not tech savvy and my blog looks stupid.  I don't know how to add other blogs.  Oh well, chalk up another failed experiment.

      I am sitting here posting this because I have been forced to by this lame friend of mine.  I have a boring life, I do nothing, I am nothing and I am sure no one wants to read about how I make my own babyfood and cloth diaper my child.
