      Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.&nbsp; It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.&nbsp; She will do and excellent job.  &nbsp;We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.&nbsp; So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.  Jake  Here is a pic of us in Germany

      Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.&nbsp; She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake
