      "Simpsons voice actors were receiving $125,000 per episode and considering how wildly profitable the show is for FOX, in syndication and merchandising, the actors felt they should get a bigger piece of the pie. The strike is settled with a 4 year contract for the actors, though FOX is mum about further details, so the show will go on. For a bit more on this see this article on BBC News or The Gate." -Slashdot

      "COIN-OP GIANT SAMMY has confirmed that it will be merging with Sega Corp, in a deal valuing Sega at $1.8 billion, which will make company the top dog in Japan's games industry.  

Sega, which has tragically been struggling for the last few years, will gain a nice financial boost after the last few years of disappointment. Sammy, which has been wriggling its way into the home videogame market with games such as Guilty Gear XX and Seven Samurai 20XX, will be able to fix its way firmly into the market with the help of Sega developers.   

As expected, Sammy head honcho Hajime Satomi will become the chairman of Sega Sammy Holdings Inc.; Sega's president will be vice chairman. 

Sammy and Sega will transfer shares over to a new holding company. The value of the transaction is around ¥212 billion.   


Sega yesterday announced its net profit had nearly tripled by the end of their fiscal year, at March 31. A year earlier, they were at just over ¥3 billion yen, but thanks to success with their coin-op machines in Japan and some cost cutting, they ended up with ¥8.76 billion.   

With Sammy and Sega's annual sales combined, they weigh in at around ¥440 billion – not too bad at all.Sammy's European HQ is just around the corner from INQ Central in Harrow."

       urlLink Zone-H.org  has reported "Famous Brazilian newspapers have been informed that a new hacking group composed of worldwide individuals (from Brazil, China, Hong Kong and Russia) has declared cyberwar on the United States of America.
 
Its name is Hackers Against America (HAA) and their web site is hosted on a Russian server. According to what is written on the main page, they plan to integrate new members and launch attacks against computers based in the US (cracking some of them but also use worms, viruses) in order to steal private documents. Some samples of documents and codes are available on the web site, although they don't seem to be secret at all and possible to find by using search engines."

MXM (Mobile PCI eXpress Module) 
•Faster time to market, with the latest graphics technology 
•One notebook design, sold into many notebook products 
•One notebook design that can use any graphics solution, from any vendor 
•Notebooks whose graphics technology can be upgraded through the channel or,
potentially by consumers 


 
  
  The modules themselves come in three &quot;flavors&quot; - MXM-I, MXM-II, and MXM-III. &nbsp;The proposed design is installed by sliding the module into the slot at a 20   - 30 degree   angle, rotating it into its final position (in contact with the cooling solution) and locking it into place with four screws. &nbsp;Also note that t he stand-off locations for the screws will be the same for all MXM graphics modules, which would allow one motherboard to support all three MXM graphics module types . &nbsp;Each of these modules will use the same slot, and each is backwards compatible with the other, but they have different physical attributes and can accommodate different components...   

 urlLink View the chart here.  
 
  In the chart above, each module varies in physical size, max power consumption, memory configuration and the maximum GPU size. &nbsp;MXM-I is designed for entry-level notebooks, MXM-II for medium form factors with somewhat higher performance, and MXM-III is designed for high-performance systems. &nbsp;MXM-I and MXM-II slots were also designed with the same thermal considerations in mind, but MXM-III slots will be equipped with beefier cooling solutions. &nbsp;At a maximum of 35W for an MXM-III slot, we obviously won't be seeing the power-hungry GeForce 6800 Ultra populating an MXM module anytime soon, but NVIDIA did tell us that this initiative will facilitate the introduction of their GeForce Go 6 Series of mobile GPUs derived from the NV40 architecture. &nbsp;I'm sure there will be some more information regarding mobile NV40 derivatives as it becomes available...
