         The Pistons have heard about their lack of a superstar for the past 3 seasons. Richard Hamilton is trying to end all of that talk. At a point about halfway through the  3RD QUARTER, THE PACERS WERE ONLY BEATING RIP HAMILTON BY 13. IN THE 3RD QUARTER. Hamilton had 30 and the Pacers had 43. Rip has been amazing, but this was a total team effort.    Did I mention Croshere is not that good?? As I have previously posted, if the Pacers try to rely on Croshere it would be to the Pistons advantage. Croshere was horrible in Sunday's game. No real surprise here. The Pistons basically controlled the entire game tonight from start to finish. Rasheed Wallace had a nice shooting game, Chauncey Billups played smart, and of course Ben controlled the lane and the boards.  This was near the Pistons best. Hopefully, they can bring the same at the Palace on Tuesday. GO PISTONS!! I love watching analysts and announcers flip-flop. Pick a team and stick with them.

       This game will be amazing. Both teams are fighting for their lives. The Detroit Pistons are coming off  PURE EMBARRASSMENT . Richard Hamilton was the only Piston who showed up offensively. The Pacers ran at full tilt. Rick Carlisle outcoached the shit out of Larry Brown.  SHOW ME SOMETHING LARRY .  It is time now to show the Piston's fans why we should be happy you are our coach . I have faith. I believe in this game we will make the Pacers pay if they come out with a lineup like they did in the last game. Rasheed must spend a whole lot of time on the block, if Croshere is in the game. Also, the defensive matchups need to change. Rasheed should not even be the player covering Croshere.  Ben Wallace should cover Artest  (w/ Croshere on the court). This would end the plays where the Pacers put Croshers at the top of the key and posted up Artest. The Pistons had no answer last game when these plays were being run.  Rasheed should be covering Jermaine Oneal .  Teyshaun Prince, Mehmet Okur, or Corliss Williamson should then be on Croshere . Croshere is not that good.  If they try to run their offense through Croshere  to take advantage of a match-up that will be  to the Piston's advantage .  I believe that this game will show which is the better team. Due to Indiana's 60 regular season wins they have a serious advantage from here on out. However, both teams have already shown they can win on each other's home court. Sunday at 8 EST, the battle will begin.  MAY THE BEST TEAM OF MEN WIN .   WHO WILL COME OUT ON TOP??

       On Saturday night Dmitri Young went 4 for 5 from the plate with 5 RBI. He hit for the  CYCLE . It was his first tune-up for his return to the Tigers with the AAA Mudhens. The Tigers are among the leaders in runs scored this season. His return to the lineup should do wonders for our lineup.  Too bad he can't pitch .    WILL DMITRI'S RETURN HELP GET THE TIGERS OVER .500 FOR THE LONG HAUL?? COMMENT BELOW

       Minnesota won. But, I don't really care. It doesn't mean much of anything other than a few extra bucks on the Daily Pick, and for the NBA. Game 6 is the big one. If Minnesota wants to  show me something   WIN IN LOS ANGELES . I would love to say that this win was huge for the Timberwolves. It wasn't. A win in Game 6 however, would be GINORMOUS (your damn right I said it). Minnesota played well tonight. In fact the Lakers played well tonight. KG was amazing. Sprewell played good. This game meant real close to nothing to the Lakers however. Game 6 means a whole lot to the Lakers. We will find out Monday if the Wolves are really still alive. For now  MIN 98 LAL 96 . The game wasn't nearly as close as the score would tell you. The second half belonged to the Wolves.

       This is a very interesting article. It talks about the Myth that is the LA Lakers. It talks about the fact that both Minnesota (if healthy) and Detroit should be able to beat the Lakers. It is a very long article, but if you take the time to read it, you will be happy you did. Especially if you do not like the Lakers   urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=wiley/040527

         I am going to start with "I wish I could have just woke up tomorrow and found out we lost". That's it we lost. I watched almost the entire game. It was horrible. As a Piston's fan, this may be my least favorite game of my entire life.   Lets start with this fact. Last series it was game 5. This series it's game 4. What am I talking about?  THE GAME WHERE LARRY BROWN WAS TOTALLY OUTCOACHED . Amazingly, Carlisle made adjustments. Larry Brown could not do anything to take advantage of them. Austin Croshere is not that good, however, he totally took us out of what we were doing defensively. Maybe, just maybe, you should have posted the shit out of him on the other end. Croshere can't cover Rasheed in the post. That is my guarantee.  Here's another thing. How about a Piston other than Rip Hamilton do something offensively. Rip has been amazing. There is no doubt in my mind he can lead us offensively to a championship. However, he is far from good enough to do it alone. Billups and Rasheed must hit shots. Another thought, there is this guy on our team named Mehmet Okur. Larry Brown, YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM. I know he makes mistakes, I know sometimes he settles for jumpshots. But, when our team is struggling (for lack of a profane word) offensively, Memo needs to get more than 5 minutes of playing time.  Now to the positive. Congratulations Pacers. Congratulations Rick Carlisle. I am amazed you made adjustments that actually worked. However, Larry Brown is an idiot on occasion. A doghouse is one thing. Singling out a player, and making him the one guy who can make only one mistake a game is horrible. Mehmet Okur will be playing on someone other than the Pistons next year, unless Joe Dumars makes the decision.  IND 83 DET 68     WHO WINS THE SERIES FROM HERE????COMMENT BELOW

K.C. 2   Minnesota 1 --   Michael Cuddyer hit his 5th HR of the year to account for the Twins only run. Tony Graffanino beat out an RBI infield single in the bottom of the ninth in his first game since April 30 to end the game.  B-Jays 5   Rangers 4 --   Delgado went deep the 8th time. Jason Frasor, Toronto's closer of the week, earned his 3rd save of the year.  Boston 8   Seattle 4 --   David Ortiz hit a grand slam to up his MLB leading RBI total to 43.

New York 7   Tampa Bay 5 --   Mariano Rivera picked up career save 300. Damn Yankees.  ChiSox 4   Halos 3 --   Paul Konerko went 3-5 with 3 RBI including the game winner on a single in the bottom of the ninth. Anahiem has lost 4 in a row, all by one run.   National League   Pirates 9   Cubs 5  Game 1 Pirates 5   Cubs 4  Game 2 --   Rob Mackowiak hit a walk-off grand slam to win the first game of this double header. He also hit a game tying jack in the night cap. Craig "I love mullets" Wilson hit a walk off solo shot in the bottom of the 10th inning.  Reds 7   Expos 6 --   Ken Griffey Jr. continued his resugence by hitting his 12th HR of the season. It was his 493rd career jack, tying him for 20th all-time with Lou Gehrig. Danny Graves got his 22nd save of the year.  Phillies 3   Braves 2 --   Tomas Perez tied the game with a double in the 8th and hit a game winning HR in the 10th. Congrats, go buy an H.  Marlins 2   Mets 1 --   Luis Castillo went 3-3, scored a run, and drove in another to lead the fish. Todd Zeile went yard for the Mets only run.

Giants 4   Rockies 2 --   The Giants scored all 4 of their runs in the bottom of the 9th. Barry Bonds hit a 2-run HR to break a 2-2 tie and end the game. I do not understand why they pitched to Bonds when they did not have to.  Padres 5   Brew-Crew 3 --   Brian Lawrence gave up 1 run on 4 hits over 7 innings. He also struck out 10 to improve to 7-3 on the year. Trevor Hoffman picked up save 13 on the year.

        urlLink    Take a look at this C-SUCK. Jim Carrey gone evil and insane....&nbsp;This is the big one. The Pistons need to win this game just as much as the Indiana Pacers do. If the Pistons were to lose they would be down to winning 2 out of 3 with two of those games being played at Conseco.  Rip Hamilton has been amazing . He is the up and coming star of this year's NBA playoffs. I expect him to be just as amazing in this game. If Chauncey Billups can limit his turnovers for the second straight game the Pistons will walk out of the Palace very happy.  The Pacers need to change their rotation . They need less minutes from Reggie Miller. They need more production from Jamaal Tinsley.  Al Harrington needs to play 35+ minutes, he has been the best player for the Pacers in this series .  Carlisle , is the most  stubborn coach  I have ever seen. He almost always refuses to change anything. That being said, he will probably stick with what he has been doing. He does have Jermaine Oneal, so if he can figure a way to put up close to 30 than the Pacers have a chance. Otherwise, the Pacers are going to struggle if the rotation stays the same. My prediction is that Prick Carlisle will make VERY LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS and the Pacers will be going home down 3-1.  Pistons by 6 .

       David Stern has an idea to move the NBDL to around 15 teams. Then, allowing each team to have the rights to a player or two playing in the league so they can get some playing time. Darko Milicic probably could have used this idea this year. I'm not sure though, some coaches would probably rather have the quality practice time with the youngsters. I happen to like the idea, but, I am not sure how the coaches will like it. The NBA's version of the minor leagues would be good for the 1000 High school players that are currently in the NBA draft pool.

       For those of you who may have missed it, in their May 17th issue Sports Illustrated published a list of the 50 highest payed active American athletes. The list was based on the current seasons for team sports and the 2003 calender year for winning-based sports. Here are the top 10.  1. Tiger Woods   $76,673,413 --   Tiger earned $6.673 milliion on the PGA Tour in 2003. His endorsements carried him to the top spot. His deals with Buick, Nike and EASports among others earned him an estimated $70 million dollars in 2003.  2. Shaquille O'Neal   $40,517,858 --   The Lakers big man was payed $26.517 million this year. His endorsements with Nestle, Burger King, and Radio Shaq.... er Shack got him an additional $14 million.  3. LeBron James     $39,018,920 --   LeBron was payed the maximum salary for an NBA rookie($4.018 million). His endorsements($35 million) were second only to Tiger to put him in the number three slot. Nike & Sprite led the way to the bank for LeBron.  4. Peyton Manning     $36,400,000 --   The currnet Manning family leader in chokes also earned the most cash. The Colts payed him $26.9 million dollars to not lead them to the Super Bowl. Gatorade and Nike helped Peyton earn an additional $9.5 million.  5. Kevin Garnett     $36,000,000 --   The current NBA MVP was also the highest payed athlete in terms of salary with a $29 million dollar salary. His endorsements totaled $7 million.  6. Oscar De La Hoya     $32,000,000 --   The highest payed boxer made $30 million for his fighting efforts in 2003. Someone payed him $2 million to pimp something that I do not know about. Probably hair gel or something. Damn pretty boy boxer.  7. Andre Agassi     $27,030,929 --   The highest payed tennis player made $2.53 million for his efforts on the court. He made $24.5 million pimping for Nike, Gatorade and Nikkon among other companies.  8. Kobe Bryant     $25,498,000 --    Kobe was payed $13.498 million to play for the Lakers this year. He earned an additional $12 million to represent McDonald's, Sprite and others.  9. Derek Jeter     $25,000,000 --   $19 million gives him the highest salary on the Yankees. American Exprees and Gatorade gave Jeter $6 to push their products.  10. Grant Hill     $24,279,250 --    CAN YOU SAY OVERPAYED!!!!  I knew you could. The Orlando Magic payed Hill $13,279,250 to play slightly more basketball than me this year. I think Nike payed Hill like $8 million to say he does not wear their shoes. The other $3 million probably came from some company who makes ankle braces or some surgeon or something.

       This is the game that decides whether or not this is a series. If the Lakers win this game, especially if they win easily, this series is over. However, if the Timberwolves can win this game they go from basically being eliminated to being in control of the series. The Timberwolves need Sam Cassell in the 4th quarter. That is a must. They also need better performance from KG. If Garnett can put up 30 plus points they have a chance. If KG can get Malone in foul trouble early, it would pave the way to an easier game for all the Timberwolves. I may be the only one who feels this way, but, if the wolves can get Cassell to be effective in the 4th quarter I can see the Wolves walking out of Staples very content. If Cassell does not play good late minutes, the wolves will be going back to Minnesota down 3-1.

       Tonight the Orlando Magic won the NBA Draft Lottery. This is only the beginning of what could be a huge summer for the Orlando Magic. This summer will include drafting the first pick in the draft, deciding what they should do with Tracy McGrady, and seventeen prayers a day for Grant Hill's health.  This summer could be a mammoth success or a complete disaster. First off, the Magic have to decide whether or not they can keep Tracy McGrady after next season. Then, they decide whether or not they can get a trade worth taking. I don't see the Magic finding any takers for McGrady with anything worth accepting. I could be wrong, but I seriously doubt it.  THE ORLANDO MAGIC HAVE TO BE GOOD IN THE UPCOMING SEASON . That will begin by drafting Okafor with the first pick in the NBA draft. I have given up on the idea of Grant Hill being healthy. That 14 million or so a year is killing the Orlando Magic.   Okafor will help the Magic, but he is far from an answer EVEN IN THE EASTERN CONFERENCE. The Magic were pathetic this past season, their roster had real close to zero talent past Tracy McGrady. My prediction is that the Orlando Magic will not be good next year, and that Tracy McGrady will be the biggest free agent since oh ya this year when Kobe Bryant is a Free Agent.

         The Detroit Pistons got a huge win tonight. Richard Hamilton continued to do what he has done all season for the Pistons. He scored big buckets at big times. Richard Hamilton is yet to be an All-star guard. That should change next year. Richard Hamilton has been scoring against players such as Ron Artest and Jermaine Oneal in this series. If he can keep this up the Pistons have a chance against anybody in the league.   The first quarter of tonight's game showed the Pistons playing aggressive on both ends. They made stops and turned many of them into easy baskets. The second quarter showed a Piston's bench bunch play without any aggression which led to Indiana coming all the way back from a 13 point first quarter deficit.   The second half was controlled by the Detroit Pistons from beginning to end. However, the Pacers even though they appeared to out of the game from time to time would never allow the Pistons to completly bury them. The Pacers made a push late in the 4th quarter but a tip-in by Ben Wallace and a Rasheed Wallace and-1 fade-away sealed the victory.  The Pistons now lead the series 2-  1 . Game 4 is crucial, and there is no better place to be on a Friday Night than at the Palace of Auburn Hills.   DET 85  IND 78

        American League   Royals 7   Tigers 3  -- This game ended on a 6-4-3 double play for the second night in a row. The Tigers left 20 runners on base. That is not a good thing.  Twins 4   D-Rays 2 --   Lew Ford continued to be the MAN. He went 3-3 and scored 2 runs. He also walked two times. Joe Mauer should be back next week. He went 3-4 with Class-A Ft. Myers.  B-Jays 6   Halos 5 --   Troy Percival blew his 4th save of the year. The Angels pulled a  MAJOR  whoopsy by forgetting to cover home plate on the play that tied the game. I do not think that pleased Mike Scoscia very much.  Sawx 9   A's 6 --   Eric Chavez went yard for the 12th time this year, but the Sawx scored 9 runs on 9 hits to get the victory.  Yankees 12   Orioles 9 --   Gary Sheffield went 4-5 with 6 RBI. Mariano Rivera picked up save number 16. A-Rod reached base safely for the 34th straight game. I still hate the Yankees.  Seattle 7   Cleveland 3  --   There were 6 HR's in this game. Raul Ibanez(8), Ichiro(3), Edgar Martinez(4), Casey Blake(5), Victor Martinez(9), and Travis Hafner(7) were the hitters of those long bombs.  ChiSox 4   Tex-ass 0 --   Esteban Loaiza gave up 2 hits over 8 innings to move to 6-3 on the year. Frank Thomas went  DEEP  for the 10th time this year. Miguel Olivo also went yard for the 5th tome on the season.   National League   Atlanta 6  Montreal 1 -- The Braves are not very good, but the Expos  look WAY up  to not very good. Tomorrow night, diddy will throw 8 innings of 3 hit ball against the 'Spos. Furcal showed up in this game by hittin a homer, and stealing a base.   Marlins 3  Reds 0 -- Griffey is still not injured. The Marlins pitching staff is unbelievable, and they soon will be getting back what could be their best pitcher.  Phillies 7  Mets 4 -- I am beginning to believe in these Phillies. No homers and still 7 runs, didn't think they had that in them.  Stros 7  Cubbies 3 -- Cubbies are really missing Sosa. Berkman hit number 12, he may be the hottest hitter in the league right now.  Brew Crew 2  Dodgers 1  -- Dodgers going back to reality. Perez gives up 4 hits in 7 innings and his team loses.  Pirates 11  Cards 8 -- Benson gives up 7 runs in 6 innings for the win. I would imagine Expos pitchers are ready to kill somebody after reading this.  D Ward  had  6RBI   Rockies 13  Padres 6 --Vinny Castilla is amazing (14 HR  43 RBI). Wish I would have drafted him.  Giants 4   Dbacks 3 --Dbacks appeared to win the game in the 7th. Then came their bullpen. Bonds homered and Pedro Feliz won the game with a 2 RBI double in the 8th off Jose Valverde.

       Two days after an enormous win the Pistons have a whole lot of pressure on them to hold home court. The Pistons will need to continue the defensive aggressiveness, as well as keep the Wallaces out of foul trouble. Indiana needs to find a way to shoot better from the field. They cannot win any series shooting around 30 percent. The Pistons could use some offense out of Rasheed Wallace, however, if he is going to continue shutting down Jermaine Oneal his production is just fine. The Palace will be extremely rambunctious tonight, it should be fun to watch. I wish I could be there, but I am stuck on the other side of the country. GO PISTONS. The Pistons will win by around 7-9 points, and will reach that ELUSIVE 80 point mark.

       Breaking news!! Big Papa is not available for tonight's recaps, so with his blessing, I'm going to take tonight's recaps.   K.C. Royals-4 Detroit Tigers - 3  KC won this game on a LONG home run by Ken Harvey off Danny Patterson.  The Tigers thought they tied the game in the top of the 9th, when Alex Sanchez scored on a DP grounder to 2nd that Pudge Rodriguez beat out. The 2nd base ump, however, called automatic DP because of interference on Carlos Guillen, as he didn't slide to break up the throw.   In a   shocking   development, former Tiger, Juan Gonzalez didn't play.    NY Yankees - 11 Baltimore - 3  A-Rod hit his 11th HR of the season as the Yankees send Baltimore to their 5th straight loss.   Bo Sox-12 A's- 2  Manny Ramirez hit his 12th Big Fly,and Mark Bellhorn had a career high 5 RBI game to lead the rout of the athletics. Tim Hudson fell to 1-3 with a 8.53 at Fenway Park, for his career.    M's-5 Indians- 4 12INN   Raul Ibanez's RBI single in the 12th Inning sends Cleveland to their 6th straight loss.   T.B. Devil Rays-6 Twinkies-1   TB wins their 6th straight game as Julio Lugo goes yard, and Victor (I'm the OTHER)Zambrano allows 1 run in seven strong innings pitched.   Justin Morneau hit his 2nd HR in 11 AB's this season after just TEARING UP AAA pitching.  Morneau hit .356 with 10 HR, 29 RBI and slugged .644 in 37 games for the Twins AAA team.   Rangers- 7 Pale Hose - 4  Mark Teixeira and Herbert Perry each hit solo HR's as the Rangers defeat the White Sox 7-4. The Gambler Kenny Rogers wins his 7th game to move into a tie with Roger Clemens, Jarrod Washburn and Paul Wilson for the MLB lead in Wins.    Montreal-San Juan-(DC-Northern VA) Expos- 3 Atlanta- 1  Endy Chavez, Juan Rivera and Tony Batista each homered as the Expos defeat Atlanta 3-1.     Cincy-5 Marlins-2  The Marlins walked NL leading hitter Sean Casey intentionally to pitch to MLB All-Century team member Ken Griffey Jr, and JR made them pay, blasting his 492nd Career Home Run, a 3 run homer, to RF. Paul Wilson won his 7th game of the season tying Roger Clemens and 2 others for the MLB win lead.   NYM- 5 Phillies -0  The Mets got their 2nd shut-out in a row as Steve Traschel battled rain, mud and Philies hitters, none of which stopped him as the Mets win 5-0.  Tom Glavine shut-out the Colorado Rockies yesterday.   Dodgers-5  Beer-Makers- 3  Lima-Time is back in LA, as Jose Lima wins his 3rd game of the year in relief of Kaz Ishii.  Eric Gagne saved his 74th straight game, for the Dodgers   Astros-5 Cubs-0  Roy Oswalt shut out the Cubs, and picks up his first win in a month.  Lance Berkman homered for the 'stros, as they defeat Carlos Zambrano for the first time since August 14, 2002.    Pad's 11 Rockies 6  At least the Rockies pitching staff can blame Coors. Jay Payton had 4 hits for the Padres. The other Luis Gonzalez had 4 hits for the Rockies in a losing effort.   Giants 4 Dbacks 1  Jason Schmidt owns the Diamondbacks. Bonds homered, I had almost forgot he was in the league.    Pirates @ St. Louis  Postponed due to rain

       After 3 straight hits the Daily Pick is up to 314.That is still far from the starting point of 500. But, a couple days ago I had a pick that would have put the balance at ZERO with a loss. 314 doesn't sound that bad.

         This was one of the  best games I have seen in a long time . If you made it through the first quarter you were rewarded in the 3rd and 4th quarters. The  defense  played by the two teams combined was the  best I have ever seen  by two different teams in the same game. The  Pistons blocked 19 shots  and held  Oneal and Artest to a combined 11 of 39 . The referees almost cost the Pistons the game on one of the worst calls in NBA history (Double Dribble that wasn't). The Pacers looked to have the game tied when  Tayshaun Prince came out of no where to have the block of the century  on Reggie Miller. He hurt his elbow cause he hit it on the backboard. Rasheed guaranteed it and it happened. He shot the ball horrible, but he played awesome defense on one of the best players in the league. I will take his shooting every day if he can shut down Oneal like that. The series is now going back to the  Psychotic Palace of Auburn Hills  tied at 1 game a piece. I would work for a month to be at the next two games. This series is going to the Pistons. The Pacers should feel lucky its not 2 games to zero. Maybe the Pistons should too.   Pistons 72 Pacers 67

        American League   B-Jays 6   Halos 5 --   Three Angels homered in a losing effort. The Jays won the game but lost Delgado. Thats not a good trade.   National League   Fish 13   D'Backs 5 --   Steve Finley hit his 14th HR of the year. Brandon Webb got jacked.  Braves 5   X'Pos 0 --   Andrew Jones went yard twice to lead the Braves to victory over the AAA team playing a MLB schedule.  Reds 7   Astros 5  --   Ken Griffey Jr. is batting like its 1999. He got his 10th jack of the year. Danny Graves picked up his 21st save of the year.

        urlLink     urlLink    The Minnesota Timberwolves went into Sunday night's game knowing that this game was a must win. They came out with exactly that. Sam Cassell played 43 seconds of basketball. The odds were stacked against the T-wolves from the tip-off. They really did not care. Kevin Garnett led the way with help from just about all of his teammates. Latrell Sprewell was great, as were players like Darrick Martin and Wally Szczerbiak. The defense led the way. The Lakers looked as if they were fine with losing.  I am personally hoping they lose Game 3  and then realize that they  are human and far from unbeatable.

          Rasheed Wallace was horrible in game one .  He scored 4 points . He allowed Jeff Foster to score a bucket in the final minute of the game. He shot an airball when he could have passed the ball out with ten seconds to go. What does this mean to Rasheed? Obviously, it means he will play better in Game 2. " They will not win Game 2 ." Said Rasheed after the game. He said this over and over.  Well Rasheed if you would have played even an average game ,  The Pacers would not have won Game 1.   Well Sheed, I hope you are right. I thought that the Pistons would win one of two in Indiana.  Now we need to win one of one  or the numbers are heavily stacked against us. Go Pistons in Game 2 or we would have to win 4 of 5 against a team who hasn't lost 4 times in a 5 game span in around 2 years.

       Well this one is quite simple.  The Wolves have to win game 2 . KG has to be an MVP for that to happen. Sprewell will have to hit big shots, and get to the lane, and to the foul line. To be honest with  Sam Cassell very questionable , my money would be on the Lakers.  Kevin Garnett needs 30 points and 18 rebounds . Shaq won't hit 90 percent from the line. Derek Fisher won't hit 4 three pointers. Karl Malone will miss. The Timberwolves will find a way to win. I know I said that my money would be on the Lakers, that is because that makes sense.  The Timberwolves will win tonight ,  don't ask me why .  Timberwolves by 4.

                             This series  WILL BE AMAZING .  The storylines are endless . First, there is the obvious.  Larry Brown vs Rick Carlisle . There will be a lot of people that want Carlisle to win because they think he was unjustly kicked out of Detroit. Those people didn't sit through two seasons with a coach that refused to take Michael Curry out of the starting lineup. A coach that was  FORCED BY JOE DUMARS  to try Tayshaun Prince in the Magic series. A coach that would not listen to ANYBODY. A coach that did not make adjustments at any time. A coach that once let Ricky Davis go off for almost 50 before he sent a single double team at him, and allowed the same with Shareef Abdur-Rahim. All this being said, he has to have an advantage. He coached this team for the past two years and knows the ins and outs of every player on the roster. I appreciate what Carlisle did for the Pistons, but I know as a fan living 45 minutes from Detroit there were many people questioning his decision making during the two years. Most people thought that the 50 wins would get him off the hook. If it weren't for Larry Brown, Carlisle would be coaching the Pistons vs the Pacers anyways. He would just be on the other side.  Then we will move to the fact that  Ben Wallace deserved to 3-peat as Defensive Player of the Year, and that PISSES HIM OFF . Would you want Ben pissed at you? Ron Artest will try to prove that he is the best defensive player in the league. But here's the thing... will he be covering Tayshaun Prince ? Because, if he is,  the best player in the league should not be wasted covering Tayshaun Prince .Ben Wallace will be busy covering the ENTIRE PACER TEAM. That is exactly why he should have been voted Defensive Player of the Year.  Next there is  Jermaine Oneal versus the BIG MEN of the Pistons . The good news for the Pistons is that it's 2 vs 1. The bad news is that ONE killed us the first 3 meetings of the year. Jermaine was the MVP of the Eastern Conference, and could have been the MVP of the entire league. This should be a very intriguing match-up. I feel that Jermaine will get his. But, he must be contained if the Pistons are to win the series.    Reggie Miller vs Rip Hamilton . Maybe this one doesn't sound quite as compelling. But lets look at it this way. Reggie was once in Rip's shoes. He was running through screens trying to tire the whole opponent's roster out while leading his team offensively. He was once the skinny little kid that didn't get the respect he deserved. Reggie once was in Michael's shadow. Rip is emerging. In fact, he has even showed that he is increasing his range. Rip is looking to lead his team to the Finals, just as Reggie did years ago.   Jamaal Tinsley vs Chauncey Billups . This sounds to most as a complete white-wash. But, don't forget that Jamaal Tinsley has been trying to prove himself since the day he got into the NBA. In fact, he had to prove he was more than a street baller ever since he stepped on the floor at Iowa State. Players like this should never be underestimated. The Pistons need to win this match-up. Jamaal has worked on his 3-point shot. Chauncey will need to get out on him. Chauncey will hit a game winner in this series.   Corliss Williamson and the Pistons Bench vs the EXTREMELY TALENTED PACER'S BENCH . At first glance this looks like a complete blowout. But come playoff time the contributions will be more than just point production. The Pistons once had the bench that was considered the best in the NBA. Now that distinction goes to the Pacer's bench mob. Al Harrington is the most talented bench player possibly in league history, and I am being serious. Two years ago Corliss Williamson scored 14 fourth quarter points to lead the Pistons to a win in Indiana. With a couple minutes to go he gave Jermaine Oneal the facial of a lifetime. The next possession he got fouled hard by Oneal and then threw a fastball off of Jermaine's head from about 3 feet. This may be forgotten by most, I doubt it was forgotten by Corliss and Jermaine. Big Nasty will need to score in this series, as will Mehmet Okur. Don't forget about the guys like Mike James, Lindsey Hunter, Anthony Johnson, and Austin Croshere. These guys will have a big impact on who wins this series. The Indiana point guards will have a hard time when James and Hunter are in the game. They pressure the ball better than any other guard duo in the entire NBA.  This series is going to come down to who makes shots and stops when they need to. The Pistons are going to have players like Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups hitting big 3's in the 4th quarter. The Pacers are going to need stops out of players like Jermaine Oneal and Ron Artest. This is going to be a long, hard fought series. This series will be the best series of the playoffs. I don't care if the scores are 75-74. The effort level will be amazing.  FEAR THE FRO .  Ben Wallace will be the difference, Pistons in 6 or 7.

        Kevin Garnett was far from an MVP. Sam Cassell couldn't get off the bench in the 4th quarter due to injuries. Shaquille Oneal was hitting 80 percent from the foul line. Karl Malone couldn't miss.  Derek Fisher  was hitting multiple big shots. What does this sound like to you? Yup, Kobe jigga-shakin', that is the result. The first half seemed to be dominated by the Lakers, however they were only up by 2 points at the half. The third quarter was pretty much even until the final 3 minutes. The game changed on 3 Laker possessions.  Fisher  hit back to back threes, and then my boy Kareem Rush hit another. The result of those three possessions were that the game went from tied to a 9 point Lakers lead. The fourth quarter saw the Timberwolves led by Wally and Spree come about all the way back, but they fell just short.  Derek Fisher  once again hit a 3 that put the game out of reach. But, for the Wolves the scary part was that Sam I Am couldn't even get off the bench due to his back problems. In game 2 Kevin Garnett must score 30 points and lead the Wolves to a victory or their season could end in a VERY BAD WAY.   LAL 97 MIN 88

          VS                     I am going to go far beyond what other analysts are saying in picking the winner of this series. The "other places" basically are saying because the Lakers have Shaq and Minnesota doesn't the Lakers win the series. Well,  KG is  going to be  nasty too . I believe his numbers will surpass the numbers posted by Shaq. I am picking Minnesota to win this series at home in game 7. Home court advantage will be important in this series, but both teams are capable of winning on the road. The key to this series in my mind will be the ability of Cassell and Sprewell to put points on the board. If they can combine for around 40-45 points a night they are going to be very tough to beat. I know the Lakers have Shaq and Kobe, but this year it hasn't gone very far past those two players. It all starts tomorrow night. This series should be great.

         BRING ON THE PACERS.  PISTONS 90 NETS 69 . Personally, I hate the Nets. Like Red Sox fans hate the Yankees. So, in my opinion beating the Nets who swept us last year means that we had a good season. Games 6 and 7 were the most impressed I have been with the Pistons all season. Tonight, almost every Piston played well.  Ben Wallace was hitting jumpshots!  Now to the Pacers. The Pacers were the best team in the NBA in the regular season. They were even 20-8 against the powerful Western Conference. The Nets looked tonight as if the fact that they didn't win game 6 totally beat them up mentally. The Palace was jumping, I wish we had homecourt against Indiana. If Rip and Chauncey play like they did tonight, I dont think a single team in the NBA can beat the Pistons.

        American League   Oaktown 3   D-town 2 --   Tim Hudson moved to 5-1 on the year by giving up one run over 8 innings. The Tigers stranded 12 men on base in their losing effort.  Seattle 11   Baltimore 0 --   Ichiro went 3-5 with 3 RBI and 3 runs scored. Not too shabby. Jamie Moyer picked up the win to move to 2-2 on the season.  ChiSox 10   Twins 3 --   Frank Thomas had 4 hits and was a triple shy of hitting for the cycle. He hit for 3 RBI. Paul Konerko hit 2 bombs to give him 8 on the year.  Spankees 6   Halos 2 --   Mike Mussina moved to 5-4 on the year. Damn Yankees  D-Rays 9   Sawx 6 --   Derek Lowe gave up 7 runs in 2 and 1/3 innings to prove once and for all that he is a mediorce pitcher.   National League   San Fran 5   Cubbies 3 --   These teams went to extra innings for the second consecutive game. Moises Alou hit his 11th HR of the year, but it was Nefi Perez's 1st bomb of the year that was the winner for the Giants.  Brew Crew 3   Xpos 2 --   Danny Kolb picked up save number 10 on the year. The Expos suck. Really bad.  Philly 4   L.A. 0 --   Philly capped a 3 game sweep of the Dodgers with a shutout. Brett Myers went 9 innings and gave up 5 hits to earn the win.  Marlins 6   Astros 3 --   Mike Lowell went yard twice and Armondo Beneitez picked up his 16th save of the year to lead the fish. Lance Berkman hit his 8th HR of the year in a losing effort.  Braves 5   D-Backs 1 --   Arizona only managed 3 hits. Julio Franco (yes  that  Julio Franco) homered in his second straight game to get his third HR of the year.  Cardinals 11   Mets 4 --   The Cardinals scored 6 runs in the ninth inning to put it out of reach. Albert Pujols hit his 10th HR while continuing to avoid the EASports video game injury curse.  Pirates 9   Padres 7 --   I just can't beleive that the Pirates won a game. Brian Giles went yard for the 7th time this year.  Reds 3   Rockies 1 -- Paul Wilson went 8 innings and only gave up 3 hits to move to 6-0. Danny Graves picked up his league leading 18th save. Vinny Cashstealer hit HR number 12 on the year.

I think that game 6 was the game the Nets needed to win if they were going to win this series. However, Jason Kidd is good enough to lead his team to victory almost by himself. I am predicting another good game, where Rip Hamilton will score around 27, and Billups will hit at least one BIG 3 pointer in the 4th. Oh yeah, that Big Ben Weezee guy...

Peja sucks in the Clutch . He is the NBA's Peyton Manning, except Peja isn't as good as Manning even when he is good. If the Kings are to make moves this offseason they should  start  by  moving Peja  Stojakovic.   A couple side notes, I am shocked that Bibby didn't play well in this game. Doug Christie is normally referred to as basically well... a bitch ,  Not tonight . Doug  Christie  was  awesome.   FINAL MIN 83 SAC 80

Then, the Dbacks decided a solo shot wasn't enough to win the game, cause I would have got a push. They hit 2 solo shots in the top of the 11th.   My Daily Picks have a horrible record...

       The Toronto Blue Jays have already had 4 different pitchers get saves for them this season. For the past, I dont know  10 days , the man of the hour was  Terry Adams . Well, lets just say that might not be who it is tomorrow. On a team that  changes closers  at approximately the  same rate I change my boxers  what happened to Adams is plenty enough to warrant a trip back to middle relief. Today the Blue Jays took a  5-2 lead  into the  ninth . Adams then promptly gave up 3 singles and then a  pinch hit GRAND SLAM .  FINAL SCORE MIN 6 TOR 5

         It is time for the MVP to play like he is the MVP. He is amazing. But, if he can't get it done in the playoffs he will  be just another Peyton Manning,  who is good for fantasy owners, and a killer on actual fans of his team when he doesn't get it done when it matters most.   I am expecting a great game that should come down to the final seconds. If I was a T-wolves fan I would be nervous out of my mind. I think Sacramento could come in and steal this one. This game should be  very viewer friendly . I am predicting 32 and 21 for KG. 28 points from Bibby. Peja to miss important shots. Webber to score in the 20s. Sprewell to pump the crowd up, and  Sam Cassell to be the difference in the game . If Sam is on, Minnesota wins. If Sam doesn't hit in the 4th quarter my money is on the Kings.

       The  Miami Heat  had a great season.  Stan Van Gundy  was amazing.  Dwayne Wade  was unbelievable.  Lamar Odom  was a wonderful player and person. DID YOU HEAR EDDIE JONES IN MY ANALYSIS OF THE HEAT'S GREAT SEASON. NO YOU MOST DEFINITELY DID NOT. However,  Eddie Jones  thought it was his job to  simply shoot shot after shot  at the end of the Heat's final game. Maybe you should give the ball to Wade. He is the only reason the game was close. Or maybe you should give the ball to Odom, since he is ten times the offensive player you are. I hope you are happy  Eddie Jones ,  you may have cost your team their season , while looking like a  complete fool  in front of millions of basketball fans.  Eddie Jones  gets the  Peyton Manning What Had Happened Award .

        urlLink    The kid is simply amazing&nbsp; urlLink     Dwayne Wade is unbelievable. The Miami Heat are unbelievable. The East better watch out because this team is on the rise, and bringing Free Agents to  SOUTH BEACH  probably won't be all that difficult. Dwayne Wade is the ONLY rookie worth talking about who is still alive in the playoffs.   I am far from trying to say that Wade should have won the Rookie of the Year. But, there is NO DOUBT in my mind that he has now officially had the best season of any rookie in the entire league. The Heat have been led emotionally by this kid all postseason, and the Heat are on the verge of pushing a 60 win team to game seven. The Heat are the NBA's version of the Calgary Flames, and I am rooting for them as well.

       Huge slate of games so lets get crackin'   American League   Indians 7   ChiSox 2 --   Victor Martinez continued to be an RBI machine. He went 3-5 with 3 RBI. Cliff Lee moved to 5-0 while giving up 2 hits over 5 innings.  Twins 9   B-Jays 5 --   Lew Ford, Torri Hunter and Jacque Jones all HR in the Twins win. Jones' jack broke a 5-5 tie in the ninth inning. Word to yo mama.   National League   Rockies 7   Phillies 6 --   Vinnie Castilla hit a two run homer in the bottom of the ninth to give the Rockies the victory. Credit Tim Worrell with a blown save and a the loss in this one. Hey Larry Bowa, you guys signed Billy Wagner , maybe you should use him. Maybe... just maybe... then again, what do I know?

         I love the fact that somehow, the Detroit Pistons with an injured Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups went into New Jersey and won a game that would have sent the Pistons home for the summer. I was going into the day thinking the worst. I tried to prepare myself throughout the day for the worst. The day the Pistons are eliminated from the NBA Playoffs is the worst day of the year. Well at least for now we are still alive. Thursday Night Blast Off at the Palace.  One more thing, Larry Brown was terrific in this game. He got contributions out of Memo. He benched Tay for quite a while do to a lackluster performance. But, most importantly, he controlled the New Jersey runs with his timeouts. Everytime New Jersey made even a little bit of a push he stopped it with his timeouts.

       Not that I am going to mention any names, but someone I know who plays in a fantasy baseball league, made a really, REALLY dumb trade earlier this season.  Ben Sheets for Carlos Pena.  All I can say is that this guy MUST have had a SERIOUS case of TIGERITIS.    I'm sure that either Diddy, or Big Papa will be on later tonight or early Monday AM with the daily MLB recap.    Here's a preview: Ben Sheets struck out 18, yes 18, Atlanta Braves in Milwaukee's win on Sunday.  Going into that game, Ben Sheets was the 2nd highest scoring P in the previously mentioned fantasy baseball league.  Did I mention 2nd?  As in, just behind that Roger Clemens guy, you know the one that's 41 years old and pitching better than 99.9999% of the OTHER MLB Starting Pitchers, many of whom he's old enough to be their FATHER. THAT Roger Clemens.    Hell, today, Ben Sheets booted Roger Clemens off the LEAD story on Baseball Tonight....THAT Ben Sheets.   Carlos Pena???    In the words of one Infamous Sports Personality. "You Cannot Be Serious"

       I have never had this bad of a feeling about a game. The Pistons are about to start playing the New Jersey Nets in NJ. I have a bad feeling that this game may not even be close. I HOPE TO GOD I AM WRONG. PLEASE GOD LET ME BE WRONG. I hope that everything good that happened this season isn't wrecked in approximately one week. I don't even want to talk about what I think is going to happen. So all I will say is that Ben Wallace is going to be NASTY. FEAR THE 'FRO!!!!   I will add that Roscoe is confident. He says the Pistons will win the series. He may have smoked some rock today while working.

       The first game I am not giving much of a write-up to. It didn't deserve it. The Heat were in the game for approximately 8 minutes. That is real close to all.   Final Indiana 94  Miami 83   The second game had more national interest. I am calling out Duncan and Parker. Where were you two. I watched the game, but I couldn't find either one of you. Parker shot 4-18, and Duncan shot 7-18. Neither performances can happen in games where you MUST win or your SEASON IS OVER. I hope the Pistons players come out with more of a fire than the Spurs did. They should be somewhat embarrassed for winning 2 in a row, and then deciding they were done playing good basketball on both sides of the ball.  Season over.  Enjoy your fishing trip with Kenny Smith.  Final LAL 88   Spurs 76

All three hit HR's; Blalock's 10th, Young's 8th and Soriano's 5th.  Oakland 3   KC 1 --   Eric Chavez hit his 10th jack of the season.

Mariners 13 Spankees 7 --   The Mariners scored 6 runs in the top of the 13th to earn the victory. Sheffield(3), Bernie Williams(3), Matsui(5), and Pay-Rod(8&9) all went yard in a losing effort.  Indians 9   D-Rays 7 --   As I am writing this I am watching Major League 2. Why did they get Omar Epps to replace Wesley Snipes as Willie Mayes Hayes? I'll never know.  Angels 7   Orioles 4 --   Vlad went yard for the 8th time this year. Jarrod Washburn improved to 7-1 for the year while giving up 3 hits over 8 innings.  Twins 4   ChiSox 1 --   Torri Hunter hit two home runs. The first was his 100th career HR. Congrats.

        urlLink    San Antonio tonight, Detroit Tomorrow&nbsp; urlLink     I feel a great one coming on. San Antonio will not call it a season just because D Fish hit a miracle shot. Duncan will score 35+ tonight, that is my guarantee stat of the night. I truly believe this series is going 7 games. Kobe could be the deciding factor. If he drops 40 points the Lakers should win. Shaq may want to think about hitting at least lets say 40 percent of his free throw attempts. My prediction is San Antonio by 3. If the Spurs get behind they should go to " Hack a Shaq " in the 4th quarter. They more than likely will not, but they  SHOULD .

       Well, now I have had time to think about the game for a full day. I truthfully haven't got it out of my head for a single second.  I feel like Aaron Boone just hit a homer .  Chauncey's shot  still was  amazing .   But, now it is time for my complaining. First off, the refs called  83 fouls . I know the game went on FOREVER, but that is way too many foul calls. The game was ended with the end of the benches for both teams. The players on the court for both teams put out an amazing effort.   My next few questions are specifically on Larry Brown's thinkings. I know hindsight is great, but these thoughts were spoken at the time. In Overtime the Nets were without ALL of their big men.  Where the hell were Elden Campbell and Mehmet Okur???  Me, Big Papa, and my friends Jason and Stoney were all talking and asking for Memo to enter the game. They were struggling to cover Corliss, if you would have put two big guys out there they would have never stopped us from scoring.   There were way too many  PHANTOM FOULS  in this game. Kenyon Martin got hosed at least twice.  BEN WALLACE GETS NO RESPECT CONSIDERING HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE LAST 4 DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARDS . Rip Hamilton's last two fouls were pathetic. Tayshaun Prince got called for a foul when Richard Jefferson did nothing more than dive to the ground. The refs didnt decide the game because they were equally horrible to both teams. But, they were far from consistent. Billups got hit on the last two drives to the hole in regulation and got zero whistles.   Now to the important part.  IT WILL TAKE A MIRACLE FROM HERE FOR THE PISTONS TO ADVANCE.  I would put the odds at about 30-1. I can't imagine the Pistons will even stay close tomorrow.  GOD, I HOPE I AM WRONG . What a waste of a wonderful season. Never lived up to the Hype.  I HATE THE NEW JERSEY NETS.    I may add more later, but for now I am done. I hate the fact that we lost that game. When Billups hit that shot the Pistons looked destined to win the game. WRONG.   God, I am so tired of hearing about Carlisle and Carmelo. Well Boys, thanks for making it so  we will not ever hear the end of it .

       Now that its been established that Jessica Simpson, really is     THAT     dumb. Does it mean that we have to look "forward" (???)to 15-20 years of her being dumb in commercials and TV shows?  Yes, she's hot, VERY hot, but her being as dumb as she is, just makes her less and less appealing.  Did Chauncy Billips "call" board on the half-court 3 pointer during Friday night's Pistons-Nets game?   Speaking of Pistons-Nets.  Is it just me, or is Larry Brown being out coached by Lawrence Franks? The same Larry Brown who was coaching in the NBA while Lawrence Franks was a ball boy at Indiana under Bobby Knight?   Is anyone really doubting what a TRUE superstar can do for a baseball team??  If you do, just compare the 2003 Detroit Tigers w/o Pudge Rodriguez to the 2004 Tigers WITH him.  Unlike the past "big name" superstar the Tigers acquired, Pudge has brought credibility and a TEAM attitude that has changed the make-up of the Tigers. I'll be honest, till this season, I've never been a Pudge "fan".  I AM NOW.    What ever happened to the "HOF" career of that other "big name" guy anyway???   Who would have guessed that Rondell White would have played MORE games for the Tigers this season than Pudge?    Who would have guessed that the highest scoring team in MLB would be the Tigers???

       The tools of Ignorance, is a rarely used description of catchers gear, but it holds true for Braves catcher Johnny Estrada.  For those of you who didn't see the Braves-Cardinals game on Thursday, he took foul balls off his Shoulder, finger, foot, thigh and mask.  He never left the game, but he just HAD to be a walking bruise the next day.  OUCH, OUCH and more OUCH.

       This game was unbelievable, but as a Pistons fan I have never had a harder time accepting any loss. We battled all game long. Chauncey hit a half-courter to tie the game. We were dying on the court and still hitting clutch shots. The refs were bad all game, but to both teams. The Nets seemed to hit more shots. FUCK SCALABRINE. I truly believe our season is over. The Nets will be able to come up with energy in Game 6 because they will be at home. BEN WALLACE WILL HAVE TO PLAY THE BEST GAME OF HIS LIFE FOR THE GAME TO EVEN BE CLOSE. A long drive home from the Palace. This one hurts bad.   NJ 127   DET 120

        urlLink    (USAbasketball.com)&nbsp; urlLink     I personally understand the fears of the players. However, I truly hope no more players drop out of the upcoming Athens games. 5 players were added today. Lebron James, Amare Stoudemire, Shawn Marion, Stephon Marbury, and Richard Jefferson were added to complete the 12 man roster. Here is the  current 12 man roster :   Centers---> Tim Duncan and Jermaine O'neal  Power Forwards--> Amare Stoudemire and Karl Malone  Small Forwards--> Lebron James, Richard Jefferson, and Shawn Marion  Two Guards--> Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady  Point Guards--> Jason Kidd, Mike Bibby, and Stephon Marbury  I also read today at ESPN.com that possible replacements are Carmelo Anthony, Ron Artest, Sam Cassell, and Lamar Odom.   First off, I dont think Kidd is going to play. Sam Cassell would be a great substitution. He is a leader and a clutch performer. Ron Artest would also be a great player because he would lead the defense. I am somewhat offended that I haven't heard anything about Ben Wallace. I don't know for sure that he wasn't invited, but he would be perfect for the team.  The team is extremely talented, and even more so athletic. Duncan and O'neal will show us what could have happened if Bird wouldn't have lied to Jermaine in the off-season about Isiah being his coach. If the PHX Suns wouldn't have traded Marbury they would have 25 percent of the Olympic team. I really look forward to destroying the entire World by 50 points per game.

       So its 7:00 and the Pistons game is about to come on. I'm getting  geeked  for game five. All of a sudden the phone rings. Wifey is on the phone from work. We had a big rainstorm here in the FLI today and she got caught outside and wanted me to take her a change of clothes. I'm like, "You do realize that the Pistons game is about to start?" Her reply is legendary, " Who's more important; me or the Pistons? "  So I say nothing and she states, "You are taking way too long to answer." So I get her shit together and take it to her. I go inside and say, " Your lucky it wasn't a game 7. "

       New Jersey @ Detroit    Series tied 2 games aside.  The home team has won every game thus far in the series but that could be in jeopardy tonight. The Pistons have two keys injuries to Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups. Both are expected to play but who know how effective they will be. Look for Rip Hamilton to step up his offesive game and the rest of the Pistons to step up their defensive intensity. Look for a low scoring affair and the Pistons to pull it out.   Sacramento @ Minnesota      Series tied at 2 games aside.  Each team has one win on the road in this clash. Look for the T-Wolves to win a high scoring affair. KG is gonna show why he's the MVP.

Lookin for a very low scoring game that is not going to set any type of record for TV ratings.  A Loss would have me at 417 already, however a W will put me up to  480

       Last year it was Robert Horry putting the game winner as far down as I have ever seen a shot without dropping. This year it was the two most amazing shots of the year seperated by 0.4 seconds. I love Gary Payton, but this is just another reason why I believe a Payton departure would be addition by subtraction. Derek Fisher is a Laker at heart. He plays to win championships, and understands how to get it done.   The first three quarters of this game we're not viewer friendly. The Lakers were dominating by even more than their constant 12-17 pt lead would show. The score was incredibly low. Shaq had very little to do with the game. Then came the fourth quarter Spurs rally, and the finish. The fourth quarter rally was lead by Tony Parker and Tim Duncan. However, the player that stood out in my mind was the emergence of Devin Brown for the Spurs. He seems to be the next Stephen Jackson, who the Spurs could really use right now.   The shot by Kobe was  amazing . The shot by  Duncan  beat that.  Then D Fish blew both of them away . Do you even remember the Kobe shot, if it weren't for Duncan and D Fish that is the shot you would be seeing over and over.  This series is  far from over . The Spurs are amazing, they can win anywhere on the planet. I still believe this series is going to go to  7 games .  LAL 74 SA 73

       I just want to say hey to everyone. I'll chime in on lots of subjects but my main focuses here are going to be hockey, college football(including recruiting), fantasy sports, and all things Detroit.

        urlLink    Tim Duncan: I'm thinking 38 and 17&nbsp; urlLink     Games within the game. Popp versus the Zen Master.  Duncan versus Shaq . Kobe versus Bruce Bowen. Tony Parker versus GP. This series is amazing. Tonight I feel a great game coming on. Duncan is going to have a huge game. However, he will need help. Ginobli, Parker, or some of the other Spurs are going to have to contribute offensively if the Spurs are going to prevail. I have close to no idea what to expect in this series. I'm predicting a  Spurs victory  and a  classic Duncan performance .

        urlLink     AMERICA'S TEAM IS IN.....CALGARY, ALBERTA??? &nbsp; urlLink     How does a team from Canada become America's favorite team. Well, for a couple reasons. First off, they are the UNDERDOG.  America loves an underdog . Also, they beat the NHL's equivalent of the Yankees, the Detroit Red Wings. America's team may be a bit of a stretch, but it's strange that every person I ask who they want to win the Stanley Cup comes back with "I'm rooting for the Flames". Style of play, underdog role, or Jarome Iginla. Whatever the reason,  a team from Canada appears to be America's team.

       Well after 4 games all four series happen to be tied at 2. I feel this makes now a good time for  predictions .  The  Pistons  will win in  7  games with only 1 of the 7 games being close. Game 5 is the key to this series.  The  Pacers  will win in  7  games and game 7 will be a blowout. The Heat will have won 7 home games in the first two rounds and be sent packing. I doubt that has ever happened before.  The  Twolves  will win in  6  games. Yes, this means that they will end the series in Sacramento. Game 5 is going to be a double digit victory for Minnesota.  The  Lakers  will win in  7  games. This series is by far the toughest for me to call. I enjoy the fact that it's now Kobe's team. 40+ in San Antonio in Game 7 is not out of the question

           THREE STRAIGHT WALK-OFF HOMERUN WINS!!!! First, it was Eric Munson. Then, it was Carlos Pena. Tonight, it was Dmitri in the 11th. I know there will be people out there who say that I am getting way too excited about a team that is still under the .500 mark. Here's the thing. The Tigers give the fans (like me, Big Papa, and the DH)  a little bit of hope . We are only 5 games out of first place in the AL Central. Yes, I know that the Tigers have glaring weaknesses. But, we also have glaring strengths. We have a wonderful team filled with players that play the game as a team. This team reminds me of the Pistons a few years ago. Please, please, Mike Illitch keep this team together and add around them. I don't care what anybody says, with the turnaround of the Tigers; Pudge Rodriguez and his .374 BA is the first half AL MVP.

          OR     The Nets are being forced with a major decision. If they are not able to throw Scary Skittles (Kittles)  on somebody then they may have to choose between Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin. It is very unlikely they will be able to keep Kittles, Kenyon, and Kidd. At least one of these will be forced to leave. The Nets, of course, hope that they can have someone take Kittles  and his ten million dollar  salary. That probably will not happen.   Personally, I hate the Nets. I hope they blow this franchise up with their upcoming decisions. I am glad I am not the one making these decisions. Who would you keep? The wonderfully athletic and younger KMART or the best PG in basketball since Magic Johnson??  Comment Below!!!!

       Last week the Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship. If it was not for that, the Devil Rays would have been team of the week last week. Luckily, since I was feeling guilty about not mentioning the Drays at all last week, they continued to play well. This week the Devil Rays, yes, THOSE Devil Rays tied a New York Yankee record for consecutive Interleague wins. The Drays have a lower payroll as a team than a handful of players in the MLB have single handedly. Well done Tampa. I didn't think you had it in you. I wish the Tigers could win ten plus games in a row. Good job Lou.

         I live in Tucson AZ. That being said, I get to see real close to zero Tiger's baseball games. This weekend I was lucky enough to catch two great Tiger's games due to the fact that they had a series against the Dbacks. Yesterday, the Tigers were losing 5-2 the first time I caught the score. They then decided to tie the game immediately, and then in the following inning give up a run to the Dbacks. Omar Infante hit a game tying homer, and in the ninth inning Eric Munson hit the longest HR in Comerica park history to win the game walk off style.  On Sunday, the Tigers were tied 5-5 in the ninth with 2 outs. Then, Carlos Pena decided he would hit a walk off Grand Slam. I hope that this did a whole bunch for the confidence of the team.  I also wish that the owner of the team had even a smidge of love for the Tigers. We are only about 5 games out of first place in the winnable AL Central divison. But, instead of going out and getting someone to help us possibly win the division we will most likely trade away players to help someone else possibly make a run at the playoffs.  GO TIGERS!!!!!  lets win some games against Cleveland and pass them in the standings.

       This was an interesting draft. Sort of. It was hard to judge because of the high schoolers and foreign players. Here are my Winners and Losers:  The Winners:  Chicago Bulls : Scott Skiles has more talent than almost all of the Eastern Conference, he will have to prove how bad he sucks for this team to not make the playoffs. Gordon, Deng, and Duhon. GREAT NIGHT A+++   Orlando Magic : Some people don't like the pick of Howard. I love it. I do not think Tmac will be on the team next year...Howard has Tmac potential. To acquire Jameer Nelson at low value is a great pickup. Good Job A   Utah Jazz : Had three first round picks and got good size and athleticism. Humphries, Snyder, and Podkolzine. Podkolzine at 21 could end up being the pick of the draft. Good Job A-  The Losers:  Miami Heat : Alston is a free agent, ur big men were non existent, or didn't exist period..whichever way you want to call it...J Nelson and Podkolzine on the board...you take Dorrell Wright SF...good job. NOT SO MUCH   Los Angeles Clippers : You want a PG, that is pretty obvious. You take Livingston, well he's a PG. My guess is he will struggle big time. Devin Harris would have been a much better selection.   Phoenix Suns : Not sure what they are trying to do. Well they want Kobe. I don't see that happening. Adding maybe Nash, and maybe Okur. Not my idea of improving right away. But, if they get Kobe I take this off the list of losers. Otherwise, they are making some big mistakes in my opinion.

       Antawn Jamison will score 25 points per game next season. Don Nelson likes to score points, but, he was not smart enough to give Jamison his minutes. Jamison averaged 14 ppg on 54 percent shooting. Good Job Nellie, maybe if you get Shaq you can make it out the first round. Of course, if the Mavs were smart you would not be coaching next season. The trade:  Wiz get: Antawn Jamison  Mavs get:Jerry Stackhouse, #5 pick in the draft, and some white guy who should have starred in the passion of christ  In other news, the Suns still think they can get Kobe, and do not believe they can get T-Mac....so they sent their 7th pick to Chicago for a future first rounder and this years second round pick.

       The Bobcats had their expansion draft tonight. They selected zero veterans. They selected a lot of players who are now unrestricted free agents. The core of their team will be Gerald Wallace, Jahidi White, Jason Kapono, and whomever they take with the second pick they have in thursday's NBA draft. Their combined roster probably averages around 3 points a game, and barely make NBA squads. They will be horrible for the next two seasons. However, in two seasons they will have a GIGANTIC amount of salary cap space. Well, basically the Bobcats will have the best chance in the lottery for the next two seasons.  Good luck getting to twenty wins in either year. I don't see it being even close to possible.

       The Houston Rockets have reportedly acquired Tracy McGrady. The so called franchise Steve Francis is part of the deal. Juwan Howard will join T-Mac in Houston. Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato will join Francis in Orlando. Or will they? Steve Francis is immediately going to ask for a trade out of Orlando. Early word is that he may be sent to Chicago. Kirk Hienrich and Tyson Chandler would be the big names in that deal. This is a crazy day in the NBA. Wednesday will be active with the expansion draft. The actual NBA draft is on Thursday. The Rockets have 2 potential superstars, but have dealt 60 percent of their starters. We will find out how this will work out next season. Both the Rockets and Magic have lots of holes still.

         This will be a new Sunday feature at Diddy's Guys Night Out. Every week the crew will name the team that they feel most deserves to be named Team of the Week.  This week's selection is an easy one.  The Detroit Pistons . They shut up loud mouths across the nation, and turned up the volume on the loud mouths in Michigan.   I personally want to thank the entire Detroit Pistons organization. After Grant Hill, the outlook was far from promising. But, from the day we left the teal jerseys and went to Red, White, and Blue the Pistons were back to being a force to be reckoned with. The Pistons changed the attitude of an entire State. The state of Michigan is still smiling.  I live and work in Tucson, Arizona. At work all week my boss has told me about how much he enjoyed watching the Pistons in the Finals. He admitted that he didn't watch Eastern Conference basketball, and that he thought that the Lakers may sweep the Pistons. He told me that the way the entire team put effort into every play was amazing to him.   Thank You Ben Wallace. Thank You Joe Dumars. Thank You Chauncey Billups. Thank You Tayshaun Prince. Thank You Everybody.   One more thing, this was far from a fluke.  WE WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR TO PROVE IT. BACK TO BACK IN '05

       Now that the Detroit Pistons have won the Larry O'Brien Trophy its time to look forward a bit to the NBA Draft. This is gonna be another Diddy/BigPapa collaboration.  1.      Orlando Magig     Team Needs: ummmm..... they have T-Mac and nothing   BigPapa:  I feel that Orlando is gonna go for the player who can make the quickest impact----> Emeka Okafor, 6-10 PF UConn.  Now I do not like this pick at all. Okafor is alot like Drew Gooden, worse on offense but better on the defensive side of the court.   Diddy:  Okafor  is the way that the Magic will go. It is the best option. They need a defensive identity. Here is my predicted Starting Five for Orlando this season. Okafor, Howard, Marion,  Joe Johnson, and a rookie PG.  2.      L.A. Clippers     Team Needs: PG,C, General Manager, Owner   BigPapa:  This pick could be the object of desire for a few teams(Atlanta is the team most rumored to move up). The best player on most boards at this point is prep star Dwight Howard but he projects as a PF. The Clippers have this Elton Brand guy who plays there so if they stay look for them to go with----> Shaun Livingston, 6-7 PG Peoria Central HS.  Livingston has crazy handles but needs to do some bulking up. Then again so does Tayshaun Prince, so what do I really know.   Diddy:  Trade down, Trade down, Trade down, Trade down . Understood.  Atl anta takes  Howard  here.  3.    Chicago Bulls     Team Needs: SF, all-around depth   BigPapa:  The Bulls are young and athletic. They need a young, athletc SF. There are two in this draft; Loul Deng and Andre Igoudala. Look for 'Da Bulls to go with the moe polished of the two---->  Loul Deng, 6-8 SF Duke.    Diddy: I say they should also trade down to someone interested in Deng, and then pick Igoudala or Luke Jackson...but, the Bulls are ignorent so they will not.  Deng , it is.  4.    Charlotte Bobcats     EXPANSION FRANCHISE   BigPapa:  Charlotte can take the player with upside since there is not any pressure to win yet.----> Dwight Howard, 6-10 PF SW Atlanta Christian HS.  Crazy athletic talent in the Amare Stoudamire mold.   Diddy: They should take Ben Gordon...They won't,  Shaun Livingston  goes here. Not a bad pick, but very very risky. Ben Gordon will score 20 PPG in the league, and is my pick to win Rookie of the Year.  5.    Washington Wizards     Team Needs: C, PF, SF   BigPapa:  Ahh... Its time for the Wiz to pick. Who's the best available Maryland Terripen? There are none so they'll go with a Wildcat instead---->  Andre Iguodala, 6-7 SF Arizona.    Diddy: The Wizards are pathetic, I think they will go with size here... Pavel Podkolzine . He's 7'4 300+ so they at least have an excuse if he is horrible.  6.    Atlanta Hawks     Team Needs: ummm... everything including fans   BigPapa:   Ben Gordon, 6-2 PG UConn.    Diddy:   They will trade withe the Clippers, and if the Clippers want to win they will select  Ben Gordon   7.    Phoenix Suns     Team Needs: PG, SG, C   BigPapa:   Devin Harris, 6-3 PG Wisconsin    Diddy:   An interesting offseason for the Suns begins with the draft. Will they get Kobe? Will they acquire Tmac?  Devin Harris  would be a great pick for the Suns, if Ben Gordon is available he would be even better. The Suns 1-2-3-4 would be Gordon, Johnson, Marion, and Stoudemire...talk about young athletic and exciting...maybe they dont need Tmac...ya they do, never mind  8.    Toronto Raptors     Team Needs: C, SG, PG, New knees for VC   BigPapa:   Andris Biedrins, 6-11 PF/C BK Skonto Riga.  The first foriegner off the board is most often compared to Chris Bosh.   Diddy:  Toronto makes many, many, many mistakes...here is another one... Josh Childress   9.    Philadelphia 76'ers     Team Needs: someboody, anybody who can put the ball in the basket   BigPapa:   Josh Childress, 6-7 SF Stanford.    Diddy:  With luck  Andre Igoudala  drops to the sixers. This would be perfect for Allen Iverson. He then would have someone who could be healthy and athletic besides him...oh wait iverson isn't healthy...can u draft a coach that is as good as Larry Brown ????  10.    Cleveland Cavaliers      Team Needs: SF & another year of experiance   BigPapa:   Luke Jackson, 6-7 SF Oregon.  The senior from Oregon is less talented than prep star Josh Smith but he knows his game.   Diddy:  I'm saying they go with  Josh Smith .It worked last year with Lebron. Carmelo played at the same high school. He may have the most upside in the entire draft. He went to Oak Hill. So basically played at a Division One school in High School.  11.    Golden State Warriors      Team Needs: PF, PG, & a new GM   BigPapa:   Jameer Nelson, 6-0 PG St. Joe's University.    Diddy:  I have no clue what the morons at the top of GS are thinking. I am going with the fact that they take the best available. At this point that is  Andris Biedrins   12.    Seattle SuperSonics      Team Needs: C, general depth   BigPapa:   Pavel Podkolzine, 7-5 C Metis Varese.    Diddy:   They as do most teams in the upper half of the draft need a big man. In my draft Podkolzine has already been selected. They take  Robert Swift , well because he's huge.  13.    Portland Trail Blazers      Team Needs: SG, SF   BigPapa:   Josh Smith, 6-8 SF Oak Hill Academy.  Many experts call him Vince Carter with heart.   Diddy:  Their dream comes true. A white boy, with a good image from the state of Oregon falls into their laps.  Luke Jackson , also he is Luke Walton with athleticism and a better jumpshot...if they are lucky..otherwise they should draft the guy with the most potential of getting 15-life.  14.    Utah Jazz      Team Needs: C, SG, PG   BigPapa:   Kirk Snyder, 6-7 SG Nevada.    Diddy:  Jerry Sloan loves his PGs, I dont think I do, but I agree with papa..they will take  Snyder   15.    Boston Celtics      Team Needs: PG, SF, PF, C, GM   BigPapa:   Rafael Araujo, 6-11 C BYU.  This is a hard prediction to make due to the unknown psychcological exams that Danny Ainge subjects players to.   Diddy:  Danny Ainge needs this draft to go real well. If he gets  Jameer Nelson , it will be a great start.  16.    Utah Jazz  (from New York via Phoenix)     Team Needs: C, PG   BigPapa:   Robert Swift, 7-0 C Bakersfield HS.    Diddy:  Utah loves foreigners... Sergey Monya SG   17.    Atlanta Hawks  (from Milaukee, via Denver & Detroit)     Team Needs: SG, SF, PF, C   BigPapa:   Sergey Monya, 6-7 SG/SF CSKA Moscow.    Diddy:  We get Rasheed, they get this pick...HEHEHEHE...anyways they select the most talent not at PF.... JR Smith ...raw athleticism, which could breed excitement, which could bring 12 whole fans to the arena  18.    New Orleans Hornets      Team Needs: Team doctor for Mashburn and Baron Davis   BigPapa:   JR Smith, 6-7 SG St. Benedict's Prep    Diddy:   They are now in the Western Conference, not a good thing. They select for depth behind the big men... Rafael Araujo   19.    Miami Heat      Team Needs: C, frontcourt depth   BigPapa:   Peter Ramos, 7-3 C Criollos de Caguas    Diddy:  They need size.  Ramos  fits the mold. They would love to trade up for Okafor, probably not possible though.  20.    Denver Nuggets      Team Needs: SG, C   BigPapa:   Sasha Vujacic, 6-7 PG Snaidero Udine    Diddy:  I have some excitement brewing... Sebastian Telfair  on the break with Melo  21.    Utah Jazz  (from Phoenix)     Team Needs: PG   BigPapa:   Sebastian Telfair, 6-0 PG Lincoln HS    Diddy:  Telfair's worst nightmare would be Jerry Sloan.  Kris Humphries  would be the best pick here for the Jazz.  22.    New Jersey Nets      Team Needs: C, moving truck company   BigPapa:   Ha Seung-Jin, 7-3 C Yonsei University. (South Korea)    Diddy:  The Nets may lose Kenyon Martin. So they need long athletic bodies. Otherwise, not Rodney Rogers starting at PF.  Al Jefferson  is the closest thing to KMart available at this point of the draft.  23.    Portland Trail Blazers  (from Memphis)     Team Needs: SG, SF, C   BigPapa:   Kris Humphries, 6-9 PF Minnesota.  Best available player.   Diddy:   Sasha Vujacic , he seems to fit the type of player that could help the Blazers pathetic offense.  24.    Boston Celtics  (from Dallas)     Team Needs: PG, SF, PF   BigPapa:   Anderson Varejao, 6-11 PF FC Barcelona.    Diddy:   Anderson Varejao  was considered a lottery pick last year, he has upside...Ainge needs to make this pick.  25.    Boston Celtics  (from Detroit)     Team Needs: PG, SF   BigPapa:   Dorell Wright, 6-7 SG/SF South Kent Prep, L.A.    Diddy:  > Ha Seung Jin ...the Eastern Conference teams at the top have size...7-3 would help.  26.    Sacramento Kings      Team Needs: depth and the ability to play defense   BigPapa:   Al Jefferson, 6-9 PF Prentiss HS (Mississippi).    Diddy:   Viktor Khryapa SF ...He fits the Sacramento mold...unless he is going to stay healthy. If he is going to be healthy in the playoffs, he should go elsewhere.  27.    Los Angeles Lakers      Team Needs: Lots of ??????????????   BigPapa:  I have no clue who is going to be back. I'm thinking Kobe, Karl, and the Glove are gone. That leaves a starting line-up of Shaq, Wakton, George, Rush and Fisher. YUCK.  Delonte West, 6-3 PG/SG St Joe's University.    Diddy: I agree about the question marks. I say the biggest will be PG. I am going to shoot down the board. But,  Duho n makes sense to me.   28.    San Antonio Spurs      Team Needs: May lose Ginobli   BigPapa:   Viktor Khryapa, 6-9 SF CKSA Moscow.    Diddy:    Dorell Wright  may be able to give them what Stephen Jackson gave the Hawks last year. What the hell was Jackson thinking. Oh never mind, its Atlanta...boobies  29.    Minnesota Timberwolves   Minnesota forfeits 2004 first round pick due to the Joe Smith scandal.  30.    Indiana Pacers      Team Needs: Backcourt depth   BigPapa:   Kevin Martin, 6-7 SG Western Carolina University.    Diddy:  This is another spot where I would take Duhon if available.  Delonte West  also would be a stellar selection. West it is. Andre Emmett would be a wise selection as well.

       Sorry for the lack of new content. The last thing I remember is the end of Game Five. Everything since then is an alcohol induced haze.  We have some big things coming up soon. One is a double NBA Mock Draft. Diddy and I will each pick for every team. We should have a Year-to-Date Detroit Tigers Report before too long. There should also be a minor league baseball report for those of you who are in keeper leagues.   Our Daily Pic and nightly MLB re-cap should be back on track starting Sunday.  Thanks for reading and help spread the word. Don't forget to leave your comments.

       Hi all,   Congrats to the Pistons for, like EVERYONE is now saying.  "Shocking the world" .    Props out to Diddy and BigPapa.  They called the NBA finals correctly on here.   While all the other critics and commentators are all saying NOW that the Pistons had a chance, my two friends here called it before the series started.  Al Michaels during the pre-game of Game 1, said that he had talked to "experts" all over the country, and even in (ahem) Vegas.  Nobody that he had talked to had the Pistons winning.    Al, next time dial area code (810).   I HOPED the Pistons would win it, and I sure wanted them to ..but I'll admit.  My pick going in, was LA in 5.    OOPS  Well I had the NUMBER of games correct.   Guys, props to ya for puttin it out there.  I wish I had listened.  Ain't no Party like a DEEEEtroit party, 'cause a Detroit party don't stop.

        This is the best thing I can remember in my lifetime. With all the negative talk about the Pistons this year, and the talk about the unbeatable Lakers, I wanted this more than any other title EVER. This is amazing.   This team was amazing. From day one of preseason I have loved to watch every game they played. This team has hustled almost every minute of every game. They are the ultimate team in the ultimate team game. The Detroit Pistons have made a very happy man of me.   Tonight's game: Chauncey Billups was picture perfect. Rip played his game. Tayshaun did his thing from time to time. Rasheed was good. Memo hit shots. Even Elden Campbell made plays. The best game I have seen in a long time was played by Ben Wallace. He was everywhere. The game was completely decided in the third quarter. In that quarter Ben Wallace had over ten rebounds. Congratulations, Joe, Larry and the rest of the Piston Organization.  I hope this team stays as close to the exact same as it can. This team is amazing, and I don't see us getting beat anytime soon. We play great defense and at the same time are very efficient offensively. This team is a great team to root for, they are the NBA's New England Patriots (another team I love to root for).---Diddy     BIGPAPA CHIMES IN   This year has been amazing for Pistons fans. From the firing of Prick... errr Rick Carlile and hiring of Larry Brown, to the much criticized drafting of Darko Milicic, the Pistons have over come it all. Champions again. Finally.  Congrats to Ben Wallace, Joe Dumars, Chauncey Billups, Rip Hamilton and the rest of the Pistons organization.  AIN'T NO PARTY LIKE A DETROOIT PARTY 'CAUSE A DETROIT PARTY DON'T STOP!!!!

        Let me help everyone out on this one. The Pistons are the better team. In fact it is not even close. They are coached better, they have more depth, and they are more athletic at four out of the five positions on the floor.  The Pistons realize that they are on the verge of sending Detroit into a serious frenzy. I would empty my bank account just to be in Detroit for the next week. It doesn't get any better than the party that is about to go down in the D, and in the surrounding areas. The Pistons have been sick and they deserve credit.  This game is going to be awesome. Rip is going to be raining jumpshots. Chauncey is going to be hitting threes and driving to the lane. I expect a massive game out of Ben Wallace. The Pistons win this game by around 10.  GO PISTONS...send these little bitches back to LA by themselves. The Lakers franchise is about to be sent into a frenzy.

        This one is simple. The Pistons are a better team than the Lakers. In fact, they are the best team in the NBA. They are one win from proving this to every one that doubted them.   In this game, the Lakers got a Shaq game like the games from Shaq's prime. Shaq was unstoppable. Larry Brown is a genius. In fact, he went with Diddy's strategy from day one. You let Shaq do his thing, and make everyone else hit tough shots.   For the Pistons it was a team effort. Chauncey was awesome. Rip made big shots in the fourth quarter. Ben Wallace did everything he always does. Rasheed took the game over at times. Tayshaun played great defense on Kobe.  The Lakers team as we know it is about to change. One more game with Phil, Kobe, Karl, and Gary. I don't see any of these people being on the team next year. There is a chance that Karl and Gary could come back. But, I don't see it happening. Phil and Kobe, I see relatively no chance in those two being on the Lakers next season.   DET 88 LAL 80   P.S. Thanks Slava...your Fuck up was the end of the series, and I am serious

        So Lakers, how's life treating ya?? Just wondering. The number one Laker is now calling out half the team. The Lakers are worrying more about themselves than the Pistons. I cannot wait until next year when Karl, Gary, and Kobe all go elsewhere. It will be wonderful. It will also be fun to watch Shaq go crazy. I wonder who will coach, cause it will not be Phil.  Now to Game 4. Let's just say the Lakers lose this game, and they lose the series. In my mind, it's that simple. It's also this simple. The Lakers will not win tonight's game. The Pistons are a far better TEAM. Key word is team. The Lakers have 4 Hall of Famers. I am not sure the Pistons have 1. Ben Wallace may have a chance if he wins like 6+ Defensive Player of the Year Awards and some titles. But, I don't see any other Hall of Famers. But, that is far from important (except to the national media). The important fact is the team concept that has been applied to the Pistons for the past 3 years.   The Lakers need to run pick and rolls for Payton. I have said this since game one. They need to make Chauncey work on defense. They probably won't though. This series is hilarious for me to watch. The Lakers have 1 player playing above his normal level. ONE!! Luke Walton. I doubt that will continue, but even if it does, the Pistons will win the series. I love this series, it's fucking hilarious to watch Malone get blocked every time he goes inside. I also love the fact that everytime the Lakers lose Phil Jackson goes to the referees and complains. Is it just me or is this absolute irony.   The Pistons will win this game. Shaq will score more points. He will go to the line more often. Hamilton will once again score points. Pound-for-Pound (Larry Brown) will once again out coach the WEIRD ASS named Phil.  GO PISTONS

       For those of you who did not see or hear what happened the other night. Karl couldn't deal with a heckling fan.  Amazingly, this probably wasn't the first heckling fan in Malone's 56 year NBA career . Malone this time went insane. He basically poked or hit the fan in his face. Amazing, Malone even went where I didn't even think that he could possibly go.  I love this. This is unbelievable. Malone has now done  WAY MORE DAMAGE TO DETROIT FANS THAN TO THE DETROIT PISTONS.   I HAVE WENT FROM HATING KARL MALONE TO LOVING THE FACT THAT HE JUST PLAIN SUCKS. EVERY TIME HE GOES INSIDE HE GETS BLOCKED. MALONE IS HORRIBLE. GOD, THIS IS LIKE A DREAM OF MINE.  DON'T WORRY MALONE YOUR DAUGHTER WILL GET PLENTY OF RINGS IN DETROIT . MAYBE SHE WILL SHARE ONE OF HER WNBA RINGS WITH YOU. IT WILL LOOK GOOD ON YOUR FAT ASS FINGERS.

       OK, so 2 days ago, Diddy goes off on the Pistons best player. I went a lil' crazy on him in fact. But, here's the thing. Up to that point Richard Hamilton had been about effective in this series as MarshMelo Anthony has been. If he would have been even average in those two games the Pistons would have been up 2-0 and by a large margin in both games. Instead Rip decided he was gonna worry about trying way too hard to outduel Kobe.  Then came Game 3. Rip shows up, and just as Diddy had said the Pistons roll. If Rip shows up the Pistons will not lose. We won by twenty. Rip shows up in this series and the Lakers cannot win the series. It's that simple. If he decided to go back to the ways of Game 1 and 2, then the Pistons could eventually lose this series.  Way to go Rip, you stepped up to the plate. Thank You.  DET 88  LAL 68

       RIP, guess what? Kobe Bryant is a better basketball player  GET THE FUCK OVER IT .  PLAY BASKETBALL . He was better than you when you were 15, he is better than you now. You are really, really good. You are not Kobe Bryant. Nor will you ever be.  GET THE FUCK OVER IT .  PLAY BASKETBALL .  MAKE A JUMPSHOT . When Kobe hit the game winner in high school against you, he was better than you.  GET THE FUCK OVER IT .  PLAY BASKETBALL .  MAKE A JUMPSHOT . When Kobe hit the game winner against you in Game 2 he was better than you .  GET THE FUCK OVER IT .  PLAY BASKETBALL .  MAKE A JUMPSHOT . Kobe will always be better than Rip Hamilton. But, if RIP begins to play basketball he can say HIS TEAM IS BETTER THAN KOBES CAUSE THE PISTONS WILL WIN THE SERIES.   RIP,  GET THE FUCK OVER IT .  PLAY BASKETBALL .  MAKE A JUMPSHOT . If you decide that Kobe is better than you, but you're still really good, and can score too.  THE PISTONS WILL WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP . If RIP stays M.I.A. than the Pistons will be R.I.P.

         Call me crazy, but this had to be the worst thing in the world for the NHL. Tampa Bay won the Cup. Are you kidding me?? I could care less who they have, or what style of hockey they play. I actually watched the entire game 6 and game 7. It was OK. The third period of Game 7 was great. But, the truth is if it were Detroit/Philly it would have been way more intriguing. How many senior citizens in Tampa even know they have a hockey team, or for that matter care. The truth of the matter is the NHL is in trouble. I personally hope the league sticks around. But, at the same time I do feel that it is hard to root for players that it takes half a season to learn how to pronounce their names correctly. I live in Arizona, and people out here really could care less about the Coyotes. I have a feeling that the Lightning fans are pretty close. Bandwagon, that is all I have to say.  Congratulations Lightning, Good Luck NHL. I was rootin' for a canadian team, led by a guy I have no idea how to spell his name, and have no clue where he is from. It is just strange. I like the fact that in the NBA/NFL players are from Philly, LA, Detroit, Houston, St. Louis...NOT somewhere on the other side of the Earth.

       Everybody talks about the Lakers and whether they show up. The Pistons need to show up in Game 2. We cannot be happy with winning one game in LA. There are 6 games left in the series, and the Pistons have to win 3 of them. I don't care where they are being played. The Lakers are the opponents. The Pistons cannot give a single game away. The Pistons have gave games away in each of their first 3 series. I am praying that that is not the case in Game 2. Now on to the strategy.  I have heard way too much about how the Lakers played horrible, and the Pistons played their best. First off, that was far from the Pistons best. Hamilton played bad on the offensive end. Ben Wallace looked nervous almost every time he touched the ball. In the first half the Pistons had at least 5 balls go straight through both hands, missed a ton of FTs and lay-ups. So try another one, its not going to work with me.  Another thing, people talk about Shaq not getting enough touches. He shot 16 FG attempts, and 12 FT attempts. I am not sure how many shots you want Shaq to take?? Go ahead have Shaq shoot 30 FG attempts, and you thought your role players were bad in game 1. If Shaq shoots 30 FGs he will be dead at the end of the game, his shooting percentage will go down, and his teammates will be statues on both ends. The role players have to be more involved in the offense. If Payton gets more shots his defense will improve. Their is not any science behind this, but it's the truth. If the Lakers are to win this series (which they won't) they need production out of Payton, Malone, and Fisher. Shaq and Kobe are tremendous. They cannot beat the Pistons by themselves.  Here is the Laker's biggest strategic dilemma. Who can stop Chauncey? Kobe probably can. However, can you afford to have someone else cover Rip Hamilton. I do not think so. It is a pick your poison type deal. Kobe was undoubtedly fatigued in the fourth quarter of game one. He settled for jumpshots. Players do this when they get tired. Rip Hamilton is a hard cover. He does not get tired, it is amazing. Ben Wallace and Hamilton never fatigue. It is amazing.   The Pistons should not change a thing. Keep covering Shaq almost exclusively one on one. Yes, he will score 30 points a game. I don't care. He won't shoot 80 percent every game, or shoot almost 70 percent from the FT line. Keep covering Kobe with Tayshaun. Here is the key: LOCK DOWN EVERYBODY ON THE LAKERS NOT WEARING A JERSEY WITH EITHER 34 OR 8 ON THE BACK. THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT THE PISTONS DEFENSE IF WE COVER THEM CORRECTLY.   One more thing, Chauncey and Rasheed MUST stay out of foul trouble, especially in the second half.

       I know that you read this, and you say "NO SHIT." Then why did you pick the Lakers to beat the Pistons. Im not guaranteeing a Pistons championship by any means. But, I think it's funny that the same people that say "NO SHIT" also picked the Lakers to win the series. "Did you do this because of the Laker's Defense being better than Detroit's???? Let's hope not. If Defense really wins championships, I will be a very happy Detroit Pistons fan in about 10 days.

       The Pistons won game 1. Well there goes everyone who bet the Lakers to sweep. Good bet folks. For everyone who said that the Indiana/Detroit series was "BAD OFFENSE" good call. Maybe, just maybe, it was good defense. There's a chance.  Darko is now 3 wins away from having more rings than Karl Malone.  HAHAHAHAHA.  The Pistons did exactly what I wanted them too. You allow Shaq and Kobe to do their thing. You put the pressure on the other Lakers. The key to the Lakers is what everyone else does. The Pistons made on my count 4 bad defensive decisions in the entire game. 2 bad attempts at steals by Ben Wallace. 1 bad double team that left Payton wide open for three. 1 possession where nobody picked up Devean George. The Lakers players outside of Shaq, and Kobe are no where near good enough to beat the Pistons defense.  Malone was Awesome. WAY TO GO AFTER THAT RING MR. BALCO. YOU PLAYED LIKE YOU WERE WEARING THE CEMENT BOOTS I TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY. GOOD JOB.  The Pistons are now leading 1-0. They have a sick amount of confidence. Rip Hamilton couldn't make a shot. They won by 12.  DET 87 LA 75

       1.Ben and Rasheed are not scared of Shaquille Oneal, the hack-a-shaq will not be needed.  2.The Pistons will make it harder for the Lakers to get into their offense, which means less time to execute their offense and harder shots at the end of the shot clock.  3.Rip is going to run, and run, and run. Everybody knows the Lakers don't like playing 48 minutes of defense  4.Ben,Rasheed, and Memo will make Shaq run from end to end. He will tire, and make bad fouls.  5.In at least 3 games in this series Shaq will be in foul trouble.  6.Ben Wallace will get the Pistons extra possessions with his offensive rebounds.  7.Chauncey Billups will dominate the Lakers Point Guards.  8.The Pistons defend entry passes better than any team in the NBA. Which means some of  the lazy passes to Shaq will be getting stolen or deflected.  9.The interior defense and rotation ability of the Detroit Pistons is at a level the NBA has never seen.  10. CAUSE BIG PAPA AND DIDDY SAID SO

           This is a Diddy and BigPapa collaberation.    Point Guards : Payton/Fisher vs. Billups/Hunter/James   BigPapa:  Payton has lost a step and Fisher is undersized but clutch as hell. If you want to talk clutch Chauncey has to be mentioned. Mr. Big Shot a speed/quickness advantage and a size advantage over Fisher. He must step up for the Pistons to have a shot at winning this series. James and Hunter provide stellar defense off of the bench.  Advantage Detroit .    Diddy:  This seems to be a very key match-up in this series. The Pistons need for Chauncey to have a huge series. At the same time Derek Fisher is clutch, and clutch is everything in life. Gary Payton still has the ability to hit open threes, and he will get open threes in this series. Lindsey Hunter and Mike James will play well, and force at least a few turnovers. Mike James needs to hit open threes.  Slight Advantage Detroit      Shooting Guards : Kobe vs. Rip Hamilton   BigPapa:  Kobe is the best SG in the league. The task of guarding him is going to fall to Tayshaun Prince. Good luck. Rip has been  HUGE  for the Pistons in the playoffs, but not good enough to make me say anything else besides;  Advantage Lakers .    Diddy: Rip Hamilton has been amazing, and will once again lead the Pistons in scoring in this series. Kobe, cannot be stopped when on his game. The advantage is obvious, but Rip could really make a name for himself by the leading the Pistons offensively to an NBA Title. Advantage Lakers     Small Forwards : Devean George vs. Tayshaun Prince   BigPapa:  Devean George knows his role on this team. Play good "D" & hit open shots. Tayshaun Prince is another player who must step up, not only defensively, (he'll be trying to check Kobe) but on the offensive end too.  Advantage Detroit .    Diddy: This appears to be a who really cares match-up. Not the case if you care who wins this series. Both players will make impacts on who wins games. The winner of this match-up will be the player who makes the  BIGGEST  shots. Both players are very inconsistent.  Slight   Advantage Detroit  because Tayshaun is a better defender.    Power Forwards : Karl Malone vs. Rasheed Wallace   BigPapa:  I have a special type of loathing towards Karl Malone. That being said he has been great in the playoffs. He has slowed down the last 2 MVP's. Rasheed must play better offense.  Advantage Lakers .    Diddy: I refuse to say advantage Karl Malone. I won't do it. He is not that good anymore. He has played good D, but he will be getting attacked in the post in this series. Rasheed's length will be the difference.  Advantage Detroit .   Centers : Shaquille O'Neal vs. Ben Wallace   BigPapa:  I'm gonna keep this simple. I love Ben Wallace as a player but its freaking Shaq. Advantage Lakers.    Diddy: Shaq is an unstoppable force. For the Pistons to win Ben must have an impact on BOTH ends of the court.  Advantage Lakers .    Bench (not including PG's): Kareem Rush/Medvedenko vs. Memo/Corless/Elden   BigPapa:  This is an area where the Pistons  HAVE  to dominate. Look for Elden Campbell, Mehmet Okur an possibly even Darko to get minutes against Shaq.  Advantage Detroit .    Diddy:  Here is the difference between these  two bench squads. The Pistons bench rarely makes plays in the fourth quarter. Kareem Rush, Medvedenko, and Fisher all play fourth quarter minutes for the Lakers. The Pistons will win this battle in the first three quarters. The Lakers will have players off the bench hitting BIG shots.  Advantage Lakers .   Predictions    BigPapa:     Pistons in 7  .  Diddy:     Pistons in 6  . They will win one of two in LA, then 2 of 3 in Detroit, then game 6 in LA.

         Point Guard   1. Marbury -He can do everything, he averages 9 assists a game. He is almost impossible to guard when hitting from outside. He breaks you off on the dribble, and everyone on the team becomes open. Only knock is a lot of people are Marbury-haters. 2. Sam Cassell -I believe he was the best PG in the NBA this season, but one season does not make a career. He is probably the best shooter in the league.  3.Mike Bibby -He is nasty. He can't do some of the things that Cassell and Marbury do. But, he can shoot as good if not better. He rains 3 pointers, but rarely will he use his drive to his teams advantage. He is clutch, and clutch is life. 4. Jason Kidd - He makes everyone on his team better. He even seems to make them faster. He also plays good D. He cannot take a game over if his team isn't hitting shots, that is why he is number 4. 5. Baron Davis/Steve Francis -Francis had a lowsy year until the playoffs this year. Baron Davis is also almost unguardable when he is hitting his J.    Shooting Guard   1. Kobe Bryant -I don't really have to explain this one. He wins, and he does everything on the court at an exceptional level. 2. Tracy McGrady - One word "unguardable" 3. Ray Allen - underappreciated. The man can flat out shoot the rock. I would do nothing but shoot a basketball if i could shoot that well. 4. Paul Pierce -A one man team in Boston. He is amazing, he hits high degree of difficulty shots, and expanded his game this season to do more for the team. 5. Lebron James -I hate to leave Rip off the list, but Lebron James is the best athlete i have ever seen with a close second to Mike Vick    Small Forward   1. Shawn Marion -The list of Small Forwards is horrible. Marion has an absolutely UGLY game. I hate having him number one on my list, but Peja is horrible at defense and Marion plays on both ends. 2. Peja Stojakovic -he is good until the playoffs come around. He is still quite 1-demensional. He also is a bad defensive player. 3. Ron Artest -Crazy, stupid, dumb. Awesome defensive player, and improving offensive player. He can guard almost any body under 6'10. 4. Andrei Kirilenko -His game is as pretty as Phoenix Suns shooting lessons held by Amare and Marion. He is a great athlete, he makes plays, and he plays all game every play. His length is an incredible advantage. 5. Antawn Jamison -If he was starting he would score 25 a night.    Power Forward   1. Kevin Garnett - the best player in the league hands down.  2. Tim Duncan - the second best player in the league 3. Chris Webber -Obviously didn't belong here this season. He is an awesome basketball player. He makes passes that most PG can't make, and he can drop 25 and 13 every night. 4. Elton Brand - he is the next Sam Cassell, otherwise known as STUD with ZERO all-star appearances 5. Amare Stoudamire -Amazing athlete at his size. Has a lot of room for improvement. His game is also ugly when he's not dunking. Far from fluid at anything other than jumping and dunking. Phoenix games are not for making instructional videos.    Centers  1. Shaquille Oneal -Amazing specimen. Almost unbelievably strong, and massive. He is hard to stop if he isn't stopping himself from the foul line. 2. Ben Wallace -He changes the game on both ends. I dont have to explain that he can cover 5 guys at the same time and effect almost every defensive possession. But, when on offense the possession is far from over when the Pistons miss. Ben, will get lots of the misses back to his teammates. 3. Jermaine Oneal -he's awesome. He improves every game. He is a very hard guard for everyone in the NBA.  4. Yao Ming -He should be way better than he is. Francis is still having a hard time just dumping the ball to him. He may be unstoppable some day, but he still is a bit soft.  5. Z Ilgauskas -A shade above Magloire. He is big, tall, skinny, and very ugly. But, if the Cavs are smart, they will keep him around. He is hard to guard because of his length.   Honarable Mention list: PG-Arenas, and Tony Parker SG-Redd, Finley, and Hamilton SF-Jefferson, Carmelo, Al Harrington PF-D Nowitski, Randolph, and Gasol C-Magloire   TELL ME WHERE U AGREE OR DISAGREE BELOW...OR JUST TELL ME WHERE I FUCKED UP TOO, THAT'S COOL TOO...COMMENT BELOW

       I must say this is my favorite day in a long time. The monkey that has been the nationwide media is off the Pistons back. The media was saying all season that if the Pistons didn't make the Finals then the season was a disaster. Some of these reporters are probably deleting their articles off their laptops as we speak.   The Pistons are a  resilient bunch  of guys that go out every night and just play basketball together. Give this team a couple years together with the core and this bunch could be dynasty-esque.   The Pistons are Eastern Conference Champions . I am not going to talk much about the game because it was ugly. Rip stepped up in the 4th, as did Chauncey. Teyshaun Prince once again stepped up when it counted the most. His block on Harrington was amazing and critical.    GO PISTONS!!!  Take down the so called " Invincible " Lakers

         That picture is just great. Pistons fans in Indianapolis going crazy on an Indiana Pacers fan. I am pretty sure that if some Pacer fan was going crazy like that in Detroit, he would probably at the very least take a nice beating.  That being said, on to the game. This game will be very hard fought. I hope the officials let the players play, because if not there will be way too many whistles. The Pacers are beginning to see what its like to have a big guy and their PG having injury problems. Chauncey and Sheed have been injured all playoffs so I dont want to hear a single excuse from these guys. Detroit will win tonight. They will not lapse like they did in game 4, this game means too much to them. Lapses like the one in game 4 have happened for every team in the playoffs. It is hard for them not to.  The Pistons will be in control of this game from start to finish. Ben Wallace will have 20+ rebounds. Hamilton will score around 27. Sheed should drop about 17. Everyone will chip in a little bit here and there. Thats how we do. Pistons by 11.

        I personally used to be a Lakers fan. In fact for around a 10 year period of my 23 year old life they were my favorite team not named the Detroit Pistons. That has all changed this season. First off, there is no way possible that I can root for Karl "Gay Ass" Malone. Second off they have the best team you could legally build under the current salary cap rules, and all they do is bitch about this and that. It's funny to me that the guy who does the least bitching is the guy with the most on his mind (Kobe). Malone and Payton bitch about this and that all year along with other Lakers. Some of who are too much of bitches to even say who they are. The word anonomous is the most pussy word in the english language.   All this being said I love the fact that Karl Malone had to go to a team and be the 3rd or 4th option for a chance at a ring. He could not do it as the leader of the team. So the 436 pound Power Forward must go to the Lakers and try to ride on the backs of Kobe and Shaq to get a ring. Flop again you BALCO BITCH, if you throw an elbow at Chauncey or Rip in the Finals I hope Ben RIPS YOUR F*CKING HEAD OFF.  When the Pistons beat the Lakers and  THEIR OFFICIALS IN THE NBA FINALS, I WILL BE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON THE PLANET . IF KARL MALONE WAS TO DIE TOMORROW, I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SEND INVITES TO THE PARTY OF A LIFETIME AT DIDDY'S HOUSE.  All this being said congratulations to the Lakers for making it through all the sh*t they've went through this season to get to the Finals. Kareem Rush, D Fish, and Kobe Bryant are the only Lakers I like these days. Nice shooting Kareem.

       The Pistons did not take too much time to find Mehmet Okur's replacement. They went out and found Antonio McDyess. He has had a very up and down career. He is the Ken Griffey Jr. of the NBA. The good news is that he will not be expected to play heavy minutes in Detroit. We have him for 4 years, with an option for the 5th. Hopefully, he can give us 15 minutes a night and stay healthy. If he does that, who knows he could get back into form. He is only 29. It takes a lot of time to recover from knee injuries. Maybe Darko can play this year....WHO AM I KIDDING

       Diddy and Papa will both give their opinions on the reported NBA deals  First the minor, but reportedly done deal   Pacers get: Stephen Jackson Hawks get: Al Harrington    Diddy:  Talent wise I give the edge to the Hawks. I feel Al Harrington is a superstar in the makings. The thing is that he has never been a superstar, and will Jason Terry be willing to give up the role as the team's superstar. Stephen Jackson was a HUGE part of San Antonio's title run in 2003. He should be able to really help the Pacers out in the playoffs. Jackson is the 3 point threat the Pacers were missing against the Pistons.  EDGE: Pacers, but slightly .   Big Papa: Great deal for both teams. The Pacers dealt from a strength to pick up another, younger three point threat. The Hawks add a young, athletic Small Forward who is a potential super-star. I give the short term edge to Indy but Atlanta got the better player in this deal.  Now the Blockbuster, that Shaq has OK'd but reportedly the Heat for some ignent reason have not Ok'd  The Heat get:SHAQ The Lakers get:Brian Grant, Lamar Odom, and either Caron Butler or a 1st rd pick   Diddy: I think the edge is clearly to the Heat. Shaquille Oneal is a mammoth force. He is getting older, and how many years he has left is unknown. But, the Heat were good last year, and the addition of Shaq will make them instant title contenders. I think that the Heat should give up the draft pick and start Butler. Butler has 20 PPG potential, and is still very young. All I know is that if the Lakers do this deal, and Kobe does not resign.... they will look the Clippers of the past next year.  EDGE:HEAT    BigPapa: SHAQ SHAQ SHAQ SHAQ. The Heat get the edge. I beleive the choice between the pick or Butler is up to the Lakers. Look for them to take Butler if this deal gets done.

       Its very early. But, Memo is basically gone. The Pistons will not overpay him. The Pistons refusing to overpay players has been the key to Joe Dumars success in my opinion. Antonio McDyess has been named as a possible replacement for Okur. Today though I heard a name that sounded extremly intriguing to me. Stromile Swift. I read that the Pistons are going to try to land the freakish athletic power forward in an attempt to replace Mehmet Okur. I believe that Stromile would be a perfect fit for the Pistons. His defensive presence would be perfect in efforts to give Ben and 'Sheed minutes on the bench. He would be a crowd favorite, and also would feed off the energy from the Palace fans. I would love to see Stromile in a Piston jersey.

       Mehmet Okur is going to be playing for the Utah Jazz next season. The Jazz offered Memo a 6 year 50 million dollar contract. That is a lot of money for someone who could not get off the Piston's bench in the postseason. Maybe, just maybe, the Pistons had a lot more talent than people were saying during last season.   Mehmet is a restricted free agent, but there is no chance of the Pistons matching this deal. We offered Memo about ten million dollars less money. The early word on Memo's possible replacement is Antonio McDyess. I am not sure what I think about that, but he used to be very good. He will not have to do much on the Pistons squad. I believe it would be a good fit for McDyess, but not sure it helps the Pistons team all that much.   Early word is that the initial meeting with Rasheed went well. I will not stop being extremly nervous however until I hear Rasheed accepts our offer. The god damn Knicks possibility really scares me. PLEASE STAY SHEED. PLEASE. Lets prove this is no fluke.

          The New York Yankees swept the Boston Red Sox in a very important series this week. There were many amazing plays by both teams in this series. The Derek Jeter play was one of the most amazing plays any fan will ever see. The Yankees are beginning to appear to be the team that most thought they would be at the beginning of the season.  THEY ARE GOOD AT WINNING GAMES, AND THAT IS WHAT MATTERS.  Somedays, their pitching isn't there, and their batting picks them up and gets them the W. On other occassions the offense struggles a bit and the pitching finds a way to get the job done. This Yankees team has a 15 game win streak in them at some time in this season. They are beginning to be the best team in baseball. Yankees haters are starting to get pissed already. Yankees fans are starting to smile.

         There is a new star on the horizon. Her name is Maria Sharapova. She is fine, and she whooped Serena Williams big ol' booty. If Wimbledon.com could have told my ignent white ass what time the match was really at I would have won 300 bucks.

        The Phoenix Suns signed Steve Nash to a 5 year deal. It is paying him an average of 13 million a year. This is way overpaying a player that will be a defensive liability. 13 million dollars is a lot of money for a player who isn't athletic enough to dunk a basketball. Steve Nash is a very good point guard in the NBA. But, this move makes the Suns at best, the newest version of the Dallas Mavericks. This being said, they should make the playoffs in upcoming seasons. However, I do not feel like the signing of Nash does anything to get them past LA, Sacramento, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, or even Memphis. Good move Suns, you just paid 65 million to someone who will sell you real close to ZERO more tickets than you already would have sold. Two days ago the Suns were being talked about as having the best situation to improve in the NBA. They had a young nucleus, and a ton of cap space. Their best improvement they could do with 65 million dollars is a 30 year old PG who plays no defense.

       The Tigers did not need a walk-off homer tonight. The first time I checked the score, the Tigers were losing 3-0. I was thinking to myself, I hope that the streak isn't over yet. The Tigers went on to score in every inning from that point on. Ivan Rodriguez hit .500 for the month of June. That is amazing. The team is absolutely rolling right now. I am looking for them to keep the hitting up. They have been facing lessor opponents lately than in upcoming weeks, so, they will need to hit the ball well for the next couple of weeks to continue to get closer to first in the AL Central. Well, I asked for the Tigers to pass the Indians this week. We are now tied with the Indians. A win tomorrow in the series finale will give the Tigers third place in the Central. Let's get past the Indians, and work on the Twinnies, and the other Chicago team. I don't remember their name :)
