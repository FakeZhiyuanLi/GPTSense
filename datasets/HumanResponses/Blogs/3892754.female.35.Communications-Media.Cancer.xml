      i guess i had to come off the high of the weekend in atlanta, but dam! being back here lately,....sucks.&nbsp; remember when we were in school,...out for the summer? we could not wait to return (partially to show off new cl0thes) but that's not the point.&nbsp; i so,...wanted to stay home this time.&nbsp; coming back to work,...just slapped me into a depressing reality. i have got to flip this script.

         Went home for the weekend and it was AMAZING! I am so ready to return home.&nbsp; I got so much love and support there.&nbsp; I had my Funky Diva Art Show and the response had me speechless.&nbsp; People were mixing, mingling and BUYING! I had so much fun.&nbsp; It was my first solo show and I couldn't be happier with the turn out.&nbsp;         &nbsp;   Now after the event,... we stayed to clean up and hooked up with the security in the building.&nbsp; The coolest thing happened.&nbsp; The security team invited us up to the penthouse (25th floor which is still under construction). We brought wine and hung out on the terrace.&nbsp; To our surprise,...Twista and Kanye West were giving a concert to around 5,000 people below. It was amazing!

         Today,...I got off my butt to vote.  It feels weird.  I don't think I view things like most people.  All I kept thinking about was my ancestors that faught so hard for me to be able to do this.  So many beaten, intimidated and killed for this one simple, yet HUGE RIGHT!      I didn't think in terms of Democrat or Republican,...Nor Black or White Candidate.  Well,... I guess I did think of the Black candidates, but it wasn't about who was Black or White.  I wondered if the Black Candidates considered their positions or even the fact that they could run for office,..."AN HONOR!"  Every candidate should feel that way but considering the plight of  Blacks,...I wondered if they would carry that honor to the office with them and never ignore the needs of the people and try to carry the torch of our ancestors struggles to better the community. I wondered if they had gotten complacent with their positions, (like a lot of people) and just "colllecting a check." I wondered if they took their/our skin color for granted as a "guaranteed vote."      It's amazing really.  When I was younger, I didn't really care,...unless MTV did. The older I get with medical bills, taxes, social securiy,etc. becoming an issue, and oh yeah,...  let's not forget BUSH,...the more I CARE.  It's really affecting me. Everything is.  Why is that?  I guess that is why they say; the older ,the wiser.  I would kill to be this wise,...when I was 12.  (I could pull a do- over)      Anyway,...I could go on.  The ramblings are out of control.  The deal is,...I VOTED TODAY!  I have got to make a difference.  The bullshit of this world, this country, this state,..this county,...this city,...EEEWWWW AND G.W.,....MUST END!

      A friend of mine left a message on my voicemail and I just got around to checking it.  She was so upset that I felt compelled to call her to see if everything was ok.  She never returned my call.  So, I go through my daily routine and check my e-mail only to discover shes online. So, I instant messaged her to see if she was alright.  She proceeds to tell me how some guy told her how worthless she was and he was wasting his time. He said horrible things to hurt her. Being the sweet, naive and loving person she is,....SHE TOOK IT! And cried!  This totally pissed me off because I know we all have moments of insecurity but it's one thing to end a relationship and it's another to go for the juggs!  You know I am all about the GIRL POWER! So this has really affected me. (like the cherub of justice, huh?)  Ladies, and anyone else who feels stepped on and weak,.....  DON'T LET A MAN (HU-MAN OR EVIL SPIRIT) HAVE YOUR POWER,...THE POWER GOD GAVE YOU. YOU ARE GOD'S KID! GOD HAS NO WORTHLESS CHILDREN.  DON'T GIVE ANY MAN (HU-MAN OR EVIL SPIRIT) YOUR POWER! YOU OWN IT!!! YOU LOVE IT!!!! YOU LIVE IT!!!! AND NEVER LET IT GO. IT IS YOUR CONNECTION TO GOD!!! GOD LOVES YOU,... NO MATTER WHAT!!   Didn't mean to preach but all of us, including myself, needs to be reminded of this truth. Always DEPEND ON GOD! He never lets you down.

      What's the worst thing that could ever happen to a creative person? MONDAYS!! That's the day you have to go to work and face civilization. It's the day the mail runs and you know what that means,....BILLS! to stress you out! BOSSES! who live to make you miserable, and the fact that there are 4 more days to remind you of these facts, till playtime. You can't even enjoy SUNDAY for Monday rearing it's ugly head. I HATE MONDAYS! EVERYDAY SHOULD BE A WEEKEND! Please,...Rockerfellers,....Adopt me?

      I have had a fabulous day of lounging. Of course there is the cleaning and tv watching but I am most excited about creating this blog. I get to vent and ramble on. Cool, huh? Well, I have been doing art all day to get ready for my show in Atlanta. I am nervous and excited. CB is hanging out later for wine and cheese.  I love doing stuff like that. Why couldn't my last name be Rockerfeller? Oh well,... that's life.

       FOR MY B-DAY,...MY SISTER GOT PRINCE TICKETS FOR ME. WE ALL WENT TOGETHER. THEY SAY,...PRINCE GIVES HIS BEST CONCERTS IN ATLANTA. OKAY SO,...A SOLD OUT SHOW. A SEA OF PRINCE FANS,...BLACK/WHITE, OLD/YOUNG, CAN/CAN'T/WON'T DANCE,   EVERYBODY!!!   AT THE SHOW. HE SURPRISES US BY OPENING WITH THE TIME. MORRIS DAY IS STILL "DA BOMB!" JEROME HAD THE MIRROR. THEY COVERED EVERYTHING FROM THE BIRD TO 777-9311 TO COOL (AND IT WAS AWESOME TO SEE THE AUDIENCE DO THE HAND GESTURES TO THAT ONE) AND THEN HE BROKE IT DOWN WITH GIGOLOS GET LONELY. PRINCE ENTERED THE STAGE,...LOOKING FABULOUS AS ALWAYS AND HE'S JUST,.... BRILLIANT. HE EVEN DID AN ACOUSTIC VERSION OF ADORE. WE EVEN GOT A FREE CD. ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS 1982-6.       I REMEMBERED WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL TRYING LIKE HELL TO CONVINCE MY MOM THAT MY LIFE DEPENDED ON ME CAMPING OUT AT TURTLES RECORDS (OLD SCHOOL,...NOW THE WHEREHOUSE (NO SUCH THING AS TICKET MASTER OR ONLINE PURCHASES)) TO BE THE FIRST IN LINE TO GET A TICKET AND HOPEFULLY FRONT ROW TO MEET THE MAN I LOVED! I TOLD HER I WOULD DIE AND I WAS NOTHING IF I DIDN'T GO. I TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE AND OF COURSE,....LIKE A SOUTHERN MAMA,....SHE WOULD NOT BUDGE. SHE SAID THAT WE WOULD GO THE NEXT MORNING AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT. I THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING AWAY TO THE CONCERT,..BUT WHERE WOULD I GET THE MONEY? SO I CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP AND POPPED UP EARLY THE NEXT MORNING ONLY TO FIND THAT PRINCE BROKE ALL KINDS OF RECORDS FOR SELLING OUT IN LIKE 5MINUTES. I CRIED. MY LIFE WAS MEANINGLESS. MY MOM WAS SO UNFAIR! SHE APOLOGIZED AND ASKED WHAT KIND OF MOTHER WOULD ALLOW HER CHILD TO SPEND THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AT A RECORD STORE? I SAID, "A COOL ONE!" (ALMOST GOT SLAPPED THAT DAY) I WAS SO DEPRESSED AND MOPED FOR DAYS! I FINALLY GOT OVER IT. FINALLY GOT OVER MY OBSESSION WITH "PRINCE."  WENT OFF TO COLLEGE, BECAME A DJ, AND MADE A NAME FOR MYSELF. KIDS CALL THE REQUEST LINES AND THEY WANT THE BOY BANDS, RAPPERS, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND USHER. I ASK AN 80'S TRIVIA OR PRINCE QUESTION AND IT'S LIKE THERE ARE CRIKETS IN THE ROOM.   MY AVERAGE LISTENER WAS BORN IN THE 80'S. SAD,...I KNOW. THESE DARN KIDS TODAY,...THEY DON'T KNOW GOOD MUSIC. (NOW, I'M 95 YRS OLD,...(NOT LITERALLY)TEE-HEE) THAT'S WHY PRINCE NAMED THE TOUR "MUSICOLOGY."  THESE KIDS HAVEN'T A CLUE.  PRINCE PAID HOMAGE TO JAMES BROWN, A LITTLE ELVIS, SAM & DAVE AND LOUIS ARMSTRONG. ANYWAY,... THE POINT IS,...I GOT TO RE-LIVE ALL THAT IN ONE NIGHT. IT WAS SO AMAZING!! I CAN DIE NOW. (NOT LITERALLY,...DON'T GET ANY IDEAS,....I HAVE MASE)      PS.  THEY WOULDN'T LET ME BRING THE DIGITAL CAMERA,....DANG IT!   DARN CONCERT SECURITY.

       urlLink    okay so the atlanta show went so well that i decided to just swing by the craft stores to get supplies, you know (since i still had a job) and i look out the rear view and see what used to be my exhaust pipe,....dangling from the car, onto the street. OH MYGOODNESS! Here we go again! Always something,...hunh? So,..like the "diva" i am,...i get on the phone and begin to call for back up. Cherime (CHER) calls to find out if she has a wrench, pliers, whatever tool it is you need and she is on the way and I had to call in the muscle. So, RICO comes in,...but not before warning us "today" kinda girls,...to "NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!" ( kinda offfended, but,..okay,...i will let you handle it) He saves the day with his GIANT truck and box-o-tools. He at least fixes the problem well enough to hold me till monday. and check out the exhaust pipe i just had put on like 2yrs ago. (isn't it supposed to last longer than that?) it's all rusted and icky. there goes my art money.  urlLink

      okay so,...this is what i do,....i freak about something that is never what i thought it would be.  the meeting,...you would not believe.  my bosses talked about the overall "perception" of me.  they said that people "perceived me to be someone that would only do something if i were getting something out of it and that i only come in and do my job and leave. (where is the problem?)  they feel that i should "volunteer my services to others.  what do you think?
