      Yesterday was the first time I've put in eight hours of honest-to-god work in my entire life. It's going to take some time to get used to.  I mean really--sitting in an office from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM? Who dreamed up that idea? Even the most meaningful of pursuits (and working on I-884 most certainly is one of them) cannot keep a freewheeling 17 year old on her summer vacation from feeling cooped up after a while. That's why, as Gen mentioned, we really need Ben back. He pioneered what we at the initiative like to call "office sports"--on its way to Olympic recognition if anything is. This new athletic endeavor revolves around the office dolly. After we interns have all eaten lunch and don't quite feel like going back to our computers, we run to the huge vacant rooms next door and race to see who can travel farthest, prone,  on a rolling dolly after a running start. For a challenge, we engineer obstacles out of chairs, duct tape, and old doors (funny what you find in abandoned office space). The adults come by once in a while and shake their heads wistfully. We just feel that it's our duty to bring some youthful energy to a campaign that is, after all, all about kids.  But Ben isn't back yet. That's why it was great to be able to get out with Barb to make our pitch to two members of the Seattle School Board, which is proving frustratingly resistant in granting its endorsement. I mean, if anyone should be behind us, it's Seattle, with some of the highest special needs populations and over $22 million to gain per year should I-884 pass. Sitting in the comfy leather chairs of the School District Headquarters' conference room, we ran through the high points of the initiative (or rather, Barb talked and I chipped in a statistic once in a while). Barb is a former school board member, and so knows exactly which arguments to stress. One of the most potent, considering these members were concerned about the revenue source, was this: a young teacher, making $34,000 per year, is most financially most concerned about 1.) the rent, 2.) childcare, 3.) groceries, and 4.) services like healthcare.  None of these things, in Washington state, have a sales tax on them.  Thus, low wage-earners are minimally impacted by an increase in the sales tax, because--albeit unfortunately and often undeservedly--they have very little discretionary income to be taxed.  That gave them something to think about, and we're pretty sure they'll endorse. Score one for the home team.

      This week, I've been living at a close friend's house in Springfield, OR.&nbsp; It almost feels weird having no one to convince to vote for the intiative or to PLEASE just check out  urlLink http://edtrustfund.org/ , it's almost relaxing.&nbsp; Occasionally I pick up their local newspaper, try to relate to their local struggles.&nbsp; They do have levies to be passed, and water fountains with different chemicals in them, but it's just not the same.&nbsp; My friend has to explain to me everytime I'm buying something exclaiming, "Whoa, 7 dollars even!&nbsp; That's pretty lucky!" that it's only because there is no sales tax.&nbsp; It doesn't change my automatic response to pull out a dollar more when paying knowing that I'm going to need those extra cents.&nbsp; I start feeling though, who cares about the extra cents?&nbsp; How many times do you find yourself ignoring the pile of pennies on the sidewalk, or the quarters under the sofa?&nbsp; Who doesn't have an "extra change" jar in your kitchen because your darn wallet gets too heavy from the nickels and dimes?   Well here in Oregon, sales tax is something laughed at.&nbsp; Instead of that "extra change" jar,&nbsp;they have the "bottles and cans" bucket for their precious 5 cent bottle tax refund they'll get.&nbsp; They scold me for self-recycling my pepsi can instead of walking 6 blocks for the can/bottle machine that will give me back my 5 cents.&nbsp; I understand it promotes recycling, but I have the proper education to understand what can is for the trash and what can is for the recycling.&nbsp; Did I just say proper education?&nbsp; What a nice circle. :)   Anyway, I feel left behind being so far away, that I'm looking forward to racing back to the office next week.&nbsp; I'm also excited that Ben will be back and I can turn around my chair to ask him spelling questions.&nbsp; I love being active, I've realized.&nbsp; It's so exciting.

      Big day yesterday! Lisa and I proved our motto of "We'll go anywhere, or die trying," by driving two hours up to the Washington Education Association (WEA) board retreat, speaking for 15 minutes, and driving two hours back. This was an interesting group--the WEA endorsed quite a while ago, but as Lisa admitted, I-884 is certainly not their "dream initiative." The&nbsp;state's biggest teacher's union is&nbsp;much more fired up about R-55, the anti-charter school referendum which they wrote. Sometimes when you're trying to protect yourselves, it doesn't seem like there is as much time for being proactive in chasing after funding. Still, Lisa gave them a bunch of reasons why they need to stay fired up, because the truth is, we do need them. She even let me get in my two cents: I spoke for about a minute and a half to the 60-odd people in the room. My first speech on behalf of I-884 was as simple, as straightforward as saying "Hi, I'm a student, I'm working for this initiative because students and teachers need it." In significantly more words, of course.  So then, after grabbing a cookie from the well-stocked snack table (this retreat was at the sumptuous Semiahmoo resort, a place that tends to drive poverty-stricken schools from the front of one's mind), we piled back into Lisa's Prius and raced back into town in time for the Seattle regional meeting. About 20 people, from&nbsp;parents to university presidents,&nbsp;crowded around the few tables in our little conference room as we got&nbsp;down to the work of nailing people into commitments. Cherise is very good at this. In her own words, "Everyone wants to tell us,&nbsp;'you know, you should really do&nbsp; this .' Well actually, what we're trying to do is find out what&nbsp; you  can do."&nbsp;The energy in the room, though, was phenomenal. By the end of the meeting, the big sheets of paper stuck to the wall were covered with ideas for fundraising, endorsements, communication, and buzz. Everyone left feeling pumped up, and many people stayed behind to chat about things that high powered education leaders talk about (I left, exhausted, as soon as I could change out of my nice clothes).   I wish I could post pictures on this blog. I would love everyone to see the exciting things that are happening here at the campaign. Lacking technical expertise, however, I'll just welcome you to come in and see for yourself!

      Yesterday evening, Gen and I went to the documentary "The Hunting of the President" at the Cinerama, a fundraiser for the Washington State Democratic Party (of course, Natalie got us in for free). It was quite a remarkable film about how the far right wing went after President Clinton in the 1990s, ruining lives and spending 50 million of taxpayer dollars in the process. It dealt in large part with the story of Susan McDougal, an Arkansas woman involved in a real estate deal with the Clintons known as Whitewater. At the barest hint&nbsp;of wrongdoing, which later proved to be entirely erroneous (trumped up by a bloodthirsty corps of journalists chasing after Watergate-esque Peabodies and Pulitzers) independent counsel Ken Starr offered McDougal a choice: either confirm a completely made up story that we give you, or go to jail. She chose the high road, and spend two years in prison as a penalty for her refusal to lie. What courage, I thought. Would that more people had her integrity. And now she gets the recognition she deserves.  In other news...our meetings are coming together! It's amazing to see so much support for the initiative, even in places where you wouldn't necessarily expect it. People we contact who can't come ask for other things they can do, or if there are other meetings, or give us names of their friends and associates. It's amazing how my awareness of the state has increased since I started working on the initiative. I'm talking to people from Centralia, Kent, Walla Walla--places I only knew as names before the campaign. Now they have personalities, needs, concerns, and hopefully, when the speaking engagements start coming thick and fast, faces as well. It's a constant learning process here at I-884.   Visit&nbsp;a few of the organizations who have endorsed us:  urlLink http://www.wastatepta.org &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.waeyc.org   urlLink http://www.pseofwa.org  and check out our list of hundreds at  urlLink http://www.edtrustfund.org !

      I find myself inside a too-airconditioned-for-comfort environment, busy at my desk, across from my mother, no pay and only enjoying the summer after business hours... some ask me, why the hell are you working there??&nbsp; Well I work here cause I finally am passionate about my work.&nbsp; While all you microcephallic droids are flipping burgers to make the aftermath effect for society a fat and slobbish one,&nbsp;the aftermath of my work is a better economy, better education, lower crime, and&nbsp;the salvation of&nbsp;the planet!&nbsp; Beat that!&nbsp; Alright, so I turned to the extreme--saving the planet might take a little more time.&nbsp; But in the end, the other three may come true. &nbsp; I'm working at the I-884: The Education Initiative.&nbsp; It's a dedicated trust fund for all Washington public schools.&nbsp; From preschool to K-12 to higher education.&nbsp; Promising less class sizes, better teacher pay... ahh oops, I can't say I-884 without stopping my spiel.&nbsp; I've been working here for about a month now and I know this initiative purdy darn well.&nbsp; Got into it because my mom, Barb works with the campaign.&nbsp; I'm so excited about everything that goes on.&nbsp; They treat me like another one of the adult staff than some dumb intern.&nbsp; This is the start of something really big... and I'm right here in the middle of it!

      Time to&nbsp; heave a huge sigh of relief--a very eventful week has come to an end. Enjoyable and exciting, sure, but I'm starting to relearn an appreciation for Saturdays (it sort of fades during most summers). The whole staff was giddy on Thursday morning after our succesful fundraising event and the news of some encouraging polling (Yesterday Cherise, our deputy campaign director, asked Barb, our finance director, if she had come down yet from the fundraising sucess. Barb replied, "No, it's pretty nice up here!") We also&nbsp;started in earnest on the regional planning sessions, which means I have about 30 people to call, e-mail, and then keep track of.&nbsp; I'm working with our Community College liason, Linda Sprenger, and the League of Education Voters' president Lisa MacFarlane, on two of my regions. The depth of their knowledge and expanse of their network of contacts boggles the&nbsp;mind. Lisa thinks nothing of calling the head of the Alliance for Education, the Superintendent of Seattle Schools, the head of the Seattle PTA, whereas I shake in my boots&nbsp;and hide behind the electronic veil of e-mail. I suppose that's something I'm going to have to get over. But the energy in the office is amazing--it's easier to do things I didn't think I could do, simply because people around me give them not a second thought.  &nbsp;  On a side note: I went this morning&nbsp;with Barb and Natalie, our commmunications&nbsp;director, to the Teresa Heinz Kerry rally at the convention center. Sims,&nbsp;Gregoire, and Locke all went before her,&nbsp;waving their arms and yelling about all the things that democratic candidates yell about, fanning the audience's palpable hatred for George W. and his legacy. It sounded very fake, like they didn't realize that charisma is more than pushing the audience's buttons. Theresa, on the other hand, I found very impressive. She is soft spoken, thoughtful, real. She talked in broad generalities--it's not her job to lay out policy--but in a very articulate way.&nbsp;She relates&nbsp;with the crowd on their level, interacting spontaneously and humorously at times. And her record speaks for itself--she is a genuine humanitarian, with a deep respect for the environment (something that gets precious little shrift from the candidates these days). The country would be lucky to have her as a first lady.

      So I've had my first (and most likely last) taste of political fame (if by fame you mean a picture on the 3 page of a local newspapers local section... hmmm...).  It's odd representing something that is so much bigger and more important than me- half the time I want to defer to someone else but at the same time its very empowering to know that people who have devoted so much time and energy to 884 are entrusting 18 year olds with much of its success.  Its also inspiring to be surrounded by interesting, intelligent people who are in the political scene to truly help change the community.  For the citizens by the citizens at its best and most human.

      Whew. After a five hour session exploring this and dozens of other obscure communications terms, I am thoroughly analyzed out. This afternoon, the entire campaign staff gathered in our little conference room to learn the art of communicating our message in person--speechmaking, in other words. There's a lot more to it than eye contact and introduction-body-conclusion.   We began with making three minute speeches on camera. I was surprised at the strengths and weaknesses of the staff--perhaps the best speech was made by my fellow intern and Garfield student Gen Schaad (go Bulldogs!) who spoke so candidly and charmingly about her experience as a PTA daughter with a reading disability that even those of us who have heard every argument for the initiative were moved again. On the other hand, some of our most experienced people, with the broadest command of the facts, stumbled and kept apologizing and laughing nervously. When you come down to it, it's all about comfort and confidence. We talked about localization and personalization and body language, but if you try to think about all those things when you're making a speech before 20 or 30 or 100 people, you're toast.   Above all, I was humbled by the experience. I've gotten pretty good at convincing people in print, but the spoken word is a whole different animal. Nonetheless, we're all going to have to tame it pretty soon: the most intense part of the campaign is yet to come. We're now putting together a calendar of meetings with PTAs, unions, chambers of commerce, teachers, professors, bureaucrats, rotaries, churches, every group you can imagine with a stake in education, all over the state. Some of them are going to need more convincing than others, and I'm pretty sure that I'll make a fool of myself somewhere along the line. But if I manage to convince one person, to me it'll be worth it.

      And just like that, my thoughts are online for all to see! Unfortunately for the web community (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the posts here will be confined to goings on at the campaign for I-884, the Education Initiative. There are a number of us students working here at this airy office in Seattle's South Lake Union district. We have a lot of fun here, and we thought that citizens around the state of Washington might be interested in seeing what it's like behind the news articles and press conferences.   I'm not going to go into the details of the initiative in my first post (though you can find them at  urlLink http://edtrustfund.org ). Rather, I'm going to tell you a little about why I decided to spend my summer with I-884. I go to Garfield High School, housed in a decrepit old building in the Central District. We Bulldogs have a lot of school spirit, but not enough to hide the facts: the majority of our classes are 30-40 students, our test scores are abysmal, and many of our graduates do not make it to college. Much (though not all) of these realities can be traced back to our chronic lack of funds, despite strenuous efforts on the behalf of our PTA.  &nbsp; This summer, I was looking for something I could throw myself into that could make a difference for the hundreds of students at my school and thousands around the state who come to high school unprepared and don't have the grades to get into increasingly selective state universities. I-884 would provide a huge infusion of new money, secured from political meddling, that could provide these opportunities. After finding I-884, I didn't look any place else. From here to November, we are in an all-out race to convince Washington voters that voting yes on this initiative is worth a trip to the polling place.   Let the journey begin! urlLink   urlLink

      As you see in the post below, Becca is leaving us for a three-week trip to India. I'm sure it's not as good as working on an initiative campaign in Washington State, but it's probably pretty close :) Her sunny presence will be missed, but I don't think it's really good-bye until November--she'll probably be in sooner or later.  Speaking of journeys, I just returned from my longest vacation of the summer: four days on Lopez Island with 11 other nuclear and extended family members, including two very active young children. Returning to the campaign on Friday seemed almost calm in comparison. But something struck me when I walked into the office, a feeling that I don't think many other high school interns (except Gen, of course) have experienced: I actually had catching up to do. I have responsibilities that don't go away when I need to go on vacation. I've grown from being presumed to have no skills and being set the most basic of tasks (though copying and data entry and running errands are still no small part of what I do at I-884) to having jobs that require some creativity and thought. Jobs that people depend on me to complete in a timely manner. Jobs that make people register my absence when I've been away for a few days.  Besides the higher degree of responsibility, I feel that there's a higher degree of trust. I'm included in e-mails that aren't necessarily sent out to all staff, in conversations about strategy that don't leave the office. This is what is allowing me to learn about how politics happen, behind the news and spin. And through it all runs the excitement of knowing that I-884--not the governor's race, or the gambling initiative--is probably the most important measure in Washington state on the ballot in November. Something that will make a real difference for all Washington's citizens for as far into the future as the eye can see. Go 884.

      So I'm leaving... on  a jet plane- but actually, first on a boat.  All insincerely nice and very press appropriate comments aside, my time here has been such a good experience for me.  I leave on a bitter sweet note because I finally completed one of my regional meetings last night but now I can't have the satisfaction of watching the ideas we talked about be implemented and really help the campaign.  I'm going to miss the unique pleasure that comes from getting someone else passionate about something you know will help change the state (it really is changing the world one tiny step at a time).  And I leave with the utmost respect for the staff and other interns here- a pleasure to work with always.  This experience has completely changed the way I look at politics- ideas on a ballot aren't (necessarily) the mindless, greedy work of The Man, but instead there are so many kind, interesting people working hard to change our world.  It's all very inspirational.  And so now I say good-bye to 884 and the wonderful people who make it happen everyday- until November sweet initiative!

      Isn't that a cool word? It popped into my mind as I thought of the last 24 hours.  This time yesterday, at 7:21 AM, Ben, Gen and I met at the office and piled into Gen's car for the short drive down to Seahawks stadium, where Sen. Patty Murray was holding her campaign kickoff. We dutifully filled out our volunteer cards and listened to longwinded speeches, but didn't forget the real reason we were there: to secure a little product placement for I-884. When Patty got around to talking about education, every time she stopped for applause, Gen and I would raise our Education Initiative signs for 1,000 people to see. Sometimes you just need to be a human billboard. As I gazed around the hall, I caught sight of Rep. Jim McDermott's familiar face (even more so after his cameo in  Fahrenheit 9/11).  Gen and I decided to approach him afterwards--along with several dozen other well-wishers and admirers--to ask him for his endorsement. He remembered that he had already endorsed, but if so, we hadn't heard about it, so we had something to show our campaign director George when we got back!  Although this blog endeavors to stick to issues surrounding the initiative, there is something that I should really mention. Office sports reached new heights yesterday, as we interns went where no office staff have gone before. A double ramp, at least 3.5 feet high at its apex, composed of doors, chairs, garbage cans, plywood, and cardboard. With ominous cracks, one by one we got over it, rolling on our stomachs on an office dolly. I was the only one to not attempt the obstacle, but that's ok--I prefer to work behind the scenes. Jonathan, our adamant non-blogger, wrote this poem in honor of the pursuit:  The Mysterious Wonder By Jonathan J. Loch  I don't come in early Preferring instead to sleep in; Cozy in my bed. Or maybe I'll play tennis, or swim, or bike or run Over hills, mountains and streams before Work. When I finally do stroll in, well, it's time for Office Sports!  Finally, at 5:45 League of Education Voters Executive Director Mark Usdane and I left for our much-planned and anticipated Green River regional meeting. After having missed our exit, we arrived 15 minutes late and Mark rushed in without his glasses. The gathering was larger than we even expected, and once the ideas started flowing, the attendees were all full of energy. I think the majority left jazzed up, ready to be I-884 ambassadors. I learned that sometimes, as a facilitator of a meeting, one has to resist the urge to say "That's good, now let's move on" every time someone gets a little long-winded on a non-helpful subject. We want to stay on track, but being authoritarian about it, especially in a room full of people who are used to a certain measure of respect, may lead them to close up. Mark was able to strike a good balance between pressing for commitments and letting people have their say. It's a skill I'd like to have.  And our host Linda's hors d'oevres were excellent!

      Waking up early has never been my forte. After hitting my snooze button 3 times this morning I can attest to that. But finally around 8 AM by the plea of my wonderful cat, Gizmo, for attention and alertness to his every need, I wake up groggily ready for work. Gizmo always knows best.  By 8:30 AM I tell my mom that I want to get in no later than 9. As we are getting ready to leave, first the mother inspection must take place... "Sweatpants Gen??"  "You are impossible, mom," I return to my room to change.  At 8:58 I exit my car happy at my promptness. Walking over to the front door, my key at the ready, I discover the familiar sight, a simple bicycle with streamers off the handles. The back of my mind scolds me, "Next time come earlier." The bicycle belongs to Lydia and she beats me to work almost everyday. Lydia and I both go to Garfield High School, same grade, same age. Although we both know our strengths and what we can do best, I can't help the little voice in the back of my mind begging me to get in a tad earlier everyday.  In all other ways, I think it's awesome that Lydia has joined us. She's very responsible at calling and scheduling and completing any task in front of her.  Now when I get jealous or feel left behind, I feel comfortable to come up to her and talk to her one-on-one.  This is proven a better way than the internet, "he said, she said," business where I blog my feelings instead of talking about them.  I think together we contribute a great deal to this campaign and am proud that we've gone so far.

      Well, Ben's back...along with Lisa, and Natalie, and Gen, and Mark. It's starting to feel like a zoo down here at the Education Initiative! I can't even answer the phone anymore; anytime I hear a ring, it's instantly silenced by Ben, Gen, or Lexie. I can imagine how the unfortunate caller must be caught off guard. In fact, the only person who isn't here is Cherise, but it's almost as if she was: I get e-mails from her every day, and us interns always go back to the comprehensive to-do list she prepared last week if we find ourselves at loose ends.  Along with the excitement that people bring, there are a few energizing things that would have me whistling (if I knew how). First of all, the Children's Alliance endorsed today, which is great news. (see their press release at  urlLink http://www.childrensalliance.org ). Also, we all huddled around the computer to watch the webcast of KING 5's program "Upfront with Robert Mak" on I-884, which aired for a half an hour over the weekend. Along with interviews of community college people, who gave a compelling picture of the enrollment crisis, and a portrayal of overcrowding in K-12 classrooms, the program featured question-and answer sessions with Citizens for a Sound Economy's Clyde Ballard and our very own Lisa Macfarlane. CSE, headed by former Bush advisor Dick Armey, would be more aptly named "Rich White Men for a Tax-Free America." They keep themselves busy by trotting around the country,  indiscriminately throwing their weight against tax hikes of all stripes. None of us were impressed with Ballard's performance, since even the interns could easily defeat every argument he put forth. Lisa of course, was fabulous (although she moaned about it afterwards), answering every question with poise and precision (see the program at  urlLink http://www.king5.com/cgi-bin/bi/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/ki_080104upfront.wmv ). We're pretty sure that a grand total of about 3 people watched the whole thing, and one of them was our communications director. But a little good publicity never hurts.  And finally: I'm learning to update the website! This intern junket has turned me into more of a tech head than I ever imagined. Blogging a few times a week, checking my e-mail every two minutes, navigating our network with ever-growing ease, and now webdesign? I'm a whole new woman.  Sort of.

      After a week of family time and two weeks of jazz camp, it's back to the grind for me. I returned to the LEV office this morning to the warm, but entirely non-physical, office-appropriate greetings of the rest of the crew. The campaign space is hot and muggy and deafeningly quiet, tempered only by the polite buzz of the giant fan at the front of the office that saves us all from asphyxiation. So far this morning I've checked three different e-mail addresses, teased Natalie about her search for a husband at the DNC, set up this blog account, bemoaned the lack of cups at the water cooler, and rubbed my tired eyes about a hundred times. Right on, office work! Anyway, after being out of the loop for three weeks, I have no clue what's going on here. I should go fix that.

      No, it's not a cheesy Democratic Convention campaign slogan.  I spent my afternoon yesterday manning a table for I-884 at Rolling Thunder Democracy Festival, a field filled with every imaginable liberal cause leafleting and button-selling their little organic hearts out.  It was hot as blazes (for Seattle, which means 80 degrees), and unlike the myriad organizations surrounding us, we had neglected to bring any sort of shade. Still, I took it as an opportunity to deepen my tan (already a pleasing bronze, if I may say so) and my two-hour shift went by in a flash. Between chatting with the other wonderful people who staffed the table with me--teachers from the Seattle community colleges, who know firsthand the need for more education funding--and hailing passersby to regale them with information, scarcely a moment passed where I found myself inactive. I'm happy to say that a large percentage of those who stopped by our little table left as a newly-minted I-884 endorser, wearing a sticker, carrying brochures to give to friends, or all three. Of course, this was possibly the easiest crowd we could have, being a group of politically active lefties, but as we pride ourselves on being an initiative that reaches across party lines (who doesn't like education?) I'd like to think we won some converts.
