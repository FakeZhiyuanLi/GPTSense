      One of the bizarre social rituals I go through every day is that of the commute.  Living in Wokingham and working in London means that I have to get the 07:25 train each morning.  Every day I get up at 6:30am and wend my weary way to the train station.  Every day I stand in exactly the same spot on the platform.  Every day I see exactly the same people on the opposite platform.  Every day I silently curse as I end up sitting next to the man with the broadest shoulders in the world clearly taking up more than his one allocated seat of space and everyday I try to think of ways that would make the whole thing more fun.  I am lucky in one respect that at the moment some of my friends get the same train.  We have generally sit together and when not on the train make fun of some of the people we see everyday.  Two such characters spring to mind.  One is known as Brads' "Clapham J mate" purely because him and Brads virtually sit next to each other and both have to take their life in their hands when attampting to exit the train at Clapham Junction.  I have a feeling they would be brothers in arms if it wasn't for the fact that "Clapham J man" seems a bit of a dubious character.  He has a penchant for reading Mills and Boon type books and seems to be a serial commuter, apparently getting on random trains at Clapham Junction after leaving the Waterloo service.  Numerous stand offs have occurred between brads and this mystery character when trying to leave the train; each one wanting to follow smoothly in the others slipstreamas they carve a near impossible path through wall to wall commuters.  Another character is known as "Scribbling bird".  Little is known about her other than she wears pink a lot and likes to scribble on sheet music in quite an annoying manner while the rest of the carriage is trying to sleep.  I find commuting a rather strange social custom. The British are probably too reserved to make small talk with anyone else other than close friends, which is stranger since we see the same people virtually every day. Perhaps it is good though that these people remain mysterious characters; if they started talking to you, you might find that they are annoying twats, which at 7:30am is something you really don't need.  Last night also the event that is the weekly powerleague match.  I play for a team called the "Winnersh Warriors", which is steeped in history and tradition.  Formed in 1995, the club celebrates its centenary next year.  Powerleague matches (5-a-side, rolling subs) are usually very eventful things, though they generally seem to follow the same script; Quinze pisses the other team off with his robust tackling, Alex blows a gasket when somebody makes a slight error in judgement he never would have made, i run around too much and get fucking knackered, despite having a couple of tasty players the opposition do not play as a team thus allowing us to win by a random amount of goals.  All of these things indeed happened last night (apart from the fact the Quinze seemingly did not piss anyone off; he must have been feeling under the weather or something).  The winning margin was 10 (13-3), and I was at the sharp end of the Kelly rant.  Other than that nothing to out of the ordinary happened, apart from the opposition having the oldest player in the world on their team.  I imagine it will probably be exactly the same next week.

      Yesterday was Christopher Atkins' 24th birthday (my landlord). Happy birthday.  In a bout of inspiration, his parent's got him a BBQ which was put to full use yesterday since that sun was out.  Personally I think BBQ's are great: one of the reasons for this is that it brings out one of man's primal instincts.  Along with mating with women and causing damage to stuff, cooking on a BBQ is something that every man instinctively knows how to do, and will be drawn to like a moth round the light.  I find it strange that I do not think I have ever seen a female cook at a BBQ in my life.  This might have something to do with the fact that they do not have the same built in knack as men do for being able to burn something so thoroughly on the outside and yet get it so raw in the middle.  Though as my housemate Alex pointed out, the bits of charcoal on the outside even up with the raw bits in the middle, so everything averages out to have bit of well cooked meat.  On the subject of Alex Kelly, I feel I should take this opportunity to point out that he is my main inspiration in the art of entertaining.  Yesterday he was complaining that I nicked the use of the phrase "peer pressure never did anyone any good" that appears on my profile.  This is not technically correct, since I am pointing out it is one of the lessons I have learned in life, but I learned from it from a true comedy genius.  Other good phrases he has used which I wish I had thought up/introduced to other people and would like to nick include: 1) A man is not a camel 2) Not on my watch 3) You can't polish a turd 4) Cremen die cheste  Alex Kelly I salute you, though you will never be able to sing as well as me.

      The last 24 hours have been notable for a few things.  Firstly was the FA Cup final and some of the most audacious football boots seen by man.  Basically they were gold, and apart from myself, I cannot think of a player they would be more appropriate on.  His fancy footwork would not look out of place in the Riverdance, and he brightened up an otherwise very dull game which Man Utd won at an absolute canter.  The FA cup final have produced two of my happiest moments when watching footie (the 1997 and 2000 Chelsea wins) and also the only time I have ever cried after watching a match (the 1994 final when Chelsea got stuffed 4-0).  The Man. Utd players looked pretty non-impressed after winning it, apart from Eric Djemba-Djemba who was having a whale of a time, despite not having got on, and Kleberson bizarrley who wasn't even on the subs bench.  Man Utd have been looking for a replacment for David May for some time, and now it seems they have got 2 who absolutley love to celebrate their team mates success when they have done fuck all.  In the immortal words of Lee Trundle, I love dvd's, and I watched one of my latest purchases last night, The Last Samurai.  Pretty good overall (IMDB score 7.8 out of 10).  What stood out for me though was the cover of the DVD case.  It seemed somewhat familiar, and when I looked at the covers of Minority Report and Mission Impossible 2 I found out why; all three covers consist of 95% Cruise-meisters face in a sort of thoughtful/action pose and not a lot else.  I cannot really think of anything more to say about this.  I also played tennis today for the first time in 6 years.  Needless to say my game has gone downhill rapidly in that time (not that it was ever that good).  A lot of shots seemed to miles long and miles high: I guess I just don't know my own strength.  I was by far the weakest link in the match I played, but looking on the bright side (which I do in 99.4% of cases) it means I can only get better.  More later.....

      Last night I went to a club night in London called "How does it feel to be loved".  This night was basically a celebration of all things twee, playing jangly indie tunes in French from the likes of Belle & Sebastian and mowtown tunes from people like Dusty Springfield.  One of the people that the organisers seem to take their main inspiration from is ex-Smiths lead singer Morrissey.  After hearing about his interview last week on The Jonathon Ross Show I have come to a conclusion that many people came to many years ago, and that he really is a miserable bastard who should lighten up a bit.  Sorry, had to get that off my chest, but I think a man should have more than 7 people he has ever met in his life who he has liked.  The night overall was very good though.  Even better was the kebab at the end of the night; one of the best I ever had.  it was a mixed kebab, and it had some of the nicest chilli sauce ever, and even the doner meat tasted good.  The guys behind the counter also wore the best waistcoats I have ever seen.  Yesterday also marked the first time I have ever been on the Victoria London Underground line.  Interesting huh?  More tomorrow.......
