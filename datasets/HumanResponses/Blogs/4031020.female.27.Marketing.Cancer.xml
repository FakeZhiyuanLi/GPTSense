						   Weight: 290  Food: 2 cans of Cheez Balls 1 20 oz Diet Mountain Dew Bowl of grapes Foot long Subway sandwich 32 oz. pink lemonade Cookie 2 Fat free Italian Ice snacks  Maybe I'll end this week with a 2 lb. weight loss. Maybe not. Either way, I'm very glad that I finally put it out in the open (at least to myself, since I think I'm the only one reading this blog), and I can see with my own eyes that I must make a lot of changes if I'm going to lose a ton of weight in the next 5 months.  Tomorrow is the start of a new month. Don't you just love fresh beginnings? I think God gave us new beginnings for a reason. New minutes start every 60 seconds, new hours every 60 minutes, new days every 24 hours, new weeks every 7 days, new months every 30 days or so, and a new year every 12 months. That was no mistake. Every day is a day to to start over.  Tomorrow is August 1. I'm so glad I started this little journey of mine exactly 7 days ago. I got to see a week of how I am when I call myself trying, when in reality I'm barely making the effort. That changes now.  I finally made it to the grocery store. Wow! Who knew it would actually happen? Now I have healthy food to eat and a determination to do it. Tonight I'm going to pray for help and follow a more calculated type of plan.  My teeth hurt. I need to go to the dentist desperately (like for the past 6 months), but I can't afford it. Bleh.

						   Weight: 290  Food: I don't even want to GO there.  I always seem to have my most poignant revelations after I've eaten an insanely huge meal. It's also very easy to promise myself all the things I'm going to change when my stomach is full. When I'm hungry, I could care less about changing my life -  I just want to eat .  I don't hate thin people. I also don't admire them. I truly think people are just people, and everyone has their quirks. I have to admit though, that sometimes I wish my "quirk" wasn't so damn visible. I mean, you've got your anorexics, your alcoholics, your nymphomaniacs, your drug addicts and your fattys. For the most part, these people can pretty much hide their problems and either work them through personally or literally kill themselves over it.  Except the fattys.  No, we have to not only eat ourselves miserably into oblivion, but the whole damn world knows it. And then the world makes fun of us for it. Even Paris Hilton would have to admit that sucks. Except she doesn't know what it feels like so she could probably care less. Hell, I could care less about her problems, so who can blame her?  I walk around every day advertising that I have a problem. So what do I go and do? I start a blog, so I can talk about my own big fat ass. What a genius thing to do.  Actually, jokes aside, the point of this blog is to help put my weight back in my face. A few years ago, I moved to a separate city after graduating from college. A year and a half after starting my first job, I started losing a bunch of weight. I started out at 263 lbs., and then I lost 55 of them. Yep, I held steady right around 208, and I stayed there for a while, waiting for my next "losing spurt" because it happens in cycles of determination. Actually, even at 208 I was quite fit. You could see my abs, I was in a size 18, which is just 4 sizes larger than the average woman, and I could run a few miles per day. I was large, but NO ONE would guess that I was over 200 simply because my level of fitness was so high.  Then my dad got sick and I moved back to Chattanooga to run the family business. My hometown.  The city that made me want to eat in the first place because all my problems started here.     It was a good decision. I think I accomplished what I set out to do. My father died, and I was here for my family when it happened. But here it is, exactly 2 years and 6 weeks after I moved back home. Not only did I eat my 55 lbs. back, but I added 29 more. The fog is lifting and realizing what I did to myself is very devastating.  That's why I'm more determined than ever to beat this thing. As you can see from the first week, I'm a serious creature of habit, and it's very hard for me to change my patterns.  But once I do, there's no turning back.  I did it before.  I can do it again .  In my heart, I know I've already won this battle. But the journey is the fun part, so I hope you can join me.

						   I'm fat. I'm so freaking fat.   Weight: 292   Food:  3 ribs, Baked Beans, Potato Salad  Chick-Fil-A Sandwich, Waffle Fries, Diet Lemonade  20 oz Smoothie  1 Pint White Turtle   So here's the deal. On the Chick-Fil-A, I actually ordered the biggie size, but later reduced it. That was my only victory for the day. Hoo-ra, Hoo-ra. Actually, I'm just saying that to make myself feel better for being such a fatty. Writing this&nbsp;blog has helped me realize one thing. I like being a fatty. Who cares if I bury all my emotions into food instead of booze, drugs, sex, work or relationships? Nobody could give a damn.   Except me.   That's the one problem. Me. I truly hate being like this, but look, it's been 5 days and I'm still resisting making permanent changes. How on earth do I interpret that? Creature of habit? Self-sabotage? Who gives a damn what the psychoanalysis is? I'm HUMONGOUS.   I had a job interview today. I really need a job because I'm getting married in April and I have no money. The family business went out of business and that was where I worked, so now I'm SOL. I had this job interview, and whereas I'm usually overly confident in my abilities, this time I felt like I was faking it the whole way through.   The head conversation went kind of like this (italics = thoughts, plain letters = actual spoken words).   Interviewer: "So, tell me about yourself. "  There's no desk to hide behind! How huge do I look to this little tiny lady?    Well, I've been in marketing for 5 years now...    I wonder if my humongous cheeks are shiny.    I have great experience...    Are they looking for someone who has to be camera friendly? Because they should have just turned me away at the door if that's the case!    My past jobs have given me so much experience...    If you hire me, I swear I'll lose weight! I'm getting bigger simply because I need this job so much!    Marketing is exciting to me...    Please, be mesmerized by my lilting voice and outstanding work history&nbsp;and not my shiny face and jiggling jowls.    I am a perfect fit for your company.    This is agony. If I start sweating, I'm getting the hell out of here.    It's highly irritating trying to interview when you can't get past your own looks. Never before have I been so concerned with how my weight affects my interviews. I'm quite capable with an outstanding resume and I've landed jobs much more often than I've been passed up for them, so this is unnatural to me. This is the first time I've ever had an interview above 250 lbs. It truly is agony, and I hate it. Big, humongous reason to lose this weight NOW.   Notice that I'm back to my original weight (from Sunday!) today. Don't be surprised, this happens every time because of my out of control eating. Every time I try to lose weight, I end up right back where I started. This time, I'm just going to work through it, and eventually past it.   Yep, I still plan on getting to that (*)@#$@# grocery store and following the rules - that *I* made up for myself no less! I can't believe how hard it is to get motivated to do this. It's such an overwhelming task, that I don't even want to start it, lest it never end. Then again, I haven't stopped thinking about my weight in about 4 years now, so what makes me think NOT doing anything about it will make it better? I would love to end this journey as soon as possible. I'm working on it folks.   Really good bit of news: Today I went walking with a friend. We were out for about an hour and a half, 60 minutes of which was walking (with a stroller, not too brisk). It was so difficult for me, which is ridiculous because I used to be able to run this distance without blinking. But it's my first exercise since I started the blog so I'll be sure to keep it up. Our next adventure is to go bike riding, and I'm looking forward to that. I just feel VERY sorry for my bicycle tires. I hope they make it!   My unemployment check will post to my account tomorrow. Once again, my primary goal will be to hit the grocery store. Only this time, I mean it.   Wish me luck.

						    Today's stats:   Weight: 288 (Another pound gone! Woohoo!)  Food: 14 pieces sushi - tuna, shrimp, eel Miso Soup Salad Chick-Fil-A Combo #1 (sandwich, fries, diet lemonade) 6-piece chicken strips  You know what? Discussing my food choices every day could get awesomely boring, so I think I may just make light comments and move on to lighter fare. Don't ask me about the Chick-Fil-A. Notice I  still  haven't been to the grocery store yet. Actually, I had very healthy sushi today, just 2 rolls and 2 nigiri with soup and salad, and Chick-Fil-A's chicken sandwiches meet the 30% fat requirements. Plus, I got the diet lemonade. It was the supersized fries and chicken strips that put me over the top. But since it was an improvement over yesterday, I think I'll make note of the fact that each day I make better choices. Maybe by the end of the week, I will be cooking for myself instead of depending on strangers to feed me.  To all you "skinnys" out there, listen up. For someone at my weight, 288 now, going to the grocery store is a harrowing experience. No, the food is not calling to me - I could care less about the Entenmann's and the Krispy Kreme. It's just the experience in general. You see, fat people know more about dieting, weight loss, health and food than any normal person could ever know. We've read it all. We know it all. Losing weight has nothing to do with knowledge.  However, it's that knowledge that is my downfall. Let's say I want to buy spinach. Here's what a typical thought process is like:  Spinach sounds good. What an excellent choice! I can get it canned, but actually that's not as healthy as fresh. How does one cook fresh spinach?  I bet you have to use olive oil. Hmmm, maybe I won't buy it fresh - I can't spare all that olive oil.  Do I even have olive oil at the house? How many calories does spinach have again? 20. 20 per serving.  Wow, I could eat 20 servings and still not eat as many calories as I had for lunch! So should I get it in a bag, like lettuce? No, I think I'll buy it loose. Organic is even better than bagged. Damn, the organic costs twice as much! The last time I ate spinach, I was on the pooper for an hour. OK, I'm deciding on the fresh, non-organic spinach. Maybe I'll eat it like a salad! Oh crap, what about dressing?  Should I use lemon juice? Ugh. They've got some lowfat stuff.  Remember, that stuff tastes like urine. How about the low carb? Argh! Forget the damn spinach!  Every time I step foot in a grocery store, I end up with this dialog that drives me absolutely insane. I really would like freedom from that. I bet skinnys can just walk into a grocery store and buy spinach and then figure out what to do with it later. Me, I have to consider calories, carbs,&nbsp;servings, how it has to be cooked, what affect it will have on my body and last of all, whether I even think it tastes good. It's a real pain.  And it's like that for every choice I make.   Health knowledge isn't always an asset.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   Man, I really suck at changing my life for the better.  Today my diet has been:  Arby's Turkey, Ranch Bacon wrap (I figured as long as I'm eating fast food, I may as well go low carb. Stupid, stupid logic). Small order of cheesesticks Large Sweet Tea Caramel Cashew Waffle Cone Pint of White Turtle Ice Cream  All in all, I think I did better than yesterday, but not much better. I never did go to the grocery store like&nbsp;I said I would. Hell, I didn't even shower today. That is a HUGE first step for me. I think I will make it my #1 goal for the morning.  Don't worry - I'm still going to make it! Changing my fat mentality is really going to be a pain, I can see that already. My mind WILL submit!!!!!!!!!!

						   Weight: 289 lbs.   Wow! Yesterday was a challenging day.    Day One Food:   1 apple  3 roma tomatoes  2 large scoops of chunky peanut butter    Day Two Food:   Large baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, barbecued pork and bbq sauce  1/2 homemade Pecan Toffee Bar  Wendy's Bacon Cheeseburger, Great Biggie Fries, Chicken Strips and Great Biggie Sprite   Day Two is really a typical day for me. You do NOT get to&nbsp;292 lbs. without a concentrated effort at eating and&nbsp;not exercising.&nbsp;The 3 lb. weight drop occurred because of the small amount I ate on Day One. Day One is not a typical healthy day for me, I just ended up sleeping an awful lot and I didn't do much so I wasn't hungry. I might have been a bit fatigued. Probably because I weighed 292 lbs.!   One notable thing that happened yesterday was my niece was with me when I ordered that baked potato and she ordered the EXACT same thing. Keep in mind that she' s only 14, but she's still growing and she's thin as a rail. Her whole family (my sister's husband/children) is naturally thin, so she never overeats. While I almost cleaned my plate of that baked potato (even *I* couldn't finish that monster), she ate approximately 1/4 of the whole thing. And even more, she had no problem throwing away the remainder of it!   Initially she said, "I'm going to eat this whole thing." Yet, she didn't charge into it ravenously like I did. She took her time eating it, she mixed it all together until it was perfect, then she ate it with relish. When she was done, she was done. We both laughed at how much she had left on her plate, but secretly I wish I could have done such a thing. There's something about that amount of food put in front of me that presents some type of challenge. There's a voice in my head that says, "You can eat it... just dive on in... wait, don't leave that piece out just because it doesn't taste as good... you paid for this, so finish it!"   Tapping into this knowledge again is going to help me continue toward my goal. What I need to&nbsp;do is go grocery shopping. After reading a small mountain of dieting books throughout the course of my life, and losing more than 50 lbs. a few years ago (only to gain back almost twice as much) &nbsp;I already know what my eating plan will be. It will be lenient in some places, strict in others. But with my aggressive goals, I have to have a specific plan or I'll eat about 100 more stuffed baked potatoes between now and then!   My eating plan is as follows:  Any kind of white fish, broiled, baked or steamed  Any kind of fruit (preferably raw, fresh)  Any kind of vegetable (raw or steamed)  Any kind of herb or spice  Limited amount of extra virgin olive oil  Basmati Rice (Is it just me or is it extremely difficult to stomach brown rice?)  Brummel & Brown non-transfatty margarine-like product  Guilty pleasure: ONE Bruster's ice cream cone per week (yep, it can be single, double or even triple!)   See? My eating plan includes a lot of different types of flavors, combinations and allowances. I basically just took out refined products, processed products and other stuff that I don't really like anyway. And my guilty pleasure... well... we all scream for ice cream!&nbsp;&nbsp;*smile* Since there is so little sugar in my diet, this may disappear after a while, but as for now, it is a happy part of my list.   My first step? I'm off to the grocery store!   P.S. I'll be posting pictures of me and all kinds of good stuff in the near future! I just don't have many pictures of me at my top weight yet, but we recently went on vacation in the Bahamas so when I get them back, I'll post them.

						   Weight: ??? Didn't check  Food: I ate well - fish, a baked potato with just Brummel & Brown, and some rice. The only bad thing was an enormous amount of ice cream.  Today's thoughts are about something simple: Burying Emotions. I don't plan to censor myself in this blog for obvious reasons - for one, it would be horribly boring and for two, that would defeat the entire purpose for writing it. But recent online conversations had me thinking about how much we fattys bury behind food. Hell, I eat sex, drink pain and gobble down frustration like a Thanksgiving feast. My fiance and I are waiting for marriage until we have sex, which is fabulous IMO, but in the meantime, I'm still a woman, and I still have needs! Whoops - I'm getting off topic. hehe ;)  Anyway, haven't we had enough of that? I mean, what has food ever done for us that warrants that we use it as a cure-all for every event or emotion, whether it's positive or negative?  If anything, I would love for my fellow fattys to just get downright nasty with what they have to say, and stop worrying about who 'appreciates' what you are saying and who thinks you're an ass for speaking your mind. I would love to hear fattys just admit their problems. Remember "What Women Want," that movie starring Mel Gibson where he could hear women's thoughts? I imagine that if that movie was entitled, "What Fattys Want" it would sound something like this:  "Food tastes better than sex feels sometimes." "I love my children, but they are awfully annoying. I'd secretly prefer that they watch TV than whine in my ear about their homework." "I make a load of money, but I would totally trade in my job for a smaller house, an older car and zero debt if that were socially acceptable." "Why do all these trainers keep trying to force me to love exercise? I just do it because I have to, and no other reason." "How come you never see a jogger smiling?" "Are people looking at me? Is my ass jiggling? I wish I could *will* my ass to stop jiggling!" "I'm tired. I'm so very tired." "If anyone could see what I'm eating right now, I'd be horribly embarassed." "Maybe I should just give up. No, I can't give up, I'll be 500 lbs.!" "I resent her for giving me dieting advice. Does she realize I have read exactly 17 low carb books, 58 lowfat books, subscribed to 6 fitness magazines and I even accidentally bought TWO copies of the South Beach Diet? Does she think I don't  know  how to lose weight? I'm the master and commander of weight loss knowledge!" "If I gain one more dress size, I'm going to have to buy a whole new wardrobe." "Isn't being fat punishment enough? Do I have to be broke and ugly, too?"  I can't say that I've felt all of those things... or even most of those things. But I've read them or heard them from friends, ranging from 10 lbs. overweight to 100 lbs. or more. Yet, we still feel a need to hide from people, to cater to how others feel about we might say, or how we might feel. Well, you know what I say? Screw 'em.  I've been catering to other people long enough. I've kept my mouth shut and politely obliged, apologized or catered to others when someone told me what to think, how to act, what to eat, what to wear, and where to go. And you know where it got me? 290 lbs., in the unemployment line, with enough debt to feed an entire city and less than a week's worth of clothes to wear. I'm  over  caring about other people's opinions of me.  I'm starting my new job on Monday. I have the opportunity to get away from my hypercritical family and make new friends. I finally have the chance to tackle my weight without being embarassed about who I might see at the gym that I knew when I was smaller. I don't have to worry about my sister (who owns a catering business) manipulating me to try her latest concoction. Or eating Sunday dinner with soul food, which I hate. It's like starting over!  Anyway, I bet if more fattys let their emotions out instead of keeping them buried down, there'd be less fat people in the world. Or at least less unhappy ones!

						   Weight: 290  Man, I'm starting to realize that I really suck at this. Last night I was watching the Olympics and I'm just fascinated with the physical feats these kiddies can accomplish. I say kiddies because I heard one of the announcers call a swimmer "old" and he was 23. And in gymnastics, 23 is ancient. So kiddies it is. But damn impressive ones!  These kids train rigorously, which means they probably have to eat prescribed meals, sleep very little, work out constantly, and strive for perfection. What looks flawless to my eyes may look horrible to the eyes of a critical judge.  I saw an Olympics commercial that had a bunch of people saying "I can." "I will." "Get ready." to themselves to get their adrenalin flowing before a competition. I think that attitude is the one thing I lack in trying to lose all this weight.  Losing 140-150 lbs. *is* an Olympic feat. It requires the following: - Abnormal determination to beat the odds - Special diet to achieve maximum performance - Daily workouts and rigorous training - The ability to ignore the naysayers and critics - Critiques of goals and performances - The ability to accept wins  and  losses gracefully - Comfortable with strangers watching you, waiting for you to mess up, and proving them wrong  Seems the biggest difference is, I'm not representing my country and I don't get a gold medal if I make it to the top. And I get no recognition if I actually achieve this feat, besides societal acceptance and oh yeah... health. I think the general consensus in America is that if you lose weight, it's no big deal, you should have never let yourself get so fat in the first place.  So the Olympics have given me a new reason to shine today. No more Greek desserts, heavy pastas and fast food for a while. I am back to my fish, rice, fruit and veggies (and I'm glad about it!).

						   Weight: 290, 288  Sunday Food: Greek Shrimp Tourkemanelolo (incorrect spelling) Tortiyava (incorrect spelling) Leftover angel hair pasta from Saturday 1/2 sugar free Greek cake Popcorn King Size Almond Joy Movie-sized Sprite  Monday Food: McDonald's McChicken Sandwich Large Fries Large Sprite Apple Pie Greek Oreo Cake Greek Sugar Free Cake  In the interest of celebrating the Olympics, and its return to Greece, my friend and I went to The Acropolis, a local Greek restaurant here in town. Of course, after my diet in Atlanta AND my Greek special interest day, PLUS movie-sized snacks at Bourne Supremacy, the scale lashed out at me this morning like an abusive husband. The red glow of the digital numbers glared at me like someone just recovering from an alcoholic binge. 290! Fatass! What the hell were you thinking??  Know what I was thinking? Mmm... buttery croissants (delectable!)... pasta baked in mozzarella (sinful!)... Greek (it's a celebration!)... movies (a movie isn't a movie without a jumbo snack...or three!)... and more cake (because my scale yelled at me).  And I was doing so well for the past couple of weeks, too! Well, all is NOT lost. I'm still looking forward to moving to Atlanta and making good use of the fitness center and swimming pool on my complex, Shamu bathing suit and all.  After all, if I'm going to develop a secret competition with a pregnant woman in my imagination, I should get on the stick right away, right? hehe...

						   Weight: 288  Food: Was in Atlanta today - went to an English tea for lunch and Italian for dinner.  Tomorrow is weigh-in, but I wouldn't be surprised if I broke even. I had Italian for dinner in Atlanta. I only ate 1/2  my entree, but I feel 'heavy.'   Other news:  I found my apt. in Atlanta today! I did a ton of research but I really believe God led me to the right one today. It was the LAST ONE I saw, and it's also by far the cheapest one available in Buckhead. Yet I have all new carpet, walls and appliances, with  new  hardwood floors in the bathroom! NICE! I would tell you guys where it is, but you'd just drive the price up when you flocked out to rent a place. hehe... Btw, this place has an AWESOME fitness center that I will most definitely be using often!  What I want to talk about today is a friend of mine that lives in Atlanta, and who, by the way, is excited about my imminent return to the city! I'm also excited to see her more often. This friend successfully lost 140 lbs. a couple of years ago and she is now pregnant. We even started our own weight loss company together (I dropped out when I had to take over the family business... then I promptly gained 80 lbs.!). Now that she is pregnant, however, she's gained quite a bit of weight and she's over 200 lbs. And she still has 5 months to go.  Is it  so bad  to say that, in a way, I'm glad she's gaining? It's not that I want her to be fat, or that I want her to suffer. It's that  I feel as if I can catch up ! When we were losing together, she was always approximately 25 lbs. ahead of me. It was obvious to me (at all times) that she received a certain amount of smug pleasure out of that fact. Whenever I tried to give her weight loss advice, she would say something along the lines of, "Well, when  you  get below XXX lbs., then maybe you'll understand." or "Would you like my size 18s? I can't fit into them anymore." That irritated me to no end! I mean, what is really the difference between 240 lbs. and 215 lbs.???  Anyway, she's about 208 lbs. right now. I'm 288. If I can lose about 40 lbs. before she's due, and she gains about 20 lbs. or so in the next 5 months, then we'll once again be 20-25 lbs. apart. Now, I'm sure she'll be much too involved with her new baby to be concerned about such a trivial thing, and I would expect her to drop the weight as quickly as she gained it, but I must admit...  I long for the day that my weight is lower than hers. I crave it like a fish craves water.     Of course, I'm being quite unreasonable. I mean, come on,  I'm trying to compete with a pregnant lady.  There's no honor in that! But there is most definitely a guilty pleasure. A few weeks ago she asked me for the clothes that I can no longer wear because I've gained so much weight. I can't tell you the horrible, selfish joy I felt in handing those same size 18s that she gave me right back to her.  Actually, she's a wonderful friend and I know that she fears the weight gain. I know that she offered her old clothes to me because it's very difficult to update your wardrobe when your size decreases once per month. I know that her weight loss journey has been long and arduous, and I only wish the best for her - a trim, svelte body and a long, rewarding life.  However, this blog is not about how she feels or what she's going through. It's about my journey, and for the record, I must confess -  if I could see the look on her face the day I'm just one pound lighter than her, it would make all this worthwhile.    Think of me what you will. I'm just a squirrel, trying to get a nut.

						   Weight: 286  Food: Oatmeal Chick-Fil-A Chicken Sandwich Large fry AND medium fry Large diet lemonade Pint of Chocolate Oreo Ice cream  Yep, you read it right, I had fries and ice cream yesterday. Two of my biggest weaknesses! The reason I dropped a pound, however, is because I essentially ate one large meal yesterday, with a 100 calorie breakfast. Sometimes I wonder if the "One Meal a Day" theory is valid in its own way, but I like breakfast, lunch and dinner equally so that's something that wouldn't work for me. I know a lot of men have done well doing that, but I don't care.  Anyway, I want to talk about the Beautiful People. I've mentioned the Beautiful People (BP's) once before, but I wanted to expand on my thoughts about them. Let me first reiterate that I neither despire nor admire the BP's, though I do sometimes find them fascinating to observe. Rather like zebras in the wild. You could care less if a lion eats them or if they live for another millennium, but they're interesting to watch.  I'm a big fan of reality television. I think most people, whether they admit it or not, are fans of  some  type of reality television, whether it's Survivor, Celebrity Poker, Last Comic Standing or Fear Factor. Watching people interact with each other is fascinating.  Remember the first Survivor? It wasn't the world's first reality show, but it IS the show that was responsible for sparking the reality insanity that we experience on television today. There was Fat (and Gay) Richard, Old Rudy, Pretty Colleen, Weird Greg, Single Mom Jenna, Athletic Gervase and other types of people. Out of 16 people, there were maybe 4 BPs - I don't remember anyone being especially spectacular. They had a good Gilligan's Island type of mix - which in its own way, is kind of like the real world.  But notice what we have today. Even the OLD people on Survivor are fairly attractive, and really not even that old. Old Rudy was a leathery ex-military guy, abrasive, but human. But now since so many people from those first years of reality success have made it big, we've got a different type of person auditioning for these shows.  Everyone  who applies to be contestants on the new reality shows are aspiring actors/singers/artists who are currently bartending/secretarying/hairstyling. They even choose the roles they want to play - the Bitch, the Drunk, the Slut, the Cassanova. I'm not so sure if the cash prizes are even the motivation behind the show anymore. They want to make a career out of it these days. The direct result is a disproportionate amount of BPs kidnapping our televisions even for the  reality  shows.  Now, I don't know about you, but I really don't see that many BPs in  my  reality. That's why I was so astounded to see so many when I went to Miami. Maybe the producers of these television shows have lost touch. Don't they all live in LA, New York, Miami and Hollywood? Where almost everyone has bleached/highlighted/frosted hair, abs to die for, and perfect teeth? You know what I mean - the kind of person who has never thought twice about "whether that skimpy bikini is appropiate" or "if I should wear a t-shirt in the pool." If this is  their  reality, then how can they cast a TRUE reality show?  I realized a long time ago that I actually feel lucky not to have been a BP. I'm fairly attractive (more so when my weight is down), and also sociable when I want to be, so I've never had a problem meeting friends and having a life. But I did grow up with a messed up image of myself. As a teenager, I thought the BPs I saw on TV were the  standard  and not the exception, so I had this really low self-image. I was the last one in my group of friends to get kissed (meaning: my first kiss was only because everyone  else  had done it and it sucked!) and the last one to start dating (which I stopped shortly after I started).  But that now irrelevant low self-image actually helped me. The people in my life were genuine. I was rarely approached by a man whose sole motivation was to get in my pants (well, just a couple of times, but it didn't work!). I never had to prove to people that I had inner beauty as well as outer beauty. I remember a few of my cheerleader friends always trying to do well in school so that people didn't think they were dingbats. I felt sorry for them. I, on the other hand, always had people assuming that I was far more intelligent than I actually am, simply because I was average and a bit on the shy side. There were even rumors going around in my old high school that I was secretly wealthy!  I read an article the other day where Halle Berry was asked what it was like to be so beautiful. Paraphrased, she said something along the lines of, "Beauty never did anything for me. It didn't spare me pain or hardship and I still have to work for everything I get. And since it doesn't last, I don't rely on it." I thought that was pretty wise, and taken from a true BP, we should all listen up. She's known as one of the most beautiful people in America, yet as far as life goes, her life has been hardly different from the average woman. She has still had the pain of two divorces, she hasn't found someone with which she can trust to have children with, she still has to work hard to keep the momentum of her career going, and right now, she's alone. I'm not a BP, and I don't even have half those troubles. Who needs it? Life is hard enough for the average ugly person, but contrary to what I used to believe, it can probaby be harder for a BP.  So here we are, people like me, the fattys of the world. Though we typically have genuine friendships, spouses who love us and nice careers, we look at the BPs in the magazines and billboards and visualize ourselves looking like them. But why? I think that generally we set ourselves up to think that when we are that thin, we can do  anything.  We can run on private beaches with a hunk of guy, falling into the surf and kissing him, or we can not only be thin, but also have the perfect makeup, skin, teeth, hair and nose. And strangers on the street will want to take pictures of us or hang out with us or just admire us for our wonderful thin-ness.  What?  There's one thing I realized when I lost 55 lbs. 2 years ago. I kept getting thinner, but  nothing else was changing.  Somehow I had imagined myself with a great body and hair and makeup, when in reality I was just getting thinner. I still had a scar on my forehead, a pockmark on my nose, big feet and leg hair. I kept looking in the mirror and seeing the same person. In fact, the only way I noticed I was losing the weight was I kept putting on pants that there's no way I could fit my big behind into and they would be loose on me. Why? Because I woke up and looked into the same face every day.  I think one of the biggest things I learned that I would like to remind myself of throughout this journey is that when I look in the mirror, I'm not necessarily looking at my body. Not always. Sometimes I'm looking at ME. Through my eyes. My eyes will never change. I think that's why my body perception seemed so skewed when I lost weight before - I felt like I hadn't lost a pound even though my body had completely changed. It was because when I looked in the mirror, I saw me, myself, and not my fat, or my skin or my blemishes.  There were times when I would consciously look at the differences that were happening on the outside, but if it hadn't been for my constant need to buy new clothing, you couldn't have convinced me I had lost a pound!  The question then was, if the person I looked at in the mirror wasn't changing, would it matter if I was thin? Suddenly, thin-ness took on less of a weight and I realized what it really was. Just improvement. That's all. All I'll be at the end of this journey is thinner. I'll look into the same eyes every morning no matter what.  All that "love yourself" mumbo jumbo has never worked for me. I think the simple fact that a person gets up, washes, brushes their teeth and combs their hair in the morning is proof that you love yourself. Getting a pedicure or a new hair style has never made me feel better or motivated me to lose weight. Mostly it just gives me something pretty to look at for a little while.  So now I've lost 6 lbs in approximately 2.5 weeks. I think that's pretty darn good. I think I can clear 10 for this first month. Woohoo! Now, Do I think that makes me valuable? Nope. I think it's just damn cool! Do I think I'm going to be a BP anytime soon? I hope not. The only person I really care to notice my beauty are my future husband and my children. And being fat didn't prevent me from finding the man of my dreams and it certainly didn't keep me from achieving new heights in my career (I'm making the highest salary I've ever made at my new job that I start 1.5 weeks). It didn't keep me from going on a cruise last month, or wearing a bathing suit in public. My weight actually hasn't kept me from doing anything.  However, my life is about making improvements spiritually, mentally and physically. The simple fact that  I don't like  my weight is enough reason for me to want to change it. And now that I've dropped those first few lbs., I want to keep up the momentum.  Life is good right now. My debt is minimal, my weight is diminishing, my marriage is looming and my career is thriving. Who could ask for anything more?

						   Weight: 287  Yesterday's food was basically one large slice of pizza and then some fish, rice and olives later in the day. I don't drink hardly anything besides water, by the way. Not worth it.  Anyway, remember that debt that I mentioned yesterday that was weighing on me? Well, let me tell you, prayer CHANGES things! My mom has agreed to take care of it! It's really a miracle - my mom is extremely tight with money. I know that she will get it back ten times over, but she may not be able to see that right now. The last two years have been tough times for my family, but we'll overcome all of it, I know.  Now that I'm moving back to Atlanta it's like I'm being given a second chance. A second chance at weight loss (last time I was there, I lost 55 lbs, from 263 to 208!), a second chance at giving back to the community, and a second chance of proving myself. I think living here in Tennessee was like a training ground. God had to get me in a place where I couldn't look left or right, but just up. And I am hardheaded and stubborn so that's no easy task!  So now I can focus on my career, my marriage next year, and my spiritual growth. I think that when life falls into place just so, the weight comes off easier. I'm at 287 today, so I've officially lost 5 lbs in 2.5 weeks! Woohoo! I'll take it! It would be really nice if I could shed at least 1 or 2 more by Sunday.  I ate the last of my food in the fridge last night, so back to the grocery store for me today! (This time I won't avoid it for a week! hehe)

						   I got the job! I'm moving to Atlanta in TWO WEEKS! I'm so excited!  Yesterday was a bad day - I found out I'm being sued for $25,000 because the old business credit cards were in my name and there's no money to pay them. I'm a christian so this type of stuff doesn't worry me (when eternity is involved, this is definitely small potatoes), but it was quite a stressful experience!  Finding out I got that job today really cheered me up. No more depressing unemployment checks! No more wondering where my next step will be! No more small town angst from a girl that was made for the Big City!  As far as this blog is concerned, I guess I can just say that weight does NOT keep me from achieving my dreams. Weight is nothing - it's time for this to GO.

						    urlLink    This is me on my cruise to the Bahamas in July 2004. In all my 290 lb. glory. I'm still cute, but check out that huge head and those arms! Well, at least you didn't get a view of my behind.... you'd be blind by now. hehe  Actually, I don't think this pic is so bad, besides the fact that it's blurry and not very clear. I'll try posting another one that comes out nicer later. It took me a half hour just to get this one up on blogger so for now I will just admire my effort.   urlLink

						   Today is the beginning of Week 3. As promised, my blogger headings aren't going to be based on the week or day anymore. Mostly because by the time I get to like, Week 50, it's going to seem like a helluva long time.  I weighed in today at  288 !  So in reality I lost 5 lbs. since last week, but really 4 lbs. since I started the whole thing. YES! I'm going to make Sundays my "free" day. I will still watch my food, but I won't record it. Just so you have an example, today I ate an appetizer and a chicken sandwich + fries with a mimosa at O'Charleys, and I'll probably have some ice cream later tonight. So it's not so bad, but I just need one day of freedom, and since Sunday is my "day of rest" it seems the perfect lazy day to do it! I guess you will see the results of it on Monday's weigh-in.  I don't have any poignant stories to tell today. Maybe I'll look to other people's bloggers for inspiration, like journal de jude's (see Links, on the left). Ciao!

						   Weight: 289  Food: Oatmeal w/ tsp of Brummel & Brown Shrimp, Spinach, Mushroom and Rice concoction Orange Fish and Rice Another Orange  Lazy Saturday here. I'm proud of myself - I had a hankering for some fast food today, but instead I just went to Google and typed in what I had in the fridge (shrimp and spinach) and found a recipe to make something with it! It turned out terribly - too much lemon juice in the recipe - but you can never go  too  wrong with shrimp.  Tomorrow is my weekly weigh-in. Hopefully, I can maintain the 3 lb. loss for the week OR shed another pound or so. But I ate like a pound of that shrimp, so who knows? We'll see.  I can't believe I'm eating normally and losing weight. It's not that much (yet), but I'm thankful for every little bit I get. Sometimes I'm tempted to starve myself but then I decide against it, and it makes things SO much better. Lesson #1: It's much easier to eat well when you're not STARVING!

						   Sorry, had to combine two days here! Stats for the last two days:  August 5  Food: Baked potato w salt, pepper, Brummel & Brown spread Baked fish with diced tomatoes, peppers, olives and lemon Basmati Rice SIX "Lite" White Chocolate Almond Bars (yep, that says 6!)  August 6  Weight: 289  Food: Sushi Same fish as above Basmati Rice The other six White Chocolate Almond Bars  Well, I'm living proof that you don't have to starve yourself to lose weight! I've lost a grand total of 3 lbs. so far and it's been just under two weeks. The first week was horrible, I'll admit, but this week all I've really done is cut out the junk. I pretty much just told myself that I won't eat anything out - I'll cook everything. I achieved that for the most part - I was in Atlanta and HAD to stop by my favorite sushi restaurant on Wednesday and today. Nothing abnormal about that.  I'll let you in on a secret. That visualization stuff works. I've ALWAYS seen it as such a crock. Visualizing myself thin made me want to eat, just like everything else I couldn't instantly have. But I've been using it differently lately and it's highly effective. Whenever I tell myself no to food, it's very easy to accomplish. I just imagine the undesirable food as my own fat. As if, someone came and liposuctioned the fat rom my gut and slapped it in an ice cream cone, and I'm supposed to lick it. I don't know about you, but that makes me squeamish.  This week I've visualized yellow fat McDonald's hamburgers on a thick, white fat bun, globs of cellulite in a Bruster's waffle cone, and breaded, fried fat on a Chick-Fil-A biscuit. It was really horrible. I actually made myself ill a couple of times - I have an insane imagination. Now that I've put it to use "for the cause," I think I'll keep it up. I think the clencher is that with each gross food I crave, I imagine exactly where the fat on my body came from that I visualize. And whenever I think of my huge behind, that always sends me over the top. Gross.  I'm glad I've lost a few real pounds - that jump to 288 from last week was totally fake. It was totally because I starved myself the first day like an idiot. I'm losing weight even better by eating as much as I want right now. I may ACTUALLY prove that a fatty can lose a massive amount of weight in a healthy way AND a short period of time before this is all over. That's the goal anyway, right?  Today I completed my second interview down in Atlanta. I find out if I got the job on Monday. Wish me luck!!!

						   Weight: 291  Food: Banana Sushi Miso Soup 2 pieces fish Basmati rice FF Italian Ice Big Bowl of Grapes  I'm still eating quite well - it's a real shocker, huh! I guess I just had to get through Hell Week, and then I start doing fine for myself. My weight finally reflected my little tiny changes. In the morning, I'm going to go walking again with a friend. It's probably going to kill me - my legs are so sore from yesterday!  I got a 40-hour contract job today that will probably spread over a couple of weeks. Thank goodness - takes some of the edge off unemployment which REALLY SUCKS. I seriously need some dinero and quick!  Not much to say today. Lots of work to do.  Thanks Jennifer for your comments on my previous posts! I've been trying to post replies to them but for some reason my board won't let ME post comments. Weird. Anyway, you guys can feel free to email me too at  urlLink evian321@hotmail.com .

						   I think I'm going to start changing the titles to my post to be more interesting. Maybe on Sunday - the first two weeks are my intro phase.  Weight: 293 (still? grrr!)  Exercise: 35 minutes, walking (wow!)  Food: Lemon/Strawberry Smoothie 3 lowfat egg rolls Grapes 3 pieces fish, 2 servings rice Fat free Italian Ice  Today was the first day in a while that I went to intentionally exercise. Woohoo! Believe it or not, I love exercising. I am a really active person and always have been, overweight or not. I like kickboxing, bicycling, aerobics, dancing, and pretty much any other activity there is to be done out there. I went hiking on some trail I've never been on. I brought my bicycle too, but after hiking the trail I realized I need to get in significantly better shape to continue.  I had an interview today. I also got a second invitation for that interview that I mentioned the other day. Wow, I guess they really DID see my qualifications instead of my fat. One more interview and we'll see the results. First interviews are never a problem for me, but the second interviews are nervewracking because then you can start TASTING the job. I've put much more time and research into it to prepare (I'm meeting the CEO) and I really want it. I think I will imagine that I already have the position, and just go in there and claim it.  I'm in marketing, so jobs are really cutthroat right now. But I'm particularly interested in getting this position because I have a wedding to pay for in April, I have to travel overseas in January, and a vacation in October. I need to WORK. Mostly to save up money, but also to keep my mind off of it. My fiance is long distance so I don't like to have so much time on my hands - I get obsessed with thoughts of him.  I had an interview for another job today, too, but they are not sure if it's even solid yet. Bleh. We'll see about that.  Now, let's just hope the CEO sees why I am the best candidate for the position! And not just the largest.

						   Weight: 293 (Ack!)  Food: 3 LF Egg Rolls (baked, not fried) 2 packets Duck Sauce Bowl of grapes Baked Lemon Pepper fish Baked potato FF Italian Ice  Great news! First of all, today was my BEST FOOD DAY SO FAR. I'm very excited about this. I guess when you actually buy food you like and keep it at home it's not so tempting to stop at Arby's or Wendy's or McDonald's or...well, you get what I mean.  Yeah, but what's messed up about today is that I weighed in at my HIGHEST WEIGHT EVER. Yep, I've never ever seen the numbers 2.9.3. on my scale until today. Just lovely.  I got a random appointment for another job interview today. In the same industry I'm trying desperately to get out of. I'll go, but I'll probably just end up recommending one of my former employees. You know, I guess I should count my blessings with this whole job interview thing. I mean, I may be large, but I'm not a slob. And I live in the deep south, where there's a lot of fattys. People don't look at me and say, "She's fat." They look at me and say, "She's fatter than me." Southerners eat more than any single group of people on earth, I'm sure of it.  It could be worse... I could live in L.A. or New York or Miami, land of the Beautiful People. I would never even get an interview there. I went to Miami last month before my vacation to the Bahamas. I was astounded at how many Beautiful People live there! They're all tan and thin or muscular and model-like. I could have spent my entire vacation there just staring at people. I went to South Beach and I felt like a whale in a fish bowl. It was still fun, though.  Sometimes though, the Beautiful People seem confused to me. I saw this one promotional girl, she was naturally gorgeous, but she was wearing leopard print pants that showed the crack of her ass, a halter top and so much makeup you could have raked it off with a serving spoon. Why do the BPs do this? There are times when I see a pretty woman wearing an outrageous outfit, like a catsuit or a miniskirt, and I think, "Work it girl! If you got it, flaunt it!" But for this girl, I wanted to say, "You need to fix whatever part of your mind that told you that outfit looked good."  Anyway, I now understand why Will Smith had to write a song about Miami. I look forward to going back there!

						   Weight: 292, 290, 291  Food: 3 oz. ham Collard greens Rice Black Beans Fresh corn Kool-aid (Sunday Dinner at my sister's)  I actually did very well on food today - I just had one spoonful of each, I didn't overeat anything, and that's difficult for "soul food" meals. I wanted to start August off right.  If you're wondering about the weigh-in, I put all those numbers up there because occasionally my scale does that. I weighed once, then again, then again, and all three of those numbers came up. I didn't want to choose one, so I chose all 3. I think that just sort of happens when you're this large. My scale is confused... "Heavy load! Tell her anything, just get her the heck off me!"  Anyway, as I lose weight that will happen less and less. And yes, I do plan to lose weight.
