      Well I just woke up abour 10 minutes ago and it's 1:30 in the afternoon. I didn't get to sleep until around 7 this morning because I had so much on my mind. The first thing I did was call Charlotte, but no answer. She almost always answers her phone, but this time I got her voicemail. Let me sign online to see if she's on....she is...now I'm really wondering why she didn't answer her phone.  As I talk to her, I can't help but feel I've done something horribly wrong, which she says isn't the case. Everything is weird between us and I don't know why. I think I'll cut this entry short though, as I don't want to say anything or jump to any conclusions.

      Tonight was an awkward night. I was talking to Charlotte for a little bit and since there were storms in the area my phone kept cutting out. So I decided to talk to her online. Shortly after signing on, my ex Sharyn signed on and things just got weird. Now, as Charlotte knows, Sharyn and I were still really good friends and I even told her that I would be meeting up with her in California(that's where Sharyn lives) when I went out there. Things in our friendship have been on the decline for months now and I didn't expect anything to come of the visit with Sharyn. Well come to find out, we didn't even meet when I was in Cali..because of her. That was the straw that broke the camel's back and I was pissed about the whole situation. I haven't talked to Sharyn since then and that was about a month and a half ago. There were just a few things I had to talk about with her and there were things I had to let her know. All the while, it was like 3:30AM and I wasn't really saying much to Charlotte. I feel bad about it but I just needed to talk to Sharyn and get some things off of my chest...not just about my trip to California but about our friendship...about alot of things. Not only do I feel bad about not talking to Charlotte but I also was pretty harsh with some of my words while talking to Sharyn. Here is just a little bit of the conversation just to get a feel what it was like:    Rottin Apple 7 (3:21:21 AM): so what then? where do we go from here? do we just go our separate ways? Sharynd (3:21:36 AM): No Sharynd (3:21:38 AM): I dont nkow Rottin Apple 7 (3:21:47 AM): what do you know? Sharynd (3:22:18 AM): Nothing apparently Sharynd (3:22:26 AM): Well I dont know what I should say Sharynd (3:22:32 AM): Or what I can do to make this better Rottin Apple 7 (3:22:37 AM): just be honest with me Rottin Apple 7 (3:23:17 AM): we used to be able to tell each other everything....now its like you cant tell me anything Sharynd (3:23:44 AM): I know Sharynd (3:23:48 AM): Well what do you want to know Sharynd (3:23:52 AM): Ask me whatever you want Sharynd (3:23:55 AM): Maybe that's easiest Rottin Apple 7 (3:24:21 AM): to tell you the truth....theres nothing i really want to ask you right now... Rottin Apple 7 (3:24:45 AM): were not gonna play catchup at 3:30 in the morning Sharynd (3:25:06 AM): ...yeah Rottin Apple 7 (3:25:46 AM): im sorry to say sharyn but this friendship isnt exactly rewarding to me anymore... Sharynd (3:26:19 AM): So what are you saying? You dont want to talk anymore? Rottin Apple 7 (3:26:34 AM): not if you cant respect me enough to talk about things    So anyways, I told her what I needed to: that I've moved on and that there's no room in my life for people who are going to treat me the way she does. Oddly enough we then proceeded to talk about our lives, our familes and friends. It seemed like one of those conversations you have with friends you really don't know that well anymore.  'How are you? How's the family? ' It's true though...I don't know her that well anymore. Well, I left it at ' ill talk to you another time'  As far as that goes...we'll see what happens with that. I really hope Charlotte isn't too mad at me.

      It's Final! Charlotte is coming up in October and I couldn't be happier. I mean, we've talked about her coming up during Columbus Day weekend but now it's official. I know this because I bought her ticket today and sealed the deal. Now she HAS to come up and see me and I have something to look forward to. I can't wait for her to meet my family and friends and come see where I live. It's going to be so great to show her around and at night I'll be nice and comfortable holding her in my arms...falling asleep and waking up to her. Sure it will only be for about 5 days but I'm going to make the best of what short time we have. I'm not going to want to let her leave. The countdown...a little less than 2 months until we're together again. It will be glorious! I'm going to make a list of the things we can do together while she's in town. She's right though...it doesn't matter what we end up doing those 5 days...just as as long as we're together. It will be interesting though to see what she thinks of New England, the place that I call home.

      Something that I wrote recently. I feel a little uncomfortable posting it but here it is...   Charlotte Rose  I sat and watched you write Ignoring the TV in the background Deep in concentration, you looked so sweet Writing one of many letters that I will treasure forever Wondering if this would be the last time That I would see this look on your face  Heartache fell from your eyes and on to my chest Where it collected so heavily Ten o’ clock came so quickly I wasn’t ready to let you go We tried not to rest our eyes Though they were swollen with tears  With my chest as your pillow Your head followed the rhythm of my every breath I whispered your name, though I knew you were asleep With a kiss on the forehead, I closed my eyes Knowing at least tonight, this heart won’t be beating alone

      On Saturday morning 8/14 my best friend Billy's girlfriend gave birth to a 7 lb 0 oz baby named Nathan Robert. I have to admit that I was a little worried for the both of them. She just lost her job recently and Billy's been working two jobs for so long now. At first I thought it was the craziest idea in the world that they would be bringing another life into this world, for many reasons. One reason being the two of them aren't together, and another reason being that it didn't seem to me that Billy was ready to be a father. Well...after a trip to the hospital on Saturday night and seeing the look on both of their faces at the sight of their firstborn child, that all changed for me. I saw a look on Billy's face Saturday night I hadn't seen in all the 7 years I've known him. Looking at the three of them together in that hospital room I wasn't worried. I know that that child will be well taken care of and I am so happy for the both of them. I wish them the best of luck because I know these first few years are going to be the hardest for them. And I have to say, it still feels weird thinking of my best friend as a father, but in time I'll get used to it. Until then I'll just enjoy watching Nathan grow up and look forward to the day I'll be able to do the same with my children.

      Today was a lazy day. I didn't do much but sit in front of the television. Well, I did get out for a little bit. I was watching some of the dream team game against Puerto Rico and decided I needed to get out of the house seeing how I didn't want to watch the rest of the game, as they were losing by 20. I don't know what the final score was but I know they got their asses handed to them. So I went and bought a few dvd's at blockbuster, one of them being Fear.com. What a waste of money! After watching that, Charlotte called and I was a little distracted (I must admit) as girls gymnastics was on. Man are those girls flexible! Um...anyways.....I'm still felling a little weird about having a blog. I feel like the word 'blog' is interchangeable with the word 'diary.' And aren't diaries something girls keep? I don't know...I guess it doesn't matter cuz I know there's only one person reading this. (I Love You Momma!) I think starting with my next entry I will start posting some of my writing...'we'll see what happens...'
