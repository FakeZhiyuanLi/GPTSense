       Hard Ice And Soft Bottoms a.k.a. Ice Skating for Dummies  Two days back, on Saturday night I went ice-skating with a few friends of mine. When I reached there and saw the rink (yes that is&nbsp;what a skating arena is called)&nbsp;I was immediately in awe of all that ice, white and gleaming in the bright lights, it really was&nbsp;quite a sight. Considering that the most ice&nbsp;I had ever seen in my life before this, was in the freezer in our ancient refrigerator when it was being defrosted, it was quite an awesome sight. We rented the skating shoes and decided to go boldly forth where most of us had never been. Once i got onto the ice I realized that the surface was in fact "slippery as ice" and landed on my soft spot almost immediately but soon realized that my posterior wasn't as soft as I thought it was and was reminded of the saying "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."&nbsp;Anyway I made several brave attempts to skate, or should I say not fall down. But each time I tried to recover my balance I fell pat on my bottom. Finally I did manage to stand up straight and received numerous lessons from all and sundry advising me to stay low, bend forward and push with the back leg most of which I still can't make sense of. When I told some of the kids that I had never skated before, not even on roller blades, they were quite astonished to say the least. And another kid whom I told that we don’t usually encounter snow in India in the place I live, he in a very matter-of-fact manner asked me "So if you drink Coca-Cola don't you put ice in it?”&nbsp; Trying to join the skaters going around the rink was a formidable task and greatly reminded me of merging onto the Inter-State highway from a by lane while 18-wheelers hurtled down the road. By the end of our allotted time I pretty much learnt to stand up straight on my own two feet (literally) and move 6 inches from my initial position without any help, before I would start going around in circles. I walked away from the rink, my respect for ice skaters and hockey players greatly increased and a few important lessons learnt. Firstly, one must always wear plenty of clothing to protect&nbsp;one's behind and secondly or rather more importantly wear dark colored trousers so that one’s wet behind isn't as conspicuous in the lighting and therefore a matter of amusement to the more accomplished 10 year old skaters in the rink. Well I guess this post hasn't been of much help to anyone with regard to learning the art of ice skating but at least you now know how not to look extremely stupid skating for the first time. I say extremely because no matter what you do you will look stupid every time you fall down. Next week's session-Paintball.

       Wandering and Wondering  I&nbsp;am done with my thesis defense and now have quite a bit of spare time on my hands. This abundance of emptiness in my daily schedule has prompted me to surf the web for odd, unusual and hopefully interesting pieces of information. The following websites served to satiate my appetite for the same. Firstly this is something I came across on another blog the name of which I forget. Google has put up a disclaimer apologizing for its search results for the search term " urlLink Jew ". On further investigation I found out that this was probably because the first result on earlier Google searches for the said term was a site called  urlLink www.Jewwatch.com  which is an anti-Semitic website. This kind of took me by surprise, since Google which in most people's opinion is as objective as anything they have ever known had to hand out official disclaimers for the misplaced efficiency of it's algorithm. Just goes to show that there&nbsp;are more things you can put up on your website&nbsp;than accurate information to get to the top of Google results. The second piece of interesting fun information I found was that the  urlLink world's longest palindrome  contains 17,259 words or if you are really into numbers, 72,046 letters. The creator goes on to say that the sentence does not really make sense, as it is a somewhat random collection of words separated mostly by commas. And I thought, "Sums are not set as a test on Erasmus" didn’t make sense.

       The Case Against The Misplaced Apostrophe   I was surfing through the various communities on Orkut and came across one entitled "Down With Apostrophe Abus'e". That led me to reviews of Lynn Truss's book Eats, Shoots and Leaves. The cover of the book is interesting. It has a panda on a ladder trying to wipe out the comma between Eats and Shoots. You will be able to appreciate it if you know the joke. The joke is&nbsp;reproduced in this  urlLink article , besides having listing some hilarious instances of misplaced punctuation marks.&nbsp;It is kind of interesting that even in this age of&nbsp;shorter and efficient communiques where most people spell 'through' as 'thru' and 'photo' as 'foto', myself included there&nbsp;are still some&nbsp;people&nbsp; trying to keep English together as a language rather than a rag tag bunch of phonetically spelt words.

       Bus(h) Aur Nahin...  I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and I liked the movie for its slick styling.&nbsp;I have realized that it might be a little too late in the day to write a review now so instead I am writing my thoughts. First of all, the movie made me angry, very angry. The president has consistently proven himself to be quite a showstopper with his dim-witted remarks on issues ranging from his golf game to the war in Iraq not to mention his picture perfect expressions when he is flummoxed by the questions posed by journalists in the movie. But to be completely fair to W, Michael Moore has chosen moments, which showcase the president at his worst or are totally out of context. Besides&nbsp;there is no doubt in my mind that the movie is completely biased. Like for example when Moore narrates that "…decided to invade the sovereign nation of Iraq that has never harmed an American...". But some of the more poignant moments for me in the movie were the sound bites offered by the troops where they put it quite matter of factly that "…its all about the rush". All in all I would be quite surprised if the movie did not have an impact on the educated urban voters who want the election to be decided based on issues closer to home like the bad economy and are loathe to giving a president who dragged the country into two wars a second chance at running the country.

       I, We, Orkut  Well it has begun. I am finally getting wired into the Orkut community. Today Vikram Sampath added me on to his Orkut network list and now I am proud to say that I am wired to 900118 people of whom I actually know, maybe&nbsp;47. That should say something about the ubiquity of the internet and the anonymity afforded by it. (I could have used simpler words in the previous sentence but where is the fun in that.)

       Legitimizing Orkut    Today I finally joined Orkut on a third invitation from Gubbala. Its not that I have been putting it off(well yes, I have) but its just that I did not want to explore another channel which would force me to keep in touch with people whose mails I am too lazy to respond or have&nbsp;nothing in&nbsp;common with to return their phonecalls. But I did join it anyway. Tried orkutting(googling just does not sound right over here) some of the BITS Pilani communities and was surprised to find just that just about any one i know was already anorkutter (do you sense a pattern here?). The good part about orkut i guess is that people don't find it intimidating so I guess just about everyone I know(read girls) have posted their pictures My guess is that since orkut is a google product people instantly assume their info will not b tampered with. But I know atleast 23 people who will be very interested to know that photographs of certain girls from my batch are online even though they have managed to keep their yahoo ids a secret or made sure all their online photos are private so none of the gults in my batch can access them. Well anyway I shall continue on my journey through the webpages of orkut to find out more long lost friends and acquaintance and photograph of the hot chicks of batches past and future and post my thoughts if I think they will provoke any thoughts from anyone who bothers to visit my site.

       Stealing and Swapping  I was just trying to figure out how I can get more people to read my blog and I came across  urlLink this article  , one more example of how people get away with stealing. The article suggests that the more popular blogs on the internet aren’t necessarily the most original. This is not to say that I am against any of those file-sharing networks, but I guess I can now feel the pain (or is it concern over lost profits) expressed by the media giants over the widespread sharing of relatively new material. There has to be a common ground for the users and the big business so that we can all just get along with each other. Along similar lines of thinking the  urlLink following article  makes sense. Apple has sold its 100 millionth song over the internet suggesting that there might be sound business sense in jumping onto the bandwagon rather than trying to stop it. Maybe cheaper access and better quality might be what the recording industry should look at. Plus tell me if a rapper has a name like 50 Cent is he really worth a million dollar recording contract. Think about it.

        Its always news unless...  you know it already. At that point the news becomes a bargaining chip so that you can find out more gossip about all the people who don’t really matter in your life. Anyways this thought just occurred to me. I was chatting with an old friend and he was interested in the happenings at my university. Now since he did not know any of the characters in my story, I decided to spice up things, define the things that should make them interesting and told him one hell of a story which by the way was true for the most part. Anyways my friend was really pleased and filled me up with some news on someone else I knew, which I shall now spread with great glee to anyone who is willing to listen. Anyways the one important rule of gossip mongering, to quote what I read this morning on a website is “The truth never gets in the way of a good story”. How true!

       I dont get it-A big FAT thought  I have decided to write a column called "I dont get it". Through this column I will share my pet peeves and the annoying little things that bother me with anyone who is willing to read my blog. So here is the first and in an ironic tone hopefully one of the very few topics that I will discuss in this column. I was watching television the other day and came across the new ads for Pepsi Edge and Coke C2, new entrants in the food and drink industry's race to capture mega bucks and pander to the low carb craze sweeping across the United States. That got me thinking. Whatever happened to all those products which touted the benefits of reducing the fat in your food? I dont see them around anywhere. In the supermarkets I can never find a low fat salad dressing but if I ever wanted a low-carb creation presto!! Fast food chains, coffee shops even ice cream makers are out to rid you of the carbs in your food. What am I going to say at Mc Donalds now. "Oh you can fry the potatoes all you want. Just make sure the potatoes are low carb!!". I dont get it. I just dont.

      I saw The Huricane recently. It was a good movie but the greatest thinsg that teh movie has accomplished in me is raise my interest in Bob Dylan and made me search the net for the lyrics of  urlLink The Revolution Will Not Be Televised . It was so impressive that I put a spin on it and put in in the description of my blog. Another Denzel Washington movie that made me want to scour the net for a song's lyrics was Fallen which made me want to search the lyrics for  urlLink Sympathy for the Devil  by Rolling Stones. Its funny how you dont start to notice something unless it either stares you in the face like The Revolution.. does during the fight sequence or like Sympathy.. which plays when the final credits are being read out.

      Well my blog was originally titled "Support Group for Vexed Graduate Students". But now I have realised that there isn't really much that I can do to offer vexed graduate students support. So I have decided to change the title. However I shall alway be empathetic to the cause of graduate student economics. Especially as an Indian student I have always been amazed at our ability to ammortize the rent of just about any apartment no matter what the cost by making sure you can find anywhere between 3 to 8 roomates for a two bedroom apartment depending on whether you stay in Louisana or in Los Angeles.

      Long long ago once upon a time not exactly in Mexico but somewhere to the north of it in a country called the United States of America, there was a state called Louisiana. Now in Louisiana close to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico there was a big parish called Lafayette. In Lafayette, a place named after the Frenchman who designed the national flag of France, is the University of Louisiana, Lafayette Campus. On campus is a building called Madison Hall which houses the School of Engineering. The Department of Chemical Engineering is located over here. And on the second floor in Room 214 on a computer codenamed CHEEDW2K18 I wrote my first blog. Well, in case you are wondering if this grand opening is for this blog you are wrong. It was a small non-impressive bl of a blog. But I have grander dreams now. I want to write a blog that wont end all blogs or for that matter make blogging an international pastime. I just want to blog for blogging's sake. Just about everyone I know has a website. Hell, I myself am listed on several of them. I tried creating a website several times but to tell you the truth my laziness and my impatience not to mention my lack of web designing (this one I just use as an excuse)have almost always got the better of me, but not today. As meaning less as this blog intends to be I will complete it. Well actually now that I have said taht I will complete it I can frankly think of no otehr things to write about. Well ponder on this. We type "Tell me I am listening to you" when we chat via an Instant Messenger application. How come nobody ever says "Type your feelings out onto the screen of your computer, I am reading it".

       Unemployment Hurts and So Does Paintball      I finally submitted the final copies of my thesis for printing to the Graduate School but not before some drama from the Dean who wanted me to change the title so that it is more 'accurate' than 'descriptive'. The same day I also collected my last paycheck that the University of Louisiana at Lafayette would probably issue me unless I acquire a PhD degree and come back to the school to teach. That means that I am officially unemployed and part of a growing workforce in this country most of whom don't know how to react to the larger issues at hand such as the economic policy, outsourcing and debate over the hike in minimum wage.             The next day (i.e. yesterday) I went to experience paintball. I have seen the sport on several TV shows but did not really know what to expect. They give you these guns with paint pellets, which explode on contact and cover you with yellow paint. So much for Michael Moore's message for gun control in "Bowling for Columine". I played just about every scenario available, namely "Elimination", "Castle Capture" and "The City" and as you can imagine, I was eliminated quickly in just about every scenario. The elimination however was quite painful, as the pellets that struck me didn't really explode and bruised me considerably. It was in that moment of inner retrospect that I came up with the title for this blog. However this is not the end of my experiments with odd American pastimes. The next thing on my list is go-karting but I guess it will take sometime before that one materializes.
