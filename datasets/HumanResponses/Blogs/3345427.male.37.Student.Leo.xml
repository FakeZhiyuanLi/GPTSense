      As I sit in my nightly garden of thought, this came across earlier tonight. You see Spring has finally come to Montreal. It has been Winter for so long. Months and Months of darkness and cold. Moving to an area that experiences the 4 seasons of Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall was one of the best things I have ever done. You see in Miami the only two seasons you get is WET and Wetter.   So I mused this evening as I sat with my hubby eating Chinese food in the Food Court below the Paramount theatre before seeing VanHelsing.   When I moved here in April of 2002, there was snow on the ground. And for the first time since I was a small boy, I experienced a real seasonal change. That would be the last "Snow event" for the 2001-2002 Winter season. So I moved into Summer with all its heat and humidity like Florida. When Wintter came again, in 2002 I had been dating my boyfriend Peter for a couple of months. One night I was on my way back to my apartment it was a night unlike any other night. As I walked down Verdun Avenue to my apartment it started snowing. It was just me the falling snow and the silence. I had come to respect and admire the silence for she had a way of her own. She is soft and hard in the same breath. She is calm and quiet in one breath and crazy and loud in the next. But in the end when Winter comes she brings a hush to every day life. Everything gets muted and everything gets quiet.   When you walk down the street after a good snow fall all you hear is silence. When the Winter comes you lock down the Windows and everything inside your home gets quiet. The world gets shut out of the days and nights, silence comes and I love that silence. It took some time to get used to the silence. Not many people can be at peace and comfortable in their silence. I for one learned how. Silence is that place I can go at any time, like strolling through the halls of a monastery at OCA during a silent retreat, or the silence that greets you at the door of most Cathedrals and churches here in Montreal. I love the silence. I love to walk with her, when she greets us each Winter. And I am sad when she leaves.   For now the world has awoken, Montreal is out in force. Cabin fever came on strong this past Winter. She was brutal, dark and long. She haunted and teased us for months with the never knowing if she would drop another foot of snow on us at any given time. Most people here say I wil loutgrow this the longer I live here, but we will see.   When we bid goodbye to her this April, the city of Montreal starting coming out of their stupors, out of their self imposed hibernation. We took the plastic off the windows and for the first time we breathed in fresh air from the outside. The first night we slept with the windows open, I had a hard time with all the NOISE!!! God it was so noisy outside. i wish it were quieter in here, I can't sleep with all that noise. For God sakes will all you drunks, whores and night owls go to bed already!!! That's what you get for living on Cabot Square in Downtown Montreal.   The SILENCE was gone. And I mourned her leaving for about a week. I am used to the noise again, for it will be with us until She returns to us and once again. When the Winter comes again, I will celebrate her and her silnce that she brings.   For now, My Ode to Silence goes on every day. i have to seek the silence whereever I might be able to. Like in the space of a church, or in the whispering of the trees up on the Mountain or out in the mountains where the only noise you hear is the voice of silence blowing through the trees on a windy day.   Life goes on, do you take the silence for granted, or do you know her? Now with the noise of the world in full force, you cannot hear her can you? You must seek the silence in between all the noise of life, lest you go crazy in the business of the day.   Good night from Montreal.  Jeremy

      Hi, this is my first entry after getting "inspired" by my friend JJ. So yeah I'm an Oprah Kind of Guy. Love her and can't get enough of her. Many years ago after 9-11, I worked on her Oprah's Live Message Board, and I began to write. So, many years later I've learned many things and seen some wonderful places. I moved to Montreal from Miami after 34 years of living in the Sunshine State. But ya know, I never went to the beach. And I lived on the beach. WHO KNEW??? So Now I'm a Canadian, Living in Montreal.   I am 2 years and 5 months Clean and Sober for the second time in my life, and I am also HIV positive now 12 years...WHOA WHO KNEW ??? I am a test pig for Doctors at the Montreal General Hospital, and I am in TIP TOP Shape. I've never felt better in my life.   You see I pulled a geographic at 4 months sober to a foreign country no less, I got my citizenship cause my mother is Canadian, so I claimed birthright, EH? I worked at maintaining sobriety. I met my partner in a "meeting" and we've been together ever since that day. We are going to be married this Fall. In the Spring of 2003, my aftercare counselor asked me one day, "Jeremy, you've climbed a tall mountain, NOW what are you going to do for YOU?" So after some thought, I decided to go back to University after a 16 year hiatus, at age 36. You see I lived, so while the getting is good, why not? I have it all today and I do not complain.   In April of 2004 I completed my first year at Concordia University Majoring in Religion. and I could not be more amazed at how I accomplished this last year, I still don't know. I lived every day as it came, never expecting anything, just walked my path, one foot in front of the other. And Here I am.   You see writing every day is good. you see me for who I am. Honest, vulnerable, happy or sad, and sometimes downright INSANE. I've been writing every day since Oprah got me started when the GET REAL challenge began in the fall of 2001.   I was a drunk, living a miserable life in Miami Beach, but every day I watched Oprah, and one day she spoke to me. I was still drinking after 9-11, but over a few months and divine intervention Oprah helped me get sober. That day was December 9th 2001. The day I picked up that "white chip." I've written her before, alas, no "Oprah Moment" for me YET !!!! I have hope ya know.   So this journal will adress the many things goig on in my life, and I will seek answers to questions that i may have at the time i write. I will share some anecdotes along the way and yes, I may get upset at times too eh? but that's the nature of staying clean and sober. enjoy...   peace Jeremy

      Hello, Here's one for Stevie ...   You know I was born in the United States, I was raised and educated there. You see I am in a very uncomfortable with where I sit in the grand sceme of things. I don't know where I "fit in." As an American child - young person - Young adult - we are taught that The United States is the Superpower in the world. That we have the "right ideas" about life, politics, the art of war, and we treat everyone with the utmost dignity and respect. I mean The Statue of Liberty and her huddled masses speech is something that immigrants saw, as they entered New York Harbor.   I was raised and taught to love my country and defend her flag, to stand for democracy and vote my conscience. I was taught that "we" had it best and that the rest of the world was "less than" or "uneducated." and not "Westernized."   I came to Canada to find my roots and explore the rest of my life. To live a better life and to do things I was "unable" to do living in Miami. That was 2 years ago. I have explored my religious roots. I have found family that I never knew I had. I got sober in this city and I stayed clean as well. I grew up in many ways I thought I would never see in my life. I have seen things happen for gays and lesbians here in Canada that I thought I would never see. I have see "History" made in my little pathetic lifetime.   Last year I began the most ambitious project of my life, this comes second to my survival living with "HIV/AIDS." I went back to University. I was so afraid of my own shadow, and for the first semester I walked around campus like a child in a world full of adults. I did not know what to do first. It was with great appreciation that several of my professors became my mentors and helped me re-integrate into the world of education. They encouraged me to just try one day at a time, and like staying sober I had learned how to stay in my day.   A year of University came and went. I do not know how I did it, all I know is this. I have done it. The first day of orientation the rector of Concordia University came and spoke to the thousand students that were there that day and he said this, it is important to WHY I am writing this post.   [B]" We here at Concordia are educators and teachers. The One thing I want to impress upon you today is this: That when you leave Concordia, we hope that you will have learned something and that when you do graduate that your minds and hearts will be changed and that you will leave us differently than how you are sitting in those chairs out there. [/B]   That stuck in my head every day that I went to class.   I did learn a few things over the last year, but most of all I began to see things differently and I learn something new about myself every day. A couple of weeks ago I began Summer Term classes. I am taking Biblical History and Introduction to Islam along with Frech 201. Now I am not going to bring up topics that alot of us are tired of but I do need to say a few things.   As an American raised in the U.S. we saw over history that when the U.S. goes to war, well, we do things all the way or not at all. Even IF they are wrong or politically not the "right" thing to do. There is an ethic that is supposed to be followed. But as they have said "War is hell." This is NOT a war thread so please keep reading. Stay with me please.   As an American we are supposed to love our country, and support our government and be patriotic and "proud" of where we come from. This is where I am beginning to become ashamed. You see, I have been sitting in a biblical history class now for 3 weeks, studying things that have an eerie resemblence to "Current Events." When factions fought in bibcal times we know that Conqurers or occupiers came in and either imprisoned the people or chased them out of their own lands. People were stripped of their clothing to bring them down and keep them down. They were also humiliated and in some biblical historical data, their sexual organs were exploited and shown off.   Does this sound INCREDIBLY similar to something going on right now?   The U.S. as a nation went into a Middle Eastern area that is inhabited with people who lived there for centuries. A peoples different from US. That area of the world WAS the BACKDROP for many of these biblical stories we read today. Those human atrocities were committed then and they are being perpetuated even today. So I mused in class on Monday and I rasied this issus with the Masters Students in that Theology class along with my Porfessor, Mrs Marie-France Dion. She is a Hebrew Bible Scholar. Very well respected in the Biblical History and Religious circles. So I take what she teaches very seriously.   I am also taking Introduction to Islam. Many of my Amercian friends and family are not very pleased that I would "dine with the enemy" so to speak. But I persevered and stayed my course and stood my ground. It IS a class that I need for my major, so I had to take it. But I really WANTED to take it so that I could learn about the People of Islam and the Religion the world calls Islam. The first day of class my Professor ( who is an Islamic Scholar ) stood up in front of many Islamic men and women, Shi' ites and Sunnis and said to us that he was from Pakistan and he was a faithful man to his Muslim faith. That struck me very deeply. I happen to really like this man, as a man and a Professor. I learn something new every day. Stick with me here. Please !!!  This is where I am right now, I need to write this down because if I don't I won't get anywhere. I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't know what I believe in anymore. This is not a crisi of faith. That is not the question or crisi point. When I came here, I was told to sew a Canadian Flag on my backpack, because then, Americans were not really looked well upon. So I did that. I got rid of everything that was American. Actually, I sent my pins and flags to soldiers in Iraq in "care packages." Over the last 2 years I have seen life in the U.S. and the World through different "glasses" so to speak. When you live in a foreign country, things look and sound very different.   I have seen the last two years come and go around the world. I have muslim friends who encourage me to ask my questions and look at things from different perspectives. To see Humanity as it is, from a different perspective than it had been presented to me in the U.S. If you honestly look at the U.S. and the way she lives, muslim people were strangers in a foreign land. After 9/11... they were then made "suspects." They were not of  ( US or U.S. ).  I love my muslim friends. They are proud people, but most of all they are human. They respect me and I have been to Mosque a number of times in the last year. I have changed.   This week has been particularly difficult for me personally. Along with the stress of taking care of my hubby, a home, myself and my education, I am faced with this feeling that " I don't know where I belong right now." I am ashamed of what I have been brought up to be proud of. I am ashamed to admit that I come from the U.S. anymore. I feel such shame that it makes my skin crawl. I've never felt this kind of feeling before. I am "Uncomfortable."  I know certain things now, 2 years later living in Canada. I have grown up so much in the last two years, that I am not the same man I was, when I came to Montreal. I feel sorry for those people in the Middle East. Those people that live in the area we call " The Fertile Crescent." The cradle of modern civilization. They were here way before ("WE") were here. My heart breaks when I think about this. I had to seek counsel from a man I trust today. One of my Professors, that IS my academic advisor, is also one of my closest friends. I went to see him on campus this afternoon. I told him where I was in my head. I explained all of this to him. And he just said, " I am glad that this is happening to you. You see that professor is from the United States. And he knew exactly what I was talking about. I have sat in this mans classroom for 2 semesters, and I have exchanged conversations in and out of class, and I've written several exams and papers for him as well. So he knows me better than anyone else.   Dr. Boisvert said that he agreed with me on my position and he said that this "catharsis" that I am going through was very Important in my life. He said that he was glad to see that this was happening, as I said above. He said that he had hoped that I would get to this point. And he was happy for me. You see, Dr. Boivert is one of a few choice men, here in Montreal, who is invested in my life. As a student and as a friend. I told him that I did not feel comfortable in my own skin, that I was ashamed of where I came from. He said that that was ok. He said that this is what "Higher Education" is all about. I've heard this said to me in meetings by my sponsor, that " I am right where I should be."  He encouraged me to stay the course, to work through my feelings and he said that I did not need to "find" my place yet, and he said that it was ok to be in this apathetic area. I was told that I should continue my searching and continue asking my questions. He said that eventually i would find my "Place" in the grand scheme of things. He seems to think this is a very important part of my growth.   So that's where I am right now. Very unsure of where I fit in, I am ashamed at how "one sided an education" I had. I am ashamed at what I know as a 36 year old man. This means that, I have had the opportunity to see the place that I came from, for who she really is. And I don't like it. I don't like it at all.  It makes me sick to my stomach. I have begun to see the world in a city that embraces the world. I attend a University who's professors encourage us to ask and to grow and to form our own opinions about the many areas of life and to look at what we are taught and try to understand it and if possible, integrate it into our lives. I am trying to do that.   Today, I see the world from a "world view" not from the U.S. view that I was raised and educated to look at. And that old view disgusts me to the pit of my stomach. And Prof Boisvert said that it was ok for me to feel that way. He welcomed this into my life. So I am sitting in in and trying to make sense of the way I feel and why. I will never look at anything the United States does with the same eyes as I did when I lived in the United States.   I just thought it was important to write this down, for my own good, and as well as give Stevie something to read. And maybe some of you will have read to this point and have something to say about what I wrote. Maybe Turtle and Tugger and any other "mentors" on LMAO will help me see something from their perspective and maybe give me some of their own wisdom from their "vaults of life."   Thanks for sticking with it, I am done now.    See ya,  Jeremy

      1) Last night I hooked up with this hot guy at the local corner bar. The problem is that my husband will kill me if he ever finds out. We’ve been together for 24 years and have never cheated on each other until last night. Should I tell him? ***********************************************************************  2) I’m 22 years old and in my 4th year of college at Alabama State University. I think I’m gay. How do I know and what should I do? I’m totally in the closet and my father, the pastor of the biggest Southern Baptist congregation is Alabama will probably disown me. Please help!   ************************************************************************  Dear Cheater...  I wonder why you went to that bar in the first place. Were you out for libations, or were you out to feed your sexual appetite as well. You say you have a Lover of 24 years, I gather that your frequency of sex may have fallen to an all time low, as it seems for some couples that sex does wane when the years mount up. Did you mean for this sex act to go on, or did it take you by surprise. I think that you wanted to cheat, and the excitement of getting caught was just the right fuel you needed to take that step over that imaginary line, I like to call "CHEATING!"  You know that you should not be in a relationship, if you have to go outside of the one you are in to satisfy something that your partner cannot give you. If your partner finds out will he A) kick you to the curb or B) forgive and forget, and will you ever tell him to begin with, or will you add this secret to the many that you keep locked away in your "secret" diary??? OHHH, bad little boy.  If you cheated here, how many times have you cheated already and did not "Get Honest" with the man you should have had sex with. I hope this does not become habitual. Be careful the decisions you make, they not only affect you, but may fuck someone else up for life. If you make the decisions about screwing around, then please release your partner of the guilt he will carry thinking that it was his fault that YOU decided to cheat on him.  Cheers Mary Advisalot  *********************************************************************  Dear Alabama Virgin,  They say that when we enter University that the goal of the instiutution we are in is to change the way we think and feel by the time we leave. I see that that is true for you. 22 And not know what to do..Ahhh decisions, decisions.  Daddy is Pastor of a Baptist church you say, well, I think you need to find your way into the world. I like to say that There is NO MAN on EARTH who has God's Ear... so if you listen to man, you will always be disappointed. Listen to your heart and follow what it tells you. In my belief system God Loves me for who I am, not for what I am not. Therefore my young man, take your time, talk to as many people as you can.  The more knowledge of the world you wish to enter, the better off you will be in the long run. Labels do more harm in separating humans than they do to unite them. I suspect that your first step in coming out is find someone you can trust to talk to, find a place you can live and be yourself. Young Man, Coming out IS a LIFELONG process, which is not to be taken lightly. It is not just a one day " throw open the Doors and SAY "HEY WORLD I AM GAY," kind of event. This will begin to shape every part of your being, and mold you into the man you will become. Take your time. Trust only those you MUST and love those you can, while you still have time.  People in our lives exists with us on a need to know basis, and Does DADDY need to know everything? no he doesn't. Gossip kills, so does homophobia. Be careful what you let loose into the public forum, because the implications of success will be determined by the support you have. Coming out is a big step, and the loss of family and friends, allbeit, for a little while, is a very high probability, that is why i suggest you find people to stand in your corner as the news gets disseminated. AND on YOUR terms as well. Not theirs...  Church folk are strong in their convictions, but you should stand up and be the man you were meant to be. I would be saddened to read years from now that you are divorced and have young children, and the reason you left your marriage was because you realized that you were really GAY to begin with.  Wasted time is Wasted time my young friend. Time is a precious commodity, once wasted it can never be regained. So young soldier, what are you going to do with your time now???  sincerely  Mary advisalot.  My name is Jeremy I am 36 and live in Montreal. I spend most of my nights here in front of this little box, doing this - what you read above. I spend my days in classes at Concordia University Majoring in Religion and Minoring in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality. I've been a member here since September 2003. My words and posts speak for themselves. Some more bio-info. I have been HIV + for now going on 12 years, and I am still alive. One of the few POZ members on this board. I am ( 2 1/2 years, clean and sober) and i volunteer my time at a drug crisis center here in Montreal. Not to mention the hours I spend at my computer at night talking to the masses around the world every night. I am involved in a relationship that has had it's ups and downs, and I've been to hell and back, several times. The best thing us "elders" can do is share a little insight with others. Getting the message out and helping another person is what we should do every day. It's all about sharing pearls of wisdom. If we don't all of our secrets will die in the grave we will eventually lay in.

      hi, i thought i should update this log today, since i have the time. i am going to open up another chapter of my life here, abd share some thoughts that may not be as normal as some, but if it helps someone then so be it.   i met a new friend the other night, his name is Jon. Kinda interesting where we met and how we strted to talk about life. From a fetish list to a messenger chat, to BLOG. we crossed many lines of discussion about a great many things. A great deal of my time, especially at night, i sit here in front of this box, and i talk to people all over the world. i am a counselor, an activist, and HIV / addictions counselor as well. Last night i added another angel to my list of "people" out there that I hope to stay friends with.   Life throws us many things and decisions are part of them. Do I "come out," "what do I choose to be?" and where do I find my place in the world? I don't have all the answers, but I do have part of the roadmap of life. My roadmap. It is the plan that I follow every day. For those out there looking for the route into the world, I should tell you that the more people you talk to the greater chance you might have to find part of "YOUR" next portion of the map.   You never know where a conversation will go from beginning to end, and really, it might amaze you when you open yourself up to someone far away. I am amazed at how many things i have experienced seem interesting to many people. My life, as complex and insane it can get, has its teaching value. This is for Jon.   Hi there, I see your on your way to Singapore.. How kewl is that. I hope that one day you will find the courage to make that important choice you need to make. It will come when you are ready for it. It will appear to you and you WILL know it. But until then, follow the road, whereever it may lead you. It's all about the journey.   The JOURNEY....   You never know who you will meet on the road of life.  We are asked to start the journey only carrying what we need to. Please leave the samsonite luggage at home, excess baggage is useless.  Leave all the things you dont need to carry at home. Memories remain in your heart. You do not need pictures or books or junk that will hold you back or slow your pace.  If you need water, then find a water bearer. If you need food, find someone with a little bread. if there are elderly men or women on the road, walk with them a bit and help them on their way. Stop to talk to wayward journeymen. Ask them where they are going and see if you can't walk with them until they reach the city gates.   The journey never ends. The journey goes on as long as we choose to walk. and walk we will, but never alone. One just needs to realize that we are never really alone.   You never know when you are going to "Entertain an Angel."   Walk tall my young soldier. We are here and we walk with you. If you need guidance then ask us, I am sure that Someone has something to share with you about their own journey.  Lao Tse says: "You can do great things, by just doing nothing."   Have a good day. Cheers and g'day from Montreal Jeremy

      So it's Saturday and I've had the week for hell. Canada has celebrated the Fete Nacional on Thursday with a full day of parties and entertainment. Vive la Quebec. On Wednesday night I found that Peter has been drinking cough medicine by the bottle, behind my back. He had doped up to catch a buzz and watch the Matrix Revolutions. The movie crapped out and at 3am he got dressed to go to the video store and demand a new rental. Well he could not stand up and was stuttering and slurring. ********************************  needless to say I was not pleased and went bezerk. This ignited 2 days of fights and physical altercations between us. Peter HAD been clean and sober for almost 18 months. So much for that. And it was a shock to my mental stability to see  him like this. And to know that he had pissed away his "time" over the cough medicine HIGH. So now he starts over again, and I am living with a newcomer once again. I don't know if I have it in me again. He sleeps as I write and sleeps away most of his day and night.   *******************************  Things are not always as they seem, So I am waiting for divine inspiration here. Its a good thing that Clay and Ryan are coming up next weekend. I can go hang out with Clay and Ryan can babysat Peter while I get out of the house. It's the July 4th Holiday in the States, so Clay and I will have a few days together. That will be great.   ********************************  As for me, I am tired and frustrated with life. I need a break and I need to get out of here, as I have said before. Melbourne sounds like a far enough place to go for a vacation. He he he. I'm not going get that vacation from life yet. Peter is going to New York for 3 days the weekend of the 8th and 9th. So I will have a whole weekend to myself here.   ********************************  I need to get "Laid" yes I do. It has been so long and that is a sticking point with my hubby here. He has put me on the BAN LIST. So I don't get any action here, and that is making me a very bitter man. I want to go out and sow my wild oats, but cheating is not an option. I believe that if you have to go outside a relationship for something, then you don't deserve to be in a relationship. So I eat sour grapes.   ********************************  other than that, classes are over, the exams have been written and turned in. Now I wait for my grades to come out. I've applied for assistance next fall for my classes since I cannot handle the pressure of 12 credit semesters, taking care of Peter and being HIV Positive. I just cannot do it. I will make myself sick and die over the stress. So I get to play my ace card.   ********************************  I've made some wonderful new friends online, and now we belong to a little "cam group" we sit and chat, and like a friend has said, to see expression when we talk is really great. We have a 2  continent chat every day. Very kewl. Well that's all I have for today. See ya...

      It's Tuesday and Summer classes are over. I handed in my last final exam. Now I am on vacation until September. Now what do I do with myself? My relationship is falling apart, all my friends are in this little box and live 1/2 a world away and I am here alone trying to cope with this shit I have been putting up with for months now. I am tired and need a break. I just need to get the fuck out of here for a few weeks. If i only had the money. I have made some great new friends and they keep me sane these days. As for Peter, well, I don't know if we'll be together much longer, if this crap keeps up. I am not happy and it is beginning to wear down on me more than usual.   I am just an irritable mess lately, not to mention that the weather outside is frightful. that does nothing to help my mental and emotional being. So im sitting here jamming to launch.com all alone here. I'd rather be alone with myself then in the room with someone who doesn't want to be with me. is this the in good times and bad times test??? well i think i am failing. im not sure what to do at this point.   that's all i have for right now, will write more later.

      hello  It's been a bit since my last entry, and i don't know where i am today. i don't know  what will happen in the next few days, in regards to Peter and I and right now i really  do not care. Peter has drained two bank accounts and made arrangements to go to New York  City to see some shows, knowing full well, we have a $1000.00 cad tuition bill due the CC is maxed out and hes left me with $100.00 for the next 5 days. He says he needs this trip, and it's all about him. So be it. ************************************************************************   I am so tired of being alone, in a house built for two. This mental disease is far greater a problem than i had anticipated. My friend Clay came up last weekend and all Peter did  was sleep and mope around the house, which agitated several heated confrontations infront of our guest. Then Peter had a massive emotional breakdown on Sunday Night, which did not help things. **************************************************************************  what am I supposed to do now. And Where am i to get the emotional, physical and sexual contact that I so crave tonight? where do I get the "all about me" feeling. where do I  go from here? I have no fucking clue. Peter leaves on a midnight bus to NYC and I am damn not gonna babysit him in the terminal for 2 hours before his bus. No way in hell. This is his trip and thats what he told me - so he can go on his own, and come back on h is own.  I just cannot bring myself to see him off, knowing that he is leaving me alone. without a clue where I stand, and when it will be my turn to get what I need.  ****************************************************************************   I am tired of giving and giving and putting up with this mental "masterbation" that I get every day. Oh I have mental problems, so I cannot do anything. OH i am so tired and weak  and i am not going to respond to you - BUT if you give me $500.00 Cad I will go to new york, see some shows and be better for the trip. but FUCK YOU while you wait. this is insanity. he promises that when  he comes back he will be accountable. well " the check  is in the mail as well....." i am in way too deep. ******************************************************************************   Where do you draw the line on what is enough??? I have had enough. What about ME? who is going to take care of me? Who is going to see me through this weekend? How am I going to  cope with all this insanity??? I don't know how I am going to deal with this.  ******************************************************************************   Where do you draw the line between empathy for mental disease, the excuse of the disease  as a problem, therefore I will not or cannot try to change, and where do you say OK get  off your fucking ass and pay me some attention and make me feel like I am important. *******************************************************************************   This is killing me slowly... killing me emotionally, killing me sexually and killing me spiritually. I don't need this .. HIV is taking me slowly as it is, it does not need any help. I am so trying to stay above the water here. I just don't know where to turn.

         another passes by and life just keeps giving me little things to look at and think about. My other life has me very occupied and i don't spend alot of time in my oldlife anymore. Living under the same roof with someone i don't even interact with anymore. it's getting to the point that i really don't care. There is so much going on for me right now that i don't care to stop and reflect of the life that i had a few short weeks ago, to the life I have today.  ******************************************************************      So many people count on me for things, friends that need a kind word, a prayer and a thought, or just someone to be there when they get home from doctors appointments and dates with strangers. a new door into my soul has been opened and i don't regret walking throught that door either. A wise man once said that " Regrets are the past weighing down your present!" so no regrets ....   *******************************************************************      what can i say about today, but my star is on the rise and the sun is rising in Montreal as I write this. I've seen alot of sunrises from my window. this has been an incredible time for me. and i've enjoyed every minute of it. I don't know what to do with the life I left behind and how I am to address it. I don't htink that I am going to either.  *******************************************************************    People, so many people in my life today, my cup runneth over. There is no time to stop now, one can only move forward with the momentum guiding me in that direction. I have worries that Jon is going to have to face a very hard task, and I worry that I cannot physically be there for you - but know I am there as close as i can be for you. You are such a strong young man with such promise. I fear that the light may go out on your soul so please " Hold ON" to the light and know you are not alone.   ********************************************************************    Family.......... what to do with them. I can't go backwards only forwards. No looking back now. I cannot get saddled down with their issues and problems, that's why i left Florida in the first place. They don't give a shit about me so why should I them. Ah the Burning question of the heart of a servant of God. Should my care and compassion have limits to those who have abused my good graces and spit on my name...why yes i think so.          ********************************************************************

      I slept all day today. I have been on the go around the clock for many days now and i needed some rest. So I went to bed very early this morning. The sun was already coming up. I woke up after having a dream that went on and on. I was out and about in this dream. and I ended up in a hospital with a spear through my head. I was laying on a guerney and i was wide awake experiencing everything painlessly, it seemed. they ( who ever ) was trying to remove the item from my head. without success. So eventually they cut the end off of the object and slid it back out of my head. there was no damage perse, it was  dream. but i remember feeling the whole procedure. from beginning. without anesthesia. what does this mean, and why did I have the dream?  *****************************************************************************  On another note. I have had a very eventful week. I met some really great people and Jon and I are becomming really great friends. I find him dynamic and fun to be around, in that "around" sense of the word. So three nights ago I was pmmed by this man in Kent named John. We hit it off famously. He said some very interesting things to me in our first conversation. Last night he had checked on some boots i wanted from the U.K. and said they were on their way en route to me via kent. when i asked him how much they were, he said don't worry about it, that I could work off the balance when i go to the U.K. in December. Through our discussion John and I talked about a mutual friend whom He knew personally and i know from our online relationship. So I'm off to the U.K. over the Christmas Holidays for some really steamy times.   ********************************************************************************  I met a local rubberman here in Montreal this week as well. And we are destined to get together in the next to near future. He has a thing for tall rubber boots, well so do I. we have a weekend planned soon. and I cannot wait. My star is on the rise and things look good. I realized that I had to take charge of my life and set my boundaries and persue my goals and everything started happening. It's all good.  *********************************************************************************  So grasshopper, dad is doing better. I am so glad for that. I guess that prayers are answered every day, and we have to be mindful of that. The universe gives up what we need when we need it. You should know that by now, as well, You are loved. What ever happens now, is in the Creator's hands. Be prepared for everything and anything. enjoy life, meet people and have a good time. Wasted Time is Wasted time. Time is a precious commodity, once wasted it can never be regained.   ***********************************************************************************  As for home, all is well, quiet. Peter is ok and things are ok for now. nothing else to report. his trip to New York was good. And he came home with a few changes and revelations. we'll see where he takes them. No expectations, no disappointments.

        One day I was at Indigo, my favorite bookstore in all of Montreal. And there was this blue dust covered book called Eragon. I love it when a book jumps off the shelf and says "BUY ME." After long deliberation and inner struggle I decided to pick it up.  Having been a many year, multiple book, Harry Potter supporter, I just could not bring myself to betray that and go read another book like that. Harry Potter and I share the same birthday, (July 31st ) it does say that HP was born on July 31st in book one. What a coinkidink!!!  Anyway, Eragon was a boy who lived in Carvahall in the land of Alagaesia...who happens upon a sapphire object, which turns out to be a Dragons Egg. Not just any dragon's egg, mind you. It was a special dragon's egg. Hence begins the trilogy of Eragon in " INHERITANCE." book 1.  I get caught up in books, visually and descriptively. I get into books, I escape into worlds unknown. I live in my character's heads. I see with their eyes. And I become them. Such is the world of a great reader. I can sit for hours upon hours reading like this and I have done that. Cup of Earl Grey, a rainy day or night...comfy sheets and a great book.  Eragon became part of my lexicon. And So here Eragon holds the Court in my blog. I just thought you would like to know who Eragon was. You can get info on Eragon and check in the website and fan club of Eragon at( www.alagaesia.com).  Book Two is in the works by Christopher Paolini. He's such a great writer. I may be getting older, but I still read like a young boy. Excited about the next adventure and the traveling of the journey. Hell, why not. The world is so strife with war and pain and pestilence. To escape into a world never seen is greater than living in misery and fear all the time.  They say "Eragon" will make it to the silver screen...I can't wait for that.  Eragon fans UNITE.....  bye...  i love you jon.

      It's Saturday and I am home alone. Peter has goone to Ottawa for a week with Ryan. He said I needed a break to gather my head and spend some time taking care of me. Now, I can let my hair down, grab my rubber and spend some quality time alone. Yesterday there was a huge blowout fight and it got nasty. Ryan intervened and is going to talk to Peter and get him the help he needs since my methods are not working for him.  I've got a week to myself. OH, the Joy ....  I made an incredible connection with a man named Vince last night on (WRM) World Rubber Men. He saw my profile and we commenced communications. He's right up my alley, and was very intersted in talking to me. He is from NYC and is pondering a move up over the Northern Border. How auspicious the timing! We'll see what comes of that. Maybe there will be a future there. I don't know. I know better than getting my hopes up.  My little grasshopper........yes ( YOU ) has realized that sex and doing da nasty repeatedly depleats his energy and his hormone level. HA HA HA everything in moderation my friend. gotta rest and reload the gun and let it have a rest for a few days. Learning the system of the body when venturing into new territory is very important. Every thing is a give and take. Each system of the body works and reacts differently. When you ask the body to do something, you better be ready to answer to your body, when it says...ok i'm done now. time to rest or else!!! Every time we learn a new task, or pleasure and every time we ask to body to give us pleasure, it always asks for some "type" of repayment. Lao Tse says.."We can do great things, by just doing nothing."  A friend has told me that I should start writing my fiction stories again, like I had in the past to secure some free membership time on the new "rubbermen site." So sometime I have to sit down and start writing again. I wrote a 50 page story for the Mr. S Dungeon site when I was a member there under the title "Shane." if any of you are members there, you can read some of my work.  If you would like a copy of Shane for your home reading, just email me at (eragon@ca.inter.net) and i will gladly send you a copy. It's a great Leather, M/s Story.    I got my rubber catsuit back from repair yesterday. And when Ryan and Peter went out to lunch, needless to say, i was changed in 30 seconds. I did not know how much I missed feeling that rubber and sliding my body into the suit .........oh I love rubber. I can't get enough of it.         I am not sure what the future holds for me in the shape of men and relationship, but I am keeping all my options open. I have a trip planned in the near future " Funds willing " I will be able to make it. I need to sort my passport next week. I wish i had a million dollars, that would make life so much easier.  I don't have anything else to report. But I will ask something of YOU if you are reading this. I always enjoy comments and wisdom from others. So if you have something to share, if only a sentance then please, feel free to leave a note. or email me, at my home email.  Always remain teachable. For your life is over, when YOU decide that there is nothing more to learn.  In the words of Oprah Winfrey...   "Live your best life Everyday..."    See ya Jeremy  i love you jon.

      greetings to the world now looking in to my blog. Since i added statcounter, i've seen where all my visitors are coming from. i never thought people would be interested in reading my ramblings, but it's all good.  So what's new with me? My friend Ryan is here this week visiting and Clay is coming on Friday evening. The family is all here. it's good to see family. Well, the one I choose as my family. So, i have a few thoughts to write about tonight.  First: my birthday was on Saturday and i did not get a card or a phone call from my biologicals. So i let it go and last night it finally got to me that I wanted to know why my egg doner did not call. My biologicals dont get names or titles for that's what they are, simply, biologicals. Anyway, i called her and asked how she was ans started a normal conversation without opening up that can of worms. well my biological did. she said that she didnt send me a card but she thought about me on my birthday. ok fine. WHY NOT? i asked her calmly why she didn't call? she replied that she did not have long distance to Canada on her phone, not to mention my other biological would not allow that, he thinks i am a deserter for leaving the United States and coming to Canada. She said that SHE was not made of money. I ventured to ask why she could not go buy an international calling card for $10 and keep in in her phone book. She started calling me a whore and a failure and said that i could care less for them, yet i continue to call on a regular basis.  There is something you need to know here. My biological ( f ) has always maintained that I was the Mistake that never was supposed to have happened. My biological ( m ) is a battered wife who is married to a raging alcoholic who beats and mentally abuses her. She wil lnever leave. for better or worse right?? what the fuck.  When i " Came Out" I moved away from home cause my father was a fag basher. Homophobe. He hates Fags!! When I was diagnosed HIV positive 13 years ago, my father humiliated me in front of a housefull of guests on Christmas 1997, by seating my separately from the others at dinner at a card table in a separate room, with platic plates, silverware and paper napkins. Alone. They would keep bleach bottles in all the bathrooms, and lock me in the house at night, not allowing me to use the phone, cook, or have friends come to visit me when i was there. ( I am 37 now). I never went home again for another holiday.   THE GREATEST PUNISHMENT TO THEM IS THE EMPTY CHAIR AT HOLIDAYS. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHY THAT CHAIR IS EMPTY.       When I moved to Canada is 2002, my father called me a deserter for leaving the U.S. but here I have prospered, and survived alot better than when i was in Miami. My biological ( m ) comes from  Canada.  My father has alienated all the Canadians out of her life, by making her choose over family or husband. she cannot have both. Now i am alienated as well. Much deeper.  My step mother ( nancy ) she IS mother to me, has always encouraged me to keep a door open and try. and I've done that for now 37 years, only to have them slam the door in my face, when i venture to open it. It's very sad. I am a family oriented man, who lives to have family, and the two people who agreed to bring me into the world, will not be. It breaks my heart.  Being in recovery has been difficult because i cannot close that chapter of my life. I cannot make amends for the past, and i cannot move forward without them because i dont have closure in my molestation charges. ( my BIO (F) molested me when i was a child...now you know )  And I don't have certain answers that I deserve to know about. BUT i have moved forward, i have to live my life without them, and so i do that, to the best of my ability. What happened to men and respect and dignity? because i am different makes me less? being Gay does not give me rights in their book, and being HIV positive just kills me, in their eyes. Now i live in Canada makes me persona non-grata. sad very sad.  The rubber list is going to a premium site. I don't think i will be going with them. I cannot afford the charges added to my budget. I already belong to JUB and pay for member services there. I get forums, porn and stuff there. I may change over sometime, but with school starting soon, i won't be online very much. time to buckle down.  My dearest friend ... ( yes YOU ) has a problem and comes back to me for speculation and advice. well bud, you know what you must do I've given you my advice. Don't do what you did again until you have some definitive answer about whats aggrivating the sysytem. You cannot take any chances - we are sitting on the Last Watch, and I will tell you, I don't want YOU on my last watch list allright. I love you and i want you to be well and healthy. Specualting and not finding out the truth is just suicidal. You know better than that.  that's all i have for you today.  Cheers from Montreal Bye jon I love you ...

      I heard a story on the radio just now, and I think that I shall never think the same ever again. Please remind me when i complain.  An elderly man walked into a hospital triage area, because he needed to get stiches removed from his finger. An orderly asked him why he was there and the man told him why. He was in a hurry and had a doctors appointment. He asked the man to take a seat, knowing full well that it would be more than an hour before someone looked at him. He saw the man looking at his watch tentatively and So the orderly went and talked to one of the doctors and got the necessary items to do the procedure.  He began to talk with the man over the few minutes he was there, and inquired about the elderly mans health, he asked " do you have a doctor's appointment?" No, the elderly man replied, I have to go eat breakfast with my wife. The orderly smiled, the elderly man had told him that she was in a home for the elderly and was suffering from alzheimer's disease. The orderly inquired, " " do you have breakfast with your wife every morning?" Yes the man replied.  The elderly man continued, "She has not known who I am, for now 5 years, and I have breakfast with her every morning." The orderly inquired "why do you do that every morning?"   The elderly man replied..... " She may not know who I am, But I remember who she is."  True love is what is right now, what was, what will be, and what will not. It deals with things as they come, whether good times or bad times.  Good night jon.  I love you

But it was such an honor to share these moments with him, via cam and messenger. My little Rubber Family is taking shape. See "What Dreams May Come, Jon, Your Dreams."  To see Jon Really smile to see the joy on his face was a kodak moment. Something I hope you never forget. Because you have arrived and you deserve every great thing in your life.  Goodnight Rubber Boy... I love you  Jeremy

My (EX) who suffers from Bipolar 2 (rapid cycling) has pushed me over the egde of my own sanity. And So I choose to move on with my life in the last month. The Rubberlistand all those on it like JON ( YES YOU ) and friends like BOB and Jason, and Stuart,have been very supportive.

      Well, Saturday night was fun, the   Bronx     was busy and there were not a whole lot of men to look at really... lots of men, nothing to gawk at. sad. but i did interact with the one person i wanted to. a very sexual leatherman who made mad passionate love to me it was the most fabulous experience. wasn't just a quick in and out visit, but a   Long, slow, sensual, erotic     build up to the finish line. Afterwards we sat and talked for a long while. I may see him again. Who knows... but he was great.  When i left him, the night went downhill and did not start climbing again. I guess I got home at 5am. my rubber bud isn't on, so ( YOU ) can read this later i guess.  My first night alone at home, wtih no company to entertain, no meals to cook, and no misery as far as the eye can see. I am not sure what i wanna do right now, but enjoy the silence and myself. I napped earlier before going out and I had that sequence of    NIGHTMARES     again. The ones where i'm paralyzed in bed and cannot move and everything is moving really slow, a Paralysis dream. But in this nightmare, there is something or   Someone     hovering over me, and not the kind of benevolent spirit either. It freaked me out. I got up three times to check the door to make sure it was locked. That freaked me out. That sequence of dream only comes during a   NAP   session, not during a regular sleep pattern.  Doug, the bondage, bastinado boy flies in this evening for a week of international language school. We have some  "PLAY"  sessions scheduled for our evenings.              Gonna get some   BASTINADO   training in this week to augment my varied KINK library.  At least i don't have to cook or entertain him around the clock. he's staying on the Plateau.  so that's my update for Saturday / Sunday morning.  Goodnight ...  i love you Jon.
