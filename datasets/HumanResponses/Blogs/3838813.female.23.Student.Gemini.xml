      Spiderman... Spiderman... haha some character playing e violin sang e cartoon theme song in e movie...  Went to watch it finally. Not bad a movie but its actually quite long, about 2 hours i think. Started watching at 8.30pm and leave at about 10.35pm. The action scenes were ggoooodd, bringing the comic moves to life! Plus its also quite funny, w a few punchlines and even a dig at e comics and actors themselves... haha. Hmm.... would give it a 4 out of 5 ratings :p  Have a kinda weird trip home after movie... U know.... MAJOR deja vu! That kind of feeling you have... but can only say wat it is in french haha....   Was walking home from max's after getting CD from him, it happen near my house there. Noticed a lady standing near e traffic light apparently waiting for a cab. Didn't think any of it, just someone u saw on e streets. Well but after a few steps.... it kind of hit me... everything's familiar... like i've been there done tat. Next thing i recall vividly is tat 2 cabs (i even know its comfort cabs!!) appear and e one in front will do a u-turn and e next one will stop for e lady. BINGO!!! It really happen lor... seldom tat i get such such a "real" feeling... hmm.... talk abt alternative dimensions!!!  Wouldn't it be interesting if there's actually prove of alternate dimensions??!! E same u but doing different things at different time. But its really strange how we can get that deja vu feeling... or maybe there's really a matrix kinda thing going on in reality? Wah.... that's really something to ponder about! Haha....   15 bucks gone during journey home.... might be for a real need or it might be e cost of my gullibility... well its over... so whatever  Countdown: 7 days to Perth

       School starts tmrw.... wow it seems fast now.... have been in holiday mood since i've arrived two weeks ago. Now feels abit  sian  cos its ending soon as school starts but then again feeling a tad excited and nervous abt the whole new learning environment i'll be in for the next 5 months or so... Hmm... wat to expect now? Think i'm going to the lecture tmrw all clueless cos i seem to forgotten wat i've learnt already!! Ha! Hopefully everything, including e mind, will settle in as sch starts....      Called back home yesterday nite to chat with my mom and sis... called to say everything is fine and didnt seem to find anything i lack tat i want them to send over.... haha maybe i'm e type tat can just survive on e basic needs... hmm haha except maybe clothes.... have bought a few here ;p      Received the letter mom said she was sending to me.... dont know why... although i dont feel homesick but i'm actually kinda touched/sad when i read the letter... maybe i really do miss my family.... but esp my mom's cooking and e soup!!!      Got a really surprising piece of news from my fren today!!! Told me two frens who are together are getting hitched! Wow its really quite unbelieveable for me.... someone i actually know is getting married!!! Wow....tats really kinda exciting but too bad i didn't witness e proposal. But i feel really excited and happy for them :) Congrats!! Haiz... i wont be able to see them getting married cos i'll still be in Perth.... haiz...      Guess i keep missing e good stuff now tat i'm not in SG! Unfair!!! Heard there's this fireworks festival at Marina where contestants from ard the world put up fireworks display.... sob sob... so sad i cant get to see them! Fireworks are my fave..... haiz not to mention i'll miss e live fireworks display from my home on National Day.....      So... it's off to start a brand new chapter of my life tmrw.... 1st day of school in a real uni campus!

       Yes! Yes! I'm finally in Perth and typing this from the comfort of my own room in Erica Underwood House, my home for the next 5 months. Was only able to get the internet connection on the monday after i reach cos e school just started the new Ethernet system for each housing. Haha..... now i get 10 mbps connection speed.... whoo hoo!       Well its been quite a while since i updated this... haha hav been kinda busy going places and watching aussie tv progs to blog. Or should i say i'm jus too  nuah  to do it. Haha blame the weather.... ;p    Wow... its already 2 weeks plus tat i got here... it really seems fast! Was like just at e airport w all e luggages and saying goodbyes to family and frens.   My sis, alvin (opps must call him bro-in-law now ;p haha) and mom came to send me off and not to mention our dear classmates Shufen and Derek came to see us off.... so touched.... Thanx again guys for coming down all the way to send us off. :)        The last meal we had in SG was actually Mac breakfast in the airport terminal before boarding haha! Took Qantas flight, found it rather amusing that the safety demo b4 take off is done by stewards instead haha..... maybe its prob me being used to seeing stewardess doing that instead..... hmm which reminds me of kelvin's version of it tat he used to do to entertain us haha.......       The check out took us about 1 hour.... the airport customs is quite small... only have like 4 counters open for foreign passports check out! Plus they are really strict about wat u bring in. I brought in tom yam paste and have to bring it over the counter for them to check and scan e luggage again b4 i can clear customs..... phew.... looonng process i must say.       Our van came to pick us and another beckham lookalike guy ;p to our hostel... tot he was staying at e same place but apparently he's not.... haha then at least can  biyo  a bit  ;p but too bad... as cin put it... e perfect image we have of him is dashed hahaha..... cos we discovered tat he actually has a beer belly, dance weird and dont really look tat cute afterall... its just his hair.... haha... okie on to e next target..... lol      the airport is actually quite near curtin think it only takes about 20 minutes car ride to the hostel. We lived on the third floor and my room is near e rear exit room 4, opp cindy's while beside is Jay our new flatmate and rebec.         So far have been shopping, taking buses ard and walking abt...   Lets see... where i have been so far.... been to      Harbour Town - shopping!!     Perth city - still exploring    Caversham Wildlife Park - haha got to pat and feed e kangaroos plus see other cute animals!    Wine tasting @ Swan Valley - very nice, thanx to Gab and frens for taking us to e trip :)    Subiaco - good place for groceries     Cannington, Westfield Carousel - shopping again! its huge!    Cottesloe beach - was there to see e sunset... wow! will be back!    King's Park - able to see e nite view of Perth city... will go there again in e day    Frementle - definately will walk ard there!!!    Curtin campus - haha have been exploring so wont get lost ;p    Village Green - the nearby "shopping centre" where we got our food from Coles    The WA Art Museum - 10 exhibit halls! only visited 3 i think... will go back for more ;p     Hmm... think tats abt all, been doing a lot of groceries shopping lately.... haha as if we scare we would starve ;p and cin, reb and me have develop desperate cravings for green veggies, seems to be depraved of it as western food seldom have large amt of veggies and now e fridge is stuff w them haha...    So far went to e Twilight tour, shopping trip, orientation party and today, e river cruise organise by e orientation com and guild... most of e new ppl are asians... think at least 80% just got to know some of them but mostly its just hi and where u from tat kind..... think will know more when school starts    Whoa!... highlight of e entire 2 weeks was on fri at e O-week party, we went at 9pm to just check out wat its like but end up really enjoying ourselves.... haha alcohol here cheap le.... one jug beer 10 bucks haha.... might end up quite a good drinker when i get back ;p lol.... were really getting high and laughing ourselves siao on fri haha... but its really fun although we were stoning for e river cruise trip today as a result haha....    hmm... still quite awake now... prob too much green tea... but then again need to enjoy surfing e net cos having problem accessing websites and verifying password.... laggy system! :s    Praying it'll be fine tmrw as like today...... or i'll be couch potato again haha.....    Hmm... heavy rain and windy outside... can hear e wind inside my room... gonna be quite cold tonite so better wear me socks to sleep...... zzzzzz!
