       Good song good song...Shania Twain is the only country type person i like. lol I worked the register all by myself today at work...so fun. I love work...i don't see y ppl complain lol....but i'm told it gets old fast. The cutest little girl was talkin to me when she went through the line saying "Be extra careful not to break the eggs...cuz then the egg monster will come, and we dont want that." lolol MCAS was pretty annoying today in school. It wasn't hard...just annoying. I was supposed to hang out with Eric and Melissa tomorrow night but I switched hours with a girl from work so i gotta work 5-10. But hey, more money for me :) 2 more days till the Kiss Concert! I'm almost more excited to take the limo there lolol. But it kinda sucks that i have to get up at 5 to be ready for 7. Thats the same time i fricken get up for school. But its all worth it to see Maroon 5...

       How is everyone on this lovely night of May 19th?? I'm simply wonderful...a little cold though. Today was pretty dull. Nothing out of the ordinary happened...besides the "dead people" walking around school today...that kinda bummed and creeped me out at the same time. Erika came over after school and we played a little volleyball-type thing with my sister with my giant red bouncy ball. It's amazing how many times we let the ball roll into the street before we realized that if we moved higher into the lawn that that probably wouldn't happen...lol. I decided to take a shot at asking my mom if I could drive around the neighborhood with Erika. That was a big NO. haha. Later, Jenn came and picked us up and we went to Jay Gees and got some ice cream. I got vanilla soft serve with extra gummi bears on top lol...lets just say i ate all the gummi bears and none of the ice cream...cuz thats how i do yo. lol There is officially 3 days until the Kiss Concert :)It's gonna be so much fun. I'm planning on meeting Maroon 5, The Calling, Jessica Simpson, Kimberly Locke, and possibly Avril Lavigne...cuz i'm curious to see if she really is a bitch. lol I'm pretty upset that Simple Plan isn't gonna be there this year...but I guess I can deal. I think thats all I have to say for today. I should get to bed now...Math MCAS in the morning...fricken awesome huh? NOT! Goodluck to everyone else who has to take them...hope u do better than I do! :) Peace out homie g dawgs yo.   So I FaLL  I dOn'T wAnNa FeEl ThIs sMaLL  YoU kNoW i JuSt CaN't HaNdLe ThIs  HaNdLe ThIs At aLL  AnD i'LL jUsT FaLL  i'LL lEt My HeArTbEaT dRoP  I fAlTeR aS tHe MuSiC sToPs  AnD yOu WaTcH mE aS I sTaLL  AnD wOnDeR wHeN i FaLL...                     ~SoMeThInG cOrPoRaTe

       Hey guys. This is my very first entry...isn't that exciting? I'm excited. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up with this one. I sucked at the other one. Well, I just walked to my uncle's house from the orthodontist. Guess who gets their braces off next month? :)if u said Stephanie..ur riiight! I swear to God a tear fell down my cheek and i just got THE biggest smile on my face when he ever told me. lolol Today we had the English MCAS at school which was incredibly easily. The only thing I'm worried about is Math. I sucked and 1/2 at Math this year. Geometry sucks...bring on the Algebra! lol This week, they put me on the schedule for work on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And figures, the first Saturday they put me on, I can't work cuz I have the Kiss 108 Concert :). So now i'm panicking to find someone to take my hours...which seems to be impossible. So I think I'm just gonna go sometime today to tell the guy that I can't come in. And thats the end of my story...I'm off to listen to some Maroon 5...gonna see them on Saturday :)
