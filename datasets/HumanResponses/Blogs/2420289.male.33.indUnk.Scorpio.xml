      Just a another week of work, pretty easy week I must admit got in on Thursday.  The most interesting thing happened when I was in Chicago.  Delivering right down town at this paper place a person came up and was trying to sell me porn tapes, didn't buy any because I can get that stuff on cable tv.  Pretty cool got in on Thursday like I said and had boughten new ski over the web and they where at my mom's house and just went out this morning for a couple of hours on them "they rock" their call skiboards.  99cm long solomon sb10's trick skis.  Real easy to use.  No wipe outs for me but my daughter Ashley took a bad spill, but she walked it off.  So got done with that called into work and have to leave again today "Sucks big time!!" So until later, ba-bye blog!

      Unreal back home during the week, well only for a couple of hours.  After I called in after the dentist the other day I got a load to Brookfield, Wi for 4am which really sucked, since I didn't get out of town until 2pm, not even enough time to take an 8hr break for sleep.  For those non-truck driving people we're required to take and 8hr break after 10hrs of driving.  Then I went to Waukesha, Wi for my backhaul then home, wow pretty boring run but hey........I'm at home.  Saw something interesting though going through EauClaire, Wi.  I was sitting at a stoplight and a firetruck was coming down the road, then my stoplight turn green so I started, but then all of a sudden the stoplight switched back to red when the firetruck got about 2 blocks away.....weird huh!  Didn't know they could control the stoplights? Until next time by my blog!!!!! :)

      Well, here I sit and type my very first entry.  Don't have much to say but this really sucks cause as you'll get to know me in the future I don't really like my job...yep that right just like alot of you i'm not the only one "Thank God".  It's about 11:30pm and I have to get up and go to the dentist tommorow.  I hate the dentist as much as I hate my job.  Yea, after the dentist I call in to work and say "well I'm done at the dentist now where am I going this week to start off"  In my head i'm thinking better be a good run.  To people reading this a run is a term that we in the trucking industry use alot, yea it's stupid because we're not really running we're f-ing driving but anyways that's what's up and you find out more later if I get home during the week, otherwise I'll type some more stupid stuff next weekend here........stay tooned :(~

      Came home last night just woke up and call into work and got in trouble....fun!  I never really get in trouble at work!  I guess I was suppose to deliver a load in my home town before I came home for the night but I didn't.  It was unclear what my dispatcher told me on the phone.  First I was told to deliver the load at 8pm then I was told to call back in a half and hour so that's what I did, then she "Sharon" said, "go home and call from there at 9am"  so I took that as forget the first assignment because while I was talking to her she put me on hold and was stumbling in her word on what I was suppose to do.  Like I said above call back in a half and hour.  Most times that means they have other plans, and that's what I thought was going on.  So forget the first assignment and move on to the next......right.......wrong, never assume I guess!  They said my load was in the mailbox but I didn't think to look, I was under the assumption that I got to go home instead.  Whatever I guess, stirring the pot at work gets me noticed since they only know me by my truck number, now they know my name today....ye haw!  So I sit here and wait until 11am because now I have to deliver that same load at 1pm.  But hey I'm at home and that is what counts. Being on the road all the time really sucks but it pays the bills, so whenever I get a chance to get home I'm fucking there!!!!   Someday I'll get a normal job but until then I'll drive truck and hate everyday I do it.  Today it's snowing like hell throughout WI and all I hope is that I don't go that way.  I spent all fucking day yesterday driving in the stuff.  Well see ya blog and do this another time...............bye!!!

      Already Sunday and time to go back to work tonight.  Just a short run to start though, I don't mind it much maybe come back home tonight.  This weekend didn't do much but I did finally get the Max Payne2 game going on my PC.  All I can say is it "Rocks".  Best game I've played since Wolfenstien and the first Max Payne game.  Been playing it all weekend, well not every minute but a lot.  Went to the casino last night with my cuz RaeAnn and lost about $60.00 (donation...hehehe) She was up a hundred or so dollars until I left about midnight then she broke even I guess.  Called her at 9am this morning she was still sleeping because she didn't get in until 4am....oooh too bad no sleepy for her.  My daughter was at my house last night talking on the phone until 3am and now I'm bugging her this morning by typing on the keyboard its driving her nuts.  I told her to mosie into my bedroom where its quieter but she's too tired to get up, oh well that's her fault for staying up to late talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  Coffee "hell yeah" is the best in the morning....break.......slurp.......ahhh!!!  Cary my friend got me hooked on the grind your own kind at the store and I'll never go back to any of that canned stuff again.  Eight-o-clock French roast rocks.  Got to get back to my game so until next blogger time.............bloggin' off.

      What a night drivin' all fucking night to ThunderBay, On and back.  Started passing out on the way back (like blackout flashes) so I pulled over and was intending to take a 30min power nap and ended up crashin' for 4hrs. Now being back in the hole i'm getting tired.  Might go skiing but it's raining outside and it would really suck.  Got to go sleepy can't think of anything to wright.  bye

      Ick, Ick, Ick......that's how I feel waking up.  Not throw-up sick but just not all there since I went out maybe for the last time last night.  Sure I've said that before one hundred times but this time I'm really game for it.  It's not worth the risk which I stupidly did last night driving home drunk, but I've done it before.  Just couldn't stay at Sherri's house...so I left....hell yeah.  So now that I'm done going out forever I really don't know what's going to happen on New Years?  Maybe I'll just work anyways.  That will keep me from doing stupid shit like I did last night.  All I have to remember is that the Doggybizkit got his life turned upside down because of a DUI (still pending) and I don't need that.  How stupid I was, but not anymore! Drinkin' in a bar is fun, but not really, it's all for show or a game of wit's, who can do better at picking up chicks or chicks picking up dudes, why I ask myself is it so fucking fun doing that, well It is fun but not for me anymore.  Giving up trying to be noticed!  That's what it's all about getting noticed.  Doing stupid stuff just to get noticed, why?  If someone has an interest in someone else It shouldn't take a bar seen to go and do stupid stuff just to get noticed, we're all fucking kidding ourselves with the mind games played there.  It doesn't matter how much you try it ain't going to happen. It's all in the role of who you really know, right?  I know people, I watch it all the time even when I'm wasted or sober.  Watching people wasted there fucking time doing stupid tricks trying to pick up another, hell people watch me do stupid stuff and where does it get me, nowhere! So fuck the bar's, fuck the games, fuck the stupid pick-up shit, fuck everything and just fuckin' be me, that's what's going to happen in my boring life of a packrat!!

      Wowie, what a wasted day yesterday since I was drunk but got my Christmas shopping all done so I did do something.  Now it's Sunday and still playing the MaxPayne2 game......remember "It Rocks"  Have to go back to work at 4am Monday morning witch sucks and I still don't know if I'll have Christmas off or not (bastards)  To all of you reading this Christmas is a special time of year but depressing.  The special time should be about the birth of Christ but going around the malls yesterday I think that everyone thinks about it's just about buying shit for there loved ones, which is stupid, I did the same thing but next year It's going to be different.  Read Skipping Christmas by John Gresham.  It's a  funny book and maybe you'll open your eyes to what I'm talking about------the insanity-----. Well I'm off for now ba-bye, blogster!

      Man can't believe I went out to a bar last night again but didn't drive thank god but my friend Snuffy drove controlling the gas and brake but wouldn't touch the steering wheel so guess you did!  I was fucking scared doing it, I though I was going to die a couple of times, crazy mother f'ers.  Last night it was kind of fun was dancin' with some chick name Erin and got the ph#. Tried calling her last night to make sure she made it home ok but just got a voice mail....sux!  But anyway woke up and feeling ok, called work and don't have to go back until Monday which is good.  Kind of nervous about the new HOS (hours of service) rules going into effect starting Sunday but what ya going to do.  The doggybizkit is packing up his shit today so I better get ready cuz he needs some help moving, plus I'm getting Precious his spider for awhile witch is cool because My Mistress (my spider) needs some company...he he he.  Dog if you read this I promise I wont put them together, I don't need a million little baby spiders running around in the cages. Man people won't stop call my house leaving messages and my cell phone it's driving me nuts, so I better get going.........chow blog

      Thursday morning allready and my vacation days are coming to an end here at the doggybizkit and bubbles' house. I'm the only one awake right now except his dog "bizkit" and I don't know if I should let him out to go pee.  Just to let ya know that 56k modem really sucks but it better than nothing, actually I'm only logged it at 49.2k right now.  Nice and sunny for my ride back home so I'll be leaving shortly since I have to get my new scanner that's arriving by UPS today "can't wait". When I drove out here I did it in the dark and almost hit a big deer so I want to be able to see the mother fers this time before I get as close as last time.  Coffee is almost done...Yummy-yum!! Not the greatest coffee "Folgers" but it will do.  I understand dog if you read this. And dog good luck in the tattoo business now that your needles and other supplies are on the way.  After I leave here today I don't know when the next time I'll be able to get back so I hope that the dog and bubbles will make a road trip to my town sometime, I know you will. Don't forget to bring the tat stuff also, since we didn't do it here. To all the animals 3 cats, 2 ferrets, 2 dogs "one human", and a hamster, good luck getting along here.  I think they will since bubbles is very good with animals! So with that said I'm going to get some coffee and end this blog note for today ok "A" blog.

      Been awhile since it typed something here, nothing exciting happened since sat., except today I call into work and asked for the would week off and they said yes.  So at the spur of the moment I took a road trip about 200 miles away from home now.  Well I guess somethings when on this weekend, I bought Norton Systemworks 2004 and tried all weekend to install it correctly....lets see I installed then uninstalled it then reinstalled it then uninstalled it again then reinstalled it again then did a manual uninstall and royally fucked up my computer.  "Messed up the registry big time" couldn't do anything on it so this morning I reinstalled Windows XP and now everything is fine but I don't have any antivirus installed, just too fucking scared to install it one more time but I probably will but just the antivirus part of Systemworks.  What a waste of fucking money $99.00 for It plus I got the Personal Firewall and cant do nothing with it.  Well that's my bitch session.  Typing this out on Bubbles laptop at a place 200 miles away but not because I needed to come here to do it, it's party time with the Doggybizkitss and Bubbless so latersssss Blogssss "cute huh" gotta love the sssss'sss doggy like speakin' in tounges and shit "get er' dones"

      Time for a change:  I've been off this blogy thing for awhile now since my computer has been acting up, but since you see this new post it's working for now until tonight when I'm going to completely erase my hard drive and start anew with WindowsXP Professional.  Maybe this will solve some of my computer crashes that I've been having.  My friend Scott will be here a little after 7pm and that's when I'll start the deletion.  Wish me luck and bye for now.    No wait try the Shake Me button on the bottom of this page "don't get scared"

Ex wife is somewhat off my case, the kid is cruzin' through the school year, snow is melting and time to dig out the golf clubs soon (ye haw), work still sucks as usual but gettin' er done, and doggy bizkit's spider molted last month (precious) and (My Mistress) my spider will soon be doing the same hopefully this month.  Things are good, could be worst, but reality is always there! Bye blog

      This is cool got to come home last night!  I haven't got to do this in awhile, usually once I leave for the week I don't see home until the weekend.  But now it's 8:15am and I have to check in to work at 9am actually be there at 9am.  Maybe I'll get a long run somewhere but usually when they know I come home they send me on a run that delivers the same day so I'll be busting my ass off all fucking night.  Here's a funny link you can check out you non bloggers  urlLink   Yea, well shit, don't know what else to say today so I guess I'll get on with the day Fuck work, fuck work, so I say maybe tomorrow will be a better day.

      Holy shit got home on Friday at 3am in the morning didn't get to sleep until 5am then woke up at 10am stayed up until 4am Saturday morning then woke up at 8am to drive my kid home then caught a 2.5 hrs nap that afternoon about 4pm then went back to sleep at 2am last night now I'm awake again at 10am...........(did you get it)?  Pretty weird weekend!  My system is all screwed up since the clock went ahead 1hrs too.  Fuck now I have to drive to Naperville, IL today and leaving at about noon.    Time; It's all about time, one day your one time one day your late. Sleepy all the time, tired of the time so it's time to be right. Cant' figure out time, time rules my life so make up time. Get with the times, or not with the times that is the question. Am or pm it's all the same, just another day to keep track of time. Wish there was no time, why you ask because it's all about time.  Stupid things that come into my fucking head huh?  Don't know if it's poems or random thoughts? So I type them, write them down, say them sometime, it's all the same.....stupid shit on a different day, that's what goes through the boring life of a packrat I guess, time to leave to blog another day.

      Dude can you say I'm getting a Dell?  Yep I am, why am I saying this on a blog....I don't know why, some people or friends of my read this from time to time.  Yea got bored sitting out here at the doggybizkits house and just ordered it.  An it's a laptop too, that's why I did what I did, playing around on the doggybizkit's lapper got me real interested it getting one.  So sitting here 200 miles away from home, drinking beer at night and doing nothing special during the day, but back to work Monday morning........sux the work that is!  I've really gotten to know bubbles the dogs girl friend (soul mate...hehehe) a lot this week-end, as well as her friends we went and partied with last night.  It was so fun to be out in the country sitting by a bom fire cooking hotdogs, drinking beer, socializing and hey I ate my very first smore that was done with fire, before that it was just Poptart Smores.  Stayed up until 5am talking to bubbles friend I'll just call her "T" and I'm so fucking tired since we got up at 9am and came back to the house here in western MN.  Now where ordering T-bone steaks and they better be good for the price where getting them at, "take out can you believe it".  I'll let you know in a later blog report!!  Gotta eat soon, dog and bubbles just left to get-em 2:10pm. I'll be chowing down soon then maybe just maybe I'll get so full I can take a nap.  You know just like after thanksgiving, shove it down the pie hole and sleep it off afterward.  I need more SLEEP.    Keep sleep alive:  Sleep all day. Sleep all night... Sleep all right. Sleep today Sleep tomorrow... Sleep tonight. Just keep sleep alive!  See they just pop into my head, don't know why they just do the stupid mother f'ers.  Well food is almost here so time to chow blog!

      This is a weird day, everything I planned so far has changed, what you might wonder just everything.  Breakfast with my work friends, some didn't show.  Then was suppose to go to a movie but didn't yet because my kid all of a sudden remembered she had to be a dance class for practice for competition.  So now I'm still going to a movie NASCAR 3D at the Omni Max.  Should be pretty cool....I hope, since I'm not really a Nascar fan but do watch it and play in a fantasy league, it should be alright! Doggy saw your post, keep it up!  See there is all kinds of things to type about, just look at my boring life of a packrat :) Gotta run kid is waiting to be picked up, bloggy out!!!!

      Oh yes, the steak was good.  Probably the best I've had from a restaurant in a long time.  Dog yours rock too by the way!  Just have to cook-em and not leave them in the fridge until the go bad...hehehe. Didn't get anything done this week end of travel, just hung out.  Wanted to get a CB installed, tattoo work done some more, play some golf, but the drinking' was fun since I haven't got to do that in a while.  Maybe next time? So here I sit back at home looking at the clock (it's 11:10pm) and I should get to bed since I have to get up at 6am to get ready for work again.  Just an easy run to start of the week, well it's a local delivery but I could be there a couple of hours waiting to get unloaded.  So it does SUCK as usual but I have to do some running around while I'm getting unloaded.  Like goto the bank since I spent all my money and didn't have time to go there when I got back tonight and go get some food for the week so I don't starve, well I could lose a few pounds, but hell I'm fucking hungry now and it's 11:14pm but I guess I'll go without food until sometime tomorrow afternoon, maybe just a pop tart in the morning.  Shit I wish for another one of them t-bones I had yesterday right now, but .....shit forget it! So, time to cruse to bed and back to the sucky truck driving job tomorrow, maybe I'll get lucky and get to come home during the week....yea right....it's getting pretty rare these day's but I never know? So thanks doggybizkit and bubbles for letting me crash at your place this weekend and I hope you guys find a new place soon!  Don't let things get ya down, things will get better some day, God I hope, you guys need a fucking break.  Good Luck!!!!  Again some time blogie "See ya :)"

      Well Jr. didn't win yesterday, doggybizkit's boy won "Jeff Gordon" I guess that's the only way he can win this year is under a yellow flag....hehehehe.  Hey I'm home right now....wow.....don't have to be down to MPLS until 6am tomorrow so I'll leave here at about 8pm, at least that gives me 7hrs of rest time "like it should be".  My cuz gave me a ride home from where I parked my truck and I offered her a grit and she said "nope I'm on the patch", really I said and how long has it been, well must only be one day because she was smokin' up a storm at the casino the other night.  But she said, "I've never had so many wild dreams in my life".  Yep, that's what happens to you when your on the patch I told her.  It almost makes me want to try again just because the dreams are so fucking wild and I can remember them too!  But not this week because still have a carton an a half to finish, then I'll probably go get another and another...hehe boo hoo.....  Driving down this lonely road smokin' grits and singing songs. Wondering where I'm going to next  and wondering where I've been. Sometime I'll get home.  Pretty much my life while at work.  As for the singing songs, I do sometimes when I get sick of listing to books on tape.  Not this week though because I have part II and III of The Dark Tower series by Stephen King.    So I'll let this blog end for the day now and just say "chow for now"

      Reality is winning, yep after the Nascar 3D movie went to chow a Sammy's Pizza buffet then went to the casino "House of Sin" and finally walked out of there a winner.  It took me one hundred dollars to win two hundred dollars in four hours, not bad huh? Now back to my job, yep the truck driving job....have to leave again today after the race, really sux because it's only 210 miles and I have to leave 13.75 hrs ahead of time because of the rule's where I work at, and I'm not too happy :(  If it was under 200 miles I wouldn't have to leave until my deliver time of 7am 3.75 hrs.  Get it everyone who reads this, probably not but that's how it is.  Part of it has been the new dot hours of service I think I wrote about earlier "check archives".   Com-on Jr. win this race at Talladega, AL.    Writing here some times is weird. Typing stuff out about my life.  Putting it in words can be hard, but hey what else is there to do.  Bla bla bla blog writing here is like a job Bla bla bla blog  Hey good bye for another week! Blogger Bla!

      Home home on the rage or at least in the rat hole...hehehe!  Playing on my new lapper all morning, getting it set up just the way I like it to be.  That suxs Nascar doesn't start until 2pm my time.  Gotta leave my comforts of the rat hole to go buy some stuff for the lapper "Thats my name for it"  The Packrat's Lapper.  Neat huh!  Well what ever Big Daddy.  He didn't understand what a lapper is, duh!  It's a FUCKING NOTEBOOK!!!!! Ok I will stop venting on Big Daddy, he's a truck driver too that works where I work.  So the kid just called me to pick her up at the mall and then buy her stuff "as usual"  Kid's are too expensive!  So calling in at 1:30 on Monday to see what fun I can get into driving down the road...ie where the fuck I get to start off for the week!  I stayed out from Sunday at 5pm to Saturday noon.  Six fucking days for 2900 miles, which can be done in 4-5 days.  But it wasn't too bad of a week, everything was easy to find, but the ride back from Indianapolis sucked big time on a Friday afternoon.  Could have been worse if I would have cruised through Chicago rush hour, but I avoided it by 70 miles out of route.  My friend Snuffy is going to sell me a router so I can hook both the lapper and the home computer on the same line, when I hope?  Tonight would be nice, but he's working until 7pm and usually goes to sleep right after work.  Just called him but now answer, but left a message.  Maybe you read this blog Snuffy.....(call me tonight!!!)  Rhymes are rhymes that's all they are where they go they go very far as far as far they go sometimes  they just come into my head all the time Weird stuff all the time weird because there fucking rhymes where this one is going i do not know just typin' the shit out just like "hey let's go" typin' as fast as i can type, type, type, the letters just fly  what the fuck is going on here well ba-bye.  Wow blog what are you doing to my mind. I think i'm really freakin' out so see ya next time!

      This is different:  New style of publishing the blog today and a whole new outlook to the home page.  Don't know if this is going to be easier to use like the old one but we'll give it a try.  My Blog really hasn't changed yet.  Just not enough time on the weekends to tinker with it like adding pictures and other stuff.  So for now it will just be text.  So got home on Thursday and off until I hope Monday since I'll be in St.Paul, MN at my kids dance competition "Star Quest".  I wish her the best since this is probably going to be the last dance competition she'll be in since she's going to quit for a while, maybe forever, who know with her.  What ever is next I don't know but it will probably cost more money then dance lessons.  Still trying to get my network working right.  I can't seem to get printer and file sharing to work.  I don't know if a router is the same thing as a hub.  I think it is and I think I'm just not making the right setting or something, so it's really driving me fucking nuts.  But I can get on-line with both computers.  Just found out this weekend that my cuz's friend, I'll call her "miss perfect" no thats not nice, maybe "miss tan" yea that will work, is getting back with her ex-hubby.  Why-o-why would that DUMB ASS do such a thing like, yea I'm talking about the ex-hubby.  I don't think it will last too long, well long enough for Miss Tan to move back in for about 5 weeks then they'll split again.  Miss Tan just likes to play the field too much.  I think in the last three months there must have been about five or eight boyfriends pass through her door or pants or whatever.......It just ain't going to last.  If she's reading this or my cuz take it for what's it's worth "you know it's true" at least some of it!!!  Here ya go, i'm thinking, i'm thinking again, i'm so bored....random thoughts in my head, just have to type this next thing out, type it as fast as I can, because if I don't all will be lost, so here we go with this one thought..........  ************************************************************************ Good-Bye:  Where did we go wrong What happened to us  We used to care so very much But now we've lost touch  It had to end for everyone's sake But this pain inside I just can't shake  You hurt me in ways I had never felt before There were times when I would pray to god on the floor  Please make this work Please make this last  But then I realized we were already in the past Our love had faded away, it would never last  So we said our good byes Had our very last good bye kiss ************************************************************************  With that weird poem said,  straight out of my head. I'll end this blog, with nothing else till when? Who know's...who cares...the boring life of a packrat, will still be here!

      It's Sunday again and nothing to do except waiting to go back to work.  Leaving tonight for a short run to New Hope, MN.  Really don't have to leave until 5am tomorrow morning but will probably leave tonight to get rested enough for the week of pure hell since it's going to be a short one anyways.  I should be done buy at least Thursday night or early Friday morning since my kid has a dance competition done in the twin cities this weekend.  It should be fun again, just like last time hanging with the ex-wife.  NO nothing went on there, just have too because of the kid. Went out to the bar Friday night and got really wasted, not as bad as Snuffy though.  He cut out early, totally wasted i guess.  Everyone there was wasted.  The only one I guess that wasn't really wasted was snuffy's sister.  She and her mom and snuffys aunt and my cuz went to Country Kitchen afterward to chow down.  Fuck it was 4am by the time I got home, but about 5am I started getting sick or something from the food I ate that night.  I ran to the bathroom to shit and really couldn't.  I don't know why I couldn't it just wouldn't come out, ya know all fucking plugged up or something "must have been the cheese sticks" but while sitting there started get the wet mouth like I was going to puke too.  All that kept me up until 5:30am, never puked and never shit, I just went back to bed feeling like shit.  But when I woke up I felt pretty good and just got on with the day.  Did nothing until last night.  About 4pm went to eat pizza buffet again like every week.  "Been eating pizza buffet every Saturday now for about 3 months never missing a week"  After that went to the House of Sin (casino) with my cuz and played bingo but didn't win. Now sitting here with the kid and her friend Missy May, she hates being called that but I have to have a nick-name for everyone.  The spent the night here driving me nuts with there stuff they do.  Always on the phone with there boyfriends, and wanting to use this computer.  But I did get my network all set up and it works fine, but I don't know how to transfer files from one to the other. With that I'll end this blog entry and say "Blog-blog?"

      I have to make this one quick:  My kids dance competition this weekend went great, except I don't know yet how she did last night since I had to come home early to go to work this morning.  I hope her trio won 1st place!  I'll have to call later today to find out I guess.    It's a really shitty day outside today.  Raining all night long and it's still raining this morning at 6:40am. Better than snow though.  But really sux when I get into muddy areas to have to hook and unhook my trailer, but I'll "deal with it".  So time to work again and I'll say bye, B_L_O_G_G_E_R

      Hey I'm home and it's Wednesday! Don't know what I'm going to do with all my time but I'll try to use all of it.  Probably have to leave to work on Saturday now which will really suck.  Alot of drivers went home before me so there is a chance that I won't.  But I will find out on Saturday when I call in at noon.   So, to start I'm cooking a pizza right now to chow then I'm going to my kids quire concert at her school tonight at 6pm after that I think I'll come home and work on a new design to this web blog.  But my cuz might goto the house of sin or go out drinking tonight.  I could use a beer or a case of beer...hehehe!  No driving doggy :)  Don't worry about that to all that don't know about the doggybizkit.  He is a friend that got busted and lost his job because of it.    Well the pizza is done so I'm ending this short maybe some later blog.

      Lot's of sin this week end, wowee!  Went to the casino 2 times.  The first time started with $43.00 and left with $160.00.  The second time went with $140.00 and left with $80.00.  So you see I'm still ahead.  With the $80.00 dollars I have left I'm buy a bed from my mom, so I'll get something for my money.  I know It's weird buying a used bed, I thought I never would but hell It's like brand new.  I did the gram-ma smell test and it doesn't smell.  It smells new even though it's about 10 years old.  My mom always kept rubber sheets under the regular ones.  Why I don't know but it kept the bed new and smelling new. No all you sick fuckers my mom doesn't pee the bed, she's just knows how to take care of the things she owns.  So It's been raining all week end and I'm waiting for it to stop so I can go pick it up.    Going to Thunder Bay ON., for tomorrow moring....ya know it fucking sux!! Like I haven't said that before.  But going into another country these days really does sux.  Not so bad going into Canada but it's coming back for Canada to the good old USA that sux.  They think I'm a fucking criminal everytime now.  Checking my ID and shit.  I suppose one of these times there going to rip my truck apart looking for whatever.  Other drivers say it's the tattoo's that I have now "Thank you Doggy", that I get so much shit at the borders, well I say fuck that it's just me and I'll just have to "deal with it".  Nothing else to say today so I'll end this with one question in mind...... WHERE THE FUCK IS SUMMER?

      Happy birthday to my kid yesterday and today is her party.   Raining again this weekend but I did get out golfing yesterday.  Shot 3 over par for 9 holes. Pretty good for the first time this year.  Got my DOT physical on Monday to go to, so no work until after that. Whatever to say here I'm lacking lately and just not in the mood to type stuff i guess so another one short here.  Doggy what's going on? You never write in your blog either!  Bye

      Five days off and working on six. Back at it tomorrow. O-well it's been raining so much might as well go back to work.  Got my kid's science project done anyways.  Building a Trebuchet.  Pretty tricky shit to build but we got it done and it works.  Now I think I'm going to build a full scale size trebuchet.  www.trebuchet.com is a good web page for designs.  Or just search trebuchet in a google search, and you'll find all kinds of stuff about it and the competitions too.  Ending short again blog,....bye

      Damn it's been awhile since I've wrote here.  What to say?  Donno!  Just stuff I guess?   Let me just start out that my kid is now 13yrs old and the stuff is already starting to happen with a teenager.  God please help me!!  I won't write here about what has happened so I'll let all you readers of this boring blog to guess.  Some of my life is private and some is not.   Been playing alot of domino's on www.pogo.com lately with my friend in Florida.  Maybe some of you readers will find me there.  Intherathole is what you should look for to find me.  Good luck if I do meet you there. Again Doggybizkit is way behind on his blog, so I think he's just given up on it.  I would like to read more so listen up dog, "com-on type something". Leaving today to work....yee haw...yea right...after my kids dance recital at the DECC.  Which will make me late in leaving and I'll get 4 points.  What are points?  Well it's just like getting written up at a normal job but where I work when the point total up to "I think" 34 or 36 then you get fired.  I have none at this time but after this week I'm sure I'll have 4.  Fuck-em, I need some anyways!  That way they'll stay off my back for awhile.  Enough of the job thingy for now...let's move on to something else:  FUCKING BURNING ONE Sitting here smoking a fucking grit thinking of when I should fucking quit.  Watching it burn so fucking slow thinking of where to fucking blow.  Blowing it out of my fucking mouth just sitting here on my fucking couch.  Why have I done this so fucking long better than smoking a fucking bong.  Bongs are better if you fucking don't get caught so i smoke the fucking grits to clear my thoughts.  My thoughts are weird to fucking clear sometimes so someday fucking I'll quit and save my dimes.  Money is fucking what it's all about if you have none then fucking your out.  Fucking out of my mind, out of my head fucking smoking a grit will make me dead.  So maybe I should quit these fucking smoking sticks and try something else to make me fucking sick.  I'm sick of trying to fucking always quit these stinky little fucking smoking grits.    THAT'S ALL FOLKS ITS THE END BLOG IS DONE  SEE YA AGAIN!!!

      Time to quit:  Been working too long at this job of mine, driving all day and into the night. Driving down the road wondering when I'll get home, maybe someday pretty soon. Boring sometimes and sometimes not, life on the road has took everything I got. I would like to work at a regular job by my home, maybe I'll quit driving so I wont be alone. So when that day comes to call it quits, I'll think of all the bad shit I had to deal with.  Remember the "Deal with it" quote I've said in past blogs, well I don't know if I can anymore.  This job is pissing me off so fucking much, lately.  So much I don't even know what to write here.  So, another weekend shot to hell by my work and there 44 1/2 hrs off bull shit.  I tried to lie, in fact I did on my logs.  Got in Friday at 9pm but couldn't legally be in until Saturday about 8am, and I thought I wouldn't have to go back until at least Monday afternoon...but here I sit and write in this blog and should be sleeping right now since I have to get up at fucking 3am to be out the yard by 4:30am to go 164 miles to St. Paul, MN.  Deal with it yea I'm fucking trying too.  You truckers out there reading this probably think that a lot of time off, what the fuck am I bitching about?  Well, I'll tell you "I need MORE FUCKING TIME OFF" plain and simple!  My kid needs me around right now a lot with some issues that I will not get into here (sorry readers).  I'm done venting for now and I'm going to try to get some sleep so I'm fucking bright eyed for the 3am bull shit.........bye!!!!

      Here I am made the trip to the doggybizkits house out west in MN again.  Sitting here drinking coffee and waiting to go golfing this time like last time. But I think we are actually going since I made a tee time for about 2pm.  After that it's tattoo time I think, will see?  Listening to Johnny Cash while I'm typing this out...oh boy!  It's fucking hot and muggy here too.  Enough of this I don't know what else to write.  Maybe I'll come up with something later.

      Coffee in the morning:   Drinking coffee all morning long, listening to the birds sing there song.  Out on my deck in the early morning light, the squirrels awake and start to fight.  People going to church on this fine morning, as the clouds darken they don't take warning.  The wind starts to blow from out of the west, people dressed up in their Sunday best.  The birds and squirrels stop what their doing, look to the sky a storm is brewing.  Blowing and raining so hard I fear, I can feel it coming the end is near.  Watching the clouds spin their awful fury, I'm going inside now in a hurry.  I pour me another fresh brew in my hand, outside I go to watch it all end.  Birds and squirrels dieing in my eyes, I hear the people call their cries.  Death and destruction is what I see, all around the light finally reaches me.  Coffee this morning brought me many things,  for tomorrow what will my coffee bring.

      Happy 4th of July.  No tattoo work done yet on my here at the doggy bizkits house. This is the third time I've been out here since he moved, I hope I can get this finished up sometime, because everyone keeps asking me about it!  I don't like to push the dog into doing it since he's doing it for nothing, well I have gotten him some booze and other things for the work he's doing on me, I just wish he'd just say it's my turn someday? But I did get him to pierce my ear which didn't go so well.  I was bleeding like crazy and the dog let bubbles finish the job and now it's in. It's almost noon here and I'm leaving tonight about 4 or 5 pm and everyone is still crashed probably because they all got drunk after I went to bed at about 3am.  I see a bottle of Southern Comfort sitting on the computer desk next to me.  Dog or bubbles it was fun anyways even if my leg didn't get finished this weekend. I've learned a lot more about you two and your friends each time I come out here, so I hope you don't take offence to some of the comments here in this blog or things I've said to you this weekend....ya know the stuff I told you last night while we where sitting around about making time for sleep and getting organized in life better.  You two are really great friends of mine and I hope that never changes due to things I might say or do.  Yea I do and say some weird things sometimes and end up regretting a lot that later, but I don't think the hole coming up with a plan thing is dumb.  It will work if you let it okay.  Life is just one big plan and goal to get through, if you don't plan your day and set goals then nothing gets done, either your job, sleep, household chores, whatever comes your way there will be time for those moments.  Make time for each of you also individually as well as for friends that stop by.  Set rules to stick by and the madness will slowly cease.  You have to start somewhere.  Dog as for the tat business, one on one will work and save you time and more money in your pocket.  I know you like to talk but when there's 5 or more people chatting with you while your doing one that bring your productivity down along with your concentration to get'em done that's what I mean by the one on one.  This is what I have noticed everytime I'm here, and hey I'm not perfect either, nobody is!  But planning out and getting things in order in life and your career will make it a lot better for both of you and your business and job. As for me and my job that's another question I still hate it.  But I do plan each day out and make time for my self and sleep.  Just like when I knew I was done this week my plan went into action with only 2 hours to do it to get ready.  That's because I knew about it and planned for it way ahead of time so I would be ready at any moment.  Even bringing EM with really was in the plan from the get go and if it didn't work out on the day when it finally came o-well, but I planned it out from everything like paying my bills before I left to doing my fucking clothes so I wouldn't have to do them when I got back to meeting EM so everything would go smooth, and it did!  Planning and goals to me go hand in hand, if I didn't make them nothing I do would get done and I would not be sitting here on your computer typing this.  So with all that said I should end:  Bye bye bye blog.

      Didn't a new cell phone today, instead my cuz did but by mail or I think Fed Ex or something.&nbsp; Boring day today:   1.&nbsp; I was going to go get a phone   2.&nbsp; I was going to a movie   3.&nbsp; I was going to get some new piercing for the ears   4.&nbsp; I was going to go eat pizza   5.&nbsp; I was going to go golfing   666.&nbsp; I was going to fuck off all day and did anyway!!!   Things did get done though, like buying some new shoes for the old feety's and some household supplies....thanks cuz for driving me around!   My kid and her friend "Missy May" are here so I'm using the lapper in the bedroom, "hey I'm in the bedroom"&nbsp;no wait can't do anything anyways-what's the use?&nbsp;&nbsp;Really nice outside today and didn't do a dam thing, I should&nbsp;have went golfing&nbsp;but oh well.&nbsp; Maybe I'll go to the house of sin tonight and spend so more money that&nbsp;I don't have because of last week (read earlier post to get the info on that adventure).   Just got out of the bathroom trying to put a different earring in my new hole of the right side&nbsp;cartilage "thanks doggy for the pain",&nbsp;&nbsp;but couldn't&nbsp;yet get a loop through the hole so I went back to just the stud&nbsp;that was put&nbsp;in.&nbsp; No wait I&nbsp;guess It's a different stud "I forgot" but a stud anyways.&nbsp; No blood this time, but fuck I want a fucking loop in there.&nbsp; Maybe I'll go down to the tat shop and have them do it, "sorry doggy".&nbsp; I would have bubbles do it since she did such a great job the first time but you guys never&nbsp;come to town.    Nothing to say :   Nothing to&nbsp;say today  say today nothing to do,  just say nothing to say  is what I'll do ,   I said it before  I'll say it again,  something but what  but what about something,  just say nothing  that's what I'll do.   Okie dokie ba-bye blogie

      Do I like it? no....what's this about?  Donno, just random thoughts again and things I see.&nbsp; Right now I'm seeing blurriness cause I'm so tired.&nbsp;   Why&nbsp;would you drink the new coca cola "C2" and what ever the Pepsi one is called.&nbsp; Drink diet soda and get no carbs right?&nbsp; Doesn't make much sense!  Cell phones suck!&nbsp; Plane and simple!&nbsp; If you forget it at home you go back for it...why that's why you left it there in the first place.&nbsp;  If they ring you look at it like you've never seen it before...why it's just a phone!&nbsp; Most people can't stop looking to see if got any text messages.&nbsp; People that text are&nbsp;in the&nbsp;same&nbsp;city from you in the first place so call them on your phone and then your fingers won't hurt from all that typing. I have a cell phone, do I do this stuff too....yep everything except the texing...but I hate when someone leaves me a message just saying "what's up dude"....that pisses me off some times, also that little icon drives me nut's so I have to check it to get it to go away. Why have a cell phone?&nbsp; Work, chat with friends, listen to the EX bitch in my ear....that's why I have one.&nbsp; I can leave mine at home, but not when I goto work because I use it alot there for getting directions and stuff.&nbsp; So tomorrow I'm going to maybe get a new one?&nbsp; Yep me and the cuz are going to the store to look at them.&nbsp; Mine works fine but it's boring me to death.&nbsp; Just need to change!&nbsp; My cuz needs a new one really bad, her screen is all fucked up and she can't read the text messages that she receives and sends....too bad cuz!&nbsp; Hope you can get one on warranty issues for free :)  Ring, ring, ring "Hello is anyone there?"  Flip it open  turn it on ring ring&nbsp;ring look at the pretty thing hello is anyone there i can't hear you cell is bad flip it closed ring ring ring the dam phone thing.  Ok thats pretty stupid but true! So I'll end this post with one thing on my mind:&nbsp;   "Drink your soda pop and make your calls"  whatever&nbsp;is "  reality"&nbsp;

      Interesting weekend I've had;  &nbsp;  Let's see got drug tested on Thursday at work "nothing to worry about there", then packed up to go on a mini vacation to Shakopee, MN. on Friday.&nbsp; While at Shakopee I stayed at Mystic Lake Casino and lost about $500.00 the first night!&nbsp; Then in the morning I went to Valleyfair all day on about 4 good hours sleep, and boy I did try to take a nap during the hottest part of the day but really couldn't.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;Saturday night stayed at the casino and dropped I think about $100.00 more, hell I don't even know anymore what the fuck I did.&nbsp; I have to figure that out next weekend when I get back, because&nbsp; I just got home and it's 11:00 pm on Sunday and I'm too tired and have to get up at 5 am to goto work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good night blog

      Saved a baby robin this week while at work, yea I did.....I was going into this rest area down by Mauston, WI and when I went into the door there was this baby robin stuck up against the window "it just kept fluttering up against the window" so I went in and took a pee and on my way out it was still there.  So I walked up to it and very slowly cupped my hands around each side of the bird not to startle it in anyway and then snatched it up.  Then I brought it to a nearby bush and gently put it on it.  It looked at my "like thanks packrat" and then flew away.  As I turned around this hot chick was watching the hole thing going on and told me I was very nice to do something like that.  I said, "it wasn't getting very far in the predicament it was in" (then we went back to the truck and had some awesome sex for three hours and then she left) just kidding,  I went back to my truck and felt very good for doing my helpful deed for the day or I guess month or year whatever.  Doggy Bizkit moved this weekend to a new place "Congrats" you finally found somewhere else to move.  Maybe I'll get my cuz to cruse us up there for the house warming party next weekend!  I hope you can get on-line soon :) Found a cool place to buy cheep earrings  urlLink http://www.freakrings.com  I ordered some new ones last sunday and they are here in lest then a week.  Only 7.98 for two horseshoe earring's that's with shipping too.  I'm going to buy a opener at Hot Topic in a little bit and remove my old capture earrings and put these in today.  I have a hole truck load of laundry to do too and other stuff this morning so I better get busy and do it.

      Happy Birthday Cuz!  Yea you where really drunk last night, I hope you had fun..My ears hurt from all the noise at the stock car races too. It was fun, I just wish I could have gotten drunk too. Well I could have and felt like shit this morning and my work would have known. Maybe next weekend I'll do it with the dog and you cuz.  So off to work and maybe I'll find a place to post messenges here on the road since I'm online now in my truck but only at certain truck-stops. But there are a lot of them to do it at.  Gotta run for now work starts at 11am boo-hoo blog!
