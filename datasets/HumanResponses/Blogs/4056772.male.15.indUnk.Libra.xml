      so after thursday's catastrophy and chatting with greg until 4am, I have decided that I am really going to try and not let things get to me, cuz most of the time peope aren't that serious, and I'm ganna try and not overanalyze and just let things flow........cuz the way I was really sucks and messes up ur life.............I have a feeling this is going to be a new me

      yea so today sucked....in fact people suck!.......y can't people just tell you the truth? especially if they are your friends right? I just don't get why no one will let me be happy...I like Nicole but Steff hates me cuz I hook up with her.......she was all like "it's not my place" the other day but now she's back to this shit!.......I also like chilling with Heather, Brooke and Sommer but for some reason people tell me that they don't like me touching them.......that's bullshit cuz they said it right to my face they don't mind......w/e.........I just want the fucking truth u know what I'm saying?...........people suck..............I feel like everyone is using me.........trying to make themselves feel all goody goody when I don't................I am not a "people" guy.........I'm a one on one kinda guy.......but no, noone wants to be one on one with me.....BULLSHIT..............everyone has a problem with me don't they........

      Right, so I know that things could be worse and that I'm probably worrying about nothing, but I feel as if I don't belong anywhere and I don't know who I am.......I act completly different in groups......band group, berkowitz group, t or d group, and then one on one.....I truly feel I act my best when it's one on one......But I feel in groups I want some attention and if I don't do something stupid, or annoying, or something on those lines that I don't get any attention and I'm on the outside of the group.........also, I feel like the only thing that makes me happy are girls......the trumpet makes me kinda happy but it's not like when I'm down my first thought is the trumpet.......I don't know why I analyze everything and take everything serious and expect the manners that I give everyone else.....I don't know why I am cursed with wanting to be a gentleman and not getting the same in return.......I wish I was born in the years of chivalry....I don't know what to do...........Sometimes I feel like this is one of the worst summers I've had....I know I've met some cool people but so much shit has happened and I don't know how to react.......
