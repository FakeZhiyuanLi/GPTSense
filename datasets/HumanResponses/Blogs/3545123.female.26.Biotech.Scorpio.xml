      so last night we ate dinner and then pete and i went to 12 galaxies to see his work homie's band play.  i had never been to 12 galaxies before..it was pretty nice.  they have a few table seats and a large floor, cute stage and a whole 2nd floor where you can see the band or play pool or video games and more seating up there.  his friend's band wilfred e eye was  pretty good...too bad the place was pretty empty.  pete only knew the one guy and so we proceeded to make awkward conversation with him until the show started(it was suggested by pete that only i felt it was awkward and that in fact there was normal conversation being had). whatever, i felt shy and uncomfortable so of course i proceeded to down a rum and coke, a pbr, another rum and coke, and then a rum and pinapple.  i got wasted.  when we left there were various suggestions by me that we continue partying...that we go get some falafel and some hopes that my boss would hire a fun girl who lives in the city for our open spot on our team so that i would have a buddy to party with on wednesday and thursday nights.  all these suggestions were met with a slow head shake no by pete and a patronizing  smile. tight.  i also remember after pete driving me home me trying to get him to race me to my house...i bolted down my street jumping over giant planters as if they were hurdles.  To my credit, i cleared all the planters quite gracefully but my cell phone came flying out of my bag and broke into 4 pieces on the sidewalk.  i thought that was pretty funny.  i would also like to state for the record that this morning is the first time this week that i did NOT wake up with a horrible headache needing to down 3 advil first thing in the morning.  Therefore, getting wasted must be good for my head.

      so yesterday was my day off...i spent it cleaning my kitchen and sending various ridiculous emails back and forth with my work homies.  now it has been suggested that elon and i are losers simply because we check our work email from home.  i would like to say these things in our defense.  1. i spend my first day off (if im lucky it is thursday...usually i end up working a full ten hour day on my thursdays off and my first day off ends up being friday) decompressing cos work takes a lot out of me and i never get enough sleep. so i spend the day hanging out in my underwear cleaning my house (its so neglected during the week its kind of a hell hole by friday), watching tivo and checking my regular email (cos they cut off our access at work. fuckers.)  my dsl connection at home is always on and it is no big deal for me to walk by my desk and press reload and quickly check my work email throughout the day.  2. our department is split into two teams...a sun-wed team and a wed-sat team. theoretically the only overlap day is wed so we communicate mostly through email.  elon and i are working on the same projects and we are on seperate teams so we do a lot of emailing back and forth to keep eachother updated. 3. i get like 30 work emails a day. in theory three whole days could go by with me not at work and emails building up. i hate that shit.  i would prefer to read and respond to emails right away rather than when they are probably irrevelent. in addition it fucking pisses me off when someone doesn't read their email right away and gets back to me a week later so i wouldn't ever do that shit to someone else. 4. people in other departments are constantly forgetting that i do not work on thursdays and fridays and will send me emails on those days expecting immediate responses ok, so maybe i am a loser. what the fuck ever
