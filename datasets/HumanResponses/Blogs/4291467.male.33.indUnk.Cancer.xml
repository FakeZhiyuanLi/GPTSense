      My wife, Andrea, decided she wants a Great Dane, so we visit a rescue dog today and end up bringing her back. She is called Diva and is a 3 year old Dane, coming from a family who didnt want her anymore due to children. I thinks dogs are OK, I am not a great dog lover, my preference being felines. Yea, I do love cats over dogs anyday, because they are much more independent than dogs, less messy (I mean they do their business in other peoples gardens which cant be bad, cant it...er..) and tell you want they want a cuddle or attention. So we went to Aylesbury to pick up this Dane, which took us all day. Lovely. On the way their we had to stop at nearly every service station because little Harvey wanted to use the toilet. All in all a very boring day out, which ended up with another mouth to feed. Fantastic.  There is some debate going on over at comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg about John Cusak being anti-war, which has ended up being a debate about Blair and his creationist views. Pretty interesting how a conversation ends up, dont you agree?  Games I am playing: Currently on my third re-run of Baldurs Gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal expansion. I think this is probably my favourite computer game of all time, due to the intelligent dialogue, moral choices and great gameplay (with a romance subplot which is just a great addition). I always err on the side of good in my RPG gaming, although in all probability when I was late teens I would most probably thought playing an evil character would have been the way to go, but life changes you, as well as you get a bigger gaming experiance playing good.  I also finally got around to watching The Return of the King, the final part of Lord of the Rings movie triology. I found this to be a very moving end-movie to the trilogy, some fantastic battle scenes in it, which I found to be very emotional. Also, the special effects were just amazing, some of the best I have seen in a movie.  Without being a bore, it does skip a lot of events from the book, most noticable being the omission of Saruman from the scenes in Orthanc/Isengard. I gather that they will be in place with the special edition of the film. All in all though, I did enjoy the movie trilogy, it was very well done where it could have been total poo. I read LotR when I was 12/13 and was hooked as a child, probably due to my vivid imagination. It started me reading all kind of fantasy fiction, which I did eventually grow out of for various reasons. I did re-read LotR again back in 2000, and also the Silmarillion afterwards which I had never done before. I do think that Silmarillion is probably the better book, but must be treated as a history rather than a novel. I do love that book now, and since re-read it not so long ago. I also tried to get back into fantasy fiction again, reading ' A Game of Thrones' by George RR Martin. I read the first book and started the second, but found it difficult to appreciate than I would have done in my teens. Perhaps I just have a too rational outlook on life, or cannot appreciate fantastic literature as I once did.

      This will be a delusional blog. I suffer from psychosis (i.e delusional thinking) from time to time, which basically makes me very inoperative. My current situation is that I am 33 years old, married to Andrea, and have a nearly 3 year old son called Harvey. I look after Harvey whilst Andrea works full time. This means I don't get out like I should. Harvey starts nursery in two weeks time, for a few hours a day, which is good as he will get better socialisation than I can give him.  Anyway, my skills lie in Computers, which the way I feel at the moment is not a good thing for me to do. I want to do more creative things, especially writing. Computers have taken up the last 8 years of my life, which in its essence I think has been wasted. C'est la vie. My real interests lie in literature, nature and social studies.  Now about my illness. I have a very debilitating illness which started around 1997, although I think has been hidden for quite a while. It hit me bad in '98 and I ended up in hospital with psychotic depression for a few months. These days I find it managable and it only hits me occasionally from time to time.  This blog will just detail my thoughts of the day. Cheers  Kevin
