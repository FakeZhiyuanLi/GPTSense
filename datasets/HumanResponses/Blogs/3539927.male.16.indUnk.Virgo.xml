      I have finally figured out what my life purpose is, to be famous. The reason i can't stand my family is because they don'thave any invision on life I will be the second of six to graduate from high school. The reason i am an outcast in my family is becauseno one around me can rise above being a loser. I don't find interest in all that i do but i do it anywayz because i try to occupy my time with things that are positive. Because it never seems to case that more and more people i am tied to somehow end up having kids adn being on drugs. I am soooo sick of being surrounded by people who aren't about anything. My mom never skips an oppurtunity to put me down and compare me to her golden child(my brother James) and nothing pisses me off more. I have gotten good grades since grade school and when I get to High Shcool when classes get normally harder and i don't get the top notch grades that i usually get i am the biggest failure and i will never amount to anything in my mom's words. I can never plaease this lady sh e makes my life a living hell sometimes but i am greateful for her because she gives me drive because i don't wanna be one of her statistics. But i am out YOUR IDOL  Michael   "I wanna be like MIKE" by Anonymous

      Hey everyone it's my fifth time haha i am nota virgin now to the everso exciting world of blogging. Well over the last few days i have a personal revelation cause i have had way too much time on my hands to think about myself adn it's kinda good i have had that time think. I have some people to talk to and take advice. I have made myself upset about little things like the endless amount of people thinking that i am gay, so what if i was i wouldn't change. That was a line from one of my "therapist" haha. But i dunno i have time to think andi am content with myself and i am not trying to get a point across but i just need some weight off my chest cause none of my "friends" would understand about bordem now would you well some of you would haha. But one the things going through my head was am i a selfish bastard why am i sooo upset lately and why can't i understand anything. Maybe it's the fact that my father aka sperm donor is a drunken bastard but there i go again blamin' everyone else. Thats just some of the things i made a joke with one of my freinds andd told them I was GAY and they said are you kidding and me being the person i was  saying of course i am and they said oh well I have known for a while. Me in shock fired back are you kidding you have got to be joking and they just said "WHAT" and i said that is awful and they said no it's not you may be gay but it's not going to change you as a person. I said thats right but if oyu think i could possibly be gay what do all my other freinds think of me so that s what i want to know what do you think of me leave a comment.  Oh and by the way Carly is a butch husky lesbian haha j/k love ya bye  Michael  PS Krystle i love you  I.M. Me: Nexamericaidol2
