      Last night i sorta had a mental break down or a panic attack mixed in w/ a side of  bein manic depressant. It was so not fun  i was soo angry i just wanted to blow sumthing up! This last year has been really tuff and it all just exploded. Having to deal w/ a death of my g/f the moving news and girls and emotions and responsibilty of acting as the father figure cuz my dads not home all week... it was just too much to handle in one year or should i say 5 months. Well anyways i took all my emotions out on my friend Brandi and i felt really terrible about doing that, im sorry! I just wish sumtimes i didn't exist.. sumtimes i think things would be better off w/ out me.

      Today was one of the most  happy days of my life. I asked my friend brandi to be my girl friend and she said yes! I  was so happy. I hope that are relationship turns out to be a great one becuase she is a really amazing person, and i would do anything for her. I know that im moving soon but im sure everything will work out fine. Plus 180 miles and 2 hours of driving  could neevr keep me from seeing her. Anyways i love ya Brandi PEACE OUT

      Well tod ay started off kinda dumb cuz of swim practice but after that it was amazing. I came home and talked to brandi and asked if she wanted to come over.. she did and we hung out watched some tube and listened to some musik. After that i went and pumpd some iron  and then ate dinner. After Brandi and i went rollerblading down by the river. It was so fun talking and lookin at all the puppies!  The only bad part of the nite was goin back  gettin bugs in our face and having to say goodbye.  Well hopefully 2marrow will be just as cool..**PEACE OUT**
