       Nine days liao.. She had not spoken a word to me at all.. No scolding.. No nothing.. Nothing at all.. Wat have i done to you.. And why did u not tell me or speak to me about how i offended u?? Haiz.. I sincerely apologised to you..    Ok.. Lets start from this morning.. Eh.. Lets see.. Morning run then D&T.. Wa.. D&T so damn sian until i nearly slept in the lab sia.. Got a bad news.. I have only 11/25 for D&T..  But well.. its expected since i didn study..    Then recess.. Ate something and went back to class.. Rushed some maths sums.. Continued during Sims lesson.. Then finally Potash lesson.. The OHP prob made Potash a little embarassed as there was another teacher..    At last, it was chinese.. Went through the chinese paper again.. Then Mr Tan told us some Ghost Story again.. This time about the Bishan Mrt Station..    "During the time period of 12am to 1am.. There is a train that isn from the Smrt transit.. It is called the DEAD TRAIN!! It looks similiar to the normal train but it is different.. A guy who was drunk went into the train one night.. As he was drunk, he did not look properly.. He walked in and stumbled on one of the seats.. He did not realise that the expressions of the faces were weird.. AS hes stop was Ang Mo Kio, it should be one stop away from Bishan station..  However, he realise that it was a little weird when he travelled for more than 10 minutes without any stops in between.. He asked the person beside hem..  The person turned.. And the sight was horrendous!! Half of it was rotten!! HE shouted and all the 'people' looked at hem and he quickly run towards the door.. Just then, the door opened and he ran out.. However, when he ran out, he fall into a pitch black area.. When he looked around, he realised that it was a cemetry.. It was LIM CHU KANG CEMETRY!! He ran for all hes life and stayed under it for the night.. The next day, he ran towards the main road.........."    After the chinese, went for lunch in canteen.. Then went back class for history test.. After that, went home.. Drank bubble tea..    And now, i am still typing and hoping that she would forgive me.. Byebyez my frienz.. Tc..
