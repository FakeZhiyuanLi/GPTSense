      Well thatâ€™s it. Its all over. After nearly seven years, its finished; born back in March 1997 Buffy: The Vampire Slayer was laid to rest on the 20th of May 2002 in the states. It leaves behind it a spin-off show, various comics and novels, a merchandising juggernaut, several spin-off possibilities and a legacy on television. As Joss Whedon said, "In years to come I believe this show will be remembered as a show that was on television." Well, you can't fault the man really. Starting as an average movie with some good ideas Buffy grew into it's place on television belting out seven seasons of wise cracking, bad-guy kicking action. Right, time to get this straight; starting with the worst and building up to the best I think the seasons went like this; 	Six - A stuttering season that doesn't really get going until the very end. The geek trio are largely irritating most of the time, while Giles is sidelined and Anya is reduced to comic relief and there is a lack of narrative drive through the series as a whole Four - The first year at college. Adam was cool but underused, the initiative didn't quite work but Oz's departure was well done. Two stand out episodes in it's favour, 'The Hush' & 'Restless'. And Riley was never as interesting as Angel. Pretty much distinctly average Buffy with the show's worst ever episode, 'Beer Bad'. Seven - The final season. For me the characters seem strangely off, especially Buffy who is just a bitch throughout. But kudos for a return to strong storytelling, Principle Wood, 'Lies My Parents Told Me', 'Conversations With Dead People', more Faith and Caleb is kinda cool. However Xander's sidelining is unforgivable, often the most rounded character in the show and they almost ignore him completely, (but his moment at the end of 'Potential' is well worth his pay for the year). Five - Second year at college. Although I never went for the Glory storyline the whole Dawn thing was surprisingly well done in it's execution. The season's mid place position betrays the fact it contains the show best work in 'The Body' Also increased Spike is always appreciated.  	Three - Faith! Simply the best thing about the season. Faith is one of the great characters of the show and her battle with inner demons is far more interesting than whatever the Mayor does. Much better when people go bad storytelling than season six's. Plus the great 'The Wish' and 'The Zeppo', however poorer episodes like 'Beauty and the Beasts' giving the feeling of padding at times. Long live Principle Synder 	One - Where it all began. The Master is simple one of the greatest villains committed to screen, Angel is mysterious, Giles is very British and Willow is geeky. Contains some of my all time favourite episodes, 'The Pack', 'The Puppet Show', 'Nightmares' and 'Prophecy Girl'. The best first series of a show in a long time (think of all those crappy first years of trek and B5.) 	Two - Spike! Dru! Angelus! Death! Murder! Mayhem!. Ah, the best year by far. The first half picks up where season one left off and then the second half of the season kicks in and it is truly very good indeed. The first time you saw 'Surprise/Innoce' and 'Becoming' were actually surprising, shocking and exciting. The mythology was deepened, the characters developed, the action pumped up. Yes, the ante was upped and the show never quite reached that high again.   My favourite characters? Well they are Faith, Dru, The Master, Mr Trick, Oz, Cordy oh and some bit part guy called Spike. And of course Angelus!   And so we wait for Angel (before you ask, in ascending order 4,1,3,2) season five (green lit at time of writing) and await eagerly to see what comes next in the Buffyverse.
