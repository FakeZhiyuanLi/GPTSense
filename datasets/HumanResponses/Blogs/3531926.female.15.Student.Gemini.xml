      I wish i was a glow- worm,  a glow-worms never glum, coz how can u be sad, when the sun shines out your bum!?!  if im in heaven before you are, ill write your name on every star, so everyone on earth can see, how much you really mean to me.  some people think its wads of cash  that makes life all worthwhile, but what REALLY makes the world go round, is a SUPER SMASHING SMILE!  If i could be anything i would be your tears, so i could be born in your eyes, live on your cheeks, and die on your lips.  one side of you is happy, one side of you is sad, sometimes you will be angry and sometimes you'll be glad. but if you bring it all together, your true colours will shine through, to be your very own person, thats what makes you YOU!  my eyes reacted, my mind was attracted, my heart was affected, thousands were rejected, but you were selected.  neva give up if you still wanna try, neva wipe your tears if you still wanna cry, dont settle for no answer, if you still wanna know, neva say u dont luv him, if u cant let him go.  to love is nothing... to be loved is something... to love and be loved is EVERYTHING!  when your feeling oh so glum, and you think youre gunna cry, just look way above your head, stars are tissues in the sky. they'll wipe away your troubles, just like a hanky wipes your tears, they'll glisten in the darkness, they will push aside youre fears. the reason that the stars do this, everyone should understand... it's a lost one looking down upon you... to lend you a helping hand.  roses are red, violets are blue, i fell in love, but not with you, when we broke up, you thought i would cry. why would i cry? your just a typical guy! you told your friends, that we were just a game, i feel like crap, when i hear yor name. i told you i loved you... but thats not true, cos guess what baby? i played you too!  have you ever loved a boy and known he doesnt love you? have you ever started crying, wondering why it is he hates you? have you ever looked into his eyes, and said a little prayer? have you ever looked longingly at his arms, wishing you were wrapped up there? have you ever seen him dancing, when the lights are way down low? have you ever said "i love you" or even just "hello"!?  sometimes we all get caught up, in all our silly thoughts, sometimes we just wont be happy, bout something new weve bought, sometimes we may whinge and whine, and cry and bitch and moan, just coz when you want to speak, you're sisters on the phone. sometimes you might lose the plot, because youre test results werent great, or the guy you want so so bad, went out with your best mate. even little trivial things, seem to get us in a twist, the fact that your new lip-stick broke, gets some people really pissed. but have a long hard think about it, and tell me, do you beleive, that poor people own any of these, fancy fancy things. the stuff we take for granted,  the things that get us wild, there are much more serious things out there, like a dying starving child... a poor family whose house is bare... a baby that wont live to age 3, oil spills and chemicals, floating out to sea... there are bad bad things out there... tradgedies that outweigh any bad hairdo... so have a long hard think about it, and ask yourself "what can i do?"  for starters just stop whining, about something that aint worth the brawl... there are better things you can do with your time... to make the world better for all!

      Went to the beach again! it was waaaaaaaaaay rougher than yesterday...a kid got caught in a rip! but it wasw heaps of fun, the waves were breaking really late so jade and wade enjoyed that! also that meant it was calmer out deeper so i could actually swim without being severely dumped by the waves (i did get dumped tho!) it was a great day, really warm, and i managed to get some fotos! here they are!

      i went to the beach today.....so much fun! was goin really well till a massive wave dumped me and i got caught underwater in my boogie board string. i swallowed so much water and got so much sand up my nose and everywhere else...lol. i felt heaps sick so that was it for me...wasnt really that hot anyway! wade and jade bought home some oysters that they dug up, then we went to look at the pretty sea- views. so that was my interesting day!
