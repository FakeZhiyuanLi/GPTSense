       Good points: (1) kept the speech on time, (2) "felt" great  Bad Points: (1) spoke too fast, (2) did not address his Senate voting record (afterall, it represents 20 years of his life), (3) the mental image of him giving mouth-to-mouth to a hamster

       Interestingly enough, the Keepers of the Kerry Blog have posted his book "Our Plan For America" this afternoon, shortly after I visited. I stand corrected. I have already downloaded it and plan to read it tonight. The book is available in Adobe Acrobat format at  urlLink http://www.johnkerry.com/plan/ .

         As the election grows near, it’s interesting to see what information is being published by both the Republicans and the Democrats. Case in point, while sitting here I just received three Blog entries, one from  urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com , one from  urlLink http://blog.johnkerry.com , and one from  urlLink http://www.ndnblog.org  (The New Democrat Network).       The entry from Bush’s Blog talks about how the most recent reports out today indicate that the economy is growing and that the recovery has intensified in the last month. They site specific text from various reports and overall, try to make their case in a well thought-out entry. ( urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com/blog/archives/week_2004_08_15.html#001457 )         The entry from Kerry’s Blog talks about how Bush is “squeezing” American families, and how Bush is “doing a job” on them.    It mentions “today’s report” but gives no facts, numbers, or anything from “today’s report” to substantiate their point of view. It mentions that Kerry and Edwards have "a real plan to get the economy going, end the middle class squeeze, and make  America stronger at home and safer abroad" but to date I still have no idea what that plan is. Basically, its just a baseless attack on Bush. ( urlLink http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/002483.html )  The third entry is even more telling: “Electioneering in    Florida   ?” This brief entry quotes a   New York Times   article about how they feel that the election counting in    Florida    is flawed due to reliance on computerized election systems that have no paper-trail to follow. Actually, the entire entry is a quote from the article with no   NDN   commentary or analysis.    (  http://www.ndnblog.org/archives/000470.html  )             Let’s not kid ourselves. Both party’s are preparing their legal teams in each of the “battleground” states in preparation to contest a close defeat should the grounds be available. What I find interesting is that the Democrats, albeit not Kerry’s official website, are already laying the groundwork to appeal their defeat in    Florida   . This coupled with   The Majority Report’s   constant on-air allegations that the Republicans will use illegal methods to “steal” the election in    Florida   ,    Ohio   , and other states, leads me to believe that they are preparing for defeat in November.         As an undecided voter, I have to admit that I am beginning to lean towards Bush more and more each day. The information that Bush’s people put out shows what Bush is doing and what effect it is having. While at the same time Kerry’s folks are simply talking about his road trip and how wonderful the countryside is, while at the same time talking about how bad Bush is. To this day I still can’t tell you what Kerry would be doing different… Throw in the occasional article about electronic voting and the “stealing” of the 2000 election (it was not the first time that the Supreme Court settled a Presidential election) and I believe that we have just seen the Democrats “blink.”

       I am going through my radio archives again playing catch-up after being away for a week, and came across two radio shows that overall paint an interesting picture of today's political climate. The first was Sean Hannity's interview with Vice President Cheney. As an undecided voter, I like to listen to as many of the pundits as I can. Let's face it, Hannity is no more "fair and balanced" than The Majority Report. But he often makes some good points and I like listening to him. His interview with Cheney was very straight-forward and well thought out. Cheney came across as an intelligent leader and expressed his thoughts with clarity. Regardless of what you think of his politics, there is no way Air America is right when they claim him to be literally insane.  Next I turned my attention to my Majority Report archives for the week. No great interviews... In any case, the first thing that raised my eyebrow was an interview with a boy pretending to be the son of one of the Swifties. He talked about how his father drank all day and described the gifts that he was receiving from the Republicans for his father's statements against Bush. I know that the boy was false because they admitted it later in the show. It was a little odd to think that instead of finding information that would contrast the statements that have been made against Kerry's war record, they pull a stunt like this.  The final straw came when Janeane Garofalo, when asked why she did not want to attend the upcoming Republican convention, said that she had better ways to spend her days than hanging around "a bunch of mother fuckers and white crackers." Now, in all fairness, she did elaborate and state that "white crackers" was not strictly a southern reference and that there were "white crackers" in all parts of the country.  PLONK!  Never again will my server capture Air America radio for later listening. Any credibility Janeane had went right out the window with her hateful and racist remarks. And yes, should Sean Hannity ever make such a reference I will cease listening to his network as well.  My only question is "where is the outrage?" Perhaps you should reevaluate your small part in the talk radio arena, Janeane, when even such outrageous remarks fail to illicit a response... could it be because no one cares what you think? I certainly do not anymore.

         Blogs have traditionally been a forum for otherwise unknown individuals and groups to post commentary, information, and in general spread ideas and opinions. There was a lot of enthusiasm when Bloggers were accepted at the Democratic National Convention as journalists. What happened?       You log on to Blogs today, hoping to find bits of information on candidates, where they made speeches today, what they said in those speeches, and how the listeners reacted.       For the most part, you can still find this. But the text debate that each entry sparks has degraded to the point of absurdity. There are no constructive comments, pro or con, being left anymore it seems. It’s just message after message of garbage and insults, and no debate. And heaven forbid that one posts a comment contrary to the views of the website… they are met not with counterpoints but with insults, foul language, and finally: “goodbye, troll.”       This election, if nothing else, will serve to kill the Blog as a legitimate form of commentary and journalism. It has become a forum for nothing more than digitized sophomoric graffiti.

         First I must apologize. I have been on this kick lately, and have been caught up listening to  Majority Report  and Mike Malloy’s new show. That takes up quite a bit of time so I am just now getting to the archived recordings that my server caught this week. I started with Hannity’s Monday show. Right off the bat he begins talking about the spike in the polls (the bump) that the “liberals” predicted would hit 15 points after their convention.        Just a few days ago I wrote an entry about Garofalo’s criticism of the “neocon’s” prediction of the same thing. She basically said that they made that prediction so they could point to the smaller bump as a failure.       After much searching I could not find where that was said exactly and if it was, by whom. So I decided to pen another one of my “drop it” rants. So here we go:          1)     The Democrat’s Post-Convention Bump: right after the convention polls were reporting a 4 point bump. Today they are showing that there has been no increase. Both candidates are, for all intents and purposes, tied. The more everyone talks about it, the more foolish they look. The polls are what they are and we’re getting tired of hearing about the non-bump. So please, drop it.            2)      Hannity and Dean – Hannity keeps saying that Dean “advanced the theory” that Bush knew about 9/11 beforehand. The problem is, Hannity has played the footage of that conversation and that is not what Dean is doing. Dean is commenting on all of the wild theories that are floating around, and uses Bush’s foreknowledge of 9/11 as an example. If Dean is guilty of anything, it’s giving the idea air-time. So Hannity, drop it already.          3)     Dean and Hannity – Hannity is making a big deal about Dean’s question with regards to recent security concerns: “how much of this is real and how much is politics?” Not an easy question during an election year. But Bush is in a “no win” situation. If he does not act on it and something happens, then he loses. And if he does prevent something from happening he’s accused of “wagging the dog.” So really by asking the question it comes across as though Dean is the one playing politics. So drop this one before it bites you.        4)     National Intelligence “Czar” – the liberals are all up in arms about the creation of this position. And yet Kerry called for Bush to follow all of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations, of which this is one. The unity of the Democrats that was highlighted during the convention is already starting to come apart. My advice: drop this one quick and stop the decay. Kerry is the newly chosen candidate for the party and it is too soon to be openly contradicting him. (Wait until he wins and then you can argue with him all you want.)

         On  August  3, 2004 , the hosts of the  urlLink  Majority Report   discussed the fact that the Republicans over estimated the expected bump on the polls that the Democrats should expect following their convention so that they could make a big deal about the fact that they did not receive it after the convention is over.             Specifically, they said that the estimate was a 15% increase in the polls. I have done a little research and I think that they may have gotten those facts wrong.              The Republicans, specifically Matthew Dowd (Bush’s campaign chief strategist) argued prior to the Democratic National Convention that after the convention  Bush  could be  trailing  by as much as 15%, not that Kerry should receive a 15% bump.    The hosts of  MR  have on several occasions criticized the media for receiving their "talking points" rather than actually researching the news. They call the mainstream media "lazy." But Dowd's quote was twisted around and then reported by the mainstream media, and the Majority Report later lambasted the Republicans for the quote - giving credit to the Republicans rather than to CNN, Fox News, NBC, ABC, or CBS - and failed to check it's accuracy. On this point, they too might have been "lazy" by taking the mainsteam media's word for it.                       Historically since 1964, presidential candidates have experienced on average a 6% bump after a convention (according to Gallup Polls). Immediately following the Democratic National Convention, I was hearing that Kerry was up by 4 points. In light of the lack of real news that came out of the convention and the poor coverage by the networks, I think this is pretty good. It is certainly something that the Bush camp should be worried about.           Another interesting set of statistics I came across in my research has to do with the network’s coverage. During the 60’s and 70’s, networks would provide about 30 hours of coverage of the conventions and between 20% - 30% of Americans would watch. In 1996 and 2000, the networks provided just over 5 hours of the conventions and only about 15% of Americans tuned in.    I beleive that the networks have reduced their level of coverage as a responce to market forces. But why has the market gone in this direction? Is it because we as Americans don't care as much? Or because we have found alternative sources for news and information that we deam to be better, for whatever reason, than the networks provide? I think it is because a large number of people look elsewhere for their news and information and turn to the networks for entertainment - the "if it bleeds, it leads" model. People know that ABC, NBC, and CBS are not the places to turn to for real news and information, and the three don't seem too concerned with alterting that perception.

          Everyone it seems tried to make a story out of Teresa Heinz telling a reporter to "shove it." Big deal. How come no one latched on to the real story?  The real story was WHY she told the reporter to shove it. Minutes earlier she gave a speech where she called something "un-American". That was her exact word.  After the speech, the reporter asked her to clarify what she meant by that. She denied ever saying it. When he pressed her, she accused him of putting words in her mouth and continued the denial. Finally she stormed away without answering his legitimate question.  She returned seconds later to once again accuse the reporter of putting words in her mouth and ended the confrontation by telling him to "shove it."  The phrase itself is meaningless. But it is her denial and subsequent reaction on which we should be focusing.  It's not her opinions that are in question, but rather her stability.

       The new polls out this morning show that Kerry received about a 4 point bump after the convention. With the margin of error, this means that he may or may not have received any bump at all, and that Bush and Kerry are pretty much tied.  Personally, I think that this has a lot to do with the limited coverage that the networks gave the Democratic convention last week. I know that it was covered to various degrees on other cable channels and on PBS, but there are still a lot of people out there that watch only the networks. And unless you interrupt "The Price is Right" or "Fear Factor" they simply are not going to tune in.  Another factor in the non-bump is probably the fact that there was no news coming out of the convention. Kerrey announced his running mate weeks before. And although the speechs were very good in some cases, no one really revealed any details of their plans to change the country.  On other other hand, if Bush's camp thinks that they are going to get a huge bump from their upcoming convention, they should think again. The networks are probably not going to cover their get-together any better than they did Kerry's. And unless Bush discusses specifics on how he is going to accomplish his goals I am afraid that it too will be a huge news non-event.
