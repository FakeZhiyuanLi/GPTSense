       urlLink    B'Elanna is eternally young. She's five years old and very small but her size does not impact upon her ability to cause mischief. She is undoubtedly the naughtiest of all our feline friends but we love her for her audacity and cunning as much as we love all the others!&nbsp; urlLink

      Some witches and pagans express the view that we are completely marginalised by those immersed in mainstream society, seen perhaps as not worth listening to or more than a little crazy with our talk of love, peace, and respect for the planet. I think we  are  being heard. Put it this way, if our voices were not being heard in meaningful ways, would any witch or pagan ever have found ourselves on the path we're on? We had to hear about our own version of the 'good news' from somewhere.  And we did, remarkably always when the time was right for the message to be heard and the work of change and transformation to begin.  Coming from an evangelical Christian background - or rather, an excursion into personal hell that lasted three years when I was a teenager scared of coming out and seeking a 'solution' - I know the difference between that path and the one I am on now. Nevertheless, while we don't evangelise per se as witches, I personally don't hide my beliefs from friends or at gatherings where the topics of faith, religion and so on come up. I am always enthusiastic, up for talking about witchcraft and pagan beliefs, and am increasingly finding that to be pagan, if not always to be a witch, is seen less and less as being 'kooky' and more as, at the very least, a valid and interesting path to follow. Many people ask me for information and while witches don't stand on soapboxes or hand out  Jesus Saves!  fliers, I sometimes wish I  did  have some kind of thing I could give to the interested, without, of course, the threat of damnation or attacks on other ways of living! As is, I point people to the writings of Starhawk now, or established online resources which I know are reliable.  There has never before been given to us the opportunity that we have right now, to tell others how we feel and what we believe (secret rites excepted, where applicable, of course). There are challenges to this, and risks, but if we are calm and measured and work by consensus as much as possible, then a lot of good can come about now and in the future.  Not long ago, blanket condemnation or moreover ridicule was par for the course. But the more we see sights such as hailstones and floods in the UK in August - and other phenomenon that are a direct response by Gaia to what we've done to her - the more people see that secularism/capitalism and the rape of the planet are, simply, Not. Good. Things.  But most people don't know another way. We surely have a duty not to hit people over the head, not to coerce, but to give out the basic knowledge that there are alternative paths available to look at? I don't believe it's good to find something special, then hide it. We should be shouting with joy.  So, while we don't evangelise in the Christian sense of the word, we do nevertheless demonstrate through our interactions with other people that there are alternatives to the current mainstream. And I believe that our only hope of having a meaningful future lies in individuals coming together in collectives to work on the micro level and, from there, have an impact on the macro. What starts with one goes on to build with two, three, four...  While many pagans deride the influx of Wiccawannabe teenagers, they fail to realise that the desire on the part of those young people is to find an alternative to what they have previously been fed. While they may think they can one day become Willow-type characters a la Buffy, they are young and entitled to be foolish and grandiose in aspirations. I really dislike the way in which they can be snobbishly dismissed and treated as a sideshow that won't go anywhere. Many will fall away from where they are at, true; but many will go on to become adults whose interest in goddess religion has grown and developed into strong and disciplined beliefs and practice. We should encourage all those who express interest and allow young people the chance to experiment, to play, to ponder and to grow. If we diss them, make them feel small, are we any better than the fundamentalist and extremist peddlers of the major religions of today? I mean, what do we want to do with these kids? Reject them? Brainwash them? Or allow them to learn for themselves, to come to their own conclusions to what's right and what's wrong?  I don't think we're any different from extremist advocates of major religions, not if we behave like witchcraft is a  special  club for  special  people. I'm no more special than anyone else. We are all beautiful miracles, even if some of us choose to do ugly things.  I came out of the Christian mindset - as much as anyone is able to, in this world so steeped in subliminally Christian values - determined to never again be so damn judgmental. I am always, and always will be, astonished when I hear witches and pagans spending time and energy on the attack, using sarcasm and putdowns.  There are Moslems, Jews and Christians out there whose lives and beliefs bear no relation to their worst fundamentalist exponents, who live honest lives in honest belief, doing 'good works' as they might put it, and  they  can teach  us  at times about humility and faith and social interaction. They're not all motivated by hatred. That's a myth put about by those succumbing to fear and narrow-mindedness. Many followers of other religions are motivated from a love of life and humanity, and a desire to learn how to love themselves. It's never a one-way street and my experiences didn't make me hate Christians; rather, I understand the fear that drives many of them, though not all, and I believe that we can learn from anyone, from any source, if we maintain openness and reject fear.  There are, simply, no limits other than the ones we choose to put upon ourselves when it comes to anything at all. We should ask ourselves as witches, honestly, whether our beliefs are truly open or closed to new revelations from unexpected, at times maybe unwelcome, sources. If we aren't open to these kinds of surprises, I'd say we need to do some work on ourselves as we miss out on much that is exciting about life's unpredictable twists and turns if we start imposing rules on what we will and won't listen to or accept.  I tried to find myself a coven in London about five years ago. I wrote an email to one bloke, who wrote back that I 'didn't have enough experience' and signed himself High Priest. I thought of HP Sauce when I saw the capitalisation - but seriously, I was really upset. This wasn't a job application! What did he mean? I wrote back to ask but no answer ever came. It's one thing to have guidelines, to have group views, but to dismiss people out of hand? Outrageous. I vowed there and then never to be so presumptive or prescriptive.  I don't want to join a cliquey club of like-minded people who will nod at everything I say. I never have - no, actually, that's not true. I did when I was a teenager, when peer pressure mattered so much more.  After further demoralising encounters with more hardliners of the pagan subculture (yes, it  is  a subculture, whether you accept or deny), I almost despaired of ever finding a coven to be initiated into. I began looking for one which worked as much in the outside world as the inner, and had a keen collective sense of the political, social and spiritual being inextricably linked. This is why I was so pleased to discover Reclaiming. It is, simply, right for me at this precise moment in time to explore this path. It may not be one day. I'm open to that. I'd like to think I'm open to a lot more than I used to be but, as ever, there will always be work to be done on the inner being as it walks through this lifetime.

       Last year, myself and David were having some real problems but we worked through them. We spent six months apart, not so much a trial separation as a need for space to sort out where our heads were at. When we started living together again, we'd gone through a huge learning curve and had worked hard to achieve positive results, so we were justifiably proud and happy. I wrote the following fairy tale which I'd like to share with you:  And so the two kings, who had shared the throne   together for over five years, grew restless and   decided to go their separate ways. There was   much sadness in the Magic Kingdom as the   crowds gathered to watch King Andrew and King   David wave goodbye to their people, and to one   another.     Both men wondered if they would ever return to the   Magic Kingdom and see each other again. As they set out to   see what lay ahead in the Uncharted Territories, one heading   north and the other south, each of them felt very alone.   Behind them, they left their faithful feline friends in charge of   the Magic Kingdom.    Six long months passed, during which King David and   King Andrew learned a great deal about their own selves. Each   came to realise that, no matter how many adventures they   could have in the world, the greatest challenges were to be   found in conquering their own fears and doubts. And both   kings sorely missed each other throughout their time apart.    When the lookout on top of the tower blew the golden horn to   announce the sighting of the royal flag, the citizens of the   Magic Kingdom were overjoyed. Imagine how much more they   smiled when the cavalcade drew closer and they saw that not   one, but both kings were coming home.    King Andrew and King David entered through the gates   of the kingdom together, each looking very different to when   they had left – healthier, and happier. Both had been through   testing times, and each knew himself to be a better man as a   consequence.    And so the kings entered the Royal Palace arm in arm,   side-by-side, smiling at the people they passed on the way.   Once inside, they lost no time in ascending to the balcony,   from whence they issued a joint declaration to their people.      “We have travelled far and wide,” King David and King   Andrew said together, as one voice. “We did so to discover our   true selves. In so doing, we have found that we already knew   where our futures lay. With each other. We vow to you, our   people, to always work out our differences and never again to   take anything that is wonderful in life for granted.”      Upon hearing this, the people roared their approval.   Some began dancing, others wept with happiness.    “May we all live happily ever after,” said one of the cats,   a smug but beautiful tabby.    “Yes. But we’ll be eating less mice from now on,” said   another, this one considerably fatter than the first.    “True,” conceded the first cat. “But think of all the love   we’ll get now those two are back together.”

       Has anyone ever responded to you asking for advice or help on a mailing list with the answer, 'just use a search engine' or something similar?  You can find anything online. Ah yes, that is kind of true but, personally, I prefer  recommendations  rather than the automatically generated, hardware- and software-controlled responses of search engines when it comes to things like books. I can indeed search for anything online but there isn't a search engine out there that comes with a mind of its own.  Maybe it's 21st century intimacy issues, but while I love using computers for so many reasons, I could never trust them enough to have a meaningful relationship with one. The one thing I do like about them, though, is they don't do anything we can class as negative per se: they simply do what they can, within their limits, when we ask it of them. They are completely cold, emotionless and ignorant of their users being either technologically-challenged or, like me, technology journalists of nine years' standing - or all the shades of knowledge inbetween. That's the nicest thing about them, as well as the most dangerous: without conscience, they can be used for any purpose. Just don't ask them to think for themselves. Yet. Woe betide when they can in my view, at this present moment. But then, it's not worth getting too scared over the idea for now - a vacuum cleaner is without conscience, a chair is without conscience, and both and more could be used in violent ways but we don't avoid them for fear of someone, somewhere using them to bash others over the head.    So, I embrace technology for the most part and I am fully aware of search engines - unsurprisingly, given the above - but just don't ever suggest I use one when it's a basic given that I'm connected, have ability and know how to use them. I'm not seeking glib answers if I ask for help. I'm just doing that: asking for advice that comes from human experience.  I asked for some information about books on a list I'm on, to get recommendations from those who have read what they recommend. A search engine can't do that. It was also an appeal to those with more knowledge than myself, and I think that's entirely valid and worthy and I'm very grateful to all those who took the trouble to reply at the time.    Emails and other forms of online messaging can so often be misconstrued and feelings can be hurt, though I am more inclined these days to point out mild upsets, especially if they are more than likely not intended at all. It is those who brood, or are simply quite shy, who can be put off from posting to lists when they encounter what can be  perceived  to be curt or flippant responses to serious enquiries seeking knowledge from others who know while they don't. Our personalities, also, do not come across in their full splendid and complex glory via this medium, either; we get glimpses and so on a bad day, we can appear monstrously bad-tempered, or sarcastic, when in fact we aren't at all if others could see those aspects in context of the whole person. We can easily be branded firecrackers, or hostile or whatever - or the reverse: fluffy, or frivolous, or shallow, or other less dark things that don't show us as whole people - which is always a shame and needs to be guarded against.  We're all light, and dark, and the shades inbetween. It was only when I became a witch that I was able to begin breaking out of the duality of good/evil and start seeing people as people, as individuals whatever their views and backgrounds. It's probably going to take more than one lifetime to rid myself entirely of that ancient scourge on the human psyche dating back to Aristotle's philosophies and the early Christian Church fathers (ho hum) but I'm getting there. Slowly. Thanks to Her love and patience, and that of my friends and family.    I mentioned Amazon in a previous post. I don't wish to use Amazon any more as they censor the books they supply more often than not based on right-wing agendas. While witches don't appear a threat in the post-9/11 manipulated climate of fear, repression and censorship, it is certainly the case that (some) arguments put forward democratically, in text, voice or other means, against Bush are. Perhaps Amazon funds Republicans, as may well be but who can say? Not I. But I do believe in voting with my heart, soul, wallet, my feet and my fingers on the keypad as much as the ballot box. It means you have to think more, do more and be more but that's all great and, unless I fundamentally misread the essence of Reclaiming, forms a core component of its collective soul. I seek to do more and become more of who I am inside - it's one reason, just one of many, why I'm looking forward to the UK Witchcamp: I'm eager to learn and grow and find new ways to interact with the world of which I form a part.    As a witch, I'd say we're very dangerous in many decidedly non-violent ways to the likes of Bush and, as a frequent reader and purchaser of books, I prefer to support either online alternative bookshops or, even better, my local bookshop round the corner where I can chat, have a cuppa and browse as well as order books based on recommendations from informed friends. They also, for a small shop, have an extensive lesbian and gay section, but that's by the by and I digress - something I am indeed prone to do from time to time, though for the most part I'm pleased to note that my digressions and divergences don't tend, usually, to make people's eyes glaze over. Before I became clearer as to my path and began my spiritual explorations, I was often unwilling and afraid to ask for help or advice, preferring to either fake knowledge or try to do everything alone - it's the modern way, never show weakness, and lack of knowledge is often perceived as that - but now, I hold onto the idea that asking for help or advice is a sign of wisdom and strength, so in a class I might be the only one holding up my hand to say I don't understand... But I know darn well I'm not the only one who doesn't. That's a kind of freedom and I'm pleased to own it as a part of who I am now.

       Darling George: friend to the bin Laden family, reverse Robin Hood and enemy of eskimos. He does for Texan tourism what a thick creamy yoghurt would do if thrown into a marine fish tank. Along with terrible tales such as what happened to Mathew Shepard, and other sporadic outbreaks of mindless violence and ignorant prejudice, I am so put off from ever visiting Texas.     It's what SARS did for China, BSE for the UK and Mugabe for Zimbabwe. I know Texas is a huge state, but I am so put off from ever visiting it because of the stories and characters that colour it savage, albeit an obvious abstraction and distortion and deeply unfair to the majority of its citizens. Choose better spokespeople and make better laws, I might yet book a holiday there. Until then, I dream of visiting San Francisco.    My home town of  urlLink Chorley  in Lancashire has a number of rather tragic claims to pop culture fame, surprisingly for a northern town - we had the founder of Ultravox, the band, born there (no, not Midge Ure, the   original   singer who split with them during the recording of their first album and went on to be rather avant-garde: John Foxx). We had Lloyd Cole of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions - who were quite good, actually - and, perhaps most sadly, a number of actors from the TV soap Coronation Street. About the only one that amuses me is the woman who sang the theme from Prisoner Cell Block H came from Chorley as well (but at some point had the sense to flee, a little further than I did of course, ending up in Australia). Let it be known this is the last time I reveal such dark mysteries...    Oh and then there's me. Not famous (well, not yet, haha) but I'm probably the only person in my home town who ended up a writer as opposed to a BT line engineer. I sometimes wonder, can I really miss the smell of burnt copper wiring if I've never had the joy...?

       urlLink    This is a really good pic that I was sent recently. The statistics say it all, really. I was never in favour of the war, or a supporter of Bush's 'War on Terror' because it's all about oil and right-wing agendas. If the people can be frightened enough, then they are easier to control and it becomes a doddle to get any legislation through that you want, regardless of how it affects our civil liberties. Blair is very much Bush's lackey, and we recently received through the door a government-produced pamphlet telling us what to do in the event of a terror attack. It's all pretty graphics and pretty useless information - basically, stay indoors, don't go anywhere and wait for your friendly trustworthy soldier boys to come and either (a) shoot you or (b) let you know the nasty people have been dealt with and it's safe to shop at Tesco's once more. I mean, really - they can't protect us on the Tube system: we take our lives into our hands every time we travel on public transport, especially in cities like London. Our glorious leaders will be too busy protecting themselves in the event of a major emergency to really, truly give a fig as to what happens to the rest of us. It's all empty words, fanciful rhetoric... and the killing of civilians in countries we attack for oil goes on and on and on... &nbsp; urlLink

       I've been having some shamanic healing sessions of late, thanks to my friend Kate for whom my sessions form a part of her training and assessment.       I had a very powerful and beautiful vision as part of a guided visualisation and would very much like to share it with folks. I wrote up my experience for Kate. I wanted to write down as much detail as possible at the time in case I forgot anything. As it happens, unlike what happens with so many 'ordinary' dreams of mine, the memory of what took place is as fresh in my mind today as it was when I was undergoing the journey.      I cannot type the way it made me feel, I cannot fully convey, ever, the joy and exhilaration of the experience, but I very much hope that it bodes well for my personal growth during Witchcamp this week (I'm going away this Thursday to what sounds like it's going to be a lovely retreat near Glastonbury). So, thank you Kate!    Here's what happened:      I was walking through a meadow full of bright yellow flowers – buttercups, I think, or something similar: wild, free-growing, untainted by the interference of man with his penchant for straight lines and plants grown for the marketplace. These were growing where nature had placed them. The sun was high in the sky, giving off warmth and bright light that was reflected back up from the flowers into my face. I felt very happy.    I found myself climbing a hill that was somewhat similar to Glastonbury Tor. Looking down from my vantage point at the very top, I was able to see that the flowers stretched for miles, covering the landscape as far as the eye could see with a yellow blanket. In the distance I could see a forest – a dense collection of ancient trees, the dark green of them contrasting sharply with the yellow of the flowers.     I moved quickly down from the hill and through the meadow, until I stopped at the entrance to the forest. I knew it was the entrance because the trees had grown together over the centuries, trunk intimately pressed up against trunk, until there was no means of getting into the forest other than through the opening in front of me.     My guide appeared next to me. A squirrel – neither red nor grey, but brown I think. I don’t know if brown squirrels actually exist on our earthly plane of existence. I know that in this country they are red or grey. But I knew this was not an ordinary squirrel – I knew it was intelligent, gentle, and powerful – and it was very excited to see me, jumping around and running in and out between my feet as I walked forward. It led me into the forest and with my friend – I won’t say new friend, as I felt he’d been waiting for me to acknowledge him for a long time – at my side, I was unafraid but I knew I was going to face up to something inside the forest.      There was a huge clearing inside the forest in the middle of which stood the biggest tree I’ve ever seen. Its trunk was so huge that even a giant could not have encircled it in his arms. The trunk was gnarled with age and I knew the tree dated back to before the time of humanity. This tree was ancient when dinosaurs first appeared, and its roots were thick and long and extended a very long way across the ground and I could only assume that the roots under the ground went down for many miles. I couldn’t see the top. I could only just make out branches in the sky if I craned my head backwards. The upper parts of the tree were hidden by bright, white clouds.     The squirrel grew even more excited as I sat down at the base of the tree and he – it was a he – ran along the roots that were visible above ground, covered in bright green moss. My friend then scampered up the trunk of the tree – just a few feet above my head – before jumping back down to be at my side as a figure entered the vision. It was male, very tall, wide-shouldered and strong. I could sense that it was malevolent, intending to harm me and intimidate me. The face was hidden from me – or maybe he had no face – and the arms ended in scissor-like appendages that snapped at me like angry crabs. I wasn’t as scared as I thought I’d be, not with my friend by my side. And then I noticed the vines: like bindweed, they extended out from the figure and latched onto me.      There were two types of vine. Some ended in my body, attached like limpets. I could feel them sucking out my energies. The thickest of them was attached at one end to the figure’s throat and the other end was rooted in my heart. I hacked at this vine with a golden knife. The vine was tough and took several attempts to sever but I felt it was the primary source of much of my suffering and with it gone from me, I felt the other bindings would be easier to tackle. The fears of the heart were being fed by the voice box of this creature. No more. I think it was a darker shade of me.     The second and third vines were attached to my shoulders, pulling me down – providing me with an explanation, there and then, as to why I so often stoop and feel intimidated in life. Another pair of vines was rooted in my hips. Since the vision I’ve wondered if there was a sexual component here, perhaps relating to issues surrounding the interpretation of sexuality, sexual needs and sexual feelings – by that, I mean as a gay man I’ve had my share of shame and guilt when I was ‘in the closet’; and beyond that, too, in the arena of misplaced or unreciprocated feelings, the same as many people irrespective of their sexualities and needs. The vines were cut and I felt free. I’ve since felt that old Christian notions of sin and guilt – hangovers of our collective damaged past - were being addressed. I certainly felt purged and cleansed, increasingly so as the vision developed.     The last vine wasn’t planted in my flesh. Instead, it was wrapped around my ankles, round and round, preventing me from moving forward and trying to drag me down. This vine was very irritating to me – I remember it made me feel angry – and it took some time to cut away but when I succeeded, I remember feeling very happy.     My friend, the beautiful squirrel, was overjoyed and running around like a mad and enthusiastic puppy. The dark figure retreated and I relaxed. I felt I could stay under the tree with my friend for a very long time, but the squirrel made it clear to me that our time together in that way was over. I am sure, though, that I will meet him again. In fact, I know that I will because I hope to visit the tree in future visualisations and I know the squirrel has other things to communicate to me as and when I am ready and the time is right for whatever is revealed.     Since the vision, I have felt inspired and motivated to pursue my aspirations in life with more vigour and hope than I’ve felt for a long time. I’m also a lot happier and optimistic that my life does, indeed, have some purpose which, while I don’t fathom it yet, will be revealed to me over the course of the coming years. I’m grateful for such a powerful and revelatory experience. Thank you, Kate, for your help in finding my way to the tree and meeting my animal guide friend.

                 For the full story, click  urlLink here . It's an article written for and published by  The Observer  newspaper.  This is a not unsurprising development but one that is interesting on many scary levels - the notion of mass medication by government has been around for ages - i.e. fluoride - and no doubt some will see this as deliberate conspiracy; personally, I just think it's yet more evidence of scant disregard for the ecosystem. Where some see conspiracy, I see simple stupidity and wilful ignorance on the part of the conventionally powerful. Opinions anyone?  Andy

       Hello world. Welcome to my new blog. I've finally succumbed to the online renaissance of keeping a diary of sorts, in part because I'm always writing down little bits and pieces here and there, then sometimes losing them. I also have a tendency to start writing emails to lists I'm on with every intention of keeping things short, then I find I've written what basically amounts to an essay! So I thought it'd be good to have somewhere else for my musings to be presented to the wider world after they've sprung up out of the depths of my mind.    In addition to the precis as to who I am, which you can see at the top of my blog home page, I'd like to add that I'm reluctant to describe myself as a 'white' witch, though that is essentially what I am to those who use those kinds of categories. I'm not into them as, to me, they symbolise an adherence to the old Judeo-Islam-Christian duality of good-v-evil and I think everyone has the potential to be good and bad, and it does humanity no good to demonise people as monsters. Having laws and taking action against criminals is one thing; judging people's faiths, seeing those who disagree with you, as evil is quite another. There's no such thing as the supernatural, only that which is natural and if we don't understand it, then maybe one day we will. And opinions are never going to change the world, so why go on the attack when someone expresses opinions different to your own? Actions change the world. Act if you don't like something. Just make sure, whatever you do, it's non-violent, legitimate (though that doesn't necessarily mean legal, but ethical) and spreads a message of hope and love and peace, not hate. Try the art of debating a topic. It's not the same as having an argument. Believe me, I've tried both and I know the difference.    Ditching the old ideas that most of us take on board subconsciously from a very early age seems to me to have only been a good thing: I find I am less judgmental and a better listener since my first tentative explorations of Witchcraft, Wicca, The Craft, call it what you will because I don't care so long as you get the correct sense of the thing, rather than an acquired and long-cultivated misunderstanding. I don't have a pointy hat. But then, I do have cats which are familiar to me while not exactly being Familiars.    I've been a witch for nigh on five years and am now looking into a further understanding of Reclaiming, which is a movement of ideas, cooperative action, social interaction and engagement with the wider world. There are many writers and activists out there who are letting folks know what Reclaiming is, but you can do no better as a first step than to seek out a book called   The Spiral Dance   by Starhawk. Try to get it from a so-called 'alternative' bookseller rather than the likes of the censorious Amazon, which has been known to ban books on the basis of political views expressed rather than violent content or hate advocacy. Support the little man (and woman) as much as you can. You might also want to check out the link I've added to this post - just click on the subject line above and it takes you to the British Reclaiming site (because I'm British, so that's my first port of call).    I hope you enjoy my blog and find things in it over time that inspire you or give you information you didn't have previously; I also welcome any feedback providing it is polite and respectful, intended to open a two-way dialogue or pass constructive comment - as opposed to providing the sender with a means of textually abusing someone.    Blessings,    Andy   xxx
