      It was a startling love affair That started out with a charming smile  A mind-blowing flirtation between your seductive lips and my right ear Those lips revealed the nature of endless possibilities.  Those eyes could easily start a fire I could feel beads of sweat down my bosoms and  Seeping though my clothes   Such torture Deliciously tormented The tension  A glimpse of transcendence- I saw. It was whimsical and dreadful. I idolized the untouchable fantasy. As I trembled with happiness, I excused myself out.  On the corner of my eye, I knew I left an opportunity Of what could have been…  But the heart doesn’t lie.   It was a startling love affair,  That ended with  desiring romancing smiling and waiting.  *jenn_ramos

      Tell me this Is it possible for the person to survive the death of the body? Is there a sense in which we can continue to live after our bodies have died? Can there be a personal life after death?  There has been a conception of life after death. In which at the death of the body the soul leaves the body and travels to a realm known as heaven. Does the soul literally leave the body? How so? Out of the mouth? Is it in a form of a shape? How does it get through heaven? DOes it go over Mars? Does it get close to Mercury? Where is heaven? How does a soul know where to go? What happens when it gets there? If the soul remains disembodied, how can it see perceive anything? And if all souls remain disembodied, how can one soul recognize another? What is there to recognize?  Do you ever wonder how and why our thoughts can have so much impact on our daily lives-every second, twenty-four hours a day...  that's a lot of thoughts.  And many of them are unexplanable and deniable.  So are they just useless thoughts?  Do we think just for the sake of thinking or do they actually happen for a reason?

      As I sit here comfortably Glancing at a dream  Questioning…  The dangerous freedom of sharp thin lines,  wonders of chemistry, and the well known strings of consequences.  Oh, the bittersweet pain that starts with envious colors: vermillion red haunts the pain and warmth of the past burnt yellow appeals hope of today while the olive ochre drawn the cushion and excitement of tomorrow   The sight of these made me doubt more.  But it’s   Oh so strikingly mysterious. And oh so beautiful Yet I feel numbed  How could this be?  As I comfortably reclined back I closed my eyes and allowed myself to summon the song That brought love into my heart for a moment or two  Then it was gone How could this be?  Waited and waited  Then…  A prevailing message transmitted from my clenched right fist as The uncertainly snakes through my weightless body and wakes me up I must open my eyes and confront this strange freedom With confidence, kindness and whole heartedly  For none is expected tomorrow Except to be injected with love again-  To comfort a dream  For love has become my dream in the  Past Today Tomorrow.   *jenn_ramos
