      I think I'll make this a regular thing.  A little bit of Friday poetry for you all...   It's the scientific confusion, That creates this illusion. A type of mental contusion, Some emotional infusion.  It's not without it's merits, And certainly it inherits, The bitter pill for us to swallow, Just to make sure we follow.  It's a tyranny of the minority, Pushing over the majority, Imprisoned in crimson and peach, The Truth just beyond our reach.  Who can be certain? I can be certain.  Or can I?   You can leave your verbal punches-to-the-stomach in the comments section.

      A big Happy Birthday to my good buddy  urlLink Wes .  It seems like I've known this guy forever.  We've been on many adventures, not limited to  urlLink roof hopping ,  urlLink Monkey  Rock or the time I almost collapsed a  urlLink mine shaft  onto his head.  We've been through fun times and hard times.  Here's to many more years of times in general:

      Mmm.   urlLink Two Guys Pizza & Pasta  is quite simply,  thee  place to get a decent, moderately priced, Italian meal.  The pepperoni and meatball pizza is certainly hard to beat.  In other news, is it at all surprising that this guy,    wanted to set up an Al Qaeda camp in  urlLink Oregon ?

      I'm sooo tired. After the gym, I spent last night watching  urlLink Behind Enemy Lines .  It was a fun movie, I must say. The first review on it's imdb page pretty much sums up my view of it.  It certainly made me want to visit those there  urlLink Balkans .  Seems to be beautiful country. Now I just need to wait for those clowns to get their act together, so I can explore it without getting kidnapped and my balls used as collateral.  I've been letting my need-to-watch DVDs pile up, juggling between studying  urlLink this  and  urlLink that , reading for  urlLink pleasure , and  urlLink Far Cry .  This is definitely  THEE  best PC shooter and game, in general, that I've played in quite awhile.  Will be back to blab more later, I'm sure of it...

      I'm not sure I can explain this odd phenomenon, but I can't stop watching the  urlLink DIY  channel.  In no more than an hour, I learned to fix my toilet, cook up tasty omelettes and fritatas, and build a go-cart.  Sweet.

       Situation : You go to a restaurant and find yourself short on cash to pay for the meal.  At this point, you have a few singles in your wallet, but that's about it.  So you decide that you must pay with a credit/debit card, but you choose to leave the tip from your small wad of scrilla.  This isn't so bad when you pay from the table, but oftentimes, you find you have to go up the cashier to make payment.  After the process of authorizing the payment, it's time for you to write in the tip amount and the total.   Dilemma : I feel like I need to tell the cashier that I'm writing a big fat $0.00 in the tip section because I've left the tip at the table.  I don't want the cashier to think I'm some cheap prick whose face she'll remember, so that next time I come in for a meal, she'll make sure I get extra "special sauce".  I also don't want to be presumptive in the fact that what I'm doing has never been done before and, therefore, she needs to be told exactly why I'm doing that.  It's at that point in time that you hope you have a friend nearby to bail you out.    Hey, bail me out up here. Wha? Oh, okay... Hey, did you want to stop by  [insert name of store]  and get that  [insert name of object]  you need? No, I just spent the rest of my cash on the tip I left at the table.  It all just seems like a very  urlLink Seinfeldian  situation to me, even  urlLink Curb Your Enthusiasm-ish  (which I guess would make sense since  urlLink Larry David  is the mastermind from whence Seinfeld sprung).

      Okay, my first serious post.  My hope is that by putting my thoughts down in this blog, I can better explore my own mind and maybe even surprise myself with new ways of thinking.  It's something I've rarely done outside of academic exercise.  Perhaps I might even pull a complete one-eighty on some issues.  Concerning the whole Abu Ghraib debacle, I really do not have much to say that hasn't already been said, but I would like to share some thoughts.  First, this situation exemplifies how the actions of the  urlLink few  can really tear down what's been built up by the many.  It bothers me that we're so  human  sometimes, and that when we try to prop ourselves up as able to overcome our weaknesses (under the banner of Democracy), those very weaknesses seem to stand out like Michael Moore at Weight Watchers.  I could argue that democracy is a system which helps us to face those faults and own up to them, but public perception is more often built on generalities and prejudices than concerned with precision.  I feel like we've given those in the Islamic world, who straddle the fence on the issue of supporting the American efforts to fight terrorism, a hard shove onto the other side.  Secondly, I believe there's a framework of degree when it comes to torture, and that the whole notion is highly subjective.  Some of what is being called torture, I feel, is necessary (be it sleep depravation, solitary confinement, etc).   BUT , what's seen in most of these photos just plain goes against everything America preaches about.  And the whole excuse of "just following orders" wouldn't even cut it in grade school.  Yes, I'm sure there is pressure from higher-ups, but anyone who has an ounce of common sense knows that is the faultiest of rationalizations (the war tribunals of WWII setting a fine precedent).  I don't care if you're under the gun or amongst friends.  If one truly believes something, one should never forsake one's principles.  We're all familiar with the "jumping off a cliff" scenario.  I have quite a bit on my mind to say about the subject, but I'm not quite ready to type out something of dime novel proportions.  And I know that the sum of my current audience amounts to less than a nickel, but please post your thoughts if you have them.

      First off, I would just like to point out the fact that the once great ellipses seem to be  way  overused in the online medium.  Okay, now that I have my first rant out of the way...  Welcome to another freakin' blog.  Also, welcome to another freakin' blog that contains the sentence (or something similar) "Welcome to another freakin' blog."  And I can't leave you today without saying "Welcome to another freakin' blog that contains 'Welcome to another freakin' blog' which contains 'Welcome to another freakin' blog.'"  Alright, I'm sure I will make an attempt to post something a bit more intellectual later.  But it's still a bit early in the week for that.  My brain is part of some crazy labor union that has the oddest working hours.  Damned communists...

      Fun weekend.  Enjoyed a wonderful meal at  urlLink Jade Inn  on Saturday evening.  Not only are the meals delicious, but also quite pretty:   urlLink     The sweet nougaty center of this past weekend though, was actually attending my first  urlLink Comic Book/Sci-Fi Convention .  Now, I'm normally not apt to attend faire such as this, but I had to make an exception for one of my own personal superheroes.  That's right.  I'm talking about the one and only,  urlLink Lance Henriksen .  The man was so cool.  Extremely down to earth, he's a guy that could be easily mistaken for your favorite uncle.  We saw some great clips and trailers for  urlLink Spiderman 2 ,  urlLink 'I, Robot' , and  urlLink Alien vs. Predator .   urlLink J.K. Simmons  talked for around 20 minutes about  Spiderman 2 .   urlLink Alan Tudyk , who plays the lead robot in  'I, Robot'  in much the same way Gollum was brought to life by  urlLink Andy Serkis , also spoke with a 20th Century Fox executive about that film.  Then the true star of the show came on and talked for about 45 minutes.  They all did a Q&A session with the fans which provided endless amusement.  It really amazes me how some of these people are able to function in life.  Now, the whole purpose of attending this event was so that I might shake the hand of this &#252berman and get his signature on a poster I had won on  urlLink eBay .  I was a little worried near the end of the day, because we had purchased 'reserved' tickets which were $20 a piece, but were supposed to be practical guarantees of getting an autograph.  Well, thanks to people who monopolized the autograph time, we almost missed out!  But luckily we were able to get in under the wire.  We also received a goodie bag full of nice swag.  All things considered, it was a fantastic Sunday.  Just to be able to see the people who regularly attend these sorts of events made it all worthwhile.  Here's only a brief smattering of what we saw:  This made it almost as easy to find our car as searching for the pole with Goofy on it:   urlLink     No, this guy was not paid to dress up:   urlLink

      Well, I caught  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  this weekend with the old man.  Despite many of the reviews, I loved it.  Classic action/sci-fi flick.  Sure, there were quite a few unanswered questions running around my mind throughout, but those were momentary lapses before I remembered that I shouldn't really try to think too much at all during this movie.  If you go in for some intellectual stimulation or superior acting skills, you will be disappointed.  For me, from the 'badassness' of the Necromongers during the beginning of the film to the cheezy one-liners, I had  fun  the whole time.  If you do want some of those questions answered, you can always check  urlLink this  out.  It's a cool little entertaining piece on it's own merit.  The network topology map of the day is brought to us by  urlLink eMegaWeb :   urlLink

      Saw my good buddy Jason Richey last night!  I see this guy every once in a blue moon, so it was really cool of him to swing by and hang out on his way up from San Diego.  We reminisced a bit about our  urlLink BBS  days, pioneers we were to the great electric yonder that is the Internet.  It seems like just the other day, we were camping out in his backyard, listening to KVVQ 103.1 during the requests hour for the names of our friends.  It's a bit of an odd feeling when you see someone from your childhood (and I mean your graham crackers-and-milk childhood).  It reminds you that, in a certain sense, you're participating in a long, drawn out movie...at times, so boring you just want to fall asleep; at other times, more suspenseful than anything you're likely to find at your local cineplex.  In other news, my  urlLink ReplayTV  arrived yesterday!!  It truly is superior to  urlLink sliced, baked dough .  I've already recorded episodes of  urlLink The Thin Blue Line  and  urlLink Monty Python's Flying Circus .  In fact, there's a built-in playlist purely dedicated to  urlLink Britcoms .  It also looks like we're doing Ruby's BBQ for lunch today!  And most important of all, my mom is out of the hospital where she was holed up for 16 days.  Looks like she's on the road to recovery from those dastardly blood clots.  I am a happy, happy boy.

      Went and saw  urlLink Sister Machine Gun  Saturday night.  Holy crap.  I can't believe that it's been seven years since I last see these gents play.  The whole band played with such tight timing together and Chris Randall was freakin' on the ball.  Some of the people in attendance were  urlLink Jeff Beck ,  urlLink En Esch  of  urlLink KMFDM  fame, and quite a few other  urlLink Wax Trax!  playas from back in the day.  The opening act,  urlLink Manufactura  was really good so far as the music was concerned, but as usual, purely electronic-instrumental music does not exactly provide for an entertaining show.   urlLink Christ Analogue  was up next.  What can I say, other than I wasn't too broken up that their set ended a bit early due to technical problems.  Overall, it was grand experience.  From the crackhead who wanted to "kill the mothafucka" that was traveling around outside prior to the opening of the doors, to the various "it's Halloween everyday" costumes that were donned by many of the attendees.  I really hope I don't have to wait another seven years!!  - HomerJ

      Mr. Den Beste has a most excellent  urlLink post  concerning  urlLink Information Theory  and it's many implications.  A lot of it is very "So what?", but it really gets into the details of how a lot of decisions are made throughout the day.  It certainly provided me with a new viewpoint on the synergy between media and public.  To diverge from the path a little bit...  After reading this essay, it made me think about other ideas dealing with information.  Pointedly, the issue of  theory  vs.  practicality .  You'll find a lot of people don't give a damn about theory and throw all their eggs into the basket of 'practical experience', assuming that this experience provides best-in-class solutions.  But experience doesn't necessarily mean you're doing things correctly or optimally.  Experience just means that when you've run into a specific problem, you've learned to reproduce a certain type of behavior that appears to fix the issue at hand.  The inverse also holds true.  A man might be able to tell you all about the parts of a car and how they operate, but ask him to replace the alternator, and he'll point you towards the nearest auto mechanic shop.  I've run into situations where I've worked with someone on a particular computer network problem, and because I knew a bit of the theory as to why things worked the way they did, I was able to remove a lot of possible answers from the solution set.  Whereas, the other person was still considering these things.  Oftentimes,  not enough  relevant information will cause one to drown in  too much  irrelevant information.  Not to say that I've never been the other person, because  everyone  inevitably finds themselves in those kinds of circumstances throughout their lifetime.  But I just wanted to make the point that theory and background information are just as important, if not moreso, then practical know-how and experience when dealing with problems of all types.    Through simple observations I've made during my short career, it appears to me that people are naturally inclined more towards one way of thinking than the other.  Personally, I find myself able to grasp the bigger picture better than I do the detail oftentimes necessary for practical application.  Ask me about a book I read a few months ago and I will tell you about the storyline, but I couldn't tell you the name of this or that character.  Sure, given enough time and repetitious study, I will probably be able to produce the desired results.  But a natural talent it ain't.  This is one of the reasons that I feel that in order to provide fully optimal solutions, it's often best to team up with someone who's of the opposite mindset on this matter.  Rare is the person who can competently bring both to the table.  Let me know your thoughts on this.

Check this out! :        You're  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland !   by Lewis Carroll     After stumbling down the wrong turn in life, you've had your mind opened to a number of strange and curious things.

Little is coming to your aid in discerning fantasy from fact, but the line between them is so blurry that it's starting not to matter.

      Most people tend not to think of themselves as living in historical times.  Often from our point of view, events don't seem to take on the same significance as narratives read about in history books. I'm not sure if it's just due to our microcosmic view of the world or something else, but...     These are extremely exciting and fantastic times we're living in.  Perhaps because the face of war on the planet doesn't bear the same face of most wars in the past, we fail to see the historical significance of it all.  I think we're in for a long, far-reaching (geographically as well as philosophically) battle.  The nagging thought in the back of my mind is that this war against terrorism will transform into a war against Islamic fundamentalism and eventually religious fundamentalism in general.  What happened at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, will most likely turn out to be the largest spark that lit the fires of future turmoil.    And in the context of reading  urlLink The Penguin History of the World , I find myself wondering just how the players involved will be viewed 100 years from now.   Will the United States go down as the bully who just sought to use terrorism as an excuse for imperialistic maneuvers?  Will it be viewed as country with a righteous grievance, which simply veered on a path to the left to eliminate a threat when it should have taken the path to the right (brute strength and resilience vs. diplomacy and international cooperation)?    How will history reflect on countries such as the  urlLink Philippines ,  urlLink Spain ,   urlLink France, and Germany ?  Of course they don't have all the same reasons for making the choices they have, but the outcome is equivalent.    To rehash a tired truism; only time will tell.    I'll probably post more on this topic later.    In other news... cool:  urlLink Hydropolis .  Perhaps in another world and time, but I'll be damned if that wouldn't be a big, fat terrorist target in this lifetime.

      Man this is just sad... I apologize for my absence (I'm sure it was like an earthquake interrupting your daily activities). I just have not been motivated to put anything up here. I still have a couple pics left to take on my disposable camera with the Fourth of July pics. Will get those up someday, I promise!    In the meantime, events at work are taking a major turn during the next few months, so it should make for an interesting plot twist. There's some major shaking and baking going on with the new casino going up, personnel changes, etc.    I finished  urlLink Conquistador . Not bad. I had hoped for a bit more focus on the American Indians (Sorry, Native Americans is just a bit too PC for my tastes) and their culture within the story, but other than that, I can't complain much. I really felt for the major characters of the book. Reading the novel really put me back on a history kick, so now I've started reading   urlLink The Penguin History of the World .  A bit dry, but very informative.  I wanted to get a larger view of macro-history versus the little tidbits I've learned here and there.  Wish me luck.    - HomerJSkillet

      I apologize for my stuttered posting as of late.  I don't know if it's a purely a phenomenon of the summertime or just a busy month.  Possibly a combination of both.  Either way, I'm sure my readership (which could probably be designated as a protected species) isn't too concerned.  I will have Fourth of July pictures for you soon, as it's just a matter of using up the rest of the pictures on the cheapo disposable camera I purchased.

      I will soon be posting photos of my adventures over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.  It was sublime.  The temperatures averaged out to about 102 F. under the shade and the water was so cool and refreshing.  A great time was had by all, and for the time being, I no longer need to worry about blinding small animals and children with my pale white skin.  In other news, I've finished reading my CCNP BSCI Exam Certification Guide, so now it's time to buckle down for the reviewing, practice test, and flash cards.  In the meantime, I'm  LOVING  my ReplayTV and I've been reading the truly enjoyable  urlLink Conquistador  by S.M. Stirling.  This is the first "Alternate History" author I've read outside of  urlLink Harry Turtledove .  Tah Tah...  - HJS

      Here's a great little article posted on Keith Burgess-Jackson's  urlLink Ethics of War  blog.  It concerns Islam's role in our "War On Terror" (which is a misnomer if I've ever heard one and in my view, has been the root cause of the current U.S. administration's many problems).  The following statement really stood out for me:  Because we in the secular West have made God a mere hobby, we don't comprehend how devout Muslims perceive reality. Our materialist-minded leaders prattle on about solving the "root causes" of terror--poverty, illiteracy, lack of democracy and so forth--because we cannot fathom the idea that hundreds of millions of people believe that obeying the God of the Quran is the most important thing in life.  This seems to be especially a problem with those of the leftist persuasion, since that is where humanism tends to hold it's grubby little head the highest.  Do you have any thoughts?  Bueller?  Bueller?  - HomerJSkillet

      I've come across some most excellent resources for those with literary aversions:   urlLink Unpopular Culture  was started by economic blogger  urlLink Jane Galt  (which for those of you who don't know, is an  urlLink Ayn Rand  reference, specifically from  urlLink Atlas Shrugged ). The premise of the site is to post daily bits of classic literature (Mostly pre-1923, so as not to violate precious copyright laws).  I remember stumbling upon a similar effort  urlLink here . While this was delivered through email, the Unpopular Culture site can be view through a web browser, or my favorite, via  urlLink RSS  feed!  Right now,  urlLink A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court  is currently being served up.  I've never read any of Mark Twain's work, so this is doubly exciting for me.  After reading the first few postings, I can see why people admire his writing so much.  He has a great sense of humor and his words flow quite smoothly together.  Not to be forgotten, I happened upon another site that is also utilizing RSS technology to post  urlLink The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci .  Easily one of the smartest persons to ever live, we now have the opportunity to take a daily glimpse into his thoughts.  Enjoy!  - HomerJSkillet

      Well I enjoyed a pretty good weekend up at the Folk's place. We celebrated both mine and my mother's birthdays. Family is a funny thing. The whole "There's good times and there's bad times" dynamic that ripples through familial relationships oftentimes make family gatherings quite interesting.  This time was no different.  Also, I always feel a strange bit of nostalgia when I visit my parents. I find myself yearning for the simpler times of youth more often than I probably should. It's only when I remember how much I yearned to grow up and be on my own that I snap out of it. Weird, it is...  My good buddy Bill is leaving for Australia soon. He's currently a supervisor and I'm hoping that I will have the opportunity to apply for his position.  He thinks I would be the best guy to take his place, but...    *RANT ALERT*     I feel a little slighted, because I was never once asked if I would like to fill his shoes, while a few other people I know were. I don't get it. I work my ass off getting this and that certification (and might I say that i'm the  ONLY  one in our whole department even making an attempt, let alone passing tests), try to keep things running smoothly within the confines of the site I help maintain, and have more experience then those who were asked if they wanted the job.   *END RANT*    Whatever.  I'm going to bring it up to my boss at my next review here in a couple weeks.  I've done nothing but work hard and selflessly for this company, and it's discouraging to say the least when they thank you by sh*tting all over your dinner.  Oops.  Guess I should have ended the rant here. :)  Okay, well I hope you all enjoy the rest of the work week.  Keep the peace.  - HomerJSkillet
