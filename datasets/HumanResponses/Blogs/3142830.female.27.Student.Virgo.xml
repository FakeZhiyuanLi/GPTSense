       Acording to internet rumors the Backstreet Boys will tour Asia for their upcoming album.&nbsp; Their untitled album is set for a October/November release.&nbsp; Much to the amazement of this BSB fan I think it's a safe bet that they'll conquer the world as they have&nbsp;before.

      Hello my fellow Backstreeters,  You're probably wondering why I'm adding this right now?  Well, as it draws ever so close to the Backstreet Boys album release time I am reminded of why the Backstreet Boys have meant so much to me.  So here it goes. I am reminded of how much their music has meant to me and how I supported them right from the start.  I suppose you could say I never really lost the desire to keep the kid in me. I know that I'll never acutally be a kid again but I can capture the moments of my care free teenaged years when I listen to the Backstreet Boys.  They keep me young and vital something that just doesn't happen with other groups.

      Hello, I thought that I might update my site a little bit.  This blog is to report that I wanted to tell everyone just how much the Backstreet Boys mean to me.  Their music, their group, everything. I suppose that you could say that the Backstreet Boys are going to occupy most of my life which is the reason for the Blogger website.  :)

      The Backstreet Boys have been an intricate part of my life for the past 7.5 years and nothing much has changed about my fandom.  But I would just like to say that as an adult fan I can say that the Backstreet Boys have touche my life in ways that they may never know about. This site is a tribute to my BSB devotion.  No I'm not obsessed with them.  Just devoted and love them.  :)  I will use this spot to keep up to date about current BSB events so stay tuned.  :)

         Rumors, Rumors, Rumors.      There have been rumors floating around the internet of a October/November release for the Backstreet Boys's upcoming album.&nbsp; Although this has yet to be confirmed I have no doubts that this will be a hot new thing for the Boys.  I think that the Backstreet Boys will prove to the critics as they always have that just because they haven't been around for a while that means that they can't start over again.&nbsp; Early next year the boys are planning a world wide tour of small and intimate venues so that they can get reaquainted with their fans.      There have also been rumors floating around that Brian will bring his wife and 1.5 year old son Baylee with them but it will only be at certain places for fear that it may be too much for Leighanne and the baby.&nbsp; Leighanne has stated that she and Brian want baby Baylee to know what his daddy does for a living.      Everyone seems to think that because the Backstreet Boys haven't been in touch with their fans that it means that the Backstreet Boys are over but in reality the Backstreet Boys have a new album coming out in October.&nbsp; :)
