						   Another day, another problem. Now my Mac G4 is acting stupid again; whenever I was to print something from MS Word, I have to totally reconfigure my printer or else it will shut down and erase my data. I figure I will work on my PC today and reformat may Mac, which should hopefully fix it.  It seems like I’m getting my Amplifier after all. After a semi-heated discussion with my parents, my Mom still stands bearishly on that I must save at least $2000 for a car before I can buy new equipment. My point is that I might not need a car in the event that I choose to go to the Armed Services. My Dad agrees with me, so I should be getting it in a week or so.  School is only a month and a half away! I have to get started on my AP Summer homework, but I don’t want to…  It seems my brother is getting an iPod mini, which are very sexy. I originally wanted one, but since I’m getting an amplifier, I guess I can’t have everything. Oh well, I’ll still borrow it from him.  Later peeps.  Song I’m listening to: Hash Pipe - Weezer

						   Buenos Dias, Amigos! I started the day today with a very wholesome breakfast: Leftover Little Caesers Breadsticks and a glass of Russian chocolate milk; the box of Trix was empty, and we didn't have much else to eat for breakfast. On the subject of breakfast, i encourage you all who have not indulged in a  urlLink McDonald's  McGriddle to do so; they are simply scrumptious.  I just recieved the new "Back 2 School" issue of CCS, I'll probably end up ordering some T-Shirts, a jacket, and maybe some shoes and a backpack. I'm still undecisive as to which shoes I want, but I am leaning towards the shoes I mentione before in my first post. The jacket I am going to order is just too cool. Go  urlLink here  and search for "Volcam Brescini Jacket" to see it.  It turns out I am able to get my amplifier I mentioned before. 30 watts of pure Tube-Amp power. Only thing I'm bummed about is the fact the the switch pedal for it costs an extra $179, so I will likely pass on that. On another note, my brother, Andrew, is supposed to buy a PocketBike when I buy the amp, so we'll be having a lot of fun for the second half of Summer.  Still haven't been able to get in contact with Louis. I got his number here, so I'll call him on my break. I have a lot of cool riffs made, maybe if we a make a song or two, it would be great. On that note, I learned about 4 songs yesterday to cover with my new band, so that's cool.  I will talk to you guys later. Until then...  Song I'm listening to: Rooftops - Hot Water Music

						   A new day, a new shirt. I feel trendy today; I'm wearing one of those Long-sleeve striped T-Shirts with the sleeves rolled up, like all the guys you see on T.V. Although I do feel a bit like a trendwhore, I must say I'm looking quite sexy and professional, which is something I haven't done since my interview for my job.  It's Wednesday, so I need to start planning on what I'm going to do this weekend. I'm thinking I'm going to talk to Louis and see what's up this weekend, maybe write a couple of songs with him.  A word for the wise: If you ever have the option of waiting in a car or in the Dentists office, chose the office. I spent nearly 2 hours yesterday in a car, and I must say as time goes on, the car shrinks and shrink. Plus, they have trendy magazines inside the office.  I plan on listening to Howard Stern right now at work again, but it's getting hard to contain my laughs; if only my cubicle had a door and roof...Artie from Howard Stern - "I got 99 problems but a Bush ain't one!"  Sayonara, my friends...  Song I'm listening to: Seventy times Seven - Brand New

						   Yes, I've found some time to post again on this debut-day of my Blog. This being the end of the day, I can reflect and say it was a good day. Little Caesers awaited me for dinner, and I was happy.   If you haven't lent your ear overseas, I beg you to do so; there are a multitude of great Post-Hardcore/Screamo/Emo bands coming out of Japan right now;  urlLink Nature Living  and  urlLink Tribal Chair  are amongst my favorites.   If you haven't noticed, voting season is dawning upon us. Although I will not be able to vote this year - a few months too young - I encourage you, if you can, to vote for the Kerry/Edwards Ticket, as the Bush/Cheney Regime have only brought us misery in the times when we need no more.     urlLink       Adios, and I will conversate more tomorrow. P.S: Darren says "Death to Bush"  Song I'm listening to: Ch-Check it Out - Beastie Boys

						   It's here, you've stumbled across my trendy, cliché Blog. This is where you can view my scribes and prose, see me spill my heart, and envelop yourself in me. Right now it's still under development, so don't expect too much content; I'll hopefully be able to post daily.   Work is the same drill, observing the website and their categories. If all goes well, I'll have my friend Darren working with me; perhaps work won't be so boring then?   Just finished chatting with Louis. He had a great song he was working on for our new band, still un-named. On the subject of our band, I have been thinking about purchasing a new amplifier, one with more power and versatility. I have been looking at  urlLink this  particular amplifier. Chances are I will buy it around August 10th, when I will hopefully get my new paycheck.&nbsp;  A glance to my kicks reveals a worn, old pair of shoes.  urlLink These  shoes entice and intrigue me. Purchase them, I might, not completely sold though. I do like animal prints...   My hair is getting boring; it's always the same. I recently did my own haircut for the first time, came out well. I'm wondering how I would look with blonde polkadots in my hair; it's a possibility.   I must bid you adiue now. Ciao. Farewell until the next post...   Song I'm listening to: Bonus Mosh Part 2 - Taking Back Sunday

						   Howdy all. The new Taking Back Sunday album is getting better every time I listen to it; I’ve got about half of the guitar parts from the album down, another half to go. In other news, I will be waiting in getting a new amplifier, because at NAMM (Biggest Guitar Show), they released a new model from the line I was going to buy, and this one blows out the rest. I’ll wait until Christmas to get it. For now, I’m looking for a new guitar, and successfully haggled the sales people at SamAsh to get almost $100 off their original price for the  urlLink PRS Tremonti SE  guitar.  Looks like I’m going to Pasadena today with my Brother to get his iPod Mini; they just got a shipment in yesterday, so he put on eon hold, since they go really fast.  Darren better get hired, because this job is getting more boring by the day. Hopefully, he can be my assistant and get some coffee for me every morning =D. That would be great.  Aloha friends…  Song I’m listening to: Radio - The Alkaline Trio

						   Hello All. Sorry about not posting this weekend; I was just too lazy. This weekend was okay, I guess. Here’s the breakdown  Saturday: Chill day. Didn’t do too much. Tried helping my brother call some places to see if they have the iPod Mini in stock, but no one does. Really bummed out when my guitar broke; it seems the portion of the nut right under the Low E string broke, so I can’t really play that string.  Sunday: Sunday was a little more exciting. I got my parents into the idea of me buying a new guitar. I think I will be able to in about a week. We went out to eat at Acapulco. While waiting in line, I saw Kenji Everett coming out, and he affectionately gave me a hug. My Dad thought he was a queer, my Mom was like that’s how some people shake hands.  On to today. I’m already bummed out. I guess somehow I left a pen in my pants pocket, so now I have a ruined pair of brown corduroys and a nice white shirt.  Well, I got to go to a meeting at work. I’ll see you guys soon, hopefully with a new guitar.  Song I’m listening to: Sic Transient Gloria…the glory fades – Brand New
