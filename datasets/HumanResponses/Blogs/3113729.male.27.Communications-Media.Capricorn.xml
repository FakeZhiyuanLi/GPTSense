      I'm going to San Diego on Sunday and will be there for a week. There are a number of things I'm looking forward to doing, but I wanted to know if anybody else (that has been there) knows of any places or activities or whatever that I should *make sure* we don't miss while we're out there. I just don't want to forget anything. I already plan on going to the San Diego Zoo and In-and-Out Burger. Other suggestions?

      I've been reading Walker Percy's  Love in the Ruins  for the past few wweeks now, and the further I get into it, the more I like it. After my conversation with you, Jeremiah, I made myself care less about the lapsometer's functionality and in doing so have started to appreciate the deeper facets of the story much more. I am thoroughly enjoying becoming fully immersed in Dr. Thomas More's growing paranoia and fleeting love affairs. I've got a chunk of time tonight by myself with nothing to do, so I'm planning on using that to get some more reading done. I thank you for giving me something to look forward to this evening.

      Well, it seems as though Matt Pamer has died. As such, we fellas making a weekend out of Lebowski Fest is not looking good, which is not to say that I'm not still up for it. But if that continues to fail to materialize... Jeremiah, last night we talked of you coming to MI in June. The dates for that weekend we discussed are June 26 + 27 (Sat + Sun). If you'd like to make it a longer weekend, that'd be great, but I'd understand if you had to go back for work or school or whatever. Two days doesn't seem like enough time for us to catch up, though. Another bit of news that may entice you to visit that weekend... Pedro's playing at the Magic Stick in Detroit on the 27th (of June).

      Guys, come on! Are you just being indecisive or what's going on? I've proposed a chance for all of us to hang out for a weekend, and nobody has made a peep about it. Are you forgetting that we haven't seen each other in almost TWO YEARS??? Let's go to Lebowski Fest and have a freaking good time!  I should've known better not to expect an RSVP for Lebowski 6.19, since I never even got one when you were IN my wedding...

      I just thought I'd mention this... Blogger now has a comment feature. So when you respond to someone's post, just respond by making a comment instead of creating a whole new post. That will make everything on this blog nice and clean. When you click to leave a comment, you'll be asked to log in to your blogger account because I have it set so only members of this blog can leave comments. One other thing: if you have not yet, take a minute to create your Blogger profile. You can upload a picture and stuff. It's similar to a Friendster page, but no testimonies and no desparate pleas for a date. Anyway, that's all.

      Ok, I thought maybe you and Matt would have gotten my email, went to my own blog and then responded about going to the 3rd Annual Lebowski Fest. But I obviously assumed wrong. So maybe you'll answer me here...want to meet me at  urlLink Lebowski Fest ? Let me know your thoughts. I think it'd be friggin' awesome!!!

      Did anybody else pre-order the Pedro album from Jade Tree? I got my copy in the mail yesterday, two weeks prior to its release. Granted, I've been listening to an illegal copy for the past two months, but anyway, now I got the real thing with all of Jesse LeDoux's artwork and everything. It's nice. Anyway, if anyone else has it, I want to know what you think of the album. I think it's Bazan's best offering since "It's Hard to Find a Friend".

      Jeremiah. I just found out, after you bought your plane tickets, that I can't take off any of those days that you'll be here. Plus, they want me to work Saturday, too. So it kinda sucks, but you'll be all alone during the day until about 3:30 each day. But then we can hang out and have a good time. Is that cool? Oh, actually, can we just meet at the Dairy Queen in on Middlebelt Rd. near the airport for some lunch, like on that Sunday? That's really all that I have time for.   *this is all just a joke

         [Astralwerks] • Jan. 27, 2004  urlLink AiR's Official Website   It’s hard to believe this is only Air's third proper full-length album. It seems like they've produced a lot more than that over the last 7 years. Hmmm, perhaps that's because they have. In between albums, Nicholas Godin and Jean Benoit-Dunckel have kept their hands full with several other projects. They’ve composed the entire score for Sofia Coppola's first movie,  The Virgin Suicides , as well as contributing a track to the soundtrack of her second film, 2003's listmaking  Lost in Translation . Last year, they colloborated with Italian author Alessandro Baricco for one seriously bizarre concept album,  City Reading  - basically, an artsy book-on-tape, with Baricco reading some highlights from his book over AiR's electronic cityscapes. It was well done, but definitely not something I could continue to get enjoyment out of after one or two listens. Maybe that's why there's a wealth of used copies on Amazon. Anyway, as you can see Air French Band has actually been quite busy, despite only releasing two “real” albums up to this point.  AiR's first CD,  Moon Safari  didn't leave my changer for, like...ever. It was the undisputed King of Bedtime Music in my room for four years or something crazy like that. The thing was monumental. Nothing could unseat it - that is, until Sigur Ros’  Agaetis Byrjun  came along. I saw  Moon Safari  in my wife's CD book before we were even dating, and I decided then that I had to marry her (j/k, honey).  On  10,000 Hz. Legend , they showed their French cool again, but at times it seemed like AiR wanted to experiment and toy around with new ideas and sounds at the expense of the songs. The album had its good moments, but it was almost too much weirdness. Maybe the biggest difference was that there was no more Beth Hirsch. Godin and Dunckel took up some vocal duties, along with a host of other guest vocalists including Beck, Jason Falkner and Ken Andrews (Failure). But perhaps the real problem was that it just lacked the simplicity of the first album. The songs just weren't really there.  Sure,  10,000 Hz Legend  had a couple really good tunes on it, but who can really say they weren't a little disappointed with it? Not to worry, though, because this new album marks a splendid return to form for AiR.  This  is what we were all waiting for after the mesmerizing  Moon Safari  blew us away back in '97. Rather than sacrificing the integrity of their songs in the name of experimenting, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel stick to their guns on  Talkie Walkie  and deliver a superb, hypnotic album with nary a weak moment.They've basically refined their sound. The result is an album that proves yet again that AiR are in the indisputable champs of ambient, chillout music.   The record maintains a mellow feel throughout, which is to be expected; there's plenty of lightly picked acoustic guitar layered over sleep-inducing pianos and synths. At some point, they picked up a banjo, learned how to play it and must've liked what they heard because it shows up on at least two of the tracks here. Although it seems unlikely, it's actually a nice touch. They've even utilized some good ol' whistling, which is catchy as hell. I find msyelf whistling "Alpha Beta Omega", like, everywhere I go - I think the last time I caught myself was in the bathroom, which is the penultimate place for whistling, in my opinion. The vocals on this album are not as abundant as on  10,000 Hz , and where they are present they're more understated. Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval adds her vocals to one track. Other than that, it's all Godin and Dunckel this time out. All the vocals are nestled in there just right. Instead of detracting attention away from the lush instrumentation, they garnish the songs quite beautifully.  And just as they have done on previous albums, AiR have included something they're famous for: one "it's-almost-so-cheesy-that-it's-lame-but-somehow-it-works" song. In 1997, it was "Sexy Boy" and in 2001 it was "Radio #1."  Talkie Walkie 's version is the sixth track on the album, "Surfin' On A Rocket". It's almost ridiculous, but for some reason that is completely beyond me, it succeeds. In fact, I'd argue that it's the best track on this CD. Maybe it's the strikingly Japanese-accented vocals that have me sold. Maybe it's the My Bloody Valentine-esque walls of distorted guitar floating in the background (Kevin Shields must’ve rubbed off on them a little while recording stuff for  Lost in Translation ). Either way, I'm a sucker.  "Alone in Kyoto", which does double duty on Coppola’s  L.i.T.  soundtrack and as  Talkie Walkie ’s closer, is a perfect example of how AiR can completely put you into a state of deep hypnosis in less than five minutes. I think I hear the ocean. I think I hear outer space. I'm gone, dude. Fast asleep. Do NOT listen to this while operating heavy machinery.  Every song on  Talkie Walkie  is superb. Simply put, it's memorable, maybe not as much as  Moon Safari  but easily more than  10,000 Hz. Legend . It's memorable enough for me to keep remembering it when I'm scrolling through the unending list of albums stored on my iPod, looking for something good to listen to. I went into this one with some trepidation, but have come out of it relieved and overjoyed. It's extremely pleasing to see AiR back on track, creating music as wonderful as this.

         [V2/Bmg] • January 27, 2004  urlLink Elbow's Official Site   Elbow’s sophomore effort finally sees its stateside release, after UK record shop owners cleared some space off their shelves for it 6 months ago. Eschewing some of the darker themes that their debut, Asleep on the Back, was absolutely swimming in, Elbow offer up a little bit more hope and encouragement on Cast of Thousands. A few tunes border on gospel rock - London Community Gospel Choir and all - calling to mind the best songs by Jason Pierce's Spiritualized. Others come dressed in schizophrenic, angular guitar hooks. All the while, Guy Garvey sounds like the beautiful bastard child of Peter Gabriel and Talk Talk's Mark Hollis.  You’re not going to find a huge difference between  Cast of Thousands  and  Asleep in the Back , Elbow’s debut. I guess you could call this a natural progression. Maybe the one thing that makes it a bit better than their first record is the use of balance. This one’s not all dark and melancholy. In contrast, there are some more hope-filled, uplifting tunes throughout. The difference is subtle, but the dynamic makes a big impact.  The record opens up with “Ribcage”, a song with the same feel and lyrical theme as one of their first singles, “Newborn” from  Asleep in the Back . Over naught but some electronic warbling, Garvey sings “We blew the doors, didn’t we? / Pissed in their champagne / and did a real thing, didn’t we? / Gave ourselves a name / and peeled away the shame / I wanted to explode / to pull my ribs apart and let the sun inside”. And with that the song’s ribs are pulled apart and the first glimpse of the sun we get is a fitting heartbeat-like drum fill. It's like all of a sudden, the song was given life. It then continues to build for the next minute or two, until the London Community Gospel Choir slowly creeps up behind Garvey. The whole choir thing comes off alright, but I just wonder if Garvey really needed them to achieve what this song does. He’s strong enough to carry this song on his own, so why the choir? I'm astounded at how this band can achieve such grandiosity in their sound with such minimal instrumentation. It's quite remarkable. Maybe they should have employed that here. Nonetheless, it's still pretty formidable.  After a couple more songs, the next song worth noting is the fourth track, “Snooks [Progress Report]”. Immediately, I love it. Tribal sounding drumbeat, erratic spooky guitar feedback. It’s got such a cool feel to it. I imagine myself in the middle of an African safari, like hunting for an elephant or something (I realize I sound like a total dork, but you listen to it, and you’ll understand).  At this point, Garvey starts to really hit his stride. His voice is so soothing and reassuring, I find myself turning to him for daily advice. At this point, I think I’d do just about anything he told me to. He owns me. “Switching Off” is a beautiful, sparse ballad with a subtle shift about 3 minutes in that will leave you wishing the song wasn't on it's way out. Then comes “Not A Job”, the midpoint of the album and a tune that steadily builds with each part by adding more and more layers of twinkling guitar and warm keyboards and other assorted instruments. These two songs are a perfect illustration of the great balance I referred to earlier.   “Buttons and Zips”, the ninth track, is probably the catchiest song on the record. It begins with a really cool guitar progression and a few doo-doot-doo’s. I’m already sold, but by the time the chorus sneaks in so naturally, saloon piano and handclaps in tow, I’m absolutely won over. This is the melody that you'll find coming to mind hours and days later, stuck in your head in a good way.  “Grace Under Pressure” is a gospel rock anthem that doubles as a testament to love’s great power. It practically sings like a hymn, albeit a modern one with only one verse, repeated over and over (“Grace under pressure / Cooling palm across my brow / Eyes of an angel / Lay me down"). The London Community Gospel Choir teams up with Garvey for appeareance number deux. This time it works better than in "Ribcage".    Cast of Thousands  is an album that is capable of propelling this band to a level where they could be rubbing, um, elbows (sorry) with the likes of Coldplay. They would surely deserve such attention, but sadly I don't really see them getting it.

         [Epitaph] • January 20, 2004  urlLink The Special Goodness' Official Website   With this re-release of an album that came out only a year ago, Weezer drummer Pat Wilson's The Special Goodness ultimately fall short of said previous band's more memorable and fun rock anthems. Wilson's vocals sound like he's just trying to do his best Rivers Cuomo impression, which really isn't much of an achievement seeing as how Cuomo's vocals - though very likable -  are pretty unremarkable. Besides, they pretty much miss that mark, anyway. The songwriting is relatively sub-par with the exception of maybe a couple tunes, "Big Idea" and  "In The Sun", which both contain some pretty good melodic hooks. Other than those two tracks, though, everything else is pretty lackluster.  It may make for some o.k. listening while driving around on a sunny Friday afternoon or something, but that's not enough to redeem Wilson for his failure to step out of Weezer's shadow and define himself as an original act. Mainly because of its lack of creativity, this record is probably only worth picking up if you're a die-hard Weezer fan who must have anything and everything within six degrees of the band.

         [Sony] • January 6, 2004  urlLink Phantom Planet's Official Site   My initial feeling after first putting this disc in was one of disappointment. Phantom Planet's last album, "The Guest", was full of such well-crafted pop songs, it made the perfect soundtrack for a summer drive in the afternoon, perhaps on the way home from work. When you first pop in Phantom Planet's newest offering, it's clear right off the bat that you're in store for something different. Further listening, however, and some open-mindedness will uncover a pretty solid outing here.  On this self-titled release, Phantom Planet have strayed from the gleaning production of “The Guest” in favor of more of a "garage rock" sound, to use the term loosely. It’s tough to say how this will be received. The shift may alienate those fans of theirs that couldn’t get enough of "California", the theme song for Fox’s hit show "The O.C." On the other hand, it's hard to say if fans of the NYC garage rock sound will take a liking to what Phantom Planet have attempted to do on this record, maybe seeing them as poseurs.  By marrying crunchiness, tight guitar work, some really catchy melodies and lead singer Alex Greenwald's lazy snarl, Phantom Planet have created something that gives me reason to forget all about Julian Casablancas and his band of NY hipsters. The album's opening track, "Happy Ending," could have fit pretty well just about anywhere on the Strokes' newest record,  Room on Fire , and Greenwald's ordinary-yet-charming vocals are surprisingly akin to Casablancas' own.  "1st Things 1st" comes out of the gates swaggering, its verse containing one of the strongest vocal arrangements found on  Phantom Planet . It's a breath of fresh air, as it follows two somewhat disposable tracks ("Badd Business" and "Big Brat"). As great as the verse sounded, I was really hoping for something in the chorus that delivered something at least equally melodious. However, it fails to do that. It still manages to hold its ground as an enjoyable song worthy of repeated listening.  "You're Not Welcome Here" - seems to be another of many tunes on this album laced with animosity towards an ex-girl (most likely). Greenwald, obviously embittered, belts out the lyric, "Upon the hour of your arrival / I will draw the line / You take your side of the city / Don't set foot on mine" over a steady, stomping bass drum and OKComputer-like guitar spasms. This builds up to what turns out to be a great, rousing chorus.  A minute and sixteen seconds into "By The Bed," we hear a nice little drum beat build up and drop over a wash of warm bass lines until, over the course of a good minute, the head-bobbing, fist-throwing chorus slowly settles in and takes over. "Knowitall" has a really cool, slinking melody in the verses. The descending bass line really drives it. There's also this little beat that reminds me of those drum pads on that keyboard you had when you were 12. For some reason, don't ask me why, it sort of reminds me of, like, Phil Collins' "Another Day In Paradise"...except it's cool.   "After Hours", the eleventh out of twelve tracks on  Phantom Planet , is perhaps the most enjoyable listen of the whole record. It's got a shuffling beat and a bouncy bassline coupled with really catchy vocals. Throw in some handclaps and it ends up being a lot of fun, with sort of a party feel to it. It also hints that these guys are really not as unhappy as some of the other songs have indicated. My only complaint about it is that it's too short - over after less than three minutes. Just as I'm really getting into it, it's on its way out. Sort of a bummer. But I guess brevity could be better than a song that lingers around too long, repeating itself and growing tiresome. I don't think that would’ve been the case with this tune, though.  It takes a couple listens to get you over any prior expectations you had going in. Once you give it that, however, you'll find that later these songs have the capacity to resonate within you. It's nothing revolutionary - they're not pioneering new musical ground or anything. Pretty formulaic, actually, but they do it extremely well. Greenwald again shows that he's still got a nice, tight stranglehold on writing great hooks and melodies - one that doesn't seem to be letting up, even as Phantom Planet venture off into darker territories. Let’s hope he doesn't end up following drummer Jason Schwartzmann's example and leave the band in pursuit of an acting career.  Phantom Planet have again accomplished something that not many bands can do - they've made an album that both me and my teenage sisters can enjoy...sort of like "The O.C." I think that’s called a guilty pleasure.

         [Tooth & Nail] • February 24, 2004  urlLink Starflyer 59's Official Website   Jason Martin and his ever-changing supporting cast that make up Starflyer 59 have made a pretty solid career out of cranking the amps up to 11. So why should he change anything?  I Am The Portuguese Blues  is another hard-nosed, balls-on-the-wall, all out rocker, harkening back to the days of his first three albums (this is now his 8th full-length). Right around the fourth or fifth album, Martin's sound changed a bit. It was a subtle change, not a huge departure by any means, but it was noticeable nonetheless. The songs took on somewhat of a breezier, poppier feel. Even though Martin was still making good use of his wide array of effects pedals, the Beach Boys influence was thrown out there a lot more often than the previous comparisons to Smashing Pumpkins and the sort. Don't get me wrong - even with the change, I thought Starflyer kept improving with each album.  Something, however, has sparked Martin to put all of that behind him and fully revert to his old ways, which he hinted at doing on last year's  Old . So he dug up this batch of songs he had written during the recording of  Americana  and re-recorded them. His vocals seem grittier and blues-ier than ever before on "Unlucky", and the raucous guitar chugging and screeching solos throughout the whole album remind me of something from a Black Sabbath or Iron Butterfly record. "Sound on Sound" is very Zeppelin-esque, and "The Big Idea" is just a classic Starflyer song that sounds like it could fit perfectly on  Silver  or  Gold , Martin's first 2 releases.  This album also does a good job of maintaining the signature blue-collar feel that has marked all of SF59's previous works. I have to wonder if Martin's truckdriving day job has anything to do with that. This guy is, like, the John Henry of indie rock. A little birdie by the name of Woodsie told me that Starflyer's already headed for the studio next month to start working on a promised 2nd album for 2004. But while  I Am The Portuguese Blues  may only be "the new album" for a few months, it won't be getting old in my headphones anytime soon.

         [Gooom] • February 17, 2004  urlLink Cyann & Ben's Official Website   Cyann & Ben are the newest act that have sprung forth from the up and coming French label, Gooom - the same people that last year brought us M83's bombastic and beautiful  Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghost . Gooom's two most promising prospects could both easily fall into the category of "ambient", but where M83's atmospherics all-out huge, blowing people away with their My Bloody Valentine-inspired electronic shoegaze, Cyann & Ben opt for the quieter reaches of the imagination, lulling you into a trance with gentle guitar picking and heavenly piano tickling. The drums add just the right touch to drive some of the more climactic songs along, but mostly stay quietly understated and light in the back of the mix, when they're even present. Add to that some lushly orchestrated keyboard arrangements, modest touches of computer blips & beeps, and the delicate, ethereal vocals of both the male and female halves of Cyann & Ben and what you end up with is a work of staggering virtuosity and brilliance.   Imagine what the sound of flowers blooming would be like, and then listen to "I Can't Pretend Anymore" and you probably won't be too far off the mark. Some of the songs veer into what some might consider dark territory. In those instances, such as on "Beyond Reality", I'm reminded of early-Massive Attack. Regardless of the different moods, it's beautiful throughout - right down the same alley as Sigur Rós, if I may namedrop, but not quite as cinematic in scope...and you can understand the lyrics.

         [Arts & Crafts] • February 10, 2004  urlLink Valley of the Giants' Official Website   Here we have the debut album from this collaborative outfit that includes members from some pretty big Canadian names (Godspeed You Black Emperor, A Silver Mt. Zion, Do Make Say Think, Broken Social Scene, Shalabi Effect, and Strawberry). It's important that you not go into this one expecting something similar to BSS's  You Forgot It In People  or G!YBE's  Lift Your Skinny Fists... , because you won't find anything of that nature here. Regardless, what we have here is pretty impressive in its own right. It seems the foursome went into this project with the goal of capturing the ambience of the "Old West" (just take a look at the cover) and for the most part accomplish that quite well.  Five of the eight songs are barren instrumentals that each end up building into something quite a bit more sprawling and grandiose by the end, sending your mind off to a place where tumbleweed traverse the dry desert ground and vultures circle over cactii in search of fallen cowboys. The only problem is that, ranging from 6 to 10 minutes, they can grow somewhat tiresome. You may be tempted to hit the skip button before it gets interesting. Only three of the tracks on Westworld feature vocals and one is just a story - a compelling account of a teeny lil' tiny lil' penguin and a whaling crew, recalled by a gentleman with a thick French-Canadian accent.  Anyway, as a whole, I thought Westworld made for an interesting experience and one that was well executed, but ultimately falls short because there are only one or two tracks that I'd want to revisit with any regularity. Coincidently, they are "Westworld" and "Bala Bay Inn", the very two that feature Deidre Smith's vocals. I'd be interested to see what this group is capable of outside of the conceptual constructs to which they confined themselves for this album.

         [Record Collection] • February 3, 2004  urlLink The Walkmen's Official Website   The Walkmen took NYC by storm in 2002 with  Everybody Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone , an album that was equal parts beautiful and dizzying. Not to take anything away from that album - because it was one of the best that year - but  Bows + Arrows  puts it to shame. It's more of the same ingredients, but executed with more focus and variety and rocking out a bit more. On the album's strongest track, "The Rat", frontman Hamilton Leithauser belts out the vocals with so much passion and urgency - something that I didn't notice  E.W.P.T.L.M.I.G  was missing until now - that he almost sounds like Bono circa Joshua Tree and War. It's absolutely energizing. The whole album envelopes you in a wash of reverb, chiming guitars, shimmering cymbals, piano lullabies and, of course, Leithauser's signature vocal delivery. Frankly, I don't understand why some have written this album off so quickly (cough, cough, Rolling Stone!). Maybe it's just because there's nothing here for Saturn to use in its commercials this year.

         Here's one of the better pictures I got from the Sufjan Stevens show in Ann Arbor this past weekend. I'm still waiting for somebody to come out with a camera that has an automatic setting for taking pictures in clubs. Why is it so difficult? So frustrating...I'm spent. But, anyway, I was fortunate in that it was a tiny club and I was very close to the stage. So that helped me salvage a few decent photos. All I can say is that I did my best. After toying with my camera for too long, I just gave up and decided to pay full attention to the performance rather than trouble myself with trying to capture it on  film  - eerrrr, memory stick.   So anyway, here are a couple other pics I took during the show:   urlLink Sufjan   urlLink Denison Witmer   Also,  urlLink Relevant Magazine  just added a  urlLink new interview with Sufjan  to their pages.

         The weekend cannot come soon enough this week. My anticipation can be attributed 100% to the hope and promise of an extraordinary evening with Sufjan Stevens in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Originally, the only date he was going to be playing in this great state was in Grand Rapids, a good two-and-a-half or three-hour drive. Recently, however, we discovered a new date was etched into the schedule to pass through Ann Arbor this Saturday with Denison Witmer and Rosie Thomas in tow. Ann Arbor is an hour or less away from our home.   Dana is working Saturday. Normally if Dana has to work, this means that the show is a no-go, simply because not getting out until 7:30pm puts a really big stick in the spokes, if you will. This obstacle has been eclipsed by one wonderful bit of news: the Blind Pig is not even opening its doors until 9:30. As such, I will be at the show, and I will have the added privelege of having my lovely wife accompany me. We'll have time to get ready, scarf some food down, and make the drive to Ann Arbor, arriving at the Blind Pig right on schedule. It would have been nice if Dana didn't have to work at all on Saturday, so we could spend the day in downtown Ann Arbor, but you gotta take what you can get. So, anyway, the show will be amazing. Sufjan could make a very strong case for being my favorite artist working right now. Two other really good acts are with him. And we will be there with smiles.

         [Placid Casual] • April 19, 2004  urlLink Super Furry Animals' Official Website   First of all, let's make this one thing clear right from the get-go. Everybody's favorite Welsh tunesmiths are not offering us any truly new material here with  Phantom Phorce . Basically, the Furries have put their 2003 release  Phantom Power  into the hands of an assortment of DJ's, knob twiddlers and computer nerds and said, "Do what you like with these, fellas."  So, as I was saying, you're not going to find anything that fresh for the ears here. Granted, the songs have been cut up and manipulated and some have taken on a new shape more than others, but the bottomline is they still do not compare to their original recordings. Thus, this album is really quite unnecessary.   I'm not saying you should completely disregard it, however. There is Kieran Hebden a.k.a. Four Tet's remix of "Piccolo Snare." This is the one single track out of them all that comes close to doing any damage against the prior version. I might even venture out there and say that it is more enjoyable to listen to. Four Tet proves yet again that he is the man with the Midas touch nowadays. Sort of like what he and Manitoba did for the Notwist's "This Room" from their  Different Cars & Trains  EP earlier this year, Hebden does his best to salvage this collection singlehandedly, and almost succeeds. However, one very solid track out of more than a two handfuls = not enough to make this worth purchasing. I recommend downloading it and then buying  Phantom Power  instead, if you haven't already.

      What a beautiful weekend. The weather in Michigan is finally getting nice. We had a little glimpse of summer this weekend. Sunny, high 70s. It was so nice. We got the gas grill - that we won from Home Depot -  assembled without any difficulty. So once I get the tank filled with propane we'll be barbecuing as much as possible. I can smell steak already.  Yesterday, I pulled out the hose and washed my car and then vacuumed and Armor-Alled® the inside. We were going to do both cars this weekend if it was nice, but we couldn't do Dana's Jetta due to a substantial snafu. Saturday afternoon, as we were pulling up to the movie theater to catch a matinee with Dana's family, the passenger side window made a loud popping sound and completely dropped down into the door. It wouldn't go back up. So no wash for "Betty". Instead, she sat in the garage for the rest of the weekend.  I finished cleaning my car just in time to catch the Pistons take care of business. It was an exciting game to watch. They totally rolled over Milwaukee. If they can keep playing like that, we're gonna roll right through this series. I gotta like our chances to go the Finals this year the way Detroit's playing. Now, to see if I can score a couple tickets to a home playoff game.  Today, one thing I've got to do is begin finalizing vacation plans. We're gonna hit San Diego for a week in late May. Hopefully, it'll be a sunny and warm week. It'll be cool to drive around the coast, check out the San Diego Zoo, maybe SeaWorld. I'd like to see Big Sur. I've heard it's beautiful. And then we were thinking of stopping by Newport Beach and looking up the Cohens. I think Sandy, Kristen, and Seth (and Ryan) would love to have us pop in, hang out in the poolhouse for awhile, say "Hi" to Captain Oats...it'll be a fun time had by all.

         APRIL 13, 2004 - THE MAGIC BAG (FERNDALE, MI)  Last night, we made our way down the road to the Magic Bag for the opening date of this tour, shared by two Toronto songwriters who, as it turns out, have built quite a little following for themselves: Hayden and Sarah Harmer. Never heard of S.H.; I came for Hayden, who was owner of the opening spot on this night. That was a shame, because what it entailed was a shorter set than the last time I saw Hayden, two years ago in the very same venue, when he played for a good hour and a half or more. Lots of songs, lots of interacting with the audience. That was one thing I remembered being a real asset to his show. I remembered him being really down-to-earth and likable, telling stories and making fun of himself and stuff. His demeanor hasn't changed a bit. And neither has his ability to perform his music well live, even if he was only armed with his slow guitar strumming and harmonica (he was sans piano on this night).   Being the first night of the tour, he was a little rusty, messing up in the middle of songs a couple times or having to start over after playing the first ten seconds or so of a song. But it didn't happen too much and more importantly it in no way detracted from his performance. Rather, it made it more enjoyable and more "real". It was a very intimate and forgiving setting. As far as the material goes, he mixed everything up well: four or five new songs from his forthcoming album, Elk-Lake Serenade, which comes out May 11th, a few from 2002's Skyscraper National Park ("Dynamite Walls", "Bass Song", "Carried Away", & "All In One Move"), and one of the first songs he ever recorded, just about ten years ago, "Stem", which is a favorite of mine. Highlight of the set, though, was "Bass Song." As he described with a slight grin on his face, "this is a song about when I got murdered".   After seeing Hayden twice now, there's one thing I can say. I don't want to miss out on him the next time he comes around. The only bad thing about it? I wish we had gotten to the club earlier so we could've gotten seats at a table. We had to stand on the side because the place was was almost full already.  After a brief break, Sarah Harmer and her band took the stage. Frankly, I was surprised at how many people clearly came out for Sarah Harmer. I thought Hayden was the bigger draw. I hadn't even heard of her before, but once she got up there the people filed down to the front floor area below the stage in droves. I couldn't help but wonder where she built this big following. Judging from the look of the crowd, which had no shortage of spiky-haired, mens' dress-shirt-wearing girls, I made an educated guess. It wouldn't come as any sort of surprise to me if she had once been a part of the Lilith Fair. I'll have to find out for sure who she's supported in the past.   Anyway, she was pretty good. Dana said she thought she had a pretty voice. I probably couldn't argue with that. I couldn't get Rosie Thomas out of my mind for most of her set. She reminded me of her a lot. But Sarah Harmer probably had a few more upbeat numbers than Thomas would have had. I don't know. I haven't seen Thomas live, so I guess I can't really say. Before her set, I heard one guy arguing with another about Hayden and Sarah Harmer. This loudmouth thought Hayden wore his influences on his sleeve too much and that Sarah Harmer was more original and "filled a musical hole", as he put it. But I could sit here and easily rattle off a number of female songwriters who make very similar music: Thomas (as I already mentioned), Leona Naess, Lisa Loeb, Patty Griffin, Lucinda Williams...Beth Orton, even. Well, Orton's probably a little bit of a stretch, but I might still store their CDs next to each other on the shelf. But that's just a few names. So that guy was an idiot, but I'll still give Harmer credit. Even though she may not be as original as Loudmouth Over There thought, she still injected some freshness into that sound. It was still good, honest music sung with a sweet voice. And I'd rather listen to her than Sarah McLachlan or Jewel any day of the week. Overall good show. Probably something that almost any girl would like, so if you've got one bring her and she'll have a good time. I just got tired and my feet were killing me from having to stand through both sets, so towards the end there my attention span got really short and all the songs started sounding like ones she's already played. Better than staying home and watching American Idol, though.  See if the tour's headed for your town and if it is, go check it out. Here's the rest of the dates (Hayden will only be at the shows with a ** after it):   4.14 Chicago, IL (Martyr's) ** 4.16 Pittsburgh, PA (Rex Theatre) 4.17 Alexandria, VA (The Birchmere) ** 4.19 Philadelphia, PA (Theatre of Living Arts) ** 4.20 New York, NY (Tribeca Rock Club) 4.21 Boston, MA (Paradise Rock Club) ** --   Jon, you should go, dude!   4.23 Portland, ME (Big Easy) 4.24 Burlington, VT (Club Metronome) ** 4.26 Toronto, ON (Winter Garden Theatre)  4.29 Montreal, QC (Cabaret Du Plateau) 5.01 Rochester, NY (Water Street Music Hall) ** 5.02 Buffalo, NY (The Tralf Music Hall) ** 5.09 Vancouver, BC (Commodore Ballroom) 5.11 Seattle, WA (Crocodile Cafe) 5.12 Portland, OR (Aladdin Theater) 5.14 Reno, NV (The Garage @ The Hilton) 5.15 San Francisco, CA (The Independent) 5.19 Los Angeles, CA (Knitting Factory) 5.21 Santa Fe, NM (The Paramount)

      Twisted Nerve has announced the tracklist for the upcoming release of Damon Gough a.k.a. Badly Drawn Boy's newest album, One Plus One Is One. All Twisted Nerve will say about the record's release is that it'll be "out this side of summer - so we believe". The people there have listened to the final product and have this to say about it: "Well, we've had it in the office now since last week and (although we're bias!) it is simply 14 tracks of sheer bliss. We think that this is by far his most sublime and satisfying album to date, even, dare we say it, better than 'Bewilderbeast'." Well, that's a dangerous statement, verging on overhype. I don't know if it'll be that good. But I'm sure it will be pretty good, because...well, because he's Badly Drawn Boy. He's a proven player. Anyway, here's the songs...   1. One Plus One Is One 2. Easy Love 3. Summertime In Wintertime 4. This Is That New Song 5. Another Devil Dies 6. The Blossoms 7. Year Of The Rat 8. Four Leaf Clover 9. Fewer Words 10. Logic Of A Friend 11. Stockport 12. Life Turned Upside Down 13. Takes The Glory 14. Holy Grail

      I found this article on FoxNews' website and it gave me a good laugh, particularly the segment which I have bolded about midway through the article:    APPLE COMPUTER'S CUTE LITTLE iPOD PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYERS SURE ARE POPULAR - MAYBE TOO POPULAR.  British thieves are so fond of swiping the pricey MP3 players that police this week asked iPod (search) users to consider switching to boring black or gray headphones, the Daily Telegraph reports.  Turns out the standard white "ear buds," which identify an iPod user immediately, are mugger magnets.  "People need to use common sense," said a West Midlands police spokesman. "Using different color headphones might be useful to pretend you were listening to something cheaper, such as a portable stereo."  Crime rates in Britain have soared in recent years, with muggers known to snatch cell phones and other electronic gadgets right out of users' hands.     "A man asked if I was wearing an iPod," said Birmingham student Roland Baskerville, "and as soon as I told him 'Yes,' he pulled a knife out and started waving it at me, saying 'Well, hand it over then.' I gave it to him and he ran off."    An Apple spokesman contended that iPod users would "rather be robbed" than suffer the indignity of appearing to use different personal music players.  "It's up to the consumer if they want to use black or gray headphones instead," he said. "Some users really like the coolness of being seen wearing an iPod."  Gary Parkinson, a magazine editor, told the newspaper the theft appeal comes with the territory.  "You are an obvious target," he explained. "The other problem is that the iPod is so shiny and lovely you want to get it out and show people. This attracts criminals like magpies."

         MARCH 30, 2004 - ROYAL OAK MUSIC THEATER (ROYAL OAK, MI)  Well, the Death Cab/BK show was great last night. Here's my report:  First of all, it turned out to be an all-ages show, which means one thing: tons of high-schoolers. I've never felt so ancient in my life. But the sight of one guy who looked like he was 35 and had wandered in from the bar next door, beer-in-hand and decked out in his dressy attire, trying to mack on a group of teeny-bopper girls...the sight of that sad sack made me feel quite a bit younger and better about my place in that crowd. I don't think we stuck out too much, anyway, as I noticed a proliferance of zip-up hoodies and messy hair. I was right at home.  So...the music. As I could have predicted, Death Cab was the best band of the night. Some other band called Aveo (new labelmates w/ DCFC) put on an absolutely lackluster performance to open the night. They were completely self-indulgent and boring as hell. Horrible. And most annoying was that I couldn't take my eyes off of the singer/lead guitarist's left knee. He had, like, restless leg syndrome or something. It was so obnoxious. No matter how hard I tried to watch something else - ZOOP! My eyes would go straight back to his bouncing leg. But definitely the worst thing about them was just that their songs totally sucked and were completely un-memorable. Well, except for that first one where he'd throw his head back and let out some kind of Indian battle-cry a few times (wo-wo-wo-lalalalala-hoo!). I won't forget that...cause it was hilarious! So, here's a tip. If you're planning on catching this tour further down the road, you don't have to worry about getting there early or even on-time. Plan on missing the first act. They're not even worth talking about anymore.  So, yeah, then Death Cab came on and put on a stellar performance. They're such rockstars now. It's funny. Dana especially enjoyed watching the bass-player, who I said looked exactly like George Castanza sans glasses and bald pate. He was pretty funny to watch. But this did not overshadow their set. Everytime they started a new song, I saw the kid next me quickly scribble down its name on a torn-out page of scrap paper. This induced a small chuckle within me. I thought it just a bit too obsessive. I even overheard a girl ask him "Why do you write them down???" Anyway, operating on memory alone, I managed to retain a good portion of the songs they played, which included some faves of ours. Here's the ones I can remember:   The New Year A Movie Script Ending Title and Registration Lightness Styrofoam Plates For What Reason Photobooth Debate Exposes Doubt Pictures in an Exhibition Company Calls Tiny Vessels Transatlanticisim  In case you're planning on catching them later, you can probably expect to hear most of these same songs, if not all of them. That's all the ones I can remember. There may have been a few more. But it was an opening slot, so they didn't play as long a set as the last time we saw them at the Majestic Theater. Nevertheless, it was a great performance.  Kweller came out and before he could get going some kind of "technical difficulty" sprung up with the bass amp. So he made good use of that time in the shadows of the stage to strike some quite laughable rockstar poses in his black leather motorcycle jacket, red Converse all-star hi-tops, and most notably some eyebrow raising super-tight jeans. I had to laugh. The guy is just strictly amusing. I'll give him that. Anyway, they worked it out, or so it seemed and the band got going. The first few songs were rockers that I couldn't get into because they were so mediocre. And Kweller's backing band was pissing me off. They were schlubs. I was pretty disappointed at this point. But after getting those cruddy songs out of the way, BK started to work in his good tunes - old and new - and the show took a noticeable turn toward the better.   "Sha Sha" was a highlight, but possibly the the best part of his set for me was "Family Tree", never my favorite BK song but one I always liked still. The reason this song was the most memorable of the night for me was not so much the song itself, although it had a hand in it, but what happened during it. I hate to say it, but I was actually almost "touched" during this song, and by the unlikeliest of people: these four teenagers that were about six feet in front of me. After a few glimpses of them earlier on in the show, I already had them pegged as superficial, arrogant punk kids. I mean, the one leader kid was, like, acting so cool with these two girls and his buddy, showing off his muscles in this small green wife-beater shirt. It was truly pathetic. I won't go off on him anymore, because I realize now I was being completely judgemental and I feel ashamed of myself for that. But anyway, later on, as Ben Kweller was singing, "You are...my family tree / Be good to me / Take care of me", I looked down at him and his group of friends. They were slung all over each other, arms over shoulders and swaying back and forth for the whole song. They looked so close. Like they were the best of friends, a tight-knit family to each other. I imagined these kids waking up at their separate houses and each one thinking about what the four of them were gonna do together that day, because they did everything together. Made me nostalgic for my own high-school years when I was learning to grow up and trying to find purpose in life. You experience a closeness with your friends at this point in your life that's almost indescribable. You cling to each other and your happiness totally depends on them. They're your life. I realize I probably sound totally ghey talking about this. Please don't make fun of me. I guess it was just a snapshot in my head that stuck out for whatever reason. Maybe just because I miss all the close friendships I used to have. I have Dana, and she's the best friend anyone could ask for. I don't want it to sound like I'm downplaying that at all, because I couldn't make it without her, but you know how it is - people need more than one really great friend in life. And I guess I just miss having that, with all of mine living hundreds of miles away. They're still my friends, but it's not the same being so far away from them, not being able to hang out with them and stuff. It's just not. Anyway, you know who you are. I'll just say that I miss you guys and wish we were all still living within a 15-minute drive from each other.  Geez, veering off the trail a little bit, huh? Sorry. Back to the story at hand...Kweller's set was much improved after the first few rockers. His band left the stage to open it up for him to do a little solo acoustic thing for a few songs, which I really enjoyed. He did this new song called "On My Way" that I really liked and then, of course, the obligatory cover of "Ice Ice Baby". I really thought after seeing him do this at three shows before that I wasn't going to enjoy it, but...man, I still did. It was good. It was good and completely humorous.   Well, that's about it. We ditched the show a little bit early cos it was getting late. As much as I was enjoying the show, I was wicked tired. I found myself staring straight ahead during most of Kweller's set, unable to focus or closely follow what was going on onstage. I was drifting off into zones. Perhaps that's what caused me to go off into that weird tangent of a daydream as I was watching those four kids. Anyway, with work starting early in the morning, it was way past these geezers' bedtime, so we split.

      Got a pretty sweet evening ahead of me. Death Cab tonight - right here in Royal Oak, on my own stomping grounds. Ben Kweller's the headliner (?). We've seen BK a few times now; he's always the supporting act. So it's weird that this time he's the big name on the marquee, especially with DCFC on the ticket. Weird. But anyway, he's still cool. Not the best, but he's always pretty fun live. The upside is if it's getting late and we're bored with Kweller, we can just go because we'll have already seen Death Cab! Anyway, every frog and toad knows that Death Cab puts on a good show, so that should make tonight a good one.

         Dana, her dad, and I spent the weekend (half of it in the car) in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, visiting Dana's grandparents (Barb & Clem) in the nursing home. It's a 7+ hour drive and we headed out about 3:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. We were all pretty wiped out because we had been watching  urlLink Game 5 of the Pistons/Nets series  on Friday night at 8:00pm and it went into triple OT and lasted about four hours (one ot the BEST games I've EVER seen, seriously -even though the Pistons ended up losing the game). So we ended up not getting much sleep before the drive. Nevertheless, we managed to survive and actually made really good time. We got into Marquette at about 11:00am and checked into a cheap hotel. Once we got the car unloaded and got washed up some, we went over to the nursing home and picked up Grandma & Grandpa Laurila.  None of us had eaten yet, so we went out to lunch, followed by some clothes shopping for Barb & Clem at Kohl's, and finally a visit to Grandma Laurila's sister and brother-in-law, Marie & Wiljo, who are in their late 70s/early 80s. They were both very nice people. I especially enjoyed visiting them. (Sidenote: I got to see a bird fly smack into the window of the family room - it was so great!) It was a good opportunity for me to meet some family on Dana's side for the first time and sit down with them over some much-needed coffee and not-so-much-needed, but nonetheless delicious, homemade butterscotch-chip cookies, courtesy of Marie. Wiljo was a really nice guy with some above-average storytelling skills, particularly when sharing the one about finding a bear on his back porch with his head in the birdfeeder. Nice, dude! So, that was our Saturday.       Sunday, we went back to the nursing home in the morning and picked up Grandma and Grandpa again. We took them to Wal-Mart and out for a drive around Prisque Isle Park (sp?) close to downtown Marquette, where I took these pictures. It's right on Lake Superior, I think. Really nice view of the lake. There's a cool little harbor and several loading docks for these big ships that come in. We even got to see one out there. It was huge. There's also a lot of woods right there off the shore, so we were hoping to spot some deer or maybe...a bear? Maybe...??? Naw, no dice.  After driving around there for awhile, we hit the Red Lobster for some lunch, stopped off at another nursing home to say hello to Uncle Ben (Clem's brother-in-law?), who was in pretty bad shape. Grandma & Grandpa Laurila weren't even sure if he recognized them. The place was givin' all of us the creeps. It was bad. So we didn't stick around there for more than a few minutes. Then we headed back to Barb & Clem's nursing home and played some cards with them for the afternoon. This weekend was my first time going to visit them in the nursing home and it was good because I got to see for myself that the home was really nice, comparatively speaking. It was not your typical nursing home. G&G are definitely getting good care there and, because of both of their respective health situations, are probably better off there than if they were at home by themselves. Anyway, they seem to be in reasonably high spirits and l think they've settled in there nicely. So it was good to see that.     Later in the afternoon, we started our trip back home. We had to jump off the highway about an hour and a half away from home - in Bay City - so we could watch the fourth quarter of the  urlLink Pistons/Nets Game 6 . We were having a really hard time getting it in on the radio, so the pitstop was a must. We hunted down a sports bar and got to see the Pistons beat Jersey on the road, tying the series and forcing a Game 7 back in Detroit this Thursday. I wish I had tickets to Game 7 so freakin' bad!!! This series has been absolutely incredible! Once the game was over, we hit the last leg of the trip. With two Woodchuck ciders in me, I conked out in the backseat for the remainder of the trip, my iPod drowning out any and all outside noise, except for that of Havergal's newest record,  urlLink "Elettricita" . It's really good. Thanks to  urlLink Kaleb  for sending me that disc. I got it in the mail Friday, just in time for the weekend's tour de force.  To me, it was a good weekend. It felt more llike a week, though, with all the time we spent in the car and being in the U.P., which is a complete change of pace from Metro Detroit. Time goes by slower up there, I think. I still can't believe we drove 7-8 hours twice in two days. That's freaking crazy.

      Here I am with another link to yet another  urlLink Sufjan Stevens interview , this one courtesy of the people over at  urlLink JunkMedia . Not a very deep interview, but somewhat amusing. Sufjan's answers are quite...brief. Maybe because he was being asked boring questions that he's been asked a hundred times already. Anyway, it's there for you to read. And it will be there later if you're too busy right now.

       urlLink     Tickets go on sale today, brothers!!! This has really captured my attention. I'm very excited at the prospect of it. All things Lebowski for three days and Jim James and the fellas in My Morning Jacket  providing the soundtrack to the weekend. I really think this would be a great opportunity for me and my friends in VA/NC/KY to see each other since it's been quite awhile and have a total blast. It's on a weekend. It's centrally located (about the same distance to Detroit and VA/NC) and fairly inexpensive, man. And best of all, it's a festival celebrating "The Big Lebowski"! What more needs to be said? It would be a non-stop laughfest!    o     o     o   Checked with my lady friend and she is okay with it, so now I just need to see about my friends (if they can make it). Compadres, if you think you could make it out there,  urlLink e-mail me  this week!  This has got me so amped.     Note about accommodations:  The hotel they're directing travellers to is right next door to the bowling alley where the festival is being held. It's $65 a room up to 5 people. So if there end up being four or five of us, we could get a double and it'd be dirt cheap. But I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of people turning up for this thing. It's only the third one but it sounds like the turnouts have become more and more surprising each year they've held it.  I had my brother, Dark Rider and the Yellow Dart in mind, specifically. Others are welcome to join, though. Don't feel I'm leaving anyone out. If you want to make the drive to Louisville to join us, then by all means, join us.  Okay, I want people to get back to me on this promptly. If people are with me, we can order tickets, reserve a room and what-have-you before it gets too late.

      I've just got one thing to say about last night's O.C. (besides that it was better than the final episode of "Friends" will be tonight): Simply put, it was straight...up...poignant.

      Well, sadly, the first season of "The O.C." is coming to an end tonight (Wed., May 5 on Fox 9/8c). This show has completely absorbed me over the course of the last 9 months. I became addicted to it after two episodes. Now, I gotta have my fix each week. But tonight will be the last time I get it until the fall probably. Anyway, I know the finale is gonna be good. A lot of stuff is up in the air. Seth and Summer are shaky cos of the Dad, Ryan and Marissa are on the rocks with this latest bit of news about Theresa's pregnancy, Julie and Caleb may or may not be getting married tonight, Jimmy laid Caleb out at the end of the last episode. That leaves a lot to be tied up. So, what I'm trying to tell you is...just  don't  miss it. Oh, and for those 21+ folks reading this who like the sauce, you might enjoy this:  urlLink The O.C. Drinking Game . Just stay in for the night if you play.

       urlLink     For $150 bucks, you can have the one, the only  urlLink David Barnes  paint your portrait with all kinds of interesting creatures and mechanical doodad's and whatnot - it's up to you to choose what goes in it.  David is the brother of Kevin Barnes, leader of the Elephant 6 band,  urlLink Of Montreal , and he has done almost all of their  urlLink CD artwork  over the years. So take a look at his extensive gallery of portraits and other drawing he's done so far and decide if you'd like one of yourself. I'm seriously contemplating it. One thing sure to be included in my portrait: polar bear(s).

         Last Friday, I went to see  urlLink Michael Moore 's new documentary/political piece,  urlLink "Fahrenheit 9/11" . Since then my buddy  urlLink Ben  has posted a few of his remarks regarding the film on his blog,  urlLink Bar-Talk . A few comments have been added to his post by some of his frequent visitors, including me. They have done nothing but prove that this movie is controversial to the bone. I went pretty in depth there with my thoughts on the film and war in general. If this interests you,  urlLink head on over there . Go ahead and chime in, if you'd like, too. Here or there.  If you don't want to read over it (it's kind of a lot), here are some of my opinions, in a slightly smaller nutshell:  Michael Moore spread himself too thin. He doesn't dig deep where it counts. Instead, he skips around covering too many issues and none of them thoroughly enough. It showed.  On top of this, the film is  extremely  one-sided, mainly because of everything that Moore leaves out of it. He only uses facts (of which some were pretty flimsy), anecdotes and footage that support his claims and he completely omits anything and everything that might counterattack his stance. Of course, it should be noted that - and this is no shocker - Moore probably wasn't all that concerned with making an objective movie. I don't think it would surprise anyone to know that his primary goal with this film was to sway people away from re-electing Bush in the upcoming elections, even if it meant misleading them. I find this to be somewhat insulting.     By choosing to be strictly subjective, Michael Moore sacrifices his credibility in exchange for manipulative power. Which is greater? That's a good question. I might argue the latter. In addition, I think he subjects his film to rightly being considered false propaganda. Many people hanging in the balance will not notice this and be easy prey for Moore's manipulation, some just blindly accepting his claims. That's a shame, as I think people in general need to start thinking for themselves more, rather than regurgitating whatever the media feeds them - I don't care if it's from FoxNews, Michael Moore, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Penn or their church pastor. Just think for yourself. I was taught this at a young age. It's a good idea.  Though I have all these probelms with "Fahrenheit 9/11", there is still some value in seeing it. First of all, it's important that everyone keep an open mind to hear other people's opinions. It's important to look at the big picture here and I think the main thing that Michael Moore is trying to get across is that the war that is being fought right now must stop. He may not go about it the right way by laying every single ounce of blame on the Bush family, but at least it seems that his convictions are in the right place.  There are also a few moments in the film that are extremely powerful and worth remembering. He does express some valid concerns about actions that took place after Sept. 11th and before our attack on Iraq. It's just that he doesn't explore them...and he HAS TO DO THAT if he's going to make the kind of claims he's made and expect viewers to take him seriously. Otherwise, I'm just going to assume that there's nothing at the end of those trails he's led us down. At the very least, "Fahrenheit 9/11" will provide fresh material for some interesting conversations and debates.  Other people's thoughts on "Fahrenheit 9/11":  urlLink Matt LaBash (The Weekly Standard)   urlLink Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun Times)   urlLink Jeffrey Overstreet (Looking Closer)   A couple interesting side notes:  -The theater where I watched this movie was located in the Great Lakes Crossing mall in Auburn Hills, MI. That should ring a bell if you've seen Moore's other film, "Bowling for Columbine". Moore visited it in the movie.  -I went with my friend Sam and his friend, Brian, who I just met the day before. Before the movie started, we bumped into a group of guys who both of them sort of knew from when they were all at Michigan State. After we walked away, I found out from Brian that one of those guys was Robert Hamburger - creator of the  urlLink Official Ninja Webpage: Real Ultimate Power ! It was so cool. And by cool, I mean totally sweet. He wanted to meet up later and let off fartbombs in the mall....

         Wow! I was just about to put together my own little analysis of the film, "Saved!" (I had a summary typed out and everything!), but after reading over  urlLink Brett McCracken's review over at Relevant , I don't think I could say it any better.  As always, the readers' comments following the review are just as amusing and infuriating as ever, further illustrating the points the film was trying to make. Enjoy - and go see the movie!

         A good friend of mine,  urlLink All-Business Dave (ABD) , has spent the past 5 years or so steadily plugging away at a clothing line he began while in college, cleverly named  urlLink "ChurchXClothes"  (the "X" is silent). Over those years, he's been through a lot of hills and valleys, but has remained dedicated to his vision. Judging by his prolificness as of late, it seems like he's back on the up & up and beginning to really nail down what it is he wants to achieve with his t-shirts.  One main thing Dave and his small team of artists aim to do with their designs is to create images that question our "comfort-zone" way of thinking and cause us to step outside of the bubble that many Christians build around themselves - the idea being that the images will spark some relevant and meaningful conversations between people and challenge us to take action. Some of Woodall's designs prove he is not afraid of having the finger of accusation pointed at him or being labeled controversial or offensive. In fact, he practically  urlLink welcomes it . Now, ChurchXClothes is about to release a new line consisting of 10 t-shirts, and ABD is looking for some help. He has assembled about 20 designs and is planning on an initial printing of about half of those. What he's looking for is some willing people to take 5 minutes out of their busy lives to offer him some feedback. Go and take a look at the  urlLink new batch of designs , and then leave him your comments, ideally listing your favorites. I already did and I urge you to do the same. Just do me a favor and don't cast any votes for the one that looks like a "God's Gym" shirt. This is one rare moment where Woodall's keen judgement slipped out the window. It happens to the best of us, though, so I can forgive it...as long as it doesn't end up on cotton. Still, there are more ideas and designs that hit the mark than ones that miss. Dave's just looking for someone to help him do some weeding. So go and give him your input, then check back later to see if the ones you liked ended up getting printed (in about 2-3 weeks). If you're lucky, they'll be there and you can land one (or some) for yourself. This is a great chance to have an impact on CxC and support somebody that's doing his darnedest  to incite some positive and necessary change in our culture.

         If you've been missing out, well, you better get a freaking move on before it's too late.  urlLink Pedro the Lion , in an unprecedented move of sheer kindness, is offering  urlLink one MP3 download a day  from the tour that he is currently on, educating the masses about his newest album,  urlLink 'Achilles Heel.' .  And I'm talking straight from his tour! He's playing a show, then the next day he sends the website dude the sound board recording, and all of a sudden - shazaam! We're hooked up with our very own peek into the previous night's performance. That's pretty sweet! Just keep in mind, each one is only up for a short time, so you gotta be on top of your game if you want to assemble your own 4-disc live box set at the end of the tour. Now, the only thing is you need to enter a username and password when you access the downloads page (cough cough friend/enemy). Oh, gosh, I gotta take care of that cough! Someone pass me the Halls...

         A couple months ago, when I sat down to take in a little film called  urlLink "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" , out of nowhere I was blindsided by  urlLink this trailer  for a film called "Garden State", written and directed by Zach Braff (known best for his role on TV's  Scrubs , but famous in my home for looking  exactly  like a former classmate of mine, Jim Kelleris...or a young John Ritter - you choose which comparison suits your fancy).  Well, two months later, after having listened to Frou Frou's "Let Go" (the song featured in the original trailer) like a jazillion times, Fox-Searchlight has released a new and different,  urlLink internet-exclusive trailer . So now I have a couple more songs to listen to get me through the next month and a half (the Postal Service's "Such Great Heights" and Travis' "Love Will Come Through"). I must say this is looking like one of the most promising movies of the summer, right alongside  urlLink "Hero" . And I'm sure I won't be disappointed, based on all those olive branches I saw sprinkled everywhere. C'mon, July 30th. Get here already.

         I don't know what to say about the Pistons showing everyone that this trophy belonged to us, other than that I enjoyed every tick of the clock watching it happen - not just last night, but all season long: every Ben Wallace rebound, every block, every shot that Rip Hamilton sunk after curling around a screen, every second of it all. It was all so sweet! ...(Hi-5!!!)

         If you haven't seen the  urlLink "Napoleon Dynamite" trailer  yet, you absolutely must do that...now.  It looks like one freaking hilarious movie, in the same vein as, say, a Wes Anderson film (but probably not  THAT  great). Of course, I don't know if you can quote me on that, because I have yet to see the movie myself. But from the looks of the trailer, it looks like it would be something right up my alley. With dialogue full of terms like, "flippin' sweet" and "liger", this looks to be a classic that will supply us with an endless arsenal of laugh-inducing quotes for when we're among buddies. Just check out the trailer. You'll see what I mean. This may  establish Jared Hess (the writer/director) as a name we'll need to remember. Check the  urlLink official "Napoleon Dynamite" site  and join the  urlLink fan club  (which is a genius move itself). Then you'll have access to a list of dates where free screenings will be held throughout the month of June, as it opens in more theaters. There most likely will be one in your city. There are 2 here in the Detroit area.  A word about  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite's opening weekend at the box office .

         Dana, Today is our anniversary. Hard to believe that it's already been two years, isn't it? June 9, 2002. It's a day I will never ever forget. That's for sure. Because it was the most monumental, thrilling day I have had the pleasure of living in all of my 27 years (or is it 28? Wait, am I 30?). On that day, I experienced a level of happiness and sheer joy that was unspeakable. Many would say that their wedding day was the happiest day of their life. I could certainly agree with that. Little did I know that you would continue to bring that much joy into my life on a daily basis for another 730 days straight. And here it is, the awesome thought for the day: I have that to look forward to for the rest of my life. Because you don't have to do anything other than just being you, lovely you, like you have done so perfectly well for the past 2 years (I think it must come natural to you).  And so, my sunshine, thank you for everything you have brought me over the last 2 years. Here's to another 70+! I love you immeasurably. Happy Anniversary!   Completely and utterly head over heels for you...still, Mike (xo)

         Just wanted to take a moment to bring  urlLink Feist  to everyone's attention. Leslie Feist, one of many contributing members of  the revolving door Canadian rock outfit that is called the  urlLink Broken Social Scene , has taken an eraser to her first name and just released her second solo album - first that I knew of, though. And let me tell you, it will take you over. She is the three sirens that Homer spoke of, combined into one. She's like the female equivalent of Jeff Buckley, minus some testosterone. So, to those who know me, it should be no surprise that I haven't been able to exit the "Feist" playlist on my iPod since I got my grubby little hands on this gem three days ago.  I'm won't even bother trying to describe the album for you because you simply need to hear it for yourself. The folks over at Arts & Crafts know this. They're not dummies. That's why they've made the songs available for streaming download on  urlLink Feist's official website . Once you hear them, though, be forewarned. You'll want to listen to Feist at work. You'll want to listen to Feist in your car. You'll want to listen to Feist at the dinner table. You'll want to listen to Feist in bed. All day Feist, everywhere Feist. So you better just go buy the CD or else the only place you'll be able to experience this bewitching album will be in front of your dumb computer. And that's just plain troubling.   Let It Die  has only been released in Canada and the UK so far - that's the bad part. The good part is that, nonetheless, you can still get it for only 10 bucks, which is measley, especially for an import. Just go to  urlLink the Arts & Crafts store . You can thank me next time you see me.

             Just yesterday I got on here real quick to leave a short note about how I don't have enough time to do any posting until the end of this week, but I just had to put something up about this:  The  urlLink Detroit Pistons  knocked off the Indiana Pacers last night in a  urlLink very ugly Game 6  of the Eastern Conference Finals  (but who gives a crap - we won!) . With the win, the Pistons have advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since the 1989-90 season, which is when the "Bad Boys" won their second of two titles in as many years. It was so great to see Joe Dumars, the Pistons President of Operations, lofting the silver Eastern Conf. Championship trophy above his head after the game, for the first time since fourteen years ago when he did it as a member of the Pistons championship team in 1990.   I also have to add this: I  love  Rip Hamilton. The kid has been going off and is just now starting to garner the attention he has long deserved. He lit it up against Indiana all series, even when the Pacers tried to stop him by throwing "supposedly" the toughest defender in the leaugue, Ron Artest, at him.  So, anyway. I'm totally psyched for the Pistons/Lakers series to start. Game 1 is Sunday, June 6th. The majority of people out there are already counting us out against the L.A. in the Finals, but I like our chances. The only thing I'm worried about is the refs not giving our tough defense and rough-and-tumble style of play a chance against the Lakers. The league and its refs have a reputation of giving superstars the special treatment, blowing the whistle anytime someone so much as runs anywhere in the vicinity of Kobe or Shaq. Barring that, I think we've got a good chance to win. We match up against them really well. We've got a slew of 7-footers to throw at Shaq, two of which can step outside and knock down long jump shots, which will force O'Neal to step out from under the basket and make it easier for us to attack the rim. Besides, our D is gonna give 'em absolute hell. So go ahead - bring it, L.A.!

         Well, I didn't want it to end, but our vacation has sadly taken that route, with me kicking and screaming the whole way back. So now I am here in the Great Lake State once again. I will hopefully have some posts up here soon to share with you about our trip to CA and show off some more pictures. But since we just got back, I have a lot of other things to catch up on that are pretty important. So I've got to take care of that first. But I hope to get back to posting real soon. So...I'll see you.

         I'm not normally much of a fan of movies of this nature. In fact, It's safe to say I really abhor most of them. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I'm so shut off by them without carelessly throwing out a cliched excuse. But here comes a movie out of South Korea that will help me explain my feelings. It doesn't do that by illustrating how bad these films are. On the contrary, it gives me some hope for this overworked and exhausted genre we call "the romantic comedy".    My Sassy Girl  seems to do all the things right that most bland and predictable romantic comedies do wrong. It tells a touching, believable love story - both funny and enjoyable - that is complimented by carefully contstructed visual imagery and noteworthy acting that stretches from hilarious to endearing.  The movie is broken up into two halves (and an overtime?!).  The first half begins with us being introduced to Gyeon-Woo, a hopeless college student, lacking motivation in his academic ventures and lacking direction for his future. In the meantime, he just enjoys hanging out with the guys, drinking Soju and chasing after girls that are "his type". Everything is going smoothly, until one night he spots a young drunk girl in the subway station, teetering on the edge of the tracks. Noticing a fast-approaching train, he grabs her just as she's about to go over the edge and saves her. On the subsequent train ride, she passes out. Gyeon-Woo is mistaken for her boyfriend and, as a result, he feels obligated to take care of her. So begins their rocky relationship. However, he's about to get more than he bargained for getting involved with her. Because while this girl may look pretty, a girl needs to act pretty, too. And this girl is far from that. Yet no matter how many embarrassing situations she puts him in or how loud and domineering she is towards him, Gyeon-Woo puts up with it all because he's intrigued by her. He's able to see inside her, behind the smokescreen, and notices a vulnerability - an inner sorrow, an actual heart - and thinks maybe he can help to heal her.   In the second half of the movie, we still get to see Gyeon-Woo beat up and put through the ringer with the girl (we never are given her name), but not as much, as traces of her soft spirit begin to come out and make themselves more apparent. After awhile, it becomes clear that both have developed feelings for each other. However, the girl has some issues from her past that need to be worked out before she can move one. Plus, her mother tells the girl she's not aloud to see Gyeon-Woo anymore. That's how they break up and that's how we are sent into...Overtime!  Before Gyeon-Woo and the girl break up, they decide to write each other letters that express their true feelings for one another and place them in a time capsule, burying it and planning to come back and meet at the place two years later to open the capsule and see if their fate has changed at all. It sounds really cheesy, but it's really not as bad as it sounds. Normally, this sort of stuff would find me totally phasing out, probably falling asleep. But unlike most other romantic comedies, which skip past an important step and insult you by forcing you to put up with hoky stuff from the onset of the story before characters have been developed,  My Sassy Girl  waits until you're attached to the characters and genuinely care what happens to them before it gets all emotional and idyllic. And that makes a BIG difference.  Cha Tae-Hyun puts in a solid performance as Gyeon-Woo. Of course, playing the girl's punching bag probably isn't too demanding of a role, but nonetheless his facial expressions are completely hilarious throughout and when the movie gets serious he does a good enough job holding his own. Jun Ji-hyun, playing the girl, however, deserves most of the credit here. From when we first meet her in the subway station, all drunk and abrasive, to when we see her begin to soften up and expose that vulnerability, Ji-hyun showed she was more than capable of pulling off that sort of wide dramatic range convincingly. Without it, this movie probably wouldn't be as strong as it was. And I'll bet the American remake of this film (the deal's already been made) will suffer for that exact reason.  I keep asking myself how in the world I stuck with a romantic comedy for over 2 hours without getting put off by cheesiness, which though it is scarce is certainly not completely absent from  My Sassy Girl . I guess it's just balanced out with more entertaining and believable material than fluff. Plus, great performances from the leads. The story was full of unexpected surprises and comical situations. The laughs were not forced, meaning the humor was of much more of a realistic, that-could-have-actually-happened nature. Also, I feel like I came away with something from it. Like  Amelie , this is a movie that will remind you take advantage of life's little accidents and small pleasures. All in all,  My Sassy Girl  was a very enjoyable movie, even for someone who usually balks at romantic comedies. I wish there were more of them that pushed the boundaries of that genre like this one did.   urlLink Official  My Sassy Girl  Website  (warning: the site is all in Korean)

         Hope this isn't too last minute. Anyone who has the  urlLink Sundance Channel , you may want to tune in at 9pm tonight to watch  urlLink "Anatomy of a Scene" , which will be looking inside one scene from the movie  Garden State , examining some of the challenges that writer/director Zack Braff and his crew had to work around during filming. For a fairly small film, this little movie has created a pretty large stir thanks to word of mouth and one of the best trailers in recent memory. It has received tons of praise at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and it has legions of people clamoring all over each other on message boards, talking about every little thing related to it.   Garden State 's scheduled to hit theaters August 6th. With all the anticipation for this movie building up inside many of us over the past few months, this TV special should be just what we need to hold us over until we can actually see the film next week. I don't think there'll be any spoilers, so don't worry.  The show will also be airing at the following dates and times (EASTERN): Friday, 7/30 - 11:30 PM  Saturday 7/31 - 1:30 PM Saturday 7/31 - 10:45 PM Sunday 8/1 - 7:30 PM Monday 8/2 - 8:30 PM  In related news, it looks like Fox Searchlight's  urlLink official site  for the movie has added a ton of new content since the last time I visited: a photo album, video clips of interviews and a heap of behind-the-scenes footage. Also, they've added  urlLink Zach Braff's very own blog  to their page. He, of course, is doing it to generate buzz for the movie, but I still think that's pretty cool -  to see a director putting forth so much effort to get more people to see his movie. I can't see Steven Spielberg or whoever putting in that much time. Anyway, I'm just glad they're giving us something to keep us busy while the long wait is finally drawing to a close.   Go see it August 6th! I'll be taking Dana with me to go see it at the Main Art Theater in Royal Oak that night. If anybody else wants to go with us, leave me a comment and I'll get in touch with you before then.

         Felt like seeing a movie for some laughs last week, so four of us went out and saw  urlLink  Anchorman   together.   It was pretty funny - good compared to most of the other big screen former-S.N.L.-castmember trash that's come out before. Will Ferrell does his usual thing here, so if you don't like his brand of humor, this probably won't do anything to change your mind about that. Fortunately, Ferrell happens to have my number. So I got several good laughs out of it. But it's been a little over a week since seeing it and, other than the newsteam turf war and the scene on the bridge to Coronado Island, I've already relegated all other memories of this movie to the basement of my brain. Hence, I am unable to give you a proper synopsis of the movie.  If anybody was expecting this to be worth the price of admission, you're kidding yourself and you know it. I knew this going into  Anchorman , but just decided to play one of my "what the hell" cards at the ticket window. With that sort of attitude, you won't feel like the movie was a waste. But if you're a tightwad, I'd recommend you save yourself fifteen dollars by waiting until it comes out on DVD and renting it one night when you're in the mood for some dumb humor.

         The last book I finished reading was  urlLink  Life of Pi  . It was a really great book. I highly enjoyed it and so I wanted to mention it here before I got too far along in my other readings and forgot to do that.   Life of Pi  tells the story of Pi Patel, a 16-year-old boy from  urlLink Pondicherry, India . Pi possesses a highly inquisitive mind, fascinated by both the animals in his father's zoo and issues of spirituality. During his childhood and adolescence, he meets three men of different religious authority who all leave an indelible impression on him. Each man has helped Pi realize that he loves God. But when the men find out that Pi is practicing all three religions, they urge him to choose just one. Pi, however, doesn't understand their closed-mindedness, so he just chooses to ignore them and go on loving God the only way he knows how.  Soon, his family decides to move to Canada and bring the zoo with them. So off they go, aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with all their animals. Everything seems to be going smoothly, until disaster strikes. In the middle of the night, Pi hears a loud crash and, rushing to the deck of the ship, realizes several animals are on the loose and that the ship is rapidly sinking. Pi manages to survive by landing on a lifeboat after some of the ship's crewmembers throw him overboard. He's not the only one that survives, though. Pi watches the ship sink from his position on the 15-foot lifeboat, which as it seems already had a crewmember: an ugly, vicious hyena. Not only that, but soon a zebra has leapt from the ship onto the lifeboat, injuring itself in the process. The zoo's beloved orangutan has also made its way onto the lifeboat by way of floating up to it on a massive bunch of bananas. But perhaps most daunting of all is Pi's final companion, who swims up and climbs into the boat with Pi: a 450-lb. Bengal tiger named  urlLink Richard Parker . All of this makes it sound like this is going to be a Disney movie or something, with talking animals and everybody getting along, but it's not like that at all. Rather, it's almost too real. It's a visceral, extraordinary tale of Pi's struggle to stay alive.  Stranded at sea with this unlikely bunch, Pi must use his smarts, courage and faith to will himself to survive. However, in the midst of such a crisis, there's a good likelihood that all three of these things could take a backseat to panic, fear, and hopelessness in Pi's mind. The 227 days at sea make for a long journey, arduous  but never draggin on or lacking in excitement. It's exhilirating to witness how Pi manages to co-exist with these animals (Richard Parker, especially), battling thirst, hunger and the great expansive Pacific Ocean.  In the end, Yann Martel offers up a slight twist, letting the reader decide what parts of Pi's account are actually true or the work of a super imaginative boy who loves stories; it's cleverly done and a perfectly fitting end.    Life of Pi  has a certiain sort of timelessness and wonder that is sure to have me coming back and re-reading it again and again in the near future..and probably the distant future, as well. I'd highly recommend it to everyone. And that's not something I can say about most books.   urlLink Official Canongate Site for Yann Martel's "Life of Pi"   urlLink Buy "Life of Pi" on Amazon.com

         Dana and I ventured out to a huge antique sale that was being held in a parking structure in downtown Royal Oak this weekend. We went down there, hoping to find some cool things for our home. It seemed to me when we got there, that it was more like a massive flea market than an antique sale. There was so much junk and crap there. But we did find a couple things that were worth buying for really cheap prices. Dana found a small glass pitcher that she thought would be really cute for serving orange juice at breakfast and also some kind of copper-wire butterfly thing that you stick in the ground somewhere in your garden. All normal stuff you might find while perusing antiques.  Then there was me. With my keen eye, somewhere in all the rubble, I managed to find the kind of stuff that floats  my  boat: the one single table of DVDs in the whole joint. It was all crap I'd never heard of, b-movies and nudy films. But lying there amidst all the garbage, like a desert oasis, was the  urlLink  Yeah Right!   skate video, glowing bright green and adorned with a round yellow sale sticker, denoting its mere $3 pricetag. I had heard good things about this video before from a couple different reliable sources. That certainly piqued my interest. But even before that I knew of it as a product of Spike Jonze's masterful direction (well, co-direction). To coin a phrase of my own, "if it was done by Spike Jonze, give it to Mike Jonze." So, naturally, I scooped it up with my super duper worm-like voracity!  Now I don't claim to be a skateboarder. I tried it when I was younger and I was pitiful. I never was able to learn how to "olly" and I may have even just spelled that term incorrectly. But that doesn't negate the fact that I have always been drawn to the whole skateboarding lifestyle. I wanted a pair of Vision Streetwear shoes in seventh grade  real bad . I still love Vans. But, above all, and more importantly, I always thought it would be the best if I could actually skate. I scorned God for not blessing me with the skateboarding skills. Despite this, I still gave it a few more attempts over the course of my adolescence and even into college. But I just couldn't stick it. I don't know. Maybe I just got discouraged and quit too easily.   But no matter how many times I came to the conclusion that I couldn't do it, something would end up coming along and stirring up that desire in me again and I'd go back out there and try it again. After watching Stacy Peralta's  urlLink  Dogtown   on IFC last week and then picking up this "Yeah Right" video and watching it this weekend, I can sense that feeling coming up in me again. I told Dana last night while we were walking out of church, "I'm gonna get a skateboard." I can hear those little voices in my head telling me it's a stupid idea. I'm too old to start now. I'm still not gonna be able to olly. But I'm still feeling that urge in me to try it again. Even if it means cracking my skull on the sidewalk. But whatever happens, I will always be intrigued by dudes that skate.  Yeah Right!  is a perfect example of why I remain intrigued to this day.  The people behind this video have done an incredible job and come up with maybe the best skate video I've ever seen. It's starts out with a dedication via montage to the late Keenan MIlton, with some words from one of Milton's close friends spoken over video of him skating. It's a touching way to pay tribute to his life and what he did for the skate world. What follows is an hour and 20 minutes of some amazing street skating done by everyone on the Girl and Chocolate skateboard teams, including  urlLink Mike Carroll ,  urlLink Rick McCrank  and  urlLink Eric Koston  (this dude is unreal). I don't think I'll ever fail to be impressed by the inventiveness that skateboarders continue to show, making regular landscapes around them like sidewalks and park benches look like the reason they were put there was to be skated on. Thrown into the middle of all this great skating, there's a pretty amusing cameo by actor Owen Wilson ( Royal Tenenbaums ,  Meet The Parents ,  Bottle Rocket ). He does some trash talking that will have you laughing but then he backs it up and you'll definitely be shaking your head in semi-disbelief.  It's pretty obvious where the video gets its name. I can't count how many times you'll be tempted to shout "Yeah Right!" at your TV.  I think each skater that's featured pulls one trick where the guys in the editing room add their little touch to make you say this. I mean, these are some unbelievable tricks being pulled by probably the most talented street skateboarders out there today, but the thing that makes this video stand out above others is the tremendous use of special effects and digital editing. It's the most visually impressive skate footage I've ever seen. I won't go into because it's probably better just to see it yourself, but I'm telling you: it absolutely kills. Spike Jonze's contributions to this video are huge, in that respect. Also, it's got some great music playing behind the skating. I immediately had to find out who it was that re-did the Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart" - it's Squarepusher, in case you were wondering. There's a few classic David Bowie cuts, Interpol's "Obstacle" and loads of other good tunes. There was one, I couldn't recall where I recognized it from. Then when the credits rolled, like a slap in the face I discovered it was Le Tigre's "Deceptacon", which was just introduced to me via the  urlLink Afterburners' July 2004 CD . Thanks,  urlLink Matt B. !  Another strength of  this video is the 24 minutes of outtakes found in the bonus section of the DVD. This is where you'll find all the faceplants and crotch-on-the-rail type stuff that'll have you squirming in your skin. Who can deny that this kind of stuff is a blast to watch, though. I mean, you know they end up fine afterwards.   Yeah Right!  proves itself to be an instant classic in the skate video genre and is most definitely worth your money, especially if you can find it for three bucks from an antique dealer. And if it doesn't motivate you to pick up a skateboard, then I don't know what will.

         I have become a braindead zombie that has done nothing but sit on the couch in my living room for four nights in a row (by Friday, you can make that five nights), soaking in anything and everything related to the 90's, thanks to VH1's special series  urlLink  I Love The 90's  . You see, this was the decade that bookended my entire adolescence. It was monumentally influential to my young, burgeoning mind and pubescent body. I must be reminded of everything. All of it.   urlLink Vanilla Ice ,  urlLink Kris Kross , the explosion of "grunge music"  and  "grunge fashion" (thanks especially to  urlLink Nirvana  and  urlLink Pearl Jam ), those Aerosmith videos with Alicia Silverstone - (schwing!) -  urlLink Wayne's World ,  urlLink Seinfeld , and  urlLink Jerry Maguire ! I am telling you, friends: this stuff shaped me...which is pretty pathetic, now that I think about it.  And, of course, this was the decade we were all introduced to  urlLink Oasis , who were - no question - my favorite band for probably, like, half of those years. No one else even came close. I worshipped at the feet of the brothers Gallagher. All my friends can attest to that, I'm sure.  So, I've been absolutely glued to the TV every night this week, watching all of this stuff get rehashed by VH1's now familiar cast of wise-cracking "media gadflies" and some of the 90s' biggest flashes in the pan, like Bubba Gump and the Snapple lady. Two years ago, when I came across  I Love the 80's  for the first time, I was stuck in my apartment for an entire Saturday unable to pull myself away. All my plans for the weekend? Fwoomp, out the window! It was heroin by way of cathode ray tube.  I Love The 90's ...is even worse, 'cause now I know  everything  they're talking about. With the 80's one, I was like, "Pet rock??? OK, that sounds sorta familiar but I know I never had one." Well, now, it's like, " urlLink Slap-on bracelets  - dude! I had like 6 of those...they totally matched my  urlLink Hammer pants !"   I probably would've called in to work at least two days just so I could stay home and watch these shows over and over again. Luckily, however, they've only been on at night (or at least I wasn't aware they've been re-running them during the day). Dana's probably looking forward to these five days being over. I'm sure I've been the world's most boring husband. Here I am in front of the television. I can't even talk to her, I'm so absorbed in it. It's so destructive, and yet...I can't...tear...myself...away. VH1 is the embodiment of Satan.  Well, I guess I should get back to finding  urlLink Waldo ...

       urlLink     Today is as good a day as any to barrel down to the record store with a sizable wad of hard-earned cash protruding from your back pocket (or fanny pack), prepared to blow it all in one place, just like dear old grandpa always warned you not to do. Walk straight up to the clerk, hand him/her the dough and demand these CDs, threatening bodily harm if necessary:  The Polyphonic Spree  Together We're Heavy  Adem  Homesongs  The Fiery Furnaces  Blueberry Boat  Rogue Wave  Out of the Shadow   Boom! $60 - gone! Sounds bad, but trust me. The rewards will far outweigh the negatives of having no spending money left over for the rest of the month. You may go hungry for a few days, but it'll all be alright. You'll make it. Not without these records. At the very least, not without the new Polyphonic Spree. You really can't go without it. No...seriously. Gentlemen, get out there and support your local independent music retailer! Support the economy! Ladies, support the music scene! Support our troops! Support your breastissesses! And for gosh sakes, if you still haven't picked up Morrissey's latest, do yourself a favor and drop another Alexander Hamilton or two on that!

         I visited  urlLink Pr1mary Space  this past Saturday, which was the last day of their Art Array 02 group show. It featured the work of 30 artists, including  urlLink Kurt Frederiksen , whose work I'm most familiar with out of all of the artists that were represented there. Besides KHF, the one artist that left the biggest impression on me was  urlLink Deth P. Sun  from Oakland, CA.  Sun had  urlLink this small painting  showing there and another one that I can't find on his site. Well, I dare you to try and find it! I can't believe how many pieces he's put together in the past 8 or 9 months alone. You can seriously waste your day away pouring over all of his stuff on his site. Anyway, his paintings are pretty cool, equal parts wistful and whimsical. He does a lot of acrylic on wood, with common themes of his paintings being space exploration, turtles, blackbirds, and cats - LOTS of cats - but these are the cool kind, the kind that don't make my allergies act up, so I like them. And some of them wear basketball jerseys so that's...bonus.  Well, it just so happens that the next show coming to Detroit's Pr1mary Space is a solo exhibition by Sun, entitled  urlLink "drifting dreaming sleeping" . A small celebration will be held this Saturday night (July 10th) to open the exhibit, which will then continue through the month until July 31st. You can put your money on my being there.  Deth also has a dual show with  urlLink Mike Park  scheduled in September. This one will take place at  urlLink Giant Robot  in Los Angeles.  ( update :  urlLink here 's the other painting he had in the art array 02 show)

         I had a great time this past weekend with my good friend from college, Jeremiah. He came up to visit last Thursday and left Sunday night. So...three and half days. After not seeing him for two years (since my wedding), it was really good to hang out. Dana and I had a few things planned for us to do so it wouldn't be too boring - gotta show him a good time in Detroit.  One thing we did was visit the Detroit Institute of Arts on Saturday. Jeremiah bought all of us these  urlLink miniature notebooks  from the gift shop, for us to keep in our pockets in case we ever need to write something down. I put it to good use immediately....36 views of Mt. Fuji (Hokusai) -  urlLink "#1: In The Hollow of a Wave off the Coast of Kanagawa ".   I also jotted down a list of some things to remember from Jeremiah's visit:  "You into cyborgs?" Reading life of pi and love in the time of cholera...out loud Iron & Wine @ the Magic Stick (Jeremiah=totally out of place) Drunk bum traffic control "I can't wait to go home" Jogging suits Going to the Detroit Zoo (and eating animal crackers) Walking on all fours "baaad idea" (the nesting habits of red-bellied birds) Reciting Hedberg jokes Toffee & caramels Napoleon Dynamite and a Large Sprite Talking to "Joe" outside Amoco The $6 nap in the Neverending Story "That's a great haircut" Hamtramck's abnormally large polish community The work of Kurt Halsey Frederiksen + others at Pr1mary Space D.I.A. & the notebooks "Really? That's lame" Poker tip: Always go all-in with a pair of 9's YGL Driving all over town in search of sushi on the 4th Hitting golf balls in a downpour Olga snackers Amores Perros ... (I may have to come back and add more as I remember them)  Anyway, thanks, Jeremiah, for coming up to visit. It was wicked fun. We can't let it go another "dos años". I'll be down in Chapel Hill sometime soon.

         We caught a special free screening last night at the Maple Art Theater. It was for Joshua Marston's debut film,  Maria Full of Grace . Upon exiting, when approached by an employee of the theater holding a clipboard and asked what I thought of it, I deftly came up with this remarkably unique response: "It was really good." Yeah, It'll probably end up on the movie posters. Keep an eye out.  Maria Alvarez is a seventeen-year-old girl with enormous resolve growing up outside Bogotá, Colombia. She works a sweatshop-type job pulling thorns off of roses. Her paychecks end up going straight to her mother to help care for her unemployed and unwed sister's baby. As if not seeing any of her hard earned money isn't enough, she also has an aimless boyfriend and she's missed her last two periods. Maria finally decides she's had enough of being treated like crap at work and quits her job. Though her mother and sister relentlessly pressure her to go back and apologize and ask for her job back, she refuses to do so. And though her boyfriend suggests they get married because of the baby-on-the-way and move into his house, which already has ten people living in it, she has no intention of doing that, either. Instead, Maria plans a trip into the city to visit her friend who works as a maid for a rich family, hoping something might open up for her there.  On her way into the city, however, Maria is presented with another opportunity, one that involves travelling. Sounds good right? Well, no. It's actually a position as a "drug mule." In exchange for a fairly sizable - at least, for Maria - sum of cash, she'll have to swallow about 60 horsepill-sized balloons full of heroin, hitch a flight, take some laxatives and hand the goods over to some thugs in New York. She is warned of the dangers involved. If she's caught by foreign customs, she'll be put in jail. If she loses any of the drugs, the boss will go have a "talk" with her family. And, best of all, if any of the balloons burst in her stomach, she'll probably die. Her new boss alleviates any of her fears, though, and easily convinces her to go along with it.  It's a tense ride, as we witness Maria's determination and will to survive what was promised to be an easy job with little risk, but which turns out to be far from it. In order to pull through, Maria must exude extraordinary grace (hence the title of the film) and poise under circumstances which would normally have people buckling under in no time. It becomes clear why Maria keeps pushing forward; she wants more than anything to free herself from the confines of the life she left behind in Colombia and to find a better life for her and the baby growing inside her.  Writer and Director Joshua Marston, a U.C. Berkeley and N.Y.U. graduate, has crafted a highly impressive feature-length debut. This'll look very good on his resumé. Maria's journey is captured in incredible, grim detail.  Marston's film is complimented by impressive performances all around (most notably from Catalina Sandino Moreno as the titular character) and through the use of  vivid imagery thanks to Director of Photography Jim Denault, who has already received a good amount of praise for several of his previous independent works ( City of Ghosts ,  The Believer ,  Boys Don't Cry ).  If you're in the mood for a powerful film, a snippet of Colombian culture that doubles as an artistic representation of capitalism at its darkest, this film is a pretty good choice for you. And remember what it says on the poster: "It was really good. - Mike Jonze"    urlLink Official Website  for  Maria Full of Grace

         This friggin' sucks! On Monday, the Beta Band posted news on  urlLink their website  that they have decided to punch out. What the heck for! Here's what they said:   "Sadly, eight years of hard work and critical acclaim but little return in terms of commercial success inevitably takes its toll and a group decision was made to finally lay the band to rest."   Right after they release a stellar new album,  Heroes to Zeros , that is received well by almost everyone? Doesn't make any sense! I don't know what enormous level of success they were going after. I'd say they were pretty successful. Maybe they just had a bad record contract and weren't seein' any of the money. Or maybe they got sick of splitting it four ways. Anyway, the decision to end it was mutual and friendly. No hard feelings. They will be bidding everyone adieu with a farewell tour throughout the UK this fall. Yeah, like there's a chance in hell that I'll make it out to one of those shows. I drove three and half hours to Washington DC once to see them open for Radiohead, and God unleashed the seven plagues on us to ensure that it didn't happen. It was one of the most excrutiating days of my life. No way am I spending $800 or more on a plane ticket to London, a concert ticket, plus travelling expenses just to see that happen again. I just have to accept that I missed out on what was probably an amazing live performance.  Anyway, I'm not going to get too sad. I got dumped, but that doesnt' mean I'm not still in love with them. And it doesn't mean I'm going to quit stalking them. Steve Mason is now putting the finishing touches on King Biscuit Time's first full-length effort. If you've ever heard King Biscuit's  New Style EP , you know that this release should soften the blow of the Beta Band's breakup quite a bit. In addition, Mason and Richard Greentree, another member of the group, are both working on their own respective solo albums. So there's still a lot in store for us from these guys.  The other two members of the Beta Band, John Maclean and Robin Jones, will both continue working in film and music. No specifics have been given.

       ...RYAN & EMILY JAMBEAU!      ...DAN & JANELL WILDER!      A Few More Snapshots : -Ryan and Emily  urlLink entering the reception  and  urlLink cutting the cake . -Dan and JaNell  urlLink kissing in the aisle . - urlLink Dana and I , after Ryan & Emily's wedding...and  urlLink one more .  Just thought it'd be nice to share those pictures. I'm pretty sure none of these people read my blog or even know about it, but oh well. I also wanted to extend my congratulations to these friends of ours and thank them for allowing Dana and I to be a part of both of their wedding days. Dan and JaNell were married a little over a week ago now, and Ryan and Emily were just married this past Sunday. Both weddings were super nice. I know I had a good time at them, and I'm sure that Dana did, too (she was a bridesmaid in both weddings and was totally beautiful). So thanks for inviting us and allowing us to share in the celebration.  Anyway, we're excited for both couples and look forward to seeing what's ahead for you guys. Congratulations!

      Welcome, flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood. This blog has been established for all of us to use, hopefully opening up some extra lines of communication between all of us. We know how hard it is to share everything that's going on when we live so far apart and talk only occasionally. Gone are those days. Let us partake in the free exchange of thoughts, feelings, and experience...and maybe some pictures, too. I want to know what's going on in the minds and lives of those I hold dear. Please join me on this excursion...or else we'll have a vote and disown you.

      Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm going to be getting my wisdom teeth pulled soon. Sorta dreading the experience but it really needs to be done before they cause more damage to my good teeth and before they get really painful. I had a meeting with the doctor yesterday and Dana found out today that our insurance will cover 60% of the procedure's cost. So that's good news. I still have to set a date for the surgery. Well, just wanted to tell you guys about that. Next time you see me it'll be with four less teeth than the last time you saw me.

      Hi, everyone. Dana and I attended another wedding this weekend. That makes two in eight days! Dana was a bridesmaid in both weddings. They were both pretty fun. I think we liked this last one better, though, since it was at the same place that our wedding was held. It was really nice, as I'm sure you all remember. And Dana looked absolutely beautiful in her dress, with her hair done up all cute, and wearing the diamond earrings I gave her for our anniversary. I couldn't take my eyes off of her for most of the wedding and reception. I'm a lucky man! Our friends, Emily and Ryan, who got married yesterday, hired salsa dancers to come to the reception. They performed a couple dances just for entertainment and it was really cool to watch, but then they also gave a lesson on the basic steps of salsa. Yes, I did go up to the dancefloor and, yes, I did participate. It was more fun than I was expecting it to be. The only problem was that I was sandwiched in the back of all the people, smooshed between two older ladies and pressed up against the DJ's table. So I didn't have enough room to do some of the steps. I didn't want to run over those poor old bagels!  Anyway, here's some pictures of us yesterday. These weren't taken at the wedding, though. They were taken at Dana's parents' home. After the reception was over, we stopped by to spend a little time with them and Michelle. We were still dressed up so we had them snap a few photos for us before we changed into some more comfortable clothes. Enjoy!

      I'm here in Nashville with Dave *(this is Asher writing).  We agree that, regardless of burner accessibility, coordination, and/or speech impairment, tardiness on CDs is unacceptable.   If you got flat feet, you can't be in the army.  (Or a wooden eye, says Dave......) ?  Also, Dave has chronic body odor.  This is a great quote i just heard...  "It's nothing personal.  It's just music." -D.M. Woodall, 2003, in conversation (referring to his own brother's dilinquency)

      I'm voting that Mike Woodall be put on Afterburners probation.  I know this sounds rediculous, and it has never been done before but if I end up taking another turn(I was the first person to go) before he ever puts out a mix then I vote he be put "on hold".  That means he will not be recieving anymore cd's untill he puts out.  So let's say that if your late a third month then you get probation, that's more than fair.  He's missed one month and is most likely NOT going to make it for Dec. 1st(Matt, that's you) so he's got untill New Years to produce or he's cut off. Now, of course, I'll need a majority vote on this issue...so....Yay or Nay? Sorry I've gotta come down hard like this but that last email was my breaking point.

      When a family member is put on probation, only a family member can choose if the delinquent family member is to remain on probabtion or be "subsituted" by another equal or more compatable family member.  (Since it is only fair that it will be the active family member who has to impart the ruling of dissmissal to the deliquent party.) 000000000000000000000section C/09er  My subsitution will be the admission of the first female in the club: Esther Bumbier (to go  9/1/04) 699 Ponce De Leon Apt. 319 Atlanta, GA 30308

      yeah, scott. i'd say you nailed it with #4. in my opinion, that was one of the disc's strengths - it offered some work from a few bands/artists that I've been meaning to check out but haven't been motivated enough to (i.e. - jurassic 5, ryan adams). so thanks to this disc, i've been more appropriately introduced to said acts. i think the J5 song is probably my favorite on the disc, which is unusual b/c i don't normally choose hip hop over rock, but in this case i do. it was better than anything else on the mix, at least of the stuff that was new to me. death cab and postal service still reign. i only had one real complaint about the mix. the whole time listening to it i was looking forward to hearing a coldplay song i'd never heard and then it turned out to be "help is around the corner", a tune which i have been quite familiar with for awhile now. still a great song, i had just got my hopes up for something different and then they were kind  of popped and flew around the room in loops and esses, leaving nothing but a wake of farting noises behind before dropping to the floor motionless and completely deflated. ok, that was a bit overdramatized. i'm just joe king. i am still having a hard time deciding if the mix is more nashville or chapel hill, though...i think the latter. speaking of the nash, i'm heading home for the holidays this week (tues-sun) to visit the old man and the rest of my kin.  i'll miss you all very...very much while i'm gone.  so, anyway, when i get back, i should be expecting no.7 already from matt bubar. am i right or am i right? yeah, i thought so. anyway, good job, asher. hey asher...one more thing. i was looking at your acrylic portraits, which are very good, i must say. but i came upon one that looked very familiar by the title, "Jessica". it looks just like a girl that went to my high school. it wouldn't happen to be a girl named Jessica Gallup, would it? just curious. she dated my best friend for a few months senior year. anyway, that would be weird if it was. it would be weird if it wasn't, too, cos it looks just like her. i know, guys. i'm abusing the afterburners team blog. veering off topic. sorry.

      1 - you immediately listen to the first track twice. 2 - you recognize a few songs that you love, and look forward to re-discovering 3 - you recognize bands that you like, but songs that you've never heard of 4 - you recognize bands that you've "been meaning to listen to" 5 - you don't recognize all of the bands on the list, all the while thinking that you were the authority on most independent music  most of you know that asher and i got off to a rocky start with him offering up ways to evangelize me (if you didn't know that now you do) - ha.  anyway, i was unsure how well we would recover from that situation, but now i realize that we have so much in common.    nice work asher.  are you going to DW's wedding?  if so i hope to chill with you and knock a few back and possibly have some good talks.  nice work on the ABCD!

      I just got Asher's cd in the mail today.  Nice Job Asher!  Although I do have 1 question:  track 17 you have listed as Richard Ashcroft, I've seen both The Verve and Richard(solo) live and that track sure does sound like The Verve.  It's really no big deal either way but I was just wondering if you knew for sure if it's just Richard.  I must say it's a good mix.

      Hey Scott, I(Ben) like The Gloaming!  Not MJ. And I would have to agree with MJ on the single issue.  There's no way I'd plunk down $8 for a song I already have, a remix of another song I already have and maybe one new song.  It's insulting to the fans.  I still have quite a few single from when The Verve (if they'd only get back together!) was making music and they are quality singles, with great b-sides.  You just dont see that much anymore.  Maybe that has something to do with Napster and Kazaa, because the last time I bought a single might have been before I discovered Napster.  Or maybe bands just stopped making quality singles because they knew fans would just download the stuff for free since it's only like 1 or 2 new songs?

      hmmmmm ... you guys are pretty hard on GTS.  i did not think it was all that bad of a choice, although i would agree that 2+2 should be a released single eventually.  mass appeal, etc ... i kind of like the song.  but something that MJ said:  he could not get away from the gloaming.  i feel the same way about backdrifters.  when thom comes into the song with the "ahh ahh ahh aaaaaaaaa"  it makes me want to scream and dance every time.

      You may actually be the last one to see things. I never saw it on MTV - MTV doesn't show music videos except during TRL, and I don't stay up late enough to see videos that aren't hip hop on MTV2 - but I do remember seeing this video somewhere at least a month or two ago. I think I found it posted on the internet somewhere...probably on Heavy.com. So, anyway, don't get excited about seeing this video get any attention. It's probably already missed its chance.  One other thing; I'd also like to add that I've never liked the single anyway (in general).  I think a band should only release a single if it's a non-album track that didn't fit on the album or something. The idea of me going and buying a disc for almost the same price as the album I bought, just for a song that I've already got on a full album and maybe two b-sides (one being a live recording and one being a demo recording of another song on the album) is ridiculous to me. I used to justify it when bands like Oasis and the Verve were actually putting quality b-sides on them that I could listen to. In fact, Oasis' "Whatever" single is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. That's what singles should be like. New song and three new b-sides (some call this an EP, but in the UK I guess it's still called a single). Everyone loved it. If bands would do that, I might actually buy singles. Even if one or two of the songs turn out to be mediocre, at least it's new and fresh to my ears. So to hell with singles!  I actually read somewhere that Thom Yorke said he's unsure if Radiohead will do the album thing anymore. He'd like to release only EPs from here on out, because putting together an album has put way too much pressure on them and become quite a daunting thing. Hmmm...

      Yes I would have to agree with the last couple of posts about Radiohead.  However, Am I the only person that thinks The Gloaming is an amazing song?  I'm not saying it should be a single or anything but damn!  I love the way the lyrics are done, repeating itself like that, and sonicly speaking it just lovely.  When that base-line comes in...it's like {in Neo's voice} Woooh.  It's hard for me to say it's my favorite song on the album but it's the only song that I just can't get away from.  Love the video although it kinda reminds me of a modern day version of that video from the 80's for "Money For Nothing".  Remember that?  "Money for nothin and yur chicks for free"

      I'd have to agree with Matt that "2+2=5" and "Where I End and You Begin" would've made better picks for a single, if only because they're more accessible songs that could appeal to more people. That's why I agree with that statement. And if I had to choose between the two, it would be  W.I.E.A.Y.B. . But I also feel that it's good when a band that has such great attention from the media releases something that doesn't fit into the mold that MTV and popular radio use to filter everything through. Radiohead have the ability to stretch the boundaries a little, and they're utilizing it - maybe paving the way for more bands with styles and sounds that don't have such broad appeal to see some success, too. Might not see it immediately, but...who knows. The video's pretty cool, technically speaking. The idea doesn't interest me all that much, but I thought it was executed really well. It's really amazing to see things like that done. It makes me feel pretty bad about myself, though, since I'm soooo not even close to being able to do stuff like that. Thanks again, Radiohead.

      i thought that the first single, "there there" was a good choice. as for "go to sleep", i would have picked almost any other song on httt other than that. but if i were to chose the next single, it would have either been "2+2=5" or "where i end and you begin".   on another topic, i have the go to sleep single and the import go to sleep single and i thought the b-sides on that were way better than the b-sides for there there.   oh and i thought the video was kick ass :)

(don't read the story until you watch the video).  and please:  wait for work for the high speed access if need be.  let's get some posts going here at the afterburners blog.  topics:   radiohead mainstream singles:  good or bad? this choice for a single:  good or bad? the video:  kicks ass, or i suck ass so bad that i don't like it :-)

      So you all know, I saw Mike Woodall this past weekend and he said he's not ready to go for Jan. 1st so I'll be jumping him in line and he'll move to Feb. 1st.  So keep in mind, this will activate Mike's probation starting on new years.  If you still want to send him a cd that's up to you.  Once he sends a mix out he'll be off probation and free to recieve abcd's from everyone.  On a side note:  I had the opportunity to see Mike in green tights as he pretended to be Peter Pan.  It was quite a sight and it is sure to leave me  urlLink scarred  for life.  If I can find a picture it will no doubt be posted on this blog. peace

Ben, on the other hand, shared the same feelings as I had about that issue. That's why he gets a bonus.  Too bad, dude. :(  Hey, I'm just kidding. But the amount of music I go through, I couldn't possibly afford to mail CDs out to everyone everytime I found something good. So let's all share. Perhaps you could try hitting up Ben and maybe he'd be kind enough to send you a copy.

I'm sick of these companies thinking we're all idiots and that we can't see right through these pitiful attempts at product promotion. As if I'm going to start buying cases of Pepsi so that I can win "100 Million Songs". There's a small chance I could win just one. Anyway, I just quit drinking soda. If I drink even a sip, I have to pay Matt Pamer $20.00. So I don't think there's a single free mp3 worth that, at least for me. Now, I must go. I must return to downloading my songs for free...later.

      It's not a rumor, actually. It's true. They developed their own language that they call "hopelandic" - some sort of fusion between English and Icelandic. I'm sure they didn't come up with an ENTIRE language. My guess is that they just took their songs, looked at the lyrical content of the songs in both Icelandic and English and kind of combined them and manipulated them however they wanted to get them to sound "just right" alongside their wonderful, wonderful music...and then, yes, probably sang the same lines multiple times on ( ). Anyway, whatever it is, it works really well and DOES end up sounding quite beautiful. Everything they've done astounds me. And to have made such gorgeous music at such a young age...it's pretty amazing. I hope you have all heard 2000's "Agaetis Byrjun", too.

      Yeah I noticed that too about ().  It sounds like they came up with a chorus line and then sang it over and over again, changing the music obviously.  But I also heard that they developed their own language/code that everything is sung in, it's english and it's not icelandic(isn't that were they're from?).  Has anyone else heard that rumor? That (album) is so good though, it doesn't matter what language it's in!

      i thought abcd 8 was pretty good. although i've heard a few of the songs already, the rest was new to me. andy zipf was in circadian rhythm, right? i also thought there was a good mixture of songs in it.  also, if anyone is interested. i stumbled upon this band today called  urlLink godspeed you! black emperor . these guys are like sigur-ros a little bit except some of they're songs are twice as long. but i think it's great. they have a lot of mp3 samples on their website. i'm not exactly sure, but i think it's all instrumental.   and while i'm talking about sigur-ros, is it just me or on the album - (), it sounds like he says the same thing over and over again on every song. either way it doesn't matter, i still like this album. just curious if anyone else thought that too.

      Just wondering if you all have gotten a chance to listen to ABCD#8.  What do you all think?  Likes? Dislikes?  In hind-sight, I have come to realize that there is quite a few radio-songs and/or MTV songs on the cd.  If that really is the case I had no idea.  I really do not listen to the radio and haven't seen a minute of MTV in the last year or so.  So I apolagize for any excess mainstream stuff, I didn't mean for that.  Hope you are enjoying it.

      I think his vocals sounds ALOT like The Violent Femmes' vocals.  Maybe that's why I dont mind it so much.  Maybe, secretly, I'm pretending it's The Violent Femmes' new album...that rocks! But I totally agree with you about OUT HUD.

      I can't figure it out. Everything around me is telling me to like the Rapture - that they're just, like, wicked awesome and can make you get up and shake yer arse around once or twice. And I do dig their music. It totally makes you wanna do that. Except I can't get past Luke Jenner's vocals, so I don't think I'll ever like them that much. Maybe I just have to keep listening and get used to it so it doesn't bother me. Does anybody else think his vocals are just, like, way way obnoxious? It's just caterwauling, in my opinion. If I could just get past it, then I might like the Rapture a lot. But for the time being, it just ain't happenin' for me. Sorry. And #1 on  urlLink Pitchfork's Best Albums of 2003 ??? I don't know about that one...     But I do know about Out Hud. Now that's music that will make you get out yo seat and shake it. And someone in the band thought it best to not ruin the songs by injecting wretched howling at the moon. Seriously, everybody needs Out Hud's "S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D."

      The last time we had a relative of Dave's in Afterburners we never got a mix from them EVER, so before we all agree to have Esther join our little cult let's make sure she has a computer and a cd burner, or at least 24/7 access to one.  That's all.  Other than that, I'm all for her joining!

      I'll agree to disagree with you about Sting.  Except for his new album, I dont like it all that much and the single is kinda gay but the album before that (Brand New Day)...that's a great album, i dont care what you say.  But whatever, your too cool for Sting.

      Man, I think I struck Ben in his soft spot. Anyway, about Sting...the Police were good. I would agree with you there. I have, in fact, owned a Police record (no longer have it, though). So, so much for that hasty judgement. Anyway, they did have some really great songs that I enjoy[ed]. But let me clarify what I was trying to say. Sting sucks  now , as a solo musician. There's no doubt about it. Did you not hear his latest single? It's horrible! What is he trying to do??? It sort of makes me wonder about all that "talent" he has. Hearing this crap he spews out now, I gotta believe maybe Sting owes a lot of credit to the other guys in the Police. I don't know. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he has  no  talent. It's just been steadily depleted over the years...a lot - a  whole  lot! It's that, or else he's totally surrendered it to those around him in the studio and production room. And where's the integrity in that?  I could not disagree with you more about Sting having "more talent in one finger than 1/2 the people in [my] iPod."

      What!  dude, I'm standing my ground on Sting!   He definitely does NOT suck!  Yeah maybe this last album isn't as good as his others but the guy is a world class musician and song writer.  How can you deny that?  Let me guess, you dont own a single album of his, do you?  I'll even count the Police, anyhting?  Ok, then you can't say shit about Sting.  Yeah so Sting might not be the "cool" or "hip" music act that he once was but he's still got more talent in one finger than half the people in your i-pod! C'mon, somebody get my back on this!

      Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sting, Bryan Adams, Seal, Shmeal - whatever...they all suck. Hey, I'm glad you had a good time, though. Really, I am. In fact, I'm jealous [chortle, choke]. Well, maybe, I'll get lucky and being able to at least see one of them live...on Oprah - Aw, snap!

      That might have been funny if I had just seen Sting in concert but since I saw Bryan Adams it's not!  Actually I've seen Sting in concert(a few years back) and it was great!  In fact, I'd go see him again!  Bryan Adams, on the other hand, was a New Year's Eve show that I was given free tickets to...so why wouldn't I have gone?  And leading up to the show I was making fun of it cuz he's kinda laim but I left the show saying "hey, he's pretty good live and I was familiar with just about evey song, that was fun".  I checked my musical pride/taste at the door and had a good time despite the performer. So SHUT UP JONES!!!!

      Dave send me an invite to your church clothes thing and call me about that stuff. I finally got #9, glorious. I like the outkast. Some of the rest of the stuff, I don't know. I guess everyone else in the club has like a girlfriend or something but I feel like a fag driving around downtown with buddies listening to whimpery sad stuff. I guess my musical tastes are a little more upbeat and when I do get down on like sad time music its usually like the white stripes or brmc. I don't get sad,  I get rocked out. It was nice to hear vaseline again though. It would also be cool to try and never have the same band as anyone else has had until we get into like the third year or something. I'm gonna end up being able to put together my afterburners cds and compile the entire streets, pearl jam, radiohead, and ryan adams albums.

      no no no no no! nobody's cuttin' ahead of me again. i'm tired of waiting. i'm up after josh and that's it. and to tell you all the truth, i really don't want to add anyone to the club anymore. i feel very strongly about that. i feel if we add anymore people, we're gonna lose our grip. i already can't stand waiting six months between mixes. i'm telling you. you guys are already missing out on so much from me. let's cut it off, alright?

      Dave, how many times do we need to send out addresses?  Let me guess, you lost them in the move.  Well, because we love you so much we'll go ahead and send them to you AGAIN....but dont go losing them this time.  Since Esther is joining the team officially(right?), we'll need to get all the needed info and decide where she'll be placed in line.  Does she just fall in at the end of the line?  Or, does she go right away, like after Dave?  What do you all think?

      i'm going through the emotions of the typical "former college athlete." you know how when they "were great" and they could excercise more than what a real life schedule allows them to do.  the reason AB was founded, was b/c i was loosing my musical edge w/ the ALLbusiness life. I've recruited the finest men i can find to help a brutha keep his edge. so don't be suprised if I don't contribute the same quality  magical mike,  sexy scott, brillian ben, magnificant matt, Juicy Josh, or Ashy ash bring to the round table.

      Scott, if you liked Sage Francis...here's some others you should check out: cLOUDDEAD, Aesop Rock, Why?, King Geedorah, DoseOne, Buck 65, Atmosphere - just to name a few. Trust me...it's not for everyone, but if you liked SF, then it might be worth your time to look into some of those names. I probably dig cLOUDDEAD and Why? the most out of those I listed. But most would think it's pretty weird. The others are more beat driven, where those two can drift into the abstract. Some more underground hip/hop that's good but hasn't had the "emo rap" tag slapped on it: any of MF Doom's incarnations (Madlib, especially though), Mr. Lif, El-P...hmm, that's all I can think of right now. Out of the mainstream stuff, I'm really liking Kanye West a lot, and anything that the Neptunes do is magic. It sounds like I'm a big rap listener, but I'm not. I just get in that mode every once and awhile, where some beats & rhymes is just what I need. This stuff's what I turn to to satisfy that craving.

      The same way you post pics on any blog site or website for that matter.  You need a host....A place to upload the images to.  Mike, maybe you could direct Dave to one of the many free image hosting sites on the web. Dave, Once the image is uploaded to the host you need to write the code that links it from the host to the website or blog entry in this case.  This( ) is a basic line of code for an image, only thing you would do is put the image's name between the quotes and remove the space between  Hey I'm a real novice at this so if someone else has a better solution for Dave that's great.

      I love that album.  But it took me alot longer to say that for "Human Condition", I dont know why, maybe I was expecting something different from him musicly, so I let it sit for a while.  I've since then rediscovered it's greatness.  That album is so spiritual and honest, it's not even funny!  It's a beautiful thing to hear a man cry out to God and even question him and himself.  I think it's been an exciting journey to watch so far.  That is, if you've been following him since The Verve days, he's a different man now for sure!  Although, every time he comes out with something new, part of me is wishing for a song like "The Rolling People" and those wild Nick McCabe guitar riffs. "Dear God, please let Richard and Nick get past their differences and reform The Verve, Amen".

I liked the Sting vs. Sean Paul performance last night too.  They played Roxanne the same way(w/o Sean Paul of course) when I saw him a few weeks ago, reggae style.  Very cool. 4.  Good mix Scott, sorry if it sounded like I was coming down on it.  Oh and I like that Streets song too.

      1 - ben:  did you ever think that maybe, just maybe, you were the first to get it, and thus should not ruin the suprise for everyone else? hmmmmm  1.5 - yeah, jack white blew the walls off the place.  i can't believe bb king (handing out the next award right after the performance) did not mention it.  1.75 - what about sting and sean pual?  i thought that was pretty dope - but maybe i'm the only dancehall regae fan in AB, that's understandable.  MIKE JONES STAY OUT OF THIS ONE ;-)  2 - gheeze matt, of course you can get it all for free.  i'm not sure how much of that i actually bought.  i just "discovered" it on itunes. like i discovered the exclusive ep's from siguor ros this week.  3 - there goes my TFlips history award.  i thought it was new.  are you sure it's the same songs / same EP? or is it old songs re-done.  have you seen cool hand luke? and why did i hear all of the buzz about plastic jesus recently (i think matt also told me about that track - which is one of the reasons i started listening to it. )  PS:  go and get the japanese version of "yoshimi battles the pink robots"  -it's mas bueno.  3.19 - bowtie.  whoops for some strange reason i thought "happy v-times day" was on ben's, and bowtie on mine but i got mixed up.  4 - was there anything you liked on ABCD nine ;-)

      Hey, did anyone else see Jack White blow it up last night at the Grammys?  I mean, he tore shit up on the guitar!!!  That was an amazing display of guitar geniusness.  They should have just given him an award for that performance alone.

      I'm pretty sure "She Dont Use Jelly" & "Plastic Jesus" is NOT exclusive to iTunes.  As a matter of fact, I remember hearing "SDUJ" like 10 years ago.  I think it was probably the first Flaming Lips song I'd ever heard.  Yeah, both of those songs are on the cd single that came out in '93.

      Woodski,  checked out the page and I'll have to get some more info on some of those  bands.  I just mailed out my first disc today.  We're called the "Disc  Junkies."  Very much kin to the Afterburners.  Grab some silky waves in  Diego and tell Danae that I say what it is.  I'm heading to Snowbird this  weekend.  Trying to get some fresh snow as Denver doesn't have too much.   I'll stop by the Artic Circle for you and then chase it down with some Hogi  Yogi.  Hayes

      Ursus says about Elbow's new album:  "#9 is probably the catchiest song on the record, “Buttons and Zips”. It begins with a really cool guitar progression and a few doo-doo-doo-doo-doo’s. I’m already sold, but by the time the chorus sneaks in so naturally, saloon piano and handclaps in tow, I’m absolutely won over. This is the melody that I find coming to mind hours and days later, stuck in my head in a good way".  Thanks Mike, you SOB.  I swear, if it was not all wrapped up and postage paid, i would immediately open up ABCD9 and re-burn all of the cd's without that track on them!  grrrrr...  ABCD9 is wrapped up and sitting on my desk.  I am waiting for josh's address.  someone email it to me (scottgravatt@yahoo.com).  In the morning, after i take an unexpected trip to the dentist for my daughter ( urlLink picture ) i will be at the post office, and they will be in the mail.  2 things.    1 -  look for it in the mail.  i mean really look, you might miss it :-) 2 - i have a tracklisting complete with links, commentary and liner notes online, but i don't want to reveal the link until you get the CD.  so i'll post it monday / tuesday am, or give it to you when you email me for it, whichever comes first.  enjoy!

      Alright, boys. After a weekend toiling away, I finally narrowed down the field to 18 tracks and an hour and nineteen minutes of bonafide brilliance. I created the blog for the  urlLink tracklisting , but I don't have access to the template for this page. As such, I can't add the link to the rest of them. So Ben, if you could do me the honors, I'd appreciate it. Following suit, the link is: http://ABCD11.blogspot.com.  CDs should ship tomorrow, so be expecting them in your mailboxes soon. Enjoy.

      Hey guys. I just got fired from my job yesterday and then, last night, my house burnt down to the ground along with everything inside it...including my computer. So I don't think I'll be able to step up to bat for Afterburners 11...'cause I don't have a computer...even though I'm on one now. Can someone else go next and give me another month to come up with another excuse? Thanks. Oh, by the way, I'm kidding. 11 will be undergoing construction this weekend.

      sweet.  this "team blog" is really working out.  i'd like to propose a future afterburners get together.  like a short weekend centered around a music festival.  the winter music confrence here in miami, or what's the name of that one in new york, or SBSX in texas, or even sundance.  that would be so sweet if we could all meet up and get some nice tickets.    it's cool how you can get to know someone by a mix CD.    i've got some sweet hook-up tickets to the Strokes tomorow night.  yeah!! yeah!! (the last time she told me they were hook-up tickets" it was like 8th row center radiohead), so i'm expecting something nice.

      fellow 'burners,  i am now officially registered as a blogger.  #10 was superb.  super.  supa.  i love nada surf.  never heard them before.  always thought their band name was clever, but not anything that reliable friends put into my hands.  i now question the validity of several friendships.  wait, no.  but i DO like nada surf.  very nice.  kent is always a favourite, and "quiet heart" is one of my favourite songs.  the rest of the tunes are cool, too, flowing together nicely with my faves.   i could have sworn that the turin brakes song was a ween track...  dude, but no.  aieet,  asher

      as anticpated, my attempts to impress the omnicient Jones failed. I should just bow out.  that braddigan was great when i was stuck in my room all day last fall hacking away at cxc and freelance work. i was rarely out of the apt. much longer than to see the sunset. so i needed some upbeat good music. that hit the spot for me. can't say i have any idea what's going on w/ the O.C.

      Got mine last week - Friday, I think. You may have cause for concern, Bubar. It's alright, Dave. The mix, I mean. I'm always up for some Spoon. I was surprised to find that on it. I didn't know you'd heard of them. But, yeah, they're great. I urge anyone that likes the Spoon songs to search out more of their stuff. "Girls Can Tell" and "Series of Sneaks" are my two favorite albums of theirs. Also glad to see some Nada Surf on the disc. They're pretty cool, even though they won't ever get out of the wake of "Popular" no matter how hard they try. There was a great moment on last week's episode of "The O.C." at the end where Anna was leaving to go back to Pittsburgh and Seth didn't want her to go and they were playing Nada Surf in the background. It was awesome. A cover of "If You Leave" by Orchestral Maneuvres in the Dark. I seriously almost cried. It was heartwrenching. Anyway, next time less Braddigan. And more John Ruebens.

      the gary allen song was a last minute entry. Danae was listening to the cd and I overheard this song. it was so funny i had to add it. It starts off sounding so "spiritually" encouraging, but listen to the words especially him talking toward the end.

      i was going to make this a complete suprise but i've realized that it's better i let it out now.  ABCD#17 will be composed entirely by myself. i have been using garage band 3 months now and i'm hooked!!!! i would love to see the evolution of AB into everyone contributing their OWN music. if you're skeptical that we'll all put out the "same stuff", you're wrong. this program is as deep as photoshop is. it will go as deep as your creativity will take you. to quote my good friend hayes:: "it's better to play in a bad band, than listen to a good one." i'm hoping this gives you all time to think and prepare for your next disc. i have 3 songs done, hoping for 10 by 10/1/04 who's with me!!!

      I like this discussion - here are my top three from each disc in the Afterburners catalog, thus far:   v.1 : 3) Ashcroft - The Miracle, 2) Radiohead - Where I End..., and 1) Herbie Hancock - Rock It   v.2 : 3) South - Here On In, 2) Seahorses - Love is the Law, and 1) John Reubens - Hindsight (purely for it's tremendous humor value - I can now drop this one whenever I want to blast Dave's mixmaking skills)   v.3 : 3) Bright Eyes - One Foot In Front of the Other, 2) Postal Service - Sleeping In, and 1) Aqualung - Strange & Beautiful (I Put A Spell On You)   v.4 : Impossible to pick just 3 - no filler ANYWHERE!   v.5 : 3) Death In Vegas - Scorpio Rising, 2) Modern English - I Melt With You, and 1) Primal Scream - Autobahn 66   v.6 : 3) Jurassic 5 - Concrete Schoolyard, 2) Death Cab - I Was A Kaleidoscope, and 1) Frou Frou - Hear Me Out (SO GOOD in the "Garden State" trailer!)   v.7 : 3) The Faint - Total Job, 2) The Darkness - I Believe In A Thing Called Love, and 1) Cat Power - He War   v.8 : 3) Outkast - Bowtie, 2) Travis - Midlife Krysis (perhaps a reference to Canadian CCM'ers "The Kry"? - eerrrrr, I think not!), and 1) Chemical Brothers - Get Yourself High   v.9 : 3) Elbow - Buttons and Zips, 2) The Shins - Young Pilgrim, and 1) Polyphonic Spree - Light and Day (Reach For The Sun)   v.10 : 3) ----, 2) The Verve - Two Step, and 1) Spoon - Don't Let It Get You Down   v.11 : Once again, too many to narrow down the field. Exquisite compilation! Who is responsible for this one!  I'm out!

      Guys, it's great to see the positive response to my mix. I had such a hard time whiddling it down to that. I had more I wanted to share. Thought about doin' a double-disc, but nixed it. Anyway, I'm psyched that you're all enjoying it so much. I admit I have been enjoying it very much myself. Now to field some of your questions/comments: Ben: the Wayne Everett disc. Ordered it straight from his label,  urlLink Northern Records , last year. It's a quality album. Course, I've been a sucker for all things Prayer Chain and Lassie Foundation-related for years. All those guys have the Midas touch. Matt: I didn't notice the similarity to  Under The Milky Way , but now that you mention it, I can sorta hear it in my head. I'll have to go back and listen to it to fully realize what you're talking about. That's cool...cos that's a great song. You know what would be really sweet would be if he transitioned into it when performing the song live. Anyway, cool. Josh: The Cure do rule. Join the Dots box set, baby. B-sides, b-sides, and more b-sides. It's a treasure trove. Well, the set has got it's fair share of less than mediocre songs, but it's worth the price for the good ones. Disc 3 is the best. This Twilight Garden, Play, Halo, The Big Hand...great tunes. I'm convinced the Cure were the best thing - musically - to come out of the 80s. The best thing, musical or non-musical, to come out of the 80s was a two-way tie between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Yeah, you all know what I'm talking about. Dave: Yes, I can be commissioned for a comp. Call me. We'll talk numbers sometime. I'm seeing six figures...

      yeah, i agree. the mix is really good and i haven't heard of a lot of the bands on there.   one thing i thought was interesting was the song "reality check" by schneider tm has the same beat to it as the song "under the milky way" by the church. i was singing under the milky way to it. i thought it was kind of funny.

      I couldn't possibly have heard him(Josh) right when he said that abcd#12 was late(3 weeks) because he was working on the art/liner notes.  So I take it back, I have no idea why he was late.  It doesn't matter now anyway.  The mix on the one disc labled abcd#12is great, i really like it.  Love the new UNKLE stuff on there.  The other disc, which I'm assuming is the older one, is classic Josh. Nice job compiling the songs....btw, a cd insert is 4.75 inches square.

      Josh(ua), you must really want us to hear that song.  It's made it onto both of the abcd mixes(#5 & #12).  Is there maybe some sort of hidden meassage in the lyrics that we're supposed to hear?  Oh, i know, it your favorite song, right? Agh, i'm just bust'n yur ballz! Good on ya to give us 2 discs this time around, your a good man.

      check the sidebar:  it's really simple, but it just takes a little work to get it there.  asher and josh(ua) still need to fill in the profile (that's only important b/c it's got a space for a current email address, in case someone needs it, for a mailing address or something)  other than that, don't use images in your posts, unless they are smaller than 400px wide, post your tracklistings as you mail them out, ben and i can do the rest.  please leave suggestions / opinions is the comments box of this post.  peace!

      I just got an email from Josh, he says he has 2 discs to send out and that it took him this long because he was working on the liner notes and art work.  But he says they are done.  Better late than never.  He needs everone's addresses though.  So email him with you address. I'm out.

      Are you going to finish the changes to this blog?  Like the cd track listings in the side bar(i only see abcd 1), and the names of the members are all out of order.  Before they had dates next to each person's name as to when they were going next. Does anyone remember who's going after Josh?  It was whoever was going in June.  I know I was August.  Maybe it was Asher.

      some neat things happening at blogger, and this website gets an instant *free* update.   a couple of highlights:  1 - comments!  hell yeah!  no more adding new posts just to respond to the old ones.    2 - profile!  the next time you log in please create your profile.  make sure under the section for your home page *do not out the afterburners site*  put your website.  if you don't have one leave the website questions blank, but please fill out your profile, and keep your email address current.    3 - one of the coolest features is that now blogger keeps every single post that you make on it's own archive page - this means that from now on, when you send out a mix, it is your job to log in to the website, and post the tracklist.  - cause then ben and i will be using that post to keep a permanent archive on the sidebar.  that also means that later this week, you will notice a string of posts with just old tracklistings.  that is so i can start to create the permanent links for them off to the left.  please leave suggestions in the comment box!  i am totally open.  thanks!

          FEBRUARY 2004 Mixed by Scott Gravatt  1 - jus' a rascal - dizzee rascal from the album "boy in a corner".  i heard about dizzee last year from a friend's blog that lives in the uk, and is pretty hip in the club scene.  i would have loved to be the first one to introduce you to him, but alas, everyone seems to have beat me to the punch.  he's shown up in every major music magazine and website as of this month.  damn.  i was almost cool  2 - kill the band - ours from the album "precious".  this is not the best song on the album, it's just one of my favorites.  i chose the first track off the album, 'cause ben (abcd8) chose the last track.  if you like these, you should hear the stuff in between.  3 - young pilgrim - the shins from the album "chutes to narrow".  this should have made it to my favorites of 2003 list, but i didn't get to it in time.  4 - this is not - blonde redhead from the album "melody of certain damaged lemons".  ok here it is.  this is the track to impress your friends with.  just mosey up to the bar, say hi to your friends, and say "how about that blonde redhead album, huh?  then you can say "what? you haven’t heard of blonde redhead?  let me burn you the album"  instant indie-music idol status for all.  5 - she don't use jelly - the flaming lips from the itunes exclusive ep of the same name.  i've been into some of the exclusive stuff on itunes, so this is the first of a few.  6 - light and day/reach for the sun - the polyphonic spree from the album "the beginning stages of".  i included this track, on the off chance that some of you have committed the unforgivable sin of not listening to this.  tps is probably the most original sound in a decade, and besides:  it just makes you all warm and happy inside.  people say that the live shows are like a really good religious experience.  7 - give me my lighter back - the streets from the exclusive itunes ep of the same name.  8 - bowtie - outkast from speakerboxxx / the love below (the album that you will be tired of hearing about after the grammy's).  you got to hand it to them, this is what good american hip-hop is supposed to be - pushing limits and boundaries, evolving, and creativity.  9 - ******** (plastic "jesus") [porch version] - the flaming lips from the itunes exclusive ep "she don't use jelly".  i heard this story about how wayne (tfl) gave jack white (twstripes) some sort of dashboard jesus that lights up, and then wrote a song about it.  i disregarded the story.  i have since seen the movie "cool hand luke", and realize that this song is a cover of a song in that movie.  more than that;  the movie is not the original song.  apparently it is an old negro spiritual song that came to represent rebellion against oppression.  i've now watched the movie about 25 times, and i have all kinds of elaborate theories about cool hand luke, and the gospels that i would love to share with you all sometimes.  the gist of the theory is that the movie is one big allegory for the gospel of luke.  anyway, see it. and here's the song.  10 - love is hell  - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume 1".  love is hell.  11 - leaves (edit)  - ours from the album "precious".  here's a song from the middle just incase you didn't believe me.  12 - mary's in india - dido from the album "white flag".  there are more obvious choices from the album, but this song sticks with me b/c of the lyrics.  give it some thought, listen to the hook at the end, and go ahead and feel sad, it's ok.  13 - wonderwall - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume1".  a word to the wise:  skip ryan adams latest album "llor dna kcor" that's rock and roll backwards btw.  these ep's (love is hell volume1 and love is hell volume2) were released at the same time as that album, and while they are getting absolutely no press play, they are 10X the album that "llor dna kcor" is.  take for example this version of the popular oasis song.  14 - 11:11 - rufus wainright from the album "want one".  i vowed never to listen to him after that shrek debacle.  but i caved in, and i am glad i got over my homophobia.  i really like it, i don't care what anyone else says.  this song has the hooks, the gay references, the pretty music, and the message.  15 - buttons and zips - elbow from the album "cast of thousands".    16 - avalanche - ryan adams from the ep "love is hell volume 1"   17 - political science - randy newman from the album "the randy newman songbook volume1"  i was introduced to randy newman from all of the soundtracks from my kids dvd's.  he's done complete soundtracks for toy story, monsters inc. and a bunch of other stuff, including a lot of songs that are used as introductions to tv shows.  he has an unmistakable voice and ragtime (i thinks it's called ragtime) style.  nice to listen to.  so i bought the album not realizing that he has this uncanny ability to tell a story in a song.  i love the whole album.  he covers themes such as racism, marxism, and prejudice.  i chose this track b/c it's so appropriate to where america is right now.  regardless of what you think about gwb, iraq, israel, etc.  the truth of the matter is that americans come across as arrogant know-it-all rednecks, and i wish it was otherwise.  18 - somewhere over the rainbow / what a wonderful world. - israel kamakawiwo'ole from the album "facing future".  i guess i'm a new-age nerd for owning anything classified as "world music", but after you listen to the undisputed master of the steel guitar genre you will understand.  while you are listening to this, try to imagine a 500 pound hawaiian in traditional garb with this beautiful voice.  I listened to this on repeat about 5x in a row one day.  19 -  i shall be released - jeff buckley  from the double disc "live at the sin'e" deluxe edition.  fyi:  this is an old hymn, it is not his song.  does anyone else find it uncanny that jeff buckley sang about his death so often?  this song made me cry the first time i listened to it on my ipod sitting on my back porch well past midnight.  20 - redemption song - johnny cash with joe strummer  from the 5 disc special posthumous "selections" album.  johnny cash, joe strummer, bob marley.  i don't need to justify this one do i?  and it's such a fitting way to close a mix cd.

      fellows of the post-fuego,  all apologies for being out of the loop.  i just got back in town from a few weeks of being out of town on a sculpture installation.  could not get online while gone.  and definitely could not get to my computer to make the CDs.  the final draft is compiled too...  tragic.  anyway, there are no excuses, i should've had this done in may... but... dude but no.  again, this is apology.  also, this is announcement.  this thursday, i compile the copies and mail them out fri or sat.  for real though.  thanks for patience.  and no worries for lack of it.  you all deserve more than my slackitude.  and hopefully, my mix will deliver the goodz.    talk more soon,  asher    "most art is revenge on the world anyway." -thom yorke

      so remember when i said that i wanted to replace brother w/ my cousin? well now i have her address. Esther 699 poncedelon ave #319 Atlanta, GA 30308  she's got the skills and will have that female touch.  also, I met a good buddy of Tim russo's this weekend. Tim was working at a record label, loves music, the whole nine yards and he introduced me to Tyler. Tim introduced him as "the guy i get all my music from" so we started talking ABCD and he laughed and said he already does it, but not in a club. just one offs to good friends. so i asked him if he'd like to join. he said he has about 2,100 songs in his ipod. he replied to my email today:  >>i checked out the afterburners cd club page. there where a lot of bands i knew of and a lot i had not. i'd be stoked to jump into the mix and share my passion for music as well.  so what do you think? He'd bring in some more west coast flavor.

      okay maybe i spoke a little to soon. i got all hyped up on my garageband and i'm still excited about it but i got kind of busy to keep on that project. so i'll probably be putting out a combo of sorts. i mean i don't want to be late seeing the intensity of this crowd.

      Asher + Matt, Has the June 2004 edition of Afterburners gone out in the mail yet? I just gotta get on your case, because as a founding member, I cannot encourage a spirit of complacency by sitting idly by. Last month's was late (by a whole month). And Matt Bubar, how's "14" coming? I'll be expecting yours the first week of July, too. Just cause the last couple have been late doesn't mean all the others get pushed back. I'm not saying yours was going to be, by any means. Just wanted to clear that up in case there was any question. I hope I don't sound like a total dick. Just wanted to remind everyone. I expect the best out of each and everyone one of you. Don't disappoint me. This hurts me far more than it hurts you. I take this club VERY seriously. I hope that you will, too. If not, I'll get the dobermans on your asses.  Jonze

      GROUND RULES:   Rule #1:   Do not talk about Afterburners Club.   Rule #2:   When it's your turn, it's your turn.   Rule #3:   If you absolutely have too much going on to put together your mix, then it is your responsibility to arrange with the next person in line to take your place.   If you exercise this option, you don't get to go next after them,  you forfeit your turn and are bumped down to the bottom of the line.   Rule #4:   If you fail to carry out rules 2 & 3 and all other members of the club end up without a mix at the beginning of the month, you are now in some trouble. You are bumped down to the bottom of the line, just like above; however, you will be put on probation.   Rule #5:   Probation (pro-bay-shun); def. - member's name on the blog is struck through with a line, denoting that said member will NOT be sent any further Afterburners cd's until he/she takes the necessary steps to redeem themselves (see rule #6).   Rule #6:   Freeing yourself from Afterburners probation is a two step process:  Step 1:  Ship everyone in the club 1 makeup CD mix sometime before your next turn.  Step 2:  Come through on time with your regular CD on your next turn.  Once these requirements have been met, regular receipt of the Afterburners volumes to your mailbox will resume.   Rule #7:   If you fail to carry out rules 2 & 3 a SECOND time, you've totally effed up. you're gone. out of the club. no excuses. no arguments. goodbye.   Rule #8:   Every member get's to invite 1 new member.  the maximum number of members is 12.    Rule #9:   You must fill out and maintain a blogger profile with a working email.      Rule #10:  We're dead serious about this.

      Hey everyone, I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of utilizing my administrative priveleges on this blog. I added artwork for all of the Afterburners discs that came with artwork. I had them all scanned in for my iTunes artwork window anyway, so I thought "what the hell." I stuck them in the posts that Scott did last month and then i changed the  links in the template to go to those posts rather than the individual blogspots they were at before. I didn't like how you clicked on one of the "previous volume" links and then you were taken to a page that looked totally different from the new Afterburners Blog page. So now it's all uniform. Like I said, I hope nobody minded me doing that. Check it out and let me know if you had problems with it. It was just bugging me, so I had to fix it. By the way, no artwork for volumes 5 (josh) and 10 (dave).

      I was just thinking...I can't believe I won't be making another Afterburners mix until November. You guys have no idea what you're missing out on. I've been made to feel like I'm not allowed to send you stuff unless it's my turn. And for fear of being ostracized (sp?), I just tuck my tail between my legs and wait.

      I am just wondering if Esther is really in or not.  She still hasn't posted or signed up to post on the site here.  Just wanted to know if she's committed or not.  I'll hold her's until I hear otherwise.  "Esther are you there?  Just wave you hand."  And I'll also be holding Asher's mix untill I recieve #13.  Sorry dude, but 2 months is too long.  For real tho'.  Other than that, ABCD-XV went out today so be on the lookout.

      doubters, believers, naysayers, himhawers, g-force, brethren, and betrayed,  &nbsp; i am full of muchos apologies for tardiness, and a desire to explain and display all the art that has been created in the last month at the expense of the timeliness of this schaweet CD.&nbsp; but, i will save you all from my verbose stumblings and shameless self promotions, and will just gird up my loins and dish out a "thirtEEn."&nbsp; technically it's not CD #13, but i guess the 14th floor in buildings is also technically something else...&nbsp; that begs another question:&nbsp; with 12 apostles, does that make jesus #13, or #1?&nbsp;  &nbsp; anyway, i will publish the track listing in a couple days, giving this time to mail out...&nbsp; thanks again, to peepz with patience.&nbsp; i resolve to live, with all my might, while i do live. &nbsp; more soon.&nbsp;  for real tho', &nbsp; ash &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Hey, guys. Guess what... It looks like a copy of Afterburners 15 has leaked and found its way into the filesharing networks of the world. I found it yesterday on Soulseek. Ben, I wouldn't trust your friends so much and I'd keep an eye on that computer of yours! Anyway, if anyone wants an advance copy, let me know and I'll pull some strings.

      Didn't we decide a while back that each member is only allowed to invite one new member into the club? I invited Matt a while back and Dave didn't you invite someone already?  So, what I'm say'n is, do we all agree that it's ok for a member to add multiple people at once?  I'm still not sure if this is fair.  I mean, I can think of plenty of people, that I know, that would be great for this club, but do i add them? No, because I've already used my invite.  I can't remember 100% but didn't Dave use his invite on Asher? Dont mind me, I'm just being a legalistic pain in the ass!

      OK, in keeping with the good spirit of this club I thought It'd be nice to ask the other members a few questions that'll help us all get to know each other a little better(musicly speaking).  1.  What's the best show you've ever been to all time?  2.  Favorite album of all time or album you can't live without?  3  Do you have a favorite band/artist(I'll understand if you can't name just one)?  4.  Artist/band you would most like to see return from the dead?  5.  The reunion tour that you pray for day-in-and day-out to happen?  Ok that should do, have fun!

      ...let us commence with music-related talk rather than club-related bitching and moaning.  Who's looking forward to seeing Garden State August 13th, even if only because you know it's gonna have some freaking sweet-arse music throughout???

      Alright, last mean post for awhile. Ben and I have been talking and we've come up with some rules that we think are pretty fair in order to remain a member in good standing of the Afterburners club. I've added a couple that we didn't discuss. But I'm looking for everyone's comments on this.  Personally, I think it's ridiculous that it's even come to needing to do this. But anyway, here are the rules:   rule #1:  Do not talk about Afterburners Club.   rule #2:  When it's your turn, it's your turn.   rule #3:  If you absolutely have too much going on over the course of 8 or 9 months - or however long the stretch of time is between your turns - to put together your mix, then it is your responsibility to arrange with the next person in line to take your place. Don't just put a post up here saying "I'm not gonna make it in time. Can someone else go next?" You need to get in touch with that person and make those arrangements. Also, if you exercise this option, you don't go next after them. You forfeit your turn and are bumped down to the bottom of the line as punishment. We think this is more than fair, since you still will be receiving CDs. Not much of a punishment, actually. More like a free ride.    rule #4:  If you fail to carry out rules 2 & 3 and all other members of the club end up without a mix at the beginning of the month, you are now in some trouble. You are bumped down to the bottom of the line, just like above; however, you will be put on probation.    rule #5:  Probation (pro-bay-shun);  def.  - member's name on the blog is struck through with a line (ex. -  MikeJonze ), denoting that said member will NOT be sent any further Afterburners comps until he/she takes the necessary steps to redeem themselves (see rule #6).   rule #6:  To free yourself from Afterburners probation:  You can only do this by completing steps "A" and "B":  step A ) Ship everyone in the club 1 makeup CD mix sometime before your next turn.  step B )Come through on time with your regular CD on your next turn.  Once these requirements have been met, regular receipt of the Afterburners volumes to your mailbox will resume.   rule #7:  If you fail to carry  out rules 2 & 3 a  SECOND  time, you've totally effed up. you're gone. out of the club. no excuses. no arguments. goodbye.   rule #8:  Dave is done inviting new members. He's already invited his fair share of them. Dave, if you want mix CDs from any of your other friends, just ask them for one. Don't invite them to join Afterburners and then come to us afterwards. This is where rule #1 must be executed.  *To those have been invited into the club by Dave so far: please don't feel like an outcast. We welcome you with open arms. It's just that we have to give Dave the red light now.    rule #9:  We're dead serious about this.  Now, to put this in perspective - the recent situation with Asher's mix? How would that  be handled from now on?  Asher recently became the target of some scorn b/c we went a whole month w/o getting a mix. He said he was going to get something to us, as was his obligation. He couldn't pull through for whatever reason and, to make matters worse, he didn't get anybody to replace him. Because these rules hadn't been clearly defined before, he's off the hook this time. But in the future, he would be put on probation in this situation. Refer to rules 5 & 6 above if you still don't know what that means.  Ben and I think these rules are more than fair. They have been set up to weed out the non-committal.  So, do you guys think these are some acceptable rules? Because, we need some rules here or this club is going into the can.
