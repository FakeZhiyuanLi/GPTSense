      Oh, I'm so relieved. And happy. My birthday was last week but I only gained my cell phone yesterday. Oh, and a friend of mine gave me a beautiful box with a couple on it. And finally, the tests are over. The one I thought would be the worst was the best! But that's fine for me.  Today is Saturday and I have nothing to do by now. I wish we could go out later just to breath some new air. Like that bird is flying on the sky just looking and waiting for something of his interest, this is the way I feel. Uh... I wish I had a skate - and know how to use. I have a pair of rollers' but I don't use it much.  Anyway, it's my time to go now. Have a nice weekend, everybody!

      Gosh... I thought I was gonna die because of these tests. But I won't. In June there will be more of them! It is just like Paollo told me: Do not be sad it will get worse!". Pretty funny, uh? I can't imagine what will happen in 2005. Almost every week - tests. In a period of three months - a new book. In the end of the year - I don't even wanna talk about it. Uh... forget it!  I thought it was coming back. The memories came into my mind and then... The good thing is that J. called me yesterday, so I could notice that it wasn't true. There was a misunderstood in my confusing head.  yeah, I think this the end.

      Oh... I'm going crazy with this!! Every single day I'll have to study a lot! I mean not a lot 'cause I'm a lazy person. Anyway... if I'm not studying, what I'm doing? Well, let's say a lil fun is enough to tell.  I think I'm strange. Somehow I am.  Hehehe, I remembered now of a movie we're gonna make. The title can be translated as "An Explosive and Caliente Passion". The story is about a girl called Jennifer, who is ugly and not very careful. She loves Steven. Steven is Sharon's boyfriend. Jennifer's best friend loves Sharon. In the end of it all Jennifer discovers that she really loves her best friend - I forgot his name by now. Anyway, I am just one of those people who are just passing by in the film. The main idea is to make ppl laugh and laugh and laugh. I think the story is lil important too... hoho.  Returning to Earth, I think i'll study now. Bye bye.

      Capítulo VII   "(...) A luz do dia mostrava-lhe as linhas cruéis em torno da boca, tão nitidamente como se ele se estivesse vendo em um espelho, depois de praticar uma ação terrível. Dorian pestanejou. Apanhou da mesa o espelho oval, emoldurado de cupidos de marfim - um dos numerosos presentes de lorde Henry -, e mirou-se, aflito. Nem mais o tênue vinco lhe alterava os lábios rubros. Que significava aquilo? O moço esfregou os olhos, voltou ao quadro, tornou a perscrutá-lo. Observando bem, não notou diferença alguma. Contudo, era inegável que se alternara completamente. Aquilo não era imaginação dele. Era um fato evidente, horrível. (...)"   Oscar Wilde

      Why is the Heart so confusing? That same boy, that same one with whom I had broken up... oh... confusing. I think I still love him. Even if I try I can't get him out of my head. And... oh shit. His birthday is coming I must do something!! How will I survive with this caos inside my heart, inside my head?

      I don't have much to tell you. This is my blog and this is me. But... let's start as it is supposed to be.  Nowadays I've got a lil confused because of my thoughts and... yeap. But then I discovered that a have some really good friends n they are always there by my side. Talking about friends... Yesterday, I and some collegues were talking about a movie. A comedy mixed to romance. Gosh! I think that I've never laughed som  much this year!! We invented some really great stuff. I bet this movie will be recorded because I wanna make part of it!! Hohoho...  Uh... have a nice weekend. I know that probably there is no one seeing it, but it's good to wish good things. Bye bye!

      In these days I didn't post here I've been through so many things... I felt lonely in the dark. I felt tears in my face. I felt joy in this miserable heart. I felt embarassed and unhappy because of stupid illusions. Then the idea came just like a tender feather, floating slowly through the ocean. But after all of this, I would be an idiot if I say life is a shit. Because it isn't. Life is a chance -  "If you had one shot / One opportunity / To seize everything you ever wanted / One moment / Would you capture it / Or just let it slip?"  Even though, I'm still a little sad. I can't tell the reason. Maybe, you'll find it later.

      Oh, I'm so happy. I don't know what is going on with me but everything is so fine. My tests are coming next week - all at once! What can I say? I'm just too happy to worry about it. Yesterday I talked to V., who is an old friend of mine. We didn't have time to talk about everything but I told her the essencial stuff about my life. Oh, I am at school right now. My friends are making a photoblog. It's great - noses, heads, pants, ears...! Maybe I'll post them here. That's all, folks!

      Yesterday was good for some people, wasn't it? For me, it wasn't so. I think I'll become a member of the ARSW [Association of Real Single Women] - it was created by Anne. I know it has been only 6 months but I miss it so much! Oh, I know this is a very strange blog because there's Portuguese and English at the same time. The things I write aren't that interesting but this is what I like... this is what I am. I'm just a girl of 14 years old who seems to have been survived through 16 years or more. Anyway, I am confused again. I'm in  one of those strange ways in which I have 4 options... I hope I'll choose the good one.

      Tempos atrás, você era um anjo que vivia no paraíso.  Era mais ou menos como um atleta sentado no banco de reservas  querendo participar da partida. De repente, você olhou para  o planeta Terra e viu que o jogo estava difícil, o resultado era negativo,  e então pediu ao Grande Técnico uma oportunidade para vir à Terra ajudar o time.   Agora você está em campo, disputando a partida da sua vida.  Você se lembra do seu objetivo existencial?  O técnico continua dando as orientações,  mas será que você as está seguindo?   Dentro de alguns anos, quando voltar para o vestiário  e encontrar o Grande Técnico, ele vai lhe perguntar:  "Como é que foi? Conseguiu realizar sua missão?"  Qual será sua resposta?  "Não, simplesmente fui mais um que viveu frustado."  Ou você vai poder encará-lo e dizer:   "Vivi e fui feliz! Com minha felicidade contribuí  com mais luz para o planeta."   Certamente,  Ele vai recebê-lo com um sorriso de parabéns,  um abraço carinhoso e se sentirá muito orgulhoso de você.   Não seja mais um frustrado.  O mundo está repleto de seres infelizes.  O universo precisa de muita luz.  Algo que somente a alegria pode criar.      Ps.: I'll try to translate it in English and post it later.

      Tests are over! I don't have so many obligations as before... I'm so excited! I finally watched the third movie of Harry Potter! I don't think you know what is the big point of it, but... it is the first time that a movie comes to my lil city at the same time that in the rest of the country!! Oh God, thank U so much. I the cinema I found A... he is my frined-enemy. I think he is my collegue somehow but we are always fighting! Once, he almost broke my arm... but he was so good in front his friends that I thought it was his twin brother or something like that... Oh... June 12th is coming! It is the day of the lovers in here, I don't know if it is only here or... forget it. The thing is that I have no reasons to celebrate it. Well, I don't know what should I post. I have no organized thoughts by now. Such a pitty. Uh... yeah, bye!   Ps.: I think this post is messy, isn't it? And I still don't know why I put so many (...)...

       I'm back! Finally... well, the trip was fine. If you hadn't travel by car yet - do it! It's awesome, you know? I mean... the things I have seen there were really great. Of course, nothing is perfect, but... I saw waterfalls, forests, fields of purple and blue flowers. Oh... great.   I got a true evidence of how loneliness can put me down. It wasn't even a month but I missed my friends. All of them, without exceptions. Even some people with whom I don't talk much.   Well, bye. =)
