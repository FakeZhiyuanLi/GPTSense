      I've been in the hospital since monday.  There's still some confusion about what was wrong with me but the best guess is that I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured and caused an infection.  I'm still taking medication to help with the pain.  Trying to wean myself off of it though.  I woke up this morning with pain off the chart.  I was completely disoriented because it hurt so much.  I wandered the hall crying for a bit before I found a nurse who took me back to my room and helped me.  At any rate when I woke up I took a shower and felt a lot better.  Eventually Dr Brown came in and told me I could come home today.  Catherine dropped me off and got the rest of my medicine.    Its so nice to be home with the boys.  My own bed. And a nightgown that closes in the back.  Getting the pick line out was the best thing.  I have a huge hole in my arm though.  I didn't expect that.    ANYway... Lani and I are going to go to the interview on the coast on Sunday.  I'm very torn.  I think I would love the dispatch center there, I know I like the area, but I would miss my friends.  Being sick really drove that point home.  But my family would be there, and I'd make new friends.  I can see myself living there for the rest of my life.  Also a strong selling point...  I guess the only thing to do is to go to the interview and see how things go.  If they offer me the position then it was meant to be, otherwise I'll keep plugging away here.    I am most definitely doing something about my weight though.  Its completely out of hand, and for the first time I couldn't do something because my ass was too big.  So tomorrow I'm going to call and withdraw from my classes.  I'm too far behind and really don't think I'll be able to catch up.  Especially if this job comes though I've just got too many things to worry about.  In place of that I'll be going to the swim center.  Not really having an appetite for the past week also helped get me started.    Expect progress reports.

      I've been sick the past week or so.  No gory details but I've been on lots of pain killers and sleeping a lot to try and get over it. There are a couple of things which have been very scary.  Mostly though it reminds me of when I had my cyst before and how helpless I felt.  There really isn't anything you can do to get better. It just takes time for the body to heal itself, and pain medication  to help you sleep so that your body can heal.  Not exactly the answers I was looking for.    I have the second round of interviews in coos bay on the 3rd.  I've been spending time every day sending energy to the interview.  I very much want to live on the coast and get away from all the competition.  I don't want to leave my friends, and I know that many of us will continue to keep in touch either by writing or messageing... Adn some people you were only meant to touch for a moment and then each of you goes on.  One step at a time though.  I ahve to get through the interveiw first them I'll worry about where I'm going to live and how much I'll miss my friends.   For now though, its only 1230 but the percoset is kicking in and I can't keep my eyes open.  My pain level is down to about a 2 and I need to take advantage of that and go crawl into bed.  I really need to do something for Bobbi we has been such a good friend.  trill

      I finally decided to get a blog. I'll be organizing my thoughts and thinking about things that I might put in my BOS.

      Had to go back into the hospital for a few days.  Actually had to call and get an ambulance this time. (Sorry Gail didn't mean to throw up on your ear.) They scoped me and found several ulcers in my stomach and intestines.  Also decided that the pain in my lower abdomin was being caused by a pinched nerve.  So I'm trying some medication the targets those nerves.  So far it seems to be working really well.    Except :( my picc line is infected.  Its a scary infection because the picc line goes up throught the artery to the heart.  I'm taking antibiotics and using wet heat to try and break up any clots and reduce the swelling.  I can't make my arm straight because of the swelling.  Its like a muscle cramp right in the elbow.   Sigh... I'm tired of being sick.  And I'm tired of being tired.  I went to the dr, the bank and the pharmacy today and came home exhausted.  I had to sit in the car for 20 minutes at the pharmacy before I could even drive home. So I'm going to go take a nap and put heat on my arm again.  Took a quiz off of Kurts blog... thought it was kind of interesting.    You are a Spiritualist.

      I'm not having a good morning pain wise.  Its been hard to concentrate.   http://www.livejournal.com/users/koenbear/204535.html   koenbear posted a question... what does perfect love and perfect trust mean to you?    With animus we approached this question deliberately, and made it an unofficial bylaw of the group.  It meant that we accepted each other without hesitation or judgement.  That we loved each other unconditionally and accepted any decision that was made as being in the best interest of the group as well as each of us individually.    Earthengrove grew into it, or meandered into it in the way that earthengrove grows and does things.  I'm not sure when it happened but the result is the same.  Mutual respect (even if we squabble), and genuine love and good will.  I trust this group with my spiritual life and my physical wellbeing.

      It was a really long night last night.  My pain level went through the roof again.  Went to the Dr this morning, and he is sending me for another test on Friday.  He talked to a surgon again.  I think I might be finally going to get explored to find out what is wrong.  I'm pretty sure that my left ovary and probably part of my intestines are wrapped up in some adhesions.    At any rate he gave me some more pain killers and the prep kit for the test on friday.  Barium enima ... whoo hoo :(  Went to work for the cpr/aed training.  I had Mary Charpentier pick me up because I didn't think I could drive.  It was only 3 hours and I did ok.  The medicine lasted pretty much the whole time.  And I was able to ask people to donate time for me.  Which will be really nice... even if its just a little bit.  Also got my AFLAC forms today.  Must do paperwork tomorrow.  To bed now though.

      I had to come home early from work.  I was there 4 hours.  I guess I should have been more conservative.  I was really dissapointed when I came home but I had a lot of pain.  I'm going to have to talk to dr chee about it tomorrow.  I still really just don't feel like myself.  I hurt and I shouldn't.    I'm going to bed.

      I'm going to work today.  I'm just going to be a calltaker so if I have to get up and go to the bathroom, or leave it won't leave anyone in the lurch.  I'm going to the dr's before I go though to get my note and make sure he's still getting my referral.  I still haven't made up my mind about coos bay.  I really need to do that.

      I've been feeling really down all day.  I've cried several times, and finally had to tear the bed apart and start washing it because I kept going back to bed.  I'm going back to work tomorrow and thats a good thing.  I still can't eat solid food and that is really starting to get me down.  Plus I still hurt.    Took a bath tonight in silent white which is my favorite lush bomb.  When I was meditating I realized I just can't move.  I lose so much.  There are some good things, mostly living at the beach, but I lose all my friends and everything I've worked for here.    Sigh... I think I'm going to take a few more days to think about things.  Go to work tomorrow and see how it goes.  I need food.

      I was supposed to go to work today, but when I called to get a note my dr was off for the day.  I called work and they said I couldn't come back without a note.  So I'm home for the weekend.    Not a totally bad turn though.  I still don't feel like myself although I'm getting there.  Its probably an ok idea to stay at home for a few more days.  I keep having these dizzy spells, with stabbing pain.  Not as bad as when I was in the hospital but still really strong.  I started working on the background check packet this afternoon.  It's really long.  The bummer part is that dad is in the san juans and he has some of this information.  I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to get my hands on it.  I know that my WCCCA packet has all the addresses of the places I've lived.  I just don't know how to get it without lying.  Although its really time to tell them that I'm pretty sure I'm leaving.  I feel kind of guilty about it.  Its all timing though.  Getting sick was not what I needed.  I didn't do it on purpose, and I applied for the job well before I started having problems.  Sigh. damn ethics.  I have to keep the two things separate.  I applied for the job a long time ago.  I didn't get sick on purpose, it just happened this way.  I don't know what to do.

      Well I've been in the hospital again.  The GI test showed that I had a blocked bowel.  So 5 more days in the hospital.  Big tube in my nose to suck everything out of my stomach.  It was icky.  I'm home now though.  Still having moments where I feel like complete crap.  I'm going to go back to work tomorrow.  One of the medications makes me really dizzy though, so it will be interesting.  I did tell Mark that since my digestive system is messed up it would be good to be either a relief body or just a calltaker so I can get up and go to the bathroom if I need to.  I got the background check packet from Coos Bay today.  It's really long.  I have to find a way to get a copy of the background info that I did for WCCCA so I don't have to look all this stuff up again.    Tonight animus finally did our beltaine ritual.  I made a beautiful wreath representing the goddess to go around spirit candle.  When I move they are not going to kick me out of animus.  And we're going to try really hard to work it so that we can at least meet for the sabats.  I'm very relieved.  I feel that moving is a good decision, but leaving behind my coven Is a much harder decision to make.  theyve promised to come visit. an I will too.  Thats it for tonight... I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open.  To all my guides... rally round this form is long I'm going to need as much help as you can give md

      Went to the dr yesterday again, he set me up with an upper GI test.  It sucked.  I had to drink this glue and they took xrays of the barium in the goo.  Nasty nasty.  On top of it tasting bad, I've been so nauseus trying to drink anything I had a hard time getting it to stay down.  Three and a half hours later I was done.  Came home and took a nap.  I'm so tired. Probably a combination of being sick and the pain pills.  Dr chee called and said that I have an intestinal blockage probably caused by the earlier surgery.  So I'm still not eating.  I go back to visit him in the morning and he's going to tell me what needs to happen.  Then I'm going to Earth and Air for a massage.  I don't want any deep tissue work, just some gentle stretching, and some reiki.    Today was Lani's birthday. I met her at applebees for dinner and dessert. Well she and Breanna ate, I watched.  She's having a more extensive party this weekend.  I'm going to try to go to work but I'm not completely confident that is the right thing to do.  But I feel guilty because I've been out for 2 weeks.    Other than that ritual is tomorrow night at Jeff's.  It should be fairly short.  Nathan and alicia aren't going which  bums me a little.  I'm going to bed again.  Doing anything wipes me out.  sigh.

      Went back down to coos bay (coquille) this last sunday and monday for a follow up interview.  Today I got a call and was offered the job.  If I didn't still hurt, and I could eat solid food without puking it would have been great news.  Its still good news but I just haven't had time to process it all yet.    Started looking at houses, thinking about what things I need to throw away and what I definitely want to keep.  Trying to prioritize the things I own to keep the most important.  Mostly this was all theoretical and mental.  I still feel like crap and I'm so very tired.  Tomorrow I have another test.  It doesn't make sense that I still hurt.  Dr Chee is a very kind man and he listens and tries to do his best to help me.  Maybe this will go away as quickly as it came on and there won't be an answer.    I am very confident about the job, the place, the center, and moving... but thinking about leaving all my friends makes me want to cry.  Heck sometimes it does make me cry.  Ben has told me it is the right move.  I'm being pulled, and I'm needed again.  I'm not sure exactly what for but

      I worked 10 hours of overtime yesterday.  That was probably a mistake.  I was exhausted today and didn't get anything done.  I also made a discovery.  I didn't follow the routine that I had developed of drinking the protein drink in the morning, and then food for lunch and the remainder of the drink in the evening.  About 6:30 I started feeling very poorly.  Enough so that I took some pain meds which I havent done in almost 2 weeks.  So I made a shake with strawberries, and immediately started feeling better.   So, I ordered some more powder. I'm going to try the gi blend this time.   Mostly I spent today reading and playing with the dogs.  I'm still reading soulcraft.  The section I just finished was about totem animals.  It was an interesting concept.  His theory is that instead of a single animal people typically have several that represent different needs of different parts of our personality. The animals are often very different, but form a partnership with you as the common link.  This would explain my turtle/ badger combination.  I have never questioned that those two animals are part of my circle, but I have often not been able to conceptulalize why I would have animals so obviously different.    Because of its quiet but stabilizing force I often underestimate turtle.  It was not until breanna began talking about seeing a turtle as her guide did I remember and acknowledge  how turtle has changed my life.  I am much more patient, and harder to anger.  I am also more solitary, I need time alone to reconnect with myself.    I'm going to have to think about this concept more in the next few days.  I also ordered a book which Plotkin recommended that is completly focused on this idea.

      I worked overtime today.  My first full week back and I squeezed in and extra 10 hours.  So I'm making a lush order.  They have lots of new stuff.  I'm ordering some old standbys (karma solid shampoo yum) and trying some new things like you've been mangoed.    On another tangent... since I've been having trouble eating solid foods I ordered some protein powder and have been making shakes (1C fruit, 1/2 cup juice usually orange, 1 scoop powder, 2 tablespoons non fat vanilla yogurt, and a couple hand fulls of ice.) There has been a slow and steady increase in how I feel inside.  And how my digestion is getting back on track.  Without too many gory details, things are very regular. Strange or unhealthy food throws things back into a painful inconsistancy.  I need to continue remembering this.

      One full week of work.  A whole 40 hours.  I'm pooped.  I'm going to work 4 hours of overtime tomorrow and try to build up my banks again.  I'm relief so it will be short and eventful.  I haven't quite decided what to do with my weekend.  I'll be off tomorrow at the time I would normally go to work so it's not really going to cut into my hours.  I should probably go down to coos county and work on finding a place to live, or I could stay here and start the laborous process of sorting and cleaning and packing.  The boys both need baths.  I probably should have tried to get chuck into the groomer tomorrow.  Oh well. I'll see what tomorrow brings.  There's a couple of ways this could go.  I'm not sure how I feel about either option.

      ANTs hate hate hate them ... grrr.  they were in my kitchen on a knife that I had used to slice strawberries and didn't wash before I left for work.  grrr.  they are dead now.  Dead Dead Dead.  even a spider who was being oportunistic and catching them for dinner.  He's dead too.  he might have been an accomplace.  When it comes to ants kill first, don't as questions.  Man I hate ants.  I'm going to have to bomb the house now.  Ants suck.  grrrr.  wonder if this is why I have ulcers?

      Dreamed about a huge family reunion In a large palatial mansion.  There were tables set out for the reunion.  The rooms had plaques with names of my ancestors on them.  And portraits of people.  Some of whom I recognized and some I didn’t know.  There was an air of it being festive, but also an obligation.  Each of us had Schlosser plates. They were triangular in shape and had writing in silver on them.  I don’t remember what they said.  They were quite beautiful and everyone who was a Schlosser by blood (not marriage) had them so it was a great honor to have one of the plates.  My father was there although we did not arrive together.  We danced.  I remember being very very happy that I was able to dance with him.  There were also cards covered in plastic that told of our heritage.  There was a problem in one of the bathrooms, and someone came to get me to solve it.  The toilet seat was cracked.  A man there was trying to screw it back together but had not seen the crack.  The bathroom had two toilets so I said lets make this one a urinal and the other one for ladies.  Everyone agreed that was a great idea.    I wandered through the house for quite awhile after that.  There were many floors and lots of rooms.  This was all before dad arrived.  Dad didn’t get there until just before we were to sit down to dinner.  Some of the rooms were very big, and others quite small but I felt like each room held the memories of a specific person.  There was one very small room.  It had baby clothes hanging along one wall (like a closet without doors).  There was even a mobile over the small crib.  There was intense sadness in that room, and I left quickly.  Other rooms were great halls with trophies, or heads of animals and great gun collections.    As the dinner was about to start everyone moved onto the lawn.  Tables were arranged in patterns. There was a large T shape that had just Schlossers.  Elders were at the top of the T and everyone else down stalk of the T.  There were waiters with large plastic covered cards so if you were having trouble finding your position they would help.  The triangular plates were very important and some people who thought they should be able to sit at the t were seated elsewhere because they did not have their plates.    I woke up before the dinner was served.

      I've been drinking protein drinks for about a week now, along with taking plant enzyme, fiber, and probiotics.  I'm noticing a difference in my shape.  Which is good I suppose.  I'm still having a lot of trouble eating solid foods except for the most bland.    Yesterday was not a good day.  I was shakey for most of the day and really felt terrible.  I ended up in tears for quite awhile.  I'm feeling much the same way today.  My pain is back in my pelvis, and I'm shakey.  I'm going to try and get some things done today and rest in the afternoon.    Tonight is animus ritual.  I move from fire to water.  Which also means that I'm in charge now.  This year has been awesome in terms of my growth and my relationship to the elements.  Today I have to write my essay and new devocation.  I'm looking forward to it.

      This week at work was hit and miss.  I managed to stay one full shift, and then fell apart.  I think I'm pushing too hard, and it just sets me up for failure.  This weekend I'm planning much relaxation, very little stress, and lots of fruit.    Fruit seems to stay down well.  I bought strawberries, cherries, blueberries, blackberries, mangoes and nectarines.  I also bought some vanilla yogurt instead of milk.  I think it will be less frothy and cover the protein better.  Bill arrived this morning shortly after I got up.  He only stayed for a few hours.  Did some laundry and made me go to ganga.  It was not a good food choice, but I think that most of it is out of my system now anyway.  My heart still belongs to him. Its different now, but I'm comfortable with it.  I haven't been able to find the words which is why I haven't written about it.  I appreciate him for who he is, but I don't have any expectations anymore.  I enjoy him immensly while he is here, but when he leaves I no longer feel lost.  I know that he would come if I needed him no matter what.  I would do anything he asked me to do, absolutely the best I could.  And that is the best type of friendship.    Today is overcast.  It's lovely.  The past few days have been insanely hot.  Which has probably contributed to my feeling so poorly.  Even the dogs seem to be enjoying the cool.  Soon we will be at the coast where the weather is often like this.  In a house that I own. In a town where I will know the people, and they will know me.  Where I can make a difference, and make the lives of my grandmother and aunt better.

      One work week down.  I went to work every day, and even though I only stayed a full 10 hours on one of the days, I'm proud of myself.  I know its going to take time, but I pushed and got a little closer to normal this week.  The weekend looks to be pretty busy.  Everyone is coming on thursday night for an extra special coven event.  We are going to deliberately invoke fairy.  Yes deliberately.  I'm quite excited to see who comes.  The list of things to do before then is ginormous.  But again, if I want to continue to get better I need to be gentle with myself.    I ordered some protein powder today.  I'm going to try changing my diet to include a fruit drink with time released protein in the mornings.  I'm still having difficulty eating and so I think that this will help increase my nutritional intake.  It might also help me lose more weight which would be extra good, however, I want to practice it slowly and develop the habit.  I kind of feel like I'm getting a new start moving to the coast.  If I work hard and show some discipline I can make healthy choices and really make the most of this move.  I've talked about how I feel this is the correct move to make from a standard of living point of view, and spiritually, but it can also be a health choice.  If I find a place in coquille (which I think I can) I could walk to work most of the time.  And even if I don't walk to work, its very easy and a short drive to the beach where I could take the dogs and do a long walk most days.  So making changes to the way I eat makes sense.  My stomach has shrunk in the past 8 weeks from not being able to eat, I should be able to use this to my advantage although it is still going to take discipline.  Having 2 meals a day already planned out as liquid though should make things easier to manage.    For now though I need to sleep a little longer, before I get up and start running errands.  The dogs needed out or I wouldn't have gotten up.  Remembering to be gentle with myself.

      I did it.  I stayed at work for a whole shift.  I was very tired when I got home.  Today I still feel a bit drained but I'm going to try again.  The only way to get my stamina back up is to just keep pushing myself a little farther each day.    I've been kind of thinking about starting a partial liquid diet.  I had a jamba juice yesterday with fruit and protien powder.  I think I'll do a little research and find out what kinds of powders are available to add to fruit and start having something to take to work.  And then eat only 1 time a day.    I feel like there is a big change coming. I mean besides the move. Its a very exciting time.

      Its saturday morning.  I'm still dizzy.  Beginning to wonder if I'm ever going to feel like normal again.    Did talk to Mark briefly about the Coquille application.  He was going to fill it out last night.  Also reminded Wil to look for his.  Talked to John also.  He had a good point, and got me to thinking.  I am moving across the state and to the coast.  A big motivator is the change in lifestyle, as well as my family.  I don't know why but it is important what people think of me, even though I won't likely see anyone from work again.  However, I think that they will understand if I tell them the reason I am moving.  It's not because I dislike my job, I'm going to be doing the same job, it's not because I dislike wcccca, I'm making a change because it's the best thing to do for me physically, spiritually and emotionally. And really what matters is how I feel about myself not what other people think.  So I'm going to try going to work again. I'm going to stay calm and be patient with myself.  Its going to take a long time.  I need to remember that.  I was very sick, and I'm better now, but I'm not 100%.  I will eventually get back my stamina but probably not for 6 months or so.   Long walks on the beach will help. Warm sun, and cool nights.

      Sigh.  I didn't make it a whole shift.  Mark had to drive me home at 10 because I was too shakey to drive myself.  Sam and Gina are going to bring my car over later.  I officially feel like crap.  Going to bed. Trying not to beat myself up.

      One more post from Soulcraft...  The wandering time is neither easy nor painless. It tests what you are made of.  It reveals you to yourself, down to your very marrow.  The second cocoon will result in the disintegration of almost everything you know about yourself and the world.  The butterfly, of course understands this.  There are three phases to the butterfly's life cycle: the larva (caterpillar) the pupa or chrysalis (in the cocoon) and the imago (a mature adult, a butterfly).  The transformational chrysalis phase is one of the great mysteries of biology.  No one knows exactly how the caterpillar changes form in such a dramatic way. But this much is known:  inside the caterpillar's body are clusters of cells called, of all things, imaginal buds.  Imaginal refers to the imago, the adult phase, but it also means "to imagine" and psychologists use the word imago to mean an idealized image of a loved one, including the self.  The imaginal buds contain the idealized image, the blueprint, for growing a butterfly.  While the caterpillar goes about its earth crawling business, these cells, deep inside, are imagining flight.

      I only have a short time to write before I need to get ready for work.  Animus ritual last night was nice.  It was short but we raised a lot of energy for each element, and directed it towards spirit.    I am fire. Passion, inspiration, destructive force for positive change.  Respect me and you shall be comforted. I am fire.  I am starting to feel the swell that is pushing me towards coquille.  That magical pull which says there is a new challenge and a new opportunity.  Without thinking about it I am annoyed that it is taking so long.  That I can't really begin planning until I hear the background check is complete.    The fairy ritual next week with earthengrove feels like a celebration of everything I have learned in the past 3 years.  A gathering of my power and the people who have gone on this journey with me.    It is an exciting time.

      I need to begin writing my fairy ritual for the 17th.  It's going to involve lots of singing, laughter and energy.  A release of all the bounty that is available for whatever journey each of us chooses to take.    I'm a little concerned about the fire dancers and someone from the condos possibly calling work.  I will write a sib and talk to the supervisor though and hopefully avoid any problems.    This is probably my last ritual with this group of people as a whole.  They have been good friends, good spriritual partners, and I want to thank them for every thing they have given me.  It will be sad, but also a time to celebrate what we have learned and how we have grown.    My pain level is up today.  I called for a few more pain killers.  I am having some sharp pains again.  For now I'm going to go lay in bed and read, the warmth of the electric blanket seems to help.  It is very cold and windy today, much more like feb than june.  I wish I had more energy, but I know I need to be patient.  I was sick for lots of days, it will take many more to get back to feeling like myself again.

      I am reading a book called Soulcraft by Bill Plotkin.  The chapter I'm on is called Sinking back into the source of everything.  I want to share a little bit of this chapter just as something to think about for next weeks ritual.  This section is about listening for, and following, a calling.  It might be a call to follow a spiritual path, a career path, a relationship... what matters is that its a calling which changes your life dramatically and permanantly.    How do you know when a call is truly a call to spiritual adventure and not, for example, a momentary disorientation, a mood, a rogue feeling or an excuse for fleeing responsibilities that have become too much or too fearful?  How do you know  it's not just a sudden encounter with unsown wild oats or the need for a long overdue vacation?  First if it is a true call, you will know that responding to it is, in fact, not and avoidance of responsibility, but rather a facing of something difficult, something unknown, and frightening that summons you.  Far from looking to you like an opportunity for escape, a call feels more like a compelling need to walk into the mouth of a whale, or out into the night and into a storm.  You have a profound sense that something essential is waiting for you in the midst of a wilderness and your one true life depends on your being willing and able to find it. . . .  You are a prospective immigrant, as Adrienne Rich tells us, and you must make a choice between safety and a dangerous passage:  Either you will go through this door or you will not go through  If you go through there is always the risk of remembering your name.  Things look at you doubly and you must look back and let them happen.  If you do not go through is is possible to live worthily  to maintain your attitudes to hold your position to die bravely.  but much will blind you, much will evade you, at what cost who knows?  The door itself makes no promises. It is is only a door.  Crossing that threshold into your uncharted future is an act of great courage and self-compassion, and it changes your relationship to life in a fundamental way.  It embodies your willingness  to employ a new form of risk taking, to consciously choose growth-stimulating, soul-nourishing conflicts, to live through the accompanying anxiety, and to accept your life as open ended and unpredictable.  Passing through that door commits you to living in the present in a way you never before have.

      Bill came over on monday night after I got home from work.  Its different haveing him here now.  I love seeing him, I love having him here, but I'm not crushed when he leaves.    I'm feeling so much better.  We even went for a little walk in the forest today.  I saw a yearling, and a waterfall.  The walk reinforced for me the idea that I need to move closer to nature.  That's the way to get back to me.  The person I miss is the one that luaghed all the time.  And didn't worry about well everything.  I hope I'm not setting my expectations too high for this move.  Its a chance to start over. To make friends and roots for the rest of my life.  A quiet, peaceful, healthful life.

      It's monday, and I'm going to try going back to work today.  Just 5 hours.  I think it will be ok.  I have to find the strength to stay and do a good job.    I have a strong work ethic  and it upsets me not to go to work.  The only way I'm going to feel like things are back to normal is if I can work.  Intellectually I know that I need to be patient with myself and give me the time to heal.  But I  also know that mentally unless I'm being productive I'm not going to progress physically.    So its off to the showers to get ready to go in.

      One more post for today.    Grandma called a little while ago.  The conversation made my choice very clear.  She is lively and excited about me moving.  Sharon is gone on a ride for the next couple of weeks.  I think grandma had gotten used to having someone around and now that she is alone again (even if only for a short time) she is looking for companionship.  I feel really good about knowing that I'll be able to be there for her.  I would so much have liked to take her some of the chicken soup I made tonight.  Or just checked in.  I'll be convincing her to help with my yard too.    I wish I could have done the same for Grandma Nan.

      I didn't go to work today.  My brain was still fuzzy, and the pain in my abdomen it high so I'm taking pills.  Mostly I've just slept again today. It's getting old.  I just started some chicken veggie soup in the crock pot, and a loaf of bannana bread.  I think a simple dinner will be good and I'll try going back to work tomorrow.    Alicia asked me yesterday if I thought that my illness was related to a blocked chakra or some other magical explaination. Its not something that I had particularly thought about.  I think that part of the cause for my illnes is the environment I'm living in.  I remember when I was in Irvine I never felt quite whole.  The pollution from population density, car noise, and disconnect from nature affected me.  I think the process has been slower since I moved back, but still a part of the gradual wearing down of my resources.      I was also thinking about how I felt the day that Lani and I walked on the beach with the boys.  We didn't go far but for the first time in weeks I felt like I could go on forever.  I was hearing my mothers heartbeat.  The fog a gentle kiss on my cheek.   I think I've made the right decision to move.  It's true that my relationships with my friends here will change.  Some people I won't be friends with anymore.  But I will make new friends, and being close to my family is really important.  I'm really excited about being able to be a part of Krysten and David's life.  And being able to take them so Grandma also gets to see them more will be a really nice thing.

      I went to work today but had to come home early.  I got really dizzy and started making mistakes.  I ended up in tears in Sheryl's office.  I don't know if I'll go tomorrow or not.  I want to work.  I need to work. But I still hurt.  I called the on call dr when I got home to get a few more pain pills.  I'm also bleeding again.  I want to write about more than just being sick.  Lani picked me up and we went to Harry Potter.  I was able to keep down my dinner which was a definite plus.  The movie was ok. It felt rushed to me though.  There weren't as many details as in the other movies.  I'd like to see it again though when I'm not on viacodine.    I have to find the courage to tell someone that I'm thinking about taking the job in coos bay.  I think it is a healthy move for me.  I know how being around the ocean makes me feel mentally, physically and spiritually.  And in the end I have to do what is good for the long run.  I might just be moving into the house that I'll spend the rest of my life in.  Or at least a very long time, before I have to take care of Aunt Sharon.  Ronald Reagan died today. Regardless of politics his passing should be treated with respect.  He was a human who lived a varied and powerful life.  In addition to being a president he had a family and people that loved him.  Something that every human can relate to.  In fact if we could make that connection more frequently then perhaps this world might be a safer place.    Sigh... I really need to start getting things sorted and packed,  or at least organized.   Food today -  Grape Juice 12-oz tuna sandwich with cheese (threw up about 1/2)  Lemonade 24-oz  Sprite (16oz) 1/2 dinner salad no dressing tenderloin tips with mushrooms (2oz) Mashed Potatoes Asparagus spears  Bottle of water 1 mint candy 4 oz applesauce

      I made it through 5 hours at work.  It wasn't so bad but I'm very very tired tonight.  I'm also crampy again which I don't understand.  I took 10mg of pain pills and hope that clears it up.  It's weekend so there won't be any way to get anything else if my pain comes back.    It was sure nice to see everyone at work.  Well the people that I like anyway.  And its nice to get back into a normal routine.  I'm extremely grateful that they are letting me work just half shifts this week.  I don't think I could have made it through a full 10 hours.    I'm still having a lot of nausea problems.  There were a couple of times today when I thought I was going to loose it.  I think I'll have to take my phenergan with me to work.  I also am so close to tears so much of the time.  Its very frustrating to me.  I feel very alone even though I know there are people who will help me, and my family is there for me if I just ask.   But they are very far away.  I'm 35 years old and all I want is my mommy.  How pathetic is that?  I'm sure its just fatigue.  My body is worn out from being sick, and so each new challenge seems overwhelming.     Catherine is also sick now.  She had to go to the er twice.  Its possibly a gallbladder problem but the ultra sound was inconclusive.  She's going to see a gastroenterologist next week.  It concerns me that maybe this was something that I gave her, while I was sick.  I don't think thats very likely but I still worry about her.  She has grif though and since he's not working he can totaly dote on her.  She is up at the lake this weekend relaxing.    I'm so tired.

      Its been awhile since I wrote.  Last week was pretty bad.  The infection in my arm was causing a lot of problems.  I eventually called for Bill to come in and take care of me for a couple of days.  It was really nice having him here.  He's still a very good friend despite all the things that have happened between us.  I'm still haveing trouble keeping food down.  I think its probably the antibiotics, but I'm going to have to wait and see.  Dr doesn' think that its a good idea to stop taking antibiotics just yet since my arm is still swollen, and I have a fever off and on.  I finally sent the background check form to Coos Bay (Coquille).  I talked to LT Cook yesterday and he is sending out the letters to all my references. Intellectually I know that there isn't anything in my past which will disqualify me for the job, but its still nerve wracking to have someone looking at your life with that kind of a microscope.  I need to start working on finding a place to stay now.  I'm worried because I had about 120 hours of vacation time saved up that was going to be the money I used to move.  With being sick and not working I've used all of that and more, so I don't have a bank anymore.  I know I'll get some money from Aflac but I'm not sure how much.  I know it will work out because its supposed to.  And worse case scenario I stay with Grandma for a few months until I can save enough money up for a house.

      I have created a database for my tarot draws.  It is nearly my birthday and this year I want to draw cards every day and see if I can determine patterns.  What interests me about the idea is the patterns over time.  So I will do a 3 card draw - card 1 is spiritual, card 2 physical, card 3 emotional.  Card 3 will most likely indicate the relationship between or the conflict between the first two cards.    I have been watching this very small spider on my desk lamp today.  Mostly he has hung about 2 inches below the adjustment knob, but then he crawls up and falls back.  It is like he has some plan but he is so very small he is having trouble working it out.  I will have to see what he accomplishes over night.

      I am working on a ritual for splinter group this weekend.  The ritual will be next thursday after I get back from the coast.  Since we have each now completed all 4 elements I want to do something to celebrate that.  About a month ago we did a ritual where we stood palm to palm and passed the energy of our current element to the person on our left.  The energy of the person on your right entered through your right hand and was merged with your element and passed through your left.  It was a very powerful experience, but each person was only responsible for their current element.  This time I would like to have each of us focus on each element in turn and build that energy into our circle.  So the energy is 4 times as strong as it was for the other ritual.  And the energy going into spirit will be 16 times as great.  There is still a lot of work to be done on the details though. I think I will go read some more ... expect details later.

      Its almost time to go to work.  I'm tired today.  Maybe I'll perk up when I get there.    3hours later...  I didn't perk up it got worse.  I have a lot of pain in my left ovary again.  Right where there is theoretically nothing wrong.  I have an obgyn apt on wednesday so I guess I'm going to try and lump it.  I'm about 2 notches from going to an emergency room though.  I took some pain pills and another phenergan.  I feel like I'm starting over with another round of the same pain.  I don't understand and it makes me very angry.  Hopefully something will change on wednesday.    I keep thinking that part of my problem is just the stress of living where I do and working where I do.  Last night I listened for 2 hours as 3 co workers shredded other co workers.  That is way more stressful to me than the actual job. I have answered over 300 phone calls this week in addition to my radio time.  People are mean and cruel.  They stick their noses in each others business because they are packed together in high density housing.  They do not talk to each other about problems, but instead yell and then expect police to come sort it out.  I am discouraged about humanity... or the lack of it.  This is why my gut hurts.

      Worked a full 10 hours today.  It was a very long day. I continue to be amazed at how little gratitude people have for the freedom that we enjoy.  I had a woman ask me tonight if I knew what a nigger was?  Frankly no.  I have too great a respect for people to call anyone that name. I know that sometimes a person has to be described by the color of their skin, but its only a part of the descriptors that I ask.  It made me angry and sad at the same time.  I hope they do move back to Montana.  I had ofcrs on the way to a call with a gun. My questions were completely appropriate and respectful.  I'm going to bed

      Has a very relaxing day the last 2 days of my weekend.  Working an extra day had made me more tired than I expected. On Tuesday I saw the detective that was working on my background check.  He said you're not supposed to be here... I said I'm working over time. :) We had a nice conversation for about 15 minutes and I continue to feel that they are real people.  They do their job because its part of who they are but they haven't lost their humanity.    Here's another little bit from soulcraft.  I'm not sure yet why this spoke to me as it did.  I decided if I wrote about it I might understand better.  Toward the end of a vision fast in the mountains, I strolled from my solo camp down through a meadow to say good-bye to a furry little pika friend with whom I had exchanged whistles and chatters on several occasions.  Upon reaching the edge of my friend's rocky village, I perched myself on the flat top of a six foot high cube of a boulder and waited for him to appear, which he did soon enough among the  small rocks and grasses below.  I spoke to him for a long time.  He sat very still.  I spoke softly and at length of my gratitude for him and his family, including his ancestral relatives who had lived twenty years earlier at a nearby lake and had taught me about spiritual gathering.  He listened attentively.  Then I asked him if there was anything he wanted to say before I left.  Immediately, and for the first time since I began to talk, he moved. He hopped about a foot to his left beneath the roof of a small boulder in a pika sized cavelike room.  He sat comfortably in that cozy spot as if he had just arrived home from a long journey.  He looked up at me with his big black eyes and smiled.  Then he hopped another foot beneath a tiny spruce and chewed on some seeds he found there.  He looked at me again.  Okay I replied, as tears escaped by eyes, thank you pika. You be well too.  God bless you and yours.  I found his message to be as eloquent and stirring as the lines from a favorite poem by Derek Walcott:  The time will come when, with elation, you will greet yourself arriving  at your own door, in your own mirror and each will smile at the others welcome  and say, sit here. Eat You will love again the stranger who was yourself.
