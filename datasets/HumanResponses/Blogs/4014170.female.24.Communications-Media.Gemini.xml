      So I just got home from work... and blah.. its honestly been a long ass day.&nbsp; I should be asleep because I do have to get up at like 630am or 7am and be out of the house by 730am :(&nbsp; Why is my remote so damn early.. then I have my air shift from 2-6pm :(&nbsp; blah ah well... I just cant really sleep tonight I guess.&nbsp; Jen isnt here, she is in PA visiting nick which is awesome but its hard now to sleep alone.&nbsp; She hasnt been gone 24 hours and I miss her like crazy already...&nbsp; its kinda scary to be home alone though.&nbsp; Its the first time since we moved in together that I had to stay home here alone for the weekend. :0/&nbsp; alrighty.. well its time for me to try and find some dinner and try and get to bed.&nbsp;ugghh

      So I decided to start another online journal.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, I'm not quite sure.&nbsp; I took a long break from the internet journal for a while.&nbsp; Just needed to take a break from&nbsp;it I guess.&nbsp; So, out with the old and in with the new so they say.&nbsp;   Jen and I wake up around I guess 10ish, chilled out and made some kick ass breakfast together.&nbsp; She cooked up the omlettes and I cooked up the diced potatoes.&nbsp; Nothing like a good breakfast in the morning with the girly.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; She got ready for her trip out to PA.&nbsp; I just decided that I was gonna be a bum :)&nbsp; After she was on her way I got into the shower and got cleaned then put some laundry in the wash and decided to start my bumness :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing the laundry and just chilling around the house before I have to leave for work tonight.&nbsp; Arg.. I know its gonna be busy as hell tonight too.&nbsp; People are gonna try and take some spot out of their stopsets and throw them into mine when mine are actually filled out too!&nbsp; I dont think im gonna have much of a show tonight.&nbsp;   So, it's Friday (finally),&nbsp; I just got done playing some guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its honestly been just way to long since&nbsp;I've played.&nbsp; I just honestly haven't had the time to pick it up and start&nbsp;getting some songs together.&nbsp; Work is kinda kickin me&nbsp;in the ass&nbsp;right now since is&nbsp;summer and its the season&nbsp;of&nbsp;hell. :)&nbsp; I felt&nbsp;like&nbsp;I've been working 7&nbsp;days a week for almost the whole month... hmm.. wait a&nbsp; minute.. I HAVE been working 7 days a week!! haha :-/&nbsp; Ah well, Im getting extra money which I honestly can't complain about.&nbsp; I really need the money right now.&nbsp; *random mental note: I hate it when&nbsp;a person gets online and sends you and IM, strikes up a conversation and then says, "sorry but i gotta get going i'll be back in 15 mins."&nbsp; Why the hell did you IM me knowing that you werent gonna be able to talk? blah.. *   I think Im gonna end this post.&nbsp; Not much left to say right now.
