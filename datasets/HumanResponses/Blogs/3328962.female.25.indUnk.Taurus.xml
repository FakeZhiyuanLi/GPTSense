      Turn on the radio or television in Australia today and without a doubt you will hear a familiar and always chilling rendition of "the Last Post".    April 25 is the anniversary of Australian and New Zealand troops landing at Gallipoli during WWI, and easily the most significant day on the Australian calendar.  Right throughout the country, and indeed around the world, Australians take this day to remember the people who have fought wars for the freedom of Australia and it's people.  Traditionally the day begins with a dawn service and the laying of wreaths at war memorials and monuments.  In the morning many cities host a remembrance march where surviving veterans and their families along with those who never returned from war don their medals and walk a route through the streets to a memorial monument..  Later in the day people venture to their local pubs or clubs to catch up with old mates and play two-up, a game where you bet on a couple of old pennies or something like that.  This year's Sydney march was led by one of only six surviving WWI veterans, and the only one in good enough health to head out.  People have their own way of remembering those who fought and gave their lives so that our country can be the free place it is, whether it is public commemoration or simply by wearing a sprig of rosemary, something my mum does every year.    The ever-increasing turnout of young people at Anzac Day events shows that the spirit of those who fought will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come.  Lest we forget.

      if you are like me and need a high quality caffeine hit to get going in the morning, then check this article   urlLink coffee culture     i'm a self-confessed coffee snob (house rule - no instant coffee allowed!) with my "usual" being a double-strength capuccino.  I think the best stuff ever comes from my local deli....the perfect hit every time, Rob who owns the place is a great guy, it's a stones throw from my house and the best part...........i never thought that coffee this good could be found on Sydney's northern beaches!!!  According to the list in the article you have to head to the inner city to find quality......no way.  My vote goes to the humble Taste Deli at Collaroy Beach!!

      as i sit here and blog my first entry i am also playing detective. no no, i don't have a uniform but someone has been a very bad boy (or girl!?).  i received an email last night from someone i don't know and have never even heard of. they named someone i know, then proceeded to tell me i should pack up and move to the other side of the world because the subject was madly in love with me.   hence the investigation...trying to get to the bottom of things. there are only a few select individuals with the email address used and so far no luck. even the person who was referred to in the email doesn't know of the sender.  anyone that can offer me any suggestions to get to the bottom of this please please HELP!! if nobody knows......it begs the question: just who knows who you are and where to find you???

      Some skunt with a towbar reversed into my car and as a result you can't read the front license plate anymore.  He also managed to do damage to the grill and the bumper but that should polish out.    I think I know who it was too, someone in a bloody 4WD (that has never seen a dirt road in it's existence) who works in the same office building as me.  So...the new plates have been ordered and my father (bless him!) will go collect and put the new ones on for me.  While he's at it, he might also put air in the tyres, get rid of the cobwebs and maybe even wash it!  Fingers crossed.

      Okay, so I set this blog up with the obvious intent of using it!  But each time I think "yeah, about time I posted something" I suffer from a serious mental blank.  Could it really be that I have nothing to say?  Or am I just crumbling under pressure?  When I look at blogs belonging to other people I know, such as  urlLink Letters from the West Village  or  urlLink Planet Ryan  or the good old  urlLink CC Blog  I am ashamed at my lack of....well......creativity, inspiration, thought etc.  As of today, I vow to blog at least every second day.  Even I have nothing to say.  You can read inane crap that takes up space.  But there will be something.

      Finally finally finally!!!    I am wireless at last.  No longer will you find a cable running through my house depending on which room I feel like sitting in.  I am so set here now.  Free to roam about without shutting off my laptop, moving the modem etc.  Free to roam about the house without fear of tripping on the cable!  It's all good.  I am told that there is a chance the signal extends as far as my   urlLink deli  down the street!  Maybe I will try that one day.

      No, this thread has nothing to do with the theatre.  It's all about cricket.  Cricket websites, message boards to be precise.  So if you don't like cricket, don't read on!  As is evident from the permanent link from this blog,  urlLink CaribbeanCricket.com  is my #1 web site.  Cricketing or non-cricketing, that's my absolute favourite.  The original, and still the best!  The message board annoys the hell out of me often, but the reports are the BOMB.  In the last few weeks, a few other boards have popped up.     urlLink aussiecricket.net .  I like the look of this one.  The discussions are good and the software is the same as that used on CC, so I'm comfortable.  I never realised how much aussies call one another "mate" until I read this site!   urlLink windiesfan.com - a.k.a the "deadboard"  is, without wanting to state the obvious, another message board for discussion of West Indies cricket.  The site owner has gone to a lot of effort but it seems much of it has been in vain.  I feel bad for him in a way - people just aren't buying it.

      Okay, so I have been trying to get this up and running for some time now, much to my frustration as outlined  urlLink here  and once again  urlLink here .  It turns out that the device I have isn't compatible with my ISP's cable service.  Something entirely to technical for me to even understand, much less try and explain.   The thing that will get me to that happy, wireless point - and eliminate the unsightly cables running through my house depending on where I feel like being at the time - is  urlLink this .  It should be arriving tomorrow.  My fingers are crossed that I will enjoy a blissful, wireless weekend!

      I'm a student once more, having  urlLink enrolled   with the Australian College of Journalism.  In fact, I just hit send on my enrolment form and have paid my fees in full.  Here's hoping that this is the start of something great.  So if you don't see me online for a while, I'm not avoiding anyone!

      A much wiser person than me once said that if you love what you do then you need never work a day in your life.  More than 10 years after I first considered it, I've decided I want to study journalism.    I can't help but think if I'd just gone with my heart then I would have saved myself a lot of time and stress.  Why did I ever decide to study business and HR?  Why did I spend so many wasted years working jobs I hated?  Why did I take so long?   urlLink This  is what I am about to embark on.  I'm about 95% certain about it and will make a final decision and enrol within the next few days.

      No no all you gutter minded people!  Not  that  G-spot!  I'm talking G-mail.  No longer will I say "okay, drop me an e-mail".  Instead, it will be "drop me a G-mail"!  So I have set it up but really, I am yet to see what all the hype is about.  There is a shitload of storage space.....not a big deal for me.  Maybe I just haven't fully explored it, something I should do.    My biggest gripe is that it is web-based.  I love being able to open Outlook and have mail as a separate program.  There is a link to download something that contains the POP3 settings so I can link my G-mail to Outlook.  But I keep getting an error message.  If anyone out there can help me out with this, "drop me a G-mail"!  bekahja@gmail.com

      And that means tax time.  As I type I am literally up to my neck in papers and bills and statements and receipts and all the associated crap.  Yes, of course it would be easier to file them all away as I received them.  But I wouldn't do that!  Most of these things are still in sealed envelopes.  I must ask myself however, what's the rush?  I mean I haven't even lodged last years return.  I was all set to, downloaded the ATO's E-tax software, went through everything but didn't lodge.  You see I was waiting on one more statement.  By the time that arrived the electronic lodgement service period was over.    Looking at this mess around me is not helping with getting started.  Once it's done though I resolve to take everything to an accountant and just get it done.  They are much better at scamming things too....  Wish me luck!

      $2,420 later and I have my car back.  I went with  urlLink Option 1 .  As such I have decided to embrace the car.  I am going to treat it so well, I will even wash it by hand.  And for me, that is saying something!  I hated every minute of relying on other people to get around, so am over the moon to have my independence back.

      Yes, you heard correctly..... Please don't smoke!   Something has changed in me, a good 10 years into my smoking life and I have made the difficult decision to quit.  Three days in now and it has not been easy, yet still not as hard as I thought it may have been.  Made easier by me being sick I guess.    The true test will come when I get back into a normal routine, and start going to places and doing things I have long associated with smoking.  I'm lucky though, everyone is rallying behind me on this.  I'm quite convinced that everyone else thinks it's a far better decision than I do.  But that feeling will pass.  For now I need to focus on the positives - more money, better health, and everyone around me being much happier too - rather than how fucking hard it is.  I will get there....muchas gracias to all those supporting me right now.  J'taime!

      You may have read my  urlLink previous post  about my quest to go wireless.  I'm still not there.  Much thanks must go out to the person who is helping me get this going, in particular for  urlLink this tid-bit .    Tried it.....still didn't work.  But I know it will eventually.  I will repay you for your patience with me.

      I have been out of action a few days now, wondering what the hell I ever did to be struck with such excruciating pain as I felt Sunday and Monday just gone.    Many many tears, two trips to the doctor, two types of pain relief and some medication I will have to take every day for I don't know how long and I have a name for the condition.     urlLink Trigeminal Neuralgia  - click to read about it.  Well that is if anyone else actually cares to know, it may well just be me that is so obsessing over this.  The most reassuring thing I have read about this so far is the quote from that site about this being "the most painful affliction known to medical practice".  At least I know I wasn't making a mountain out of a molehill.

      I thought this would be easy.  Oh how very wrong I was!    I have all the equipment.  I have installed all the equipment.  I have a visible, working wireless connection.  The icons are there.  But can I actually use it to get online?  Hell no!  So many frustrated hours have been spent on this, including calls to 2 different tech people I know.  One even came to the house to get it going for me.  He spent ages downloading stuff to patch the product and..............nothing!  Now I know it works - I know someone using the exact same thing.  That is my last hope.  And I will get it to work, I just could live with it being a little bit easier.  The silver lining here?  By the time this is done, my geekification must almost be complete.

      Something my grandmother used to say about cars.  And it seems she was right.  Yep, my car has a serious illness.  Transmission - fucked.  Something I never heard of before called a "diff" - fucked.  Estimated repair cost - fucked.  And as usual, everyone has a different opinion on what I should do.  These have included:  1. Pay up and have it fully repaired, get a warranty on the work and continue with life.  Keep the car for another few years.  2. Trawl wreckers for a spare part - have that installed.  Keep the car a few months then offload it, with potential for another transmission breakdown, to some poor unsuspecting person.  3. Trade it in immediately.  Yes, this was a real smart idea given that it can't even be driven at the moment!  Nice one!  I'd get a whole lot for it and absolutely come out in front.  NOT!  4. Arrange for the car to disappear.  Not so smart on three counts: a) do not wish to be involved in insurance fraud; b) if it can't be driven how the hell can anyone make it disappear soon; and c) it's currently in some workshop where it has been since it was towed on Friday.  Having decided to go with option 1, I have faced workshop suggestions from almost everyone around me.  But a decision has been made.  I know what I'm going to have done and where I want it done.  Now I just need to scrounge up that $2,500 - $3,000.  Pronto!

      I had about 14 hours sleep last night.  No, I'm not being lazy - it was just much much needed.  The last couple of weeks have seen me lose a lot of valuable Zzzzz time.  As did the preceding few months, although it must be said that the circumstances were very very different.  I must be playing catch-up for all that time now, as last night I dozed off watching cricket and woke about 3 hours later.  Once I moved from the couch to my bed I slept from 3.30am to 2.30pm uninterrupted!   It was very much needed.  I feel rested.  A little more at peace.  It's all good.

      Buying something I really want and need is always a good way to boost my mood, and with things the way they are at present I felt that a little splurge was not without justification.    So I went out and bought a brand spanking new wallet.  It's gorgeous.  Soft soft leather.  Bright red.  Just enough pockets to fit my multitude of cards.  Oroton.  I *love* it.  Did I mention how soft it is?  And that leather smell.  Ooohh it is fine!  Another purchase....brazil nut body scrub.  Made from community traded brazil oil from the Amazon region, Soya oil from Brazil and sugar from Paraguay.  Smells good enough to eat.  After just one use I have sloughed away my stress and am feeling smooth and exhilarated.    This little exercise in retail therapy has assisted me in picking myself up, dusting myself off, and starting all over again.  **** who???

      My good friend Anna says everything happens for a reason.  In a philosophical mood I tend to concur, and right now I am clinging to that.  For after this week, there  must  be some divine reason for me having been through such a hellish time.    This week I have been left wondering in total oblivion as to why a man who claimed to love me, and that he wanted to spend forever by my side, would treat me with such a monumental lack of respect and care.  I was caught completely off guard, totally unaware and grossly unprepared.    And I still have no idea  why  this relationship ended, or even if it has actually ended.  I'm forced to conclude that it's over, and that he has taken the cowardly route and decided not to tell me.  That in itself is a total surprise.  We talked about *everything* and were in agreement that if, when, anything were to change we would talk openly and honestly about it.  And deal with it from there.  But talk is cheap.

      All I want is a Windies shirt. That fits. (sorry Larry!)    The usual ineptitude of the WICB abounds, with no merchandise available to buyers who can't make it to a cricket ground.  How sad it is to find the only kind of   urlLink West Indies Cricket merchandise  available online is this collection of tacky souvenir-style rubbish.

      July as the coldest month is becoming a recurrent theme.     Yes, it's the middle of winter here but I'm not speaking strictly  weather.  Of course the weather is nasty.  Bitterly cold,  especially in the evenings and early mornings.     But on another level, July is the coldest, most miserable and most  depressing month of the year.  July is a month where the bad  definitely outweighs the good, at least for this girl.     From memory, July 2002 was when I swiped the side of my car, causing  over a grand worth of damage.  July 2003 I suffered a broken heart  and started a job that offered so much stress I couldn't handle it and  the other down things in life by September.    Halfway through July 2004 a nd the trend continues.  On a work  level, things have pretty much hit rock bottom.  I'm not sure I  can handle it too much longer.  Any longer in fact.  And  being so unhappy there is getting me down and slowly creeping into  other aspects of my life.  I'm moody and depressed and at times  downright paranoid.  And I hate feeling like this.     Animals who hibernate for winter have the right idea.  Because at  the moment I feel to crawl in my bed and not come out for a very long  time.  To get up every day is a chore.  I'm tempted not  to.  Here's hoping that the imminent arrival of August brings  happier and calmer days.

      I've just discovered MSN Web Messenger.  It's a basic version of MSN Messenger that doesn't require any additional software, just a web browser!!  (Great news for someone who thinks that their nasty employer might just be softening a bit and bringing back unrestricted Net access!!)  You sign in with your net.passport just as you would sign into regular MSN Messenger.  You need to enter your date of birth and country before you can log in for the first time, but after that it's all systems go.   Microsoft are currently beta testing but Web Messenger is due to launch later in the year.   urlLink Click here to get it now!

      Earlier this year I did some freelance work writing advertorials.  Not very exciting but it was a start.  In the last week a couple of new opportunities have arisen, again not particularly exciting but experience all the same.  Oh, and very decent money.    A friend of mine needs a training manual for some software he has developed.  So whilst it's not really "writing" as I want to get into, I can use the experience I gained working in HR where I developed manuals for a variety of training programs.   The other is an opportunity to redesign and re-write the programs offered by my current employer.  I have said I'd consider doing it but not as part of my regular job.  I will do it as a separate job and bill them through my business.  So, potential to earn and write.  I think I will take them both up.  What have I to lose?

      My friends Quinn and Ema, together with their two year old son Gabriel, welcomed a baby girl in the early hours of this morning.  Her name is Mia.    All are doing well, so well in fact everyone - including Ema and Mia - have probably returned home by now.  Gabriel is said to be rather taken by her, as she bought him a gift in the form of a toy bulldozer.  What more could a two year old boy want??  I'd thought it (okay, I should now refer to the baby as "she" rather than "it" but in this sentence "it" is historical) would have arrived sooner.  Word in the office on Friday morning was that Ema had gone into labour, but when I was out buying lunch who should drive down the street right before me but Ema herself!  It turned out she was on her way to the acupuncturist in an attempt to bring on the labour rather than be induced this coming Monday.  And it seemed to work.  Welcome to the world little one!  You're in for a crazy ride.

      The Athens Olympics haven't even started yet, but already I am sooooo over them.  Pick up a newspaper, go to a news site, turn on the radio or television and you can't escape it.    It's almost as bad this time around as 4 years ago when they were here in my Sydney.  Okay, not quite as bad because now I don't have to deal with those pesky volunteers.  The ones who manned the city streets telling me which side of the road I could walk on as I headed to my office.    Australia's Olympic team have been embroiled in scandal for some months now.  As I'm sure is the case for most countries.  Our cyclists for example..... drugs..... bans..... resinstatements....more bans..... people being sent home from Europe.  Major turmoil within the shooting faction - someone had their gun license revoked for violent behaviour and missing the team only to appeal, be permitted to shoot and boot the replacement guy out of the team again.  Is Ian Thorpe the David Beckham of swimming?  A little too much thought going into appearances.    My friend Anna is on a plane to Athens as I write.  Her saving grace is that she isn't going *exclusively* for the games.  Me....I may turn to renting videos for the next month or so.  Or however long they go for.  Now I just to find a rental store within a 30 minute drive that I don't owe money to.

      And a new month.  Only one month of winter left now, and things for me will surely be better.  I mean, they *cannot* get any worse.    I had a good day.  Went to yum cha by the water.  Went to Max Brenner's chocolate shop for a Danish Toffee Hot Chocolate.  And picked up some more white drinking chocolate powder....that stuff is the bomb - if you can get your hands on it I recommend buying up!  Later in the afternoon went for coffee with my mum.  Did some housework.    Didn't study.  After everything I've had on my mind, that has been on the back burner.  But, July is gone and things are slowly but surely getting back to normal.  I'll be through it in no time.
