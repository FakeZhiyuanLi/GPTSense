      FEAR!  For such a small four letter word, it has the potential to conjure up the most horrific in emotions for any person. Fear. It's something that I've had to learn to try to overcome. It has been an uphill climb for quite some time now, but I feel like I'm reaching the summit.  Almost two years ago, I faced the worst fear I have ever known. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33. Throughout the last 21 months, I have had to learn how to let go of my fear so as not to let it consume my entire being.  I had never feared cancer. I had never given it much thought. After all, there is no history of any form of cancer on either side of my family. My family tree shows a long history of longevity, with most members living to a "ripe old age". No, cancer wasn't something I would ever have to worry about..................................not ME!  November 6, 2002. My doctor didn't mince his words, he was straightforward and firm. "You have a cancer and it needs to come out. I've took the liberty of arranging an appointment for you with the finest surgeon in the area. He's waiting for you in his office now". The words echo in my memory like it was yesterday.  How could this be? I don't have any family history. I've got two young children. How could this have happened?  I've always been a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Sometimes we are rewarded with the knowledge of why something took place much later down the road. Sometimes we never know the reasons. For whatever reason, there IT was. I plan on sticking around to find out the "why".  The cancer was small (to me it seemed huge), 1.4 cm. After surgery, we learned that there were no lymph nodes involved, for which we rejoiced and praised God. Because of the size (more than 1 cm), and my young age, my doctors recommended chemotherapy.  There's that FEAR again........................chemotherapy. That's a whole story in itself. I'll tackle it later.  The one thing that keeps coming back throughout this time is that word, again. FEAR. What must we do to overcome it? More on that later.
