      Hey you guys!!! I got a new screenname!!! It's awesome, but I'm only giving it to my friends so haha if you're not my friend, hah... ok I'll stop before I hurt somebody with my horrible comedic skills. ANYWAY... oh my gosh I can't get over how cool this new blog is! Amanda, I am so0o0o0o making a dedication page for you soon, lol. Hm... not too sure what else to write about now... oh I know!!! As most of you guys probably already know, I'm in ballet and have been for the past, like, 11 1/2 years. Anywho, I'm going to a ballet intensive in San Marcos from the 21st to the 26th. I'm happy about it though, because two of my friends will be there with me, Michelle and Emi. What I'm the most scared of though is that everyone from New West ballet (the school who is hosting the program) will be all like "perfect ballerinas," while I will be just standing in the back of the room stupified by my own uncoordinated, uh, dancing... hey now, I just made an oxymoron!!! Oh those are fun... ok new one, Jumbo Shrimp, hehe, hm, Stupid Genious, ha HAH, oh here's a good one... Microsoft Works. That's a keeper... ok I think I'm gonna go now... I <3 EVERYONE!!!

      hola folks! amy nicole says i should blog more often, so im gonna humor her... lol. anyway, yesterday was a great day. i went down to city ballet and auditioned for their summer intensive, and yes, i got in!!! i think she's happier than i am. so anyway, i finally got to meet the amazing tim, and i must admit, he is just as amazing as amy says he is.. *sigh* after class, amy, alina, tim and i went went to this restaurant (i forgot what its called) and just had a good 'ol time. after lunch, tim went home and we (now amy, alina, and i) went back to the studio because they had rehearsal. so i just basically sat on the bench in the studio and watched everyone go over the same dance over and over again. we ended up leaving at about 4:30, and for some reason, whenever im in amy's car coming back from city, i always go crazy... like that one time with the jamba juice.. ohh lorday. well, i gotta go. TE AMO!!! ohh yeah, i probably ought to tell you about the wizard of oz... it was good. =P

      have you ever had one of those really deep, insane moments?? well, i had one today. i had a great day at school, you know, a fun and happy day. then my mom came and got me at school and said she had a headache (thats never good). so we get home, and she says shes gonna go lay down to see if she gets better and i decide to watch this movie called matchstick men. great great movie, go rent it and see for yourself. anyway, after i watched it, i went in my room and kinda let my brain go... just didnt think about anything, then something clicked. i cant even describe it, i started to think about all the mistakes i've made in my life, how i could have done the right thing instead of the wrong one, and also what a bad person i am. if you know me then you're probably thinking right now, amy's not a bad person, but i dont know, you're intitled to your opinion. i also started thinking about all the guys that i thought i liked but turned out to be jerks, and all the guys that i didnt like but liked me, and i just let them go. aahh maybe im just going crazy or something, but i had to get all that out somewhere or else id prolly turn into one of those sullen teenagers that everyone hates. ok, if you guys get anything that i just wrote in here and are nice enough to be sympathetic, talk to me... i need it

        You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent.

      hey nonny nonny.. well, today and yesterday totally sucked, cause i got sick and couldnt go to adri's party (even though you kim may think it was a diff reason that i didnt come, thats not true.. no worries) but its ok though because the sadness was balanced out by the happiness of me getting into cheer! lol, we got kidnapped my miss braden and got stuff written on our faces and they drove us to the mall and made us do our cheer infront of the movie theatre.. it was hilarious.. go lions.. but the only thing that is bad is that adri couldnt do it because she got sick and had to miss a practice. but kim got in so hey, its okay. ohhmahga.. i talked to chuck (if you dont know who chuck is then you're a complete loser to the xtreeeem!! jk) hes so nice. i thought he was gonna be one of those mean jock i-dont-care-about-anyone-but-myself kinda guys, but hes totally opposite. he writes this deep stuff, which makes me kinda scared for him.. he always says how he wants to get away and just not deal with everything anymore. well if he needs to be happy then he can talk to me and ill be all like, "chuck, you're beautiful!" .. maybe then he'll brighten up :-) anyway, i'd better go because i can tell that this post is getting pretty boring, so yeah... love ya all... peace easy

      amy nicole invited me to go see a ballet on sunday. it was really good. tim was in it. he looked really white. anyway, remember the thing i was totally dreading that i was gonna have to tell her? well i told her. she doesnt hate me.. at least, i dont think she does. well, i am officially depressed. morayma and i both dont know what to do about red and blue (fyi people who are out of the loop, red and blue are two guys at school who are incredibly hott and we dont want anyone to know what we're talking about so we use colors, k?). lol, its sad, because both of them like other people, so that like totally marks them off the list of future boyfriends. but actually, im not sure who blue likes, but i highly doubt it's me because morayma said he told brittany a long time ago.. but, it could happen, right?? well i gots to be goin, this average everyday sane psycho supergoddess does have a life!! peace easy

      my impossibilities haunt me.. i made that up. pretty deep huh? but that pretty much sums up what im feeling right now. ive been thinking about what all i cant do, like what ill never be able to accoplish no matter how hard i try. im in a slight depression mode too right now, because i had to choose between cheer and ballet. i figured, if im good enough to make it on the cheer team with no experience, then i must be kinda good, right? so i ended up deciding to go with cheer. its gonna be a big change, but i think im ready. im already feeling the impact this is making. this afternoon i was just sitting on my bed, not knowing what to do (cause i like never have free time). so my mom comes in and says to me, you miss it huh? she didnt need to say anything else, that kept my brain busy for quite some time. so after that i organized a few things. and that was it. pretty sucky day. i dont know how many of yall who are reading this are gonna get what im gonna talk about right now, so just bear with me. k. i dont know what to do about blue or hehehaha or green. no wait, green = stupid, right? so then im cool. gosh you know i feel so stupid and, i dont know, young after what happened to sarah this weekend. when will it happen to me?? im finding a bit of comfort in some of my friends, but it really isnt gonna help me much in the longrun. i just wish that i knew what to do. like i had a schedual of my life infront of me. no guesswork needed. so anyway im done complaining about myself.

      hey my people, whats the hap? wow, theres this huge fire behind my house in the orange groves, theres ash in our pool and everything. scaryyyy dudeness! so anyway, i dont really have anything to talk about on here.. oh wait, i lied =P you know sometimes i just hate guys.. the way they act, how immature they are (yes, even the nice ones) and how i just dont get them. i realize that its the guys who say they dont get girls but hey, guys are just as complicated as us. alright.. lemme vent. theres this guy, um, zac*, and hes gorgeous.. seriously.. but i dont know what to do. ive liked him since the beginning of this year, but the biggest problem is that one of my bestest friends ever likes him too. or at least i think she does.. the point is that i act stupid around him, like im some dumbo blonde freak (no offense blondies ;-P) ive gotten to know him over this year but now that im starting to actually talk to him and get close, as in like sitting near him, i lose my brain.. ok now my other problem is that i like another guy too.. his name's bob*, and all the girls at school think hes mondo hott to the highest degree of hottness. hes a football player, and as all yall prolly know im a cheerleader now too, so my friends are like, "ohh thats so cute, football player and cheerleader" and i just think to myself, shut up you fools that isnt why i like him. cause you see, hes a great guy, hes easy to talk to, hes smart, hes got nice features, and he lets you braid his hair (myma you know what im talking about!) so anyway if you have any advice for poor little me, dont be afraid to say something, cause at the moment, i need it. guess ill talk to all yall lata, peace..  *names have been changed to protect, um, me!

      hi people. i have a new favorite song. its "on the egde of seventeen" by stevie nicks. i never imagined that i would like a song that my mother likes but hey, thats what keeps life interesting. its really strange though because if you arent an idiot you'll realize quickly (that is if you know me) why i adore this song. its so crazy... *pondering*... anyway, it fits just right in this point of my life. i really need to get a tan. all the girls on cheer are all bronzed and beautiful and im all whited and non-beautiful. what i dont get is that i lay out all the time but i still cant get tan. even when i dont wear sunscreen and put on all that carrot milk acceleration whatever crap i cannot get tan. i seriously think its a physical abnormality. lordy. and self tanners turn me a nice shade of orange-yellow, which accents quite nice with my bathing suit. alright enough complaining. today was a good day. im gonna get a pedicure tomorrow. oh and we have late practice so i kinda get to sleep in. kinda. not really. ok im gonna go do something else besides sit here. good byebye

      hey everyone. today went really slow. well, the majority of today went slow. its only like 330.. anyway, im kinda glad i didnt have cheer today. it was nice to rest and not get up so early. but since i didnt have cheer today, this brings me back to the first statement i made- today went really slow. i really want a bf. or just a guy to like. as in, really liking. not just the stupid teenage, "omg hes so cute" kinda thing. there are like no guys at LCS worth liking. oh mylanta. did you know that xmas is 6 months from today?? i did. tuesday was my half bday. it was, um, fun (?). ahhh im so bored. someone save me from my insanity. i watched terminator 3 today. it was prolly the worst movie ive ever seen. the ending was horrible. i am advising every normal person out there not to watch that movie. ADVISE! ok. i wish i knew alex's sn or phone number or something. omg hes so cute. lol. see if you were paying attention you would realize why thats funny. you dont get it do you? ill leave you with your thoughts.

      hola folks.. its about 1:15. yup. i just had my first "official" cheer practice. oh mylanta. we practiced in the blue room today because the grass around the stage was wet. all the football players were done with practice and they started coming in and making fun of us. and i could see right into the gym and they were all smiling and mocking us. boys.. they are so strange. but seriously though, just this week that we've had off of school, its made all the guys much cuter. i dont know why. like alex, for example, i dont really like hes bleached hair. i mean its not hideous, but its a bit unnatural. anyway, today when he came in the blue room (he came in like 5 times) and i saw him, he looked so different.. and cute. if adrianna ever reads this she'll prolly flip out. but i dont care. after what all shes said about me and what sydney's said she deserves it. HAH!! its not like she ever has a chance with him anyway. shes like, "admired him from a far" for like a century. the girl wont even speak to him. lordy. ok so, whats new with you?? oh yeah? thats great!! i love that kind. ... ... so yeah i think im gonna go listen to some a' that grand ol' FRANZ FERDINAND musica!!! byebye

      hey yall.. sorry i havent updated for awhile. anyway, school got out on friday, and there was a party at ryan's house. this band called the knives were there. they were actually really good. im not really into the whole hard rock-ish kinda deal but the band made the genre not so, abrasive, i guess. did i spell that right? oh well. i went with kim. i mean, i love her to death but she didnt seem like she was having a good time. we left at like 10. i wanted to stay longer but i didnt say anything. she was supposed to call me this week for me to spend the night at her house before cheer starts. she hasnt called. shes prolly with adri and sydney. yall dont need to know the whole story but its really bad. adri and syd have been hiding stuff from me since sydney came into the stupid group. kim said she didnt want to be as close to them now, but shes obviously not living up to her word. i miss school. i miss everyone. i even miss the people i dont know. just seeing all their faces makes me feel happy somehow. im really gonna miss the seniors. that was a great bunch of kids. i didnt go to graduation. i was gonna go with kim, but i couldnt after all. she ended up sitting with adri and sydney (no surprise there). i better go, i think im getting carpul tunnel syndrome or whatever its called.

      i just watched a walk to remember. i figured i needed a good cry, so i watched that. i dont know why, but for some reason that darn movie just makes me melt. i want a sweet b/f like shane west. its a lot later than i thought it was. its like 1015.. i thought it was like 8.. wow. ok anyway, craig invited me to go to his graduation and a little "get together" (hah) at his house after. craig is so nice. i miss him. i havent seen him since the st. patricks day party. lol, he went a little loco then. ok heres the story. my parents and their lame friends were out in the garage listening to old music, and craig and i were on the couch just talking. so then my mom comes in and is like, "ooh i thought we could use a little bailey's." if you dont know, bailey's is pretty potent. its like melted ice cream and whiskey. i think its gross. so then after my mom went back out in the garage, craig goes and drinks some. i was just like, that stuff will hit you harder than you think. so after about half an hour, he starts acting stupid. im not gonna tell yall what he said because, well because. and then he practically falls asleep in my lap. then i made him go home. but whenever hes not under the influence of irish whiskey hes prolly the best guy i know. im gonna go see harry potter tomorrow with my daddy. i love him. i swear i havent talked to him for like a year. but its not like you have can have an involved convo at the movies. oh well. i still wanna see the movie. ok im gonna go to sleep i think. good nighty night.

      hey everyone.. im sad that school is almost over. its fun being a little stupid freshman. what is fun about being a sophomore? i mean even the name isnt fun. know what makes me mad, is that on degrassi sean's new g/f is named amy.. i just think thats wrong. im not like that. gosh. we had to clean out our lockers today at school. there was so much crap in there it like filled up a big trash can. but on the bright side i found all my missing spanish vocabs. ehh, i dont care anymore. i just want school to be done with so i can get away. all im doing this summer is going to cheer practice in the mornings and going to the beach and mall and yeah. my sunburn has finally turned into a tan. i thought i got rid of my farmer tan but adri was all rude and was like, nope its still there. i swear that girl hates me. im being completely random arent i? sorry. i kinda just wanna put in writing all the stuff my brain is thinking up. im like typing the first thing that comes to mind. ooh thats fun. cabbage. mustard. flowers. shoes. paperclips. lampshade. cd. scissors. did i spell that right? anyway.. oh, to everyone out there, if you know who SMOKIN A DOOBIEE is, please tell me. he/she is really mean and keeps IMing me for no reason. he/she wont tell me who they are. i dont even know how he/she got my screenname. i like switchfoot. im gonna go listen to them. melancholy.. how do you spell that? ok bye

          hola everyone... this whole colored font thing is throwing me off and i dont know what colors will go with what i have on my blog. ok anyway, cheer was h-e-double hockey sticks yesterday... coach braden was in a really bad mood. wanna hear what happened?? k ill tell ya.. we were stunting and marissa was up in a full (if you dont know what it is, trust me, its hard to do) and we were all really tired so we kept pushing it to keep her up and her knees didnt lock out and she fell back on me, so i didnt really have much time to react and i kinda like ducked forward and that was stupid because she hit my head and my back while she was coming down. it hurt us both but no one seemed to care i was in pain so she made us do it again. and then today mrs. pahl came.. ohhhhhhh boy howdy was she insane. for some reason a few girls decided that a goal of ours is gonna be to have back handsprings by football. and thats a wonderful goal to strive for, but people like me cant even start to strive whatsoever cause im so dang tall... we were doing drills today, where we go into a handstand and do a push up and i was all freakin out cause ive never done a handstand before, so i got into the stand, but i couldnt do the push up and i fell and mrs. pahl just turned away... lol, i think it made her a bit discouraged. and then we had to do like a million bridges which arent that bad but we just have to hold still until either coach or mrs. pahl came to pull and stretch our shoulders out. it felt so good.. my arms felt all floaty after, lol. and then when i got home i practiced some more and i can get to where im in a bridge and i can hold one leg up, so i guess thats progress... anyway.. goshlee im being so self centered, how was your day?? oh thats awesome i love doing that. lets go to tha mallll!!!!!!! woop woop! im really hyper.. im sore too. owie zowie wowie!!!! i cant wait till cheer camp. well actually i can prolly live without going but i just wanna get summer over with so school can start back and we can go cheer at games! yayayaya! everyone come to the home games! yay! our uniforms are so cute. i absolutely adore them. ok i needta go clean my room up a little cause its pretty gross.. but my closet isnt cause i cleaned it out last week! its so prettyful.. k talk to ya'll later.. JET'AIME!!!!

      hey all. howre yall doin this fine july day?? it was really hot today. at cheer everyone was like exhausted from the heat. lol, its funny though, cause im only sunburned on the backs of my legs because we have our backs to the sun all morning. goodness me. im so excited for the all star game saturday. we're staying at the riviera in palm springs, and its supposed to be really nice. i looked it up on the computer and saw some pictures and it looks like a pretty upscale place. its great cause the people sponsoring the game are paying for all our expenses, so that means we only need money for food. rory's moms driving us. their car is so cool. its black with pink flames on the sides. may i just throw in a shnazzy??? ok anyway.. i have bad but i guess good news too. as of last night, chuck and alex are going out. chuck wrote her this long sweet song and they went to the movies and its so cute. lol, the whole time she was talking about it i thought she said another guys name so i was like, "ew alex hes so mean" and now she prolly thinks im snobby. but oh well. i still dont think he knows i like him. alex doesnt thankfully. but hey its not like im any competition to her, shes just the sweetest thing that ever walked the planet. so i guess its good news then, right? hmm, hes prolly too old for me anyway ;) oh mylanta ryan and loic were just like staring at us all through practice. it was creepy. they were standing near ryan's car just in their own little world for like the last half hour of practice. goshlee boys are weird. oh oh our uniforms came in today!! coach braden is gonna bring some of them to practice tomorrow so we can see what they look like. it stinks though cause i wish we could wear all our new stuff to the all star game instead of last year's people's stuff. im wearing kelly's uniform. it fits ok i guess.. if the pleats are supposed to bust out and everything. but i was talking to alex and she said that they all do that, so that made me feel a little better. but i wear a shell size two up from kelly, so its a bit of a problem.. i can move, but i cant breath that well. but hey its ok. cause i only have to wear it in public once! woop woop ok im done typing. byebye!!

      happy july everyone. wooooooohoo. ok. so yeah. im kinda boring right now, so this post may not be the most exciting one ever but i have nothing better to do so there. this summer really sucks. i like havent even gone to the beach yet. all ive been doing is going to cheer practice in the mornings and then sometimes (emphasis on the sometimes) i go to the mall... but thats not as wonderful as it used to be. im kinda beginning to miss ballet. its strange though, because ill be thinking about it and realizing how much i love it, but then all the bad stuff thats happened comes into view.. and it overpowers the good stuff. cheer is really fun though. God i hate myself for thinking that my life is so horrible when there are all those other people in the world who havent even gone to a school, or a doctor, or all that stuff i take for granted. i want all you folks out there to enjoy everything in your life, and appreciate it to the fullest because theres no tellin when its all gonna go away. whew, got a little too deep there for my teenage stupid brain to comprehend.. but i guess thats not a bad thing then, right?
