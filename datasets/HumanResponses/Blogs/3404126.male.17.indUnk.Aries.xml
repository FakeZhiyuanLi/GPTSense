      I've come to some recent conclusions about my life that make me kind of sad.  There have really only been two girls I've ever thought about asking out on a date, but through my hesitation, I've lost my opportunities for such actions.  In both cases, my losses of chance have been due to their status change from single to unavailable, shall we say.  I can't win this battle.  One might suggest that I should try to snake either of the girls away from the respective boyfriends using superior intelligence, height, or funniness, or something like that.  All of those options are out of the question; the one girl who went to GACS graduated this year, she'll be goin to Presbyterian next year, her boyfriend is funny as hell, 6'5", and captain of the varsity basketball team at GACS.  Outsmarting him could happen, but only if I wanted serious physical abuse from him and his team of rapists.  The other girl goes to school with me, she'll be a senior with me next year.  This case is tougher than the other because in the latter scenario, her and her boyfriend will at least be separated.  This one doesn't work like that since he also goes to school with her.  Size doesn't work, he's just as tall as me.  Hes at least as smart as  me, but chances are that he could have his way with me in a battle of wits.  He's kinda serious, but tells some really good jokes when he does let out the funny.  The primary problem with the second case is that this boyfriend isn't just some fool I don't know.  He's a pretty good friend, and it's just not cool to split up friends' relationships.  It's also a classic case of basic competition and PR.  Either I steal the girl, say fuck the other guy, lose a friend, and potentially develop a reputation for backstabbing, or I leave it alone, keep everyone else happy, and torture myself with having to watch from a distance the girl that I long for.  Fuckin a.   On the brighter side,  urlLink read this  if you want a laugh.

      I've decided what going to happen after high school.  I'm going straight to Georgia Tech where I'm dual majoring in either nuclear or aerospace engineering and business.  From there, a job opening will immediately find me and I'll live in some huge city;  NYC, LA, Tokyo, a place like that. (EDIT: I've found an even better city, Monte Carlo)  The night life will rock serious ass.  I'll have a bunch of cars, namely  urlLink this one  for my various racing needs and  urlLink this one  for my crazy parties!  It's all gonna work out because all my high school and college friends will live in the same city and we'll party al of the time, because each of us made some breakthrough discovery or invention that made them TONS of money.    My breakthrough/invention is to design a compact fusion reactor that generates such ridiculous amounts of power for its size and the amount of fuel that is uses that nearly everything will run off of one in some form or another.  Perfect for the environment, it uses the air from the atmosphere to form a fission/fusion chain reaction with no waste given off except some hydrogen and oxygen.  Whee, no waste!  By the time we're all settled into our kick-ass lives, the government will have worked itself out into some conglomerate of the good sides of the republican and democrat ideals and everybody will be happy.  I had to cut all of my grass today. :(  It definitely sucks to hafta cut 3 acres of knee-high weeds and such.  It took at least 2 hours to finish it, trimming and all.  Whatever, its a workout.  Good times.  -KC

      I had a good day today.  I woke up around noon, then went for a bike ride down to North Point Mall, where I filled out applications for Circuit City and Best Buy, the best stores ever.  On the way back I stopped at the Y, it always feels great to work out midday.  To make up for my working out, I sat around my TV and played GT3 on my PS2 for about two hours.  Around 7 o clock I went to go see Shrek 2, which rocked.  Definitely on par with the  first movie, it had a lot more of the subtle gags than the slapstick comedy, which is a good change of pace.  The end was one of the best parts.  I don't wanna spoil anything, but there's a pretty long action/rescue sequence at the end, and all throughout it, the background music is some high octane DDR-esque classical remix.  Pretty tight.  I didn't have any profound thoughts today cause I didn't really have time to sit around and waste thinking about meaningless things.  Summer's stepping up, it would seem.  -KC

      What a blast I had at John's house yesterday!  We sat around and watched Pulp Fiction, Lost in Translation, and a bunch of japanese ninja and kung fu movies, cause they rock.  I've come to the conclusion that Pulp Fiction is one of the coolest movies ever made;  if you haven't seen it, first, slap yourself silly, then go watch it.  It's the darkest humor I've seen inna while, and it was tons of fun to watch.  So much fun in fact that it may have made it onto my top ten list of greatest movies ever.  And thats pretty great.  I just came home from GACS's graduation ceremony a few minutes ago.  I think it made me 15 years older and ten years stupider, if that makes any sense.  in any case, it was boring as hell, all solemn and stuff, no fun.  The principal of GACS is such a hypocrite.  At the beginning of his speech, he said something about his dad telling him that the key to a good speech was to keep it short and to the point.  He COMPLETELY ignored this little tidbit of goodness, seeing that his speech was 27 minutes long. >:\ Bein there really makes me appreciate Milton's kick ASS graduations and how amazing mine is going to be next year.  And it better be amazing, otherwise I'll have a bone to pick with fate.  On the way home from the graduation thing,  I had to drive through this impoverished area with all those checks for cash places and stuff.  It made me think about where humanity is headed: right down the shitter.  I think we hit the high point in our existence around the time of ancient Rome.  Since then its all been downhill.  All our technological advancements, as epic and amazing as they may be, come at huge prices, whether it be in human lives or the enviroment or somethin.  I think theres a big, fat, ugly war on the horizon, and its gonna mess up the world.  Think about a compilation of all those post-apocalypse movies- mad max, the postman, etc.- the world is turned into a virtual wasteland, with vast, industrialized behemoths of cities holding tens, maybe even hundreds of millions of people... I dunno.  Its just kinda freaky to just picture these things in your head.  Whatever, I'm f'ed up. -KC

      I didn't make a post yesterday, many sorries, but I don't think you guys could either if you got home when I did; around 1:30.  It was crazy.  I headed over to my friend's house for his birthday, and we went out to miniature golf around 3, then hung at the mall for a while, then chilled at Startime.  I've got mixed feelings about summer so far.  Its really great being able to work more and make some more cash than usual, able to work out every day consistently, and being able to take naps anytime you want.  Vacations are also easier to schedule during the summer.  However, even though school has unpaid work to do, you get to hang with friends every day, experience the dramas of fellow classmates, and theres always something to do, it would seem.  Thoughts? -KC

      mmm...another one of those sleep days.  It was my last slow day this week cause I've got a huge schedule planned.  Heres how its all gonna work out:  tommorrow, at 3, I'm going to my friends house for his birthday, starting with his house then to a movie;  tuesday, me and a bunch of guys I know from the YMCA (theres that Y again) are getting groups together for a big tournament in the morning.  It'll probably end around 12, then me and 4 others will head down to the mall to grab lunch;  wednesday I'll run to my friend John's house, where we'll watch movies and stuff for HOURS on end! What fun! Thursday I'm goin out to see Shrek 2.    I've decided to let you guys in on a funny word today: gooch.  In the eyes of urbandictionary.com, it means "Inch wide landing strip composed of numerous pubes. Location: between your beanbag and chocolate starfish."  I heard it at work today and as you can see, I work with a clean bunch. Not much else to talk about...  -KC

      Today was a lazy day, with a bit of exercise and spring cleaning sprinkled in.  I did get another good game of basketball goin at the YMCA, but it kinda ended on a bad note.  About halfway through the game, I was guarding this dude in the corner 3 point range, and he tried to step around me and get a chest pass into the paint.  This guy was in college for sure, and wasn't weak.  I lashed out at the ball with an open palm but accidentally rotated my hand so that I got my thumb COMPLETELY smushed.  It made me really sad cause that was my shooting thumb too, so any jumper outside of 5 feet was a complete miss.  Its pretty swelled up now, looks like I may have broken it;  completely black and blue from the bottom of my palm to the tip of my thumb, its also 3 times the size of my other one...bad times. :(  On another note, I had another random thought today!  I was changing the sheets on my bed when i got to thinking.  I always take a shower before i goto bed, and thats the only time I'm in it.  When i step out of the shower, I'm the cleanest thing in my house, so every time I goto bed, shouldn't my bed be getting cleaner, so I wouldn't hafta change sheets or whatnot?   Meh.  -KC

      Ah, finally, the end of school.  Three juicy months of summer dead ahead, waiting to be wasted.  I'll be a senior next year, yay!  I'm completely exhausted after today;  Right after school, me and a bunch of friends headed over to Famous Dave's BBQ for lunch (which by the way, fed me some of the best wings I've ever had, I recommend that place to everyone), then dropped by our respective houses to pick up some work-out clothes, and played basketball at the Y.  I love playing there, especially when all the black dudes from last year's team from Milton are there.  Every once in a while its nice to play people as good or not quite as good as you because then, you dominate.  However, I lean towards goin against the older and more experienced players, as its the best way to improve, in my opinion.  I learned something kinda cool today.  You know the phrase "cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey"? Well, that idiom originated in the Civil War when ships would carry iron cannonballs as ammunition, but they would always roll around the deck on the high seas.  Sailors devised a way to keep them in place by stacking them in a pyramid and putting a frame around the bottom layer, called the "monkey".  These frames were generally made out of brass, and unfortunately contracted in very low temperatures, making the balls roll right out, hence "cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey."  I guess you learn somethin new everyday, huh?  Those thats have gone to school with me this year probably know that the senior trip next year is to Mexico, but I think it would be alot more fun to go somewhere else.  My vote would be Barcelona, if money permits.  We should start a movement for that...  -KC

        Here we go, the first post.  Today was the second day of finals for me in high school;  I was supposed to take both a calculus and a literature final, though only the latter was administered.  More time for me to gamble on HoldEm in math! :D  I'm happy with the way I've played it these last few days, seeing that I'm up 15 bucks.     As some of you reading these may know, I plan to goto college and study some form of engineering, nuclear physics, or quantum mechanics.  I like to think about stuff like M-Theory, time travel, and various things as they approach infinity.  I was lookin at the stars tonight, thinking about the misconception that alot of people have about the size of the universe.  "The universe is infinite, everybody knows that," i hear people say.     If the universe was indeed infinite, then at any given time and place, you could point into the sky and you would be looking at a star.  Though that star might be giving off an infinitely small ray of light pointed at you, all the other infinite amount of stars in the sky would make up for the lack of intensity of each beam.  Then night would be the same as day;  always bright.  Hmm...tis' an interesting thing                                                                             -KC

      I'm so happy...yesterday my dad and I went to go pick up his BMW from the shop.  He had to get the brakes redone, a few hoses replaced, and the port polished.  The tune-up the he did raised the cars horsepower from 292 to only 325, but considering the fact the the car has a V12 in it, it makes the car a beast.  My dad's crazy driving put a few dings and dents in the car, so after we picked up the car,  I  got to drive it over to the bodyshop! :D The speedometer on my car only goes up to 120;  the BMW's goes up to 175!!  Definitely an awesome experience.  My dad says that after he gets the outside fixed, hes gonna get it repainted and have all the leather reupholstered and the inside professionally cleaned.  Then, theres a good chance that he'll give it to me, which would rock serious ass.  -KC

      I love comedy.  Whether it be stand-up, improv, people doing stupid things, anything that makes me laugh rocks.  A few nights ago I went to this little play downtown called "Help!"  Basically, it was a parody of all those Dr. Phil shows and stuff like that.  In their own words:    "Modeled after Tony Robins and the entire cannon of "why your life sucks" literature, HELP provides a comical chemical peel for the soul, shock therapy for the heart and an enema for the mind. The Out of Hand Life Coaches help you through all your problems at the wildest personal enhancement seminar you've ever attended."  It was awesome;  the actors were really enthusiastic, there was audience participation, and there was even some political goodness in there (i.e. Bush-Bashing).  Even you hardcore Republicans and Libertarians would find it funny because come on, even you guys know that this whole Iraq thing is getting old.  As far as stand-up goes, it is BY FAR the funniest type of comedy.  Hearing funny people makes jokes out of the things in life that piss you off is amazing.  One of my new favorite comics is Dane Cook.  Listen to some clips at  urlLink www.danecook.com  if you haven't seen him on TV, he's hilarious.  I had a good scare yesterday in the car.  I was driving a buddy of mine from Famous Dave's to another guy's house and took Southlake Drive through Windward.  For those of you who don't know that road, Its a hilly, winding, somewhat narrow neighborhood road.  Almost nobody takes that road, so you can glide into the other lane, doubling the width of the road and allowing you to go much faster.  I don't know why, but I felt like really hauling ass down the road.  It was, of course, raining as well, so my drive was made that much safer.    Off of a stop sign, I floor it going downhill, picking up speed faster that usual.  I hit sixty and decide, much to the shagrin (APUSH word! :D) of my passenger, that seventy is very possible.  I get to sixty-eight and realise that I had forgotten about the sharp turn right ahead of me.  I slam on the brakes and carve right as hard as I can while remaining in control of my car, but it starts fishtailing all over the place!  It was insane, cause there was a median AND an oncoming vehicle as this started.  My heart skipped about seven beats and I suppose that my buddy's did as well;  my blood pressure also doubled in an instant.  It took about 5-6 near-spinouts before I got it back together again.  I took the road at about 15 mph from there on.  Stupid, yes, scary as hell, yes, worth it?  My parents definitely won't find out about it and theres not even a nick on the paint, so yes, it was worth it, but I still won't be doing THAT again any time soon. O_o

      Howdy there, folks, its time for a post.  I dunno how many of you I've told or have heard about this guy John Titor.  Here's a brief synopsis of what's going on with this guy.  He started posting on some message boards and chatting in IRC rooms in 2000 under the name Timetravel_0 saying that he was, you guessed it, a time traveler.  A soldier coming from the year 2036, he was first sent back to 1975 to get an IBM 5100 computer to translate primitive computer languages like BASIC because apparently, all the computers in the world run on UNIX operating systems and UNIX has a timeout error in 2038.  John Titor makes all kinds of predictions in the time that he was online, such as a civil war in the US from 2004-2015, then Russia does a little nuke-launching action, starting a short World War 3.  He also makes predictions about Mad Cow Disease and the Patriot Act which almost justify his other predictions.  You should take the time out to read about this guy at  urlLink www.johntitor.com ;  it's pretty interesting.  You can form your own opinions on whether or not this guy is for real, but I'm gonna hafta go with a big NO for that.  John talks about worldlines and stuff, saying that theres a bunch of possibilities for the world to turn out.  In talking about this he outlines the multiverse theory, and if you couple the multiverse theory with history-changing time travel, you build an infinite loop that creates a paradox in and of itself.  It's a bit long to explain here, but if anybody really cares to hear it, IM me or somethin.  For all you over-zealous Christians out there, I'm gonna suggest a movie for you to see: Saved!  Ironically, I'l also suggest that movie to all those religiously devoid and doubting people out there.  It snaps hypocritical bible-thumpers out of their trance and provides entertainment for the others. The coolest people in the movie turn out to be the Christ-loving schooolgirl that gets pregnant and gets pissed at God, the Jewish girl who goes to the Catholic school, and the handicapped dude who isnt religious in the least that also attends the Catholic school.  Overall its a pretty funny movie, go see it.  Nothin else to talk about, -KC

      I know that I haven't posted in a while and I'm sorry.  My summer has been pretty uninteresting until this weekend, so I didn't feel any need to let the world know what's goin on.  I also apologize if I don't say anything amusing or profound this log, since it's 2 in the morning when I'm writing this.  I got up Saturday at around 12:30, mowed some of my grass, then got myself cleaned up.  at 2 I went to go see the new Harry Potter movie, which is very cool, by the way.  I barely made it to my friend Joe's Xbox party that he was havin at 5;  Halo with 15 people definitely kicks some major ass.  The highlight of that party though was my little cruise in the Bronze Stallion.  For those of you who don't know Crazy Jeff, I'm sorry, for you'll never experience the sense of power and rebellion that you feel when you enter his car.  Weighing in at too much for the car's size, the Bronze Stallion is a '93 pewter colored station wagon.  If you run your hand across that car's surface, you will encounter that it no longer has any flat surfaces on it.  In duct tape along the sides of the front driver and passenger doors are the words "Ace" and "Chumps", respectively.  The engine is a piece of work too; the engine block itself has been ON FIRE before, as in flames were engulfing the front of the hood.  To top all of this off, there is a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear view mirror.  In any case, at about 10:30 Crazy Jeff took me and 3 other guys out for a little spin in his pimpmobile.  He practiced peeling out at stoplights and pissing off neighborhoods by doing donuts in their cul-de-sacs.  I got home around 11:30 and watched Gladiator.  Sunday morning I woke up and did the same routine as the day before:  get up, mow grass, get cleaned up, go see Harry Potter again.  That night I was an hour late for work (Muahaha) for the second week in a row.  No worries though, because that job is gone after I seal the deal on this interview I have this Tuesday.  If all goes well this week, I'll have a new job and a license by this Friday!  Hooray!  I had somethin cool to say, but I've forgotten it.  I'll post again when I remember. -KC

      I now officially hate tax-free day.  For one thing, where we live, our county decided that they needed the taxes from tax-free day, so in reality only 4 out of the 7 percent was actually taken off. Furthermore, while you would think it would be worth it even to get out of that 4 percent, since there are SO MANY people out on tax-free day, it essentially doubles your time shopping; so unless you're planning on buying something _huge_, like a new computer or something, is a few measly dollars worth another few hours of being out?  On top of my what I think to be logical conclusions,  I hate tax-free day because where I work is FLOODED with customers.  They're like lemmings or something, just pouring into the restaurant and piling on top of each other without regard for their own safety.  I work at Chickfila, and today I was stationed in the food court in the mall.  This made me very sad.  From about 10:30 until when I left (which was scheduled to be 4 but I couldn't get out until 4:45) was perpetual lunch-rush-esque traffic.  Mixed in this throng of customers were the truly anal eaters.  This one lady, for example, ordered a large sweet tea during our busiest time.  I hauled ass over to the sweet tea container and poured out the very last of the vat before it had to be refilled.  She also requested a few lemons for it, which is understandable, so i fork out two lemons and head back to the register.  "Can you put another lemon in there?"  Lucky for me, there is a case of lemons sitting in the ice next to me.  I pick one up by the ends if the rinds a drop it in. "You touched that one,  I need a new glass of sweet tea."  Holy crap.  I almost blew up in her face.  Its the middle of lunch rush,  all of her FOOD is being touched by everyone in the back, and I don't have time for people being selectively picky like she is.  I have to dump the ENTIRE cup of sweet tea,  wasting both the last of the batch and 3 lemon slices.  Its ok though, because I got her back by putting 12 lemon slices into her new cup, allowing about 3/4 ounce of actual tea in her cup.  hehehehehehehe.  Still, for all who order from my register after reading this, don't do that.  I'll be forced to do something terrible.  There was one thing near the end of my shift that was kind of amusing, for a change of pace.  This kid who was about 12 years old came up to my friends register and asked if we gave out free sample and said something about giving us a penny for one fry.  After we rejected his  generous  offer, he asked us who we were going to vote for, either Kerry or Bush.  I stepped in and decided it was time to show the little man up.  I used big words like patronizing,  ipso facto, and regardless to throw him off.  I had a good time doing it, too.  About 3 minutes into this, he went off on a tangent about freedom of press and the degredation of the political stage.  I'm telling you, this kid had to have some seriously guts to be arguing with a guy who is 5 years older and 3 feet taller than him.   One of my die-hard republican co-workers said that he was gonna vote for Bush.  This kid took his attention right off of me and onto him where he pointed out that it was people like him that would kee the country alive.  At that point, I ceased arguing with this kid, cause I don't like talking to oblivious dumbasses who will ALWAYS vote republican, regardless of how well of how shitty the president perform.  Yar!  I hate tax-free day!  -KC

      Another uneventful day in this glorious summer.&nbsp; Since it looks like school is finally bearing&nbsp;down on us, I figured it was about time to start on those AP summer reading books and the calc packet.&nbsp;  Tuesdays with Morrie  was mos def a quick, easy read;&nbsp; I annotated the whole thing last night in bed.&nbsp; Its unfortunate that I've started this late in the game beacuse I really wanted to read  The Fountainhead , but there simply aren't enough hours in the day.&nbsp; It seems that my 4 books that I'm gonna read are gonna be these:&nbsp;  Tuesdays with Morrie ,  The Stranger , that dorian gray book, and then one more, maybe siddharta ( :( ).  I got those AP scores back recently.&nbsp; I didn't do too badly, I think, although my scores aren't what I expected.&nbsp; I got a 5 in both Physics and Calc, a 4 in Comp Sci, and a 3 in APUSH.&nbsp; I guess the college board didn't approve of my clown essay that I wrote for them in the USH exam.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I also thought that I would get a 5 in Comp Sci, not Physics.&nbsp; I was expecting Physics to be a 4.&nbsp;   I've wanted to modify my car for quite some time now, so today I sat down at my comp and researched exactly what products I wanted and exactly how much each of them costs.&nbsp; Much to my avail, the total cost comes to around $7, 000.&nbsp; Here a list of the parts a want (need): Sony CD/Mp3 Head unit, a 240-W amp, 2 front door Xplod speakers, 2 column Xplod speakers, Eibach Pro Lowering Kit, pre-painted Factory spoiler, SilverStar Halogen bulbs, Xenon Crusher body kit, Autotechnica Chrone shifter head, Saddleman Flames bucket seat cover (could be replaced with new racing seats), Edelbrock Performance headers, Whipple Supercharger, Plasma Booster Ignition chip, Heartthrob Performance dual exhaust system, and an Injen Air Intake system.&nbsp; Serious parts, heartbreaking cost.&nbsp;   That's life, -KC

      Not much going on these days...hangin with friends, playin videogames, running, and goin to see movies.  Speaking of movies, I saw King Arthur yesterday night.  Bunches of people didn't like the movie and its probably because it wasn't what they expected.  When somebody says King Arthur, you think Knights of the Round table, Camelot, etc, but thats not what the movie really is about.  Its more historically accurate and portrays not the existence of Camelot, but the last days of Arthur under the command of Rome and the FOUNDING of Camelot.  Either way, it wasn't a great movie. : Ready for a sick joke?  So theres this hiker climbing a mountain, and he gets to the top only to find a beautiful girl standing at the edge of a cliff, ready to jump off. "Wow, a jumper.  Hey, you wouldn't mind giving me a last blowjob before you dive, would'ja?"  says the hiker. "Sure, why the hell not, life sucks anyways.  I might as well too."  So she gives the guy a blowjob.  When she finishes up, the guy looks down at her. "Wow, that was great... uh, why  are  you killing yourself anyways?"  The woman replies, "My parents disowned me for dressing like a woman."  AAAHHHHH EEEEWWWWW! XD  Definitely a mighty disgusting joke.  Sorry about that. -KC
