      Poor me, i have to leave tomorrow, this monday, ohome tog ermany. itis a sad story though. i am worried the most about randi, but she has the most excellent friend in the world, so it willbe alright. i have good news also, randi is going to visit me in december for a month, so i'll fix up my place in germany and make it nice and fluffy for her ;). well, yesterday i had my goodbye party and everyone left at like ten, so i guess it wasn't pretty succesful, although my good firends stayed until 1 am, which could be amatter of the german candy i fed them until then. well i went to a lot of movies with randi and also with elizabeth. we three together had a fabulous experience in the movie theatre, discovering the cheapniss of a dollar movie ( it costs you really a dollar!!!!!). so i decided to be a gentleman and invite the girls to the movies ;). i am a cheapass, sorry inherited from lothar ( greetings to randi). well anyways, the movie seats were gross and all wet, jsut disgusting and in the middle of the movie a large group was seated in the cinema. we saw the glorious starsky and hutch andi have to say: DO IT! dollar movies are worth a dollar, you'll get an adventure! afterwards we went to cheddars, that was an awesome place. elizabth invited us to eat there. afterwars we went to a mountain and i scared the hell out of the ladies, which i will never do again becasue they got pissed off pretty bad ;). well, then we went home. it was a nice day. well today i went to see norebook with randi, and i have to say: no i am not gay, i saw it to make her happy. it was the cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life, it hurts my brain even thinking about it so go and see it and make fun of it, please!!!! besides, there were two ladies int heir late 50's that wouldn't shut up so i asked randi for permission to make them shut up, but she wouldn't allow me to yell at them! i hated those ladies. at the movies i got a chance to say goodbye to richard and manuel. well, theni hung ou with randi and got a present, a very generous present from her family and her dad called me "son". so i guess i am part of their family now too, which means i have now 4 families! yay go me!today was also a sad day, i got reminded of our glorious car back in germany: a NISSAN VANETTE! the best car int he world, it is blue/gray-metallic, has purple green pink sticker on the side, it's a van for 8 passanger, has a spoiler, 10 frontlights, no ac, 68 hp, is a diesel, trucks pass it on the autobahn and make fun of it, it got into three accidents which were all total, and i love it! night out there, au revoir!

So anyways that was abot it. it was pretty nice to hve randi waking up near me. well, we also had a lot of fun on her trmpoline today in the backyard, tanning and wettening each other with the waterhoe (?????). yeah then she drove me home and i ended up spending some time with jordan chatting about the party and her life and we watched a movie and i ate cookies and talked to her parents. one tihng is sure, her parents rule! well and i got the best news ever: RANDI WILL GET HER PLANETICKETS FOR GERMANY TOMORROW!!!! so she'll come on like the 13th of december!

      Alright, at first it is my baby's 18th birthday! HAPPY BIRTHDAY RANDI!!!!! WOOOHOOOOO. well alright, i guess i'll see her tomorrow, becasue we are supposed to be hanging out sinceher family jsut lefther alone for her birthday! Well, I got her nice presents and other stuff that i can't talk about right now, becasue she might be reading it ;). Well we will have an awesome time together! I am also planing a big surprise for her! Haha, it will be a nice birthday tho! Mhm so what have I een up to the last couple of days? All started with me picking Randi from the airport up, with ehr parents . Her dad suggested that i should spend the night, so he calle dmy hostparents and they were fine with it. She fell asleep like a rock and i watched her for a little bit and went to bed myself after watching for another hour tv. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to sleep in the same bed with her *tear*.The next day was spent with her also and i didn't dom uch either. I kinda got all the stuff ready for her birthday, but a main part of it good dome this night und this morning i will be still working ont he masterpiece :). Wish me good luck, I have never done something lie this before! I hope she'll like it! I also talked to my brother who is an exchange student up in maryland and he told me that his hostfamily kicked him out and so he has probably no chance of living there anymore. It came suprising for him, and he has to be packed til saturday and so he is calling up some friends to move in with them, OH yeah, being an exchange student is glorious, I got a nice nickname ( fez), which is pretty funny, since i love that 70's show! Also i cannot understand why iI am fez, since my accent is not as bad as fezes. Well even my mo sent Randi a birthday card :).It is already pretty late and i am not even tired, I jsut can't sleep. I was also running today and it was about a 95, but the humidity made it be like a 100, it was bad whether to run in ;). I also tried to get a tan sitting in the backyard, since my farmers tan is annoying me t death, but of course it doesn't work. It suckz to be me ;). Alright, I'll be going tobed soon, so goodnight!

      Well, I miss Randi! That's a long statement I know. It is jsut that I can't think of anything else right now! she is just my little tresure and I am sure you'll be rading this so: I love you honey :)! Alright, what happened in the last couple of days? Randi called me from europe and told me what all she got for me and no i feel super special and can't wait to get my " presents". She is jsut the best :). I went to a party at alex" house and it was pretty cool :). I don't feel too good today but that's alright! And i also could swear that a stranger was searching through my stuff at alex' party... but, i dunno, maybe I was the only persont hat saw someone... . Today i called Amana to find out what she is doing and she is hanging out with Michelle, so i made plans with David to play soccer and go to the movies maybe later. So i got to go now and change so i can play. Byebye!

      This was after all a good day! Yesterday i stayed on the computer to wait for my beloved Randi to get online, but she had difficulties in the hotel she was staying so she couldn't get online. But today she surprisingly called me and made my day much better! I look like shit today since I am wearing sweatpants and was packing all my stuff together :(. It made me very sad, I guess it is like moving out:(. I feel sad, it was hard work and there were so many things that mean so much to me that i had to pack away :(. And it feels like going away soon, which makes me even more sad, because i have to leave my lover ( Randi) for a long time :(. But her call made me happy again! Wooooohoooo Randi you rock my world :). Well, she also told me that she is going to be online( or better fixin' to be online). I'll expect her and tell her that i have a blogg now too ;). Alright. Adios!

      Well, today notihng happened besides that i woke up after watching the X-FILES last night. It was one of the worst episodes ever, with aliens that were fighting and smoking, very bad, but in a way funny, too! After luncht oday i went and played bowling which went bad, I only got 2 strikes. After that i played lazertag and realized that i am now too old for this, which made me sad, but i will have children, and they will have to play it. Since they are small they need a gardian that helps them ;). Right now i am waiting for Randi to get online. She is somewhee in Italy and promised me to get online since she can't call me becasue her calling card is crap. I also informed me on "how to become an american" and now i am quite confused. All becasue of 9/11. duh, stupid terrorists. Anyways, I am gonna wait and probably spend the rest of the day on the computer ;).

      weird, i never thought i would do this but, oh well it caught me too! stupid blogging. i guess Randi brought me into it.At the moment i am in Fort Worth and somehow i am bored, since i am doing nothing. A couple of days ago was my birthday and it was not really like a birthday but oh well, what can i do.Today i went to see MEANGIRLS again and of course it was glorious once again! I will probably end up watching it with Randi again, since our first trip to this movie was delightful! So that will be the third time for me seein the movie. I am excited. Tonight I might end up going to the mall but i don't know. We will see later, i am going now i guess, since i have nothing to write at all. It will be a very boring blogg, so don't make it official to be a reader ;). thanks, see you later. ( i only know one person that will read this anyways...). Au revoir!!! I miss ma Randi, she's over in Europe :(. I hope she'll call me!byebye, yes really, good bye now!

      yeah excactly, I am super boring as i have to assume by now. my girlfriend slept in on my bed jst a second ago, and so i decided to come up here to the computer and let her take a nap. so here i am. well, oh, well, tonight i wanted to go to düsseldorf to the carnival becasue i wanted to show randi the fireworks, but she doesnt seem to be excited at all. it seems like nothing i do for her is interesting for her, so i gave pretty much up on entertaining her. anyways, the is not much but drinking that you can do in wuppertal ( we have 9 breweries here). so thats all i ever do when i am bored. it is pretty nice to have someone all the time next to you that seems to be bored. i think i will give up on my blog anyways, this is bullshit, blogger are not very cool ppl. alias, barry cuba *hr hr hr*. well, not much happened, i went with randi to cologne, düsseldorf, dortmund, wuppertal, solingen and i think that was it. otherwise nothing happened. i was looking for a job, and my first choice to work at the gummybear factory for $10 was not free anymore. well i looked for jobs everywhere, but no one seems to have a job for me. i want to go back to the us and work at heb or walmart, hrhr america the country of the money! glorious. well nothing much is happening here, i am tired and tomorrow ill be in amsterdam chilling with randi, my brother and marco! adios!

      ...that's what a german says. alright, i am to lazy to write certain words with capitol letters so forget that.well. alright. Randi is here! that was like the biggest surprise in the world. She called me on the 6th and told me that she would be here on the 7th, so i told her to stop joking around, becasue it was like 6:30 in the morning for me and she called me while i was sleeping!so i went downstairs and told my parents that we need to pick her up in frankfurt the next day. so that's basically all that had happened so far since i got back.well on friday the 9th my brother got home( winks to d'resa and liz) and his hair looks horrible and almost makes me throw up ;). no, jsut kidding, imean the color it has sucks, but the length is alright, he jsut needs to go to the haircut place. well so on friday i went to a party with marco my brother and randi.randi got pretty drunk and so she danced around me all horny :). it was goooooood. lol. well i enjoyed it, hrhr. well then i decided, that randi had enough drinks and i had her beating me, so i gave her a last drink and made her go home with me, becasue she was defeniely too drunk. she complained about her walking in her boots, so itook of my shoes and gave them to her and took her boots and helped her home ( i know i'm a gentleman). well it was like a freakin 45 outside that late and it was wet on the ground, becasue it was raining and so i was freezing and my feet were numb.well the day after that was my parents wedding anniversarry and my parents got super drunk, i only had 6 beer, becasue i didnt feel like getting drun k with my parents. randi was ebjoying drinks talking to my mom... lol! well the next days we mainly went shopping in good old germany, and i am planing on taking randi to the haribo gummibear factory, the chocolate museum and the cathedrale in cologne + the castle in solingen. so stuffed plan here.well i am also looking for a nice guy for elizabeth, but as she knows there are not many in germany. well that's it for today, adios!

      well, yeah, i have no clue why, becasue i think it is a total waste of time. maybe this is the reason then? yes it is, i need to waste some time being too bored to watch tv. i would watch tv but german tv is with 36 chanels a little bit under developped.today i looked over my finances to go to austin next summer, and it actually looks good, i should have enough money in eleven month to get there and have money i can spend on stuff. so, i hopefully make it there. nah, i know i will. i wouldnt go there if it wasnt for my sweetheart, the only reason i actually have to get up my lazy butt. nothing much has happened in the last 2 weeks or what i havent been writting in here. i've been sick for almost a week now, but i am ok now. i still get a headache when i sit outside in our humangus backyard and try to tan. so i deceided to go up here and write a new entry. Randi is going of to school soon, and i am asking myself how and when i get to talk to her everyday, and if i even get tot alk to her everyday. she is planning to take a german class and i hope she'll do so, that would be great. the german soccer league started and my team lost for like no reason, they were better then the other team but they did not use their chances. very disappointing. Randi has been gone for more then a week now and i miss her a lot. i can't really sleep at night without her, and so i stay up really late. that is not too good, but i can't change it. otherwise i am not hearing a lot from my other american friends, if they were evn friends. i still dont know about that. it seems like americans dont care as much about their friends as germans do. maybe i am wrong with that, but for me it seems to be right.Randi is visiting me in 4 month and 4 days from now, and i can't wait until that date. I still dont know what i can do with her, becasue we did like everythig when she stayed here a week ago, but i will find something. wow, this is getting a pretty long entry. i also decided to quit soccer, becasue i dont see a future for me here. soccer in the U.S. was much easier becasue i was like the best player on my team and got to play midcenter, it was also a lot more fun and not as full of emotions and pressure as it is over here. you also have not that many practices over there in the U.S. . so i might want to start a track and field career, since i want my body to be a little bit delicious for Randi. Being sick by 90 all the time is bullshit, since no houses in germany have an ac. well i guess that was it about me, i have nothing more to say, at least i think so. yeah, i am jsut really bored. no worries, i write a lot when i am bored. i dont know where to start my track career, and if i am really going to do that. arg, ok i qit now, i am too lazy to write more! adios! haha thats so great, nobody reads my block anyways, so why am i even writting in here? nah, whatever! good bye!
