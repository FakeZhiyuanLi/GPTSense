      Yeah, so I'm a dork, but hey, I think it's interesting, so maybe you will too.  Today's topic... star formation. Basically stars form when a few particles of space dust get close enough to have gravitational attraction, and once they hook up together, they have a greater mass (because there are 2 now, not just 1 atom), so they attract more particles.  This continues until there is a huge mass of particles and gas being brought together by gravitational forces.  So, the gravity makes these particles get closer and closer together, which heats them up.  Eventually, they get hot enough that when they bump into eachother, you get fusion (when two protons smack together and stick), forming Helium.  So all of the energy made by the fusion pushes out, counteracting the gravitational force, creating a stable star size.  (If fusion is never accomplished, you get a "brown dwarf", this usually happens when the total mass is less than .08 times the mass of our sun)  Eventually, the core of the star runs out of Hydrogen atoms and is full of Helium atoms (produced by fusion of Hydrogen).  At this point, there is not enough energy produced in the core to counteract the gravitational forces, so the star begins to collapse.  The star will collapse until the electrons are being forced into the same space at the same time (Pauli Exclusion Principle) so you get electron degeneracy pressure pushing out, counteracting gravity again.  As the star contracts, the core heats up even more, to the point that the Helium can begin fusion.  Now the star is called a Red Giant.  Eventually, all of the Helium (like the Hydrogen before) will be used up, and contraction will begin again.  The carbon in the core (formed by Helium fusion) will be very compressed until it 'rebounds' and pushes away all of the outer envelope of gas, which becomes a planetary nebula.  At this point fusion in the core has stopped and it gradually cools, becoming a white dwarf, roughly the same size as the earth (but with a density of a ton/cm^3).  The really cool thing, is that were Jupiter two or three times it's current mass, it would have evolved into a star, and we would be in a double star system.  Which means that Jupiter is basically a brown dwarf, a star that never had enough mass for fusion.    And that was your lesson for the day... interesting, right?  (or not)

      My weekend has officially begun... Got out of class an hour early - wow!  But I hadn't realized that it was an hour, just thought it was 15 minutes or so, so went to go get lunch and got some strange looks from the lunch lady who asked why I was eating so early... Oh well.  This means I'll hopefully be inspired to find me a more healthful lunch at lunchtime instead of the chicken fingers and fries I was going to order.  Good stuff.  Spreaking of... I should find the Springs Whole Foods... that would make my fridge and belly happy.  Anyway.  And it turns out that my buddy from Spain was a mountain biker for 5 years, so he can definitely help me fix my bike.  Yay!  Now if only it will not rain...

      So... today in class we did some calculation to determine the probablilty of intelligent life in our galaxy.  A whole bunch of the numbers were fudged, but if you make some fairly reasonable assumptions, it all comes down to how long you think a intelligent, technologically advanced society, will last.  Ours, for example, has lasted since around 1940, or about 65 years (Technologically advanced = radiowave producing).  So, if you assume 100 years for the duration of a technologically advanced society, the equation spits out that there are 100 planets with technologically advanced societies right now in our galaxy (the number is the same as the number of years you assume).  The reason technologically advanced matters is that we can detect radiowaves, but don't really have any other way of knowing if there is life on a planet, hence SETI.  The reason we're not finding all of these civilizations is that they are absurdly spread out... space is just that... a whole lot of empty space.  Also interestingly... if you use much more pessimistic assumptions in the equation and decide that we are the only intelligent life in our galaxy, and that there are technologically advanced societies in 1 out of every 100 galaxies, you still end up with a whole lot of intelligent life in the universe.  Basically, we are not alone.  Speaking of intelligent life... I managed to put my bike back together after 2+ months in storage, and it works!  Well... nearly works.  The break pads on the rear wheel are too tight and rub, making riding significantly more of a workout.  So if anyone knows how to adjust that, input would be appreciated.    Went to the pool this afternoon and spent some time on the boards (second day in a row after 5 months off) and tried to reacclimate myself.  I had forgotten some of the random parts of my body that diving exercises... like the muscles in the bottom of my feet when I'm taking off backwards... who knew?  And I did something funky to my left lower back, but hopefully some Motrin and sleep will fix that by tomorrow.  I think I'm going to try to make it on the boards at least 4 times a week, and onto my bike (if I can fix the break) for exercise type rides most days (if it will stop raining).    But now, since my text book has arrived (thank you Amazon for overnight delivery), I have four days of reading and work to catch up on.  I think I'll crack open on of my Wildberry Jacks... but first, off to Walmart to pick up my film from Spain.  So much to do!  Hasta luego.

      Began my class today: Intro to Modern Cosmology. It will be easy, possibly painfully so, but easy, and another credit, and I won't be losing $900 in tuition. So, good. So tired.  need food and nap

      Starting a new blog... what will it be? Time will tell. In the mean time, check out "aerochic" on livejournal.com.  Hasta Luego

      Well, I'm not exactly sure what to do with this blog.   I've got my day-to-day blog chillin over at LiveJournal, and am not sure what I want this blog to be. If only I was creative or something, I'd post my creativity here.  Alas, I am not. So, I'll take any suggestions, from anyone, as I'd like not to leave this blog to wither away. (and class is done, so don't have much nerdy stuff to post)  hasta luego.
