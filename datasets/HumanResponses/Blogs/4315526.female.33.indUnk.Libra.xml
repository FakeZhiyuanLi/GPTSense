      I am so happy to have today off work.  By the time work  was over yesterday, I  felt emotionally spent. The women I work with  are such "bitches" well at least most of them. I was told how  yesterday morning I  was the main topic of  conversation on the  first floor, I  guess it  pisses  some people off because  I am paid  from the  moment I clock in, I guess they  don't  realize  that I  go right to work, I  dont  stand  around  for  10-15 minutes and gossip. I am pretty  quiet for the most part at work because I don't want to be a part of  the  junior high games  that  go on there, but  I  will say I   truely love my job and I refuse to let the  38-50 year old  crowd  ruin it  for me. I  do  have  one  very close  friend I work  with "Julie", we  have a deep connection, much deeper than anyone  there is  aware of,  we  can  talk about anything and even if we  don't  agree on something, thats  okay. I have shared many of my  life's secrets with her and she  doesnt judge me, it is so nice to have  a special friend like that!  Enough about my work life. Today I  took a vacation day because  I am  taking my children to register for  school. They will get their  schedules, order yearbooks, and get school pictures done. My  daughter is  especially  excited  because  she has  lost  55lbs and looks  terrific, that  along  with   getting contact lens's really has  boosted  her self esteem. Tonight I have to take her to  9th grade orientation and she  cant  wait to  see the  expressions of  peoples faces. My  son is kind of  excited about  going back to school, he anticipates  wrestling  season, and this will also  be the  first year since  middle  school he  will not participate in band.  Last night the hubs and  I  watched "Godsend" let me  tell you save  your  money!

      Well its back to work today, ugh! I had such a nice weekend, I really dont feel like putting in 12 hours today. We put the new awning up, painted the shed floor and installed a new security light, and still had time to watch a movie : Talking Lives.........a very scarey movie with alot of twists, needless to say I liked it.
