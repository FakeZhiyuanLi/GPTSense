      Darn.. it's 9am in the morning and no work for me today... part of me released a triumphant call "Yippeee, no work, more time for my 10K word assignments" part of me is like "damn I can sleep abit longer"   Well, shitty that this morning at God knows what hour the irritating kitty was "crying" in the backyard accompanied by the protest from the opposite neighbour's pooch... the Chinese thinks that when a cat cries at unearthly hour, it's a sign for the presence of spirits... Honestly, I shldn't have cared less..but another side of me was "shit, I muz try to get back to sleep so eerie" Indeed, I retire into dreamland... yet, I wished I hadn't cos I'd a dream of my dad fetching me and my kiddo bro from sch... we were very young then...   Oh yes, memories are made of this... dad will fetch us in the morning to school and after classes, he'll fetch the both of us hme.. Those were the days when the 3 of us were havin heaps of fun in the car tryin to figure out Acronyms for freeways and international organisations..I used to have dah kick of making me little bro look like an ass... hee hee since, I'm older I reckon I have accumulated more knowledge than him... Yah, dad will always tease us and formulate his own unique Singaporean acronyms like FOC = Free of Charge, PAP = Pay and Pay...   Mum never understands why I was close to dad, it is memories like this that makes me miss dad so much... I love my dad lots but if I ever see him again, I know how awkward it'll be.. it's like fancy seeing an old lover again... the uncomfortable silence of not knowing what to say... I have not idea where dad is and my dream has made me aware that even till now, how I wish he'll still dote on me and make me his favourite.. I miss my daddy and wonder at times if he misses me too or even us as a family....  Morning like this is hard to bear especially when the break of dawn draws on memories of the past... Love you daddy, can you hear me?

      Juz when I am offered a temporary job without applying for... I am here in Melbourne..damn! My ex-company asked if I am interested to go back and work for them temporary while one of the ladies going for maternity leave... it'll be great working at Macquarie again...  I'm kinda in lazy and hungry mode..juz wanna eat everything and anything... it's so bloody cold..Oh yah I did heaps of washing by hands and now I'm having a sore back... I'm feeling so lethargic now.. but tonite got great shows like Queer Eye and OC... Monday nites are the best...   I'll be heading off for camp soon... on Wed to Sat.. I know God is gonna do amazing things durin this camp...last nite I ask God "God, what's my calling and where will I be in the future?" I was very persistent in getting an ans..and was being a real irritant (urm my QT lasted for 2hr) then God ask me to be still... and listen... I saw myself in a corporate gear but then I was surrounded by kids... and they seem to be Cambodian or Laotian... I look like in one of those Worldvision ads... Then God said to me, "you'll be successful, you can tread on higher grounds" and that's that... I wonder "successful in worldly terms or in spiritual terms??" I'm confuse and I ask but then God juz said "Love my people"...I dunno what this means but I'm ready to move forward into the future based on His terms.... that's why I reckon this camp is gonna be awesome...  God is Mighty...

      Havn't gotten online for quite awhile..abt 2-3days.. this week has been really busy I was getting some of my research done after work so have been coming hme at 8-9pm at nite... after talking to Terence, I'll head to bed at 3am...   Last nite, got a call frm Jac...really worried for her..she crash her car into a tree..my goodness muz be real frightening.. she smash her face and was bleeding from her nose and mouth.. really worried for her...cos I don't know what I'll do if something worst happen... but praise God she is safe... I think a spiritual battle is going on for her.. cos of the Hindu medium...I have been praying for her ever since that nite she told me abt going to the medium with her cousin, Michelle...   Today, recieved another news of a distant fren from our secondary sch who had committed suicide... this is the second for the yr..life is so philmsy... I hate to hear such news.. it brings back memories that are especially depressing...it kinda pushes me back to where I was 6yrs ago..walking through a forest without any light leading my path, I do not know where I am going neither do I know if I am ever coming out of the forest... where is the start..where is the end... no one can tell me... I was so misunderstood, so alone... I wanted to juz fuck it all and end everything... looking back it's amazing how I can survive being alife.. maybe I am a coward, gutless to carry on the act and finish it...

      How lucky can I get.. running into the tram conductors twice in a day... but I paid for my tix so there's nothing to worry abt.. Church service was ok... I'm alone again..as usual.. but if Terence is here, I won't be goin to church by myself..   Juz had my vindaloo curry chicken dinner at 9.30pm so late ya... intended to cook before church but I was cleaning my kitchenette so ran outta time.. it's so darn cold now..wonder how warm the camp site will be..and if they have a phone for me to call Terence... or best if they have reception..so I can use my mobile... if all else fails then I'll hav to go without talking to my baby for 3days in a roll.. oh manz.. I don't wanna think abt tt...  Now is the sale peroid..I've gotten myself 2 pairs of earrings and 1 FCUK Tee for Terence.. hope he likes it cos it's in grey.. met up wof Padma yesterday, the chio babe is still as sexy as ever whaoooo... Really thank God for placing people in my life at appropriate times... if not I'll be a hermit at home.. such is life...   I don't think I'm making much sense here..but well, for the past few days, my QT with Mister God has directed me to obedience and oppression.. I don't really know why oppression but somehow He'll reveal to me someday... I'm waitin to be enlighten.. waiting...

      Slept early last night 1am as a result I woke up early at 5.45am but of cos the lazy me went back to sleep and finally got outta bed at 7.30am to make brekkie yummy... egg custard bun with milo hee hee I snuggle in bed with my hotwater btl in toil getting cosy and enjoying my early start... but then while I was reading I fell alseep (actually I told myself "aiya sleep for half an hr won't die") so I woke up again at noon... with the wonderful boom beats frm my neighbour's stereo that irritates the hell outta me...  Yes, I've mustered all strength to come to the computer at least I'm physically out and doin something.. I'm getting frustrated with my supervisor, perhaps, it's a mutual thing... I dream that she email me to meet her tomorrow and that it's final no more changes... and tt's also the reason why I'm online.. maybe my dream really mirrors reality... but so far she has not replied... maybe she's out for lunch...   I dislike this feeling of being under pressure, having to complete my wrk feelin all tense up... Edwin (my honours buddy) had warned me abt Audrey's slave-driving tactics..yes, I know that but didn't realise that it's gonna be so bad... I used to adore her adn seems like slowly my perception of her is changing.. before honours started, I was raving abt her and always dream of having her as my supervisor... aeiii dunno if this still stands... okok back to bks I'm hungry but lazy to eat... I want my MUMMY!!

      I'm sure my supervisor is pissed with a lousy crap honours student... I'm the stupidest and irresponsible student ahhhhh I hate myself rite now.. Terence will definitely be shaking his head when he read this but ahhhhhhhhh... I am a really disappointing student...  Much to say now I hav to push myself even more to cover my grounds in case she starts asking me qns... I can sense that I hav slack alot since my honours year started...I feel I'm not up there in terms of my theories and my research.. I feel that I hav not put in as much effort.. hmm.. I dread winter cos it doesn't give you the occassional umph in life.. makes u wanna sleep more, laze more, eat more and yah u basically dun wanna go out or do ya wrk... I find it hard to motivate myself to head down to uni and into lib to do research and juz spend a whole day there... tomolo I muz drag myself into uni..IT IS A MUST! yah then maybe go swimming as a reward...now I'm still awaiting for Audrey's reply to my meeting tomorrow... dunno if she wanna see me..  Even if she doesn't also good lah.. then I can do more research... hee hee

      On the surface, everything seems alright at least not until I see the posting Terence put up... I resent to all that is happening.. I don't feel anything.. not angry, not sad, not disappointed, not gonna cry, not gonna say anything from now on...No more questions in regards to the future...No more...I'm gonna be a silent partner in this whole affair...  I finally get on the routine of keeping fit by swimming... but farnie thing is the more I exercise the more I eat hmmm... The uni's pool is kinda crowded on a Sunday..but I love the changing area: clean like a clubhouse... I'm tryin to start on my thesis but the weather has been so cold..I've been sleepin more and also becos of the late nites I suppose I tend to be more lethargic... For me, this hols is driving my energies all into my work, keeping myself busy, not thinking of anything else... I'm gonna spent more time getting to know God's word cos I kinda slack.. my memory fails me most of the time... I can't remember any verse but I get the gist here and there... really need God's help..  Focus of the month for me: God's will

      Juz when I step forward, things juz happen and I'm 2 steps back...it's like dragging one of those iron balls chained up to my ankle.. frustrating and helpless.. cutting into my leg... painful yet I resent to the discomfort I'm having...  No this is no good..I don't wanna have moments of happiness and all of a sudden THIS ! the negative vibes surrounding me... ERK.. I've told him how I feel.. there's nothing I can do..I can't juz turn this ard with a snap of my fingers neither is it juz solely my own effort of seeing this work... I don't wanna think of myself as perfect or even noble in any extent cos rite now.. I know I'm human too...I feel tired, desperate and dejected... I feel like crying now but I can't find the tears... where are they.. maybe after a good cry I'll feel better...   I juz wanna space out now.. juz wanna lie in bed and not think of anything...   I hope All Blacks kick ass tonite... but then again Johnny Wilkinson is sooo cute..he got great ass...

Ok I gonna rest now for awhile...

      Ahhhh... relief from assignments..relief tt my relationship has been smooth out...relief tt I'll be starting on my thesis soon... juz relief tt life will be going well..at least for now, I hope..  I'm still recovering from the past weeks of stress and loss since my baby left.. Holidays are less appealing now..cos I know I've to endure through it and patiently wait for him to return.. Maybe tt's why I wanted to start going to gym and hit the pool once again juz to keep myself busy...   Rite now, I've to concentrate on getting my cover letter and resume done.. I pray I can find one in my outgoing box frm my email account... I really dislike the idea of marketing yourself as a commodity to prospective slave-drivers.. darn such is life.. I don't wanna come across as outlandish but I do hope mine can catch their eye... but how to strike tt balance...hmmm something to consider.. Okie I better do some research on their company... BCG Consulting here I come

      Perhaps I was under the influence of an afternoon booze.. I was enjoying the weather and the music on radio.. wanted to read but I was doing my ballet stretches since my body was stiff... I dance abit and was packing my messy table..saw Terence's notes and CD..decide to keep them in a "Terence box" but then I thought to myself maybe there's something else I shld box... my past...  Putting the things together was hard especially Cosmo's photos.. I realise I can box everything of Seng into a tiny box.. cos then I'll require one of those "going hme" courier boxes tt stand up to my waist lvl... so a small box of important memories... I tried to find some notes he wrote to me but I think I brought it back to S'pore... I wrote a 6-pg long letter of my feelings... my eyes were pouring and I was listening to "First love" on repeat... saying phrases tt he'll say to me... and yah I juz wanna do all these things and neber to do so anymore... in future.. it's a huge leap for me... but I wanna be fair as well.. if Terence can say, "I only have you in my heart" I wanna say the same...  The next to box will be my guilt for D... I'm tryin to put tt away cos it's not tangible things tt I can act on and say tt's final... it's harbouring in my mind and conscious.. I'm always dreamin tt I'll see him somewhere on the street... and then I dunno y but I'm always with someone else.. or tt he didn't see me and juz vanish... and I always wanted to tell him what I feel but can't... hmm..someday in real time maybe.. for now, I'll find a way in boxing it up.. I'll find a way...  Dreams are made of all things sweet and nice.. but when dreams turn sour and nasty, who's gonna bear the rat?

      This morning while on tram I chance upon this sticker tt says the above... not of much significance but I think I miss Uncle Frank and Auntie Jenny maybe I'll pop them an email after MIA for so long... I saw tt Tassie tix aren't expensive flyin on Jetstar.. I mite try to save as much this hols so I can catch 2 wks there I hope...muz find email address...hope to do so this wk I muz make an effort to remember..  Since baby is not ard, I mite juz catch sometime out in the country of Tassie.. not confirm though but I'll try... Tassie is like Perth quite and laid-back... the weather can be extreme now in winter..but Uncle Frank has been amazing..I was initially afraid of him cos he looks fierce but after the week at convention, he left such a lasting impression.. man of few wds but always so understanding to us youngsters neber seem to mind our nonsense... I mean real nonsense tt can irritate even myself sometimes...  Tassie sounds good ya... I mite do a double entry today... there's something else tt I wanna jot down..something tt's hard to do..

      Phew! 1 is down and another to go... Oh, I meant my assignments.. I'm really exhausted after staying up the whole nite wrking through my assignment and yet not able to hit the word count which is so unlikely of me..normally, I'll exceed the word count by another few hundred or so... I don't feel good abt this paper, I prayed over it as I drop it into the dept essay chute.. I've to depend on God's grace on the outcome...  I missed wrk today, overslept from the supposedly short nap of 2 hrs tt became 5 hrs.. woke up, panic, miss call, called back, no answer, damn, call wrkplace, phew nick answered, explain everything, more or less settled, called Terence, felt shitty, Rosie called, bye baby, explained to Rosie, guilty...  How can I switch off the alarm, I don't even remember hearing it ring.. muz be damn tired..ritez now at 3.30pm outside is sunny yet cooling.. terrific day for a jog..but no trainers (I don't wanna risk wearing the fallin apart ones I've) Terence chided me for wanting to continue running despite my joints aching.. what to do since I'm flat-footed and stricken with old injuries (I sprained my ankles both sides, my knees swelled whenever I run too much, I've a slightly curved spine)I attribute all my pains to the flat-footedness.. Medically speaking, due to the lack of an arch, the ankles roll inwards, the knees roll outwards and pushes the hips inwards.. tt eventually affects the lower back and of coz the upper back... so this explains all..  Ok, gotta go and find food.. my pantry stock is running into the red.. similarly for my fridge.. hee hee I'll juz cook something.. have a pleasant day ahead..signing off, eve

      Yesterday was the grand draw for AUS$36 million lottery ticket, who cares, I don't need riches like this (of coz a million will help thank you very much) The greatest gift from God I recieved this year is my baby.. Terence..  Over the past 2 years, I've been stuck in the "will you want me back mode" with my ex.. even though I know we aren't exactly compatible but well, I still wanna go ahead and give it a try and stand by him.. but seems like he's the one with the "heck care" attitude, having me or not doesn't make much difference to his monotonous life.. Not tt I'm bitchin abt him but rather for the 2 yrs of my wait has he appreciate my existence.. does he know that I pray for him every night when he almost got expel from uni? does he know that I wish he came to melb to be with me or how much I want to see him but can't due to other reasons.. I feel totally unappreciated.. even when he left, he didn't even gimme a call to say "I'm going home, take care ok and I'll send Cosmo pictures to you" No, not a word I get from him...  Past is past why reck it up.. reason is that now I know how to appreciate another person more and more each day.. I truly love him and is confident of a future with him.. Maybe he'll be frighten off by my confidence.. I've never have such confidence in any relationship due to own life experiences.. I even told Jac once that the reason why each relationship of mine don't work out is due to the lack of committment, I fear to commit... not so anymore...  Terence, you are a gift from Someone who loves me more than I can ever imagine...

      Everything seems fine now.. I told him I wanna think positive and not let matters like this go out of hand..Jac warned me of this and I know so down inside... I thought I was prepared for this but seems not so... I don't care now, I love him so much... He's gonna stop letting me know anything about her and I suppose tt's the best..for now..

      Juz talk to my baby on the mobile... He's geniunely upset abt me upsetting..how funny tables have been turned.. He assured me again for the upteen time that Nothing's gonna change..  I pray tt he drives safely home and get some rest for his sista's wedding tomorrow.. He doesn't sound right when we ended cos I didn't want to croach upon the issue again and again... like a feedback loop that juz doesn't benefit anyone in this sense... Time will straighten things up...   I want to be alone...

      Gonna make this a quick entry then I'll really concentrate in my wrk...as if I never say this before..  Our minds can play terrible and dangerous games with us.. let's say it's Mindfuck.. I really hate to use tt term but there at times when it fits purrfectly fine to the situation... I'm starting to consciously detach myself from emotions and to look at matters in a more rational and practical perspective... I'm here to do my Honours, to study.. I've got major problems in finishing my wrk and I shld never hav let this happen.. but I did and now I bear some responsibilities... I don't wanna shake them off as I'm old enuff to think tt such is life and I hav to handle sticky situations when it comes my way...Nothin is fair in this world if it really is... I won't hav a not so perfect family.. hard to relate sibling.. stepping unto ppl's toes unknowingly.. and perhaps even snatching someone's bf away... Life is unfair so what can you do abt it...  I love to think tt I'm enjoying this but seems like not.. coz I've got a conscious bugging me.. Oblivion is not easily attain unless you are dead to the people you love.. I just wanna be away from this world for a moment.. but I know my baby will feel the pain so I'll btl my own pain to see him happy... he calls this self-sacrificing.. but I don't wanna add hurt into his life.. I love him and yes despite my mind wantin to shut off and be still.. I will open a tiny window for him... juz for him

      Positive vibe is running through my vines rite now..I feel more synergised after muvin passed the "it's gonna be due tomorrow" fear..I don't care and really don't wanna think abt it... I'll juz do wat I can do and hand it in...   I want to think of myself as a discipline and excellant student but hmmm... probably not, I'm easily distracted, lazy, procastinator, playful in other senses, and throws in the white towel easily... My back is killing me and my eyes are dry and sore - the tangy feeling.. I feel uptite..  I was thinking abt buying myself a pair of trainers since I didn't do so the last time I went back to S'pore.. can't find a red and black Adidas (I'm fussy abt this: no red,I'll not wear)Yups, maybe after this whole thingy, I mite rock down to Smith St to get myself a pair..see how it goes... I feel like running on days like this.. but damn I don't hav a pair of functioning trainers.. my current pair is falling apart but I still love my o'l shoes, had them since I was in college...  My resolution for this one mth is to train my body up especially since I've been falling real sick.. I mite go swimming after I hand in my papers and after wrk... woo sounds fun... hee hee too bad the pools here can't be outdoors..miss the sun.. when Jac was here.. I'll juz go to her apt for a swim.. since she left I'd done it once  at the public bath..  Ok better start my wrk to keep the vibes pumpin

      I hope I can be as kancheong as peeps in regards to my assignments that have come to a standstill... I've been havin writer's block since this afternoon... Procrastination is such a key characteristic of every Arts student. Now is 8pm and I'm still feeling shitty and not wanting to write or read... not that I don't want to but stuff juz can't come out and I'm getting sick of my topic... THE MALE BODY.. bootalicious huh...  I need some jumpstart to THIS!!! Arggggggghhhhhhhh hate it... I'm frustrated with myself but ironically there is a sense of calmness in me I do not know why... I wish that false illusion of everything's gonna be fine at the end of the day gets dispel... Hey, can this be God's way of comforting my demented soul.. I suppose without this calmness in me I wld hav cried earlier on and juz give up but no tears... How weird.. maybe later...  I feel like sleeping but no I muz do my wrk... I want my mummy and I want peeps to be wif me to kiss me and touch my head, saying "You can get it done, I'll accompany you"... But well, such is life... you can't ask for more...  Light-headed now... shld I sleep??

      Waking up today has been a chore, the biting coldness makes it even more desireable to juz snuggle under the covers, nice and warm, my comfort zone.. Of cos, it'll be a joy to snuggle next to my beloved and to give him a morning kiss...  I remember before he left, I was juz next to him in the morning, not wanting to let him know that I was awake.. I took a little peek with one eye shut.. admiring his sharp features under the morning glow.. In my heart, I know that this is the guy to be with forever... Sounds like a fairytale but neverthelss I'll treasure every minute I've with him.. I love to push my nose against his arms and slowly he'll turn to his side to gimme a little squeeze.. how sweet..  Juz got off the phone wif mummy, talk abt him all over again juz so excited... Mum agrees that this is the best peroid tt a couple can have.. somehow in her voice I know it reminds her of her past.. maybe dad as well.. When I was younger, I remember mum gushes as each time she recaptures the days when dad was wooing her and of cos there are entourages around mum.. mum was a babe then, short skirts on a sensous body who can resist... Dad will come in his Vespa to grandma's hse and from a distance, mum can hear the cluttering engine of the scooter (heehee, Cliff Richard was hot, perhaps, mum was psychoed by dad's Vespa) Mum rejected her band boy suitor for dad.. and I lamented that if mum has gotten wif a band boy, I think I'll be a cool chick on drums (hmm... how can I think of tt cos I won't be here if they were together) Instead, she chose a poor kampong boy...  Similarly, I took on most of mum's charateristics like "wearing my heart on my sleeve" and "going for true love rather than looks or material possessions". In my life, I reckon I have the hidden desire to re-lived my parent's past.. I once did an research paper on Vespa and adores one; I love talented musicians (my baby is a bassist); I love watch sports on telly (dad's influence with a can of beer in hand, how Homer); I love to be independent and strong-willed (like dad) but with mum's sacrificing love and care for her man and family...     A blissful picture painted under my imagination but reality is cruel... Let's play Happy Family...

      The day has come for my baby to come home... For the past 2mths, it has been hell being apart..relying on phonecalls to get us through and gosh the amt of marnie of both us spend on the calls *gasph* But it's awesome that he's coming back in 8hrs time.. I can't wait.. my heart is beating fast as each min. ticks away.. I have mixed feelings abt our initial face-to-face meeting..how will it be like.. we've been speculating for the past few days and even planning on things to do once he gets off the plane..seems bizarre, yes, being away for so long can be make us do silly things...  Today has been pretty tiring for me..I don't really know why but maybe I'm gonna get my peroid soon... juz supa tired.. plus the weather is not doing any good.. I think when I look through the archives again I'll be tabulating the no. of times I've been cursing this damn weather... I'm kinda on a emotional low, despite the anticipation of Terence which by rite shld make me hit the ceiling, maybe becoz I saw some of the OCFers today... in uni.. I feel distant and sense that unconciously I've built a wall agst myself and them.. I love them heaps but the friendships are juz made up of "hi and bye" nothing personal and connective... it's sad.. maybe it's juz that life by itself is meant to be lonely... recently, it struck me that even though I may hav made really close frens through my stay in melb..but maintaining it is juz so difficult... my perth frens hav become a distant memory.. soon, my melb frens will fade away shortly..   A depressing fact but such is life..

      Believe anot I walk all the way frm my hse to Lygon St which is comparatively more than 5 rounds the stupppiaaddd stadium tracks.. I was late for my medical appt.. all becos there was an accident on the tram line..for all places.. so I validated my tram tix for nothing..   Phew! Lucky I manage to see the doc..he was kind enuff to see me.. most of the time they don't give a damn..but well God is good, wat can I say.. did a urine sample again and the nurse siphon some blood off me..wed..I'll check with them for the results..if it's unfavourable, I'll hav to go for more tests to check on muah body...  Wednesday is the dateline for my first chapter so I muz jia you to finish up the chapter...my intro is giving shape so tt's great.. I juz need to tie the loose end.. as for my first chapter..it's kinda crappy but who cares... hee hee..I muz persevere till Thurs morn.. coz Terence will be back..and I don't intend to do much wrk tt day.. gonna spend time with him and catchup on the lost time...yes, I'm countin down...  Kinda shock at the drinkin habits of some ppl... Jac told me abt her colleagues I think it's hilarious... supa wasted..tt's all I can say... Terence calls it "binge drinking" and he's totally agst tt.. I feel it doesn't prove anything, worst still, it juz proves how empty your life can be... I understand if someone gets drunk "accidentally" but to do so with a vengance is kinda dumb... the consequences can be grave..wat if you get rob, rape and killed.. I really can't see the pt of putting oneself in danger..ok if there's someone there to be your chaperone, tt's totally cool..but if there's no chaperone, one muz drink with caution...   PS: kinda enjoying to Franz Ferdinand now on radio..NOVA rocks!!

      Church svc has been awesome... Today's msg is frm Acts 12.. the faith of Peter in the midst of his adversity, he lay calm and rest his life unto the hands of God. At the same time, the church is behind him in prayers... spiritual covering... and there's this gal name Rhoda who is one of those behind-the-scene people... she heard knocks on the door and recognised that it's Peter's voice... but she didn't open the door immediately...Ok after the background, the main point of the msg is to open the door to allow God to enter as believing is not enuff, you hav to be ready to recieve...   Nothing much happen today... gonna stick to my TV and try doing my wrk... tt's for the last weekend alone... I miss Terence and I'm counting the last few days before he comes back...

      hahahahahah really being a care-bear is juz so hard..you love and naturally you care..but sometimes when caring someone becomes too much, it cross-over and becomes a nuisance and even distractive.. I think I've cross over the line and yes, I've screw up big time... He thinks that I've make him to feel small, to feel worthless.. yah while he was saying all this, my head was juz playing "I didn't mean to come across as such, I don't want you to totally eradicate whatever you are doing or even to control your life... I juz want you to do less of it... I care abt your health cos I don't want you to leave me so soon"...   Recently, the thought of death has entered my head with the results of my medical checkup... Ok this sound kinda ominous but yah I always have this feeling that one day, I'll contract a terminal disease.. funny yah.. but yes, I've gotta go for one more checkup for a second opinion on my condition... I'm juz afraid that I'll end my life so shortly especially when I've found someone that I can spend the rest of my life with...   Coming back to the problem... I think I'm not in a position to judge cos I'm no better than him.. if he thinks he's worthless, maybe I'm equally as worthless or even moreso... William is rite when he said that sometimes guys want to have submissive gfs who allow their man to do whatever he wants... I ask William: even to the extent of seeing destructions falling upon their man... Yes..was his reply... I don't think I can be such a gf and maybe I hav to learn to be so... it's juz sad... yah guess William is rite afterall...   I'm kinda tired..dunno if it's emotionally or juz physically tired my whole body is aching especially my lower back... dunno if it's related... Lord, renew me each day.. thank you for every moment that I'm alife.. thank you for every breathe I take..

      Australian Idol is back for the next season... Melbourne the capital of arts and performances..is being brought to a low... Coz guess what we got a William Hung wanna be...I reckon for the programme you can either make it big time with quality or still make it big time by being the anti-hero...Flynn sang Jacko's "Beat it" and yah with the classic moves that he'd improvised.. it was hilarious but once again another disgrace for the millions of Chinese out there... It's sick to know that now whenever I step out, I'll be judge based on stereotypes.. Chinese oriental chick who's submissive yet really fuckable... well, such is life especially when western imperialism still exists...  Juz went to city to run some errands.. met my OCF frens but I'm slowly distancing myself frm them..since I've decided to move onz... but yah I still wanna be frens with these young kids... I know I'll miss them but yah perhaps occassionally I'll drop by... hmm.. nothing much for today.. will update on my meaningless life tomolo..ciao...

      Jac,  This may seem abit weird as you kinda request for it.. for a start, you know how I feel abt you and Pat having the rocky beginning and even till now, you guys are still in the midst of the storm... Not that you don't have a choice, you do... similarly he does have a choice as well... you guys are juz sweeping things under the carpet and living in oblivion, paradoxically, hoping that things will smoothen out by itself eventually.. but such things don't happen...   I'm not in position to advise you on what you shld do and moreso to help you to decide...ultimately, this is your relationship with him.. I feel that everyone muz bear the consequences for their actions.. you do know what the results are for being in this relationship and somehow one of you muz make the sacrifice to bear the consequences... you can't untie the knot unless you loosen a piece of the string... This will go no-where as he doesn't want to chose, he's too soft... seeking the easy escape route.. I know you told me abt the mother and friends but come on, they shld respect what he wants.. and upon saying this, I want to let you know I respect your decision as well.. so much as I dislike it...   Now, it is the time for you to think it through and perhaps toss it out with him rather than pondering and questioning... if he can't take it then that's juz too bad..coz a relationship is not a mind-game.. it's not abt scheming... it's not abt shutting the other party up... it's really abt openess and transparency with each other... lies after lies...empty promises after empty promises won't bring you far... it can even be detrimental to your future with him as you guys have started out with mistrust... and disappointments... so Jac, do yourself a favour make the decision... you can't wait for him..   Sad to say for women, our youth is fading away quickly we are no longer the sort-after-books in the library, we are fast becoming left on the shelves... the other day, Nick (my other boss)said that women who want to achieve everything in life will miss the boat and that'll be too late... there's truth in his words... I don't want you to miss out on the boat that is destined to treat you well for life.. I want to be at your wedding in future, to see you in a wedding dress... I will be smiling for you...   Take care gal and treat yourself better...

      No work today..yippee!! God is so amazing, yes yes, I've underestimated how much He can do for me... Funny how we always say "God is BIG", "I know God is above all things", "God can change circumstances" blah blah blah... but I muz admit that even though I say those stuff, most of the time, I kinda say it without really comprehending and experiencing the "truths" in the statements and of cos, past experiences tend to be hazy and I kinda forget how good God can be...  Yes, now let me get to the point, I was going to work and in my heart, I don't feel like workin at all today cos I've got my chapter at the back of my head... my chapter is without much progress... but work is work and I have to be a responsible worker (I take pride being a Fish and Chips gal)... on my way, Mian called me to say that she's working today and ask if it's alright that we swap and I agreed.. I was bursting in my heart "Yeeeahhhhhhhhhh" so I went to uni to collect newspaper and I saw my Sook... and her brother.. ok we chat abit... and I came back to my place..went to do grocery shoppin (again?!) and as per usual I came home with more things then needed... But the point I'm trying to make is God answers prayers...  Then, I was thinking "Aiyah do my chapter, sian..." I came online to check mail and Praise God!! Audrey told me to hand in my draft next week and she'll see me next week... hahhahahah wah striking lottery wldn't be so lucky hhmmm this is obviously not luck but God's hand in every little things that we do... I muz say Jesus is in the center of every little things we do... for instance, this BLOGGG entry !! I'm bouncing with joy... Juz now, I apologised to Jac for my edginess in regards to her situation.. and the next entry will be for her...   Talked to Greg last nite.. it's been so long since we last catch up on each other.. and I miss the good o'days of clubbing, talking nonsenses with him, manja-ing to him and for him to rescue me when I'm dead drunk... yups, he's my best bud.. Greg, I miss you...ok better explain that I miss him as a fren juz in case someone gets...hee hee.. Actually, I'm kinda worried abt Greg now... hmmm.. he didn't want to tell me abt his problem and I can only tell him that I'll pray for him... yes, I feel bad that I can't be there for him through his difficult moments... Sorry Greg..   Greg was rather taken aback when I told him about me and Terence being together... He thinks that we got together too soon, citing that we don't really know each other well enough... Yes, greg got a point..but I don't really care and I'm happy with my choice.. Everyday, I feel like I'm on a rollarcoaster ride at the carnival... this Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee feeling I have inside is so intense!!! I'm deeply in love with him and there's nothing I wanna change... I know Greg cares for me and I truly appreciate his concerns...He said, "This is shocking.. I know you for so many years and he don't even know you.. yet you guys got together... this is so weird.. muz tell Vishnu"... Somehow, I think the reason why me and Greg never work out, coz we see facets of each other that we dislike or can't stand... I know he finds me extremely irritating at times... if we'd gotten together, I don't think we can even be friends if things don't work out... so this relationship of being juz friend wrk out fine... like I wrote to him many years ago... we can be friends for life rather than spoil it all.. He deserves a better gal anyway...I'm juz pure nonsense hahhahahahahhaha... Besides, God has His plan for me... that is to be with Terence!!   For now, I'm juz blissfully in love...

My mum has been asking me to go for a full body checkup.. aiyah where got time and marnie to do all this... maybe when I start wrking then I can pay for my own checkups... or better still my company pay for it... hee hee  I'm so dogged out.. and I'm juz rambling onz..better be a good gal and start my wrk...

      Yes, indeed, the weather is excellant today.. Damn, whenever such cheery weather comes along once in a blu moon and I've gotta be stuck at hme, finishing up some datelines... Such is life... Mr Sun has decided to visit Melbourne for the day and I do hope he comes again tomorrow..I love looking outta my window as the sun sets...even though I can only see the chimney roof tops of my block's houses but the combination of backyard trees and paved roofs give me a Charles Dickens feel...Hmmm.. my thesis chapter is not forming...Haiya, I really don't know what to do with it...but will still try to squeeze out something for Tuesday... Need some inspiration rite now... Ommmmmpppppppphhhhh...  I slept more than 10hrs and woke up feeling much better.. I muz hav kinda overwork myself unknowingly... my body is aching and if I can go back into bed, I'll... I'm eating junk again... had Indo mee with egg cooked sunny side up, 2 sticks of ice-cream and of coz my sago and gula melaka that I'm trying to finish... I'm gonna abstain from TV tonite urm except for Gilmore Gals... how can I miss it... I mite cook claypot chicken rice but using the rice cooker... and tofu and egg soup...let see how depends on my mood later...  Talking abt mood.. I was talking to Terence earlier.. hmm.. I don't know how to put it in words but juz that he shld hav been more thoughtful in regards to his actions... what if he met an accident... I'll be such a wreck... what if he dies... I'll be so devastated... I know this is bringing things to an extreme sense but that's what so many other people say when things turn wrong..."I didn't think it'll happen to me" or "I regret what I did"... you may say that's one in a million chance of occurrence but there's still a chance of it happening... I don't see myself as beinging unreasonable or even controlling.. I juz hope that Terence can see my point of view... I can't wait for these 2 weeks to pass by quickly..  Ahhh...the warm glow of Mr Sun is on my face... so nice and warm... What a joy to live and to love!!

      Urghhhh stress and feeling lousy... I didn't go for OCF this fri nite..thot I'll stay hme and attempt to do my first chapter of my thesis...but as usual the procrastinator will find all distractions to stop wrk.. oh yah, watch American Sweetheart starring Catherine Zeta Jones, John Cusack (one of my favourite actor) and Julia Robert.. I forgot that I had watch it before but heck anything to get away frm wrk...   While watching TV, decided to eat curry again with roti (I tend to overcook) and made dessert for myself (sago with gula melaka and coconut milk) but after eating that I feel even lousier... like wanna puke..my head swirl abit and now I'm having a cuppa fruit tea to ease the discomfort... I reckon that whenever I'm stress I get these bouts of wanting-to-throw-up... not good and my whole body gets outta whack... I eat crazy stuff (ie snacks which I normally abstain frm) and not exercise (tiz reminds me to go swimming on Sun, if possible, before church) Probably, I'll do some sit-ups before I sleep tonite..juz to get my tummy down as well...  I'm really scared shitless for my thesis coz I find that my research has been not up to sratch and also I've been mucking ard tooooo much...juz got my results back today.. not first class honours grade but second upper... this means that next semester I've got to get all H1 in order to get my first class honour... aiya how...stress..  My casual wrk is all fun even though I wrk for 3 hrs per day.. I learn some Cantonese and Italian each time I go in... Oh I can speak Cantonese but juz need some brushing up and correct my chet chet Singaporean Cantonese... I learn how to say drinking straw, pineapple, banana in Cantonese and for Italian, I can say "the shop is closed", "go home", "crazy", "good morning" and "breaking balls" (oops nothing noti it's juz an Aussie slang) I can count frm 1-4 in Italian..Yes, Nick said that soon he'll make a wog outta me!! Cool... I muz increase my vocab. Somehow it's sad that I can only say "no" in Russian and "Good morning", "Good afternoon", "Good nite" in German... I reckon it's more fun learning a language through direct contact with people than frm language classes or frm books...   I borrowed some books frm library... Babylon by contemporary Russian author Victor Pelevin... Immortality by Milan Kundera (since I love his novel The unbearable lightness of being) and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Kundera as well...If I don't have to do my chapter, I'll be diving into my bks for the next few days... it'll be a pure joy to juz stay in bed the whole day not getting outta bed to brush my teeth, bathe, eat and even drink... in bed reading my book.. it's a luxury!! I hope to read more Russian authors's books like Solzhenitsyn and Tolstoy... the thin line between propaganda and disguise of critical commentary of socialism... One tends to ponder on the ideology behind the text.. is the author: a propagandist or a critique of the regime?? It is amazing to read a novel and see how the story reveals the social condition of a bottled-neck society yet running parallel to the regime's guidelines of publication... each utterance muz me made with careful consideration... This is a craft...   Darn, I won't be catching the ballet performance by the Sydney Dance Company entitled Shades of Gray tomorrow coz I hav not done my wrk yet... Pity, pity... Gotta give it a miss..

      I think I'm going nuts... a potent mixture of longing for someone and PMS is making me going bonkers!!! I've so much wrk to do but my body seems to be functioning slower these days.. juz yesterday I clocked up more than 12 hrs of sleep but waking up intermittently to snooze my alarm and turning the water heater on... Amazing rite, I was amused myself too...  I hav heaps of stuff to do and I can sense this mounting fear inside me..but my body wrks in a farnie manner: when I fear, I feel sleepy..hee hee as the saying goes, "sleep over your problems" I adhere to that and I give a BIG nod to that.. The weather doesn't help abit..and it's freezing rite now... seems like gradually decreasing in temperature..I can't wait for Winter to be over..   Holidays are bad.. I tend to shop more and eat-out more... my bank account seems to be plummeting with little input.. I told myself that I gotta save but so far urm... seems unlikely.. I try hard to restraint myself frm going grocery shopping becoz I tend to come hme with more than the singular item which I intended to purchase... now my fridge is well-stock up and so is my pantry and of coz my snack corner.. thus, the extra pound that I've put on... This is complusive excessive buying disorder, in short, spendthrift!! There are certain things that I need like a new heater (currently using Terence's), a new mobile (the antenna for the mobile has been ripped out), a new toilet seat cover (don't ask me abt it ok) and let me see what else... hmm... But really I wanna set aside some marnie so that when Terence comes back, we can go out for nice meals and probably go for "The Impressionist" art collection viewing, performances and maybe a short trip to somewhere... I also want to set aside some marnie for my mum and aunt...so that at the end of the year when they come for my convo.. I can provide them some spending marnie or even foot the bill for meals... I wanna give some back to them and allow them to enjoy their stay here.. That's my greatest wish rite now.. I miss everyone so much...    God teach me how to spend my marnie wisely this holiday

      I meant to put this down before my own update for Mon. but here it goes..   Sunday service was awesome...even though I made the greatest boo-boo as usual by arriving late at the wrong place and then having to arrive even later at the rite location... darn so I was doubly late... however, as usual, I sat by myself and missed the initial worship session but city church has always have proplonged worship session throughout the svc... Henri and the rest of Planetshakers are back with Ps Russell so that's fantastic..wonder how their trip to US had been... the new album will be coming out soon..I mite juz save enuff marnie to buy the whole Planetshakers collection since it's my final yr... The only thing in mind is that I hope even if I'm not here anymore.. Terence will continue going to church...   We've a guest speaker frm Perth and he spoke abt having to rise up male leader as spiritual head of the family as the observation has been that spiritually the woman in the family has been leading the household... I totally agree to that stance... knowing most guys will bag to defer.. ego?? Ok.. then the Ps spoke of Matt 14:21 on Peter walking on water..which was covered during camp..Coincidence?? I'm afraid not cos I suppose God has something plan for most OCFers and this is another reminder for us... to be focused on Jesus even when life is happy-scared and in the midst of the storm we can depend on Jesus to stretch out his hand for us to clutch on to... it is so true that only in stormy situations that we wholly depend on our Lord for help and the Ps remined us that we shld not see each failure in life as a setback but rather we shld see it as the seedbed for success... but this success can only be possible if we place faith in Jesus to carry us through... like in the valley of bones... we pass through instead of halt and fear... The success will bring us to another lvl in knowing Christ deeper...   I'm guilty of being of little faith cos for most of my life I can't trust anyone and life experiences make me feel that as long as I can handle I don't need to depend on anyone... so it has been hard to juz say "Lord, I trust you" I'm struggling and I admit that... I know He sees my weakness and tries to make me whole again through small situations..During my own QT, I discovered that anxiety and worry are sins that hinders us frm trusting God to provide for us... cos it only brings ourselves before God... rather than let God take the leading role in our lives... Hmm..I neber think of worriness and anxiety as sins and this is a mind-boggling concept for me... Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness then all ye things shall be added unto you...   This Month's motto: Walking-on-Water F.A.I.T.H

      I am in such a daze rite now, probably, I have been sleeping way to much or maybe it's my peroid that is draining the sap of life outta me... My ex-hsemate used to do the "snapping of her uterus with a pair of scissors" action to signify the pain and discomfort that she dreads...urmmm..I kinda find that gross especially when accompanied with the snapping sounds "snip, snip"  Well well, Terence has gone to HK for 5days and will be back on Thurs.. can't wait for Thurs to come then we can chat for a longer peroid of time..but seriously, I find that our conversations are kinda meaningless... hmm... you know the lovey dovey stuff...maybe I am a wanker, I'll sometimes like to have intelluctually stimulating talks, exercising my brains abit here and there... No offence, baby... but I know myself is guilty of not initiating more serious talks... coz I juz want to listen to your voice...   *Sirens are blarring outside, muz be some serious crime bustdown or fire...Juz heard frm my fren who major in Criminology that my area is the hotbed for drugs!!!..hmmm until now, I don't feel anything scary, as a matter of fact, I feel safe here*  Deep down inside, I dread the end of next semester to come coz then I'll hav to pack up and leave... provided I get a sponsored job here in Melbourne... I really wanna stay to be with Terence but I don't know everything seems not to be pointing in that direction..I pray to God that please let me stay...I don't mind the cold winter weather as long as I can stay... I don't mind getting a shit job as long as I can stay... Please Lord, let me stay... I know I'll miss Terence like crazy.. I juz dread that day will come..I think I'll cry till my eyes poofed up to beyond description... even when Terence left for Singapore this hols, I juz can't contained my tears...   Sometimes, I suppose this is my own downfall...loving someone so deeply.. I get so attached to someone that my life can only function with the same beat of his heart... I hate to see myself as a parasite that clings so tightly to the one I love but maybe I am that parasite... itsy bitsy spider went up the water spock down came the rain and wash the spider off... Please don't flush me out...

      Indeed, this will be my last camp... and I was kinda disappointed that I didn't get to experience the full camp... I know that it's gonna be damn awesome but well on the other hand, I am willing to serve in the kitchen..I know they needed the extra help... so I manage to go for the nite sessions that were equally great!!!  The first nite session was talking on faith..taking the risk to walk on water and keeping out eyes focus on Jesus... Cos when Peter took his eyes away frm Jesus that was when he started sinking... It's a wake-up call for many even though we'd heard so many times on this epsiode of faith-walking but we seldom realise that when we say "send me, Lord", often do we not tally our request with the faith to step out and focus on Jesus to do amazing things... I am guilty of being one of these people... The first nite there was an altar call and most people was slain and there were prophersies being said... Ps Matt was so annointed... it was life-changing experience for many and some of the non-Chirstians present were so afraid cos it's their first time seeing people speaking in tongues and falling onto the grd...    The second nite was similar and yah I prayed hard for the salvation of my family and the countries that God has placed in my heart... when Ps Matt lay his hands on me, he told me this, "You are a great woman...You have always been hiding in the back row, hiding behind everyone but you have a loving, serving and generously giving heart... You will robbed people the pleasure of knowing your personality...People will not know how much they can get out of you until they finally know you... and the things that you said will add new experiences into their lifes... Stop apologizing for who you are and you are not worthless..." and before I know anything I was on the floor... I was crying out to God... my hurts were revealed so clearly... All these times that I'd give to the people ard me, I juz feel that they may appreciate the work that I'd done and yes I sincerely am touch by their gestures but the truth is that they ain't gonna take time off to sit down and really get personal... I'm so sick and tired of having patronising people ard me..I've decided with this camp that I'm gonna move on... I'm gonna leave OCF and for the next semester, I'll juz spend more time at hme or with Terence or juz in the presence of God...   When Ps Matt was saying those words to me, I was crying so hard cos that was exactly who I was... I'm not an upfront person..I'm willing to do my work without people seeing or knowing...cos I hate being showy or tryin to get that extra praise... I'm also the kind that hates mucking ard and taking extra longer time to finihs of specific tasks esp in a team context... When I see the OCFers, I find that they live in this false sense of innocence and I am afraid for them..well I suppose since most are Malaysians...I think, for them, their life surrounds only church and church friends... or rather Christians...I feel that is kinda shallow to a certain extent yah I know I'm not suppose to judge but I'll rather be honest than a hyprocrite...   I know this is a long post..but I've all these feelings pent up inside my heart for the longest time... I feel sad to leave my "family" and my only friends in Mlebourne but it's time for me to make changes...

      Sem 2 has started and I'm swamped with loads of uni. wrk: thesis, course readings and etc.. busy... my ex-hsemate is backin melb and she's staying with me... went for brekkie today at degraves... I'm so not a morning person but the breakfast is yummy to the max... bacon with eggs, tomatoe and mushroom with toasted rye bread... After which we went shopping... I find it really hard to resist buying... It was cool spendin time together again..  For the next 2 wks, I'll be spending lesser time with Terence...I feel kinda bad...and I miss him every minute we are apart... Terence has been so giving and so appreciative.... He even came over in the wee hours to help my hsemate carry her luagge up the stairs... He's a sweetie... Unfortunately, he fell sick... I was so worried coz when I saw him, he look really pale... my heart was hurting... Baby, I'm sorry if I was being irrational...

      It's been a long time since I last update my blog... Terence is back... so for the past week, we have been spending lotsa time together... went shopping for my new trainers (sign up for gym), it isn't exactly red but there are strips of red on the shoes so I'm satisfied with the cheap buy ($45) kids size somemore hahhahahah... I've bought a black jacket and Terence got for me the red one... both are amazingly value for money...  It has been a crazy first week... working more hours and juggling my classes (one day week wooo hoo) as well as trying to complete my thesis chapter 1..that is draining my soul away... I'm starting  to lose the momentum of my thesis project.. the yucky feeling is edging in slowly and I'm dragging my feet to complete my chapters... I sense a tension between my supervisor and me...cos she has extremely high stds.. now in my fourth year, I'm finding it harder to make her mark... Praying to God for better working relationship...  My other subjects are interesting: Material culture and Postcolonial concerns, Postmodern Theories. The former consists of fieldtrips to museums, herbie, state lib. etc etc.. sounds fun yah.. I can't wait for the trips even though I went to some of the places alreadi... The latter is more theoretical... readings on Orientalism and spaces of knowledge...centering on China as the oppostional culture to the West... the mystification of China.... Actually after goin through the readings, I'm kinda taken aback by the "chimness" of the course, juz hope I manage to survive hahhahahaha This semester I'm dealing with 2 disciplines tt ain't my forte.. so muz wrk harder... but seriously, I find it hard to accomplish... distractions
