      I will not be posting friday full card due to computer problems. Here are a few quick horses to bet on Friday. Race 6  # 7 Dixe Preacher 2-1 Chavez rides and should wire the field. Race 7  # 7 Vespers 9-2 switches to JR Velazquez and is over due to win in her 4th start of year. Race 8  #2 Blue Skies Ahead 10-1 will be sitting in the garden spot with the Mig riding and should come flying home after the speed burns each other out...  Good Luck and I hope to have Saturdays full card online.....  Did somebody say Tapit? Any horse that has Guiness for breakfast is ok with me.  See you at the races.

      1 Lion Heart 3-1 7 Smarty Jones 8-5 2 Borrego 15-1 8 Imperialism 5-1 10 Rock Hard Ten 6-1 9 Eddington 8-1  In the Kentucky Derby I bet on Lion Heart and he finished second to Smarty Jones. Smarty Jones has never lost a race in seven starts and Lion heart has never finished worse than second in his six starts. These two horses were clearly superior to all the challengers in the KY Derby. Since I started Handicapping in 1990 my Derby Choice has done very well in the Preakness. So I recommend you play Lion Heart to win and box him in an exacta with Smarty Jones. Borrego, based on his workout shows he still is in top form. Imperialism is a hard running closer and will be flying late. Rock Hard Ten has only three career starts and has never won a grade stakes. He did not run in the KY Derby. He does however have G Stevens flying in from France to ride him. Eddington also has not won a graded stakes race and did not start in the Derby. He does get the services of Hall of Fame Rider Jerry Bailey. In my opinion the best jockey of the last decade. In the last twenty years only one horse has won the Preakness after not starting in the Kentucky Derby. I feel the horses not starting in the Derby will be at a extreme disavantage and sould not be bet to win. Below is my betting strategy for the Preakness.  $20 win on 1 Lion Heart $10 Exacta box 1 Lion Heart with 7 Smarty Jones $1 Trifecta 1 with 7 with 2,8,9,10 $1 Trifecta 7 with 1 with 2,8,9,10 $1 Superfecta 1-7-2-8 $1 Superfecta 1-7-8-2 $1 Superfecta 7-1-2-8 $1 Superfecta 7-1-8-2  Total cost of all bets $52 Good Luck. Belmont picks for today will be posted soon.

       I have not been able t post a blog for awhile because my laptop no longer wants to hold a charge. I am in the process of getting a new dell desktop. It was suppose to be here 7/2/04 but they delayed shipment until 7/27/02. I will be up and running for the Saratoga Season even if I have to work on another computer like today.   In other news. I am also playing Texas Hold-em on Pacific Poker website. I started out real well, but have been getting cold cards and my play is effected by this. I plan to ride out the slump and come back strong. I will update this also.  So to conclude be ready to check back here on 7/27/04 for opening day picks for Saratoga racing. So until then may all your horses be fast and win at good odds...
