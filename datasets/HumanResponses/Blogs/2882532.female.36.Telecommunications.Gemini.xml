						   To an old friend...  Over a month ago I finally had the means to be able to order your book.  I thought within the pages I would find some answers, some solace for these wounds that have been so slow to heal.  It arrived yesterday.  I read and re-read and I cried.  I remember so many of these words read to me by you when we used to share our writings with each other...  Maybe it means more to me because 90 percent of what was there, I know those faces, I know the situations.  Witnessed through you sharing your confidences with me, and for some, being there, in the shadows.  Forced to watch as you fell, unable to do anything but be there.  In reading, what leapt out at me wasn't what you said, but everything you didn't say...  The things you avoided.  There was no solace there for me, no answers...      And all I can say is...  I forgive you Derek.  May you find the peace, love and happiness you seek.

						    20 Questions to a Better Job    Your job's score is 49.   Your job is mind-bendingly bad. So incredibly bad. So shooting-spree inducing bad. Why are you in it? Is it deeply rewarding work? Are there a few kindred co-workers whose positive spin make the whole mess bearable? Are you shlepping through two more years of this hell so you can escape into a well-respected, well-salaried position? You had better hope at least one of the above is true, or otherwise your life is on a one-way train to Stinksville. You like that? I made it up myself.   urlLink 20 Questions to a Better Job     20 Questions to a Better Personality    Wackiness: 36/100  Rationality: 30/100  Constructiveness: 36/100  Leadership: 30/100   You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.   Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.   You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    urlLink Better Personality Quizz

						     You are the Magician card. Magick is the use of the will to effect change in reality. The will is the ability to direct knowledge and experience towards an end goal. The Magician is capable of manipulating his environment because he knows it so well. He effects the thoughts and emotions of those around him. Therefore, the Magician is often thought of as an artist, writing or speaking in a way that strongly influences others. The Magician understands how to bring concepts into form and how to express metaphysical concepts in a physical way. He is seen with the symbols of each suit: a disk, a cup, a sword and a wand. These symbols are each a physical expression of a concept. They are The Magician's tools. Following after The Fool, The Magician acts as a messenger. His planet is Mercury, who is Messenger of the Gods. He brings The Fool into the new world that The Fool seeks. The Magician represents the act of creation. Because he can use his knowledge to form something new, he seems to be able to make a thing appear out of a void. Image from: L. S.
