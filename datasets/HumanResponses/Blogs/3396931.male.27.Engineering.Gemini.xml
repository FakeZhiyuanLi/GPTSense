      In-class Assignment for Wednesday - A True Story  Remember the book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"?  Here's a prime example offered by an English professor from the University of Phoenix: "Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple. Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right. As homework tonight, one of you will write the first paragraph of a short story. You will e-mail your partner that paragraph and send another copy to me. The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story and send it back also sending another copy to me. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth. Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. There is to be absolutely NO talking outside of the e-mails and anything you wish to say must be written in the e-mail.  The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached.  "The following was actually turned in by two of my English students: Rebecca (last name deleted), and Gary (last name deleted).  ------------------------------------------------------  THE STORY: (first paragraph by Rebecca) At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her fav orite for lazy evenings at  home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must now, at al! l costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again. So chamomile was out of the question. -------------------------------------------------------  (second paragraph by Gary) Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things  to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named  Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago. "A.S. Harris toGeostation 17,....", he said into his transgalac tic  communicator. "Polar orbit established. No sign of resistance so far..."  But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out ofnowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay. The  jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.  -------------------------------------------------------  (Rebecca) He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he feltone last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4.  "Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel," Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth, when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no vision to distract her from her sense of  innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. "Why must one lose one'sinnocence to become a woman?" she pondered wistfully.  -------------------------------------------------------  (Gary) Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament  Treaty through the congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostilealien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret Mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of! Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion, which vaporized poor, stupid, Laurie and 85 million other Americans. The President slammed his fist on the conference table. "We can't allow this! I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow 'em out of the sky!"  --------------------------- ---------------------------  (Rebecca) This is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic semi-literate adolescent. -------------------------------------------------------  (Gary) Yeah? Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts atwriting are the literary equivalent of Valium. "Oh, shall I  have chamomile tea? Or shall I have some other sort of F***ING TEA??? Oh no, I'm such an air headed bimbo who reads too many Danielle Steele novels."  -------------------------------------------------------  (Rebecca) Asshole.  -------------------------------------------------------  (Gary) Bitch.  -------------------------------------------------------  (TEACHER) A+, I really liked this one !. Only group to get an A    .... And the story goes on... :))
