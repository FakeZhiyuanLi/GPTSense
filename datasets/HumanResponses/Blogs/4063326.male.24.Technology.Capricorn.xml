       My brain is always ticking.. at night it still ticks.. when i try sleep i can't.. it takes hours for me to fall asleep and when i do it's never a good sleep. I'm not a negative person. this is just the way it is.   The people of earth need me.

       Self employed and realising i'm the only person who actually really knows what i do is weird. My business partner knows nothing of the inner workings of what I do and actually is quite clueless when it comes to anything technical. I have never met anyone in my life who has understood fully of what i do and how i do it.  I keep quite about my work and what it involves and even though it's amazingly stressful but highly rewarding the stress sometimes gets to me, alot. My girlfriend often interrupts me when i speak of my work, she's practically the only person i ever discuss my work with, i don't know if she interrupts me because she finds it boring or just doesn't want to listen because she knows she won't understand. Sometimes I find it very rude as she is normally polite. I always remain quiet when she talks, i wish she'd do the same with me.  I stay up night after night without feeling the need to sleep.. my mind is constantly working, these days i find that marijuana is about the only thing that sets me free from "work mode". In a country which pot is illegal i have found it almost impossible to get my hands on some within the last 2 months or so.. it's frustrating but then again i'm sure if i REALLY wanted it i could get it. I simply stay away from dealers & other such shady characters..usually getting someone i know well to get it for me. I think it's a wise move. I have recently being studying growing techniques and think i will grow some marijuana plants in my attic .. it sounds like a good idea. Living outside the city it's highly doubtful that my cover will be blown, especially when you consider that i will not tell ANYONE i am growing it.   I HATE when people talk just to talk .. I hate falseness. I hate most people. I fucking hate them.  I have an intense amount of hatred and anger for stupid or slow people - they drive me crazy.  Fuck it.
