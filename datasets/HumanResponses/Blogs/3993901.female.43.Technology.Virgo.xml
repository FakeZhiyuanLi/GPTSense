      What excitement! What suspence! This is freaking hilarious (I'm grinning so big it hurts my face - really)!  Last night, about 9 p.m., Matt (my oldest son, 10) was putting the PS2 controllers away after watching me kick butt on Tomb Raider for over an hour, and he watched as a mouse dove behind our entertainment center. At first I didn't beleive it. Matt is a bit prone to "telling tales" that grow with the telling. However, I was nervous... my bedroom has a sliding glass door and in the summer we keep that door open about two inches. However, there is no screen on the slider. Sucks, I know, but you do what you can to keep cool air circulating. Well, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that things that live outside may want to experience life inside... like tourists. Usually it is spiders, crane flies and the occasional mosquito. No biggy. The landlord owns a pest control company and he sprays regularly so the sightings are kept to a minimum.  Anyway, it was no surprise when Matt again saw the mouse, this time in the kitchen. He watched as it ran from under the stove to a space under the dishwasher. Eric got motivated (Eric is the S.O. - significant other). He pulled out the dishwasher and sure enough, here was the mouse cowering in the corner. We took action! Eric picked up anything the mouse could hide under, blocked access to places he could dive under, opened the front door adjacent to the kitchen and the kids stood sentry to stomp in case the mouse ran toward the front room. I, amused by this display of consolidarity in the face of such a formidable opponent, sat regally observing from my perch on the couch. Hey, I may be an independant fem, but with three men in the house, pest irradication isn't my worry.  Eric got the broom to encourage the critter to flee toward our funnel out the front door. Well, the mouse moved - fast - skittering toward the front room. The boys dutifully stomped and yelled (war cries? screams of fright?) and the mouse changed direction - right at me. Since jumping off the couch really wouldn't work (too fat, can't jump), I stomped my feet and the racing rodent dove under the couch.   If I had thought the previous activity was stimulating to watch, what happened next was shocking in it's intensity. Eric began tearing the front room apart in order to leave no place to hide for the furred minion of Satan. Couch cushions flew. Today's newspaper was left to the winds of fate as it was hurled through the living room, coming perilously close to the ceiling fan. Books and toys the kids had refused to put away were promptly boxed and moved.  Eric turned the couch over and the mouse made a break for the entertainment center (again). Then back under the bookshelf holding all of our VCR tapes and CD's. Then back toward the couch. This being too much excitement for me, and since this is a Saturday and only 10:30 a.m., I'm still in my nightgown... I decided to head to my room and get dressed for the hunt. All of the doors along the hallway are shut to keep mice out, so I shut my bedroom door, and behind me, the hunt continues.  The activity moves toward me, and I hear Eric tell not to open the door because the mouse is pressed against it. It beats lions at the gate, but I'm still concerned. Against all odds, the furred minion of random chewing squeezes under the closet doors next to my bedroom, where, unbeknownst to us until this point is a small square hole in the wall that was formerly an exhaust port for a clothes dryer. Eric takes everything out of the closet and blocks the hole. Phew! It is still a problem but not IMMEDIATE. Right? Things are NEVER that easy.  Relieved, the boys head into their bedroom and Eric decides that he was just waiting for an excuse to pick everything up off of the front room floor and vacuum. Unfortunately, the only pair of jeans I can find has a huge hole in the caboose area, so I'm stuck in the bedroom sewing (phew!). Eric, finishing the front room takes the vacuum into the kitchen and begins cleaning behind the dishwasher and the stove (he pulled that away from the wall too?). I find more holes in my jeans that desperately need patching, all the while wondering how much will actually get done. And then the scream.  Matt rips into my bedroom yelling the he's seen the mouse run from his closet. Now, for the original mouse to move from the back of the closet, through the walls into the boys' room would take hours, right? There isn't even a hole in the back of the boys' closet, is there? Big trouble... the boys' room is a disaster. Their closet is piled with false proof that their room is "cleaned". Eric comes in a witnesses said mouse run behind the boys' computer desk.  Right now the boys are cleaning (really!) their room in an attempt to flush the mouse out. Eric has gone to the hardware store to buy traps. Me? I'm in my office with the door barred to half-ounce minions of chewing destruction, typing in my blog. After all, my Star Wars action figure collection is directly threatened! I'm guarding it.  So for now, mouse: 1, family: 0. Of course, there may be more than one mouse... whoo-boy!

      So far today I have been mildly productive. I actually got dressed at a reasonable time, I read my paper and got out and got the errands done I needed to do.  I'm ticked that this one business I need to shop at is  NEVER  opened! You'd think that if you have enough invested with a store front to actually need to stay open on occasion. The problem is that, this is the only business in the area that sells ammo cans (for Geocaches), and without them, the  urlLink Event  I'm trying to put together will crash and burn.  I returned three movies, found out what forms I need to fill out for the  urlLink Event  and went by the  urlLink Chamber of Commerce  to see if they could put a notice on their events calendar.  I also talked to the editor of The Triplicate. I used to be a semi-columnist for them, the column being  urlLink "Web Threads" , or Stories from the Internet. I got the go-ahead to write this piece about  urlLink Bookcrossing  from the paper's publisher, and she promised she'd put in a good word for me. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to hold any water with this guy. He told me to go ahead, and in the vein of J. Jonah Jamison, I should take that as a resounding POSITIVE, or not. I DO have to re-write the piece to make no mention of the publisher, who just released her newly published first book. That sucks, too. It was kind of a pivot point for the article.  Oh, and I updated the  urlLink Beauty With Attitude  "news" page. It was surprising that it has been six months since I last updated it. Especially when I saw that I had written that "Hellboy" would be released in theaters in a few weeks, and it just came out on DVD yesterday! Yeah, I suck, too. Hell, it's done and that's what matters.

       I have tried a few blog programs, maybe even this one back in the day. Nothing ever seemed to work out, and I program HTML by hand! You'd think I'd have a clue.     &nbsp;   So, I'm trying this. I'll eventually modify it so that it is reflective of my  urlLink Beauty With Attitude &nbsp;website, which inspired me to be honest while blogging.    Let's see if I can keep up a dialog.

      The score is now Men: 1/Mouse: 0! That isn't necessarily a good thing, though. As posted yesterday, the boys got seriously busy tearing toys out of their closet and search for aforementioned rodent. After they had pulled every single toy (and this alone is an enormous task -spoiled brats) out, they heard chewing behind them... at Matt's dresser! That got another flurry of fly toys dispersed. The mouse ran back into the closet. As he did, Matt dropped a box full of toys on the furred menace. They called Eric in to make sure that they had it trapped and the little desparado was on his back, kicking up his back legs and had his tongue hanging out. Eric scooped it up in an old coffee can, and since I was on a business call and unaware of their hunting success, he hung the mouse from the tail in front of my nose.  Much to my credit, I didn't scream, cry or use foul language. No. I calmly requested that he get it out of my face. I remained calm until I got off the phone. Even though this is a no-holds-barred (cussing allowed) blog, some of the epithets I spewed were so creative that I want to get them trademarked and copyrighted before I release them in text on the rest of the world. Yep, that good.  The big question remains: Was that the only mouse? Inquiring minds and my renter's insurance company want to know.  On another note, we drove to Lake Selmac in Southern Oregon to attend the JARS-ORCA Amateur Radio club's potluck and swap meet. I even got up early (9 a.m.!) to go. I was conjuring excuses why I couldn't spend an afternoon visiting with old men and discussing radio with young nerds in 100+ degree heat, when Eric came in and told me that Marci and Don Campbell of the Humboldt Radio Club were heading to the same function. I was thrilled! I adore Marci (and Don's is pretty amusing, too), and she and I need to stick together since we are the only two female Amateur Radio Club Presidents that WE have heard of. Solidarity!  By the time we hit the Oregon border, though, the Campbells were already heading back. Huh? They asked if they could buy us lunch at Taylor's Sausage in Cave Junction. Of course! We met them there and Eric ate a sandwich (all the while looking at Don's huge slice of dill pickle and asking him, "Are you gonna eat that?"), and the boys had ice cream. I had a water (I lose my appetite in the heat). We had a VERY enjoyable conversation. There are few people in the world that I could just talk to forever: My Mom is the first that comes to mind, then my best friend Dave, and now I must add Marci to that list. She is intelligent, amusing and just plain fun. After we continued on our way to Lake Selmac, Eric and I decided that we MUST invite them both to a barbeque at our house soon.  At the picnic/potluck/swap meet, there was the usual assortment of hams (most of them much older than Eric and myself), their wives and the single nerds. It was a nice place to have a get-together like this, and the weather really wasn't too bad. It was 87 degrees when we got their and under the canopy it was pleasantly breezy. There was a new huge play area nearby for the boys to play on, too. However, one of the main reasons I could never live anyplace like this: WASPS/HORNETS/BEES/FLYING ANTS were everywhere. I HATE that. They get into the food, and you can't leave your soda can unattended without getting a mouth full of stingers. My kids aren't used to them and so they freak out. Bring me back when it is cooler and the critters are hibernating. Next year maybe we could have it at the coast?  It was still fun. We bought our share of raffle tickets, won a little car as a door prize and Eric bought an antenna. Then, Johnny Jones GAVE him about twenty more used antennas! Yikes. Oh, and my best friend Dave was there. He was pretty burnt out from his recent trip along the Lost Coast, but I always enjoy his company.  We followed Dave home and he took us by way of the one-lane little-known short cut that avoids the 199 and seven miles of Caves Highway to his house. I saw cache hiding spots everywhere! Then we kept going up Caves Hwy to Little Greyback and retrieved the "Gone Bughouse" Geocache that we placed their Oct. of 2001. It had only seven hits in that time, so we'll recycle it. We stopped briefly at Dave's, found another cache on the way back to the 199, had dinner at Taylor's and drug our happy, warm butts home.  Is it bedtime yet?
