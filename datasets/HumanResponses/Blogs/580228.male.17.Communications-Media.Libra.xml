      If you're happy and ya know it clap your hands..... I am feelin reeeely good right now. The week is mostly over and tomorrow I'm probably going to go see "Frailty" with a friend.  It looks really good.  Well, it pretty much has to be since it is by Stephen King!!!!  I can't wait to see it.  About that Algebra test...it was easy!  I'll tell you what I got later!

      Flustered and annoyed... Well,  I'm mostly flustered because I have an Algerbra test next period and guess how much studying I've done, yeah, that's right, none, zip, zero.  And I'm annoyed with myself because, well, I've been slacking off a little bit.  I don't know maybe it's just the nice weather.  Gotta run.

      No scorpion King..just a couple friends and an Awesome Blossom Well...I didn't see the Scorpion King :( , but I did do something else!  After much confusion, and bickering (long story), Matt, Kelly and I went to the mall!  It was tons of fun!!!!  We went to Barnes and Noble and the printer on the machine went psycho, and we were cracking up.  Then we went to Chile's and had an Awesome Blossom for the first time and it was definately Awesome!  Only like six weeks left of skool!!!!  Well, gotta run! P.S  A friend told me that the Scorpion King was dumb :) HA HA.  I saw Kiss of The Dragon on Sunday it was very good, but not for the faint of heart (lotta language and blood and violence)

      The Scorpion King I can't wait to get outta school!  @ Like se7en I'm gonna go see the Scorpion King with some friends.  It's supposed to be pretty good.  I liked the other two Mummy movies and I assume that the prequel will be really good to.  I'm half done with the day (thank God).  I'm 183 pages into Hearts In Atlantis and I still have a long way to go.  It's getting purty good though.  I'll let you know how the Scorpion King was later.  Cya

      Strange Happenings Wowwww, I just turned my check for driver's ed to the middle school office, and the lady was really nice (what a refreshing change).  Then I found out the she's my bus driver's wife!  It was kinda weird.  OK yeah I know it's not that exciting, but when you live where I live, almost anything can strike you as exciting!  It's still really nice out!

      9,10,11,12,1,2,3,4/11 In case you haven't noticed, it's the 7 month anniversary of the September 11th attacks.  Kinda sad, but kinda happy because, well we're still cleaning up, but we're still here, and the attacks just made us stronger.  The first real play performance is tonight, and I'm kind nervous, cuz I didn't do so well on parents night.  DEEEEEP BREATHS....ahhh

      Hmmmmmm.... I'm at play practice right now but I'm not feeling especially motivated at the moment.  Today was OK at school, 'sept for people in the sophomore hall saying crap as I walk by.  People Like that really make me mad, but the best thing I can do is...well, ignore them.  Maybe it'll get through their thick skulls one day that it doesn't especially bother me!  Now that I'm done venting.....ummm...gotta run.

      Do Friendships die? Today hasn't been going the best.  Ever since Matt got his car and his Job at K-mart our friendship has been going slowly down the hole.  I don't want him to get mad that I posted this, but it really hurts.  He doesn't have any time for us anymore, besides Sarah.  That's the only person he ever does anything with anymore, and that's all that they can talk about.  "Last night was soooo much fun...oh sarah remember when..."  Everything must eventually die, I guess.  I used to think a friendship was the only thing that couldn't.  That even with the death of a friend, it still lived on, and I guess that part's true, but I think my friendship with Matt is getting sick.  Not enough attention has been paid to it, and It is slowly dying.  Why did this have to happen.  I guess It's just one of the many mysterious of life.

      Friiiiiiiiiiday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes It's finally friday.  Even though I missed a day this week, it has been going soooo ssslloooowwwwww...Today should be really fun.  I have an Algebra test, but that should be pretty easy.  Last night Erika came over and that was really fun.  She was hyper (as usual).  One thing I am mad about is last night when we went Garage-Saling and there was a really nice three wheeler, and I looked at it and was thinking about buying but while I was convincing my parents to buy it some other guy got it!  It made me soooo mad!!!!!!!! Arggghhh, but now I'm OK.

      It's been so long Wow it's been a long time since I've posted!  It seems like so much has happened since then.  I finally wrote an opinion thingy and I hope that Erika will be able to put it on my site.  I had a boring friday last week, but Saturday was a lot of fun.  Our youth group had a senior banquet.  We went to Val's and laser quest.  It was a lot of fun (I already said that didn't I).  School has been pretty boring, but hey we only have like two weeks left.  I'm probably going to go to a lazer quest lock-in thing on the seventeenth, but I better hurry and get a spot in!  Wow a lot has really happened.

      Sorry peeps..... It has been so long since I've posted (again).........I am such a spacer!  And I am extremely lazy, but here I am posting.  I should be getting my "about me" done soon.  You also might not see the same site for much longer.  I'm hoping for "Spacebar 2.0" to get around soon!  Anyway my life has been pretty boring lately....but I am enjoying it.

      Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder Wow, 2 posts in one day?!  Well, it's important.  I have to get it off my chest.  GOTTA SPEAK OUT! Well, I just saw Shallow Hal for the first time.  It might've been a little bit offending, but it had a good moral.  It really spoke to me.  Well, anyway the main character, Hal was "hypnotized" by some tv person so that he would only see the inward appearance of people.  We all need that.  What you see is not always what you get.  If you see a "beauful" girl, do you know she's really nice, funny, smart?  NO!  Hollywood has poisened our minds so that we are blind to the real beauty in people.  Magazines, movies, the internet, they're feeding it to us.  Girls see Britney Spears, and they want a body like that.  Guys see Vin Deisel , and they want a body like that.  Our mentality is that if we have a great body, we'll get attention, friends, and love.  It's human nature, but if we look inside people we see something much more.  We see true beauty, the kind that makes us feel true love.  So next time you see someone.  Don't judge them by their weight or their height etc., because you may overlook something.  You might regret it. Deeeeep breath......ok I'm done now.

      Hoping.....praying......wishing...... Oh Spacebar 2.0 where art thou?  Did thy master neglect thee?  Did thoust hide because of thy hideous face?  Oh thoust wilst soon be beautiful.  Soon shall thy master banish the CTS from thy front page.  Soon shalst thy front page be white and lovely, laced with flash animation! Yes my friends this is true.  No more will you have to look at the CTS on my front page.  It's cool, don't get me wrong, but I am getting quite tired of it!  I have been begging Erika to get it done, but she has so much work to do.  It will be done in time.  And then it might not be so lonely!!!!

      Sheesh... Man am I sorry to the whole 4 people that visit spacebar.  It has been so long since I posted!  Spacebar 2.0 will come...do not worry!  Hopefully this sunday Erika and I will be able to get it up. I passed driver ed so late september I suggest you all stay at home!  Because I'll be loose and no one's stopping me bwahaha...ehem.  Anyway, I'm gald thats over because I NEVER WANT TO TO THAT AGAIN.  Driver ed was soooo borring. I finally got to go to Worlds Of Fun.  It was so awesome.  If anybody wonders, I love roller-coasters and such.   Sonshine 2002 was ever so fun.  There should be some pictures of it on the new site whenever that rolls around.  I got to go with 4 totally awesome people, they made it so much fun.  The last night was spent trying to find ways to sneak into the "dance" and racing eachother in cardboard boxes....oh yeah...and leeching free slushies off of vendors. I went to Minnesota last week and had an amazing time!  We spent 2 nights in this awesome cabin.  I'll get pictures of that too.  We went kyaking, tubing, and biking on this really neat trail.  It was my Granny's 80th birthday. 5-Day clubs are almost over:-(  This could be my last day, but I might teach another one.  They've been so much fun Thanks to all of the people that actually come to my lonely little site.  Come back soon for Spacebar 2.0!!!!!!

      And now for my favorite day.... It's friday, IT'S FRIDAY!  This makes me ever so happy, because I get to stay up late, and sleep in.......anyway, I may be going overboard, but you do have to admit that fridays rock!  Brandon might be coming over tonight, and tomorrow is the homecoming dance(I'm very excited about that!).....anyway...that's a rap! O_o

      Thank you for fall... Ahh my favorite season now approaches!  I like everything about fall, the colors, the clothes.....it's just the best season!  As fall begins the musical ends, and I'm now left with not much to do, but observe God's beauty, and that's fine with me.  Pretty soon here, I'll be able to start scaring people at the Roca Berry Farm, with my school club which should be ever so fun.  I'll be able to hang out with my friends more often and let most of the stress just....float away. I just bought the new Coldplay album, "A Rush Of Blood to the Head."  It's very nice to listen to and, "lyrically intruiging."  I would have to give it at least a 9 out of 10. My birthday approaches (on homecoming!) which means, it's time for Seth to drive on his own, it should be fun, but I'm worried about all the costs :-(.  Ahh worry is pointless, for now I'll just relax.  Anyway, that's a rap.

      Every earthly thing must come to an end sometime or rather....... This is now the last showing of our play.  It's been so much fun, but I am so glad that it's over.  It was a lot of work.  We made mistakes, we were lectured, and we fixed them.  We were told to put energy into our performances, and the last couple of times..........we did, but today, we must put our full selves into it.  I know we can do it. That speech must end also!  Yesterday went well, and.......oh yeah, I have a homecoming date.  ERIKA!  Yeahhhhh!!!!

      Follow up.... Well, the play went very well!  The crowd seemed to really like it.  I think it's good that we did a popular musical like this one!  After the show, we went to Old Chicago, which is my favoritist restaurant ever!  It was quite fun, the musical group is so great, anyone who has never been involved in theatre, I suggest you try it, especially One-Acts.  You get to miss a lot of school with One-Acts ; Erika said she'd be coming tonight to watch the show with Morganna.  I can't wait=)

      Now That I actually have time to post...I think Well anyway, so I just can't stop gazing at Erika's lovely creation!  It's soo cool!  Tonight is the first real showing of the Musical.  We will be performing "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."   It should be good.  I'm stressed beyond all else, but I should be out of it soon.  Tonight should be fun.  As Erika said, please keep checking back for Spacebar 2.0.  See ya!

      Ok...and now the follow-up! So.....JA spent the night and we stayed up till like 4 am..it was very fun.  He also stayed over for the entire saturday..jeeze...and surprisingly I didn't get tired of him(j/k JA).  We went out to this "haunted" house by Roca and did some exploring..it was interesting.  We didn't really find anything haunting, but it was interesting, none the less.  Then on saturday night we had to go to scare people at the Roca Berry Farm, that wasn't exactly fun, but at least JA was there so it wasn't tooooo bad.  Sunday I got my car stereo, it's awesome, I'll probably get up a link to it later, and that was pretty much it.  It was an AWESOME weekend.  I LOVE SNOW!!!!!

      4 days = 4 times the fun! I just had one of the best four days of my life!  The school so graciously gave us a fall break.  It was soooo great.  Thursday I went to the FCClA convention with my schools club and that was really fun.....I wish you all could've seen Kelly and her "Hair" Dance, she was so awesome.  Then on friday it was Jen's birthday party so I was looking forward to that all day and I had to wait for JA (grrr) to get to my house and he was an hour late, but that's ok.  We went to Old Chicago and I had one of those awesome meat calzones.  Then me and JA went to east park to buy our tickets for "The Ring".  I definately reccomend that movie to anyone who likes a good scare.  I had been looking forward to it for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed!  JA and I both really enjoyed that movie. Oh darn...I g2g...more later..

      Gloomy weather...gloomy day What do you do when you're in a rut like I am?  When you feel like your friends have abandoned you and you have to wander the hallways alone....when you feel alone.  When they're always right and of course I'm wrong.  I'm a murderer, because I'm not doing what they want, but when I wanted them there, they didn't show.  What should I do.  What would you do?

Thursday I plan to go to the district FCCLA convention, which should be fun.  Friday, I get to sleep in!!!!!  At night is Jen's birthday party, and I plan to go to see "The Ring" which looks like a very, very, scary and good movie.  I've been waiting to see it  since like june!  I hope to see Erika again soon, we actually got farther in Oddworld which we haven't played for around a year and a half.  I can't wait for break!

It's been fun so far.  It was a good thanksgiving.  I ATE WAY TOO MUCH, but that's what you're supposed to do, right?  Break went way too fast, but that's OK cause Christmas break is soon so that's a plus!  More later!

      Egore speaks.... Well yet again the mad scientist and her assistant are working on another experiment and Spacebar 2 shall be its name.  Yup, I decided Erika was a "mad scientist" last night as she toyed with my ideas for the new Spacebar.  She had no trouble taking my ideas from paper and making them look amazing (of course).  And I Egore stood hunched over by the computer giving suggestions and making comments as she created our monster.  It's gonna be really cool.  It should make my whole 4 faithful vistors happy too, because I can update my gallery and opinion pages much easier.  I can't really show you, but if you've seen the No Doubt, Rock Steady album cover then that should give you a good idea (just think darker (bwahahaha!))  Anyways, Egore needs his rest.  Goodnight!

      I guess I'll do the same thing as Erika...write some Superchic[k] lyrics...the first verse is so much like me it's scary  This song really hit me.  Not just the fact that first verse was almost an accurate description of my life at school, but the fact that I do the same thing to other people.  "No one sits with him He doesn't fit in But we feel like we do  And we make fun of him Cuz you want to belong Do you go along? Cuz his pain is the price Paid for you to belong It's not like you hate him or want him to die But maybe he goes home and thinks suicide Or he comes back to school with a gun at his side And a kindness from you might have saved his life  Heroes are made when you make a choice....."   Thanks to my friends....my heroes, you saved my life.

      I dunno.... It was kinda scary, I guess...I mean for some odd reason I wasn't really worried.  I'll I can remember thinking was "How is this going to feel?"  As we were swerving down that gravel road, and Jennifer was freaking out, I wasn't.  On the way down the ditch, I wasn't worried.  And this may sound preachy, but maybe it was my subconcious saying, "Seth, you don't have to worry, you're in bigger hands."  We're all alright, that's all that really matters.  Jennifer has a nice car, and the front was bent up a little bit, so she got freaked out, but never the less the fact that Jennifer and I both got out without any injuries is the biggest part.  I don't know, I feel really weird about this. It's bugging me for some odd reason.  Maybe it was my dream last night that I got my car stuck in a pond.....hmmm....

      A toiling cauldron of emotions.... So our One Act won Districts tonight...and I was really happy.  We did a good job, and not to be cocky, but we deserved it.  But i'm not extremely happy at the moment.  Actually I feel really...well I can't put a finger on it.  I'll just say it, because I'm tired of people not knowing.  I'm afraid.  I'm afraid of people.I'm afraid of what they think about me.  I'm afraid of their assumptions.  I have this form of sociophobia or something.  I thought I was getting better at this, not being so afraid of rejection that is.  I've made some friends, but I still feel like a nobody.  If I just disappeared no one would really notice.  I feel invisible half of the time and no matter how many friends I have and no matter how many times I say I don't care what people think, I do.  And when I hear what people might say about me, or to me it's a smack in the face.  I mean, it's bad enought thinking that people don't like you, but knowing they don't is like a dagger in the heart.  I don't know what I'm saying really....I guess it will all look better in the morning, but for right now I'll just sit here and bleed, lick my wounds and move on.  After all this isn't anything new for me.

      All things are possible.... Why the self doubt?  Why the feeling that I won't be able to do it?  I don't know, the whole Idea of doing something as "extreme" as graduating my junior year seems pretty tough.  IF there's a chance that I'll be allowed to do it, I'm going to try it.  All my friends are Juniors and the thought of not seeing them all of my senior year is just too much.  Even Erika will graduate before me, and then go off to some college just east of Guam!  I just don't want to be alone.  Do I depend on my friends too much?  I just know I need them with me at school.  I looked around the table today at all these great people, my friends and then it struck me, next year will probably be last year with them.  It can't be that way, I won't let it.

      No, I'm not on Prozac Hello everyone!  I hope everyone is doing fine, why the overly optimistic mood, you ask? Weeeellll, I guess I'm just feeling fine, and not worrying about much.  Tonight is youth group, and gee whilickers, I can't wait for that.  I'm still in the learning process of HTML I guess, but I'm sure I'll get it pretty soon.  It's actually kinda fun.  Erika needs to blog, yes she does....why won't that girl blog?

      Well...maybe not Ok...so maybe this site will be around for a while more.   Last night, Erika and I worked on it a little more....so there is hope!  But after probably just look for a series of Blogs, opinions, journal, and poetry.  I think that would be much easier on both Erika and me!   Spacebar 2.0 will hopefully be free of bugs like the last one and will be more easily updated.  I just hope we can get it up soon.  *crosses fingers*  Hey Erika....how about comments??!!

      Hmmm.... Well, last night I had a short discussion with Erika about the fate of this site and it doesn't look good.  Here are just a few reasons why I think this site will probably not be around too much longer.  1.No one visits it!  Why have a site that a whole 2 people visit? 2.It isn't updated enough....first in the area of blogging and second in the area of a new site layout 3.Erika really doesn't seem to care about it and I don't blame her, I mean she has enough to do with her own site

      Time to start over! I kind of thought that the idea of new year's resolutions was pretty dumb, but now I'm finding that it's helped me to feel better...here's a list of a few New Year's resolutions!  Get fit and stay that way! Become closer to Jesus Christ Be a better friend to those who aren't very friendly And to get better grades  That's about it, but I'm sure more will pop up!

      .....And a Happy New Year I'm at Erika's (no surprise there).  I just spent my New Year's Eve/Day at Erika's house.  They had like a ton of people over from church and it was actually a lot of fun.  Erika seemed to think it was her sole responsibility to make us laugh at 5 in the morning when everyone else was trying to sleep.  It was very funny, in a weird kind of way.  Anyways, Happy New Year!

      Just thinking.... I don't know what my problem is, but I just seem to have this weird feeling lately.  I have a serious problem with jealousy that I need to get over.  I see all of these people in my youth group and I always want to be like them, part of their groups or cliques or whatever you call them.  I guess I myself am kind of in a clique, but it's kind of the uncool clique.  I just need to keep telling myself that thinking like that is stupid.  If I were popular, outgoing, or overly friendly than I wouldn't be me.  I was made this way and I have to accept that.  If I hadn't had these experience I wouldn't be able to write in a way that empathizes with those who feel the way I do, and to show the world how I feel.  God made me this way and that's fine.

Am I invisible to them? Am I beyond recconection?  It's okay to be this way I guess To be disconnected  I must accept it I must learn to be Disconnected

      Okay, now it's time to tell about the awesome weekend.  It all started on friday.  I got home from school and then only had a little bit of time before we were hauled off to the Dare 2 Share, which was schweeeet!  In a nutshell Dare 2 Share is a conference where on learns to share his faith with other people.  One of my best friends, J.A. went along with, so that made it better too. Friday night at the confrence was pretty good, but the drama was pathetic in comparison to last year's.  Oh and guess where we ate?  BURGER KING, uggghhh.  That place needs to die.  I hate that restaurant with a passion.  I think i'll write up some kind of petition to close that place forever!  Anyway.  J.A. stayed on friday and then we went to the Saturday conference, which was even better.  Just walking around downtown Lincoln is one of the funnest things.  There's a lot of cool things to see, despite the creepy allies.  Saturday was the concert.  Sanctus Real, John Reuben, Pillar, Relient K, and the Supertones were all there.  Pillar was the best.  They put on one of the most amazing concerts I have ever seen, and I've been to   a lot  of concerts, believe me.  And just to show how much I liked the concert I bought a "Pillar rocks my face off shirt" I liked Relient K the second most.  The others were just okay.  Oh yeah...and guess where we went to eat for lunch?  BURGER KING!  Are you feeling my pain?!  Why do people love that place so much?  Yes, petition....please  urlLink E-mail me! .  J.A. stayed again on Saturday and then went to church with us.  I finally saw the two towers.  It was pretty excellent, but it's had its problems.  I would give it a 8 out of 10 mostly because it drug on too long.  But they did an excellent job with Gollum.  First of all the cgi was pretty sweet, but they gave him lots of character.  And then I finally slept!  And that was my weekend.  Someone tell me why I can't have an infinite weekend please!

      Keriann has inspired me to construct a top ten list of the most annoying things....this may take a while!  10.When your yawns get stuck (oh come on!  You know what I'm talking about!) 9.Britney Spears/Christina Aigulara (Put some clothes on!) 8.Posers (I'm in danger for saying this...cause I could be considered a poser myself) 7.People who think looks are everything (For pete's sake....get over it!  "Ugly" people have souls too!) 6.Conspirating teachers (Hey!  I'm serious! If you had 4 tests/quizzes in one day....you'd have the right to be suspicous! Most high schoolers can relate.) 5.The 80's (*Shudders*....big hair, the "punk" movement, annoying music.  The only good thing is that I was born!) 4.Middle schoolers who hang out at the mall and think they're cool (maybe I'm being to harsh, but please....stay at the skating rink) 3.Movie critics or just critics in general (do they just like disagreeing with the teen population on everything or is just me?) 2.Incessant beeping or clicking noises (do I really need to explain?!) And for the final and most annoying thing on my list.... 1.High pitched yipping (I have to live with this every day!  My parents just love this dog, but he is sooo annoying!!!  I have great suspicion that I may be replaced!)

      Tension is a passing note...I hope this one passes quickly Today has been sort of a struggle for me.  It started off okay.  I found out I got a 97 on my english test and that was all good and fine, but then I got to spanish.  It started off with an awful quiz (11/20) and then I got my verb sheets back and found out that I got a 17/25!  That's barely passing.  I thought I'd do well on those, too.  That means there's a good chance I'll be stuck at home all weekend, unless my parents let this one go.  It's a four day weekend too!  I hope this bad stuff doesn't last to long.  In the Sixpence None The Richer song it says that tension is to be loved when it is a passing note to a beautiful chord.  I'm pretty sure they're right.

      Just so you know.... The new East West cd "Vintage" is in da house!  It's a sampler of some of their stuff from the independet album and for a bonus, it's remixed and remastered to sound totally amazing!  If you like hard stuff and some nifty variety, go and pick one up, or two....or even three if you feel the need.  It's only ten bucks, people!  And it will ROCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!!!  Trust me.  Oh and look for the  all new  East West album in June.

      Too Funny.... OK, I think I've just found my new favorite show!  It's called Clone-High USA.  It sounds really weird, but that's what makes it soooo funny.  It's about this High School made up entirely of clones.....of famous history characters like, Joan of Arc, Abe Lincoln, JFK, even Moses(!!???!!), oh yeah and you can't forget about Ghandi.  Well, Shane and I were watching it and Marilyn Manson (animated of course) guest starred as a rockstar/nutritionist(!!??).  He started singing about all the food groups and the last line was like, "And make sure you limit yourself to three servings of sweets a day otherwise you'll.....DIIIIIEEE!!!!!!" and he turned back into that good ol psycho, yet intelligent athiestic rock star.  Shane and I laughed for about a half-hour straight!  You've got to watch this show, it's too funny to pass up.

       Cough, cough...  This weekend started out really great, but it turned into poo when I got sick.  This is the first day of the week I went to school.  I feel really unmotivated and I would rather not do my homework, but if I don't I'll end up failing.  And I must do well this quarter, because I have to get rid of these icky grades. Also, I'm really sick and tired of hearing about the war.  That's all I heard yesterday.  My mom had the radio on to the local public radio and it was news about the war...ALL DAY!  And I'm also tired of hearing the celebrities protesting the war.  I know that most people are against it, and I respect that.  War is evil, but it's a necessary evil.  We can't just sit around and wait for things to get better on their own.  His people have been oppressed for too long.  When a leader uses his own innocent people as shields for his buildings, it's pretty much decided that something has to be done.

      Why?! After watching O Brother Where Art Thou again I seemed to have acquired a new obsession with bluegrass music!  This is truly frightening!  I've downloaded "Hard Time Killin' Floor Blues" from that soundtrack (which Erika needs to burn for me) and "Long Time Gone" from the Dixie Chicks album, Home.  And it probably won't stop there!  Do not be deceived, I still greatly dislike country!  But this stuff just....really agrees with my ears.  It's always fun to discover something new about yourself, I never thought I would actually like this kind of music!

      This Is All to Scary "The name of Seth creates an overly-sensitive nature which causes you to sense and feel far more than you can understand or put into words. You have a deep, artistic, and creative side which shows through a love for music and literature. Writing is a more natural mode of expression for your deeper thoughts and feelings than the spoken word. You have an ability to concentrate and work intently on anything which holds your interest. However, you prefer to avoid routine, monotony, and mental tasks. You enjoy the out-of-doors and find your greatest peace and relaxation from the beauty and harmony of nature. You prefer to limit your friendships and associations to those who share your interests and appreciate your quiet, refined ways. Others often find it difficult to understand you. Your feelings tend to build up within you and, if you cannot release them through a creative, constructive channel, you could suffer with frustration, moods, and much inner turmoil."-PressAnyKey.com

      Ranting Time! Okay....I've been wanting to write about this for quite some time.  So here goes.  I was at Fazoli's, a great Italian restaurant in Lincoln, and I became very annoyed.  As I'm walking in I am greeted by the great aroma of the place, but it is suddenly ruined by what I saw next.  Instead of some clean, nicely dressed employee, I see some greasy old man (the manager I think) arguing with his wife over I have no idea what.  And in between "Well, then go make your own sandwich!!" I made out a "What can I get you."  Although I don't know how.  And his wife wasn't much better.  This is pothetic!  Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent.  But the fact that I was waited on by a greasy woman in the middle of an argument with her partner is repulsive.  What happened to the days that I hear about?  The days when people actually cared about service, even if it wasn't at an expensive restaurant are no longer here, my friends.  Next time, put an outfit on that doesn't make me want to puke, and save the argument for later!

Therefore I am justified in my suspicion that there are, in fact tiny gnomes running around my house stealing things and taking them back to their villiages.  I must buy some gnome killer.

      Sigh.... Last night was fun.  I went to Keri's house and watched a movie.  A bunch of other people were there, which was good.  It made it.....interesting.  It kind of bothered me how much gossiping was going on, though.  Not that I don't find myself doing it, but this was kind of overboard.  People kept talking about all of the people that had problems and what they were....etc.  It just bothered me because when I really thought about it, would I really want people talking about me like that?  And people do, so I figure that there's no point stooping to their level.  There are plenty of other things to talk about,  I guess, gossiping is just more fun.

      I didn't have school today so I stayed up until 3 last night.  I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to, so I worked on my novel.  Yes, I'm writing one.  I think I'll call it PSYCHOPHOBIA.  What's it about?  Read on. Simon finds himself deeply disturbed.  He can't sleep.  He can't eat.  He doesn't even want to go out in public, because he fears that it will happen.  This is why he turns to Anna, pyschologist, to help him in his great struggle.  Anna finds herself so wrapped up in trying to save Simon that she herself begins to suffer.  Anna must find the key to free Simon.  If she doesn't, it will happen. BWAHAHAHA!!  I hope I can actually get this one done!  Yeah, my plans for life:Write my first novel before I'm on out of High School, get so rich I don't need to go to College and  go move into the mountains and write for the rest of my life!

      Who says you have to do stuff on the weekend? Last night was fun.  Erika, Morganna and I went to the Norris vs. Pius BB game.  It was great being with them, but I was getting kind of annoyed.  It was pretty packed at the game and we had to keep moving up rows just to make way for the popular people (ugghh).  I mean seriously, if you want a good seat, come early!  It's not that hard, but I guess if you have the power to do whatever you want....exercise it.  I really don't have a lot against those people, a lot of them are actually really great.  Society has always been this way and always will.  The people who are more liked will always get first grabs on all the good stuff.  And that's okay.

      Chicago:9/10 Synopis: Roxie Hart played by Renee Zellweger is a girl with a dream of being a show girl.  Her idol played by Catherine Zeta Jones has just murdered her boyfriend and her sister.  When Roxie Hart finds that her boyfriend didn't get her the gig she wanted she shoots him....several times.  Roxie is sent to murderess row in the chicago jail where she meets her idol who has just been jailed for the murder of her husband and sister.  Now it's a race to see who can get the most attention.  A Chicago lawyer (Richard Gere) who has never lost a case is determined to free Roxie, just as long as he gets his side of the deal.  Will Roxie be proven innocent or guilty?  You'll have to watch Chicago to find out. Review: This movie is pretty amazing.  The dancing and singing is terrific and the acting is oscar worthy.  I wouldn't be surprised to see that movie win a lot of the 13 oscars it is nominated for.  It deserves it.  The PG-13 rating is there for a reason folks.  There's a lot of skin and cursing.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  Maybe it's not your style, but it's a lot of fun to watch.  Hey, try something new!

       I See Dead People!  Okay...maybe I was in Mexico too long, but our Church has zero enthusiasm.  The worship services at camp were so much fun.  Our church sits and stares.  Oh...and once in a while they might just clap.  I have nothing against the worship team, I think they're trying their hardest, but no one seems like they really want to be there.  One of these days, I'm just going to start clapping and dancing.  Pardon me, old fogies, that dancin' sinner is starting a revival.  Sorry I'm not your cup o' tea.

       Thoughts  This week's been tough.  Getting back to school was a big shock.  People are so...boring here.  In Mexico everyone waves to you.  In America if you wave to someone, you'll either get shot or flipped off.  In Mexico everyone smiles, and is happy with their dump pile houses, here people glare...and want, want, want.  I'd like to stay there forever.  I missed my friends, but I didn't miss the real world.  If heaven is anything like this...I can't wait.  I know it'll be even better, which is hard to imagine.

       I'll NEVER Forget This  I just got back from the most amazing experience ever.  I can't believe I was actually having second thoughts about going to Mexico!  I wouldn't give my experience up for all the money in the world.  I learned much more than I taught and I thank God for leading me where he did. I left on friday at 4:30 in the afternoon for a very long bus trip.  The bus was nice but the seats were unkind to my rump and I had lots of trouble sleeping, but I'm kind of glad I was awake.  I was able to see so many interesting things.  The night desert gave me chills, just because it's so huge and somehow myserious.  We watched a couple movies on the way down there which killed some of the time. On Saturday night we crossed the Mexican border which was quite the thrill and I was transported into a whole new world.  Only about a third of the businesses I saw were actually open.  The rest were boarded up and spotted with graffiti.  Instantly a sense of fear was instilled in me.  I was afraid because this was something very new to me.  It woke me up to the fact that I am a selfish person.  These people build houses out of whatever they can find and all I do is want, want, want. We got to camp fairly late and set up our tents and I finally slept.  It was a good night's sleep.  Curse the bus chairs! On sunday we began our first real day working with the Mexican children.  I was a little lost at first, but I made some friends despite the language barrier.  A word about that...it was tough to tell what they were saying, but in a way it made it much more interesting.  It taught me how to show what I was trying to say via emotions.  EMOTIONS ARE A BLESSING BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO LANGUAGE! I won't tell you about every day because it'll take too long, but I made good friends with a little boy named Santiago at the church and Jorge at El Camp which is where we played games and just hung out.  Spending the week with those kids and all the others was really cool.  If you gave them a papoochi (piggy back ride) they were happy.  That was the neatest thing in the world.  These kids have basically nothing and if you can make them laugh it's like giving them the whole world. The end of the week came too soon.  I said my goodbyes to Santiago at the church and we traded our wooden heart name tags.  I hope he remembers me and comes back next year.  Then we went to El Campo and I played frisbee with Jorge one last time.  After El Campo and a little break we went for an evening service at the Solidaridad church.  Jorge gave me about a million hugs and that was it.  I couldn't hold back the tears anymore.  I'm gonna miss those kids.  Jorge made sure that I would come back and play frisbee with him next year.  And we drove off.  And we headed to California for a day at the beach which was lots of fun.  And now I'm home after another long bus trip...I missed you all!

       Been a Long Time...  Yeah...mostly the reason I haven't blogged is because nothings been happening!  This week was soooo looong.  And thank God it's over!  So yeah...that means that Erika and I must do something fun.  Let's go clubin'...okay?  Except for the fact that Lincoln is lamo and therefore contains basically no fun and exciting things to do...so we shall go see a movie.  Chicago maybe?  Also I leave for Mexico in a week which is very scary and I don't know If I'll be ready.

       Update  Well...I think I've got this whole thing cleared up.  I plan to go to branson tomorrow which should be great.  But right now I have to get ready to leave for Applebee's.  I have a big favor to ask all of my visitors.  Please go to the  urlLink Pillar website  and check out the e-card and support them by requesting them in your local area.  This is their crossover into the secular market under the MCA record label.  They are a great band.  I really want to see them succeed.

       Why?!  Why in the world do my friends have to be so dramatic!  Don't get me wrong, I love 'em, but they can't let anything slide!  Everything has to be a big deal.  Supposedly I never hang out with them O_o  Except for the fact that I was with them all night last saturday.  Oh well.  See, I can let things slide.  I'm not going to get all riled up.  I'm also supposed to stay away from them from now on I guess.  Sigh...I wonder how long this one will take.

       Today Was *yawns* Good  Today was allright.  I woke up way too early.  My dad practically had to drag me out of bed for church.  Oh, exciting news.  I won tickets for the concert this week!!  I'm going all the way for MXPX, the others (New Found Glory, Good Charlotte) are good, MXPX is da shiz.  Anyway, after church my parents I went and saw  A Mighty Wind  which was really great.  I may review it in depth later.  It was the funniest movie I 've seen in a long time, actually.  After I got home I hit some graduation parties with Keri and Morgan.  I'm really exhausted, but I'll end up staying up late anyway.

Thank God I get to do something tonight...I got grounded tomorrow because "I was stealing all the pens and pencils in the house" and I was trying to defend myself!  Sigh...I'll tell you how it was.

       Evil Butterflies  I know this is no big deal, but I have musical tryouts tonight!  I have this great fear of the directors just bursting out in laughter at my voice.  I've got evil butterflies in my stomach and that's probably how it will be ALL day.  Oh, by the way I recently added a review to Switchfoot's new album "The Beautiful Letdown".

       Listen Up!  Okay I apologize to my friends who may feel offended by what I say, but Lucas is right.  It's his right If he wants to use that language on  his  website!  Lucas doesn't come to mine and get angry because I post prayer requests and he's an agnostic...so I believe he deserves the same respect for being an agnostic that I do for being a Christian.  I don't hold Lucas' vocabulary against him, once you get to know him you find out that he's not all that bad, VERY CYNICAL, but not all that bad ;-).  So, please stop.

       Woot!  Yesterday was lots of fun.  After School I got my work done and was planning to go see X2 and pick up my tux, but I found out the bill was outreageous, 91.95!!!  So Jennifer and I went in and got the price lowered to what the lady told us in the first place.  They tried to charge us 12 dollars for a pair of shoes!  But it ended up being only around 74 dollars in the end :-).  After that Justin and I went and saw Anger Management because X2 was sold out, very funny but very gross at times.  Jack Nicholson did a good job as usual.  I'll probably review it in depth later.  After the movie he and I went to Pizza Hut and stuffed our faces.  Blech...I felt like I was going to explode, but it was darn good pizza.  Oh, almost forgot, I was bored at Best Buy (Morganna was being slow as usual) so I bought the new Switchfoot album.  IT ROCKS!  Plus it was only ten bucks!  Yahoo for prom being tonight.

       Life is Good  I know recently the issue of people blogging simply on what they did this weekend or are planning on doing was brought up, but should I care?  There are no rules on how to blog.  If this site doesn't interest you then I just gave you something to complain about!  That should make you happy! So I will tell the story of last night.  Morgan, Erika, and I decided to just go drive around lincoln.  We did the old favorite of flip-a-coin choose a direction.  That was fun but got old after a while.  We ended up in the same place a lot anyway.  We were hungry so we went to Taco Inn because they had free chip night.  We got our nachos and tacos and then decided to go see Morgan's new house.  So we were off.  Being able to drive is the best thing in the world.  Out on the open road with no parents, no rules, no worries.  Just tunes and a couple friends.  Now that's the good life.  So we got to Morgan's house and hung out there for a while and decided to go to the lake.  It was beautiful!  We went out and sat on the dock and just watched the boats at the fall of the day.  Threw rocks in the lake and talked.  Erika summed it up perfectly when she said "Life is good"  It was good to get away.

       Zoom Zoom  I've been riding the bike a lot lately.  I'm having trouble with the whole shifting thing.  Still not quite used to it.  My dad got me a helmet so I'm allowed to ride it.  I don't want to have to get a license for it cause I would probably make so many mistakes on my test.  I'm still a little afraid of driving that thing.  But it's waaaay too much fun.  I picked up Hail to the Thief from Radiohead today.  It's some pretty good stuff, although a little odd.  I'm still having post-camp odd feelings.

       Better Now  I feel sooo much better.  I talked to Keri after and that really took my mind off of what's been going on.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I am now the proud owner of a Kawasaki motorcycle.  My parents bought it while I was gone!  It's old but it runs.  I haven't ridden it yet, but I think I will pretty soon here.  I'm probably going to end up injuring myself but that's okay.  At least I got my bike!

       Home  Being home feels really weird.  I don't exactly feel like I should be here.  I don't know why.  Camp had its problems, but I'm going to miss those people so much.  I learned a lot while I was there.  God has shown me so much.  The night before I left in testimony time I asked everyone to pray for my family problems.  After that I talked to pastor musgrave.  Which was really great.  He helped me deal with a lot of the pain that I've kept inside.  I keep praying that things will get better.  Today was tough.  I got grounded already.  Maybe it's my problem.  If it isn't I can do my part.  I decided that I will be my mom's robot.  I am her work droid.  I will do as she pleases.  I will never speak my mind.  Things seem to work better that way.  Please pray for me.  Please.

I haven't even started packing yet,  but I'm going to get started on that soon enough.  Hope In Anguish from East West comes out tomorrow.  You should check them out also.

       *Shifty Eyes*  I added two new poems to the gallery.  And I'm risking my life to be blogging at the moment because my mom told me to get off the computer about 15 minutes ago and if she wakes up...sudden death.  Not much is going on.  I'm working on my summer reading.  I stayed for most of the day at Shane's on Tuesday.  It was much fun.  I may be going to Gretna to stay with A.J. and teach 5 day clubs.  That's about it.  Oh.  The urchins came over today.  It was very amusing.  I can't believe how big this family is getting.  5 little minions running around is very tiring.  Good night all.

       And now...My Life  Honesty.  That's all I want.  I'm tired of being fooled.  Maybe other people can see what I don't.  I guess I just have so much respect for this person that I'm blinded.  Does he think that I will hold an eternal grudge on him if he tells me about the stuff he does?  Is that it?  Just because I don't do that crap.  Because i'm a "straightedge" and he's not that doesn't mean he won't always be one of my best friends.  Is he so scared that I'll abandon him, is that it?  Or is it that I'll hound him constantly about what he does or how he's doing with these certain problems.  I just want the truth.  Sooner or later I would hear about it from someone else. I've got so many questions with answers floating somewhere off in another galaxy.  Truth, I just want the truth.

       M E X I C O:8  I think it's about time to end this.  I will probably write more if I ever decide to publish this or anything.  There is so much more to hear about, but this is exhausting me.  The end.  Today is the end of this journey.  I don't know what to feel really.  I get a hot shower tonight!  I'll be clean, but I'll be away from these kids.  No more papoochis.  No more frisbee with Jorge.  No more of Santiago's crazy laugh that I love.  This is it.  If I only knew how much this would torture me throughout the year.  If only I knew that I would think about Mexico every day, that I would dream about Mexico! We say goodbye to the kids from our church.  All the girls are crying.  Morgan comes out of the church, tears streaming down her face, "I don't want to leave them!"  Either do I.  I guess it just hasn't hit me yet.  But they're crowding around me, asking for just one more papoochi and it's killing me.  My back kills but I can't resist those little faces.  I give Santiago as much as he wants just to hear him laugh like he does.  The way he throws his head back and laughs like a crazy man. Goodbye.  Goodbye Santiago.  We trade our heart name tags.  It's still hanging in my room as a constant reminder of the place I love.  And he runs home.  I wonder if I will ever see him again.  I pray that he will be safe.  Goodbye Santiago. After that we go the other Church for a night service.  Our farewell service.  The way they sing is amazing. You have to hear this woman's voice to believe how amazing it is.  You have to watch them yourself to see how enthusiastic they are.  So alive.  Smiling and singing like they would never sing again.  I wish my church could be like this.  We have a 2000 dollar projector and all this high tech equipment and we can't be half that enthusiastic. The service goes on, but I barely listen.  I can only think about how we have to leave these kids.  They sing Jesus Loves me and that really does it.  I've been fighting back these stupid tears all day.  Jorge gives me a hug and I don't want to let go.  Almost everyone's crying.  I don't know how you couldn't.  You would have to have a heart of steel. We light some candles.  We sing a song.  And it's over.  Jorge keeps running and jumping into my arms.  Over and over again.  I don't want to let go.  But I have to.  Because it's the end.  The end.  Goodbye Mexico.  I left you, but you can't leave me.  You are everywhere.  Calling me back.  I'll see you soon.

       Dead End Moon by Kevin Max   As the sand shifts cool beneath your feet By the light of a dead end moon Your haunted fingers on my skin so sweet Your hair the darkest loom  Like a cherub left to gather moss Like a ship without its sail that's tossed Like a vassal to his kingdom lost My soul so pale  Oh my lonely heart Oh my soulless girl Will you ever let me go  I don't wanna cry no more And here I wander aimless I just want to find the cure To my growing weakness And the one who wanders is not lost My friend  From on top a Moorish wall i stand I see the valley stretching The mist of seas are pulling in From your cliff I'm stranded Embedded in your body deep Lie answers to the questions Like a garden hidden from the keep How long I've waited  Oh my lonely heart Oh my soulless girl Will you ever let me go  I don't wanna cry no more And here I wander aimless I just want to find the cure To my growing weakness  Oh dark mistress, my only salvation If only to hold you in blessed suspension Eyes that hold midnight, smile that brings out light Strange fascination, my only placation  I don't wanna cry no more And here I wander aimlessly I just want to find the cure To this infernal sadness  I would have to say this is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  Kevin Max writes the most amazing poetry also.  I put this song up because it is a little of what I have been feeling lately.  Please visit kevinmax.us.

       M E X I C O 7  Community service?  No.  I don't want to.  There's no clouds.  It's hot.  I'm already tired because i've been giving papoochis.  I want to go sleep or take a shower.  It's only monday, but I'm hot, dirty, and tired.  But it's not like we can refuse.  I figure I better.  So I do it. We get to the "field." Dirt.  Just like every other place in Mexico.  Dirt. Dirt. DIRT.  I've got dirt on my arms, on my legs, and on my face.  I can't tell if the ring around my wristband is tanline or a dirtline.  But I can't get away from the dirt so I guess I'll just have to live it in it for now.  It doesn't seem so trashed at first.  But then I notice the reflection of broken glass everywhere.  It's almost a canopy of broken glass.  A foot cannot avoid it.  We get our plastic sacks and start picking up the junk.  Junk everywhere.  Tires, glass, pipes, sticks, shoes, glass. Glass.  My sack is already torn from a metal piece I picked up.  I go back for another and another. The sun is so hot.  In the cloudless Mexican sky.  And then I smell it.  Something like old macaroni and cheese.  Invading my nostrils.  It's a horrible disgusting smell that doesn't go away.  All around me. I hear some commotion and go to see what exactly it is.  Two girls from our group are carying a dead dog with their shovels.  It's leg falls off.  Then I know what the smell is.  Dead dog.  Rotting dead dog.  Filled with maggots and worms.  The girls scream and run away so I decide to help them.  I look at the dead dog.  Teeth barred because of the sking being eaten away from its face.  Ribs showing and smudged red and black with blood and dirt.  Mexico is a rotting dog.  Mexico is desperation.  Mexico is alone. We take the dog to be buried with several others.  One's fairly fresh.  It makes me much sicker than the first.  So I leave to go help in another place.  This is the worst spot.  The bushes are each surrounded.  No.  Not with woodchips.  Trash.  Paper plates.  Clothing.  A combination of who knows what. There's so much.  So much trash.  Some Mexicans play soccer in the street.  I hate the World because the world doesn't care about them.  I hate myself for having what I have and not being happy with it.  I hate poverty.  I hate the hot sun.  I hate that smell.  I hate the smell of desperation.

       M E X I C O:6  We drive to the other church and hang out there for a while.  They get tacos, we don't.  Tacos sound really good and I want some.  But we only get peanut butter and jelly.  There's a house with a cement water tank outside.  The water in the tank is disgusting.  Green.  But a kid plays in it.  He doesn't know any bettter. I talk to my friends from the other Church.  We joke around as usual.  Justin makes his wisecracks and the girls chase him.  Kyle does his bloated stomach thing.  He's skinny but he does this thing where it makes him look pregant.  The girls laugh at him.  I wish I have something funny to say and that the girls would chase me.  But I don't have anything.  And they don't chase me.  (Sorry for the shortness of this one, but I can't decide if we went to El Camp that day or not!  I need help from my M E X I C O buddies!)

       M E X I C O:5  We drive on some more bumpy roads.  More people wave and I wave back.  Everyone seems to wave down here.  We drive and we drive.  I have to stand up in the RV because there's no room for me to sit.  I almost fall down sometimes because our driver makes fast stops and has a lead foot.  We get into a neighborhood.  We drive past a poster of Mary.  It's catholic I think.  We get out soon after that.  The church is in service.  I can hear singing and I like it a lot.  I peek inside the church and they all look at me.  That makes me a little embarassed so I hide around the corner. Church gets out soon enough and we go inside and set up our puppet stage.  The kids start to come.  They're all dark of course.  I am suprised because I thought they would all be skinny and starving, but some are fat.  None look like they are starving. I sit down behind a little boy with what looks like a boy scout shirt on.  He looks at me and I smile at him.  He tries to look outside but I block his view.  We make a game out of it.  I laugh because he plays along.  We start.  Maureen, our leader starts talking in Spanish and introduces us to the kids.  We sing and the kids love that.  They sing loud and proudly.  They smile and that makes me smile.  I can tell this is going to be a great week. The puppets start.  The kids love the puppets.  They make all of them laugh.  I laugh because they laugh even though I don't know what the puppets are saying.  It's time for our drama.  I dread that because I barely know my spanish.  I can't pronounce my 'a's.  I get up in front of the kids and I get nervous and sweaty.  I barely know what I'm saying.  We have barely practiced these dramas and I can't pronounce my 'a's.  I struggle through my script.  Nate corrects me and that makes me angry.  I don't like people to correct me.  I especially don't like him correcting me because he makes me feel stupid.  We finish and I sit down in relief. We work on crafts and other things with the kids.  They also have to recite a memory verse.  An older boy just wants the candy even though he knows the verse.  He says it and I give him candy, but he wants more.  He jokes around with me.  He has an attitude, but I think it's funny.  He acts tough and we joke about fighting. It's time to go play outside.  It's hot out.  No suprise.  I play frisbee with a little boy.  Some kids ask for Papoochis which our piggy back rides.  I can't resist their little faces even when i'm tired and hot and i've already given so many papoochis.  I'm already in love with all of them because they don't care about Nintendo or Playstation or computers or anything like that.  They just want a papoochi. We ask them questions that are on a sheet.  I don't like doing that.  Because the kids don't understand me and I don't understand them so we skip the questions.  They talk to eachother.  I try to talk to them.  Even though I know only un poco espanol. Maureen tells the kids goodbye and that we'll be there tomorrow.  We get on the RV and some people are already making sandwhiches.  We're all exhausted and hungry so we eat a lot.  There's ham and cheese.  There's also peanut butter and jelly.  I don't care what we get.  I like both of these sandwhiches and I am happy because I know I don't need anything else.  We drive to the other church.

       Quick in Between Note  I just added a new poem to the gallery.  Sorry Al.  It's a dark one again.  Also very abstract I will warn all of you.  I will not provide any explanations.  If you would like to discuss the meaning.  The comment box is always open.  Episode 5 of M E X I C O will probably be up tomorrow.

       M E X I C O:4  We wake up at 6:30.  I have no trouble waking up.  I am ready to tackle the day.  The other guys crack there eyes open and groan as they stretch and crawl out of bed.  It's hot out even in the morning.  The sun is shining bright.  Justin takes off his glasses and puts in his contacts.  Lucas is sleeping in his closed off area.  He gets his seperate room.  I wonder why he would want to be alone like that.  He doesn't wake up even when we say his name tons of times.  He just groans and tells us to shut-up.  I get out of my pajamas and into my pants.  I forget which day it is and think that we don't have to go to the church today.  That makes me feel better because I kind of dread doing it.  I fear a lot of things.  I think that the kids won't like me.  I don't want to do anything today. We go to morning chapel, toting all of our lawn chairs.  We walk, kicking up the mexican dust.  I've got my sunglasses on.  I am hungry.  I go through the line there's lots of people and the servers are telling me to hurry up because they have lots of people to serve.  I get some froot loops.  Milk in one.  Not in the other.  I eat the first as I sit in my canvas chair with my group.  Chapel starts.  We sing some good songs.  A guy talks for a while.  I like his message and I can tell he's good at what he does.  It's hot and I worry again.  I think that if it is so hot now...how hot will it be later? I then remember that Sunday is in fact the first day our Vacation Bible School.  I am surprised but I slap my forehead and say, Duh to myself.  I've been in school too long.  I keep thinking that the week must start on monday.  But we leave on thursday night.  We have to start on Sunday. We pile in the RV and I put on my sunscreen.  Nate comes in and says something like, Move bud.  I don't like him calling me that.  It makes me feel like a kid.  I don't like people bossing me around either.  I can tell he's going to be one of those people.  He bothers me.  I don't want to punch him like I do Lucas sometimes.  I just want to tell him off. We all get on the RV.  Kyle, Shane, Morganna, Dominique, Cassie, Lucas, Sam, Justin, Kara and I.  I like my RV group.  Except for Lucas' feet that is.  They'll be like that all week too.  We leave the campground.  Some people have signs saying things like, Jesus Loves You.  They say all kinds of nice things to us as we leave.  I like the people here a lot.  We drive on more bad roads.  I study my drama script and look at what we pass.  I wonder what will happen next.

       M E X I C O:3  We are driving in Mexicali and I am a little afraid.  I am also a little shocked.  This is so different.  Half of the businesses are closed and it looks dangerous.  I've never seen anything like this.  It's getting dark and I'm tired.  No one talks very much in the RV now because we are all watching.  Watching and waiting. We drive around for a while on the bad roads.  They're bumpy and they make me a little sick.  A man tries to sell us something but Bruce waves him off.  We drive some more.  I'm tired of driving.  We turn off the paved road and onto a dirt one.  We drive by some houses and they are made out of lots of things.  Some houses are made of cinder blocks and look decent.  Some are made of plywood and cardboard.  Some houses look nice.  But not very many.  People wave to us.  I think it's weird that they do, because I've never seen that before, but the 2nd yearers just smile and wave back.  I decide to also.  I like the feeling. We arrive at the campground.  I hear music and people.  A Mexican boy runs up to the RV and jumps unto the side mirror.  CANDY!, He says.  Bruce tells him, No.  I smile because I'm here.  And I know it's going to be great.  We drive through the market and into the campground.  We find a spot and park.  We decided to put up our tents instead of going to evening chapel because it's late and we're tired.  We get most of the tents up.  The winds blows and we cover our mouths and our eyes.  The dust stings.  We get the tents up and find out that there's no room for my tent.  Mine, along with four other guys.  I dread it.  I don't want to stay outside, but Shane jokes about it.  We lay out our certain areas in the dirt.  We use our feet to scratch out the porch.  I scratch out where I sleep, Shane scratches out his bed, Kyle just sits and watches, and Justin makes wisecracks. I'm exhausted.  I want to go to bed, but joking with my friends makes things better so i go along with it. Bruce finds us a spot behind a bunch of RV's far away from our area.  We put up our tent late at night.  We crawl in with our stuff.  I get into my pajama pants and I lay down for the first time in a long time.  I get in my sleeping bag because it's cold at night there.  I look up at the stars through the transparent rainflap at the Mexican sky and smile.  We start to go to bed, but Shane decides he's going to get into his fruit-snacks.  Justin makes a wise-crack and we laugh our heads off.  We laugh and we laugh and make jokes.  Some lady walks by and tells us to be quiet but Lucas says, I love you and we laugh even harder.  We can't stop laughing.  But soon we get tired of it.  And it quits.  I chuckle to myself a little.  I look up at the Mexican sky again and smile.  I can't believe I am here.

       M E X I C O:2  We're getting close to the border and I am nervous and excited and I am some other things that I don't know what to call.  We've been driving forever and I'm tired and I want to walk around for more than 5 minutes at a time.  We practice our drama skits and I am worried because I don't know spanish very well and I mispronounce the words all the time.  That makes me frustrated.  I pronounce my 'a's wrong and Jan corrects me and it makes me angry because I've had two years of spanish and I can't pronounce my 'a's right.  I also hate it when people correct me.  We hold hands and we pray and I don't like that because my palms are sweaty.  And I wonder what other people think when they hold my sweaty palms.  I don't want to do that, but I know I should, so I do. I color comics for a while to use in the VBS clubs and that makes me sick.  The markers fall off of my lap and roll around in the bus.  I have to crawl around to pick them up and I don't feel well.  So I stop and go back and sit by Shane because he's my best friend.  We talk and joke about how he was sitting by a box for most of the trip.  I laugh when he says that he had conversations with it. We get to a town right before the border to get off the buses and on to the RV's.  I grab all of my luggage and stuff it in the RV's with every body elses.  Our RV is packed full and I wonder if we'll be able to sit down at all.  There's a lot of luggage and.  I can't find my Slim Jim water cooler and once again I worry, because that's for brushing my teeth and I think that if I don't have I'll have stinky breath.  We look everywhere for it, but I can't find it.  I shrug my shoulders and climb in the RV.  I have to stand up because there is so much stuff in there.  But I don't mind. We drive some more.  One of the RV's get's a flat tire and we have to stop right before the border at a shop so they can get it fixed.  Meanwhile Lucas, shoeless, sits on the bunkbed.  His feet are black from the blacktop at the parking lot where we changed vehicles and they make me want to throw up.  He sticks them in my face and I want to punch him, but I keep my anger inside.  He thinks it's funny.  I don't.  I think he's annoying. Shane and Kyle look out the window at the cars.  We laugh at the pimped out mexican ones and drool over the ones we like.  We sit there for a long time.  I try to ignore Lucas' feet and joke with my friends.  He still laughs that crazy lunatic laugh.  And I still want to punch him. We decide to continue on without the crippled RV.  We drive towards the border.  We're told to be quiet and not smirk or joke about anything.  Bruce, our driver, gets out of the RV and talks to the border patrolmen.  We wonder what he's saying.  And we're a little nervous because anything could happen.  But Bruce simply gets back in the RV and we drive across the border.  We are in Mexico.

       M E X I C O  I stole this idea from Kara.  I think for a couple days I will write on my experiences in Mexico.  Here's the first...  Today I feel so much.  Excitement mostly.  School is unmoving and dull as usual.  But I am swimming in anticipation.  I leave for Mexico today.  I am packed, I am ready or so I think.  I say goodbye and I am off.  I am off on this bus packed full of teens that are ready for action.  I open the CD I've been waiting for all week.  The White Stripes.  I jam to the music.  I am happy.  I am with people who make me feel loved.  And we all ride together.  We ride and we ride...and we ride.  Through dusk to darkness.  The chairs hurt my butt and I can't lean back very well, but I establish a buddy system with a friend.  We each lean against the side of a pillow and falling asleep is less dificult.  I fall asleep to my favorite music, Beck.  I wake up once in a while and see the desert.  It makes me smile and I don't know why.  I don't sleep much.  We stop at a truck stop and I walk in and jump.  Because I don't notice at first a wax figure sitting in the entry way.  It's too late or too early, but I don't care because I'm tired. We never stop driving.  We see so much and I smile because I see proof.  We drive by a metal statue of a T-Rex and some other dinasaur fighting.  I think it's cool, but no one else notices.  I keep listening to my music because it helps the time pass quickly.  I talk to my friends.  They listen to my music and I listen to their's.  And I am happy, even though my butt is sore. We drive some more.  We see cacti.  Thousands of them!  We laugh at the funny shapes they make.  We watch some movies to pass the time.  We watch Hercules.  And I laugh, because I'm a kid.  And when I'm watching movies on a tour bus with my friends, trash turns to gold and I forget about everything else. We're getting close.  And I feel nervous and excited all at the same time.  I forget about my sore butt and I think about what's going to happen and what it's going to be like.  And I smile.

       Road Trip Buddy  I just got back from vacation.  I thought it'd be a good idea to take my cat out and see how well he did as a road trip buddy.  First of all getting him into the car was hard enough.  He clawed at me and tried to run away but I wasn't going to give up that easy.  So I got him in the car, shut the door and started off.  He pretty much freaked out.  He was panting and shedding EVERYWHERE!  My car is a wreck.  I have to clean it tomorrow.  I think i got him to calm down a little bit after a while, but it's going to take a ton of practice.  Today's lesson:cats are not good travelers.  I tried to put my other cat just in the car and she tried to run out the shut window...lol.  She's a little...special though.

       My Opinion  Here are some bands that I like.  And some that I hate.  1. Foo Fighters-One by One is on my next album to buy list.  I like!  I don't know why Lucas hates them so much!  2. Eminem- Why does everyone like him so much?  YOU ARE WHITE!  QUIT GRABBIN YOUR CROTCH AND GO BACK TO THE UNDERGROUND WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR YOU!  Or he could get himself shot.  It's a given anyway.  *grins*  3. Radiohead-Woah.  I should have been listening to them a long time ago.  Hail to the Thief is really cool.  Pretty creative band.  4. Starflyer 59- This band deserves way more attention then it gets!  Awesome, awesome, awesome!  5. Gorillaz- Revolutionary band.  And rap I like!  6. Country- Sappy crap  7. Beck- Sea Change is amazing!  YOU MUST ALL BUY IT!  8. Coldplay- Amazing geniuses.  9. Incubus- Morning View is a sweet album.  10. Zwan- Feel good summertime hippie rock!  I like!  11. Evanescence- Good, but they piss me off.  What's with the picture of Ben Moody flipping the camera off in that magazine?  That seems poserish to me.  I'll finish this later...

       Hello  Things are going great!  I cannot believe this record label, Velvet Blue Music!  It is like a gathering of the greatest overlooked musicians!  Plus the CD's are only ten bucks which is a definite plus for me.  Tomorrow is friday which means the next day is Saturday which is the bbq!  That will be great fun.  I'm trying to get a hold of AJ to see if he and Levi can come down for the weekend or something.  School is alright.  It's been kind of easy lately actually.  People have been really great!  I am learning to actually get to know people before I make assumptions and judgements.  I find myself thinking that someone dislikes me for one little thing he/she has done, but then I talk to them and they seem very eager and interested.  Very cool.  I think this year will go a lot better!  Goodnight all!  And comment people!

       I'm Good  Things have been really great lately.  School was not half bad as I thought it was going to be.  I seem to be getting a lot of respect this year and I'm a little baffled by it.  Anyways.  I added  The Desert Song  to the gallery.  I think it's some of my best work, but hey that's me.  That sounded pompous didn't it?  Oh well.  It's friday!  I'm going to go hang out with mi amigos!

       School Sucks...I Know!  Yeah so I start school tomorrow. And I am dreading it majorly.  Not the work so much, but the people.  Summer has just been way to easy people-wise.  Everywhere I've gone basically I've made a bunch of friends and got along easily with people, but school is a different story.  There are just too many stupid people who feel like it's there need to torment me or my friends just because they want to.  For the sake of sounding cheesy, it truly is a way to make themselves feel better.  I guess I've become less of a victim.  This year I should focus more on becoming a friend for those who got crap like I did my freshmen year.

I need to have them over more often.  But alas...every good thing must come to an end.  They are gone home now.  And I'm bored.  I added another piece of writing to the gallery.  Check it out!

       ...and the end of summer...  I'm spending my last week of summer at my friend A.J.'s.  It's great fun.  He's got a pretty interesting family.  There's...Natalie, she's kind of a klutz but I guess she gets it from A.J.  Then there's Ethan who I've nicknamed Satan but he makes fun of me when i say it cos I have a lisp :-( supposedly.  Then there's Levi who is now going through puberty and screams like a little girl...very amusing lol.  He's a special boy.  Then A.J. who I went to camp with.  He's cool.  Then there's Grandma.  Fiery, strong willed grandma.  Plus the parents.  They all work together to make this a very amusing household.  Sheesh...I wish I could just live here.  My house is always boring.  There's me...my mom...and my dad.  Wow...fun huh?  Oh well...I've got friends.  Speaking of...Erika is off to the clinic again.  *Sigh* I worry greatly for her.  She may have west-nile or something.  Now she's going to miss the concert.  Oh well...things happen.

       God, If You're There.  Show me   Things are screwed up.  I just don't get anything anymore.  I mean basically, I woke up.  I woke up to a world that a God supposedly controls that is going though pain and has gone through so many other years of pain and suffering.  After reading Night this summer I guess that started it.  I mean, this kid, THIS KID!, went through concentration camps, saw babies being burned in an incinerator, a teenage boy struggling at the noose for over half an hour, his father die, bodies piled up to the ceiling, murder for food.  This is what our race has been through.  And the sad thing is...there's worse than that.  Justice is screwed up.  Justice sucks.  My faith is falling apart.  My faith is dying.  God is unjust.  God is not love.  God is hate and cruelty.  And God is gone.  Please pray for me.  Because I know there are those with faith.  And I admire you for that.

       Miracles   I looked out my window and saw one this morning.  It was a small one.  But could it be enough to make me believe again.  Normally it wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary but the fact that it was only happening at my house was strange enough.  More later...

       Crap   Yeah so I've been lost in deep thought lately about a lot of stuff that I need to fix about myself.  And also about what other people need to change.  1.  I'm tired of clingy people asking for hugs 50,347 times a day.  2.  I have noticed myself becoming really gossipy which is something I DO NOT WANT TO DO!  I realize that other people's problems make a great topic for discussion but gossiping is for snobby girls and moms.  Plus it creates problems, and it can ruin people easily.  3.  I am not your band-aid nor do I want people to be my band-aid.  Come to me with your problems, THAT IS FINE!  But whine to me like a crybaby and I'll get pissed off.  I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me because I see people who do that and it's more of an annoyance.  I mean this could be a problem with me.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just cold.  Goodnight.

       w00t   Yesterday was the shiz.  I woke up at around 8 to get to musical practice at nine.  Musical practice wasn't all too bad.  Our run throughs sucked but it is kind of fun being around the people so I made it through that in a flash.  After practice I met Erika to go to the camp picnic which I have been anticipating for months.  We walked in and Mark attacked me out of nowhere and I freaked out.  I haven't seen these people for a long time.  And then I saw her.  I could not stop smiling.  Being around her just for that hour was...intoxicating(?) for lack of a better word.  Anyways no more of that lovey-dovey stuff.  So we were hanging out talking to people.  Saw April and she hasn't changed at all. She's still a psycho but we love her for it.  Erika made me leave but I'll hopefully see those people at my birthday in two weeks anyway.  After that the group went to Windchimes, this awesome chinese place in Lincoln.  I had shrimp lo mein.  It was really really really good.  Plus talking with my friends and everything was awesome.  So we get done with dinner and decide to go down to the Haymarket(the coolest place in lincoln) to get ice cream.  Then we head to the dance.  It was hard to get into it at first, but after a while I was going crazy.  They finally played a rock song and we moshed to it.  Some pushed Erika's forehead into my cheek bone.  That was painful lol.  But we just kept on moshing.  Overall it was an awesome night.  I had a date.  I've got the greatest friends.  I'm tired.  I'm sore but I'm ready for more.  Woah.  That rhymed. O.o  I still have the senior high car rally tonight!  AAAAAAHHHH!

       Spacebar 3 Preview  Every once in a while a new Spacebar comes around.  Of course that every once in a while is usually in a very great while.  Mostly because there's too many other things going on.  And while I can't show you what it's going to look like i will give you a preview of the writing style.  Monday-September 15-2003 I wake up in my usual groggy state, bewildered and tired wishing I could stay in bed where it's warm and soft.  Every day getting out of bed is like being born you have to leave that warm womb where you have everything you need into a cold harsh world.  It's the usual.  Breakfast.  Drive to school at 8 o clock.  Get there at 8:15.  Talk to my friends.  Go to class.  School is just another monotony to me.  The off white walls.  The off white tiles with the speckles in them.  They all scream boredom but who says school was supposed to be fun? It's homecoming week so there's the general crowd of spirited people of course.  I am not one of them.  I came dressed in my blue jeans and green shirt with the monkey on front partially because I forgot and partially because I didn't care.  It was interesting and fun to see the other people though.  Mismatch day.  Very amusing. School drags on and is normal until 6th period when the power just shuts off.  I'm in AP English discussing A Rose For Emily when it goes black.  Jordan screams and...  So that would be the style.  Tell me what you think.

       K.E.N. Mode...that's Kill Everything NOW!  I don't know why but I have been really really tense lately and it's sending me into KEN mode.  My parents won't let me borrow a fricking penny for Homecoming.  But of course they always let my brothers borrow hundreds of dollars.  I asked my mom why and she said "It's none of your business."  I'm thinking what the heck?!  Are you hiding some kind of deep dark family secret from me?  Roar.

       DISMEMBER THE BUNNY! DISMEMBER...   That'd be the quote of the week, courtesy of musical warm-ups.  Things are going well.  I'm planning on having my birthday party friday, the nineteenth.  I think I might get a new camera too!  A Nikon Coolpix 4300!  I found it for 200 dollars off the retail price! w00t!  Blah on school.

       Oh Man...Funny Stuff   Kelly sent this to me.  It's long but it's defintely worth it.  Kudos to the creator.  "Please Send Only Funny Emails.... > > > >Hello, my name is none of your business. > >  I am suffering from seven rare and deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, fear of being mauled by squirrels, and guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, then that poor 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a potato growing out of her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the traveling freak show.   Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and everyone you send "his" email to $1000? How stupid are you?  OOOO h, lookyhere! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll meet the girl (or guy) of my dreams tomorrow! What a bunch of junk.  So basically, this message is directed to all the people out there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain mail forwards.   Maybe the evil letter leprechauns will come into my house and write "I'm a moron" on my forehead in permanent marker in my sleep for ot continuing the chain which was started by a knight of the round table and was brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it to the year 2000, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest continuous streak of blatant stupidity.   If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing.   I've seen all the "send this to 50 of your closest friends, and this poor,wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel from som omniscient "being" forwards about 90 times. It's getting old.  THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS:    Chain Letter Type 1:  Make a wish!!! No, I'm sorry, we're out of ponies at the time being!! Wasn't that fun?  Hope you made a great wish  Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do. First of all, if you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5 seconds, you will be kidnapped by ninja elves and thrown off a high building into a flaming pile of manure. It's true! Because, THIS letter isn't like all of those fake ones, THIS one is TRUE!!  Really!!! Here's how it goes:  *Send this to 1 person: One person will be annoyed with you for sending them a stupid chain letter.   *Send this to 2-5 people: 2-5 people will be annoyed with you for sending them a stupid chain letter.   *Send this to 5-10 people: 5-10 people will be annoyed with you for sending them a stupid chain letter, and may form a plot on your life.    *Send this to 10-20 people: 10-20 people will be annoyed with you for sending them a stupid chain letter and will napalm your house. Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!!   >Chain Letter Type 2:  Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life could be saved, because for every time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless Goatless Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund. Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the emails sent and this is all a complete load of junk. So go on reach out. Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds. Oh, and a reminder - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die instantly!!! Thanks again!!   Chain Letter Type 3:   Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. (This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then and probably not as many sad email addicts with nothing better to do.) So this is how it works:  1. Pass this on to 15,067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you like:   *Bizarre Horror Story* #1  Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had recently received this letter and ignored it. She then tripped in a crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poop, and went flying out over a waterfall. Not only did she smell nasty, she died too. This Could Happen To You!!!  *Bizarre Horror Story* 2  Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and ignored it. Later that day, he was crushed by an anvil that was dropped by a plane that just happened to be flying directly above him. This Could Happen To You Too!!!   2. Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip. Just send this letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay.   Chain Letter Type 4:  As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote. Send it to every one of your friends.  Friends Blah, Blah, Blah, Friends, Blah, Blah, Blah.    A friend is not someone who sends you chain letters because he wants his wish of being rich to come true.   Now pass this on! If you don't, no one will like you for as long as you live. I mean it, as long as you live.  The point being?  *If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you friendless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it.  *If it's funny, send it on. Don't annoy people by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only chance of living is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right?"

       Crazy Fun Times   Well...not so crazy, but fun.  I'm up at lake Okaboji, Iowa.  It's pretty cool.  They have internet access at the inn so I have the chance to do this!  We haven't done a lot that's really extremely exciting, but we have gone to our share of flea markets.  I picked up a video game Hey You Pikachu it's really for kids, but I'm a kid so whatever.  I found a copy of Michael Chrichton's  Sphere  for a buck.  And I last bought Alanis Morrisette's "Jagged Little Pill" for 3 dollars.  The lake is nice, CLEAR actually.  Something we Nebraska people don't see too often.  Good times.  If only a friend would have gone with me :-(.

       Good Times  I have been in a really content mood lately.  It could be the changing of the seasons...fall (my favorite) then winter (my second favorite).  There are still some things going on that aren't exactly convenient but otherwise life is good.  Here's a few things happening in my life lately.  1. I have an interview for Cold Stone Creamery on tuesday!  In case you haven't had Cold Stone ice-cream, let me tell you that you are missing out.  It is heavenly.  Pray that I get that job.  2. My CD collection increased by two this weekend.  I bought Truelove waits by Christopher O'reily.  It's really cool.  It's piano music to Radiohead songs.  And I got Touch by Delirious from the giftbox at church.  Let me tell you that it is way better than I thought it would be.  Very experimental and different.  A cross between Radiohead and U2.  I like.  3. For halloween Shane and I plan on checking out the oh-so-creepy "meth lab" out by his old town.  Should make for some great halloween fun.  4. Shane's Birthday is on Sunday which is also the food drive.  Happy birthday Shane.  5. Naomi is now online.  I must talk to her.  Goodbye.

       Gollum's Song   Where once was light  Now darkness falls  Where once was love  Love is no more  Don't say goodbye  Don't say I didn't try    These tears we cry  Are falling rain  For all the lies you told us  The hurt, the blame!  And we will weep to be so alone  We are lost  We can never go home    So in the end  I'll be what I will be  No loyal friend  Was ever there for me    Now we say goodbye   We say you didn't try     These tears you cry  Have come too late  Take back the lies  The hurt, the blame!    And you will weep  When you face the end alone  You are lost  You can never go home  You are lost   You can never go home

       Digging Through my Past   Shane's over at my house and we were just digging through some of my old school projects and other things and we found some really interesting things.  I was a very gifted child I'd have to say.  I found this notebook that I had written a book in and i wrote A LOT!  That was a long time ago.  I was also looking through some of my Timberlake Ranch Camp stuff and there was Josh Connely's signature!  I remember rooming with James but not Josh.  Well, I thought that was pretty cool.  Tonight is going to rockers!  We are going to wreak havoc on Cassie's house.

       A day in the life...  One to eight every day I see the same hallucinations by the light of the same bulbs that dimly light the traffic jam I encounter between the second and the third waiting for the final of the day that will set me free driving with my first self service full tank and a good friend on a country road somewhere between two cornfields where I am sitting now with a Brisk and Physiology to a soundtrack by the Flaming Lips who just have that sound that makes me feel like on my little maroon balloon approaching the Pavonis moon moving just close enough that I can see a few lights blinking brighter and faster that crowd my mind's eye and help me get out of Algebra II and to a city nightlife where the people laugh and party and throw away their money because if even for a while they are not on a structured schedule and when you are not on a schedule you are on your way to Mexico on the run from the law or maybe your parents but most likely your life as you know it.

       An excerpt from The Time of the Blackbirds   "The record player is singing again.  It is singing a very beautiful sound that fills the whole house and the dead lake around the house.  The sound is floating in the air.  It is a hypnotic gas that fills the body and makes the eyes roll back in the head.  It is grinning when it hears it.  But later it will be crying when the song ends because that is the most horrible thing in the world.  That beautiful a song should never end.  It should play and play and play and play.  But now it is grinning its mad grin and swaying back and forth to the music that should never end.  When it hears the music the dust and the mold will all go away.  The lights that filter through the basement windows will swirl and dance.  It is laughing and crying and the record is spinning madly.  Everything is mad.  The blackbirds are cackling.  There is silence.  There is the music.  The sun is groaning as it rolls across the atmosphere.  The clouds are swirling in a cauldron without a witches broom to stir.  And the sound that stands out the most is Pa's footsteps across the floor.  They are pounding angry footsteps.  When he steps every floorboard vibrates.  It can hear Pa's mad rage calling out.  Pa is roaring like some kind of angry demon.  The fury is coming.  The fury is right over where it sits.  Pa is at the door now.  The mad weeping is everything now.  It tries so hard to please Pa but it loves the music so much.  Pa will never understand and now the fury is everything.  Pa pounds down the stairs, a wicked knife in his left hand.  Pa don't like the music."

       Be   [1] He will tell you to be.  And he will tell you not to be.  And we can see that he is being perfectly.  We can see that he does not step outside of the lines of his being.  He just is and no one will ever say he cannot be.  He has lain down the law of what it is to be and what it is not to be.  To be this you must be this, this and this and you can definitely not be this.  He will say, I am this and I know all that you have to do to be this.  He will say that you cannot be because you are this and being can never have this.  So I say now, Be.  Because no matter how many are you and how many you are.  You are still being and that is all that matters.  [2] I want this to be so badly that it burns.  I am setting myself on fire because I want this to be.  I am burning quietly and no one knows.  I will want and want but it will never be because it is what I want and what I want is always wrong.  What I am yearning for is always wrong and it will never be instead it just is.  It is and it will always be is.  I can lightly touch what I want to be but it will still only is.  I will get only what I don't want and it will leave me frail as ever.  The sky is gray and that is what I want.  It is pouring the ocean and that is what I want.  But what I  want  will never be.  [3] And what he wants will never be because she is first.  She is always first and always will be.  She came out the same way he did but she was first.  They were both cold, crying and naked but she was first and that is all that matters to them.  And what he wants to be is more than I could ever want to be.  This is not what he wants but what he needs.  I know he swears that he will never do this to his offspring and I pray to God he won't.  Maybe he will see what he is doing if he does.  But for now he is at the bottom of the foodchain wanting and needing.  They are both crying, hungry and naked but she is first and that is all that matters.

      The burning starts again.  It starts when the teacher doesn't choose my design and it's the design that i thought was the best.  There is a burning that makes me shake all over and sets my eyes in a dark fury.  It is a burning that no one will ever see.  A burning without fire that makes me with is was elementary again when the teacher will say, Good job no matter how bad what you make is.  It makes me wish that I'd be recognized for something good that I have done.  I wish someone would come say, Good job when they see it.  I do so much wishing then I wonder if there is a good and a bad.  I wonder if this picture could ever be good or if this other picture could ever be bad without a mind to judge it.  What authority is there over all this black and white?  God, maybe.  But I haven't ever heard God tell me that something I've made is good.  Unless it is God i nme when I think to myself, Good job.  And if it is not God in me is it a demon or is it only me?  It is either me, God in me or a demon in me saying, Good job.  And I would die to know.

       Everything and Nothing  I get that letter in my e-mail.  And I am burning alive.  Everything they do is in me.  And I wonder if everything I do is in them.  They tell me not show it.  It is lewd.  It is hurtful.  And I wonder if it is the truth.  I wonder if this is worth it anymore.  I can remember it.  It was great.  But now it is nothing and everything at the same time.  It is nothing because it isn't worth it.  And it is everything because it makes me burn alive.  I will say I'm sorry.  It will only be nothing for a while.  Then it will be everything again.  And now it is everything.  And I want it to become nothing.

       Inspired by the Notes   (Tension is to be loved when it is like a passing note to a beautiful chord)  I really don't know what's going on with me lately.  It's probably the combination of my struggles with spirituality and basic every day life.  Basically there is just a lot of tension and it's bringing me down a lot.  First there's the recent conflict with my friends at school.  I really don't know what to do about that.  They aren't really talking to me save Kelly.  Maybe I need to make an effort.  I probably should.  I wish it would just be over.  (I got a question.  I got a question.  Where are you?) I guess I really need to make myself clear on this subject.  I'm not just having trouble dealing with the pain in this world.  The last post I made about this was a little thoughtless.  I know trials are good things.  They help us to become stronger.  But it's the things that happen to whole races.  Statements like "We brought that upon ourselves because of sin" only seem like copouts.  There is just so much that I don't understand.  I appreciate your comments and suggestions but all I really want is for my fellow Christians to pray for me.  I have trouble accepting such a statement as "It's only the Devil trying to lead you away from God."  This is something I really need to find on my own.  This is between God and I basically.  The best way to help is to pray.  Thanks.  (It's times like these you learn to live again)  On a lighter note I enjoyed Sunday a lot.  I got lost on my way to the youth group activity and found an awesome minimum maintenance road.  I was approaching a hill and decided to gun it.  I flew.  Literally.  lol.  It was probably one of the coolest things I've ever done.  I got out and checked my car.  No dammage thank God.  I drove around for a long time.  It was perfect.  Listening to Foo Fighters and cruising all by myself.  I got some great shots with my digital camera.  It gave me a lot of time to think and sort myself out.  I need to do things like that more often.  Nebraska is beautiful.  It really is. I don't care what they say.  I love it and always will.  (Well it's all in your mind.  It's all in your mind.  Well I wanted to be your good friend)  Erika.  I'm sorry about Sunday and any other time I've been snippy.  It's kind of scary.  Abby said something about us drifting apart.  And now that she said that.  I kind of see it too.  I don't know if it's just all in my head.  But I really don't want that happen.  That would be horrible.  We (just us) have to hang out sometime.  (We don't have to worry.  Life goes where it does)  What is going to happen?  So much is changing.  So much is happening.  Erika is a senior.  Morganna is senior.  Kelly is a senior.  Plus there's more.  What happens after this?  After high school.  Are we all going to split.  Sometimes I just have to take a hard look at what I have.  Who I have.  I know I shouldn't worry about this sort of thing.  "Life goes where it does"  But it's too strange to think that I have to leave them.  So many people that I knew.  So many that I will never see again.  Where are they now?  (I see the look in your eyes.  You look half my age...We're all getting old.)  I refuse to get old.  I really do.  I can cheat it.  I can lose my hair, my hearing, my sight.  But I cannot lose the child.  I will always stay young.  I will never go to a nursing home.  I'm going to be that crazy old mountain man.  Haha.  Who knows.  Maybe by the time I'm a senior citizen you'll be able to take pills to make you younger.  (Goodnight children everywhere)  Goodnight.  I hope you read and enjoyed the whole post.  I can't wait for tomorrow.  After school I'm going to Shane's and then youth group.  We'll probably hit some minimum maintenance roads first.  *grins*

       Stupid Lady  So I got a forward in my e-mail saying that this Madeline Murray O'Hare lady (she also had a hand in removing prayer from school) is first of all taking Touched by an Angel off of TV but if she wins this court battle it will remove every Sunday church brodcast and all Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools.  Okay so the thing is...as I'm reading this.  I'm thinking...The whole idea of removing prayer from school was to have religious freedom.  Not to stiffle it.  This is just stupid.  There are plenty of much more horrible things on television than Touched by an Angel!  I mean why isn't this lady petitioning to remove porn or something?  It is our choice to watch this.  Not like school where we were forced to pray or read the Bible.  There is no reason to remove this.  If you remove this you better remove every other religious character or idea on television.  I can understand removing prayer for school.  That is something I am even for.  But this???  This is just pointless and idiotic.

       Randomness  So the party's tomorrow.  w00t.  I'd be more excited if I actually had the motivation.  Plus the fact that I don't get to see AJ, Levi, or Ethan and probably Mark too.  Unless he calls me.  It'll shizzle my nizzle though...still...without them.  Yeah.  Wiring the basement eh?  *rolls eyes*  So you're Canadian eh?  WHERE'S YOUR PET BEAVER...EH?  Some people I want to beat.  With a stick.  Or maybe a tire iron. 1.Uncle Kracker 2.Any one member from Good Charlotte. 3.Any one conspiring against me at School.  *cough* My "friends". 4.Wal-Mart because they don't carry Warren Zevon. 5.Evan because he's Evan.  My soul is an island...my car is a Ford.  I'm having concert withdrawel symptoms.  Buuuuut...The Black Keys are here on the 29th and Five Iron is here in November.  Those are two that I can't miss.  Who aaare you?  *coughcough* I am Satan, leader of the Underworld!  Yeah.  So the book I'm reading is a bit...different.  As I Lay Dying By William Faulkner.  I swear that guy had serious problems.  He is obsessed with death.  First it was A Rose For Emily in which the main character slept with the freaking dead guy now it's this book where the lady is so obsessed she has to watch her own coffin being built.  It was drugs.  I know it.  All of those classic authors were on them.  I'm sick...*cough* *cough* I have cancer, Landen.  So I'm a little worried about tomorrow considering there's gonna be a buttload of people at my house and I just dont' know if we have room for them!  But I also have a feeling it's gonna be friggin awesome.  I can see the madness now.  I wanna be like the passengers that wave goodbye.  Just wave goodbye.  Wednesday was awesome.  After school Shane, Dominique and I went out driving on a bunch of minimum maintenance and dirt roads.  We found some really great ones.  Seriously, one car roads.  While I'm popping over the hill at 60 i'm thinking "What if there's someone on the other side" lol.  But there was no one.  We're probably the only one's psycho enough to get a high off of that anyway.  I'd spend my NIIIEEEIIIIGHTS...just MOOOoooOOOOning all over you!  The musical went well.  Mrs. Millington was telling us we sold like 4,000 dollars worth of tickets today!  It was a lot of fun now that I look back.  Although there were a few people I wanted to beat.  *adds Evan to my to-beat-list*  Divas are SKANKS! DIVAS ARE SKANKS!  DIVAS ARE SKANKS!  I need a job.  Wanna party like it's 1999?  Umm...okay!  Hope to see you all there tomorrow.  *Grins*

       All is Well  Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.  Things are going much better than the previous week.  We are working on some things and figuring some issues out which is great.  We've been talking on the phone a lot which will hopefully curb some of my computer addiction.  I got the  urlLink Vines  CD at yet another used music store.  It's pretty good.  I also stayed up till midnight playing Medal of Honor Rising Sun with justin.  It is an awesome game!  I'll probably be posting more later.  Peace.

       Update  Things are going pretty well.  I got Mutations for ten bucks at an awesome used music store because the online ordering was stupid.  I have been listening to it constantly!  Even right now :-).  The Five Iron concert is tomorrow night.  So that should be really awesome fun. The Weigmans might come down actually.  It would be great to hang out with them again.  Ack...Christmas gifts.  That's something I usually enjoy though.  I have money for once so that should help.  I'm tempted to buy Sea Change for every one of my friends.  *laughs*  but I know they all wouldn't like it.  Some have very limited taste in music.  But that's the world.  I'm probably blabbering now.  So...peace.

       Fin   It's been about a week since I last posted so I may as well say something.  Last night was really fun.  It was great hanging out with the gang.  Happy Birthday to Shane.  So I made a stupid move before it.  I decided to take some interesting roads home.  And took what was probably the muddiest road possible.  It was pretty much okay until about the end of the road.  And knowing my luck I should have realized I would have gotten stuck.  And I did.  The engine overheated.  It was actually pretty funny.  We all freaked out because we thought the car was actually on fire.  We ran like crazy people.  lol.  But after a while i tried it again and with Shane's help I got to the top of the hill.  Dude.  Shane was awesome.  We celebrated with a good wash (of the car) and much craziness.  The car-wash was slightly evil because when James and I washed it we were walking in a puddle about 3 inches deep.  I was cracking up cos the car kept pooping mud out of the wheel wells. :-) It was an adventure now that I look back.  Ya.  I'm stupid.  Dad wasn't too happy though.  We cleaned out the wheel wells today and ended up with a pretty good pile...of poo.  It's kind of hard to not get frustrated when you don't feel like some of your friends are really trying very hard.  I mean, yeah they do live far away but come on!  It can't be that hard to drive about 50 minutes to your good friend's house.  Can it??  I probably shouldn't be like that.  *sigh*  The new Jars of Clay album reigns over all.  It's folky.  And it rules.  Plus there's "Trouble Is" which is folky but has a phat beat.  I'm serious.  It's crazy.  Also the remake of "Lonely People" is just great.  Ah!  So glad I bought this I am!  Oh.  By the way.  The title of this post has nothing to do with the post itself.  Just so you know.

       The Weekend   For the rest of my life can I just hang out with my friends, eat pizza and watch movies?  For once you could try.  Please try.  Please please please please please please.  Or we say goodbye.  The game is on in Wal-Mart while it drizzles outside and I love where I am.  I want to drive the long and winding road between Adams and nowhere all day long.  I am sipping hot coffee and enjoying a penne marinara seranaded by the content clinking of a fork against a plate and I am happy.  The grass is the prarie as the water is the ocean-Willa Cather.  I am content.  The weather is beautiful.  And I bet you don't think so.  With my best friends every day this weekend and what a weekend it was.  Didn't take communion today and it was a strange feeling.  For once I finished all of my homework.  I didn't put it off.  I can sleep well.    It is cold outside but it is warm in here.  I am content.

       Life is Beautiful   [The Smashing Pumpkins-Never Let Me Down Again] I'm so infatuated with this song.  In a way it is haunting and in another it is beautiful.  It just makes me want to smile.  And while we're on the subject of music I may as well mention the awesome gift I got from my parents.  A Yamaha portable grand piano!  It is quite a piece of art!  Pretty heavy duty actually.  Wood around the bottom plus wooden legs, weighted keys, about a billion sounds.  Erika and I had a grand ol' time just playing around pretending we were Pink Floyd.  Laughing our heads off at the freaky sounds and making some tight trance music.  I can't wait to start a band.  [Beck-Round the Bend] Last night I found this amazing book, Mission:Africa.  It is filled with accounts from those involved with the AIDS crisis in Africa.  I was innocently reading the book, listening to my music (the normal) and BOOM!  I had a God bomb.  I want to be a missionary.  It was sort of like God saying "Duh, Seth."  I mean, I loved Mexico.  I think about it mostly every day and it was probably the greatest experiences of my life, not only the opportunity to travel such a great distance and see some beautiful scenery but to spend time with such beautiful people.  It was amazing and that's what I want to do for the rest of my life.  [Blind Willie Johnson-Dark Was the Night] I made the decision to sponsor a child today through  urlLink World Vision .  His name is Bernard.  He's a six year old orphan from Africa.  Erika and I decided earlier that we were going to spoil the kid rotten!  We'll probably make a photo album for him.  Write him a bunch of letters.  I'm really psyched about this.  It was kind of depressing though.  I wanted to sponsor every child there, sadly I'm seventeen and I get paid 6.50 an hour.  That doesn't quite even out.  [Zwan-Ride a Black Swan] Tuesday night was probably the most fun I've had for a while.  I finally got to hang out with JA.  We went and saw The Missing which was a pretty sweet movie.  Spooky fun it was.  Then we just drove around rural Nebraska, listened to music.  I kind of forgot what good friends we are.  Hopefully we hang out before break is over again.  Anyways there's a million things more I'd like to say but for one, I'm tired of typing and two you're probably getting bored.  So I say to thee...good night!

       A Great Week's End    Monday  [Moby-Honey] I was already counting down to the lock-in by now, but I figured I'd go ahead and enjoy the week in the meantime.  So after school Ashley, Justin and I went and got my check and decided to be Christmas shopping maniacs.  I got some awesome gifts and spent a lot of moolah.  I decided afterward that I had spent WAY too much.  Oh well...people are going to love their gifts.  After Best Buy we decided to go see a Starship since it was only 2 bucks.  We decided on Freaky Friday and after driving around stupid downtown lincoln looking for a parking spot for around 15 minutes we finally found one.  The movie was funny enough, but Ashley provided some extra entertainment.  Every time we'd walk across a street and a car would be coming for us she'd let out a blood curdling scream!  Oh man...I was out of breath with laughter.   Tuesday  Work.   Wednesday  [Weezer-Island in the Sun] Youth group was great fun.  I wonder if the Rands think (know) we're a bunch of psychos.  Morganna stole my shoe.  Justin stole hers.  This of course resulted in a game of keep away with around 6 people.  It was an insane fury of arms and legs in a pile.  LOL.  Very fun and funny.  The only slightly sad thing about that night was the fact that people just kind of left poor Caleb to find a ride home.  He has enough problems fitting in.  C'mon people.  So even though I was planning on going to Wal-Mart which is the opposite of his house I took the poor kid home.  I hate to be all virtuous and goody-goody like that...but it did feel good to do something nice like that.  So we went to Wal-Mart and dug through the 6 dollar dvd's and I found another gift.  It was great fun.   Thursday  [Sheryl Crow-Steve McQueen] Thursday Shane came over after the school until the BB game.  We played Body Harvest with Justin who later came up.  That game rules.  Plus it was only 5 bucks.  We had crusty nachos and went to the game which was forever far away.  It was actually really fun.  I met some interesting people from Freeman.  I think it'd be pretty interesting to go there.  Apparantly I had some girl all goo-gooed over me, but that doesn't say much.  I think they're all desperate there.  Plus I already got someone ;-).  One of the highlights of the night:calling the public pay phone from my cell and freaking people out.  Very funny.   Friday!  [Jars of Clay-I'm Alright] School was torture.  Waiting to go to fremont was like wanting to piss really bad all day.  But I made it!  Shane came over again.  We played computer games and stuff.  Then went to St. Teresa's Thrift Shop.  I found an awesome Simpson racing coat.  And Bah to pseudovintage crap!  I have a truly vintage coat and you don't!  Then the Gretna malls.  Boring Boring Boring.  And I still have to piss (figuratively)!!!  Then the  dollar store...got some cheap toys and finally got to Ajay's!  Hung out with Levi and Ethan until AJ got back and headed out.  It was pretty funny how loud the car got with all of them in there.  Levi is insane.  But they're all crazy fun people. [Coldplay-Daylight]  We met April at the lock in and went crazy!  April is soo awesome...all of those peeps are.  We swam for around two hours.  Needless to say I got jabbed in my special spot a couple times.  But there's no way around any of that when you're with psycho kids.  Then we heard a speaker.   Saturday  We walked around the super-cool elevated track for a while.  Played some racquetball.  I almost took Levi's eye out.  LOL.  Thank God he was wearing protective glasses.  I guess it really wasn't racquetball more like...5 psychos hitting a ball around.  We got tired of that and went and layed around for the rest of the night.  Sleep was a little difficult considering I had minions jumping and sitting on me most of the time.  I did get some sleep though.  It was over really quick.  :-(.  Then we had to leave April again.  *sigh* [The White Stripes-The Air Near My Fingers].  I'm going to miss that freak!  She rules.  I decided to go crash at Weigmans for the day while my parents shopped.  I got like 6 hours of sleep.  Then laid around some more.   Parents came at like 3 and I went home.  It was pretty sad.  Distance sucks.  Oh and a quick rant.  AJ's work is so stupid.  He gets paid freaking 3 dollars an hour!  Plus like 6 bucks in tips (Oh boy!) Plus he works his arse off.  Grr on Applebees.   Sunday  [The Flaming Lips-Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell] Church.  It was pretty good.  I enjoyed the sermon but this kid but a bug down my shirt during praise time.  ROOAR.  Little freak.  Went to Erika's.  Had a pseudothanksgiving dinner.  Played Oddworld (i forgot how much I love that game).  Went to town.  Got more gifts.  Went bowling.  Ate at Amigos.  Looked at Christmas lights.  Had some great laughs at some of the "ghetto" lights.  LOL.  AND OFFSPRING TREES!  (don't ask).  And the freaking richest neighborhood in town has Rainbow trees for the entrance to the development!  So nasty looking it was.   To Sum It Up  [Newsboys-Lost the Plot] Overall a great week.  I can't wait to see what's next in life.  Bad or good, because I know there's got to be some good on the way.  Life is good.  And really, so is God.  I'm not done questioning, but I think I feel a lot better when I believe.  Trust in God is not about logic.  It is about faith.

       Tales of my Life  [Man of the Hour by Pearl Jam]  I have a hard time believing in anything anymore.  I encounter these temporary times of happiness and, in turn, these times of nearly unbearable sadness.  I gain a friend.  I lose a friend.  I believe in a lie.  I tell one.  What can all this do but leave me fumbling?  So here I am, constantly losing focus and losing belief in anything constant.  How sad it is to realize that I cannot enjoy these times with my friends!  How heartbreaking it is to think of myself as an old man yearning to live as I once did!  Will I become a constant worrier, struggling to support my family or even myself for that matter?  Can I live a happy life?  And what will I regret when I take my final bow?  [Crestfallen by The Smashing Pumpkins] Why do I think of myself so lowly?  [Landslide by the Smashing Pumpkins] Yesterday was good times.  I had a chance to take a small trip to Minersville with two of my very best friends.  It was just another adventure to add to my long list.  [Twenty Four by Switchfoot] So maybe afterall life as a rough terrain makes it all the more beautiful.  The cause outweighs the argument.  What can I do but to keep on living?  There is so much more satisfaction, love, sadness and joy to encounter.  And maybe as I keep on living the good will become more rewarding and the bad less apparent.  Life is beautiful.

        Buy  These Now!  So it's been confirmed that the iTunes music store bows the competition out of the water, meaning you should download it.  It's free for iTunes.  A buck for a song.  Ten dollars for most whole Albums.  Here are some songs definitely worth a listen or two...or twenty.  Eye by the Smashing Pumpkins -A badd beat.  Something blow out your car stereo with.  People will think you're listening to rap, but it is so much better.  Never Let Me Down Again by the Smashing Pumpkins -There's really nothing I can say, but that this is one of my all time fav songs.  The perfect soundtrack to a night time drive.  July by The Innocence Mission -They really picked the perfect name for this band.  They are truly the perfect picture of all that is sweet and innocent.  Good folky stuff.  Dark Was the Night by Blind Willie Johnson -A classic blues song and it scares the crap out of me.  Big Brat by Phantom Planet -Just a fun one.  Kinda sounds like The Strokes  Pictures of You by The Cure -Once again, I really have nothing to say, but that it is just a really great song.  Streamline by System of a Down -His voice never ceases to blow me away.  This one rocks.  Man of the Hour by Pearl Jam -Grab your kleenex.  This one's sad.  As far as I know he wrote it for his dad.  It made Big Fish even better.  Re-Hash by Gorillaz -Another fun one.  The guitar and the beat mix together so well...it makes it sound awesome.  Lesser Things by Jars of Clay -I can't believe how versatile this band is.  It's country but I can stand it!  Now that's a good song!  Hey Ya by Outkast -No playlist is complete without this song.  It's rap that i can stand and it makes me wanna dance!  No One Knows by Queens of the Stone Age -I might as well say it.  This song is badass.  The Mosquito Song by Queens of the Stone Age -Creepy.  The Golden Age by Beck -A good song for Singles Awareness Day.  "Put your hands on the wheel.  Let the golden age begin."  I Miss You by Blink 182 -A song I like from a band I don't.  That's pretty good evidence that it's a decent song.  The Noose by A Perfect Circle -Actually just got this one but I am definitely enjoying it.  It's creepy but what can you expect from a band with the lead singer from TOOL?  I better stop before I get too carried away.  I actually think I crossed that line already, but there you go.  Now go!  BUY!

       The Weekend I've Been Wanting  So I decided last night to come up to the Weigmans since I hadn't seen them in a long time.  We've basically just been chillin--playing video games, talking, watching movies, speaking of, we have a great set of Horror Movies set for tonight: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Original!), Amitville Horror and Children of the Corn.  Just considering the facts a)Texas Chainsaw is based off actual events b)Children of the Corn was filmed in Nebraska and c)I can see something twisted like that happening in certain rural areas of my lovely home state...I may never sleep again.  There's not a lot going on right now.  AJ and his girlfriend are watching Radio (gags).  Levi and I are just hanging out and that's cool.  He's weirder than ever, but that's what's cool about him.  I now consider him my long lost brother....separated at birth...sort of.  As in when his mom went to the hospital to have him I somehow ended up with my family...yeah.  It works...right?  So I approve of this weekend.  I give it an A+ so far, but who knows I could end up stranded with some psycho family in rural nebraska.

       The World is a Vampire  It's been a long time since I've felt this way; the fear, the hurt, the anger, the  hate .  All back from the grave I halfway buried.  What shall I consider them now?  Old friends!  Why not? They kept me company on so many occasions.  And how could I forget darkness, but of course, he was more of a master than a friend.  And no matter how infuriated I am to admit that I have yielded yet again, I must.  So here I am, a naked soul for you to witness.  I am taken over by darkness and what a sweet refuge it is.  Know this: sadness is just as much an emotion as rage.  You will have your rage and I will have my sadness and we are equal.  Another matter of note: who will sit by who?  I'm tired of being part of the unwanted table where you only sit there if the "better one" is full.  Like a pack of 7th grade girls rather than of 10th grade guys!  I have a feeling it would be better if I ate lunch by my locker.  I have the strong notion that Shane would have more friends without me to hinder him.  It's just making me fairly uncomfortable.  I won't fit in with them.  High school is pointless.

       Thank You  [The Doors-The End]  Erika -You've been there since the beginning.  We've always helped eachother through every trial.  We've learned to laugh in the face all of our demons.  Plus we rock.  Thank you.  Shane -I can basically tolerate anyone now.  No matter how annoying you get i'll probably just keep laughing.  Thank you.  Dominique -You know how to keep Shane a little more sane.  Thank you.  AJ -Even though our dorm room smelled.  Those were the greatest times ever.  Keep with your goals of being a youth pastor and avoid stuffed crust Pizza Hut.  Thank you.  Mark -Ahhh the talks we had...and will keep having.  We're a lot deeper than everyone thinks.  Thank you.  Josh -Short people rock.  But even though you're getting taller you still rock.  We also had some awesome discussions.  Thank you.  Nate -Yet another occupant of our rancid smelling dorm.  You added to our talks...and the smell.  Thank you.  Naomi -We may be better off friends afterall.  I think we learned a lot about relationships from eachother.  Thank you.  Sidra -Thanks to AIM distance isn't such a big deal.  Thanks for listening when I feel like crap.  Thank you.  Lucas -You've taught me a lot about music.  You taught me to ask questions about my faith.  Now that I've done that I'm stronger.  Thank you.  Katie -The outgoing psycho who's blog I enjoy so much.  We need more random people in the world like you.  Thank you.  Morganna -Long live the seal.  From one of my worst enemies to one of my best buddies.  Now I know what true joy is.  Thankyou.  April -How can anyone be so fearless?  I think you've basically given' the fear of being accepted or approved the finger.  You write the most hilarious songs.  I could spend hours laughing my head off just thinking about some of the stuff we've done (i.e. glowsticks).  WE RAWK!  Thankyou.  Zach -We've changed a lot.  We've taken different paths.  But we're still friends.  Thankyou.  James -It's good you stopped yourself from being beheaded by that planter with your leg.

We've had some great times.  And thank God for your mom's cooking!  I'll never forget the taste of those brownie bars.  Thank you.  Keriann -Thanks for being my phys buddy.  It'd be pretty lonely in there without you.  Remember when I used to call you Mary-ann?  And you never tried to kill me!  Thank you.  Kelly -It's us against them, baby.  The comedians versus the dramatics.  I couldn't do it alone.  Thank you.  Riva -So far away and boy do I envy you for living in Arizona.  We had great times in middle school...sooo long ago.  Thank you.  Shayne -I haven't talked to you in a really long time and I may never get to again.  I will always laugh when I think about those geometry shapes.  Thank you.  Mandy -Man I'm almost getting choked up thinking about how far away everyone is now.  Riva in Arizona and you in Arkansas or is it Alabama.  I never remember anymore...it's just been way too long.  *sigh* Let's go play UNO at mandy's and run away from her killer chihuahua.  Thank you.  Adam -It's weird how everything works out.  A couple years ago I couldn't see us being friends.  But here we are.  "His headlighth were like thith".  Thank you.  Justin -Man, you just had to move to Rheno.  Even though you make fun of my music...you still rock.  Everybody back in Nebraska misses the snarling beast.  Thank you.  JA -You were the first person to say hi at Norris.  Even though we only get to hang out once every couple months we always have great times...especially jamming to the White Stripes and destroying my poor car on the minimum maintenance roads.

Thanks to you for being the sweetest girl I've ever met.  Thank you.   I'm sure there's many I missed.  But thank you.  Thank you a thousand times.  I couldn't go it alone.

       Drugz r Badd  [Gorillaz-New Genious]  My phys teacher started asking random questions about the people in our grades like "What percentage of your grade do you think does drugs?" or "what kind of drugs" etc. and it got me thinking about how drugs have affected my life (in an indirect way).  The guys in Roca have been my friends for most of my life.  I've spent most of my young summers and after school hours doing what kids do: climbing trees, building forts, chasing girls, you know, the normal stuff.  We were just normal kids and they were my buddies.  I distinctly remember us talking about never drinking, smoking, drugs or any of that stuff that our older brothers or our parents were involved in.  We were just not going to do that, or so we thought.  Maybe the reason kids don't even usually want to become involved in drugs or alcohol is because, well, they're kids.  I'm sure you've seen the "One Hundred Things to do Instead of Drugs" or whatever poster.  When we get older those reasons are still a good option, a better option in fact but we stop seeing those other choices.  Somehow people get mindwashed with this idea that getting drunk or high is the only way to have fun.  Like Lucas said, people are just plain bored.  [Radiohead-Go to Sleep] So back to the topic of my smalltown friends.  Things have definitely changed.  I think we've chosen very different paths, needless to say.  Basically, they do "that stuff."  I don't.  I don't like anything controlling my body/mind like that.  I guess they do.  And I am bleeping tired of people saying "Well, if they want to do that it's their choice, that's fine."  That statement raises the hair on my neck!  That is not fine that the friends that I've known most of my life are literally destroying themselves.  It is not fine that people think that by getting high or drunk they get a really great feeling.  Great feeling my arse.  We'll see how great you feel when you're leaning over a toilet barfing out your guts.  [Beck-We Live Again] If you've ever talked to someone about drugs I think you'll hear them say "Well, it's not that big of a deal because I don't do it that often."  Guess where they are 6 months later?  It doesn't take a brain surgeon.  I just wish people could know that they'll just end up empty.  Note: I realize this post wasn't very well thought out and as a writer I should plan out and organize my work but I do that at school and work.  I can be as messy as I want here, thank God.

       Teachers Suck Young Blood  [Radiohead-We Suck Young Blood]  As much as I like Mrs. Habrock, I can't help getting a little p.o.'d when seating arrangement time comes around.  What a novel idea to have people actually pick their spots!  Then when people get stuck with choices in the back row, my row, the "loser's row" the whole class starts laughing, no SNICKERING.  I wanted a few average sized pebbles to throw.  You know it's not even Mrs. Habrock's fault.

       Any Given Saturday...Our First Official Road Trip  [Things Like This Help Me by Starflyer 59]  If there is only one thing that I can find absolute truth in, it's that the feeling of the open road before you, a few friends (no adults) and some great tunes is the best one you can ever have.  It's something our parents can only remember.  It's a dream that we, as teens, have to live out.  It's our responsibility to be the next generation of adventurers.  We Oooooh and Aaaaah over ever curvy road, we smile at every endless highway, we roll our windows down and we sing at the top of our lungs.  No parent is around to tell us to shut-up or slow down.  It's just us and our many miles of lonely highway and that's exactly the way we prefer it.  [1979 by The Smashing Pumpkins]  James, Erika, Shane and I set off at 1:00 on Saturday, the 21st of February and the perfect day for such an adventure as ours.  We packed all the essentials: tunes and food.  And we drove, letting the Foo Fighters set the mood for our perfect day.  Our first destination was Spring Ranch, a ghost town we had discovered through a great  urlLink Ghost Towns Site .  After only a few miles on Highway 77 we turned off onto 41 and discovered our awesome path.  [Caroline by David Gray]  It's strange how we can enjoy the open road so much.  Why is it such a thrill to drive over hill after hill?  Why in the world do we get such a strange satisfaction just gliding over the miles of lonely highway, the kind that makes you just want to lay back and let your body become one with the scenery.  I am, in no way, stating that every teen can get this kind of feeling just by driving.  I would have no trouble believing that many would find it dull.  But this is our drug!  If there's one thing i'm addicted to, it's that feeling.  It's that bubbling in your stomach when you know you've left every stressor behind.  You are flying.  There may be 6 inches between you and the ground, but when you are driving you are flying.  [Love of Strings by Moby]  So we did what road trippers do.  We drove, argued over what song to play, munched and laughed.  What better thing to do than that?  When we finally got to spring ranch we explored the grounds and took pictures for about an hour.  It was really great to see what had been there so long ago.  Trying to imagine in my head what the town really looked like before it was abandoned many years ago was difficult.  Vegetation had taken over the area and most of the bulidings had decayed so that just their foundations remained, nevertheless it was cool to see the remains of something like that.  We had reached big X number one.  We found our treasure!  [Have it All by Foo Fighters]  After our Spring Ranch experience we made the excursion to Aurora for the Bleach concert.  We were all starving so we finally stopped at Runza and got some eats.  Took a sweet picture of all four of us at our table, finished up and went to the concert.  The rest of the night we just rocked out at the concert and all got major headaches.  It's probably not the best idea to have a rock concert in a gym.  Everything echoed after that.  [Tonight, Tonight by The Smashing Pumpkins]  On the way home it seemed that James was the only one who had any left over energy.  I distinctly remember "The only reason you're hyper is because you didn't jump around or anything at the concert!"  On most other nights we'd all probably be annoyed, but our day had been too great.  So I'm pretty sure we just thought it was amusing.  Basically this was one of the greatest experiences ever.  If any of you readers have never done anything like this, make plans to.  [In the Arms of Sleep by The Smashing Pumpkins]  No one should miss the opportunity you have as a teenager to take a road trip.  When you're old, you need something like this to remember, you need to remember what beautiful times the ones you have with your friends can be.  How everything could seem to be right when you're with them.  You have to remember what it is to fly.  What it is to be free.

       Good Stuff  [Love of Strings by Moby]  Tonight was enjoyable enough to journal about, but time and energy are working against me at the moment.  Just some quick info: 1)I got my job at the voice!  I am really psyched about it.  So just pray that they will be okay with me going to Mexico for a week! 2)The Blair Witch finally has a  urlLink blog .  So go and read.  3)Life is good so throw a party and invite me.

       Hey Man!  [Suffragette City by David Bowie]  A lot has been happening in the last few weeks, that is, a lot of blog-worthy events.  But alas...the site moderator has either been grounded from his prescious blogging machine, too busy with current events or too unmotivated.  Methinks I have some sort of chronic lazing disease.  But the moderator has a plan to let his few but faithful visitors know of all the exciting current events.  Instead of bogging the reader down with too much info to count in one post, I have decided to do that very thing with several posts.  Note that these happenings are in no specific order.   April Makes Pershing Glow  Dare 2 Share was a great experience for the third year in a row.  And this year could have possibly been the greatest, seeing as I had the opportunity to hang out with Aprizzle who as we sometimes like to say "Shizzles my Nizzle" or something in that manner.  Anyway the story starts like this: Rebecca St. James puts on a performance that will only put one to sleep so April and I decided that it was our duty to make our own good time.  The recipe is as follows:mix 2 very strange and hyperactive teenagers, 2 glow sticks and enough space to twirl said glow sticks and bam you have a rockin time.  Oh, but do you, the reader, truly believe that it would be enough to simply twirl and play with the shiny, radioactive glow stick?  I would hope not!  So as not to dissapoint the people of Spacebaria I will tell it as it was.  April took that glow stick in her mouth and nibbled right through the plastic to the radioactive core, and to celebrate such an accomplishment she twirled the thing wildly, spraying the insides in every direction.  The first thing that came to mind was, of course, RAVE PARTY!  And so we danced like desert animals amongs the glowing, radioactive stuff and what a lovely thing it was.  Let it be known to all that April is truly the Checkerboard Duchess no matter how little sense that makes.  And also let the people of Spacebaria know that it is possible to mosh to Rebecca St. James!

       When I Dress in Green   there's a clock on the wall the hands are all on speed and i'm starting to see what they read: THIS IS NOT WHAT I NEED  i'm getting AWFULLY tired of the gun in my back but it's me holding the trigger it was me who took it off the rack it's me with the control, no, the control i lack  i hate how perfect i make you out to be NO!  You are better than me! Damn, there is no way to be free I didn't ask for green, i asked for WE  I am NOT! NOT! NOT! Why is this green suite so HOT?  Fire, fire, MY SUIT'S ON FIRE! Strike up the band and light the choir!  SO... It's not fair that you got lucky in every way We're friends, and everything's okay It'll fade eventually, it's just so sharp today  WE WILL NEVER BE EVEN! YOU ALWAYS ABOVE ME! SOMEHOW unconsciously...  and i hate this all the more

       AHHHHHH...There's a Claymation Thing Ridin' a Bike   [Radiohead-There, There (The Boney King of Nowhere)]  Things the CAT in CAT tests could stand for: Crows Attacking Thom (Like the Radiohead video!) Cauldron Arrangements Thickening (Oohh Witches!  I want it to be Halloween) Candy Apple Trussle (Trussle, trussle, stress and bussle) Cars Approaching Tulopia (I'm gonna start a town and name it tulopia.  Hi lil' claymation creature.  Come ride yer bike around in Tulopia)  Hmmmmm...there are ghost children playin outside my window.  Hi kiddies.  Amerika, Goo and I found a cat at Taco Inn last night.  We named it Taco and feed it a Taco.  It came in my car, but we were afraid it would internally combust if we took it with us so we left it there.  Poor Taco.  We left it another Taco.  And some water.  Stay away from the street, Taco...go to the guy in the Prius.  He likes animals.  There's a guy from South Africa at my school.  His accent isss svery annoooying.  "ZEEELO JEEELO I'm JJJJJJJJJJJJJJOCK and what eeef there wasn't a leeettle claymation aneemal riding around your brain.  Oh zwell, dat's just environnnment!  ENVIRONMENTO!"  I wanna go to Wall Drug in South Deekota!  They have creepy things where you put money in and wooden and felt people dance and sing.  FELT...like Fred, the shrine to my dead rabbit I have in my car, along with my glowing Mary and Pac-Man dice.  Pimp mo'!  The senior banquet is May 7-8.  It's gonna be the rockinest shindig ever.  Liv is comin, Liv is my new friend from Mexico, but he's not Mexican.  He came to the bonfire on friday.  He drank fake wine and smoked sticks with Shane and Josh.  And rode on my motorcycle, almost into this old lady's house.  Oh the lock-in.  April must come.  Everyone's going.  Even the claymation aminal.  *pet, pet*  I think i'm gonna get a Stuffed Owl and take it with me everywhere.  Like the blind kid in Dumb and Dumber, i'm gonna let it sit on my shoulder and pet it a lot.  And it won't bite me or poop on me.  "Niiiice birdie."  Don't eat my Wind in the Willows claymation friend.  ACK...the doll head is after meeee!  Too many creatures out in my mom's office.  Raggedy Ann...at least this one's small.  My mom is gonna make the toys come alive soon.  Goodnight or goodmorning.  I'm gonna go play my didgeridoo and look on ebay for a stuffed owl.  Whatev!

       Ode to Mexico  So I haven't exactly updated my readers who didn't go to Mexico about my whole experience and for that I am sorry.  It won't all be done in this post considering I have only 15 minutes until my mother comes looking for me with a butcher knife, so I would, in this post, like to thank everyone who I met and became close with on that trip.  You all make me feel like a million bucks.  Words like "Seth, you're cool."  "Seth, I like you." just make me say "wow."  You are all Godsends!  Long live positivity!  In the words of the drunks that drove by our bonfire tonight "Shut yer piehole ya negative twit!"  Everyone, I BEG you to stay positive, optimistic, and value every minute.  And remember to love.  Love solves EVERYTHING!

       Please Return Lunch Trays in a Calm and Orderly Fashion  26 days and counting.  Almost done...ALMOST DONE.  Then it's on to Summer which I am sooo stoked about.  I'm planning on having youth group there which would mean Swimming, bonfires, cookouts, music and GOOD TIMES!  All are invited.  LCSers must also be a part of it, because you all rock.   Speaking of LCS...*grins*.  So far I've been doing something every night this week.  Monday night we had a random Church party.  Watched school of rock and almost died carrying the couches around.  Tuesday I went to Wal-Mart.  Last night-youth group:There were about 7 people there so we decided to go to Good-Rich.  I LOVE MY YOUTH GROUP...even when it's small like that.  Tonight I'm going to the Norris Play.  We'll see how good it is.  I'm not expecting much though.  Friday night i'm going to the Palmyra play and Saturday night who knows.  I still want to see Kill Bill v.1 and Texas Chainsaw.  Maybe I'll watch those.  Anybody up for a gore-fest?  And no...not Al-Gore.  There's just too much to post about.

       "Today is the greatest day I've ever known..."  [The Smashing Pumpkins-Today]  I guess Billy Corgan wrote that song on a day when he was seriously contemplating suicide, it was like he had to tell himself that his day was going to turn around and be a very, very good day.  I was thinking that I should always go around with that mentality.  It makes sense.  It's not like i'm living in ignorant bliss, but more of "I'm aware of the problems that stand in my way, but why let them get me down?"  "Today" will be playing over and over in my head today!  Good luck on everyone's finals.

And that makes her KICK BUTT!  Go crazy lady.  Tomorrow night is the party at Josh's house!  We're all gonna pile in my nu blazer and go muddin like me and Shane did last night.  We also tried to fix his amp, which is ghetto-fab to the max and perfect for what RECYCLER wants to do!  I found a shirt on ebay that i'm gonna buy.  It's vintage Smashing Pumpkins.  Ramble ramble.  Go back to Afrika with your elephantitus and listen to Elephant by The White Stripes.  Shane can play Seven Nation Army sort of.  WE WILL RISE!

       Now we say "Goodbye."  We say "You didn't try!"   I wish you could know how much it kills when you don't make an effort.  When what you say is never what you are.  And if it is, it is for only a short time.  Always temporary.  Like driving on a rough road.  Jiggling me up and down and making me ache all over.  That is what you do.  Unconsiously.  Not that that gives you an excuse for murder.  Nobody can get away with that.  Even if you committed it in your sleep.  Pain is still pain.  Murder is still murder.  I want to stay positive but I can't right now.  Things are falling apart faster than I can rebuild them.  I would try to rebuild but I have too many stones being thrown at me.  Too many devils whispering in my ear telling me that I am, was and never will be good enough.  Sickeningly enough, I like it down here.  I like where it's damp and cold.  But this is not ME!  This cannot me.  I am a new road, I am a fresh highway, lighted by a morning sun.  I am not darkness.  But today I am.  I just want to stay strong.  God, give me strength.  Competition is everywhere.  It is always something I have tried to avoid but it has become so real to me lately.  I will never know if I am a better friend than this person.  I will never know if I am better liked.  I will never know if I am number 1 or if I am not even ranked.  Or if I even want to be ranked or if I should rank other people.  I will still love my friends but there will be a nibbling at the back of my brian.  I will always wonder if I am good enough.  I want to fall asleep.  I want to never wake up where I am right now.  I want to find peace.  But what I want cannot be.  Because what I want is always out of my reach.

       i'm back!   Things are getting better.  The school thing is still up in the air, but I've given that one over to God.  I just have to pray that my parents will understand how much happier I would be if I went there.

       Disbelief   So I asked my mom about switching schools, and it was a straight out no, she won't even consider it.  Which is so discouraging.  She's only doing it for selfish reasons, because it would be more stress on her.  It's not fair at all.

       Superunknown!  [Soundgarden-Spoonman]  Well this morning I was at Casey's and he talked about this guy that just left all of his stuff in his apartment for his dad (who owned the apartments).  So we looked in the pile and found some decent stuff!  Here are some of the notable CD's that we discovered.  Soundgarden-Superunknown (THIS IS NOW GOING IN MY TOP TEN LIST!!) FIona Apple-Tidal Garbage-Vol. II Sheryl Crow-Tuesday Night Music Club  That was all about all we found among all the Tina Turner, Annie Lennox, Yanni and who knows what else.  Evidently the guy was a big light rock fan.  I guess he made an exception for Soundgarden.  Free music rocks!

       Shakedown, 1979  [Smashing Pumpkins-1979]  Wow this weekend kicked some major shiny metalness.  Friday night Er and I took a lil' road trip to "THE CENTER OF IT ALL" to see some ol' camp friends.  It was great, we laughed a lot, talked a lot, and spied on two little lovebirds frollicking in the forest.  April's sister and Micah!  Alyssa is now a hussy.  A very brazen one.  She and Micah will soon have a son.  [Outkast-B.O.B.]  Saturday I took the motorcycle out for a ride and it died on me.  The thing is just way to tempermental. Then a bunch of us Mexicans and non-Mexicans went bowling.  I think I ended up with a 120 or something.  My first try was a strike.  I should join a league eh?  Then I got some OK coffee at the mill.  The best part of the whole thing was basically the atmosphere of the whole downtown area.  Sip coffee, laugh with your friends, make fun of people walking down the street, watch the coppers chase some dude.  Casey, Greg, Adam and I looked at pricey abstract art and then tried to go upstairs to look at the Midwest exhibit but some people were just sitting in darkness, and he said "shhhh".  So we left.  [Austin Powers Theme]  Then some of us went to Rachels where I beat her and others with pillows.  I also finally saw Laura for the first time in what seems like a LONG time.  [Foo Fighters-Overdrive]  Today I ate Famous Dave's BBQ which is one of my fav restaurants in Lincoln.  Saw Dodgeball (Now my new favorite movie).  The characters were all hilarious and it was just a lot of fun.  Then my boss called and offered me free tickets to a Baseball game and who can refuse that?!  Plus, we got v.i.p. parking and seats right at home plate.  It was just me and my dad and some drunk people.  That was another place where it was just great to soak up the atmosphere.  Overall a rockin' weekend.  I think this summer may already may be the best I've had.  And it's barely started!  So much for that "depression" crap.  I have the power to turn anything around.  I've got Someone behind me too!  WOO!

       *Chuckles to self*  [Blues Traveler-Run Around]  So I was sitting here, feeling a little down, and all of the sudden...iTunes chose THE AUSTIN POWERS THEME SONG!  And it was an instant party, with myself.  HAHA.  Then Blues Traveler-Run Around is next which reminds me of Joe's Crab Shack now, and probably will forever.  Haha.  And now The Beatles.  I couldn't ask for more!  Thankyou iTunes.  Oh, I think I'm getting one of  urlLink these  now!  The hardest part will be choosing a color!  Ahhh...now The Pumpkins.  iTunes ROCKS!

       No Apologies  [Sparta-Collapse]  Looking back at my recent posts, I noticed that they were pretty much meaningless except for me, maybe.  Basically it was a way to say what I felt in a few minutes.  I planned a monster post earlier this week, but I've been so exhausted with work and all, I just couldn't.  So here it is.  I guess lately, I've been downright depressed.  Right now, I don't really like anything about myself.  In fact, I hate a lot of the way I am.  Especially how easily I'm dammaged, to the point of feeling raw.  Saying that I feel like I'm turned inside out would be no understatement.  I guess I just can't be so dependent on people, so that basically leaves God and myself.  [David Bowie-Man Who Sold the World]  Right now I know that I need God more than anything, but I feel like He's keeping quiet.  I know it is there, I just can't feel it so much right now.  That's OK.  I can live through this.  I'll just come out stronger on the other side.  But what if I don't come out stronger, what if I come only tougher skinned, with more hurt buried inside.  Then the next time I go through a time like this, will I be able to stand it?  I think the source of my pain is feeling like people just don't care.  There's people I've called twenty times in a week to ask to do something until I can get a freaking answer.  How often do people do that for me?  [The Innocence Mission-Tomorrow on the Runway]  Not very often.  But people still do!  And thank God for them!  I guess you could say they are my light at the end of the tunnel, even!  It's a relief to not be planning every event, and to be calling, and calling, and CALLING.  So THANKS!  But then there are those who, when I am around them, act like we are the best of friends, but then how often do they ask me if I want to do something?  I mean, I am just that "rich kid" with the pool, the dirtbike, the golf cart and the trampoline?  Is THAT why they hang out with me?  Because my HOUSE is fun and not ME?  [Beck-Guess I'm Doing Fine]  And all I want is for these people to like me, well, I guess I want everybody to like me.  SHOCKER!  I'm part of the majority of my generation who lives to please other people and to be accepted.  When Billy Corgan said "LOVE IS SUICIDE" he was right!  I work so hard because I LOVE these people.  They are my friends, my sisters, my brothers, and I don't want to lose them.  And it's killing me.  Go ahead, call this my "sob story."  Be what it may.  This is what I feel, and it's starting to hurt, bad.  I mean I have a friend that I have probably invited to 50 different things and I am supposedly in their top 3 friend list.  But I didn't even get invited to his 16th birthday party....or anything else for that matter.  [Smashing Pumpkins-Bodies]  So what is it, are these people ashamed to bring me into their homes?  Am I a loooser?  I mean I feel like I'm more depressed now than I was, FRESHMEN year.  When all those upper classman picked on me.  [Chris Isaak-Wicked Game]  I don't mean to be this way.  I don't want to be a jerk and whatever.  I just needed to get this out.  I really needed to write it somewhere, so people can see what's wrong with me.  I can't wait to go to Chicago tomorrow.  Please, please pray for me.  Please.  I need to make a lot of changes.  I need to get away, to forget.  At least for a while anyway.

      [Sly and the Family Stone-Everyday People]  Last night we were bored so what do people around here do when they are bored?  They go to WAL-MART.  And what do we do when we are really bored?  We play hide n' go seek at WAL-MART!  So that's what we did, then it turned into a tag game.  Morganna was chasing me and Mullet Mary yelled at me *cries*.  I never liked her anyway.  Levi gets here in less than 6 hours.  We're going to see The Village tomorrow.  My writing sucks, nowadays.

      Banshee  "A supernatural being supposed by the Irish and Scotch peasantry to warn a family of the speedy death of one of its members, by wailing or singing in a mournful voice under the windows of the house."  There's a banshee on Roca Road that sings in a mournful voice when we are driving.  Does that count?

      Hello Spacbarians.  Here's some stuff you are going to read or I'll send you to the Iron Maiden like Bill and Ted in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (which is a rocking 80's movie).  1)Wilco's  A Ghost is Born  is an amazing album.  Go buy it.  2)Yesterday was fun.  I a)went to the mall, ate Applebees with Rachel :-D. 2)Took the wildlife safari and saw giant Elk, deer and their fawns, pronghorn, bison, bears and evil birds that tried to eat us.  I think they were pelicans posessed by the spirits of raptors.  3)I'm getting an  urlLink iPod !  I am having "Keep up the rock." laser engraved on the back.  It better come soon or I'll join with  urlLink the Blair Witch  in her witchy practices.  4) urlLink  Hitman Mercy  is in the gallery and the link is at the top now.  Just in case you didn't know.  5)I have no plans for tonight yet and that scares me more than if Leatherface were chasing me around like he did in my dream.  Maybe I'll go camping with no tent.  6)I'm going to Hallamstock on Sunday.  Y'all are invited.  I hope it's hippie like.  7)I'm in a glass case of emotion.  8)Alfalfa.

      Last night was probably the most fun I've had in a long time.  Youth group was freaking sweet.  1) Our discussion was so deep and awesome.  2)Prayer time was also righteous.  Instead of treating God like a vending machine like we often do.  We went around and thanked Him for what he had done in our lives.  3)After youth group was officially over we got out the karaoke machine and sang along to various annoying bubble-gum pop.  Then we listened to real music such as...Phantom Planet, The Strokes, The Vines and Bleach.  Seeing Erika skank has to be one of the funniest things ever.  Power to Erika and my youth group.  4) After that we went swimming with my local buddies.  We also played a most insane game of volleyball and made a deadly whirlpool in to which we threw Teddy.  5) After that Shane, James and Justin stayed over.  I guess I got up during the night and sprayed suntan lotion on my bed!  I didn't think I was a sleepwalker but I guess that is what I am.  Today I shall burn all of my mom's dolls and go somewhere with Rachel.  Keep up the rock.

       We Live Again  [My Morning Jacket-Golden]  My Grandpa died this morning, so I'm going up to Minnesota tomorrow.  Definitely not ready for a funeral.  Especially for my grandpa, or PaPa as he liked me to call him.  I'm really gonna miss how friendly the guy was on the phone, how everytime he'd eat with us he'd say "This looks too good to eat!"...or something like that.  Granny is gonna have a hard time with this whole thing, which almost breaks me up more than Hugo's death.  I've also decided that I want to buy a Guitar.  I'm pretty sure decided on this  urlLink beauty .  Hopefully that will relieve some of the stress that's been building up!  :-).  Now picking a color....

       You Make Me Real   (Last night our internet was down so I wrote this as a letter to everyone.  Enjoy!)  The more I think about it.  The more pointless it seems to complain when life gets difficult.  I often find myself "nestling" into pain.  As if it were my placation, my relief.  I'd set in my room, soaking in every sad lyric, to every sad song, wake up the next morning with a slightly more positive mindset and repeat the same thing over again.  Never have I thought "my life sucks!"  It is difficult.  It is rocky.  And it is beautiful.  All the good times.  All the bad make it what it is.  As I look back on "my beautiful mess."  Anymore, all I can do is smile a little bit at the messes I've been in, and the friends who've been right there with me the whole way. When I was in middle school, for a writing project I wrote a story about an old man looking back at his past, and wishing he could go back more than anything.  I think since I wrote that, I've been afraid of becoming that old man.  Especially lately.  All the things I see, and experience, the feeling we get as teens, the freedom of driving (and often speeding), the adventurous spirit...these are things that are only complete in their time.  A picture or a thought could never justify the feeling you get when you hear your new favorite song for the first time.  Things like these are perfect in their moment, and only a fraction of the magic you first felt when you look back can be experienced.  Never the less, this does NOT mean that more good times can't follow.  So many more are on their way.  Tomorrow could be the best day of my life, or the worst.  But it's a risk that's SO worth taking.  It's always worth it. And If my day turns out to be the worst imaginable.  There's really no better way to conquer it then to look back at all those times when I felt alive!  The time that me and Shane ramped in my Oldsmobile Tornado, and at first thought we were going to die, then started laughing our heads off.  At camp, when I stayed up with five other guys and talked about the craziest stuff, got drunk off of Mountain Dew and quoted Kung Pow.  When me and JA drove around until 1 in the morning listening to the White Stripes.  When I hung out with AJ and Levi for an ENTIRE WEEK and didn't get tired of them once  Just the other night when me and Erika sat on the roof and watched the stars and the fireworks.  These (and so many other experiences) are times I can not and WILL NOT ever forget.  They are A PART OF ME.  They follow me around waiting to be explored again by my ever active memory.  God is amazing for bringing me friends like you.  And even though people fade away, we're still in this together.  And if you go to the other side of the world and I don't see you for 50 years, I will always consider you a friend.  You make me real.  Sincerely, Seth

      This weekend was pretty freaking sweet.  Levi came down thursday night for the first time in a year!  The sad thing was...he go to my house before I did.  I was stuck at work, doing nothing, going crazy because my best friend was at my house and I WASN'T!  Evil them (my mom and Levi) tried to trick me and tell me he wasn't there yet and there he was hiding under the counter.  So that night we went to the regular places:Wal-Mart, Target and of course FORTUNE PALACE (Chinese food=manna from heaven)!  And we watched the regular movie-Texas Chainsaw Massacre II.  Laughed at it, got creeped out by the shaky zombie freak and got some rest.  Friday we went to Minersville (ghost town w00t) and couldn't find the freaking place, so we went MUDDIN and got the Blazer VERY MUDDY.  After we got home we went to The Village which I have decided that I liked.  Even though it pissed me off.  Saturday I had to take pictures of Hickman Hay Days (*insert stupified HICK face here* YUK YUK) and escaped as soon as possible.  At 4 I had to take Levi home, and I did so, even though I DID NOT WANT TO!  But I guess his family wanted him back home for some reason ;-).  Then I saw Rachel at work where she looks HOT in uniform lol.  Subway also=manna from heaven.  Went to the Mall and walked around by myself, very weird feeling.  I always feel like I have something on my face because people look at me funny...maybe it's because i'm a mutant from the swamp.  Then went to Rachel's and played DDR which I now LOVE.  Then watched Friday the 13th which was SO STUPID.  Sunday I went to Church, got my iPod from Erika, went to her family reunion then went to Keri's house because she is home.  Then Sunday night I lost my entire music library ^_^.  I think I've gotten over it though.  I'm in the process of replacing it.  I would like to say a few things...1)Levi=ROCK.  Tell him he is cool because he doesn't think he is.  What a fool.  2)Come home April...and Lassie.  3)The youth group retreat is this weekend and I AM SO PUMPED!  I <3 my YOUTH GROUP!

I wrote a big long thing about my day, and of course, the sermon was included in the day.   So, I'm off to do something else on the internet now. Ta ta! :)

       I'm at work, working on a project. It was supposed to be done by 3 this afternoon, but that didn't happen. My boss won't be mad though because it was kinda the client's fault that I haven't had much time to do it. . .  Anyway, it's not working, and I'm frustrated. And I don't know what to do because I've tried everything to make it work. Ugh.

       I ate a bagel with cream cheese.  It pleased me so bad I sneezed.   Life is great today.  Dad does not hate Trevor.  Summer is not over.  School is over in 2 days.  Then i have a month break.  Then it starts back up.   Have any of you ever had raw ramen noodles? They rock! nate Coleman's sister taught me how to eat them.

Meagan  (The other) Erika  Kara  Jenny  Seth  Adam  Keriann  Morganna  Jenna  Me. :)     If you could, email me anyone else's email address that should be included. Thanks!

       I'd like to start out by saying that the sole idea behind this blog is to keep our group of friends in contact. Many of us are moving away and moving on to different phases of our lives. I don't want to drift away from all of you whom I have been so close to.  Even if we aren't able to see each other as much as we'd like, at least we can read about what's going on in each other's lives. Please take the time to post whatever is going on in your life here. It is also a place for your opinions, discussion, and creative writing. Celebrate free speech, everybody! Have fun!

       I'm leaving for vacation tomorrow. Most of you guys are gone at the retreat right now, so when you read this, I'll be gone. I hope you all had (are having?....how do I put that?) fun on the retreat. I'm really sad that I couldn't go. But I'm excited, I haven't been to Las Cruces since last summer, and I want to see my family that lives there. So, I won't be at the concert on Wed, either. Hope you all have fun. Somebody tell me about it sometime, or email me or something. I'll be back next Sunday for church, though, so I'll see some of you then. If anybody wants to, you can email me while I'm gone. I should have access to a computer. I'm pretty sure my grandparents still have internet....email me at  urlLink panther_power2006@yahoo.com  if you do email me. It'd be fun to get emails while I'm gone, and then I can tell you how vacation's going, too! I'm going to be gone from my granparens' during part of the week, but if I can, I will email you back sometime before I come home. Well, I better get off the internet now. I've been on for a long time. TTYL!! Love you all!

       First of all, I'd like to say that I should no longer be on probation cause, hey, look, i blogged.  Second of all, I really like this group blog idea.  Pretty much the people who read it are the ones who write for it, right? cause i'm about to share some kinda personal stuff that's bothering me about my family... so deal with it.  if you don't know me, then well, i dunno.  just go with it.   Ever since returning home from camp even since the first week, I've looked at my family differently.  My mom was constantly nagging at me to do something when i was home for weekends even though i was so worn out from the week that all i wanted to do was sleep and lounge.  She constantly says the world doesn't revolve around me.  Sometimes I wish it did.  Other times I know that she should take those words to heart.  She tells us to do things to help out, but how often does she serve cheerfully?  I've learned at camp that a positive attitude goes a looong way.  I've gotten used to doing my own thing this summer.  Eating when I need, sleeping when I need, doing the chores I need when I need.  She doesn't understand this! She still tells me what to do and when, when really, I've got my agenda of stuff to get done.  She doesn't understand that I can do things myself.  The thing that kinda makes me laugh is that her own mother tells her the same thing 5 times in one phone call and she gets frustrated.  I told her with a smirk on my face, "Welcome to my world."  Ok, so that entire paragraph was on my mom only.  Sorry about that.  Now i'm going to shift the focus to my family in general.  I am so jealous of the kind of families some people have.  The kind where they can pray together and trust God.  It really frustrates me that the only time I hear prayer from my parents is before a meal, and then, only if it's lunch or supper.  I guess breakfast doesn't count or something.  When faced with large decisions or problems, aka finantial aid for college and finances in general at my house, we don't pray together.  There's not even mention of us praying apart.  I didn't even know my parents did devotions until a couple years ago.  To me, thats really sad.  It is sad that they don't know God like I know Him.  Not that I'm claiming to be an expert or anything, but over the summer, we've gotten close, me and the "Big Guy."  I wish I could show them this close relationship, but I don't know how.  I'm acutally dreading this time at home because while here, I don't pray as much and forget my devos.  I know it's my responsibility, but sometimes I feel like if I had had better examples, then I'd be better off.  Staying with Andrew and Ryann was interesting too.  They don't have that closeness either.  What kind of home are their kids going to be raised in?  One like mine?  I realize my parents are trying, but I promise myself that I'm going to set a spiritual example for my kids.  When problems come, pray about them.  Continuously.  Together.  It works.  I'm trying not to be bitter, but sometimes it's hard.   Those of you who have parents like mine, I empathize with you.  It's difficult.  Hang in there.  Make changes in yourself first.  (This list is for me as well as you.)  For those of you whose parents pray with them and in front of them, thank them.  Thank them for setting an awesome example for you to follow when you have your own family.  Then take initiative and be that person.  Peace out.

UM lately life has been throwing lots of punches, and somehow I've managed to be quite peachy about it. (God is amazing!) and PRAYER ROCKS! ok here's an amazing lil mmiracle of the day. Yesterday was full of insecurity, just a lot of questions, ie God should I really go on the retreat....and so forth.  After getting all my stuff from my old home, I was given my mail... in it was a SUPER old check (from january) for 15. well...thats just about how much i needed to go on the RETREAT! Prayer, and faith. but last night i just felt drained. what an exhausting day, the refreshing part was being with my friends. you guys are the people i depend on, you are just like sisters and brothers to me.  i'm not going to say we're going to keep in touch, but i will try to give you a call every long once in awhile. :) thats about the best i can do :)  last night was me and er's last night of official bible study...*sigh* well i gotta go get my compy outta my car so that it doesn't get jostled and broken.  peace out! love to ya neighbor, and whatever you do ' KEEP UP THE ROCK' ...LOL

       I don't think I've actually realized how great this Crew blog is going to be.  It is my hope that this is not only a place where we can laugh and have fun being our random selves, but a sort of online support group.  Think of it this way, we are all sitting around a camp-fire, basking in the soft glow of the great peace of trust, and friendship, and all the things that warm our souls.  We're all singing songs of our trials and experiences, our lives and eachother.  We're laughing and joking and we are  together!   It hasn't hit me yet that Erika and Morganna are leaving.  Not to the full extent anyway.  It will most likely be a tough fall for me.  If the transformation from high school to college changes people as much as it has been said to then it's going to be a whirlpool around here.  How many more times can I watch Erika act like a cat, or the posessed girl from the Ring, all the while laughing until I choke.  How much longer will I be able to give Morganna crap about her laugh?  It's going to be very different.  I apologize for that tangent but writing this is helping me more than anything.  I guess I just wanted to encourage the crew to be  real .  It's something I don't think I've been lately.  Hope to see everyone at youth group tonight or sometime later in our crazy, random and beautiful lives.  no regrets, seth

       Lately I have not been getting very much sleep, so when that happens I have crazy dreams. This is the one from last night....In my dream I was sleeping in my bed when I awoke to a noise. I sat up and saw Dominique, only there were 2 Dominiques. She had an identical twim that she never told us about! With the 2 twins were 2 other people that she brought that I didn't know. I decided to ignore them and went downstairs. When I came back up to my room there were even more people in my room! When I went over to my window I saw the Dominiques standing on my porch outside my window(which i really dont' have) and she was watching Seth and Shane climbing on the wall! The funny part was that I acutally yelled out to them and told them that they were so stupid and are going to get killed and they'd better get back inside. Well, the thing was is that Seth was stuck! lol So Shane went out farther to try to "rescue" Seth. Some way or another, they both eventually got back into my room safely. When I came back in my room from the porch that I don't really have, I saw Morganna. She was sitting in my chair watching tv eating something out of a bowl. Then I decided that we (Erika, me, and Morganna) should go out to eat b/c we need to for their birthday dinners. Well, I guess everyone else wanted to go out to eat too, so everyone came. So we're running down the street (somehow we suddenly transported to downtown lincoln) and everyone ran into the restaurant. We all ate and went back to my house. I decided to go back to sleep and everyone left. When I woke up, Morganna had decorated my room.  There Erika, I post!

       [Smashing Pumpkins-Tristessa]  Deary me, I apologize for my rude behavior.  It's been a while since I've posted on our rockin' crew blog.  I guess I've just been busy REPLACING the 1000 songs I lost off of my computer.  Oh well it's been kind of good actually.  I'm re-exploring all of the music that I love.  If anyone else is excited for the retreat...can I get an AMEN?  Here's hoping that our youth group can get along and be as non-cliquey as possible.  Shakedown 1979.

       I can't believe its been 3 years since I moved here. And I still have my accent. oh yea. My date was good. I like tepees. They hide you when you need to not be spyed on by your dad and his spies from Cargill Dow. I miss having a cell phone. It really really sucks because I have NOBODYS phone numbers now. Not nobodys. So everyone must call me, so I can get your digits again.

       I have band camp tomorrow (and every day this week, until Thurs.), and I don't want to go. This week is supposed to be really hot. The heat index for tomorrow is 110! Or at least, that's what my mom said. Pray for me! I want to survive until my vacation (we're leaving on Sunday)!
