      So much is happening in my life, it's like an information overload. I should get rid of the cutting edges and the aching of not being able to tell anyone about my pains, sorrows and my joy. I should tell the storyn of my life, but I'll just start from this day and start anew. today felt like shit when I woke up. Too urly and my mom was being way too perky, just like she usually is. Always in the mornings, she's one of them morning persons, I'm like an owl, or a cat. I like cats, me and cats are good friends, they like me, I like them. I like to get to ground level and see how they see things. It comforts me in a strange little way. Anyway. My mom and I don't get along. We fight, mental and sometimes physical. Some of my friends know, it's not like she abuses me, but who like it if there are being salad bowls thrown at your head.  I'm all fucked up inside, I should see a psychiatrist, but I allready did that with my family and it didn't help and now my mom won't let me go see one anymore. I need to tell you all I have inside me.  If I find myself a listener, things will get better. after all it's better to be mad at my computer.

      finally it's vacation time. things at home are staying the same as always and boyfriend dumped me. hurray for life!  well, at least now I can actually see if I can do things on my own. i'm off to a rough time but i'll manage.  seeing someone actually replied to my posting is so great and made me very happy. thank you :). The school prom was quite nice, I co-organised it and was proud of my work, Yannick and me did a great job (with offcourse some other people also ) and everyone gave us compliment all night. at 4 we were cleaing up. it was a night to remember. my dress is stilling smelling like beer and sigarets but i really don't care. got a lot of compliments for the dress. it had a quite kinky backpiece and everyone was asking where i kept my other sm-stuff. little pervs :) people are easyly shocked here in little ol' belgium. Today i spent all day waiting at my computer for Pieter to show up. I met him at the prom, he was in one of the bands who came play and we danced all night. he's funny, not very attractive though, but I don't care. I'm not searching for a boyfriend anywayz. Now i just want to have fun and meet new people, get away from home and make sure I actully do what I like and not what people want me to do. It's the beginning of a new era. and now i'm gonna go surfother blogs, relax and maybe get some sleep, and off course wait a little more for Pieter. jeez i feel a bit sad. he's cool though. very straight forward with his questions, it's actually a bit obvious he fansies me. he'll just have to tell me. cuz i don't feel like always being the one who takes the fist step. BUT wait, that's just unlogical, i don't even want him. god, i should take a break from myself. anyone in for a body-swap?

      you would think that when shit really hits the fan, and you try to make a point to someone, they would actually do an effort in undestanding your point of view and you opinion.  negative in this case i guess. i hope everyone drowns at the werchter festival. hurray for rain. for the rest of the time,... well it's okay, I'm living without mathias and that's good enough, i'm living. and in a very weird way i'm happy.

      i hurt my father's feelings... which is worst then hurting my moms. it's her birthday tomorrow. /woot/ i shall be a good girl for once i think. my grandparents are going to go eat somewhere with us. i love the restaurant, they have very good wok-recipes. grandparents can be a real pest sometimes, i know i should have respect for the elderly but, they really can be a pest sometimes. i hope i'll behave correct for them cuz else i'm going to hear them complain for at least another half a year/. bastards. i have a crush on a guy i had a crush on 2 years ago. he's cute. he's all boyish. i'ld love to be his bad-girlfriend type of girl. i'ld love to actually have someone who can comfort me not only mentally but also physically, i don't mean my ex, could not comfort me in other ways (winks to all you little dirty minds who are thinking that) but it was sometimes hard for me to be taller than him, it made me feel like i was doing the hugging and i was giving more love than recieving. it sounds crazy but that's the way it is. he's taller than me, so i can buy high heels. :) he can carry me. he's nice. kind. i like a guy who though and so on, but now i just want to hide away and be all girly and hug someone and go away on a cloud of love and offcourse lust... after a year and a half in a relationship this will be new. new things to do... mmm. but i'm drifting now. maybe i'll see him tomorrow. we're probably going to movies. i feel so teen-romancy-like. well i am a teenager so. HURRAY  and now i want to go party and dance all night long and be very tired and bad smelling when i come home fall into my bed and just crash into sleep. S-boy if you read this please, for once notice i'm totally falling for you.

      "The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"  Smeared black ink... your palms are sweaty And i'm barely listening to last demands I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath where i am  I'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with bigh block letters adherent to my chest That tells your new friends i am a visitor here... I am not permanent And the only thing keeping me dry is where i am  You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex A stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visiting And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving  D.C. sleeps alone tonight  You seem so so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex A stranger with your door key explaining that i am just visiting And i am finally seing why i was the one worth leaving The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights And send the autos swerving into the loneliest evening And i am finally seeing why i was the one worth leaving
