      Hmmmmm....first post...better make it good. Ok, I'll be honest. The pressure has gotten to me. I got nothin. Other than the boring introduction stuff, I am not inspired to say anything super crazy or interesting today. Well, I guess the boring introduction stuff has to be posted sometime. So, here it goes...  My name is Susan. I live in (or around) Washington, DC. I have the best pug dog in the world. And, a really terrific boyfriend Drew to go along with her. Is it wrong that I mentioned my pug dog before my boyfriend? If so, I apologize Drew. I work in theatre...mostly handling subscriptions at the Folger Theatre, but sometimes I dabble in Stage Management, which was my major in college. I attended Wright State University (a fine institution) in Dayton OH. Originally, I am from Columbus Ohio. I LOVE the Ohio State Buckeyes.   Well, that was boring, wasn't it? Sorry. I have to say up front, this may not be the most interesting blog. I am rarely political, but I know lots of weird facts and fun info.

      Last night we took Penny (our 4 mo. old pug) over to meet a new baby pug, Maude. Maude lives in the building across the street. She's about 9 weeks old so her and Penny are pretty close in age. I have to say...Penny is the cuter pug. I mean, Maude is pretty cute because she is little. But, all in all I think Penny will grow up to look better. Not so googly.   Anyway, enough of that. After the pug play-date, Drew went to a concert and I had sushi and watched Law and Order. Excuse me, Law and Order: SVU. It was rather disturbing. A man accidently killed his daughter by pushing her down the stairs. But, as it turned out, her dad was leading a double life and the girl that got killed was dating her brother. I know, it was kind of confusing.   Tonight we're going to see Spiderman 2. I am rather indifferent to the whole Spiderman craze. But, I'll give it a try...

      So...Brian pointed out to me that I have been slacking on the blog posts. I am truly a Lazy Susan in every sense--even blogging. I promise to be a more regular blogger.   I noticed today that there was an unusual amount of news headlines about Barbie. And these were real NEWS headlines. First, on CNN.com one of the main stories included who Barbie's new boyfriend was (Blaine). And, on Yahoo, there was a story about some guy who won a lawsuit against Mattel. Apparently he was using Barbies in his artwork. Here's a portion of the story that I found entertaining:  The photos often depicted Barbie dolls placed in sexually provocative positions. One called "Barbie Enchiladas," shows four Barbie dolls inside a lit oven, wrapped in tortillas and covered with salsa in a casserole dish.   Mattel spokeswoman Lisa Marie Bongiovanni said Monday the company had not made a decision on whether to appeal. "Mattel is still very committed to vigorously protecting our intellectual property," Bongiovanni said.   My favorite part is when Mattel refers to it's intellectual property.

      After 3 days on the couch, I have decided to come back to work. Granted, I am not totally well. But, I couldn't stand sitting there anymore. I have also convinced myself that I have Gall Stones. This may or may not be true. I have a pain on the upper right side of my abdomen. Since I have had plenty of time on my hands, I have researched gall stones. The symptoms can be applied to my mystery disease. I am just hoping the pain will go away. I'm going to give it a week. I will be really pissed if I have to deal with yet another sickness. geez.   So...Mandy was offered the job here. She told the guy at Arena (and me) she needed a couple days to think about it. That was Wednesday. So, I am hoping to hear from her today. You may be thinking, why would anyone turn down a job in DC to go to Houston. My thoughts exactly. However, I guess Mandy is a little torn since she already signed a contract for the theatre in Houston. And, she's the type of person that would want to follow through on her commitment, even if it meant sacrificing something. But, my point is, thats OK if you are say...not going to a bar because your mom wants you to go to church with her. But, it's NOT OK if this could possibly affect your life. So, I have come up with some mighty good reasons to move here to DC.    Penny the Pug (an extremely cute reason)  70% of the coolest people in the US live in DC (the other 30% is scattered throughout Columbus, Dayton, New York, Wisconsin, Mass.,&nbsp;Illinois, and pretty soon Washington state)  Spy Museum. Enough said.  I have never seen an armadillo here. And, I'm OK with that.  We have snow. And, it's extremely fun to watch people freak out about it.   In a matter of 1 hour, I can drive to 3 different states and a district. In Texas, you can only drive to Texas.   And, best of all, I live here. (Yes, thats a positive).   So, everyone keep your fingers crossed.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Ok, I was sick all last week with a cold and a gruesome cough. Then, as you might expect, I got over it. But, as lucky as I am, I got sick again exactly one day later with something else. I was feeling fine yesterday. Then, I woke up today and thought I was dying. Seriously. I was so achey my clothes hurt to rub against my skin. As it turned out I had a 101 degree temperature. And, I had to go to two doctors to rule out pneumonia. It sucked. However, I did discover a drug called Vioxx that apparently is a wonder medication. Because, as of right now I do NOT feel like I am going to die.&nbsp; Although I do think I have a mild case of the flu.   On a much better note, Mandy called me today to let me know the TD from Arena (here in DC) has an opening again for a carpenter. Which means, if they offer her the job there's a good chance Mandy may be moving to DC and not to Houston. I do currently hold a plane ticket to Houston for September, but hopefully I could figure something out.

      I read a couple days ago that the much awaited Seinfeld DVDs will be coming out in November. I guess they are going to release Seasons 1 and 2 together in a box set for around $50. The story also said that Season 3 will be released at the same time separately for $50.&nbsp; I guess they milked the syndication for all it was worth. It sure did take awhile to get this in the works. I also heard that there will be cast commentary. Which, a few months ago, was up in the air. Some of the cast members were against doing interviews for the DVD. They were upset because the Seinfeld franchise had raked in so much on merchandise and syndication and they didn't get a cut. I really can't blame them.   So, speaking of Seinfeld, what is your favorite episode? Mine is..."These Pretzels are Making me Thirsty!"...and I also enjoy the "SERENITY NOW!" episode.

      Shirley suggested I take a look at  urlLink this site . It's a story about Guiness' smallest living domestic cat. I find it somehow a little disturbing. However, I do like that he is named after a Seinfeld reference.

      Back at work today. I am pretty sure I didn't miss much yesterday. The reason being, I am currently done with all my work and it's only 11:30am. I will have to find creative ways to entertain myself without online shopping. If anyone has any ideas, bring 'em on.   I got some of my Pug Meetup pictures back, so look forward to seeing those posted. :)  On tap for the weekend, Drew and I will probably go to Live on Penn. It's an outdoor music concert on Pennsylvania Ave. The bands are decent and it's only $7/pp.. I think this weekend They Might be Giants are playing. So, that will be fun. I also want to see Kill Bill: Vol 2 at our local Cinema and Draft House. They've been running it for awhile so I think this will be the last weeked it's there. I&nbsp;hear there are comfy chairs to sit in while watching the movie. Usually, I've seen all the movies by the time they get there. But, I actually just rented Kill Bill: Vol 1 and really enjoyed it.   &nbsp;

      Sigh...I hate being sick. I took the day off to recover. I got negative sleep last night (if thats possible-not "No sleep" but even less, "Negative sleep"). Because we have HBO and a cable box I managed to watch Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle from 4-6am. Maybe it was because I was deliriously tired or just plain sick, but it held my attention. No, that was not a "it was good". But, I guess it was fine for being free.  &nbsp; I am now sick of watching TV and sick of being sick. All day, I watched moderately good movies on cable. I am super bored. I did sleep and read a little in between. I guess I'm feeling moderately better, so I better go to work tomorrow. Wow, I just read through this whole post and it's pretty boring. Sorry, it's just been the trend today.

      As predicted, my apartment is dirtier now. Although, I have managed to keep it under control. But, then again, it's just been two days. Messy apartment also equals the return of Drew, which is nice. He told me all about his trip and the Tour. And, I even got an Italian linen top! It's very pretty.  &nbsp; I did catch a cold this weekend. So, I am not 100% today. Good thing my job only requires about 30% most days. Maybe I will go home early. So tired...

      This evening when I was driving home from the mall I heard both Dishwalla's Counting Blue Cars and Beck's Loser. It made me very reminiscent of high school and the days of Jeff. Jeff always liked the lyrics "drive by body pierce" and "getting crazy with the cheese whiz".  &nbsp;  Coincidently, my 5 year high school reunion is tomorrow. Needless to say, I can't be there. Although I understand there will be food, a cash bar, and lots of married people. I can't believe how many people in my class have gotten married. I am actually kind of curious as to what everyone is doing. But, I think I'll survive. Maybe I'll make it in another&nbsp;5 years. I wonder if there will be more married or divorced people there. :)

        I totally forgot to post my review of this movie.     &nbsp;   I saw Anchorman last Friday with Nate and Trey. Sidenote-Nate is my ex-roommate from the leaky basement and Trey is my replacement. The movie was really funny. I'm not sure I liked it better than Dodgeball: A True Underdog story. But, it's definitely worth renting if not seeing in the theatre. To tell you the truth, I didn't have high expectations of the movie. I mean, I like movies like this, but in the previews it seemed like it was trying to hard.     &nbsp;   My favorite character is the weatherman. He is a live action Ralph from The Simpsons. As many of you know, Ralph is my all time favorite Simpsons character. The weatherman delivered classic lines such as "I ate a red candle" and while riding a bear "I'm riding a furry tractor". Will Ferrel was pretty good too. "I love Scotch. Scotchy Scotch Scotch". It's doesn't top Old School, but this is quality.

        Budda the Pug that is! Penny the Pug and I went to our weekly pug party at the dog park. Naturally, Penny and Elvis were happy to see each other. Buddha kind of looks like Bean (Bean's full name is Bean Burrito). They are both tall and skinny. We stayed for an hour and a half!     &nbsp;   Then we went to K-Mart to buy some new sheets. Nice sheets, they were on sale, Martha Stewart. Even though&nbsp;Martha is going to jail, she still makes nice sheets.     &nbsp;   I think I will try to watch the 2nd season of Six Feet Under tonight. Even though I have skipped ahead and started watching the 4th season, I think it will still be super good. Plus, Peter Krause (who is my husband) would appriciate it if I watched all his episodes. We're trying out that new Blockbuster Movie Pass thing. It's pretty cool because you can go to Blockbuster as many times as you want in a day and just trade movies. We had such bad luck with Netflix, I hope this works out.     &nbsp;   And, like Aaron, I am also very excited about the new  C  O  L  O  R  S .      &nbsp;

      I want to go see a band called Carbon Leaf this weekend. They are a melding of pop and bluegrass Irish. Anyway, they are awesome. Really addicting music.   Anyway, this is where I need your advice. Carbon Leaf is playing at the 9:30 Club on Saturday. And, I KNOW Drew would want to see them. But, I don't know if Drew would want to see them after flying back from Italy all day. He gets in around 7:30pm. And, he would be dealing with a 6 hour time difference. But, he really loves concerts. The tickets are $30 total.   So, should I risk it and buy the tickets? I suppose I could always sell them later. Let me know what you think!!

      Ahhhhh...I love cleanliness. Granted, I am known to leave a glass or shoe here or there. But, for now and the past week and a half, the apartment has been wonderfully organized. But, I fear, this will all change in a matter of days!!!!!! Yes, the dirt will come back and there will be many clothes on the floor. Which only means one thing, Drew has returned. Not that I'm not looking forward to him coming back. No, no. I will be quite happy to see him. But, in that same thought I think about all the dirty laundry coming back with him. I know, I know, I'm a bit ridiculous. So, for the next 3 days, I will bask in the glow of my clean floors, countertops, and pug dog.

      I had SUCH a great time this weekend. Not because I did anything extraordinary. But, because an extraordinary person came to visit me. My best friend Mandy came down from Vermont and stayed Saturday (OK Sunday at midnight) until Monday afternoon.   OK, time to pause and have a little background on Mandy. Mandy (or A-dawg as she is widely known) and I went to school together at Wright State in the Theatre Design/Tech program. We both transferred there after our first year at private colleges in Ohio. And, we're both from the Columbus area. She has a Technical Direction concentration and I have a Stage Management concentration. Mandy is truly the best friend I have ever had. If I moved to Egypt, I know Mandy would still come and hang out with me. I love her to death (even if she is moving to Texas). She has been there for me through some very tough times. Despite the fact that we will soon live 2000 miles apart, I have no fear that our friendship will change one bit.  Mandy is currently working at a theatre in Vermont (the technology hole of the US) as a carpenter for the summer. Then, she is planning to move to Houston in September. I hope and pray she will live here in DC by 2005. But, we'll see.   OK, so the weekend. Mandy came down on Saturday evening. We decided to watch The Station Agent. Don't get this movie. Really not worth watching. Although, we decided it was funny, but we are pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be. Sunday I had plans to go to my bosses house for a housewarming and then go to the Dave Matthews concert with friends from work. We bought an extra ticket and headed out to the suburbs. The party was great but the concert sucked.   First of all, we saw the concert at Nissan pavilion. The last time I went there, I promised myself I would not go back. I must have been off my screw. Even though I enjoy Dave, I HATE HATE HATE nearly 90% of the people that go to his concerts. There were belligerent drunk high school kids all over the place. I could barely hear the music at all (only drunk people singing along) CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH INTO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE....The worst part of the evening was sitting in the parking lot for over an hour waiting to move. This place has one exit. One exit to a one lane road, I might add. This is the part of the blog where I must add a Public Service Announcement. Men: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...Wear a shirt. All the time. OK, maybe not when mowing the lawn. But, when you are generally out in public, put on a shirt. It's gross.  It was truly an adventure. I have to say, my friends made it bearable. It was great to see Mandy. But, I wish we would have just popped in the DMB CD and hung out on my patio with some Margaritas.   Also, the weirdest part of the excursion was driving out to Bristow. We saw a girl driving oh...I think a mid-90s Ford. Painted on the windows (in that soap stuff) was a message to all: Buy Hanson's new CD. Out April 20. Visit www.Hanson.net. It was all over the windows. Could this be the same mmmmm bop Hanson? Who knows. But, at least they have one devoted (ghetto) fan. RANDOM.  And, despite the sucking of the concert, I still had a wonderful time seeing Mandy. I think she might resent me for STILL not taking her to the spy museum (I think its the 4th visit with no spy museum). But, hey, one more reason to come back (or even live here).

      As a pround Pug mother, I decided to devote a whole post to Penny's tricks.  Here's what she knows:  Sit Down Stay Shake Up  We're working on:  Speak Play dead Roll over  Speak is so freaking hard. I am trying to teach it to her before Drew gets back. I kind of got her to do it last night. But, I can't figure out why she can't sit and bark. She's like jumping and barking. And I feel like I am rewarding her for being annoying.

      When I got home from work last night, I was really hoping I would hear from Drew. He had called me on Sunday to let me know he got to Turin Ok. But, other than that, we haven't been in contact. Sure enough, my telepathy skills were on. He called. And, although we got disconnected, we talked for about 20 mins. He told me him and his dad were cycling around Italy a bunch. And, he also said he was painting the house. Which I found kind of odd, but whatever. I guess they are leaving for France on Monday. Hopefully, he will be able to call before he comes back. I remembered a ton of things I forgot to tell him right after we got disconnected.   Also last night, Penny and I went to the dog park. And...Penny was reunited with her Pug brother, Elvis. Elvis is adorable. I took a couple pictures of him, so hopefully I will be able to post them soon. Penny and Elvis took right to each other. It kind of makes me wonder if they remembered each other. Basically Elvis is a round version of Penny. When you pick him up he snorts a whole lot. He had never been to the dog park so it was funny to watch him get in the water and just run around. We are planning to meet up every Thrusday.

      While talking to Brian, I realized that all I did this weekend was watch movies. Granted, I did get off early on Friday and I had Monday off. But, in that span of time I managed to watch: Spiderman (the first one just to compare), Cold Mountain, Fahrenheit 9/11, Along came Polly, Sleepaway Camp, The Perfect Score, Shatterd Glass, and 10 episodes of the 1st Season of Six Feet Under. It would take too much time to review ALL of these movies, so here's a mini review.   Cold Mountain: Probably the best movie I saw all weekend. Although F 9/11 comes close. They are so different. Anyway, I usually don't like period films (or generally movies where people are dirty). But, I have to say, this is a really good film. Renee Z. was awesome.   F 9/11-See Below  Along Came Polly-I'm glad I didn't see this in the theatre. But, it isn't a total wash. Definitely not Ben Stillers funniest movie, but worth renting or catching on HBO.   The Perfect Score- Dear lord, this one was horrible. Don't even think twice about passing it by in the movie store. Even Penny hated it.  Shattered Glass- A great movie about Stephen Glass. He's the guy that fabricated over 30 aricles in The New Republic Magazine. Really interesting story. Plus, there's a bonus feature on the DVD of the real Stephen Glass on 60 minutes.  And finally....  Sleepaway Camp- By far, the BEST B movie of all time. This is a REALLY BAD horror movie from 1983. It's so bad, it's hilarious. By far, one of the best movie endings of all time. I've seen it 3 times.

      Well, I saw it. Although, I did have to buy my ticket 5 hours prior and arrive 40 mins early just to stand in line outside the theatre. But, I saw it. It was a persuasive movie. And, for the most part, it served it's purpose. I can't say I agree with everything Michael Moore did as a filmmaker. And, that's basically what my review of this movie is about: the film. It's unfair to criticize anything but.   The passionate tone of Fahrenheit is my favorite aspect of the film. It is also the reason it has the problems it does. For instance, I felt insulted as an audience member when Michael Moore did the piece on the mother from Flint. For those of you who have not seen the movie, MM interviews a woman who's son was killed in Iraq. She has sinced changed her views on the war. When the woman reads the last letter her son wrote, I was sad. But, I was also shaking my head. I was shaking it because I MM didn't need to play the audience the way he did. I didn't need that story to pull at my heart strings. It was manipulative both to the mother and to myself. Her story was genuine, as was the general reaction to it. And, it's not that I felt that the story was too hard to watch. But, MM should think a little more highly of his audience. He should know, we don't need that to convince us.   I did love the way he presented the attacks on 9/11. It was a bold move to only play the sound with a black screen. It was a unique take that has never been presented to us before.   The greatest thing about F 9/11 is that it will get people asking questions. Any film that can get people to research and create their own views is worth seeing. My only fear is that some will just accept MM's views as their own, without any thought of their personal views and experiences. Those people are just as bad as the losers who believe all the crap Bush has fed to them.   Overall, worth seeing in the theatre. However, PLEASE (I plead with you) do not CLAP at the end. That is the most ridiculous behavior. There's NO ONE there from the film to hear you. It is not live theatre, please do not treat it as such. Although I SUPPOSE the clapping is at least for a quality documentary. Unlike those freaks that clap at the end of Lord of the Rings.

      I get to leave work early today. Not that I actually DO all that much at work. But, it's still fun to get to leave early, especially on a holiday weekend. Although, my reason for the early departure isn't exactly fun. I'm taking Drew to the airport. He's leaving today to go on a much anticipated trip with his Dad to Italy and France. They are both really into cycling, so they are following the Tour de France. Plus, Drew's family owns a house in Italy (yeah I know, OWNS), so they will stay there for awhile. MEANWHILE, I'm stuck here in DC with NO vacation. Oh well, perhaps I will get to go to the free Italy house another time. Drew's taking a picture of me and Penny. So, I guess we're sort of getting to go (yeah right).   I do get to see the 4th celebration here for the first time. Last year I had gone back to school, so I missed out. From our new place, we have a great view of the Washington Monument. So, I'm hoping we can see the fireworks. So, at least there's that. I mean, Drew won't be able to see them from Italy. So there.

      Someone wrote to me at work today asking for a free subscription. Just randomly. And, they didn't even write a letter. They just got a subscription form and wrote a note on it asking for two free subscriptions. It was very odd. I gotta say, that takes some guts. Needless to say, we aren't going to give the random person their free subscription. I feel like thats comparable to walking up to Wendys, ordering, and then saying, oh yeah and I want that for free. Weirdos.

      As you may have noticed, the look of my blog has changed. Due to technical difficulties, I had to do this. I miss the dots. But, oh well. I tried to make this one look acceptable as well. But, now I have links! So, I guess it's a fair trade.

      There you go, Brian. My own special salute to you in this blog title.   Last night. Spiderman 2. Good Sandwich. Excellent movie.   That about sums up my evening. I can't decide whether the highlight was the good sandwich or excellent movie. Probably the movie, but it was close. The only problem I had with the movie was my lack of memory of the first movie. I couldn't remember until Drew filled me in later why the heck Tobey MacGuire became Spiderman. I know it sounds retarded, but since Hollywood has been remaking so many Marvel comic characters into movies, I can't remember the Hulk from Spiderman.   OK, here's the part of the blog where I either praise or bash the movie. Definitely worth seeing in the theatre. I'm not one for action flicks, but the special effects in this were really impressive. Plus, the story was well written. I love Tobey Maguire anyway. I was a bit sceptical about him playing such a mainstream character, but he gives Peter Parker a great innocence, as does Kirsten Dunst (for MJ). The best scene has to be when Spiderman has to take the elevator. It's hilarious.   To sum it up, it's no Spiderhead Jr, but it's worth the $9 (or $5 if you're Aaron..grr).

      This weekend I did a whole bunch of nothing. I did clean the house mostly due to the fact my family is coming in on Wednesday. Oh, an update on that...the part of my family (the brother and two teenage girls) actually cancelled. Which, I find pretty irresponsible. But, I really don't care. Now I don't have to entertain two teenage girls wearing next to nothing.  Drew started his job at the bike store last week. He seems to really enjoy it. I couldn't imagine going back to working retail. But, I think this situation is a little different because the management is super cool and this seems to be something Drew is extremely interested in. Lets see...now I want to make a list of all my retail jobs... First was Office Max, where I worked for 4 disfuctional years. On my first day there, the manager didn't know I was scheduled to work 8 hours and they refused to give me a lunch break. Luckily my friends Sam and Aaron brought me some food. Then I worked at an Office Supply store in Marietta. I'm not really sure why I stuck with the Office supply retail world. The only thing I remember about working there is their lack of technology and a man telling me if I stayed in Marietta for the full 4 years of college, I would greatly increase my chances of getting lung cancer. It honestly scared me. Once I moved to Dayton, I worked at Target a couple days a week stocking from 4am to 8am. Then, that summer I was employed by Pier 1 Imports. You would think working at Pier One would be easy, wouldn't ya? No, no, no my friend. Somehow, they suckered me into unloading a truck 3 days a week. I would go in at 6am and work generally till 2pm. The problem was, there was NO loading dock. And, I don't know if you have been in Pier One lately, but they have some big freaking furniture. Like 500 lb. armoires. Once we unloaded the truck, it's not like you can just stick it inside. You put it outside near the dumpster and unwrap the furniture. And, you better believe those things were tied up, bubble wrapped and generally horrible to open. Did I mention this was during the summer in Ohio? And, there was no shade? Once you were done getting disgustingly dirty, if your shift wasn't over, you would have to change and then work inside the store. I am sure the customers thought I was some kind of heathen.  So there's my retail world resume. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon unless I absolutely have to.

      So HERE'S a rather funny/startling story. First we must flash back to April of 2003 (ahh...the pre- real job days). I was completing my last quarter at Wright State. I must have been parked in the teacher lot or something, because I received a $100 parking ticket. I was really pissed because this was the second ticket I received that quarter. And, if you get one ticket, you can get it forgiven (if you vote for student government..I know, weird ploy. I wish voting in real life got my parking tickets forgiven). So, being that I had only been at WSU for one quarter that whole year (since I was interning in DC) and I could care less about actually receiving my diploma, I didn't pay the last ticket. I did, however, vote for student government and get one ticket forgiven. I figured if I ever needed my diploma or transcripts, I would have $100 by that time and I would go ahead and pay it. Flash foward a year. My mom decided it would be nice to actually have the diploma she paid oh so much money for. So, she was nice enough to offer up the $100.  Yesterday, I finally called WSU to get it settled. And, you know that feeling? That scared feeling just for a fleeting minute when you flash to the most horrible thing that could have happened? Well, as I was waiting to hear from the parking ticket lady, I thought, hmmm...what if this  isn't  the reason I didn't receive my diploma?!? What if I didn't really graduate!?!? And, to my horror, the parking ticket lady came on and said, "Well I don't see any parking tickets under your name." And, I said, "WHAT?!?!" No, really. She then transferred me to the registrar. And, while I was on hold for what seemed like forever I kept thinking...I DID take all my Geology classes...RIGHT?!? You see, it actually was completely possible something didn't work out with my credits. Because, my degree is a mish-mash of transferred credits (from Marietta and some Gen-Eds I took over a summer in community college), made-up classes (like when I took "arts administration" my last quarter and just worked in the theatre office), and classes I was just plain signed out of (Stagecraft). All of these thoughts were racing through my mind when the registrar lady came on. Then, she flat out told me she had no idea why I didn't receive my diploma because everything was fine. Don't get me wrong, I clarified with her 3 times to make sure I actually held a degree. So, I guess they are going to send my diploma to me today. What's even better, I didn't have to pay the $100 parking ticket. :)

      Thanks to everyone out there who kept their fingers crossed. It must have worked because as of last night, Mandy is planning on moving to DC. She's moving out here in mid-September. For a little while, she will be living with Drew and I  (and Penny).   I like typing (Penny) in a smaller font because she's a little pug. :)  Anyway, Mandy will stay in our extra room/den. It's super small. And, we'll have to figure out what to do about the lack of closet. But, Mandy is pretty small herself, so I don't think it will bother her much.  I am almost fully recovered from the flu. Yeah, I figure since I no longer have the abdominal pain, I don't have gall stones. I still get kind of nauseous during the day (sorry, like you wanted to know that), and I feel slightly tired. But, other than that, I think I'm making it through.  My family is coming to visit next week. I am only moderately looking forward to it. You see, not only are my parents coming (which is great), but my half brother, his two teenage daughters, my other brother AND his wife are coming too. Don't worry, only the two teenage daughters are staying with us. The point of this excursion is for my dad's army reunion. But, the whole thing seems to be an organizational disaster. With 9 of us, including Drew and I, it would be nearly impossible to just walk in a restaurant and have them seat us. And, no one thought of this but me, a week before. So, I guess it's my job to plan what everyone will be doing when they aren't at this reunion.   I am, however, excited about typing up this "itinerary" of sorts. Being a Stage Manager at heart, I get very excited at the possibility of color coding and office supplies.
