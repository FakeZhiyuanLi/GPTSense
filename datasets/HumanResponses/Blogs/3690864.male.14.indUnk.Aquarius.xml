      So Utahs kinda boring. Ive been playing video games and listening to my iPod and watching tv. Reading a book called  Shogun  thats pretty good. Ive reached a place where everythings sort of how it should be, leaving me with no goals. The goals I do have aren't really goals because theyve already been attained. Like I said I had and argument with courtney today. I really didn't like that. I don't like arguments. I do however like Death Cab for Cutie, and have recently purchased  The Photo Album  to go along with  transatlanticism . Both are good, but I prefer  transatlanticism . Pretty much all of the songs from  transatlanticism  remind me of Joan.  The Postal Service- Give Up  reminds me of Courtney. I need to stop listening to music. So the day before yesterday we went into town. That was when I bought the CD. That was also the day I began reading  Shogun .  We returned Secret Window, which was an amazing story. I love Stephen King's books. I read  The Stand  very recently and it was very good. Im looking for an eBook of 'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles, if anyone knows where I could find one. I need to start playing more DDR. I havent in too long. It seems like ive been procrastinating things all summer, and now theyre finally catching up to me in the form of "no, i wont let you sleep." I was up far too late last night lying motionlessly under the covers. I hate nights like that.

      I got in a fight with courtney today. And i sorta miss her. But it sucks because we were never friends. Online we were, but that doesnt feel as real as it used to. I dont know how i feel about her. I mean.... im lying to so many people that i dont know what to write here. I feel terrible sometimes. Ill just listen to Death Cab for Cutie for now and feel alright. Thats  alright. I just want to feel alright.

      I dont feel good tonight. Funny how I havent included a link to this in my profile, nor told anyone I have this. I should get around to correcting that. I have strong feelings about this one person, and im not sure what to do about them. Im thinking wait it out, because it seems like the only logical option. Sorta see what happens.

      Gmail is destroying the lives of everyone. Its become incredibly corrupt. Alex has recieved a gmail account and has since gone insane. I hope this sickness does not infect everyone. This sickness of greed...

      i guess it could be said that i dont respond to change very well. or it could be said that girls these days are a bit on the trashy side. i dont know. if i hear about another girl  younger than me  thats participated in various sexual activities or thoughts ill throw up. its wrong, so wrong. SO FREAKING WRONG. in my world, people shouldnt do drugs, smoke, drink, or have young sex. i guess my world is gone.

      courtney and i got in a fight today. at the moment i hate her, but i cant see the future, so i dont know how im going to feel then. so now im listening to coheed and cambria and writing this entry to no one because no one reads this. i dont know what to do about courtney. we decided to stop talking, and i really regret the decision, but im not going to be the one to break the agreement. the courtney thing makes me want to go to sleep and wake up in 3-11 days. that should be ample time. i really wanted to be friends with her, but i knew from the beginning that it wouldnt survive the summer. apparently its because i "think youre (im) god" and "better than everyone else" i need to "get a grip" and "get over myself" which may very well be true. i dont know. i liked her a lot. recent evidence has made me decide that the question thing is really stupid and shouldnt ever be done again. i cant wait until camp. camp should be fun. if its not fun, ill probably just blame someone else and spend the whole time on my trik stik.

      i guess "love" is really just hormones. telling you to reproduce. i dont know. if you like a person you only know online, is it hormones? someone tell me.

      An old friend of mine and I are growing apart. Maybe im making it all up in my head, and maybe im not. But It doesnt matter right now. That will be dealt with later. This is the summer of procrastination. I just dont want to have a repeat of the whole Rebecca incident. But it bothers me that were growing apart. I guess ill see what happens when i get home. I dont know anymore.

      ive been listening to wierd al and nothing else today. i have 43 of his songs on my computer. mmmmm... so ive realized i crave weezer cds. which is sad because i dont have any. having a blog had taught me to whine to no one in particular, and thats useful when im alone. until, you know, one of the walmart people walks up in their "hi, may i help you" vest and asks you who youre talking to. that was an awkward moment. so i saw king arthur today. seems less like legend and more like what the legend would be based on. kiera knightley (or however you spell it) looked on in a leather whatever that was. i wouldnt recomment seeing it if youre a big king arthur buff. i talked to charlotte for 2+ hours last night about nothing in particular, and im glad i did. it was a good conversation. i miss charlotte.

      Ive been thinking about things. Alex and i had an argument last night, but unlike him im NOT GOING TO POST PIECES OF OUR CONVERSATION. Just degrade him to all my readers. Which is like... no one. But thats fine I guess. Eh, i miss the walks I used to take with Joan. Walks that had the ability to clear my head of anything. They were great, and i miss them.
