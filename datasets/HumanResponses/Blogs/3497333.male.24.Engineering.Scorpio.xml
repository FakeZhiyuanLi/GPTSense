      Missed my job interview yesterday, due to laziness, as usual. I found myself indulging in bad habits so much that im getting slacker each day. But today, I've made up my mind to go for the interview at 9am. And i wont overslept this time, not when I choose not to sleep at all.  For some reason, I feel tat I have found the ger I wanted to love.....But the time is not ripe, and I still haf to wait. Hope tat she can wait too.

      Tired after a night at Music Underground ... realised tat it a small world after all. Enemies might be friend to ur fiends, and the other way round and such. But still, dancing on stage helps to boost ur confident and than again, who cares wat u do on stage. There aint anyone looking!

      Lost her on Friday night. Some misunderstanding, and she took the wasy way out, tat is to forsake me. Well, if tat makes her feel better, so be it. Not tat I can take it dw well, but I just haf to let her be. It hurts me too much to see her struggling with her own emotions. If i cant be there for here, neither will I be against her. Wish her all the best.  Time for me to quit clubbing, at least to quit Musicunderground. The place sux, with all the chanting and the benglism.  Saw Shwufen on Friday nite too, she was with Benny. She seem happy, and I'm happy to see her too. Asked me for supper on Sat nite... I feel tat my mood is not ready to meet anyone, so I turn her down.  Carry on with my job hunting. Going to city for interview at another agency, alone. Forever alone... but will try not to be lonely. Money will make everything right again. i can live without anyone but not without money.
