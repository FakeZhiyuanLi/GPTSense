      Today has just been a really weird "relationship-y" day.  I'm having a hard time connecting with the LORD the last few days - probably because I've been spending so much time at work.    But tonight was my last night at Russ's Market!  Woo!  If I wasn't so tired, I'd be doing the happy dance.  I had a really weird conversation with two guys that I work with.  These are two guys that I've spent a lot of time talking to/investing in.  I don't normally talk to guys about relationships, but every once in a while I get really surprised by the fact that the  guys  bring it up.  So tonight I fielded all sorts of questions, like "when was the last time you dated someone?"  "what kinds of things do you look for in a guy?"  "have you ever had a one night stand?" "you like older guys, don't you?" etc.  Obviously these two guys aren't believers...but it was an interesting conversation.  I'm always intrigued when God gives me a little window into the male psyche, even if they aren't believers.  They're just so  different  than girls.  Duh, Captain Obvious, right?  But I'm so used to thinking like a girl that it's a huge challenge to try and think like a guy.  Or even to understand the way a particular guy is thinking.    Anyways, the reason this whole conversation began was because I found out today that my ex-boyfriend is getting  MARRIED .  The only guy I've ever had a significant romantic relationship with is getting married.  It's just a weird thought.  I still don't know how to react to that.  The two guys that I work with were intrigued by my flabbergastedness (I know that's not a word, but I like non-words).  After all, aren't you just supposed to know how things make you feel?  Well, I don't, not in this case.  It's just  WEIRD .  One of the things I'm kind of frustrated about in my relationship with God is that I know He's giving me dreams - I can remember them momentarily in the morning when I wake up - but I can never remember them long enough to write them down.  I know that He's speaking to me in the night watches, and I want to listen, I want to remember.  I suppose He just hasn't released that gift to me yet...  LORD, I pray that you would unleash the gift of prophetic dreaming in my life.  Make me receptive to your Spirit as I sleep, and help me to remember what You speak to me while I'm resting in You.  Give me discernment to understand.  You are good, LORD, and your purposes are true.  Don't let my frustration be a barrier between us.  Help me to trust in Your timing and Your mercy.

       Today there's a voice in my head quietly screaming,  whispering, "you don't belong, you don't belong!"   Can't tell if it's me.  Maybe it's my heart. Maybe it's God calling to my affection-starved soul.  I miss Him today.  Need Him.  Need to feel some glory on my face with its racetracks of tears.   Do you ever have days?  Endless hours of feeling so  far.  So removed.  So helpless.  So vulnerable.   Where are you today, LORD?   I need.

      Right on!  I made my very first blogger friend today.  She's this sweet girl from California who's all about Jesus.  One of the posts on her weblog has a list of  170  accountability questions - that's right  170 .  I thought it would be fun to answer a few of them and see what people have to say in response, or even what their own answers are.    Here's the first one that caught my eye..."Have you conducted a spiritual fast within the past month?"  If that's not convicting, I don't know what is.  My answer to this question is yes, but it's not a wholehearted yes.  I have fasted once in the last month, from food.  (You can also fast other things, like TV, movies, video games - something that takes up your time and energybut that you could live without, and to do so would constitute a sacrifice for you - maybe it's even an addiction for you.)  But I feel like the question should be "Have you conducted a spiritual fast within the past week?"  When Jesus is talking to the disciples about fasting, which He does quite frequently, especially in the book of Matthew, particularly in chapter 6, He says " when  you fast..."  He doesn't say " if  you fast..."  He says WHEN.  My heart is convicted.  It's not a question of how convenient it is for me to not eat that day because people might look at me like I have an eating disorder, or telling people I can't go to a movie with them because I'm not watching movies for a month.  It's a question of how much does my heart want to be devoted to the LORD?  How much do I want to be obedient to Him so that I can walk in truth and light and life?    Well, my friend Keri is here for a late night trip to Walmart, so I'll answer some more of the questions later...feel free to comment or discuss your own answer.  Peace!

      Do you ever have those moments in life where you're just so frustrated all you can do is grunt or make animal noises?  But one simply can't walk around mooing all day long.  One has to at least make pretense that one's brain is not going to implode.  And really, making animal noises is not the appropriate way to deal with frustration.   How childish, really!  But sometimes I just moo anyway.  I do find it amusing that one of the sources of my frustration is a professor that I have yet to meet.  Interesting how life in this advanced age  progresses ...  On a lighter note, my glorious career at the illustrious Russ's Market on 33rd and Highway 2 is about to end this Thursday.  Oh, there will be joy.  Oh, there will be dancing.  And perhaps some PopRocks and silly string.  Who knows!  I hope to emerge unscathed, but there have been rumors and rumors of rumors among my ever-eager gossiping coworkers about a certain young man with a crush on me waiting to "make his move."  Good LORD, give me wisdom.  What on earth do you  DO  with situations like that, anyway?    Tonight I took two IQ tests.  Never having taken one before, I was a bit concerned that my stupidity that I'd concealed for so long would finally be revealed.  A sigh of relief!  Both scores are considered in the "gifted" range, and the average of the two is a 137.  Equipped with this new information about myself, I will now proceed to conquer the known world!  I probably should finish school first.  If you want to know your IQ, you can go  urlLink here  or  urlLink here .  Personally, I prefer  urlLink this  test.  Tee hee!  Speaking of intelligence, my fall classes begin Monday, a week from today.  Well, yesterday, technically, since I'm writing this in the wee hours of the morning.  I have never been so excited to go back to school after a summer.  Don't ask me why.  Maybe it's because I'm almost done?  Maybe it's because I'm so excited about my Russian class?  All I know is that this next week would be torturous if I wasn't already working 60 hours.    This week I have been thinking rather seriously about starting up a Bible study again, but I'm not exactly sure what that would be like.  I want balance, but I don't want boring.  And I'm not sure that I should even call it "Bible study" as that's not necessarily what I have in mind.  Maybe I'll blog more on this later when I've organized my thoughts into a more comprehensible mess.

      I haven't had more than 4 continuous hours of sleep in the last few days...so my mind is a jumble of random, fragmented thoughts...here are some of them.  Most of them are musical thoughts, for some reason...  I'm made of dirt.  Diiiiiiiiirty. I don't like AC/DC.  Or Moby.  Or Britney Spears.  I don't understand why people do.   I wish there were more artists like Chris Thile and Bela Fleck and Thelonious Monk and Ben Harper.  Black Sabbath was the first "secular" band I ever liked.  Whoa.  Quite a stretch from the Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith I was raised on. I think I only listened to Silverchair in high school because they were from Australia.  I listened to Metallica because my cool older next-door-neighbor Tommy listened to them.   This is the first summer I won't make it to Colorado for like 5 years.  Bummer.  My heart is longing for mountains.  Anyone want to make a fall trip? Why is Christian music so cliche?  Why does every third worship song quote the same verse?  Why doesn't anyone ever write songs about Daniel?  Or Zechariah? Who named the dobro the dobro?  Why? Why do my finger callouses always peel?  Maybe I'm just not meant for the guitar and mandolin...   Hmmm, so evidently I'm not as much of a computer geek as I thought I was, because my pictures only stayed up here for a day, and then they stopped loading.  Sorry about that.  Apparently blogger.com only wants you to use their photo bot thingy...which I don't feel like downloading.  So...no pictures.  Sigh.    Today I decided for like the hundredth time that I love my new job.  It rules.  There's just no other way to say it.  I love it.  Today a boy that ran (They call it eloping...but don't you have to be  with  someone to elope?  Apparently not, according to Dictionary.com) came back to the treatment center.  He's a very high risk individual - he's very young, and he already has multiple scars from self-harm.  He also has a strong interest in the occult.  The thing that the LORD layed on my heart to pray for him is  redemption .  I can't write his name here for confidentiality laws, but if you read this blog, please pray for J.  He needs to know that life isn't just about pain.  Today at work I also met a new fellow employee name Seamus.  (pronounced Shay-muss)  You always read about those Irish folk named Seamus, but I've never met one in person.  He's funny.  And he's bigger than my brother, which is not something I would expect from someone named Seamus.  (If you've never met my brother, think football linebacker.)    At work I have to watch a whole bunch of training videos on suicide assessment, the affects of different drugs, treatment possibilities, etc.  I learned that of all the drugs available out there, alcohol (yes, alcohol is a  drug , folks!) has the worst withdrawal symptoms, with the highest fatality rates.  You just never know what you'll learn next...  I have recently discovered that Yahoo messenger has this great function - you can use it to play all kinds of different music.  It's sort of like radio stations.  I'm stuck on the Reggae one.  Currently I'm listening to Peter Tosh singing "equal rights".  Marley songs are a staple of this "station."  It's stellar.  Did you know that Rastas believe the Messiah was reincarnated in the form of an Ethiopian king?  Craaaaazy, mon, craaaaaazy.    Ok, I think the randomness needs to end here.  Sleep would be good.

      It's crazy sometimes when you're just kinda movin' along through life, not really expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen, and God hits you over the head with this amazing new concept.  Usually it's not really an amazing new concept, He just needed to open your eyes to something you weren't imagining was possible.  One of God's favorite things to tell me lately is "You have no idea!"  He says it in this completely mischevious voice - sometimes it's really unnerving, because I really do have no idea what He's going to throw me into next...  What the heck am I talking about, anyway?  Well, Sunday night/Monday morning, I worked my second overnight shift at my new job (the rehab residential center for teenagers with drug abuse and mental health issues).  I brought a ton of stuff to do, because last time I was kind of bored by 4 in the morning.  My Slaughterhouse Five book, an art project I'm working on, and my leftover Jimmy John's vegetarian sandwich, because when you're up all night, of course you get hungry at 3:32am.  Plus I have two hours of training videos to watch.  Well, in my nine hour shift, I managed to do all the paperwork we're supposed to do, watch my two hours of training training videos, and eat my sandwich.  (mmmm! cucumbers!)  What the heck did I spend the remaining 6 hours of my shift doing?  I spent it talking to my co-worker Paul.  (there are always two of us on overnight shifts)  Paul is a 22 year old man who is jaded, hates George W. Bush, has experienced extreme poverty, racial oppression, and serious drug abuse by his friends and family.  So what the heck do I and Paul have in common?  Music - particularly jazz and reggae.  Political opinions (heck, everyone has those).  Growing up in the church and hating the state it was in.  A desire to travel - he was an Army brat and grew up in Germany, and wanted to hear all about my trip to Siberia/Russia and Poland.    Again, what the heck is my point in all of this??  Simply this - you just have no stinkin' idea what God is going to do.  No, I didn't sit down and share the "bridge" illustration with Paul and share the gospel with him.  I'm pretty sure he already knows the gospel. (Although you never know, some people grow up in the church and never hear it once, which is scary.)  But I did spend 6 hours exchanging ideas with him, listening to what he had to say, and sharing from my own life and experiences.  I know I made him think, and he made me think, too.  And it's not just about what you do.  It's not just about me "saving" Paul.  It's also about God using Paul to help me think outside the box.  To spur me on to think..."is that really God's ideal, or is it a  Republican  ideal?"  Hmmm.  I have no idea...but God is opening my eyes.

      Tonight I went to a party for my friend Dena, who is going far, far away to grad school.  After some initial misgivings, I had a pretty good time at the party.  However, my party-going experience always seems to get tainted.  Let me explain.  I generally spend about half of my time catching up with people I haven't seen in months, experiencing random deep conversations.  The other half I generally spend people-watching.  (Parties are one of the best places to do this, if you're a people watcher and didn't already know that.)  Unfortunately, part of people watching is frequently being baffled by the actions of the subject of your attention.  Or in some cases, you even begin to be annoyed by their behavior.  I have noticed that at nearly every party I attend (meaning people my age with lots of single folk there) there is at least one girl who makes her need for attention quite obvious.  She also generally makes it obvious from which male she would like attention.  Well, tonight, in the midst of trying to have those random deep conversations with people I haven't seen in months, I found myself getting incredibly irritated by one particular girl at the party.  She was loud and distracting, and making obvious plays for attention from a boy that didn't want to pay attention to her.  I found myself wanting to leave, just to get away from this one girl.    Then I started to think...sometimes I'm that girl to other people.  I may not be loud and annoying at parties, but I'm sure there is some deeply rooted issue that I have that drives other people nuts when they're around me.  I wish that people would say something to me in those times.  Like..."Lynette, your issues are bothering me...is there something you'd like to talk about?  What's your deal, freakazoid?"  Ok, maybe not like that...but I wish people wouldn't be so afraid to speak what they're thinking.  To speak what's real.  Yes, you should consider people's feelings, and be gracious to them.  But if I have some annoying characteristic, I'd rather have it pointed out to me than to have it persist for the entirety of my lifespan, you know?  I'd want people to be real about it.  Even if it hurts.  Because sometimes I just can't see past my nose, and I don't see the way that my selfish actions are affecting others.  Heck, I may even be hurting them, not just annoying them.    I think I may just be babbling because it's nearly 3 in the morning and I haven't slept much lately.  Sometimes 3 in the morning is the best time to process thoughts, though.  Spoooooooooooooooooooon!!!!!!!

      Today has been a stellar day.  I love it when it's overcast and cool like this.  I really think I need to move to Oregon when I graduate.  I've also had the song "Bullfrogs and Butterflies...they've both been born again..." running through my head all day, so how can I not be in a good mood?  That song rules!  I know the day will only get better, because I get to go to my Bluegrass guitar class tonight, which is amazing and fun all at the same time, and I also get to work my first overnight at my new job.  May not sound like fun for you normal folk, but I'm excited about it - I think I was born nocturnal.  It should be a good time.    I was asked to write a testimony for the quarterly missions report at Christ's Place about my missions experience.  Of course, being me, I procrastinated until the last possible moment, and just wrote it this afternoon.  We were only supposed to write a paragraph or two, but mine got a little lengthy.  I'm not sure how much of it will actually appear in the report, but I thought it would be fun to post the whole thing here.  It's not your typical missions testimony, I don't think...but then again, I haven't read a lot of them, so who knows.  Anyway, here is the aforementioned testimony...about the nasty sin of pride...   Sometimes God has to take you to the other side of the world in order to work a new thing in your heart.  Sounds farfetched, doesn’t it?  Well, it’s not.  Think of Abraham, Moses, and the Israelites.  God took them on journeys across the desert, up into mountains, and through enemy territory in order to show them new things, and to move them into new physical and spiritual arenas.  Well, God took me to Siberia to pray and to minister to the body of believers there.  He also took me to deal with some of my personal sin as well.  When I was first asked to write a testimony for this quarterly report, I started praying about what He wanted me to share.  He told me, “tell them how I freed you from your pride.”  I said, “Wow, LORD, that’s really something I want everyone to read about, my pride.”  His response to me, which has become quite frequent as of late was “just obey me, girl.”  So here I am, trying to obey, because I desperately don’t want to miss the next new thing He has for my life, and because those whom the LORD sets free are free indeed, and there is no place for shame.  I grew up spiritually in a collegiate ministry that focused on leadership and discipleship.  As I became more involved, they gave me more responsibility.  At first it was co-leading a Bible study with another girl.  Then it was leading a Bible study alone (something they normally only let staff do).  Then it was helping to lead a worship team.  Then it was speaking at the semi-annual women’s conference.  None of these things are inherently bad, but somewhere along the way, I gave the devil a stronghold, and pride began to creep into my life.  Well, when pride began to creep in, I obviously began to minister and teach from my own flesh, not from the leading of the Spirit.  After a few years of this, you just don’t have the energy anymore.  So I gave it all up.  Fast-forward a few years.  I get a missions postcard in the mail about a missions trip to Siberia.  Never had any desire to go to Siberia, don’t know anything about the place.  God tells me, “that’s what you’re doing this summer.”  I debate with Him and overanalyze the situation, as I always do.  Finally, I obey.  As we arrive in Siberia and begin to minister, the prayer that the Holy Spirit lays on my heart is, “Empty me out, LORD, and fill me up with You.”  Something broke in me when I prayed that.  A simple prayer, but that was exactly what He wanted.  He wanted humility, an acknowledgement that it wasn’t me setting people free or speaking truth over them.  It was the Holy Spirit through me.  We had some powerful times of ministry, and satan had ample opportunity to tempt me with thoughts of pride.  But the LORD was faithful to me each time, and gave me ways to fend Him off.  The one I remember most vividly was this: “When a man builds a beautiful house, you don’t congratulate the hammer on a job well done, you congratulate the man who built it.”  If you ask Him, He will provide the way out of temptation.  He set me free from pride because of my obedience and His mercy, and He also gave me the tools to stay free.   	All of this is just a very small picture of what you might experience should the LORD call you to missions.  Yes, you will experience a new culture.  Yes, the LORD will use you powerfully to minister to those who are tired and hurting and need to be set free.  But He will also use the time to minister to you, because you are His beloved.  Don’t forget that the kingdom of heaven is  within  you, and that is where His heart lies, with you.

      If you're ever down and having a bad evening, such as I am having currently...long story...check out this website.   urlLink http://www.rathergood.com/independent_woman/   It always makes me laugh!  Especially the orange kitten with the xylophone.  The caption of the website is "If Destiny's Child were kittens from Northern England, this is what they would sound like."

      Today I find myself wishing I was back in Siberia.  I miss seeing my surrogate mom's (Diana Lang, missionary to Siberia) face every morning when I wake up.  I wonder what my friend Katya is doing today, and what kind of job the LORD has provided for her.  I'm praying for Kharim, the Buddhist monk who isn't convinced that Buddha is the way and still has life in his eyes.  I'm asking the LORD to protect him and preserve his life in a dark and desolate place.  I'm trusting that Misha's church is flourishing, and that God is protecting them from the shaman that lives next door.    Isn't that always the way of it, though?  We long for things of the past - good things, but past things.  God uses it to spur us to pray for the people in that past season, that we may never meet again.  But He also uses it to draw us forward, into the future.  I think - well, if that was good, what amazing things are just around the corner?  What surprises is He planning for me?  Does He want to introduce me to some random person while I'm hanging out with my brother tonight?  Is there something He wants to teach me from seeing Spiderman 2?  (Yes, I occasionally - ok, frequently - fall into the category of nerd!)  Who does He want me to pray for?  What is He trying to speak to my heart?   So I'm thinking about all these things, and I start thinking about old poems I've written.  It's like a small picture of how the LORD has changed my heart and my perspective.  Here's a poem I wrote when I was in high school, called "It"...   I’m so confused.  All I want is  Rest.  Three precious moments of peace.  My mind is burning with all of these  Questions.  Someone please help me.  I’m still here, fumbling in the eternal Night, struggling to survive.  Clouds of confusion envelop me.  I scream  Hysterically, reaching out for a grip on reality.  Am I getting closer, or farther Away?  I seem to be drifting…  Thoughts in my mind scurry around like Cockroaches scrambling for a place to hide.  Yet here I lay.  Motionless. Absolutely still.  My soul is too old.  I feel so Tired.  All I want is peace.  I’m so confused.  If I try hard  Enough, I’ll discover the truth.  The answer is here  Somewhere.  I just have to  Find It.  And here is a poem I wrote just about a year ago, called "divine blood and affection"...   discipline eludes me like a fragrance too stale to remember. purified by obedience.   what does that mean, anyway?  purity. the end.  why must the means be obedience?  one of those daunting words like submission. consistency. perseverance.  rebellion in me must be conquered. impale it upon spears of ruthless trust and nascent purity. emerge triumphant dripping in divine  blood and affection.   I really like the change.  I am incredibly grateful for the change, and that doesn't even begin to convey the meaning in my heart.  The LORD has been so amazingly merciful to me.  He is beginning to reveal to me how closely and tenderly He has held me in the protection of His arms.  Even the scars and brokennes are a protection, in a way.  He has revealed my weakness and need for Him, and it draws me to Him.  Further up and further in, I hear Him calling.

      What a fun new toy!  I don't know how long my fascination with this will last, if at all, but I thought it would be fun to start a weblog and see what comes of it.  Ideally I'd like this to be a place where I can process my thoughts about my relationship with the LORD, and whoever chooses to read it can comment on it - or argue with me, or agree heartily.  Whatever your little heart desires.  I find that I don't have the time to have the kinds of discussions that I'd like to about the Word, prophecy, prayer, etc. and I'm not currently in a Bible study, so perhaps this can be a place of spiritual stimulation and growth.  Who knows?  I've also found in the last few days that some of my dearest friends are frustrated with me because I haven't shared with them (for lack of time, mostly) the things I saw, heard, and learned from God in Russia/Siberia.  Well, hopefully this will be a forum for me to share some of those things, and to get some feedback.    So today I've been thinking about what God smells like.  Wondering, I suppose, would be a more appropriate word.  Does He smell like the outside world, since He is the Creator God, the uncreated One?  Does He smell like a campfire, since He is a Consuming Fire?  Does He smell like freshly baked bread, since He is the Bread of Life?  I started thinking, "Well, that's a dumb question, He's spiritual, so He probably doesn't have a physical smell."  But then I thought, "Jesus is both God and Man, and He has a body, so He has to have some kind of smell."  Not that this has any incredible spiritual bearing on my theology or anything, but I know that the Holy Spirit often uses my imagination to exhort me to think about Him in new ways, outside the box of my legalistic religiosity.  Also today God's been speaking to me (I love that He still talks to me on Sundays, even when I'm a pagan and have to go to work instead of church) about being a prophetic voice.  Not just the spooky-ooky "I have a specific word of the LORD for you" (although I do believe that's possible - I've been on the giving and receiving end of that before), but just the speaking forth of truth and life and light.  Words are so powerful, and even one word or a small phrase can be incredibly powerful.  In Mark 4:39 Jesus merely says "Peace.  Be still!" and the storm immediately subsides.  He had power, not just because He was and is God, but because He had the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the approval of His Father.  Which believers have access to!  There is a passage in Ezekiel 37 (the valley of dry bones) that has always intrigued me, and the Holy Spirit is beginning to give me insight to it, as I continue to listen to Him breathe through the pages.  It says...  1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?"  I said, "O Sovereign LORD , you alone know."  4 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD ! 5 This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath [1] enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD .' "  7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.  9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.' " 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet-a vast army.  11 Then he said to me: "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, 'Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.' 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O my people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the LORD , when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD .' "    There is so much here that I could talk about, but the clearest whisper I've heard from the LORD today is about the complaint from the dry bones in verse 11.  They say that they are dried up and their hope is gone.  They are cut off.  The LORD gave Ezekiel the power and the passion to prophesy to the dry bones and to give them life and hope.  There are so many people in my life right now who are dry, who are without hope, without a future.  It's because they are cut off from the LORD.  They are without the Source of Life.  I think especially of the teenagers I've just recently started to work with at my new job.  (I'm a technician/counselor assistant at a residential rehab center for teens with drug abuse and mental health issues.)  They are so hopeless, so lifeless.  And there are certain rules and regulations that prevent me from speaking openly about my faith - but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to pray like crazy for these kids and speak life and truth to them at every God-given opportunity.  My prayer for myself today, and for whoever is reading this, is that I (and you!) would be sensitive to the Holy Spirit, so that when He chooses to use me (and you!) as a mouthpiece, I (you!) can be a voice crying in the wilderness, a voice prophesying, "LIVE! LIVE!"  I also pray for a life of worshipful obedience.  One of the things the LORD spoke to me the most clearly in my recent trip to Siberia was "just obey me, girl."  Yes, there is grace.  Yes, there is mercy.  But as we are increasingly obedient to the LORD and His covenant with us, there is increasing intimacy, and increasing power.  With obedience comes purity, and a renewed sensitivity to the leading of the Holy Spirit.  There is a phrase from a song written by Jason Upton that says "there's a power in purity that breaks principalities, that brings the authorities down to their knees."  I'm not content with half-hearted obedience.  I'm not content with a lukewarm walk.  I want to KNOW the God who formed me in my mother's womb, the way that He knows me.  I want to hear His voice.  I want to see His face.  I want to know what He smells like!  ;o)  I want Him to use me to prophesy truth to the harassed and the helpless.  I want Him to use me to set the captives free.  I want Him to use me to break down the principalities of the prince of the air.  I want Him to use me to bring Him glory.  "I am my Beloved's, and His desire is for me."  I love this verse from Song of Songs, but I also want to reciprocate that desire.  I want my desire to be for the LORD, not for the things of this world, which are dust.  I am HUNGRY for the things of God.  I won't be satisfied anymore with money and perceived security and cheesy, false Hollywood concepts of romance.  Having a million dollars or a huge house or a husband is not what will give me life, or make me happy, or satisfy the deepest longings of my soul.  MY GOD SHALL SUPPLY ALL MY NEEDS, ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY.  HE WILL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE OVER ME, JEHOVAH JIREH CARES FOR ME.
