      I subscribed to a newsletter when I was pregnant with my 2nd child.  After 40 weeks, I thought the newsletters would just stop, considering that most pregnancies are around 40 weeks.  They did not.  I got week 41 and I thought, “well, some people are up to 2 weeks late, so maybe that is why I am still getting them?”  However, when I got the newsletter for week 44, I knew there was a problem.  After a few weeks of messages with titles like “Hello, you are now 50 weeks pregnant.  How do you feel?” I decided to try to “unsubscribe.”  So I clicked on the “unsubscribe” button only to find that they will require my password in order to stop sending me ridiculous emails.  Well it has been approximately 40 weeks since I signed up for this newsletter initially, so not only did I not remember the password, I did not even know my username!  Well of course you need your user name to access your password on the odd chance that in 40 weeks you may have forgotten it.  So I am basically doomed to receive these emails until I die or change my email address, whichever happens first.  Every time I get another email I just want to scream “I am apparently pregnant with an almost 2 year old.  How the fuck do you think I feel?!”

      To start out this log or blog, I will list a few things that I do not understand.  Maybe someone else understands these things and can clue me in?   *Pop up adds for software to eliminate Pop ups. Isn’t this blackmail??? Basically they are telling you that you have to buy their product to get rid of a problem they are causing or else you will continue to be harassed. This would be like some guy walking up to you and hitting you repeatedly until you agreed to buy his service as a bodyguard to protect you from people hitting you…  *The auto-glass people calling me to ask if I have a cracked or dinged windshield that I want repaired. If I wanted their services, I would call them. Do they believe that there are people who desperately want their services, but for some reason can’t get a-hold of them? As if someone is sitting at home and gets their call and exclaims, “Oh thank goodness you called!!! I have been trying to reach you for days now, but could not get through!” (Probably because the phone line was busy due to the fact that they were calling everyone in the city just to make sure nobody wanted to talk to them.) Other businesses do not do this…I never get a call from McDonald’s asking if I am hungry and wanted to buy a hamburger from them.  *Maxi pads designed for thong underwear…no explanation required…  *People who say “no offense” right before blurting something completely rude, as though “no offense” is a qualifier that prohibits you from becoming upset at their comment…i.e. “No offense, but you look like you have gained a lot of weight…”  *7 day return policies…Are these establishments worried that their products will not hold up past 7 days?  *How doctor’s offices will refuse to see you and often charge you a fee if you are more than 15 minutes late for an appointment or do not show up or cancel without giving 24 hours notice, but will leave you sitting in the waiting room for 3 hours when you arrived early, and not offer you any discount on your bill for the inconvenience of the wait!

      Well I have exhausted (nice word choice I think) every possible option for natural sleep aids, and am now just giving up. Like an idiot I drank coffee with dinner, although I could not sleep last night either, and had no coffee then.I have spent the last 4 or so hours surfing television channels in search of quality programming (*smirk*) and it is just not there.   I started out watching Disney channel’s “Bug Juice” which is like MTV’s “The Real World” reality show, but for pre-teens:) It is basically a show about pre-teen and teen kids at camp.  Then, I started watching old reruns of “L.A. Law” on A&E. Not a bad show, although the episode p*ssed me off because a man whose father was a diplomat violently raped a girl and then was set free due to “diplomatic immunity!” So now I have one more thing to be politically p*ssed about…  After that I started watching an infomercial about a tape that guarantees flat abs in only 6 weeks. LOL, if I had an extra $60 I might consider it! I am so tired of my little pooch! Something tells me though that there is fine print (so fine that I can not see it without a magnifying glass) that reads something like “Results are not typical. Likely the only weight you will loose is the 1 lb. From the $60 weighing down your wallet! This means you H!” After looking at about 300 obviously touched up “after” photos, I switched the channel…  Then there was the infomercial for the “amazing mattress!” This amazing mattress was supposed to form to your body shape. (I usually would describe a mattress that did this as “old and worn out,” but that just does not have the same ring to it as “amazing!”) Also, it was supposed to stay still while your partner moved. I guess the idea was that you would not wake up your loved one. The interesting part was the way they demonstrated it though. Here was the setup:  A 25 year old, blonde, 95 lb., Cheerleader type girl stands at one end of the bed in a semi-short red negligee. A wine glass half full of water is placed at the other end. The clueless blonde starts jumping up and down on her corner of the bed while an official sounding male voice commentates, “Look how the glass of water does not spill as Candy moves about!!!” Yeah…I am sure there are a great many people out there looking at the WATER;) I am not sure if they proved any point with the demonstration, but I am sure that many a man watching was happy that the official voice was able to make Candy “move about.” I am sure many men readily began practicing their official voices in hopes that they too could get someone to “move about” for a harmless experiment:)  When you start searching the channels for a better infomercial, you know that you have hit an all time low.  So now I sit here, too tired to clean, too tired to read, too tired to write anything worth anything, and worst of all, too tired to sleep. I guess I am back to bed to stare at the black ceiling again, or to make shapes in my mind from the lit numbers of the alarm clock, or maybe I should "move about" on my corner of the bed;p

      I wish that candidates would debate the issues and not engage in so many personal attacks.  I wish that there was a "perfect" mix of liberalism and conservatism in a candidate that actually had a chance of winning in our 2 party system:)  I wish that people would stop saying "grass roots."  I wish that fat free mayonaise tasted more like actual food.  I wish my Mother In Law were sentient.  I wish that my husband had the day off work:)  I wish Law and Order were on every second of every day...7 times a day is not really enough for me.  I wish I knew Kim Possible.  I wish for more wishes.

      What is the world coming to!?  It is *only* 3:30 am and there is nothing on TV!;)  Basically, the only thing still on is Profiler (and similar shows), Infomercials, and advertisements for sleeping aids!  I don’t like watching ads for sleep aids while I am awake at night.  I realize that they market them at night to catch an intended audience, but people who have trouble sleeping watch TV in the day time too.  Perhaps if I saw the commercials earlier in the day I would have a chance at obtaining the products so that I could sleep at night instead of watching their ad.  However, with their ads airing at night, I have little chance of obtaining the product after seeing the ad.  It feels like teasing to me, like when I see a Pizza commercial after the restaurant has already closed;)  Infomercials are bad enough without additional commentary LOL, so I won’t touch much on this one.  The fact is that it is both boring and disturbing to watch someone cut cans with knives (as though this is a normal activity of knife owners), mop ceilings with extended handled mops, and build muscles on contraptions that look as though they were designed by the military for torture.  The main problem with shows like Profiler, and other intense crime shows is that at 3:30 am, they scare the shit out of me!  I can barely watch these programs at 3:30 in the afternoon without constantly checking behind me!  So these are the choices I am left with…Of course I do have a DVD player and a VCR which I could utilize…but again it is 3:30 am…and I am not thinking clearly;)
