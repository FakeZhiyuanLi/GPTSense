      Its been a tiring week wandering around on the decision whether im going back to malaysia in one month time or earlier or not... got some probs with the london flats landlord, dont wanna discuss about it but it not that good... just paid up £500 for the reservation and its not refundable (by the law, damn it!). the reason being i've did it because i wanna ensure my family's stay here are as comfortable as possible. But still got the chance to turn things around on next monday meeting with me boss. Work wise, excellent. With all that side-stuff troubling me, i still can enjoy dearly the works. project managements and technical stuff, 2-in-1 work (multi-tasking kot...). Anyway, its good either experience wise or knowledge wise. Last sunday was an interesting one. Went to a small fishing village west of southend, called Old Leigh. Jump off from the Leigh-on-Sea station and walk balk along the seaside about 10 mins and ... walah! there it is. Luckily for me, there are helding a FOLK traditional marching ceremony, traditionally done but dont know the frequency per year. Anyway, eat some fresh seafoods, tasty fish and chips, bought some souvenier and headed back home. Bought also some cockles, mussles (fresh one maa!) and crab meats. If im still around there next time, definitely i wanna go there again. Got to head back to work! chiaow!

      Its been a very tiring weekend for my son, my wife and i. i brought them out to London, around the outskirts of Bermondsey (near Tower Bridge, one of the London's unique attraction). Purpose is to view a flat owned by an old Iranian.   At first i was quite sceptical about his honesty on the renting arrangement since i cant do the normal arrangement through the agent. That is because i dont have a proper working visa, just a normal business travel visa (i dont have to open an account since im not permanently working here). But when observing everything on him, and asking the rentee of his flat (he got 2 flats side by side to rent out), i can confirm that he is no fluke/scam (and hopefully its stays like that!). In fact he is kind enought to allow us renting out one of his flat for just two month. Quite cheap for a fullly furnished luxury flats, £350/wk except Council Tax. Over here usually arrangement length took minimum of 6 month. Over that, we only just pun a simple written agreement and put a very small refundable deposits.   I'm still not certain of him but tawakkal, InsyaAllah. I hope Allah puts the problem aside and easeness on my side. I love my family so much that im willing to do anything to ensure comfort and safety of them, even at this uncertain place, which somewhat can become very dangerous and challenging.  On sunday, due to the fact that my wife n my son spent one whole day on saturday on my occasion, i'd make sunday as theirs then. My wife asked me to buy a blouse and a vest-like t-shirt and some good clothing for my son. and myself pun join skali shopping! anyway we dont spend that much, only about £100 on the day including some other stuff (foods, utensils etc). Nevermind, its not everyday my wife shopping. At least she's happy. This is the first time actually this year me n my wife shopping good clothing! so £100 equivalent to RM6++ is definitely worth it (Dorothy Perkins, Dunlop Apparels etc)  Thankful to Allah for giving me such rezeki. Hope im spending it well...  And another thing, watch live England v France, so gutted with England defeat!!! last minute lak tu!!! Damn the French!!!  A thought of Razimo

      At last... Friday indeed. ofcoz almost all are lookin' forward for friday, not just because of weekend's comin', but for us muslim, today is the 'penghulu' of all the day in the week, and we muslim should be aware of that. A day full of hikmah, InsyaAllah.  Talking about friday, here at my place (Basildon, Essex, UK) which is 30 miles from east London, Friday prayer is something i would really look forward to... no intention for feeling riya'/show-off whatsoever, but over here the khutbah are very interesting to hear... and theres no specific text prepared, not like in malaysia (not all place but mostly i would say) especially in kl and selangor, the speech are readily prepared by the Jabatan Agama and the topics are not that ummpphhh. maybe thats why when people come to the mosque, quite a few yg fall asleep... ofcoz tired of working, but also due to the 'boring' speech. Here in my place, khutbah are presented in a very informal, free way. From the most basics topics up to the sensitive issues... n its in various language including arabic, english, urdu etc. Maybe one day one of my colleague could give out a khutbah and we all can see the difference...  Muslims here are very concerned over their safety and security over the issues of terrorism and hatred towards muslims are more and more obvious. Myself as well can feel the 'heat' and be very careful of people and the surroundings, which is quite uncomfortable for me outstationed here with my family.  O..well, looking forward to go home any time soon. Wanna play with my son in the back garden!!!  May Allah bless us all.  Some Thoughts of Razi M

      Howdy folks! it seems about a week since i last bloggin' ere. Nothing new, just wandering when i should be going back to malaysia. its been about more than 5 months ive been outstationed here, but at least i got to stay in a very good apartment... very good indeed. very easy to get around, near the historic tower bridge (every day cross that bridge to go to work). Catch a train at Fenchurch Street and off me go to Basildon, where all the challenge lies... To be honest, being outstationed for such a long time is very tiring indeed. I'm really hoping for a good trip back in Malaysia, eventhough immediately kena stationed plak kat Gurun, again. but only for a couple of weeks and then walah! holiday bebeh! kat mana lagi kalu tak at my parent-in-law house at lovely Telok Kalong beach at Kemaman. Very nice place! i would recommend that if u all want something different but near enought to Cherating, which is just 20-30mins drive (under the speed limit i would guess). And after that? probably attend the compulsory training for me to be upgraded. To be honest, im not attending the training just for the sake of 'going' only, but thouroughly i've enjoyed it. Thats maybe because its somewhat make alot of sence in relation to my current job. Anyway, its not cheap per training eventhough made internally. So why not make the best of it, right?  Hopefully i can meet my parents that i missed for about more than 8 months! gila ah! Wanna make a suprise to everyone end of this month so mama, ayah... jaga2 anakmu and the cucu(s?) akan kembali hehehe.... Adios all. wanna go back for dinner bah!

      Good Day to all. An long-awaited day has come... its my birthday today! so... what to rite, eh? I've just moved to an apartment in London, fully furnished and getting a tv tomorrow possibly. Muslim butheries and groceries stores (mostly pakis and arabs) are just around the corner (i mean less than a minute walk! i tell u..). Fruits and vegs also easy to get hold off.  I've got to go back to Malaysia to continue and supervise some works on the projects in Malaysia, in kedah to be specific (maybe can call Tariq and Rashid to have some drinks!). Anyhow, im in dire need of rest/break/holiday from this ever-tiring and mind-blowing challenging job.... almost six month and havent met my parents since december last year (they went to perform the haj). Good for them, Alhamdulillah. Talking 'bout rest and break, i might as well have a good, nice peaceful holiday, ofcourse going back to my mother-in-law's house in Kemaman. Why i like havin' my break there? no need to spend money on hotels, Good beach near the house (walking distance), food are prepared by my wife's family and ofcoz free!(hehe! really good food) and after all, after considering all reasons, its a win-win to all. The granny got to see their 'cucu', i got a good relaxing time, less money spent, my wife 'lepas rindu', everybody's happy! Im going to eat some roasted chicken today, n im really mean it! Grrrr! yummy!
