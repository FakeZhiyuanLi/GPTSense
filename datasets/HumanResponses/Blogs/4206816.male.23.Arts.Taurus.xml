      ok, so its the morning for me, at work 11 am sharp. drawing and what not. listning to sum music, and messin wit my celly.  i realized yesterday i have alot of shit to carry around, even if im just leavin the house for a bit, like a cell phone, wallet, a pen.. ynever know. an inhaler, i only carry that sumtimes tho, cause im allergic to dogs, and when i go over any friends house thats got a dog i need to make sure i bring it, then theres the cloves, i like the taste of the cloves, and i think it smells better than the regular cigs, but my friends disagree.  i need some new videogames to come out, i havent played that game i bought like at allll, im angry yet at the same time i was hoping it would have sum aspecs of the new game FABLE but it doesnt and it turns me off quicker than a stripper with crust in her g string.

      well its the weekend, and although sum may consider it a time of rest, i for one gear up all week for it!  Friday night. a time to rjoice with friends in the accomplishments of the week, or lack there of! Saturday, a day were i still work, in the pharmacy. it blows. shoot me. Sunday, the final day for some. not for me. mac, my friend who has a very scary resemblance to jesus, and the very talented guitarist for  urlLink www.silenceband.com  is throwing a party at his house. usually his parties are big and filled wit sum cute chicks. im the quiet type when it comes to girls or meeting anyone new for that matter, i like to feel um out, see what i can get away with without makin um feel unfomfortable, get away with what u say? being myself! lol, I speak my mind as much as possible but im not the type of guy who is brutaly honest, we have steve for that 8). But when i get nervous, or shy, it gets so tough to speak, and if i do, will it be sumthin stupid, yknow stuff like that, i get too self consious.  its a real bitch when just hangin at the bar. next thing i know im by myself.  well i have a great girlfriend and yur asking yurself why is he talking about meeting with other girls? imnot trying to hit on um,  when i go to a bar or club, i dont go prawling around like a lion in heat. i lay back and just watch as they walk by or usually just have a great time with my friends. its tough being in a long distance relationship, so i figure as long as i can atleast talk to somone of the opposite sex ill be sane for the time being lol!   Well my boss asked if i need any programs for the pc here, and i said yah. hes like well what can he look for that he might have. i saif either adobe illustrator or corel draw. turns out he has neither. so im goin to have to turn to my man of the hour,  bigjoepo!, hes got what i need when i need it, my boss, his name is adam, said he would hook me up wit blank cds for the goods.  so i accepted. hoping to god podawg can hook my shznite up!
