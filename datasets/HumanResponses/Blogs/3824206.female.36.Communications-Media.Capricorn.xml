      This editorial article appear on June 29 2004 in the Nes STraits Times. The hons. Education Minister Datuk Hishammuddin Hussein should also now look into online games. The amount of Digital Poison they send to the home to corrupt the mind of teenagers should qualify some online game companies to stand trial for human rights abuse and crime against humanity !!!!!   EDITORIAL: Cyberloafing  Editorial  June 29: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    FOR those under-18s addicted to the game at cybercafes, it is time to look for other outlets to release pent-up frustrations and tensions.  Maybe now is the time to go outdoors. It would definitely be healthier to get a bit of sunshine, and sweat never killed anyone. As unhappy as many will be with Education Minister Datuk Hishammuddin Hussein's decision to enforce the ban on under-18s in cybercafes, this has been done after much thought. The statistics show too many young people spending time at cybercafes at the expense of more important things. Unfortunate though it may seem that cybercafes are bearing the burden of the blame for social ills from truancy to gangsterism, the fact that many schoolchildren are packing these places when they should either be in school or at home has forced the authorities to come to this decision. Swift and strict measures must be taken to address these ills. If, for the moment, this seems to be the best solution, so be it. Minors have to look elsewhere for equally cheap and fulfilling activities or be accompanied by adults.  It is also unfortunate that because of these loafers and truants, all minors, including those who genuinely need to surf the Internet for their school projects, are now forbidden from entering these outlets. However, as in the past, whether or not cybercafe owners and operators pay heed to this ruling remains to be seen. It is crucial that they do — they and all those responsible for the well-being and future of all children. For there have been instances where the young patrons have been known to sleep at these cafes, so great is the addiction. Would it be too much to ask the authorities to provide computer facilities for those who cannot afford computers at home? This way, the activities are easily monitored and the less fortunate can still have access to the wonders of cyber-fantasy.

      This letter appear on June 28 2004 in The Star by "a concerned father". Looklike there are alot of unethical businessman with no moral obligation and social responsibilities.   Cyber cafes should only be allowed in certain areas  THE Education Minister was reported in The Star (June 23) to have been shocked when he found a Year One student in a cyber café.    The following day, Perak State Education Director, Datuk Adnan Ibrahim, conducted another raid where more students were caught in a cyber cafe.   Congratulations to both of them for highlighting this problem and expressing their concern.    However, that is only the tip of the iceberg.    Cyber café are mushrooming everywhere without control. Local authorities are issuing licenses without bothering about the social impact.    Just look at the number of cyber cafés springing up everywhere.    To expect the operators to be ethical and to control those under 18 from patronising cyber café is like entrusting a cat to take care of fish.   These operators are only interested in making money.   If the authorities are really concerned about this problem, they should limit the number of licences issued and enforced the ruling strictly.    Cyber café should not be allowed in housing estates and within certain distances from schools.       Regular surprise checks with the presence of reporters (to prevent allegation of hanky panky) should be conducted.      Premises with underage patrons should have their operations suspended on the spot for a period and their licences revoked if they are caught committing the offence again.      CONCERNED FATHER,   Klang.

      This letter appaer on June 26 2004 in The Star. Subsequently, The online game company send a retaliation letter throught their agent ( Jennifer Tai ) to codenm and ridicule Loceng Cat for seeking the authorities help to control the online games subscription to teenagers.  Jennifer Tai, you can fool some people some of the times. But whenever you do it, you are also losing your credibility.   " Beware of online snare  I HAVE a teenage son who is addicted to online games. It gives me no pride to admit this. It is out of desperation I write this open letter to all parents with the hope that they will not have to go through what I have gone through.   About a year ago, a new online game company was set up in Malaysia. An aggressive marketing campaign was carried out – it dropped free CDs into our mailboxes, outside schools, and targeting teenagers at shopping complexes.    They told my son that it was a “cute game” and it was free. A few months later, my son’s school performance started to deteriorate.   He started sleeping or couldn’t concentrate in class and missed classes. He lost interest in his studies. I didn’t know how to handle this situation. A month before his SPM examination, I managed to disconnect his PC and forced him to study.   Luckily, he passed his SPM examination. I was naive to think that he was over those computer games. Subsequently, I enrolled him in a private college.   For a while, my son did well academically in the college; he even obtained a merit award for academic performance. However, temptations were all around him. Outside his college are probably 40 to 50 cyber cafés promoting online games.   He became hooked on those games again. He would play until the wee hours of the morning and skipped classes frequently, and developed a foul manner.    In the meantime, both my wife and I suffered in silence. Our son lost interest in everything except the online games.   He has become more rebellious because I think playing the games has given him a false sense of security in his fantasy world.   Finally, we made the painful decision to take our son out of college. We are now searching for a rehabilitation centre to help him kick his habit.   Of course, not all online games are bad; it is only fair to say that there are also some very good educational games in the market.   While parents have a role in keeping their children away from unhealthy computer games, the authorities must assist in the area of enforcement by introducing regulatory measures to ensure the game contents are appropriate.   I suggest the authorities:    RESTRICT the setting up of cyber cafés to ensure proper guidelines are adhered to so that cyber cafés are not progressively turned into video arcades;   RELOCATE existing cyber cafés close to schools and colleges to a “safer” distance perhaps beyond a 5km radius;    INTRODUCE legislative measures to block games access from midnight to 6am for cyber cafes and in the homes;    INTRODUCE legislative measures to ensure that the purchases of games subscription have prior parental consent; and   INTRODUCE legislative measures to restrict content of online games.   I hope schools and colleges can conduct talks to advise students on the risks of game addiction.   I also hope all parents will monitor their children more closely, and not make the mistake I made.   LOCENG CAT,   Subang Jaya. "

      This articles appear in July 3rd 2004. Mr Ling, I share the same sentiments with you. Would the authorities kindly flush out all these social outcasts from the cyber cafes before it become too contaminated ?  " Cyber cafes are useful to most people  I OFTEN visit cyber cafes because of the high-speed access and find the RM1.50 an hour rate they charge is very reasonable.    The recent reports about teenagers playing truant and being addicted to online games have brought a bad image to cyber cafes.   The cyber cafés are not all bad, as people like me go there to surf the Internet while others do research for their assignments and a few play games.   It is sad that some of the operators have turned their cyber cafes into video arcades.    As they charge 50 sen or RM1 an hour, most of their clients are schoolchildren.   In order to discourage this, the authorities should:   ·INCREASE and restrict the charges at cyber cafes. This way schoolchildren will spend less time there because they can't afford to play online games.    ·RESTRICT schoolchildren from entering cyber cafes during school hours.    ·STOP firms from promoting and selling games through cyber cafes.   I hope that the authorities will not close all cyber cafes, as they do benefit people like me.      LING,   Perak.  "

      This article appeared on New Straits Times on July 2nd 2004. Teenagers and younster nowaday have the IQ but not the EQ anymore. The other day, my friends fired one young Australian Graduate less than 2 months after hiring him. Reasons : this young graduate is only interested in online games, not able to meet deadline, and always on MSN in the office. Another online gamers suck the dusts !!!   Regulating cybercafe business a better option  July 2: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I REFER to the report "Addicted to cyber-fantasy" (NST, June 28) and the letter "Hishammuddin missing the point" (NST, June 25).  Addiction in any form is bad. Addiction to online games is a serious form of social illness.  Smoking is bad for health and we enacted a law to prohibit the sale of cigarettes to minors and are conducting a campaign to encourage smokers to quit the habit. Drink driving is dangerous and we enacted legislation to enforce penalties for those caught driving drunk. We recognised that not all movies are suitable for the public, so we established a censorship board to review their contents prior to their release to the public.  Likewise, cybercafes by themselves do not cause social problems, but they are a contributing factor if they are not regulated. Banning cybercafes only deprives genuine operators from providing legitimate information technology services to the local community.  It is the responsibility of local authorities to introduce guidelines, review their appropriateness and enforce them to ensure cybercafes operate within the legal framework. In this regard, I would like to suggest that the local authorities consider the following:  * Ensure those under the legal age are not allowed into cybercafes;  * Ensure cybercafes are not located too close to schools, colleges, and universities;  * Ensure cybercafes operate within reasonable hours; and,  * Limit the number of cybercafes under their jurisdiction.  With regard to online games, not all are bad. But there are also online games with deceptive ill intent. The point is how many parents are capable of discerning the suitability of online games? I would like to suggest that the authorities implement the following:  * Empower the Film Censorship Board to review the contents and classify online games before their release to the public;  * Block access to online games from midnight to 9am;  * Ensure the online game provider obtains prior parental consent with regard to selling game subscriptions to minors; and,  * Conduct talks and a campaign to inform and advise on the dangers of game addiction.  I respect the courage of the Education Minister taking the initiative to conduct checks on cyber- cafes.  L.C.K. Subang Jaya

      I read with amusement of a recent letter by one so called editor of games magazine, Jennifer Tai, with regards to suitability of online games in " Tha Star ".   A quick check on her profile shows she is a self proclaimed game addict, unable to have normal social interactions, met her husband via online IRC chat, etc. Every companies she joined somehow went bad. She is now relying on writting games reviews for a livings. I read some of her game reviews, honest to heart, my comment is, she is good at notthing. The website operated by her hardly had any visitors. She is now championing the sholesome goodness of online games.  Somehow she felt threatened by a concern parent calling for the government to control online games in Malaysia. I got a feeling that she is worried that if the government clamp down on the online games, she would have nothing to write, and end up back to square one. She even go so low to attack a person in sufferings. This is the most despicable human being in the world.  Well, to this editor of a lesser known "games magazine". Be real ! the world you operated in is just a fantasy. Wake-up ! We have a discussions among us, have a real look of your photo and your credentials. And we have a good laught. You are a real joke ! Please don't feel insulted. As much as you like to insult others, you must be be able to take insults in this REAL World.  May GOD have mercy on you.

      This letter appears on 5th July 2004 in The Star. It look like The Star is only intereted to publish letter that is against community values. To the writer of this letter, the rules and regulations for operating a cyber cafe are very clear ! It is just that the operator are constantly trying to break the rules and regulations. We don't need cyber cafes if it is a source of social ills.   Ban cyber cafes if they’re a nuisance   THE Government encouraged us to use computers since we are now entering the age of ICT.   But the rules keep changing. We who operate cyber cafes obey. Then the rules change again.   Now, we are told we need an entertainment licence, not to allow entry to those 18 years and below, that our places must not have tinted glass windows and must close shop by midnight.   What’s next? If cyber cafes are such a nuisance, just ban them!   DOING BUSINESS MALAYSIAN STYLE, Perak.

      This Editorial Article appear on 5th July 2004 in the New Straits Times.     Tighten rules on cybercafe operations     July 5: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    A REPORT "Addicted to cyber-fantasy" in the NST on June 28 explained why youngsters frequent cybercafes.  Almost all the youngsters complained they were bored, tense and wanted to relax by playing games.  Some said they played to release tension from all the pressures of teenage life. Others have pointed out that instead of drugs they preferred cyber games.  Pupils hang out in cybercafes as a break from school lessons, tuition, swimming and piano classes and homework.  This is the reality today that more and more young people are getting addicted to cyber-fantasy. And this is a problem that the schools, parents and the authorities have to deal with.  There is nothing wrong playing computer games to relax, but this should be done in moderation. Any form of addiction is not good, particularly for pupils who have to sit for examinations.  What will be most undesirable is when addiction to computer games leads to gambling. While we are not against cybercafes, regulations governing them, especially over their location and enforcement, must be tightened to avoid social ills emanating from such places.  The Education Minister was reported in the media on June 23 to have been shocked when he found Year One pupils in school uniform in a cybercafe in Taman Shamelin Perkasa, Kuala Lumpur.  The following day, 21 secondary school pupils in uniform were rounded up at a cybercafe in Ipoh Jaya during a surprise check.  How is it that operators of such cafes allow pupils into their premises when the notices on the door clearly stipulate that pupils in uniform should stay out? Cybercafes are mushrooming all over the country and local authorities which issue licences to these operators are unable to monitor them. To expect cybercafe operators to be ethical and self-regulate is impossible, taking into account their financial interests.  The authorities must also take steps to ensure that any form of abuse should be curbed to prevent the emergence of social ills among the young.  All local authorities should ensure that cybercafe operators comply with the conditions of the licences such as operating within reasonable hours and not allowing in the underaged.  These cybercafes should not be located close to schools and institutions of learning.  With the emergence of the smart learning environment, acquiring knowledge and information must be done with adequate moral education.  More stress must be given to the inculcation of moral values in education to prevent the emergence of more computer crimes.

      On-line Identity -- Your “Avatar”   The on-line or virtual representation of you.  This should be you, with a reasonable and limited amount of anonymity. However, many MMORPG and other on-line gamers choose an “avatar” (image of a character, real or fantasy) to represent themselves.  This may be tailored to their on-line world, character’s class and race, guild, or even to a specific attitude or attribute they wish to personify.  Many gamers have even gone as far as to create a fictitious story or background for some origins of their on-line life. Online game such as Ragnarok is an example of online game worshipping Satan. The game is a very easy game with unlimited levels, targetted mainly to teenagers with low esteem and inferiority complex who are incapale of coping with real life issues.  An Anonymous Means by which to Escape  Everyone has a few dreams or fantasies about what they would like to do with their lives, or a fictional character’s life they would like to experience. It’s just human to have even a little bit of imagination.  But that is where it stays. In our thoughts, in our dreams, and in games we create and play, our imagination is a tool of creativity and desires. However, Imagination left unchecked or unbalanced between fantasy and real life is sure to leave people stranded in limbo, gamer or not. Your on-line identity is the anchor of your imagination; therefore it is something that centers your virtual life and either grounds it with the real world or lets it fly untamed.  For on-line gamers or on-line community members who maintain a good balance between their virtual and real lives, on-line identity may not be an issue.  However, for those with compulsive or addictive on-line habits, small changes or differences in their on-line identities may help them fight their addiction. Addicted gamers will often spend as much time as possible within the game, neglecting real world responsibilities and requirements. Their fictitious and possibly anonymous on-line identity does nothing to remind them of the real world, only helping to keep them locked into the game’s fantasy environment.  We don’t want any of our visitors to misunderstand our intentions or come to a premature conclusions that we’re an anti-gaming organization.  Most of us have left our on-line games behind, but that doesn’t mean we expect everyone else to do the same.  Some of us still play other games, even ones that are considered to be “on-line”.  However, your identity within an on-line game or community will act as a crutch for your addiction. We hope the information we provided helps you realize the need to change your on-line identity to reflect the “real” you.  This is one of the last steps your webmaster completed, to remove his fictitious avatar and replace it and his on-line identity with his real pic. He still uses his screen name for a mild bit of anonymity, but his character’s fantasy past and story are, well, history (no pun intended). If you are in the middle of changing your on-line avatar or fantasy profile, consider a possibility other than some fictitious character. It is such a simple, yet profound awakening to use your own pic as your on-line identity.  If you can’t take a pic of yourself, as a friend to help. May be you’ll have problems getting that pic into a digital form? Many print shops, like Kinko’s, will help you scan your image into a computer and save it on a floppy disk. If it still seems too daunting or you’re just not ready to give up your anonymity, then simply take down your old fictitious avatar, sig, or character. Start with just text about you as a real person, or a brief description of your life and your direction. No need to give all of your personal life’s details, just things you’re proud of, such as opinions, stances, and ideals.  Why must your on-line identity be in the form of something else or someone else you admire or find interesting? Who said you have to be so reclusive and secretive in your on-line profile?  There are no rules here, only misconceptions because so many other addicted on-line gamers make fictitious on-line identities. Be proud of who you are!

       On-line Friends and Guildmates     I remember a brief e-mail conversation I once had with an on-line gamer who will remain anonymous. “Why do you still play the game even though you no longer enjoy it?” I asked him, and he answered, “All of my friends are there, my guildmates and my raiding buds play all the time”. This is very typical.  The friendships and relationships you build within an on-line game may become quite powerful and can very well take the place of friends in your real life. In itself, and while you continue to play, there is nothing wrong with building these relationships as they become very supportive. However, when you decide to leave your on-line game, your on-line friendships and relationships may have devastating effects.  Here you will learn about these effects and what is required to overcome them.   On-line Friends are Not Real Friends  As hurtful as this may sound, this is far often true.  May gamers will emphatically insist that one's online friends are as real and as good as real life friends. While these friends within the virtual world or universe of your on-line game act, talk, support, and protect you as a real friend would, the limits of this friendship end with the game.   On-line gamers often spend countless hours building their on-line friendships and relationships, filtering those individuals they do not trust or those who do not share the same ideals and goals. Gamers will spend time rallying their friends, supporting each other by creating and running quests, helping each other level, going on raids together, and helping players with all kinds of tasks like finding their epic or a specific item.  Sometimes, if the friendships are strong enough, the gamer will even counseling people both in and out of game with real life issues.   Although this is friendship, it is only given for as long as the gamers keep playing the on-line game.  These friendships typically end when one leaves the game, or shortly after. From our personal experience and from research we preformed with the help of other recovered on-line game addicts, we found that there was never a single instance where on-line gaming friends remain good friends when one of them leaves the game.  Often the friendship diminshes because the lack of constant communication and appearance within an on-line game.  Typically strong on-line friendships will remain intact for approximately 1-2 months after a player leaves the game. E-Mail, message board, chat room, and instant message communication continue for a while.  Soon both parties will realize that they are in two separate worlds now. One person is still an on-line gamer, spend much of his or her free time in the game and find they want to spend less and less time trying to communicate with a friend who no longer plays. The other person now realizes that they don’t want to spend time talking about the latest quest or raid because they no longer play the game and therefore find other, more valuable things in which to spend time.  Most players leave a game with the intention of keeping in touch with a handful of their "closest" friends from the game.  They believe the rapport built up between them and their friends would help their friendships last over a long period of time.  They are almost always wrong. Gamers who’ve recently quit soon realize that they’ve isolated all their real life friends by playing the on-line game, and have also lost all of their on-line friends by quitting.  This is one very important reason why OLG-Anon is here and why we continue to support each other through our message board.   The on-line friendships will soon vanish, no matter how much time a person spends e-mailing their buddies, posting within the on-line game message boards, or even instant messaging.  The gamers still within the on-line game will start to reply with less and less detail as to how they were doing, and sooner or late, the person who left will never hear from them again.  Sometimes the person who left the on-line game will grow tired of hearing about the latest raid of quest and eventually stop responding on their own.  What once was your best and closest on-line friends will no longer have any time for you.  Very sad, but this is why recovered on-line gamers and OLG-Anon knows that on-line friendship and relationship does not carry over to the real world. Soon, a gamer who recently quit, will start to realize how empty and shallow the vast majority of on-line friendships and realtionships are. Addicted gamers will soon isolate their real life friends, just as you’ve probably done to yours.  Guess what?  When you’ve quit, you’re now a real life friend to them, and they will isolate you.     Guilds and Guildmates, On-Line Families that Come and Go Every wonder why so many gamers decide to form guilds, make guild charters, create a website for their guilds, elect guild officers, and even arrange guild marriages?  It’s because gamers want to feel like they belong to something greater than themselves. They want to belong to a cause, be closer to their friends, or just make new friends -- guildmates who have already been screened by the guild before acquiring membership. There’s nothing wrong with becoming part of a group of people, or wanting to belong.  What is unhealthy is your on-line gaming addiction, and belonging to a guild is one of the worst things you can do to keep that addiction alive. Your guildmates will constantly “pull” you back into the game after you’ve logged.  Through your dedication to helping your friends, preparing quests, organizing raids, and just helping newbies in the guild, you will be finding more excuses to keep playing.  Why?  Well, seeking an existing group of friends is very similar to seeking people to act as an extended family construct. It is the desire of every socially inclined person alive, and it is natural to have this desire. We probably all do it at work or at school.  Companies and organizations are founded by groups of business friends who are all interested in similar goals.  This searching for a group of friends is very beneficial in the real world, however it will disastrous to overcoming your on-line game addiction. Groups of friends try their best to stick together.  Losing a member of that “family” is not just a loss to one individual, it is a loss to the group. The last thing your guild wants is to have you quit the on-line game.  Don’t fret, as you shouldn’t feel bad for leaving your guild.  You’ve awakened from the addiction, but your guildmates haven’t... yet. If you truly want to kick your on-line game addiction, and you are vocal in your efforts, you will typically find two different responses from your guildmates.  They might defend the guild’s purpose and the on-line game, and ask you to stay. Your friends might say things like, “the guild won’t be the same without you”, “you can’t go just now”, or may be “you’re going to miss out”.  Most will do whatever they can, within limited reason, to keep you both in the game and in the guild. Don’t break down.  Tell your guildmates that this move is important to you and essential to ending your addiction.  You might not feel comfortable expressing your addiction awareness to them, and want to either fabricate a story or avoid giving a reason.  Whatever helps you leave your guild and the game is fine, but remember that you may want to contact these guildmates later and tell them about your departure. Explaining a lie may be a bit uncomfortable if you’ve dug yourself in too deep.     They may be fairly quiet about your announcement, taking time to look within themselves -- they may be introspective. Your friends might realize that one of their guildmates is leaving because he or she has realized their real life has become unmanageable.  They may even ask you serious questions regarding the reasons behind your leave of the game.  Be truthful with these guildmates, because they also might be considering the possiblity of leaving the game or seeking help for their addiction. We’ve mentioned all of this under the assumption that your guild is a strong one with close and solid on-line friendships. However, some guilds are merely a clustering of people.  Guilds with no defined direction or goals may soon find themselves disbanded. Regardless of how close the members of your guild are, guilds are not always reliable or inseparable. Unfortunately, there isn't the commitment of "friendship" between guildmates when compared to groups of friends who see each other in real life.  It's very easy to let down a group of friends in the game, or so to say, “blow someone off”.  These people would generally not do that real life friends, or the lines that they cross are typically much farther apart in real life.  On-line games add a customizable amount of anonymity that you otherwise wouldn’t find in real life.  Being anonymous or semi-anonymous gives some people the feeling of invulnerability and they might choose to take advantage of this situation.  “In one of the guilds I was friends with, there was a very close relationship between a guy and a girl. They were inseparable for well over a year, chatted in game, hunted together often, and were for all practical purposes, "married" in game. Recently, the guy found out that the girl he was "dating" was actually another guy in real life who was [messing] with him all along. This happens all the time.” -anonymous gamer

       What is Addiction?  This defining information was taken from sites pertaining to drug abuse. The word drug has been placed in quotations to emphasize a replacement point for other types of addiction (EQ, Internet etc.).  What is Addiction? 'There are as many potential definitions as there are groups with an interest in defining addiction. These definitions emphasize such things as physiological dependence, psychological dependence, family dynamics, behavioral problems, and morality. '  Does "Addiction" Mean Only Drug Addiction? 'No matter what "drug" is involved, the disease of addiction appears to follow a predictable course. Typically, the user begins out of some level of curiosity. If the initial experience produces pleasurable results, the individual will more then likely move on to recreational use, such as with friends, at parties or on the weekends. As they come to enjoy the" drug" more and more, it is inevitable that the usage will increase, such as using during the week on a regular basis. Soon, their lives become more and more centered around getting the "drug" and finding opportunities to use it. It begins to interfere with relationships, school, work, and other formerly productive areas of interest in their lives. By now the "drug"-dependency, the addiction, have taken control, and the individual is unable to function without the "drug". If there is not a physical addiction, there is most certainly a psychological dependency upon their "drug" of choice. And if their "drug" of choice is not easily accessible, they will resort to whatever it takes to obtain that "drug".'  About Addiction 'Addictive "drugs" activate the brain's reward systems. The promise of reward is very intense, causing the individual to crave the "drug" and to focus his or her activities around taking the "drug". The ability of addictive "drugs" to strongly activate brain reward mechanisms and their ability to chemically alter the normal functioning of these systems can produce an addiction. "Drugs" also reduce a person's level of consciousness, harming the ability to think or be fully aware of present surroundings.'  Why People Are Addicts 'No one wants to be an addict, but this doesn't stop people from getting addicted. The most commonly asked question is simply - how? How could my son, daughter, father, sister, or brother become a liar, a thief, someone who cannot be trusted? How could this happen? And why won't they stop? The first thing you must understand about addiction is that addictive substances are basically painkillers. They chemically kill physical or emotional pain and alter the mind's perception of reality. They make people numb. For addictive substances to be attractive to a person there must first be some underlying unhappiness, sense of hopelessness, or physical pain.' Addiction Follows A Cycle Like This: 'The life cycle of addiction begins with a problem, discomfort or some form of emotional or physical pain a person is experiencing. They find this very difficult to deal with. We start off with an individual who, like most people in our society, is basically good. This person encounters a problem or discomfort that they do not know how to resolve or cannot confront. This could include problems such as difficulty "fitting in" as a child or teenager, anxiety due to peer pressure or work expectations, identity problems or divorce as an adult. It can also include physical discomfort, such as an injury or chronic pain. The person experiencing the discomfort has a real problem. He feels his present situation is unendurable, yet sees no good solution to the problem. Everyone has experienced this in life to a greater or lesser degree. The difference between an addict and the non-addict is that the addict chooses drugs or other substances as a solution to the unwanted problem or discomfort.'  The Addiction Progresses 'Analogous to an adolescent child in his first love affair, the use of drugs or alcohol becomes obsessive. The addicted person is trapped. Whatever problem he was initially trying to solve by using drugs or alcohol fades from memory. At this point, all he can think about is getting and using drugs. He loses the ability to control his usage and disregards the horrible consequences of his actions. '  Addiction Tolerance 'In addition to the mental stress created by his unethical behavior, the addict's body has also adapted to the presence of the addictive substance. He will experience an overwhelming obsession with getting and using his "drugs", and will do anything to avoid the pain of withdrawing from them. This is when the newly-created addict begins to experience "drug" cravings. He now seeks "drugs" both for the reward of the "pleasure" they give him, and also to avoid the mental and physical horrors of withdrawal. Ironically, the addict's ability to get "high" from the "drug" gradually decreases as his body adapts to the presence of foreign influences. He must take more and more, not just to get an effect but often just to function at all. At this point, the addict is stuck in a vicious dwindling spiral. The "drugs" he abuses have changed him both physically and mentally. He has crossed an invisible and intangible line. He is now an addict.'  Addictions and Problems 'A person tries "drugs." The "drugs" APPEAR to solve his problem. He feels better. Because he now SEEMS better able to deal with life, the "drugs" become valuable to him. The person looks on "drugs" l as a cure for unwanted feelings. The painkilling effects of "drugs" become a solution to their discomfort. Inadvertently the "drug" now becomes valuable because it helped them feel better. This release is the main reason a person uses "drugs" a second or third time. It is just a matter of time before he becomes fully addicted and loses the ability to control his "drug" use. "Drug" addiction, then, results from excessive or continued use of physiologically habit-forming drugs in an attempt to resolve the underlying symptoms of discomfort or unhappiness.'  How Addiction Affects Behavior 'The addict will now attempt to withhold the fact of his "drug" use from friends and family members. He will begin to suffer the effects of his own dishonesty and guilt. He may become withdrawn and difficult to reason with. He may behave strangely. The more he uses "drugs", the guiltier he will feel, and the more depressed he will become. He will sacrifice his personal integrity, his relationships with friends and family, his job, his savings, and anything else he may have in an attempt to get more "drugs." The "drugs" are now the most important things in his life. His relationships and job performance will go drastically downhill. There is such a thing as an "addictive personality." It is artificial and is created by addictive substances. "Drugs" can change the attitude of a person from his original personality to one secretly harboring hostilities and hatreds he does not permit to show on the surface. This establishes a link between "drugs" and increasing difficulties with crime, production and the modern breakdown of social and industrial culture.'

       Massively Excessive   The Massively Multiplayer Online Game (“MMOG”) stands just behind the violent video game on the public scrutiny firing line. Although there has not been a corresponding legislation explosion targeting the MMOG (as there has been with violent video games), today’s MMOG has been blamed for failed relationships and marriages, bad parenting, even serious injuries and deaths (the Everquest Widows online discussion forum is riddled with these and other experiences).  MMOG critics argue that game developers have designed MMOGs to be addictive and that it is from this design element that many, if not all of the alleged MMOG problems flow. The argument goes that but for the respective gamer’s addiction to the MMOG, that particular gamer would pay more attention to his or her real life responsibilities.   Some critics also claim that MMOGs should bear warning labels alerting buyers that MMOGs are addictive and not suitable for those with addictive personalities or related problems.  Lawsuits have been threatened and legislatures (at the local, state, and national levels) have demonstrated a willingness to promulgate anti-video game statutes with speed and frequency; however, a large-scale public assault on the MMOG has yet to manifest. This roundtable will discuss (i) what developers and the industry can and/or should do (if anything) to stem the possible tide of anti-MMOG legislation or litigation and (ii) what developers and the industry can and/or should do (if anything) to help gamers play more responsibly – all of this with an eye toward maintaining integrity of game design and gameplay.

       Violence Breaks out in Cyber Cafes   By Gretchen Hyman   Los Angeles cyber youth are the subject of a recent investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department following a yearlong streak of violence at citywide cyber cafes.   On Monday, Dec. 30, Los Angeles police reported a PC game-related dispute outside a cyber cafe called NetStreet in the Northridge area of the city that involved several teens using chairs and steel pipes as weapons. One teen was shot in the leg and another teen suffered a head wound, police said. Some reports said the brawl involved nearly 100 people.   Earlier this year, a youth was shot and killed outside the same cafe in Northridge.   According to police, Monday's brawl is among 300 similar incidents over the past year that have become commonplace at cyber cafes. The epicenter of cafe-related violence has been in the Garden Grove and South Los Angeles areas of the city where unrestricted PC gaming is a popular pastime for teens.   The catalyst for the violent outbreaks is partly being blamed on the online game Counter-Strike, a multiplayer counter-terrorism game that uses cash prizes to drive competition between players.   Counter-Strike, among many other popular violent combat simulator games, enables players to role-play as either terrorists or counter terrorists and involves the use of guns, grenades, bombs, hostage situations, and assassinations.   Counter-Strike is marketed by the gaming unit of Vivendi Universal and is not intended for players under the age of 17 because of its violent nature.   In reaction to the surge in teen violence, City Councilman Dennis P. Zine, a former police officer, has demanded a citywide investigation by LAPD into Internet cafes.   Zine will introduce a motion at a hearing next week calling for reports on all cyber cafe-related violence throughout the city.   Last December, Garden Grove, Calif., a suburb of Orange Country that is heavily populated by Vietnamese and Korean immigrants, experienced a rash of cyber cafe violence that began with the murder of a Vietnamese American youth with a screwdriver in the parking lot of a cyber cafe. In the following months, other violent incidents occurred outside the same cafe, reports said.   In some of the reported cyber cafe episodes, police are looking into the possibility of Asian gang activity, although no charges have yet been confirmed by police.   Earlier this year, Los Angeles council members passed an ordinance that required the presence of security guards at cyber cafes that stay open to the public at night.   Pending results from the citywide investigation into cyber cafe violence, Zine and fellow city council members are proposing that cyber cafes be more closely regulated and that in addition to the steady presence of security guards, that they carry age restrictions.   Zine does not directly blame cyber games for the violence but rather youth gangs that congregate in such places without proper supervision.   "Since cyber cafes are a growing industry, they require increased safety measures," said Zine. "As far as the game content, I don't want to restrict anything or intrude upon people's freedom of expression. I just want adequate safety for these kids," said Zine. "We have restrictions for many other types of late night businesses. Bars have to close by a certain time, and yet in this industry, there are no restrictions whatsoever."   According to Zine, the ordinances city council is calling for will be swiftly enacted in hopes of avoiding any more violence.

      Virtually addicted   Thailand's government is taking steps to combat dependence on online games, as Rhianna Pratchett explains   Saturday July 12, 2003   Forget drink or drugs: computer games are being targeted as the latest dangerous addiction.  The government of Thailand is now so worried about the rise of online games addiction that it is set to impose a curfew on gamers, banning them from using games servers between 10pm and 6am.   The unprecedented measures follow increasing pressure from parents and politicians in Thailand to protect young children from the dangers of excessive online game playing.   The ban is due to be implemented during a trial period between July 15 and September 30, and will also curb the business hours of internet cafes.   Ragnarok Online, the Korean online role-playing game, was highlighted by Thai authorities as being a cause for concern. Subscriptions to the game have reached more than 500,0000 in Thailand alone, with growth also on the increase in Japan and Korea.   However, this is not something unique to Asian-Pacific gamers, as the flourishing popularity of online games such as EverQuest, Anarchy Online and Dark Age of Camelot have been causing concerns in the west for several years.   As most gamers will admit, it is all too easy to get sucked into a game and, hours later, still find yourself glued to your computer keyboard.   What makes online games particularly addictive is that players can create their own alternate universe, in which they get to virtually live another life in a fantasy setting, amongst a community of other players.   In an interview with ZDNet, Dennis Bennett, a network engineer from Indiana, explained how his obsession with EverQuest almost ruined his life.   "I ceased being me," admitted Bennett. "I became Madrid, the great shaman of the north. Thinking of it now, I almost cringe: it's so sad.   "I'd say that the most addictive part for me was definitely the gain of power and status, the way in which, as you progressively gain power, you become more of an object of awe to the other players ... each new skill isn't enough."    Having said this, it seems sensible that young children should be protected from becoming too attached to gaming but, as with past fears over the violent nature of some computer games, parental intervention is usually the best method of nipping potential problems in the bud.   But, if you find yourself still hooked into a virtual life at 4am, trust me: you're probably better off getting some sleep and a bar of chocolate.

      Thai government imposes night curfew on online gaming  Rob Fahey 16:20 08/07/2003 Gamers to be blocked from servers from 10pm to 6am amid fears of addiction  Authorities in Thailand are set to impose a strict curfew on online gaming which will see access to online game servers blocked between 10pm and 6am every day, with Internet cafes also facing curbs to their business hours along the same lines.  The move, which is a trial measure set to run from July 15 to September 30, comes amid fears of rising rates of addiction to certain online games among younger players - with the Korean role-playing game Ragnarok Online being singled out as a particular cause for concern.  Ragnarok, which recently left its beta testing phase, was introduced to Thailand seven months ago and currently has well over half a million subscribers there. The game is also hugely popular in Korea, Japan and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, and its popularity is growing fast in the USA and Europe - leading to speculation that it will soon be the most popular online game in the world.  Thai Information and Communications Technology minister Surapong Suebwonglee announced the package of measures to combat online game addiction today, addressing concerns from parents and politicians that children as young as seven are becoming heavily addicted to the games and playing them for many hours at a time.  As well as the curfew, the measures also include mandatory play breaks every two hours in Internet cafes - presumably an attempt to combat afflictions such as deep vein thrombosis, caused by remaining sedentary for hours at a time, which have killed a number of gamers in the Far East in the past year.

      Thailand restricts online gamers  People the world over participate in online gaming  Thailand is to impose a night curfew on online gaming, because of concerns about rising addiction rates among young players. The curfew will mean that game servers will be blocked between 2200 and 0600 daily from 15 July, according to technology minister Surapong Suebwonglee.  Internet cafes specialising in online gaming have mushroomed in Thailand in recent years, with prices per hour averaging as little as 10 to 20 baht (24 to 48 cents) an hour.  Of particular concern is the Korean role-playing game Ragnarok, a satan worshipping game, which has over 600,000 registered players in Thailand,  many of them children.    "Ragnarok has become a drug, and all of my friends are addicted to   it. Nobody plays soccer with me now." -- Thai student  "As a matter of fact Ragnarok is not a violent game," said Mr Suebwonglee, "but its problem is that child players are becoming addicted, so we have to prevent children playing for long periods of time."  Mr Sisak Jamonaran, president of Thailand's Computer Society, agreed that the situation was getting out of hand.  "The problem with Ragnarok is that there is no time limit. A game can last over more than 24 hours," he told the BBC's East Asia Today programme.  "Players become obsessed and they lose interest in other activities," he said.  One young student, quoted by the Nation newspaper, said: "Ragnarok has become a drug and all of my friends are addicted to it. Nobody plays soccer with me now."  "We are a happy family. I wish critics of the game would try playing it first." Ragnarok claimed.

      EA Denies "Sims Addiction"- Lies to Congress   REDWOOD CITY, CA- Since its launch in November, The Sims Online has shot straight to the top of the top seller lists, leaving a trail of broken families and shattered lives in its path. The game where players control a number of virtual humans has ensnared thousands of real people in its mind-numbing web. All the while Electronic Arts, the game's maker, continues to maintain that the ceaseless, pixel-pushing drudgery of The Sims Online is nothing more than a fun escape from the very real drudgery of everyday life. Still, the Federal Trade Commission is looking into allegations that the game is "dangerous and addictive," and several consumer advocates have called for the title to be banned.   Last month Electronic Arts CEO Larry Probst testified before a Congressional committee that The Sims is not addictive and that such a notion is, in his words "dunder-headed." However, the story didn't end there. Last week, a leaked memo from deep within EA indicated that the company has known for years just how addictive the game really is and that it actually designed The Sims Online to enhance the addictive nature of their product.   Once this came to light, EA executives were again called before Congress and threatened with purgery charges. Probst denied that The Sims Online is habit-forming and then went on to deny his previous testimony. Committee members reminded the executive that we was under oath and not to be so defensive.   "I wouldn't characterize my statements as defensive, Mr. Congressman," Probst told the committee. "With all due respect, I submit that your behavior has been more than a little antagonistic."   As the debate over Sims Addiction rages on, the effects of the disorder can be seen everywhere. Some at the Centers for Disease Control are seriously thinking of classifying it as an epidemic.   Todd Harpum, a counselor at an area behavioral rehabilitation center, says he has seen over a hundred patients in the past month, all suffering from Sims Addiction. "We had a similar event during the Tetris outbreak of the late 80's. This looks several times worse."   Though some may dismiss it, Sims addiction is as real as any other physical dependency. The periods of lost time and obsessive behaviors associated with problem Simming can affect work, home, and family life.    Bob Rollo, owner of Rollo's Bar & Grill, says he is concerned for his business. This year's numbers are far lower than the usual post-holiday traffic and Rollo blames the game for encouraging people not to leave their homes.   Health experts point to statistics for the period immediately following the online game's release and predict a baby bust in the fall of 2003 owing to the fact that so many people have lost their interest in interaction with fleshy humans in favor of pixel-based ones. In short, people have stopped having sex.   "The issue of whether EA lied to Congress about Sims Addiction is nothing more than a distraction," argues consumer advocate Ralph Nader. "What we really need is a way to help people quit."      Several companies have offered to manufacture dongle devices to automatically quit the game after a predetermined amount of time: first three hours, then two, then one. Proponents of the system say that within a few weeks, a player could become completely free of Sims cravings.   Unfortunately, several Sims addicts in the test group simply went out and bought new computers. As if that weren't enough, Electronic Arts claimed that the after-market products violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and had the dongle makers hanged.   On Monday GlaxoSmithKilne announced that a Sims cessation aid is in the pipeline and should be on store shelves by the fall. The product, which will likely come in the form of a skin-adhesive patch, will slowly release a feeling of belonging and God-like power throughout the day.   However, officials at the FDA are concerned that the patch itself may become far more dangerous and addictive than the game itself.

      Man dies after playing computer games October 10 2002  A 24-year-old South Korean man died after playing computer games nonstop for long duration, police said yesterday.  The jobless man, identified by police only by his last name Kim, was found dead at an Internet cafe in Kwangju, 260 kilometres southwest of Seoul, they said.  Quoting witnesses, police detective Oh Myong-sik in Kwangju said the man had been virtually glued to the computer since late last Friday and had no decent sleep and meals.  The man collapsed in front of the counter early yesterday but soon regained consciousness. He then went to the toilet where he later was found dead, the police officer said.  Initial investigation ruled out the possibility of murder, police said. An autopsy was planned.  South Korea is among the world's most Internet-savvy nations with more than half of its 47 million people having access to the Internet. South Korea has some 22,000 Internet cafes, also known as PC rooms.  Many PC rooms are open 24 hours, but no minors are allowed after 10 pm.
