      [A little recap of my weekend holiday on the Sunshine Coast.]  With the falling through of my weekend camping plans, a quick audible left me heading out from work early to make my way to Vancouver with the eventual destination of Gibsons.  As the temperature was pushing 30 degree the bus ride to Swartz Bay proved to be less than comfortable.  For some reason – though I am sure there is a good reason – the air conditioning was only put on every 20 minutes and for no more than a minute or two.  What is more ridiculous – that the bus is apparently designed (or policy dictates) that the air conditioning can not be left on or that the bus has air conditioning?  It is a pampered lifestyle indeed when one can only find the lack of continuous air conditioning to complain about.  As usual, the ferry sailing over was gorgeous as the scenery is hard to match.  I spent the entirety of the trip lounging in the sun, soaking in the sights and reading.  Finished Animal Farm by George Orwell (highly recommended) and started Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift (a classic that has failed to capture my interest so far).  Jumped a few buses and eventually found myself near Granville Island with an expired bus transfer so decided to walk around the island.  All the shops were closed - it being close to 20:00 by this time - and I would have killed for an ice cream or a cold beer, though it is a bargain to give up the beer to have Granville Island without the usual overflow of tourists.    Eventually arrived at Gwen’s house for the evening around 21:30 where she promptly offered me a cold beer.  A better friend can not be found.  With hunger driving my thoughts we set off to the grocery store to find it well past operating hours.  A healthy dinner of a slurpee and chocolate bar followed.  With my stomach content, we sat down to watch “Bring It On” – a classic in its own right.  A night on the local playground with the conversation of good friends ended a wonderful day.  Enter Saturday and another brilliant ferry ride to bring Gwen and I over to Gibsons.  Gus meet us at the ferry terminal, we swung by his place to drop off our belonging, browsed Greta’s wonderful garden (a green-thumb indeed!), and quickly departed to see the Sea Cavalcade parade with its kids scrambling for candy, police and fire truck sirens, marching bands (including an accordion band), beautiful BC Ferries float, kids pulling tricks on dirt bikes over a car pulling a jump!, and the near unbearable heat of a summer day.  Truly something special about small town community spirit and Gibsons displays it well.  With hunger dictation our plans we headed off to the famed Gumboot Café.  All three of us invested in the Thai Noodle Salad though the Buddha Bowl appears to be all the rage these days.    After baking on the beach for an hour or two with the occasional dip we struck up a game of bouche ball and quickly learned Gwen is a seasoned pro.  Well, at least when she is playing with blue! The beach also made it clear to me why people invest in sunscreen.  Peeling away and having kids scatter in fear of catching leprosy is not the fun I imagined it might be.  We followed the beach with a hike up Roberts Creek - one of my favorite places on the planet.  Swimming in the cool, clean water under a brilliant waterfall leaves little else to be desired.  Gwen seemed to find a tranquil frame of mind there and I am enthralled she was able to make the trip if only for this one experience.  Made out way back to Mr. Guzek’s house and put together a Greek salad and barbequed some steak.  With the sun about to set we wrapped up dinner and headed down to the waterfront to enjoy it.  Perhaps the best beer I have had in some time.  The night was now upon us and the night brought dancing in the street as part of the Sea Cavalcade festivities.  Those who know me will know how dearly I enjoy a chance to dance.  With the band taking a short break, it was time to have a serious moment after this day of youthful adventure so Gwen and I ventured to roll down the library hill.  I swear it was not just me who failed to roll down in a straight line – Gwen was surely equally at fault!    We danced until the band retired for the night and walked home with dear Sarah whom had been MIA for most of the evening.  To our delight, the northern lights were plain to see.  After stopping to watch the lights for some time we made our way back to Gus’s.  I spent the next hour or so by myself enjoying the lights and life.  What a way to end the day.  Sunday brought with it Gus’s breakfast burritos, Ultimate, swimming at Trout Lake, and venturing through Greta and Jeff’s garden (two green thumbs are better than one).  The trip home was made far more enjoyable having Gwen’s company for the first half and Andrea’s company for the second and never have I been so thankful to be offer a car ride into town (thanks Andrea!!).

      My first impression of Montrealers (if that is what people from Montreal call themselves) is not turning out to be favourable.  Searching for a place to live right now and am having a heck of a hard time finding anything.  Most people are simply not responding to my emails and those that have either refuse to rent unless I can come see them in person (obviously impossible when I am in Victoria) or don’t speak English - though since I don’t speak French I can’t really complain that much.    To help out with the fact I can’t come meet people in person I have put together a little slideshow of myself at  urlLink Ofoto . After emailing some 14 people I have had two favourable responses.  One fellow who thinks I “sound cool” so wants me to give him a shout when I arrive in town, but doesn’t have a place for me to live and another guy that has a place a bit further from McGill than I would like though I am talking to him about taking the place since my options are a little limited (i.e. it may be this place or the cardboard box I am bring with me).  Still a little bit of searching time left so I am not panicking yet, but I am starting to feel I will have to take a place a little further away from McGill.  Guess there are 4 universities (McGill, Concordia, University of Montreal, and something else??) all located in the downtown area so the roommate market is a touch competitive.

      Thanks to Kevin Davis (unofficial organizer who ran the entire event from what I can tell) and company a great time was had in Vancouver this weekend playing Ultimate in a 24-hour charity event for Alzheimer's.  Have to admit I only made it through 12-hours, but it was a fantastic 12-hours.  A small frickets tournament was setup to accompany the Ultimate.  First time I have played this wonderful little game and am already hooked.  Only had a chance to play it once, but am dying to give it another go.  Other 'big news' at the tournament was this new fangled  urlLink Penta Water .  Apparently this stuff is treated with high energy sound waves to break down the length of the H2O molecules so your body can absorb it faster.  You can imagine we took full advantage to play up / mock this new marvel of science.  Good times!

      Here is a succinct recap of my family reunion in Invermere (July 30 – August 3).  Wonderful to see the family again.  Everyone managed to make it except for cousin Steve who needed to work – poor fellow.  Absolutely adore my cousins Brent and Kirsty from Australia.  There will be no 14-year gap between seeing each other again this time.  Meet Darren (BJ’s fiancé) and had a chance to get to know him at least a little when we went white water rafting.            A crazy busy 5 days the reunion was.  Certainly the best part was going skinning dipping in Windermere Lake with Brent, Kirsty, Mel (Brent’s gf), and my sister.  It turned priceless when a couple of gents came by in a vain attempt to see the girls naked (whom actually were still wearing their undergarments) and were instead greeted by my walking out of the water butt naked.  I gave them fair warning, I honestly did!  Later I learned my father had on occasion gone skinning dipping in the same lake – I love that.  Skinning dipping aside, the ‘story’ of the reunion were the cousins (Brent, Kirsty, my sister, and myself) branding ourselves with a tattoo – the Chinese symbols for family.  Guess we are too old to shock the family anymore, as everyone seems to love it – even my grandmother!  My dear father certainly appear rather stunned – good to keep the old man on his toes. Slowly leaking out the word to my friends whom are surprised to say the least.  Sarah definitely seemed a little shell-shocked!    Apart from that, there was white water rafting (fantastic!), a little Karaoke (Aussie cousins singing Land Down Under, all of us singing Summer Nights), some dancing (doing the Happy Dance), a few drinks, and taking it easy at the beach.  Thanks for the late night Playmate poker Kirsty.  You really sold me on Australia with your description of the Fairy Penguins!  Missing you a ton.

       Setting:  7PM, Wed, August 5 at the Lansdowne Fields with a slight chill in the air   Event:  Victoria Ultimate Player Society (VUPS) Finals   Nugget Team Roaster:  David Pettenuzzo - capt. Chris Carmack Eric Hayashi Chris Lowe Donovan Parks Mark Pontin (MIA, but forgiven due to being a new father) Patrick Vincenti Jimmy 'X' Rueben Angie Bowers Lisa Bury (DNP due to cracked ribs) Tassy Davidson Pamela Liversidge  The final proved to be a hard fought game with players struggling to be competitive while still playing within the spirit of the game.  A few questionable calls by both teams in the first few points set the tone though both teams managed to settle themselves down by the later stages of the game.  We trailed the entire game and things were looking bleak with a score of 12-8 and momentum clearly not on our side.  With the daylight fading there was a real fear the game would be called due to lack of light.  Wendi came to our aid and determined that the final needed to be resolved by a complete game to 17.    This seemingly small event dramatically shifted the momentum of the game.  With the score at 16-15 we were only 2 points away from pulling off a spectacular comeback victory.  A turn over deep in our end led to a poetic set of throws allowing me to place an easy toss in the end zone for Angie.  It was a 0-0 game to one!  What better way to end it than a brilliant hammer toss from Chris C to our MVP Jimmy X.  Nuggets win 17-16!    Amazing season – heaps of fun, great competition, and learned a ton about the game (thanks Dave P.)!   MVPs:  Jimmy ‘X’ Rueben and Tassy Davidson
