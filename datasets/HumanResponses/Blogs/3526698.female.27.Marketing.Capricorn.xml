      You know how musicians are always talking about how they want to change the world through the music? Well, I think Switchfoot is managing to do this--one person at a time. I was at work today, doing something that I really didn't want to do. Something that the person who asked me to do it could have done it with any basic, primitive, solar or battery operated calculator sitting on their desk.  I have to do a lot of this stuff and I always take it as part of what I have to do. Well, today I was a little grumpy and the noise of people around me on phone and being polite and friendly to each other was annoying me so I turned some music on and put on my headphones. Well, what I heard was Jon Foreman's amazingly intesely brilliant voice singing--  this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it would be when the world was younger and you had everything to lose  Well, Jon, I didn't quite think of sitting with my laptop doing calculations in XL that really don't quite have much meaning to me when the world was younger! Don't get me wrong.I do love my job and what we do is great. But sometimes when things like this happen, I wonder if I want to be completely defined by it. It consumes me--it has since I started. I remember staying late one stormy night when the entire building was empty and the snow was coming down and the client says,"I am sorry but you have to get this done tomorrow." I stayed late. You have to understand,I am an Indian girl and for me to be walking on deserted streets in 10 degree weather and 6 inches of snow is really not what I dreamed of when the world was younger!  What did I dream of? Hmm, I guess that I dreamed of being happy. I dreamed of having enough money to be able to buy books and help the poor people. I dreamed of being able to sing in front of a crowd.I dreamed of being a painter. I dreamed of having 3 kids and a pool. There was a time when all I wanted to do was to work for a non-profit organization. Maybe all this craziness in my life is to make me see what I really want to be. A time when I can really find out what I want.

       I needed to look this one up...  blog  A frequent, chronological publication of personal thoughts and Web links.  Information A blog is often a mixture of what is happening in a person's life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.  People maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with the introduction of automated published systems.  Blogs are alternatively called web logs or weblogs. However, "blog" seems less likely to cause confusion, as "web log" can also mean a server's log files.

      In 2 weeks time, my life as I know it will change. I quit my job, go to TX and then fly out to India. I don't know what to expect, I don't know what will happen.  I have been disappointed so much this year. The plans that I had have not always gone the way that I wanted. I have peace that the Lord is in control--but hope is a different thing.Maybe I do not dare to hope. Hope is a strange thing. In saying that I have hope, I am opening myself to be vulnerable, to trust God and say that I hope in Him. I am setting myself up--for hope to be fulfilled or a big disappointment.    For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD , "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.   It's time for me to break down these walls and begin to hope.   Lord, I believe! Help thou my unbelief!

      When I first moved to Boston I held on to a verse.  Psalm 16:5-6 "LORD,you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;surely I have a delightful inheritance." That's what I am holding on to right now. In a couple weeks from now, my life as I know it will change. I have to make an unplanned trip to India to get a new visa. How do I feel? Well, I believe that this is a way for God to bring some changes in my life that I have been looking for.There is a little bit of disappointment that I will miss the best time of the year in Boston, but then there is excitement to see what God is going to do. This is been a hard year for me --there have been many surprises--some not so nice ones. But I will continue to hold on to the promise of "pleasant places."

      I live in Boston. If you have ever been there, you'll either love it or hate it. I love it. I love the history, the culture and the personality of the city.  Kinda like me....Young, busy but not too busy, intellectual, exciting, traditional yet revolutionary.  One of my favorite things to do is go to Harvard Square in the summer. It's great with all the musicians and performers, Urban Outfitters ( I love that store, though I always think I stick out in my preppy clothes there :) Hey , preppy people can like cool things too, you know) and just the energy that you feel there. Then dinner at John Harvard's. Check out the chicken pot pie. It's great-can't really describe it. Guess you have to see for yourself. The thing I hate the most is the cold. It can get really cold. And I mean like when it's the same tem in celsius and farenheit, that's not good. And when your eyelashes freeze from standing outside for 5 mins, you can't be happy. But you get through the winter by waiting for the summer and fall.

      I am really frustrated right now. My wallet got stolen on Friday in the Christian Book Store that my best friend works at. It's ironic isn't it? I feel so angry and violated. I have to deal with so much stuff before I actually leave the country now. It just doesn't seem fair. I have really had a hard time.  It's been good to be in Austin with Christa but it also gets boring especially when she goes to work. It's always hard to ask her to do stuff too--since she hates driving and when she has her mind set on something, there's nothing else that she wants to do.  I hope that I can still leave on the 27th...I would hate to be stuck for longer if my ticket needs to be changed.
