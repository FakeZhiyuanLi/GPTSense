      ...Just thank god not me. My sister (a common thorn in my side) has managed to royally screw up my entire day. How? I hear you cry. Well the past two months have been a state of pure bliss for me. Schools ended, yet my sister still has to go to school and my mum works. The result; I end up being at home, alone. And I can watch as many day time chat shows, as I want. Or as much time on the computer without annoying little voices pestering me for help.  like I say, bliss. And after having to drag myself out of bed at 1:00 in the afternoon to go watch her embarrassingly crap sports day I figured I could spend today recuperating. But no.   thanks to yesterday she manages to catch some generic cold, or flu or whatever. So she stays at home. With me. Am I happy? Hell no. Not after listening to her winging and whining at me for the entire day. And thanks to her overhearing a certain talk with my mom, managed to blackmail me into waiting on her hand and foot....Bitch!  I might not hope its contagious...But I sure as hell hope its fatal...

      Remember the good ol' days? The times when you thought nothing of publicly humiliating yourself for the entertainment of others? And while at the same time performing pointless tasks that have no bearing in reality let alone life?  yup, school sports day. My sisters in fact, who is turning 12 this year. I was watching the budding young couch potatoes committing some daring act against good taste...like the three legged race with three people, or the difficult task of throwing a ball at each other, and it struck me that I am SO glad that I never have to do anything like that ever again. what were we thinking???? What were the teachers thinking???? We hate it, they hate it, even the parents are bored rigid.  apart from the rare one or two parents that are just a tad too 'helpful'. Like when they shout tactics until their voice is raw at their 7 year old children.....I can think of few useful places for this kind of people, the only one that comes to mind is, I think is probably enough to be sent to hell for thinking it...  can anyone actually think of any good points of sports day? Primary school sports day, before you get to touch any of the 'fun' equipment like discus and shot-put, yah know....The fun stuff. Oh yeah....There was always being able to throw balls at the faces of people you don't like, and being able to blame it on "trying to win". That and laughing at the fat kid in the lycra shorts....  Who do we blame for this travesty? The children? They don't know any better. The teacher for forcing them? Or the parents who encourage this sort of thing? nah....Much better to blame it on the government. One excuse fits all.

      ....So this is what a blog looks like.... well anyway, I don't actually have any clue as to why I've suddenly decided to start a blog but something in me decided it was needed. A kind of rite of passage for the socially inept I guess. Anyways i'm  hoping that this might evolve into something intriguing and interesting, although I accept that all in all i'm just adding to the vain and self-serving crud that has blocked up the internet....kinda like the cholesterol in its arteries....  I only hope it has a heart attack....
