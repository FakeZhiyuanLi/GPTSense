      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I have already created my own blog successfully. I thought it will take a complicated step to create it but actually just a 3 easy steps, create your own account, name your blog and finally choose a template. Before this, I do not know there is a such website for us to write down our own thoughts and let others to comment. When we were asked to create our own electronic journal, the first things comes to my mind is “what’s that?” , after listening to the explanations, only I understand what all this about, at least not so blur about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Wednesday 23/6/04, I had watched the fashion opera “ops Ophelia” which Dr. Edwin recommended us to watch it. This is my first time to watch fashion opera, actually I was not really understand what this opera about, but one thing I ensure that the actors’ act are all very wonderful! The part that I remember the most is the part when the two actors came out and talked over the phone. “Chicken wing, fried chicken…..hah? You are vegetarian??” It so funny!! Just the space in Stor Theater is a bit small, before that, I thought it must be a big stage which it looks like stage in “dewan besar” but it is not. Anyway, small space made us can look to the actors and actress more closely. Luckily we only have to pay RM20 for this show, because it is quite expensive for us to pay more.

      31st July 2004…. Today we went to watch thirty days in September at the actor’s studio, Bangsar. Before that, I am looking forward to watch this play actually because I always believe that the feeling of watch the play is different from just reading the script.  I thought it will be only our TESL semester 5 students went to watch this play, to my surprise that, our junior also join us to watch it. Furthermore, everyone looks different today because they wear very smart today.  It can not be deny that it is an advantage to read the script before going to watch the play. Because we can know what is the play about and when we watch it, perhaps the questions we have during reading the script will be answered. But there is disadvantage too if we read the script before the play, since we know what is the play about, we will not feel any surprise when we watch it.  For me, the actors’ act in this play is quite good; it can see that many efforts they had contributed in this play. Just perhaps I had read the script, I had known what will happen next, and it seems do not have any surprise there. One thing that I remember one part of the play, I heard the sound of raining and lighting, I thought it raining outside, in fact, it is the sound effect for this play.  Anyway, it is really a good experience for me to watch this play.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had read the summary of King Lear; I found that I had read the story before that similar to it when I was in primary school. It is also about a king who has three daughters and the king asked his daughters how much they love him. It was in the primary school magazine, off course it was in mandarin version. May be that time when I read it, it was in a simple version, now, I can read a complete version of it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems that I faced when I read King Lear are it is quite difficult to find out what the characters’ speech means. And I am still confusing about the characters’ name; perhaps I need some time to remember the characters’ name.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guideline that I got this week, I think it is quite helpful and useful for us, because it guides us how to read a play. Sometimes, I wonder how many times a play should be read in order to understand it thoroughly. I think we should read it many times. May be different time we read, we will get different things.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week we start to study Oedipus the king. Before go to class, I have read a little bit of the text, I feel it hard to understand and do not know what actually happen in this play. But after I read the notes which I got it from internet, it makes me understand better. Anyway, lecturer’s explanation is also important too. After listening to the explanation and read the play again, finally I have a clear picture about the play. I realize that no matter we read short stories, novels or drama. I need some help, such as notes from internet.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I read Oedipus the king, I can’t believe that there is such condition happened; the son killed his father and gets married with his mother. May be that’s what we call the oracle that we can’t avoid. I can’t imagine how Oedipus reacts when he knew the truth, his wife is also his mother….really unbelievable.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time I see this title, I think that it will be a boring play, but it so surprise to me, it is an interesting play.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am looking forward to read the tragedy of King Lear……

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every country has their own traditional dance, this only I know when I type in traditional dance and it gives many results of traditional dance in different countries. As a Malaysian, I think we are fortunately because we can get to know different traditional dances from different races in our country. I had browsed through a website- www.dancemalaysia.com, in this website; it let me know more about traditional dance in Malaysia.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I browsed through this website, I realized that different dance brings different meaning. For example: Chinese dance meant to bring success and prosperity and others meant to celebrate certain occasion. Besides that, Indian dance is a form of workshop and an expression of the human emotion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Court dance is one of the Malay traditional dances; it began as entertainment for the royal household and used to be performed by the maidens and ladies in waiting for the court. But now these dances are performed for the public venues. We should proud that we still have chance to watch this kind of traditional dance.  In my opinion, every kind of traditional dance should be continued in order not to be forgotten by the young generation. Because every traditional dance has their own unique culture and meaning.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can not forget the time when I take the course, teaching the language of short stories and teaching the language of novels in the previous semester. Because we have to read a lot of stories. Although the course called short stories but every story I read all are not too “short” and also the novels. I remember that how much time I have to spend to finish one story. So, when I got the drama book which we have to read this semester, I feel relief because at least the book is not as thick as novel we read before, has dialogue…..but there are some words that I do not understand, what is parados? ode?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I continue reading, what I can find the different between reading novels and reading a drama is, in drama, we can directly know what is the character’s thought through their speech. In novels, may be it is through others point of view.  Another thing that comes to my mind when I take this course is,do we need to perform a play during we take this course?? Luckily not, we will have to perform it when we take another course next semester.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I didn’t attend class last week, I had missed the class which Dr. explained about the history of theater. And another thing that I had missed is the talk which was given by Mr.Rohaizad.
