      Spirituality is SO important in life.  You have to believe in  something  - even if it is just yourself.  Personally, I'm Wiccan.  I was raised in a very wonderful and loving Methodist home and was given no reason to ever turn my back on it.  However, from the time I was very young I always felt there was something missing or wrong about it.  In middle school I found out my friend Sital was not a Christian.  I grew up in a small town where EVERYONE was a Christian.  I never really knew you were allowed to be anything else.  So, this news came as a pretty big shocker.  I started thinking...and considered the fact that my religion says that Sital will go to hell.  Sital was one of the greatest people I knew.  She was smart, sweet, funny, a great dancer, and really beautiful inside and out.  This is when I started to rebel against the dogma of Christianity.  My spiritual life began to diminish at this time and eventually faded into nothing.  In the last year I started to feel a big hole in me that I finally traced down to a complete lack of spiritual passion.    I went looking for something that felt right to me, something that meshed with what I felt was right in my own heart.  That's when I found Wicca.  It's made SUCH a huge difference in my life.  Every day I wake up and feel a change.  Every day is better.  I know it sounds cheesy - but if you can't be cheesy in your blog, where can you be cheesy??  I guess that's it for today.  Must stop procrastinating and actually get some WORK done!!  Eeeeek

      OUCH! Did anyone else notice that my last blog read like someone puked a lot of really horrible sentences onto a computer screen? The reason for that - yeah - I was hung-the-fark-over. It's really kind of sad. I had so many really important things that I wanted to say about my Friday night out rockin' the small live music scene in my cheesy suburb of Houston.  (a small aside to add that since no one is actually READING my blog, there is no one to notice the horrible puking incident of the last blog...so I feel a little bit better)  Now back to the important things.  In my very humble, and often misguided, opinion in order to really love music you have to love it all.  You have to love the art of molding random notes and beats into a song.  It doesn't matter if its classical, rap, metal, or jazz - you must appreciate the talent that it took to produce a good piece of music.  THIS, my friends, is why live music is so important.  To go and see the music being made, to feel the vibrations flowing from the speakers into your chest - that is what makes music real.  I love the blues - I love to sway to the bass line and look into a good blues singer's eyes as he's wailing.  Like Friday, in the same night, I love a mosh pit.  I love standing at the front of a crowd feeling the anger screaming from a guitar - so much anger that the crowd breaks out into a shoving match.  And after you're knocked to the ground by a scary looking guy twice your size, he stops moshing, turns around, and helps you up.  Because, after all, it's not about hurting the individual - it's about feeling the music.  Yes, I've been a raver.  Two of my favorite quotes came from my days as a raver.  Now seems like a good time to dust them off.  1. MUSIC is the drug  2.  Fuck the rave act, let's dance.

      Here's a little information about me. I love music. All kinds of music. And even more than music, I love LIVE music. So, after 2 nights of little-to-no sleep I seriously considered going home last night and going to bed for around 15 hours. But instead I decided to go out - again. Started out the night with a few older friends at a local bar. Decided live music would be more fun so we went to a cheesy martini bar where there was a band playing. The band was great - kinda reminded me of Double Trouble with a great sax player. The lead singer was trying damn hard (but unsuccessfully) to channel Mick Jagger - but he was tolerable. They played some fun bluesy stuff. Atmosphere wasn't too bad, but the bar was mostly filled with old folks - tolerable but not my crowd. So when all the old people I was hangin' with ducked out around 11pm I decided to head out someplace else. So I took off to another live music bar where they were playing some awesome frickin' metal. So I got in the mosh pit and farked around there for a couple of hours.  So today I am 1) hungover 2) deaf 3) bruised and sore.  But all in all - I'd say it was a successful night.

      Well, I did it again last night.  Went out to another bar to see my band play.  I SWORE I would not stay for the 3rd set.  But their 2nd setlist is my least favorite and so I decided I better stay until I could leave the evening on a good note.  Which meant, once again, staying until the frickin' bar closed at 2.  At least I slept better last night.  The night before was a very restless 3 hours, which I figure I probably got maybe 2 hours of on-and-off sleep.  Last night, I got 3 good hours of real-deal, good sleepin' - so I'm not nearly as dead today.  I think I owe it to the weather.  It was about 60 degrees so when I got home I threw open the two big windows in my bedroom, grabbed an extra heavy blanket from downstairs for the bed and went to sleep to the sounds of distant dogs barking, the breeze through the trees, and the occasional car passing by the house.  There's nothing I love more than to go to sleep in a room just chilly enough to be able to appreciate a nice warm blanket....

      This is honestly one of the strangest days I've ever had since moving to Houston. It is the middle of August in one of the hottest and muggiest cities in the United States and the weather is BEAUTIFUL. Temp in the 80's, low humidity, and a very nice breeze blowing through. I feel a little bad enjoying such a wonderful weather day like today - seeing as how it's all being brought on by those two awful hurricanes coming in to hit Florida today. So, I apologize, Floridians for your bad luck - but this weather is GREAT! I love blogs - I read them just about every day. So when stopping to think at work this morning on how I can remember such a wonderful day - I thought, "Today is the day I will start my blog". Better to start it on a lovely day when I can talk about lovely things than the rest of the days that pass around here - which are generally bad. I'll apologize for those posts ahead of time. The thing that I appreciate  most  about today's weather- it's going to make for a great lunchtime nap. See - I stayed up entirely too late last night watching my favorite local cover band (a really good band in general, but bars like cover bands here - so they went with what pays the bills) and so I'm dragging today. A lunchtime nap is all that is going to save me. Lucky for me, this weather is conducive to driving down the road to a little rest stop, rolling down the windows, opening the sunroff, setting the alarm on my cell phone, and passing out for about 45 minutes. The really dumb thing about me - I'll be going out to see the same band AGAIN tonight at a different bar. I just can't get enough. My goal is NOT to shut the bar down tonight - if I can leave before their last set is up I should be asleep by 1am which is perfectly acceptable - unlike the 2 hours of sleep I got last night. I guess that's all for my first blog attempt. I should work on getting better at this, and trying to work with the settings on this. Hope I don't screw it up too bad! Until next time. :-D
