      Finally, we can go on with our lives.  Today marks a historic event in Filipino politics: Incumbent President GMA will be inagurated as the 14th President of the Republic.  Whew, that was a close one.  Her speech was alright.  No movie script type lines here, just the basics and some, it was (just?) 20 minutes long and tackled 10 major concerns of the country today, with some supporting points, of course.    Part of it was her congratulating the other presidential aspirants for "fighting with conviction" at the 2004 Elections, then asking them to cooperate with her for the good of the nation (Eddie Gil included? Nah.). Fair enough, what else are they going to do.  She finished it by challenging the Business sector, the Congress, the Youth and then herself to do good.  While the stateliness of today's events may leave us in awe, but reality bites. As Mr Amando Doronila said " urlLink the inauguration is the beginning of pain ".    Uh-oh. No time to smell the (P 200,000.00 worth of) flowers, Madame. Now that your administration is legit, thanks to the right to suffrage, the people are now expecting results. On our part, us Pinoys will have to get back to work and get on with our lives.  Can someone please tell FPJ and his supporters to do the same as well?

        MY OWN BLOG!      Ehem...After months, and I do say months, of deciding whether or not to continue this project, I finally made up my mind.  Embarrassing as it is to admit, it wasn't easy,  especially for someone who's not much of a writer. I am not here to win awards (heheh), I am here just to express myself, which am not very good at also.   Here is the mother of all the issues:  Will I be able to religiously update the HENYO BLOG?   Well, there's one way to find out. It's not going to be pretty, but I guess it will be worthwhile.

       That was close.   Before the week ends, I remembered to post something as part of my commitment to enhance this blog.   Yesterday's  urlLink headline  was amusing. Nope, Madame, you don't have to do that, not even for me (obviously, this is an  exclusive  joke). :)   However, today's Inquirer  urlLink headline  was alarming.   Though it wouldn't be until October, I can't understand why the President acknowledged the resignation of Ms Soliman.&nbsp;&nbsp; I picture every social worker to be like Ms Soliman: down to earth, compassionate, energetic and witty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its unfair to think that what a social worker does is simply described as  helping the poor .&nbsp;&nbsp; Helping the poor means having to deal with a  LOT  of issues, from basic services to human development.&nbsp;

        Are you talking to me?&nbsp; Are you talking to me?      Though I haven't seen the   Taxi Driver,   as far as I heard it is one of Robert De Niro's best performances.&nbsp; But I think he's at his best when he portrays a&nbsp;Mafia Don (Vito Corleone)/Mob Boss (Al Capone).  &nbsp;

          Hiiissss!     Cat fights. Nope, no furry felines here. It is that vehement exchange of verbal (or physical) abuse between two (or more) feisty females who despise each other. It can happen anywhere: at home, at school, on the street and most commonly, in the work place. The intensity of the confrontation, I think, is correlated to 1) the age of the ladies (the younger they are, the more brutal it is…and irrational) and 2) the depth of the issue/problem or what’s at stake. Reiterating that it can get physical, I think throwing insults is bad enough.  While the ladies involved may think that its an effective way to assert their so-called civil liberties (e.g. condemning the other of spreading nasty rumors about the accuser), all that commotion would only lead to more problems. How about the people who gets to witness a cat fight? The spectators may 1) feel that it is a total waste of time and only a gimmick to get attention; 2) consider it as an alternate source of entertainment or 3) just don’t give a damn. I guess, am between options 1 and 2.  I for one don’t like confrontations. Quoting   Butch Dalisay   (April 1996), I am about as    warlike as a mushroom   . In my opinion, people are totally unreasonable during these fights therefore any form of resolution is close to impossible. While you may feel the urge to hit the other person, it is still best to harness one’s diplomatic skills. You can still defend yourself while maintaining your composure. To avoid these unnecessary fights, I try to understand people as much as I can, try to be objective and not to get involved in other people’s    special concerns   . Also, it is not healthy to    force    yourself on another department and do someone else's    tasks  .    It is also best not to get your superiors involved in these personal standoffs.

         What will the future hold?     The workshop was the sign of new things to come.  While it seems slow, we are moving forward, step by step.  So many plans lined up.  However, the path is vaguely visible, hence there are doubts.  Still, we are praying for the best.  We have people here who have potential and who have experience.  We will be a force to be reckoned with.

          Priceless      Yesterday, I took a leave from work just to do some, you know, stuffs. I am always the earliest to arrive in the office, hence, I hold the KEY. Tuesday, I had to give the KEY to an officemate or else they'll be working outside. Now, am back (unfortunately) and it feels weird since I felt I missed a lot of things. Really.  I was at the mall yesterday with my dad to pay their mobile phone bills and to have it terminated. Yes, they've decided to avail of the mobile company's pre-paid services since its much cheaper. While waiting for our number, my mom texted me and told me that my credit card arrived. Aaaahhhh yes, plastic money.  It’s a Master Card (yep, its priceless) and I think its best not to tell my limit. For me, getting a credit card is a very much "adult" thing to do. It’s both exciting and risky. I now have the privilege of buying my own things anytime and anywhere. I don't need to bring loads of money to buy some state of the art gadget. Since its mine, I could spend without my parent's permission. I am ready to unravel the shopper in me (which I rarely see).  But, there is a catch: THE BILL. Yes, yes, yes. We've heard those nasty stories of women (and even men) having huge DEBTS just because they used their cards without hesitation and were not responsible enough to budget their payments. How about that familiar movie scene where the snotty waiter cuts a customer's max out card?   Getting a credit card also means learning how to budget your money, which helps you to become a more responsible person. The temptation to splurge blindly is high, but the consequences are real. I promised myself to use this card for good (and justice, when applicable) and not let my mom or my dad to pay my dues when it comes.   With great power comes great responsibility says Spider-Man's Uncle Ben, and in this case, its purchasing power.

         I am truly passionate.        urlLink        *Thanks to jac for this quiz.      Virtues:  You appreciate humor like none other. Puns might even spark laughter in you (TEHY R FUNNI). You seek adventure and connection with your surroundings. You seek friends who will not only share laughs with you but actually form a deep bond of trust and empathy beneath the surface. You look for adventure and courage in people, and variation is necessary to keep you under control. You see yourself as multi-faceted, so you need people who can see you in your many lights. You're constantly trying to figure yourself out while analyzing the people around you. Silly, silly people.

          Game Na!     Until we switched cables, I used to watch this show on Tech TV titled  urlLink X-Play .  The show gives you reviews on video games for the most up-to-date consoles.  The process involves describing what’s cool and/or sucks about the game then giving it a rating.  It’s in this show I was introduced to the Play Station 2 and X-Box version of  urlLink the Sims .  I’m not a super gamer, but my experience with computer games go back to the Nintendo Family Computer, the Super Mario Brothers and the Game Boy.  And then, when my younger brother was old enough to hold a joystick (and stare at the TV for hours), he became the game aficionado of the family.  He dominated every game for the SEGA Mega Drive, the Play Station 1 and the Play Station 2 (if a 3rd comes out, am sure he’ll butter me up to buy him one).  I would play occasionally; no big, even watch him play those neat Final Fantasy games.  Until, I bought my own copy of the Sims.  If you’re not familiar with the Sims, it’s initially a PC game that lets you create characters (or “Sim”) by choosing different appearances, skills and personalities.  After that, you build them a new home or buy one, get them a career and meet other Sims for friends or romance.  In short, you create these Sims and run their lives.  It was only recently that MAXIS/EA decided to develop this game for the console, and I think it’s a great idea.  After our PC suffered from 2 crashes, we decided not install games to our computer.  I bought the Sims when I was “on vacation”, hence, I would spend 3 to 4 hours of game time everyday.  This was bad news for my brother, since he has to share the console with me and which also cuts his game time.  Now, since am at the office, I am unable to play the game which really bugs me.  However…..I rekindled my fascination with another type of gaming experience.
