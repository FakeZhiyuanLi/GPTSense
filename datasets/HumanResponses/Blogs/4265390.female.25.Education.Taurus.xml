       The coverage:   Verbs  1. Kinds of verbs: a. Transitive and Intransitive b. Auxiliary 2. Voice a. Active b. Passive ( refer to handouts )   ----------    Transitive and Intransitive   Verbs carry the idea of being or action in the sentence.  I am an artist. The artists submitted all their portfolios.  As we will see on this page, verbs are classified in many ways. First, some verbs require an object to complete their meaning: "She wrote _____ ?" Wrote what? She wrote a novel. These verbs are called transitive. Verbs that are intransitive do not require objects: "The library caught fire." In English, you cannot tell the difference between a transitive and intransitive verb by its form; you have to see how the verb is functioning within the sentence. In fact, a verb can be both transitive and intransitive: "The monster collapsed the building by sitting on it."  Although you will seldom hear the term, a ditransitive verb (such as cause or give) is one that can take a direct object and an indirect object at the same time: "That horrid music gave me a headache."    Source: Namara, J.M.C.  Guide to Grammar and Writing . Hartford, Connecticut: Capital Community College Foundation, 1999      Auxiliary or helping verbs are verbs that are used to help form verb phrases but cannot do so independently. There are four basic auxiliary verb groups:  to be to have modal auxiliaries: to do    To Be   This auxiliary verb is used in the progressive tenses and passive voice:    Progressive Tense:   You are painting. You were painting. You have been painting.    Passive Voice:   You are painted. You were painted. You have been painted.      To Have   This verb is used as an auxiliary in the perfect tense:  I have finished my paper. I had finished my paper. I have been finished with my paper.    Modal Auxiliaries   These auxiliaries affect the mood of the verb; that is, they determine whether a verb is a fact, desire, possibility, or command. They are most commonly used to represent degrees of freedom or severity.     Most common modal auxiliaries:   will, shall, can, may, need (to), dare, would, should, could, might, must, ought (to)  Ability: I can read. Necessity: I must read. Obligation: I ought to read. Permission: I may read.    To Do   This verb is used when the main verb of the sentence requires aid of an auxiliary, but there is no other helping verb that will fit. It is often used in questions, negative or emphatic statements:  Does he write? He writes, doesn't he? Despite his shaky hands, he does write.    Source: Lamos, Steve.  Writer's Workshop . Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois, 2003 .     Voice   A voice is a form of verb that shows whether or not the subject is performing the action.  There are two voices: active and passive.  A verb is active when its subject performs the action.  For example: S -------------------------V Ernest Hemingway wrote a novel entitled, “A Moveable Feast”. S ----------V Hughes read poetry.  In each of the given examples, the subject performs the action. Ernest did the writing; Hughes did the reading. Note that an active verb may or may not have a direct object.  A verb is passive when its subject does not perform the action.  For example: S ---------------------------------------V The novel, “A Moveable Feast”, was written by Ernest Hemingway. S ----------V Hughes was left with his children.   In the examples, the subject is the receiver rather than the performer of the action. In the first sentence, ther performer is named: Ernest Hemingway. Ernest Hemingway,however, is the object of the preposition by and is no longer the subject.  In the second sentence, the performer of the act is not named. It does not tell you who left Hughes with his children. Note that neither one of these sentences has a direct object. While an active verb may or may not have a direct object, a passive verb almost never does.   FORMING TENSES OF PASSIVE VERBS  A passive verb has two parts. It is always a verb phrase made from a form of be plus a past participle.     Using Active and Passive Voices   Use the active voice whenever possible. Sentences that are active are less wordy and more forceful. Only use the passive voice to emphasize the receiver of the action rather than the performer. The passive voice is good when the performer is either unknown or unimportant.  ( Source: Forlini, Gary.  Annotated Teacher’s Edition: Grammar and Composition . Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1990 .)    ADJECTIVES   There are two types of adjectives: descriptive and limiting.   Descriptive adjectives  are additional things that tell what kind, what color, or what size a person, place, or thing is.  The following are suffixes that signal descriptive adjectives: -able, -an, -ant, -ate, -en, -ic, -ish, -less, -ly, -some, -ful, -al, -ar, -ed, -ent, -ing, -ive, -like, -ous, -ary, -y   A limiting adjective  tells us which one or how many. It is normally the basic part of the sentence pattern that is used unconsciously by the speaker or writer.  Adjectives have  3 degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative . In using adjectives in comparison, do not add more or most ones that end with –er or –est.  Wrong: Hermione is more humbler than Harry. Right: Hermione is humbler than Harry. Hermione is more humble than Harry.    Nota bene:  Some adjectives remain the same because of their meanings (e.g., outstanding, tasteless, principal, underwater). Noun adjuncts such as nuclear, capsule, and nitrogen do not change in form either.    Adjectives in a series  when used in sentences or paragraphs should come in correct order to achieve sentence coherence. They should come in the following order:  Noun Determiner-articles, possessives, demonstratives, prenomials articles—a, an, the possessives—our, my, your, her, his, its, their demonstratives—this, that, these, those pronomials— -indefinite pronominal adjectives: any, all, another, both, few, many, several, some, such -distributive pronominal adjectives: each, every, either, neither -interrogative pronominal adjectives: which, what, whose  Numeral Adjectives: ordinals or cardinals -ordinal adjectives such as five, two, etc. -cardinal adjectives such as first, second, etc.  Quality or characteristic-intelligent, durable, etc.  Size or shape-square, large, etc.  Color—red, brown, etc.  Noun adjunct or noun modifier—narra tree, physics teacher, etc.  ( Source: Robles, Elisa and Cecilia Corsino.  Teacher’s Guide: English This Way 6 . Quezon Avenue, Quezon City: Phoenix Publishing House, Inc., 1999 .)  ----------    Adjectives  1. Adjectives in Comparison 2. Series of Adjectives ( refer to pages 63-76 of   your English Skillbooks )   Adverbs  1. Kinds: -Adverbs of time, place, degree, manner, affirmation and negation ( see page 78 of the English Skillbook ) 2. Positions of Adverbs in a Sentence ( see page 80 of your English Skillbooks )   Practice by doing the exercises in your Skillbooks as I will be basing the UT on it.     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Adverbs   modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.. Most of them end with   –ly   suffixes.   For instance : He wrote on the paper carelessly.  They can be easily distinguished from adjectives because adjectives only answer the questions: “which one” or “what kind”, while adverbs answer the questions: “how” or “in what manner”, “where”, “when”, “to what degree”, “how much”, how little”, “how often”, as well as yes-or-no questions that may be either positive or negative.  Adjectives can be transformed into adverbs through the use of the suffix –ly added at the end of the adjective form.   Adjectives------  Adverbs  sure----------------surely terrible------------terribly exceptional-------exceptionally quiet---------------quietly beautiful-----------beautifully   Some modifiers have the same adjective and adverb forms. They only differ in the type of words they modify.  little, farther (distance), early, further (in addition), high, late, fast

        Choosing Active Voice   In most nonscientific writing situations, active voice is preferable to passive for the majority of your sentences. Even in scientific writing, overuse of passive voice or use of passive voice in long and complicated sentences can cause readers to lose interest or to become confused. Sentences in active voice are generally--though not always-- clearer and more direct than those in passive voice. Sentences in active voice are also more concise than those in passive voice because fewer words are required to express action in active voice than in passive.    Changing passive to active   If you want to change a passive-voice sentence to active voice, find the agent in a "by the..." phrase, or consider carefully who or what is performing the action expressed in the verb. Make that agent the subject of the sentence, and change the verb accordingly. Sometimes you will need to infer the agent from the surrounding sentences that provide context.    Choosing Passive Voice   While active voice helps to create clear and direct sentences, sometimes writers find that using an indirect expression is rhetorically effective in a given situation, so they choose passive voice. Also, as mentioned above, writers in the sciences conventionally use passive voice more often than writers in other discourses.  Passive voice makes sense when the agent performing the action is obvious, unimportant, or unknown or when a writer wishes to postpone mentioning the agent until the last part of the sentence or to avoid mentioning the agent at all. The passive voice is effective in such circumstances because it highlights the action and what is acted upon rather than the agent performing the action.    Changing active to passive   If you want to change an active-voice sentence to passive voice, consider carefully who or what is performing the action expressed in the verb, and then make that agent the object of a "by the..." phrase. Make what is acted upon the subject of the sentence, and change the verb to a form of be + past participle. Including an explicit "by the..." phrase is optional.    Some suggestions:   1. Avoid starting a sentence in active voice and then shifting to passive. 2. Avoid  urlLink dangling modifiers  caused by the use of passive voice. A dangling modifier is a word or phrase that modifies a word not clearly stated in the sentence. 3. Don't trust the grammar-checking programs in word-processing software. Many grammar checkers flag all passive constructions, but you may want to keep some that are flagged. Trust your judgment, or ask another human being for their opinion about which sentence sounds best.  ---------------------------  This page is located at http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/print/esl/eslsubverb.html.

       YOU WERE BORN A  few weeks later. I cut the cord. Did my mother tell you that? I was the one that cut the cord. You were a quiet baby. I remember the two boys and Mia when they were babies, they were not as quiet. [E]specially Paolo; he used to cry all night. I used to think he must have had the biggest pair of lungs. But you were quiet, as if you knew Mama could not take any more.  I used to come and watch you so Mama could have a rest, or go to church--she went to pray often in those days. I used to hum to you as I carried you but you would not remember that. All those times that I was up in the room with you, Mama could have spoken to me but she did not.  Mama kept many things to herself, maybe because she did not want us to worry. All I remember is that Tia Thelma came often. Mama needed her in those days. But she should have told me. I was the eldest. She should have let me know. But she kept me in the dark about how bad things were. I did not know until I came home found the piano gone.  You know how some things are more than what they are. Like I look at this ring here to me it is more than just a ring. It is my marriage. And if I were to lose it I would think it a bad sign. I never take this ring off. Never. It was like that with the piano. I still remember the day that it was given to me.  I was five that day.

      When I was young enough to still spend a long time buttoning my shoes in the morning, I’d listen toward the hall: Daddy upstairs was shaving in the bathroom and Mother downstairs was frying the bacon. They would begin whistling back and forth to each other up and down the stairwell. My father would whistle his phrase, my mother would try to whistle, then hum hers back. It was their duet. I drew my buttonhook in and out and listened to it—I knew it was “The Merry Widow.” The difference was, their song almost floated with laughter: how different from the record, which growled from the beginning, as if the Victrola were only slowly being wound up. They kept it running between them, up and down the stairs where I was now just about ready to run clattering down and show them my shoes.  -Eudora Welty, “One Writer’s Beginnings”    Carrie looked behind her. The theater was full of fourth and fifth graders waiting for the Saturday matinee to start. Anyone older was conspicuously taller in the rows of small heads, like a weed overlooked when the grass is cut. Near the center[,] Carrie could see several such heads sitting together and recognized them as kids from her class. She supposed they could recognize her, too, down there in the third row with Duncan and his friends. She turned around and looked at the screen. As if that were a signal, the cartoon began.  The cartoon was dumb. The main feature was terrible. After the first thirty minutes[,] Carrie stopped paying attention and simply watched the figures moving on the screen. Duncan and his friends loved it. They commented on everything. The audience buzzed. They were watching Laser Man scale the side of a crater. Carrie shifted in the seat, stretched her legs sideways, and tried to be interested. Laser Man was boring through solid rock with his laser eye beam. The mountain was crumbling. Then huge[,] green space lizards appeared [sic.] crawling toward him. Beside her, Duncan drew his breath.  Carrie reached over and took a handful of popcorn. She figured the movie was three-wuarters over. One of the lizards had Laser Man pinned on the edge of a precipice. Why didn’t he just use his eye beam and crumble the thing? She glanced at Duncan. He was sitting far forward in his seat, chewing slowly.  Then something happened, but Carrie missed it. The lizard was catapulting into the chasm. The mountain was falling to dust around him. The audience cheered. Then Laser Man was kissing Cynthia. The movie was nearly over.   -From Zibby O’Neal’s “The Language of Goldfish”         Manila is a city of extremes. The poor are very poor and the rich[,] very rich. They live side by side. The rich live in sprawling houses in residential subdivisions with fancy names like Green Meadows, White Plains, Corinthian Plaza, Bel Air, San Lorenzo, Magallanes and the very exclusive Forbes Park, a leafy enclave that was home to the famous Manila Polo Club. The poor are not far from sight. They live in little pockets on the periphery of these affluent subdivisions. A constant reminder to the right that there is another side to life.  Near the harbor stands the historic Manila Hotel, a grand old hotel whose penthouse had been home to General Douglas MacArthur before the Second World War, and the likes of Aldo Gucci, and where today the wealthy continue to dine and dance and where businessmen come to hold breakfast meetings involving [million-dollar] deals. In the shadow of its modern tower, built in the mid-seventies, you will find Manila’s biggest slum—Tondo. Tondo and its surrounding areas are home to the city’s poor. The place is so congested that houses, if they can be called that, stand next to each other, most measuring no bigger than the size of a single bedroom. In this cramped area, families of five, six, even ten, sleep together.  In my convent school days, the nuns took us to Tondo on a field trip one day. It was intended as an eye-opener. To show us how the less fortunate lived so that we may learn how to feel some compassion for them and in the process[,] learn to be more appreciative of what we had. But compassion has done little to close the gap between our world and theirs. The structures that determine poverty and health have been in place for centuries.    -From Arlene Chai’s “The Last Time I Saw Mother”    The robber was apprehended by the police. He was a gaunt-faced man of five feet and two inches. His hair was a mass of unruly curls cut short by a lazy barber. His eyes were round and dark and questioning. The people in the precinct called him a no-good menace; but the people who knew him better called him Pablo.   -Sometimes Mary, “An Intro to Pablo”

       THERE WERE MANY  children in our neighborhood, although, for me, this comprised only the distance along the street between two Meralco electric light posts. Sometimes, we strayed farther, as when a kite string snapped; if the wind were strong we would even go across the railway track, which was unfenced in those days.  Entong was a rascal and we were all afraid of him. We called him Cutil Butil because he had a growth of some kind near his right ear the size of a grain of corn; he didn’t seem to mind the nickname, being used to it. When in one of our games he had been winning and was beginning to lose, he would get up and say: “I don’t like to play anymore. My mother might be calling me.” And then he would scurry off. I tried the same trick on him once, but he accompanied me to our house and cried real, big tears at the foot of the stairs, telling my mother that I had run away with his shells. Mother would not listen to me, and I had to return the shells I had won from him.  We could not tell Entong’s mother about him. She was a widow and a drunkard. Most of the day she plucked cankong, a kind of vegetable [that] she sold in the market, in the wet fields along the railroad track. Besides Entong, she had a number of other children[,] two of whom were married but still lived with her in the little one-room house. When she drunk callejon with her skirt stained with the mud of the wet fields and the green of the cankong leaves, shouting bad words at everybody. Sometimes, I saw her take a bath. Her hair was short and grey and her breasts were withered. When the children cried at night, their mothers would say: “Stop, now, stop. Here comes Apung Enchang!” And the little creatures would stop crying for fear.  Then there was Bo, whom we called Cusing because he was so small and frail. He made you think of a half-centavo. He could not fight, and often would go home crying. When the ground was muddy, he would frequently slip and tumble down. Entong was always cheating him.  Another boy lived just in front of our house across the callejon—in the house with the electric lights. We used only a kerosene lamp. Unlike the rest of us, he always wore regular pants, and sometimes he would come out and play, very clean and with powder all over his face. He looked like a girl to us, and, in fact, he often played with the girls, especially with the little mestiza girl with the bobbed hair who spoke Spanish. Oning was her name. We called him Bacla. He hated the nickname very much. His real name was Yoyong.  His father was a clerk—a chief clerk, I think. When he came home from the office in the afternoon he always had bundles of large[,] brown [envelopes] with him. He smoked big cigars. When he talked with Oning’s father[,] they spoke in Spanish. They would laugh loudly and shrug their shoulders, looking very wise. My father, as he sewed in his chair near our window, would peer at them through his glasses, and sometimes[,] he[,] too[,] would smile. He could also speak Spanish. He had been a soldier during the Spanish times. Now[,] was only a tailor. I often wondered why.  Every once in a while[,] there would be a party at Yoyong’s house. Pigs and chickens would be killed, and I would carry water for them. I was paid three centavos for every two cans. For drinking water, I received ten centavos, because the artesian well was quite a distance off. On one such occasion, when I was about to go, Yoyong gave me a slice of bread with butter on it. I was ashamed to take it because my mother had said… but it looked good to me, so I took it and ate it in our back yard. Entong saw me, and looking at me kindly, offered me some of his shells. He looked very ugly as he stood staring at my bread, and I pitied him. I finally gave him a piece, rather reluctantly, saying, “When you have something to eat, you do not give me any!”  For a few days after that, Entong did not try to cheat me, but later he began cheating again. One day[,] he was run over by a calesa and almost died as a result. He was taken to a hospital and when he was well again[,] it seemed that he was more quiet than before.  Anong, my younger brother, was a good marbles player. None of us liked to play with him, not even Entong who dared not cheat him because when Anong fought[,] he always used his teeth.  There were other little boys—one whom we called Galis because he was almost covered with some kind of itch and was always scratching himself. Sometimes he would bleed in several places and would begin to cry. He was thin and pale. His mother worked in a factory. His father—I really never knew who his father was, there were so many men in their house. Galis stayed home most of the time, sitting on the stairs, very silent. One time[,] I saw him smile.  Years later, I saw that same smile for the second time. He was pulling weeds in the greens around the Walled City, under a heavy guard. I recognized him and smiled, and he smiled back at me—the same smile I had seen years before as he sat, sick and thin, on the stairs in front of his house.  My brother who played marbles so well died when he was fourteen. He spat so much blood. We had all loved him very much, and we were all very sad. For three nights, Yoyong’s father lent us some of his electric lights connected by a long wire to his house. Our home was very bright and many people called on us, even Entong and his mother. After that[,] Yoyong was not allowed to play with me anymore, and his father no longer had his suits made by my father.  I was then in the fifth grade at school. Yoyong and I were classmates. Sometimes his mother, who wore slippers in the house, took him to school. They used to take me along with them, but after Anong died, no more. I could see Yoyong’s eyes inviting me to come along, but I pretended not to see. Yoyong was very bright in school and was always at the head of his class. Our teachers liked him. His father would often come to the classroom and talk with the teachers. He would have a big cigar in his mouth and talk English. My father did not know how to speak English.  I stopped going to school when I was in the seventh grade. “Look at Entong,” Father said, “he stopped when he was in the fourth grade, or was it the third? Besides, you can start in again next year.” The whole year I helped my father with his sewing. Mother also sewed, supplying her own needles and thread. “Don’t sew anymore,” Father would say to her, “You are getting too thin.” Mother would say, “Just these, just these!” But she kept on sewing.  The next year found me still out of school, and the next and the next. Then we sold our little house and moved. I had grown very tall, taller than Father, and would have been ashamed to go back to the grade school. Several years before, Yoyong’s family had sold their house and moved into a bigger one they had built somewhere.  Oning was studying in a Catholic college. Cusing, who has become a cochero, told me some years later that she had ridden in his carromata one time and had not recognized him. She was with a man, but Cusing did not understand what they were talking about as they spoke in Spanish. [sic.]  Entong is big and muscular. He is an oiler on the railroad, puts oil somewhere under the trains. I often see him, very black and dirty. I sometimes see his mother, too, waist-deep in the fields near the tracks, still gathering cankong for the market. I do not know if she still drinks. I ran into her one day and smiled at her, but she did not recognize me.  I sew suits in a tailoring shop downtown. Father stays at home and sews there. Mother is still thin. I have two little sisters studying in the primary school. They have many playmates in the neighborhood.  The other day[,] I was looking at the pictures in a newspaper at the tailoring shop. Among a group of young people in caps and gowns, I saw a familiar face. It was Yoyong. He was among those who graduated last March. He still looks very young. I looked at his face very closely. Yes, it was Yoyong. Does he remember “us” yet[?] Would he know us and speak to us if we met him on the crowded street? Does he know about the others—where they are?  As we were at supper that evening, I told Father and Mother about Yoyong. “He is an engineer now,” I said. “Do you want another slice of this mango?” Mother asked.  Father said his back was aching.

       For those of you who still don't have the handouts on verbs that I distributed last week, kindly refer to the notes below (as seen in the printed handout).   --------------    Verbs   are subdivided into two groups, regular verbs and irregular verbs, on the basis of how their past tense and past participles are formed.     Regular Verbs   Most verbs are action verbs. Regular verbs are those whose past tense and past participles are formed by adding a -d or an -ed to the end of the verb. To roll is a good example of a regular verb:  roll rolled rolled  Sometimes the last consonant must be doubled before adding the -ed ending.  For example: plan planned planned      Irregular Verbs   There is no formula to predict how an irregular verb will form its past-tense and past-participle forms. There are over 250 irregular verbs in English. Although they do not follow a formula, there are some fairly common irregular forms. Some of these forms are:  break broke broken cut cut cut run ran run meet met met come came come repay repaid repaid swim swam swum be was/were been     Distinguishing Regular and Irregular Verbs   Dictionaries are perhaps the most valuable tool one can use in distinguishing between regular and irregular verbs. If only one form of the verb is listed, the verb is regular. If the verb is irregular, the dictionary will list the principal parts of the other forms.    Transitive and Intransitive   Verbs carry the idea of being or action in the sentence.  I am an artist. The artists submitted all their portfolios.  As we will see on this page, verbs are classified in many ways. First, some verbs require an object to complete their meaning: "She wrote _____ ?" Wrote what? She wrote a novel. These verbs are called transitive. Verbs that are intransitive do not require objects: "The library caught fire." In English, you cannot tell the difference between a transitive and intransitive verb by its form; you have to see how the verb is functioning within the sentence. In fact, a verb can be both transitive and intransitive: "The monster collapsed the building by sitting on it."  Although you will seldom hear the term, a ditransitive verb (such as cause or give) is one that can take a direct object and an indirect object at the same time: "That horrid music gave me a headache."    Source: Namara, J.M.C. Guide to Grammar and Writing. Hartford, Connecticut: Capital Community College Foundation, 1999      Linking verbs  are either verbs of sensation ("feel," "look," "smell," "sound," "taste") or verbs of existence ("act," "appear," "be," "become," "continue," "grow," "prove," "remain," "seem," "sit," "strand," "turn"). They are also copulas.  Ø Those people are all poets. Ø Those poets are brilliant. Ø This room smells fresh. Ø I feel great. Ø A victory today seems unlikely.  Some verbs that show change are sometimes called resulting copulas. They, too, link a subject to a predicate adjective:  Ø His face turned ashen. Ø She became wiser. Ø The dogs ran wild. Ø The dog has gone sour. Ø The situation grew ugly.  A  linking verb  connects a subject to a subject complement which identifies or describes the subject, as in the following sentences:  Edward Albee’s play is The Zoo Story.  In this sentence, the linking verb "is" links the noun phrase "Edward Albee’s play" to the identifying phrase "The Zoo Story," which is the one that describes the subject.  Some of us thought that the play was very good.  In this sentence, the verb "was" links the subject complement "very good" to subject "the play".  Others thought it became tedious after the first fifteen minutes.  In this sentence, the linking verb "became" links the subject "it" to the subject complement "tedious." The phrase "after the first fifteen minutes" functions as a adverb modifying the clause "it became tedious".  The cast appears disorganized and confused.  Here "appears" is functioning as a linking verb that connects the subject "the cast" to its subject complement "disorganized and confused".   The play seems absurd to me.  The subject "the play" is joined to its subject complement "absurd" by the linking verb "seems".  Many linking verbs (with the significant exception of "be") can also be used as transitive or intransitive verbs. In the following pairs of sentences, the first sentence uses the highlighted verb as a linking verb and the second uses the same verb as either a transitive or an intransitive verb:    Linking   Sabine says that the food in The Dome tastes great.  In this sentence, the adjective "great" is a subject complement that describes a quality of the food    Transitive   I ate the burger before adding more salt.  Here, the noun phrase "the burger" identifies what "I ate." "The burger" is the direct object of the verb "ate."    Linking   My friend's recording   sounds   very squeaky.  In this example, the phrase "very squeaky" is a subject complement that describes or identities the nature of the "recording."    Source: MacFayden, Heather. Linking Verbs. Ottawa, Canada: University of Ottawa, 1994      Auxiliary or helping verbs  are verbs that are used to help form verb phrases but cannot do so independently. There are four basic auxiliary verb groups:  to be to have modal auxiliaries: to do    To Be   This auxiliary verb is used in the progressive tenses and passive voice:  Progressive Tense: You are painting. You were painting. You have been painting.  Passive Voice: You are painted. You were painted. You have been painted.    To Have   This verb is used as an auxiliary in the perfect tense:  I have finished my paper. I had finished my paper. I have been finished with my paper.    Modal Auxiliaries   These auxiliaries affect the mood of the verb; that is, they determine whether a verb is a fact, desire, possibility, or command. They are most commonly used to represent degrees of freedom or severity.     Most common modal auxiliaries  : will, shall, can, may, need (to), dare, would, should, could, might, must, ought (to)  Ability: I can read. Necessity: I must read. Obligation: I ought to read. Permission: I may read.    To Do   This verb is used when the main verb of the sentence requires aid of an auxiliary, but there is no other helping verb that will fit. It is often used in questions, negative or emphatic statements:  Does he write? He writes, doesn't he? Despite his shaky hands, he does write.    Source: Lamos, Steve. Writer's Workshop.

        ADJECTIVES    There are two types of adjectives: descriptive and limiting.   Descriptive adjectives  are additional things that tell what kind, what color, or what size a person, place, or thing is.The following are suffixes that signal descriptive adjectives: -able, -an, -ant, -ate, -en, -ic, -ish, -less, -ly, -some, -ful, -al, -ar, -ed, -ent, -ing, -ive, -like, -ous, -ary, -y  A  limiting adjective  tells us which one or how many. It is normally the basic part of the sentence pattern that is used unconsciously by the speaker or writer.  Adjectives have  3 degrees of comparison:   positive, comparative,  and  superlative . In using adjectives in comparison, do not add more or most ones that end with –er or –est.  Wrong: Hermione is more humbler than Harry.  Right: Hermione is humbler than Harry. Hermione is more humble than Harry.  Note: Some adjectives remain the same because of their meanings (e.g., outstanding, tasteless, principal, underwater). Noun adjuncts such as nuclear, capsule, and nitrogen do not change in form either.   Adjectives in a series  -when used in sentences or paragraphs should come in correct order to achieve sentence coherence. They should come in the following order:   Noun Determiner -articles, possessives, demonstratives, prenomialsarticles—a, an, the possessives—our, my, your, her, his, its, theirdemonstratives—this, that, these,those pronomials—-indefinite pronominal adjectives: any, all, another, both, few, many, several, some, such-distributive pronominal adjectives: each, every, either, neither-interrogative pronominal adjectives: which, what, whose   Numeral Adjectives : ordinals or cardinals -ordinal adjectives such as five, two, etc. -cardinal adjectives such as first, second, etc.  Quality or characteristic -intelligent, durable, etc.  Size or shape -square, large, etc.  Color —red, brown, etc.  Noun adjunct or noun modifier —narra tree, physics teacher, etc.  (  Source: Robles, Elisa and Cecilia Corsino.

      On Sunday, winds came, bringing a red dust like prairie fire, hot and peppery, searing the inside of my nose, the whites of my eyes. Roaring dust, turning the day from sunlight to midnight.  And as the dust left, rain came. Rain that was no blessing. It came too hard, too fast, and washed the soil away, washed the wheat away with it. Now little remains of Daddy's hard work. And the only choice he has is to give up or start all over again.  At the Strong ranch they didn't get a single drop. So who fared better?  Ma looks out the window at her apple trees. Hard green balls have dropped to the ground. But there are enough left; enough for a small harvest, if we lose no more.  - June 1934

       Before Breakfast   "Where's Papa going with that ax?" said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.  "Out to the hoghouse," replied Mrs. Arable. "Some pigs were born last night."  "I don't see why he needs an ax," continued Fern, who was only eight.  "Well," said her mother, "one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it."  "Do away with it?" shrieked Fern. "You mean kill it? Just because it's smaller than the others?"  Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. "Don't yell, Fern!" she said. "Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway."  Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors. The grass was wet and the earth smelled of springtime. Fern's sneakers were sopping by the time she caught up with her father.  "Please don't kill it!" she sobbed. "It's unfair."  Mr. Arable stopped walking.  "Fern," he said gently, "you will have to learn to control yourself."  "Control myself?" yelled Fern. "This is a matter of life and death, and you talk about controlling myself." Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.  "Fern," said Mr. Arable, "I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!"  "But it's unfair," cried Fern. "The pig couldn't help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?"  Mr. Arable smiled. "Certainly not," he said, looking down at his daughter with love. "But this is different. A little girl is one thing, a little runty pig is another."  "I see no difference," replied Fern, still hanging on to the ax. "This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of."  A queer look came over John Arable's face. He seemed almost ready to cry himself.  "All right," he said. "You go back to the house and I will bring the runt when I come in. I'll let you start it on a bottle, like a baby. Then you'll see what trouble a pig can be."  When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an hour later, he carried a carton under his arm. Fern was upstairs changing her sneakers. The kitchen table was set for breakfast, and the room smelled of coffee, bacon, damp plaster, and wood smoke from the stove.  "Put it on her chair!" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel.  Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink.  "He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely death. And may the good Lord forgive me for this foolishness."  Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. "Oh," she whispered. "Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect."  She closed the carton carefully. First she kissed her father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against her cheek. At this moment her brother Avery came into the room. Avery was ten. He was heavily armed-an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other.  "What's that?" he demanded. "What's Fern got?"  "She's got a guest for breakfast," said Mrs. Arable. "Wash your hands and face, Avery!"  "Let's see it!" said Avery, setting his gun down.  "You call that miserable thing a pig? That's a fine specimen of a pig-it's no bigger than a white rat."  "Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!" said his mother. "The school bus will be along in half an hour."  "Can I have a pig, too, Pop?" asked Avery.  "No, I only distribute pigs to early risers," said Mr. Arable. "Fern was up at daylight, trying to rid the world of injustice. As a result, she now has a pig. A small one, to be sure, but nevertheless a pig. It just shows what can happen if a person gets out of bed promptly. Let's eat!"  But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink of milk. Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. "Give him his breakfast!" she said.  A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig, although tiny, had a good appetite and caught on quickly.  The school bus honked from the road.  "Run!" commanded Mrs. Arable, taking the pig from Fern and slipping a doughnut into her hand. Avery grabbed his gun and another doughnut.  The children ran out to the road and climbed into the bus. Fern took no notice of the others in the bus. She just sat and stared out of the window, thinking what a blissful world it was and how lucky she was to have entire charge of a pig. By the time the bus reached school, Fern had named her pet, selecting the most beautiful name she could think of.  "Its name is Wilbur," she whispered to herself.  She was still thinking about the pig when the teacher said: "Fern, what is the capital of Pennsylvania?"  "Wilbur," replied Fern, dreamily. The pupils giggled. Fern blushed.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The foregoing is excerpted from Charlotte's Web by E. B White and Garth Williams.
