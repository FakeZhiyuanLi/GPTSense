      Play it Loud, Play it Proud  The children stood there weeping, I heard the oldest say, Father please forgive us, the lamb ran away. Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here, There's so much that we don't understand, So I took them in my arms, And we turned and faced the cross, Then I said dear children watch the lamb.  Guys, lent is here. You know what that means. "Watch the Lamb" can be played as often as you would like and no one can say anything about it. Theresa, play it loud and proud for those who don't know what it is. How can you not know about "Watch the Lamb" What a disagrace. Also, why are some people total dumbasses. Just about every author of the reviews of "The Passion of the Christ" I have read totally missed the point of the movie. It was to tell the story of Jesus' death, brutality and all. What do you think happened on the last day. He sat and has tea with the soldiers? I don't think so. The stupid lady in our paper wanted to see more of his gosple message and miracles. I didn't know Jesus was perfroming miracles on his way to be crucified. I'm gonna go see it and yes it will probably be pretty graphic. But thats what I'm expecting. I bet it was alot worse witnessing it in person. Either see it and appreciate it for the story it is telling us or don't go see it. There is no way to lessen the brutatlity shown to Jesus and try to tell the true story. Atleast thats what i think.   Watch the lamb...and listen to the song...and don't eat meat. Damn rules.

       A Weekend of "New"   New things were par for the course this weekend. First I'll list them, then explain them.  1) Visit to the new movie theater. 2) Eating a four o'clock...at Bob Evans. 3) A 'W' for my intramural team.  1) Yes, we have a new movie theater. No longer will we have to drive down Hurstbourne Lane for half an hour to see a movie or go to that hell-hole they call Showcase Cinemas Louisville. We have a new home for movies: Showcase Cinemas 16 Super De Lux located just off the Preston exit of the Gene Snyder. 'Our' movie theater has two entrances (beat that Stonybrook) and 3 eateries located in the building + Starbucks. But unlike Stonybrook, it is eat there or don't eat. No restaurants in walking distance here. Hopefully they'll build a Steak and Shake next door soon. The theater itself is pretty nice, including a self playing piano in the lobby. (Why? IDK.) The seats are REALLY comfortable though. High backs and head rests. And armrests that lift up if you feel the need to take a nap during the movie. Or maybe its for fat people...this we may never know.   2) Ever eaten at 4 o'clock? Well me neither. Atleast that was the case until saturday at...well 4 pm. Ever eaten at Bob Evans for dinner. We me neither. Wait....I also did that Saturday. Ever been the only group at resteraunt. Well me neither.....and again that changed Saturday. On a trip to eat for my granparents anniversary, I accomplished all of these feats at once. To my surprise the food was actually pretty good. But never again will I go to eat at 4 o'clock. I've learned my lesson.  3) Yes, you read correctly.. put a big 'W' on the board for intramural team number 14. In a thirilling 25-22 nailbiter, my team pulled out its first victory of the season only trailing at one time...2-0. The teams best player...(hint: me) scored 5 pivotal points. The championship run has begun and there is not stopping until we have our championship. Or until we lose. Which ever comes first. But does it even matter anymore? No, we have our win and we aren't the worst team anymore. There are still two teams with no wins. So to all you doubters......you're probably still right; it was probably a fluke.   Also, St.X has found a new principal. Good luck putting up with Perry, Mr. Nunn. You will surely need it.   Watch the lamb, we don't want him to get away.

       Where did it come from?     The question has been asked many times, countless hours have been spent pondering about it, but no answer has every been given. Where did the extra verse in the Zimmerman version of the Birthday song come from? I began to think about once again, the decided to some research. Through this research I found out some interesting things I did not know before. The one thing I did not find though was the answer to my original question. I, like many others, believe the original song was created by the Hill sisters right here in the good ol' state of Kentucky. Wrong. The wrote a song with the melody in 1893, but the lyrics for "Happy Birthday to You" first appeared in a book in March of 1924. No one knows who actually wrote the lyrics. Soon, a third Hill sister sued becasue the song was to similar to the original and she won copyrights to the song. Who knew? I know I didn't. But by asking one question I found out a wealth of information I didn't know before.   Now, wecan get back to more important topic. Where exactly did this mystery verse come from. I've asked around and no one I know even knew this extra verse existed, let alone sing it. I assume most of you readin this have also done this. Now, I have a challenge for you. Before the next time we sing this song, which is May 10th, we must figure out where it came from. It must be answered. I can not go through life with out the answer to this simple question. I'm tired of getting looks everywhere I go just because I sing an extra verse to the Birthday song. Haha. Any information is greatly appreciated!   Clap your hands for Jesus.

      New Layout Unvieled: Mind Numbing Amount of Dazzling Spring Colors  That is the official name for Version 2 of Watch The Lamb. The blog went from the dull orange monotone look to this brand spanking new look of 9, yes you heard right, NINE colors. The isn't even including black and white which aren't offiicially colors. But thats a lesson to be learned at a later date..or Intro to 2D class. The colors are ( in order they appear on the page and named to their closest Crayola conterpart): Robins Egg blue, Yellow, Salmon, Brick Red, Orange, Forrest Green, Blue, Purple Mountains Majesty, and Lime Green. It's a color overload.   I guess I'll go ahead and put some more stuff in here while i'm at it. I have something to admit. I watched 3 (THREE) college womens basketball games this weekend. No, I am not sick. Actually, I only watched the end of the last two because they were close. But the first one, I watched the last 15 minutes!!! Crazy. And though it was no doubt not as excting as mens b-ball due to their lack of height and overall non-basketball builds, the game was fairly exciting. Until the end when the ref made a HORRIBLE call and ruined the whole experience for me, not to mention the rest of my night. Just ask Greg. I was bitter. The ref allowed Tennessee to win on free throws with .3 seconds left. Not only did it scar a otherwise good game, it allowed Pat Summit, who i really dislike, and the Tennesse Volunteers ( Ms. Burkes favorite team) to win. Not good. We want Tennessee to lose as mcuh as possible. Also, whats up with this girl winning the slam dunk contest?!?! Her dunks were crap. The guys in the contest must of had some lousy dunks. They probably let her win becasue she is like one of three women on the whole planet that can dunk.   Along with the new layout, Watch the Lamb is going to start featuring new excting 'things' for its loyal viewers to enjoy (probably a little to much than they should.) We all must get our shits and giggles somehow I guess. The new features will range from random tidbits of information I learn each day, to song of the day, question of the day, and other ranodm things that are probably more for my enjoyment and fun than anything else. So here we go:  Recommendations of the Day: 1.) If its a rainy day and you want a movie that is jsut pure excitement and entertainment, go see Dawn of the Dead. Its just a fun movie to watch. 2.) If you don't want exctiement, watch womens basketball.  Fact of the Day:  Greg you already no this one, but, a elephant excretes 220 pounds of poop a day.    In the words of Ray Boltz, clap your hands for Jesus. (And Watch the Lamb)

        To everything Turn Turn Turn. There is a season..     There is a season...and lucky for us its spring. And with we awake from our indoor winter hibernations and explore the new world changing before our eyes as each each day of spring passes. The worst thing to be doing at a time like this is schoolwork. You can't help but get lost in the spring day awating you as you look out the window. Fortunantely as I was doing this today as my mind drifting for a breif second from the chemistry test lying on my desk, I realized this would be mine to enjoy uniterupted for the next 9 days. That is the joy of spring break. Bright sunny days are revealing themselves to us and we get to enjoy the first few of them without school or homework. Thats why I have decided Spring Break is one of the best ideas ever. Whoever first thought, "We should let students enjoy the arrival of spring instead of forcing them to learn while they long to be outside." It gives us that thread of hope that summer will actually come...eventually.   The simple joy of riding down the road with the windows rolled down and a steady breeze swirling through the car returned to me this past week also. It something you don't realize you miss until spring rolls around and your able to do it again. Once the windows are down and your cruising down the interstate, its time to crank up the volume and enjoy the music. This feeling gives you the oppurtunity to anticipate sprawling out by the pool and soaking in some rays as the music floats away through the summer sky. Oh how nice it will be to hop in the pool for the first time this summer.  But now it is time to enjoy spring break. As of now, no plans are set in stone except for sleeping in and being lazy most hours of the day. Hopefully, the weather will cooperate and we can add plenty of outdoor activities to the schedule. But one rainy day is never that bad. A trip to the movies always fits well into the schedule for a rainy day. And I won't have to worry about mom getting on my case about anything ( nah just kidding..Have fun on your adventure!) And yes, mom, the party has already been planned. Haha.   And a time to every purpose, under Heaven: A time to be born, A time to Die. But in spring, there is only a time to be born. And spring break will breath new life into all of us...atleast enough to get us through the rest of trhe school year 'til summer. Until then, enjoy spring.  Watch the Lamb. Spring brings new lambs, too. So be glad about that.  EDIT*: I jsut went to read Greg's blog from a few days ago and noticed they were very similar and that was the first time I had read it. Thats crazy. If two people write the same thing are undoubtedly correct about this subject and everything else we say.

       March Madness Showed Up a Round Late   But did it ever show up for the second round. The Round of 32 was capped off with an amazing UAB upset of the #1 team in the tournament, UK. You can just the excitement in this house as the final buzzer sounded. Also in the second round, Stanford (another number one), two 2 seeds, a three seed, and a four seed fell to upsets. Illinois hammered Cincy by 24 points. The West coast showed why there is an east coast bias in college baskeball. Three big teams from the west fell before the first weekend ended. The third round has shaped up nicely. Marquee match-ups include Duke/Illinois. Each team won both there games by atleast 20 points. The survivor of the OK St./Pitt game should make a run at the championship. UCONN looks like it is playing its best basketball of the season and its a championship contender.  My bracket was done before the weekend even came. Gonzaga was a Final Four team for me. I was successful with my Syracuse pick though. I even picked Illinois and Greg didn't. One thing is for sure though, making 5 brackets was the smart thing to do: I got to put a big black line through Kentucky in each one of them. The most fun I've had drawing a line ever.

       March Madness   March Madness came a little early this year. Sunday was the intramural baskeball league tournament Saint X and it has its fair share of excitement. Not nearly as much as the NCAA Tourney will give us, but a little glimpse of what we hope top see unfold over the next three weeks. My team went into the tourney with a record of 2-4. After a sluggish start, we picked up the pace and held the other team scoreless in the second quarter. We went on to win 27-14. Our next game was a nailbiter. After scoring only two points in the 3rd quarter and then getting two technicals in the 4th (not me though.) we found ourselves down 17-13. With two big baskets in the last two minutes, we took the game to OT. In OT a whopping 5 points were scored, 2 by them and by us. Our points came off of a three with eight seconds left. Our next game was downright pathetic. We just could not get a basket to fall. After scoring 2 points in the first half, we rallied to score 8 in the second. The final score was 33-10. Our final record for the season was an amazing 4-5.   Now to the NCAA Toureny. A crap shoot like usual. The SEC was especially overrated this year. UK should not have been the overall #1, Florida definently didn't deserve a 5, and Vanderbilt shouldn't be a six. And how does Alabama come out of nowhere and get an 8 seed. Though I think Louisville deserved better than a 10 seed, it is better than getting an 8/9. As for my Final Four picks, I jave OK St., UCONN, Gonzaga, and Duke. Then i have OK St. winning it all after defeating UCONN. How bout dem apples? But the Round of 32 and 16 with Pitt, Wisconsin, and OK. St. could happen many different ways. Looks like we should have quite a few really goosd matchups. Get ready for some great college baskeball and many nailbiters and upsets. Good luck with your bracket. Mine will be better than yours.  Watch the Lamb.

       Kickball Anyone?   Kickball has been making quite a comeback for the last couple of years. Why'd it take so long? Who doesn't want to play the game everyone enjoyed playing on the playground in which you get to throw the ball at another person, except maybe the kid who was always picked last. Kickball has officially reached its pinnacle: a St. Xavier Intramural League. It was announced on Friday and by Monday it was the talk of the school. Itramural kickball only comes around once in a lifetime, so I jumped on the oppurtunity and decide to get a team together. Now my team is overflowing with people who want to be on the team. And unlike my intramural basketball team, we aren't going to suck. So, exciting news, huh? Yeah I know Matt and Greg are jealous. No kickball for you.  And now for an intramural baskeball update. Sadly I must tell you that we suffered our fourth lost of the season. But this one was against a very good team. On the whole the loss was pretty respectable. We only lost by 9 points and had our highest output of the season...a big 28 points. The tournament starts this week and it is very possible we will make it to the semis. Our first round game should be an easy win. Next we get to play the drama team. To bad there is a play scheduled for 2 o'clock that day. Looks like a forfeit win for us.  That would match us up against the team we just lost to. Doubt we'll get a win there but you never know. That would be 4 wins for the season! Wow, never would have thought that we'd even get one by the way we played early in the season.  Well thats it for now. Watch the Lamb.

       Fußballjahreszeit Ist Hier Wieder.    As you have heard me say before, I get to play soccer this spring. I have been looking foward to getting back out on the pitch ( as good ol' Tommy Smyth would say) and playing soccer again. There are many reason I love soccer season. The obvious reason is that I get to go out and have some fun playing a sport I love. But there are many less obvious reason other than that.  The second reason is the people. Now that I've been playing soccer with most of the same people for just over 10 years you get to know them pretty well. And they're people I probably wouldn't have met if it wouldn't have been for soccer. By the end of the season you have had plenty off time to bond as a team. This makes tournaments especailly enjoyable. Everybody goes down for the weekend, goes out to eat together, and spends time together doing fun stuff between games. I'm hoping this will happen again this year. State is in Bowling Green which means we get to stay down there. If we make it and I'm not in Egypt at the time (Trip comes before soccer) it should be a great time. Hopefully this time we will come away with the gold. I never would have expected to make so many friends through my soccer team.  Have you ever walked outside on a warm but windy fall or spring day and said "This is soccer weather." That exact thing happened this weekend while i was up visiting Matt at Dayton. We walked outside and were both thinking it when Matt said those exact words. There is just that feel to a day that bring backs the memories of being on the field or watching someone else play. That feeling of being on the field, the sun beating on your neck, and the wind at your back is soemthing I always think of.  When you get that kind of day you can't help but just smile and think back to the days of rec soccer at Okolona. Yes, postseason usually brought about weather that you think only happens one in a lifetime, except if it's the weekend of state or district soccer. Today, the first day of practice, was one of those days too. Partly sunny, a little breezy, and 60 degrees. Gorgeous.  But the bad weather was also a part of soccer you came to love after it was over. You could look back on the weekend and say 'Did we really just sit out and watch soccer in 10 degree weather?" Oh yes, our family did it many times. You got to have dedication to play soccer. You even come to enjoy long rides to the boondocks. Soccer doesn't stop for much. Excessive heat comes for Bluegrass, rain pours down from the clouds many games each season, and hot-chocolate is on demand during the fall. I wonder how much hot chocolate we drank for district soccer games alone? Your guess is as good as mine.   And did I mention money. Soccer season means I have a job...a job=money. Money=good. $1=$6 Egyptian.  Here's to all the memories of seasons past, and here's to one more season ahead. The memories i have are good and bad and too many to count. But I know I can look back on all of them and smile. All these experiences have made my growing up that much better. Too bad its almost over. One more season, maybe two, and the Dowell family will be done with Okolona Soccer Club for good. Man, it probably seemed like this day would never come when it all started 17 years ago. Wow, thats a long time. We should get an award or something. Things look promising this year. We're a little low on players but the ones we have look decent. Maybe, just maybe, we'll end our run with a State Cahmpionship.  Watch the lamb...play soccer. He's pretty good.

        A Blog About College   Searching for a college is no easy task. Luckily for me I've had opportunities to get a good head start on the process. Having three older siblings that all attended college, I've had the pleasure of visiting them at their colleges. Now I have a good feel of what kind of college I would like to attend. Not many people get the chance to get such an in depth look at college life. But I've had 3 visits to 3 different kinds of colleges. Each view gave me a differnt perspective of college. I got the perspective of living off campus, in a dorm, and on campus in a house.   So what have I concluded about the college I want to attend from theses visits. As for the size of the college, I liked the large and middle sized schools. I decided that I didn't want to attend a small school. Each of the frist two had their advantages and disadvanatages. The large campus gave you plenty of room and mad it feel as if it was seperated enough from the surrounding world, which I liked. The size of Dayton's campus was nice becasue there was nothing that was too far away to walk. Another very important aspect that i learned the college I attend must have is good weather. By going to Rice I learned I don't like the really hot weather. By going to Illinois I decided I didn't like cold, snow on the ground for 3 weeks weather. Dayton's weather was something I could deal with, maybe somewhere a little hotter though. Distance from Louisville is also something I have decided on by going on these visits. The college I choose must be fairly close. Definently nothing over 10 hours.  I'm really glad I got to go on all three of my visits. They were all exciting, entertaining, and fun. I can't wait to go on more visits. I think it would be fun to spend a weekend with both my brothers at college, too bad I missed out on the that last year for a stupid dance. And I can't wait to go on my trip out of the country this summer. That should be yet another eye opening experience. And I get to see Jeff! Hell yeah.  In other news, my intramural team put yet another 'W' on the board this weekend, even with out their best player. While I was away, my team squeaked out a vivtory as the clock expired. A hal court shot at the buzzer gave our team a 30-28 victory. Wild Card game this weekend. Who knows what will happen. Also we have managed to get a soccer team together. I'm really happy about that. I can't wait to get out there and playa again. Don't know if we will be any good, we'll find that out tomorrow at practice. That's all for now.   Watch the Lamb....(Even if he is roasting, theresa)...

       The Times They are Changing   Where does the time go? First off, we are one day away from the fifth month of this year. School will be over for me in a month. Wow, the time just flies by. But then think about it in a larger sense. Tomorrow the second of the Dowell clan will be graduating from college. It will be the second attempt for one of us to make it out into the "real" world. Theresa already failed at this. Maybe she will get this right in the fall. Haha.  Next, Mom AND Dad are both gonna turn the big 50 this year. Thats old. Haha. Just kidding.   Then theres me. I will turn the sweet 16 in a little less than two months. Clear the roads, Im coming. This summer we WON't have enough cars. Now, 2 sit there and do nothing. New drivers are the highest priority. Remember that.  And one of you, my siblings, get to teach me how its done. Sorry, Theresa, through experience and the input from others, I don't think its gonna be you. Haha. Or atleast when mom is around.  Anyways, congratulations Matt. You have succesfully made it through your education without failing a grade. Haha. You now have the right to try your hand in the real world. No, McDonalds doesn't count. We have learned something fro the first time. When summer is over, your room is gonna become something else. That ay you won't keep coming back.   Watch the Lamb run in the Kentucky Derby.

       The Derby Turns 130   From the first firework exploding until the blanket of roses lays across the winning horse, The Kentucky Derby Festival takes a hold of our great city. We prepare the whole year for the event, and for two weeks we sit back and enjoy. People flock from around the world to experience this event whcih is unlike any toher event in the world. This uniqueness is what makes it special to me. The Kentucky Derby Festival is not full of run of the mill events that attract the masses. They are a break from the normal. I belive this is the reason it still runs strong to this day. No other place in the world at any other time can you see such a group of misfit events come together to make one amazing experience.   It's the one time of the year everyone is proud of the city they live in. All the problems we face seem to disappear and everyone comes together as a community. We want to show visitors what Louisville truly is about at its core. True southern hospitality. Freindly faces, helping hands, and corteuos people. Derby is a time for celebration. Nothing will get in the way. We are lucky to live in such a great city.   Sometimes the events seem old and commonplace, but then I realize i only get to experience it once a year. At Thunder, I get to see night turned into day. At Bedlam in the Streets, the redneck in us all comes to life. At the Great Steamboat Race, we remember Louisville's history and beginning. At the Great Balloon Race, we get the thrill of seeing dozens of balloons fly over us as we look to the sky. It still amazes me that searching for the balloons in ths sky is such a fun and memorable experience. Then, we get to experience the greatest event on the planet: the Kentucky Derby. An event that can not be described with words.   The moment the horses walk on to the track, your heart speeds up and everyone goes silent. Your eyes are fixed to the TV and the history that is about to take place. The horses are loaded into the gate and the anticipation is to much to hold. The silence erupts into joyous cheers as the horses jet out of the gates. The camera pans as the horses make the first turn, giving you an amazaing view of the  horses and the Twin Spires. People beging to urge their horses on as the jockey for position. Eyes still fized on the TV, people begin to inch closer to the TV as they search for their horse. The best horses begin to emegre from the pack and many viewers see their horses fade from contention. Soon the horses make it to the strecth. Some become silent while others become louder than ever. Then, a horse crosses the line and the race is over. Some jump for joy, others curse, but most jut converse about the amzing race they have jsut seen. Its amazing how one horse race can be so excting. I don't if i get this thrill out of it becasue I am a Louisvillian, but no matter the reason, I hope I never lose my excitment about race.

       Updates on Everything because some people are impatient.   Well, I guess its time to blog again. Stuff has been goign on, but nothing that is important enough to get its own blog. So, today I bring you a recap of the last couple weeks and stuff that is still to come in the weeks ahead. So here goes it.  Here I am going to rant about things that blow my mind. Why do people complain about gas prcies so much, but not the price of clothes? Why is one pair of shorts $30? This seems outrageous to me. How much profit are companioes making of clothes. They probably make $25 on every pair of shorts sold. And did you know that in Europe they pay for gas that would be equal to us paying $5 for every gallon over here. Just think how much we are going to be paying for clothes, cars, amnd houses in 20 years. I don't even want to think about it.  Other things that blow my mind: 1. We are going to be in school til June 2. What ever happened to Labor Day to Memorial day schedules? 2. The people on Survivor are retarted. 3. Matts gtraduation is on Derby weekend. 4. Its already April 23?!!!  There is something i hve been pondering for a while that I want some answers to. Will the Hitler mustache every come back in style or has it been permenently ruined for all mankind?  You decide and tell your thoughts on when and if it will make a comeback.  Next, I will discuss soemthing that has been missing from my life until this year. A travesty of my education. Today, for the first time, I made it all the way up to the Korean War in my social studies class. You think by the time you have taken social studies for the 10th time you would have nothing new to learn. I didn't realize until today that the Korean War took place only 5 years after the end of WWII. I always have placed it in a totally different time period. I have finally made it itno the mid 1900's...yay for me!  Next, its time for a soccer update. We have improved our record to 3-0. I added an assist on Saturday to bring my total to 4 on the season along with 4 goals. Jordan leads the team with 5. And for all your doubters out there...Matt Browing ties for the 3rd most with 2!! WTF? What is this world coming to? We still have a shutout for the season. Next is a game against Sawyer on Saturday @ 3 for all those interested in attending.   Jesus said to stop clapping your hands for him so much, he is getting sick and tired of it.

       How long do you think it takes to find one egg?   It takes longer than you think. And I would know becasue thats what I spent part of my Easter doing. In the end, all I got was a bunch of thumbtacks and probably ecoli. Let me explain. As you know, searching for eggs is an easter tradition. We decided to continue this tradition, but with a new twist. We would eahc hide one egg for another person. In turn, the person you hide an egg for will hide one for you. But not just any egg. For some unknown reason, we decided to search for the smallest eggs we could find. Not a smart decision. After scoping out the best hiding spots for our eggs, we placed them and began our search. Remember that you are searching for a specific egg hidden for you only.   We all began our search in the backyard and Dad almost found his in the first couple minutes. But instead of opening the birdfeeder, he pulled it off of the stand. Then Dad came across another egg, the one I hid for Matt. Luckily I made sure my egg was securely in place becasue he shook the hell out of the swng canopy. Then a few minutes later Matt did the same thing. Not knowing at this moment, I had already been feet away form my egg a couple times. Twenty minutes had passed without a egg being found when we decided to narrow the search by telling in which yard we had hid our eggs. Five minutes later, Mom won the search by finding her egg hidden in the gas tank of the Tauras. Dad claimed second a few minutes later when he went back to the birdfeeder and successfully opened it this time. Matt and I were still struggling at this time. Just shows we hid our eggs better. At this time I seemed to begin wandering aimlessly which accomplished nothing. Then matt found his egg about 35 minutes in to the game. Before I continue the story I just want to state that Matt cheated. I had to search through a bucket full of bricks and ecoli infested water to find my egg. What the crap. I had searched through this same bucket dozens of times but always stopped because I thought Matt wouldn't put my egg floating on the water. You lousy bastard. All in all, it was a fun game that only our crazy family would think of doing. Wow we are wierd.  In our eggs, we were required to a prize for our enemy.  Prize recap: I won an egg full of thumbtacks. Thumbtacks that were in the buffet drawer. Thumbtacks I could have gotten in 5 seconds but instead searched 38 minutes for. Matt won a soccer ball eraser, rubberband, penny, Wint-O-Green Lifesaver and one of those things you put on the bottom of a chair so it doesn't scratch the floor. Mom won a qaurter. Dad won a penny, dead watch battery, and peppermint. Great prizes don't ya think?  This is what I have learened from this experience. Easter eggs are meant to have mulitple eggs for a reason. It's really hard to find really small eggs. Certain prizes are put in eggs for reasons, such as candy or money. My family is totally messed up in the head. Damn green box.   I had a good easter, hope your was just as good!  Jesus has risen, CLAP YOUR HANDS FOR HIM!

       Clap your Hands for SOTY and Jesus.   Today is Good Friday, but yesterday was the Story of the Year concert @ Jillians which was kickass. All the bands played to a huge crowd. Lucky Boy Confusion and Story of the Year rocked. The other two bands weren't to good, but nothing terrible. The third band, Hazen St., had some weird ghetto rock thing going. Let's just say that was very odd. For most of our group of about 10, this was our first rock concert. We really didn't really know what it was gonna be like, but once we got there we had a lot of fun. Even though the lyrics were hard to hear over the music, the songs were really good. We stayed away from the crazy people up closer to the stage. And nobody was brave enough to crowdsurf.   Other then SOTY, I didn't really know what the bands were singing but Lucky Boy Confusion had a really good sound. SOTY played all of my favorties and they sounded really good live. They also put on a good show up on stage. The band had a lot of energy and knew what to do to keep the crowd into the concert. The crowd was large and the music was loud, which made the evening really exciting and enjoyable. When the volume is cranked up and the band is putting on a good show, you can really get into the music. It also made me deaf for a few hours. The fact that it was a smaller concert also made it better. It allowed you to be close to the stage, but you could also stand in the back and still be very much a part of the concert. Jillians and WLRS put together quite a concert. Can't wait for the next one.    I was holy today. I went to church. Yay for me. It's Good Friday you know, so don't forget to clap your hands for JESUS!

       Theresa is out of the loop. Again.   Theresa you really must try to stay up with the times. We have been clapping our hands for Jesus for quite a while now. It's the cool thing to do. I guess Greeks aren't cool enough to clap their hands for Jesus. So I guess I'll tell you where it comes from. We have Ray Boltz to thank for this also, along with the many other great things he has opened our eyes to. Haha.   Greg downloaded the live version of "Watch the Lamb." At the beginning and end of the son Ray talks to the audience. At the beginning he tells them why he decided to sing about Jesus. "Because there is nothing greater to sing about," he says. Then at the end he goes all holy on us. He tells us to 'clap your hands for Jesus Christ the Son of God right now'. And as Ray said, no christian musician gave his life for us, Jesus did. So true. Haha.

       Rain, Rain Go Away...   Will it ever stop. It seems that it has been raining here in Louisville for about 2 straight weeks. A batch of storms will pop up and come through for a few hours and then move on. But at the same time more storms are forming just out of radar distance. Along with the downpours we have received some hail and right now, our second tornado warning, even though it is for the notrthern part of the county. You gotta love tornado season. It's the time of the year when meterologists butt into to way too much television and cause unneeded mass paranoia. I did get to a tornado hitting Clarksville live on WHAS Sky Cam. The rain has caused its fair share of problems. The Indy 500 was dealayed for 2 hours and as of now is still under a red flag. Not to mention that Valhalla Golf Course is now offically a lake.   (Hour or so break)  Well, I had to quit writing because they issued a tornado warning for our area. About 20 minutes later 2 tornados were spotted in our area. One by the Billtown Rd. exit off the Gene Snyder and one by the Glenmary subdivision. They was terrential rain and large hail in our area but we didn't get either. So we survived. More is headed in tonite. Will if ever stop? I just want to swim.

       2 Down, 2 to Go   It seems summer started a while ago when you look at the temperatures for the last week or so. But for me the unofficial start of summer happened just before noon today. That is when my "F" period final ended, even though it only took about and hour and five minutes to complete. Honestly, who needs the whole hour and fourty-five minutes to complete a Christian Scriptures test. Not me.   My sophomore year at St. X is over. I'm glad to announce I survived. Overall, it was a great year. Homeroom was always fun and Mr. Price was a great teacher. He always knew when to add in a joke to spice the lesson up a little. I don't know how he can still stand to use the overhead so much after all these years. I barely made it a year using it. I somehow managed to make it through Sophomore English. Greg, Ms. Burke is not as bad as you said. Yes, she does have a very loud, piercing voice. But lets be honest, she loves us Dowells. I can't even remember how many times she would say something like "there is no doubt that he is a Dowell." Sorry Greg, she said I was the best Dowell. My favorite thing to do in her class was to test to see how much favoritism she showed toward me. Every time she yelled at someone for doing something that annoyed her I would do the exact same thing. Not once did she say anything. Man, that class was so easy. I survived another year of Mr. Knoop. Too bad I have another one to go. Atleast I don't have to have another Mrs. Roberts class. Man, how dull can a class get? Mrs. Jefferson's class was a blast. It's hard to imagine a person so nice and optimistic as she was. Too bad I only had here for one semester. Then I got Mrs. Vessels for Theology. Let's just say she took theology just a little to seriously.  I didn't really know what to think of Mr. Smith before the year started but he turned out to be a good teacher. That was probably my favorite class all year. Never a dull moment. I actually had fun in that class. Also this year, I got to choose some electives. I chose two art classes which really helped develop my skills. I learned a whole lot about art and improved a lot over the year. I drew some realistic things that I never knew I was able to draw. Overall the year was really fun. I continued to make new friends and build relationships I made the year before. You really don't realize that its possible still not to know some people after two years of school.   Now, its time for the really exciting stuff to begin. The summer looks like its gonna awesome. In five short days I'll be off crossing the Atlantic. Plenty of pool parties are in the planning stages and in 1 month, 1 day I will get my permit. Not to mention that soccer is kicking in to high gear. So here's to a great summer.

       Perfection!   I have experienced many things while playing soccer at Okolona for the past decade, but today was a new first. With todays victory, my team completed its first undefeated regular season. The 6-0 victory in the blistering heat of Sunday summer afternoon capped off the season in spectacular fashion. The whole season my team had playd very well together, which surprised me considering this is the first season many of us had played together. But the way we played today was amazing. We played as a team, passing the ball well, calling for the ball, and looking to get someone else a goal. I did score two goals, but it was a total team effort. We scored three goals off direct kicks, one off of a PK, and Bailey added a header into the mix. Jacob finished off the season with yet another performance in goal. It jsut goes to show you, having a great goalie is the first step in building a winning team.   But this is jsut the middle of the season. 2 weeks from now, while I'm enjoying my trip to Greece and Egypt, my team will be winning our ticket to Bowling Green for the Tide Cup. The fun is just beginning. I am really looking forward to the all the fun we are gonna have this summer. Who knows? Maybe this is the year. Finally.

       Not One But Two Funny Green Ogres   The 2 in the title of the second Shrek movie doesn't just denote the fact that its a sequel, it also means there is double the hilarity in this movie. Not to mention, double the amount of ogres. Who knew big green ogres could be so funny. Add in a obnoxious donkey, a strange Puss in Boots, along with an array of other funny characters and place them in a overhauled fairy tale setting and the result is a brilliant movie. The movie was not as unique and fresh as the first, but Shrek still has plenty left in him the second time aroud. The spoofs of classic fairy tales and movies alike were my favorite parts. When you think about it, almost everyline contained in Shrek is a joke. the movie is filled with many one liners and funny scenes that lead directly into the next funny scene. Much to my liking, the gingerbread man did return. The gumdrop button joke and the muffin man joke return, but are jsut as funny the second time around. I don't want to give to much away so just go see it for yourself. this is one movie that is worth your $8. Don't wait until it comes out on video, see it TODAY!  I also find Shrek interesting because it is one of the career fields I see myself wanting to get into. Something along the lines of animation or video game design is what I hope to get involved with. Everytime I play a videogame or watch an animated film I think about how cool it would be the one who helped design it. To create something even close to the caliber of Shrek would be amazing. People are in awe when the witness how detailed and real the the film looks. I sometimes wonder how they do it. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be sitting in the theaters watching a film i created or a video game I designed.

       For Your Information   Today, I was able to enjoy yet another wet day at Okolona Soccer Fields. Add this one on to the growing list. Although games in the rain are fun, it is the complete opposite when you are reffing. It wasn't too bad though. I reffed two games and made 46 big ones. You are in store for some nifty gifts from Egypt, maybe. Haha. On another topic, ignorant people tick me off. There is nothing i hate more than people who open their mouth when the have no clue what they are saying. If I ever coach a team, all the parents are going to be required to read the rule books. If they don't, they won't be allowed to say anything.  By the time my game started the rain decided to stop. The field was still plenty messy though. Like usual we got off to a slow start and missed numerous chances. We really need to learn how to finish plays and get the ball in the back of the net. Anyway, we still pulled out a 4-1 victory. Now we are only one victory away from my first undefeated regular season ever. Its about damn time. Then we get a two week break and districts start. Unfortunately, I will miss them (but I'll be in Greece. Yay) but I know my team will get us into state. Then who knows what will happen from there. Our version of the Triple Crown sounds nice: districts, state, and bluegrass.   Well, I better get back to help planning our trip to Egypt.

       News from the School Front   The whole school was buzzing with some exciting news today. We no longer have to go until June 2, instead we get out the Friday before Memorial Day, May 28th. Damn staright they should allow us the remember our veterans with out having to remember school matters at the same time. The only drawback is that we will lose two days in class to prepare for the exams. I'll take the trade though. Guess I will actually have to study at home.   In other school news, Mr. John Price has become Teacher of the Year for the second time. Must have been the White Castles and pizza. A little bribery never hurt anyone.   Might as well do a soccer overview while I'm at it. Record: 6-0 Goals: 5 (+2 U-19) Assists: 5 Goals Against: 5 Goals For: Ummmmmmm..alot. Lets see...7+11+3+2+6+4= 33  Games Remaining: Jtown. @Marion County

       Action Packed Weekend   There aren't enough hours in the day. Each week it seems I have more to do and less time to do it all. This weekend tops them all. Starting the moment I got home from school on Friday, I never really had a free moment.  The dance was on Friday night and I had to get a shower and be out the door in time for me and Steve to go pick up our dates and get to the restaurant. The dance was, to my surprise, a lot of fun. You should have seen me get my groove on. Or maybe not. But the fun didn't stop there. On the way home the van ran out of gas just before the Smyrna exit. It took about 25 minutes for mom and dad to come get us and then we headed over to Steves.  After a few hopurs of sleep on Friday night, I had to wake up at 8 to go ref some soccer games. It was jsut my luck that Hector had rescheduled his game for 10 o'clock in between the two other games I was reffing. We ran behing all day and I was spent by the time my game started. To top it off, it was completly cunny and 85 degrees. The sunscreen sure did work though. We went on to win our game 4-2. Then we headed home for about 30 minutes until we headed out to Nelson County for the U-19 game. I wouldn't even call this one a game. We won 14-0. I had 2 goals. Then, I got to eat for the first time in 24 hours, when we ate before the dance. I didn't think it was possible to be as tired as I was by the end of Saturday.  Then it was Mothers Day. It was a nice day. Sunny and hot again. We gave mom her presetns and helped her fill her birdfeeders. Wow, was it hot. After i fixed tuna fish for lunch, I headed out to ref three more games. These were actally entertaining though. The U-11 girls i reffed were better than half of the players on my team. The heat was unbearable but I earned $62 on top of the $47 i got the day before.   The busy days continued today, moms big 50th birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM. I reffed more sooccer games today, and I have some on Tuesday and Thursday. It doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The end of the shcool year is coming up and exams will be upon us soon. Maybe summer will bring the needed releif. Hopefully a trip to Egypt and dozens of dips in the pool will be a relaxing change. I will keep looking for that. Until then, If you would like to donate your time to help, just let me know. Hope your weekend was as fun, but not as busy as mine. Thats all.   Everyone should check out the Sunday  B.C. . It say's goose. And anything that mentions geese is funny. Check it out here.   http://www.comics.com/creators/bc/archive/bc-20040509.html  Don't worry guys, summer will be here before you know it.

       A Final Game Flop   Unfortunately, that is the only way to describe the end to otherwise fantastic season. One half of great soccer left us 40 minutes away from a championship game birth. And for a second straight year, a lapse of concentration for no more than 10 minutes dashed our hopes. We played some of our best soccer for the first half gaining a 2-0 advantage at halftime. Our first goal came off a great pass from Josh and a simple finish from Jordan. Josh dribbled the ball down the side of the field, cut into the the box, and slid the ball in front of the goal after the goalie had committed. Jordan sent it into the back of the net with a simple instep touch. The momentum definently swung in our favor. Later in the half we controlled the ball just outside of the box. Brock took the ball and dribbled to the goal but was tripped in the process. A tactic Vine Grove would use throughout the game. At first it looked like it worked when Josh, our sure fire PK shooter, kicked it straight at the keeper. Luckily, we got a second chance because the keeper moved off the line before the kick. This time he placed in right inside that post. Victory seemed closer than ever. We were riding high and ready to send Vine Grove packing. Half-time came and we got a needed and deserved break. We were having so much fun that we didn't even talk strategy at half. No one could have anticipated what came next. Maybe we got a little cocky. Maybe we let our guard down. Whatever happened, it wasn't good. The half started well. We controlled the ball for the first couple minutes of the half and got off a few shots. I believe they were our last of the game. Fatigue began to set in and their fresh legs due to have a full roster of 18 began to control the game. Athanasis was missing from our defensive line, leaving a big hole. They had played well all weekend but it couldn't last forever. Fatigue led to mistakes and mistakes led to goals. Four of them to be exact. Nothing seemed to go our way in the second half. I guess it wasn't meant to be.  Somehow the State Championship crown managed to elude our grasp for the fourth time. I was going to blog about some the reasons I believed we lost the final game, but I decided it doesn;t do any good to dwell on the things I can't change. Vine Grove beat us. Maybe brute force and tactics that should be controlled by the refs come out on top of skill and finesse. I decided I would remember the the good things about this season and all the fun I had. Saturday is a prime example of something I will remember for years to come. The first game we played that day was easily our best played game of the season. After not seeing my teammates or playing soccer in over 4 weeks, I was eager to get back on the field. My teammates and I were ready to go. We got off to a sluggish start but then the pieces began to fall into place. Our first goal came when I picked up a lose ball, dribbled past one defender, and laid the ball off for Steve who was flying up on my right. I couldn't see him coming, but everyone else on my team could. I could have swore every person on my team was telling me Steve was making a run when I had the ball. That is how our team seemed to play all year. We play so well as a team. After Jacob slipped in goal and they scored, we took back our lead on a beautiful direct kick by Josh. In the second game, we beat our rival Fern Creek 2-0. I had a goal in this game off a great headed pass by Jordan. Jordan added the second goal after he pulled an amazing move in the back. One of the best goals of the season.   But its the fun I get to have with my team after the games that's the reason I love State Cup. After the second game, me, Jordan, Mike, Josh, Steve, and Jacob went to Longhorn for dinner. I never you could have so much fun at a restaurant. We were our usually goofy selves and our waitress played along with us. Jordan told her it was my birthday everytime she came to our table so I got free desert. Somehow during the course of the night we found out she was married, was 22 years old, was from Nashville, and was moving to Florida on Wednesday. The best part was when Jacob asked if he could atleast have a hug because they forget his food. She told us that we were her favorite group ever. There is never a dull moment when we're around. Later we went to the go-kart track for a little racing. That was a lot of fun, too.   No, we didn't win the state championship, but does it really matter? I had tons of fun this season. I met new people, made new friends, and got to enjoy a whole season with them. Now, all that matters is what I take from this season. I'll take those friends and memories and that's all that matters now.

      A Fast Start To the Summer  Well, here it is, the final day of my vacation. After a two week trip to Greece and Egypt, I am spending my final day trying to relax and catch up on lost sleep and an overall exhausting trip. Anyway, the trip was amazing. It is like nothing I have done before. But the stories will have to wait. I don't want to tell about everything in one blog. So make sure you check back in regurally to see happens next. You will read about my travels to the Parthenon, Great Pyramids of Giza, Valley of the Kings and more. The trip was very exciting and memorable and I hope you have just as much fun reading about my adventures. Stay tuned.  In other news, plenty more is still on tap for the coming weeks. This Saturday and Sunday I will be in Bowling Green for soccer State Finals. I'm really excited about the tournament and am expecting to have tons of fun. Our undefeated season came to and end last weekend. But now we have to the oppurtunity to turn the tides at State. Stay tuned for more information on this come Monday.  Also, my sixteenth birthdays is only 12 days away. You know what that means, I get my drivers permit. Yay!   There is so much happening in so little time. It's exhausting but is also tons of fun. Even when its finished I still have lazy days by the pool, trips to the lake, and hanging out with friends to enjoy. Ogh how I love summer.
