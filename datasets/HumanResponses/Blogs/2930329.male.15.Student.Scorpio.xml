      Dearest Blog, Today at school I have added A new member Sheila Hensley(Batteries not Included). We came to the agreement in Computer Ap. Today as in a Desperate attempt to learn Secrets. Along wtih the fact that I have been proclaimed with A new nickname Dicksmack? And Sheilas is Either "Worry Wart" or "Fat Ass"? I prefar Worry Wart because she gets what appears to be a lump of baby Fat on her foreHead When She gets Worried?! (LOL) Just to let you know how lunch went I felt very Uncomfortable? Why? I think it is because of Sheilas Boyfriend Justin? I just feel like in that situation I Cant say The same Things as I usualy Do? Like I'll cross some boundary that is to be un penitrated!? Wierd Huh? oh well... Dad told me that I am supposed to be Going to an Aerosmith Consert in Cinncinati! Whenever that is? I also need to call Lindsey (Capricorn) oh wait It's her Spring break, Duh.. As for people that I Either HATE or CONFUSE me todays Winner is Chris Buttcrum oh wait thats Chris Baucom? (sorry) See the thing is he try to imply as my friend, When in fact I dont like him because he is Racist, Sexist, and is an Asshole! And then I find out that Ronnie (?) is having to one of my Former Girlfriends Amanda who I mentioned earlier and he plans to go out with Jessica (Trusty, I think?) (Shiela dont you speak a living word of this to Amanda or anybody!) Because apparently Amanda is bored With Ronnie? Hey thats what happened to me Ronnie! That is why on April 15th 2004 Ronnie and I started the FBOAS Former Boyfriends Of Amanda Society! Neat huh? Im glad my Dad (Capricorn) is working Late tonight he is an Asshole! Not that he hits me but Shit?! Lay-off?Also, since It that time Again of the Year! (No not Lesbian Tuesday or Christmas!?) Turkey Season! yah I hate it to, Why ill tell you why because turkey hunting is the apitamy of the product of my Boredomness! all i Do is Clmb Huge A$$ Hills and blow on A piece Of Duct tape And Latex (Not a Condum Perve?!) and Sit on my A$$? Which is something I could do At school if I wanted to! And it Realy sux Because tommorows Friday and I hate weekends and I Love School! But at least Two of my Brothers and my Dadinator Will be gone Friday, Saturday, And Sunday! so on friday Im going to sneak out of the house Friday Night! (Sheila I am bored! Help Me!?)

      Dearest Blog, Seeming how the school has gottan there hands a hold of you! I had no other choice but to delete You for my secrets would have been exposed. And to tell you about how my Day went It was so F!@ked-up! Why you Ask? Because I dont know why, My day started off as usual in its own Ritualized Routine that high school has put me On. I get out of bed after Saying to myself countless times " Just Five more Minutes, Just five More minutes!" Which eventualy turn into 30? I crawl out of bed and ask myself is it an A day or B day? B day of course which is my favorite day ( Dont ask!) I quickly get ready to go  by Consuming the always Reliable Bagel and Glass of Orange Juice and then jumping into the shower, And last but not Formatable Clothes and what I HAVE to wear (Dress Code) Blue Collared dress shirt and blue jeans "Great" i think to Myself "I look like A Smurf that has grown 6 Feet?", Put Gel in my Hair Which hasnt been done for 2 years, I make Shift with the look of a Metro-Sexual and I'm of to my Nieghbors house Candace Abbney (Cancer) which i stay and Commute with them for about 10 minutes 7:30-7:40 ten minutes Before the Bus Arrives which talking to Candace and her mom Tammy (Aquarious) is always an engourement Of communication. We then get out and say our goodByes to Tam. When we Arrive at the Acadamy of Living Hell (Pendleton County High School) I cruise the Hallways and think of What a pathetic Loser I look Like!? I then remind myself that This is testing prep week and how thankful I am that Mrs.Reed the Librarian has picked me to be In Her study Group. So I head of to The Library and set myself and my stuff down. And Cruise the Halls Talking To What Little people I know. (Maybe that is my downfall As a Scorpio?) Reminding myself that I have to live with this B#$lS^&t for the next 4 Years (As being A freshman Of course?) I then go back to the Library knowing that I have but only 5 Minutes and fall asleep at the table.  Amanda Wallace (Tauras) Wakes me up and Tells me it is time That I should get up and get out. So I head out to Gym (I hate The Class with A passion!) Picking my clothes up at the Locker... After Gym It is English ( Hate it 2!) But there is always Reliable Friend Shiela Hensley(Leo) we spend the class passing notes Back And forth about her and Her Boyfriend and that short dude (Tell You Later)   Eventualy Im at the Brink of Insanity and Shiela is dead And Im thinking about poking her with A stick to See if She is Still Alive? But IM saved by the bell and once again I am off to try to find out what the (Shiela and I call him the muchkin man) Hell Kieth (?) is up to by asking me these wierd questions about or should I say Like  1. K/Do you want to get out of here?     W/No? 2. K/Did you tell them yet?     W/ Wah?! and countless other questions?! Its so wierd! What does he want from me?! (Shiela says he wants my @$$ and that she thinks he is hot?) Shiela is a somewhat confusing Character to me in part Because She Appears as this sugar Coated prepy blonde girl but doesnt hang out with others like her self?! She Hangs out with me? Why? I have no Clue! Im not ugly for sure but I have never hanged out with the "IN-Crowd" plus the fact that I moved here 2 years ago (Falmouth, Kentucky) But She moved her on the same day?! Wierd Huh? By the time Lunch rolls Around like a Beheaded Banshee I Am Jumping off the walls because that how it always is I have a fast MetabiliZim~ and I am Hungry so shiela her our friend Angela and her BoyFriend Justin go to lunch and sit at the same table and thank god its Bambi (?) (Bi-Sexual!) and her friends sit by us and I freakin out! Justin yells out "Its Lesbian Tuesday!" and I say something realy loud ( I forget) and it Draws Everyones atention. Good Friend Bambi comes over and sits on my Lap and says "Hello..." and I reply " Hello,Hello, and Hello" (Think about it) and so that episode of whatever ends and I take a french fry and smere it all over my arms and im just freakin out like im a gerbil on crack! and WERE all diein From laughter and doin stupid stuff!? And then near the end of lunch The Sex Munchkin comes over and sits By me and Im thinkin "Arent you Supposed To Be sitting by your Prep School Friends?" And He starts Smiling and asking me these Questions About me like Whats Your name and What Grade are you In and stupid stuff and then I ask him Why he Asked me Those wierd questions and by then shiela is listening and he denny's it ( Not like a Jerk but just Blonde like?) Quote on Quote Like A Darbie? So I Shake hands with this Stranger that stalks me And Say good-Bye and its time to leave! The rest of the day doesnt matter ok! Tommorow I will tell you more about Me!? Goodnight...

      Dear Blog, The liveing torment that i call school is finaly over and I can finaly start reinventing myself so that (I know i sound pathetic) next things will be better than last year, my Sophmore Year. Starting off ill get a job and make my own cash and not have to beg for, 2 im Joining soccer (again), and ill also start out some sort of workout routine that will get me somewhere, and if im gonna join the soccer team ive obviosly got to start running every Morning... early, before sunrise, lets say A mile and then im moving into our new house a 1/2 mile away from the state park,(ill still goto the same school) and next door to the public pool. being a life guard would be to cool, the house is 5 bed, 3 bath, which is a miracle! My own room? but i have yet to wait another month, we move in July 3 which is not the best idea, 4th of July and New House Move In? no, not a good idea... Goodnight

      Dearest Blog, For the most part today was not what I Expected At all. Like when My parents said that they were going to there good friend pup's party Knowing that most likely Dad was going to get wasted and they would stay the night Leaving My brother Tanner (Capricorn) alone at Home But instead came home early!? But I did meet this one Dude from Florida, How you ask? I was in this chatroom because i was very,very,very, bored when he typed in "Im 15 male blonde hair blue eyes and i play soccer, and track." I then thought to myself, "Hey I didnt type that" so i made a pit-stop with an IM and that was that? but Dad wouldnt stop calling me out to help wash the truck and suv (Chevy Silverado 2000' and Chevy Suburban 1997') Which that truck is MINE! that is when i get my permit and then license and she is all mine. But ofcourse that is a long time away, besides ill be fine till then and non of the sophmores start driveing except around the end of the year.

      Dearest Blog, Lucky for me there is one day left of school which is totaly cool because im realy sick of the shit people Have been putting me Through with this whole trying to get By with the grin and bear it Routine, Another great bit of news is that im gonna pass English 1! How you ask?! I cheated? How you ask?! Mr.biggs didnt see that i had somebody elses book on the floor open with all the anwsers to the exam available at the end of my pencil!? But i know that if I realy Did ace The Exam then hes gonna be Curious on how the hell i pulled an All-nighter? which is what i did last night any how. And as for Sheila? Well lets just say that things seem back to normal and yet at the same time, Acqward? it just doesnt seem the same? Sheila isnt going out with Justin any more which is sad because he was the only boyfriend I could laugh with and not feel like a Complete Dumbass. I feel bad because I ruined what they had? which is something special, Each other... I only wish that i could have somebody to love? which hasnt been in present forever? But then again Sheila's options are always many and never few, which then again is something that i wish i had but, apparently not.(LOL)In GYM this morning with Mr.Gondars Dictator like routine we all (Us guys) cramed on the bus and made our way downtown to the ball park along with the girls health class bus behind us. I hung out with a group of people i hanged-out with last year And realized what fun i had with them last year and the main subject was about embers nipple rings, which was funny cause all the guys wanted to see safety pins but the best they could get was the outline. And hung out back on the bus with different groups of people and then thought of making a run for McDonalds and then My house which was two blocks away, but everybody mandated that they would if it was the last day of school. And then i find that my Dad asks if i want To do Stuff with him at The completely Wrong Time? Like Fishing and playing the guitar or whatever, its all about time management.  But as always my dads auto response was the same "Am i Taking up to much of your Time!?" Whatever Dad. And then he wonders why im in my room or on the pc or outside and i say "Cause thats what normal Teenagers do Dad, and i would like to avoid you..." And in other news! Kieth is wierding me the hell out. Is he trying to pull a Ronnie by Being nice and trying to get a good word with Sheila? I dont think so? He seemed pretty capable of doing that all by himself at lunch today.( I chose not to sit with her because of "Jamie?") But i finished my algebra exam early and cruised the halls with Ronnie and gave him the cheat sheet to the English Exam, I made my way to the cafetiria and to my suprise it was munchkin man starring me down? I had no clue what the hell he was up to but I wasnt to interested, so i sat two tables away with a smerk on my face but in no time at All He Urges me to sit with "Them" and so i hesitated and decided there was no other choice but to? (What does he want?) And before I no it Brittney Ingall (?) and Nakesha (?) (Not black!) are calling me by that horrid Nickname "Wadell" (It just stuck ok!?) but at least somebody was behind me and showed that i wasnt The Laughing stock of the herd, Kieth , by saying "No you stupid dikes, his name is wade? or Nathan? Which one" and without doubt i stuck with "Wade" Brittney replied "Shutup you faggot?!" but they were obviously just teasing each other which is a very confusing game i usualy did not take interest into by any social standard. But before long Kieth and I were talking about stupid Shit and how by accident how he shaved his head bald? (Which i thought was funny) but he said he didnt realy care about what his hair looked like.  And then Somehow!? he gets the Dam nerve to ask me if im Gay?! Jesus Fucking Christ!? It was for certain that he was. But am I Sexist,Racist,Byist,or Prejudice? No, not in any way shape or for an I. And then he later asks me if i have any hot cousins or sisters? And so wit takes over with Cockyness and I said with unextreme offense "Well, YOu could go out with my cousin? After all He is Gay?" He got the joke and Laughed. But i am confused by him in so many God Dam ways it's not funny why i cant figure him out? I mean with most people it's so easy to figure what and who they realy are but Kieth was always with somebody so it was like there was no compatibility to "Figure" him out by probing into his every thought.

      Dearest Blog, I know that it has been a while since i have been able to get back to you and I know That Is wrong but so much Fucking god dahm Bullshit went on this week that i dont know what to do! Why? you ask again, I did something i should not have done, and that was tell a secret, one that when spilled out at the time didnt seem like such a Big deal at all? As of always you know of Sheila Hensley, I back stabed her monday bye telling Ronnie Dunagan (Taurus) that she was going out with Cameron Ernst (?) knowing the fact that Sheila already had a boyfriend Ronnie Told everyone and it spread like Wildfire. Why did i do this? I told Ronnie this so that he would once and for all that he didnothaveahell with Her! But this statement or truth quickly backfired on me and her the hardest of all. The next day in english long after word had gotten to her she started cutting me down with the heavy mixture of curse words and asking me why i did this to her and that "Real Friends dont back stab Wade!" I did not respond to this at any cost but instead sat like rock and waited for the Tidal Wave of harassment to End, but that was just the begining of the storm because that Trogledite of a Native American Bitch Jamie Mitchell(?) Stepped in and played good bitch by cursing me and asking such a ballistic question like "What the hell is your Problem?" i couldnt take it and so i did what Pocahontas (Jamie's Nickname) wanted me to do, walk out of english class and cruise the hallways. Doing so within no time at all I ran into Reliable Ronnie and we talked about the shit this was kicking up, Ronnie then said that if he went back to english he was gonna kick Camerons ass? But to my dismay that was starting to seem like some twisted reality when The principal Mr.Deerborn asked us where we were going and that he had been looking for us, so he took us back to class un-upset about this minor ordeal and we made are way back to class

      Dearest Blog, Why is it that my Parents are such lier's? Maybe because my dad doesnt want me to play Soccer this year, Im sure if i said I wanted to play Golf he would be all over that!? His excuss was that My algebra grade was chronicly damaged? And my response to this "Then I guess I can sit in my room all summer?" and then my dad blows off steam with "Get yourself back here smartass!" And as for my mom? She makes to many promises, and is not so optimistic,at all!? Goodnight...

      Dearest Blog, I am sycked that Soccer Season is almost Here!? Finaly i have a Hobbie? And an Outlet Besides the internet to Make new friends, People that I can get along with. But then again what if I'm being to Nieve? Hopefully not, because Soccer sign-ups are do this Sunday, My younger brother Bodin (Aquarious) is also joining the soccer team so at least I'll have someone to practice with? And in other news, well I'm trying not to avoid Sheila because shes done asked me to coney island and kings island, Both days I was busy and I'll be busy this summer, She had said that she Knew why I did what I did (wink wink) she said "because your jealous of Cameron?" I'm glad to say that I'm not but still, she was heading in the wrong direction with this one. And as for my work-out routine, Let's just say that I'm having trouble sticking to it, but I'm seeing results? And when I start Soccer my routine will be Twice worth the trouble, Double Fold! Goodnight...

      Dearest Blog, Once again that chronicly tirening medication has slowed me down, Strattera. It was prescribed by my counselor Mary Gina (God bless her.) This drug is supposed to help me consentrate but the only thing it does for me is make me tired,irratable and have an impulsive desire to either fix,learn,obtain,or do things. It's obviusly working because i do have a moment of silence in my sub-consious to were i don't think about random things that don't matter, "good-thing" Ive also been in the chat-rooms and meeting people my own age, Last night i met Emily who is 15 and from Illinois (Lot of corn,I know) and we talk all last night, which was cool cause I have'nt been able to talk to Sheila since Forever, or at least since the last day of school. Another self emploid trait is that i've been watching Adult Swim late at night on cartoon network, Favorite shows are "Aqua teen Hunger force, Family Guy,and Futuram..." Screw that Anime crap, "way to confusing to watch or even try to understand" I also need someone in My life right now... that's all for right now Good-Day...
