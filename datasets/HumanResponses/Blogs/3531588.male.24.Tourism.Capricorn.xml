      Did you ever notice that to every good thing there is a seemingly bad side? Here's an example... You buy a brand new car, with all the bells and whistles that you can afford. Except a few months later, you recieve the your new auto insurance quote. It's sky-rocketed. Sound familiar?  This exact thing has happened to me; I drive remotley safe. I try not to park on the street unless I absolutely have to. But I found an interesting thing out when I was researching new insurance quotes -- over 80% of insurers now use your credit score as a major determining factor in your rate. This is absolutely ridiculous. For the past year, I have prepaid the 6 month term on my policy, and now because my insurer has decided to use my credit score to determine my rate, my premiums have gone up almost $2000 a year.  For a long time I was stupid; I lived off my credit cards through 3/4 of my college career. Oh, and I didn't pay them on time (or at all, I was too busy getting drunk and buying stuff that I really didn't need). So I have paid them all off, but they are still there, haunting me from three years ago. Hopefully, by the time I am 57 I will be able to qualify for a remotely decent 1st home owner's loan.  Using your credit rating to determine whether or not you can be insured is rediculous. As long as you pay, you should recieve the coverage. These companies are not extending me credit, they are providing a service and they should treat the consumer as such.  And no, I didn't save 15% or more by switching to Geico.  ~IN~

      So how much alcohol can one person drink. After many years of research, I have finally answered this riddle that has plagued man-kind since the dawn of time...  I have this friend that can out drink anyone. I say this now, and everyone has a friend like this, but he can seriously out drink any person who ever drank a beer. A few days ago, he answered the question. While watching the season finale of The Sopranos, he drank 25 Miller Lite cans and half a bottle of Sambuca. This was before he went out. He blacked out on the ride to the bars, and proceeded to run up a $400 tab (at the bar he works at), all shooters, all on himself.  Well that's all I've got for now. Basically, cause I suck.

      Andy Kaufman, my name sake. Ok, simply the man passed away in 1984. Some guy has created a blog for Andy Kaufman, pretending that he is Andy Kaufman. This guy even released a press-release saying that "his" death was faked, and that he wouldn't be held liable for faking his own death due to the 7 year statute of limitations. He is dead, it is sad, he is not here anymore... except in spirit.  It didn't help things at all with the fact that Lynn Marguilies (Andy's girlfriend) and Bob Zmuda (Andy's friend/writer) took out a full page ad in one of the New York newspapers, asking Andy to make good on his promise, to come out of hiding. Andy made this promise 20 years ago last week.  Enough about that Andy. Here's more about this Andy.  -I don't like money. I have a little. I could use more.  -Still don't like the changes that they made to TechTV. Excuse me G4TechTV. They have this show called 'pulse,' which is a show on the like of World News Tonight meets Entertainment Tonight meets Romper Room. Its crap. I like the games that I begin to play and never finish. I don't need to know what the number one selling game at EB games is this week. If I cared that much, I would ask someone. But I still like The Screen Savers, Unscrewed, and X-Play.   I promise that I will stop complaining about G4 media once I find a redeeming non-TechTV programming. But until then... who knows.  I.n.

      So here is a little something to ponder...  They have wireless ethernet setups, so why not wireless cable...? Since cable is really just an RF signal transmitted via copper, why not compress the bandwidth and do it wirelessly? Oh because the FCC controls the necessary frequencies. So why don't they make wireless internet signal broadcast on UHF (yes, just like the movie) and free up some bandwidth, AND GIVE ME CABLE IN MY BEDROOM!  Oh, I posted my complaints about G4TechTV, and said eluded to the fact that they were owned by AOL-Time Warner. Oops. My bad. They are actually owned by Comcast. Same idea, different taco stand. It's not like anyone from Comcast, or AOL-Time Warner, or G4TechTv will be reading this anyway; hell I would be happy if even one person reads this. However, I do love their improved cable/data speed. Now if only On-Demand worked right... Oh well, one step at a time, right?  --I.N.  FYI - Some people think that I am a little too sarcastic sometime, my bad. I blame TV. Glorious TV. And Nintendo. Always remember Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, right?

      I like acronyms. No seriously, they are cool little trivets that have sort-of fallen out of the English language (God, I sounded smart there). Here are some classics: - LOL - laughing out loud - ROFL - rolling on the floor laughing - BRB - be right back - OMG - Oh my god - IJSM - I just shit myself - PC911 - please call 911 - DEBWURG2BBCUMBS - don't eat bananas while you are going to Best Buy 'cause you might be shot.  Alright enough already. I think people are taking this to far. At work, one of my servers constantly says 'brb.' This whole thing has gone way too far. If you need to shave 1/2 a second off of a conversation in REALITY, you probably shouldn't have started the conversation anyway.   ---More Drivel---  Ok, so I am a pathetic attempt at a "nerd;" I never finish video games, I break all of those expensive toys I buy, but this blog is something I am actually going to attempt to do on the regular. I like to write. I've been writing a book for some time now.  What can I say, other than I am the embodiment of industrial nothing.  --The Final Complaint--  Don't like g4TechTv. Don't like it one bit. Question 1 - What in the hell does the old 1960's show 'The Thunderbirds' have to do with anything Tech? Watching that show makes me wish I my retinas would finally burn in. Question 2 - How many shows about video games can you actually have before they start getting repeatitive? Answer - About 1. X-Play is great, lose the other crap (however, g4tv.com isn't that bad, just lose the guy host). Question 3 - Why mess with a good thing? Answer - Because if they don't mess with their own format - AOL-TIME WARNER WILL. (they make Microsoft look like Disney, oh wait...)  I.N.
