      hay! this is life! saturday and i'm here doing nothing... just bumming around! yahoo! i already have this chatter box. i find it in a lot of my friends' blog so might as well try i out. it's cute... i was also trying to get some of the trivia scripts from the same site but it wouldn't fit in my site haha...  can't sleep last night. i felt sleepy at around 3am! grabe... and so i woke up at 12pm na. had this weird dream. my family and i were somewhere for a trip... thailand, i think? but there were a lot of hassles... so it ended up like an adventure or challenge instead of a vacation. i get this from watching too many reality based shows! the acoustic contest last night at the office was really cool... why? 'cause we won first place!!! the songs were really nice: night bird and reminiscin'. i heard they're off from the 70's. nice songs! very relaxing! the other teams thought they were cheated haha! can we help it if our unit's that good? haha! well, off to do some more bummin'... later!

      how dare you? why tell me these things when i'm struggling to move on? why hit me at a point when i'm still weak? WHYYYYY?!?!? haha nag wild daw (with matching tears sa corner ng mata while hugging pillow). oa na naman! funny i could joke about it... it means i'm somehow over it! yahoo! ya i'm over the break-up event but it doesn't mean i don't feel anything for him anymore... despite all that has happened and all that he's done! i wish i were numb (ok be careful what you wish for, caths... baka ma-paralyze!). i hate blog i'm putting myself in a very vulnerable spot! waaah! in fairness, the last time i cried was on my birthday... just because somebody told me "stop thinking about him... ang payat mo na"... haha and then i cried and thought... do i look horrible na?  plus he's acting like there's nothing wrong... as if i'm his pa! bakeeet?!?! i'm annoyed and at the same time, i find it... what's the word? comforting? to hear from him... even if he brings bad news... or does he? waaaah! stop me!

       what's with this day? i'm so sleeeepyyyy... i've been sleepy since i woke up this morning haha! =)... we have a yawning contest here in the work area. the one with the loudest and most number of yawns will get a... ummm nothing.. you just have the loudest and most number of yawns haha!  maybe it's with the work load haha! i'm not that idle today... haha that's what's making me sleepy!   i don't know what's in a mcfloat either. it just lifts me up when i have one. mmm sarap talga nun! it's a natural mood lifter... not that i have a bad mood today. i just feel very ummm... elated(?) when i have a mcfloat... yum! maybe it's how i sort of spoon the ice cream and chocolate syrup using the straw... yum yum! or how i "piggily" sip the cola+ice cream... and how the ice cream mixes with the cola and it just tastes super uniquely sarap... hmm! and then when you're done with the feast, you wipe-off all traces by crunching on what's left of the ice cubes! yum yum! i didn't finish the ice cubes. 1 hour break's up. =(  had buffalo chicken and mcfloat for lunch. plus jollibee crispy fries. we noticed it tastes a lot like mcdo fries... hmmm weird! then for merienda, i ate my baon for lunch... all those stuff are in my tummy now? no wonder it swells haha the term... swells!  leaving by 6. am off to dine out with my mom and kuya and wawin tonight in seaside chuva somewhere in baclaran. i heard the food there's good! waaaah! more food? no more space!  i'm still sleepy though... gotta go!

        dined out at big budha last night with downa, maricor, harbs. an embarrassing thing came up. the good-hearted girls insisted that we order this braised birthday noodles because it was my birthday... i would have been more discreet and have the crispy noodles instead... haha!   donna:  "isang lemon chicken chuva, yang chow rice, dumpling special chuva, and braised birthday noodles. kasi bday nya" (and pointed at me).  waiter:  "ganun po ba? happy bday ma'm!" *duh! as if i care      and i'll never go back to that resto again... ever! ok! haha so much for a peaceful night! it turned out that the bday noodles dish is composed of, as maricor termed it, pisngi ng tao, gulaman, and we argued for hours if the orange stuff were cheese balls, tukneneng, or kwek kwek. haha... but the food's ok! i had 3 glasses of iced tea and about 124 trips to the rest room.  jimmy and thyra were also there to umm grace the event haha... jimmy has a new hairdo! it's unique! we all talked and laughed til 10? and had some pics taken... hope i could also post those here soon.  oh they also gave me this book!  boy meets girl ... a most unusual choice of book especially since i think it's more applicable for engaged people? haha! i think they were looking for the "part 1" of the book -  i kissed dating goodbye . the gels know i'm dying to have a copy of the book but i guess the bookstore ran out of copies so they just bought the book-for-more-advanced-phase-of-relationship book. i started reading it last night. it's so enlightening it made me smile =). even for my case haha... i thought that i could use those lessons  in the near future . thanks, you guys! you're the sweetest! thanks for sharing my birthday noodles with me =).

      i found this lessons learned list in one of my old notebooks and decided to post them here (right side of this page). i'll probably update the list whenever i learn something new (either the hard or easy way). =) i acquired these thoughts from my own experiences and some are merely observations from my friends' experiences. some would probably raise eyebrows and totally disagree with my thoughts haha! these seem a little pessimistic and what? bitter? haha! ya agree with me for now! this will pass... some items may be overridden with new lessons... i'll not erase items if they're proven wrong in time... i'll simply add the new ones. i would like to see some good transition in my thoughts through this list... in time =)

      eeew! my hair's straight again! had it done last night and my officemate, char, went with me. thanks, char! it feels odd and my scalp hurts until now. it's burning i guess?  after the parlor chuva, i went out to see mau and riche. it was really an overly impromptu gimmick; just ate at kroc-where the crowd is wild and you could probably get a heart attack if it's your bday. geez! the waiters there practically shout at you like they're mad at you when they sing the bday song! people could die there! plus i had a sore throat just trying to make conversation with mau and riche... kids today are sooo kid-like! then we had coffee at seattle's. hmmm the coffee's good! i had this hot coffee with raspberry something. dale-icious! er i mean delicious! finally we got to talk in a more peaceful manner. talked about the same old break-up (mine and riche's hehe) stuff. sometimes i get tired of it. sometimes i can't get enough of it. but certainly, it felt good! my ride home (and going to makati) was the embarrassing part. mau and marlon and marlon's friends, sorry ulit sorry sorry talga! hehe! it was a good night. it was nice getting in touch with old friends (ya literally old-we're 24+ na)... got home by 2am and the coffee got to my nerves! was up all night palpitating and just awake! grabe! or maybe i was just thinking about something else? dunno! and i don't care... haha! it was a good night...

       it's 7pm and i'm still here working overtime.   it's ok at least i'm paid overtime!  =)  that would mean a little bit more of something to pay for bills, bills, and more bills... they just keep on coming!   i'm in the middle of my offset season and i'll be rendering more offset hours for the next couple of days. i practically spend 3/4 of my life here...  it's ok at lest i'm paid overtime! =)    i should've been home watching tv patrol (how exciting).  i should've been home eating dinner with my loving and understanding and sympathetic mom... i should've been home bumming around staring at my bedroom ceiling, where the glow-in-the-dark-stars-and-planet-chuva-gift-from-him are stuck. ooops reminder alert! i should burn those! joke... am not that monstrous and rude (i know someone who is... joke!). instead i'm here in my   loyal and faithful   desk...  it's ok at least i'm paid overtime! =)  hey that's not that bad! i have all the motivation i need!?! what?  paid overtime ? haha! how deep does that sound?      i read: don't regress. don't live in the past.  that sounds like a better motivation =) one step at a time =)

      hey! this is new. and what's new is always exciting. found out about this blog thing from my college friends. maybe others will read this, maybe not. but this is good! had an exam earlier in PAL. grabe! it was so hard! it was a java exam and i don't do java! hehe. that's new! and exciting! what else is new? being single again! that's not really exciting but maybe i could make it exciting in a few months or days =). i'm not really bad in moving on and making myself happy but 4 yrs is not like 4 minutes and it's quite a lot if taken away from you. every now and then there's just something there to remind you of what used to be.  ok enough of that.  that's the past. i'm supposed to talk about the new stuff. =) can't wait to wander into the brand new world! it's weird that this world has always been here... i was just blinded by some superficial happiness(?)... hello brand new world!
