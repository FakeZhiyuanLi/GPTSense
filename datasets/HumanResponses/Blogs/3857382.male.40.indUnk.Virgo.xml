      Professor Bainbridge has two distinct posts.  The first is about the recent crop of  urlLink new Catholic priests  who are more in line with the orthodoxy of JPII than their 60s/70s counterparts (Thank God!).  The second post brings up a very touchy topic ---  urlLink corks !  More specifically, should wineries start using screw caps on the bottles, or should they continue with corks.  The Prof is starting to lean towards the former.  I'm a purest, and a stickler for tradition and romance.  The corks must remain!  It's just not the same without 'em.  MSNBC's web site has quite a few articles on this topic in their  urlLink Wine Section .

      I find it curious that Hollywood remakes a film about Chinese ("Manchurian") communists infiltrating the American political system during the height of the Cold War.   And this remake apparently doesn't even have a single Manchurian in sight?   Given that we're in a post-9/11 era, you’d think the most logical (and believable) contemporary up-take would be Al Qaida/Islamic Extremists surrepticiously making it’s way up the U.S.’s political chain of command.  But  noooooooooooooooooo .  It’s those "evil" and greedy U.S. corporations that covertly inject themselves into the head of the Vice Presidential candidate (read: Richard Cheney).  Funny, but wasn’t he also to blame for the global warming freeze-over  (a nonsequitor, I know)  in "The Day After Tommorow?"  Didn’t they even have a Cheney look-alike actor in that roll?  Our current VP sure does get around.  Why, he must be Satan himself, I guess.  Who’d a thunk it?!  "Evil" Democracy is to be blamed for everything, with "Evil" Capitalism at it’s heart.  But... wait... isn’t it that same “Evil” Capitalism run by those "Evil" Corporations that’s paying the salary to all those enlightened thespians?  And isn’t it that "Evil" Democracy that’s giving them the Freedom to display their vacuous inanity on the silver screen for all to see?   *sigh* …whatever…

      This is a WCC review:  I admit that I had no interest in seeing this film when it hit the theaters.  And I was reluctant to rent it when it came out on DVD.   "Reservior Dogs"  is waaaay overrated.   "Pulp Fiction"  was a unique and clever breakthough film, although it's extremely tough to handle in spots.   "Jackie Brown"  was cool, but underwhelming, and showed QT's hand that he might be stuck in a rut.  With  "Kill Bill: Vol.1"  he's just rehashing old tricks... and it's boring.  It's a smorgasbord of film styles: green-tinted late-60s/early-70s B-flicks; martial arts B-flicks of the same era; Japanese anime; slasher horror movies of the 80s/90s; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Matrix"-type highwire action sequences; the absurdly comical  "Monty Python's Holy Grail"  (though not intended to be comical); and the no-longer-oh-so-cool non-linear plot pointing.  It's got some moments, but Quentin is too full of himself to realize that he hasn't really done anything new and different.  It's nothing more than sloppy stew leftovers.  2 wine bottles out of 5.  Drink it only if you are a serious Tarantino devotee.

      What a frelling idiot!  Not even a full 24 hours had passed since he delivered his acceptance speech at the DNC, and Kerry actually made a public statement that Osama Bin Ladin (if caught) should be tried in the U.S. courts.  If you even think that this is an appropriate and effective course of action, read  urlLink this .... please .

      Malkin has the latest  urlLink (Part 14) .  Another passenger on the Northwestern plane chimes in on that frightening flight, comfirming the situation as reported by Jacobsen.  Also, the Syrian Ambassador cried "racists" with regards to this whole story, claiming that the Syrian band  "performed in the past six months in places such as the Kennedy Center, the Lincoln Center and the Juilliard School."   He then had to admit that it's  not those  14 musicians who've performed at those locations,  "but that other Syrian musicians had."

      This is sure to become a growing story.  I’d be interesting to see if  “60 Minutes”  ever does a segment on this subject (I'm not holding my breath).    urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  was launched on May 4, 2004 at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington. As of May 17, 220 of the 229 Swift boat veterans contacted by the group have agreed to sign an open letter to Senator John F. Kerry that challenges his fitness to serve as America's Commander-in-Chief. Signers of the letter include the entire chain of command above Lt. John Kerry in Vietnam: Lt. Commander Grant Hibbard, Lt. Commander George Elliott, Captain Charles Plumly, Captain Adrian Lonsdale USCG, and Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman.    The book  urlLink Unfit For Command  by John O’Neil (due to be released very soon) will chronicle John Kerry’s four-month tour of duty in ‘Nam.  Sure to be an eye opener.  The two web sites related to this whole story are  urlLink here  &  urlLink here .

      Michael Moore was at his bombastically bloated best at the Democratic Presidential Convention this week.  And they loved him (no surprise).  Take a few Tums before reading the  urlLink entire text  of his speech.  (Hat-tip to Hugh Hewitt)     I was almost certain that Howard Dean would’ve become their 2004 equivalent of Pat Buchanan (remember the '92 Republican Convention?).  Well, the Kerry campaign was able to reign in Dean.  So, Moore took the crown instead.  All Hail Michael Moore - the Prince of Propaganda.  He is the "Pat Buchanan of ’04."   Come November 3rd, I’m sure many Democrats will bemoan this fact (if they aren’t doing so already).  Do us all a favor.  Read  urlLink this book .  In fact, buy the book and give it to everyone you know who saw and believed that agitprop drivel called F911.

       urlLink James Lileks  has a daily blog that is well-respected and widely read.  I’ve tried to “get into” his stuff, and it’s taken a while to properly absorb it.  Maybe it’s the '50s throwback layout that (for some reason) is a bit off-putting.  Well, I must say that yesterday’s entry  urlLink here  in response to his interactions with Regis Le Sommier (American Bureau Chief of  Paris Match , a French magazine) at the Democratic Presidential Convention is without doubt an excellent example of some fine writing on the subject of French complicity and prevarication.  He provides a few links (which will link to more links) which  must  all be followed in order to fully grasp the totality of the background of Le Sommier, Paris Match magazine, and France’s perpetually soiled hands with regards to Iraq.  Prepare to have your browser program ready for multiple tabs or windows.  It’s a long read through all of the links, but well worth it!  When you’re done, I’d suggest you then go buy  urlLink The French Betrayal of America  by Kenneth Timmerman.

      Malkin comments and links to two stories.  In the  urlLink first story  reports of a possible sniper/terrorist nabbed in Iowa by a state tropper after a routine traffic stop. The contents found in his car is frightening.  Brings back memories of the DC snipers case from a couple years ago.  The  urlLink second story  brings to light a potentially deadly situation where terrorists may be crossing the Mexican border into Texas.  This has been a growing story that may soon break in the mainstream media.

      Malkin has  urlLink Post 12  here, in which it's discovered that Nour Mehana (the Syrian "Wayne Newton" who's the singer of the 14-piece band on NW Flight#327) has a song on his recent CD entitled "Mother of a Martyr" - a song consoling the mother of a Palestinian "martyr."  She links to a report  urlLink here  that details the lyrics of the song.  Now, I'm a lyricist (or at least I was one for quite a number of years, hence my monicker).  Although I am critical of bad literary works, lame/laze art and propagandist drivel, I'm sensitive to censorship issues - especially when brought forward by overly aggressive & wild-eyed, desk-pounding interpretors.  A number of years ago I was gathering petition signatures behind Frank Zappa, who was doing a bang-up job metaphorically poking his guitar pick in the eyes of Al & Tipper Gore.  But, it gives one pause when you take the totality of this  "Syrian casino band on Flight#327"  story, and then find that one of their song lyrics praises the actions of suicide/homicide bombers. The song, in and of itself, doesn't mean anything.  Heck, it's no secret that a large percentage of Middle Easterners would like to push Israel into the Mediterranean Sea.  But, in this volatile era of war against terrorists & militant extremists, a heighten state of awareness may be warranted.  Especially when 14 Syrian crooners with expired visas are acting strangely on a flight across America.

      Hat-tip to  urlLink Redstate.org  for a great little link about  urlLink President GWB .  Nicely stated!  Also,  urlLink Captain's Quarters  (one of my regular reads) is in rare form today.  They comment as well as link to the  urlLink Teresa Heinz Kerry   story where she gives a blanket statement about certain unnamed opponents being uncivil and un-American.  Then she immediately denies what she said, and goes about being completely uncivil herself in her forceful denial (and all on video, too).  Classic!  The Capt.Q also point to an article about the so-called  urlLink "non-biased"  reporting by the mainstream media outlets (ABC, NBC, CBS, NY Times, LA Times and Wash. Post) in regards to their coverage of the consummate liar, Joe Wilson.  The evidence of their blatant bias is damning.  But, of course, that ain't gonna change anything.  Bernard Goldberg had it right in his book,  urlLink "Bias."    He paid a heavy price for admitting it, too.  But, he's all the better for it.

      This is a WCC review:  This wonderful independent film (shot on Super-16mm) is like a slow moving freight train, riding the twin rails of loneliness and aloneness.  It is NOT a depressing film, despite what my first sentence might lead you to believe.  Quite the contrary, it delves into the lives of three individuals who (due to unique circumstances) are struggling with their current states of aloneness.  Finbar is a quiet gentleman.  One of ill-suited stature in a one-size-fits-all-but-you world.  The loss of his friend suddenly jolts his passive passion for trains into motion.  In his new environment (a rundown train station in a Jersey backwater town), Fin is forced to interact with Joe - a lonely puppydog of a guy who's couped up in his ailing father's coffee truck (conveniently parked right outside Fin's new digs).  Olivia (a regular customer of Joe's) is a recently separated wife and a struggling artist who's own disheveled loneliness was trust upon her by a tragic event.  All three of these people are isolated from the world, and not by choice.  But, with Joe's incessant promptings, the three are forced to interact with each other and with others.  And they all end up the better for it, though not without experiencing some necessary growing pains.  The film's pacing (via Fin's point of view) is both deliberate and contemplative.  Any faster and you’d miss the nuances of each character’s personal cross in life.  Any slower and the film would stop dead in it’s tracks.  This film will have you laughing hysterically one moment, and take you to the verge of tears the next.  WCC-Trub gives this "little-film-that-could" 4 wine bottles out of 5.  Maybe even 4-&-1/2.

      Another brief EC review by proxy from Vic:   Just an "ok" movie. Surprise ending, BUT IT DROVE ME CRAZY!! I started to become nuts myself.  ECC-Vic gives this flick 2-&-1/2 wine bottles out of 5.   This is another film I rented a few months ago.  I thought the film was very clever, and the ending had a very good payoff.  If you liked films such as "House of Games" and "The Usual Suspects" then this movie is right up your alley.  I thought Nick Cage gave a great performance (as usual).  WCC-Trub gives a slightly better rating of 3-&-1/2 wine bottles out of 5.

      By proxy, this brief review is by Vic the "East Coast" critic:   Not a bad movie, but there was very little character developement. It was made to attract women viewers, I know, but I thought it could of been a better movie.  ECC-Vic gives this flick 2-&-1/2 wine bottles out of 5.   I (the "West Coast" critic) rented this movie a few months ago.  It's a "chick flick," but it seemed to try too hard to be that genre.  I thought Diane Lane's character was a little too over-the-top ditsy, and the plot was a bit far-fetched.  This movie was based on the book of the same name.  I have not read the book, though I do know that it was a big seller.  Word of warning to those who've read and loved the book --- the ending's completely different.  WCC-Trub also gives this flick 2-&-1/2 wine bottles out of 5.

      Got woken up this morning by my first "official" earthquake.  It happened around 5:55; a  4.3 quake  that was centered 4.7-miles SSE of Carpenteria.  A sharp and persistent jolt that lasted for about a minute or so.  After living in California for almost 10 years, I have now been officially "baptized" a true Californian!  I feel so honored.  Now, I  have  experienced the occasional tremor in the past.  But this was different.  My first experience (apparently) occurred in the summer of '89 - two months before the "big one" that hit San Francisco.  I was in SF at the time on my first vacation to California.  A friend and I were spending nine days up and down the CA coast, and we weren't even a full two days into our trip when a pre-cursor quake broached the mid-night calm while we slept in the hotel room.  Problem is, I didn't remember a darn thing (hence the "apparently").  My friend, meanwhile, was shaken out of bed, freaked out, and yelled, "what's happening?"  He later told me (begrudgingly) that I calmly turned in bed and said, "It's just an earthquake.  No big deal," and went right back to sleep.  I don't know why, but my friend was not comforted by this.  But, since I don't remember experiencing that quake... well, that just doesn't quite count.  A few months ago there was a 6.5 that hit the Paso Robles area on the Central Coast.  I was working near the San Fernando Valley area at the time, and only felt a slight queaziness in my stomach as my computer monitor swayed ever-so-slightly left to right.  Nope!  Too far away to have any real effect.  That didn't count either.  And anything under a 3.0 ain't even worth mentioning.  I've had cars and trucks driving over my parking lot's speedbump outside my bedroom window that cause more rumbles than a so-called "2.4 tremor."  So, this morning... finally... something strong enough and close enough to initiate me into legitimate California citizenship.  I shall accept it with pride!

      Malkin continues her updates on the "Terror in the Skies" report  urlLink here (Part 8) .  The related article which she references is found  urlLink here .  It looks like they  were  a Syrian band that did play at the casino.  Annie Jacobsen was on CNN last night, interviewed by Aaron Brown.  She's still convinced that, although they may have been musicians, their behavior was too suspicious throughout that flight, and that it may still have been a dry run or a "probe."  Given all of the information that's come out so far from many sources regarding this incident (as well as testimony from other airline employees regarding their own experiences over the last few years), I'm leaning towards that opinion as well.  I urge everyone over these next several months to be cautious, diligent and observant (while remaining calm, cool and collected).   Update:  Michelle has yet more information on this growing investigation.  urlLink (Part 9)  It appears that  ALL 14  of the Syrian band musicians had  expired  visas!  (*sigh*)

"Say! I HAVE the docs! I do! I do have those docs!  I took them," said Sandy Pants! “This WILL alter votes! And I WILL be Bill’s scapegoat. And I WILL go to jail in shame for playing this political shell game. And I DID lie. I’ll have to plea to docs in socks.  Oh my, oh me!  I am the fox who took the docs from the box with secrets here so plain to see!  You see?  I did so stuff these docs in socks.  I did so stuff them here and there.

      So... if it was Condi Rice (the current NSA to Bush) who admitted to "inadvertently" taking highly classified 9/11-related documents and stuffing them in her slacks and pantyhose, how do  YOU  think the mainstream national media would be covering this story?   Hmmmmmmm???   Berger's also an advisor to the Kerry campaign... uhhhhh... he  was , that is, until Kerry dumped him faster than you can say  "Edwards bump?  What Edwards bump?"   And another thing...   WHY  does every political scandal have to end with "-gate" (as in "Watergate")?  Watergate was/is the name of the hotel where the Nixon scandal took place.  There is no "gate" anywhere!  Nor should that word be attached to every frelling scandal that comes out of DC.  It's lazy journalism.  Unimaginative, to say the least.  We must come up with original names for each scandal that crops up.  Any ideas for properly naming  this one ?  I'm open to suggestions.  (heh-heh-heh)

       urlLink Michelle Malkin  has been doing a bang-up job of following these two stories by Annie Jacobsen  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  I strongly suggest that you start with Jacobsen's first report, then read through all of Michelle's updates and analysis (starting at her July 15th entries, then moving forward from there to the present) before reading Jacobsen's second report.  I also suggest you follow various blogosphere reports for various takes on subject, and the related larger issue of airline and national security.  Also, keep your eyes & ears open to mainstream media reports on this incident within the next few days.  Although I do believe that Mineta's "politically correct" screening policies are ridiculous, here are a few things to keep in mind:  1) Yes, there are non-Middle Easterners (men & women) who are sympathetic to the terrorists cause and who can easily be recruited,  2) People can be used as unwitting "mules" to either carry items or to help carry out plots,  (These two points alone let's you know why Middle Eastern men in their 20s & 30s aren't the only people who should be screened at airports, etc.)  3) It is possible that some of these "suspicious" people may very well be U.S. Agents or Marshalls keeping an eye on things,  4) If a "suspicious" person ends up having a clean background check, and is not carrying anything suspicious, what else can be done other than to keep an eye on his/her future activities?  I'm sure the Feds are doing just that!  Much more can and should be done by HSD & FAA in order to protect the homeland.  In the meantime, keep your wits about you when you fly, especially on long distance flights.  Remember, airplane seats are flotation devices that make great "sheilds."  Also, let the Marshalls and Flight Crew do their jobs, but if you are called upon to assist - "the pen is mightier than the sword" (aim for the eyes or throat).  Hat-tip to  urlLink USS Clueless .  Be safe, people!

      I just received an unexpected package from my  older  brother, Ray (aka, Vic the East Coast Film Critic).  At first, I thought it might've been a gag gift (heck, my birthday isn't for a couple months).  But, sometimes siblings will do the pleasantly unexpected.  So, I opened the package in anticipation.  Well, he must've read my July 11th post entitled  "Fragrances & Memories" ... because I'm staring, teary-eyed at an old 8x10 framed photograph of us five siblings... at the beach... Atlantic City... 1965.  I'm not quite 2-years-old in the pic (with  proof , I tell yah,  proof  that I once had blonde hair).  I'm surrounded by my four brothers & sisters; all of us in bathing suits, dripping wet, tanned & smiling... sitting on that infamous inflatable raft at the edge of the Atlantic.    THANX, RAY!   I needed that.   EERIE UPDATE:  My  "Fragrances & Memories"  entry was dated July 11th.  But, my brother's package was postmarked  July 6th !  That is just freakin' me out.

      How about a  Balanced Budget Amendent  (like 40+ of the States have in their own Constitutions)?  One that includes:    1) A requirement that  Spending  increases by  no more  than the increase in the  rate of inflation  plus the increase in  population , on a year-by-year basis,    2) A  two-thirds majority in both houses  of Congress in order to increase  Spending  above that rate, good for only  one year ,    3) A  two-thirds majority  in both houses of Congress in order to increase  Taxes , good for only  one year ,    4)  One half  of all yearly surpluses automatically goes toward  Nation Debt relief , the other half being  returned to Taxpayers ,    5) A  Presidential Line-Item-Veto  (as 40+ States already have in their own Constitutions), with a  two-thirds majority in both houses  of Congress in order to override the veto.    6) A  Ban  on all  non-germain, rider amendments  to Congressional legislative bills.      Speaking of Taxes... How about a  Constitutional Amendment to Repeal the 16th Amendment , thereby  ending the Income Tax  and the I.R.S. in one fell swoop.  We can then go back to collecting Federal revenues  the way our Founding Fathers intended .      How about a Constitutional Amendment to  Limit Terms  for both offices of  Congress  (just as there already is an Amendment to limit the terms for President - Two Terms. 8 years, 10 years maximum):    1)  Two Terms  for U.S. Senate ( 12 years.  15 years maximum  due to vacancy appointments),    2)  Six Terms  for U.S. House of Representatives ( 12 years.  13 years maximum  due to vacancy appointments).      How about a Constitutional Amendment to put appropriate  Checks &amp; Balances  on the  Federal Courts , including the U.S. Supreme Court to limit Judicial Activism and instill  Judicial Restraint  when the Courts overstep their bounds into legislative and executive realms:    1) This could include instituting  Judical Term Limits to 20 years  or a  Mandatory Retirement Age of 75  (whichever comes first).      Just a little food for thought.

      I'm all ablush. In a post by the  urlLink Evangelical Outpost  on the influence of Hugh Hewitt, this fledgling blog of mine was mentioned as the 50th Hewitt-inspired blog. Certainly didn't expect  that .  Thanx guys!!!  Partial Quote:  "...After reading In, But Not Of I was emboldened to start a blog of my own. It didn’t take me long to find other bloggers who had been similarly encouraged so I created a tribute site, Hewitt Inspired Blogs, to recognize this community. With the addition of  Arbiter of Common Sense , the site now lists fifty blogs that were started because of Hugh’s suggestion. A small platoon of bloggers labors away because of the influence of this one man. Imagine how we could impact our culture and the world if each of these fifty were to inspire others in kind.   Visit the HHI blog and scan the list. If you read or appreciate any of the blogs listed send Hugh a note of thanks. Without his impact and encouragement, the blogosphere would be a veritable Pottersville..."   Click the above link to read the full story! And check out the HHI link in my sidebar for a full list of "The 50"-----> In fact, check out  ALL  those links in my sidebar.  They all make for great reading.

      This week’s West Coast Film Critic DVD Recommendation is.....  “Big Fish”   A Tim Burton film ( Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Nightmare Before Christmas, etc. ) filled with the quirky and the fantastical, unfolding his recent vision as no one else can.  Steeped with parables, allegories and metaphors, the film carries with it a poignant story about the strained relationship and unique bond between father and son.  Deep within the film is a larger message about reconciling with those you love, with the past, and with yourself.  The DVD includes several extra vignettes that delve into the making of the film, the development of the characters, and the nature of understanding the improbable.  This critic gives “Big Fish”... 4 wine bottles out of 5.  It’s definitely worth a sip.

      Now here's a telling quote from the former Soviet Bloc:   "We were used to such messages in the communist days. Everybody has open eyes and can understand that this is propaganda. It was a weak film that tells us nothing new."  -- VACLAV KLAUS, president of the Czech Republic, after watching the MICHAEL MOORE documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11."         urlLink link

      The extended stay of the "June Gloom" has finally evaporated.  It's the typical weather we get along the southern California coast... a thick marine layer that blankets the coastal cities, and hangs around for much of the day until the sun finally decides to burn it off.  It was a bit persistent this year.  But, this weekend, it has faded.  It lingers just off the coast, yet keeps a respectful distance.  It was an opportune time to head to the beach and get some color in my cheeks (even if only for a few minutes).  I flopped on a hat, flipped a couple towels over my shoulder, gripped my faded copy of St. Augustine's  Confessions  (I'm halfway thru it, and am determined to finish it... eventually), grabbed a bottle of cool water, and headed to the harbor's coastline.  As I walked across the sand and climbed over a small dune, I smelled the salt air.  And in my next inhalation, there it was... subtle... in the distance... but it was there.  That unmistakable fragrance of... creosote!  Pine tar.  And in the blink of my eye I'm no longer 40 years old.  I'm 12... 10... eight years old.  And 3000 miles away, facing an opposite compass direction, viewing a completely different ocean.  Now, don't laugh.  Let me explain.  Creosote is used to preserve and protect the boardwalks & piers along the Jersey shore line.  It's necessary, and it's lathered on during the off-season.  But, during the summer, you can sometimes still smell it... subtle... sweet... yet pungent... and mixed with the salty sea air... and the Planter's Peanuts... and the popcorn... and the salt water taffy.  It's Atlantic City, before the casinos overtook the town.  It's the Steel Pier with it's diving horse and diving bell.  It's the Million Dollar Pier, not as a fancy outdoor mall but as a vast pine planked playground of games and rides and thrills and screams and laughter.  It's Margate... and Lucy The Elephant... and the long-forgotten Casablanca Motel.  It's buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken... and Gino Giants and Sirlioners.  It's rubber rafts... beach umbrellas... the wift of Coppertone... and bronzed skin.  It's family vacations... and temporarily forgotten worries.  It's that home away from home.  And it's memories of Mom, who went to the open arms of our Lord a little over two years ago.  "I miss you, Mom," I said to myself as I smiled, squinted at the sun, took another deep breath, and continued my brief trek across the sand.

      What the frell is the EC:WC FCA, you say???  It's the  East Coast:West Coast Film Critics Association .  My   older  (emphasis mine) brother, Ray, and I will have these occasional long distance phone chats, yammerin' about everything under the sun... from family, work, music, to the latest flick we've watched on DVD or in the theaters.  Ray remains on the East Coast while I've been out here in southern California for the last 10 years, and we've jokingly called ourselves the East Coast/West Coast Film Critics.  I figured this would be an appropriate place to post our musing about such films, from time to time.  Nothing too serious in our reviews... kind of a layman's take on what works and what doesn't work on the screen.  I'll make a posting, and he will attach a comment to the post.  So, whenever you see a post heading that beings with  "EC:WC FCA..."  then you know that a film review is in order.  I, Mike, (aka, Trubador/Trub) am your trusted West Coast Critic, and Ray (aka, Victor/Vic) is your trusted East Coast Critic.  As always, your comments are welcome.  Please remember, though, that I   am   the  Arbiter of Common Sense , so all reviews are final.  I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'.  Today's quote:  "Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." - Red Auerbach   And you thought he only coached basketball?

      Welcoming comments from strangers after only one day and one post?  Thanx, peeps!  This blog will be slow in the making, but patience  is  a virtue (so I'm told).  By request... I'll just reiterate what I e-mailed a friend a few weeks ago.  Come November 3rd, the election results will be as follows:   BUSH ---- 56% (35+ states) KERRY -- 42% (12 states... 15 max) NADER --  2%  And Republican gains in both the House & Senate   Tonight's ending quote:  "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enflames the great." - Bussy-Rabutin   A conservative quoting a Frenchman... will wonders never cease?  P.S.  Thanx to the "g" man!  (you know who you are)

      Greetings, all!  I'm (relatively) new to this world of blogdom.  I've been a regular follower of Hugh Hewitt, Captain's Quarters, Powerline, and quite a few others.  I plan to include my own little interjections in this space, as well as post my favorite links.  I'll be back soon... so be kind.  I shall end this first post with this thought:  "One cannot obtain objective reasoning from a foundation of subjective truth. For if truth is subjective (and therefore relative), then any reasoning that follows will also be subjective and relative. Only by facing, acknowledging and accepting the existence of objective truth can one even attempt to attain any semblance of objective reasoning."

      Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch (D) is  urlLink supporting BUSH !  The key quote:   "Now, for the first time in my life, I am going to vote for a Republican candidate for president, the incumbent, George W. Bush. I voted for Al Gore in 2000... With [Gore's] endorsement of Howard Dean in this year’s primary and his strident speeches calling President Bush a liar, Gore has certainly demonstrated that he has moved considerably to the left since his defeat.  Why have I endorsed George W. Bush when I don't agree with him on a single domestic issue?  Because I believe the issue of international terrorism trumps all other issues. I don't believe the Democratic Party has the stomach and commitment to deliver on this issue.   I believe terrorism will be with us for many years to come. So long as Senators Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd are considered major leaders of the Democratic Party, and so long as we have radical candidates like Howard Dean, whose radical-left supporters have been described by the press as "Deaniacs," the Democratic Party will be limited in its ability to serve the country well in times of crisis."

      A couple weeks ago at bible study  (yes, Catholics  do  study the bible)  we were discussing the up-coming Sunday readings.  The first reading was from  urlLink Ecclesiastes , in which it is stated that all things are vanity... meaningless... a chasing of the wind.  And it got me wondering about a specific "what if" type of question that you always hear.   "What if... you found out that you only have 24 hours left to live?  What would you do with those remaining hours of your life?"   It's a much more intriguing question than one might think.  Would you:  A)  Treat it as an opportunity to experience all of the phyical and material things (even the taboo) that you never had the chance to do up 'til then?  B)  Travel to a place you've always wanted to visit, but never had the time or opportunity to get to before?  C)  Apologizes to all those you have hurt or harmed in your past?  D)  Continue with your normal day-to-day things, because you'd be doing the work that God had called you to do?  E)  Spend the last day with loved ones?  F)  Spend the day devoting yourself to contemplation, prayer and communion with God?  G)  Helping the less fortunate, the injured, the sick?  H)  Would you be like Job, spending the time in anger, resentment, disillusionment, self-pity?  I)  Would you give away all of your possessions?  This is much more challenging than one would expect on the surface.  Each possible response opens up a whole discussion in and of itself.  In the end, the "Scripture Insight" from my bible study booklet lays it out in clear and unmistakeable terms:   "We cannot know the mind of God.  We cannot fathom the devine plan for the world.  We can only trust that God seeks us as surely as we seek God.  We must have faith that although the world is limited and imperfect, God is not.  Our experience forces us to depend on God alone for happiness, treasure, life itself.  Everything else is transient and illusory."

      Mark Shea, in quoting the great G. K. Chesterton, has made a wonderfully cogent and rational  urlLink posit  on the over-simplicity of atheism.  Mark ends with this:   "You can be a Christian and have numerous questions and doubts and mysteries. That's why Scripture is packed with "How long, O Lord?" and "Eli, Eli lama sabachthani?" and "Why do the wicked prosper?". Scripture is capacious enough to have a book of Job, and all sort of anomalous features which stick out (like the ghost of Samuel or the parable of the Unjust Steward). It lives in a large and mysterious universe that is open to the possibility [that] we don't understand everything.  But the gleaming machine of Rationalism cannot afford doubts or mystery. It claims, by a supremely funny act of vaulting pride, to have figured the universe out and to know for absolute certain What is Going On. And the cocky swagger of its representatives only adds to the hilarity--and the pathos--of it."   Well stated, Mark... well stated!

      The blogosphere has been ablaze with excellent research, investigation, analysis and commentary about John Kerry’s exploits while in Vietnam (including links to articles from  Boston Herald  in '79,  AP  in '92,  US News & World Report  in 2000,  Washington Post  in '03, the  Douglas Brinkley  biography of Kerry, the O'Neill book  Unfit For Command , the  US Senate Records  from a Kerry speech in '86, the  Michael Kranish/Boston Globe  situation, as well as sworn affidavits, comments, and coutercomments from various  Swift Boat Vets ).  The mainstream media is starting to dip it’s toes into this investigation (begrudgingly, I'm sure).  But, if you want to get caught up to speed with what’s going on, you have to link to these places (you'll have to dig back a bit for early stuff, but the most relevant posts are within the past few weeks):   urlLink Hugh Hewitt   urlLink Captain’s Quarters   urlLink Power Line   urlLink Just One Minute   urlLink Instapundit   urlLink Belmont Club   urlLink Roger L. Simon   urlLink Little Green Footballs   urlLink Mudville Gazette   urlLink Swift Vets   urlLink Winter Soldier   urlLink Vietnam Veterans Against Kerry   This whole issue is important for two reasons:  1) Kerry decided to make his 4-month tour of duty the centerpiece of his campaign.  2) Kerry, the ultra left, and the media have made President Bush’s four years in the TANG an issue, claiming he went AWOL and asking for all of his records (including dental records).  What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.  Meanwhile, what   should be   (and, during the final two months of this election cycle,   will be  ) the focus of this election will be  Kerry’s Senate record .  The  urlLink Washington Times has an excellent, balanced, detailed analysis of his voting record  (he’s a far-left Ted Kennedy liberal...  surprise, surprise ).

      So... with the story breaking about the  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans  TV ad hitting the airwaves, and the book  urlLink "Unfit for Command"  soon to be released, one must ask these important questions:   1) If a veteran (just by virtue of being a veteran) is to be considered a hero above reproach and who's accounts of past military events are never to be questioned (such as Kerry's and McCain's)...... don't these Swift Boat veterans  also  deserve to be treated with the same honor and dignity, and have their own accounts be unquestioned?  2) If one says that because these Swift Boat vets are attacking Kerry, they are automatically discounted and discredited...... shouldn't Kerry  also  be discredited because of his repeated public statements (including testifying before congress) in which he attacked his fellow veterans in 'Nam?  3) If these events are ancient history that have no bearing on current political issues for this campaign...... shouldn't that  also  be the case for President Bush's National Guard service?  4) If not, then shouldn't this information be investigated at least  as vigorously and as extensively  as Bush's record (dental records, etc...)?  5) If this ad is the dirtiest of dirty political tricks...... do you feel the same way about the NAACP's ad against Bush in 2000 regarding the Texas dragging murder case? Or MoveOn.org's ad comparing President Bush to Hitler? Or that blatantly manipulative and propagandist so-called documentary "Fahrenheit 911" by Michael Moore?  6) Shouldn't those people and their organizations  also  be verbally denounced, rejected and shunned by not just the media, but also  by Kerry & Edwards, their campaign, the entire Democrat party ... repeatedly?  7) What if these veterans are telling the truth (either in whole or in part)...... Shouldn't there be a proper investigation requiring full disclosure (including having Kerry release his military records) in order to determine the facts of the events in question (just as what was done with regard to President Bush's records)?  8) Wasn't the McCain-Feingold soft-money campaign finance reform bill supposed to clean-up and eliminate this type of third-party compaign ads? And why are most of these 527s funded from the left/liberal part of the political spectrum (most notably MoveOn.org which is funded by ultra-liberal, multi-billionaire George Soros)?  9) George Soros? Aren't all billionaires "evil" conservatives?  Just some things to consider, especially since Kerry put his military service in the forefront at the DNC convention  (remember the "reporting for duty" salute, etc.?) , while continuing to dismiss the honorable service of National Guardsmen.

      I'm desperately trying to find a news or blog story with a pic that caught another Kerry gaffe yesterday.  I saw it on the TV news last night.  John Kerry was on a boat somewhere. He went to the bow of the boat, and with a stupid grin on his face he spread out his arms  a la Leonardo DiCaprio  while the wind blew around his infamous head of hair.  Two points:  1)  That scene in the movie "Titanic" is where DiCapro's character yells out  "I'm king of the world!"   (Not exactly the type of sentiment I'm looking for in a President),   2)  The Titanic was a doomed ship that sunk due to it's own weight, it's poor design plans, and it's captain's reckless navigation.  (Says it all, doesn't it?)     UPDATE#1 :   (Oh, it just gets better and better.)   Apparently, the John/Johns didn't leave much of an impression with Greenberg, PA, lawyer Abby DeBlassio.  The presidential wannabees, with a media horde in tow,  urlLink crowded into her offices  for 90 minutes to escape the pouring rain.  Not only didn't they say "thank you" to her, they never even bothered to meet her. (Hat-tip to  urlLink Betsy's Page )   UPDATE#2 :   (...and better and better...)   John Kerry stated on the stump that they were about to go  "find some baby backs over there at Speed Queen Bar-B-Q and a double-dip vanilla at Leon's... And if I don't get there, I'm in trouble."   Problem is,  urlLink he never showed up  at either place! Oh, and they sell  spare ribs  at Speed Queen,  not baby backs . (Hat-tip to  urlLink Powerline )   P.S.  It shouldn't be this much fun for conservatives, really!

      Word is out that the Illinois Republican Party is down to two potential candidates to square off against Democrat up-start Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate seat after Jack Ryan stepped down from the Republican ticket.  And one of those potential candidates is  urlLink Alan Keyes .  HAH!  I'm not much for carpetbagger politicans (e.g., Hillary in NY), but it'd be well worth it just to see Alan verbally spank Mr. Obama in the debates.   UPDATE : The Illinois State Republican Party  urlLink officially asked  Alan Keyes to be their US Senate candidate.  Keyes says that it'll take him a few days to seriously consider the offer.   Oh, this should be fun if he accepts.

      Hugh Hewitt  urlLink quotes  the chilling article in the  urlLink New Yorker  magazine which examines with unnerving detail the depth and breadth of the global terror network.  Meanwhile, 13 suspected terrorists are  urlLink captured in London .  The  urlLink Indepundit  has further information about not only the capture of these 13, but also information about two more captured in Pakistan.  This is not a situation where once we kill or capture Osama Bin Ladin we can then just dust off our hands and smuggly claim victory.  This is going to be a long and difficult struggle, requiring many years of dogged determination by the U.S. leadership.  And I trust the current administration with leadership on this front far more than I do the John/John jokers who  urlLink "have a plan"  but don't want to tell anybody about it.

      Newsweek tried to float a poll that showed the John/John ticket getting a  4-point  bounce, post DNC Convention.  First off...  6-points  is average.  An 8- to 10-point bounce was expected.  The Newsweek poll's 4-point bounce is  urlLink "the smallest in the history of the NEWSWEEK poll."  (Hat-tip to  urlLink Captains Quarters  &  urlLink Powerline )  But wait... there's more.  This poll isn't based on likely voters, nor registered voters, nor even eligible voters.  It's based on the amorphously lame "adults."  Plus, the  urlLink sample breakdown  is:  38.5% Democrats, 31.5% Independents, and 30% Republicans.   Uhhhh.... I don't think so.   Yet, the new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows that  urlLink Kerry lost ground !  Bush gained in a 5-point swing in a poll that's based on likely voters.  So, that's not a 4-point bounce for Kerry, but  a 5-point bounce for Bush!   Add to this, the lame comment by Kerry that he  urlLink wants Bin Ladin tried in court .  His flimsy ship is sinking fast, and the swing voters are strapping on their life preservers and abandoning ship.  Meanwhile, the John/John ticket decided to have a "lite lunch" by stopping into a Wendy's.  Kerry goes up to four Marines who happened to be eating there, and well... you can read the results of  that  exchange  urlLink here .  Not only does Kerry  not  impress these fine soldiers, it now appears that the French Party candidates' "lite lunch" might only have been a cheap photo op  (surprise-surprise ).  The bus was already filled with a  urlLink $4000 gourmet spread  that included  "shrimp vandallo, grilled diver sea scallops, prosciutto, wrapped stuffed chicken, and steak salad."   It just speaks for itself, doesn't it?  Oh, and the Security Alert system went up a notch to Orange today for the financial districts of NYC, North Jersey and Washington DC.  Read more  urlLink here .  As Kerry stated at the Convention in his Thursday night acceptance speech,  "Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response."   (Ummmmm... no thanks, John.  I'll stick with the current Oval Office resident who's consistently been taking sober, sustained and calculated actions against our mortal enemies, rather than taking your instantaneous, reflexive, reactive, after-another-attack stance.  I feel much safer that way.)
