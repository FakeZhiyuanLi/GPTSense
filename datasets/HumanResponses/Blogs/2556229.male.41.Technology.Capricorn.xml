      Oh yeah merry xmas.... Christmas was great - the kids had fun.  They always do when we turn our conspicuous over consumption toward them.  I have a bad case of affluenza.

      Let's get this thing started - I'm getting ready to make some big changes and I thought it would be interesting to keep a running log of what is going, what I'm discussing with friends and what I think about what is going on in the world.

      Suppose I'm an undecided voter and want to hear the POTUS speak? And suppose I dare to wear an old Gore 2000 shirt to the event? Do you think I'll get the treatment of others who have dared to exercise their Constitutionally Guaranteed Right to Free Speech? What if we all showed up at bush speeches wearing "Lick Bush" shirts? What if I sign the allegiance form and show up in a Kerry shirt.... Hmmm. I live in New Hampshire, I think I might find out. Just some thoughts on something I read on Carpetbaggerreport today.  urlLink http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/002232.html

      John Kerry is going to kick some Dumbya ass over the next few months.  Bush and Cheney are pathetic.  God, and to think I used to be a Rethuglican.  Well since I shaved off the unibrow in Florida 2000 I'm seeing things much more clearly.  Good bye Dumbya, you redneck prick.

      They just can't keep from outing undercover agents. The bush admin is showing how poorly equpped they are to lead the War on Terrorism.  They, in an effort to bolster their claims that the threat level needed to be raised, outed an alqa'ida double agent. Stupid White Men.  How are we supposed to recruit doubleagents if they are thrown to the wolves for political expedincy?   urlLink http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/369733top08-06-2004::19:06reuters.html

      This is really starting to bug me.   They have lost two of these swiftees to the credibilty test and now one of the guys is bailing, from  urlLink Carpetbagger ..  Veteran retracts criticism of Kerry  Yesterday, reached at his home, Elliott said he regretted signing the affidavitand said he still thinks Kerry deserved the Silver Star.''I still don't think he shot the guy in the back," Elliott said. ''It was aterrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm theone in trouble here."Elliott said he was no under personal or political pressure to sign thestatement, but he did feel ''time pressure" from those involved in the book.''That's no excuse," Elliott said. ''I knew it was wrong . . . In a hurry Isigned it and faxed it back. That was a mistake." urlLink http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/08/06/veteran_retracts_criticism_of_kerry/   And the doctor is lying about treating Kerry.  Hack!The "doctor" who appears in the ad, Louis Letson, was not a crewmate of SenatorKerry's and was not the doctor who actually signed Senator Kerry's sick callsheet. In fact, another physician actually signed Senator Kerry's sick callsheet. Letson is not listed on any document as having treated Senator Kerryafter the December 2, 1968 firefight. Moreover, according to news accounts,Letson did not record his "memories" of that incident until after Senator Kerrybecame a candidate for President in 2003. urlLink http://humaneventsonline.com.edgesuite.net/unfit_pdf.html

      It looks like the  urlLink rethugs  have decided to run a black person against Barak Obama in Illinois. Alan Keyes is apparently being wooed by the Illinois GOP desperadoes to run against him. They are also considering homophobe and former bush administration Drug under-Czar Andrea Barthwell. Both are far right radicals and stand little chance. Barthwell has the very fresh stink of a work place discrimination lawsuit on her and Keyes, well how do you say... is a little over the edge or over the edge of Michael Moore's Portable mosh pit.  Go over to Josh Marshall's  urlLink TPM  to read about it

      Nick Confessore over at  urlLink TAPPED   put it very nicely. "If the GOP, and the president, had not spent the years since 9/11 casting anyone who opposed their policies as little shy of a terrorist-lover, the Democrats would not feel the need to so aggressively glorify John Kerry's military service, and might instead revert to a more subdued and salutary kind of respect for and interest in those who serve.

      Here is a very nice piece from DKos on  urlLink Bush and the Catholics . As Kos says, I too am a recovering Catholic.  Hi, My name is Ray and I'm a Catholic. Hi Ray!  Anyway... read it and understand how far off the mark the Rethuglican platform and the actions of Bush are from the beliefs and practices of the Catholic Church.  Remember that Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount that we are judged by our deeds not by our words.    Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.     This does not bode well for Bush. I hope he repents.

       urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Poll: Tepid Bounce for Kerry : "Kerry leads Bush as 'better qualified to be commander-in-chief,' by 52 percent to 44 percent. "  Now we're talking. If you read the internals of this poll Kerry is smoking Bush  ..and this little nugget from  urlLink DailyKos  speaks volumes about Shrub's support in the Cuban community.    One interesting observation -- my father-in-law, Cuban-American to the core, is itching to vote against Bush. He visited his family in Cuba every year, and is furious that anyone would try to separate him from his family.   Three months ago, Kerry was a "communist". Today, he's got my father-in-law's vote in crucial New Hampshire. And lots more votes just like it in Florida.   Awesome! My wife and I will be helping to take New Hampshire for Kerry also. Did you know that if all the other state go the same way they did in 2000 and NH goes for Kerry he wins. That's right! Count for yourself  urlLink here . Bye bye the dumbya...

      This may sound mean to some but life is tough and having freedom of speech means occasionally having to hear something you don't like. If you can't control the amount of food you place into your mouth you do not have an illness. You are not sick. You have a character flaw. Its not that big a deal. Pardon my pun. We all have them. I have a very bad temper. I can be smug. I have been known to abuse.. let say 'my poisons.' Combine that flaw with the other two and you have a pretty wicked combination. Well you get the point.. Enough about me for now. Lets get back to fat people.  I came across this  urlLink ABCNews.com  article today about "Fat-acceptance Activists" and was surprised to agree with their basic premise that being fat is not a decease. Where we part ways is that it is OK to let yourself be fat. They claim that you can be healthy at any weight. That's a lark and they know it. Among fat people one may be healthier that the other but generally speaking being overweight is unhealthy. If you have a medical condition that causes you to be fat that is one thing. Get the condition treated and then lose the weight. But if you are just fat because you eat too much then accept the fact that you have a character flaw and deal with it. Just because two thirds of American adults are fat doesn't make it OK. Being fat leads to disease at an alarming rate and is preventable. Stop stuffing your face and exercise.  The article cites the annual cost of obesity related healthcare at $100 Billion. CNN has an  urlLink article  that has the number at $75 billion with the public paying about $39 billion of the through Medicare and Medicaid. That is $175.00 per person. So when you do your taxes next year just think about $175.00 is going to treat someone's diabetes because they couldn't put down a cheeseburger. That is a lot of money to cover something that is preventable. We have had a collective conniption fit over cigarette smoking, seatbelts, drunk driving etc.. What about obesity? Are we so afraid to offend somebody that we refuse to help them save their own life?  Now I'm for helping people as much as the next Liberal but I think we can help fat people in more constructive ways. Saying "your fat and that's OK" is not going to get it. I'm not saying we should be rude to fat people or discriminate in any way, but we need to let them know that being fat is a sign of their own personal weakness and they should be ashamed of it. Fat people should have to pay for that seat next to them on an airplane that one of their wings is rolling into. You should not have the right to some jobs because you are fat. I think there should be weight standards for Police and Fireman. Too bad. Encouraging something that is unhealthy by making special provisions for it is nothing more than enabling the weak willed to feed their character flaw.  Now back to me, its always about me isn't it? For Christmas 1999 I was blessed with a pair of really cool pants, size 38/30. When I tried them on I could barely get them buttoned. I went back down stairs and someone suggested that we exchange them for bigger ones. I thought it for a second and felt my gut drop, literally. How had I let this happen? I spent 13 years in the military and was in good shape when I got out 3 years earlier. I got on a scale and realized I was 5'10" - 221 pounds. Long story short, I dropped 30 pounds in about 2 months just by not stuffing my face with snacks all evening in front of the TV and doing some moderate exercise. 30 pounds with very little effort. When I turned 40 in 2002 I was hovering right around 185, which is still over weight for someone my height. But the weight wasn't what got me motivated. I didn't like the way my body presented itself. My wife would never say anything, but I felt like I needed a little tuning before its too late. I was working at a place that had a gym in the building. So I started working out and changed the way relate to food. I keep a diary of everything I eat. I don't really diet. I just know how much food I can eat based on my activity level and how much I need to limit myself to to lose weight. Not rocket science, just math. Now my weight hovers between 165 and 170 and I wear size 32 pants. I can walk 10 miles in 2 hours, I'm pretty strong with a fairly well defined upper body. I'm in pretty good shape. I've been as low as 159, but that too skinny for me. So dropping and keeping 50 plus pounds off for over four years is possible without too much effort. But there is effort and you have to stop stuffing your pie hole.  My own story is the real reason I have very little sympathy for fat people. Sorry, that's just the way it is. I don't consider myself anything special when it comes to dealing with my own character flaws. Lord knows I could have handled the other ones better. So when you are at dinner with a fat person don't be afraid to suggest a low calorie menu item. Invite them on that hike with you. Invite them to your gym. They'll thank you for it and you will be doing your duty as a good American to bring down the cost of healthcare for all of us.  PUT THE CHIPS DOWN!

      A troll among a Veterans for Kerry Email list sent the following, because he is so clever;    Sent: Saturday, July 31, 2004 3:25 AM Subject: Fw: Fw: Swift Boat Veterans for Truth - Service to Country   Interesting Reading!   urlLink  http://www.swiftvets.com/     When you get down to the picture, put your mouse on the picture and you will see who backs Kerry.   ...and I replied to the group  So sad, the last gasp of a dying political machine.  These swift boat vets have been debunked for what they are, a GOP funded partisan group led by former Nixon political hack John O'Neill.  urlLink http://mediamatters.org/items/200405040004  There are also charges that the group was illegally funded by Tom Delay's campaign. There is an active ethic complaint in the house but we'll have to depend on the State of Texas to handle it because congress isn't likely to investigate Delay while the GOP hold majority. Sad  urlLink http://www.duckstrap.com/swiftboatveteransfortruth_debunked.php   When I was in the first Gulf War some guys got more medals than me and some got less. There was an element of jealously, or maybe it was just natural competition who knows, around all of it when it all came out after the war, not much but it was there then. The bottom line is the guys on the boat with him, all of them, the Green Beret whose life he saved have all come out and attested to his bravery under fire and his fitness for Command. None of the "swiftboaters" in the book served on his boat. Its was just jealous superiors who became so after his antiwar stance and the fact he turned out to be so successful as a Liberal Politician. His did his duty before and after the war. Additionally, what about all those Generals and Admirals, most of whom served under Bush, that are behind Kerry, that stood up for him at the Convention last week. You forgot to mention them.  Just for fun lets compare his military career against dumbya's.  urlLink http://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2004/02/02_400.html   ..and here's an article the sets the record straight on Kerry's Defense votes. He in many cases was voting with the GOP who were trying to save the first George's presidency by capitalizing on the "Peace Dividend". I particularly like the Cheney quote from when he was SecDef .."You've directed me to buy more M-1s, F-14s, and F-16sall great systems  but we have enough of them." The Dems should be hammering these guys with this on Cheney being soft on defense but they are doing a good job of keeping their head above the fray.   urlLink http://slate.msn.com/id/2096127   For the rest of you I know you guys live in Georgia and its pretty much out of play, but I just moved to New Hampshire , which is very much in play, in fact Kerry leads by ~10 point, and I must say the atmosphere is electric. We have a scandal ridden GOP Governor who is going to be booted and there are organized groups of Republican supporting Kerry because they feel they were lied to about fiscal restrain, the war, pretty much everything. These Republicans are true conservatives. They are not just puppets of their SBC masters as in the South. Up here people keep their religion to themselves and out of politics. I actually respect the Republicans up here.  Anyway, don't let Rethuglican punks try to talk you down with their BS about Kerry. Its all lies because that's all they have. If anyone needs any ammo I can provide plenty.  Cheers,  VOTE DAMN IT!

      I found myself on a Georgia Veterans for Kerry list and had to reply to a message about swiftboat vets against Kerry. My response solicited mostly positive emails from the vets but one thinks I need a lesson about life from Neil Boortz. So he sent me this, non-cited, article that is supposed to tell me what is wrong with Liberals. Fine and dandy, but here is my response. Do you think it will screw his head into the ground? You can read the whole email if you want, but I wouldn't bother its that lame Commencement speech article Neil Boortz enthusiast like to send around, because it "proves" liberals are bad. It's easy to f$%k with these guys because they are not too bright.  Sent: Sunday, August 01, 2004 4:36 PM Subject: Re: Commencement speech you should have heard.....  Why don't you cite any of these sources? What do you fear? The truth? I'd be interested in what else these folks say. I like to look at things in a larger context. You forget, I used to live in Atlanta. Then, as I do now, I considered Neil Boortz a blowhard. Have an original thought, Man. You don't need someone to tell you how to feel and think. Boortz and his ilk are demagogues. They feed on your insecurities. They know you are not happy with your lot in life or are ashamed of something about you and are looking for someone to blame or to deflect the shame upon. They feed that. Its very negative. What do you think he would be saying to you if he knew about all your ugly, dirty little secrets and desires? We all have them. How do you think he would treat you if you called his show and admitted a dirty little truth about yourself? He would scorn you because it is what he hates about himself. That kind of anger and negativity is what rule people like him and Rush Limbaugh. Doesn't it make sense to you? Remember how Rush used to go on and on about drug addicts? All the time he was the worst kind and he hid it from the world while railing against it. Though dost protest too much...or something to that effect. On the other hand, I could be completely wrong, but I'm secure enough with myself to realize that.  btw. response to my original email has been along the lines of;  "Roger That Ray. Thanks so much for you good words. Kerry will kick GW's butt in November. We're all doing our part.  xxx xxxxx, US Army, 64-67 Vietnam."  "The real Veterans among us know the deal."  So keep trolling the right wing nutjob sites. I'm sure you'll find plenty of people with whom to agree. Hate wrapped in objectivism is still hate. Don't be a hater, be a lover. It was what Jesus wanted us to do. The future is bigger than our petty ideologies.  Peace be with you and rest in the comfort that Dumbya will most likely carry Georgia and most of the south so you can blame his redefeat on us miserable Yankee liberals.  VOTE DAMN IT!  ----- Original Message ----- xxxx xxxx  Sent: Sunday, August 01, 2004 1:33 PM Subject: Fw: Commencement speech you should have heard..... Subject: Commencement speech you should have heard..... I am honored by the invitation to address you on this august occasion. It's about time. Be warned, however, that I am not here to impress you; you'll have enough smoke blown your way today. And you can bet your tassels I'm not here to impress the faculty and administration.  yada yada Neil Boortz Commencement Speech BS, of course he never gave it either.  urlLink http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/boortz.asp  Thanks Roby for the link.
