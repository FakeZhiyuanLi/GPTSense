      I am not sure if I can do this story justice by writing it but I will give it a whirl....  I am sure her pets are possessed... I should have known she didn't tell me the whole story. When I walked in the house I found the garbage can on the kitchen table & a bottle of Pet-Eze (used to calm down hyperactive dogs) on the counter.  The first three days went well, no accidents no problems... I knew we would have problems on Saturday (refer to earlier posts) So, on Sunday I decided I needed to stay at her house... I tried to sleep on the couch but the birds keep chirping (they began to sound like the dogs) and dogs kept licking me... I swear I am made out of cotton candy - they were licking my feet, my hands and my face.  I gave up and went into her bedroom. Of course the dogs followed. There was some hissing and snarling. Not by me but by the other cat who just had kittens - protecting her young from the slobbering monsters that keep following me around. They got the clue &amp; left the room - I closed the door behind them - thereby locking both cats in the room.  I woke up the next morning to the cat scratching at the door to get out. So I dragged my lazy ass out of bed and opened the door for him - I figured it would be a good time to let the dogs out too so that they will have some time outside before I had to go to work. As I opened the door, I found the dogs standing there looking so innocent - Walking down the hallway and I sensed something wrong. I approached the living room with caution only to realize that the dogs have turned destructive. It looked like a cloud had exploded in the room. There was cotton all over the place. After a quick glance at the couches (to my relief) I found they had only destroyed a dog pillow - I yelled a few choice words at the dogs and then let them out... way to aggravated to deal with the mess I went back to bed.  Now, let me tell you - I was smelling something funny after I woke up the first time - I thought it was just me, you know, maybe I farted in my sleep or something. However, after I woke up the second time and I could still smell it - I knew something was wrong. Well, remember I told you I locked the freaking cat in the bedroom - he used the bathroom in the bedroom to relieve himself - needless to say she now has one less towel to wash.  Anyway, I got ready for work and then brought the beasts back into the house - Just then I saw the bottle of Pet-Eze on the counter - so, I figured it would be a nice treat for the dogs (and me).  I went to work that evening dreading on having to come back to the house to clean up the mess from the dogs and hoping the Pet-Eze worked. When I got there I immediately locked the dogs out and proceeded to clean the living room from the cloud burst - as I was sweeping up I noticed a hell of a lot of bird feathers. Upon closer inspection of the bird I realized the little f'er was pulling out his feathers. I could freaking see his pink bird skin. Great, I realized when J got home she was going to have a heart attack - the bird would be bald - the dogs dead and the cat sitting in the corner rocking back and forth - repeating the phrase, I am special to someone!  Finally, I was done cleaning up the mess and after a quick glance at the place I figured there is nothing else the monsters can destroy and let them back in. Did I mention there is still one dog pillow left?  I woke up the next morning and had an eerie sense of deja vu - minus the cat shit on the towel. Lo and behold there were no dog pillows left and another great cloud burst. I was mad - It took all of my self constraint to not kick the crap out of them.  And the cycle begins - the last thing they destroyed was one of the couch pillows - while I was there and awake. The nerve. I thought they were neutered.  Let me finish by saying I am freaking glad this week is over and every pet survived - except possibly frog that I never actually saw - I wouldn't be surprised if it was dead, especially since it was locked in the kids bedroom for a week. Me and the cat were like burglars and used my Players Card to break into the room. ( I locked it after the incidents on Saturday & Sunday) - Never did see the frog. Maybe it was playing hide and seek or the dogs ate it.  The week was a lesson well learned - I am sticking to cats.  I have pictures - I will post them when I get the upload program to work

      My roommate was sick over the weekend - girlie problems (yeah, I wont go into detail) but I thought we may have had to take her to the hospital.. Needless to say I was up until 4am on Saturday morning - I ended up going into work 5 hours late - there was no way in hell I was going to be able to work a 16 hour shift on 1 hour of sleep - just not gonna happen... She had a friend there but, I was worried about her and wanted to make sure she was going to be okay.&nbsp; All is well.  Found out today that Drunk Dialing to a&nbsp;speaker phone&nbsp;is bad - fortunately I wasnt the caller - just the reciever.&nbsp;   A monsoon is brewing - it is beautiful out tonight - the wind is blowing pretty hard, we havent seen any rain yet though.&nbsp; The lightning storm is beautiful.&nbsp;   The house sitting isnt going as well as I wanted it to... It is hard for me on the weekends - I only work three days a week - Saturday, Sunday & Monday - (yeah, I love my job) The dogs are fighting the power - I think the big one knows how to open doors.&nbsp; Together they decided to make a new bathroom in the house.&nbsp; Maria had quite a surprise when she came over to let the dogs out....&nbsp; Who says dogs arent smart....

      Well, I have figured out how to turn on the living room lights.  Last night I sat in the dark because I couldnt figure it out... low and behold the freaking switch is in the kitchen - the lighting in the house must have been designed by the Microsoft Me programmers... ;)  I also found another perk - she has the best shower.&nbsp; I cant wait until tomorrow just so I can take another shower.&nbsp; Az has some of the best water pressure I have ever seen.&nbsp; Go figure that we are in the desert....  &nbsp;

      2am - I am house sitting for a friend who ironically has the same name as me.   It is always wierd to be in someones house when they are not here.&nbsp; Especially when they have pets.&nbsp; My friend has a whole zoo - 2 dogs, 2 birds, fish, two cats, a crap load of kittens and of course the ever present frog (which thank god I DONT have to feed)&nbsp; the thought of having to put crickets in his tank just creeps me out.   There are two nice perks though - she has cable & high speed internet.&nbsp; I am glad that I have a laptop though because her computer sucks.&nbsp; I dont care what any one says about XP.&nbsp; It is the bomb compared to Me.&nbsp; I have still yet to figure out what kind of drugs Microsoft was on when they decided to release Me.&nbsp; (Probrably thinking about all the money they would make in technical support calls)   Another down fall is none of her freaking remotes have batteries - I have searched high and low and have only found one lonely battery sitting in a charger in the drawer.&nbsp; I tried to give the guy a little pep talk so that maybe he would be able to power the remote - but he is a very stubborn battery.... no such luck.   I am off to enjoy the power of high speed internet - if you see a blur across your screen - wave hello that is probrably me surfing by....

      Okay,  I am freaking OCD - another 4am post.&nbsp; I am Obsessive and Complusive about posting.&nbsp; I was looking back through my "history" and realized I have only had this blog for 17 days!!!! To top it off I have posted 31 times.&nbsp;   (AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Little house on the Praire - oh hell no!)  I love it when my kitten purrs... it is one of the best sounds in the world.... It lets me know I am doing some thing right.  Okay enough ramdom sentences - I am off to clip kittens nails - he is NOT going to like me after this .....

      I would give today a 8 out of 10.  I was technically off of work but decided to drag my ass to an off-campus lunch meeting.&nbsp; The director was there so I figured I should make an appearance.&nbsp; I figure the more face time the better.&nbsp; Anyhow, I had the best lunch... We went to Chili's - Normally I dont like the trendy chain Mexican resturants - I prefer Mexican food made by real Mexicans sweathing over a hot stove.... But, I had their spinach & artichoke quesadillas, with their salsa.&nbsp; It was so good!! Beware- the rice tasted like ass.  Anyhow, afterward me and R went to the movies - We saw Anchorman ( note - dont waste your money)&nbsp; It was kinda cool he has been winning so much money that he actually paid for me & my drink (no popcorn - I was full from lunch)&nbsp;.&nbsp; The movie was okay - but you really have to like Will Ferrell.&nbsp; I just dont appreciate his sense of humor.&nbsp;   Then we hit the casino - this is where the day turned from a 10 to an 8 - Lost another 200 dollars but it did kill time.&nbsp; I met a really cool woman - she called herself Grandma - she was onrey as hell - full of fire.&nbsp; She reminded me of the grandmother I just lost.&nbsp;   After the casino we went and saw Soul Plane at the freaking kick ass dollar theather - actually it was the 2 dollar theater - but on Tuesdays they only charge 1.25 ( I paid this time :) )&nbsp; The both of us loved the movie - I heard bad things about it but, I truly liked it - I suppose you would need to either love the "ghetto" type movies or be an airline employee to appreciate it... I fit in both categories so I loved it.  After that me and R parted ways - i kinda didnt want the day to end - I had such a good time.&nbsp; I have found a friend in such an unusual person.&nbsp; We fight like cats and dogs but it is part of the fun. :)

      I went to bed at 7am this morning and woke up feeling like shit - (note to self - stay out of the casino) &nbsp; I did absolutely nothing at work today - I came in sat down and didnt move - except for the occasional soda refill and the often smoke break.&nbsp; I even went into low rider mode.&nbsp; I suppose I should explain.... We have the best office equipment (Can see the sarcasim oozing off of that statement?)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, there have been many arguments over the hieght of the the chairs in the office - 99% sit like normal people - 1% puts the chair all the way down and basically sits UNDER the desk... I could never understand how she sits like that - well it is absolutely impossible to get the fucking chair back up to normal height.&nbsp; After many years of fighting with the chairs we have dubbed one of them the "low rider chair" - labeled accordingly.&nbsp; It was in this chair I sat in and stayed. &nbsp; I did manage to get about half-way through the archives of a blog that I am fascinated by - Yeah real productive - I love high speed internet.

      Another long evening at the casino.... I need to move to a state that doesnt have casinos, it would save me alot of money :) &nbsp; It wasnt too bad though, I lost a lot less than I usually do - It is probrably due to the fact that my friend who is on a hot streak right now gave me 150 dollars - I never knew him to be so generous.&nbsp;  &nbsp; B was driving me crazy tonight - he wants to get married - not to me, which is cool.&nbsp; 25 and he has this bug that he needs to be married.&nbsp; I dont really understand.&nbsp; I am willing to wait, I want to marry my best friend, I want to marry the person that I am going to be with the rest of my life - not one that I am going to waste a few years on.&nbsp; I dont think he understands that - I dont know anyone these days that has stayed married longer than 5 years - unless they are mormon but they are required to stay married - (if they are good mormons)&nbsp;  &nbsp; Found out that my ex has a 4 year old baby - we broke up 4 years ago - I can do the math - the girl would have gotten pregnant just around the time that we broke up - and would have given birth by the time I told him to stop calling me :)  I thank god everyday that I never got pregnant by him - I now truly believe that there is a God out there watching over me (even though he is not very generous in the gambling department)  &nbsp; Oh well...

      The strangest things make you reflect back on your life - today I found one of them &nbsp; We had a medical emergency come in on a flight from Prescott, AZ&nbsp;- It turns out the guy was deathly allergic to peanuts.&nbsp; You would be surprised how many people have this allergy - some are so sensetive that even peanut dust would cause them to have a reaction. &nbsp; Anyway, back to the peanut guy - he came off the flight and the paramedics checked him out - he wasnt doing very well, they didnt think he was going to make it and he was taken to the hospital. &nbsp; The supervisor that was there said he didnt make it.&nbsp; For lack of a better name - this poor gentleman was dubbed the peanut guy.&nbsp; Can you imagine - Dying just after getting off a plane surrounded by strangers - after having an allergic&nbsp;reaction to peanuts and being dubbed the dead peanut guy? &nbsp; Later on that evening,&nbsp;I was typing up the report on the incident - and it turns out that he didnt die - he actually&nbsp;came back to the airport with a note from the doctor saying it was okay for him to continue to travel.&nbsp; All day long we believed this&nbsp;guy died.&nbsp; For a short period of time he was dead - I wonder if he knows?&nbsp;

      Okay, My crazy kitten has a weird fascination with me and the bathroom.  &nbsp;  I have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to pee in peace and quiet again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Everytime I walk into the bathroom the crazy kitten follows me - he just rubs my legs, walks around and stares up at me like I am the crazy one - I dont like when he looks at me like that :p  &nbsp;  It actually quite comical - I will go into the bathroom and I can hear his tiny paws tearing through the house at Mach 5 - I dont need to close or open the door, lift the lid ( i keep it closed so he doesnt drown himself - besides I use bleach to clean it and dont want him drinking the water and end up getting a bleach addition - I dont have time to take him to Bleach Drinkers Anonymous meetings) anyhow, all I need to do is cross the threshold and like magic he appears.&nbsp; Maybe he has installed sensors while I was at work one day....just so he doesnt miss one moment of my bathroom routine.  &nbsp;  I wonder if I could turn his fascination into a benefit for me - maybe I could potty train him?  &nbsp;  Doubt it.....&nbsp;

       I recieved this list in an email and thought it was funny.... Enjoy.    &nbsp;  Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.  Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.  I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it. So I said Implants?" She hit me.  I don't do drugs. I get the same effect just standing up fast.  I live in my own little world. But it's OK. They know me here.  I got a sweater for Christmas. I really wanted a screamer or a moaner.  I don't approve of political jokes. I've seen too many of them get elected.  I love being married. It's so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.  Every time I walk into a singles bar I can hear Mom's wise words: Don't pick that up, you don't know where it's been!"  A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...but, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, Damn...that was fun!"  I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!  When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."  Don't argue! with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.  Just remember...if the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off.  Why is it that our children can't read a Bible in school, but they can in prison?&nbsp;&nbsp;   If raising children was going to be easy, it never would have started with something called LABOR!&nbsp;&nbsp;   Wouldn't you know it...Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FAT cells live forever.  Why do I have to swear on the Bible in court when the Ten Commandments cannot be displayed in&nbsp;a federal building?  Bumper sticker of the year:  "If you can read this, thank a teacher....and since it's in English, thank a soldier."&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink      I am testing out putting pictures up here on the blog - I have been looking at other people's blogs and I find I enjoy it much better when they have pictures - whether random things - or actual people.....  &nbsp;  So I figured I would go with an easy&nbsp;one - Jasper.&nbsp; My new crazy kitten.&nbsp; He freaking climbs everything - the walls - he actually climbs the freaking walls.... I dont believe in declawing animals because it is a cruel practice - imagine having your fingers cut at the second knuckle....  &nbsp;  Anyhow - so I ordered soft paws on ebay... hopefully it works... if it doesnt - I will have to chain the little f*($er up... :)

      :: Standing up - Head hung down :: Hi, My name is Jennifer and I am addicted to Reality TV. &nbsp; Yes, so not only do I have a gambling addiction - I love reality TV.... you name it I watch it... Thank god I dont have cable or people would think I was an albino from lack of sunlight :) &nbsp; Current passions: Big Brother - I love the twin twist - dispite how predictable it was. Amazing Race - Thank God Allison and Donny are gone - I think everyone was expecting that. Homestead - (0n our local PBS channel) - it is when people go back an live like they were in the 1800's.... pretty interesting. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I can not freaking believe it.... I hurt my back playing Bingo... what the hell? &nbsp; For those of you who have never played real Bingo - all it entails is sitting at a table with way to many bingo cards infront of you - "dobbing" your little heart out - hoping for the chance to yell BINGO!!!... &nbsp; Well, I have never gotten the chance to yell Bingo - but I hurt my back playing.&nbsp; Probrably from holding my "dobber" over the papers looking for the last number called.&nbsp; How freaking pathetic.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I think I will make something good up about how I hurt my back... Hmm.. any idea?

       You know having off 4 days a week is quite boring.&nbsp; The first two days I run around like a maniac, trying to do everything that I couldnt do on the days I work.&nbsp; And the second two days I just lay around on the couch and watch TV.&nbsp; I may add that afternoon TV is BORING... especially if you dont watch soaps.    &nbsp;

      I am at the brink of having a gambling addiction.  It sucks a$$.  As of today I am 220 dollars in the hole - Not bad considering I have been going to the casino at least 2-3 nights a week...  BlackJack is my drug of choice.  I am dream of 21's.  What started as a fun hobby has turned into a crappy job.  Sitting hours upon hours at the table waiting for a hot streak (which lately seems to slip past my finger tips as a tap the table for another card).  I come home bleary eyed smelling like an overripe ash tray.  Fortunately I dont think I need to jump on the internet and search for the closest gambling anoynomus meeting - because I have realized my problem and have sworn off the casino until next paycheck... LOL

      As the thermometer starts to push over 100 - I begin to hate it here...   But the monsoon season here is one of the best times of the year - we have the best thunderstorms - you can see it approach over the flat desert landscape and there seems to be an electricity in air as everything and everyone awaits the approaching storm.    The lightning lights up the sky and the thunder reaches to your bones.  It makes you feel alive.  An insane person (me) just wants to run out in the rain and let it wash away all of my sorry and sins. Ofcourse the chance of getting hit by lightning usually keeps me "safely" indoors staring aimlessly out the window at the power of mother nature.

      I like being called pumpkin.  Out of left field - over to right field. In the dugout - up at bat --  I have no idea where this person is coming from or heading?

      Alcohol and Airline employees are a bad mix.  We had a going away party for some people at work.  4 people in the last month have jumped ship, I suppose I should say aircraft.  It was quite the "blow-out".  I know that change is a part of life, doesnt mean I have to like it.... the freaking cheese has been moved so many times we need to put a GPS thingy on it to keep track of it.  It is always the good people - I understand you can only get kicked so many times - you eventually come to your senses and realize you need to get out of this abusive relationship...   Sick part is I am hooked - I wonder why I am trying to get this degree, I know I am going to stay - Work my way toward the legacy carriers - make more money - travel for free.  I am truly one of those people who loves to travel.  Thoughts wandering aimlessly over the computer lines.  I am now confusing myself...

      I burned it all.....  Getting ready to get in the shower - hop in the ghetto ride and head to the airport.... back home to the burning desert -   Lack of sleep is not a good thing for me - Here comes Super B*%#h -   I am looking forward to my five hour flight - cramming my overweight tush into a coach seat in the back of the aircraft - hopefully - there is always a little apprehsion when flying standby - that on the chance I will not make it on the flight - bitter sweet memories of being stuck and stranded in Argentina - calling Dad to get money to get home - only to be stranded in Miami and then Las Vegas - Ahhh... memories :)  Off to clean the lack of sleep slime off of me......

      We left the house today - took the little one to Chuckie Cheese - had a pretty good time considering my age - almost thirty and running around the place trying to get tickets to get some cheesy prize - not worth the money I spent trying to get them....   Gotta love corporate america

      4am - all is well  Ryan is sitting on his computer playing some silly 1st person game - screaming at people who arent in the room  I feel like I am in a space time continum (did I spell that right? - who cares it is 4am) I am exhausted but cant sleep - they will be up in a few hours - I dont mind the big ones but the little one will be yanking her spongebob square pants blanket off of me at about 7am - while my eyes rollback into my head trying to get away from the sun shining through the blinds that do absolutely nothing but hide the outside world.  ::as my mind wanders:: I wonder what the fascination with spongebob squarepants is all about?  Not having cable I have only had a few oppurtunities to see the show - it is rather odd....  ::wandering back::  time zones suck - I have had 3-4 hours of straight sleep in the last 48 hours - you think I would be enjoying my dreams right now .... no instead I sit bleary eyed infront of this computer with a crappy screen that is blurry - ALL THE TIME - as I add another post to this "online diary"  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ - wish I could take those Z's to the couch with me....

      I have this weird thing with Monkeys - well everyone THINKS I have this thing with monkeys when actually I dont really care - it all started with a freaking nickname - Holla Monkey sometimes it can just be Holla or Monkey but, more often than not it is Holla (people get lazy I suppose).  I got the freaking nickname because I was aggrevated at the world one day and I just let my frustration out - ranting and raving about everything.... and Holla Monkey was born...  and now everything is about monkeys - even when we were planning our next vacation - they asked hey - dont you wanna go to Costa Rica (SJO) they have monkeys there.... go figure...  Monkey pictures - keychains - lamps - stationary - all given to me.....

      July 4, 2004   Actually it is July 5, 2004 and my fourth of july started off with some big bangs... I dragged my lazy tush home to visit the family after some guilt from mom - so I got to spend the holiday with the family - hmmm... we ate chinese food in front of the TV and watched the fireworks from the window - what a blast (ha ha) - however, it did start off with a family blowout regarding what else - money - she owes this one money - he has the car - she wont give up the money and some bill hasnt been paid... it involved a number of people across a few state lines - I should have stayed in the desert.

      Yeah, I am a sucker.  Another girl convinced me to Housesit for her.  The odds were a little better this time, she only has 1 dog who has the best invention ever created - The doggy door!!!  The doggy door is awesome for lazy people like me.  I dont have to get up off the couch to let the dog out, I dont have to guess when they need to go to the bathroom, the dog just walks outside when she feels like it.  Although she does have her dog on a diet, so I feel like I am starving the damn thing.  She told me to only give it one cup of food twice a day.  It doesnt seem like enough, but I am not going to be the one responsible for making her animal fat.

      I love this season  I am secretly rooting for the 4 horseman - I was sad to see Scott go.  Him and Jase actually made the show pretty interesting.  I am hoping that either Drew ( who is so hot my TV screen smokes after I watch the show ) or Will wins.  I wish I had the 24 hour live link - I refuse to pay for it though.  Cant wait until Saturday.

      So yeah, I am a freaking pushover.   I got roped into dog sitting for another friend.  She only has one dog though and a doggy door.   So today I went over to her house to meet her dog - Harley (a girl).  It was Harley's birthday.  So she was having a birthday party for her.  It was the cutest thing.  She invited all of her neighbors dogs over to join in the festivities.  The party consisted of us sitting around and throwing the ball in the pool and having Harley jump in and retrieve it.  She was the only dog enjoying the pool because she was the only one that could swim.. It would have been funny to see the other dogs wearing floaties though.   I got to meet her neighbors who are very friendly, this week should be interesting.  I am actually looking forward to it.  On a side note - I am actually surprised.  I wasnt sure if she actually liked me.  It was a fleeting thought that she was using me to watch her dog for free but, I dont think she would let me stay in her house and watch her dog if she didnt like me.  Sometimes I have no self confidence.

      A few weeks ago I caught some drunk dumbass (read Southwest passenger) walking across the ramp in the secure area at work.  It had been the crappiest day at work and I had been waiting for hours to be able to go and smoke a cigarette.  I had just lit up and took my first drag when I saw this guy walking around like he owned the place.  After a double take and a few choice words I asked the guy if he had a badge.  He stopped looked at me like I was crazy and said no.  So like the signs tell me to (they are posted everywhere in the secure area) I asked him to follow me back into the secure area.  He waved me off and kept walking.  Note to the world, dont mess with a girl who hasnt had a smoke in a few hours.   I end up heading upstairs to call the police when I run into this guy that has a radio and I ask him to call the tower to tell the police - instead he takes off after the guy, who is walking like his shoes are on fire.  By the time I get up stairs and call the police the kid has captured him and the police have them surrounded.  It turns out the guy had exited a door on the other side of the airport and everyone has been looking for him.  Me being the lucky one to find him and the poor kid to run into me while I was trying to call the police.  We end up giving our statements and returning to the hell operation.  Flash forward a few weeks - I get a call from Montana who can not keep a secret - he tells me we are getting awards for our "bravery" but I am not supposed to let anyone know that I know.  I am supposed to believe that it is a hearing (which, had the guy fought his charges I could have very well had to attend)  I should have become an actress - no one knew that I knew.  I even apologized to the guys for dragging them into this mess.  The best part - we each got a check - I got $50 for being the first to identify him and the other two (the second guy came up as the kid was bringing him upstairs) got $35 dollars.  Plus we all got Polo Shirts.  Not bad  So yeah - I am a hero - I think I am gonna cut my Polo up and turn it into a cape.  Protecting the airport.  Your Welcome

       Have you ever read the Dave Berry column - this guys is absolutely hysterical. Here is an excerpt from today's column...      "I know what you're thinking now. You're thinking: ''Dave, are you insane? Our nation is struggling to deal with war, worldwide terrorism, a mounting budget deficit, a health-care crisis and some very questionable votes on American Idol. With all these serious problems facing us, how can you possibly ignore the Honey Nut Cheerios Honey Bee? Surely you wouldn't call IT a male? No, I would not. I would call it gender-neutral. And as the father of a 4-year-old girl, I frankly do not want my daughter to grow up in a world where her cereal-spokesperson role model is an asexual bee. Speaking of which, does anybody know why, when we explain human sexuality to young people, we refer to it as ''the birds and the bees?'' I am an observant person who has spent many hours outdoors, and I have never once seen a bird OR a bee have sex. I don't believe that, organ-wise, birds or bees have any equipment they can have sex WITH. I believe this is the main reason why they can fly, and we can't: They are more aerodynamic"     If you want to read the whole (and so I don't get arrested for plagiarism) here is the link -   urlLink  http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/9288771.htm?1c

      Ahhh.... Another night of Mandtory Overtime (mando) - two hours of non-stop fun.   Today the airline industry was messed up - American Airlines and US Airways was having problems from a computer glitch.  America West & Mesa couldnt get a plane up in the air and have it stay there.  Thousands of passengers stranded across the country.  And what do we say.... I am sorry for the inconvience, here is a hotel voucher and meal voucher and the next available flight on Tuesday.  Thank you for flying this wonderful airline.  Blahhhh.....  Stupid me said I would cover someone's vacation tomorrow morning... So, two hours of mando tonight (and last night), 3 hours of sleep and back tomorrow for another eight hours of fun....  Yeah and I get to fly for free..... Not worth it.

      It cracks me up - they have these commercials here in PHX.  It is called interactive male.  It is basically a chat line for homosexual males.  The funny part is that it only comes on after midnight and they never say what it is exactly for... you just have to read between the lines...
