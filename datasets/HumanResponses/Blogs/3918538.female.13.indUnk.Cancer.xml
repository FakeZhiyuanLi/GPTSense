      Am I the only one that notices it? Am I the only one that can feel the change? I mean, wherever I go, people, that were once familiar, they've changed. I wanna mention names, but I dunno.... People that were once a stranger, have become the closest people to me, they know me better than some of the people I've known my whole life. People are drifting away, some of my best friends, now distant, we barely talk, we barely see eachother, and when we do we dont' know what to say. When I need help, people turn away. People I barely know, try to become important in my life. People I know best, try to back out.... How do I know what people are really feeling? One person that I really cared and still do care about, is changing right before my very eyes. From the funny sweet happy person, to a distant down and almost dark. I'm just starting to realize these things about people that I should've been able to realize long ago. And don't think that this entry is about people that you don't even know, if you're reading this and you know me, one part of this I guarantee is about you. No one's stayed the same, at all. It's not just the drifting, its the way they act, around me and other people, the way they talk, the way they are.... People who might be reading this right now, might not get what I'm feeling, some might feel exactly the way I do, but there's really not much left to say... you figure it out.

      Whoa, this is so confusing, took me like 1/2 an hour to find this page to get a post down. uhhh i don't think anyone's gonna look at this anywy, cuz i just update my xanga, i'm not that good at online journals. I used to keep my written journals under my bed, but one by one SOMEONE took 'em... so now i'm skeptical bout 'em. the only thing it that, if i actually write what i'm feeling, like this is an actual journal, i'll get freaked out, cuz my thoughts are my own personal thoughts and i don't want anyone else reading 'em.

      Damn, two things suck about going to six flags tomorrow: its friday the 13th, ok i'm not like superstitious, but sometimes i sorta believe it... i'm so weird, and its gonna be liek 60 degree weather, so i'm gonna be riding the roller coasters in like sweatshirtS. but it'd better be fun cuz i haven't gone for like 2 years. ummmmmmmmmmm i need to go to the mall soon, cuz i can like never go anywhere unless i get rides, which totally sucks. the only thigns close are the library, white hen and DQ but i aint goin there everyday, and i've sorta stopped goin to DQ for a reason... but i'm not gonna tell you it. ;) ok i guess i'm done i'll go check out meli's and sophie's blogs now... :)
