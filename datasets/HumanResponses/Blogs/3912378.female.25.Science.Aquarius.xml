      Hooray!  I made it through week one and am one day into week two.&nbsp; Things are going well, and I will continue to avoid the "restaurant" trap.

      Since beginning on Thursday of Last week, I've only had one meal out.&nbsp; Technically it wasn't a meal, and it was at a concert, but I feel that it counts even more because of the low quality of food.&nbsp; So I had a pretzel and a large beer--my eating out for the week. &nbsp; At home I've been relatively good.&nbsp; Lots of salmon, some veggies, and a ton of fruit.&nbsp; I feel like I need this more defined, or I'll just eat a ton.&nbsp; But, the bet was to see if I could go a month with only eating out four times (which to some might seem like a lot of times to eat out, but in the Bay Area, most people eat out at least a couple times a week b/c there are so many great restaurants to try), and so I must remain faithful to those simplistic parameters. &nbsp; Work will be more challenging.&nbsp; Meetings tend to be catered, and the one meeting that always has these nice healthy sandwiches came packed with fried chicken on thursday (???not fair!).&nbsp; I didn't have another option for food, and I'm not sure if it counts as eating out, but I didn't pay for it, so I'm going to excuse it, since it's looked down upon to bring your lunch to these things. &nbsp; all right, that's it for now. &nbsp; WEEK 1: 16-Jul-2004, John Mayer Concert, Large Beer, Unsalted Pretzel.&nbsp; $11.50

      So I decided to "officially" begin my first leg of this challenge--no eating out (well, once a week limit) for 30 days--on the 15th, rather than start on a random day.  The beauty of this is that it's: a) payday, and b) easy to keep track of the 30 days.  So today was my "last supper," and unfortunately I went big time with a disgustingly high fat lunch.  "Ground Round" was the place...so not worth the price and dietary costs!  Tomorrow I will do my first round of healthy shopping, keep track of the costs (It's got to beat $17 for a greasy lunch!), and see if I can do it.  Good luck to me!

      To not eat out for 30 days, and to lower the amount of processed foods in our diet.  Will it work?  Is it a worthy cause?  Can I survive a month without fastfood in my life?  Probably.  Let's try!  Moral support!  Suggestions! Feedback!  Oh my!  help is greatly appreciated.

      So I had a slip.  I guess it was more about not missing a meal, then sticking with the program.  I wasn't going to be able to eat for eight hours, and I was hungry.  But, with Friday quickly approaching, I have not eaten out yet this week, and its' my last week of the challenge.  Good for me!
