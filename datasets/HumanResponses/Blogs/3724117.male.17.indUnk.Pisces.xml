         reminder: i will not be contacting dandan in any way for   at least    a month-- meaning it can extend. 1.) i do not feel like it. 2.)i feel he's getting annoyed again. 3.)i'm paolo, i'm not   everyone else  , therefore, i cannot feel close to dandan again. 4.) bahala na sya. panira ng araw. 5.) nakaka pang-insulto.

            July 28.  it's so sad.  dandan has left already.  it's really really sad... there were out-of-the-blue moments wherein i would just burst into tears. i couldn't help but be senti. i couldn't help but remember how we were as friends. 3 years. 3 short years. dammit. it really was too short. kung kelan nagka ayusan kami from our problems, saka pa sya aalis. haaay... i wanna cry again. i miss him. i miss dandan. i miss my best friend. i wasn't even able to concentrate last night. i had puffy eyes in the morning. ewan. i can't help but think how i failed him in more ways than one. yeah. i failed as a friend, all the more, i failed as a best friend, somehow. and now i can't even redeem myself, coz he's gone. you know what else sucks? i don't think he cares for me as much now. i read anjo's text-conversation with dandan, and it's really cool of them. i mean... basta. you don't wanna know. nakakainggit lang. i don't wanna be too obssessed about it... but, you know... i even called him up 10 minutes before his boarding. it was too awkward... moments of silence. i didn't know what to say. i just told him to take care, make us proud, that i love him so much. yet i didn't get any response. i dunno. i twas just too sad talaga.... napaiyak ako when i hung up the phone. kahit sa bahay pa lang nya, napapaiyak na ko. margie saw me shed a tear. dandan was crying in the car. it was all too surreal... he left. he left for the states already... haaaaay... i dunno. mixed emotions. basta i'll miss him talaga. i gave him so many gifts pa, just to remember me... yet i don't think he's gonna appreciate that. i wish i could be his best friend again. i really do. i blew many chances, but i'm still praying we can be best friends again. he posted his first message from the states in our yahoo groups. throughout the day, i just keep on thinking of how he is doing already. i wish i could message him again. ashley and i really miss him. panay miss him na lang. sorry. but i really do miss him.... i took him for granted. i put all the blame on myself... i don't want to blame him. i've never been right. i'm always wrong. when will i ever be right. ang sabog ko. un lang masasabi ko. im so sabog right now... i've got another long test coming up tomorrow. di pa ko nag-aaral. i miss seeing him online in YM. whenever i see his name in my phonebook, nalulungkot din ako. when i see his pictures, nalulungkot pa rin ako. another thing, it's so nice of RG to cry for his brother. i'm gonna miss going to their house, just making tambay. im gonna miss all those stuff. im gonna miss dandan in all our barkada gimiks. kulang na kami. it's just not right. im gonna miss him in our batangas trips. wish he was still here. im gonna miss hugging him. im gonna miss the old days... back when i really felt his love for me. hay.  i'll be okay.  i'll make it a point to keep in touch with him.... i'll even call him on some ocassions...

             Straight Man Falls In Love With Best Friend             Is this bisexuality or is it just getting too close for comfort with one's buddy?          He once revealed that he really treasured me as friend and hence, accepted me as his partner.          As for me, I have started to have feelings of love towards him, accidentally, I guess, till I can't stop it. I am just crazy over him.         Arising from this, I could be very suspicious over what he thinks, what he does, what he says and etc. I even check on his email account, mobile phone numbers dialed, received and missed calls, SMS, etc. It has become a form of obsession.   I am exhausted. I guess, my above acts, are just unreasonable, as I had not done this to my previous partners before, i.e. my girlfriends.

           today is july 19.  nearly a week after i lost blogged. as usual. a lot has happened over the past days... NAH. i won't do it day per day. just the highlights.      &nbsp;    let's see...  well, i was lucky enough not to have classes last thursday. actually, i did-- although super bad trip. it took me more 50 minutes to reach UPDiliman. and guess what... i only had 10 minutes of class. putek. pinakopya lang kami ng exercises. di man lang nag-check ng attendance. di ba nakakapikon yun? sana di na ko pumasok. putek. then i had to meet with kevin choy pa for the program sa despedida ni dandan. ok lang... tok us only 20 mins. to talk about it.     &nbsp;   let's jump to saturday. the day of the despedida. i  virtually  freed myself that day just to prepare. unfortunately, the SMMS tourney in WR lacked adjudicators. they called me up just to adj. that was around 11:30AM. i was planning to go with vic at 1:00PM to buy the drinks for the despedida. pero siyempre, na postpone yun. when i got to Woodrose, bale... Round 2 agad. the number of adjes was just enough. so i was a lone judge! cool. my first time to actually do that. i judged the debate with Amado and Anjo's sisters. ok naman. not that hard to adj. pero giving oral adjudication is pretty hard. not as easy as you think. especially since it was my first time to do so! buti na lang 2 rounds lang... and ung last round was silent pa. so no need to give my comments. nakakatamad na nga mag adj nun eh. really bored. and was really worried.     &nbsp;   then people kept calling me up during the speeches. nakakahiya naman sa kanila. i was kinda rude to actually tell them to pls. wait for a while because it was an emergency. nagka leche leche pa ko. nakalimutan ko pa ung order ng speakers.     &nbsp;    oh yeah.  i didn't eat lunch. i was in such a hurry kasi.     &nbsp;   the debates ended at 5:00PM, so i rushed to get home. luckilyk, it wasn't traffic. i was back in less than 20 mins. it actually gave me enough time to prepare. tapos umaambon ambon pa. i wanted the tables outside, coz i wanted it to be a garden party. ang pangit pangit kung sa loob.     &nbsp;   then people started arriving at around 7:00PM. nauna sila anjo, amado, vic, bonz, dave. the tables were outside. and then dandan arrived at aroun 8:00PM. konti pa rin lang tao nun. by 8:30PM, madami nang tao. naubos ung beer agad. the food was fine. ok lang. kaya lang nagpa deliver pa ng pizzas coz ninoy and tonton di nagdala ng food. basta. tinulak pa ko sa pool. naka white pa naman. kaya medyo see-through. pfft. then i didn't eat dinner pa. di na nga naglunch, di pa nagdinner. isang slice lang ng pizza kinain ko.  then i drank tequila pa.  so it was really hot. my stomach was churning already.     &nbsp;   then ang ingay ingay na by 11:30. everyone was singing and all. parang mga lasing. driggs came, by the way. basta. dami pang nangyari. nakakatamad na ikwento lahat. i was just too tired, too exhausted. i really put all my efforts and energy into pulling the despedida all together... i know dan appreciated it, but i don't think it was enough. inutus-utusan pa ko mag picture picture. pero siyempre, it's his party. be nice. be extra-nice.&nbsp;  basta.

        what a way to start the week . the driver took a day-off today, and so i had to drive by myself. i brought karen's car, the golden civic, since it was automatic. i didn't have a good feeling about this. lo and behold. at around 8:15, along C-5, the U-turn slot going to greenmeadows...  *bam*.  nabangga ako. galing noh? anyway... the car i hit was medyo bulok, and the bumper kinda... you know... fell-off. good thing he only asked for minimal charges-- 500 bucks to be exact; padadala nya na lang daw sa  latero . and the damage to my car... erm... let's not talk about that.  i kinda didn't have gana na to go to school... well, i attended my first class, Math 17, and i got there just on time. di ako na-late. then after that... i decided to cut the rest of the day... since i wasn't able to tell my parents yet. i just stayed with sila nix and gabby in the condo and ate lunch in bentobox.  went home na after that... watched "you got served". medyo walang kwentang movie. and now im sleepy. later dayz... zzzzzzzz.....  oh, last thing. karen still doesn't know.   greetings to samara cruz! Happy Birthday!!!! :)

        haha.  we had a meeting today for dandan's despedida on the 17th. it's cool that people are actually working hard for this party. we were able to decide on the food, the program, the invitations, etc. but we're still having a problem where to get the funds to sustain this event into a fun one.   on my way to the meeting, i had nothing to think of. haha. except for the fact that i was able to create a name for this committee--  D-doc .  Stands for Dandan Despedida Organizing Committee . hahahahaha!!!!!!!! weird. anyway... we're doing our best!!! it's pretty hard. napikon pa si nix sa kin coz i wouldn't want him to help... labo niya kasi minsan eh!    oh yeah .  had lunch with krizelle. it was so awkward. i almost wished di kami natuloy. it was simply bad. she's changed now. she's just too different... i was even calling her  bitch  for her bitchy attitude. i kinda didn't wanna talk much. so there.

       whoopee. it's the first of july. almost a month since i first tasted the college life. and almost 2 days since i posted my last thoughts. i realized-- yeah. nakakatamad. so i know what to do now, i'll post whenever i feel like posting. i won't force it on myself to post everyday.  quite impossible din naman.  so... hmm. highschool sucks-- well at least southridge and woodrose do! 2 consecutive days of no classes?! sussss.... e kami nga bumabagyo na may pasok pa! all the more,  may test pa .  i thought i didn't do well in that stupid math test... heck, i think i'm one of the highest. yabaaaaang... hehe. basta i'm quite happy i answered everything almost correctly... just not sure with the true or false. *gulp* but anyhooo.... erm. i think that's just about it.  tamad e.   besides, i've got nothing to say anyway! yey. friday tomorrow. lapit na july 27...
