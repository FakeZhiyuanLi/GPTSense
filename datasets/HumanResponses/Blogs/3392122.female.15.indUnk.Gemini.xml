      hello darlings.  i've decided that i need to write more in this blog.  i use my livejournal too much to write about  cameron , and apparently people are getting sick of it, so i shall use this to talk about him!  i don't like blog, i don't know how to say what music i'm listening to or what kind of mood i'm in! it's just not as fun.  so i'll just have to do it this way:  mood * tired music * AFI - god called in sick today  i love that song.  can't get enough of it. kind of like  cameron ! can't get enough of him. haha.  i don't think that it's healthy to like someone more than they like you.  oh well.  i'll just have to be unhealthy.  oh amanda! time for an inside joke! "oh my god it's a  cameron " lily whips head around searching for a cameron "oh wait, that's a  camellion !!!!!"  that one gets me everytime. haha.  i also enjoy all of the tripping and pencil throwing stories.  oh dear! i forgot to tell you amanda!! the other day i had to go to christian mattioli to her computer class, which turns out to be  cameron 's, and the whole time i was in there he was like "HI KARESTEE!! HI KARESTEE!!" you had to be there to see it.  it was the cutest thing ever. *melts* haha. just joshin.  and i have to keep going into his health class.  too much to bear.  the other day i was wondering, i know what he's doing to me, so it isn't going to hurt that much when thigs don't happen.  but  does lily know?  or is he not doing it to her?  who would he rather be with, and why can't he just tell one of us the truth.  does he seriously think that one doesn't see the other walking down the hall with him?  just wondering.  i'm having fun by making  cameron  bold everytime i say  cameron .  ok, i'm really tired.  must get recommended hours of sleep! haha. night amanda.

      hello kids.  i hate first entries.  always so akward.  it's really weird because  amanda  told me to  get a blog  with her about five minutes ago, and now i have one.  not so weird i guess.  i'm just extremely tired.  i don't know what to do now!  this is all very new to me.  today was a very long day at school.  it's getting too hot outside to continue wearing pants, and mr. reiger's room is the worst.    after school, i came home and was talking to  michelle , and she  made me cry .  i dont normally cry, becuase i hate crying, but what she said really hurt.  probably because of how true it is.  oh well.  i'll get over it.  eventually.  i guess i oughta mention something about  cameron .  i'm almost positive that he's just  leading me on .  as much as i don't want to believe this, and try to convince myself otherwise, the thought continues to linger in the back of my mind.  for the time being, it shall stay there.  doesn't my life sound just grand.  ehh.  i'm very tired, and should be heading off to bed about now.  i can hear it calling.

      music: streetlight manifesto - a moment of silence mood: hot! it's 90 degrees out!  hey losers! i just checked my thermometer and it reads 90.2 degrees.  no wonder i'm so damn hot. plus i have a sunburn, so that's not really helping much.   oh my fucking god. the most horrible thing just happened. last night mike was supposed to meet michelle and i at the y around 8:45 and when we showed up he wasn't there, so we were of course pissed off. i was just talking to mackenzie and i found out that one of his friends got in a car accident last night! now i feel really really bad. i dont' really have much else to say.  it's a nice day to lie on the couch and do nothing, so i think i might do just that.   see ya.

      listening to:  goldfinger - 99 red balloons mood:  bored as hell  hey yo! is it yo? is it yo? don't pull that wigger shit on me yo! haha.  lacey and michelle would get it. maybe manda will, if i told you the story. haha.  i think i should it's pretty funny.  well . . . michelle, lacey, and  i  were all downtown with matt, matt, and  mike  when kyle essik and kyle simpson came walking by, looking like jackasses as usual.  kyle simpson was wearing a visor turned to the side.  gathers goes "why is his hat off to the side?" and kyle simpson goes "i wear my hat . . . to the side . . . because it's cool . . . yo" oh man was that the wrong thing to say. well  mike  goes "is it cool yo? is it cool yo? oh, don't pull that wigger shit on me, YO!!!!"  and matt bryant goes "is it cool yo?" in a really hugh pitched voice.  it was soooo funny.  oh the wonders of the bryants.  YESTERDAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY!!! I'M FIFTEEN YEARS OLD, FINALLY!!!  anyways, michelle and matt made-out on friday.  man was that akward.  so yesterday was my birthday and the only thing that  mike  said to me was "happy birthday karestee".  is that all that i get on my fucking birthday?  i guess so.  oh well.  musn't dwell.  all in all yesterday was a good day.  oh yes, on more thing.  i don't think i really like cameron anymore.  he's just going to go off with lily in the end anyways, so there's no need to put my feelings out there just to get them hurt.  i like  mike  way too much anyways.  good evening.
