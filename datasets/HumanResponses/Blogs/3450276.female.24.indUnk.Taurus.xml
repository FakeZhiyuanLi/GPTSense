      You never know how much your life means until it flashes before your eyes. It happened to me more then once this weekend. I have never seen a tornado before. The four of us had just got done eating dinner and went to sit around the fire, when it started to rain.  We took shelter, thinking it would pass. Chris got up to check it out after a little while. He said "We are going."  That is when it hit. We tore at the polls to take down the tent.  That is when a huge gust of wind threw Chris and Amy's tent on ours.  It took three of us to flip the tent over.  I started to grab things to load in the car, handing them to Darren in a chain fashion. After we had loaded our car, we went to help Chris and Amy because their tent was so heavy. We drove to the gates of the campground to find them closed.  They had them locked down.  The owners said we could not go because we had vandalized their property trying to get our stuff together. Chris grabbed the fence and tore it open so we could leave. There was a funnel cloud behind us! It followed for about half an hour as we drove away.  It was scary. But this was not the first time we were almost caught in a tornado this weekend.  One touched down in a small town only 6 minutes after we left it.  Maybe we should have taken this as a hint to go home. But long weekend + booze = not so smart. Next time we are going to watch The Weather Channel before we go anywhere.  Even to the damn variety store.

                    Being in love with you is like               smelling springs first new blossoms               as if for the very first time.                Being in love with you is like               seeing the world through a baby's eyes               and marvelling at all of it's beauty.                Being in love with you is like               Feeling every sensation from textures and                temperatures.                  Being in love with you is like               hearing a magnificent orchestra play               and thinking it is the most amazing sound               ever created.                Being in love with you is like               tasting the most delicious sweet fruit ever                grown.                Being in love with you is like               nothing I have ever known               and more wonderful than I could ever                imagine.                your love, your kindness,               your willingness to give yourself               without reservation have made me                relize that I'm in Love for the                very first time and the last time               in my life.

                           You are my heartbeat,                      You are my strength.                      You are the only true love I know,                      I am yours until the end.                       You saved me from all of the heartache,                      You wiped away my tears.                      You kissed away the bad dreams,                      And blew away my fears.                       Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you.                      To know you- is to know a mystery.                      To hold you- my one true wish                      And to kiss your lips softly, oh...                      you are what true love is.                       Others can't understand it,                      How we fell so fast.                      Showing all the people                      That our love over comes our past.                       So now it comes time,                      to prove this love so true.                      Test after test, we show others                      That were stronger togther                      Stronger then we ever knew.                       You are my other half,                      the missing link of me.                      You complete my sould,                      like no other can be.

                          I never saw...                     Until I looked into your eyes.                      I never heard...                     Until you whispered my name.                                          I never felt...                     Until you held my hand.                      I never loved...                     Until you opened my heart.

                     I had locked the door upon my heart,                And wouldn't let anyone in.                I had trusted and loved only to hurt.                But that would never happen again.                I took the key and tossed it,                As hard and as far as I could.                Love would never enter there again,                My heart was closed for good.                Just when I thought that tiny key,                Was impossible to find.                You came along and found my heart...                And made me change my mind.                You held out your hand and proved to me,                That I was very wrong.                For inside your palm was the key yo my heart,                You had it all along.

                    When you read these words,               Chances are that I'll be sitting here               Thinking of you...               as I so often do.                I'll probably be smiling               one of those smiles that I always do               When thoughts of you come my way.                When you read these few words,               I hope you'll think               Just for a moment,               how much you mean to me,               and how much you always will.                And when you continue on with things               You need to be doing in your day,               Smile a smile for me, and remember                that I'll be thinking of you still.
