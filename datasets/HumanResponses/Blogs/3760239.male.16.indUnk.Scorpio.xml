      Okay, this is going to be a really short entry, since I just thought of something..  Anyways.  I'm cruising, looking for nothing in particular, when all of a sudden this ad pops up in front of me.  It materializes out of nowhere, and displays what else, but some hot girl's ass.  Immediately I was drawn to her luciuous behind, but then quickly caught myself because I thought; "I'm being attracted to a girl's ass for no reason other than it looks real good, I have no idea what she's selling, but all I can say (and I know this is wrong) is that, man, whatever it is, I want some.."  So then I think, whoever thought up this advertisement for their product sure knew what they were doing!  I never even saw words describing what she's selling, I just knew I had to get it!  Man, people, or maybe just me, are so gullible its crazy..  I guess this entry is longer than I thought it to be.  Oh well, thank god for unlimited writing space.

        The other day as I was watering my dry, dead, lawn, I looked around at all the other houses around the block, and finally decided that I would start to do something about it..  Everyday, when the other people in the neighborhood get home from work, they immediately go outside and mow the lawn, trim hedges, build a wall, etc., while over at my house, we get home, and do nothing.   I thought, if they can all do it, so can I.  So I did.  All this week and last, I've been working on the yards, but to no end..  Each of the families around us has several kids, so the parents all send the kids to do the work,  but over here, there's only me, so it takes a lot longer than expected.  As I was chopping up some plants that thought they could live again, I realized that it wouldn't really matter how much work I did on the yard, or how much anyone did on any yards at all.  Ever.  Because no matter what, the plants, and dirt will keep on coming back.  And they'll come back even if we all pave it over with cement and build a parking structure, they will still manage a way to find a crack in the wall or ground, and split apart the powerful works that people pride themselves over.  And eventually, the cement will turn back into crumbly dirt, overtaken by the plants, as they feed upon it, forever growing and conquering.

      I don't know what the thing is with all these little motor scooters and bikes that some people have.  For about a year now, one day can't go by without someone on a bike racing up and down the street for several hours.  A couple people that live around us have these things, and they always seem to come out as soon as it gets dark.  They ride them up and down the same street, never seeming to tire from it.  Man those things are loud!  Its kind of funny, because the parents all have the big ATVs and go off for the weekend, out to the desert or somewhere, while the kids stay home and do the yard work.  Then, when the ATVs get back, its the kid's job to wash them and all that, while the parents just hang out, drink some beer, just chillin.  Funny.  The other day though, I saw this sign that explicitly said those bikes are illegal to use.  Yet right in front of the sign, was a guy out selling about 4 of those things, and doing a pretty good job of it too! Oh well, whatver.. Just the irony of where I live.

      In two days I leave for a vacation in Bermuda for ten days, so excited!  It takes practically all day to fly there; so we have to wake up at 2:30a.m. just to get to the airport 2 hours before the flight.  I really dont know why we have to get there so early since we probly have the earliest flight out of Ontario anyways..  So ten days lying on the beach doing absolutely nothing!  Pretty much all I do anyway, though this time it'll be several thousand mile away.  Supposedly there's some great spots to snorkle and just hang out in the water, so that'll be cool.  My great friends keep reminding me of the Bermuda Triangle, trying to freak me out so they can take my place I guess.. I just hope that the plane doesn't overshoot the landing, since the island is only about a mile wide in some places.  But man, I hope there's some good turbulence on the way in; I love that kind of stuff!  I always pretend we're going to die, put up my hands like on a roller coaster, fun!

      I find it really ironic how a city will set up literally hundreds of booths for selling fireworks, then post even more signs displaying how illegal it is to own any fireworks in the first place.  It all seems very strange to me.  I suppose that the city is trying to give its people what they want, but in the same sense, its also creating a danger for both those who buy the works, and those who live in the city.  Where I live, its illegal to own, sell, etc fireworks of anykind, yet, for the past month or so, every day sounds like the middle of a war zone.  It's pretty funny though; most of the people end up buying their supplies from Mexico, then shooting them off in front of their house later on.  Nobody seems to buy them where they live, the only legal works are those that just spin around on the ground, and who wants that when you could simply jump over the border and buy the same ones that Disneyland uses every night?

       So my week's been kind of crazy and all.  One day I'll do a lot of stuff, then the next, I'll do absolutely nothing at all... I love it!  So Friday I went over to Newport with some friends.  Usually takes barely forty minutes to get there from my house, but because a couple of crackheads got in an accident on the freeway, we were stuck for more than an hour.  L.A. traffic totally sucks.  Anyways, once we got there and found a bloody place to park, man, it was great!  This guy we know was renting a beach house that's right on the beach, and I mean right there!  So we just chilled, grilled some chicken and hung out for hours.  We went down to the water, it was packed, but still pretty cool!  Ha!  This one woman had like five little kids and just her; they kept freakin her out by trying to swim wayyy out, the lifeguard eventually had to go out to stop them!  It was hilarious!  We stayed on the beach till around seven or so, then went over to the local Hooters for some "dinner".  That was cool..  Later, we go back over to the house, and just chill out there for a couple more hours, cruisin around the harbor a bit.  Finally we had to leave, tried to crash at the guys house, but he was just way too tired to want to deal with it, so we left like, 11, 11:30, I dont know...  But it was cool, been a while since I've even seen some of those guys we hung out with..  That's the way things are!

      While going through customs in Bermuda, I noticed that there are actually two different terminals.&nbsp; No big suprise some people might say, but the difference between the two is that if a person if flying to the U.S., they take one terminal, but going to Canada, the U.K. or anywhere else, they take the other terminal.&nbsp; I didn't really think much of it after that..&nbsp; But then I realized that the reason there is a U.S. place different from the others is because of the new security.&nbsp; Everyone knows that, supposedly, the U.S. has higher security now.&nbsp; So going through all the customs, everywhere I looked I saw the "Homeland Security" logo along with its stupid little sayings that its 'protecting the country for the good of generations'.&nbsp; Campy sort of quotes and all..&nbsp; 'Course, just last year the island was hit by a hurricane, pretty much destroying the airport, yet its amazing they were able to restore the customs area back to normal in no time at all..&nbsp; And I thought, it really is almost funny how the U.S. gets its own terminal simply because of new restrictions that the government put out.&nbsp; Almost adding a false sense of security, because as soon as you leave the customs area, there are several stores and restaurants that hold within them items like nail clippers, lighters, knives, etc.&nbsp;things that could practically get someone arrested if they brought them through customs, but are sold right before boarding the plane.. Yea, these "security measures" are ridiculous, considering that you could choke someone to death using only a wire hidden in a cd player, or knock them out with the amazing tool of a fist...

      While up in near Sacramento recently, I went out on this boat with some of my family.&nbsp; Well they all wakeboard out on the numerous lakes and rivers up north, and always ask me if I want to try it too.&nbsp; Usually I say no, that I'll just hang back here and be the 'flag dude' or something like that, since I'm more interested in just swimming around or catching rays then being dragged along&nbsp;on a&nbsp;rope.&nbsp; So finally I decide to give wakeboarding a try, and man, that was.. crazy..&nbsp; It looked easy at first, I thought I had a pretty good grasp on what to do, but once that boat started going, I just got ripped all along the water.&nbsp; I must have tried like, at least a dozen times to get up on top of the thing, until eventually, my feet were numb from the bindings, and water was so far up my nose, I had difficulty hearing!&nbsp; But man, in some kind of weird, pyschedelic way, getting dragged for a good solid 15-20 minutes through the water was really..exhilerating.&nbsp; It was pretty cool, except right about then, my leg got this amazing cramp in it, and I lost the feeling in my forearms from the rope being yanked from my hands so much..&nbsp;That was the end of it then. &nbsp;So now, two days after we went out, I still can barely even make a fist without experiencing this dull pain in my arms..&nbsp; Its doubtful that I'll strap myself up again, but who knows?&nbsp; I certainly don't anymore.

      There seems to be no actual reason for life, other than for it to be questioned, or simply, enjoyed.  Whatever a person may make of it, it is always true that within a group, we are connected to each other, but as individuals, we strive to each be unique in our own ways.  None of us is the same, yet we all belong somewhere.
