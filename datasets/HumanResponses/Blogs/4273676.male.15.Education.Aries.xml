      Today I woke up around 9:45, didn't get to sleep until after 3 am...I watched TV/went online and then had lunch around 12..hot dog. Took a shower around 2...don't feel like doing any of my work today..tomorrow I have to help my uncle with some aluminum wheel thing..  I don't know what else I'm going to do today. Bored. But oh well. Hopefully my Polo stuff will come this week.

      Today was..Sunday. I half-woke up early in the morning, my mom was going to some kind of rummage sale and had to tell me that she had some kind of bite on her arm that looked like the Eiffel tower. I then fell asleep again and woke up to the phone ringing at 10:45 or so. Again, my mom, asking if I wanted anything from ShopRite. Then I sat for about 15 minutes wondering if the whole half-asleep scenario in which my mom told me about an Eiffel tower bite actually occured, because that's kind of bizarre and is one of those things you think when you're half-asleep.  So I got some TAB. Worst stuff ever...NOTHING like Diet Coke, because it has saccharin in addition to the aspartame, and so it tastes identical to regular coke...YUCK.  Then I stopped at my Uncle's because my mom needs to store some medicine cabinet there that there is no room for here until it can be hung up. He wasn't home but came as we left so I got a piece of chicken. And now apparently I have to go haul some aluminum wheels, but that's okay because there is money/food in it and I shall hopefully be free from the clutches of Academic Peril: US History. For now, at least.  So then we picked up my mommom and we went to see my dad, and then went to Olive Garden. Good..I had manicotti. Jeff, the server, was a little incompetent. He forgot to ask if we wanted cheese on the entrees, which I certainly didn't, but stilllll................and we discussed Maryjane, my ex-Aunt, and about how she can come 1200 miles but refuse to visit my father because she insists upon escorting her 27 year old LOSER son around the city of Philadelphia. I mean, come on - anyone who is 27 and scans bags at the airport? In a commission that's going to be disbanded soon? No relatives of mine.  Then I went home and nothing else really happened. I was going to get some stuff from AE online, but I didn't really feel like it. Too expensive when a polo and 4 tees costs you 80 bucks (after 20% off)....for what it is, anyway....  So I had this idea about joining a rogue Catholic church. Because even though I hate what Catholocism has become, I really do like it. So I need to find some kind of church. With married priests and everything completely against the status quo of the R.C. church. I guess I just need to find one.  I realize it's after midnight, so please forgive me for the improper tense. I'm going to go now, AP tomorrow and such! And I need to fix a door..eesh!

      I woke up to the phone ringing, it was my mom. She went to yard sales and then picked up breakfast from McDonalds..yummy hotcakes and sausage! Then I helped her assemble this bedroom furniture, which was okay...burnt off the breakfast! haha  Then I went to K-mart,..when I came out it looked like a hurricane. Went to lunch at Houlihan's where I had a side caeser salad and some buffalo fingers. Then I went to staples, where I got 3 binders, 12 packs of looseleaf, a box of mechanical pencils, white out pens, and highlighters. Then I went to wal-mart, followed by a visit to the court in King of Prussia to get a homework book thingy from the Franklin Covey store like the ones they used to give us...but they didn't have any so the guy took my contact info..  Then, over to the thomas kinkade gallery because my mom wants me to help her find a picture for the dining room,. but it's a bunch of overpriced CRAP. Then to the New Balance store for sneakers for school, but I didn't really like much there. Plus, there is this psychotic woman who tried to tell me I didn't wear a 13 last time and was pretty rude. She's the owner's sister or something so he wont' fire her, just like that episode of home improvement.  Next, I went in Macy's to look at the Polo stuff and I saw a rugby I liked and some stuff, and then I had to go to COSTCO, which wasn't too great..we got a new telephone system thing.  Then I went home and ordered some stuff from Polo online since I can get tall sizes through them, although I'll have to check out the outlet sometime. Here's what I got:       Then I came home, talked to some people online..like BRYN, the polo queen, who never heard of the one with the tiger. haha  Paul  EDIT: I DON'T THINK THE PICS ARE WORKING :-

      So today I got a late start, woke up around 10. Went to lunch at the same place again, but with my mom since she wanted to try it..hey, you can't pass up a free lunch! Anyway, then I got home around 2:30..I haven't done much today. I was supposed to do my AP US this afternoon but I didn't get around to it. I'll try to read a little bit, but I'm tired..and think I'll be better off doing it tomorrow. I still have two weeks for two more chapters (could do them in one day if I wanted to) and Tortilla Flat and I don't really have any reason to finish the bookwork by tomorrow, but I'll try. As long as I get it done by next Thursday, which is the earliest possible date for the book/work discussion with Charles and Ed,  I'll be fine. But I don't know what's going on with Charles. Other than that, I'm ready to go back.  After making a post on the College Confidential message board, someone was kind enough to send me a GMAIL INVITATION! It's awesome. Major props to Evan for letting me know about it and Mozilla Firefox and all that jazz...LOL.  I feel like watching SEINFELD! I'll write more tomorrow.   Paul

      Well, I've made the official switch from xanga to Blogger. I love Blogger because the posting interface is a lot nicer and has some of xanga's premium features. I also want GMAIL, how selfish of me. But this feels more like a blog and less like a fad. xanga is to a blog what AOL is to the internet - this feels less restricted. I like it.  Today was a good day. I woke up early and watched some television. Then I went out to lunch with my uncle and grandfather and this man named Phil. We call his wife Mrs. Hitler, don't ask. Then I went home and I tackled Chapter 1 of the history. I found out some of it wasn't required, WHAT A RELIEF!! Tonight I went to Target for TAB, but they didn't have it. Then I went to Starbucks and I saw some liberal ads that were..interesting. Check out the site,  urlLink http://www.metrovsretro.org   I like this better than xanga. And I will still talk about politics despite the fact I "can't make a shit of difference in the world." You don't make a difference in the world drinking soda and buying cheap clothes that aren't even made in this country, besides only increasing sweat shop/child labor...
