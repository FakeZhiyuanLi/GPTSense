      With a sudden influx of unexplained health issues this year, combined with the new Cadillac health insurance plan at work, I've been sort of a lab rat this year, fairly whimsically getting stuff tested. Airborne allergies, various swabs, tinkering with my anxiety med, naturopathic investigation, ultrasounds for this and that (they charged me my deductible for that, but I would have had to have paid it anyway, so I'm glad it was applied toward something).&nbsp;Today I went for my annual girl junk, they asked if I wanted to check for STD's while I was there.&nbsp;I figured why not. Given how defensive I am of my emotions, I haven't exactly had any semblance of a sex life in Seattle. So it's really just for the quasi-pride of having proof that I'm completely ok. So paranoid of STD's I am, I even have a fairly elaborate fantasy about what I would do to a guy if he gave me one. It involves bondage and rubber bands.  It seems easy to become a hypochondriac given the right circumstances.   Up until about a year ago, I had a fairly serious phobia of doctors. I still feel siginificant panic if I have to go to a different type of doctor than I've been to before. But only the first time.  [I was also terrified of improv - I auditioned for Jet City a few weeks after I moved here just to find out what an improv audition was like. Cried hysterically before I left. Ridiculous. Nearly fell over crying I was so frightened. Whatever, I went, made it through it and met my friend the Divine Ms. Impala. I auditioned for UP, the oldest theatresports troupe in the US, last year as well. That wasn't as bad. But not as fun either. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was lethargic.]   Dentists, on the other hand, never had any problem whatsoever. Even when I went under to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth out, no nervousness at all. They administer the general via IV, you start counting backwards, feel a pins and needles sensation, and you just disappear for a while. While I was going out, the anaesthesiologist and the NP were talking about the Eskimos. (The CFL kicks ass. Doesn't take much American foobah to recognize that.) When&nbsp;I started to come to&nbsp;in recovery stuffed with cotton, on my side, the nurses were talking hockey. But for me there'd been no sense of the passage of time. It's not even like what happens in normal sleep. So all I could do was wonder why they were suddenly talking about the fuckin Oilers (I hate hockey), and where the anaesthesiologist had gone, and had I finished counting backwards from 100?&nbsp;Then you wake up more fully, they bring your mommy in, make you finish your IV, give you gingerale to get your blood sugar up, and send you on your merry bloodied way. My mom propped me up in the back seat of her car. She loves to find Dr. Laura on the radio. I frankly can't stand the ho. I think the proliferation of such obnoxious sources of criticism&nbsp;actually encourages people to do stupid things rather than deter them. It encourages a sort of societal codependancy. So through masses of cotton and swelling I remember incomprehensibly trying to slam all her silly comments. My mom was just apalled that I was conscious enough to be talking.  Odd that there's an hour or so of my life that I can't retrieve any memory of. Even if it did involve someone sort of destroying the inside of my mouth. It must be scary to drink to the point of blacking out. I don't think I would handle that well. I'm pretty meticulously aware of my surroundings.&nbsp;And I've only booze barfed once. 4 vodka tonics at the Crocodile was all that took.&nbsp;I usually fall asleep or just decide to contentedly buzz far before&nbsp;I manage to ingest that much.

      I'm about ready to take jackhammer to the fuse in the box that's labelled 'SUMMER.'   35C. I've got water bottles scattered everywhere as ammunition. It didn't really work.

      It is 33 degrees here right now.   My desk job life is officially over.  I just ran my head under a tap.  People are buying me food and I like it.  I'm down to one more week in this apartment.  Vashon Island will be beautiful.  I'm a loving one man kind of girl who knows the skinny and just don't fuck with that because I don't deserve it and over time I will make you pay.  I just ran my head under a tap and I need to do it again.  My body hurts but not as much as my stupid heart.  I'm a good writer but need more stamina.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      When boy signs email with "I miss you" I become useless puddle.  I think boy knows this, and part of reason he doesn't always say "I miss you" or something else delicious at the end of an email is to keep me from becoming deranged.  But it makes me happy anyway, because I'm a big suck.  Actually I bet boy isn't all that premediated. But it's fun to imagine that he might be.  Get me out of here.  I just can't deal with it this warm out. It's too warm for me to suck in my flab properly.   Work is fun right now. When people drop by my desk to ask if I've seen this colleague or that paperclip, I look intense and say "not recently." I've always wanted to say "No, but I heard slappy noises coming from the server room," but now, I just don't have the will to like, talk.   Too bad. They are MISSING OUT.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Why the  hell  did I buy color safe bleach? How did I get sucked into a totally useless oxymoron? There is color in two much favored articles of my clothing that I don't want in my clothing. Black ink from a Sanford Rollerball pen that I fell asleep on, to be precise.  Thus, color safe bleach puh-robably isn't going to work.  Sometimes I'm such a dumbass.  &nbsp;     It is too hot for pants.     &nbsp;  However, it's not too hot for sorbet, soymilk and my vitamins.  &nbsp;  Men do not love the same way that women do and are prone to becoming very unattractive when they try.  &nbsp;  4 more days of the ass spreader. (job)  &nbsp;  My most immense Seattle crush is coming to look at my car tomorrow. I hope it isn't intolerably weird. I thoroughly no longer find him attractive. In fact he was my first taste of the syndrome I like to call "West Coast Type B Personality Problem to my Existence." Ah, Seattle. Where deciding not to decide is a big decision. Fortunately I learned that Michael would be the LEAST of my problems that way. Oh yeah, and he finds me unattractively&nbsp;intimidating and probably too young.  GOOD. &nbsp;  Poor venhilation. One more on Marie's ever growing list of reasons why it's brilliant to have a slot for an independant&nbsp;10 minute show.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Follow the link -  My piece at Mae West Fest, July 22-25 2004 in Seattle. I wrote and am directing it. For some reason, a Ford Scholar is coming to the Festival. I'm trying to get an interview with the woman.&nbsp;I hope to got she&nbsp;isn't flippant and dull, or I will happily give her a hard time.  &nbsp;  Salvage, my newer short, did very well in Shorts Reloaded at NeXt Fest in Edmonton this year.  Yay. Morgan Smith directed, Ryan Hughes played Jacob, Matt Kloster played Douglas. Eventually Salvage will be a full length piece&nbsp;about&nbsp;Toronto's Brownstones.

      Fierce Summer Storm  Last Updated Mon, 12 July 2004 03:13:15 PM     July 11, 2004 - A  massive  cleanup is underway after a  wicked  summer storm  hammered  Edmonton. The torrential downpour turned streets into streams, and the Sunday  drive  into a nightmare. City crews had to use snowplows to clear gumball sized hail from several neighbourhoods.   The storm completely shut down the Whitemud. Fox Drive and Belgravia Road was  under  a meter of water,  submerging  several vehicles. Some people had to crawl out of their vehicles and swim to safety.  Pumping  stations worked  furiously  to remove the water on the Whitemud. The busy roadway was the  hardest  hit. This is the  second time in less than a week  and a half that the 111 Street underpass has been flooded.   It was the same scene across the city. Loonie-sized hail  pelted  down, enough to turn the sides of the roads into snow banks. Dozens of vehicles were stuck when a west end parkade  flooded . Residents watched  helplessly  as hail and water, swept through the lot. Fire crews evacuated all the residents. They estimate 30-million gallons need to be  pumped  out before people can  move back in.    Thousands of people at the  world's largest  mall were also evacuated when water started pouring down from the ceiling. "One of the roof drains  collapsed . The whole city system  couldn't handle  the water, so all the water came up through the drains. So in the flash flood we were inundated with water  concentrated  more in phase two, phase one and limited in phase three," said West Edmonton Mall General Manager Gary Hanson.   The worst of the  damage  appears to be around the Ice Palace which remains  closed . Some rides in Galaxyland are still  not running . Outside the mall wasn't much better. Backed up drains turned several parking lots into  giant  swimming pools and left many cars flooded. Damage is  expected  to be in the millions.   (Good for Edmonton. I haven't been laid since May.)

      Ok, so now I'm just waiting for Advil to kick in, then I'm going to go pick up my TENACIOUS D JERSEY from work, go buy some new jeans, a bikini or two, and pay my bills.  My plants are going wacko in here. I have a dangling Ivy plant, a Rubber Tree, two Philodendrons, and two other funny looking little tropicals that just won't die in this climate - I never grew plants in Alberta really, except fatally. But in here they go berzerk. I'm giving them all to my friend Nate, he works at POP with me.   Nate is also left handed, is a really wonderful web developer. Plays guitar and songwrites - is good. I like his stuff. But hanging around him depresses me in some ways - we feel the same about work. Nate is underpaid and micromanaged by/because of Dave, who was hired off of the competition. Dave just bought a new house. Dave takes his pets to the $20-a-day-per-dog-doggie babysitting place around the block. They have a big doggie yard and some astroturf over there. "IT'S SO GREAT!"  Fuck. Metrosexuals are blisteringly stupid. When their hyperactive Malamutes come home with Parvo and are dead the next day from the doggie who's owners forgot to get it vaccinated, because they had to go play golf, I will laugh my ass off while I shake my head. People who live in condos and apartments and insist on owning animals they neglect, aside from taking them to the groomer so they look pretty...  See, my parents are veterinarians. True, I got to play with oodles of puppies and kittens who came in for their shots. But of course, more often I grew up around very sick dogs and kitties who were in no mood to be touched. Lots of dogs and cats who's people just didn't want them so could we put them down (sometimes they were just too sweet, so we took them home. My have a lot of animals on the acreage that way). Dogs who just went balistic one day and bit someone, so bye bye. I rubbed and held tiny c-section puppies and tried to breathe life into them because their poodle mom couldn't have them properly, dad being the pit bull down the street, owner can't spell SPAY, or just forgot about it...puppies and kittens are TINY, and if they are born with mom under a general anaesthetic (you can't really do a ceasarean on a small animal with a local and an analgesic, like you do with people), sometimes they can't wake up. Their hearts the size of our fingernail just slowly stop.   So you can understand how I could have a lot of negative opinions abut people who keep an animal in their tiny space it's entire life because they just "CAN'T live WITHOUT him." If you can't afford at least to get your animal spayed/neutered, vaccinated yearly, and fed with the right food and or supplements, you can't afford a pet. Mostly healthy people need to be able to go to the doctor sometimes, so do mostly healthy pets.  That was a horrible tangent, but I don't care. I'm allergic to your pets, but I love them anyway. So BE NICE TO THEM.  I was talking about Nate. Nate is dealing with a DUI right now, because like a lot of 26 year old guys down on his luck, (Nate also has to pay child support, because the girl he loved when he was 18 had his baby and eventually left him), he drinks a few times a week after work. Maybe more. One night, in the U-district, he was heading back to his Subaru, and a cop in the mood to pick him off did just that, turned on his lights as he was getting in his car because he'd been seen coming out of the bar. So now Nate, who works overtime, for POP, a multimillion $ firm, is going to have to declare bankruptcy to pay a lawyer to help him deal with this, because that's the best way to avoid circumstances that would cost him his job. He's still paying off school, and with rent and bills and Maddie, another line of credit won't help him any more than that. Nate and I are kind of reasons the other hangs on at POP as it is right now.  America isn't much of a place to live for a lot of people.

      I feel like SHITE. Not the Holy kind. So yeah, I went to see the show last night, hung out with them after. Course they were smoking - I think that put my already overloaded system over the edge. I feel like I have the flu today. Not really surprised.  Funny, suddenly I notice my apartment sort of looks like a pharmacy. Omega 3's in one corner, Allergy Crap all over my kitchen from yesterday, Lexapro 10mg scattered here and there - my doc is just giving me samples, since he has tons of the crap lying around, so it's not in a neat little "look I'm FUCKED UP" orange pill bottle. Dr. Raphaely's patients love him, so the pharmaceutical companies do too - he told me as long as I get him tickets to see me at Stratford we're even. He has a slight accent from having grown up speaking Hebrew, looks as though he could be part African American. Plays Jazz Guitar and Sax. Cool guy. Does comfortably, but doesn't sweat shit.  Don't think about that Marie...  Hungnugh. Yuck.  I don't regret living here, I've made many funny weird friends and done plenty great things in a very short time, and I know I'll be missed. All you can ask for really. But shit, I don't like to feel like I need the drug store in my house to survive. TECHNICALLY, I don't, is the scary thing about living in this society...  It makes me think about Robin Johnson the crazy hypochondriac from Mayerthorpe who went everywhere with her pill bottles to belittle us with her war on the evil anti-health agents. She and my mom used to sing together at the various festivals. Too bad she's wacko, she has a beautiful voice and some interesting views on culture.

      So, after years of suffering, taking antihistamines, having side effects to them, taking different antihistamines and then having a different reaction to something else, I had allergy testing done. I had the day off, figured, hey it's a party. So these aren’t necessarily everything I’m allergic to, but they hit the main cross-allergenic types.  Cat (knew that) Dog (hives) Horse (Shit. I love my horse.) Aspergillus (a mold) Penicillium (very slight – not threatening) Alder, Birch, Oak (Pollen!) Bermuda Grass, Italian Rye, Orchard, Timothy (basically, grasses - all very bad)  My reactions to dust mites were only very slight. This is good.   I had the regular stabby and let it sink in test. I started reacting to almost everything they stuck on my arms so quickly that within two minutes it was a red lumpy mess. But it was fascinating to watch in progress nonetheless. Also had some good conversation with the nurse while she was doing the stabbing and I started swelling. She has other patients who are actors. I like to hear the stories about the ones who do industrial work three months out of a year and live off it for the rest.  As is always with me, my doctor’s response was “I’m surprised you’ve gone without management this long." I’ve had swelling and breathing wierdness for years, I think I half forget about it a lot of the time, because I've never been one for whining. And I really don’t like to rely on drugs. But I now have a whole host of options that I can take, including a rescue inhaler in case I run into a cat situation – the cats are the only thing that make my lungs swell. There was very little lower respitory involvement with any of the things they tested, so that’s good. The best thing for me I think will be the inhalent, for stress induced breathing difficulties I get – I really need to be able to improve my cardio without it being so uncomfortable to breathe so quickly. That’s usually what stops me, aside from hating the bounciness. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.   Also had a very quick consult with my Psych today, who’s been managing the GAD.  The man is such a saint. I’ve had nearly 4 months of the good med from going to him for my just my $10 copay.  I’m not on something that’s overpowering – ruled out the need for that pretty quickly. Thank god for insurance – I don’t know what would have happened to me without it. I would have gone back to live with the folks and would probably still be in the diagnosis process up there in Canada. Waiting lists for the “free” health care n’all that.  I feel kinda crappy now, all that bad stuff still workin it's way out of my system. But I usually forget all my problems on days I'm not at work (imagine that...), so time off is always a good thing.  Going to see my friend Ray Tagavilla tonight in the American Book of the Dead, at Open Circle Theatre in Fremont. Hung out with my pal Greg Bagdasaryn (from Armenia) for lunch. We had a great chat about theatre, propaganda, being culturally displaced, and how FUCKING fat Americans are.

      I'm bad. But I can't wait to own this shirt. I cannot wait.  I LOVE TENACIOUS D.  I just posted my car on about 6 different collectors sites to sell - only dropped about $100 in total...selling the car will be worth it. Am getting tired of tripping around finding the stuff to detail him with. So yes. Will be happy to get my shirt.  Must go buy used copies of plays. 4th of July...nice day...am surprised more shit isn't blowing up yet.
