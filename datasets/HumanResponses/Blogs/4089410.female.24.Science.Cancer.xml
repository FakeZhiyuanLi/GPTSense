          I wish I could say I had some lofty aim for creating a blog, but the pure and simple of it is that I'm attracted to the idea of a public venue in which to vent. I guess that's my way of putting in a disclaimer. Don't say I didn't warn you. I suppose that others find my "venting" amusing in some way, however, because if I had a dollar for every time a friend of mine suggested (unprovoked, mind you) that I write a book I would have like 3 or 4 dollars now. That'd double my life savings. So they asked for it, now they're kind of gonna get it. (If you have any beef with my blogging, their names are Andrea, Scott, and Kathleen, and you can look them up in the Boston or Philly yellow pages. Good luck.)

      Is it possible to have shallow pression?  'Cause I really don't think I have deep pression but there is definitely some amount of pression occuring.  There is a certain apathy about me these days, that seems to only be growing.

       "I haven't seen you smile like that in a long time."  "I love your accent!  Where are you from?"  "If I saw you on the street like that, I'd be intimidated."   What makes a life?  Random collections of people, words, thoughts, and actions?  The things that stick out in my mind are scattered and selective - an image of reality that can't help but be subjective.  Each recollection is biased at best, if not completely and utterly prejudiced.  It's strange to think that everything I see the world to be is a consequence of me; my world evolves around me.    ---------------------------- I've been having a hard time lately sorting out the motivations in my life.  I've just moved out of a horrendously difficult time, my first two years of med school, into a place where my talents and abilities thrive - the research laboratory.  And I have to say the movement has left me disoriented.  I've been focusing so much on where I'm going, that I can barely decipher where it is I've come from.  It really wouldn't matter but for the fact that you can't go from point "A" to point "B" if you lose "A".  I am feeling isolated from the people who I've come to call my friends over the past two years.  They've moved on to clinical years of med school, and I'm on a totally different planet.  Part of me is wanting to just cut myself off - to stop contacting these people, grow apart, and not have to deal with the effort that goes into maintaining a relationship with people you have separated from in some way.  I know it's a cop-out, but I can't help but feel it's the inevitable outcome, and that it's easier to save my energy and just forego the few years of trying in vain to keep in touch.  The problem with being a twenty-something who has never had friends good enough to feel the need to stay in touch with is that, now when I have worthwhile people in my life for the first time, I already have this learned helplessness.  A lack of will brought about by years of people who did not understand me much at all, nevermind enough to feel like my presence in their life was beneficial.  People change, people move apart, etc, etc.  I think my experience has been more building bridges to people who were already so far apart from me that my connections had no chance of weathering the flood season.  And now for the first time I've met a group of people I have felt comfortable enough to really expose myself to.  It's a little frightening to think that I could lose these outlets for unleashing myself upon the world.  And then there's the fact that I so completely love working in the lab that I'm having a hard time remembering why I even decided to go to medical school in the first place.  I know I had lofty visions of increasing my knowledge of the human body so as to have a better handle on the possible applications of my research, but c'mon now.  I think it was probably just my historical tendency to opt for the hardest possible path I can take.  I don't know what I've been trying to prove to myself all these years.  Honestly, the thought of going out on the wards and having to work with patients scares the bejesus out of me.  And there's a chance that's just beuase I've known I wasn't going to have to do it this year and haven't mentally prepared myself for it, but there's also the chance that I really won't ever relish the idea.  That will add up to very LONG third and fourth years of medical school.  Hopefully these bothersome thoughts are as many of my worries tend to be - premature.
