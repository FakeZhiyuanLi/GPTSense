      Hey,    Went with Luke to see Dodgeball yesterday....That was an awesome movie!! So many funny lines to quote, but so many sexual references in them. Can't really put down too many here. Then I found out that Karen might not be able to come down as she was going to, but that's fine with me, cause the new plan is less stress on me anyway. Don't have a whole lot of time, so I'll write more later......

      what's up,      well, I'm playing poser on this one.....Luke and Karen both have one of these things, so I decided it sounded like fun... Right now, I'm still trying to get into Liberty University, with chances growing slimmer and slimmer with every day that goes by. If Grandma and Grandaddy can cosign my student loan, then I'll be good, otherwise, I'll have to go to good ole' Johnston Community College. Hm... Some basic things about me.... I'm 17 at the moment, Male, born in Atlanta GA (Go Braves), lived in Raleigh and the surrounding places about all of my life.....Best Friends are Luke Jarmin, Brittney Sharp(who abandoned me to go out to Arkansas for college...still love her though....lol), Karen Brown(who I'm kinda in a relationship with) Patrick Bryan(currently serving at the United States Millitary Academy at West Point) Matt Brewer, Courtney Gaiver, My sister Leigh, and others that I don't have time to name. Got alot on my mind today, as you'll find out I always do.... I'll write more later....

      I know what I have to do in my relationship aspect, but as the title of this thing intels, I don't want to do it. Let's see, about today....Last night I wrote Patrick a letter, which is something that I have been wanting to do for a while. So I have to print it out and send it to him. Then this morning, my sister and I went outside to play baseball a little, and try to get me ready for the softball tournament I have on saturday. Then I came inside and just ate and waited until I had to go to work. Then after work, I came home and played baseball with my little brother Ralph. So now I'm updating this thing waiting on the Cubs game to come on, since I can't watch the Braves game tonight. Just a random comment here, I can't wait until the NFL season starts. I'm going to love to watch Terrell Owens and Freak playing for Philadelphia this season. I have all confidence that I'll be wanting to go to the superbowl in January, cause that's where the Eagles will be. Not the Redskins, or the Cowboys, or the Panthers, The EAGLES!!! Gotta get off here, update tomarrow......

      Hello, Wow, it has been forever since I’ve had a chance to update this thing. Well, so much has been going on that it’ll take me forever to write it all down. Well, my search for a way into Liberty University has come to an end today. The only chance that I had into the University this semester died in my face today. So it looks like I’ll be spending another 4 months in the care of Johnston County education, which is a definite hit on the relationship that I’ve been involved in since camp. Which had another huge strain on it in the form of my mother. And it’s not the first time she’s done that. So right now I don’t know what to do about the relationship, she says that she won’t give me up, and that she’ll do anything to keep me, but this is hurting her a lot more than the alternative would. I don’t know what to do about it, which shouldn’t surprise, because of the name of this site. Still praying about it. And as far as church is concerned, I now see a reason to go again, which is something that I haven’t had since the beginning of last year. It’s hard to go and really worship and get into everything, when you are constantly wanting to smack the youth pastor. The ridiculous things I’ve heard in the past year could last me a lifetime. But now that I’ve met and spent time with Grant, the singles pastor, staying here for a while might not be the worst thing that could happen. I definitely need to get closer to God before I leave, since I want to go into the ministry. So many things in life are so hard to see, so many things are shadows, sometime it’s hard to find light. But I have to sign off here…. Update later…….
