       Well, its been a while since my last post.&nbsp; Not that I have been busy and&nbsp;haven't had time, believe me, that's not the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;   So&nbsp;I bought the Ashlee Simpson CD (insert forehead scrunch here).&nbsp; I know, I know, seems adolescent, but shoot, I'm allowed to have those moments.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;at that inbetween stage where I'm too&nbsp;old to&nbsp;wear Wet Seal clothes, and too&nbsp;young for Ann Taylor.&nbsp; So I'm gonna go with feeling young, rather than old, if that's alright.&nbsp; I liked the single "Pieces of Me" I heard on the radio, and I must admit I watched the show and decided it would be a worthy purchase.&nbsp; Come on, you know you watch it too, and you like it!&nbsp; So suprisingly enough, the CD is actually pretty good.&nbsp; A lot of the time I find myself judging my liking of&nbsp;a CD by how much I can relate the lyrics to my own&nbsp;life.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is my problem...I'm not sure if it is OK for me to be feeling the same feelings as a 19 year old rich girl when I am almost 24 and severely lacking in abundant funds (though I somehow managed to scrape up $10.99 for the CD).&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also had&nbsp;the same issues with relating to Avril Lavinge songs,&nbsp; but you know what I have come to realize?&nbsp; Everyone in this world&nbsp;shares the commonality of that one special feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't&nbsp;matter how young or old, how rich or how poor.&nbsp; It starts with that middle school crush, and&nbsp;continues through&nbsp;a golden anniversary.&nbsp; That one special person who makes our heart melt, who knows us better than we know ourselves, and wants to be there to pick us up when we fall.&nbsp; We all yearn to find that person and&nbsp;feel the big "L".&nbsp; We can all relate to songs about wanting, loving, hurting - the basic structure of almost every song ever written, no matter the time period.&nbsp; It's an age old practice that keeps us going, wanting, loving, and is worth the hurting.&nbsp; We live in a world that&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;surrounded by the&nbsp;feeling,&nbsp;yet why is it ironically so hard to find?&nbsp; I think maybe we try too hard,&nbsp;or when it's there we overlook it or get scared and turn and run the other way...   Open up your eyes  Don't you know you only get one life...  All you gotta do  Is just Surrender   -Ashlee Simpson

       So I heard on the radio this morning that FOX is going to start a new cable channel that will show reality TV 24/7.  OH BOY!  Just what I've always wanted!  I mean, I just can't get enough!  Who doesn't like watching REAL people lead REAL lives, lives we could only DREAM of leading ourselves.  Personally, I live vicariously through the life of Paris Hilton, because I want to be just like her!  What a great role model!  I mean, I can TOTALLY relate to her life style and she is so smart too!  In all seriousness though, do we really need an entire channel devoted to reality shows?  It seems like every network is smothering us with them every night as it is.  Last night while I was flipping through channels, I had to choose from Who wants to Marry my Dad, Big Brother 5, or Real World re-runs. I finally resorted to putting in my DVD of Sex and the City, true quality television.  Though it can be quite forward at times, the writing is tremendously witty and the acting top notch.  Far more entertaining than watching women cry over men they have know collectively for 3 hours.  I think I have rolled my eyes over reality TV shows more than I did when I was 16 and watched the "cool girls" walk down the halls on Friday's with their matching "Pink Ladies" hot pink wind pants on.  BARF.  When is the craze going to end??  There has to be a breaking point where everyone throws up their hands in disgust over the fake love affairs and gag producing stunts on Fear Factor.  Whoever thought we would live in a society where people would eat cow brains for cash and to score their 15 seconds of fame? Believe me, if I were famous, that is DEFINITELY what I would want to be famous for.  Hey!  You're the girl who ate those cow brains!  Uh, thanks, but no thanks.  I'll just sit here on my couch and drink a Bud Light...a product with a slogan we should all aspire to be...Fresh.  Smooth.  REAL.

       True.com is one of the newest online dating services available to those, in my opinion, desperate single people who must succumb to the depths of meeting strangers through cyberspace.  Sounds scary to me.  So, my boss gets a lead and decides to look into the service to see if they can become one of our clients.  This meaning, he will try to get them to advertise on our radio stations.  I'm in his office talking to him about it, and he decides he needs to "familiarize" himself with the potential client and sign up for the service himself, to see how it works.  Upon entering the website this disclaimer pops up...     If you are married and posing as single, be aware that you could be guilty of fraud and subject to civil and criminal penalties under federal and state law.  For each offense, Title 18, Section 1343 of the U.S. Code authorizes fines of up to $250,000 and jail sentences of up to five years.  TRUE reserves the right to report violators to law enforcement authorities and seek prosecution or civil redress to the fullest extent of the law.   If you are married, please close your browser.     Well, this creates a problem because my boss is indeed married.  So after a couple of displeasing remarks about the warning, he turns to me and says, "I know, why don't you sign up...you're single right?"  With a look of disgust on my face I say, "uh, are you serious?"  Then I proceed with my quick thinking and inform him that it probably costs something to join anyway...sure enough it does, and I get out of my chance at cyber dating...darn.    The other day I was eating lunch at Wendy's and overheard a group of young women discussing how all of their friends were signing up for multiple online dating services, which on average cost about 25 bucks a month.  Now, I am single, but considering the fact that I can barely afford to eat lunch everyday does not allow me to pay that kind of money to meet guys.  Seriously, what ever happened to meeting guys in the canned goods aisle at the grocery store, through friends, or at a bar??  We want THEM to pay for our dinner or our drinks, not pay some service to meet them!  I agree it is hard to meet decent guys sometimes, but have a little faith people!  We live in a fast paced, instant satisfaction world these days along with everyone wanting what they can't have.  People are too impatient to wait around for the right person and gravitate towards these high tech services to assist them in their dating challenged needs. I think it's just sad.  They can't suck me in!  I won't give in to the pressure!  Now, I am not one to speak of getting a lot of dates or anything, but I am not about to give up my Wendy's junior bacon cheeseburger to find a man to love me.  I'd rather be fat and single.

       OK so I decided to check out what all this Online Journal stuff is about.  I will be using this mostly to help pass the time while I am bored at work and am forced to think about random crap way more than I should.  While I stare at my computer screen my mind is constantly spinning, so I thought it might be a good idea to put this stuff down on paper so I don't drive myself loony...if I haven't already.  I would also like to think I am contributing to a good cause for all of those who are suffering as I am.  I live for checking away messages and my personal email while on the job.  My newest entertainment fulfillment is these online journals that people are starting to post. So, this is for all of you out there with a little too much time on your hands, read at will...
