        I have had a special request for blogging so here I am.  It is Friday and for that I am thankful but I have nothing useful or funny to say.  It doesn't feel like a Friday in my office and I am stuck at my desk doing all sorts of un-fun crap.  If anyone would like to brighten my day I would greatly appreciate it.  Otherwise I will be sittin here thinking about my bed and a beer.

        I saw part of the Facts of Life reunion show last night.&nbsp; Mrs. Garrett is really old now and I think they killed off Joe.&nbsp; Must have been some sort of motorcycle accident.&nbsp; Even though that show wasn't that great I found myself becoming very nostalgic as I remembered watching the show on summer mornings when I was in school.&nbsp; Oh those were the good ol days.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   On another note, it seems that summer finally hit Chicago.&nbsp; It is a great day outside and a great day for a BBQ.&nbsp; Happy 1/2 Birthday Heather!!!&nbsp; We'll put some candles in some S'mores for ya!

        How great of a movie is Reality Bites?&nbsp; I never really watched it before this past weekend and I was amazed.&nbsp; First off, Ethan Hawke is a babe.&nbsp; Second, there are soo many good quotes (he'll turn this place into a den of slack).&nbsp; How can you not love it?&nbsp; I also watched Say Anything right afterwards.&nbsp; Cusak is also a babe in that movie.&nbsp; "My plans are to spend as much time as possible with your daughter."&nbsp; Who says that to a dad?&nbsp; I laughed for about 5 minutes.&nbsp;

        In addition to leaving my much-loved pseudo Juicy Tube at home, I also left my cell phone.&nbsp; I feel like I lost my right arm or something.&nbsp; When exactly did I become so dependent on that thing.&nbsp; I have a perfectly good land line sitting next to me on my desk but I feel as if the world came to an end I wouldn't know because I don't have my cellie!

        So I show up at work this morning and realize that I have stupidly left my lip gloss at home.&nbsp; Now for those of you who know me, and especially those who went out with me on Saturday night, you know that I am addicted to that Clinique stuff.&nbsp; It is like crack.&nbsp; I'm not sure how I will get through the day without it.&nbsp; I'm already shaking...

        AGGHHH week from hell really.&nbsp; It is over in T minus 12 minutes.&nbsp; Was this week as bad for anyone else or was it just my office?       &nbsp;   On another note, I want to thank everyone who has made my first full week of blogging a success.&nbsp; Thank you Laura for always believing in me, thank you Wendy for always making me laugh, thank you Kellett for being an eskimo and many thanks to Erin with her eat a sandwich jokes.&nbsp; Without you all I never would have made it.&nbsp; Now...bitches be shoppin

        Laura and I weighed our heads the other night and we have disturbing results.&nbsp; The average human head is 8 lbs (per Jerry Maguire), Laura weighs in at a heavy 9.5 pounds while I am anorexic at 6.75 pounds.&nbsp; Why can't we ever be normal?

        I would have to say that the first night without my beautiful Laura went well.&nbsp; I made a pizza in the oven and turned it off when I was done (I checked like 6 times).&nbsp; I successfully attended bookclub then safely returned home (thank you Erin).&nbsp; I killed a big, huge spider on my own and only screamed at it first for about 5 minutes.&nbsp; I only broke one piece of Laura's china so far and only dropped 1/2 a bag of sugar on the floor, who knew Kool-Aid was so freakin difficult to make.&nbsp; I also called our landlady this morning to get things fixed.&nbsp; I am very efficient so far.&nbsp; Quite proud of myself really.       &nbsp;   On another note, our bookclub has time to read one more book before school starts again.&nbsp; We were thinking about The Devil Wears Prada (or whatever that title is).&nbsp; Any suggestions?

        I will share my most embarassing moment of the day and invite you all to post your own.&nbsp; Today at work I am wearing a skirt, very cute mind you, with elastic waist.&nbsp; I was squatting down by a box of files and unbeknownst to me,&nbsp;was standing on my back hem.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I got done with the file and stood up and was horrified as I realized my skirt had remained around my ankles.&nbsp; Yes, there I was standing in our file room with just my drawers on and my skirt and slip around my ankles.&nbsp; Luckily no one saw me.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Alright, your turn

        I would like to announce that today I was the 1 millionth person on the Blog website and just won a DVD player which I'm sure will be in the mail&nbsp;soon so our stupid postal workers on Wayne can deliver it to Lakewood.&nbsp; What good luck, I mean how many times in a day can one be the 1 millionth visitor to a website???       &nbsp;   In addition, Brooke just returned from Cosi and forgot my bread...more crying in the bathroom...be back later.

        So today I realized that my Laura is leaving me in less than 24 hours.&nbsp; Kellett posed the very realistic question "how are you going to survive?"&nbsp; Just yesterday I left the oven on all night and luckily Laura got out of bed at midnight and smelled something funny.&nbsp; I will have to subsist solely on&nbsp;pancakes and cookies (not a big change).&nbsp; I have discovered that Megan is very good at this whole making food ordeal so I will have to frequent her house over the next 3 weeks.&nbsp; Thats right people I said 3 weeks!!!&nbsp; Laura is leaving for 3 whole weeks.&nbsp; Must go cry in the bathroom now.

       I  will try to limit my colors to those that can be seen by all you color blind kids.&nbsp; Monday mornings are NO fun.&nbsp; I mean here I am stuck in an office with Kellet who insists on keeping&nbsp;the temperature at 60 degrees&nbsp;(I think he is part Eskimo), Casey is busy so she can't play with me&nbsp;leaving my only entertainment as the people in the office across the street who haven't moved for about half an hour, maybe they are dead. &nbsp;Why can't we all have Mondays off like Erin?&nbsp;        &nbsp;   I would now like to open this up to a discussion on 90210 episodes...

        So I'm not sure if having a "blog" makes me a loser but I think this is great!!!&nbsp; I have spent about 20 minutes away from my blog and the whole time I have been thinking about it (kind of like when I bought my Dooney Burke).&nbsp; I hope you all find it as great of a time-waster as I do!

        Hello all in Blogger-world!  I am on vacation.  Yippee, that is right.  One entire week off before school begins.  I just wish it was warmer so I could lay on the beach ALL day.  On another note, my parents cable doesn't include FX so I can't watch 90210.  What bs.  However, they do have about 3 HBOs and Showtimes so I am currently watching Look Who's Talking and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  Plus my mom and I spend about 3 hours a night glued to the Olympics.  This seriously pisses my father off as he can't see the joy of synchronized diving (what are those pansies doing?) or ping-pong.  We think he'll come around soon.

        Has any other girl out there read "The Rules"?  I believe that most of these are utterly ridiculous!  I am a young, energetic, beautiful woman and if I see something I want I am not going to sit there and hope it comes to me.   Honsetly, "never talk to a guy first, never ask a guy to dance." - that is utter BS.  I can waste my life away sitting in a corner of a bar smiling at cute guys.  I would rather be playing on the field than on the sidelines.          That said...I do believe that guys like girls who obey by "The Rules".  Guys say that if a girl didn't call them back or played hard to get then they would just walk away but I believe this is a lie.  General guy behavior has proven that they like the drama.  Case in point, a certain suitor has called me recently and I, foolishly, called him back within 3 hours of every call instead of playing games and waiting the requisite 24 hours.  Needless to say...I have still NOT gone on a date with this individual.  I think he didn't like my forward-ness!  I should have followed Rule #5 "Don't Call Him and Rarely Return His Calls"  Thoughts?

        Thanks to everyone who made book club so much fun last night!  We really should get together before school to do margaritas again.  Maybe Jamie can teach us how to make the perfect margarita after she goes to that party on Friday.            I understand that today can't be as blog-tastic as yesterday due to some really low billable hours yesterday that we must now make up but I just wanted to say Hi on this beautiful Thursday!          And to Erin -- "Vinnie Testiverte"

        Hey everyone.  This is an invite to discuss either movie characters or celebrities that get us hot and bothered (see previous post re Jude Law, Ethan Hawke and Lloyd Dobler) or on the other hand, why we can't stand or understand men.  I know the last one seems pretty ridiculous but why not?  I'm in the mood.          I would like to start by mentioning Carl from Love Actually.  I have no idea what his real name is but he has h-o-t-t-o-g-o in that movie!  In addition, I can't understand men who give mixed signals.  Either stick with the cutsie shit or play the asshole card...you can't have it both ways

        So Laura's fun-filled family vacation isn't so fun anymore and it isn't just because her family is driving her nuts.  Alex just became a class 2 hurricane and is bombarding her at Cape Hatteras.  She texted me 5 times last night giving me specific instructions on what to do if she doesn't make it back.  A little morbid in reality.  I have noticed that she hasn't mentioned her new Nine West shoes yet so I am assuming I get those (score!).  I am also hoping for her Ralph Lauren pillows but she might have willed those to someone else at this point.
