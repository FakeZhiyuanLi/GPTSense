      Well I'm finally back from school. Once again, okay day. I went to my first NYSSMA lesson for this year. I'm with some girl and some other girl that are both much older than me. I guess we'll all be on the same level though. I don't know what I'll be singing yet this year but I'm soon to find out. Next lesson is next monday....REMIND ME  I'll be having fun all weekend because everyone went away to my sister's to-be college. YIPPEE! I know thats awful but hey, I like to have some time to myself. The only problem is, my dad is paranoid and doesn't want me in the house alone so I have to stay nights at my cousin's house. She's cool and fun but I'd still rather be home doing my own thing. Oh well. At least I have some time.   Fastest butt boarding? ....what's that......  If anyone knows the code for quiz making please send it to me. I want to make my own but don't know the code. If anyone's even looking at this...........  =Lee  current music: MxPx - Lonesome Town  currently eating/drinking: Mt.

      Okay, time for some real stuff here.... Today was an okay day. It started out pretty good then took a crash down but I didn't die so it went zooming back up. So, it was okay. At the moment there is a black belt tied around my head so I'm not quite as focused as I should be (not that I'm ever focused but that besides the point...).   I'm not going to tell you a whole lot tonight. I'm pretty tired and I'm trying to help Sam with her blog. Her blog is on my account so don't get confused if we do. Right....  I guess that's all for now. Going to go back and play final fantasy!!  =Lee

      I read some more of "Stranger in the Chatroom" last night. It's a book written about this group of teenagers that encounter, what we assume to be Satan, in a chatroom. He somehow can hack into their emails and chats whenever he pleases. After a while of testing the faith of these teens he begins to get frustrated and threatens the one boy, Blake, to kill his sister if he didn't do what he wanted.   It really did scare me because Haddon ("Satan's name") confronted Blake in secret and told him in detail that he had been in Blake's house, seen his sister, and even had taken a lock from her hair. He had. He gave strict instructions not to get anyone else involved in this and to go to his mail box and there would be an envelope with instructions and his sister's lock of hair (to prove how close he has been).   It really freaked me out because "Haddon" is real. And he's after me too. I don't know if I could be as strong as Blake in that sort of situation. But he had God on his side and so do I. Maybe I can face that....But....   =Lee   Current Music: MxPx - My Mom Still Cleans My Room  Currently eating/drinking: chewing gum  Current Mood: tired/worried (kinda)

      Talking....to .......him. The evil one. The VERY evil one....  Let me give you the highlights  Alrighty, where shall I start? There's this guy(from now on known at Bubba), Bubba, that has been hounding my best friend (from now on known as Cysse), Cysse, to be his girlfriend. Of course, she turned him down. He's not the romantic type, he's not....many other things. But we do know what he IS....annoying. Of course he's annoying...his name is Bubba!   Well, this thing has been going on for quite some time and we finally got it through Bubba's thick skull that CYSSE DOES NOT LOVE BUBBA!! So here he is tonight apologizing but still not quite getting the big picture...Here is my conversation if you really are bored and want to read through it....   Bubba: hey Lee u there at this point in time  Bubba: ??  Lee: yea  Lee: but there is no such thing as a point in time  Bubba: oh k did u get me message from yesterday  Lee: there are no points  Bubba: lol  Lee: after a while, yes  Bubba: oh k so do u for give me  Lee: i don't know  Lee: i don't think you really understand  Bubba: well all I know bout me life is that its hard to make friends and I really siuldnt mess a friendship up because I was to annoying most of the time and I just keept on bugging u and Cysse  Bubba: shouldnt**  Lee: it's not about me  Lee: it's about you and Cysse  Bubba: oh u dont have to worrie bout that any more I like someone else right now in me oppinion I think I like her more than wat I liked Cysse  Lee: see, I knew you wouldn't understand  Bubba: well I'm stupid I dont under Stand as fast as other ppl me brain needs a wihile to figure out things exspcailly my life in a a down side right now and I really need to talk to a friend no a faimily member   Bubba: not**  Bubba: by the way howed things go at the fall fallies  Lee: let me tell you something.....no matter what you say NOW will not make things all happy and better the way you want it. For one thing, you do not know what love is.....at all! You may understand that it is a concept of "pretty boy/pretty girl" but this is the way every simple minded being thinks.   Lee: How do you think Cysse SHOULD have responded to you as you went on and on about how much you wanted to be with her and how much you loved her?! Both of us KNOW that you don't understand what love is!   Bubba: hey its not between a pretty boy and gurl it's more about watys on the inside than the out side  Lee: you're missing the point Bubba!  Lee: why do you think I've never dated anyone?! I haven't found the right one! You don't run around everywhere thinking "I wonder if thats the one. Maybe I'll ask" It'll HAPPEN! You'll both find each other! And trust me, it's not going to be some girl you think is cute in HIGH SCHOOL  Bubba: well I may not now wat it is but I do know that I messed up my only chance and now I'm trying to go on with me life  Lee: You don't even know that much about her! You may know the basics but if she was to ever date anyone she would KNOW them. You do not KNOW her  Lee: oh, sure, go on with your life!? So now you're chasing someone else! I'm telling you! You don't get it!!  Bubba: well I have been trying to know her  Lee: If you cared about her maybe you would realize what frustration you've been putting her though and would leave her alone!  Bubba: acully I'm not chasing her like I did with Cysse I have learnd from me mistacks  Bubba: ppl do do that to  Lee: translate that last sentance to english please  Bubba: people make mistacks  Bubba: do u know if its a fulmoon tonight  Lee: yes they do, but when you make a mistake you cannot take back what you have done!  Lee: i have nooooo idea  Bubba: but instead u learn from it  Bubba: oh k brb  Lee: yes you can learn from it. But when you make that first mistake it ALWAYS stays! YOu may move on to other things but you cannot change what has been done!   Bubba: if u still there u can read this sometiomes I cant control me actions but I do know that when I can watever I did during them I would still be resposible for watever I did when I rote all of those thing and sead all of those tings i was incontrol of my actions and thats why  no matter wat I do can parden my mistakes becayse I know that now so no matter wat u guys will remai mad at me for wat I did and I dont really apploguys to anyone but me parents but I have applgyes to other ppl then them in my life but only on a rare occasion on when I really feel bad on wat I have done and when I look back to when I first meet u and some and all the things I have sead I realy do wish I could take it all back but wats done is done and no one can change that.  Lee: and should i believe these things.....?  Bubba: well thats up to u if u want to but I know that there true cause they came from my heart  Lee: you know what, like I said before, this is not my problem. I am not involved in this. This is for you and Cysse to figure out on your own. I am withdrawing from this conversation........ now   That's all for now. And sorry about his bad grammar. I didn't quite understand most of it myself either. I think now that I really shouldn't have said those things. It's really not my bussiness now is it? But....what's done is done. Now I'm going to go rest my brain.   =Lee   Current Music: video game stuff   Currently eating/drinking: purple yogurt.....?  Current Mood: Tired....of course!

      Once again, it's been a while since I've written. I can't let this page of mine die like the others! Make me write! Make me write!!!  This week...went by. Seems like everything has been going by really fast...like, faster then I've ever remembered it. When I was younger it was always, "How many more days till Christmas?! I can't wait!!!" But now...  Oh I don't know  I've been reading the Claudie Journals lately. I had read Wolf Tower, the first one, sometime last year and have just recently read the second, Wolf Star. Now I'm on the third, Wolf Queen. I really enjoy reading these because the characters seem so real and the way they react to things. And, I know this is ridiculous but, it makes me sad to read about all this fantasy stuff and then compare it with my life. I ask myself stupid questions like, "Why doesn't this ever happen to me? Why wouldn't anyone do that for me?" Stupid...It's fantasy. It's not real you idiot. But still...I hope it was. I hope that in some strange way it would all become real to me. But sadly...it doesn't.  I know, that's stupid.  Well....I'm feeling too idiotic to say much more at the moment. Maybe I'll write later tonight.  =Lee   Current Music: video game stuff  Currently eating/drinking: cookies  Current Mood:  Tired yet wired

      Hm....How long has it been since I updated this? Oh well....who cares. Too much math involved.   Right, speaking about math, let's talk about school (*cringe*).    I guess things are going okay. So far I haven't seen anyone throw up, there haven't been major hate/kill/die days...only small ones, and all my teachers are pretty cool.  But...I am hated. What do I do about that? Nothing I guess. Nothing I really can do. Its just a nagging question on my brain of, "What have I ever done to you?".  Anyway....  Also, for what SCHOOL IS FOR (for those who don't know it's supposed to be for learning) I guess I'm doing OKAY with grades. I wish I was doing better. I know I should study more....I really should. It just seems so hard because I have such a short attention span. I have no idea how I can read books and play video games. I guess they can just keep my attention better because....it's more interesting maybe?  Now, what was I saying?  I saw Julia in school today! She just got back for a short break from college. It was so good to see her!! XD I was supposed to go shopping with her and my sister tomorrow...but I guess things changed. I don't know. It kinda made me upset because my mum said I shouldn't miss a day of school for that. But she's the one that told me we were going to! I remember I was depressed about something (who knows what with me) and she said that would happen (shopping w/ Julie)  Oh well I guess....Sam is coming over anyway so we can practice our song thing for the fall follies. I kinda got worried though. Because my mum said, "well we'll wait to see what Dad says about it." So....what if he says its okay (which I doubt but it could still be a possibility)?? I can't leave Sam hanging! I would like to bring her along if I could go because c'mon! I ASKED HER TO GO TO MY HOUSE PEOPLE!! But....what if she couldn't? That would be....cruel of me.  Gosh, there I go again, those darned WHAT IFs.   Well, I should go do some homework.

      My aimless writing....  Sometimes I wonder if anyone really understands me. I don't see how they possibly could; I don't understand myself. I search for the answers in everything I do, everything I say. I analyze my own life, forever searching for something, but never knowing what I'm for or what I would ever do if I found this "something". I guess I would conclude that from so many different influences from completely opposing thoughts that I have fallen to surrender to my emotions. I search through the lives of others to find that they have reason. But do I? Why do these questions haunt me so? And, what is this thing I search for? I do not come from a disfunctional family and never have I been scarred from the past. If there is no reason then how can there be fault?

      Today I went to the HCC (Hope Community Center) to video tape for Sam. Her grandma had a surprise 60th birthday party. It was kinda fun setting up. It was almost like a Thanksgiving dinner with her family. I really did enjoy being there (yes, even the kids were fun). We skated around for a while also, something I haven't done in years.  It was all going great. But then something happened...I'm not really sure what. But it wasn't good. Suddenly there just became a strange sort of tensing aura around me and sam. Did we fight? I'm not really sure. My mom came to pick me up and as I walked through the door I had to use all my energy to keep from crying. Why did I want to cry? Did I really want to cry? No, I don't think so... but i did. The moment I stepped into the van and we pulled out of the parking lot I cried...  I hate crying  =Lee  current music: none  currently eating/drinking: nothing  current mood: sad (to put it bluntly)

      Yeah it's Thanksgiving. I'm going to go out and help my mom with stuff soon. I'm not really excited about it today. I've never really ever been but....I just want to go back to bed. We have tons of people coming over today. It seems like Thanksgiving happened so fast this year. I mean, we usually have another week before having to think about it!! I was so confused when I saw my mom making a turkey last night. I didn't think it was going to be TODAY.  Oh yeah. And as I said in my last entry I don't have a lot of brain power.....I haven't recently. I spent a whole day with my mom yesterday in the car and I had so many things to tell her. But I couldn't think of anything to say. I had the thoughts I my mind but I couldn't say them. At all. It was so hard to even stay thinking.  I think I'm tired.  Again.  Well, I might write more later but most likely not until late tonight. But for now I have to go work.........some more........again......gaah.    =Lee   Current Music: nothing   Currently eating/drinking: nothing  Current Mood: avery tired

      THANKSGIVING IS COMING!!! YAY!!!  wait.....thanksgiving.........kids......thanksgiving + kids = total chaos  Oh dear -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That line there is there.....to be a line. SO THERE  You may have noticed the new link I put up on the left bar thingy over there. Yes, I'm going to dedicate my artwork and everything else related to art on that page. I started that page a long time ago but was too lazy to do anything with it so left it. But just recently (like 30 minutes ago) I descovered my friend's blog that.....I had never seen before. I feel awfully guilty about it too because there were notes in there for me. The one who is supposed to be so dedicated and....well, let's just say my concience is hurting. Or something. Well, in her blog was a link to my 240 day old page that I posted in...once. SO!! I'm going to do something with it. YAY!! You can all dance aroind now. Yes....you....now....I don't see you dancing yet!!! >.>  I guess I've been feeling okay lately. Still so tired that my eyes hurt all the time but....I guess I'll just have to get used to that. But other then that and the strong feeling of wanted to push Joey off a cliff (yes that is his real name and now you can all go stalk him) I've been good. But tonight I guess I felt a feeling of denial. Like....no one cares. Here is a little thing I wrote in one of the forums I go to...    People don't understand me.....  No one does. Well.....except my mom. Cause she's awsome. And I hate the thought of going to college (3 years away ) because then I'll have NO ONE that understands me AT ALL. My best friends doesn't even fully understand me!!   I love my mom!!    But seriously...the things I do....why I do them. My reasoning.....my likings.....I know other people have different persprectives but it seems that know one ever understands me....the way I want it. They way I make it. The way I put it.  *sigh* It's sad....I have a hard time understanding myself so how can I ask for others to? I know there are other people out there that aren't understandable....but....  gosh i just confused myself. What I was trying to say is I have weird interests and no one ever seems to respect them. Even if they try it's almost always a lie. Or partial. Or ..... they just don't care.   =kami     I know that wasn't too clear but I don't have a lot of brain power at the moment and I must hurry to bed. I might be able to explain in more detail later so...in the meantime....REMIND ME!!     XD Have a great day!   =Lee   Current Music: nothing   Currently eating/drinking: meaty something.....ham?

      Lee here. I'm in my computer class at the moment. We have a sub....again....so I can't start on the next unit. I don't know what to do! So, instead of being a bum (like I am) I decided to come and update my blog. Yes, that way I will have more time to do my homework tonight. Right....  Well, stuff has been happening. Nothing too interesting. There's not really much to say....>.>  I'm really hungry. I've been hungry alot lately. Hm....  Well, that was exciting.   UponThouFairCat still hasn't responded. I don't know if she will. I really would like her to because I want that picture to come out but....I need some help! Maybe I can just ask my brother when he gets home for Thanksgiving. But it seems hard to ask him for help O.o  I don't really know why. Maybe I'm scared of being wrong....?  I guess I'm going to go find something else to do now. I suppose if there's free time to do stuff I might as well be doing something "constructive"!! XD  I've been telling people to do something constructive lately. I'm turning into my brother!!

      I think I'm better now. It's been a while since I screwed up real bad like the other night so I guess I freaked out. I think things are almost not but okay now.  I'm still waiting for UponThouFairCat to respond to my post. A while ago I mentioned that some people were critiquing my art work and it really bothered me....(and it still does) but now I'm staying on the site for hours waiting for the response on my work. I want to know what to do next. I want to learn.   Whoa.....that's weird. Me? WAITING for advice? Maybe this IS a good idea.....  I'm still kinda worried about putting in my other works though. I know what's wrong with them....so it's definatly obvious to them. Scares me on what they might say.....   Well, I'm off to go do nothing now. I was drawing for a while but got too tired. I know! I'll go build that thing! Yea! That Metal Gear Solid tank thing my brother sent me!

      Got back from shopping. Got some stuff. Really not in the mood to write but I am writting. I'm just so mad....  People don't understand that I'm not "preaching" to them. I made a suggestion to people. THATS ALL. A SUGGESTION. I even said if they didn't like it the could just delete it.   But then of course, stupid me has to go and post this thread about SPAM THREE TIMES. An error came up saying it couldn't be sent so stupid me believes that it wasn't sent and tries again and OH! Loook at that! ANOTHER ERROR! So what does stupid me do? Try again of course! And I go back and look at the boards and I get these smart remarks on Oh look! Isn't it ironic that you spam the boards while telling us not to spam?! AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

      I'm pretty tired now. I stayed up late last night RPing with cysse. We watched three movies yesterday......  Tokyo Raiders Muppets Treasure Island (XD) Cinderella (Korean type version)  We fast-forwarded through most of Winnie the Pooh (was on the same tape) and we discussed that fact that the guy that wrote the Winnie the Pooh stories got tired of writing them and was going to have Christopher Robin go in and kill them so he wouldn't have to write about them anymore.  Also, we talked about how we suspect Pigglet to be a major mass murderer and most likely is teamed up with Tiger(the assassin) and Eeyore(technician). They're secret base is probably below Eeyore's hut thing and we're guessing they're going to kill CR first (cause he's annoying) and then go straight to Rabbit's house.   Beware...Pigglet and his partners in assassination will be coming to a city near you in december of 2004. ..... Or so we think. Who knows it could be sooner.   Paranoid now, aren't ya?   You should be.   I am.   *cough* Ahem.... Anyway. Tonight at the youth group thing we watched Spirited Away!! XD It was great because I had expected these kids (ages like 11-13?) to think it was messed up (like everyone else) and just spit criticism at it. But they actually liked it!! THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!! XDDDDD  Probably because the psycho one wasn't there....I would have sat on him.  Well, off to   tomorrow to go shopping for......*gag* two days. Hey, I like getting new stuff and all but I'm NOT a good shopper. 30 minutes after being in a store it's like, isn't it time to go home yet? Geez....my feet are gonna hurt. So is my head.  Better rest up. Long two days are coming.   Aw crud. Gotta finish my homework too. >.> Lot's of homework    =Lee    Current Music:   Currently eating/drinking:   Current Mood: very tired

I'm just too lazy to host and post 'em at the moment. Ask me for 'em sometime and I might stop being laxy (for a minute anyway).  I think staying home these couple of days has been good for me though. I got to take a nap today ^^  Man, I feel not so tired now. XP Plus, I think getting away from people for a while has helped my esteem...or whatever you call it.   Cysse is coming over tomorrow...I have to catch up on my homework. Sunday night, movie night. Going to watch Spirited Away with the rest of the youth group. IF YOU LIVE AROUND HERE COME!! XD It'll be at the mission house next to the church after worship! We'll have food and junk too! Please come!! XP If you need a ride ASK ME! I'm sure I can find someone to give you a ride ^_^ (hehehe)  Monday going away to   till Tuesday to go shopping. Yay! Can't wait to get all you weird people presents! XP  Think I'm going to go finish putting up stuff and junk! TTYL!   =Lee   Current Music: no idea cause the playlist isn't coming up.

      I wonder what love is like.......Have I felt it before? I think so. But only a tingle in my heart for a moment that lasts forever. I wish I could tell you how I feel. But, I know that would just make us both uncomfortable and things wouldn't be the way they used to be.  I wonder if you know how I feel?  It kills me to write this because if you ever find this and read it you will know I'm talking about you. But, I have to write it. I can't keep these feelings hidden inside of me. But...if you do ever read this, please spare me the pain and don't tell me. I know we could never be together. It's this whole distance thing. Heck, I barely know you. But......  I can't dance. I only ever learned this one from a friend.  But I promise I'll practice. After all, I promised you a dance, didn't I.  But then again, I'd probably be too short for you :)    =Lee   Current Music: none  Currently eating/drinking: nothing  Current Mood: teary/broken by my own fantasies(?)

It's really making me mad.   Plus, I have to study for this stupid history test on China. Everyone else might think history is so easy but I don't think anything that has to do with school is easy. I don't understand it! I just want to hide in my cave till .... forever is done. Someone send me food and books.   Geez, I'm sick of being lectured and I'm sick of having to study.

      I've been kicked out of my room....again. If there aren't men in there tearing things down...there are men doing construction in there. And if there aren't any men in there....my sister is in there sleeping in MY bed. Where I should be. But instead....I'm everywhere else! GAAH!!  I haven't had a good night sleep in ..... well, about a year now. Maybe. Close to that. Maybe 9 months. Close. I could have slept so well last night. No one was talking to me while I was trying to sleep. No cat was jumping on me. There were no noises. It was late. I was tired. I slept.....for an hour. Then the cat started hacking again. I think I listened to him for ten minutes before realizing he was really coughing and it wasn't a dream. So, of course, I have to get up and put him out EVEN THOUGH he isn't even MY cat. And EVEN THOUGH he is my SISTER'S cat. And EVEN THOUGH she was awake!!   Then I couldn't sleep in this morning because there were more men at my house cleaning. I was wondering for the longest time what that suction noise was.   Twas the vaccum.  And then of course it's noon and I could at least try to go back to bed but SOMEONE is still in my room.....sleeping in my bed. WHERE I SHOULD BE!!

      I'm still alive!!! I've been playing alot of SNES games lately. Trying to beat them while I still .... well........ remember.   Was in the mini olympics yesterday. That must have been the only day this year that I've had lots of fun. Well, for the half of the day anyway. I got really mad (REALLY mad, like I'm going to shoot you mad) at these dumpy kids after half the day was over. Cysse and I were the only ones trying to have fun from our team so while we were trying to get the rest of the team roudy some idiot dumpy kids started swearing and saying crude things to me from the other bleachers. Yeah, I wanted to shoot them. Alot. I didn't care about giving them pain. I just wanted to shoot them and get it over with for both of us.  I am too kind.  There were alot of games and races I wanted to be in but they always had enough people when I got there. It was always the same people. Oh well. I had fun. I even got our team some points! Yes! Me, the not athletic one!! BWAH HA HA HA!!  At lunch I had soda....which isn't good when I am in a good mood. You see, soda makes my mood 10X more extreme then it was. Same when I'm sad. Or angry. And luckly I wan't angry when I drank it. After that I was literally hopping down the halls and waving to everyone. Even people I didn't know. It was like this.....  Me: HI! HI! HI! HI! HI! HI!! SAY HI TO ME!! NO, DONT SAY HI TO HIM. LOOK AT ME! SAY HI TO ME!! HI HI HI HI!!  yeah....scary twas I.  Then my happiness kinda faded when I was ready to shoot those idiot dumpy kids. But I didn't. I went to someone older and had the problem.....removed.  BWAH HA HA HA HA!!! FEEL MY WRATH!! Almost......  So, we got fourth place. I was kinda upset because my stupid team wasn't doing anything. They weren't even trying. They weren't even having fun!! Arg....  Seniors for first. Bah....  They thought that we (the freshmen) were copying them when they did the chicken dance because, OH, we got in a circle and so did they. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING!! They were the first people up and they got in a circle so we though we had to! And the german kid started break dancing (XD it was great!) in the middle. We got points off for that cause the judges thought it was dangerous. And Mike and I ran out in the middle of the circle and started doing stupid stuff. Judges took off for that too cause they thought we were copying.   But it was SO FUN!! Mike and I were spinning around so much and so fast that I thought I was gonna frope. XD It was great!!   Next year we shall clear our names and be original. That is....IF THE REST COOPERATE WITH ME. >  I'll post some pics from it when I get them.    =Lee  Current Music: About a Burning Fire - Project 86  Currently eating/drinking: NOTHING!!

      School's been delayed 2 hours for rain and ice so I figured this would be a good time to update this.   School is a pain still. I'm glad I won't be having my social studies test today. I want another night to study. Multiple choice thursday, essay friday, DBQ(data based questions) monday. Arg....Then spanish test friday, english test friday, math test...friday(?), english quizey thing today(?).   blarg....  I have a very hard time paying attention. That's my reason for doing so poorly this year. Things are so much harder....Seems like I'm expected to grow up faster than I should.  Oh yay! D just told me there's no school. I'm going to work on my webpages today then. This one needs some work. Those dumb links over there are messing up. And I have a forum that I am trying to revive. It's called Silent Winds, although I think I'm going to change the name. I made it sometime last year and it died. I kinda abandoned it anyway. So I'll work on that too. There is a link to the page over there but it isn't working. The page is  www.xxchildxx.suddenlaunch2.com/index.cgi?  You have to add the ending, "index.cgi?" or it won't bring you to the right page.   I'm going to try to BUILD my own page also. I'm going to use frontpage and host it on netfirms. That is, if I can figure it out. I'm pretty bad with HTML. That's why I'm using frontpage.   So, I'm off to go do that. If anyone has any suggestions, LET ME KNOW!!!   =Lee   Current Music:  Jarboe -  In an Open Sea  - Thirteen Masks  Currently eating/drinking: nuffin  Current Mood: happy?

      Alright, I really shouldn't be updating this  now  because I need to go study, but I have to get this out...  Today I, L.E., threw Mr. Neiman's stapler at J.R.'s head. Let us now have a moment of silence for the poor stapler.... [silence]........................................[/silence]  I've been really mad lately. I think I might have already written about that earlier on or maybe even the post before this. Who knows. But I guess I was really mad this morning. At first I woke up knowing it was going to be a bad day. I wasn't satisfied with my appearance and I couldn't do anything about it. Even if I could I wouldn't know what. Then I got to school and went to my horrid spanish class. It didn't help any that I got a 70 on my test. Once I fled from there I found myself in the gym tripping over basketballs. I'm not athletic. If only there was an X-treme Pingpong team. That would be nice. When I got into my science class J.R. slammed a stapler down on my hand. He didn't mean to but I of course freaked out and acted on impulse. The stapler went flying at his head....I think. Didn't quite pay attention to where it went. My first reaction was to apologize to the teacher, and I did. Not to J.R. though. Nope. I just marched over there, picked up the stapler and gave it to the teacher saying, "I'm sorry I threw your stapler".  yeah.  So, my plans are to buy a new stapler for Mr. Neiman even though this last one still works. It just seems right.   But now I must go. I'm mad again though. I have to go chuck wood at the house.  I shall return.   =Lee   Current Music: Orange - Starwheel  Currently eating/drinking: Orange juice (isn't irony great)  Current Mood: mad

      I'm really still alive. I've just been so busy with school and stuff. I'm failing my spanish class which is VERY NOT GOOD. So I've been working a little harder on things. And I've been doing other stuff of my own at home. So, I am alive and I will return. Maybe after I get out of school for Christmas vacation I can update some things. I haven't even been DRAWING!! Although I don't know how much time I will have since I only get out the day before Christmas. Oh yeah! I'll have to tell you how the Mini Olympics go too. It's this whole big day before vacation that the freshmen through seniors get to play games in the gym against each others as olympics. And this year I'm in it! yay! That'll be fun. So, I'll let you know. But for now I have to go take a shower and do my homework.   =Lee    Current Music: nothing   Currently eating/drinking: grapes  Current Mood: almost happy!!

      Geez, Kether. You have alot of nerve making me cry. I really don't know what to do and don't think I'm just trying to sympathize with you. You deserve a good kick in the teeth. I don't know whether to be mad or what. I'm just a little upset that you would give up everything just because of what YOU think. You don't know everything you know. You say, "There's nothing for me in this world". If nothing else, I STILL CARE. So what if we barely even know each other?! That still doesn't change the fact that there is still someone in this forsaken world that cares about YOU. Isn't that one person still worth living for? Am I worth living for?  You don't know how much I hate crying. It's beyond words. You made me cry, Kether. Or whatever your name is. And quit with the "oh well"'s. Oh well is just a simple way of putting, "I don't care". HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP YOU AT ALL?! IF YOU CAN'T EVEN CARE FOR YOURSELF?!?!?   You know more about me now than I know about you. Bits and peices of me were dropped that time we talked. I'm risking myself, ya know. My mom is worried about me because of you. So is my youth leader. I trust my youth leader with my life but I couldn't listen to what her opinion was. I asked her not to tell me when she heard what I talked to you about. I would have cried.

      Wow....Things just suddenly got dark. You see, I have this horrible thing in my mind that keeps telling me my drawing are just that of an idiot ametuer and I should just give up and go find something better to do. Like sleep. Or...be a bum like every other idiot that lives here. But I've worked hard to keep drawing and to find any way I can to get better. I haven't given up on it and I've worked so hard at staying positive with this.   Things are definately dark.  My brother is home. The art student. He's the greatest. He's my hero. The one that I look up to more thatn anyone else in this dark world. I want him to be proud of me. I want to reach his expectations. I want him to look at me and say, "She's got talent".   Things just don't work that way.  People around here can look at my art and think it's a master peice. You'd think that would make me happy. No...Not at all. These people don't know about the world. Their minds are stuck on this little town that can't do anything but eat, sleep, watch tv, and breathe. People here have no lives so when they see a simple little person trying to do something they are wowed. Freaks. They don't know what talent is.   "You should be an artist! Or one of those animator people!" That's what someone said to me. It's just a darned DOODLE! I've taken time to LEARN to draw and I've PRACTICED what I've learned. Nothing to be proud of though. Nothing a real artist would say is even "decent". It may be better than anything they(people here) can do but it is definatly one of the worst of the rest of the world.  I love drawing. I hate my lack of artistic talent. I try so hard. But I just can't do it. I even bought $40 worth of art books to help me learn how to draw these characters. I've even asked my brother for help. I thought I was doing well....  "This book is full of crap. Everything in here is worthless. It all looks flat. It hasn't helped you at all with your style of drawing. I don't like what it's done to your techniques."  I thought I was doing well.....  I can't do it anymore. I've been trying. It doesn't work anymore. I can't get the pencil to work the way it should. I can't make strokes where they should be. I can' make things proportionate.   What can I do now? All I've ever done through practically my whole mature life is read, write, and draw. It's so hard for me to write anymore. Reading is all I can do. I can't draw. And it pains me to see other's work. I can't even watch movies anymore without thinking, "Why can't I do that?"   =Lee   Current Music: Listening to the boys play Halo(BANG CRASH FWOOM....stuff like that)  Currently eating/drinking: nothing  Current Mood: tired/depressed/lonely

      Man....I wasn't in the best mood to begin with, but at least I didn't feel like poo, like I do now.  Most people look back at their childhood and see young fun and life. I look back and see an immature bimbo who thought she knew what was best for everyone.   I was cleaning out my folder(gotta do that every month or I'd be buried in it all) and finally made myself look through those millions of useless AIM chats I saved a couple years ago. Must be I thought there was something interesting or funny to keep forever....and ever ....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand ever. Geez. Was I such a moron? Am I still now? Well, I came across a few embarassing ones where I thought I was being funny. The person on the other end laughed, but looking back on it now, it wasn't funny at all. I was a spaz trying to make everyone feel good. Then I noticed a folder where I had kept the 2 conversations I had with (random person)'s friend(from here on known as Wyllo). It hurts to think about it. It went basically like this....  Lee: everyone get online on 9-11! Cause that's what it says every idiot should do! WEEEE!! Wyllo: That's pathetic Lee: what is? Wyllo: Everyone is making a fun day about 9-11 when people died that day Lee: hey man, I'm just repeating what someone sent to me, so chiiiill Wyllo: don't follow the crowd. Just follow Christ Lee: They're not making it a fun day anyway! They just want to do something to commemorate it Wyllo: They can remember on their own by the people's lives that were taken!  Lee: geez man, calm down you grouch Wyllo: I just think it's pretty ridiculous to do something like that on a sad day for America Lee: Yea yea, you just don't get it Wyllo: YOU don't get it Lee: psh Wyllo: if you insist on being rude to me then just stop talking! Lee: yea, whatever Wyllo: thankyou   I'm such an idiot. WHY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT he WAS SAYING!?!?!? Actually....I think I did understand. I was just afraid of being stupid(hah, right). Please note that this is not EXACTLY(or very close) the way the converstation was, it's just basically what was said and done. Scene 2! duhn duhn duhnnnnn.....!!  Lee: you OBVIOUSLY like (insert random name here) Wyllo: obviously Lee: well, LEAVE HER ALONE XP badeee..... Wyllo: why? Lee: BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOUUUUUUUU Wyllo: I don't love her Lee: THEN STOP FLIRTING WITH HERRRRRRRR badeeeee Wyllo: I'm a flirter Lee: Well, she thinks you are serious about this and it's really kinda hurting her with, blah blah blah(insert random things here). And people are BUGGERING her about itttt!!!!!!!!! Wyllo: fine then, i'll just pull the mute on her Lee: NOOOOOOO!!! Don't stop communicating with her! Just cut back on the flirting junk! Wyllo: k... -----------------BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ-------------------------- the end   T_T WHY MUST I GET INVOLVED WITH OTHER PEOPLES' BUSSINESS!!!! WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But really. I feel like crap about that. I really made a change in both of their lives because I was so eager to protect my friend. MAN! I don't even learn from these things!! Ive done the same kinda thing before too! WHY WON'T I JUST LEARN!! Geez...I'm so thickheaded. Or overprotective. Gosh, I'm gonna be one good parent >  Soo...In conclusion, if I could change that I would. I would try to fix things now, but as I said, getting involved only makes things worse. I wish I could fix things now but....what if it makes things worse? And besides, these kinda things are things I just don't know how to deal with. Somethings can't be fixed. Especailly if [b]I[/b], the master of messing things up, causes them to break. Gosh, I'm a loser.  Why couldn't I have been born a good child?      Am I a mean person?

You are lame for writing something so tactless in my guestbook You are lame for making me have to take time out of my free time to go clean up your mess You are lame for not coming to me personally if you like me so much You are lame for liking me at all You are lame for being scared of telling me who you are You are lame for posting such a thing publically You are lame for writing my name when I CLEARLY censored it in this blog You are lame for being lame  Now, if you want to be mature and come to me and tell me about this, I can tell you in person you are lame.

      Things have been going pretty good around here lately('cept for last night, but don't let me get ahead of myself).  MY BROTHER CAME HOME!!!!   But he's gone now.....;_;  It was so much fun!! Emily is so funny!!!! XDD I really don't know how to explain it. It was just the greatest. Poor brother was stuck in a house with five girls. I had tons of fun with E&E but I still wish I could have spent some more times with my brother. :-/  We did hang around playing Zelda for a while though. That was cool. I want him to come home now. COME HOOOOOOOOOOOOME!!!!!! COOOOOOOOOOOOMEE HOOOOOOOOOOOOOMEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!  It was awesome. The greatest. Greater than that. Too much fun to express.   And I learned the awesome, "I have no life" dance and "the penny dance". YAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!    Things didn't go too well after they left though. I miss them so much. PLEASE COME BACK!!! PLEAAAAAAAAAASE!!!!!!!!!! I was so stressed last night. So many things were being cramed into the one weekend and with everyone leaving and all....It's not just that though. There are things I'm really upset about. Just stuff. Stuff like, I hate school. People are so abnoxious and idiotic. No sense, NO RESPECT(a biggie for me....man I want burger king now)....and they always stick to what they think it best instead of looking to see what others think. They think there way is THE way. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ITS NOT!  I went over to Amanda's tonight for her b-day party and that really gave me a different point of view on things. I had no idea other girls had good morals. Some.   So there.     =Lee   Current Music:  Currently eating/drinking: WAFFCLES!  Current Mood: kinda cool

      Where has the time gone? Why can't it be the way things used to be?  I'm really frusterated with life at the moment. Honestly, I have a really good life. Big house, great family, perfect place to live... Then why are things so much harder? Why am I crying myself to sleep?   Nothing can help me. No one can. No matter who, no matter how many times they tell me I'm good at something, I can't believe them. I can't do it.  It doesn't help at all when everyday, except saturdays and sundays, I am critisized and picked on about anything and everything.   Things are alot harder than before.   "People say that your teenage years are the best years of your life. They lie." -Mum  Just leave me alone. I can't get on with my life when you are in my way.    But other than that, I have found the biggest reason for my distress. My biggest goal in life is to have fun. I want to soak up life for what it's worth. I want to take it all in. But people keep getting in my way. When I want ice skating with the youth the other night, I had the most fun I've had since...since....gosh, I don't even know the last time I had any fun. But it's not that I can't have fun, it's the people around me that can't just throw down the work or stiffness and MELLOW OUT!! I mean, COME ON! Just loosen up and have fun!! I really had fun that night. I really did. Why can't anyone else have fun?   I think I'm going to keep this KFC bowl.   MY BROTHER IS COMING HOME!!!!!!

      Feels like there is glass in my tounge... :(  I'm still waiting for the anime episodes to come back online. They have been down for quite a while and should jave been back up the 1st. I guess the manager has alot to do. Or maybe she's lazy. I'd be lazy if I were her. I'd be lazy if I wasn't either. In fact, I'm not her. In fact, I AM lazy.  so....if you want to check out the site anyway for when the episodes DO come back online, you'll find it here...  http://dewdrop-garden.com/  Happy sailing,   =Lee   Current Music: none  Currently eating/drinking: little caesers pizza!

Go to live365.com and listen to the station called GamerGirl which has bunchles of anime and game music and asian. So cool.    Italian dunkers today! YAY!!  Going to go ice skating with Jill on friday. I've only ice skated twice in my life. I can't even remember if I was any good at it. hmm...I'm surprised she's actually inviting ME for once to do something with her. Must be she's sick.... She's always the one saying we need to get together and do something but I'm always the one that has to make the plans. Plans are fine for a month. I keep reminding her about it everyday and she says, "Yeah, yeah, it's fine. I can still go. I'll be there" But then the night before she says she was invited to something OBVIOUSLY more important than me and nevers shows up. Ever.

      Wow, I guess I haven't been keeping up lately. Ever since school started back up I've been so busy and tired I haven't even thought about updating. Tests, tests, tests. How tiring.  NYSSMA is on saturday. I'm not really worried but I still wish I didn't have to do it. I think I'm going to do fine but I still have trouble in a couple areas. There's not going to be much of a reward afterwards either because there aren't any stores where I'm going >  I said in an earlier post that I've been talking to someone from Gaia lately. He's really nice and kinda goofy. It's been fun to have someone to talk to that isn't insane.

      Aww....Lufmaddo is so sweet. She got me Wolf Queen thinking it was the next book I needed. Aww.... But no, next book is Wolf Wing in paperback.   I REALLY need to study for this social test. It's so lame that my teacher only gave us the answers to the studyguide today and the test is TOMORROW. Geez....And we only got the packet yesterday. Oh oh, and this test is 10 or 15 questions longer then the last one and we got like a week to study.   I got my site up and I'm even getting some people to go to it! That's so cool! I still need to get some other things up there. I forgot how to publish it though so I have to wait till my dad gets home to ask him. Not tonight though because he'll be home late.   I made cookies tonight! I'm so proud of myself. They're even edible ^^  NYSSMA(singing stuff solo thing. You get graded on it by judges and dudes) is soooooooooon....I'm kinda scared. But I think I'll do good. I hope I don't choke at the last minute like last year....  I got my package! YAY! The series is really confusing...It starts out like you were in the middle of the series but it's really the first episode. I think. It says DISC ONE!! So must be. It really seems like I've missed way too much though...  Well, I really really can't say anything else right now.

      Everything in this library feels so sticky. How strange....  I am so hungry...I didn't get a chance to eat anything in lunch today because I was doing some math homework that I just couldn't figure out! The lunchladies clean up ten minutes before lunch is over so I never get up there in time to eat. That's frustrating. They have 3 more hours to clean. They don't need to when we're still in there.  Arg...  I talked to a coolie guy on Gaia last night. I'll write more about that later. I can't now, doing social studies.   MOMMY FEEL BETTER!!      =Lee

      I'm home now! It's so nice to be back, though I had bunches of fun at the college. I had such a great time with Natto(not real name :P) and her friends! After I got my stuff in her room we went to the quad with bunchles of other girls and sang praise songs for a couple hours. Other people kept joining in too so we were all squished on two little blankets. I wasn't sure if my bum was still around when I stood up ^^; Twas fun When we started to grow ice mustaches we decided to go inside and watch a movie. There was a dude with us so we didn't want to watch a chick flick soooooo we watch Armaggedon! That is such a cool movie! Sad, but cool! Natto was crying at the end but it was funny anyway. She was laughing with tears rolling down her face. Heh heh. It was late so we headed off to bed but got right back up the next morning for more fun! After a GREAT speaking at "Faith"(the girls get up every saturday morning at 10 for a sort of bible study thing) and meeting a spiffy Japanese girl(she's so cool! XD) Natto and some other girls(a few from the singing and someone else) and I went for a walk some distance into the woods. It was SUCH a beautiful weekend! It was so warm and sunny. Whee! We were all sweaty when we got back so we changed before lunch and ran off there. I met up with my parents there and we got ready to leave(I bought an h-college hoodie right before we left, tis beautiful) when my dad got a call for some dude-man at work. We hung around for about a half an hour THEN left, met up with bro-ness, looked around his college(h-college is much nicer), looked at his wonderful art, the hampter, and left. Aww....  It was so nice at the college. People were laughing, having fun, smiling, singing. I can't wait to go. It's so much better then.......highschool, where people are trapped in the itty-bitty town of >neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer  So, I'm home again. It's nice to be home. Too bad I can't sleep in my own bed though. I've been camping out in my old room, crashing on the futon because my other room is underconstruction. My closet is being built with wood I'm allergic to. But the smell will eventually fade away.....I hope.  Talked to Cysse today! She had lots and lots of fun on vacation! That's really good! I worry about her sometimes....She went on SCARY RIDES!! Rides I'd never go on! Like the Tower of Terror and a roller coaster! I'd chicken out and run away!  Wellies, I made a webpage! I'm so proud of myself...well...didn't MAKE it make it. But I made it. I'm going to put up a link to it so waddle on over there and take a look!!  GNIGHTIES!!

Maybe just a couple hours away. But in a city at least!  Not much time to chat. I've temporarily stolen Jewels' laptop and I should probably give it back.  Oh yeah, and this if for stiff people that need to stop being so darned depressed and crotchety... GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON WITH LIFE! LIFE IS FUN! HAVE SOME FUN ALREADY, NERD.  Just thought someone might need to hear that. I really don't know who...but maybe someone did. And if they did, WOW! HOW'D YOU HEAR THAT!? I TYPED IT! YOU ARE SO COOL!

      Man, it would be the greatest if I could do stuff for myself. But I'm always having to ask everyone else to do things for me....well, I haven't really asked them yet....but I might.   ^^; squee  I should make myself a wishlist. YEAH! That'll be fun. I can't wait!   I've been going to "Go-Gaia.com" lately. It's basically just a forum, but there are things you can do...like....shop. You can make your own charater dude as your avatar and you buy clothes for him or her and other things. Like cat ears. Or tails. Or....a squishy face that hangs off the side of your head. It's pretty addicting.   It would be so awesome if I would stop being so mean and get some decent friends. Wooooh! That'd be cool.   I think I want to go to college. Yep. Not for the hard blarg work, but for the atmosphere. A wise woman once told me that "Highschool stinks. College is cool"  yay! Highschool sounds cool. It's not. College sounds cool. I hope it's better. Life after that doesn't seem so cool. That's stinky.  Being a voice actress would be so much fun! SQUEE! I don't think I could ever do it though. I'm not very energetic when it comes to...umm....when..I'm not energetic.  I absolutely love being energetic! I'm not like that often though. I wish I was. I think I will be.   I'll be leaving again on Thrusday and I'll be back Sunday night. I'm always running around the state, if not out of the state. I think I'm really getting used to this traveling thing. It's not so bad anymore. But I would rather stay home. Public places are fun though. As long as it's not a park of somesort. Those are scary and weird. Bleh.  I'm kinda hungry. No food around. That's stinky. Empty pockets + Empty bellies = Empty tummies  My stuff should be here by now...my anime stuff. The stuff was backordered because something went out of stock, and they get more just for me! Oh, I'm so special! They sent it out around friday ago. Shouldn't it be here by now? Me wants me wants! Maybe it'll come today! I've been waiting very patiently these past two days. Though that's probably why I have that aching pain in my chest and throat. Waiting hurts.   http://006.tenkuu.net is cool. I'm going to put up a link to it soon. I think I'm going to change all my linkies to images to make it look pretty. Lookies pretties are nice.   I wish I had longer fingers. But I'd look even weirder with just longies fingeries. Maybe I should just start growing all over. I hope I'm growing. I've been all pained and stuff lately.   I want brownies. I should start making that wishlist thingy now, because if I don't start now I won't want to later.   What's worse than a sore throat? A really hurtie sore throat.   This is what lack of food does to me.   *GASP!* I WANT SHOES!!! I want to go buy shoes! Someone give me money! I WANT SHOES!! CCCCCCCCOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!  I started counting by eight but then I lost count really bad.   A crap. I have math homework. That's not funny. Smite math. Smite math homework. People need more fun in life. Oddly enough, fun is a big thing to me. Really important. I want to go have fun. Right now. No, not right now. I'm making a wishlist. Oh, that's fun!   SQUEE  I'm going to make a wishlist for my NEEDS(like food) and one for my REALLY REALLY NEEDS MORE THAN FOOD(like fun stuff) and one for MUSIC STUFFETH and one for INTERNETY STUFFETH and one for OTHER STUFFETH and....that's all. I think. For now.   Whee!  I was put on the spot tonight. On Gaia I had this signature thing that was a verse in the bible saying that "if a man should lie with a man like he does with a woman then he should be put to death" because I saw a couple other people promoting homosexualizm and it disturbed me. One of the moderators wrote to me and told me I had to take the verse off because it was encouraging the murder of homosexuals. She was very nice about it and didn't make me feel uncomfortable(a whole lot). I was still kinda worried though. I mean, this is what I believe. Don't all those songs say to stand strong with what you believe in? What was I going to do? And if I didn't take it off I'd probably be kicked out of Gaia. BUT! I came up with a conclusion. The Bible also says to respect your authorities and do as they say. I wrote back to the mod and told her I was regretful to take it off but I completely understood what she meant and the Bible says to respect them. She was very understanding and suggested I put in a Proverbs verse to replace the other one because Proverbs is cool and gives a lot of positive stuff. That's cool. :) Now I need to find a cool verse in proverbs.  Well, I think that's all I can do for now. I shall update later today. Maybe. If I get to it. Twas FUN!!

      Well, I'm baaaack! Got back last night at around 9:30. The trip was....well.....um....long. Brace yourself....  The ride down wasn't too bad. Six hours. Not bad. I took pictures of lots of nothing on the way. The only things interesting were when we finally got to a town and I took pictures of big life savers and signs that say, "Tattoos Forever". Being there was WAY more interesting then that.  The hotel looked more like a gas station. The room smelled like smoke(even though it was a non-smoking area), the ceiling was sagging in, the air conditioning machine thing was duct taped together, the remote didn't work(surpisingly enough the tv did which wasn't so good. 2 straight days of animal planet does things to a person), the fridge didn't work(which we didn't realize till the next day, AFTER we put things in it), the ceiling was sloped up, making the lights and pictures above the beds look crooked, the lighting was atrocious, the bathroom was infested with little wormy bugs, the lightswitch was sideways, and the outlet was busted up.  .....Right after we walked in the room we went out to a dollar store and bought five or six different air fresheners.  The wedding was...nice. Pickle could stop himself from laughing the whole time because he was so nervous. The bride was coaching him along so he wouldn't pass out XD hahaha...! It was definately cute. Very kawaii.  I broke down after the wedding.... Embarrassing to admit, but I did. Not because of the wedding though. Not because the guy getting married was my first crush(that was kinda sad, but cute anyway. HE HUGGED ME! XDDD That was special) My brother was there....I didn't realize that I missed him so much. I was already feeling down when I got there because I always get extremely depressed around Easter time. Every year since I've been a dumb teenager. I hid in the bathroom until bunches of girls started coming in. Then I hid in the car till it was time to leave. My brother stopped by before he had to go to see me. It was so hard to keep from crying in front of him. I would have had to die if I did. I'm sure he knew I had been crying though. I could feel my face getting all puffing infront of him and my eyes were getting red again. Just after I had calmed myself down. He told me to enjoy my vacation. He's so awesome.  I wonder what he thinks about me. I'm always a pansy when he's around. Always crying or being a dork when he's around. I don't cry THAT much and I'm not ALWAYS a dork. He just seems to catch me at the wrong time... I wish he could come home.  I was really frustrated with people while we were there. Some people just can't realize that, Hey, she's in a REALLY BAAAAAAAD MOOOOOOOOD maybe I should LEAVE HER ALOOOOOONE!!!! Arg....that's annoying.  The reception was ..... nice. There were peeps at the door with a card in it with your name and table number. Of course my peep was deformed. The eyes were under the head. Bleh. I should have brought it home with me. I sat at table 9 right infront the door. It was cold and rather dark. First they brought out brocoli soup. I, personally, don't like brocoli soup so I didn't have any, but the people around me didn't seem to like it very much. They kept trying to dive it away to the person next to them! Then they brought out the ..... salad. It was sad. Very sad. That was the worst salad I'd ever seen. Not fresh at all. Looked like week old leaves that were hanging around in the garbage. Seriously. Tasted like dirt. Nice tomato though. Very nice....tomato. The main meal consisted of chicken, little potatoes, and red spice things. Spicey things I stayed away from. They looked scary. Potatoes were okay but kinda tasted like a tree. And I couldn't even attempt the meat(though everyone seemed to like it) because I have a hard time cutting meat and there were these two pro guys sitting next to me. It would have been embarrassing.  So I went and sat with my mom. While I was sitting with her cake was served. The waitress put my peice at my table so I didn't get two slices, but when I returned I found it was given away to someone else by my own sister. So, I didn't eat that night.  After all the eating(or lack of eating) people got on the dance floor and boogied. I boogied right along with them because I needed to have some fun!! OLDIES SONGS!! YEAAAAAAH! That was cool. Did the macarana. I'm really glad Jewels was there. She made it fun.   Sunday, Easter. All morning I could not find something decent to drink!!! The hotel's water was yucky, my chocolate milk was now yucky(no coldness in fridge), no more kool-aid, coffee is yucky, krumpy's water was stale, hot chocolate was WAY hot and I spilled it all over me...geez. So superman came and bought me some apple juice from that coolie donut place. That was nice of him. Well, it was really my dad's money. But superman bought it. Heh heh heh...  The service was really nice. I UNDERSTOOD IT!!! W00T! The singing was great!! They had a whole band thing, and songs I KNEW and LOVED! ALRIGHT!! I'm going to have to go to college there so I can go to that church! There was a girl in the band that shook the tambarines and boy, did she ever do a good job! She was jumping and dancing all over and getting the beat so perfect! She had a cute, pink dress on too. At first I thought she was a little kid and was like, "Wow! That girl is so good at that! And she's dancing too!" But then saw her walk out and realized she wasn't such a little girl. But she was a girl. And she was little. And the sax player looked just like my brother!!! I ALMOST CRIED!! My brother couldn't make it to church that morning because he had to work. But I kept trying to convince myself that that was him up there playing the sax. It really made me sad. I kept starring at him trying to figure it out but it made me almost cry when I saw him sing, I had to make myself watch the dancing girl instead. It was hard.  Went to Chilis after church with the kingers and Jewels. Ate good foooooood. Mmmmmmmm....I want to go back! The waitress was really nice too. She reminded me of the girl in my voice group. Heh heh heh....It was lots and lots of fun was hang around with Jewels and try to get the ice in our drinks to melt with salt before we left. Hehe!!  After eating with the kingers and Jewels, we met up with my brother and ate with him at Friendly's. We sat at two seperate tables because the booths only seat four and there were five. Krumpy sat with my brother. I would have liked to talk to him but I know I couldn't. I wouldn't be able to. Besides......um.....besides......I would have been all weird anyway because of the way I was the day before. How embarrassing.  Most of the trip was waiting... Had to wait 6 hours to get there. Had to wait till it was time to sleep. Had to wait hours to fall asleep(I forgot to mention I had a fever the night before and maybe that night too). Had to wait hours to get ready for the wedding. Had to wait to LEAVE for the wedding. Had to wait to go INTO THE CHURCH for the wedding. ~~~They played FINAL FANTASY MUSIC!!! YAAAAAY!!! That was cool. ~~~ Ahem....Had to wait for the wedding to start. Had to wait for the wedding to be done. Had to wait to leave. Had to wait and wait and wait.   I am not a very patient person.  Well, I'm home now. That's good. I'm going to go draw. Or something. I'm going to go something.     =Lee  Current Music:  Megumi Hayashibara - Give a Reason  Currently eating/drinking: nothing, no food in the house  Current Mood: content

      Took a shower and I guess I feel a little better. Not a whole lot, but at least I don't feel like trapping myself in my room anymore.   I don't know what's worse....being depressed over nothing, or being depressed over  something   Personally, I can handle being upset about  something  but it's harder because it's  there . It's easier to be upset about nothing but it's harder on the mind.   Well, here are my school grades! They're not as good as last year but their good nontheless. It made me happy to see a 90 on there! AND IN SCIENCE!!   It's a little hard to read but you'll figure it out.

      So, I haven't done pictures yet. I'm sorry about that. I'm not feeling too well and I have other matters on my hands that I need to attend to.  In and earlier entry I commented on how I don't like to have my stuff critiqued. Well, I finally brought myself to posting one of my old poems in a forum. How can I ever make it better if it's never critiqued? How can I ever make myself known if I'm too afraid to show anyone?   As is, this is simple verse, it isnt ready to be a poem yet. The only device it has going for it is weak structural repetition. It at least sets out the concept you wish to portray, the feeling of Isolation, rejection, and a desire for vengance. At least you now have an Idea what you wish your piece to be about. Now you must decide what genre you wish to write it in, be it traditionalist, modernist, postmodern, etc. Once this is done recast the piece in the genre, it can be a visualization of the scene filled with rich imagery. It can be a fragmented Postmodern collection of moments, pasted together. You could create an extended metaphor, or use deep phrase and develop the meaning out of this. You could even remake it with strict form or rhyme.  Remember that everyone has felt the same way at some point and time, to make this simple statement of emotion into a poem you must present it in a memorable fashion. Increase the technical complexity while not increasing the difficulty of reading. This isnt a poem yet, but it is the place to start one.     That's what the response was. It hurt. But not as bad as I thought it would. It didn't come crashing down on me, killing my senses, but it left this lingering pain in my chest telling me something....  The problem is....I don't know what it's trying to say.  This part disturbed me a bit...   Please actually post your new piece, instead of doing as nearly every other person on here and refusing to revise anything you write out of pure laziness. It is sad, but most likely you will read this and ignore it entirely, forgeting it in whole by the end of the week. It is sad, being that this lesson is one that took me a long time to learn, and I am still struggling with it.   That's what hurt the most. Me? Ignore that?! I'm there to learn. That's why I always go to those forums. I want to make my stuff better. That's always the reason. I knew I shouldn't have. Honestly, I knew it would hurt. But I did anyway. But the truth is, I don't want to rewrite it. I'm scared.  Of what?  Rejection.    =Lee  Current Music: Hikaru Utada - Deep River  Currently eating/drinking: nothing  Current Mood: almost content, maybe a little worried

      Birthday today! I'm 15 now. That sounds cool. F-I-F-T-E-E-N. Sounds like the right teen age. I still think fourteen was cool. Childish but not. But childish anyway.  My dad got me cute earrings!! 2 weeks and I can put them in. They're pink! I never liked pink. I was always grossed out about it because pink was the girly girl thing. Now some is okay. Especially if they're cool earrings.  Didn't do a whole lot today. Left school a little early to go OUT OF TOWN to go shopping. Started a new manga series called Pita-Ten. I know I shouldn't have started a new one when I was still in the middle of three others.....but hey, it's my birthday.  Well, I'm going to post some pictures of stuff I got later tonight.  Till then   =Lee   Current Music: can't tell, playlist is messed up  Currently eating/drinking: hot chocolate  Current Mood: content

      Got board account re-activated! YAY!  Birthday tomorrow! Well....kinda today because I opened my presents today....but offcially tomorrow.   I think I liked being 14. Hated school and junk I had to put up with. But liked the age. Teenager, yet still a child. I like being a child. Helps me connect with innocence. Innocence is cool. So is being naive. That's pretty interesting.   I got a sketch pad from my "secret sister" tonight, which got me thinking....It's a bit odd that I'm more concerned about my HOBBY(drawing) then about what I'm actually hoping to do with my life(writing). Makes me kind of worried. I haven't written poety or stories in ages. I've thought about picking up the book and writing but I never know what to do. I seem to be stuck in this inbetween thing. Half of me want to write for a living, but the other half is dying to pick of that pencil and draw. I've thought, "Why don't I just give up on writing and draw for a living? Everyone else seems to think I can draw well...." Maybe I can draw well. But not good enough to sell anything. Never good enough to make anything off of it. Maybe ameaturs would enjoy looking at it for, oh, say, a dollar.   Bummer.  The reason why I started with the whole writing thing was because when I was little I could never find a book that sparked my interest. There were little kids books for kids who wanted to know that dogs chased cats and the sky was blue. I already knew that. Didn't need to read about it. Then the book section jumped right up into the adult books. There was no inbetween. Just pop-up books and How To books. Not much to choose from. So I started writing my own. I loved to read, but could never find anything that met my standards. I said that I knew people. I knew what kids my age wanted in books. So I wrote....Not very good, may I add, but I was little. Now I'm older and I can write better, yet now I realize there's more out there than I thought. Everworld, Claudie Journals, Ella Enchanted.... Just like with my drawings. I've found so many other, better works, that I have a hard time keep up with my own. I love those books. I love those other drawings. But it angers me to read or look at them because I'm always comparing them with mine. I can't sit through a movie without thinking, "Why can't I think of a plot like that?" and an anime, "Why can't I draw like that!?".   One of my most frusterating traits.... Comparison.  But I've stuck with my drawings. I can tell they're better than my older ones, but still, they seem to be getting harder to draw. I can't think of anything to draw. I have to force myself to doodle SOMETHING before it kills me.   Writing is different. I can't force myself to. It seems impossible. I write all this in my blog all the time, but that's my personal issues. I know how to make a character. I know how to build him or her. I can create the character's world. But I can't set them free. I can't let them out into their world because I can't think of anything to have them do! What's a story that has nothing happen?! NOTHING!  What's worse is I'm terrified of critisizm. I know it helps. I know it's good for me. I know I need more of it. But it's terrifying.  I NEED to get back into the habit of writing. Problem is....I don't want to.    =Lee   Current Music: Reika Noda - Owaranai Mono ~ Forvevermore  Currently eating/drinking: nothing   Current Mood: content

      I have such a headache...owie. I guess that's what you get when you lie in bed for five hours reading and only stopping to grab some dry frosted flakes or to go to the bathroom.  Yeah, I'm not feeling well today. Throat hurts. Tummy is guggy. Body is sore. And.....stuff.   Finished off my pocky today too. Original and strawberry. How sad. I'll have to get some more. I miss it already.  That reminds me, I'm ordering some anime from discountanimedvd.com and it should be coming sometime this week! yay! That's a pretty sad "yay" because I'm only getting one out of the four things I was supposed to get. First thing I took off the list because it was kinda expensive compared to the rest and I decided to get it later. So that's 3-4 Then one of the items went out of stock. 2-4 Still okay I guess but still kinda sad. Oh well Then after I send them the money the other item goes out of stock. 1-4 That's sad. That's tragic. I would cancel the order completely but my sister is ordering stuff on the same list and the money is already sent anyway.  How sad.  I didn't even get any pocky.   THAT'S tragic.   After I get this order I want to get some other stuff from another site too. But I have to wait to get my ONE thing before I can order something else. Mom's orders. Since she's the one that writes out the checks and everything.   The problem is is that all the stuff on the other site is on clearance and there's a limited amount and I seem to have this problem with things going out of stock before I can get to them. I think I'm going to go check on my order now to see if they even have the money yet.   That one site hasn't updated their downloads either. That's sad.  Nope. Still pending. They haven't got the money yet or they would have shipped. Sunday is coming too. Mail doesn't like Sundays. Foolish mail. Shape up!  That's all I've been wanting to do lately. Spend money on anime. It's better than spending it on things that just go to waste.....like......food.  I hope I never have to spend money on food. I can't cook anyway. Maybe I'll just live on popcorn and hotdogs for the rest of my life. Or is that expensive? Maybe I should learn to cook maccaroni and cheese. Or bake. Or...whatever you want to do to it. I should learn to make mac and cheese. That's it.  I need to stop being stupid. It's not very nice. Especially to the people around me. Although, I don't think they really care. But maybe that's because they think I'm just like that. Well, I'm not. I think. I do. And it's not about stupid stuff. I just usually have nothing intelligent to say to people so I either don't say anything at all or I just make some stupid noise.   Oh yeah, the guestbook is KINDA fixed. Or, more like a new one because something wierd happened with the last one. And OHHHHHHHHH YOU ARE NOT LAME!!!! XDDD YOU ARE SO CUTE!   I'm sorry for calling you lame, Lufmadda. I thought you were some loser guy trying to be all weird. I shouldn't have freaked out. But I had fun yelling at you! XD HAHAHA  Oh, I like this song. I should stop writing and go listen to it because you're probably bored of reading all this gobble-de-goop by now anyways.  Ahh....advil. Reminds me of that book. She keeps advil in her backpack and gave like four to that perfect knight get when they were giving him the transfusion with two pens.   =Lee   Current Music: Chara - Tsumi Fukaku Aishite  Currently eating/drinking: last half stick of pocky  Current Mood: tired, but other than that, quite alright

      Hallelujah! What a miracle! I was sure my last post was deleted because when I clicked "Publush Post" my pages closed and some error popped up. I almsot started crying again.

      It's been a while since I last cried. It's about time I got some of that salt out of my eyes. I wish I would hurry up and get it over with though. It hurts my throat. My nose gets all gross too. How annoying. Crying is annoying. Death upon tears!  Why am I crying? Well, this is me trying to think up excuses... I'm stressed I'm tired I feel neglected  There, those are my reasons. Now, would someone give me a hug and tell me to get over it?!   Went to see Ella Enchanted today. Oh, man...It was so.....I mean, INSANELY.....disappointing. The theater stopped playing it after it ran for only two weeks because no one was showing up to watch it. I'd been pushing people to take me there before it was out of theaters... Three years. I waited three years to go there and have them tell me it wasn't playing. Maybe that's why I'm crying. I know I'll just have to buy the movie sooner or later anyway. But it's not the same. I'll probably hate the movie anyway. It looks really bad from the previews. Well, there's another thing to add to my...."This is a poo list" list.  I know I'm being an idiot, some sometimes you just have to be an idiot. I can come back at myself with all these words saying, "You'll get over it. It's not the end of the world. That is so selfish. Stop being so immature and grow up." I know all those things. But at the moment, I don't care. Tomorrow I'll be perfectly fine(hopefully) and I'll smile some time throughout the day. I'll think, "How could I be so stupid?" but I won't understand.   "What's wrong?" "...I don't know" "Oh, okay, good-bye"  Thank you for caring. And I know you do. But....  I think I'm going to stay up late tonight. I'll find something to do. Hopefully. Like....eat....or draw. Or eat and draw. I can't sleep when I'm like this anyway. That's probably why I could sleep for those months. I don't know.  Am I spelling probably right? Probabbly. Probablly. Probabley. Yeah, I think I was spelling it right before. Yay for me....  I played DDR Extreme today. I wasted money on it too. The first time I played I chose the wrong option and it was defiantly not the easy option. Didn't get through 10 seconds of it before the "FAILED" came up. So we tried it again. That happened the last time too. That was a bummer. Ending it off with a bad one. I want that game a lot. Someone donate? Please?  Yeah, I'm definitely stalling. I don't want to go to my room. It will make me depressed.   Watched Peter Pan today. That was such a good movie. Though the TV we watched it on was really close to death and all the people's faces were green. It made their eyes look so pretty though. The boy that played Peter Pan was so cute. I wanted to adopt him and take him home with me. The ending was sad though. I don't see how they could make it good though. His home was in Neverland. Wendy's home was with her parents. They had to be apart. They were supposed to be together...and live happily ever after. What's a romantic story without the guy and the girl being together? He lied to her too. He said he would return to her and visit. But he never did. I wonder if he died because of sorrow?  I met Luffmado's puppy today. He's the cutest bugger. He's very tiny and won't be much bigger when he's a grown doggie. What a lovely thing. Too bad he has to piddle every ten or twenty minutes. He's must be a handful to take care of. Such a sweetheart though. Such a doll....he's so cute when he's asleep ^^  Which reminds me...Davy won't be at camp this year. I'm going to miss him lots. None of the original staff with be there because of work and college. I won't be there the first week because I'm going to be away. Krumpy and Srah will be at college. I dunno if Chef will be there. We didn't really bond much anyway last year so I don't know if it really matters much to me. I hope that lady doesn't try to take my place in canteen(the staff sells candy and drinks to the youth). Let us list the reasons....  She's not a teenager! Canteen is the teen job! It always has been and I'm not going to let that lady change it!!! AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGG FEAR MEEEEEEEEE She doesn't know how the system works. It takes a lot to train a person. Especially someone like her.  It's very fast pace! I don't think she could handle it, let along " HELP " There's not that much room in there. You need to have at least three people. Two for cards, AT LEAST one for running around and grabbing stuff(VERY TOUGH AND FAST PACE JOB). I'm sorry but, there's not enough room for you lass! Besides.....she's bossy and annoying.  I know I'm being rude and mean. Boy, does it feel good to dump it. Sometimes you just gotta do it. Not all the time though. That'd be bad.   I'll hopefully catch the second week and get to retake my position. It won't really be all that fun without Davy or Srah. But it's better than nothing. I really hope I can make it....  Well, I changed the layout to my webpage. I think it looks much nicer now. Go educate yourself. I put up the "Meet Lee" page too so you can go there and find out some stuff about me. Not stalking though. I don't like that. I wouldn't be happy if you tried that. That would be mean.  Speaking of "mean". When we were at the theaters we though about seeing "Mean Girls". I want to eventually see it because it really depicts life at school well, but I think it would be a really crude movie and I wouldn't want to watch it with other people.  I'm strange. I know. I get picky about how I watch movies. So eat me.  Oh yeah, food. I'm going to go grab some. Potty too. That outta be fun. Gotta have my Pops...  Why do they have so many Corn Flakes boxes in those 30 pack cereal assortment things? Does anyone even like Corn Flakes anymore? Come on! Keep up with the times! We've movied onto bigger and better things like...Lucky Charms and Cheerios! Raisin Bran! Rice Crispies! Shredded Wheat! SUGAR COATED EVEN! Frosted Flakes are better then...CORN Flakes. Sheesh.   I'm not too happy about how these Pops came out. All crushed and powdery-like. Like the bottom of the box. That's gross.  I miss my mommy. I want her to come walking down the stairs and talk to me. I always hoped that when I was a child and I would sit outside her room praying, "Lord, please tell her I need her and make her come out to me". Obviously the Lord had other plans. Sometimes I wish He would just go along with the little things I wanted though. I want my mommy. Is that so much to ask?  No offense to anyone, but I think Rocky Road anything tastes yucky.   I just had the craving to go skiing. Maybe it'll snow.... Oh yeah, it's the middle of May.   I hope school picks up and heads out soon. I'm sick of it. I want these stupid tests to hurry up and get over with. Bah, I don't even want to write about it.  So, I guess I am done rambling on about nothing. I have nothing better to do("There's always something better to do. Draw!" I can't draw like this) but I can't think of anything else to talk about either. I suppose I could try to sleep, but I know I couldn't. I'll start thinking again and get myself all worked up and won't be able to sleep OR type. Maybe I'll find something to do while I .... wait. I don't know what I'm waiting for though. Maybe I'm waiting to pass out. Maybe I'm waiting for dawn. Maybe I'm waiting for the end of the earth. Crap, I hope the world doesn't end tomorrow. I'd hate for the world to end when I'm in a bad mood. Or when I just learned how to play DDR. That'd stink.  peices. and fishk  =Lee   Current Music: none Current food/drink: cookie Current Mood: not happy

      Mommy is okay....Geez, I thought she was going to die. I wanted to get away so badly but I didn't want to leave her. There was nothing I could do(especially with me freaking out) but I still had to be there. Any opportunity to leave, I would take it, but I couldn't. I'm glad I couldn't, but at that moment I'd do anything to be away.   Scared I twas.   Mommy is feeling better now though. Phew...I need her.   I don't particularly want to go into details so I'll make it quick. Sis called dad and he came home and brought Mum to the hospital. She came home a few hours afterwards and was feeling alot better. Good good. But even thinking about it makes me want to cray again. So I'll stop.  Stop thinking about it.   Things have been frustrating this week and it's only Tuesday(almost wensday, I need to go to bed). I need to look around for my emotion pill things before I kill someone O.o I drew some pretty cool pictures and put them in my  urlLink Xanga  page. I got pretty mad about the idiots that came into my post(I posted my oekaki on Gaia) and completely sucked everything that was good about the picture and spit on it. Arg....morons. I've only recently seen them. There's about three and they're going everywhere trashing people's art. Come on! We're not trying to be perfect! We're just sketching and making it look half decent and showing it off to people. Morons.  So, with that frustration out of the way, let us move on to more important things.  Was drafted into the Youth Service for this Sunday tonight. Fun stuff. Originally, I didn't really want to have anything to do with the youth anymore. They're really just a bunch of kids from school that got together and said, "We are youth. Bow to us" and give no respect to anyone. Little magots. But I think I'm getting to like them. The majority anyway. No, not the majority. The minority. Maybe. I'll have to check back on that one. Well, one of the girls was having a rough time tonight about her solo thing that she's going to sing, so I'm backing her up. Sort of. She not going to lead the song before it with the group so I'm going to. That's pretty much it. But before she got there we had to start(she was running late....-_-) so I took on her role for the while. It was actually fun, but when she got there I think I got intimidated. Whooo....  I'm hoping to get some video clips of the practice and the real thing too but I'm a bit worried about the camera. It's my mom's and I don't want the mag-....youth....to hurt it. It's VERY EXPENSIVE. I just don't really want her to have to worry about it or come along, because I know she really doesn't want to have to put up with them. I can handle it on my own. I think. Yeah, I can. I already told one of the guys I'd strangle him if he wouldn't behave.   Well, spinach quiz tomorrow. Social quiz tomorrow. Signed up for Social regents(...almost). I have to get moving. I haven't really had a chance to study yet and it's almost 12. I was just going to wait for my folder to move on the other drive(would take about 2 hours) but there's still 50 minutes left. It's very inaccurate. Time to sleep. Hopefully I'll get a chance to stufy in the morning. What was I doing all afternoon, you ask? Playing Parappa the Rapper 2(beat it, it was lame. First one was better) and MR. MOSQUITO!!!! That game is fun stuff. Someone buy it for me. I take donations! What was I doing while I was waiting, you ask? Drawing you silly goose!   Well, time to lay me down to sleep. And if I die before I wake...I guess I really won't have to worry about those quizes, will I!  Let's just hope I live through the night. I still have to get married you know!    =Lee  Current Music: sompathing. Christian radio songies  Current food/drink: NONE  Current mood: ...unsure. Really

      My mooma is sick :[  I am too. :[  I'm going to Cysse's house tonight and we're going to play DW3(yeah, I got it yesterday, Jak and Daxter too....whee!) and I'll just get a ride with her to church and come home afterwards. I was just going to come home tonight because my mom is sick but I have no way to get home. She worries me.....  I'm terrified. This is even worse then when Kether told me he was going to commit suicide.  Oh mommy, please don't be sick.  I want to stay with her but I can't. I can't handle this. I have to go away

      Yes! I got a 24/28 on my NYSSMA solo. Unlike last year, I didn't freak out and cry afterwards. I did really bad last year and I didn't deserve the good score that I got. I think I almost completely deserved my score this year. If I was judging me I would have given me a 22 or something. But WOOHOO!! I did fine. Just not the best. I could have done better but it was really early in the morning.  It's been a rough couple of days. I'm having some problems with someone I know. Have you ever had those people in your life that no matter how much you love then and care for them, you just can't get through to them on what's best? It's drving me insane. So many things happen at the same time that I just can't keep myself straight on these things...  Speaking of being "straight" ...... My sunday school class has started a petition on being against gay marriages. I've finally gotten it written up and printed out so I will start getting signatures tomorrow. Hopefully I won't chicken out on asking people to sign. Also,  I want to get signatures from people online too. There are certain rules that go along with this, but if anyone wants any information on it PLEASE CONTACT ME and we will make arrangements.   Yay yay! I got a PS1 from someone the other day for free! I've never actually had a game system of my own. They've all belonged to my brother. But now  I  have one. Woohoo for me! Now all I want to know is what this guy was eating when he got all the insides and out sticky.  These are the things I've ordered that I'm expecting in the mail soon....  Jak and Daxter Jak II Dynasty Warriors 3 Kick the Can Crew - Good Music  Yay for me!  Well, I have stuff to do...that I forgot to do earlier. So I must be off  FAREWELL!!

      School's out. YAY!!! .... yay.....  ya.....y....  *falls asleep*  I am so tired. My brother came up on Friday and we stayed up till 5........30...... playing Warcraft 3. It was lots of fun! We died right near the end though... It was that multiplayer spirity one where you pick a hero and go through this dungeon type place. He needs to come back so we can play again!  I'm sorry for defending my hobbies. I'm sorry for defending my life. >>>>>>   urlLink Stinkers.  Die. Er....be shot.  I'm helping out with VBS this week. The theme is "Rackshaw Rally", or in other words, Japanese. It's really cool! The props in Kim's room are fun fun! Her aunt is Japanese so it was easy for her to get fans and things. Yay. I dressed up sort of orientalish today(fits the theme, duh XP) and I gave Benty some chop sticks to put in her hair. There was this one, sweet little girl that would say, "Look at the Japanese girls!" everytime she saw us ^^ When it was time to leave she came up to me and asked why I had sticks in my hair. I told her that japanese girls would put their hair up with them and it would make them look pretty. You could take them out and eat with them to! She thought that was so cool. "Bye Japanese girl!" I have to dress up again tomorrow, just for her ^^  I don't want to doooooo anythiiiiiiiing. Nope. Nothing. I didn't even want to update this but I made myself. I've been making myself do a lot of things lately. I finally got my pictures scanned(oh yeah! Gotta update my art page!) , I got this updated, I woke up this morning... It's amazing! I need to go get dreamweaver and put it on here too. I need to find it first. My website is lonely T_T  I should go to that now.   =Lee  Current listenings :: radio Current eats :: nuffin Current moods :: mix between furious and happy

      Well, school is finally OVER WITH! Kinda .... I still have to take that regents on Friday but I think I'll be okay. I studied for a while today. Finished up "Weather and Climate" and "Geologic Time". I think that's what they were called anyway. Maybe I should study more ^^;;  I thought things would be great after school got out. Well, they are. But they could be better. The computer is being naughty. I can barely turn it on without it rebooting again. Stinky thinks it's Sasser but I'm pretty sure it's that controversy between XP and the net. Something not compatable... Or the guy that built it had corrupted software. So, I haven't had a chance to work or scan in my sketches. I've been waiting to have time to work on them for so long, and now I'm out of school and the computer is pooey. Ah well, at least I'm free. Almost.   I think that's all for now. I don't want to make things too long or the computer will shut down and everything I write will be lost(happened earlier).  Good days.   =Lee  Current Music :: nothing Current Eats :: nothing Current Moods :: content

      At the moment I can't even think of my dad without crying. I'm so mad at him, but the stupid thing is, he didn't do anything wrong. He's just telling me what to do like he's supposed to. But I hate it. I love my dad, he's a great guy, but I always dread that time when he comes in the house because I don't know if he'll be in a good mood or a bad one, or if he'll lecture me again on how I have to do so much better at everything then my other siblings, or how I can do something stupid, or just something that I can't handle him saying to me. I remember once when he said something to me that really upset me and he freaked out and said, "Can't I even talk to my kids without them crying?!"  Sorry...   I'm too tired to cry, but I am. I'm such and idiot. I wish I could have gone back with my brother and Eri. I should have gone to church this morning with my mom. I was thinking about it but she would have been gone before I got to her.   I should go back to studying before my sister wakes up and sees me crying.    =Lee  Current Music = none Current eats = I think I just ate a cupcake Current Mood = confused, frustrated, furious, depressed, stressed, all of the above

      First off I need to apologize for not updating. We got a new computer a couple weeks ago and it's been naughty. I was going to update this and my webpage at the same time but since dreamweaver was never put on here since we're going to get a different puter....  Bad me.  I probably won't be able to update much this coming week because I have finals and so much stuff to study for. I was studying for my Earth Science regents a bit ago and I'm taking a break.   I have a  urlLink shop  now at Gaia. I'm selling my awesome marshmallow squishy toy/pet things that I drew during science class. Bad me. They're not selling well yet but that's because I have a really .... I mean REALLY bad layout. You can barely see the pictures through the "SAMPLE" letters. Not good. Not good at all. Once school gets out I'm going to redo it all. I'm hopefully going to get them to animate sometime soon. Sometime. Soon. It'd be nice to get up an avvi shop too. Not today though.   I'm getting my new glasses on wensday! Yay! I'll have to post a picture.  Oh yeah! Check my art page for updates.   Stuff happened yesterday. MY BROTHER GOT MARRIED! Wow. That's all...I really have to say. Wow. It was so sudden. No one really knew about it until the day before. Wow.  Since my computer is being naughty I shouldn't make my posts long(it's been giving me the blue screen of death and it likes to do that when I'm making something or writing stuff like this).    =Lee   Current Music - None, my connection just died Current eats - COOKAYS Current Moodies - Almost not stressed

      Off we go to OffWeGo tomorrow. I'm all packed(I think) and ready for a fun week with Lord Conti, Eri, and Luca. YAY! We're supposed to alter some clothes and go to da thrift store! YAY! I hope I do okay there.... I've been having some touble lately. I think it's because I haven't been getting any sun. Lack of sun = depressing. Lots of it.   Well, check up on my art page. I've been keeping busy. I really need to get those links back up to it and other places. I have been putting that off.

      Man.... I just finished watching Full Moon(ep 06) and it actually made me cry. The little girl in the story acts tough to everyone but the stuffed kitty she finds and takes(who is actually real). The owner of the stuffed animal finds her and tries to get him back but the little girl refuses. Mitsuki(the owner) finds out that the girl is actually lonely. She claims that she doesn't have a home or parents but a little later Mitsuki finds out that the girl was lying so the girl takes her to where her parents are working in a grocery store.  &nbsp;   "But....when you entered the store they didn't say anything at all, did they?"    "That's how it always is."    "Always?"    "Everyday," &nbsp;   &nbsp; .....    &nbsp;   "When you go home you'd say "I'm home," and they'd say "Welcome back," right? Because I....if I had&nbsp;a father and mother I would say "I'm home," and I'd want them to say "Welcome back"! And you say that you have parents. Why!?"     &nbsp;    She tears up and starts to cry... "Because I also want to talk to my mother and father, and there are lots of things I want to say. But, they're always busy, so....I....I....    &nbsp;   I miss my parents... I have things I want to tell them. What's wrong with me? I just feel like I'm not close to them anymore. I hate this. I don't know what I want. I don't know how to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;-Lee  Currents :: watching Full Moon, chewing on gum, feeling lots of things.

      I've finally figured out what I want to do in life(job-wise). Comic books! It combines the two things I love to do most in life. Write and draw!  But....  Drawing is a whole heck of a lot harder than writing. To me anyway. Especially in comic form. I draw poses, not action. It's tough. I've tried many times to create a comic. Problem is the story turns out yucky because I'm afraid to do anytime complicated because I won't be able to draw it! I already have a story set up for a comic but.... *shakes head* I can't do it. I don't know anything about making comics. I've read them, sure. I have over 100$ worth of graphic novels on my shelf and Robotech comics(comic comics. not graphic novels).  I don't know what to do. I can't rely on artbooks my whole life. I can't get anywhere if I don't move on.... but I can't.   >>>   -Lee  current listenings :: (FLCL soundtrack)The Pillows - Bran-new lovesong current eats :: -- current mood :: undecided

      I didn't want to leave. I felt like a real person there. No one important, just real.      7.03.04  The sun shines - Traveling Circus  We left around 5 for OffWeGo with Lord Conti(aka bro), Eri, and Luca. I was kind of nervous and even thought of turning back. But I sat in that seat and locked myself in with that belt. My hand was clutched around the door handle for most of the ride, but I still went.  We were stopped my the ...BORDER PATROL... (gotta say that fast and do the hand thing, ask me and I'll demonstrate) mostly because....we all looked....funk-ay. Luca was in the back with her curly hair all flipped to one side from the wind and she had on her blue blockers! That probably set things off a bunch. Eri had her head half out the window on her side because she was feeling sick(needed air) and her hair was scary too. Then pilot(Lord Conti) and co-pilot(me) were both suspiciously looking .... like we both had on blue shirts. That was kind of ... really funny. But the officer jerk was being and officer jerk. He deserved a kick.  Mah clothes and books. XD Then we stopped at dunkin' donuts and played DDR on the floor tiles while waiting for bagels. So, we got to the appartment and played DDR for an hour or two and got some sleeps.     7.04.04  And they sing - Freedom  I went to church with Lord Conti that morning. I really did like how the preacher spoke. It was more like he was talking to us. It was on the Creation too, and I like that. The church mostly consisted of oldies though. Kind of smelled funny.  After church we played DDR for a while(yeah, we're obsessed, Luca now has Midnight Blaze and Orion burned into her mind XD) and then walked around town for a while, saw the parade. It was really cool. I'd never seen a marching band before. We left when the firetrucks started coming in a blowing their horns. I don't like that.  We went to a friend's house that night too and had a BBQ. It was lots of fun. We each had our own awesome cool animal plate. If I can get the pictures from Luca I'll post them. They're awesome. Once again, DDR. We left kind of early though because some stupids came over and started drinking. We didn't see much of the fireworks either. That's too bad....    7.05.04  The rain falls - Empty Hands  Sticks and Mon came up and them, Lord Conti and I walked to the lake to draw. We specifically had set aside this day for drawing. It was awful. I think Lord Conti intimidates me with his drawing. He can show me things and teach me, but I can't do it when he's around. Especially this time. I haven't been able to draw for two weeks. He was sitting right there. Right next to me. Watching. Trying to make me understand. I couldn't do it. I just sat there with tears in my eyes. Watching the goofy little boys throw popcorn in the lake, starring at the sidewalk. I just couldn't do it. It seemed like forever, but we finally went back and later that night we went to the comic book store. It was a really cool store but I'm not that interested in comic books. Not the old ones anyway. I saw some comic issues of Ah! My Goddess but I didn't want to start a comic book series when I wouldn't ever return there anyway. They were back issues and expensive anyway. Saw some cool action figures and a graphic novel called "Shadow Star" It looks really good. It was #4 though so I didn't buy it. I'm looking into the series though. Need to work first.  Made pizza and bread sticks when we got back. Jorge came over and we played DDR....again!    7.06.04  Bright Days - The Mysteries Did nothing but play Final Fantasy X all day with Luca spectating and trying to strategize and figure things out. That was fun though!!    7.07.04  Inner Warmth - Walking Elegance Went shopping! That was fun stuff! Luca and Eri got me all dress up mostly all day and I even got some stupid cool pants! YAY! I got a coolie fan too. I should take pictures and post 'em. Yes, we played DDR in the arcade too. Heh heh. Sticks, Mon, and Lord Conti left early so we could run around more. Whee. On the way back we stopped and grabbed flowers off the side of the road. We're so bad. Sweet Peas they were. Sweet Peas.....    7.08.04  As it pours - Once Again Another day of nothing but FFX and cooking at times. :]    7.09.04  The Lightened - Broken Endings We went back to the mall that day because my mom and sister came up to bring me home. I got really depressed half through the day. I love my family, but I loved my "other" family too. I didn't want to leave. I didn't want to leave my friends behind. I wanted to stay with them forever. I want to go back. I want to live again. I miss them so much and I've only just gotten home. I'll see them next weekend...but....   Now that I'm home, I'm depressed again. Something is wrong with my mom. Midlife crisis or something. It pushed me down. I've seemed okay all day but I know that I'm not. It's not real. I've lost my smile. Home isn't happy anymore, and I don't know why... Home used to be safe. Now I feel alone.     =Lee  Current Music - A Christian Radio Current Eats - hashbrown!

      I actually want to be sewing and crouqeting but sewing is hurting my brain right now because I really have to think this pattern through and I don' t know how to start another row with crouqeting. So sad. I am kinda lonely right now, but I don't want to talk to anyone. I'm being a drug again. I was so happy today. It was a permenent smile most of the day. Right up until my mom said we were spending 3 days in a car rather than 2. Not fun. I hate being cramped up in a car. Then I just got quiet and lonely. I didn't want Mom to go to bed because I wanted her somewhere around me. I know she'll still be hanging around in the morning but I have to do a lot of work again tomorrow and work makes me grouchy(as you may have noticed).  I feel really bad about venting like that the other day. I feel like a sticky moron for freaking out over stupidness. Bah.  I want to be writing right now. I should have picked up a notebook today. I really want to write a story. That doesn't happen often. I just need more ambition. I want to continue the story titled "I ran" (name is only temporary, until I finish the book and come up with something spoon-like) only I want to change the main character to a girl. I guess that would be better because I can actually directly relate that way. I need to find it and type up some things. My problem is I always get stuck and I have a hard time connecting everything together.  I'm kind of sick of poo-ey people now and I wish I could just move on with life without having to worry about everyone. Why do you have to have feelings I can hurt?  Anyway....  I'm not doing much at all right now. There are so many things I want to do but I don't have any ambition. Maybe I'll get a guestbook for my site. Yeah, run fun.    -Lee  current music - Pillar - Bring me down current eats - just finished a sammich current feelings - too tired for those

      >vent  Once mom said we were getting paid to do these things that other girl raced around to get everything done so she could add to her already 200 or so dollar drawer. It's not like I am trying to paay of those 60$ I owe her. It's not like I have to earn some money by monday for florida. It's not like I'm broke. She's upstairs taking over my room playing the 50$ game I bought(she's played 5 hours, I've play 1 and she's still up there). Half of my room is covered in clothes she decided to fold(to get money of course) while playing the game; she'll be there longer. I just want to go to my stinkin room and tear things apart and cry still I puke. I don't mind her being in there once in a while, but I'd rather not have her living in there.  Yeah I'm over-reacting. So .... eat my leg. I'm just a tad upset about coming home and not being about to be alone at all. I seem to be the only one who's really upset about Sandy too. She's really gone. I don't know what to do now. She's been here my whole life.  I know. Life will go on. But.... you crap head.   So, I don't care that my writing is more like spurts of half-thoughts. I just want to go to my room and eat my pillow or something.  Too bad it's occupied.      -Lee   Currents: crap crap and more stinkin crap.

      Normally I would write all about what I did all week starting in the morning and ending at that night, then starting on the next day, but sadly enough I can't remember everything we did. I had no idea what the days were all week, so let me try my best...  We arrived on July 21 st   after a very long morning. Mostly I was woken up badly and it sent me right into a bad mood. You never....EVER wake me up saying "Get up! We're leaving in 10 minutes with or without you."   Granny Grunt came with us which was fine, I had just hoped to steal the front seat(I get nauseous in the back) and get to talk to my mom for a while. We didn't stop at the donut shop like we usually do so I starved for four hours.  Anyway, we got there alive. That was cool.  We gave Eri DDR Max2! She really likes it. Me too. Cap-y-tan three.  There was quite some stress that night when Eri's mom called and torn into her because she found out Eri got married.... Things were rough. I think my mom talked to her some and she calmed down. After that we didn't answer the phone.  I learned how to sew while I was there! Eri and Luca helped me. You should see the kids! They're awesom! Without the E! I'm trying to get my webpage updated now that I have dreamweaver but I'm having some trouble. When my dad gets home I'll ask him about it. I'll get the links back up too.  Luca got a job at subway! That's really good! Well, sad that she wasn't around all day but good because....well, it's a job. She said mostly her co-workers are very nice, but there's one girl that could cause trouble, but overall it's good good.  One day when we were bringing Luca to work we kind of.... got hit by a car. *cough* That guy was a jerk. He ramed into us and started driving away! Lord Conti jumped out of the car and chased after him. That guy was a real bone head. Hah.. We couldn't do anything about it though because we didn't think to call the police and Lord Conti couldn't understand much of what the guy was saying. I think the police were being pretty dense about it too when we went there...  Let's see... what else happened? I think it was mostly hanging around and playing Magic Pengel(man, I'm addicted to that game). Oh! We did go to the thrift store and got some cool things. The poo-head old lady did rip us off and was poo-ey about it. She charged Eri 6 dollars for a pack of socks when she said it was a dollar for the pack. She's mental. Luca took them back in and after a bit of arguing and getting frustrated the other lady at the desk forced a return. Good.  That's all I can remember at the moment. When they came here for the reception we still had fun though. DDR, magic pengel, taking pictures, exploring the woods. Fun stuff. We had the reception too which was enjoyable....kind of. Towards the end Luca and I were getting really cranky about things. I'm disappointed about the music too. So disappointed I even had a dream about it. I gave the guy that was playing the piano about 5 or 6 songs(sheet music) which mostly consisted of video game soundtracks. I gave them to him about 2 weeks ahead and he was fine with it. He never played them. I suppose he forgot... But I spent all that time and Lord Conti and Eri specifically asked me to get together the music. I was really looking foreward to it...  It was sad to see them go but I didn't get extremely depressed this time. We played DDR in the arcade just before they left which I think made things better.   Well, other than happenings, let's talk about feelings.  I'm thoroughly confused, frustrated, peeved and ... pooey. That about sums it up. I hate it here and I want to go away. Or at least have everyone else go away. Rawr. You stupids. Just leave me alone! Why can't you let me be happy!!!!?!??!?!?!?! RAAAAWR...   okaaay....       now I'm angry.      -Lee  current eats :: none current sounds :: Dead Poetics - New medicines current feelings :: WHO KNOWS?! rawr?
