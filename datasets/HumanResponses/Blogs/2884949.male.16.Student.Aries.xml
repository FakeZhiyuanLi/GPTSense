      hey there people  I dont really know why I insist on keep writing in this thing, nothing is ever going on in my life lol... well, today, I was skateboardin in my basement, and I came sooo close to landin a kickflip... Im almost there... I  will  have it be the time Spring Vacation gets here.... today, my teacher was talkin to us about not assuming things about others, and she was asking/guessin what our cultural backgrounds were, and what "group" we fitted in... and she called me gothic... and I laughed at her.. cause Im not and stuff... the best part was that I told my friends that she was gonna end up callin me it about 5 minutes earlier... but thats ok, I've gotten overly used to the fact that people call me that... I mean, I do wear all black, but that doesnt mean shit ya know? lol..... alright, well, I gotta look into how much money I need so I can improve my computer...   later  Jerry

      Hey  Well, nothing has gone on really, or at least nothing important enough for me to put in here, but ya know... Actually, I take that back, I did have an interesting weekend, and today was somewhat interesting. I'll start off with my weekend...  Friday, I went over to my friend Derek's house and his cousin, who is also my friend, Shon was over, and we made a video that had a bunch of Jackass stuff in it... It was pretty cool and fun.. Except for the fact that I got a welt mark on my back from getting hit from a leather belt (that was HILARIOUS!), a bruised knee, and I got kicked in the jaw and the eye, leaving me with them both swollen, and my eye has a scab on my upper eye lid... It's all hilarious nonetheless...   Today, me and my friend Tyler were talking about taking over the world.. We got some good plans going hahahaha... Anyhow, now Im outta here  Later  Jerry

I got a bunch of crap, which is also pretty cool.... got some new earrings, no, not the gay kind, a bunch of Ninja Turtle stuff... umm....

      Hello hello,  Well. By the looks of things, TSK is no longer. That is a major blow to the self-esteem. Not really sure why this is so yet, but soon enough I will find out. I suppose that there is always MSK next year.  Man, everything, skateboarding wise, has sucked for me as of the last week or so. Cant land anything, once again, my skate team is no longer, and the skate site I always go to is currently down.. For the second time this week!  Right now, Im listening too Billy Talent. They're good. My mom was bitchin at me, once again. Man she really get's on my nerves. She's pickering about anything and everything that everybody does. If we breathe wrong, she yells. This is really starting to piss me off. Anyhow, sorry about complaining.  Im outta here, nothing else to post.  Later,  Jerry

      Hey,  My skate day sucked balls. I couldnt land anything, not saying I could before. I could land an ollie better than usual, but that is it. IT SUCKED! Im so frusterated right now.. I wanna throw my board, but it's already cracked 3 times, so I dont wanna break it. Thats the last thing I need when it comes to skateboarding.  Anyhow. Thats my day.  Later  Jerry

      Hey,  Well, I was wrong. I didnt have an interview yesterday. It was scheduled for Monday. And because of that, I couldnt skate. It sucked.. Majorly. Oh well, I suppose I'll do better on Monday haha.  But today so far has been excellent. I got the new Invader Zim DVD, which rocks totally, and a little later I get to go skate. So this day cant really go wrong haha. Well, I have nothing really to say anymore, so Im gonna go. I'll write in here to talk about my skate day.  Later,  Jerry

      Hey,  Well, today I have my very first job interview, so Im pretty damn nervous, but I suppose it will all be good in the end. Hopefully I'll get the job, Im in a desperate need of a job hahaha. Oh well.  Well, I havent mentioned it yet, but Im on this little Jackass show called RugBurn, its hilarious. If you wanna check it out, its on mskmi.tripod.com. My picture isnt up there yet, in case you may be wondering, but it should be here anytime now. It's pretty cool, and man does it hurt like you wouldnt believe haha. We'll probably be done with Season 2 here anytime, so order your copy today! Hahaha. I, personally, think that Season 1 was funnier, even though Im not on there. But there is some  REALLY  funny parts on Season 2. I would tell ya some of it, but you have to check it out for yourself.  Hmmm... What else is there to put in here. Nothing really, but I'll post in it again before the day's up to tell how the interview went.  Ignore this, Im just seein what it does.  MSK RULES!   All right, Im gonna go.  Later,  Jerry  P.S. I found out, I did tell some stuff that happened. But I did give you the site for it! Haha

      Mmm, I told you I would break into your blog, didn't I. Jerry?   1) I had to send your password and user name to your  email account  2) I had to break into your email account. Which I did so well with one guess.  3) I had to open the email 4) I had to change the password 5) And Now, I'm here. Writing in your oh so sexy blog.  ;)  For those of you who don't know me, I am the one eyed bandit. Who goes around stealing peoples journals for the hell of it. HAH, no I don't I just wanted to break into Jerry's and write how I'd take advantage of him. 'Cause we all know Jerry's got a little dirrty side to him. [note: the two 'r's)  If Jerry want's though, I don't mind letting him break into my blog. ;) I'd enjoy it.    So anyway, like I told Jerry. Before I broke into his blog. I told him I'd be nice, and he said 'You can just write about how you'd take advantage of me' Yeah, I know he's dirrty, but it's hot! lmao So anyway, I'd take advantage of Jerry any time any day. I don't care where it is, or what the weathers like. Although it can't be in the cold.  ;) Right Jerry? ha   You better not delete this entry when I give you your new password. Cause if you do, I'm going to change it again, and keep your blog for myself. So keep this sucka up here! lol Right, I'm frightening myself, and those of your friends that have a blog will think I'm some sort of nut. But, I'm not really.    Mmm, okay so back to taking advantage of Jerry. -winks- haha, wow, I'm a dirty person. Geesh Jerry, what have you done to me. You've corrupted my mind! You fool!! Hah, okay I'm kidding   Any-ways, I'd like to tare Jerry's clothes off, and have my way with him. Hah, oh yeah.. he'd like it. I know he would. ;)   Haha, hmm.. JERRY IS HOT!

      Hello,  Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I am currently sick of skating. I've done it so much as of late, I could fall over and just.. Die. Or at least something like that. Crazy, eh? Oh well, such is life.   Today, I think I bombed 2 of my finals, so that sucks. Hahaha. I hope I dont fail. But if I do, oh fucking well. I guess it'll suck to be me for awhile. Anyhow. Onto better news. Im listening to Smile Empty Soul. They are pretty good, which is awesome. Hahaha. Yeah. I dont know what else to say in here. My one ear is hurting hahahaha. Oh well. That's ok though, I think.  Anyhow, Im outta here.  Later  Jerry
