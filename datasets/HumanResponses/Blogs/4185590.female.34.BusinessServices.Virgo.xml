      The HRM at my store is such a dipshit!  I'm taking a leave of absence (FMLA) and he tells me he needs me to come in and "meet" with him.  If I wanted to come in at his whim - then I wouldn't need the LEAVE OF ABSENCE!!! I'm not on the clock - I'm on a leave... He is so stupid and doesn't understand ANY labor laws. In other news, hubby and I are going to go to an auction to try and buy a house.  There is going to be an open house this Sunday so that we can see the inside of the house ~ I can't wait to see how it looks!  If things work out, we might be able to get this 3br/2ba house on over 5 acres for less than .... well, let's just hope that we can be the highest bidder..

      Okay.. a little about me. I'm married, with 3 lovely kids and an adorable husband. I have just taken a leave of absence from my job at The Home Depot. HD is a pretty good company, but all of the jobs are very demanding and most of my coworkers feel VERY overworked and consumed by their jobs. Before I worked at the store in my town, I worked at the Store Support Center (aka headquarters) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was involved in arranging travel for associates with the company, and also for assisting with employee/family relocations due to promotions/tranfers, etc. I really enjoyed my job in ATL, and miss my coworkers. Working at a store is a completely different world. I'm glad that HD hires people from all walks of life, different ages, colors, etc. But there is such a HUGE variety of experience in our store - it is very strange. We have 18 year old cashiers that came fresh out of the Kwiky Mart that wear their hip hugging bluejeans with the g-string underwear showing at the top and their boyfriends waiting on them out in the parking lot. We've got 55 year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of 3. We've got weekend warriors, firemen, schoolteachers, students, homemakers, who just want a part time job for a few extra bucks, and high school students working on the lot, pushing carts, and dreaming of making their way in to management one day. I guess VARIETY is the spice of life. And let me tell you - my store has a lot of SPICE.
