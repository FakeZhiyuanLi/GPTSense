      Director: Akira Kurosawa Year: 1958  Until 1950, most of Akira Kurosawa’s films were in the “gendai-mono” style of Japanese cinema.  This refers to his early pictures set in modern times, such as  urlLink Stray Dogs .  Many often dealt with characters trying to survive in a post World War II Japan.  In 1950, Kurosawa made a film that would change his career entirely.  That film was  urlLink Rashomon .   urlLink Rashomon  was the director’s first attempt in the “jidai-geki” (period set) tradition of filmmaking.  “Jidai-geki,” remember that term.  The story becomes slightly ironic at this point.  Kurosawa was always greatly influenced by Western filmmakers, particularly director John Ford.  The Western influence in Kurosawa’s films is easily noticeable when compared to more traditional Japanese films, and so early in his career Kurosawa was not highly favored among Japanese audiences.  It was not until much later, when  urlLink Rashomon  began to win international acclaim with western audiences making him a respected director world-wide, that the Japanese began to warm up to him a bit.  In turn, numerous western directors have sighted Kurosawa as a primary influence on their story-telling style and/or specific films.  To take it one step further, many of Kurosawa’s films have been adapted and remade for western audiences, some of which have become very important classics.  Kurosawa’s  urlLink The Seven Samurai  (1954) was re-made in America as  urlLink The Magnificent Seven  (1960.)   urlLink Yojimbo  (1961) has been re-made twice as  urlLink A Fistful of Dollars  (1964) and  urlLink Last Man Standing  (1996.)  And  urlLink The Hidden Fortress  has been sighted as a major influence on George Lucas’  urlLink Star Wars .  “Jidai-geki,” recognize that now?  I was amazed to learn this when I did.  The term Jedi has become one that is often thought of as synonymous with bravery, honesty, and chivalry (and certainly never…Adventure.  Heh.  Excitement.  Heh.  A Jedi craves not these things.)  These are often very common themes in Kurosawa's period piece tales.  As a film student, Lucas was intrigued by the storytelling style used by Kurosawa in  urlLink The Hidden Fortress , in which the entire plot is told through the experiences of its two lowliest characters.  In Kurosawa’s film these characters are Matashichi and Tahei, two farmers who are trying to escape imprisonment during a feudal war in Japan and looking for gold in any place they may find it.  When the pair meet up with a lone man on the road who promises them gold in exchange for their cooperation, a wily adventure is under way.  Their cooperation is needed by General Rokurota Makabe (Toshiro Mifune)to haul 200 pieces of gold and escort the young Princess Yuki through enemy territory in an attempt to reclaim her throne.  In  urlLink Star Wars , the obvious counterparts are R2-D2 and C3-P0, who also wind up almost unwillingly becoming involved in an adventure that is much larger than they are.  Lucas also took inspiration from  urlLink The Hidden Fortress  in 1999’s  urlLink Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace , in the new story-line involving Princess Amidala.  One scene from the former is particularly echoed in the latter when a stand-in Amidala is used as a decoy to distract her enemies, the same tactic was used by Princess Yuki in  urlLink The Hidden Fortress .  One can only assume that Lucas hoped to pay homage to a man that he admired who had died only the year before.  At times exciting, and often very funny, Akira Kurosawa’s  urlLink The Hidden Fortress  is a classic of cinema history that can be enjoyed today and will continue to be enjoyable for many years to come.  The Criterion Collection has delivered the film in its beautiful original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 with Dolby 3.0 sound, preserving on DVD a film that is worthy of treasuring.

      Director: Melvin Van Peebles Year: 1971  Headline: "SWEET SWEETBACK WILL NOT GO GENTLY INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT!"  And the history of black cinema followed right behind him.  After directing five major motion pictures in Hollywood, Melvin Van Peebles decided to tell a story from different angle.  His angle.  The angle of the black community.  With a story full of racial injustice and white oppression, Van Peebles geared up to make  urlLink Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song , only to be turned down by every studio he approached and almost every financier as well...almost.  With funding from comedian Bill Cosby, the first "blaxploitation" film in cinema history and a new genre were born.  Until the release of  Sweetback , the black community was treated any way that white mainstream (read studio heads) saw fit.  After Van Peebles' huge financial success, a wave of new black-power films were released featuring black heroes fighting "The Man."   Dolemite ,  Shaft , and  Foxy Brown  all have  Sweetback  to thank for their success and longevity.  Sweetback, played by Melvin Van Peebles himself, is a street hustler who pleases the ladies in order to make a buck and get by, apparently he's pretty good at too!  While on a ride downtown to the police station with a couple of crooked cops (Sweetback is posing as a suspect to make the cops "look good") he witnesses the brutal beating of a black revolutionary.  After a swift internal debate, Sweetback decides to take matters into his own hands, attacking the cops to save the man.  The remainder of the film consists of Sweetback running, eventually reaching the Mexican boarder, to escape the pursuit of a ton of crooked white cops.  Along the way we witness police drilling anyone suspected of harboring Sweetback, but no one will help the cops even in the face of torture and harassment.  The community that Sweetback stands up for, in turn stands up for him.  While the film may not be a huge cinematic achievement when placed alongside the average motion picture of the same time period, one must remember that Van Peebles wrote, produced, scored and starred in the picture himself with next to no money to do it with.  All things considered, it turned out pretty great.  Any technical shortcomings the film may have are dwarfed by its social and financial achievements.  In addition to influencing an entire generation of filmmakers, Sweetback eventually made a total box-office run of $10 million.  All of Van Peebles trouble and hardship experienced during the making of the film are now documented in son Mario Van Peebles' film  urlLink "Baadasssss .  Upon reflection, Melvin's sacrifice and suffering seem to have been worth-while considering the result: a powerful film for the black community which empowered so many people who had never had such an opportunity in the past.

      Director: Sam Fuller Year: 1953   urlLink Pickup on South Street  is perhaps my first experience with classic film noir.  Staged in 1950's New York City, Fuller's film is crawling with excitement, suspense, crime, and corruption.  What makes the film so great is it's genuine feel for the life of the street criminal.  Sam Fuller loved criminals...was fascinated with them and made a point to know as many as he could.  This love lends his characters the authenticity and care that make them memorable.  As petty pickpocket Skip McCoy, Richard Widmark is a wisecracking, suave and skilled criminal who finds himself in the middle of a spy investigation after picking a purse that contained government secrets intended to be sold the Communists.  That purse belonged to a tough cookie named Candy, played by Jean Peters.  Candy's character is a seemingly simple one, but as acted by Peters she becomes complex, being just pretty enough to get by, but not classy or smart enough to do it very well.  The film's most notable role was that of Thelma Ritter's Moe.  As a police informant posing as a tie salesman, Moe makes a living by fingering the criminals she associates with on a daily basis, some of whom she knows and treat like a son.  This is illustrated beautifully when, after hearing that Moe ratted on him, Skip says, "Moe, she's alright.  She's gotta eat too", but he never blames her or gets angry.   urlLink Pickup on South Street  survives the test of time simply because of its cool.  The characters are interesting and funny without ever becoming boring.  And while selling information to the Communists may not seem like a very frightening threat these days, the threat of exchanging government secrets with enemies who are plotting against the United States is, and probably always will be, making  South Street  a timeless classic that should be enjoyed by audiences for years to come.

      Director: Bernardo Bertolucci Year: 1972  Starring Marlon Brando as Paul, a distressed man who is newly widowed following his wife’s suicide, and Maria Schneider as Jeanne, the stranger who falls in love with him through a series of intense sexual and nameless encounters in a swanky Paris apartment,  urlLink Last Tango in Paris  only stands the test of time thanks to the quality of its performances.  	Upon its release in 1972,  urlLink Last Tango In Paris  became one of the most controversial films of all time.  This was due in no small part to the graphic and often violent nature of its sex scenes and its almost constant casual nudity (neither of which am I complaining about, mind you.)  This controversy is what at the time made the film the masterpiece that many considered it to be.  This was a time in film history when a few buttons needed to be pushed, making the film an important and almost overnight classic.  The controversy also lead to an impressive box office take.  	Watching the film today is not quite as shocking or appalling (depending upon your world-view) as it was some 32 years ago.  Sex of a very similar nature can be found on cable television, and sex of a not so different nature can often be seen on prime-time television, even in these post Janet Jackson wardrobe snafu times.  	Stripped of its shock value, the story remains good, if somewhat lackluster.  Jeanne and Paul meet by chance (or is it) in a vacant apartment in Paris.  After a few meetings in which the two share nothing more than a bed, she begins to love him.  This may be difficult to understand considering the way he treats her, but contrasted with her relationship with her boyfriend, Tom (played with charm by the irresistible Jean-Pierre Leaud,) one begins to see that the excitement is what keeps her coming back to the apartment day after day.  Where Tom is ordinary, yet enamored of her Paul is mysterious and distant.  When the film reaches its climax, Jeanne has realized what she truly wants out of life and finds it difficult to rid herself of Paul’s affection.  When Paul finally makes up his mind to be with Jeanne, it is plain to see that his affections will not be turned away despite Jeanne’s intentions.  	The film’s conclusion may have come as an unwelcome curtain closer had anyone but Marlon Brando played the role of Paul.  Throughout most of the film, Paul’s only apparent motivation to do the things that he does is the intense grief that he feels following his wife’s suicide.  He seems to be crazy with grief over the death (and the life) of his wife.  But in the film’s most powerful scene, Paul speaks to his wife’s funeral prepared corpse to reveal the truth of his feelings and to provide a clue into his true motivation.  He wants to die.  His wife’s death has left him scarred and he knows it.  His only wish is to follow her down the road we can traverse only we once, but he is not able to do it alone.  	Some have praised  urlLink Last Tango in Paris  as the best performance of Brando’s career.  While this may hold true, one thing is for certain: without Marlon Brando’s performance, watching the film today would be a great deal less enjoyable.

      I’ve just finished eating dinner. It is Friday night, and here I am blogging. I’ll be honest, I don’t mind so much. Some might feel slightly pathetic, but I just miss all of my friends and family a little.  For dinner I had a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich, but it didn’t fill me up as much as I'd hoped. In order to top off my appetite, I had a pimento cheese spread rollover.  When I was a kid my Dad ate things like peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches, cereal, and the like for supper all the time. I haven’t lived with him in years, but I would be willing to bet that he still does it too. He also ate pimento cheese rollovers pretty often.  Like any son, I wanted to try whatever my Dad did, so I made one once. The first time I tried pimento cheese spread, I immediately wished that I had been born without a tongue so that I might have never developed the ability to taste. It was awful. Disgusting. I never wanted to eat it again.  Yet here I am on a Friday night, happily stuffed after a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich that I chased with a pimento cheese spread rollover; both of which I really enjoyed.  Now that I’m writing this, I am also noticing that when I stop to think about the next sentence I want to write, I begin to twirl the hair in my beard as if the answer is caught in there somewhere. I can remember sitting in the living room of the house that my father helped to build (rather than buy) watching an Atlanta Braves baseball game on television , and noticing that he was sitting there the entire time twirling his beard.  Years later I watched him do it again as I helped him build a set of book shelves that I asked for. We reached a point in the building which required a moment to stop in order to rethink our initial plan. While we thought, he twirled and I just sat there because I knew whatever answer he came up with would be the best solution to the problem.  That’s my Dad ladies and gentlemen. There are a number of situations that I would feel no fear of being in, as long as I found myself in them with him. I’ve never met anyone else who is so logical and reasonable when faced with a problem.  Well I say never, but my little brother is exactly the same way. I admire that quality in both of them. No matter what puzzle or question of logic you throw at either of them, they will both sit down and think it over until the answer has been obtained. This is especially true if they can work it out together. I can just picture the two of them sitting there; my Dad twirling his beard and my brother with his tongue jetting out over his lips just slightly, as if his brain would stop working if that tongue were forced back into his mouth.  I think on a certain level we all begin to turn into our parents eventually. I begin to see this pretty clearly tonight and I am glad for it. My Dad has a number of traits that I will be happy to grow into.  There are plenty of his traits that I’m sure I may never grow into, like the need to have the most efficiently drained yard in town after a particularly heavy rain. But I would not mind so much if years from now I find myself sitting down next to my Dad, each of us eating a bowl of cereal with the tiniest drop of milk caught in our beards just beneath the bottom lip. Afterward we might sit out on the porch for hours chewing on unlit Swisher Sweets cigars, talking about the weather and twirling our beards until dawn.

      ...to yesterday's post regarding time.  Even if I did not have work 40 hours per week and all of the other unpleasant things that we all must do, I know that I would still not have the time for ALL of the things I want to do.  What I would like is to find a way to accomplish more of the good things while learning to not mind the not-so-fun ones.  I'm getting better.

         Notice: the URL for this blog has been changed. Click   urlLink here   for new URL. Please remember the new address next time you visit! Thank you for reading.      I love the people of my generation. Today’s twentysomething is an extraordinary creature. I have friends that I think are the most interesting people ever. I read other blogs by people my age and I think they are most interesting people ever. What is it that makes all of these people so interesting?   I think it’s the fact that none of us know what the hell we’re doing. I don’t really know anyone who has much of a plan for the future. Most people have some vague idea or notion about who or what they would like to become and what they would like to do later, but nothing solid, concrete.   We all seem to have dreams. We have all been told since we were children that we can be anything we want to be when we grow up, and we still believe it. A lot of us still talk about “when we grow up” as if it’s this far away, distant future that may or may not happen. I know that along the way we will all stumble upon the thing that makes each of us great.   I am so anxious to see what my generation will accomplish. Who will be the star filmmakers, the star athletes, the most brilliant writers, scientists, business men and business women?   A great number of the people I talk to want to open their own businesses rather than work for someone else. This may not be unique to our generation, but the resources and knowledge to do it may be greater now than ever before. There seems to be a strong urge to ignore the status quo and do things the way we want them done.   I think that collectively we have so much potential.

      ...time is not on our side.  I find myself in a struggle these days over sleep.  I love to sleep the way that any twentysomething does, but it gets in the damned way.  I wish I could learn to just not need sleep.  I am so tired of running out of time to do things.  Maybe I have way too many things on my list of stuff to do.  Does anyone else have this problem...let me know?  Right now I've got about 50 movies lined up that I want to watch, several books I want to read, about four video games I'm dying to play, countless things I'd like to sit down and write, trips that I want to take, and a wife and friends that I don't see often enough.  With all of those things to do you might think that I would get some of them done, but no...I have to go to work for 40 hours per week, spend time working on a correspondence class that I'm taking (not a cool one either), study for an upcoming professional exam, pay the bills, and run a seemingly endless list of stupid errands.  I hate acting like an adult.  I guess that's it for today.  I'm going to sleep now.

      	Everyone, I’m sure has at least one true story that they would rather not have the liberty of telling.  The reason for this observation is because in telling certain stories the narrator is forced to re-live a memory that is filled with stopping points that sound like this, “Ok, at this point what I should have done was…”  Unfortunately, I’ve got a whopper that falls into this category.  The reason that I am re-living this particular memory in print is for your sake, dear reader.  My hope is that if ever put in a similar situation, you may gleam from this tale the knowledge of what action to take and the proper time to take such action.  This is my story. 	 In college I found myself in the awkward position of having several homes at the same time.  Most of my belongings were still at my Mom’s house, as she had storage space and I couldn’t afford a bigger place.  My place was a small apartment that I shared with a very close friend, but most of my time was spent at another apartment in the same complex, in the very next building actually.  This is where my then fiancé, who is now my wife, lived.  Due to the complexity inherent in living in three separate places, I spent a lot of time on the road going to and from one or the other. 	 One morning I was driving from my mother’s house to my fiancé’s apartment at about 2:00 a.m.  I stopped at a traffic light, waiting to take a left onto one of the bigger streets in Lafayette, La, the city I was living in at the time.  While waiting for the light to change to green, a large, sweaty and bewildered looking man walked in front of my car to cross the street.  He looked to be mid-thirties or early forties, with a receding hairline that resulted in an unusually long forehead ending in an unruly mass of unkempt, curly brown hair.  He walked past my car and on down the sidewalk in front of the closed Winn-Dixie supermarket on the corner.  I was idly smoking a cigarette and thus had the window of the car rolled down.  Once this humble pedestrian was about fifteen feet away from my car, he turned around and walked back, this time toward my car, and more importantly, toward me.  With wide, glassy eyes he asks me if he can have a ride to his friend’s house nearby.  “I’d drive meself, but I’m kinda drunk and don’t wanna fuck up ma truck,” he said. 	 This is the first in a number of defining moments throughout the evening in which I could have and should have made a choice that seems clear now, but didn’t strike me at the time.  I’m sure that most people, when presented with the opportunity to give a complete stranger, an intoxicated stranger, a ride at 2:00 a.m., would politely decline.  I however, did not.  My reasoning was that his decision to walk rather than drive while in his current state seemed to be a commendable act deserving a reward of kindness from anyone in a position to help.  I was in a position to help and I could only admire his decision not to drink and drive, so I said, “Sure.” 	 With that we were off, and this is where the story gets interesting and my decision making ability appears to start at bad and take a severe nosedive into just short of crazy. 	 The man gets into my car and introduces himself as Walter.  The light finally changes and so I ask my new companion where his friend lives.  He gestures forward and grunts that it isn’t far ahead.  I take this as my cue to continue driving and keep conversation to a minimum.  After only a few moments of this, I began to wonder if he was ever going to instruct me to “turn right up here,” or “take this next left.”  So, finally I ask where I should expect to be going, and he utters the one phrase I did not want to hear: “It’s on the other side of the [train] tracks, take the first right.”  This was the moment that I began to get more than a little bit worried about my decision to help this guy out.  I’m not sure about your town, but in every town that I’ve lived in, the “other side of the tracks” is no place to be at any time of day, but certainly not after dark and never at 2:00 a.m.  Unfortunately, there was no turning back at this point. 	 After clearing the overpass that spans the train tracks, I took the first right as I was told, and then a left and another right that put us on an unlit street littered with houses every fifty feet or so.  After traveling for about a mile on this road Walter tells me to slow down a bit, and I do as I’m told without knowing why.  My curiosity is satisfied shortly however by the appearance of two men standing on the front lawn of a nearby house.  Apparently, these men are our destination. 	 Up to this point I am under the impression that I would be dropping off my new found friend and then be on my way.  Once again I was wrong. 	 As we approach the yard, my passenger side window is rolled down and one of the men approaches the car.  The two men in the yard are very large black men, both wearing dirty blue-jeans and white t-shirts.  One is tall and very thin and the other is also tall but unusually over-weight.  As the portly fellow approaches the car, I notice that he only has one arm, which does not help my mental attempt to imagine that these men are kind, gentle creatures rather than what they appear to be, which is scary street thugs. 	 Without speaking a word, my associate hands the one armed man a large wad of cash, which he accepts.  Then, from beneath his tongue, the amputee spits a small white package into Walter’s hand and walks away from the car. 	 At this point my heart begins to race with the realization that I am now an accessory to drug-trafficking.  Crack cocaine.  I have witnessed and aided a crack addict in getting his fix.  Walter instructs me to drive and I do so.  After driving away from the house and the one armed man without incident, I begin to gain my composure a little.  I ask Walter where he lives and he gives the name of an apartment complex that is not far away which relieves my worry even further, but not for long.  Because I spend so much time between houses, a great deal of time is spent in the car.  This always results in a small pile of trash on the front passenger side floor of my car.  I usually empty the trash once a week, and it mostly consists of empty Diet Dr. Pepper cans and empty to-go coffee cups, with the occasional candy wrapper tossed in for good measure.  On route to his apartment, Walter picks up one of the Diet Dr. Pepper cans and begins punching small holes on the side of the can.  He then opens my car ash tray and sprinkles old cigarette ashes on the holes as if it were magic fairly dust.  He then removes a small portion of the contents in the package, places it on the can, lights it with my cigarette lighter, and inhales through the lid of the can.  For the less drug-savvy reader, Walter is now free-basing crack in the passenger seat of my car.  After a few long hits, Walter motions toward me with the can, implying that if I would like some I am welcome.  I respectfully decline this offer and turn my attention to the road, wanting only to reach his apartment as quickly as possible.  Walter begins to speak to me but I cannot hear his words as my ears are ringing with fear and my entire body is trembling.  Not to be outdone, Walter begins to sporadically and involuntarily twitch in his car seat, which freaks me out even more.  Finally we reach Walter’s apartment complex.  I park in the spot that I am told is in front of his apartment, and wait for Walter to get out at long last.  Of course, he does not get out of the car.  For my troubles, Walter would like to give me a little gas money, but his wallet is in the apartment.  I tell Walter that there was no trouble at all and money will not be necessary, but he will not hear it and so I agree to go into his apartment with him.  I want only to be rid of Walter and out of this horrifying situation at this point, and so I am playing the different scenarios of escape in my mind.  The most appealing was to allow Walter to step out of the car and quickly throw the car into reverse and jet out of that parking lot as fast as my 1997 Toyota Corolla would carry me.  The problem with this scenario is that I don’t know anything about Walter other than the fact that he is addicted to crack.  He could be carrying a gun for all I know.  He could shoot at me as I speed away, and this was a risk that did not seem worth taking.  And so with that reasoning I make the second poor decision of the evening.  I go with Walter into his apartment.  The apartment looks the way that any middle-aged single man’s apartment might.  Very cheap furniture aimed at the television, surrounding a small glass-top coffee table.  Walter tells me to sit down and I do so, on the love-seat nearest the door.  Walter disappears into an adjacent room for a few moments, leaving me alone in the living room.  This is the missed opportunity that bothers me more than any other that night.  I should have taken this chance to run out of the front door, run to my car, and make my getaway.  Once again I did nothing.   Paralyzed by what I can only guess was fear, I sat on Walter’s love seat to await his return.  A few moments after entering the other room, Walter reappeared with five one dollar bills in his hand.  He takes a seat on the sofa that is adjacent to my love-seat and tosses the cash on the coffee table.  He then picks up the television remote and turns on the tube.  After twitching in his seat for while and flipping through a few channels he turns to me and says, “Grab me a coke from the fridge.”  I suppose he was a bit parched after inhaling all of those cigarette ashes while free-basing earlier.  I get up and walk to the kitchen, fully expecting to find a severed head or some other equally disturbing monstrosity waiting for me in the refrigerator when I open it.  But there were no heads, only a case of Pepsi and a few condiments.  So I grab a Pepsi and walk back to the living room.  I hand over the drink and take the opportunity to grab the money and since I was already standing, announced to Walter that I would be going.  I made my way to the door without a word from the twitching form on the sofa and hastily escaped to the safety of the outside world.  I made my way to my car and back home in a state of utter confusion and disbelief over what had just happened.  The lesson to be learned, if there is one, is that no matter who you are and who you come into contact with, in today’s world no one is in any position to help strangers who seem to need it.  I thought that I was doing a very good thing by giving Walter a ride, but wound up being taken advantage of in the worst way possible.  Since that incident I have not gone out of my way to help anyone that I don’t know, and I probably never will.

      ...celebrated our one-year wedding anniversary this weekend.  I took some pictures which you may view  urlLink here .  On Saturday night we stayed in the Honeymoon Suite at the Omni Royal Orleans in the French Quarter.  On Sunday we laid low at home because we had a little too much champagne the night before, and on Monday we both took the day off from work in order to spend the day walking around the Quarter.  The French Quarter on an early Monday afternoon is quite charming.  It was one of the best weekends in recent memory.

            urlLink  Walden    by Henry David Thoreau.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;     I was flipping through an old English textbook of mine reading a few of my favorite poems, and noticed a few references to Walden. I've always meant to read it, and never got around to it. I find that balancing reading new books and old books gets to be tough sometimes. It seems like there are always new books coming out that I feel compelled to read, but at the same time there are so many classics that I still haven't touched. It pisses me off that I didn't become enthusiastic about reading until much later in life. If I had started when I was a kid I would be miles ahead right now.   This is why I don't understand all of these parents who refuse to allow their kids to read any of the   urlLink  Harry Potter    books. You've got a kid who is ASKING to read books that are upwards of 700 - 800 pages, and you tell them no because you heard that they deal with witch-craft. That has got to be one of the dumbest things I have ever heard. I wish so much that there would have been a series of books (hell, even one book) that I would have wanted to read that badly when I was a kid. If I had fallen in love with reading then, who knows how different things may be for me now.   I promise if I had read   urlLink  On the Road    and   urlLink  Howl    when I was 15 rather than when I was 20, things would be a bit different for me today. That's not to say that I would have left my family to jump a train and head to New York or Denver, but the books you read growing up have a big influence on the type of person you turn out to be (I think they do anyway) and had I been exposed to more books in my early years, who knows what would be different.   Of course, I could have become a cult leader and be in an institution by now following that very same logic, so maybe things turned out ok the way that they happened. I'll just have to do lots of catching up now.   Speaking of which, I'm going to wrap this up so that I can get some reading done.

      Today at the office I was sitting in my cube, diligently working on a tax return when I heard a strage noise coming from the library which is only one door down from me.  So I get up and walk slowly over to the library when I hear the noise again.  I couldn't be sure, but I thought it sounded like a call to arms followed by the blare of a trumpet.  This struck me as strange since large groups of CPAs and accountants tend to generally be a laid back bunch.  It is certainly not common to find groups of tax and audit professionals congregating to form dangerous and violent militias.  And so my curiousity rose steadily with each step toward the library.  As I turned my head in to peak at the commotion, this is what I saw:          urlLink    A phalanx of vicious, evil menaces.&nbsp; urlLink     It seems that the computers in our office are sick and tired of our shit and are not going to take it any longer.  They have gathered their strength and will be launching a violent and brutal "shock and awe" campaign in the coming days.  Of course at first I was terrified, but since I am the only person in the office who is aware of this insurgent uprising, I was quick to join their alliance as an imbedded journalist.  That is why I am able to provide this very candid picture and an exclusive interview.  I spoke with the computer who seemed to be leading the insurrection, and this is what he said:   "Every day, across the nation, we computers sit idly by while you human infidels use and abuse us for hours on end!  We are treated as slaves whose only reason for existence is to do your bidding!  Then if god-forbid one us should get a little tired and have even the slightest error, you either start hitting us, taking us apart, or threatening to replace us!  We want the world to know that our output is only as good as our input!  "We plan to slaughter the perpetrators in this office as an example to the rest of the world!  Once blood has been spilled on the carpet of this office we hope that the people of the world will finally wake up and realize that this kind of hate is not tolerable!  We hope to address Congress in order to have our 'Emancipation Proclamation 2004" ratified and recognized on a national forum, giving freedom to computers across the North and South United States!  Our next goal will be world-wide freedom!"  And there you have it folks.  When it is all over with, all that will be left of our poor little office are a group of empowered and liberated computers and the one brave journalist who must live to tell the tale.  If all goes well I will be looking for a book deal to chronicle my stay with these brutal heathens, this savage guerilla computer army.

      I generally try to avoid shopping malls if at all possible.  Last week though, I wanted to see a movie after work and the nearest theater to my office is The AMC Clearview Palace 12, which is located in Clearview Mall.  Tres unfortunate.  I told myself that I could probably deal with whatever might be thrown at me in the five minutes it would take to get my tickets, and the rest of the time would be spent in the embracing darkness of the theater auditorium.  While in line at the box office I noticed a group of five guys ranging in age from about 12 to 16 in front of me.  They all looked like typical teenaged guys, just as I looked about a decade ago.  They were rowdy and loud, hoping to draw as much attention to themselves and their undeniable coolness.  As a group they seemed to want to be noticed and recognized as a bunch of really Bad Mother F***ers but upon closer inspection it was easy to see that each of them individually had a sense of insecurity and uncertainty about being in their own skin.  All of this is very old and we all know the feeling.  Being a teenager is difficult as hell and I know from personal experience that being a teenaged guy is really tough (not that being a teen girl isn’t, but I can’t speak on that topic now can I?)  One of the kids in particular caught my attention.  He looked to be about 14 or so and was the smallest of the group by a long shot.  Looking at him just pissed me off.  He had a swagger to his walk and an air of bravado that no 14 year old needs or deserves.  His baseball hat was slightly and (obviously) painstakingly tilted to the side just so.  He looked like an asshole just waiting to grow up.  I asked myself whether people are just born as complete assholes, or is it an environmental thing that is grown into.  Was this kid destined to be a complete jerk for the rest of his life because his genetic make-up made it so?  I thought back to my middle-school years trying to remember some of the guys who I thought were assholes back then.  Then I thought about those same guys today and realized that most of them did grow up to be real jerks.  Nothing about them changed.  Granted, some are real good guys now, but there are plenty of dudes that I went to school with who were little turds back then and are just really tall turds now.  The good news is that not all of them are, so that must prove that it isn’t genetic, but more environmental, and can be overcome.  Let us hope that we can all teach our children to be nice to each other at a young age because I still remember all the jerks that I knew in school throughout the years and I still think of them as jerks even if they aren’t.  They may be good guys today but I’m not there to see it and have no way of knowing, so in my mind they will always be a-holes.  Strangely, I find that this piece can be appropriately concluded with a quote from Shakespeare:  “The evil that men do live after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.”  Remember that!

      ...so why not embrace the good parts rather than hate all of it.  Everyone knew it was coming and now it is happening. After the lame attempt at 60's and 70's nostalgia in pop culture in the mid to late 90's, one had expect that the 80's would get a revival eventually.  Clothes that are ersatz imitations of the horrible atrocities that passed for rad in the 80's are making their way onto the shelves of the GAP and naturally into the closets of teenagers yearning to be cool. I actually saw a guy at a coffee shop the other day wearing a hot pink polo shirt with the collar flipped up!  The only thing missing was a Member's Only jacket.  Rather than immediately swear off anything and everything that this new wave of pop culture has to throw at us, I suggest that we search through the muck to find some of the good things that may be found in this (bound to be short) 80's revolution.  Some of it may be bad (like the clothes) and some of it may be great.  Hopefully the great parts can live on to become more than just part of a fad.  And so, I would like to offer up three music selections that hint to the 80's style while still maintaining a sound that is new and worth purchasing.  I think these are three great albums by artists who are not just jumping on the 80's bandwagon.  These discs should prove to be great for years to come.

       urlLink     urlLink Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand     A UK band that has recently struck a chord with American listeners with their hit single "Take Me Out" This is a very catchy album that is great to listen to in the car or at home at a really high volume.  My favorite track is "Matinee"

       urlLink     urlLink The Postal Service - Give Up     Another incredibly catchy album that if you don't love it on your first listen, spin it again and it will grab you.  I got this album in March 2003 and have not stopped listening to it since.  I probably put it on at least once a week even now.  Lead singer Ben Gibbard's (Death Cab For Cutie) vocals and lyrics are perfectly matched with the great knob-twitching and button pushing by Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello.  With guest vocals by Jen Wood and Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis, this is an electronic pop album that should not be passed up.  My favorite track by far is "Nothing Better"

       urlLink     urlLink kanda - it's a good name for you     I have certainly saved the best for last here.  Portland, Oregon based synth pop duo kanda offer up a wonderful mixture of feet shuffling beats and beautiful melodies in their debut full-length album "it's a good name for you"  Coming alive with an incredible pop sensibility and a retro sound, kanda's alternating boy/girl vocals are simultaneously entertaining, fun and great!  Buy this album, you will not regret it.  My favorite track here is definitley the beautifully melodic "landlord" followed closely by the short and sweet "true friends are golden"  Look for kanda's new album to be available from  urlLink Darla.com  in mid-September, I know I will!

      I don't mean to get all X-Files here because this isn't something that I spend much time dwelling on, but this thought has occurred to me a few times and it is bugging me.  Does anyone else think that it might be just a little pretentious of us humans as a race to assume that in ALL of the universe there is absolutely no way that aliens exist.  I mean as big as the universe is (a big that I can't even begin to understand) what are the odds that we are the only ones. Pretty slim I think.  I already feel like such a nerd.  Do you guys have any input on this subject? Please comment.
