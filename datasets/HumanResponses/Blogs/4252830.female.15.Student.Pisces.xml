      Camp was so much fun!!! i missed yu thou!! the first day was kinda slow because mine and megans friends: shelby, josh and nicolas (he is 10 but he is so cute) but it was funny because when josh came megan and me were on the pontoon boat and she was trying to touch the water with her feet and i pushed her and she fell into the water with all her clothes on hehehe!!! the sencond day all of our friends were there but around 6:00 right after we ate dinner they came and knock on the door! it was werid talking to old friends. We went to hang out in the room attached to the sauna with was rille comfy. Josh kept on sitting on me and megan for some reason. Megan would keep on hurting him but i wouldnt hurt him so of course he kept on sitting on me. The next day we woke up early (around 9) and ran outside on the dock and screamed across the bay type thing for all of our friends to come down and there heard us!! which is so cool.they came over and josh kept on tackling us! but after we all listened to black eye peas and went crazy and read magazine, caught up that kinda stuff. we also went for a paddle boat ride and got greta pictures.We had a camp fir that night so all our friends went into the sauna house with the parents out by the fire. The next day we all went on the ontoon boat and went to a nearby beach with all of our families it was fun we went smimming. When we got back since i didnt go on the thing that yu sit on that oulled yu behind a motor boat the day before everyone was making me go  so i went on with megan and was scares shitless...instead of screaming ahhhhhh i was scareming megan i hate you im gunna kill you the whole time hahaha. we fell off and since they told me we wouldnt because i am scared of sharks (yes in the lake) i was scream at megan lol in a funny way i wasnt actuallu mad but i was so scared and we got back on the tube and they pulled us back when we were about 20 meters away from the dock they had to stop because of the ropes length we had to be pulled in with the rope but ofcourse megan tipps us and i started scream and trying to drowned her not litterally though lol  when we swam back we ran into the sauna the kids stay relle late untill around 12 inm our sauna and josh was scaring us telling us all these storys of hobs walking aroiund outside so we locked both doors! megan had to go pee so she had to walk up to the batheroom she said im not afraid of the man cominh over her and she closed the door when she was on the inside lol cause she was kinda scared cause josh kept on turning of the lights and jumping on me n megan. and megan turned around and there was this actualkly man in the window looking in we were all scareming and megan threw the flashlight back and flew back herself about 6 feet. it ending up being shelbys dad to come and get them to take them back threw the woods lol. The next day was basically our last full day so we hung our did about everything possible. Having a camp fire and stuff like that. then the next day we were leaving so we hung out and played that cranium game remember in grade 8 it was a relle cool borad game that yu had to mould clay shaped and act and do data questions. and we also played blockus and cards. Then we had to leave and me and megan stood on the end of the dock and said good bye to everything yessssss everything lik: josh, shelby, nickolas, there parent, frogs, lake, grass, rocks, boats, camp and more.... it was so sad to leave andwe hugged and said our goodbyes and me megan and her pap went into one car and all the others went into another and we were car sick the whole way but we had a relle fun time in that car lol. but i have to go get readt for holland goodbye i will try to write yu jillian as much as possiblexoxoxoxoxoxoxox Michelle

       Today we ordered a pizza and pepsi at Michelle's summer house in Canada. Rachel our neighbour came aswell and we watched the ending of X-men 2. It was awesome. Then since we felt fat we went for a half an hour bike ride to burn of FAT (in jillians n rachels words). On our bike ride we went to Jillians step moms house and we played with her cats and took our older sisters candy from her room when she was out with her friend. After we biked back to Michelles summer house and went on Msn. Rachel left but micheel and jillian are going to play basketball on playstation! But Michelle is going to try to write Jillian when she goes to holland, and when she is home again in Paris.   g2g bubyies xoxox

       Today we went to nicholas Otters (lol) house where Jillians boyfriend was being a jerk, and she was not happy about it. Michelle was patting the puppies(Tia Maria and Maxwell) and Tia scratched Jillian across her boobs by accident and it really hurt. Then we went to Michelle's house and watched Anger Manegment. It was a horrible movie!!!!! We went and got Rachel to go and see into her new houses backyard. Now we are sitting at Michelle's house and listening to music. Michelle is going to Holland and to camp so we will not see each other for like the rest of the summer (jillian is very amd). Tonight we went for a bike ride, ate cookies, and played a basketball video game. Jillian is going home very soon and is going to call Michelle in the morning after she finishes babysitting at 1:00.   bye
