      i am at winthrop now, waiting rather anxiously for swim practice to begin. i am in some sort of little lounge area in the gym. there's a ping pong table and some chairs and a little kitchen thing. how quaint. im pretty surprised because its five til five and nobody's here but me. how sad. im all by my lonesome. i wish somebody would give me a practice schedule. that would be great.  i hope the bathroom is open. i dont feel like hiding behind any bushes.  ...finishing up this entry.....i am at home now. Practice does indeed start at five. however, everyone else arrived at 5:15. William barnes showed up early and we attempted ping pong together. the table was a bit warped and almost spoiled our fun. very hard to keep the ball going. I also perused the bookshelves and found some weird books. one about gymnastics and included pictures of freaky contortionists. another, was called sports medicine and showed some cool diagrams of the muscular system. and then--the whopper-- HUMAN SEXUALITY. very freaky book. college level sex ed.??? Illustrated various positions which i will not go into detail about, and some loser had dog eared all the pictures with naked women in them. so of course, with the pages being dog eared the first page i open to is a picture of a woman giving birth with her legs all spread open, a screaming squnched up face, and a big baby head trying to escape from her crotch. two things: 1) i wonder how much they had to pay that woman to put her picture in there and 2) OUCH! my desire to never reproduce has been reaffirmed. babies arent that cute when they cry all the time and keep you up all night. they grow up to be bigger, whinier, more brand concious versions of themselves;and who wants to deal with a whiney, expensive teenager who  will just end up crashing the car you paid for them to drive and yelling at you?  Everyone, realize that your mother loves you very much. now go give her a hug,and promise you wont ever put her in a nursing home.

      How very irksome. Jolie has my car keys. Thankfully I do have an extra one in my room I keep just for these very special stupid moments. I suppose that I will be going back in to work tomorrow, since I don't really have much else to do. No social outings or anything, and I spent all weekend purchasing clothing so that I don't go around looking like Raggedy Ann or Salvation Army Barbie anymore. NO MAS! no more of that. So now that I have no more money to fritter away, I don't really know what to do. Making some seems like a good idea.    Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS also seems like a good idea. We will be discussing that upon our return to class in AUGUST!!! Stupid lowlife school district imbeciles. Wonderful book though. My favorite quotation so far is "where have you been you young monkey?" Great literature. Must also start art AP projects. need those to get in the class. yeah. should really do that.   oh well, i am going to read now. my eye is twitching.

      I forgot to post yesterday! Shame,shame on me! I know everyone is quivering with anticipation, waiting for the words to pour like honey from my luscious lips...or fingers rather, since I am typing. So for those so excited to hear from me they could pee their pants--which I doubt is anyone,really--I will tell you what I did today.  10:30--rose from the dead and consumed shredded wheat with soymilk 10:45--drove self to work. Still damaged from last year's wreck. So hard to turn! So afraid! Riding in the tin death box.ahhhg! 11:00--arrived and began to lazily sift through my box of checks and deposits. Pointed and clicked for several hours. Entered clear dates. Finally printed out reports at around 12. Ate other peoples snacks I found in the fridge....Continued working until 3. Very productive day.hurrah for me. 3:oo--arrived at father's office. Began to clean. Dropped paperweights all over the place.  5:oo--came home and sprayed pesticide all over mother's plants. Forgot to wash the pesticide off my hands and ate watermelon and left over Thai food from last night. Lets hope I don't die slowly. Quickly could be tolerable. 6ish--went to neighbors(im still in pajamas, mind you.) and gave them their mail, which I have been picking up while they've been on vacate. Ksenia (aka Oxana, the Russian with road rage) and I decided that we would head out to Target and Tj Maxx. I found some cute pointy shoes for 13 bucks--a friend of mine calls them roach stompers because you can still squash the things when they scamper into corners--and a pretty little feminine skirt with pink and green floral print and a ribbon at the top. I also found a non hideous strapless nude bra for 6 bucks. This purchase is my pride and joy, "why?" you ask...its one of those deceptive watery gel bra things.The bra lies! The bra tells lies!! Guys think the girl really has boobs...feel real under the shirt! shirt and bra go away...boobs disappear! abracadabra! that is what I shall call it. My abracadab-Bra. YAy!

      As I was contemplating having a nice juicy piece of watermelon, that little story popped into my head. You know, the one you tell to scare cute innocent little children. "If you swallow a seed, you'll grow a watermelon inside you!" or,if by chance you're talking to a girl,"Dont swallow the black ones, or your first baby will be a watermelon!" WHAT IF the latter actually happened to some poor woman? I know, I know, it's not possible. But, WHAT IF...   I would imagine that giving birth to a watermelon would be exceptionally painful given its size--MUCH larger than your average baby. Perhaps the watermelon baby would be somewhat like a living human, but composed of plant matter--little vines for its arms and legs, a large melon for the torso and another slightly smaller one which  would function as the head. I suppose that the babies, being made of perishable fruit, would begin to go bad after a few months. As they would begin to rot their normal sweet dispositions would change to crankiness and displays of rebellion, and I guess they would also smell very unpleasant. (Normal human babies go bad at two years.) NOW, since these babies are fruits,and live such short little lives--with violent ends...would it really be so bad to eat them? I think this would be all the rage among Ethiopians and other starving peoples. Instant food! No land ownership required to farm.

      Recently, I have been bombarded with IM's from seventh graders in Michigan. At first I was a bit confused as to why this was happening, but I have deduced that the annoying little boogers discovered my screen name on my cousin's subprofile. They apparently think I am their friend Jill. At first I was very polite in informing the kiddies of the mistaken identity situation, but now it has happened so much that I've become quite irritable.  Tonight, Bad Boi JaWad made contact with me on aim and queried "is dis Jill?" I responded: "no" Then Bad Grammar Jawad: dan who u b? I told the "bad boi" my name. And I will post the rest of our conversation. jawad is a pretty good sport. I actually ended up liking him a lot. blah blah blah...Anyway, here it is:  BadbOiJaWad10: dan who u b? me: are you from this country? BadbOiJaWad10: ya BadbOiJaWad10: y me: then could you try and speak English BadbOiJaWad10: then who r u? BadbOiJaWad10: *are you me: (sorry, I wont publish my name.) BadbOiJaWad10: o0oo00o me: you weirdo BadbOiJaWad10: lol BadbOiJaWad10: (laugh out loud) me: you know, USA today did a study and found that people who use abbreviations too much on IM gradually lower their IQs....that or they just become terrible writers me: so if I were you, I would watch that BadbOiJaWad10: ok BadbOiJaWad10: ill do htat me: look its happening already! BadbOiJaWad10: but I am a 4.00 student BadbOiJaWad10: seriously me: and im 5.3 with my IB credit points me: so boo-----yah BadbOiJaWad10: wat grade r u in BadbOiJaWad10: *are you me: rising senior BadbOiJaWad10: o BadbOiJaWad10: im in 7th grade me: *what BadbOiJaWad10: I am in 7th grade me: no BadbOiJaWad10: sorry me: oh I just wanted you to know that you spelled 'what' wrong BadbOiJaWad10: o BadbOiJaWad10: ok me: I think that is an important word in any vocabulary BadbOiJaWad10: sorry me: you have been aquitted of all incorrect grammatical usage me: no worries BadbOiJaWad10: ok me: I forgive you!! BadbOiJaWad10: thanks me: so BadbOiJaWad10: so............... me: are you a "bad boi?" me: what bad stuff did you do? BadbOiJaWad10: dats juss my s n me: come on now BadbOiJaWad10: *thats just my screen name me: thank you me: so, then you would say you are more a good boy?

      I have become what I most despise. A hippie.  here are the stereotypical symptoms(I have placed an asterisk beside the traits I exhibit. the more stars, the more hippie!): ***vegetarianism **liberalism and antiwar ideas **antiamerican sentiments *feminism ***long straight hair or weird hair in general *all organic (this can include anything from food to natural looks, i.e. no make up) PETA *the constant wearing of sandals and/or birkenstocks **loose clothing,grunge, and vintage drugs ****disinterest in material possessions *****listen to hippie music---seventies bands, punk rock in which the musicians scream about how much they hate politics, bjork....you get the idea expresses interest in strange and artzy recreational activities-yoga*****,art******,poetry,philosophy,*reading the communist manifesto(I AM NOT A COMMUNIST),***being extremely interested in politics, AND *PARTICIPATING IN PROTESTS(boycott taco bell! support tomato pickers!). odd vocabulary: uses the words "man" and "dude" frequently ***lack of religion or a recent switch to a nonchristian religion  as you can see, i have evolved into a large hippie turd. I attribute this horrible transformation to the ib program and also the art department. Perhaps maybe some friendly influence as well. Although my newfound hippie freedom is all good and fun, i worry that i may not survive in the real world, given that i am not interested in anything practical. How will i make money to buy my precious insulin and food with a low glylcemic  index? How will i keep my diabetic feet? i wouldnt want to end up a homeless art major, i wouldnt last. after consuming my crown of daisies the diabetes would kick in; i would die of high blood sugar, and then the other hobos would roast the sweet meat of my carcass over a flaming garbage can. i must avoid this horrible fate by finding a happy medium...an equilibrium between artistic turd and conservative bitch...i will begin with the easiest thing, a haircut.

       Greetings, all. I will begin this entry with our latest correspondence with Michael Menkin, the man who operates the website about alien abductions. if anyone happens to be interested in visiting his sites, here are the links:  urlLink http://www.stopabductions.com &nbsp;     urlLink http://www.aliensandchildren.org     both sites feature illustrations of aliens as well as lists of their capabilities. the former includes a bio on Menkin, which from reading i deduced that Crazy seems to be a dominant trait in the Menkin genepool; while the latter focuses more on...well, aliens and children. EEEEEEEEEE--TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&nbsp; PHone HOooooooME.     &nbsp;   Jolie writes:    i will certainly go ahead with the thought screen helmet. the only problem is that i'm not sure i'm safe leaving my house without a helmet, and i don't have the materials to make the helmet. i was wondering if some other material would work long enough for me to go out and buy the velostat, such as foil, or a bike helmet? would sunglasses work the way the goggles do?    thank you for all your help!     &nbsp;   Menkin responds:    You are not safe in your house. The aliens go through walls to take people, even brick walls.If you aren't being taken in your house, then you aren't being abducted.Read Budd Hopkins Witnessed. The alien's favorite scam is to take people out of their cars by taking them through the windshield, yes, through the windshield.You have to order Velostat, you can't just go to a supplier and buy it, unless you are buying large Velostat bas, but the minimum order for bags is 1,000 and bags cost about $1.40 a piece. That's why I tell people to buy rolls or piece by the yard.    See  urlLink http://www.ufoabduction.com     Michael Menkin     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Behold our new correspondence with Mike.  &nbsp;  >hello mike  i don't understand how the hats you show can prevent the aliens from accessing the front of my brain as effectively as one that covers the forehead. do the aliens only read your mind from above? and what about my brain stem? couldn't they make my heart stop if they wanted to? i'm so scared!!!  &nbsp;  This time he seemed a bit peeved and snappish. Note the "as i said" in the opening sentence...  &nbsp;  Hi ,  As I said, I did try two helmets with coveings over the forehead. It seems that just covering the main part of the head is effective. I also make baseball caps with Velostat but abductees feel safer with the full helmets. So yes, the telepathy is coming from above and the helmets are effective.If the aliens can't communicate with you or control you for the most part they leave you alone. However, in one case an alien/hybrid derived from an abductee was sick and they still got to the abductee to take her blood. They came down and stared at her directly when she had the helmet on. That's the only documented case of an abductee being taken with the helmet on. Since then I gave polarized goggles to the abductee which we are trying now.  Email me if you have more questions.  Michael Menkin  &nbsp;  oh silly michael, you know not how many&nbsp;dumb questions&nbsp;we can ask...

      Recently i came across a captivating website entitled "Drawings of Aliens by the Children." The pictures, drawn by a brother-sister duo, depict thin spindely figures with big eyes hovering over poor defenseless little&nbsp;stick figures. According to the author of the site, three types of aliens exist: the Mantis aliens (these are the leaders of the plan for world domination), the Greys (the Mantis' bitches. they do all the dirty work), and the Reptilians. All of which are able to communicate telepathically.&nbsp; Using their powerful telepathy, the frail beings&nbsp; can subdue&nbsp;dextrous humans&nbsp; and force them to comply to their evil will which is to breed icky hybrid offspring&nbsp;who will replace the human race and&nbsp;take over the earth. Luckily, if we all wear&nbsp; protective thought screen helmets this terrible fate can be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  The website also features a&nbsp;lovely step by step procedure to make a thought helmet, as well as some pictures and illustrations and riveting user testimonies. Oddly enough, my friend observed that none of the helmets seem to shield the frontal lobe of the brain, a region important in thought processing. She emailed the guy running the site. Ive posted it below.  To:  urlLink mmenkin@hotmail.com   >Subject: hats  >Date: Fri, 9 Jul 2004 20:18:15 -0700 (PDT)  >>why don't your thought screen hats cover the forehead? wouldn't you want to screen the frontal lobe? that's an important part of thought.  >>  &nbsp;  here is his reply:  &nbsp;  Hello,  I did make two hats like that but they were no more effective than the hats I describe in stopabductions.com. according to the people who tried them. Lining a leather "flyer cap" with 8 sheets of Velostat is effective. It works just as well as one that covers the forehead, plus it takes an hour less to make.I also make baseball caps lined with Velostat. I plan to put instructions for making them on my website before the end of the year. Abductees do feel safer in the leather hats than the baseball caps but the feel bettert wearing the baseball caps during the day.  Thanks for your interest,eamil me back if you have more questions.  &nbsp;  Michael Menkin  &nbsp;  The kook never did say WHY the hats work just as well when the frontal lobe is left naked. I know your hats dont work, you shifty little stinker. next i will ask him why he chose to make the hats from Velostat and how that acts to deflect the aliens sinister brain waves.

      according to my hair dresser, a stout, rotund man who is also on the short side, "it is so fun to watch hair evolve." way back when, in the 60's-80's, hair was "all about the pruducts." "you know the musical Hairspray?" hairspray made the style. it has only been recently that the cut has become more advanced and has become "the defining factor for the style." blah blah. while he was meticulously hacking at my hair, i couldnt help but notice that his was absolutely hideous. very floofy mushroomesque top resembling a bowl cut and very odd triangular sideburns, whose length  and shape should be reconsidered.   the man frightened me on several occasions. the most severe scare he bestowed on me was when he told me i had hair like his daughter's. when i first walked into the spa the girl was at the front and she had this horribly voluminous brown mass on her head, with flat bangs swept over the front top area.  i specifically told the man i did not want any sort of christmas tree fluff.he had me turned away from the mirror at this point and so i had no idea of what sort of monster my hair could have possibly become. i was terrified of fluffy teased fiftiesnesss.  god, i nearly went into cardiac arrest from the anxiety and suspense. all i wanted was to escape hippiedom, not turn into some beaver cleaver frankenstine mom. gag. the hair actually turned out well. relief.

      Today I accomplished my noble goal and got a hair cut. Personally, I think it looks very cute and chic-- very tre cool.  Unfortunately, my anti hippie plan seems to have backfired just a wee bit. For, you see, I have purchased a hair product--a lovely shine spray smelling of orange cream pop things--made of, of cannabis seeds. Yes, that's right. I'm drenching myself in weed juice. nooooooooo.   and yesterday,I had decided to play my favorite joke on my parents. I bought some snap and pop fireworks (the kind that explode when you squeeze them) and carefully taped them to the bottoms of the toilet seats so that when the unsuspecting victim would plop down to relive herself, a nice little explosion would occur--mainly noise and smoke. But having forgotten that I had booby trapped the downstairs bathroom in addition to the master bath, I honkered my arse down. Needless to say, I immediately realized my mistake. Whoops. But I did get my dad. When he lifted the  his toilet seat to whiz a few popped and startled him.  oh. And I saw a very good documentary today called SUPER SIZE ME. Everyone in America must see this film. Save yourselves from McDonald's! Obesity is replacing smoking as the number one preventable cause of death. Being fat causes: diabetes, increased risk of various cancers, gallbladder problems, liver scaring and failure, kidney ailments, a myriad of heart and circulatory problems, as well as gastrointestinal disorders and difficulty sleeping. In the documentary Morgan Spurlock, a very slim healthy man, embarks on a month long McDonald's binge eating 3 square meals of fast food each day. Spurlock gains 25 pounds, lets his cholesterol go sky high, and abuses his poor liver while his vegan chef girlfriend worries over him and informs us that sex between the two isn't so hot anymore because burger boy gets too tired. Maybe that's why viagra is so popular...people are too fat now to have normal sex??  (oh, and if you click on the title of this blog entry, you will be swept away to Dear Mr. Spurlock's web page)

      Went down to Columbia with the little sis to learn the art of sushi from our Japanese grandma (a.k.a. Oba-san).We went through the garage to the kitchen door. It wasn't open so Katharine pressed what she thought was the doorbell. The garage door went down. Oops! Better press it again. Garage door stops. Again? Garage door continues going down...Grumpy Japanese answers the door,"oh no. What choo do? Take off shoes. Come in." now I couldn't hear this due to the fact that she was in the living room and I was in the kitchen, but I think oba said something along the lines of, "oh you take long time to get here. im fucking hungry!" (the casual use of profanity wasn't such a big surprise since last Christmas break, Katharine was proclaimed a "chicken shit" for talking during Oprah.) so then we began our sushi making. katn washed the raw rice,and I scraped  the cooked stuff into a large wooden basin. Oba informed me that I was to fan the rice with my left hand and stir in the flavoring and rice vinegar with my right;I was absolutely not to "squash rice" with my "crumsy hand." then we spread the rice on seaweed paper and put in our vegetables. I rolled the sushi on a bamboo mat with great skill. Beautiful sushi! mmm. Katharine lovingly caressed each one after we plopped it on the plate and told them how pretty they were. After we had finished making the Japanese cuisine, Katharine announced that she had an abhorrence toward seaweed and would rather indulge in a piece of watermelon that she had spied in the fridge along with a 7up.  oba: no,you spoil you dinner Katharine: I will not! Its healthy its fruit! oba:that's problem with you mother generation. Fruit desert. Let kids eat too much junk. katn: what?! Its FRUIT! Its healthy!  after lunch Katharine snored on the sofa while oba and I watched a Japanese soap opera about this kid who was forced to work at the age of seven and ran away and wound up freezing to death in the snow and was rescued by an AWOL soldier and an old man both wearing fur coats and then they taught the little girl how to read anti war poems and then her mother found out from the employment office that poor little Oshin was missing....and thats as far as I got. very cheesey. very hilarious. i brought 3 tapes home. i'm such a loser.

      Stan the kitten was very curious about bugs. He liked them so much he decided that he wanted to pursue a career in entomology. Every night, he would look out the window of the apartment complex to the eight lane highway where he could see the tiny silhouettes of fluttering moths splatting into the windshields of the oncoming traffic.  Stan lived with a recovering alcoholic named AL. Last Tuesday morning Al's Jewish girlfriend Ruth decided to end their relationship on the grounds that Al's leg hair was too dark and thick. Al relapsed. In three days he had gone through 8 six packs, all of his remaining stash. On the fourth day, he stormed out to the nearby food mart to pick up some cigarettes and more booze.  an iridescent blue butterfly flew in through the door Al had left open and landed on the bowl containing stan's breakfast. Stan was captivated by the creature and followed when it fluttered out the window onto the fire escape.  meanwhile, al arrived at the store and made his purchase ignoring the cashiers advice--a keg certainly would've been cheaper. He drank as he loaded his Bud in the jeep.  the butterfly landed on stan's nose.  al started the car and peeled out of the parking lot. He startled two old ladies and hit a street lamp.  Stan sneezed and frightened the insect. It gracefully floated away. Stan pursued. It led him farther away from home than he knew he should be. The butterfly fluttered under a street lamp. Stan heard a rumbling noise. A semi barreled past and the butterfly was gone. Stan ran to the lane closest to his house and sat down to catch his breath.  Al felt a bump. He turned into the garage of the apartment and parked his car. Then he went upstairs and drank some more.
