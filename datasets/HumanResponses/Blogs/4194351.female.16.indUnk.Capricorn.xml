       Okay, so . . . . I guess I last spoke about Monday morning. I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything that night.  Tuesday it was only 9 AM tennis, followed by lunch with the band kids once again. Tuesday was Sal's day. Alex got into Chrissie's car through the sun roof, and put a gross fork he stole from the restaurant in my hair. Then I came home, had some serious confusion over working, and after finding out I didn't have to after clearing my schedule, I went to see Chrissie anyway. About 45 minutes into the deal Alyssa found out her grandparents sent her money and so she really didn't need to be working. So she bailed out and left me and Chrissie to work.  Then the Thigpens came to visit! Matt drove himself and Alex over and they visited for a while. Honestly. Those Thigpens. They just end up behind the counter without my knowing or realizing. I mean Matt I expected it from. He's done it plenty times before. But at one point Chrissie and I were in the back with Matt showing him around and as we come out we see Alex sitting on the back counter flipping through a catalog. . . . ?  Then around closing time I was reconciling my drawers and the other Alex showed up all gross from wrestling. His shirt was really really dirty.  So all in all Chrissie and I had a really snazzy time. I like that kid.  Wednesday morning was 8-12 tennis again. Stacy ran up to meet me after my practice from hell. You see tennis is just one of those sports where it requires so much focus to get your strokes and everything coordinated, that if one thing is off, you screwed. I had one of those days. Needless to say I wasn't feeling so toasty inside. So Stace patiently waited for me to regain my composure and fight back my tears, and we headed up to the curb to wait for the band kids to finish. Chrissie gave us a ride to Quizno's, and I sat on the curb with everyone while they ate their sandwiches. Mmmm . . . toasty. Well save Moira and her awesome cooler. She graciously let me partake in some much needed Welch's fruitsnacks. So before long we headed back and my sister picked me up.  We went to Staples for school supplies!  We got many a school supply and Kel got a new wireless printer and mouse. After that we headed to Michael's for some stuff. I got new drawing pencils, a kneaded eraser, and tortillons. My sister got . . . well . . . fun crafty stuff. We realized for her projects we could stand some paint, and I instantly thought of my dear Jess G. So we stopped by her home, and met her fantastic new kitten! He's awesome. And I mean awesome. All kittens are awesome. So about 45 minutes and no paint later we headed home. Unfortunately the day's wear and tear had gotten to me and I couldn't muster the strength to go to the Roe's pool party with   urlLink  Stace    and Amanda. I chilled at the homestead.  Thursday started out like any other day, tennis at 8 AM. But then, it began to rain around 10:30, and practice got cancelled. So I made a Rite Aid run with Kel, came back to the school to see some friends, and got to experience the scheduling snafoo with Chrissie, Alex, and Chris. We deducted that they don't like to deal with Chrissie. Every time she walks into the office, they all turn and pretend to be busy. Oh man that was a good time. Anyway around 1:00 I call my mom to let her know where I am. I mention the scheduling conflicts, and she says, "Oh, yeah, you got a letter yesterday saying yours is messed up." Thanks Mom. So I join my cohorts in line and end up sitting with Danny and Mrs. Houlihan waiting for Mrs. Karas for about a half hour. She sees me right away, bless her heart, and we deduce that I should talk to my art teacher to see if I can do more of an independent study with Art Major II. So on my way out of the school, I see Mrs. Lister in the lobby! Hoorah! Mrs. Lister is a fabulous art teacher and was my homeroom teacher last year. I learn she will be my teacher next year, and I tell her about my problem. She says that would be fine because I will be "a good addition to the art program." So at fifteen hundred hours, my schedule was set. Word up. I went home, got ready for work, and got to see my dear Stacy and my dear Chrissie. Soon enough plans are made, I escape the hell that was work, and I accompany my sister to Kohl's for picture frames. I got this really awesome photo album that has a picture of a teddy bear on the front and says "Beary Special Moments." Anyone who's got beef, *coughchrisbowyercough*, better get with the times cause your face will be in it!!!  And onward to Danny's. I arrived late to a viewing of THE RING (dn dnn dnnnnnn). This was held for those who had not had the pleasure before, including Chrissie and Jenna. hahaha. Hope they weren't as disturbed as I was a few hours after I first saw it. Anyway I got yelled at for talking too much and laughing at scary parts. But luckily I had Danny who also saw the humor in that woman falling down the well. At the end he selected the scene again and we got to watch her fall in slow motion. Fantastic. I think everyone finally realized the glory of it.  On to fabulous Friday! As I stepped out onto my porch I realized the heat that would be today. We baked out on the courts, but it was a great day of practice. Allison and I got our Alley Rally and Cross Court drills, and at the end we got to play games. I was the only one left on my team in a game of Around The World with one raquet, and unfortunately I didn't posess the reaction time today that is required in that game. But oh well. Then I caught a ride with everyone over to Hoss's! There we watched Bowyer get 3 helpings of ice cream, Moira taught us there's an bottle of extra icing for the raisin bread, and we met a 70 year-old version of Matt Thigpen. We also learned what those light fixtures are  really  for. I really admire everyone in band for their sunglasses. Matt Thigpen looks like he's ready to drive fast, Jimmy looks ready to rock, and Neil looks like an 80 year-old tourist. Those band kids are my favorites.  So that's all for now. I have serious decisions to make regarding this year's courses, and serious summer homework to do.  Until later.

       I feel bad. The last post was wicked long. That just doesn't seem fair to you. Oh well.  Well I posted that post covering Friday and Saturday mid-day Sunday. So I guess we'll cover from then. Not much. Short this time, I promise.  So Sunday evening I made the trek to Stacy's and caught a ride with her and Jess to Bridge. Nothing too monumental, but the band was really awesome to start off. Maybe I was in my concert mentality, but they were really cranking out some good songs and we were jamming. They also had a coffee house. Call me crazy, but goldfish on a silver platter is a pretty rare, yet groovy, occurrence.  On from Bridge we traveled to Red Robin to celebrate Amanda's birthday a day early. . .    Happy 17th Birthday Amanda!!!    She's 17, that old hag. Dave, Stace, and I all shared some mozzarella sticks and fries. And we all got milkshakes. With a glass of water. I made the mistake of going to the bathroom, and that jerk of a kid Danny drank out of my milkshake! Just kidding about the jerk part. He's really a good kid. Stacy and I also had a discussion with Dave about what we laugh about. That's strange, how people have different senses of humor, but when you break it down we all laugh about the same things. Strange. Anyway we made fun of ourselves a bunch and it was a good time. Then I paid $5 extra dollars to cover the tip and for that I got a large spot on Amanda's 17 shirt to sign . . . gee . . . after we paid we went out front. And here begins the dance fest.  Katrina and Freddie are insane kids that blast their stereos with rap. And that's the base of it. So Katrina was blaring music from her car and Stacy was "dancing." We pretty much joked around in the parking lot until everyone was gone, and from there Katrina took Freddie in her car and led PJ, Stace, and I somewhere we could hang around until 11. The Eckerd in Downingtown? Whatever floats your boat. Sounds to me a little more dangerous than Exton. I had to continually remind everyone, "Hey, we're white as they come and in the center of Downingtown . . . " But the rap remained. Needless to say when we pulled up to Stacy's house she was worried her dad would hear the bass and revving of engines and make some kind of "Those damn teenagers!" remark. It was a good wind-down to a fun night. And I got to enjoy some Tupac. And use the bathroom in Eckerd. Nothing beats that!  So I hit the hay, woke up at a lovely 7 AM, and headed out to the tennis courts. Here we learned that Mr. Summers was blatantly asking people to not try out. It was pretty funny actually. Not for those people though. Rather sad. Conditioning, drills, the usual. But at 12, I got to visit with ma band peeps! Steph gave us a ride to Chick-fil-a where we met everyone.  Jimmy says it's all about the ketchup.  And Alex thinks it's weird that girls will talk to each other while they're in their separate stalls in the bathroom.  It was great to see everyone.  I wish I had done some significant trip this summer. I mean between unbelievably tan Alex in Mexico and the culture and culinary enhanced Brett in Italy, Jersey Shore is lookin p-retty lame. But life is what you make it, so heck, Jersey's alright by me. Especially Camden . . .  Until later kids.

        So this post begins on the morn of Friday . . .       Friday morning I woke up with Phil in my house, which really isn't as frightening as it sounds. I showered and hitched a ride with the Puchtas to good ol' West Chester. Needless to say we put a rap on that room. Look out Trading Spaces. Paperwork was signed and now the scrapbook is all we have left. It's a nice feeling. Now it's only that darned Gold Award . . .       Then I sat around, fooling with my guitar and the newly downloaded Napster. Let me just say that I, Jackie Sharpe, can not strum for my life. That and I'm not a huge fan of the pick, and because I hadn't played in a while, there was bloodshed. *shrugs* Oh well. All in the name of music, right?      So I've realized I should just stick to listening to Eddie Vedder and his fellows make their music. Makes for a much more pleasant sound. Or I could always listen to John Mayer!! Or maybe some Maroon 5!! . . . !!!      So after milling about I headed off to work with my new appendage Chrissie! Stacy had promised she'd come visit, and after only like 45 minutes she showed up! Talk about service! So we joked around, and Stacy and I made up a new language. "I mean why wouldn't she didn't even invite us!?"      Okay. So the entire night I had been verbally abusing Stacy. And I tripped her a few times. But heck, it's what we do. I mean she takes her fair share of blows at me. So at one point she went to empty a trashcan in the public trashcan out front of the store. So I ran up, locked the door, and then bolted to the back of the store. Chrissie, who was sitting in plain view on the phone, just kind of shrugged at Stacy and made a face. I came back out and creatively played that I had no idea. Was the door stuck? Could she try to pull harder? What was going on? Chrissie joined in but then eventually we let confused and bewildered Stacy back in. There was some kicking and verbal abuse and before long Stacy asked if she could see me outside. Knowing what was to come, I humored her and followed her out the door. She immediately tried to shove me out and lock the door. But I put up a fight. And then WHAAAAMM!!!!! Out of nowhere, and I mean nowhere, Chrissie shoves us both out and locks the door!! That sneaky jerk! And this whole time Steve, a.k.a. John Mayer, from Clemens was watching us as he walked from Sal's just shaking his head and smiling to himself. So we got back in, and some jelly bean throwing and fly swatter slapping later we were going about our closing duties. All the while Stacy repeatedly but in new ways asking if I wanted to go outside. Then the sun began to set and the sky got pink!      As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.      I said to Stace, "Hey, look at how pink the sky is." And she said, "Hey Jackie do you want to go outside? I hear the sky is pink." Haha, nice try Stace. So she went to the back where Chrissie was, and I continued to reconcile my drawer. Then opportunity struck! They went out on the back stoop, sat on the railing, and yelled up to me, "We're looking at the pretty pink sky."  Muahahaha , I thought. I made some kind of mean comment or face or something, and they closed the door so it was open a crack. Bad choice, girls. I ran back there and pulled it shut so it was locked. Victory was mine! I went back up to the front for all of like 30 seconds, and when I went back to let them in, I see them sprinting toward the movie theater! So I shut the door, and go lock the front door. But then people started wanting to use the store, whatever that was about. Pushy old women. So I had to unlock it. But anyway lottery lady accompanied Chrissie and Stacy back in the store and they made a big deal about it. Whatever. I was obviously the more creative party. And on her way out, lottery lady said to me in a rather hushed voice, "Good job. When I saw them running around I thought, 'Oh man I have to see who locked them out.'" . . . *shrugs*.      Okay so there's Friday in a very detailed, crafty summary. Saturday morning I woke up and Kel and I went out to Kohl's to get some clothing and bookbags and such. Really not too thrilling. Then Mom came to meet us and payed for the stuff, and Kel and Phil continued on to Target while I stayed with my mom to seek a down comforter. Then we met up with Kelly and Phil at Target, and I totally got an ICEE type situation. And then we saw Lil Jon!!!! Well not really. But sure as hell could have been him. He had some East Side boys with him, too.      Tons of dorm crap and a 3-pack of Orbit gum (my major purchase) later, we were outta that joint. Then I rode with Kelly and Phil to the mall to show Kelly where I had gotten a shirt earlier. Two shirts and some Auntie Anne's later, we were outta  that  joint. So we dropped Phil on the side of the road and headed home. It was already flipping 3 o'clock and we had a concert to get to!      Here begins the journey. Had I known the outcome, I would have brought drinks.      Kelly was going with her friends so she left earlier. A little after that my mom and I headed out to pick up my new adoptive family of Mrs. Puchta and Chrissie, the witty Jess Sabato, and the dashing Chris Bowyer. Before long we were on our way, learning that "If you drivin and you hit MLK Boulevard, just turn back. Turn back right there. MLK Boulevard ain't got nothin you want!" Chrissie passed this information on from Chris Rock. A few rain drops and a parking fiasco later, we were rid of our mommies and in line waiting for the doors to open. Cue Mr. Fantastic, the amateur scalper.      This guy may as well have had a sign plastered to his forehead that read, "I'm a scalper, and these tickets aren't real." I think we all felt that we should have given him some tips.      Anyway, 6:30, those doors open, and we set out to find us some shirtage! I think everyone of us got stuck in a battle over two different shirts, one having the specificity of the tour, the other, just being awesome. I opted for the tour shirt, and am mighty content with my decision.      Then we moved onward to our seats, watched DJ whatever be ignored by everyone in the place, and I contacted my sibling unit to find out where she was at. More and more peeps started to fill in, and then I ran into shouting-over-the-speakers tiff with Bowyer.       Chris: "Geez, the DJ's playing all these oldies . . ."   Me: "You got beef, Chris?"   Chris: "*confused face*. . . what?"   Me: "I said, you got beef?"   Chris: "What are you talking about . . ."   Me: "It's a simple question Bowyer . . ."   Chris: "Like beets? B-E-E-T-S? . . . no wait-"   Me: "Vegetables!?!?!?!"   Chris: "Like beats? *busts some dance moves to the beat*"   Me: "*laughs hysterically* No!"   Chris: "Oh like beep? *makes a car horn gesture* B-E-E-P? *shapes a P with his fingers*"    Me: "NO!!! BEEF!! B-E-E-F!!"   Chris: "Why the hell would I have beef?!?!?!"   Me: "It's a saying!!!!!!!"   Chris: "What, is that some old saying?!?"   Me: "Beef, like, you got a problem . . ."   Chris: "Ohh . . . . . . no."      *Shakes it off*      Then we saw Maroon 5 getting ready off stage and the guitarist pointed to Chrissie. She's far more excited about this. But hey, I had mine coming . . .      Just before the band appeared, Chrissie decided she really did want the other shirt too. So she and Sabato headed out and me and Bowyer kicked it in our seats. Kel then called me and I got to see her fine fine purchase of a $5 John Mayer poncho. Nice. After a little while, Chrissie and Sabato re-appeared. After finishing up with ma sis, I turn to find pretzel being offered to me. I accept a piece and make a confused face. "We decided on the eatables, not the wearables." But at the end of the night, we would realize that hey, maybe that wasn't really the best choice . . .      Maroon 5. Fantastic live. Just fantastic. And lead singer? um . . . . . hhhhhhhhot? They were truly stellar. We heard a new song, and they finished up with a cover of "Ain't No Sunshine" leading into Shiver. Awwwwwesome. I called Stace and gave her a listen of "This Love." I was really feeling those cliché images of hundreds of people holding up cellphones. But don't be confused. There were lighters too.      Then on break Chrissie showed some concert security who's boss. Nicely done. *golf clap*      Then Johnny May-May came out. My love. He's awesome, and very talented. Anyone who says otherwise please contact me. Leave a comment. We'll talk. He was wearing a fantastic t-shirt that was light blue with a rainbow on it, and read "heterosexual, lover of rainbows." He just sang all the right songs, and did a great Eric Clapton cover. During this song, John, facing the audience, had another guitarist stand behind him also facing the audience and they played each other's guitars. John reaching backwards. It's okay, just take a moment.       And we got an encore. A new song which is absolutely beautiful, and has got me excited for his next album already. And then he brought out the guitarist from Maroon 5 and they did a little bit of a live remix of "This Love" and then "Neon." Majorly awesome.       Okay so that's all I can really muster up. I have a feeling no one really cares about the petty details anyway. Just know that it was great. Oh and there was a bridge troll involved. And a last remark: what do  we have to do to get some friggin drinks around here!           *Side Note*: to get the full concert experience, one must read   urlLink  Jess's   ,   urlLink  Chrissie's   , and   urlLink  Bowyer's    blogs.

        So Tuesday Chrissie and I did our fantastic graduation project thang again. O.A.R. and Gavin serenaded us while we painted our little room, and we also got to enjoy a fantastic brunch at Penn's Table. They need to reevaluate their orange juice situation. So after a second coat we were outta West Chester and I headed home to . . . well do nothing. Then I walked up to Hallmark to visit my good working friend Stacy!! So I hung around with Stace planning what we'd do when we quit until PJ and Davey drove up and started messing with our cart. Word from the Hallmark wise: don't mess with the cart. Or the exact-o knives. Or the stamp. Or the tape. Or the balloon ribbon.       Hey! Two ringed pretzels are pretzels too!!!!!       . . . they're anal about a few things. Anyway, after Stace closed up we hopped in PJ's car and rode to Dairy Queen, blasting what else but Michael Jackson. After purchasing some dairy delicious products, watching Stacy and PJ beat each other up in the parking lot, then giving defense lessons, we decided to try Genuardi's. We analyzed their balloon selection, and then Stace and I started walking somewhere in the store, and we lost PJ and Davey. So then I decided to put my Mountain Dew buy one get one free cap to use, God bless it. (Here starts my addiction.) And cue Dan. Dan, simply stated, is me and Stacy's new reason for shopping at Genuardi's. Anyway, after exiting the store and realizing that Davey and PJ were nowhere to be found, we reentered the store to see them in the back. PJ made a furry brown friend, which was a mistake, because Stacy instantly became attached. Before long, past relationship history was dredged up and apparently PJ owed Stacy a birthday gift from when they were dating. *shrugs* So our bear friend took a ride on the conveyer belt (what do you call those in the super markets?) and was soon named Crump. (Crump recently changed his name to Mr. Crump, to present a more dignified air.) Then we headed back to Davey's to watch the critically acclaimed "Get Over It." What a fine cinematic piece. Soon enough I was home and that's when I gave birth to this sucker. I felt a need to cover the events of that day. It was an interesting day. And I got two Mountain Dews out of the deal. Not bad.      Wednesday was my day off from that loser Chrissie. More like I was brutally separated!! But I made do. I met up with Allison to play a much needed couple hours of tennis. Afterwards I relaxed around the house for a bit, and headed down the street to meet up with Stace and Dave. From there we picked up the finely coordinated Amanda and headed to the Flecken's for a pool party. All I have to say is . . .       CONGRATULATIONS AMANDA!       She deserves a pat on the back.       Oh, by the way, no matter what anyone says, John Mellencamp is  NOT  famous.       So after some socializing, witnessing youth pastor Greg being the first and only to remove his shirt while playing basketball, and dipping feet in the pool, we had our what Amanda calls "God time." There was a soda drinking contest . . . how to approach this. Brooke held up strong but left the boys to battle it out in her stomach's best interest. As for Dave Good . . . by God. Dave Good is too good for soda tabs. He just gnaws on the can until some goes in his mouth and the rest down his chest and pants. Needless to say belching guy won, and blew chow. Oh and while I was praying a little frog came up and sat beside me. It startled me so much I almost fell in the pool. Stacy and I tried to chase him down, but met his leaf-like brethren instead . . . then when I was away from Stacy and Amanda, Ryan pushed Stacy in. Poor girl. Clothes and all. Amanda too. Not to mention lack of towel. But at least they had suits on. Because before long, I was pushed in. And I had no suit on. Oh well. I really didn't mind. So after a few crisis' solved (. . . uh um Stace? . . . is that it?), AMAZING rocky road brownies eaten, jumps in the pool, friends made (in high girly voice: "one, two, threeeeeee!!"), and shifts of towel usage between the three of us, we headed home. Not before watching Amanda address about a hundred obviously masculine figures in the dark as "Mom???" though. It was a good time.      And then the wonderful happened . . . Kelly came home!!!! Summer session has concluded, and I have a sister again. Well in the living at home sense. So I get a little over two weeks of fun-filled Kelly action!!!! What am I saying? Kelly  and Phil  action is the correct term. My long lost brother. Or was that ugly butt-face? eh. It's all the same. Anyway Phil's sleeping over!!! I have to say, he's a horrible truth or dare player. tisk tisk. Tomorrow is Friday the 13th and Saturday we've got the concert . . . dn dnn dnnnnnnnn . . . . until then!      Peace out kids.

        Clear out folks. I've done the impossible and jumped on the blogging gravy train. Darn. *bites fist*      Well ever since my much admired friend Sabato has started her blog I've found it an appealing activity. And why not? Anything Sabato does is an appealing activity. And soon enough here comes Bowyer, then Moira, and finally Chrissie. Well, I've had it!!! And I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, write a song about the sibbie!      So here I am. With each person who has started a blog I appear more like a trend-following loser. Well trend this! There's one catch. I'm really not all that entertaining. I mean put me up against the aforementioned names and who the heck could appear entertaining?! Well I hope I am to some. I mean I've got a certain sense of . . . aw heck not much. But hey, you want to cry about it? Hm? No? Okay well then let's move on. Stacy will teach you how.      So this summer has been the most unbelievably cluttered, not relaxing summer I have ever had. Painful, I know. But I know I'm not alone. These things sweep over us like a friggin epidemic. Wouldn't surprise me if the majority of those reading this know exactly what I'm talking about. When did summer become an extension of the school year?!?! Two books for English; one that contains one of the most irritating mentally handicapped people I have ever come to experience, and the other so thick you'd be more likely to use it to slap the previously mentioned annoyance than come to know its contents. And another fine book and paper for history, a whole chapter for that fine fine AP Calc, oh and Spanish! Don't even get me started. That's already written up its name tag as "The Class From Hell." And even art. Come on. I have to do two pieces for an art class. Unbelievable. Anyway with like 3 weeks to go I'm nowhere near the light. You see it's like a tunnel . . .      Other than the gloom of the notorious JUNIOR YEAR hanging over my head, I've been doing the usual around these parts. Working at the lovely 'Hell'mark. But hey I've got like a ¢2 raise looming on the horizon! oooooo!       Will Farrell's Anchorman was released, and of course I saw it that day. And two more times after that. AMAZING.       I took a wonderful trip to Long Beach Island with church, and had the pleasure of getting to know some pretty great people. All I have to say is, 'mmmmmm, soap.'       Then I got to spend a week with my mom's family in Sea Isle City, and enjoyed a flash flooding experience. The day I arrived home I caught up with the crew to see The Village. I maintain that I saw Thiggy. Danny'll tell you.      And this week Chrissie and I are doing our graduation project. Oh boy. Well I'll let Chrissie cover this sucker in the future in  urlLink her blog . I just don't have the words right now.      Other than that, experiences have been the usual crazy antics of our friends, including the fair . . . well Chrissie, Jess, and Alex all had a different experience from me, Stace, and Dave. But it all started out the way  urlLink Chrissie tells it  . . . a little advice from Pops. Then in our desperation not to spend money, Stace, Dave, and I all took a trip to the notorious bridge . . . . what the hell, Stace. Anyway, with all the boys making use of the trees and shrubbery, we then realized that we needed a bathroom. We walked to Wawa unable to find what we needed. So we made our way to Eckerd where bathrooms existed so great that it was the obvious choice. But to our dismay, we find a sign that reads "Bathrooms will be closed Saturday, August 7, 2004." Oh that's just great. Then we decided to search for some snackage, and had to chase Dave around the store after he morphed into the ADD 5-year-old version of himself. Anyway, to make a long story short, we used the unbelievably odorous facilities in A Nice Chinese Rest. and proceeded to Wawa where we  actually  purchased snackage. Tastycakes were 2 for $5. How could we possibly turn that down? So we eventually caught up with the very nauseous trio and Chrissie and I made our way over to the Star Trooper. Part 1 of my bad fair experience. These darn 12-year-olds sitting behind us start off by asking us what a prostitute, or maybe a prostate (we're unclear as to the true subject matter), is. Then they proceed to pull our hair. Chrissie is extreeeeeemely tolerant, I proceed to tell them off. Needless to say if that darn ride hadn't made me so dizzy I would have been out of there a lot quicker. Then when I wouldn't ride the stupid slide the lady running the stupid thing proceeded to call me a punk. Not just once. About 12 times. "Man, you such a punk. . . . punk. . . . PUNK. . . . punk . . ." God almighty. Between that and the most obvious display of a sexual relationship I've ever seen, I was ready to bail. *shudders* Never again. From here on out I'm listening to Mr. Puchta.      So I'd say this entry sure as heck is long enough. Hopefully you'll tune in in the future, we've got a concert on Saturday and tennis season starting on Monday. Aren't you excited?!?!?! I know those band kids are.       Peace.
