       Hey there guys,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hows everything going. Today after class I went and helped my Britney Drew pack alla her things into boxes and put them in her dads truck and then we went to her new house (her grand-mas house) and unpacked everything that we brought the first trip. Lets just say we started at like 11ish and didnt get done loading,unloading, and unpacking till about 3ish. Then we went to get some lunch cause we were like starvin, and went back to her house and ate it. And helped her dad bring some other stuff to the truck of theirs that was gonna go to the storage room they had to buy. Britney and I stayed at her apartment and started packin some more things in her room. We almost finished but not quite. The only thing is they gotta be out of there apartment by the end of the week (saturday).   Other than that, nothings really happened. I have 2 more days of school left. Tomorrow and Wednesday, im excited. This weekend were going to Kemah, Texas for one night. Were leaving early saturday morning and coming back sunday night, and then the 3rd is Jr. Registration, and then on the 5th we leave for Baton Rouge till the 8th for Conclave, i get to see Byron this weekend but not for most of the time. It sucks, but i gotta suck it up. lol.  Byron and I have new songs their:   baby when i look at you you know it breaks my heart in two how beautiful you are seen you in a million dreams now your finally here with me we will never be apart i wanna hold you forever thats all i'll ever need chorus you are my love you are my life my heart and soul the truest friend i'll ever know all of my dreams, my fantasy, my reality i love everything you are yes i do everytime i close my eyes it hits me so deep inside how real this feeling is i'm intoxicated by your touch its a sweet sweet rush i'm in love with your kiss your the one that i trust the most you changed me chorus 2 times i love everything you are...You Are by Jimmy Wayne.  She thinks I walk on water She thinks I hung the moon She tells me every morning "They just don't make men like you" She thinks I've got it together She swears I'm as tough as nails But I don't have the heart to tell her That she don't know me that well Chorus: She don't know how much I need her She don't know I'd fall apart Without her kiss, without her touch Without her faithful loving arms She don't know that it's all about her She don't know I can't live without her She's my world, she's my everything And she thinks she needs me Sometimes she cries on my shoulder When she's lying next to me But she don't know that when I hold her That she's really holding me Holding me Chorus Yeah, now the funny thing is She thinks she's the lucky one Chorus She thinks I walk on water She thinks I hung the moon....She Thinks She Needs Me by Andy Griggs.  Well, thats enough for now. ill update this new journal later.
