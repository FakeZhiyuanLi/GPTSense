      Figured the title would draw someone in, since the marketing geek in me knows the importance of  first impressions.   But being a virgin blogger and this my very first post, I find I am more concerned with the quality of the content than the shock factor. I figure it will take a few posts for me to get the hang of things, not unlike one's first sexual experiences - the old "practice makes perfect" idium.   My first thoughts have been on where to start. Being a single Southern girl in her early 30s, I wonder if it wouldn't be like walking into the middle of the movie for me to start writing in diary format on my daily life. But retracing the last three decades would be somewhat boring if not further delaying the purpose of this blog, which is to ponder/comment/espouse on the current events that are my life, which, to be completely honest, is sometimes boring and sometimes definitely not.  And so I come back to the sexual reference, because in the words of an advertising great, "Sex Sells!" But honestly, the anxiety and the imaginging of what the first time will actually be like add so much unnecessary baggage to the ultimate act that one either scares herself out of it or reaches a point of, "hell just get it over with already!" Obviously I have yet to scare myself out of it but am still in a phase of over thinking the whole damn thing.   Having almost survived my first blogging post, I can say that future posts will be in journal format. I'm one of those people who knows a little about a whole lot of things but am not an expert on any particular thing, so random useless facts will pop up regularly.   I haven't even completed my profile yet, so I'll hit the high points. Having already established that I am a girl (funny how in my 30s I still refer to myself as a girl) who lives in the South (that would be U.S.) and is single, I guess the next thing to add is something about the things I think define me. I am an avid University of Texas at Austin fan having graduated from there with a degree in public relations. I am addicted to diet Coke to the point that I carry a small cooler to my friends' dinner parties. Since the seventh grade I have wanted to be a writer. Poems, plays, short stories and the like line my memorabilia boxes. I am a sucker for John Hughes films, as they were defining films for many of us who went through the traumatic, heart-breaking ritual of high school in the mid- to late-1980s. I have two West Highland White Terriers named Austin and Crockett for my love of most things Texas. Travel is my passion, and ten to 14 years ago I did a lot of it.   And with that, I'll wrap things up. Took about 30 minutes, which is probably twice as long as the average sexual first time. Bring the ending back to the beginning.
