       Although it seems only two people have read the post from yesterday, I write this as I will be leaving you. Don't celebrate yet, il be coming back next sunday ;-p I seem to have started talking with nothing on my mind. Incessant babble it is then.  I shall start with something that may bore all not interested in the slightest with football. I shall talk about yesterday's appauling show of referee skills. Where was "Terry's hand in the keepers face"??? all i can see is the keepers fat fist in Terry's face! Terry's hand blatantly went down past the keepers shoulder!!! We played a hard match both against Portugal  and  the referee last night. Well done lads. My congratumalations go out to Joe Cole and to Lampard. Both of whom did not deserve to be on a losing team. Both players played a world class match, against a sunday league referee. What was the deal with the penalty spot? That spot was as flat as (insert chosen supermodels name)'s chest! Why did the referee not change ends? even Ronaldo had trouble with it! (he stil scored tho >:-( i'm beginning to doubt Beckham)  This random moan was bought to you by Jim x

       Well I guess It must be your lucky day. Not that anyone is actually going to read this, I guess im doing it for fun, what a strange thought! We're all at a funny stage in our lives now. My GCSE's finished on tuesday and now I'm found at a loose end. So now i decide to join the  wonderful world of work!  Fun fun. A note to all of you out there,  don't  apply for a job in the same place as your parents. Oh the embarrassment. Never again I tell you, never. Is it in a parents job description to be embarrasing at the most inconvenient times?? Look ^ my mind is wondering! Never felt that before, tis strange! Ya so back to work... I find myself in the desperate position of trying to earn enough money over the summer to buy a car AND insurance to boot, and enough mulah for a week in Devon with the lads. We're talking some serious workage here.  *shoots self for using suffix "age" and sounding like one of wards dreaded proles*  At first I thought that working would be kinda cool, until I realised that where I have applied to work the day starts at 0815. Ah. More lovely early mornings then. No peace for the wicked so the saying goes, or something like that. Well I'd love to carry on depositing my thoughts here (no joke I'm actually liking this!) but i seem to have developed a sore wrist from typing more than I was ever supposed to so I shall bid you all a fond farewell and  hope I get some comments!   *shakes fist*  Adeiu, Jim x

       I got this&nbsp;a couple of months ago in an email, but disregarded it was one of those chain emails trying to get you to feel sorry for some kid in&nbsp;timbuktu with AIDS. But I opened it up this morning whilst going through my inbox, and chanced to read it.   Reading this made me think about Megan, and how I'd feel if i ever lost her. I dont think I'd cope as well as Jay. Please do me this one thing. Read this. Thats all I ask.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Brittney loved basketball,  Friends and parties too,  And when it came to painting,  That's all she wanted to do.  She painted everything she saw,  Birds, flowers, and the sky,  Some days she sat at her window,  And painted everything that passed her by.  But lately she'd been feeling woozy,  Her muscles ached a lot,  And her parents got kind of worried,  So they took her to the doc.&nbsp;   The doctor took a couple of tests,  To see if everything was okay,  Then the nurse came out with a look of sadness,  And this is what she had to say;&nbsp;    "I'm sorry, but you've got leukemia,"  You've got about 3 months more."  Then Brittney got up and ran out of the room,  And slammed the office door.&nbsp;   She ran down the street screaming,  And cried her eyes out dry,  And stayed up all night,  Wondering what it's like to die.&nbsp;   Her parents held her tightly,  And said, "We love you,"  "We'll make your last few months the greatest,"  "We'll do anything for you."  So Brittney and her parents moved to Florida, to live by the sea,  Because Brittney loved the ocean,  And when she died, that's where she wanted to be.&nbsp;   She spent her days painting,  And horseback riding in by the bay,  But one day she met this guy,  And his name was Jay.&nbsp;   They collected seashells together,  And talked about all kinds of things,  And then one day while walking,  He handed her a ring.&nbsp;   It said, "I love you,"  Which brought tears to Brittney's eyes,  And when he put it on her finger,  She began to cry.   He asked her what was wrong,  and she then replied, "I've got leukemia, and about a month more."  He said," No matter what, I love you  And no matter what, you are the one I adore."&nbsp;   So they spent everyday together,  And swam in the Atlantic all day,  But Brittney was getting weaker,  And it was hard for her stay awake.&nbsp;   So one day Brittney painted her picture,  And gave it to Jay,  She said, "I want you to remember me,"  "Even when I leave this place."  But one day while they were walking,  And searching for seashells in the sand,  Brittney collapsed and started to lose her breath,  And said to Jay, "Please hold my hand."&nbsp;   I love you more than anyone,"  You are my only true love,"  But now my time is up,"  And I'll watch over you from above,"   Then Brittney's body was lifeless,  As she lay in Jay's arms,  And he sat there all day,  And kept her safe from harm.&nbsp;   I hope this teaches you a lesson.  To tell someone you love them whenever you can.   Because maybe they'll be gone tomorrow. And you won't be there to  hold their hand.&nbsp;   Because love is everything to everybody. Without it, the world would be dead. So always tell someone you love them. A  parent, boyfriend/girlfriend, or friend.&nbsp;   It makes a big difference even though you don't think so...Everyone deserves an "I love you."    Because there may be no one for that person to say it back to.

       Have you ever thought about why we're alive? I mean really. Because of course there's always the 'God Vs. The primordial soup' campaign, but why? If there is a God, why create the human race with all it's pain wars and suffering and not a race of beings that are graceful, with startling powers of telekinesis? Or, if we all sprouted from a pile of slurry in a hole in the ground, why was our 'soup' not evaporated by the scorching temperature of the earth all those millions of years ago? I get what we are, and I get who we are, but what I don't get, is why we are. That's what miffs me. I think that if people just stopped and thought about what a miracle\one in a million mistake we are, then we would all be better off. There would be less chavs for a start :-p But if you just look around you, at what we've done, you're sat reading this across the internet on a computer. A computer for christs sake. We evolved from the apes, why are all the other apes all still sat in the jungle eating each other's headlice? It just strikes me that everything we have we take forgranted.  I don't know where all this came from lol but next time you have a minute, just take it to sit there and think about all that is around you. Think about how lucky you actually are. You may think your life is a load of crap sometimes, but it's not really is it? (lol I sound like some old lady from Christian aid) but its true I suppose, we are so much better off than people in other places. I'm sat here writing this on a palm computer, you wouldn't get that in Rio de Janeiro...  Ok I'm going to lose track now because I've been writing this over the course of the past couple of days. It's just occurred to me how all this technology may not be such a great thing. If we had stopped at the telephone, and didn't use text comms, we could have saved on so much confusion. You just can't put enough emotion into a piece of text to justify its meaning. (he says whilst writing) A harmless quotient could turn itself into an unwanted accusation. This also shows how as humans we are so quick to judge, where sometimes we should ask if the meaning is not clear. What IS clear however, is the fact that reading the above shows that something has happened to think this. In short, yes I have made a monumental cockup. No change there then. I'd just like to say to the person concerned, (some of you may guess who this is) that I am truly and deeply sorry.  Finalmente, te amo todos. Gracias por tu tiempo.  Jim  x

        urlLink    I came home from work today to find that thing parked outside my house. I'm not sure whether to be happy or sad... I'll go for an in-betweeney. I've confused myself already, (usually quite hard!) by tidying my room :-o yeah, weird. This guy came to look at our house today, my rents opened the door and were like "oh yes, this is the pit of the house, I would only go in if you dont value your life, it's inhabitant is currently in there, so watch out!" Thanx mum. You ever noticed how "cool" your parents are? No, didnt think so. It's strange, I've never seen the house so tidy, theres new pictures all over the walls and the hoover actually came out!! I'm moving near brackley from bicester, is that nearer to ayles*shitesville*bury??  Hasta Luego.  Jim x   All pictures copyright Jim 2004 so meh!

       I'm not going to pretend anymore, I've given up all hope that anyone is going to read this, (megan may glance at it once in a while I suppose) so I dont care anymore. Hits would be nice, but I'm just going to use this for what it is really... an online diarymabob. Sounds a bit crap really, ah well.  Yeh It's been a while since I posted, I've been on annual camp with cadets, that was awesome. If you're not a cadet, and you're old enough but not too old, I really suggest joining the Air Training Corps. If only for the camps. Immense. At first glance, they look really boring, the programme includes lots of drill + plenty of ironing and polishing/bulling of shoes, but it really doesnt matter. The good things outweigh the bad ones by miles, the only thing being, you dont realise this until you've actually done it so when you're thinking about it, you say to yourself "yeah, that looks fun" (insert own sarcasm) but it is! I really need to find more adjectives. (really. What a lame word) But ya, camp was amazing, met some really good people like bennet, mandy/shandy/adam,  megan , etc etc... all of whom are great. Oh I almost forgot, one person everyone should know is the one and only AVANN. Ah the times we had poking fun at his name... "packinavan, bininavan, oldmaninavan..." Bliss. Anyway, that was my weeks worth of 5 hours sleep a night. (If I was lucky) Then on sunday, I had to get up  again  to go flying! Cuh! I only got in two flights and I didnt like my captain so not really the most productive of days...  *shoots self for saying "really" again*  And so here I am. At work. Who decided upon a 37 hour working week?? Madness! My fourth day and im absolutely knakred! Ah well, It'll keep me fit all this typing and walking to the coffee machine...  Until next time folks...
