      While experimenting with random things, I have found the perfect thing. The little scrolling links bar, will be scraped, and instead, i will havea console, running down the left of my site!!!!  I am currently experimenting at the mo.  i know that my hompepage will have the console. This is the first page i will change it all to. The other pages on my site (there are lots) will probably have it on there as well.   i know that i have been changing my site around a lot at the moment. I am hoping that this will be the last change. Remeber, it is all for the best. All the changes make my site look great (or better) anyway, so wth?

      I have just been selected (or our group has been selected)to perform our play in front of the whole year.  OK I'll start at the beginning if you are that desperate to hear the story. (yes - that means that there is someone on earth who is reading this. Whooooooo!!!)  In English, (duuuuuh, of course this is at school) we have been writing reverse fairy tales. We had to write them, practice them, and then perform them to the rest of the group. We just did perform them, and our group came in the final two. The n we had to perform these again, to see who would win. We did.  This means that we have to perform this crappy play in front of the whole year, and most of the teachers as well.   I am so nervous. Maybe i should go to www.iamnervousecosihave2performmyplay2thewholeyeargroup.com hahahahahah if you believe that that website address is real, you need help man. (of course, if you are a woman, then, well, you probably need help too. Yes you do. I'll tell you why. U are actually bothering to read all of this junk). Seek it.
