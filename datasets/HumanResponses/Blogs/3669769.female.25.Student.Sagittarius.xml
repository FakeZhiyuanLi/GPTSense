      I was blinded on that cold fall day Whining and nagging I went on my way Unaware each word tore us further apart And that was the price of ignoring my heart My mind reminded me of the distance we had While my heart whispered, cried, and was sad I wouldn’t understand why he wasn’t here I couldn’t see past myself and  my  fear  He looked away on that cold fall day Quietly he watched me go my own way Aware of the hurt my words caused within And his inability to be the perfect man His grand efforts were lost after several defeats Why couldn’t she see the big picture complete He wouldn’t understand why she always wanted him there He couldn’t see past his duty, the future, and  his  fear  Together we shared more than we knew Yet we were alone, unsure what to do Our eyes were closed along with our minds Compromise and forgiveness were rare finds An apology was whispered with a cold kiss Life went on, he and I, just like this Unknowing that a loving heart also dies And no one sees until they open their eyes   2001-by me It is unlawful to reprint or publish any part of this selection without the author's written consent.

      I heard a song today. One that swept me back to a time in my past  I had hidden from myself.  Rusted and faded in the spot where we fell In a place I thought I had left behind.  Yet, it was there waiting to be remembered,  This sad little memory. A time when I was happily bundled in forbidden love.  Waiting far too long  For something I forgot was wrong.  Society was such a cold, uncaring fool,  Forcing me to unwrap myself from love's warmth  And find another better suited to It's choosing.  Remembering the way I felt then  And realizing how I feel now  I recognize how stupidly I threw away happiness...forever?  Miserable, I sit here listening to my regret,  Fearing that I'll never love again , And push repeat.   2000-by me -Quotes from Until I Fall Away by the Gin Blossoms.

      When I have fears that I may cease to be    before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain; Before high-piled books in charact'ry    hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain; When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face    huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace    their shadows with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,    that I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the faery power    of unreflecting love;- then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think    Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.   -John Keats (1795-1821)

      As I await the eventual overthrow of the sun  by the moon and his army of glittering wishes,  I recollect the hallowed day our souls collided.   Through the many glimpses of shattered dreams  and dashed hopes for happiness,  my mind stumbles upon the "prodigious birth of our love."  How different it has been  from all the hopeless impostors of the past.  The soft grin of your lips  and the warm, content glow that shines from your soul's windows  are now the goals destined to my existence,  your happiness, the only reason for my being.  Through the tunnel of the future emerges,  you and I, star-crossed lovers,  meant to be, strong and true.   The battles is over, the conquest complete,  the moon and his army claim their now darkened territory.  I watch in silence, completely in love,  dreaming of you, my little star,  my perfect wish come true.   1998-by me -The quote, "the prodigious birth of our love" taken from William Shakespeare's  Romeo and Juliet - It is unlawful to reprint or publish any part of this selection without the author's written consent.

      Day by day I wait and pray That I will get a raise in pay. A year now I've worked and served My best to my job, I know I've earned A simple fifty cents maybe more. My devotion I've given to this store. The along comes Misses Right, She and the boss are really tight. Day by day I know she prays That no one will see her sneaky ways. I work and slave while she kissed butt I'm having trouble keeping my mouth shut. Before I knew it, she was making more than me Good Lord, can they not see Past her greedy smile and liar's glee? Why is this I pay this huge fee To hold my tongue and keep working hard? Smile, oh, laugh, ha, she is a card! All she does, I do and more Except kiss butt and adore The boss who hands out the cash to her and I. I refuse to stoop to her level, why?   1997-by me I wrote this poem while working at Sonic Drive-In. My best friend and I worked there together our junior and senior year's of high school. We had a lot of great times unless 'Monica' was working. It's been seven years since we left Sonic but sadly, I'll never forget the girl who was hired and kissed ass all the way to the top...
