      I thought I needed a fresh start. I was sick of seeing the same old crap I always post so this is the new Andowen blog. So much has happened in the last week and it has al become a blur really, I can’t keep up with it all, and even more so in the last few days. My god, I don’t know anymore. I just wish. Well I don’t know what is wish, I should post my story on here… if I still have it on this comp. nope I don’t, it was not a very good one anyway, it was just about my past life of being a raging alcoholic. I handed it in for my English class and the teacher had to ask me if that is what it is really like. I was like; um… no. and I also wrote another story about my trip around the world.  I don’t do much writing really, can’t be bothered or else I am sleeping, like all the time. I can’t wait till June 10th! Harry Potter comes out!!!!! WOO HOO. And I think the week after that our movie is going to be shown! The one we made for the 15/15 film festival, that is going to be so funny.  I am making a website at the moment for our Volleyball association. It is going to be good, because not only are we going to have everything you need to know about the game but we are going to have lots of other inside jokes if you like. Like we are going to have a lonely hearts section where Bridget gets to be the president, seeing as she is the loneliest, and just that sort of thing.     This damn class is so BORING! God damn I hate it. It makes you want to go to sleep. And the teacher is a right bitch, she really is the child of the devil.  Home is behind.  The world ahead.  And there are many paths to tread.  Through shadow,  To the edge of night  Until the stars are all alight   Mist and shadow  Cloud and shade  All shall fade  All shall...fade.   i love that song as much as i love the guy who sang it. GO BILLY

      Lay down  Your sweet and weary head  The night is falling  You have come to journey's end  Sleep now  And dream of the ones who came before  They are calling  From across the distant shore   Why do you weep?  What are these tears upon your face?  Soon you will see  All of your fears will pass away  Safe in my arms  You're only sleeping   What can you see  On the horizon?  Why do the white gulls call?  Across the sea  A pale moon rises  The ships have come to carry you home   And all will turn  To silver glass  A light on the water  All Souls pass   Hope fades  Into the world of night  Through shadows falling  Out of memory and time  Don't say  We have come now to the end  White shores are calling  You and I will meet again  And you'll be here in my arms  Just sleeping   Chorus   And all will turn  To silver glass  A light on the water  Grey ships pass  Into the West

      Cant wash it all away Cant wish it all away Cant cry it all away Cant scratch it all away Cant fight it all away Cant hope it all away Cant screem it all away It just wont fade away  when you dont want to feel, death can seem like a dream. but seeing death, really seeing it. makes dreaming about it fucking ridiculous

As privileged as a whore victims in demand for public show swept out through the cracks beneath the door

      There's the moon asking to stay Long enough for the clouds to fly me away  Well it's my time coming, i'm not afraid to die  My fading voice sings of love, But she cries to the clicking of time  Of time   Wait in the fire...   And she weeps on my arm  Walking to the bright lights in sorrow  Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow  Oh my love  And the rain is falling and i believe  My time has come  It reminds me of the pain I might leave  Leave behind   Wait in the fire...   And I feel them drown my name  So easy to know and forget with this kiss  I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow

      I linger in the doorway Of alarm clock screaming monsters Calling my name Let me stay Where the wind will whisper to me Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story  In my field of paper flowers And candy clouds of lullaby I lie inside myself for hours And watch my purple sky fly over me  Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming Cannot cease for the fear  Of silent nights Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming The goddess of imaginary light

      Catch me as I fall Say you're here and it's all over now Speaking to the atmosphere No one's here and I fall into myself This truth drive me Into madnessI know  I can stop the painIf I will it all away  I'm frightened by what I see But somehow I know That there's much more to come Immobilized by my fear And soon to beBlinded by tears I can stop the pain If I will it all away

      I know I said it, I know I did it Maybe I went overboard to prove a point But sometimes my pride gets in the way Maybe I need some time away to get my head together, yeah, yeah   Maybe this was my last chance  I may never get to hold your hands again I can say that I’m a better person I’m sorry Because you made me understand  I’m so sorry that I tore your heart apart last night And I’m sorry if I scarred you again today  I didn’t mean to take your dreams and make them seem so trite  I sincerely, completely apologize for doin’ what I did   Everything you taught me and everything you showed me It never seemed that I would listen to anything But you’ve got my attention more than you know I take it in, I dealt with it, but I waited too late to use it...

      i am glad that i dont feel any emotions for the things i do in life. god i was selfish, a bitch, mean minded, cruel, horrible, evil, cold hearted, sinister and a nasty peice of work last night. yet i dont feel sorry, sad, or any of the above... i feel nothing for what i did. its harsh i know but damn, why go around feeling let down by what you have done? why wollow in what was said. just move on, forget about it. if only i could take my own advice...  Paralysed, I cannot breath tearstained, unable to inhale kneeled down, face on the ground screaming aloud but cannot hear the sound  I would have given my life why can't I give away my pain  For my mind of child unbearable inside inner demons feeded by my mind four walls still closing in why I still feel when I'm dead within

      death is a strange thing. it is 12:20am and i am talking to two diffrent people about doing yourself in. but i better not get into how i would do it. i might get into trouble...   Deep inside secrets burning Should have known all the while what's true Went along, to fool myself Can't go on, I can't escape it

      When i saw you, I was not even looking I heard you scream without raising you voice will I run or let you have your fun I feel like I ain't got no choice.  But maybe I ask too much or walk in the wrong direction All those thoughts drive me insane and i wonder how long I fell this.  Pain, is not really what it is no, it's something different with a different name and you, you never tell me damn thing I hope someday I'll learn to play this game.  Fear, of course I fear the unknown because the unknown is a stranger to me but if you erase the pj's then what could a stranger be that remains to be seen.  Life goes on, it's just the same every day. Life goes on, though you think you feel this pain.

      just thought i would write what is going though my mind at the moment: dflkgrheli jbnaklrneg alerjhg lanrbglk jvlakjrbgl nkbglkjarbglaer jgfnvbla krhglaiughnfbvla rgliaubkljvnl aruhglbgg... its all goony goo goo...  You think that I can’t see right through your eyes Scared to death to face reality No one seems to hear your hidden cries You’re left to face yourself alone.  god i am so sick to death of all the shit just running though my mind. i wish i could spend one day, where i can be with just me. and have nice thoughts. i am not afraid to die. god i need to get away from her! she is the most anoying thing god created... i think i will have  to move out. i am sick of her shit... cant think straight when she is around. i dont know. i'll have a yarn to the olds tonight...

      I can hear Your voice, your voice Calling from the window When you yelled that night I didn't understand at all  But you hurt And you cried And you're mad And you're angry at the world You want to tear it down You want to pull it down,  Come on and lay down Lay down your pain

"do you think things will ever get better for you?" well let us ask the depths of my fucked up mind. nope i dont see it, i just done see it. it might come, and god knows i will welcome it with open arms, but gee wilikers, i dont know...

      now is not a good time to post, i am really shaky. but i am really bord. i am babysitting and the kids are in bed, as they should be at this time... maybe we look for secrets because we cant believe our minds. i should stop playing with lighters... i keep burning myself, well it doesnt help when you hold your hand over the flame...  I pretended I'm glad you went away These four walls closin' more every day And I'm dying inside And nobody knows it but me  Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows Now I'm cryin' inside And nobody knows it but me  I carry a smile when I'm broken in two Now I'm nobody without someone like you I'm tremblin' inside, and nobody knows it but me I lie awake, its a quarter past three I'm screamin' at night As if I thought you'd hear me Yeah my heart is callin' you And nobody knows it but me

      He was always such a nice boy The quiet one With good intentions He was down for his brother Respectful to his mother A good boy but good don't get attention One kid with a promise The brightest kid in school He's not a fool Reading books about science and smart stuff It's not enough, no Cause smart dont make you cool,   He's not invisible anymore With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse Since he walked through that classroom door He's all over primetime news  Mary's got the same size hands As Marilyn Monroe She put her fingers in the imprints at Mann's Chinese Theatre show She coulda been a movie star Never got the chance to go that far Her life was stole Now we'll never know  No no no no oh  They were crying to the camera Said he never fitted in He wasn't welcomed He showed up to the parties We was hanging in Some guys puttin' him down Bullying him round round Now I wish I woulda talked to him Gave him the time of day Not turn away If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far He might have stayed at home Playing angry chords on his guitar  He's not invisible anymore With his baggy pants and his legs in chains Since he walked through that classroom door Everybody knows his name  Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away  He had a tryout with the Sixers Couldn't wait for Saturday  Now we're never gonna see him slam Flying high as Kobe can His life was stole  Oh now we'll never know

      Listen to each drop of rain  Whispering secrets in rain  Magically searching for someone to hear That story be more than it hides Each droplet long gone Can't we stay for a while? It's just to hard to say goodbye Listen to the rain  I stand alone in the storm  Suddenly sweet I say no Couldn't they stay for you haven't much time Open your eyes to the love around you You can feel youre alone But I'm here still with you You can do what you dream Just remember to listen to the rain

      i woke early one morning the earth lay cold and still when suddenly a tiny bird perched on my window sill he sang song so lovley so carefree so gay that slowly all my troubles began to slip away he sang of far off places of laughter and of fun it seemed his lovley trilling bought up the morning sun i stirred beneath the covers then crept slowly out of bed and gently shut the window and crushed his fucking head I AM NOT A MORNING PERSON!!!!

      i woke up one morning and was happy to see the sun. i steped outside and smiled at the sight of the bird in the trees and to hear the cows in the distant padock. by the afternoon i was scared. the sun was getting to hot, the birds were too small to see and the cows were yelling at me. by night time. the sun had gone down, never to come back, the birds were gone, and the cows had been slaughted.

      I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter So what can I say And twisted thoughts that spin, round my head I'm spinnin, I'm spinnin How quick the sun can, drop away  And now my bitter hands Grate on broken glass Of what was everything All my pictures have been washed in black Tattooed everything All my love gone bad turned my world to black Tattooed all I see, All that I am All that will be

      I dream about, how it's going to end, Approaching me quickly, Leaving a life of fear, I only want my mind to be clear, People, making fun of me, For no reason but jealousy, I fantasise about my death, I'll kill myself from holding my breath,
