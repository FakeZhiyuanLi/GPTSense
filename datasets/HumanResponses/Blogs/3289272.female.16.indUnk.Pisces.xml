            Frylock and the Mooninites    In Web Mastery I learned alot about HTML and a few things I never knew before, like the hexadecimal code. I also have improved my talent in paint (see above).  I really like HTML and believe I will never forget what I have learned this past year.   I   learned   how   to   change   letter   size .  And make things  Italic ,  Bold  and  Underlined .  And I learned many other things. Thank you Mr. Rea! =)

         My name is Cecil, Pronounced (Seh Sol).   I am very popular among friends because I never say the wrong things and one day I plan to become a SAMURI!!!  I am fluent in 12 languages but only I know because of course I can't speak. I have my lips sewn shut. And now I shall demonstrate...  Lillehammer i sommer gir deg kombinasjonen av tradisjon og dagens opplevelsestilbud. Her finnes museer og gallerier, særegne spisesteder med god mat og en rikholdig meny av opplevelser. Nærheten til Hunderfossen Familiepark med mange tilbud for barnefamilier gjør området til et spennende og variert reisemål i forbindelse med sommerferien. I tillegg har vi fjellområdet Nordseter og Sjusjøen, som tilbyr en mengde aktiviteter for fritid og rekreasjon.  And that is only a piece of my genius!  I am also a member of over 30 organizations, my resume is incredible. People seem to think I am a snob because I am british and don't talk much. But I can assure you that I am just as sane as the next guy, Kupo!  I find this assignment tedious and time consuming but nevertheless interesting. All Visigoths and Spiders please leave now, I am sick of your back talk.  I must go now... The bat signal is calling me!  And remember... Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, Im still Im still Cecil from the block.

      I am way behind on this whole assignment deal and frankly I am annoyed... I have been trying to add links but my computer is crappy and dosen't want to obey me. One day all machines will obey me! But until then...   This entry is supposed to be about the future and all I can really say about where I will be is I am hopefully following my existing plans. I plan to live with someone and go to art college. And I am aware that I will probally not be able to do both. So I am going to have to make a tough decision... but until then...Right now everything is just peachy! And I aim to keep it that way.

       urlLink Regrets... ... Well I guess everyone has some.  I guess I could say that I regret breaking up with a certain someone, but of course if I had not I may not be where I am today. So maybe I would've taken it back a year ago but now its a different story.  Every day I regret something I said or did eairler that same day. And I am pretty sure I may have a few self-confidence issues because of that. It's pretty weird though, every day I go home and call myself an idiot for things I did or said at school; but no matter how much I beat myself up about it I never change the things I do. I just continue hating myself.

      Well here goes another post. =)  Lets see... whats new...  Well today my boyfriend ate a worm. He said it tasted pretty good but it still had a little dirt on it. I find it ironic that he washed off the dirt in sewer water. God I love him.  Steven and I collect Magic the Gathering Playing cards. I guess that makes us dorks. Once we had a discussion as to who was the bigger dork and he said I dwelled deeper within the Dork-forest because I go to the Renasance Festival every year. I thought it made me cool, but I could be wrong.  Did I mention that I like to ramble?

      Well this is an assigned Webblog. Thank you Mr. Rea.  Well I am a female... I like long walks on the beach and candle lit dinners. =)  Seriously... My name is Deborah and my character on Final Fantasy XI is Isimek, maybe youv'e seen her.  I love art, poetry, sushi and cats. I have a picture in my room of a cat making sushi. My room is quite interesting.  Mr. Rea dosen't want us to post personal information because old men can hunt us down and we might end up next to their frozen fish sticks in the big freezer located in their basement. Well he didn't say all that, but it  was  implied.  I have two eyes and two parents, I guess that makes me a lucky kid... or not.  I founded my own religion called S.O.A.R, it is basically the whole anti-religion thing with a twist. I like it.  I will leave you with a thought...  Why can't I start my own multi-million dollar company? Answer that.
