						   Lately I've recognized that I'm in some sort of holding pattern.  I'm waiting for something, but I don't know what it is.  Yesterday, as I knocked off work at 8:05 a.m., I felt a deep sadness that seemed to emanate from nowhere.  I recognize that feelings are sort of like spirits that can occupy a person and then move on.  The entity that is fear is best dealt with by meditation once or twice a day.  I meditate most days when I awaken and before I go to sleep.  When Phobos decides he wants to have a go at my hormones, I can allow the demigod in and to have fun with my chemicals, but I have found that meditation has allowed me to keep my wits about me.  I don't let Phobos, son of Ares, have my soul or my mind.  Triste, on the other hand, is a goddess who sometimes does grab me through my soul.  There's a lot of grieving to sort through and to release in my life.  When Triste enters into the frame, I frequently feel like things are hopeless, that no action is possible, that there's nothing to be done.  I guess some would call this depression.  Perhaps Thomas Moore's more classical take on it as Melancholy is more apt.  But Triste frequently vanishes when I help another person.  That's some amazing feat, just by holding the door open for someone or respectfully giving someone directions.  Or refusing to give a lying panhandler any of my money to go off on whatever spree he or she might have in mind.    I don't know why I called this particular post "Action," but it feels right.  The three A's--awareness, acceptance and action--put it last for a reason.  I feel like I want to act, but the other two A's aren't in place yet.  The sadness that I'm feeling could have various etiologies.  Last week was the 22nd anniversary of when my folks told me that if I was gay they'd disown me because they loved me.  I have also a residue of "veranophobia"--hatred of sumemrtime from my fat days.  I also have a feeling that major changes are coming my way due to other actions I'm taking like finishing my 8th Step and getting ready to make amends in Step 9.  There's a lot going on underneath the surface right now.    More will be revealed.  Then more will be required.

						   I went to the Gay Pride parade in NYC yesterday.  Glad I went, but I have to remark how I still see the world through OB Citizen eyes.  While I don't expect people to reject me based on how I look, I still project an aura of discomfort as if I was still 120 pounds overweight.  This takes time to disengage from my body and soul, I realize.  I've only been at this maintenance game 10 months now, and I can't expect to suddenly transform into someone who's only known this weight forever.  That will never happen, because I'll have those memories of carrying that extra weight and how I lived my life expecting isolation and victimization.  I'm in the hallway when it comes to this game of attraction and intimacy.  Going to the parade for the first time in 6 years was a step.  I give myself kudos for that, even though it was difficult for me as 12 Noon for me is like 12 Midnight for everyone else.  I only got to see the first part of the parade, through the Marching Band basically, when I realized I had to go home and call it a day.  I was also tired and getting over an exposure to industrial allergens and toxins the day before, so I was out-of-sorts in more ways than one.  Still I did go, and I'm grateful.  Let this be the start of new adventures...

						   I had a conversation with my best friend Michael yesterday.  I mentioned a book I was reading, which made the distinction between shamans and shamanists, it being that shamans are individuals working within an indigenous tradition, while shaman ists  are those who incorporate shamanic practices into their spiritual lives.  Michael expressed frustration about the semantic nitpicking of the whole thing, and wondered whether or not it was the Ego that sought out this sort of hairsplitting.  Discrimination regarding word-choice is a fascinating area of inquiry to me.  I sometimes agonize over the right words when I'm writing something creative, and also sometimes when it's something close to my heart politically or spiritually or in whatever way it might manifest.  The distinction between "Shaman" and "Shamanist" probably developed over time, through the school of Trial and Error.  It's partly a marketing tool--the book I was reading was written by a founder of the Faculty of Shamanics--that term also being a descriptor of the field wherein the Shamanist works.  (Gets confusing when you realize the Shamanist practices Shamanics where the Shaman practices Shamanism.  Yeah, you got that right.)  I also would guess that the terminology developed out of a desire not to step on the toes and belief systems of the indigenous peoples, but without abandoning the notion of a shaman- word-root for purposes of attraction and promotion.  Word-deployment such as this gets to be manipulative, hence Michael's irritation.  It's like the coiner of the term, while dismissive of those who would cobble together a "weekend spirituality" that strip-mines other cultures of their beloved practices to enclose them within parameters of "spiritainment" (shudder!), also attempts to appeal to these same spiritainment-seekers who may be lying to themselves about their spiritual practice.  Sort of a hucksterish "we're different from them" approach designed to net some consumers along with the serious students.  Having read an autobiographical account of an actual shaman ( Secrets of a Talking Jaguar  by Martin Prechtel), I do see that an exquisite sensitivity and respect for more land-based cultures possesses paramount importance.  People like Prechtel didn't ask to be shamans, and they slogged through what is ostensibly a training, internship, residency and then practice not at all unlike what allopathic doctors must endure.  Within the Mayan culture Prechtel partook of, he functioned as a doctor/lawyer of the soul and spirit.  Sometimes he wished the cup would be passed away from him.  I'm deeply grateful to Mr. Prechtel for his book because it disabused me of the notion of wanting to be a shaman, much in the same way the notion to become a doctor evaporated once I followed one through the course of his day.  Still, in my meditations and journeys, I encounter animal figures and human guides who share with me insights into the incarnate experience I enact in these 3 dimensions.  I suppose that makes me--shudder--a "Shamanist."  I don't possess surety as to what it all means.  The mask of Explorer covers my face as I gather information as to what my spirituality needs, what contours it inscribes.  Other people's experiences and the reverence they bring with them into their lives tells me more about the nature of my own soul and spirit than anything else.  I pick it up from all sorts of sources, some even Judeo-Christian.  I sometimes joke that my "religion" is "Twicaltry".   T ake- W hat- I - C an- A nd- L eave- T he- R est-y.  I have to tailor my spirituality to suit the contours of my soul, not try to shoehorn it into a prefab mold.  And perhaps my foray into neologism is itself an ego-move, though I recognize it's all kind of silly ultimately.  Really what it comes down to is how do I work with others.  Whether they get me or not is irrelevant--St. Francis of Assisi admonishes us to seek to understand rather than be understood in his awesome prayer.  Language sometimes gets in the way of a truer understanding, but if I can sit with another's ego-moves and let them work themselves out, maybe even ask pointed and pertinent questions myself, the commonality will arise and a new point of agreement can be established.  You say Shamanist, I say Shaman let's call the whole thing off...

						   I would like to facilitate a class or workshop on Critical Thinking.  I'm not exactly sure how it would work, but I need to say one thing about Crit Think--it's not Critical Theory.  Critical Theory as I understand it, is a segment of Cultural Studies where scholars delve into the metanarratives underlying different works, or develop philosophies of patterns that exist in various subjective media.  And objective media too, come to think of it, since so much of what passes for "objective" is merely bias dressed up to look like there's no slant whatsoever.  I bypass calls for objectivity because I feel in my heart it's dishonest on some level.  Which leads to what critical thinking is.  Theory is great and all, but rarely does Critical Theory lend itself to action.  At best it lends itself to becoming part of an artist's style.  I'm thinking of post-postmodern writers such as Acker, Tillman and Dennis Cooper.  Theory is a huge part of their works, and it works for them.  But Critical Thinking is not Critical Theory.  In a CritThink workshop, theories may be discussed, but ultimately it's about the three A's--awareness, acceptance and action.  When I think of a workshop on Critical Thinking, what I'm wanting to do is provide a laboratory of honesty, open-mindedness and willingness to see from a different perspective whatever problematic area exists in our lives upon wich C.T. may be worked to one's benefit.  I'm going from a book I read by Stephen Brookfield on Developing Critical Thinking in Adult Learners.  (The title was something like that.  I can look it up on Amazon at a future date.)    Critical Thinking incorporates all the various kinds of intelligences we have.  It brings in our reasoning ability, to be sure, but also our emotional intelligence, our spiritual intelligence, our physical intelligence as well as the mental.  Critical Thinking as I get it is meant to be a "whole foods" approach to facing difficulties and solving problems in our lives.  Sometimes a plan of action will be mapped out, and other times it'll just be offering minor changes to approaches we might take, and at still other times, the upshot of a session might lead to someone seeking therapy or the outside viewpoint of a professional.  Though hopefully someone who saw that as their next step wouldn't stop after that, and would come back to the workshop, willing to share info and tinker more with the tasks at hand.  I'm just sort of drawing out a general sketch of how I think it should work.  But the key to critical thinking too is that it's opening up a dilemma to a group of people who are there to face their situations and share their courage with others.  A person in a CT workshop would be opening themselves up to people asking very basic, maybe even "stupid" questions.  But sometimes that stupid question turns out to be just what the person ordered.  One time I was in a workshop where people were talking about "The Lesiban and Gay Aesthetic."  There was all sorts of theory and folderal happening there, but one ingenuous young man raised his hand, and asked the fundamental question "What's an 'aesthetic?'"  The great thing is that no one laughed at the guy.  But then several people talked about what it meant in very concrete ways that helped everyone in the room locate themselves in a context.  The truth is we are always teaching others all the time, everywhere we go.  I learn from the Bus Driver I saw hello to who drives the bus that will take me to work.  I learn from the cashier I pay for my cashews and my banana.  I am teaching the people I walk past as I head to a meeting or wander about without a care in the world.  There's always opportunity for critical thinking and its applications to be tried and tested.  I just would like to find a mode and a space to make it more conscious.

						   I work overnight, and my schedule from week to week allows me to have Tuesday & Wednesday nights off as my weekend.  I also take every other Thursday off as I work 46 hours each week I do the Thurs-Mon routine.  Working the night shift has its obvious minuses--isolation, feeling out of synch with the rest of the world.  But the Night Shift does have some nice advantages.  "Day People" are for the most part political critters.  Night Folk for the most part won't be liquid papering our names on staplers or declaring a cubicle to be "ours" even when we share it across shifts.  Third Shift people at law firms seem to be pretty much independent, self-starters, mavericks even.  We know we're there to do a job and we don't make our jobs into our lives.  Lots of us who work third are artists, have other businesses, or fill our diurnal lives with other possibilities that we wouldn't be able to do if we worked the mainstream shift.    Personally, I think 2nd Shift is harder.  I used to work a second shift at another firm, which I think liked to take newcomers to the legal field because the vibe of the place was vampiric.  (Footnote/sidebar:  Some night shift folk like to use the word "vampire" to describe ourselves b/c the bloodsuckers are creatures of the night.  I personally don't like that word to describe us because the way I use the word "cunt" is the onomatopoetic sound they make when the fangs go into the flesh of their prey, and then the metonymic application thereof so that "cunts" act as a stand-in for "vampires" like "grunts" can mean laborers.  Also I don't have the cunt politics of say a Dick Cheney or a Cuntonin Scalia.  Talk about vampires!)  It's pretty clear to  me that nice people start out as associates at law factories, then they slowly turn into scary people who have to put up with a lot of abuse, not only from the partners and the loathesome clients, but also from their peers who come into the fray in a manner not unlike what happens with pledges and fraternity hazings.  As a word processor in this toxic environment, I was deemed pretty low on the totem pole, though to some not quite the lowest.  I always felt like I was being fed to the wolves.    2nd Shift at a law firm deals with the pressures of Fed-Ex cut-offs.  That's the shift that always feels like it's running up against the clock.  First shift can feel that way in a cyclical pattern, but with Second it's neverending.  Third Shift seems to be a shift where the time can flow out generously.  There's nothing quite like having a huge Offering Memorandum with lots of changes and 8 whole hours to get it done, get it to Proofreading and then back in for corrections until the doc is done.  Third Shift is expansive that way.  There was no Third Shift at the previous firm.  Second shift there and at other firms seems to me to be the most difficult shift, not only within the culture of the company but also extending out into the sphere of my life.  It literally shut my life down.  At least with graveyard, I have some socializing options, but with 2nd Shift, I was getting up when people were working, I was working when people were socializing, and getting off work when people were either going to bed or in various states of inebriation on the weekends.  Later I found out from a nurse who's worked the various shifts in the hospitals, that the 2nd Shift was the "Drunk Shift" and the Third Shift was the "Compulsive Eating Shift."  I think that's also probably true of law firms, though not of the one I work at presently.   As for the other one, I didn't stay there long enough to give that a thorough vetting.  With these benefits, the real question is do I wish for this lifestyle to continue on for the rest of my days?  No, obviously, I don't.  The gift/curse of the human being is that we can acclimate ourselves to all sorts of situations.  I'm now in a stage where it's important I don't isolate anymore.  I need to get out into the world and be a bigger part of it.  Perhaps this is a counterintuitive way to do it--I'm still by myself, typing these words into a computer, at 3:40 a.m. or so.  Gotta have faith.  My friends, sponsors, and spirit guides are all counseling me to mix it up a lot more.  One day I'll have a diurnal life again.  But this is the way it is for now.    And of course, I'll have a lot more to say later.

						   This is probably a guilty pleasure and a distraction on my part, but I love to read these New Age Websites talking about how these are the times that the prophets have been talking about.  I love to read these things because they sort of help me be grateful for the life I have.  Some of them counsel us to "do nothing and wait for the ascension."  I don't know.  I feel that I need to care for this amazing planet I have incarnated on.  Living in New York City, I'm not sure exactly how best to do that.  I've been thinking I should git on out of ol' Nooyawk.  But I must say that this past spring was the most gorgeous I'd ever seen.    Perhaps it arises solely from my getting abstinent from sugar and flour, or maybe it's because I turned 40 a few months ago, but I have become  alive  to seasonal changes.  I've even become alive to the cross-quarter times of Imbolc (Feb. 2), Beltane (May 1), Lammas (August 1) and Halloween.  I actually feel those times are the emotional and psychic beginnings of spring, summer, fall and winter respectively.  This would explain why the Solstices and Equinoxes are referred to as midseasonal.  (Midsummer = Summer Solstice.)    Of course it's affected my attention to food choices.  I'm eating summer foods now--summer squash & purslane amongst other choices.  I miss some of the fall/winter foods such as winter squash, root vegetables and Brussels sprouts.  But the seasons do offer different choices.  Anyway, to return to the Rapture/Ascension:  It's come to my attention that meditation actually gets our bodies and brains to "vibrate at a higher frequency."  Wayne Dyer talks of this in a couple of his books.  Theoretically I would surmise it's possible that the vibrations could take us beyond the third dimension?  I have become very open to multidimensionality because of my change in eating and my new focus on things spiritual.    Even so, I figure that paying attention to others is also key, because I'm also informed that studies show that when someone gives another person service, not only do the serotonin levels of the server and the served rise, but  so too do the serotonin levels of observers .  One time a friend suggested a way to get out of a funk would be to go to a deli, buy a flower and give it to the first person I saw.  I did this, and the result was an amazing lift in my mood.  I now look for all sorts of opportunities to be useful, even if all it is is talking to the trees.  (They like it when we notice them.)  (I posted this already but I realized I probably have more to say about this topic.  So  to be continued. . .

						   I recently read a Dan Savage column in  Le Voix du Village  where someone had written in about their crazy uncle who had yet another reason to hate gay people.  The reason was so ludicrous and easily disproven that the writer had sought Dan's expert advise about what to do, to which Savage replied in essence, why waste your time?  That this man is going to continue to hate gay people because of his fear of anal sex, regardless of the fact that not all gay men engage in the practice, so write the cunt off. (I paraphrase.)   I've been thinking about the variations on homophobia that exist in the populace.  I see that it's a constantly mutating cancer actually, and one I'm not liable to stomp out any time soon.  There are those of course, who are unthinkingly parroting what others say and all it takes is asking a well-timed "you really think that?" to get them to cogitate toward enlightenment.  Others only need to get to know a couple of gay men and lesbians and that does it.  They see we're just like them and struggling and that some of us will be trustworthy and others not.  But I got to thinking about some of the homophobic people in my life today, and wonder about whether they are total losses or not.  (Btw, this is in process.  The things I write here may be modified in the future--this is critical thinking at work.  Please feel free to point out biases I may have, though the more obvious ones I probably won't do anything about.  It's the subtle ones I'm curious to see in the light of awareness.)  For the most part, I agree with Dan Savage about the recalcitrant ones whose attachment to their fear is greater than their ability to live honestly in the world.  The Big Book of AA refers to a certain class of alcoholics similarly in the clutches of something larger than they are as ones "who seem to have been born that way, they are not at fault, they are incapable of grasping a way of life that demands rigorous honesty."    Homophobia is an illness of similar proportions.  It does shut down people's lives to be afraid to be thought of as gay.  I know a handful of straight fellows who are most times flattered when a gay man indicates interest in them.  To shut that side off, one really has to be crazy.  I mean, I like it when women flirt with me, even though I'm hotter for the humpy dudes.  It's nice to have someone take an interest in me regardless of whether I return the interest or not.  The homophobic cancer works by attempting to fob off sick state onto me as a scapegoat-host.  It requires my participation, which is why people who simply won't be bullied because of their same-sex affectional orientation infuriates them.  Their cancer can only work in an atmosphere of self-hatred.  Ironically, their attempts to "shine the light" on our so-called depravity end up shining the light on their delusions which then have to keep mutating into other forms in order to survive.  The uncle in Savage's column pointed to gay men and colostomy bags, trying of course to link anal sex with disease.  Brilliant in its own fashion, but more revealing of this uncle guy.  One  abverfickt  individual to be sure.  Just one among many.    When I came out 22 years ago, my Dad said, "You know what happens to those people?  They get strung out on drugs, they sell their bodies and they get killed--that the future you want?"  I knew when I heard him say that, that he was in the grips of something really powerful.  And for him to say that to his own son, he had to be pretty far gone.  For my mother to say "We'll disown you because we love you, so you can leave with the clothes on your back," she must have really had a disease.  And the illness works in such a way that now my parents have no recollection of this happening.  Because they'd have to admit they were crazy, then wouldn't they?  Can't do that, oh no...  I guess what I ultimately want to say about the fellow whose uncle is off-the-deep-end (OTDE anyone?), is yes, let the fellow go, but it's not the nephew's fault.  He didn't cause homophobia, he can't cure it, and he can't control it.  In many cases it's eradicated by education, but in others that's only a bandaid.  Ultmately, the disease will isolate them.  It seeks an ever narrower world.

						   “Comfort food” and “taking our comfort” reminiscent of toilet paper, “comfortable shoes”, recliners, cushy chairs and sofas, fluffy beds, down parkas, comforters.  All this floofah fwaffing!  And yet we despise that fwafféd physique, except in the areas of the ass and the (maternal) breast.    ***  Aristotle counseled that the obese individual should strip down to their birthday suit and take the air of the city.  The patient should go naked in the agora, perhaps to shame the bastard into losing weight?  Is that the purpose?  If thus, then “Aristotle” appears to be Greek for “prescriptive, smug-ass, know-it-all, vicious cuntface.”  ***  O. B. City:  As with other addictions, it is a family disease.  I am the alcoholic, compulsive eating son of a drinking dad and an eating mother.  The food and the booze were there to cure our familial structure of the need to isolate, to defy our human instinct for closeness, intimacy, simple human touch, to magnify our individual separations from one another behind that closed front door, as well as dividing our family from the rest of humanity.  As we tried to participate in the world outside the front door, the fat members of the family not only were constantly reminded that something was wrong, were constant reminders in their physicality that something was amiss, so too were the Height-Weight-Proportionate members of the family.  They were as fully implicated, if only to offer contrast, and were just as suspect as being the source of the illness as were we fatties.  ***  A social disease, O. B. City, perhaps borne by food itself as it has been altered, distorted, reduced, fortified, futzed with, tampered with to be more “attractive” to “consumers” as the corp(se)orations cut nutrition for efficiency, costs for profit and humanity in general because it just isn’t “sleek”, “lean” or “cool as death itself, dude.”  Fat people exists because human bodies are not getting the right nutrition from these “foods” which are nonsensical, non-nutritive and highly caloric and addictive; because profits also extend to the medical and pharmaceutical industries as well as Jenny Craig and the like; and because the leanness and meanness that the civilized wish to cultivate is never the whole of the story.  That which is “cut-out” doesn’t disappear—it gets hidden, in this case in plain sight, and in proliferation.  O. B. City becomes ever bigger, especially as the classes divide and the poorer classes “eat up” the “food” foisted upon them by their socioeconomic superiors.  O. B. City — the end-result of colonialism by dietary means.

						   I'll have a long post coming in the near future, I hope regarding an amends I need to make to this ol' country I live in.  I was working on it and I realized I need to run it by a few people first before I actually publish it.  The 9th Step of AA's 12 Steps reads "Made direct amends to such people [as we have harmed], except when to do so would injure them or others."  I have a lot of confusions regarding America and Americans on the one hand, and my July 4th born Daddles on the other.  That is what I owe an amends for, but the actual details I need to refine and make sure I'm taking responsibility for my own actions rather than adding more unnecessary pain to the mix.    My sense is that there are a lot of people in a similar boat to mine, though perhaps not as shrouded in alcoholic "logic."  We all probably know people whose political passions obscure their vision of what is of value in others of different ideas.  We all have a little bit of the reactionary and the radical inside us--that oceanically violent urge "to kill them all and let God sort 'em out" idea.  That sort of indiscriminate view excuses way too much in ourselves to be justified.  That sort of thinking I must dispense with and take each person as they come.  Understand that each person has a lesson for me.  But more to come on this later...

						   Welcome to The Disappearing Chef, a blog about food and stuff!    One thing I didn't say in my profile which I will probably edit at some future date:  I used to be 297 pounds at my top weight in January 2003, and am now a very proud 183!  I have been maintaining this weight loss for 10 months now.  During the course of that time, I discovered that food really does have healing properties, so I'll be posting a lot about my observations of living a sugar- and flour-free life.  That's right!  I've not knowingly eaten any product where broken white powders were among the first five ingredients.  I didn't do this alone, and it's required a huge amount of surrender.  I needed to hit bottom first.  One day I told a room full of friends that I imagined myself dead.  I wasn't sure how I was going to get there, but I saw myself in the casket and mourners filing by saying "Oh, Richard I'm so sorry, I hope you're in a better place," etc.  I was tired of hauling my overweight body around everywhere, feeling it in every joint and pushing my lungs and heart to the limit.  Climbing a flight of stairs gave me shortness of breath, and forget attracting any boyfriends!    So I was ready to surrender.  This is one thing I'll be writing posts about.  Another thing is life after civilization.  For the time being, I subscribe to the ideas of Daniel Quinn of  Ishmael  fame.  The idea that our totalitarian-agriculture-based society hasn't worked and furthermore never really worked the way we thought it should.  Personally, I feel in my gut that the first person who decided to lock up the food so the rest of humanity would work for her was most likely a flour addict.  So much of what I see as civilization's dementia looks like addiction to me.  In fact, I've toyed with the idea that perhaps addiction is a synonym for civilization itself, at least as Quinn eloquently describes in his books.  (The most successful of his is  Beyond Civilization  IMHO.)  So I'll be posting about this as well.  That can't help but raise a whole host of other issues--religion, spirituality, politics, etc.  There's a lot of other stuff out there I will probably link to as well, but one thing at a time--I need to learn how to operate this system.  And resist the temptation to post every little idea that comes into my head.  One other area I will hope to publish observations about from time to time is the area of critical thinking.  I'm not talking about strictly logic here, though folks.  Critical Thinking is a whole-brain approach.  The gut is involved in the process too, as are emotions.  I'm going from Stephen Brookfield's understanding of the concept.  A merely logical approach leaves me feeling undernourished.  With merely using logic, it's like I'm looking for Thanksgiving Dinner and all I'm getting is the half cup of potato with a teaspoon of butter.  I want the turkey and the veggies and a bit of squapple pudding (my recipe which I will share at a future date), not to mention the nuts and the dressing.    There's more to be sure.  My interests are a moving target.  I would have never guessed I'd be fascinated by the Mayan Calendar and all things Mayan.  I've been writing plays for about 25 years now, and since reading about this Mesoamerican culture I've discovered that in many ways some Mayan wisdom and words are coming through my pen.  In a few weeks time I might be on to something else.  I need to treat as an experiment.  I don't actually know all of what I will be posting, though I am always having ideas about things that I don't necessarily share.  It's difficult for me sometimes too because I work the night shift.  Night Shift people are very different from "Day People."  For one thing, we have to be a lot more independent.  Very few of us on this shift are not self-starters.  I can only speak for myself on this score, however--I have an ambivalent relationship to isolation and solitude.  I work at a job where we don't have to isolate, but I sense that many of us sort of fall into a sense that the cubicles we sit at have closed doors if on an imaginal level.    So anyway, that's it for the moment.  I may post something even later today.  I've noticed that people do that.  My inspirations for now come from Talking Points Memo, Gay Spirituality and other political, spiritual and astrological blogs.  Who knows where this will go?  So.  This is just a beginning.

						   These days I feel a bit at sea.&nbsp; I feel like I should be doing something, yet all I want to do mostly is sleep.&nbsp; Partly this is due to the Grand Jury duty I've volunteered for, and that time-shift of which I spoke.&nbsp; But I've been feeling this at-sea condition for awhile now.&nbsp;   I've been musing about what actions, if any, I could be taking right now.&nbsp; I could be seeking more ways to have fun.&nbsp; I could be seeking a new line of work.&nbsp; I could be seriously acting upon my wishes to live in a smaller city, or even somewhere outlandish like North Dakota.&nbsp; I could be doing a lot of things.&nbsp; But nothing feels absolutely right.  I do&nbsp;ask my dreams for guidance.&nbsp; Today I dreamt I wanted to get permission from some people I know in my various programs to commit suicide due to powerless rage.&nbsp; (Josh Marshall on TPM wrote that in 2002 the Democrats were enraged, because they felt powerless.&nbsp; Today, they're angry but not enraged, because they see they have power.&nbsp; Guess that idea permeated to the bottom of my consciousness!)&nbsp; The two people I talked with were non-committal about the idea.&nbsp;   Even though I'm feeling "lost"--and I put it in quotes because it feels right--I don't really feel the need to do anything about it at this point.&nbsp; It's uncomfortable and all, but so far I just don't see the need to simply take any old action just to do it.&nbsp; There are a couple of actions I'm contemplating, but they are for once I've started my ninth step or for the fall, which I always feel is&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;beginning.&nbsp; I'm curious to see how I shall feel once we pass 15-degrees of Leo, around August&nbsp;5 or so, for that is spiritually the beginning of&nbsp;fall.&nbsp; Lammas/Lughnasadh is this coming&nbsp;Sunday and is the celebration of the first harvest.&nbsp; The Equinox will&nbsp;be only 6 short weeks from thence.&nbsp; Last year, I felt some sort of excitement for fall kindle in me in August.&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to start eating fall foods then--squash, apples, turkey, etc.&nbsp; I bet I shall feel the same sort of energy again.  For now, the thing that is keeping me tethered is trying to listen for Gaia/Sol's will for me.&nbsp; It requires I spend time with the grass and the trees, which I've not been doing as much due to G.J. duty.&nbsp; I did talk to the trees in a park across the street from 100 Centre Street the other day, though.&nbsp; Felt good.&nbsp; That's one thing I'm not lost about, is that nature is to be more central to my life.&nbsp; It's just how do I bring that center and what do I do with all the other stuff I'm required to do to survive in this necrivilization?&nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   Since having lost a significant amount of weight, there are days when I feel trim, there are days when I feel "fat"--which is really more about what's in my head and some residue of low self-esteem--and then there are days like today, when I feel "soft" of belly and tone.  I walk a lot, and I carry a lot of stuff.&nbsp; For being a forty year-old man I am pretty fit, but I could be moreso.&nbsp; I'm wearing a pair of pants that feels a bit tight for allegedly being size 34.&nbsp; I have a size 32 pair of jeans that frequently feels loose on me, and when I wear my belt with it, I attach the fastener to the penultimate hole.&nbsp; On this pair of pants, even the last hole makes it rather loose.&nbsp; Wearing this enigmatic pair, I can't help but feel a little soft, and it reminds me of the days when I was wearing size 48's and my belly hung over them.&nbsp;   I look in the mirror at my body these days, and I see an guy who's pretty average-looking for my age.&nbsp; Or was average-looking at one time--I think the average now is someone who has maybe 35 pounds on me.&nbsp; I might be wrong about that, but I think I'm at least average for New York City, which is a relief.&nbsp; I walked past a couple of hot gay men who looked to be in their mid-30s--maybe one of them was my age!&nbsp; I know a couple of vain men in their 40s who look fairly well-preserved.&nbsp; I know of others who chase after chicken.&nbsp; (Whatever...)  I could be doing more for my body, I know.&nbsp; I saw a factoid today on the elevator that it's a good idea when flying from one place to another, to workout when you land.&nbsp; It helps to relieve the jet lag.&nbsp; I bet that it would help someone like me too, who goes on extended periods of jet-lag when I switch my schedule around.&nbsp; Like now, with my work and jury duties, I've had to shift my schedule back an hour.&nbsp; I'm not grumbling about it at all!&nbsp; I like the extra hour of sunlight, actually.&nbsp; It's nice to see 1:30 in the afternoon once in a blue moon.&nbsp; (Literally, actually, as the blue moon is this Saturday night!)&nbsp; But I'm so tired all the time because of this seemingly&nbsp;small shift.&nbsp; As far as time goes, I'm princess and that hour is the pea in my bed.&nbsp; So for the next few days I'll be draggy, and I don't like it.  So.&nbsp; The sleepiness, the tightish pants, the lack of exercise--they all combine to render my mental state as registering of physical softness as opposed to overweight.&nbsp; The belly and the chest are desirous of some vigorous exercise, I can tell.&nbsp; Something more vigorous than my walk down to Centre Street.&nbsp; Guess I'll have to suck up my complaining and carry that Trek down to the street and take it out for a spin soon.&nbsp; I owe it to my body and to my connection to Gaia to ride along the western perimeter of Manhattan.&nbsp; Connect with nature on my two-wheeler and give my lungs and belly and legs some aerobic respiration.

						   Right now I'm reading Gary Jennings's novel  Aztec , which makes for a fascinating read on the mysterious Mesoamerican civilization which participated in huge human sacrifices as part of their religion.&nbsp; With the structure that Jennings employs, I see an implicit critique of "civilizing factors" that play with the populace of a given region.&nbsp; Whether it's an Aztec civilizing method, a Maya one, or a Spanish one, it seems that the same devotion to creating an empire and enslaving as many people as possible follows the same trajectories no matter where civilization goes.&nbsp; And it creates similar kinds of craziness along the way, especially among the elite classes who walk around thinking they can do whatever they wish.&nbsp; All the elites are are thugs who have a bloodline to support.  As I read the novel, I feel a tremendous loss actually.&nbsp; There are all sorts of cultures that got lost in the mad dash to civilize.&nbsp; The Aztecs at least never tried to obliterate other cultures, only insisting that they pay tribute once they'd been properly dominated and once they'd taken enough prisoners for their bloodthirsty sacrifices.&nbsp;   All of us who have been civilized have ancestors from way, way back who were at one point indigenous to some area, whether it was in the Americas or Eurasia or Africa, or more rarely Australia or Pacific/Indian/Atlantic islands.&nbsp; If a person is a white or Asian or African-American then it's pretty much assumed that somewhere in the Eastern hemisphere is our ancestral home, but if you're like me, you must have more than a couple.&nbsp; I'm part Swede, Italian, French, English, Scot and Irish.&nbsp; For all I know, my ancestors could also include Russian or Slovene or Basque people or what have you.&nbsp; Civilization has flattened us all into cutouts.&nbsp; From civilization's point-of-view, most of us are interchangeable.&nbsp; Actually, all of us are, just that some are interchangeable at a higher level or a lower level.&nbsp; Rarely do people cross across the chasm of class anymore, though the hero of  Aztec  is just such a fellow.&nbsp; He's got a fascinating and rich history to draw from.&nbsp; But he is a Cassandra sort of figure, one who is doomed to be a truthteller and whose ability to see things as they are, up close and without judgment, will bring him to a fate easily foretold.&nbsp; (Maybe that's not fair--I checked out the blurb for the second of Jennings's Aztec books, I know Mixtli will be executed at the end of this one.&nbsp; However, I think Jennings sets up the expectation fairly well.)  The seductiveness of civilization as we know it is difficult to pass up.&nbsp; Mixtli judges a lot of the tribes he encounters through that lens, especially the Maya who at one point knew the glory of a former day.&nbsp; There is no record of what happened to the Maya--they just disappeared.&nbsp; Daniel Quinn hypothesizes they just walked back into the jungle, that they decided civilization was a fool's errand.&nbsp; A friend of mine who studied anthropology said there would be some sort of record of that in what they left behind.&nbsp; Even though this is the case, I'm intrigued by the idea that the Maya might have just decided "Feh!&nbsp; Let's get out of here and go dance with the monkeys!"&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;   Still the seductiveness of civilization doesn't adequately cover for the wounds we've all suffered to become civilized (synonyms: domesticated, socialized, addicted, insane).&nbsp; On my way in to work tonight, I was musing that all Americans are de facto qualifiers for Al-Anon because of the man sitting in the Oval Office.&nbsp; Because of the dry-drunk pResident of the quickly Unraveling States of Addiction, we can all legitimately claim to be members of Al-Anon because it only requires there be a problem of alcoholism/addiction in a relative or loved one.&nbsp; Now, I'm being molto generous with describing Arbusto as a "loved one", but because we are all enjoined to be in relation to the psychic vampire (or "cunt", rather-- the onomatopoetic/metonymic representation for bloodsuckers of all Republicunt striping), we can I think dispense with formalities.  Perhaps though, it would be better to create a new fellowship to address the deeper problem that is our notion of civilization.&nbsp; I admit I'm powerless over civilization, and that my life has become unmanageable, and I dream that Gaia and Sol and the Space-Between will deliver me from its grasping and necrotizing claws.&nbsp; I can make the decision to turn my will and my life over to Gaia and Sol and trust they will lead me out of civilization into a new freedom and a new happiness.&nbsp; I can take my moral inventory and own up to it and admit my civilized character defenses and acquire new behaviors that will put me on the path toward living a life that is constant prayer and meditation.&nbsp; I choose today not to take things personally, as much as I am tempted down that path.&nbsp; Please let me put my energies toward scaling the wall and getting beyond "toxivilizaton." ("Toxevilization" anyone?)

						   Years ago, my friend Peggy gave me a Superman T-shirt for my birthday.&nbsp; I thrill when I wear it, but I sometimes forget I have an odd sort of responsibility when I don the azure shirt with flaming-red S over yellow field up-front-center.  Tonight as I was coming to work, I needed to duck into an ATM and get some money.&nbsp; It being Saturday night, there are a lot of inebriates out and about.&nbsp; ("Amateur night.")&nbsp; Well, these four dudes pounded on the ATM kiosk as I was withdrawing money and they were all pretty well in-spirited.&nbsp; They were all sort of cheering me on in wearing my shirt, which never fails to catch me off guard.&nbsp; Even when I want the attention, I still expect to be ignored.&nbsp; So I was a beat behind tonight when these guys were showing their approval.&nbsp; One guy hung around to make sure I got it, and I gave him the thumbs up, but I was kind of distracted too, what with getting my money and being visible, getting my money.&nbsp; Something that we all have to do and I sort of expect privacy as I'm sure most others do.&nbsp; But drinkers being drinkers, it's all about them, so I had to pay Dionysus what was Dionysus's as it were.&nbsp;   The funny thing was that after I got my money, I couldn't get out of the ATM kiosk area.&nbsp; I kept hitting that button to exit, but it was inoperable I guess.&nbsp; I had to wait for the next ATM customer to rescue me.&nbsp; (Hilarious.&nbsp; A man in a Superman T needs to be delivered from the clutches of Washington Mutual.&nbsp; Damn that Lex Lucre!)&nbsp;   As I continued on to work, I pondered this responsibility of wearing the t-shirt.&nbsp; I decided to wear this one specifically tonight.&nbsp; I wondered whether I was really up to the task.&nbsp; This week I've been doing the Grand Jury.&nbsp; I'm the foreman and I get to swear the witnesses in.&nbsp; (It can be interesting, but we basically get the same kind of cases again and again.&nbsp; If there weren't any drug laws, we would have almost nothing to do.&nbsp; Guess that applies to the ADAs and the Judges too, eh?)&nbsp; When it comes to deliberation, I'm Argument Traffic Control, making sure everyone gets their say and that any confusions are addressed, at least as we can address them.&nbsp; And the fact is, it's service to my fellow citizens, pure and simple.&nbsp; I'm getting a small stipend for doing this, but nothing major.&nbsp; It will give me a nice little check come late September/early October, right when I'll need it too.&nbsp; I see that Gaia/Sol is watching out for me.&nbsp;   My momentary insecurity led me down a somewhat sad path.&nbsp; I'm someone who can wear this Superman T with confidence and grace.&nbsp; But for a couple of moments there I was Mr. Unsure, not because of anything specific other than my general low self-regard.&nbsp; It's a tonic for me to wear this t-shirt, especially when I own it as true to my soul and spirit.&nbsp; It can be an ego trip to wear it, but sometimes it's about recognizing some truths about myself.&nbsp; It's in that spirit that I wear this shirt this evening.

						   The other day I decided to try something.&nbsp; I don't know what to call this, maybe  Orange Unlovely , because it didn't look all that appetizing.  Ingredients: 4 oz. ricotta cheese 2 eggs 1 cup butternut squash 1 cup cooked millet (with 1 packet of Splenda and apple pie spice) 1 cup shredded carrots 2 T walnuts 2 tsp butter 1 apple, diced 1 tsp Atkins sugar-free vanilla syrup 1 tsp sugar-free maple syrup  Preheat oven to 350.&nbsp; Use butter to grease the baking dish.&nbsp; Mix ricotta with the syrups, squash and spices.&nbsp; In a separate bowl whip the eggs, then fold into the ricotta-squash mixture.&nbsp; Fold in the carrots and apples.&nbsp; Sprinkle walnuts on top.&nbsp; Bake for 45 minutes.&nbsp; Then let cool.  ***  I did this the other day, and it satisfied me, but I got impatient.&nbsp; I took it out of the oven at about a half an hour.&nbsp; Don't think it would have changed the taste any, but there you are.  2 proteins 2 grain 2 vegetable 1 fruit 4 fats

						   This one's a bit longer, entitled "The 'Enemy'".  Will be coming soon.  I'm on Grand Jury Duty this MONTH--yes, for four fun-filled weeks, I get to do some civil service.  Not only that but I'm the Foreman!  Uffly-funzel-funz it is.  But in my off-time I do try to write this poem.  13 line stanzas of iambic pentameter kinda.  Interesting structure, sort of riffing oddly on the Mayan Calendar with its 260 sign-tone combinations.  More to come. 

						   Perhaps it's a function of having turned 40, but I  really  appreciate quiet moments these days.&nbsp; As I (hand-)write these words at a nearby cafe, for the moment I wrinkle my nose at the non-stop sonic disturbance piping out of the PA system.&nbsp; Not only does this cafe play music, but they also have TV monitors with the dialogue-crawl streaming their visual noise at the clientele.&nbsp; Tonight, in the coffee-bar area they have on a baseball game, but in the lounge proper, it's a dreadful-looking reality program, evidently some sort of postmodern-gamey riff on Paris and the Golden Apple.&nbsp; (Paris as a blond girl with three Gods vying for her apples, as it were.)  &nbsp;  It's not that I despise music per se.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, but I do live in jangly Manhattan where silence feels comparatively rare.&nbsp; Even in my apartment, which sits behind the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe.&nbsp; Lots of nights there's a raucous crowd noisily hooting and hollering, not to mention the rather tony building next door to it with its barbecues and dinner parties in the courtyard below and the rooftop above, I'm sure.&nbsp; I'm sure that, were I to be living in a less hectic place, be it rural, suburban or just less urban, I would complain that there was not enough distraction around to keep the internal noise from drowning my focus on the now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm frequently guilty for wanting what I don't have and not wanting what I do.  &nbsp;   So. &nbsp; When I think about it from that perspective, I can remember a new tool I have at my disposal.&nbsp; It's not really new, it's just one I have to prod myself or be prodded to employ.&nbsp; Just waking up to the beauty of the current moment.&nbsp; At the moment I wrote these words (not to be confused with the joyous moments of typing them), I also remember that within the sounds I'm hearing there is silence.&nbsp; Without the silence I wouldn't be able to hear the sound, much like it's all the other colors in the spectrum that allow me to see red.&nbsp; Were red present, then I'm either seeing a monochrome or another color entirely.&nbsp; As to sound, there's a 1011010010 binary sort of vibration going to create sonic "language."  &nbsp;  Even here I can remember a sonic silence or envision a cone of silence surrounding me if that will help.&nbsp; Just because there's sonic interference doesn't mean I have to acquiesce to&nbsp;unfocused haplessness.&nbsp; All of a sudden I feel a sadness and a compassion for, of all things, the Iraqis experiencing American occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I don't personally wish to own what we are doing there, I have to acknowledge my complicity and own that I have some tiny impact in all this ugliness.  &nbsp;  We-the-Americans are dominating these people in their own country due to our own petro-addiction.&nbsp; We are behaving like any old drug-addled&nbsp;kingpin who muscles in on the territories&nbsp;where his product can best be grown.&nbsp; We convince ourselves of some noble motive in it all, or rather we spin some noble motive to disguise what everyone&nbsp;else knows about our&nbsp;behaviors, but&nbsp;to which&nbsp;we pathetically&nbsp;have not collectively awakened.&nbsp; As we lock up the cab-drivers, the farmers, the clerks, as we shoot the doctors and lawyers and journalists, we desperately dance around looking at our thuggish, junky behavior and instead spill our contempt on these unfortunately weaker stooges who have the temerity to have what we feel we are entitled to.&nbsp; So of course we must rescue them from themselves for Xtianity, etc.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We convince ourselves of our own humanity as we sodomize children and rape mothers and daughters.&nbsp; It's their fault we're so awful to them.&nbsp; As our addict-logic speaketh:&nbsp; they need us, you see, because we are so much better than they are, and even though they deserve our contempt, we are here to set things right and share our glorious-Jesus-ness with them.&nbsp; And while we're here, let's help ourselves to their resources, because of course it's only fitting.&nbsp; (Wipe nose, excuse self, go to bathroom, snort/puke/get our fix however, return as if nothing ever happened.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We are still in finger-pointing drunken mode,&nbsp;blatantly and&nbsp;extravagantly ignoring those three digits pointing us-ward in favor of that externally wagging index finger.&nbsp; Some factions in the country are working to cut us off from our addiction.&nbsp; They've achieved some success, and probably will win that war of wills if only because it's not our land.&nbsp; Not that's stopped us from trying before, or as I can see thus far, into the future.&nbsp; I feel still that enough people have understood that we are collectively "at-bottom" but we still haven't moved toward the acknowledgement that we need help.&nbsp; As I see the compassion for the victims, I start to become aware of compassion for the victimizers as well.&nbsp; I forget who it was who said that our civilization is as much a prison for the CEO as for the convict.&nbsp; The CEO may get to wear a more resplendent prison-uni and sleep in nicer cellblocks, but they are as much imprisoned as anyone in Sing Sing.&nbsp; From this perspective, the Iraq&nbsp;war was inevitable.&nbsp; And other wars may also be fought in the future,&nbsp;in Iran, some of the -stans of Asia, Venezuela, Africa and (gulp!) perhaps Russia and China too.&nbsp; Unsober, but there we are.  &nbsp;  Writing these words I feel a bit brave and a bit ridiculous.&nbsp; A bit afraid, not so much of the consequences as much as that I'm letting others see into my soul.&nbsp; It was fun to write the contemptuous "Amerilemic" (American/bulemic zusammengefuckt)&nbsp;, but&nbsp;I feel I'm allowing anyone who reads these words to see what my thinking/feeling processes are.&nbsp; And this is somewhat scary because in 'Merka, this letting others see how I think and feel is perceived as femme, and we don't want that now, do we?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yet the victimizers I feel compassion for are primarily white, het men, and anyone can see they are in desperate need of lovingkindness and a firm, but gentle hand offering structure.&nbsp; Focused attention.&nbsp; I recognize that fellows carry their prinsons with them, but they've gone ahead and decorated their cells without acknowledging the nature of their shackles.&nbsp; They've put up their posters of sportscars and nymphets, they've plastered their fantasies all over their circumscribed realities and proceed bravely and recklessly forward.&nbsp; I can empathize with the attempts at denying realities blind-sides that constantly loop backwards toward them like boomerangs each time they fling the dad-blasted varmints away from them.&nbsp; And they bring friends with them too!&nbsp; Sheesh!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I can empathize because I recognize my own struggle with food in the same terms.&nbsp; Reality kept trying to get my attention--the constant depression, the sugar-related headaches, the rickety bones underneath all that excess weight, the invisibility around the guys I wanted, the constant blather that I-am-an-unworthy-loser due to all that fat.&nbsp; And yet there was that part of me that felt I was drop-dead gorgeous and why didn't anyone see it?&nbsp; It wasn't until I had that really deep, dark binge in December 2002 when I imagined myself dead and at my own funeral with people filing by and saying "Oh, Richard, what&nbsp;a waste.&nbsp; I hope your suffering has ended anyway"&nbsp;when I finally acknowledged I needed help and that there was no shame in asking for the help I needed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As I awakened to the true costs of my affliction, I got such a gift of clarity and the even more potent gift of surrender.&nbsp; And now I've awakened to even more costs that I find unacceptable.&nbsp; &nbsp;  And I am bit in shock as to the scope of this statement.&nbsp; I can't force even one other person&nbsp;to recover from their various and sundry addictions, much less a&nbsp;nation in power-drunk freefall.&nbsp; It's part of my own addictive nature to say "See, I'm right and you just have to get with the program."&nbsp; But paradoxically, that would not be "working my own program."&nbsp; Like others I have to turn that index finger back toward myself and merely witness the misery the nation puts itself through and keep a detached perspective and a readiness to act.&nbsp; Perhaps other Americans (and British and French and Brazilians and others) will join me in starting a "Civilization Anonymous" sort of 12-Step-based fellowship where we all address the socialization wounds that created that hole inside us in the first place.&nbsp; Something like that where anyone can come in and through the gift of anonymity, gently expose their shadows for positive transformation.&nbsp; Only by my own experience of pointing all the fingers at myself and not so much finding "answers" as intuitions and insights into the current moment can I really be of service to others, and through the dialogue between the internal and the external.&nbsp; Because I do find my soul in relationship to others, and I know that the addict way is not for me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; All that happens is that I end up alone, which makes it hard to cuddle and be cuddled.

						   I have contemplated the possibility of moving to where my folks live in North Dakota.&nbsp; Right now I won't be doing so, for many reasons.&nbsp; Last year, when I started to put together that there were&nbsp;a bazillion&nbsp;"Richards" living alongside one another, that the five year-old Richard was very different from the 8-, the 15-, the 23-, the 35- and even the 39-year old Richards, I entertained the notion of moving to NoDak.&nbsp; Kathleen Norris has written a beautiful book called  Dakota: A Spiritual Geography  which I duly read.&nbsp; I got myself a CD by Philip Aaberg called "High Plains" (I'm listening to "Montana Half-Light" as I type this!) and I viewed and reviewed  Big Eden , all of which don't directly reflect where my folks live. &nbsp; The Dakotas really should be divided East and West, rather than North/South.&nbsp; The regions that are closer to the Mississippi have more in common with each other (Rapid City/Fargo/Grand Forks) than they do with the wasteland further west toward Montana.&nbsp; Norris's book is really more about that part of the state.&nbsp; My folks live in a town that splits the difference.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As a gay fellow, the Midwest doth scare me  sehr .&nbsp; I want to believe that homophobia has little place there, but as I listened to the director's commentary about shooting  Big Eden , when he talked about seeking out a church to shoot some of the church scenes and was repeatedly asked about his gay protag "Well, is he saved?", I recognized my fears as being legitimate.&nbsp; They were reconfirmed in reading Thomas Frank's  What's the Matter with Kansas? &nbsp;as well.&nbsp; For all I know, Mr. Right cuts a mean two-step in Jamestown or Rolla, but it seems a bit extreme for me to ditch New York City for points centrally unknown.&nbsp; I'm contemplating a relocation to the Albany, New York area instead, but for the time being, I've also awakened to the beauty that exists in Manhattan.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Yet, there is something in the 'Dwest that does draw me.&nbsp; In reading about the history of Kansas, there were quite a few people who managed to combine their Xtianity with leftist politics.&nbsp; There really was a radical notion of what it meant to be a citizen and a member of a community.&nbsp; Wm. Jennings Bryan may have made a fool of himself over evolution, but he drove home quite a few points for the itinerant farmers and lowly workers at the turn of the century.&nbsp; I guess the big problem I have with people who wear their faith on their lapels is more that they don't seem to have a sense of things being "both-and," insisting that they are "either-or."&nbsp; It doesn't occur to them that being both secular and spiritual is perhaps the most satisfying and optimal way to go. &nbsp; As I get older, I'm naturally drawn to things spiritual, but still needing to tease out the religious from that much larger stream.&nbsp; When I hear someone describe themselves as "a spiritual person" I brace myself.&nbsp; It's easy to talk spirituality, and I have been guilty of a just-talkin' poseur sort of faux-spirituality myself.&nbsp; I still do it, actually.&nbsp; Many of my interests in shamanism, divination practices, multi-dimensionality and the like right now feel like dilletantism for the time being.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Robert Sardello and others talk of "weekend shamanism" for example, with great disdain.&nbsp; I don't think of myself as a weekend-shaman sort of guy, but I do see that there is so much more to spirituality than meets the eye.&nbsp; Especially when I come across blogs such as  urlLink http://gayspirituality.typepad.com/blog/ .&nbsp; I log into this one every once in awhile, among others.&nbsp; I am awakening to the notion that I need to turn my life into a never-ending prayer.&nbsp; The problem is I feel like I'm asleep half the time, and furthermore that I'm encouraged to be a bystander in my own life by the somnolent people surrounding me.&nbsp; I hope I don't sound judgmental when I say that, but it's damn hard to wake up most of the time. &nbsp; I feel like a new energy is burbling up to the surface, and it's about time.&nbsp; Still, I do work this overnight shift and on the weekends to boot.&nbsp; It's been mildly busy here at work, but I still have some time to muse about what I'm writing here, rather than taking something from my koobeton and typing from my sometimes legible penmanship.&nbsp; And posting these "diary entries" seems to help me to put things into perspective a bit.&nbsp; Yesterday's "dreaming" post will probably undergo some revisions as I refine my vision and perhaps go to some Debtors' Anonymous Visions Meetings to address my fears as I wake up even more to the life I have about me.&nbsp; Perhaps I will end up in NoDak, or Albany, or maybe I'll just find a way to bring a country-spiritual sensibility to this city-secular locale.&nbsp; There is gay square-dancing in NYC, not to mention the Manhattan Mustangs' country-western galas 4 times a year. &nbsp; Many things are possible...

						   Let me dream a bit here… (On UPDATE:&nbsp; I changed a word below--it used to read "I want a life".&nbsp; I changed it because in order for the intention to work, I need to make the tense  as if it were already so .&nbsp; Accidentally, I created this during an "Opportunity Period"--a void of course Moon in a sign the moon likes to be in, that is also a New Moon before a Blue Moon.&nbsp; Convoluted, but let's see how this woiks!&nbsp; Also, I added one other element to this.&nbsp;I put it in a different color.&nbsp;     I  live  a life             where I can get up in the morning and work and play and be responsible and responsive to others and go to bed at night;   where it is a joy to do my chores;   where I can express my talents and find satisfaction, recognition, recompense;   where creativity and artistic expression are expected;   where I can be a part of a community and give deeply of myself without feeling easily spent;   where I can fall in love with a fellow and see our union be celebrated;   where I can create and maintain a spiritual family;   where I can commune with nature more;   where the smell of pine trees fills the air;   where there is a lake and a river nearby, and mountains;   where nature supplies for the community abundantly;   where people are not afraid of anything, least of all being wrong or asking questions;   where the people eat healthfully and addictions are treated with gentleness and kindness;   where the children can teach and the adults can relearn their true lessons;   where holidays are a communal affair and Gaia and the Sun are constantly invited and present, no matter what other deities are worshipped;   where it feels like it’s Christmas every day because gratitude is plentiful;   where forgiveness flows easy when mistakes weave their way into the social fabric;    where the community creates a space for individual and collective shadows&nbsp;to be&nbsp;brought into the light where they may be heard and therefore healed;   where I can learn Portuguese or Czech or Linear B if I want to and others will take an interest;   where everyone takes what they can from civilization and leaves the rest;   where nothing, not even business, interferes with the civic bottom line.          So Be It, Blesséd Be

						   The other day I was saying my prayers after getting up.&nbsp; I was saying the Third Step Prayer and I got to the line "Relieve me of the bondage of self that I may better do thy will."&nbsp; I thought to myself about what one of my sponsors said to me the day before, that I sounded like I was in self-pity. &nbsp; The interesting thing about these "self-" maladies is that they can pretty effectively mimic other feelings.&nbsp; I didn't realize this until I mused to myself about the "sadness" I was feeling.&nbsp; I asked myself the light-shining question, "Am I in self-pity right now?"&nbsp; And do you know that I felt the feeling of sadness evaporate?&nbsp; The so-called sadness relied on my keeping it in the dark, unreflected upon to maintain its obsessive nature.&nbsp; And when I asked that question, it disappeared like a boggart having been "Riddikulussed!"&nbsp;  &nbsp; What was remaining underneath the so-called sadness however was a legitimate feeling, that of undifferentiated fear.&nbsp; I am in a period where I see that in order to go forward toward whatever destiny Gaia-Sol wishes for me, I must delve into myself a little deeper and release some of these ancient grotesqueries that hang around feeding from bottom-falling dregs.&nbsp; It's not that it's a hard thing to do--just a bit painful and it takes my attention and it makes me tired.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing that it does all this, because I don't know if I could handle becoming "golden" all-of-a-piece.&nbsp; But still, I wish it could energize rather than enervate.&nbsp; Perhaps it will someday. &nbsp; So I have a new tool to use when I feel a listlessness coming on.&nbsp; In this case, I wrote yesterday about the Burner Periods, which I think have a relevance.&nbsp; They are timeframes around which I can plan.&nbsp; And it's during those periods in particular that the self-lighting tools will come most in handy.&nbsp;  &nbsp; My fears tell me I have to solve an "unsolvable" problem and I only have so much time to do it.&nbsp; But all of that is a lie.&nbsp; I am in a situation that could be improved, but I also choose to embrace where I'm at.&nbsp; I do wish for movement to take place in my life, and I open myself up to that on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp; And I have all the time in the world, for everything is all right right now. &nbsp;

						   The Mayan civilization left behind a calendar that holds many remarkable oddities.&nbsp; One of these is the notion of a "Burner Day," which is a phenomenon that can affect cultures, businesses, organizations, relationships and people.&nbsp; There are 4 "galactic" burner days that apply to everyone--4 Chicchan, 4 Eb, 4 Oc and 4 Ahau.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't remember when the last one was or when the next one will be, but I am experiencing my own personal burner-day today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; These Burner Days happen every 65 days--the Mayan  tzol'kin  calendar lasted 260 days--and so the last one took place 65 days ago.&nbsp; I vaguely remember that time--I had some potent dreams back then.&nbsp; I'm having potent dreams this go-around as well, and I've had a difficult time meditating.&nbsp; According to one Mesoamerican Astrology expert, the burner day's energy can be felt approximately 5 days before the actual burner, and I would imagine the after-effects last a day or two after.&nbsp; That's sort of how 6 Cib, the last one went with me.&nbsp; The next burner day will be my "Mayan birthday" 6 Cimi--6 Death, in other words.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It's good to know that this is part of what is going on.&nbsp; It only lasts five days or so, and it passes.&nbsp; I think there are things I can choose to do during this time.&nbsp; As I recall, this is a time for conforming with the cosmos.&nbsp; Asking what the cosmos needs, or what others around me would like from me, and conforming to their vision.&nbsp; Conforming to my own vision as well, but I'm in the hallway about that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing if my energy-levels improve in the next two or three days.&nbsp; (Just in time for jury-duty! O yea!) &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Made a startling realization today, that when I'm in a moment of "Oh, woe is me"--and lately, it doesn't take such an obvious form, but it has evolved into something much more sophisticated--I can dispel it by just asking myself "Am I pitying myself?"&nbsp; Just shining that  pregunta lucida  on the feeling makes it go away, or at least dwindle in its potency. &nbsp; An image came into my head actually, but  Spoiler Alert :&nbsp; In  Spiderman 2 , Doc Ock attaches those arms to himself and they get fused onto his body in a freak accident.&nbsp; But during that said accident, the chip that allows his "higher mind" to exert control over the arms bursts, and he's left at the mercy of the machinic logic.&nbsp; It isn't until the end of the film when he gets a chance to address this situation once Peter Parker confronts him.&nbsp; Well, it occurred to me as I was saying that wonderful antidote to self-anything--the Third Step prayer of AA--that the line "Relieve me of the bondage of self" is just like Doc Ock in that moment, receiving his moment of grace so that he can put his situation to rights.&nbsp; The reckless arms are that bondage to self, but we can be gently reminded that we have choices.&nbsp; And I can choose to shine the light on my self-pity.&nbsp; If it's really sadness, that will still be there.&nbsp; If it's not though, or if it's self-obsession or whininess ("The world is so unfair!") then that will disspate. &nbsp; If I ask that question and&nbsp;the feeling&nbsp;largely&nbsp;vanishes, then whatever it is I'm really feeling lies underneath.&nbsp; Today I realize I'm feeling afraid, not so much sad.&nbsp; Sadness and fear have frequently masked each other, but both hide fear underneath as well.&nbsp; I've been taking some baby-step risks in letting others into my life, and it's plenty scary.&nbsp; I don't like to be vulnerable, and I've been feeling really embarrassed and fearful because of this change in behavior. &nbsp; Part of my being of service to others however comes from this very vulnerability which I greatly fear.&nbsp; I like to think of myself "in control," which is pretty common all things considered.&nbsp; But still, the feelings of fear and discomfort do not make for a pleasant time right now. &nbsp; I've been telling others about my financial fears, about my situation regarding what "my real work" is--that I'm sort of spiritually and psychically back to who I was when I was five years old, and I "don't know what I want to be when I grow up."&nbsp; When I was deep, deep into the sugar and flour and other addictions, I desperately wanted to be a writer.&nbsp; I so wanted to see my name on the spine of a book, sandwiched between Mordecai and Moritake or whatever.&nbsp; But since I gained a whole new life from changing my life around, from making the most fundamental change I could possibly make, I'm not so obsessed with being a writer now.&nbsp; I feel it's a part of whatever mix I'll create in the future, but I don't think it needs to be as central as it has been.&nbsp; Of course this could change, but for today I understand that the writing element in my life has only been there during the course of my addiction, and I don't know whether it's solid or ephemeral. &nbsp; I wish for the life of me I could remember what I wanted, what I liked doing when I was five.&nbsp; What dreams I had.&nbsp; The intensity of the chocolate and sugary flavors I associate with my chubby childhood obliterated all that went before it, just by the sheer excess and "over-the-topness" of the taste-sensations I experienced, along with the emotional and physical roller-coasters I put myself through in those years.&nbsp; I don't know how relevant it is, knowing what I wanted to become and what I enjoyed doing before I was addicted.&nbsp; Still, I think it'd have some utility, if for no other reason than as a baseline.&nbsp; Of course, there might be other reasons why I can't remember from before age five.&nbsp; That's also possible.&nbsp; I still wonder who that boy was, and how different the 40-year-old man I am today is from him... &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Sometimes when I walk to work or when I'm by myself, I rehearse conversations with various sorts of belief-addicts.  Lately, I fantasize being on a Politically-Incorrect-type talkshow where there are a couple of entertainers and an "addictainer"--someone whose beliefs are so loopy that it's tacitly understood there's some brain-chemistry change that's happened.  I imagine myself being spindled by the addictainer in his or her projection of self-hatred, as the one who's "the problem."  And because I'm gay, because I have a spirituality that's more earth-centered, because I find my soul with others instead of in some individualized and nationalized spot somewhere in the vicinity of my aorta, I'm the easiest target.  The thing I notice about addictive thinking is how nicely it dovetails with soundbite-sized pieces.  An addictainer can spin a political ad-copy-writer into right-wing "enthusigasms" all right!  (I'm sure the same thing happens with left-wingers as well, but we have to wait to see that develop in the corporatist (as defined by Mussolini) USA.)  And I would actually see my goal in such a situation as to provide "bad television" because the medium itself is in the clutches of addictainment and I wish to continue on in my recovery.  (Sidebar:  I wonder what Robert Downey Jr. is doing these days, and I hope that he's seeking a way out of the entertainment industry.  It seems designed to continue the addictions in both its practitioners and the general populace, and if he's serious about his recovery, he'd find another line of work that agreed with him and his inner four-year-old.)  Television:  Our best thinking got us here, didn't it?  Pointless shouting matches with no redeeming value other than getting caught up in a political version of WWF-Smackdown?  I can't bring myself to watch TV much anymore.  I caught a bit of the Oscars and before that I caught a smattering when I took a vacation up in Albany, New York and stayed at the Ramada Inn.  Even there I only watched it to catch what was going on locally.  I caught snippets of Chicken-Noodle-News but it's so inane and sterile, it's like eating a box of twinkies.  I know it's an effective medium and all--for those people who don't or can't get their news from Internet sources, it provides a devastatingly all-encompassing blanket.  I know there are a lot of lazy-ass people out there who have no desire to form their own opinions, who freely lease out their head-space to all manner of authority figures only too willing to speak in their favor even as they act only in their own self-interest.  Part of me wonders though if television might not be rescued from the addictainers.  A couple of months ago I had this feeling that the nation had reached the tipping point, that enough people had finally developed an awareness about where we're headed.  The major question is whether or not there are enough people to take action and lead us forward into a greener, more vibrant and abundant future, or whether too many people are still inside their fear as yet, to take any action on their own and others' behalf.  In the lives of many addicts comes a moment of grace, where the opportunity of surrender presents itself.  Please Gaia, let there be enough people who have hit their political/economic/spiritual bottom to understand they have to start with their own sense of powerlessness to get anywhere.  For that is the ultimate power of the addictainers, that they appeal to the addictainment-consumers' helplessness and fantasies of power-over-others.  Ultimately it keeps people stuck, which is ostensibly where the addictainers and their corporatist allies are most comfortable keeping the rest of humanity.  People are waking up, but the next question is this:  Will you get out of bed now?

						   "Interior Glow-Smile, Ha!"  O fat boy exiting the all-night cafe: You glanced my way and I flinched inside, remembering.  I too know the white death paths of sculptpowder addiction.  Yesterday  un tin de biscuits Anglais  hovered in peripheral awareness all night at my 24-7 workplace, blinking sugar-flour morsel codes of fraughtness.  A glance their way:  Indeed, as sculpture  cada bizcocho , exquisite perfection, each one a serpentine ribbon I followed back before baking, to its pasty-powder origins not-yet ovened.  O fat boy, beguiled by the snakesome cords you have yet to experience the glory inside your aliment, your own conduit to the galactic goddess of your own understanding.  We experience a poverty of soulfulness, our ready-made, self-justified petri culture of the dead and dying.  We celebrate bleaching, party to the sounds of vacuity and cancer poppage.  I see in you the twilight fellow I held myself to be, hostage to malevolence itself.  Evil finds expression in surprising and indifferent modes, I'm afraid.  300 pounds, I thought myself fine.  O fat boy!  I see in your  saudade  my own self. I now inhabit the place of Mr. Unavailable-to-you, a painful prick of recognition punctures my consciousness for this poemful moment.  My own Gaia-conduit, the freeway to the Sun and my geosolar liaison position knows I have a lesson for you, although not a bedding rompful activity, touching other whole-cocked.  No, my lesson could be one of leading the way to your own Rosemary-Awareness Version. Salads carry a new belonging place, and I know walnuts seal up some cell wounds!  O fat boy!  I want you to know the not-fat self I see ensconced amid the lipid armor porous only to anger, sorrow, rejection. The glanced look I saw spoke of your clenching,  your tightly guarded, easily-wounded heart only too ready for self-abandonment before I sorry-punch you.  I've stood in your flip- flops, yearning after Chelsea bodies  sin  Chelsea tudes.  A life without refinement, orientation toward wholeness earthsome animates my days.  One wouldn't think it, I fit into this efflorescence, where Monstrous-redundance Modernism eclipses the effortless glory that are willows.  (At least to the untrained eye!)  Psychic vampires decunt our food, our environs, our interior spaces of real nutrition, until we put our chosen drugs aside. Discover the Interior Smile Glow, o fat boy!  Know that echoing unearned gladness a-ringing in your guts!  *****  "Summer Paradox" (StairStepStanza Poem)  Cock Fire Want Wet Ick Sigh Need Sad Drought  Jully and I scope men in shorts sandals ankles cute feet stud legs honest.  I hunger think of sex pheromone all that sweat liquid goo stickiness congealing why bother? I wonder  Look at the men think of fucking doesn't compute some odd reason I do desire crave manly touch but the damn heat discourages me from sharing skin.  I want a fellow imagined passion in my head autumn fantasies playing September idylls not July hothouse oppressive linens strangling and stifling burgeoning desire  Do I then put it off, my lustiness, my need? I mean, it's been five years! (Another summer manmate Last time I opened sheets a winsome, willing guy.) Attracted by odd jaws, a torn pant-leg, showing fleshy kneecap, startle...  Enter into the chaso I must instead plunge right in ride my desire, encounter someone else's mapped passions real congruence or in-, discover an alignment or more on to the the next guy Perspiration no factor in this business of getting laid.  *****  "Disposable Pen"  Hart do believe the instrument in my hand a toxic remnant for the future.  It's so pretty too, this golden shaft, see-thru the ink in the inside straw.  When I'm done with it, I'll set it free to the trash where it will sit,  neither decaying nor sitting still really. Eventually something will bust it.  Smaller half-lives scheming their way through time, a lifeless eternal present.  What it must be like  to contain isotopes.  Zombicus nuclearis .  Ethyly deathel-death Bat man Bat Man Now it means something...  *****  "On Reading Wallace Stevens #1"  Words mean a lot to me Some people's pens envy inside kindles, a verdant fire to eclipse the messenger of compared despair.  This guy worked for THE MAN! This guy wore a suit to work and did THE MAN's soiled grease-bidding abstracted at that aerie of course.  He could write poems, good ones. God said Hitler went to heaven. Others cut off their dicks to declaim their worthiness.  What a world.  *****  "Odessa 5:15 a.m., a day in June"  I walked past a gaggle of pain on my way to brinner at the Ukrainian diner.  A congregation of goths draped their wraithiness over a PT Cruiser. Some bouncers and barkeeps started their shopclosings as two young men, high on blankfill guffawed as one flung some flimxy car part across four parkeds.  The Arab graveyard shift guy at Ben's spoke nervously in Arabic on a cell as he rang up my cashews, a dollar-nineteen.  On Avenue A, the sorrow continued. Addled homeless guy asked me for "food." (Maybe he was hungry, maybe it would burnish my karma to hand him some munz, but I could have rather gone into Key Food and bought him some protein and a package of carrots if I'd know he'd take it. I don't trek down that pat 5a.m., however.) One woman hovered over her unconscious boyfriend sprawled in front of Opaline. Various toughs and their boyfriends powered their panties to more private sprees.  In the diner, another set of characters extend a continuous drama.  Nightfolks nourishing themselves for wherever their days will take them.  A fourspot of johns, pros sitwith pancakes-- one loudly and proudly-in-pink proclaiming "We were not arrested, only booked!" Across the aisle from me, a guy I know who struggles, sits with other inebriates pondering salt versus sugar.  Sense he won't acknowledge me, that for now I'm a ghost of his booze-moment.  I don't mind this willful disregard of my presence.  Not here to judge.  Awake to the sadness permeating, I wonder about my own isolate status. Other than my meetings with other addicts, sponsors and fellows, I've spent all my nights singly.  Tuesday morning, two gents crossed my path and one amoured his hello in my colpid direction.  My skittery "hi" fled into false headwinds, farted with vulnerability's fear. I ponder my list of others harmed, teh Scorpio Step before Sagittarius amends and my despair over reinserting myself into relations with others, transforming carnival glass phantasy thinking.

						   I don't think it's just me.  I sense there are a lot of TIRED people out there, who know that this is merely the preparation for whatever is coming next.  I for one don't believe that we are headed toward Armageddon.  I saw on a couple of "woo-woo" websites that "Apocalypse" merely means "Lifting the veil."  With all the news that comes down to us, both official and un-, we are daily witnessing new apocalypse.  I need to take the opportunity to dream a little here.  I am no longer excited by a lot of the things I used to find thrilling.  I don't think it's because I'm getting older that these former interests and "got-to's" are falling away.  Watching my addictions fall away one by one, I wake up to my essential magnificence, the same essence that we all partake in.  I see many suffering people, but I also see others who aren't suffering so much, who seem to have a certain serenity about them.  Not only do I want what they have, but I feel I'm manifesting what they have.  Right here, right now.  An energy of loving vibrance exists underneath the surface, but it's reconfiguring my brain and my body.  Some argue that it's actually triggering the vast majority of my DNA that is unused, that scientists have labeled "junk," because they don't know why it's there.  Frequently, when I log into Excite, my fortune says "You see beauty in others' trash," or something of the like!    In talking with someone else about this, and the infusion of feminine energy that permeates the air like the elephant in the room, I was surprised to discover that I'm perceived as being open.  I have been able to surrender to the notion that I am a food addict.  I have surrendered to the notion of being addicted to just about anything and everything.  Perhaps that's because I really am crazy about this world, this plane for I have been feeling "in-love-with-everything."  But I sense that for all of my supposed openness, I can be more open.  I can be more honest, be more willing too.  I have a lot of hope for the future, because my right-now-present feels rather exquisite.  Through meditation practice, I've come to feel a deep well of well-being available to all of us whenever we want.  It's not so much a well as it is an endless ocean of ephemerality that I visualize.  I become one with it, osmotically distributed throughout it, and it distributed through me.  We are all one, after all.    Still, the tiredness continues, and I haven't posted as much over the last few days.  I don't know if anyone's checking on this blog or not.  Suppose I could find out if there's a way to, but that's really not the point.  "I'm building it--they will come" to paraphrase  Field of Dreams .  Anyway, I hope I find others in my immediate "soul family" with whom I can share in the awesome and lovely feelings Gaia and the sun Ahau provide us all.

						   I've taken to reading a lot of blogs.  (Wish there was a different word for these wonderful on-line diaries than "blog"--sounds like it could be a synonym for "to vomit".)  I read quite a few of the more progressive political ones and gayspirituality.typepad.com.  I'm open to reading other blogs as I find them, or as others pass them on to me.  Right now, it's only been a little over a week since I started this blog, and as far as I know no one's checked into it yet.  I've emailed a few friends about it.  Thus far there have been no comments on any of my posts.  Oh, well.  It's early yet.  I see the potential for dialogue and for co-evolving points-of-view.  I see the potential to foster cross-pollination across various fields of information and understanding--how the political might meet the educational, the culinary, the spiritual, the artistic, etc.    It's all connected in some odd way, all of-a-piece.

						   I haven't really felt like doing much these past few days, to tell the truth.  There have been some things I could post on--for example, the  Times' Book Review  had a passel of books about obesity and eating disorders this week.  I picked up a haughty ignorance in the reviewer of the "can't people just stop eating or stop worrying about it" variety.  Made me wonder what Ms. Heffernan's addiction-o'-choice is.  American=Addict as far as I'm concerned.  Haven't met anyone without some sort of addiction problem, this in the greatest country in the world.  I don't have a problem saying it's the greatest country in the world.  I would have a problem calling the Unraveling States of Addiction an "excellent" country, however.  Very few books or plays or artworks or policies are both excellent and great.  Shakespeare's  The Tempest  comes to mind as one, as does Chekhov's  Three Sisters  and the Social Security system.  Greatness is something that is socially determined, whereas excellence is about staying true to a vision of something.  For me the classic distinction between Excellence and Greatness can be short-handed to James Jones vs. Ernest Hemingway.  Jones is the humbly excellent writer whereas Hemingway is (merely) great.  While Jones' books were respectable sellers with some critical acclaim, Hemingway was lifted by the cultural moment into a certain sphere only occupied by individuals such as Victor Hugo and Fyodor Dostoevsky.    I can think of one writer--F. Scott Fitzgerald--who was capable of penning both great works ( The Great Gatsby ) and Excellent ones ( The Crack-Up ).  Hemingway for all I know did write excellent pieces.  There are a b'zillion stories I have not read.  I have read a couple of his novels--his stories are much better IMHO.  "A Clean Well-Lighted Place" haunts me.  [Sidebar:  Hemingway is a distant relation of mine.  I don't know if by blood or what, but I have a great-great-grandmother whose last name was "Hemenway" which other branches took to spelling the Ernest way.]    I think all writers are capable of writing excellent pieces.  They can strive for mere greatness if they choose to, but I don't feel it would be as satisfying.  When I talk of greatness, commercial success is an aspect of it, but it shouldn't be confused with being the same thing.  As much as I love J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, I can't say that it is excellent or great particularly.  Entertaining, addictive--I've just finished reading Book 4 for the seventh time(!) and am on to  HP and the Order of the Phoenix  for the fourth (only because I'd read the whole series 5 times before I'd gotten book 5).  Would Jonathan Franzen's  The Corrections  qualify as a great book?  I wonder. Time will have to tell on that.  I'm pretty sure Michael Cunningham's  The Hours  should qualify.  While I'm obviously partial to the excellent book, I have an occasional affinity for a great one.  I enjoyed the Cunningham, and tolerated well the Franzen.  I've read quite a bit of Louise Erdrich's novels, and thoroughly enjoyed the great  Beet Queen , and slogged through her excellent  Love Medicine .  I could go on about these things, but suffice it to say, this is something best continued with others pitching in their insights...  (Feel free.)

On the days I don't eat this, I either eat a variation on this replacing the ricotta with 2 eggs and the s.f. vanilla syrup with s.f. maple or Oat Bran pancakes.

						   I weighed myself today.  183.  Been this weight now for 8-9 weeks.  It amazes me that I can put on a shirt that's a Small, and that it mostly fits--Smalls typically are too short for "long-waisted" people like myself, which means I need a "Tall Small"--and still "feel fat."    Really it's not fat that I feel, but "round", or rather "flabby" I guess is the better word therefor.  I need to work out and exercise more ultimately.  It would be a good thing for me in more ways than one, actually.  I've been feeling low-energy of late.  Still, I go immediately to "fat" instead of "flabby," and I need to self-talk myself to a place where the fat voice mutes down to a dull roar.  183, size 31 jeans that aren't tight on me?  That's pretty strong, tangible evidence I'm A-OK in the weight area.  I eat very well today, in not having had sugar or flour for almost 16 months now.  Of course there's more to do now, with needing to exercise and pursue ways of being in the world.    I'm adding a new request for help in my prayers these days, that of helping me to reach out to others for help, and to give help as well.  Am open to all sorts of possibilities there...

						   This is actually my weekend.  My "Sunday" as it were.  So try and imagine that tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. will be my Monday morning.  But I won't go into work until 12:30 a.m. (I have "deakfast", meditate, write my "Wake-Up pages" (as opposed to Morning Pages), do some other stuff and have "nunch" before I go off to urk'lly-workel-work.)  I like to walk from the Lower East Side to my office on 53rd/Lex, but sometimes with all that time, I end up taking the bus instead.  I work some hours, then go to a couple of post-work appointments I have, then home to take/make phone calls, then off to the park or "Tar beach" for some sun.  Then home.  Friday-Monday, the time before work is truncated as I generally get to work between 10:30 and 11 p.m. those nights.  I work every other Thursday--next week I'll take a 3 day weekend.  Generally speaking this adds up to 84 hours over two weeks' time.    Believe it or not, I think this is sane, given what field I work in.  Not to take the inventory of people on other shifts, but if one is to work around as many micromanagers as big ol' NYC Law Factories hire, doesn't it make sense to be working on shifts where as few as possible of them abound?  Of course, it would be even better if I could work in a different field entirely.  But I have those verdammten G-School Loans back to pay.    With a $440 monthly payment, my options are a bit limited.  Still, I dream of a day when I'll be able to live comfortably and reasonably well, teach playwriting and directing to students, teach healthful and delicious cooking to needful persons, facilitate critical thinking workshops and participate in building a Big Eden-type community some place wonderfully rural and cosmopolitan at the same time.  My American Dream for today...

						   Thank Gaia!  Another characterization:  "Good morning, Mr. Morell, would you state your name, shield number and precinct for the record."  "Officer Morell, Shield # 92323, Precinct 5a(1)"  "And what do you do in the 5a(1) Precinct?"  "Anticrime Unit.  I canvass the area in plainclothes, looking out for criminal acts or trying to prevent them from happening."  "And you were working on the day of August 17th, 2004?"  "Yes I was."  "And were you working that afternoon, around 3 p.m.?"  "Yes, that is correct."  "And did you have the opportunity to apprehend someone at that time?"  "Yes I did."  "And what was the name of that individual?"  "Richard Dencktnicht."  "And what circumstances led up to the arrest?"  "I was called to a Bodega at 1-1/2 Avenue B, where a robbery had taken place.  My partner and I got there and talked to the manager--"  "That would be Ms. Richard-Sellers?"  "That is correct.  She said she had been robbed and attacked.  She looked like she had been hit in the face and complained about a loose tooth."  "Were the EMTs called?"  "Yes, someone had done that."  "And were there other people in the store?"  "There was one fellow, a Mr. Richard-Salem, who had quietly witnessed what had happened from the back."  "And did you ask Mr. Richard-Salem to help you find the perpetrator?"  "Yes, we did.  We got in the control car and we started to canvass the area and--"  "Sorry to interrupt, but would you explain what 'canvass' means?"  "Sure.  Canvassing is searching the vicinity of a crime for a suspect.  Mr. Richard-Salem was in the car with us, and near the Hamilton Fish Library--"  "That is on Pitt Street?"  "Yes.  He spotted the suspect.  My partner and I pulled up near to Mr. Dencktnicht and announced ourselves and he started to run.  I gave chase, and we turned onto 9th Street.  My partner got to him first and he fell to the floor.  He moved his arms all around and kicked and thrashed about.  I got one of his arms in a cuff, but he put his other arm under his back and refused to allow us to apprehend him.  After a few minutes of this, we cuffed him and took him to the Precinct."  "And did Ms. Richard-Sellers later have the opportunity to see Mr. Dencktnicht in police custody?"  "Yes she did."  "I have no further questions for the witness."   Subtext of Officer Morell:  Argh!  My day off and I have to come into the Grand Jury and testify!  Bastard Dencktnicht!  Better get an indictment's all I can say.  Well, these people look mostly regular, though I can see the black woman doesn't believe a word I say.  Too bad.  I'm only trying to help.  Though I think they deserve all that they get.  They don't fool me, these people.  In fact, I don't like a lot of the people here.  The foreman seems OK.  Reminds me of Father Richard O'Malley at Our Lady of Perpetual Backdraft.  Nice fellow--too bad about the altar boys."     (Maybe more to come later.  All this was made up sort of.  The case details were, certainly.  White cops seem to be fairly generic to me, alas.  I'm merging a whole bunch of fellows together into one.  But there will be other sorts of cops and ADAs and even jury members to come...)

						   At long last, my month in this purgatory is over!  I'm looking forward to trying to get back to my summer schedule, just in time for my sojourn in Dakota Norte to begin sometime next week.  I haven't booked my flight yet, but once I do this I will be oh-so-happy to get out of Mussolini-ville for a glorious, stress-reduced week.   Now that I'm in my last day of this difficult month, I'm looking back over the slow slide into isolation and impotent rage that I allowed into my life.  It's tough to expose myself to that consistently angry and repressed energy embodied in our police and legal systems.  I think I wrote about the two angriest cops whose energies I've been witness to--both worked for financial institutions.  The other jurors I have had the most problems with also work for financial institutions, interestingly enough.  (They wouldn't know that I had problems with them--is that to my credit or detriment?  Sometimes I can't tell when I'm working good Al-Anon or just being codependently wimpy.)   Others remind me that all of these other people are me--the ADAs with their varying degrees of competence, repression and despair, the uptight cops, the mostly unseen accuseds, the witnesses, the jurors and the wardens.  The employees of the court.  In a way I've been both participant in and audience member for, a parade of characters each of whom is me.  I am Richard the ADA who populates his prattle with "ers" and "ums", I am the enraged, red-faced Irish cop who answers all of his questions concisely and with venom, I am the easygoing, baby-faced warden who's engaged to marry one of the court reporters, I am the Texas-born, Virginia-raised white-collar criminal--I mean banker who serves on the jury and votes to indict on every single case, I am the gay psychotherapist serving as secretary for the proceedings who secretly wishes he was a white-collar criminal and so forth.  How accurate all this is really has no bearing--it's all about my perceptions and judgments, and that is what I've been having to confront with the most unease and discouragement:  my ease with making judgments.  "The more one judges, the less one loves" reads a t-shirt that I used to wear when it was thinkable for me to wear size 3X.  I sort of wish I had the courage to put that t-shirt on and wear it to the grand jury room, but I never dared to be so spiritual so brazenly in all this time.  (And would it really have been spiritual to try to show people up in such a way?  Still, it might have been interesting to get someone to film the reactions of others to reading my t-shirt in such an environment.  Talk about drama!)  So I'll probably populate some of this blog now with some of these pithy observations about the different versions of myself, as per a suggestion made by a good friend.  Here's the first:  "Hi, I'm Richard Chitra Bombay, and I'm an assistant district attorney for the county of New York.  I'm here to present several charges against Richard African-American Defendant.  On the charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, New York Penal Code ___.__ subsection __ under the theory that the defendant possessed a narcotic with the intent to sell, and I'm charging you with the count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree Penal Code ___.__ subsection __ under the theory that the defendant possessed more than 1/8 of an ounce of a narcotic, and also criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree under the theory that Richard African-American Defendant possessed a controlled substance, and I'm also charging you with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree under the theory that the defendant possessed a firearm that has been defaced.  I will have two witnesses before you today, and now I'll bring in the first witness, Richard White-Plainclothes-One."   My vision of Richard Chitra's subtext:  "I'm a great ADA.  I don't exactly love this job, but I'm going places all right.  It doesn't hurt that I'm a cute person of color in a society that is dominated by all notions of color.  Even New York City pays attention to color, and I can see as an Indian woman that I have a leg up on most of the other minorities here.  It is interesting to note however, that the racial element is losing force.  It all comes down to how we represent ourselves.  I may some day see some Punjabi boy gangbanger on the other side of the court, and I'm sure I'll wonder how he got that way, how the parents were involved, etc.  But there's a good reason that jobs from here are being shipped to Bangalore and Lahore.  It's because of our work ethic.  I really don't like agreeing with Dinesh D'Souza--"Distort DaNewza" some Dartmouth friends said about him--but my observation does bear him out a little.  Though it's not as much racial as it is about how these near-destitute people can't back up and see the whole picture.  I don't know if they're incapable or if they just don't have the tools or if they're just plain lazy--maybe a combination of all three.  I talk with Richard LaQueisha J.D. Washington, Esq. and Richard Marianne Jean-Veniste about the black defendants and the victims too, and they have an even more jaundiced viewpoint.  I don't really know what to think, but hey, I've got a job and pretty good security with it.  I don't doubt I'd have a harder time if I lived in Selma, Alabama or Tucson even.  But even so, if all these drug cases keep coming in, I'll be set for quite a while.  That feels good."    Note:  I do have a specific person in mind with this characterization, though I don't think she represented any cases like the one I have pieced together.  The case itself is a compilation of several different kinds of cases I have heard.  The subtext section is just my musing about "Richard-Chitra" based on my own internal temperature and texture as it responds to the information she presented to the "Richard Foreman." (Hilarious!  There Really is a Playwright with that name--he won a Macarthur Fellowship even, and runs the St. Mark's Ontologic-Hysterical Theater on St. Mark's Place in the East Village!)  How "true" is it?  I don't know.  I'm putting out my perceptions just to say "Given the information of what I've seen of this person, and she's one of the four or five I've seen on a couple of different cases--this is what I perceive may be going on behind the lenses of her eyes, in her soul.  Again, not to judge, just to bring my perceptions out and say  this is what I see  and nothing else but."   Remember.  Even though a real person inspired this, "Richard Chitra" is another me.  As I am another you.

						   Some days just suck.  Warning:  This is not a happy post.  I'm putting this on my blog because I need to let people in on what's going on in my head right now.  I need to express myself a bit.  Or rather, I find myself in a sucky mood, and I can't seem to dig myself out of it.  I know the things that will help me--reaching out to others, trying to be of service, making some plans and what not.  And I have to cut myself some slack I guess, because of this F***ing grand jury service.  (I took yesterday off and boy did I notice a shift in my energy! Only one more f'in' day left thank Gaia!)  I've been isolating.  I've not been taking very good care of myself--two nights ago was the first time I went to a movie in almost a month.  I've also not been a participant in the civil war that's going on outside my window.  Yes, we are in a civil war, whether we want to realize it or not.  It's not a civil war between regions however, but one between those who wish to live in a friendly universe vs. those who clutch onto living in a hostile universe.  I find myself in a liminal space, between the two.  God, it's arduous work to move from the hostile to the friendly!  I get to be too hard on myself--today I was "complaining" to another person who helped me to fetch myself up short and realize the disease of civilization was talking through me, wanting me to judge myself for having a rough time.   It's tough for me to sit in on these cases where I get to see people being mean to each other, where I get to expose myself to uniformed/plain-clothes officers who are really sanctioned criminals IMHO, getting their jollies off of further victimizing the unchanced and the unschooled in favor of the unprincipled and the immoderate elegant thugs operating at an eagle's remove from all of the muck.  I saw two thug-corporate-cop-cunts on one case, safeguarding the interests of a couple cuntorate vampires, and I immediately wished these two fellows had their heads separated from their bodies.  They carried themselves with such swagger and rage and general cuntishness, I found myself fantasizing about bashing their brains in.  Of course I had to pray for them, had to ask Gaia to transmute my hatred into something positive.  I don't know if anything happened, other than that I didn't jump out from the foreman's table and throttle each of these thugs to death.  Guess that's something.  Because of all this isolation and exposure to ugliness, I'm in a toxic morass.  I didn't handle this time in service to New York State very well.  I told myself I was doing service and during this episode ended up doing myself more disservice.  Fantasies of my own death have been populating my mind.   It occurred to me tonight that we are probably going to be making the aforementioned civil war more of a reality as the election draws near.  If, as I expect, the Cunts at the Top find a way to fix the election in their favor, I'm fairly sure that there are enough people out there who won't stand for it that they'll cause some sort of disturbance.  If, on the other hand, Kerry does actually win, then the Cunts will foment a civil war because they will believe they've been wronged and "the South will rise again" as it were.  These are unreasonable reptiles-in-human-clothing who will brook no challenge to their tenuous grasp on reality.  The truth will out, and there will unfortunately be war.  I see it as inevitable.

						   I'm better off without him.   As difficult as it is for me to let go of the reins of a friendship, I need to release my former sponsor from any perceived obligations he might have toward me.  Whether he pulls himself away from the fetters is none of my business.  I have been in that arduous position of telling someone to "Let Go of me!" when I was the one who was holding onto the other one.  It's time I go about my business and live my life.  In talking with my best friend today, I had to laugh at myself, the therapy junky.  Yes, I have learned quite a bit in my inner travels and travails.  And the good news is that I take what I learn and give it over to others for their objective appraisal.  After talking with my other sponsor, an Al-Anon friend and my best friend, I can more dispassionately see that my former sponsor has issues and it would be codependent of me to even start to address them.  And so I ask Gaia and the sun to bless him, give him everything he wants out of life and now I choose to walk down a different pathway.  I thank him for some of the benefits he gave me as my sponsor.  He did help to get me into a place of abstinence and he did give me freely of his understanding of 12-step recovery.  He and I did have some good times, especially driving out of the city.  I enjoyed talking with him about art, theater, aesthetics and other heady topics.  He's a decent person and a good person who wishes to help others.   But we're not the greatest combination and I have come to recognize that we come to a parting of the ways.  It's not the first time I've parted with a sponsor, though it is the first time I actually got so apoplectic I yelled at him.  And while I felt that initial guilt, I see it as a piece of information that in reality gives me great encouragement rather than a feeling that I did something that needs an amends.  The amends I need to make is one of timing--I needed to scream "G.F.Y." to him earlier than this.  But no matter, it came out when it did and the timing I have to respect as impeccable.  It's also given me a perspective to reevaluate not only my connection to the food fellowship, but to all my fellowships.  It's been 9 years since I first walked into an Al-Anon room, and as much as I have incorporated the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions into my life, I need to take a pause and reflect on what I've been doing and what needs my attention.  Yesterday, I talked with my mother about housecleaning and keeping busy.  At her age, she needs to keep busy especially, or she'll drive herself crazy.  So she creates projects for herself.  She was taking a break from setting brick slabs into the dirt outside the house when I called.  Likewise, I need to create "recovery projects" for myself.  My 8th/9th Step is a project, but so too are some other areas, like the "Square Dancing Project" and the "Turning my Apartment into a Home Endeavor."  I can spend some time on the projects I create and take some small actions toward them.  I also need to spend some time on the "What's My Perfect Life to Look Like? Program" and "Richard Gives Service Project" as well.  And I have my former sponsor to thank for this, for jump-starting the process through his own need to pressure me and slot me into a time slot with no room for error or human fallibility.  Thanks!

						   I talked with an Al-Anon friend about the fracas with my CEAHOW sponsor.  In one of those D'Oh!mer Simpson moments, I was reminded that as per Al-Anon, if I feel guilty about something, I probably did something right.  In retrospect, I did need to tell him "Please, if you would, off to back."  Yes, it came out sideways.  It came out in a rather childish manner and could have been more elegantly carried off.  But I'm human and I didn't respond to the pressuring all that well.  So ironically it's to my credit that I said what I said, if not for the style, than at least for the content.   Hooray for me!

						   I've been in a funk the past few days because of my angry eruption.  It feels like an emotional wound that got reopened.  Perhaps it had scarred over since the last time, but it feels just like new.  I'm surprised at the primal feelings I have, of how they would so like to cloud over my vision.  It's probably no shock that I don't feel at all like meditating of late, though my awkward Grand-Jury-debilitated schedule only adds to that mishagoss.  Since I've not been exercising as much of late, again due to G.J. rationalization, I have inadvertently put myself in a more vulnerable position regarding emotional wraith penetration.  There are so many factors to the feeling of toxicity that courses through me right now.  I haven't reached homeostasis yet.  The situation will continue to evolve, as I use the tools of the 12 steps and talk about the situation with my other sponsor and my _A and _-Anon friends.  (_ means fill-in-the-blank.  DA, AA, NA, Al-Anon, NA-Anon, etc.)  There are other factors too that are more confusing.  My food fellowship is not ideal as a means of staying in recovery.  I'm wondering if it isn't something I use as a bridge to some other sort of fellowship that is a bit more mature in its outlook without going into OA-style permissiveness and rationalization.  Though armed with the knowledge I've received from my food fellowship, I might be able to wade into the OA waters and seek out the ones who have achieved something of note.   The thing that set me off most was not knowing how to deal with a situation that allows for no recourse.  I've been in jobs like that.  There's a word for that sort of job, and that word is "abusive."  It's tough to go through all of this stuff, which is supposed to make me stronger, and then receive what amounts to a "pop-quiz" of sober action and to recognize that my head needs some fine-tuning.  I'm sure there was a graceful way to handle that situation, and I probably could replay the whole scenario making a different choice.  That is a tool for the future.  I am not a bad person, just a guy with issues about being pressured.  I have this image of a snake that has been coiled up inside me, waiting, just waiting for the right opportunity to reach out and strike.  And what's so confounding is that what I said was really inane, childish, small and small-minded.  That it set off the other person was something I think I did intend to do, and how I knew that would do the trick is beyond me.  "My inner parselmouth" read the situation correctly and it hit its target all right.  "Listen, Virgo--" and that was all that was needed.  I don't think it was the other person's intent to be abusive.  They got into a tunnel-vision of their own and he had his reasons for his actions.  They may be reasonable, they may not.  My role in the situation was that I have been a people-pleaser throughout this relationship.  I've not been able to maintain clear boundaries around this sponsorship thing.  I have a lot in common with this fellow, and I do genuinely like the guy, his eccentricities notwithstanding.  But we have learned how to hurt each other, and that troubles me  sehr .   And I've been living inside this strange, darkened viewpoint where I get to accept my own humanity.  At long last, I suppose.  But I don't like what I see, and while it's not like I viewed myself as Gaia's gift to humanity before, I'm feeling a deep sadness underneath the rage and fear.  This really is sadness too, not self-pity.  (That little monstrosity is trying to wheedle it's way in, but I have to kick it in the jaw and send the little skull-dog scurrying away from me.  I now think that's what my weird dream about being attacked by the vicious little undead pooch was about.)   More to come later.  Still developing...

						   In this town of my desiring, I see myself eating at Shades of Green, the vegan restaurant on Lark Street.  Many of the street names of Albany's Capital District are named for birds.  Dove Street, Eagle Street, Hawk, etc.  Lark Street is Albany's version of Greenwich Village.  It has a "funky-bohemian" feel to it.  About two miles to the west, down Central Avenue is the Food Co-op, the name of which escapes me for the moment.  I imagine myself hanging out on Lark Street sometimes, sharing a meal with a group of friends of like mind, all of whom come together in a  thirtysomething -like collection.  (I hear W. G. Snuffy Walden's music and others of that ilk as the soundtrack to this existence, I must also note.)   I envision a life where yes, cold weather abounds.  Of course Albany frequently has harsh winters, yet I love that.  For today, anyway.  Growing up in Colorado where it could snow 3 feet one day then be 65 degrees the next day in December, I do have a deep affection for the white stuff.  Even four years at Dartmouth, where it gets really cold due to the humidity of the continental climate, couldn't exterminate my "nevaphilia."  (I think "Nevada" means snowy, in case my made-up word is incorrect.)  I need to have four seasons.  Since I entered into this abstinence my sensitivity to seasonal change has become much more exquisite.  Now that we're into Lammastime, I am aware of autumn's imminence.  The season is "born" now, while Summer is at its apex.  Over the next few weeks, I'll be longing for squash, sweaters and the changing of the leaves.  The Hudson River Valley gets a gorgeous tinting in autumn, needless to say.  Last fall, I sat near the Hudson in Riverfront Park and just took in the grandeur of the trees across the river in Rensselaer.  I can envision lovely get-togethers, maybe even bonfires at nearby farms and the like.  I can also imagine lively dances and social opportunities galore.  In this world, I still don't know what I would be doing for a living, but I'm filling in the details of the dream.  It will unfold at its own place as I color in more of the vision.

						   Well, it's been an enlightening 24 hours.  The sponsor I got angry with yesterday and exploded at fired me tonight.  He left a message on my machine telling me in essence to find someone else to work with.  I feel a whole mixture of emotions.  Sadness, fear, powerless rage, yes.  But mostly relief.    The Recovery Spiral  by Cynthia Jane Collins has been a real help to me in the process of sorting through my feelings.  In retrospect, I realize I have not been able to be completely honest with my sponsor, and because of this I have been reticent to share all of my feelings about things.  Really, our sponsorship relationship hadn't been working for quite a while and last night, a lot of feeling just came out sideways.  I wish I had caught myself before I blurted out my insanity, and I at least had the presence of mind to clip off the conversation before I went to town on the guy.   In retrospect I see that I'd been getting a lot of mixed messages from my fellow addict, but minimized my own reactions thereto.  It's easy to forget that all of us coming together in 12-step work have a disease that tells us we don't have a disease, and it's part of the process of becoming aware that we participate in making our relationships murky.   There's a saying in the rooms:  "Before recovery, a drunk horse thief.  In recovery, a sober thief."  I still approach my relationships with that addict mentality of "what can I get from this?"--even when I tell myself I'm not doing that.  There are some people with whom I don't do that, but more often than not, that limbic brain sizes others up on several different rubrics.  I have to be very careful where sponsors are concerned.  My needs are changing as I gain awareness and I need gentleness and truth-telling combined.  Not an easy combination.  I so wish that the castles of my imagination would manifest and we'd all be living "the life of the spirit made manifest."  We inhabit these flesh packets and we have to negotiate with other flesh packet-inhabitants.  These bodies, hearts, minds and souls have certain requirements to meet, and these come into conflict.  And if there's one thing I HATE, it's conflict.  I need others to tell me not to beat myself up during this difficult moment, and not to judge what happened yet as a mistake.  In other words don't diagnose before I'm ready.  Like I said, there are a lot of things to sort through in this short, troubled relationship.  I need to honor myself and my former sponsor both, by owning up to only what is mine, for it is a tendency to say "Global warming?  That's my fault and my fault alone."  Even as I tease out what is mine, I have to not point my finger at my former sponsor.  The outburst came at a difficult moment for both of us I fear, and I know we each have to take care of ourselves through this process.  The goal is to heal, after all, to learn to live with the disease of addiction much like the diabetic or someone with MS has to live with their disease.  Being painstakingly honest during the process is not something I want to volunteer for, but I must if I'm to stay abstinent.  I need to stay put and sort it out with people I trust.  This will take time.  Meanwhile, I need to grieve.  Yesterday, after I had my outburst, I wanted to cry.  My body shook with emotion and horror.  I feel this rawness in my chest cavity, an aching.  This is the nature of an emotional hangover.  There's more to this than meets the eye, and I know that I owe an amends.  But I need to take my time with this.  Even though the 10th Step says "When we were wrong, promptly admitted it," and I admit I was wrong, I still need to walk through it with others to nail down where  exactly  I was wrong.   Fun fun fun!

						   I work literally across the street from the Citigroup building.  Today, there's a terror alert, and it's being haphazardly handled.  A co-worker came in for the day shift, furious that 53rd Street hadn't been closed.  She'd already seen 4 panel trucks go by as she came in to work.  I'd heard also that while the entrance in front of 599 Lex (my building) was closed off, people could still come out RIGHT UNDER THE CITIGROUP BUILDING as of last night.  There are police with submachine guns and attack dogs in front of 599 Lex, but the subway's still open?  And 53rd Street is still open?  I mean, like WTF?  My shift ends soon, and I'm pretty sure that if there's an attack, it's not going to happen before 9 a.m.--aren't I the optimist?  But I just have to say, enough of this cheneying fear already.  I've been telling my friends I don't want to get used to seeing cops with AK-47s around everywhere.  That's h0w fascism starts, y'all.  That's how the frog boils to death, a degree at a time.  I want to jump out of this concrete pond now!

						   When I let myself go and imagine "my perfect life," I see myself walking on Lark Street near Central and Western Avenues in Albany. I see myself traversing State Street past the State Capitol and riding a bus out to the University. I see a free and easy fellow, looking for opportunities to be of service to Albanians, who is a part of the place. I try and envision what I do for a living there, but so far nothing comes to the surface. I do see myself living at least on the first floor of a house, perhaps even inhabiting the entire premises. I see myself as being a valued and valuable person in these environs, that I have a lot to offer the place and the people and the spirit of the place and peope, and that it returns the energy tenfold.  Today, I'm going to start something I hope I will be able to continue for a time. I've mentioned the film  Big Eden  before. "My Perfect Life" or rather "The Life I Want for Myself" can be shorthanded for the time being to  Big Eden  in Albany or nearby. I sense that Albany may not be a perfect fit with that idea--there is a reactionary element in the area's religious people, particularly in the Episcopalian heirarchy. The Irish Catholic rigidity is also an area of concern--William Kennedy points to this in his wondrous biography of his hometown,  O Albany!  But Albany is a  city . It may not be as populous as the epicenter of culture 3-1/2 hours to its south, but because of its urban nature there is a diversity of opinion and belief. As it is the state capitol, there's also a degree of expansiveness it must have. And it's a college town to boot.  So this is my first post about the Albany I imagine myself becoming a part of. Whether it actually ends up being Albany or Manhattan, or Devils Lake, North Dakota where my folks live, or Charleston, West Va.--wherever Gaia wills me to go--I am recording my impressions about life there, about the people that I might meet, about the spirit of the place.  Speaking on that spirit, I believe that the heart and soul of Albany is to be found in the H. H. Richardson designed State Capitol building itself. I find myself drawn to the courtyard in front of the building, just wanting to commune with its frisky-puppy energy. The State Capitol is a gorgeous building that yes, was probably inspired by some French architecture. But it is its own building as well, forthright in its gracious presence. For all of the politicking that goes on there, it feels like a "happy building," particularly in sharp contrast to the Rockefeller mo(der)nstrosities across Eagle Street therefrom. Walking down the Empire State Plaza, one can't help but think of Mussolini Rome and Berlin under Hitler or East Berlin during the Soviet years, with their rigid [national-]socialist-realism that advertised their weak masculinities. The only good thing those buildings do is to increase one's appreciation for the spiritual center of the city. ESP will never be that, The Egg notwithstanding. (I do like The Egg, but that may be because I like to be perverse.)  (I'm still sort of learning the ins and outs of posting to this site.  Here's a link to a picture of the building I love so much:   urlLink http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/albanyrich/cap1.jpg

						   Actually, I'm going to type #2 first, and put it below #1 which is more pleasant.  #1:  There's a party always happening inside me.  On my way to work tonight I did a walking meditation where I tried to get in touch with all my animal guides.  In doing some informal internet research on working with animal guides, I came across a fellow who says that each of our chakras has it's own guide.  The first animal that appeared was the otter.  He felt like he was my heart chakra, and then other animals started to appear.  I now feel there are more than just seven chakras, that there are at least 13.  One starts below the ground, and the "last" one is somewhere out-there in space.  Anyway, I hadn't really been as in touch with my animal guides of late, so I decided I'd just spend time with each one of them as I walked part of the way to work.   My root chakra animal is the iguana, and I had some difficulty getting in touch with him.  When I moved up to goat, who was looking a bit peaked and I felt a wave of sadness come over me because goat seems to need a lot more, I started to understand that I had a difficulty with iguana because I don't feel as rooted into the world right now.  When I moved up to the third chakra, things got a little better, though my third-chakra beaver is a bit nervous and fidgety.  (I've noticed that's the way he is by nature, sort of a high-strung professorial type guide.)  Otter always wants to play--he works, but he works with purpose, so that he can play without fetter.  I imagined Otter playing in a small lake and splashing water at me, beckoning me to have a better time with life.  My three upper-chakra animal guides are all female for some reason.  Hawk, She-Bear and 12-point Doe.  I could see from Hawk's POV, flying above me, even as I kept my visual focus on the sidewalk ahead of me.  And I like being in Bear's energy--she's quite calming in her redoubt.  It was sometime here that the thought that "There's a party going on inside me" got caught in the web of my consciousness.  I filed it away so that I would begin this post with it.  Then I moved to to Doe, who I find a bit intimidating.  She doesn't suffer blather and process much.  I have to cut to the chase with her many times, though I think when sometimes I don't know what it is I'm feeling she's a bit more patient.  Doe reminds me of the SUNY-Systems Admin Building in Albany, New York.  Kind of a crone energy Doe has.  In fact as I was trying to commune with Doe, I got a whiff of "Old-lady smell."  (Clairvoyance, Clairaudience--is there such a thing as Clairolifaction?)   I imagine all my animal guides and my more human ones too spreading out and exploding onto a large green expanse near water.  The party is ongoing.  Sometimes I remember to drop in, like I did tonight.  #2:  Well, I was on the phone with one of my sponsors and I ran headlong into a trigger.  I won't go into the specifics of the conversation, but I felt myself slipping into a place that was a bit out-of-control.  I can only talk about what's going on with me.  In the heat of the moment, I felt I had been triggered, and the voices of "no f*in' way" were all ablaze.  I have a feeling that what was going on was two people who were both being unreasonable in their own ways were clashing, and I had at least the presence of mind to terminate the conversation, even though that meant hanging up on my sponsor in mid-sentence.  I didn't think I would be at any place where I could continue the conversation and in fact, saw that I had already caused some harm, when I "played the sign card."  (He can't help that he's a Virgo, I can't help that I'm a Pisces.)  That was a bit unfair, and I see the need to atone for that transgression.   I don't exactly know how it happened.  I know that there probably was some sort of Al-Anonic shenanigans at work, because I felt several hooks being thrown out and I was desperately trying to dodge them even though I was finding myself increasingly angry.  When I got off the phone, I had these irrational thoughts like I had been "found-out" and was having to go to the Principal's office or face the bailiff.  I will need to talk to some other people about the specifics of the situation to see whether I was unreasonable, or whether I was being reasonable but frustrated and reactive.  When anger and fear enter the picture, distortion is the name of the game, and I will need to speak to someone who has more access to reason than I do at the current time.  I'm sure I will need to make amends to my sponsor, but I have to be clear what the nature of my causing harm was, and that I only make amends therefor.  The Addict/Alanonic way of apologizing is to take on way too much, and before I know it, I'll be apologizing for being responsible for the US having a dry-drunk as "president."  Like that's ALL my fault!  (I do still believe we all qualify for Al-Anon just because of this state of affairs alone!)   I was the one who was angry and resentful, so that means there was something the matter with me.  I like the phrase "something the matter".  It's kind of a vague phrase which we have given a larger meaning as being upset with a state of affairs or a condition resulting from some discomfort.  I see that I had unintentionally turned my sponsor into an irresponsible authority figure.  Just because someone isn't perfect means they're automatically Hitler crossed with Mrs. O'Leary, cow-owner.  I felt something take over inside me, and I sense that this something has been building for awhile.  There's more to it, and I need to sort it out.

						   Chinese dietary theory holds that each food we eat is one of five "elements"--fire, metal, earth, wood or water.  Tonight for "nunch" I had a meal that was only imbalanced re: water.  The fire foods were salsa, brussels sprouts, and red lentils.  The metal food was cauliflower.  Earth included the banana, carrots and turnips and Wood included millet, butter and cashews.  If I drank decaf coffee that would be counted as water, though perhaps dandelion root tea would count as water.  (I have since switched from regular (fire) to decaf (water).)   When I choose to have a cup of blueberries/pineapple for dinner, then I'd have water in the blueberries.  I'll probably do this tomorrow, since it's best to have some representation from all five elements.  I would imagine that if I were to have a fire-less meal, I'd be a bit sluggish; without earth I'd feel light-headed, without metal spineless, and without wood brittle.  Without water, I guess I'm a little out-of-touch with my emotions.  Tonight I'll have tuna, turkey and cheese for protein, rice cakes for grain, various greens and veggies for a salad, and some avocado squash as well, cashews, ranch dressing, and butter, blueberries and pineapple, and sugarfree berry jello.  So I'll have in the fire category, tomatoes, red onion, red pepper and scallions and maybe arugula (can't remember if that's fire or water) while metal includes the rice cakes and wood the cashews and I believe the tuna, cheese, butter, dressing and perhaps the purslane(?).  Water will take the blueberries, the jello and mushrooms, and lastly earth the carrots and avocado squash.  I forget whether it's earth or wood that includes turkey (by process of elimination).  All in all, a fairly balanced meal.  *****  The other day I had some pork chops and my body rejoiced!  It luxuriated in something that the pork meat offered.  I have no idea what, but I do notice it when the cells of my body seem to glow with joyous abandon.  This has happened to me on several occasions, now that I've cleared my system of refined white powders.  *****  I'm still an addict, no matter what.  Yesterday as I was getting my stuff ready for my "brinner" meal, I spied someone else's "frosted celebration-matter."  Immediately upon seeing it, I remembered its taste and imagined it in my mouth.  It was instantaneous, there was no controlling the initial impulse.  I had no desire to steal it and devour it, but I did remember that longing after the nutrition-deficient substances I once knew.  A part of me felt enraged I couldn't have a piece of celebration-matter.  But I continued on with making my nutritious meal.  Someone came in and smelled the arugula and asked what it was, because it smelled so good, even though he was also talking with a co-worker about "those yummy raspberry cookies."  Still, asking after arugula is as it should be, is it not?  *****  The addict in me isn't wrong, he's irrational.  He wants to have as much sugar as he can stand without any consequences.  But when my body comes into an internal contact with sugar and flour, there can only be negative ramifications.  I don't always feel I'm enough with abstinent food, but without the refrain from the white powders, the frequency of feeling OK with the world would go down, my weight would go up, I'd have a never-ending feeling that I wasn't getting enough nourishment and really nourishing foods would seem unexciting and dull.  I remember after getting off sugar the joy I felt at having a cup of butternut squash!  Oh my word!  It was the best sensation in the world and it was abstinent!  During my fat years, squash held no allure, little appeal.  It was best seen as something to endure on the way to dessert.  But today it holds its own loveliness.  I'd lose that too with a hit of sugar, the "positive" effects of which would only last for five minutes or so.  The addict doesn't want to believe that the body he inhabits is this way.  He wants to believe that he's just like other people when he plainly is only like others who are inhabiting hypersensitive bodies like he is.  The addict isn't a figure for me to hate, but one for me to love and cherish.  He's not evil, he's just crazy.
