      There's a new Homestar cartoon called  Senor Mortgage .  It's about a mortgage company, and it is pretty funny...I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5. Here's a screenshot of the cartoon:

      I hope Paul Martin is the new Prime Minister.  So far, he is.  I hate Stephen Harper.  He wants to go to war with Iraq and whatnot and he called Maritimers lazy, that's why the employment level is so low.  That makes me angry.  Although Paul Martin probably isn't much better, he keeps it to himself about saying mean things and apologizing for things he was involved in...*cough* Even though NDP is probably the best sounding party out of the 4, they haven't really said anything to sway me. Now, Bloc Quebec is just insane...Why should they get to be their own country...Might as well just make the rest of the provinces their own country too!  Well, there's my political insight, hope you enjoyed!  Heather

       Number 1  It was super hot today.  I don't know what was wrong, yesterday was super rainy.  It makes me angry. :@ I don't like sudden weater change unless it's in the same day from rain to sun.  But today was just wayyyy to hott!!   Number 2  I don't know if my volunteer job starts this week or next week.  I don't want to call the girl and ask I'm too lazy.  I can't wait for the program to start though.  It will be really fun!   Number 3  Tomorrow I'm by myself and we don't have any food.  I don't know what I'm going to eat.  I'll have to go to Jessie's house for lunch.   Number 4  School's over and I'm really sad...that's probably weird but I like hangin' with the possy!  Oh well, I'll have fun next year at high school...I hope nothing changes though.

      I am   BORED  . Today is the first Sunday of my summer vacation.  All I did today was get up early to see Ben leave then I went to Tim Horton's and then I gave my dog a bath.  I hope to use the bucket of balls I won at PPP soon and have fun with your new digital camera Jessie... I need to change the time on this thing...It definitely ain't 9:00am! My sister and mommy are going to Frenchy's. I might go. I don't normally find anything at Frenchy's.  Oh! Too late, they left.  I want someone for me to talk to to come online:(

      Homestar is my hero! He is so great, he has a girlfriend named Marzipan.  urlLink Here's his webpage.  My favourite character on Homestar Runner is the Poopsmith.  He took a vow of silence.  He shovels crap all day long.  I like Strong Bad too.  He's really cool with his email and whatnot.  My favourite  Short  is  The Interview . My favourite  Strong Bad Email  is  funny ...really, thats the only one I can think of right now.  I love  Teen Girl Squad!  I wish I was What's Her Face (^-^) hehe. Not really, I'm Cheerleader, Katie is So and So, Katherine is What's Her Face and Jessie is The Ugly One.  I decided who was who guys... anyways, I think that i will go watch the new Strong Bad email!   Strong Bad: What were you doing out there?! I watched you prance by about 5 times! Homestar: What are you talking about? I drove! Strong Bad: You don't even own a car! Homestar: You're probably right. Strong Sad: So, let's get down to brass tacks. Homestar: Oh! I didn't bring them, I drove.   Extracted from "The Interview"  Lol.  Homestar: Here is Contestant #1...Strong Sad. So Strong Sad, what is this pumpkin called? Strong Sad: I call it a "Self-Portrait in Late October" Homestar: I call it last place! Ding!  From A Pumpakin Carve-nival  Lol.  Watch that one, the rest is really funny too!

      Last night, Canadian Idol was on.  I made my choices, Jacob and Theresa.  Jacob's kinda cute in his own way, lol.  He is very, very entertaining!  I hope he wins.  Theresa has a very nice voice and I think she might go far.  The next people up would be Constant and Bernard.  Heather
