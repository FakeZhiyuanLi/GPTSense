						   Well, everyone has told me that the "in" thing to do these days is create a blog.&nbsp; So here I am.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; A blank page to fill.&nbsp; This kind of thing gave me nightmares in school, and I'm doing this for pleasure?&nbsp;&nbsp;  I guess I'll start by telling you a little about myself.&nbsp; I'm 5'-8", blonde, blue eyes, 18 years old, gorgeous figure.....oh darn.&nbsp; I can't lie.&nbsp; OKay, okay.&nbsp; I'm your typical overworked, underpaid, 40-year-old mother of 3, married for 20+ years to her sweetheart, who needs to lose a few pounds.&nbsp; Okay, more than a few.&nbsp; Wait a minute.&nbsp; Who am I kidding?&nbsp; I need to get in line for a stomach staple these days!   Sigh....but I still  think  of myself as that 18-year-old with the gorgeous figure.&nbsp; Does that count?  Okay, back to my introduction.&nbsp; So I'm a fat, overworked mother of 3.&nbsp; I spend wayyyyy too much time working and not enough time exercising or doing just about anything else.&nbsp; I really need to get away from this computer more!   Let me tell you about my kids.&nbsp; (You knew I couldn't leave them out of it for long, didn't you?). My first-born is a typical 14-year-old boy, just discovering&nbsp;the opposite sex (though he would never admit it in a million years)&nbsp;and into his dog, Buddy, sports and music- specifically, drums.&nbsp; Very, very loud drumming.&nbsp; In my living room.&nbsp; Every day.&nbsp; For hours.&nbsp; But I do have to admit all his practicing is paying off.&nbsp; He's in the band at school and is one of their best percussionists.&nbsp; Beats alot of other stuff he could be into!&nbsp; He also plays the drums with the adult worship band at church, so he isn't wasting all that time.&nbsp; Just damaging my ears-- and aggravating his sisters.&nbsp;   That brings me to my two girls.&nbsp; My oldest daughter is just going into junior high school, the age where all of a sudden my softball/ soccer/basketball- playing tomboy is discovering makeup and hairstyles and clothes and  ::gasp!::  boys.&nbsp; Those creatures that just a year ago would give her cooties, are now all she and her friends can talk about.&nbsp; Let's just hope everything just stays at "talking about them" for a few years yet....nothing makes me cringe more than the word "dating" coming out of my child's lips!&nbsp; She still loves her two cats, though.&nbsp; At least that hasn't changed.&nbsp;   My youngest daughter is still in elementary school, and very proud of the fact that she is now a "big" girl at 8 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's just a lovable creature, the one that still lets me hug her and hold her in my lap, the one&nbsp;forever in a good mood.&nbsp; Her best friend at the moment is a big, fat, cute guinea pig named Raffi (named after Raphael Palmero, the baseball player).&nbsp; Yes, everyone in my family is a sports fanatic, including the baby.&nbsp; And yes, she too plays softball.&nbsp;   Last, but certainly not least, there's my hubby.&nbsp; The man I married 20+ years ago, who hasn't changed a bit on the inside,&nbsp; but well, let's just say we've both changed quite a bit from our wedding photos.&nbsp; He's probably the best husband a woman could ever have- understanding, gentle, loving and sexy, steady, a fantastic father, wonderful provider, wise spiritual head of the family.&nbsp; He just has  o-o-o-n-n-e-e  itty bitty fault that drives me insane.&nbsp; He cannot, for the life of him, make a decision.&nbsp; Doesn't matter what kind of decision it is- unimportant, like what-to-wear-today, or life-changing, like should-I-take-this-job.&nbsp; I've always been the one to ultimately make all the decisions in our family.&nbsp; And that's okay. Most of the time.&nbsp; I just wish, once in a while, he'd decide to do something wild and unexpected...like whisk me away on a second honeymoon ;-)&nbsp; But hey, what woman wouldn't wish that, right?&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
