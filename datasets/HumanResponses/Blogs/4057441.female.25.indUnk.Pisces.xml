       I'm a slob.&nbsp; My apartment is an absolute mess and disaster.&nbsp; How do I let it get to this point?&nbsp; I have always been like this.&nbsp; I remember as a little girl my Dad getting angry that I couldn't keep my room clean.&nbsp; One day after work, he got a few big, black trash bags and just shoved all my stuff into them.&nbsp; He told me that he was going to put it out for the trashman!!&nbsp; Actually, he just put them in the basement.&nbsp; There is a smell in my apartment that I can't figure out where it is coming from.&nbsp; eewww...&nbsp; I try to be more organized, more efficient, more clean; but, it just isn't working!!&nbsp; WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!?!!?&nbsp; Are there other people out there like me?&nbsp; It's not that I don't like&nbsp;a clean place.&nbsp; I really love it when it's all clean.&nbsp; I feel proud, less stress, and like I've really accomplished something.&nbsp; Am I destined to be a slob forever!?

       Do you ever feel like the weight of the world is lying on your shoulders?&nbsp; I just feel like that lately.&nbsp; Having an intern finishing with me and feeling responsible for her performance after leaving my site.&nbsp; Also, being responsible for therapy for kids in the schools...It can just be overwhelming at times.&nbsp; To think, I have the responsibility to use the power of music to it's fullest to help "cure" my students.&nbsp; It's unbelieveable at times!&nbsp; Yet, so amazing as well.&nbsp; To see kids learn to talk and sign in music before anything else.&nbsp; There are no words to describe how that makes me feel, let alone their parents.&nbsp; Sometimes, the things of the world just saturate me.&nbsp; Tonight, I spent most of the night looking at clothes on the internet to buy.&nbsp; Not that I can really afford any new clothes for fall, or that I really "need" them.&nbsp; Yet, I wasted all evening looking at things and deciding which ones I needed to buy.&nbsp; With this society, it almost seems impossible to escape the materialism and secular nature of everyone around me.&nbsp; I feel the need to expand my business in the way the make the&nbsp;most money, not about&nbsp;how to help the most&nbsp;children.&nbsp; It's discouraging.&nbsp; It's disgusting at times.&nbsp; It's frightening that this is what the world is coming to.&nbsp; And, it's so hard&nbsp;to not be saturated by it everyday.&nbsp;
