      Well, my 2nd enttry was...kinda delayed because i went for a holiday on...Thursday...just returned today. Went to Genting...most popular holiday destination. Of course, we stayed in a hotel called First World Hotel, whose standard was not really like a first world country. Plus, it was a standard room.   Then again, i suppose that at Genting, i wouldn't be spending much time at the hotel, which proved to be true. I was too occupied either playing the indoor games, or the outdoor ones. The indoor games were fun, if a bit addictive and therefore expensie. In the two days that I went there, i spent $50 on the games...well not a lot but still quite a fee.   The outdooor games were...thrilling. I tried the Space Shot, where i dropped from 12 storeys down(maybe more)and back again. Surprisingly, i didn't scream...how exiting. I closed my eyes though...oh well. I also tried the Corkscrew, a giant rollercoaster where I went upside down twice. After these two rides(which we tried first)the others paled in comparison. I wanted to try go-karting, but forgot to bring shoes. Typical. I just would have to be contented with driving a cirtual car at the indoor games.  Nothing else really. Bye.

      Alrite, as you can see form the description on the left, this is purely an ACE journal designed to get be ACE points. I will not go any further, because everything is on the left. If you are not of sufficient interllectual ability to know what I am talking about, I shall not be bothered with stooping to your level. If you don't understand, get out.  OK...that was a bit...lousy. Obviously the people reading this will be smart...including me, not to popular belief.   To the point of the jorunal. On Monday, I went to visit some of my old friends from primary school. I had a crack at his XBOX playing Halo...wthout much success, often falling from the 6th or 7th floor and committing suicide. We also played some table tennis...only for somebody to squirt somewater at the table when the score was tied at 9-9 when I was hitting...2 point slost and the stupid game lost too in the process. Nevertheless, I still felt a strange sense of sadness when it was time to go...(i HAD to go for i had already stayed for 11/2 hours longet than i should). It seems that i am most relaxed when i am with my old friends. Obviously they understand my very...er...essentric character and...don't really mind(I hope). And therefore, I took a longer route home just to stay with them a little longer.  WIERDO! CRAP! Yup, perhaps it was not a good idea to waste even  more time going home. Yet, my parents were out of the country and my sister working until 11pm... no harm done. Back to topic...i feel much more...affection(NO, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I AM GAY) for my old friends than my new ones.  Am I destined to dread every day I go to school, the only light in the tunnel being the next outing with my old friends? Yes, I admit school life now is better but still cannot comapre lah. Oh well...I have found some new friends now and maybe I will enjoy school life now too. I hope.

      Heya...was supposed to have EP3 at 7.30 but I was convienently not informed of the change of time. It's at 3. So, I had to go there, call my father, and THEN come back. Now I have to GO THERE AGAIN at 3. What marvellous timing. MY C++ is now oalmost completed. How marvellous. This just leaves my ACE...then again, I have LOTS of ace to do. I am...not confident about metting all 30 points for ALL subjects. In fact, I am almost certain that I will NOT meet the target. Sigh...  Also, my MRP is not up to scratch. My methodology needs to be changed. IN fact, EVERYTHING needs to be changed. Therefore, my main paper needs to be drastically improved(lit review simply terrible). LOts of stuff to do. In fact, jsut writing this entry had changed my view on my present homework situation.   Oh yes, the teachers want me to stay away from Jun Hong, as he also has problems and may undego counselling(like me). Just a sidenote...and another one-saw Fabian at Genting(when I was there). Said hi. Guess my relationship with my classmates isn't SO bad? That's a thought.  Well...I still have quite a number of entries to go. I should hand this in by mid-July. Cya!

      Hi. I just came back from my friend's house(same one last monday). I was glad to feel no despression as I left the house, or mayube it was just my legs aching ike crazy. Gave Han Lin a lift, only to be told to follow his example saying that he was so "polite". Honestly! Anyway, Tze Ern brought 2 more XBOX controllers so that we could play 4 player. Basically, the team with Tze Ern in it won everytime. Blame it on experience. In the end, all of us were competing for 2nd place. I am happy to announce that I was relatively successful. We also played table tennis(again), both doubles and singles. we played the singles tournament style and I won 2 lost 2. On the whole, it was a relatively good day.  On the holiday homework front, I have completed my geography project(my part of it anyway)and my ACE is now half done. How pathetic...however, I am looking foward to watching england vs prtugal on tv today. Cya soon!

      Because of the lack of anything important over the last few days, i did not update. However, I am now...updating. Yeah. To tell you the truth, my holiday homework is not in the best possible condition. I have not finished my C++(randomisation)and my geography project is also unfinished. My ACE is also woefully undone, except for one half-finished English Composition. I feel that the weightage for ACE should not be so high(same percentile as tests) Rather, a weightage of 20% would be enough, 10 for oral participation. HAe to contribute 30% to EVERY subject is no laughing matter. Not to mention that a 15 page compo only gets you about 3 ACE points. Maybe, more ACE points should be awarded.  AH well...i guess i should stop my ranting. Wei Xiang uses that word on me all the time. Instead, I will create a schedule for the days to come until school starts. I have ... got a look at my new timetable. We still have a day with 4 periods of Mr Cheng(Thursday). THere still is Chinese everyday. Basically, everything is the same except the day it is on. For example, Doble Science is still on.  Here's the schedule: 23/6-Swimming, completion of C++ 24/6-Frenz's house, finish geog 25/6-EP3 26/6-uh...ACE? 27/6 Rest, some ACE

      Well today was not a bad day as one would epect with double maths on the schedule. Music and CS were great, if the guitar was a bt too challenging for me. Learnt some flash and found that surprisingly, even with my terrible flash skills, I am still able to finish the task set and get my ACE point. Yay!  Of course, there was the compulsory Chinese lesson, where everybody pretended to be paying attention but were in fact staring blankly into space. Whoopee. It wasn't SO bad. Geography was quite fun. The computer screwed up, so we had an oral discussion instead. WHen the question"what are the uses of volcanoes" was asked, so many ridiculous answers were given that I was rollin gin mirth(kk exaggerated). Some were"Fireworks", "population control", "murder" and "surfing".   Double maths was not as bad as originnally thought, because my answers to the worksheet discussed were mostly correct and I wa able to slack and talk to my friend. Grinz.

      Yesterday was our first day of school. Received our new timetable(which i had already glanced thru when I peeked at it during the hols). Not much difference really. Mdm Cao got a new hairstyle...but unfortunately the teaching style is still as boring as ever. Evidence in the fact that someone nearly fell asleep today. ...Then, for assembly, there was sex education or something to that extent. Rather, puberty. However, the Q&A turned out to one of the funniest ones in exsistence(camp briefing was also good). Masturbation and castration turned out to be only a few of the topics covered.   Today, Our CS teacher Mr Yong had a dental appointment, so it was double history. Played a game and did some group work, where the teacher found me a group by appealing to then to accept me as usual. Not bad really. Found out that we wouldn't be changing groups today, though it doesn't really matter to me when I'm sitting at the back of the class. I'm looking for a group to take me in(lots of group seem ok except for one of them in the group).  STILL have to do my CRP and MRP. DOung Wizard of OZ. Goin to do now. Bye peeps.

      It's been(quite) a long time. I watcjed first 2 quarter-finals, but misssed the third due to...not being able to sleep at the required time. Yeah, that's it. Even so, the 3rd one was a goalless draw. Not exactly what I would call exciting. Holldand went thru on penalties. Better than England...Beckaham's penalties simply rock. Yup. High AND wide. Tragicomic.  Crashed on maths(due to remedial lessons with Mrs Chung being a flop). Took me until 11pm yesterday(so no soccer) and worked non-stop today. Finally finished everything so I can rest and do this entry. Holiday homework still far from over though(CRP  AS for  returning to school...I think that life should be better tahn the previous 2...I hope. Perhaps ot's just blind faith, but I am fairly resolved NOT to cause trouble next term and hand up more of my stuff on time. I hope.

        I have not updated for half a month...how nice. School has been okay so far, only one or two treating be like shit. To "foster class relationships", I joined the class soccer team...as goalie. Got elevated to first choice due to making some wonderful saves during training and in friendlies. So much for the good stuf...I'm now in danger of losing my job due to some terrible games in the last week. Our first half of the first leg was on Tuesday. Refree kayu. Luckily, after a discussion, the score was changed. Wahoo, o pledge to do better next time...sigh. Now, got to buy a jersey as class t-shirt. $21.&nbsp;Colour and details to be&nbsp;decided later.     &nbsp;   My oral exam is tomorrow!. &nbsp; 9% of total grade. I selected  Is the Moon Tired?  by Christina Rosetti. It's short. Haha. But I've memorised it and my answers to potential questions All ready! Except to background of the author...going to do that now. And, lessons are getting better! That's right, even Chinses and MAths! YAY!

       Wow. It's still only Tuesday. Cant wait for the weeekend.    &nbsp;  TOday was acceptable...two Chengies and Cs...double Chinese though. First was English...learnt some alternative narratives. I don't really get some of them. It really depends on how you look at it...and we have to write a compo by onday. HOW EXCITING!!! LOL    &nbsp;  Then...Geography. We dodn't have early recess for once. Apparently the other teachers have COMPLAINED. Goes to show how some teachers are power-crazy megalomaniacs who cannot see students having extra fun. Did soem group work on Earthquakes...was rather fun. This despite the fact that I had Kevin in my group.    &nbsp;  After some animal Farm, went to CS for Flash. Made this stupid fat guy run and run, Lame, but still completed the project. Had time to play some SSB later. PWNEd someone with Kirby. So cute...    &nbsp;  Alright...soon it was the chinese tern test. Did ok i guess. The letter was good, but the compo wasn't that good...so it evens out!

      It has again been a long time since I last blogged. This due to mostly laziness...and Ocarina of Time, Yes, I FINALLY found it and an N64 emulator. Yes, I DO suck at it. That I admit freely. It's still very fun and I made it to an adult using only school time(ccan't play at home).  On Friday, after National Day Celebrations(BORING) I went back to my old school AGAIN. As ever, I saw my old teachers and saw a bit of the inter-house sports. Shark got thrashed HORRIBLY. What a disgrace. We won last year lor...must use the old tam to thrash them. GIve them handicap or sth lah.  Went for CS(getting better)and lunch after that. I couldn't have eaten at the canteen as it was closed early due to Mational Day celebrations. So, had to eat some fried beehooon that was absolutely HORRIBLE. Went to primary school's friend house after that. As ever, enjoyed myself on that day.  I feel that all thse music idols should be cut down on. I encourage personaltity, so liking a singer or their songs is not a problem. But camping 2 weeks for a good seat at their concert? How did the guy ever help you? What WILL he ever do for you? I mean, the closet you can get is...him waving to you and saying hi as he gives you his autograph? What's the point in that? GO for concerts and get their albums, I don't care. It's good. Just dont...be...crazy.
