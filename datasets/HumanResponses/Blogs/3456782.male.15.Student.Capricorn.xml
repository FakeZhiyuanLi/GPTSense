      I've decided that I'm going to become one of those people who define any word bigger than two syllables as if the definitions are different for different people. By 'definition' I mean the meaning of the word, and by 'different people' I mean people who aren't the same.

      One thing I’d like to do someday is get an army of little kids with PVC swords— in fact, what’d be awesome, is two armies of little kids with PVC pipes charging at each other. I’d gather all my friends around, we’d have bets (“Alright Amir, whom’re ya puttin’ your money on? Shirts or skins?”). Only problem is resources, where would I get all that PVC? Getting’ kids is no problem, my uncle Gin must have approximately  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  (which actually adds up to a billion) by now.

      I am now, officially old enough to get a permit. Even though I won't actually be driving for several years. but that's not the point, the point is not that I'm driving, it's that I'm driving age. Pure cool. Hmm, seems like such a waste.    I remember once, when Amir was over at my house, his cell' phone had an internet connection, so we were at  urlLink Pick the Hottie , and we were discussing whether or not we should stay up all night. Amir asked what time it was, and I told him that it was six o'clock in the morning (I didn't actually say, "in the morning" because I think he realized that it was already the morning). He replied, "Everyone's going to come through here and make lots of noise and wake us up in two hours anyway, so we might as well stay up." I replied, "OK," turning back to the phone, "which one is hotter, first or second?" There was a pause. "Amir?"  That isn't the first time that happened either. Once, he and I were discussing how to go about writing a certain algorithm for a 3D engine, I asked him a question, and he replied, "Let me think with my eyes closed." Pause. "Amir?"  That's Amir for yeh.

      Dear Unpasteurized Readers  I've messed around with the template for this blog. I'm not a complete Javascript or HTML expert, in fact, I'll probably find out next week that I was actually programming in PHP or something. Heh heh, but seriously, if there are an display issues, please let me know and I'll revert it back to the regular template.  Sincerely, Andres

      I think I just discovered why people dance on the stage during a live performance. They don't want people to see what notes they're playing.  Take Noodles, from The Offspring, he must have lost his legs (maybe back when he was a janitor) and had them replaced with pogo sticks or something; because he just hops up and down throughout the song (or at least in all the videos I saw).  Do you want to know what I think? I think all bands play a reasonable chord when recording, but when it's time for the live show, they tune their guitars to something ridiculous like A G B D F Y and change the fingering around so that tabbers can't figure out what they're playing.  Modest Mouse, when playing  Bury Me with It  live, what one sees him play totally contradicts what one hears him play. Well at least there was a guy in the audience with a mohawk.

      When I grew up, I was the kid whose parents bought generic fruit soda while the other kids got the cool snacks and drinks; such as fruit-by-the-foot, coke (with its 36 tablespoons of sugar, or whatever it is), and the disgusting sugar packed marshmallow cereals for breakfast lunch and/or dinner. Who cares if they suffered from severe acne and nearly died when they were ten? It's not the girls I'm trying to attract-- actually, well yes it is. So, thank you mom and pop (yes, I call my dad 'pop'), you did the right thing.

      Here's my position on AIM Away Messages: I don't have one...  But I prefer the ones that have something funny in them. I don't really care where you went, just as long as I know you'll come back eventually. One thing though, people who put suicidal notes in their away message piss me off. Oh, or these people who think that it's acceptable to put a very personal message in a very public place like "I hate you, Griff! You're a fucking dirtbag and you should go to hell and bla bla bla PMS shit!" Or these people who make inside jokes in their away messages also get on my nerves. You check someone's info and you see "R U   GoNNa eAt ThE bUNnY? !? LOL. I krak mislf ^. gud tyms,,,, good tyms.,.,!?!" and the first thing I think is "Man, I'm embarrassed to even know this piece of sh -- I mean "person". Aside from blatantly disregarding anything she learned about punctuation, grammar, and spelling, she can't even type because those are commas, not periods. It's also not technically proper to use more than one punctuation at the end of a sentence. Also, What is up with these people who mix the caps? Not only do you waste time mixing them, you're making my life harder because I can't even read the sh -- shhhtufff (yeah, stuff) when it's like that. Sigh.   It's not like any of those idiots will ever read this so with that said, I'll break into some quick  7331 speak:  Hoo r u?! !> d0oD u sukd bgtym dat gam I ttly pwn'd u wen we wer plaeng u dnt std a chnc >| mi! !? !? I rxrz ur bxrz 2 hel,btch! ha ha, koknoker. u sux!   That was disgusting. I feel... dirty after even typing like that for 5 minutes. Sad part is that I've seen worse on bnet, much worse.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      I have come to the conclusion that soap, deep penetrating thingies, foams, exfoliators, astringents, and facial scrubs are only capable of going so far in terms of clearing up my acne. My theory is for me to really combat this problem I'd need to make a life-style change and we all know how I hate those. Now, as I've said before, I'm no chemist or biologist, but I think that my diet of ho-ho's, sugar'd popcorn, ramen, and shrek candies are my worst enemies at the moment. There are also reports of high Dorito and Lay's Stax consumption that may also be contributing to the problem. Well, instead of a real change in my lifestyle that would fix the problem, I think I'll just do the american thing and just settle with declaring war on it.    We, the people of Unpasteurized, declare an all out war on Acne!! We won't stop until every pimple is destroyed!   ... but we won't  actually  do anything about it.  That is all.         -- Feanor

      What’s with all this talk about unbiased information? Who the hell wants unbiased information? I don’t want to know the whole truth; I want to know part of it because there’s a significantly smaller amount of truth in the biased truth. How much information out there is biased towards Bush? Hmm? Not very much! Why read  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  (which actually adds up to millions) of articles out there against Bush? I mean, everybody and his brother, American or not, has written something against Bush. First of all, it seems like a time wasting subject anyway, so why waste time reading millions of things against Bush when you can read one thing for him? There you go, time saved on political crap, go to Chipotle and buy two burritos and hide them in the park outside my house (don’t worry, I’ll find them).

      Today I proved the evolution theory false, I took my fish out of the bowl, and it didn't turn into a monkey. To offer more proof, for you skeptical people, I put a grasshopper in the aquarium and he didn't turn into a fish. I'm surprised by my own genius, I can't believe that for so long people have believed the evolution theory and it is proven false by something so simple. On a related note, I need money for a new fish, if anyone would like to donate, leave the money anywhere in the new park that's still under construction outside my house. Don't worry, I'll find it, just make sure it smells like steak for my dog to detect it.

      Man, I'd be so lost. I guess I'd just do nice things for people, like teleport some pigeon turd that's about to land on a nice person's car to some dicksniffer's scalp. I might save some souls, possibly freak people out with voices in their heads. Throw a giant knife with a blade the size of the longest side of nebraska into the astrology council's main headquarters. I'd probably kill some evil fuckers too, but I would make it an easy death, ya know, something more painless than painful. All in all, while I think I'd be a nice god who would do a better job than the one we have in power now, I'd hate his job. It's kinda like the presidency of the United States; we could all do a better job than Ol' Dubya, but would any of us really want to spend 4 years in that shithole? I didn't think so.  ...  Well, maybe a masochist like me, but really, anyone else?  That is all.         -- Feanor

      This post has been in the making for more than a month (since June 26th), mostly because I didn't feel that it ended right, and that I didn't criticize enough games. If you have any games for me to criticize, please post a comment, or e-mail me or somethin'.      How many of the readers have played  Halo ? To those of you who have, so you're in a campaign with a teammate, and you have low health, so you have your teammate shoot you (or hit you on the back) so that you regenerate with full health, right? Imagine for a second, a S.W.A.T. team or military squad' of sorts performing this procedure and others that are performed in  Halo .     Sarge : OK, let's go.   John : Hold on, I'm low on health.   Sarge : Sigh, Pete' take John into that room away from anyone and shoot him. Make sure you use the plasma rifle; we can't waste any of that precious assault rifle ammo.   Pete' and John leave the room.    John   from the other room : I'm too good-looking to die!   Pete   from the other room : Sarge! John isn't regenerating! Are you sure there aren't any terrorists around?   Sarge : Sigh.   Pete : Did you just say 'sigh' sir?   Bill : "No Terrorists", ya had to open your mouth!   Sarge : Ugh, I hate hearing that line, I'm killing Bungie for it.       Another thing is Real-Time Strategies, the unit responses when you click on them. Man, they're so realistic, I bet Westwood talks to people from the army and asks them, "What do you say when your commander gives you an order?" And the guy replies, "I usually like to say 'This gun is heavy' over and over again. I never get tired of it."       The great thing was that  Command & Conquer  music. It was always great. No, seriously.       OK, I take that back. But the only time  Command &amp; Conquer  music  wasn't  good was when the composer thought that smooth jazz or island music would go well with napalm and hand grenades.       In  Red Alert  though, there were some ridiculous weapons. First of all, the unrealistic weapons such as chronominers and mirage tanks and that business (you know the game started out as 'what if Hitler was never born'?), but then there's the just plain stupid weapons like parabombs. You'd think they'd want to speed up the fall of a bomb, but Westwood, they think differently, they actually slowed it down. That might actually do something for spreading lots of bombs out on a windy day, but it barely does anything with only five bombs. And obliterates the concept of accuracy. Why not just make a bomb that whistles while it falls (like those footballs with John Elway on them) and has the words 'Sincerely, Dubya' painted on the nose instead?        "All I want in the next  Red Alert  is dolphins with fricken sonars on their heads, is that too much to ask for?"    (There actually were dolphins with sonars on their heads in  Red Alert 2 )       Original  Command & Conquer  (also known as 'Tiberian Dawn'), greatest game ever. Had many pros, like weird storyline, an intro', a sneak peak at all fifty games that Westwood was working on at once including  Tiberian Dawn 's sequel,  Tiberian Sun . Also had its cons, like extremely pixelated graphics; as a result, whenever the commando spat (which was his 'idle animation'), the spit was the same size as his head.        Sarge : Take that Daemia!   Daemia ate Sarge's rocket!    Sarge : What the hell?   Narrator : Three frag's left!   Sarge : Who said that?        Command & Conquer: Generals , the dozer, he says some pretty stupid things. "Made in the US of A." Seriously, who says the prepositions out in an acronym? If you say, "US of A" instead of "USA", why don't you say "As S as P" instead of "ASAP"? I actually am willing to bet you, that unless EA Pacific (formerly Westwood) reads this and foils my plan, they will have the dozer say, "As S as P" in the next  Generals .       Some day soon, a guy at EA Pacific is going to say, "We should have the Crusader tank say '10-4' whenever you tell him to go somewhere", and someone will reply, "Isn't that a truckers' thing?" "No. It's an army thing." And none of them will realize that Google is a just a few clicks a way.       Speaking of truckers, Modest Mouse wrote a song called  Trucker's Atlas , which inspired Amir to want to go into truckering for a little while after college. It'd be fun, if I could tag along, and program better games while we drive, see the  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions  (which actually adds up to trillions) of sights. The song is one of Modest Mouse's best, except it's really long; in fact, a trucker could probably go from Washington to Florida before it's over. But go hear it anyway.       Sometimes one looks at these games and each of its little details, and one thinks, "Man, someone was assigned to that task." Imagine working at Bungie and your boss says, "OK, you, you program the gun moving while the player's walking. And make it move  more  while running." Sometimes you can tell who did the programming too. Like in the  Tiberian Dawn , you can tell that the boss' five year-old programmed the harvester pathfinder (which, apparently, is different from the regular unit pathfinder); you can also tell that they used the same pathfinder in  Red Alert . We have reason to believe, however, that the chronominers (which automatically transport themselves back to the refinery) were invented because they didn't know how to program a better engine.       Just kidding, no offense EA Pacific.       What's ridiculous is games where explosive barrels are spread out across the base. In Doom 95, the barrels of explosive poison were actually strategically placed, as if they knew that they would accidentally open the gates of hell and there'd be a demon standing right there. Who hides behind a barrel anyway? Apparently when you go to hell you leave your brain behind.   Another thing Doom 95 had was pools of poison. Makes you wonder what the UAC really was doing on Mars. Maybe it was just a side project, rodent repellent or something.        "I'm sorry ma'am, your husband died; and his body melted into the ground so the graphics didn't get too laggy."      In  Civilization III , it's funny because what do you do to solve riots? Give them entertainment.       "As you can see, here in Boulder near CU, there's another riot of underage drinkers demanding alchohal. The police are taking a different route to stopping the crazy CU students, they're sending in the clowns. They figure, if it worked in Sid Meier's  Civilization III , it should work here. And the clowns have special flowers that shoot tear gas."       In WarCraft III it's funny, the entire orc horde consists of eight grunts.       I would try and mock The Sims and the way they talk, but that would just get me killed.       Maybe I should have gone for quality of joke, rather than quantity. Oh well, I'm not redoing this thing.

      If you're ever forced to go to a dance, for whatever reason, and you don't want to dance with anyone, here's a plan that (theoretically) won't fail:  Attach a remote-controlled buzzer to your mom (you can attach it to anyone, but for this example I will use your mom), and whenever someone asks you to dance, set off the buzzer and your mom will make some sort of noise; either of shock or of pain. At that point yell, "MOMMA!" and run to your mom, leaving the person asking you to dance behind you.  Of course, this plan probably won't work more than twice. But if more than two people ask you to dance, you should consider yourself lucky.

      There needs to be a limit on what can be advertised on TV. Tampons, diahorrea, breast enhancement, Viagra, and anything period-related, just to name a few.  First, the Viagra ad's are really annoying, but then when I have to explain to my little cousin why everyone is smiling, well that just makes it worse.  Tampons I hate when they say stuff like, "It's sooo comfortable. It's like riding a bike." And they have disgustingly detailed (yet still vague) illustrations.  Breast enhancement mostly just because it's awkward when my parents are in the room and it says, "Increase the size of your breasts in half an hour!"  And then I'm watchin' TV one day with my family, then comes on this ad' with three girls at a beach and one says, "You're wearing a bikini during your period?" Then it goes into a series of things like, "Aren't you worried about bloating..." UUUGGGHHHH.  Now, those Geico ad's, those are funny. Like the one with the gecko doing the robot. Or the one that looks like a soap opera, and the guy says, "I've got some good news." Then the girl responds, "You broke up with Jessica?" "No, I just saved over 15% on my car insurance," she walks away, "I saved! I thought that meant something to you!"

      Those of you who like to eat ice during the summer because "It's refreshing," be warned: eating ice takes the enamel off your teeth.  And when you bite into ice cream with your two front teeth, every single person of the six billion on the entire planet will laugh at the expression on your face all at once and the noise will be so loud the vibrations will start earthquakes and destroy all of the major cities, and all of the minor cities, and pretty much anything really, and all the tall buildings on the planet will fall and since there are more tall buildings in New York City than anywhere else, when they all fall, the entire planet will be thrown out of orbit in the opposite direction of New York City and we'll be floating in space until either we: a) freeze or b) fly into a star or another planet  And  that  won't be very refreshing.  Stop eating ice.

      You know what'd be funny? If there were these two spies, and they put this tracking device on this guy, and they're tracking him via their spiffy computer equipment, and he's not moving, and one spy says to the other, "Where'd you put the device?" and the other replies, "On his shirt, why?" "Did you ever think, while you were doing it, that maybe he would eventually change his shirt and the device would come off with it?"

Bob : "Remember in science class, when Mr. Vierling was talking about the diameter of the earth?"  Me : "Well obviously not, because I wouldn't be asking you now if I knew what it was."  Bob : "'Member in that movie with Tom Hanks? They were arguing about the diameter of the earth."  Me : "Do you know the diameter or don't you?"  Bob : "And they were talking about how the diameter from pole to pole is smaller than the diameter from equator to-- other equator."  Me : "Just tell me the damn diameter!"  Bob : "7,800 miles."  Me : "Thank you!"  Exeunt   And then there are the people who are overly paranoid.   Me : "What's the diameter of the earth?"  Bob : "Why, what have you heard?"  Exeunt   P.S. As far as I know, there wasn't a movie in which Tom Hanks was talking about the diameter of the earth.

      I bet he comes on sometimes and just reads 'em for kicks. Not that his omniscient self doesn't know what he's reading before he "sees" (with his entirely intangible being) the word, but he might, like, focus on it and just laugh. Then again, how would an intangible being do something like laugh? Isn't laughter something that is by definition a certain physical expression of a certain emotion? Maybe Jesus laughs (as opposed to the father or the holy spirit) o.O, but that's only plausible if you believe in that whole holy trinity thing. Even if he couldn't express his "feelings", that doesn't necessarily mean that he can't be aware of it. I confused myself and forgot my point... again. Fuck.  That is all. -- Feanor

      Every war movie  absolutely must  have a scene where mud is flying everywhere from mines and bombs and such, and there's this guy who's squinting from dust everywhere, then his face straightens out as if he had suddenly realized tht everyone around him is dying and he's trying to find some profound, sentimental sort of thing to think. And then the carnage is showed in slow motion, and there's some slow sort of choral type of music, or else a single violin playing slow, slow scales; and everything's quiet except for echoes. And the echoes don't just echo anything, it's selective echoing; When the main character, who's really buff, stubs his toe, it echoes for five minutes, and they show the look of pain on his face, but when a generic private gets his head blow up by a friendly artillery shell, there's not a sound.   If I ever was in a battle, I'd wear a handlebar mustache and a bushy wig. I figure we'd all have a laugh, a couple cold beers (or the beverage in fashion for that particular time and place at whatever temperature it tastes best at).

      My theory is that because 'septic' sounds like the Latin word 'septem', it must be related. It probably was the word for "The seventh element". If you forgot what the other elements are, they're Water, Wind, Earth, Fire, Love, and The Abilitiy to See Dead People.

      So, I was walking from the Kendall T Stop here in Boston to this pizza place called Emma's, which is really good, by the way. And I see this sign that reads something like "Lost Cat. Reward $600". The first thing I thought was damn, that's a lot of money. Then I thought, aww, what a cute cat. Then I thought, my cat's not really cute at all, she's old and fat and balding and getting stupid and mean. I would probably pay less than $50 reward for her. For 600 bucks, someone might actually spend time to look for a cat like that... Then it hit me!  Why not make semi-absurd sign that offers a massive, but realistic reward for something either incredibly common or incredibly hard to find. And so I visualized this sign in my head that read something like "lost possum. $300 reward" and I started giggling to myself after imagining a guy looking for a possum to bring me for his $300. What a fool he would be. Then my thoughts grew more humorous, to me anyway, and I began to think about putting Lost [x] signs up for things that are by definition fixed. Like "Lost Oak Tree. Last seen on the corner of Arlington and Main. Has 'I [heart] Shirley carved in bark' and 'Scott & Tiffany forever' etched inside a heart on the other side. Reward $400 cash." And then I would have the whole thing set up with a hole in the grass on one of the corners of the intersection about the size of a tree's trunk. Oh, how fun that would be. I mean, beyond a certain extent, it's not very funny, but I think it'd be very funny to see a Lost [x] picture like that... Or where the reward was something useless like "Reward 30 Twinkies" or something.  This was a waste of time, but it made me giggle. On an unrelated side-note, on that trip to Emma's, I found a 20 dollar bill lying on the ground and had a hard time deciding whether or not to take it. I ended up taking it after my dad said "God, Feanor, just pick up the damn money. Finder's keepers in these situations. If you don't pick it up, someone else will. It's not like the guy will come back and get it." That was 110% irrelevant.  That is all. -- Feanor

       Spiderman 2  at the 50 cent theatre, nothing better. Major plot spoiler:  Spiderman dies!   You see, Spiderman, along with his webspinning and wall climbing abilities, he also aquired the ability to bite people and turn them into spidermans (or spidermen, whatever) too. Kinda like a Count Parker. Near the end, Spiderman goes to a Lakers game with Mary-Jane, and after they win, Spiderman bites Shaq on the neck. "Doc Ock" picks up a gun and aims it at Spiderman. Spiderman (or 'Spiderman' as I like to call him) uses his web to spin himself a bullet proof suit, but he spends too much on the crotch support and Doc Ock shoots him. I know what you're thinking, "But Spiderman didn't die in any of the comics, therefore he's immortal!" Don't send e-mails with lots of swear-words to the messenger, I'm just telling you what I saw. Oh, and Mary-Joe gets married (get it?!?1 MARYd?! HAHA I KRAK MISELF ^!!?!?1.,.,111tgvags).  Also, it's fun to read the credits at the end because sometimes they have really funny names. Like there's this guy in special effects, his name was Dr. Krakohedovich, and everyone cracked up as soon as they saw the name-- I mean, what doctor goes into special effects?! Haha! BTW, does anyone know who played Bobby-Joe?  Good news though, there's going to be a  Spiderman 3  and Shaq's in it!  Sincerely, Andresman  P.S. i wundr if spydrman nos how 2 swingdance (get it?!?! SWING!!?! i MadE A JOke!?!?!1!?,.  P.P.S. From now on, I shall no longer known as 'Peter Pan', I am 'Peter Parker'.  P.P.P.S. Why was the burrito place closed? Fourth of July doesn't apply to Mexicans-- but I guess if I follow that logic, I shouldn't take the day off either, I'm British/Chinese.

      When you're not satisfied with a non-profit organization's services, saying "I'll just take my money elsewhere" doesn't really work.

      I'm going to start a new acronym to be used in IM app's like AIM, the acronym shall be LIQ ( L aughing  I n  Q uiet). It shall be used either for those laughs where it's not really a laugh, it's just a puff of air generally interpretted as laughter ("heh heh heh"); or those laughs where you're laughing on the inside. Basically you're not really laughing, you're just saying to yourself, "That was a good joke."    As well, I'm going to go up to someone, ask them, "Do you know what 'ASAP' stands for?" they'll reply, "As soon as possible," and I'll say, "Just a simple 'yes' or 'no' will do." Then walk away.    I've never been good at threatening people, so, until recently, whenever it came time for a threat, I would just use someone else's threat. Well "Expect a beating from a certain girl with short hair and glasses" isn't a great threat it turns out. I thought it was good when Megan used, I don' know why it worked then and not now.

      I just got back from a birthday dance. It was fun, I danced with a total of three girls, I danced about six times, for a grand total of two moves (swing basic, waltz basic). After quite a while came the time for the cake, they turned down the lights, Pat asked, "Why are they turning the lights down?" I was tempted to say, "So the ugly girls have a chance to dance," but I figured I probably shouldn't. They weren't any ugly girls there anyway; it's bad enough to call an ugly girl ugly, but to call a pretty girl ugly...  While I was standing outside, George, the brother of Margie (the birthday girl) came outside and said, "I hate it when that happens!" I said, "What?" He said, "I got a burrito in my pants." I looked at his knees and there was a lump and a wet spot from the sour cream and salsa. What's funny is that he said it as if it's happened before.  At the house they had some pictures of Bush dressed up as a fighter pilot with some real pilots, and the first thing Charlie notices is that they're all wearing cups. I think wearing cups is a perfectly reasonable thing-- what, with all the triple a's and the missiles flying at you all the time, you need some protection*. You don't want a SAM, or God forbid, a SCUD (just in case you accidentally hit one on the way) in that particular part. Plus, according to movies, the joystick is right in that special spot; if you slam on the brakes really quickly, that would hurt.   *"Ma'am, you husband was shot down, this is all we recovered of him."

      If someone with multiple personalities gets caught just before trying to commit suicide, he should be charged with homicide, rather than suicide.

      Why did they pick arrows to go with bows? If you put a row of weapons out consisting of a sword, an arrow, and a flail, we all know the person will go for the sword or flail. Most likely the sword. Why? Because it does more damage. So why not fire swords out of bows?

      Here's something that will get you thinking (as if anything doesn't get something moving in one's brain): Are you being sarcastic, or sarcastically being?

      Next time I hear someone play an instrument before me, when they've finished I'm going to say, "You're really good." Then later, if they ever bring it up again, maybe say to their friends, "[Insert my name here] thinks I'm good at the piano," I'll just say, "It was a metaphor."
