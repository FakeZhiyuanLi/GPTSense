      Well part of the Oberweis crew invaded 6-flags yesterday.  It was a lot of fun, however nothing too exciting or out of the ordinary.  It's the same as it is everytime I go there.  One kid had never been on a roller coaster before...we had fun with him hehe.   Damn I gotta work today in the morning, AND its wednesday so that means all the seniors are coming in for their 10% discount which they're all bitchy about.  Yes that's right...old people can be bitchy.  One lady comes in and puts 4 milk bottles on the counter and says to me with this mean raspy voice "brought 4 taking 4 senior!" I'm sick of people.  And here's a bit of advice for you all: don't get mad at anyone who is just doing their job unless you have a damn good reason to.   I know how they feel and it sucks.  And everyone needs to learn to be patient again.  I'm sick of people who get so used to fast food and fast everything that they get lazy and get pissed when their food doesnt get to them in less then a min.  I mean that's why you go to Oberweis...you get a product that is "simply the best."  I'd know that even if I didn't work there.  We're not Dairy Queen, and for a good reason.  People can just learn to wait for their food.  So if youre one of those impatient people, just calm down and realise they are doing their job and trying to go as fast as they can.  Remember, don't get pissed unless you have a DAMN good reason to.  :)   Well anyways, looks like I'll have a nice afternoon with Pati at the mall today.  I can't wait!!!  See y'all later.

      I'm kinda hoping people will come to my party and the air and water show.  You know ive never had people over at my house for a bonfire or anything like that.  nows the time.  Ok enough about that....It's still been a boring few days. Especially without that special someone ;)   I get to go to 6 flags with the oberweis crew...itll be fun.  i cant wait and i wish i could bring you guys with.   ahhh parents waking up..gotta go.

Ok im dead tired. gnight everyone.

      YAY O'HARE!!! I love that place...I'm sorry.  I just went there to pick up my dad and I swear to God I was on this high.  I was aplauding to like every plane that took off right by me.  It was so exciting so hey if anyone ever needs a ride home from the airport - you know who to call. :)   Well now that I've come down off of this high and am now in withdrawl, I'm sleepy and depressed at what this weakend is going to hold for me - nothing.  Well...work of course.  I probably won't get to see anybody cause everyone is always very busy on the weekends and then I work the only open time of the day for people.  The excpetion is Sunday though.  I get off of work at 5 so how exciting is that?!?  I get to go party on the weekend for once.  Lets just hope someone wants to do something.  Oh and for the 2 other people that realise I have a blog again, I have one request...don't forget about this.  Thanks you guys....I'm outta here.

      Yeah that's how my 13 year old sister writes.  It gives me a headache to read and to type.  Ok I'm blogging again.  Hey it'll be funny.  Today's been a good day...filled with work however.  I can't write to much today.  I'll be back when I have some time.  Oh yeah - go to Oberweis and buy smoothies!  (Another contest)  and by the way thanks to everyone who bought something with 2 scoops in it during the month of July.  Schaumburg Oberweis is undefeated!

      Okay, so these are my rough drafts... they're not as clean as i'd like. But hey, i took screen shots of them from the dvd. Tell me what you think? Be gentle, and remember... these are our senior band shirts. Lets make it good. Any input is good input, my creativeness is dry. (I've changed them a few times. mix and match if you will.) Hopefuly ha, you have enough choices.     A)   urlLink    Front. And actual shirt i believe... i just changed it around a bit.   B)   urlLink    Front. Alone on the Front?   OR     C)   urlLink    Front.   D)   urlLink    Back.   OR   E)   urlLink    Front. (Revised)   F)   urlLink    Back. (Revised)

      Hey guys...the last summer breeze concert is August 21st, a saturday, and I got recruited to sell food there because of SYO.  I'm pretty sure that Frank Winkler and the Symphonic Pops are the folks performing.  It's a 35 piece ensemble with vocalists that perform "broadway hits, popular songs, and light classics."  Should be fun, so if you guys want to come out and see it and buy some popcorn from me, go for it.  I'll be wanting the company.  Hopefully this will beat AC Rock or whatever and their one die-hard fan, the man-with-no-rhythm. ;)

       Hi, my name is Anthony and im a recovering, just kidding everybody. It's Anthony and if anyone cares i joined this blog, because i was invited. I wrote this because i figured i should post something but had nothing interesting to say. So woohoo to band camp in, o, about six days right? Speaking of band camp, any word on that (unscramble this) egk of cream soda? Well i'll hopefully post something more interesting later.

      Hey guys!  I just joined this bloggy thing.  It finally worked after the 10th time!  So, today I went school supply shopping, and I bought weird folders and notebooks.  Walmart has really gone down the drain, it's a scary place to be in.  And why do little kid shoes have to be so cool?  They don't come in my size. =(.  I also bought the new Usher CD.  Alright, the end.

      Okay, i'm only doing this because i love you all. And i'm starting to hate Internet Explorer.  Brief explanation: Mozilla  urlLink Firefox  is a kick ass program that totally replaces internet explorer. Its an internet browser that is bigger and better, and probaly will be bought out soon by microsoft. It doesn't have those bugs and weaknesses that IE has, and has cool  urlLink extensions  and  urlLink themes .  Ha, no i'm not trying to be a spokesman, er spokeswoman, but it's a really cool  FREE  program that i figured some of yous might enjoy. I mean cmon, you can do little mouse gestures! And you can get tabs. Some sites do look weird under it because of coding... like my own. But most places are making sites towards Firefox instead of IE. Hell yea.  Well i'm done.  Have a nice day yo.

And I'm thinking a $10 buy-in so we can go 60/20 to first and second place or if there is 10 players 70/30.   C'mon, don't be shy, it's only money, you'll make more!

      Well, Pati Ryan Jen and I went to go play tennis, and now I have to tell everyone that I lost both in singles and in doubles.  I blame it on my rusty backhand, plus the box to serve into turned into half the court!  We should make a big tennis tournament before the summer's end.  Well, Im out of interesting stuff to say.

      So it has come to my attention that everybody on the "contributors" list, do in fact, have one thing in common. Needless to say, i kinda did it with that  not  in mind... i mean i didn't mean for the big bad blog to be, a big bad band blog. Band is cool, of course, but we def don't need to center the b-l-o-g around it. Take out band in our life, we're still people. Cool people at that too.  Right?  Anyhow, i have yet to find my original cool yellow Maroon 5 cd that seriously rocked. So out of despair before the M5 concert, i gave in and burned a measley little cd. I think that qualifies for "finding it".  But congrats jess :)  Tennis, tennis tennis. I wish the sport was as cool as it was freshmen year as it is now. Haha, i felt so dorky playing it then .... but now its all good. Because now all the cool people are playin'.  And yes, ryan we challenge you. (by the way,  what is statuatory? anyone? yes point and laugh, i'm just dumb... and not dirty! besides, i'd rather ask here then... in person.)

      Pati! I found my Maroon 5 CD! Rejoice! :) Have you found yours yet?  Ryan, you're sick. But I do have to admit, I'd feel much cooler marching with the drumline during halftime than lugging my mellophone around. (Don't tell the rest of the section!) Oh yeah, and Pati and I would like to challenge you at tennis...right Pati? You up for it, Spartacus??

      What a bunch of band dorks.  I'm glad the drumline likes to think of itself as a seperate entity.  In fact, we are, because, frankly, we are better.  And here is why.  We.... -Booty Dance with eachother -Haze -Have an average gpa of 2 -Play porn grooves on our instruments -Yell out disgusting inside jokes in our cadences -Like Statutory -Have new sideline cadences called "Thrust," "Sea men," and "Climax" -Play up to tempo -Bother drum majors -Eat a lot -Practice the most (eat that shit dan george)  And if that isn't enough to turn you off, here is a turn-on...  We have Alex Miller, the human sex machine and chick magnet, on the snare line.  That's all, have a good day, losers in other sections.

Nice thinkin Pati ;)  And while most of us are bandos, I might as well ask...whatever happened to making those shirts that say "Get Tippsy, it's Millertime" for band camp?  Are we makin em or  what ?

       Oh jeeze another place to blog. This is just feeding my addiction. But kudos to Pati for getting this thing started! I'm sure this thing will be as big and bad as the title implies. :)

      Wow, well here we go. Lets cross our little fingers and hope that someone will find this amusing, be it ourselves.  I guess first of all, you can thank dan for this stroke of genius, he got my wheels workin'.  Anyhow, an explanation:  I've invited several of my close friends into one singular blog.  The whole concept of it is like wow... is this stupid or brilliant. But anyways. This ain't no small blog. 11 people as of now are invited, and if you or know of anyone else that is interested... just let me know. If you barely come online, or live in the chair in front of your computer, i guess you can just feel free to blog a little somthin' somethin'.  I really have no expectations.  And, please, knock yourselves out.
