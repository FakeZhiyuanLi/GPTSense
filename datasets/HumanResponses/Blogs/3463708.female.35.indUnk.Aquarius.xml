      Insomnia is a bitch.    I woke up at approximately 3:00 am and now it's 5:00 am.  The big question - Do I bother to try to go to sleep again when I have to get up in a couple of hours anyway??    My usual pattern is that I'll fall into my eventual slumber, say 45 minutes before I have to wake up.  I don't know why, but that 45 minutes is a very restful sleep. It's like the sleep fairies are teasing me by giving me a little snippet of the sleep I'm missing only to pluck it away right from under me.  Curses to them!  It's probably not wise to curse a fairy, but oh well....  It probably doesn't help my sleeping cause to watch t.v. at this hour, but I do it anyway.  The other options don't work or don't appeal.  Counting sheep makes me wonder who came up with the idea of counting sheep and why sheep anyway?  I mean, couldn't I just as easily count kangaroos?  What if I have an aversion to sheep... I mean, I don't, but what if... And if sheep had insomnia and could count, would they count people?  Do they even know the concept of people?  I mean, they don't associate a person  with the word, but do they know a person is not one of them?  Never mind.. rambling musings brought on by sleep deprivation... Anyway, these are the things I think about when I'm supposed to be counting sheep.  Warm milk?  I'm lactose intolerant, so that's not an option.  Besides, who would want their milk warm??  Blach!  Reading?  Nah....  So what's left?  Infomercials!!  Some infomercials are rather engaging.  I have a question about infomercials/paid programming.  Now, excuse me if this sounds insensitive, but what makes the starving children bloated?  Forgive me for my ignorance, but are they retaining water?  What is in their little tummies that makes them so bloated?  Just one of my thoughts when plagued by insomnia....  The informerical I particularly enjoy is the one about enhanced sexual performance.  That one is for men that, shall we say, make it out of the blocks okay but can't quite run the full lap, if you know what I mean.  It is a talk show format with a bunch of women detailing their husband's/boyfriend's poor performance in bed.  Now, I'm sure these women are paid actors, but dont'cha think it still makes their men wonder?  And if they are paid actors isn't that false advertising?  And isn't it strange how you can live your entire life just as content as can be, watch an infomercial, then realize that you  have  to buy the antioxidant detoxifier thigamajig immediately or else you will die?  I didn't know it, but I  must  have the speed reading kit post haste!    Well, I gotta go, there's a Hoover Outdoor Indoor Spin Sweep calling my name.....

      How could it be that I have the cutest little smushible dog in the world?? I don't know but I do (a purely objective opinion, I might add).    Tyson is a five year old, tan and black Yorkshire Terrier.  I was really worried when I got him because he came from a puppy mill and his parents looked scruffy and not-so-cute.  Shortly after I got him, I took him to the vet and he had lice!!!  EWWWWW!!  He was on his way out the door after that, but, somehow, this little lice infested puppy started tugging on my heart strings and I decided he could stay.  I treated him with human lice shampoo, which was strongly discouraged by the vet since he was such a young pup, but we were talking about LICE here!  Needless to say, the shampoo worked and he lived.  Like any relationship, Tyson and I have our problems.  He's a little to clingy for my taste, but the good outweighs the bad.  I'm sure that my shortcomings annoy him as well, for instance, our play time is entirely too short from his point of view and the doggy treats need a more consistent distribution, but I'm working on it.....

      Fahrenheit 911 is awesome!  I can't begin to explain the significance of this film, as I can't do  it justice.  Will this film change the mind of those on the right?  Hardly!  Will it re-confirm the opinions on the left?  Absolutely!    If you have misgivings about the war in Iraq.... If you are uncertain about who to vote for in the upcoming presidential election, I  implore  you to check out this movie!!

      Seriously, can a girl get a mother-grabbing advisory of some kind before being confronted by graphic images??  So, I'm watching "I Lost It" on the Discovery Health channel.  It's a show detailing amazing weight loss stories and I just LOVE that show.  I'm absolutely addicted to these self improvement/makeover shows.  I also love the show "Buff Brides."  That's a show about two women trying desperately to lose weight before their wedding days.  But, anyway, I digress.  What I've learned is that if you are a squeamish person, you should probably refrain from watching the Discovery Health channel.  I am a VERY squeamish person, so I stay away from the surgery shows and such.  Now I'm learning that the commercials are just as graphic......   In one commercial in particular, they showed a person that had no face.  This poor individual just had this open mound of flesh and no skin at all.  As if that was not bad enough, they show a face and scalp UNATTACHED from a person.  NO LIE.  A headless face and a faceless head.  I could not believe it.  The face was just sitting there all raggedy and sprawled about a metal table.  This commercial was for a face transplant show.  I had no idea there was such a thing as a face transplant, but apparently there is.  Now, while I would LOVE to have Halle's face, I would never want to HAVE it!!  EWWWWW!!  And who would be a donor for a face transplant?  I guess face donation would be similar to organ donation in that you donate in the event that you don't need it anymore.  Can you imagine someone else was walking around with your loved ones face??  That is just too bizarre.  I just hope that this procedure is for extreme situations and not the latest in cosmetic surgery.....

      Sloth - (noun) Etymology: Middle English sloth, from slow 1 a : disinclination to action or labor : INDOLENCE b : spiritual apathy and inactivity  .  Today I heard about a new technology that allows you to operate your television using your voice - a voice activated remote control.  Now I understand how this could be a very helpful device for an individual with special needs, but, good gracious, is it now too tedious and grueling to press a few buttons?  Remember the days when you'd actually have to get your ass up, walk over to the television and turn the little dial?  If we had to do that nowadays, we'd just give up watching television altogether or we'd keep it on the same station all the time.  And with this voice activated remote control, what happens to whole the ritual of fighting over the remote control?  Hey! This might give women some input in television viewing habits.  Maybe this isn't such a bad thing after all...   And what about those robotic vacuum cleaners?  You don't even have to vacuum anymore with that gizmo.  Remember the days before the upright vacuum?  Lugging around the contraption and trying to find the right little attachment for the vacuum hose was a chore in itself! Then, inevitably, all the little attachments would get lost and you would have to vacuum using only the hose.  Yes, it was ghetto, but don't act like you don't know!  Okay, I guess I've successfully dated myself now.....

      Cacophony - ca·coph·o·ny (noun) Inflected Form(s): plural -nies : harsh or discordant sound : DISSONANCE 2; specifically : harshness in the sound of words or phrases.  I consider myself an informed person. In fact, I'm somewhat of a news junkie. I am a liberal, but I do tune in to conservative talk radio on a regular basis. I try to be objective and discriminating when it comes to current events and politics.  Having said all that, I think I've reached my threshold of tolerance for all things "newsworthy/political." It's all bullshit anyway. The talk show hosts on the left (what few there are) are beholden to the Democrats, thus all things conservative are blatant untruths, and the right is beholden to the Republicans and hold similar unflattering views of the left.  I guess this is nothing new under the sun, but it is really getting on my nerves lately. Fair and balanced? I think not. No spin? Hardly! And don't get me started w/the main stream media. Yeesh!  And just to think, five months until November....

      I've been thinking about the origin of drinking cow milk.  Now, it is logical and biological that a baby drinks from her lactating mother's teat (I've wanted an occasion to say "teat"), but how did the first human realize that cow milk was not only safe for human consumption, but also (arguably) tasty?  Now this is all  moo t, to me since I am lactose intolerant. :)  I have the same question about eggs.  Again, who was that man (or woman) that made that initial decision to take an egg that come's out of a chicken's butt and make it a meal?  Speaking of chickens, that gets me to wondering how they reproduce.  I did some research and this is what I found:  How do chickens reproduce?  Answer:  Chickens reproduce in a manner similar to some other animals.  The female produces an egg which if fertilized can result in a baby chick.  The true egg, the part that develops into the embryo, is located on the egg yolk.  The yolk begins to develop in the ovary and after 10-12 days of development, ovulation occurs.  If the female has been mating with a male, sperm will be present and fertilization can occur.  The male chicken does not have a penis and therefore there is no penetration of the female reproductive tract at the time of mating.  Instead the female inverts the cloaca (site of the common junction of the reproductive and digestive systems) which comes in contact with the maleÂs inverted cloaca and receives the sperm.  The cloaca is then drawn back into the henÂs body and the sperm are captured. They then begin the journey up the length of the reproductive system.  The sperm live inside the female reproductive system and each time an ovulation occurs (every 24-26 hours in good egg producers) the egg can become fertile.  This process continues and matings at 7 - 10 day intervals are necessary to maintain fertility.  After fertilization occurs the egg albumen, shell membranes, and shell are added to complete the egg formation process.  The chicken usually lays the egg about 24 hours after ovulation.

      Here is a working list of (some) of the things that give me the heebeegeebees.  They are not listed in any particular order and, yes, I know that they are irrational.  1.  Being barefoot (especially in grass). 2.  Being in the company of birds (not any particular kind, just birds in general). 3.  Encountering sweaty butt imprints on the exercise machines at the gym. 4.  Eating finger foods without washing my hands. 5.  Touching public railings. 6.  Touching raw meat. 7.  Using a port-a-potty.   I'm sure that there are many more that I cannot think of right now, and, yes, I realize that this list indicates a raging case of OCD.  I'm not to the extreme where I can't do these things, but these are some of the things that freak me out a little......

      The season finale of the Sopranos was last Sunday, so this is my first Sunday without the Sopranos (again).  They sure go on hiatus for a long ass time.  I guess I won't see Tony and the crew for awhile.  First they took away my "Sex,"  and now my Sopranos.  What is a girl to do?  Well the first thing I'm going to do is review the finale....  I'd have to give the finale a B.  Now, let me say this, a bad to fair episode of Sopranos is better than a good episode of any other dramatic show on television, in my opinion.  The acting and dialogue are just superb and realistic.  I've never been privy to the inner workings of a mob family, but I would imagine it would be just like it plays out on the Sopranos.  Some very important things happened in this episode, the arrest of Johnny Sack, Tony re-emerging as a strong leader in the eyes of his crew and winning back the heart of Carmela, Tony taking out Tony B, and of course Tony's ever-present inner turmoil and guilt for the path he has chosen.    Though the episode was very good, I wouldn't call it great.  Notably, I would have liked to have seen Aid killed off in the finale and Tony B. in the next to the last episode.  I know that the story line between Tony B. and Tony was important, but Tony B. was just with us this season.  Though I liked the character of Tony B. and Buscemi one fine actor, I was not emotionally attached to him so it wasn't that big of a deal when he died.  Though Aidriana was being pressured by the feds and we knew it was a matter of time before she'd be sleeping with the fishes, I think her death had more of a impact since she was regular fixture on the show since its infancy.    And can I just say that there is something very appealing about Tony Soprano??  Now, he's a bald, fat guy with a voice like Bugs Bunny, but there is just something about him that makes a girl sit up and take notice......  Until the next, and some say final, season of the Sopranos begins I'll be waiting in anticipation of what is to come..

      I so want to be a professional blogger, but I don't have anything interesting to say.  I read other blogs and they are so funny and witty.    Maybe I should change my name from Anita Write to Wanna Write.....

      I like the little country town I call home.  You know the Country Time commercials?  The ones with the lazy summer afternoons?  The ones with the kids swinging from the tire just above a cool stream?  I am lucky enough to live in a Country Time type of town.    Things are just so laid back in my little town. Old ladies stop to chat at the grocery store, people sit leisurely on their front porches as they watch people pass by, and you are guaranteed fresh produce at the Farmer's Market on Thursdays.  Need to vote in the election or make a trip to the DMV?  In my town there are no long lines.    Things feel safer in this little country town.  There is a trust amongst the locals that is innocent and unique.  There are charming little shops with antiques and crafts, and there is no meaning to the term "gridlock."  In my town there are no high rises or subways; instead we have green pastures and wheat fields.  It is not uncommon to see a John Deere tractor making its way down the road, or teenagers venturing about on their three wheelers.    Forgive me for sounding boastful, but there is something to be said for the country life....

      I don't like pretty boys.  What bothers me even more are pretty and/or effeminate actors playing "macho" characters in movies.  That is just false advertising....  Now, I know what I am saying is politically incorrect, but, aside from some exceptions, there are gender differences that are inherent in us.  These differences should be celebrated and embraced, not challenged and compromised.    With the emergence of the metro-sexual and a generation of men that grew up with a heightened sense of femininity, the line between gender differences has been blurred.    Take, for instance, Tobey Macguire (sp?) as Spider Man.  To me, the image of Spider Man and other super heroes is one of a virile, masculine man who swoops in at a moment's notice to save the damsel in distress (again, I acknowledge my blatant political incorrectness).  I'm sorry but, for me, Tobey Macguire does not conjure up images of masculinity, chivalry, or even safety.  It is not Tobey that I would want to be arm in arm with if confronted by danger in a dark alley.  I feel the same way about Tom, Brad (though he has a nice body, but he's too pretty), Orlando, or Leonardo.  Now I know this is just a matter of taste, but those men just don't do it for me.  That is not to say that ultra-macho, testosterone driven, sloppy, rude men appeal to me either.  Additionally, steroid injecting muscle heads don't do it for me either.    So now that I've ruled out the majority of Hollywood actors, just who  would  fit the bill?  Denzel Washington is the epitome of a manly man in my opinion.  He's not too macho, nor is he at all squishy.  Though he does look good, he doesn't seem the type to constantly be in the mirror or using up all of his woman's beauty products.  He's clean cut, looks capable of protecting himself and his date on the mean streets, and he also looks like he can change a tire or two.    Now, to me, that's a  real  man!

      This is a working list of the things I take delight in at the moment.  How cool is it......  1.  That Prince is actually popular again?  Of course Prince was popular to me  PRE  Purple Rain.  I'm talking  I Want to Be Your Lover ,  Controversy ,  Lady Cab Driver  days.  It's so refreshing that a musician with actual talent that actually knows how to play instruments is on the charts again, as opposed to the manufactured-no talent-bubble gum- "artists" that are so prevalent now.  Alicia Keys has the Prince kind of talent, but she is definitely a throw back...  2.  That kids are so color-blind and oblivious to other non-essential differences?  The kids in my neighborhood, I'm talking the 4 - 6 year olds, black, white and Hispanic, boys and girls play so well together and are the best of friends.  I wish we could take just a smidgen of the kindheartedness within them and distribute it throughout the world....   3.  That we live in a country were we are free to pursue our dreams, practice our preferred beliefs, and oppose our government without threats of imprisonment and death?  The United States is, by no means, fault-free but in spite of all of our mistakes, we are afforded privledges that other people can only dream of....  4.  That flip flops come in such cute styles and colors now?  Flip flops have always been a very comfy shoe alternative, but the new variations in color and style bring joy to my heart.....  5.  That we don't have to worry about rewinding the movie before we return it?  Thanks to DVDs, you just pop that bad boy back into its case and you're good to go.....  If you think about it, one need only look to the small things to appreciate life.
