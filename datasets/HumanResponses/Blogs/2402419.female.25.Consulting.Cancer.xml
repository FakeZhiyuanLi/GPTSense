      got a call back today...only have to get passed the head honcho and i'm in.  i'm so crossing my fingers.  hopefully i get it.    CONGRATULATIONS to my best friend JENNY and her man MARK.  they're tying the knot on November 4th.  can't wait to go to Vegas :)!  heard something today but i won't go in-depth.  all i have to say is stupidity and selfishness play majors roles in the situation.  before you get into stupid shit, think about who you're going to affect in the end.  change...for the love of god...CHANGE.  if not for you, for someone who's stuck with you for life.  they never asked for that kind of shit, and they certainly don't deserve it either.

      So it's the day after Christmas.  I must say, I had a good one considering recent events.  Even if I wasn't fully happy, I forced myself to be.  It's Christmas and my grandma's birthday.  Whatever went down two weeks ago is nothing compared to what other people out there are going through.  My appetite still hasn't fully returned to normal, but I still ate.  Not too much, but more than usual.  Actually, I drank more than ate.  Danielle and I had one and a half bottles of champagne to ourselves.  I had a shot of Scotch too.  I didn't get drunk though.  That was the funny part.  I had a nice buzz going, but that was it.  Actually, I don't think I was even buzzed.  I think I was just exhausted.  Christmas Day I got a call from John.  We talked for about ten minutes or so.  Oddly enough, there weren't any uncomfortable silences.  If you ever come across this, thank you for the Mikimoto Pearl Earrings by the way.  Your gift will be on it's way soon.  Thanks for that and for the phone call...it was great hearing from you.  Other gifts I got were two shirts, a sweater, a set of professional makeup brushes, and $50, hehe.  Anyways, nighty night all.  I have to wake up bright and early tomorrow.

      alright, so i'm kind of stoked for the new year.  new year, new experiences, new challenges, new goals.  speaking of goals...i'm definitely fulfilling mine within the next five years.  come rain or shine...even if i have to die trying (knock on wood will yah?!).  i have the two years planned out already.  1. SAVE UP MONEY 2. JOIN THE MILITARY 3. GET COMMISSIONED 4. MOVE TO EUROPE OR HAWAII 5. GET MORE PHYSICALLY FIT  i figure that by 30 i'll be settled.  hopefully i'm a mother before 30.  i want three, but i'll settle for whatever God gives me.  but yeah...hopefully before 30.  it's hard to have a child after 30.  they say 35, but i still think it's pretty risky around 30.  the complications and risks are higher for both myself and my unborn child.  and i don't want to have to do amnios.  have you guys ever seen the needle for that?  that's fucking crazy!  but hey, even if i'm not blessed to have a child i will adopt.  so does all this sound like a plan?  i think so!

      i'm so wishing that i was a member of the brunei royal family right now.  aw hell, i'll even settle for bill gates' position.  i don't think they gained all that fortune simply by hard work alone.  good luck has to play a major part in all that too right?  well hell...rub some of that good luck my way you stingy bastards!  i keep telling myself that one day soon, i will laugh at all of this.  and i'll be able to swim in my money pool (all $100 bills by the way) just like Scrooge McDuck (from DUCKTALES...remember that cartoon?!).  i have four years.  come rain or shine...my account will be in at least the six-figure range.  that's a fucking goal i tell you!!

      feeling a little better today.  still can't eat much.  everything still tastes like paper.  i've been getting through by drinking lot's of coffee though.  that's bad, but i don't know.  it makes me full somewhat.  anyways, seattle was fun.  kind of.  being in japan-town made me want to cry a bit.  I HATE THIS!  i found out today that my cousin just moved here from the Philippines.  i also found out that she has a six year old daughter AND she's married!  was i in a fucking coma or something?  she thought i knew, but i didn't.  weird.  everyone's having kids and getting married.  did i miss the fucking memo or something?

      To Whom It May Concern:  You're nothing but a coward.  I think you take me for some kind of idiot.  I may have been in the past, but not anymore.  You ask why no one believes what you say...it's because you've never given anyone the truth.  When was the last time you ever told the truth anyways?  Anything and everything you've ever said to me is PURE FICTION.  You're in the wrong profession honey, try becoming a writer.  I fucking wash my hands of you.  I loathe you...I dread you...I hate you...if you were on fire, I wouldn't even spit on you.  Have a nice life.  I only hope that you never ever get back what you dished out...if you ever do, then you'll truly know what kind of pain you caused.  -ME

      Thought #1:  I so don't get this hype about Justin Timberlake or Ashton Kutcher (Ashton KOOOSHER, like Don Vito says).  Ashton's okay looking, but he's so fucking annoying!  Everytime I watch Punk'd, I put his commentaries on mute.  Can we all say OVER-ACTING?  Oh, and Justin Timberlake.  Maybe I'm one of the weird girls, but to me, he looks like the freaking Keebler Elf.  How's the Keebler Elf sexy?  Plus, he looks like a major dick.  Thought #2:  Maybe one day I'll be famous and have my very own "True Hollywood Life" story, haha.  That doesn't really validate that you're extremely famous though right?  More notorious than famous.  Thought #3:  The Filipino Channel = a definition of the word INSIPID in the dictionary.  Thought #4:  Okay, so maybe I am classified as ANTI-SOCIAL.  I just noticed how I have very few friends here.  I have very few friends period.  That's not exactly a bad thing.  I'd much rather scrub my boobs with a brillo pad than hang out with some half-brained, shit-talking, two-faced, twit.  No wait, that's too harsh.  I'd much rather get a pap-smear than hang out with poor excuses for human beings.  That's not such a bitchy thing is it?

      Britney Spears got married...as a joke!  I think the young, rich kids, have nothing better to do with their time or money eh?  That's a pretty stupid joke.  I officially hate the snow.  Two or three days of it is cool.  You find it pretty at first.  Now i'm beginning to hate it.  All the roads are icy, and it's really hard to drive places.  Still waiting on the phone call  :*(.

      Yesterday was the last straw.  I'm finally sending the naive Brooke on her way out the door.  I used to think that there was some good to everyone.  You know, I always gave people the benefit of the doubt.  Time and time again I've been warned of certain people.  But stubborn, hard-headed me always said, "No, you just don't know them all that well."  But whatever.  I am now fully guarded and untrusting.  Every damn time, it never fails...someone I think I trust will go and disappoint me.    I am wide awake to everything now.  And I think I've just about sorted out the good from the bad.  Those that need to be thrown out with the trash, and those that truly deserve a second chance.  I should've believed certain people when they warned me that certain people were just that...TRASH.  Well, now they'll be going to where they belong.  In the dumpster.  So yeah, I shall leave the fallen friend nameless, but I shall end with a big FUCK YOU to you and your shit-talking, back-stabbing ways, you fucking slutty bitch.  And in the words of the great ERIC CARTMAN:  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME.  This time I am truly sticking to my resolution that I never ever carry out.  All parasites must go.  Anything related to the past...I'm finally letting go.  Thank the Lord, praise God, ALLELUJAH, AMEN.

      Since it was a long day today, I went to the video store to rent some movies so that I could go home and possibly relax.  Roaming through the store I found "Lost In Translation", which I hear is a great movie.  Still not satisfied, I combed through the store looking for another movie.  I stop at "Gigli" because it's always sparked some curiosity in me.  Why the hell is everyone saying it's so bad?  Got home, popped it in...OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH, THAT'S WHY!!!!!!  What a fucking waste of film!  If you people want to cure insomnia...watch this movie.  IT'S THAT BAD!!

I'm very happy being single.  I'm happy period.  I haven't been happy in a long time.  Not by myself at least.

      There's gotta be more to life than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me.  I've been presented with the opportunity.  Question is, do I take it there?  Rebounds are never good.  Technically it's not a rebound situation.  But, pursuing more than friendship with a longtime friend could be potentially harmful to whatever we have now.  A bigger part of me screams NO, and I'm guessing that's the part I should listen to.  Plus, I'm enjoying my newfound freedom.  Companionship would be nice, but I'm not that lonely.  All I need is a friend.  Commitment is the last thing on my mind.  I want to have my fun, do what I please, with whom I please, when I please, how I please.  I don't need a fucking man to answer to.  Sounds kinda like the rantings of a scorned woman...NO.  I just want to be by myself.  That sounded kinda harsh but luckily Bubby understands.  He's the best!!!!!

      It's amazing how much your appetite gets stunted when you're depressed.  As I was getting ready for church this morning, and as I put on pants that I had a hard time getting into not even two months ago, they damn near fell to my knees.  Wow, I lost a lot of weight.  And my tummy's toned too from all the crunches I've been doing.  AMAZING!!  My appetites not back at all though.  I only eat when I get super hungry.  Other than that, it's just water and maybe an apple here or there.  They all say that I eat like a bird.  Maybe I do, but whatever.  I think it's because my appetite is the last thing I have total control of?  Honestly, when I look in the mirror, I don't see someone I like.  I never did feel good enough, or pretty enough.  Oh well...  Didn't do much today.  Went to church, ate Chinese food (which totally made me feel like crap), and watched NCAA games on TV.  Gonzaga's #2 :(.  Ironically, Oklahoma's doing well.  I thought that they only worked on their football.  Oh, and I've been watching a lot of The Weather Channel lately.  It helps me fall asleep.  I think I know enough about the weather to become a weather girl myself.    Oh, and I talked to Jenny.  I feel a whole lot better whenever I get to talk to her.  I really miss her a lot and I cannot wait until we're in Hawai'i.

       "It's strange that things change, but not me wanting you so desperately."   It sucks to be stuck in a battle of the heart and mind.  That's one cruel conflict.  In my opinion, more devasting than battles fought with weapons and bombs.  The heart, I've learned, is a stubborn organ.  It's weird, that very vital organ has the capacity to feel so much emotion.  Everyone says it's the mind telling your body what to feel, but most of the time, my mind says to hate, my heart feels nothing but love.  So who should I believe?  The heart or my mind?    I always tried to live my life so simple.  The more I did, the more everything got complicated.  Sometimes out of anger I ask why me?  I'm a good person.  I don't step on anyone to get to where I need to be, I try my hardest to be considerate of everyone's feelings, I don't lie, cheat,  or steal.  I've been told that all of this is God's way of opening up my eyes and heart.  But my eyes have been open for awhile now.  Maybe I'm being prepared for something greater?  Maybe at the end of the tunnel, something truly amazing is in store for me?  I'm so ready for a change.  I'm so ready for the future.  Although I'd like to forget about the past and move on, the only thing I want from the past is the person I know was made for me.  Sounds crazy doesn't it?  I find it strange too.  But I just know this.  It's definitely because I don't want to let go.  It's just that when you know, YOU KNOW.  The feeling I get from the bottom of my gut is real.  He IS THE ONE.  Plus, four years is hard to throw away.  EXTREMELY HARD!!!  Maybe for others girls it is, but I'm not like other girls.  I don't give out my heart to just anyone.  There's only been one person that I've given it to.  Actually, that person still has it.  And as silly as it sounds, I believe they'll have it for a long time to come.

      i got scolded for losing/gaining weight way too fast.  it's bad for the heart, and if i keep it up, then i could eventually croak.  like i really asked for depression?!  hey, at least i fit my old clothes again.    in any case, instead of admitting depression, i my other excuse will be lent.  you're supposed to fast every friday anyways :).  speaking of lent, i don't believe i've ever taken it seriously until i watched that Mel Gibson movie.  now i know why you're supposed to abstain from sex, alcohol, over-indulgence, blah, blah.  anything pleasurable, you do not do for a month.  jesus christ is suffering, and you're out having a lustful fuck with someone?!  that's pretty disrespectful!    so from now on, i'm the good girl.  plus, it's not like i have sex, drink alcohol, smoke, or over-indulge (HAHAHAHA, i definitely haven't done this in awhile!).

      i just found out that a friend of mine has been diagnosed with cancer.  now if people think i'm a strong person, she definitely comes in first place in this department!  she shows no sign of fear what-so-ever.  now that's what you call determined!  that's what you call total faith in the lord!  what made me cry is when she said, "good or bad, i've lived a great life."    i don't know...that statement hit me like a ton of bricks.  she's determined to win, yet ready for the worst.  i totally understand what she's saying though.  i think if i were to find out i had a life-threatening illness, i would be prepared for the worst as well.  actually, even though i don't have anything life-threatening, i'm prepared for death.  not to be morbid, but i'm not afraid to die.  maybe it's because i've been through too much of the bad here on earth, i'd be ready for the eternal paradise.  the place where you feel no pain, sadness, grief.  and i have waay too many people up in heaven to keep me company.  one person in particular that i could be with for always.  that i could hold and cuddle all day long.  but yeah, i don't think death is a scary concept.  it's more sad than scary.  but you definitely go on to a better place.  and you don't die, you just go somewhere that you weren't able to see or go to.  anyways, i pray that she gets well.  and i know she will!  on another note, I'M OFF for the next two days!!!!  i will definitely bum it around the house :).

      "i'm not going to diss you on the internet cause my mama taught me better than that!"  the extremes that some people will go to get a rise out of someone!  sorry honey, but the zen-like state that i intend to stay in for awhile, cannot be broken.  so if you were hoping to read some sort of reaction from me...the only thing i'm going to say is EDUCATION is the way to go.  hit the books, nourish your brain, then come back when you have something remotely stimulating to say.  i have once again learned what a small world it is indeed.  turns out that an old friend Cece and her husband Jorge have been stationed here for awhile.  she's in Texas for the meantime because Jorge is in Honduras.    after work today, i went to Safeway to buy some 'feminine products'.  mind you, it was almost 1am.  the freaks truly do come out at night.  almost everyone there looked like a crack-head.  sccccccuuurrry!  while i was paying, the girl behind me kept staring at me.  actually, she was at the door when i first got in and she was staring at me then.  while i was contemplating whether i should go for the maxi's or with wings, she was staring at me.  talk about fucking stalker, man!!!  i don't know...she gave me the ultimate creepies!

       24 hour Fitness?!   This girl calls in @ around 11:15pm because she was locked into 24-hour Fitness and she needed someone to let her out.  Maybe they should change their name since they're not open 24hrs?!  And how loud was this girl's music that she didn't hear the closing announcement?  I almost felt like telling her to excercise it off, hehe...  Mother's Day is around the corner.  What the hell do I get the woman who literally has EVERYTHING!

      days off rock!!  today has been quite productive so far.  cleaned up a storm!  the fridge, my room, the kitchen, blah, blah...i should've gone to make my deposit though.  i just didn't feel like driving.  anyways, tomorrow, my week starts all over again :(.  definitely not looking forward to it.  fake people are fucking amazing (that's regarding the post below).  you talk shit, but have the audacity to still try to act like things are peachy keen between us.  eh, WHATEVER girl!  i forgive, but don't forget.  sorry...

      it's hilarious when people pretend to even remotely care.  twas the funniest situation about four days ago, but i'll leave it at that.  trying to be civil with someone who screwed you over is difficult, so from now on...i will just do as i was instructed in the first place:  i'm going to just 'faggedaboudit'.     "I don't run with many girls cause' they talk too much..."   i felt like barfing all day today.  i had the worst tension headache all day today, up until 11pm, which sucked ass!  my neck was totally in pain and i felt like banging my head against my computer screen.  i was debating whether or not i should leave to go home early, but opted to take it like a fucking trooper and stick things out.  again, those fake ass people at work pretended to be concerned.  i keep to myself.  for me, it's in and out (like a penis).  i'm there to do my work, not to gossip.  i think it's high time they hired some men over there.  it's a damn carpet festival at the office!  too many catty women.   i don't know...me and too many women don't mesh well.  and i know those girls talk about me.  it's obvious because when i go to poll systems, they give me that "i'm guilty of talking behind your back" glare.  oh well, who cares.  i'm flattered, haha!!  summer is almost here, and i'm almost 25.  it's so weird!  in five years i'll be 30.  but in many ways i feel like i'll be turning 45.  anyways, the days are only going to get nicer out.  perfect for the great outdoors, getting muddy, getting wet, blah, blah.  i should get all that 'action-junkie' crap off my chest before i have kids huh (God-willing!!)?!    HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY LAOATIAN SISTAH MALY SOUPHANTHAVONG ESPINOZA MITCHELL.  it was actually yesterday, but she was off today so i didn't get to greet her.  not even by phone :(.  I love you bizzznatch!

      i would gladly procreate with...  RUSSELL WONG (FUCK YEAH!) RICK YUNE (YUMMY!) BEN AFFLECK (RAWR!)  i think that if ever though, i would want my kids to have chinky eyes.  i have a weakness for chinky eyes.  don't know why.  chinky eyes make me weak in the knees.  especially RUSSELL WONG's chinky eyes, hahaha.  yeah, i'd definitely do him!!  hell, i'd even propose to him.  on another note, before i forget...congrats on your promotion bubby!  senior financial analyst for morgan stanley.  my bubby's a big baller now!!

      oh...and another thing that runs through my head; if i had a trillion dollars, i would feed all the hungry children in the world.  sounds like an answer to a "miss america" question, but i really would.  watching FEED THE CHILDREN makes me cry.  seriously it does!!!

      five things running through my head...  -tension headaches suck ass!   -the prettiest people do the ugliest things. -my sister and her fucked up psychic predictions. -hormones out of whack are icky. -i should've become an actress, i hide things well!  lately my email inbox has been bombarded with either announcements of engagements or breakups.  so i either have to respond with "CONGRATULATIONS" or "I'M SORRY".  no freaking "happy-median".  must be the season though.  one extreme to the next.    days off are kind of mundane.  i really don't know what to do on them.  spent most of yesterday trying to clean up around the house, just couldn't bring myself to do anything.  i really should go and find some energy because i have a shit-load of stuff to throw out.  elle thinks shes psychic.  don't ask why.  if i told you, you'd just laugh.  you know...the more i hear of good, solid relationships coming to an end, the more commitment scares the hell out of me.  i know that nothing is ever set in stone, but you have to admit, it's painful to let go of something you've invested so much time and energy into.  you kind of think to yourself, "what a waste!"  then again, i think i may have been investing my time with people that were never worth my time investment.  but then again...people like that are brought into your life to teach you some kind of valuable lesson.  and boy have a freaking learned!!!  hey, the more you try to fucking knock me down...the more i get up.  you can call me many things, but WEAK is definitely not one of them.

      it's been said, "ask and you will receive."  i think i'm probably annoying the big guy asking him for SIGNS all the time.  i've been asking for specific signs, and everytime i do, i get my answers.  maybe some of you don't believe in signs, and i never thought i did until recently.  but when specific things i asked for have been popping up...that's weird.  that can only come from one source.     "so i lay my head back down, and i lift my hands and pray, to be only yours i pray.  to be only yours, i know now...you're my only hope."   easter was alright.  it was beautiful yesterday!  i haven't worn a tank top in such a long time.  church was crowded.  it's funny how people only come to church on a holiday.  i used to be the same way so i shouldn't be one to talk.  i'm not a bible-humper or anything, but i have come to realize the importance of God.  he's been so good to me.  despite my imperfections, he's loved me and showered me with nothing but the best in life.  that alone comforts me when i feel down.  that kind of tells me that i must be doing something right.  i realize that all the challenges thrown my way are only lessons that i should learn for the future.  maybe he has something truly wonderful in store for me?

      my little sister said something that i thought was interesting.  so we were looking at the various pictures stored on this computer (that reminds me, i really need to transfer a lot of them onto disks).  came across one where tristan was sitting on some guy's lap (it was obviously john's lap), and i said, "he's sitting on john's lap."  she asked me how i knew, and i said, "it's john, because those are his hands."  she then replied, "woah, that's freaking love!"  i asked how so?  she said it's because i could distiguish his hands w/out looking at his face.  only someone who knew the person inside and out would know that.  i just thought it was funny...

      about the post below, NO...I'M NOT INVOLVED.  i'm as single as they come.  but i do admit that bubby's presence does something to me.  still i can't take that extra step and bring it "there".  like other scars, this one needs time to heal.  that was almost five years of my life.  i'm not hurting, but i do want to know the feeling of being free and by myself.  he's great company, and i do beam when he's around.  he knows how far things can go, and i admire his patience and understanding.  like i said, i am forever grateful for the person he is and has always been.  he's the greatest!  my godkids were born yesterday (April 5, 2004) @ 3:46pm.  xanthie and xavier weighed in at 5lbs each and xanthie was 17in, while xavier was 19in.  i so can't wait to meet them and cuddle them all day long!!!!  i feel icky today.  i think i maybe suffering from a bad case of allergies :(.

      this daylight savings time is throwing me totally off :(.  my body-clock is still on original time, and i hardly slept when we were on winter time.  fuck!!!  it was a gorgeous palm sunday today.  originally i was supposed to go to church at ft. lewis, but that place was crowded.  ended up catching mass at mcchord afb instead.  i like mass there much better.  the church is a lot smaller and a lot more solemn.  the people are much more friendly as well.  they even do the old school stuff, like the incense and stuff.    ended up sitting near this 6month old baby named julia.  her dad's on deployment in qatar, and i think her mom's totally exhausted so she was letting whoever wanted to hold julia, hold her, hehe.  played with her for most of mass.  she's such a cutie pie!!!  really happy, friendly, and playful :).  anyways, like i said, it was really warm today!  after mass, ended up going to sheaatlllle to walk around westlake center and eat at todai's.  all you can eat sushi, tempura, japanese food, yummy.  now i have to do extra cardio, hehe.  oh, and i ended up talking to jenny today.  we talk a lot lately which is good.  i miss her a lot, but soon enough we'll be able to hang out like old times.  she too is moving to hawaii and i'm so excited!!!  i get to see her and the buboys again.

      i've been running on empty lately.  honestly, i really don't know how i do it.  i should knock on wood so that i don't get thrown off track.  i'm super exhausted, but i tell myself that only a little bit more of this until i'm in paradise.  yup, i'll be in paradise.  believe that!  contrary to popular belief, you can lose weight at a desk job.  i have!  maybe because i don't have much time to eat.  today at the tech job, it was insane!  power outages in 3 different cities here in washington, in utah, and for some reason all the systems in hawaii thought they'd go offline as well.  well the systems in utah were fucking up because of wind storms.  maybe everyone was excited for the weekend?  i don't know.  you don't know how many freaking tickets i had to print out to check for resets.  to put it plainly, it sucked.  i felt pretty sick too.  i already felt sick coming in because of the weather changes and allergies.  i forgot my water bottle so all i had to drink was the dr pepper i had for baon.  it was my co-workers birthday so we all got her cheesecake and starbucks coffee ice cream.  had some of that and i felt like puking.  i think i was loaded with sugar or something.    now i think i can't sleep because of all the sugar i had.  it's cool though because i have a three day weekend.  i found out that at the tech job, i have third fastest response time.  that's pretty good considering how new i am :).  now if i can only get first so that i can get that bonus, hehehe...  tomorrow i think i'll try to finally paint the room and sand the furniture so i can give it that "distressed" look.  it's going to be 71 degrees out so i guess i could use the sun wisely as well and get some natural vitamin e in my system.  i feel like whitey from "me, myself, and irene".  i'm so damn pale.  doesn't help that i lost all that weight.  i feel like cook from "matilda" :P.  anyways, yeah...that sounds like a plan.  but then again, i know i'll end up wanting to go gallivanting.  we'll see i guess.  sleep is my first priority right now :).

      so bubby asked, "are you still angry?!"  the answer is NO.  and with that i've realized that i'm a big girl now.  the fact that i can let go of things that i once thought would kill me speaks volumes at how much i've grown up.  i used to bottle things up, hold grudges, want to see blood shed, but now i just let all that crap go.  it's unhealthy.  why fight for someone/something that never wanted to fight for you?  why try and fight a battle that you'll never win?  why keep trying to make the person you love the most in the world love you back when you know they've replaced you at the drop of a dime?  it's useless.  i'm replaceable and i've accepted that.  i've learned so much in the last five years!  i've learned acceptance, forgiveness, selflessness, how much it really takes to make a relationship work.  i've learned that the world doesn't revolve around me.  i've learned to say i'm sorry.  i've learned to swallow my pride.  i've loved with all that i have.  i've encountered moments so sweet that you'd want to freeze them in time forever.  i've also been to what seemed like HELL, many times!  i've smiled so much that my cheeks hurt from smiling, i've laughed so hard that i thought my sides would split open.  i've cried many tears.  so many that i believe if you collected them all, it would fill all the oceans of the world up.  i've cried so much that my eyes felt like they would fall out of their sockets.    it used to make me angry how things turned out.  but i now realize that's just how life goes.  you win some & lose some.  that's life, and i'm lucky that i still have a chance to live.  i used to be envious that everyone and their mommas were getting married and having children, but now i'm only the happiest person for all of them!!  i think i will always love him, and i still pray each and every night that God keeps him and his wonderful family safe from any harm.  and hey, SHE'S lucky to have him.  i truly hope she realizes that.  i guess he's that needy after all.  i realize that i'm not.  i have a full life to live and i can live it w/out a significant other because i've learned that the more you chase happiness, the more it will elude you.  so i will enjoy the time i have to myself and wait patiently for who/what GOD has in store for me.  no need to rush because i know that when i finally meet my other half, it'll be all that i hoped for and more.  now is just not my time.

      Dear Mom,  I never really understood why you always set such strict & high standards for me when I was growing up.  But like the natural rebel that I am, I made it a point to break every rule you set for me.  You said left, I went right.  You said no, I still did it.  Now that I'm older, and just a little bit wiser...I understand.  I have to admit that you do drive me crazy with your bi-polar ways.  Sometimes you make me want to spike your diet coke with draino.  But the fact is, I could never imagine my life without you.  And if I was given the chance by God to choose a mother all over again, I would most certainly still choose you.    My only wish is that one day, I'm at least half the woman that you are.  And maybe one day, the Lord will give me a chance to be as wonderful a mother to my children as you are.  I love you with all my heart and soul.  Happy Mother's Day!  Love, Brookelynne   P.S.,  You and Daddy are truly my heroes.  After all, you've mananged to survive ME :).

      sometimes i wish i could go back to being a kid again.  back to the days where you didn't have to worry about a damn thing.  all you worried about was doing your homework and where your next adventure on your bicycle would lead to.  when i'd meet up with my best friend paul and beat up other kids in the neighborhood.  or back when you'd wait for it to get dark during the summer just so you could catch fireflies with an empty jar.  yeaup, just finished paying the bills.  and yeaup, most of it went to mr.visa card :).  you didn't have to worry about stuff like that when you were young.    a lot of the times i encounter a kid who always tries to speed up the aging process.  so many kids that want to be older than they really are.  hey, i have to admit that i spent a lot of my youth doing that.  but now i regret it.  i'm actually trying to find my lost youth.  not that i was bad.  i just really should've listened to my mom and took my time.  everytime i see a kid trying to be older than they really are, i always feel like telling them the truth about adulthood.  BELIEVE ME, it's not all it's cracked up to be.  enjoy every ounce of youth you have!  one day you'll wake up and it'll be gone.

      i was wondering why i was feeling tubby for the past few days...it's because i'm bleeding.  yup, every month i bleed for a week.  and you know what?  i don't die.  no man can do that!  well, i'm also feeling tubby because i haven't been doing my crunches in awhile.  i did have a nice stroll outside on tuesday though.  taking the time to stop and smell the roses is always nice.  yesterday was pretty funny.  on lunch break, maly and i went to her house and auntie noy cooked pork & shrimp spring rolls, egg rolls, and spicy pho.  that was so bomb!  i stuffed my face silly with spring rolls & egg rolls, and i could've sworn i was on the verge of a spring roll/egg roll-induced coma.  auntie noy was like, "eat some more, you're too skinny!"  yeah right!  but she's too cute.  she and uncle sirphont are great for the ego.  they call me 'pretty girl', or 'you're so pretty'.  don't hang out with a pregnant lady though.  actually, don't let a pregnant lady eat your food.  i thought it was an old wives tale that if you let a preggo eat your food, you will feel sleepy & nauseous.  in short, you feel all the symptoms a pregnant lady would...like morning sickness, narcolepsy (hehe), the strange cravings.  IT'S TRUE!  anyways, HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my little brother Rocky.  my little baby boy is all grown up.  pretty soon, he'll be making babies.  YUCK.  what a thought!  time to start warning him about covering up his willy...OR ELSE!

        Happy Father's Day to the greatest man I've ever met in my life...my Dada!!  I may be a little biased being that he's my dad, but if you ever met him...you'd say the same thing.  We love you papa.    A BELATED Happy Birthday to my buddy Alana and Auntie Teresa.    Nothing new with me.  Tired as fuck.  Work can do that to you.  Starting over is harder than I thought.  But I've made a promise to myself.  I will NEVER be dependant on a man financially or emotionally.  I don't care if I have to sweat blood trying to make ends meet. Everything I have and will have will come from my blood, sweat, and tears.  As for the happiness.  That's not hard to create.  And besides, it will all come to me in God's time.  No need to rush because he's got something amazing in store for me.  I FEEL IT!

      And yet once again, the age-old theory that men think with the little head rather than the big head, is once again proven correct.  Marc Anthony married J.Lo (who the hell hasn't?!) this weekend.  He traded in the classy Miss Universe for the "Jenny who's been around the block and then some"???  Yup.  The power of pussy once again prevails!!  I will never understand why men will choose to have everyone else's sloppy seconds.  I think that if all else fails...maybe I should try to get in good with J.Lo.  Try to become her #1 wedding planner.  Shit, with a job like that...I'd be set for life.  Hell, she gets married like every five years right?

      Long time no write!  Let's see...what's new?  Well I turned 25.  Thanks to all who called, emailed, sent cards, texted, IMed, bought me cakes, gifts...THANKS!  I don't feel old.  What's changed?  Well, now I can rent a car without paying extra fees.  My insurance goes down.  And well...I can make human beings, hopefully.  I don't know.  Age is a frame of mind.  I'm going with the flow from now on, and letting whatever I'm supposed to be getting come my way instead of hunting it down.  Oh...and it's official.  I OFFICIALLY HATE TELEPHONES & PAPERWORK!
