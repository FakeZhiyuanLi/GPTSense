						   I might be to busy to get on here tomorrow - so I wanted to be sure to add ...  Its going to my Wedding Anniversary Tomorrow, May 11th.  Joe if you ever read this - I love you dearly, and want you to know that I am here for you always.  I know things have been such a silly mess as of late, but they will get better soon.  I am so glad God has put you in our lives.  The kids and I do love you so much - and that I can guarantee.    Each of us have our own "quirks" - I want you to stop being so hard on yourself and understand that we are all in this together.  I'll love you in whatever we have to go through - might not like how you act at times, but LOVE ya just as strong as when things are all rosey.     "If our God is for us - then Who can be against us?"

						   I do believe that this past Winter and now into Spring has been a major "doozey" for everyone I know and including myself.  So many changes and life choices have been going on not only in my own life, but all of my friends as well.  I suppose we are all suppose to learn something from all of this.  LOL  If someone has the answer would ya let me cheat a bit so I can get this all over with?  LOL  The words of my son pop into my head  ...   "Its not fair!"   I guess I will tell myself what I have to tell him and my daughter as well ...   "Life's not fair!  Just be glad you have others that love you, and things will get better sooner or later.  Some things we just have to go through."   We have changed our minds on selling our home.  It seemed to be a good idea, one that would solve a lot of issues - but honestly ... We can achieve the same goals just by using what we have around here and the equity in our home.    Lots of prayers are needed right now ... so that Joe won't get laid off again anytime soon, and that the Union will not strike over this contract deal.    I don't think I am going to even vote this election.  I am so frustrated over all this economy crap.  Bush can suck my big toe as for as voting goes.  Sorry Daddy - I know you raised me to think Republican ... but they had better send us better guys to cheer on.  This dude ain't cuttin' it.  On a different note ...  I was given another store to take care of for work.  Now I will be tending to two a week.  This is a very good thing.    I really like my work - not only do I get to get out of the house and  make a bit of money ... I also get to make my own hours.  It really comes in handy with being a Mom and Wife.  Like today - I decided that I would go in tomorrow and Wednesday ... so today is all mine.  Peace time and space to breathe - a girl needs that from time to time.  ;o)  Till next time, Tracy M.

						   I think things are changin' a bit around here - does that have anything to do with the fact that I live in St. Louis and if you don't like the weather you can just hang around ... for it will change as it always does.  I have been meeting a bunch of really cool people lately.  Mainly other couples that ride Harleys as do Joe and I.  I think once I get over my small fear of crashin'... LOL ... I will be able to really have a good time again.  They plan all sorts of bike runs and parties.  Even camp outs for all the group.  Many of them have children and even some around the same age as mine.    We got to have dinner with 5 of them last night and we had just a spectacular time.  I just know this is going to prove to be a fine bunch of people to hang around with.  Joe's even excited about it ... so this is a very good thing.  lol  I finally got my first paycheck from my job.  You know they shorted me like over $200.00.  What the hell?  Now I have to call and throw a fit come Monday morning.  lol  Well at least I get to go to the grocery store.  Boy that pantry is bare.  We are even out of deodorant - that could get scary for sure.  lol  Not much but its an entry.  I'll be back later to make it more interesting.  ;o)

						   Oh wait till ya'all see it ... Joe has the new paint job all on the bike now.  I wonder if all those flames are gonna make it go faster?  lol  All joking aside - the bike looks really cool ... not that it didn't to begin with, but I swear he's always got to be doing something to that thing.  This time though - I think he just might be done for awhile - can't make it better as for as I see it.  The kids just got picked up by their Daddy.  They got out of school for the summer on this past Wednesday.  I can't believe they are getting so big.  Next School year they will be in 5th and 6th grade - it just doesn't seem possible.  Jacob passed on A honor roll again, and Jackie's grades were very good too.  I am so proud of them.  Now if only I could get them to stop their arguing and fighting with eachother.  lol  I suppose that won't stop till they hit 30 or so.  Joe and I have a busy weekend ahead.  Tonight we are meeting some new friends for dinner.  Tomorrow we have a graduation party to go to for one of Joe's cousin's, and on Sunday we are having a few friends over for a small get together.    There is rarely a dull moment around here in the Spring/Summer.  We seem to be on the go all of the time.  Well in the Winter too - I think there is a small lull after the holidays, but other than that its go go go all the freakin' time.    Well I do believe its time to start the primping process - better get busy ... it takes a bit to make myself knock out material.  lol  Till next time... Tracy M.

						   Wow ... have I been busy.  I've heard about it in all directions too.  lol  I'm sorry for not taking the time in here - just been getting ready for my new business on top of a bazillion other things.  Lets see - since I was on last ... I have taken my kids to Branson.  We went to see a Magic Show there with Tigers and other Big Cats, we did the Silver Dollar City bit too - boy oh boy ... don't go down in that cave if you know whats good for you.  I thought I was gonna hyperventalate from being claustrophobic, and if that wasn't bad enough ... there were like 750 damn steps to climb to get back out to the top.  Ummmm note to self ... Just say NO to caves.  My Mother had her 58th Birthday yesterday and we chipped in with my Sister and Brother In Law and got her a really fancy BBQ Pit.  We took that down to her and cooked dinner for her, while the kids went swimmin' in her pool.  Joe is getting ready to go on a "Guy's Weekend" to Branson, and is leaving on Friday morning.  His sole intent is to Pig Out on Lobster at the all you can eat Lobster Buffet.  His friend John will be going with him (They are going down on the Harley's) - its for the best ... they would embarrass me in the restaurant.  lol  I am having my Debut Show for my new business on Friday night.  I will be selling a really cool line of clothing and lingerie - the company is called Petra Fashions.  I am getting really excited about it too.  My kit came in today and I got so many new pretties.  I steamed all the wrinkles out and tagged them all so that I will be able to give details at my shows.  They are all hung on the clothing rack and ready for my first show that will be held on the 21st.  I am looking forward to this Friday though - this way I can see my director in action and get a taste of what to expect when I start out on my own.  Petra has a wonderful website if anyone would like to check it out.  http://petrafashions.com/home/default.asp  I will be happy to book parties for anyone that would want to earn free clothing and lingerie.  :o)  *As well as let you in on my new secret of making really good money, all while making new friends and going to lots of really fun Ladies Nights Out.  The Average show brings the Hostess $150.00 in FREE outfits - can't beat that with a stick.  ;o)  I'm going to give it my all ... as it sure would beat my day job.  They are even going to pay me a car allowance on top of my comm. - can you believe that ... getting paid real money for having a good time.  Well as you can see I am just a bit excited.  :o)  I am sure I have forgotten to mention about a ton of stuff that has gone on since my last post.  It will come to me and I will be sure to post a lot sooner next time.  I PROMISE!  Till next time ... OOO's & XXX's
