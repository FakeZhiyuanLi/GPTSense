      Just how did the proposal happen?! Well it was 1st December 2003 and we had just been to see Daniel Beddingfield in concert at Newcastle's City Hall. Before the show I went to buy ice creams and was annoyed when i came back to find him hastily putting his phone back in his pocket - texting one of his friends! Or so i thought.... The concert was amazing and Daniel had also sung "our song", If you're not the one. I had an inkling Paul might propose but when the song finished and we left the building (after Paul bought a commemorative mug!) I felt disappointed and stupid about my inkling that hadn't happened. I mentioned in the car that one of my friends thought he may propose tonight (I couldn't tell him it was me who thought that!)when he brought out his phone - with a text he'd prepared when i'd got the ice creams saying.... "as 'you are the one' will you marry me?" I also found out later that Paul thought it would have been to cheesy to do it after or during the song! No!!!! I told him! But it was special anyway and i said yes immediately. How long have i been waiting!! I took the day after off work and we went shopping for a ring. I wanted something simple so we chose an 18 carat white gold diamond solitaire. It's beautiful! We had a small engagement party on the 10th December at home and received lots of brill pressies and cards - thanks everyone! The picture above is us at paul's mum's after telling her our good news!

      The following site has one of the best varieties of accommodation. Bear in mind thought the prices are only for the accommodation and flights and transfers will be extra, but if you put your preference of hotel in the guest book, depending on how many people are in your chosen hotel, we may be able to get you a discount or a price with flights and transfers included - it's up to you but we're happy to help you book or do it for you!  Olu Deniz is a quieter resort than Hisaronu, although Hisaronu is only 4kms from Olu Deniz, anyway take a look for yourselves......   urlLink GO!

      Well!! I'm not exactly sure when we first met but i doubt it was fireworks! (well not for Paul anyway!) Paul worked with friends of mine who were always chatting to him when we went out on a girly night, I just stood in awe, too dumbstruck to speak - honest! Anyway, Paula and I were awarding men with medals, shallow I know, but Paul was the only gold medal ever awarded! For about 6 months I was too afraid to speak to him then one (drunken!) night, June 2001, I approached him and muttered something along the lines of "you know my friend Jill - she's just had a baby!" Not surprisingly he looked at me like I was from another planet! We chatted but I thought he was boring, all he could talk about was Pearl Harbour the film, and he yawned a lot - charming! Anyway as the weeks went on we "bumped" into each other in the local hotspot "Mood", and the rest as they say is history. We had a couple of false starts - I dumped him twice but when I took him to Barcelona in February 2002 for his birthday he asked me to move in with him (aw) and we've been inseparable ever since. Hmmmm...........!!
