      There is a moment in everybody's life. This moment, dictates your whole life. This moment, you have to make a decision. This decision, can be right, or wrong. It is up to you to figure out which decision is right, and which decision is wrong. The decision you make may not only affect your life. The life of many it may affect. And the people who's life might be affected, have to decide too, whether they are going to trust you, or not.  The chance of The Moment may be given only once. Some people say there is a second chance, but even if there is, it could never be like The Moment. Sometimes, there are many Moments, which happen at different times, different places, with different people. Someday you could have The Moment with your loved one, other day you could have The Moment at work. Only you must decide, again. The Moment, is called The Moment, because it only lasts a moment. At that particular moment, your thinking rate, goes up enormously. You weigh all incomes and outcomes, and when it comes to a final decision, all you have is your luck, and your 6th sense. 6th sense. There are 5 senses beside your deep feelings: See, Hear, Taste, Touch, Smell. The 6th sense, I would actualy call The Sense. Because it is present in everybody, just not that everybody can undetstand it, or find it and see it IN themselves. Sense allows you to feel the object of your desire when it is close to you, or sometimes it allows you to predict what is going to happen, how will somebody react, who will win, etc. The Sense is a power i suppose, which is mistic in some ways. I believe that everyone has that power. Humans need to develop that power in themselves in order to accomplish great things. Sense and luck and fate are very much alike. Fate is predictable, luck isn't, and sense is what you predict with. Fate cannot be changed once it is written down by God's hand. Luck is given to you by the fate. Sense helps you determine when the True Moment comes, and then how to decide. Sense helps you determine your fate and get yourself on the right path to follow, or lead. I believe not everyone can be a leader. Leader must be born a leader. Leader must have luck. And Sense. Being leader is harder than being a folower. Folower does what he is being told to do. Leader never is a folower, even if someone commands him. If a leader is actualy a folower, than he will get down by a true Leader. But a world is nothing without the folowers. If there'd be only leaders, nobody would have the power. In the end, there would be one leader left, the greatest leader. But what is the point of being left completely alone on Earth? none. Take. Taking - is a verb, decribing function opposite of giving. Taking a chance, is what everybody does, when they are sure of what to do. Taking a chance is gambling. You can't live life without gambling. That wouldn't be called a life. Taking a responsobility is the same as taking a chance...fucked up eh?
