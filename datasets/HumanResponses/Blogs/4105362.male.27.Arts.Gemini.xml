      WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH  Three movies shot back to back. Total budget under $5,000,000. Maybe stars but recognizable faces. Crew & Talent fully paid One Kid's Film -  urlLink Becoming Tomorrow  One Horror Film -  urlLink The Wind Cries Mary  One Independant -  urlLink A Stage  Three Shorts &amp; Music Videos - for promotions and DVD   Why three at once?  To save a serious amount of money. Budgets aren't finished yet but the savings equal out to be about 2.5 million.  Also when you make three, you have a better chance of selling one. It's the law of averages.   Why these genres?  They sell better whether or not a star is involved.  Questions?  urlLink Ask me

      My old acting teacher used to talk about the snake. It's that voice that you get in your head when you are in doubt. "The doubting thomas" if you will. I don't really think you can make a movie with that kind of voice going through your head. There's too much at stake.  Here's some lyrics. Yes I know it's cheesy but bear with me.  Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted One moment Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo, His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's chokin, how everybody's chokin now The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah! Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy No, he won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes It don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke He's so stacked that he knows When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again yo This whole rap city He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  [Chorus:]You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo,

      My dad had to go to Orlando again for business. He'll be out for about a week. it would be nice to make a trip out there. I haven't had a real trip anywhere (other than vegas) for about six years. It might not like seem like a big deal to a lot of people but from about when I was 17 to when i turned 21, I only spent about 4 weeks in any area that could be called home.  I was out doing theater. Been thinking about that lately.

      After a year at the Hard Rock Cafe at Universal Citywalk, I quit my job. The short version of the story is this. I was being asked to do more and more hard labor for less money. Ah well, I'll find something up here that's a little less on the gas tank.

      I'm looking into to taking some avid classes at  urlLink Video Symphony . They certify you in avid, and their instruction team is top notch. I just need to figure out a way to get the money. I would need around $30,000 to get me through the year.

      So I made it through the first round of  urlLink project greenlight , but I got cut in the next round. I'm probably going to put up a page where people can check the work out. It was a little heartbreaking but that's show business.

      So I volunteered to do the demo reel for special effects group Captive Audience. I thought I was doing well, but do to an  unfortunate error in miscommunication, they thought it better that one of their in-house fx guys finish the reel. You know in my whole 6 years as an editor that was the first time that I've ever been fired. Oy! It's fine though, I am still on good terms. I'm even going to be doing their website.

      Okay I have sent out the invitations to my partners in crime. Hopefully they will respond because I firmly believe that this will be a very productive venture.

      Trying to decide between cutting the film on either a  urlLink final cut pro system , and  urlLink avid , or a  urlLink lightworks  touch system. Really tough to decide between the three. Any comments?
