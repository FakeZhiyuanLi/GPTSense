      Joyous is the day that you find out that one of your recently completed projects at work has caused a problem... and that the factory is full of this new 'problem'.  I think that I am lucky in that this is not causing a real yield hit, just causing some end of line testing to shift.  Still, I had to break out the mad skills to change my crap back to the 'old way' and now start up some old work that was un-necessary b/c of my previous 'triumph'.  I still got it, I won't need it in a few months when I leave, but I still got it.  On another front  urlLink TheMickster  has joined the ranks.  Props to her.    I can't watch the NBA playoffs for any duration.  The thuggery on defense and the travelling on offense is a horror for any purist to watch.

      When I go back to school, my wife and I will be living apart.  This will be difficult at times, but it is for the better good of our future.  What will be difficult is that we have to divide all of "our stuff" up between us.  This basically comes down to who gets the Tivo unit.  She will be getting it most likely b/c I won't have DirecTV in my graduate dorm (we have a DirecTV Tivo unit - very nice).  Now I must either buy another or go without.  Anyone who has Tivo would understand that going without is pretty damn hard.  So I will be buying another.  Looking around on the web, I should be able to upgrade whatever I buy with a second or a bigger hard drive.  you of course void the warranty, but cheap Tivo with lots of space = good.  Anyone else with experience hacking Tivo?    This also lead to me thinking about hacking DirecTV, but a quick google search turned up info that it is time consuming, capital intensive, and hacking DirecTV carries more fines than hacking Tivo I'm sure.    Bottom line, Tivo rocks.  If you ain't got it, get it!

      Since I am leaving my job in the next few weeks to return to school, I am ramping down at work.  My replacement is here and I am bringing him up to speed on big picture issues.  Those of you that have ever left a job or hung onto a job when you knew that you were leaving can probably relate easily.  I wonder if everyone goes through periods of low motivation or am I just a big ass slacker?  There are times when it pains me to read email or deal with day to day issues and other times when I just crank through it all.  It seems a lot like 'senioritis' but you would think that people mature and push through all of that crap.  Am I slacker or does this happen with everybody?  I have no desire to tell my boss off or anything extreme like that.  My group has been good to me and I will leave on good terms.    Everyone thinks that they work hard and are truly a worthwhile addition to their workplace.  Have you ever asked yourself how easy are you to replace?  All my company needs is another intelligent body and two months of training from me.  The last part could be picked up in three months of work by the new employee with some help from his/her new peers.  I am quite easy to replace as I am sure is the case with 95% of workers.

       urlLink The Phantom of the Opera  is coming to Indianapolis Nov 10 through Dec 5!  Tickets go on sale June 14th!  Excellent.  I saw Phantom for the first time in Feb 2004 during the Austin, TX stop and it was fantastic.  I've been on a big Phantom kick recently and this show stop will work out great.  Hope to see it during Thanksgiving weekend.  Once again I will get to enjoy the music of the night...

      What an unproductive weekend.  While I did do some good by volunteering some time on Friday and Sunday with  urlLink The CenTex Starzz girls high school AAU team .  I keep wondering if I was this stubborn when I was in HS.  It feels like the coaches have to continuously push to get the girls to play hard all the time.  Several of them are really good.  Maybe not Div I, but several could get scholarships somewhere.  It is a blast to coach and hang out with some people who know what basketball is all about and more importantly, how to teach it.    I did take a few breaks to catch some flicks this weekend though.  First up to bat was "The Karate Kid".  I paid money to watch this crappy 80's movie so that I could also hear the fine gentlemen of  urlLink Mr Sinus Theater  tear the movie a new one.  The Mr Sinus folk are much like Mystery Science Theater 3000 except they focus on modern bad movies and they do it all live in the theater as you watch.  Bonus points for them because the theater in which they perform is the  urlLink Alamo Drafthouse .  A theater where you can order dinner and DRINK BEER.  I have seen Mr Sinus rip up Terminator, Top Gun (hilarious) and KK.  Up next is Dirty Dancing.  I'm counting the days...  I also saw Shrek 2 this weekend.  It was pretty good, but not as amusing as the original in my mind.  LOTS of good one liners and visual gags.  You have to pay attention or you will miss it.  I wonder how many Starbucks cafes were in the movie...  It's worth it and I got my laughs worth.  On the future front, I am anxiously awaiting my return to the Midwest where I will start business school at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management in September.  It will be a great change of pace and more importantly it will move my wife and I back to the Midwest where all of our families live.  No more flying for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Can I get an amen?  The only big task left to complete in Austin is to sell our home.  Keeping the axe to the grindstone is difficult.  I have at most 10 weeks of work left.  Not that I am counting...

      Taking the Nestea plunge and starting a blog...  My wife, KC, will probably just role her eyes and say, "Hopefully someone out there will finally listen to your babbling.  Someone might even find you amusing."  Yes, maybe.

         These last few weeks before our move have been hectic.  The relocation company was a "pleasure" to work with.  It could have gone much faster if people were face to face, but we got to play phone tag for two weeks.  I am now in the process of disconnecting current utilities and setting up new ones.  DirecTV seems to be the biggest challenge (so far).  Disconnecting will be easy, but we will have to go through a slightly different route to hook up new service.  Normally, DirecTV will just coordinate the setup of your dish at your new address.  But, because our new home is in a NRTC area (anti-monopoly type creation) we will need to work with the local service provider.  It doesn't look too bad from this end, but it could be deceiving.      On top of all of this utility moving is the address changing portion as well.  Cell phones, credit cards, student loans, car payments...  Ugh.  A web page should be created that is called www.immovingandhereismynewaddress.com.      Thank goodness that we don't' have to pack, load and drive our crap ourselves.  My lovely wife's company will pay for all of that :)    I did see Dodgeball this weekend.  It is pretty funny, but not as funny as Zoolander.  See it during the matinee if possible or just wait for rental.  Not a Saturday night flick.

      Wife has been out of town since Wednesday but of course these would be the busiest two days I have had at work for a while.  I got to enjoy the rest of my 'bachelorhood' by giving cats antibiotics, running silly errands and finally relaxing by watching an edited replay of the 1993 Indiana @ Penn St Men's basketball game.  IU had waxed Penn St (who was 'enjoying' their first year in the Big 10) at IU by ~50.  Penn St played tough and pushed the then #1 Hoosiers to 2OT.  In the end, the bad team found a way to lose by not scoring when they could push the lead to 2-3 possesions (even though IU's two big men - Alan Henderson and Matt Nover had fouled out and Big John Ameci (sp) ruling the paint) and not playing zone defense worth a crap.  The game will always be remembered for a controversial call. A Penn St player was streaking towards the hoop (with pass on the way) Chris Reynolds of IU grabbed his jersey and the player retaliated with an push off elbow.  The official called the push off foul, but did not call / see the jersey grab.  The Penn St coach went ballistic and IU (down by two) tied the game to go to OT when Greg Graham was fouled while shooting a 3.  He made 2/3 and in the end the bad team won...

      My wife and I headed into Memorial Weekend with good news in that we received an offer on our home.  We made a counter and they accepted.  This is great news and timing as we were starting to get worried about getting rid of the home so we could move worry free.  With that taken care of, we only need to square away the details with the moving company and figure out how we can entertain our two cats for the long drive North.    This weekend is setup nicely.   urlLink Robert Randoph & The Family Band   at  urlLink Stubb's  tonight and an engagement party for some friends tomorrow.    I should be able to fend off the wife from seeing the latest Harry Potter movie, but she might have to see it late Sunday night like we saw Shrek (read - no kids...)
