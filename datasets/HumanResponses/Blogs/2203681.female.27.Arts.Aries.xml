						     Some oil candles that can be filled with oderless and smokeless pure liquid wax peraffin  Also, I found some plastic little bowls, that are flower shaped, but really nice, they look like an opened flower, if that makes sense.  They are meant to be for dipping sauces, but they are the perfect size for votive candles, to put aroud the tables.  They are also only 33 cents a piece, yes, thats $0.33 each, and they have different ones to choose from, may be worth looking into.    even though the traditional glass and crystal looking ones above are really nice, I like these too, especially if you're going for the semi-medieval look at the wedding.  They remind me of "towers" like those found on castles.  They are $19.95 each on this site, but I'm sure we can research them and find a similar product for cheaper.             Rocks, flowers, and fire, what more could you want...      Check out this site.  There's an ausome wine decanter that matches some of the oil canldes.  It's cool, and it's animated to show you how it's done. http://www.illusionglass.com/  More to come later.

						   And here I am again, Friends and Family!   Here is the list of various bed & breakfasts, inns and lodges in the Geneva, Penn Yan, Canandaigua, Seneca Falls, Waterloo area. Take a look around and see if one of these options fits you better than one of the regular hotels like Holiday Inn or Ramada. Some of these places may or may not ask you to book for 2 nights instead of one because of the weekend and all the grape harvest events that happen at that time of the year in the Finger Lakes Region, but you never know. Give them a call and see what they say. In the meantime, if you need anything else, you know where to reach me. Enjoy!

						   Hello, all!  I hope your Holidays have been awesome and your New Years will be even better.  I hope to see more you all in the coming year, as you certainly will be hearing more from me.  I have posted some links to maps of the areas around Keuka Park, NY (where our Ceremony will be held) and Geneva, NY (where our Reception will be held).  These should be simple to read, a bit better than the ones on our Wedding Channel Website.  I have also included links to websites about New York State in general and the Finger Lakes Region in particular.  This should give you some great ideas on things to do if you should find yourself bored when you come to the Big Event.  The Finger Lakes Region is Wine Country, so you should find lots of great things to do and places to explore!  Enjoy your browsing and everything should be really clear, but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.  Thank you and enjoy!   urlLink Mapquest New York State Map    urlLink 3-D Finger Lakes Area Image    urlLink I Love NY Information on Finger Lakes Region    urlLink I Love NY PDF Map    urlLink Finger Lakes Wine Country    urlLink Finger Lakes Wine Tours    urlLink Finger Lakes Wine Map    urlLink Mapquest Kueka Park & Surrounding Area Map    urlLink Mapquest Geneva & Surrounding Area Map

						   Welcome to April, everyone!    It's been a while since I last wrote in here.  Things have been very busy both at home and work.  The new apartment is coming along nicely.  We are sorely lacking in furniture, but we are miles ahead of where we used to be.  We are in Astoria in a really cool 2 floor apartment that's really feeling more and more like home everyday.  As our Wedding Website stated, we have found some furniture on the web that exactly what we have been looking for.  Click on the sites below and take a look at what we've found.  The baker's rack of my dreams, with chairs and stool to boot...woohoo!!:    urlLink http://greatpricedfurniture.com/products/5722.html   urlLink http://greatpricedfurniture.com/products/51234802.html   The day bed and trundle we've always wanted:  urlLink http://www.furnitureontheweb.com/frames/items/008992.html   Oh, vanity, where have you been all my life!?!:  urlLink http://store.yahoo.com/hfsn/whithanpainw.html   The kitchen island we'd love to be stranded on:  urlLink http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=pd_rhf_p_2/602-2916942-4667062?asin=B0000BYQ4N   A bed to behold!:  urlLink http://www.bigapplefuton.com/cgi-bin/detail_futon.cfm?GroupID=88   A sofa, a loveseat, my kingdom for a living room!:  urlLink http://www.jenniferfurniture.com/   Loving this table to death:  urlLink http://store.yahoo.com/hfsn/36buttiltopt.html   Multi-use coffee tables ROCK!!!:  urlLink http://www.ourgrandchild.com/game-table/coffee.html   A pattern I've fallen for:  urlLink http://www.winterthurgifts.com/product.cfm?mc=0&ct=0&sid=2234        And if you're feeling froggy, and don't want to go through our Registries, feel free to jump in and pitch in to help furnish our apartment.  Matt's mom suggested this idea, and if you're willing, then by all means and thank you in advance.  Not much else to tell for now.  I will keep updating as things keep happening and our date gets closer and closer.  In the meantime, take care and Happy April and all that comes with it!

The prologue to a bright new year!  Quite a night!  I'm impressed!  Well, one does one's best ... Here's to us!  I must say all the same that it's a shame that 'Phantom' fellow isn't here!    Masquerade  !  Paper faces on parade ...   Masquerade  !  Hide your face so the world will never find you!    Masquerade  !  Every face a different shade ...   Masquerade  !  Look around there's another mask behind you!   Flash of mauve ... Splash of puce ... Fool and king ... Ghoul and goose ...  Green and black ... Queen and priest ... Trace of rouge ... Face of beast ...   Faces! ...  Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round ... in an inhuman race ...   Eye of gold ... Thigh of blue ... True is false ... Who is who ...  Curl of lip ... Swirl of gown ... Ace of hearts ... Face of clown ...   Faces! ...  Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned ... in the light ... in the sound ...  But who can name the face?   Masquerade  !  Grinning yellows, spinning reds ...   Masquerade  !  Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you!    Masquerade  !  Burning glances, turning heads ...   Masquerade  !  Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!    Masquerade  !  Seething shadows, breathing lies ...   Masquerade  !  You can fool any friend who ever knew you!    Masquerade  !

Burning glances, turning heads ...  Masquerade  !  Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!    Masquerade  !  Grinning yellows, spinning reds ...  Masquerade  !  Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you!   Hello, again, all!  I trust by now, most of you have gotten your magnets and info cards.  Some may have not as we may still be searching for some addresses.  But hopefully, you will soon.  And probably, by now, you may have read it over several times and wonder whether or not it really does say, "Wedding and Masquerade Ball."  Well, yes.  It really does say "Wedding and Masquerade Ball."  You may ask yourself, "Why?"  To which my answer would be, "Why not?"    If you are confused by this proclamation, or stressed out in any way about it, guess what - don't.  If you really want to stress, stress about the economy, or your taxes, the government or our environment.  Or pick something else.  Your choice.  Our reception is not something you need to stress about.    By now, you most likely have read the definitions of masked balls and masquerades I have posted above.  And you must also have read the lyrics to my favorite piece in Andrew Lloyd Weber's  The Phantom of the Opera .  That's all it really means.  A party with masks.  You don't have to wear costumes, unless you really really want to take your imagination for a spin.  And if you do, I have to say, YOU ROCK and more power to you.  But if you do, please refer to such movie classics as  Ever After ,  Labyrinth ,  The Man in the Iron Mask , or  Much Ado About Nothing , to see the kind of costumes that would be appropriate for our wedding.  There are masked balls in each of these films for you to get some excellent ideas from.  You can go all out if you see something you like that fits our theme, but no modern day costumes.  Let's keep it in period.    Attire for our wedding is  Formal, Black Tie Optional  - that means ball gowns, cocktail dresses, dark suits or tuxes.  However, this in no way means that the colors have to be somber.  They really don't.  Not at all!  Glitz it up and dress it up with lots of color and glam.  The more, the merrier!  I am in theatre, you know, so if you need help and ideas, let me know.  This is a Masquerade Ball, people! So lots of color will make it even better.  Don't be shy!  And we are having this party in a castle...um...pretend you're royalty.  Remember, you only live once!  And I encourage it.  Besides, when are you ever going to go to a Masquerade Ball in a Castle, like...ever again?  That stuff only ever happens in books or movies, folks.  So let's all take advantage here.  P.S. - Invitees with kids, they're gonna love this and have lots of fun in the process.  And if you happen to come across a mask you like while you are out and about and you feel it really goes with what you might want to wear, by all means, wear it.  I kind of didn't want to reveal this part, but I will seeing as there is such confusion about this issue - there will be masks there.  All kinds - both Venetian and Mardi Gras styles - all with lots of feathers and colors and colorful, sparkly things attached.  So I hope this helps clear the air some.  I don't want anyone having a meltdown about what's going to happen at this party.  Please let me be the only one having meltdowns here.  In the meantime, take care of yourselves and please don't hesitate to contact us if anyone has any other questions or concerns.  We love you and hope you all are well and we hope you keep checking up on this website to see the updates on new things as they come up.  Again, take care and we hope to hear more from you soon!  Love always, Liza and Matt

						   Dear Friends and Family,       I know that it has been some time since my last blog, so I apologize, but I am back and have some things to tell.  By now, I imagine most, if not all, of you have gotten your invitiations.  I hope everything finds you well and happy.  Things for Matt and myself are beyond crazy thanks to the planning of this...event.  There seem to be more and more things to do and the pile is getting endless.  But we are hanging in there and surviving one day at a time.  I hear that Boston folks are planning a caravan and New York folks are really excited.  I am very happy to hear this.  And thank you for all the wonderful comments on the invitations.  I purchased all the supplies from Paper Presentation in Chelsea (on 18th Street) and printed everything else myself with the help of Laurie Hooper and Katie McGrath - ladies, I owe you the world!        So, having said that, I wanted to add some fun things to this site.  There are some links I have found that will connect you to a few of the wine trails in the area of Belhurst and Norton Chapel and here they are:   urlLink www.cayugawinetrail.com    urlLink www.senecawine.com    urlLink www.keukawinetrail.com   If you look at The Cayuga Wine Trail, look under events, and scroll down to the weekend of October 9th & 10th, you will see that there is a  urlLink Harvest Festival  going on at the King Ferry Winery/Treleaven.  The scenery is gorgeous and the people are friendly and it looks like fun and I have heard that some people are already planning a caravan there.  I hope as many of you as possible go as it promises to be a blast.  I may not be able to go as I am almost sure that I will running around like the proverbial chicken without a head at that time, getting and putting together the last minute details of this Gala Production, as my friend Catherine Pouch would put it.        So, I hope this helps with your planning.  I look forward to speaking with and seeing all of you soon.  I miss you lots and wish you lots of good things.  Wish us lots of luck with the planning of this and we will all see each other soon.  Take care!  Lotsa love and best wishes, Liza & Matt.

						   Dear Friends and Family,       First of all, I would like to, again, thank very much everyone who came to the Reilly Shower this past weekend.  Thank you thank you thank you soooooo very very much for everything.  It was awesome to feel so welcomed into the family.  I just want you to know how much I appreciated it.  Matt keeps asking me, where are we going to put everything?  I keep telling him, don't worry, we'll find a place.  So thank you again Reilly's for the shower.        For those of you who don't know the Reilly side of Matt's family, you will.  Matt's Mom - Patricia - has lots of sisters and brother: Kathleen, Colleen, Suzy, Annie, Betsey, Jimmy, JN and Mary (who, sadly, passed away some years ago).  They were the ones who gave me the Shower that happened last weekend.  Annie and Kathleen and Mom Keville took lots of pictures which they promised to send to me on a CD so I can attempt to post them on this website.  Wish me luck!       There's another one coming up next week - Saturday, the 14th of August at Mom and Dad Keville's house at Panther Lake.  CRAZINESS!!!  But I know it will be fun as well.  This one is for the Keville side of the family.  That's another can of beans just waiting to jump out.  Katie and Meaghan and Mom Keville will be hosting it.  It's going to be nothing but enjoyable madness.  Woohoo!      In other news, things in the planning arena are going well.  Alot of last minute running around, bills and wedding bills to pay and such.  The usual.  I do have something important to warn everyone of...   For those of you who are booking your hotel rooms - PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO DO SO ON YOUR OWN...I REPEAT...PLEASE DO NO TRY TO DO SO ON YOUR OWN...What I mean by this is there are no hotel rooms available in the area if you look online.  You have to call the number that is listed and either give them the number that we have listed for our block of rooms OR call and tell them you are part of the RAMIREZ/KEVILLE WEDDING BLOCK.  This is very important.  And keep in mind that time is running out to book rooms.  They will all be released one month prior to the date of the wedding. strong>       That is all I have to say for that warning.        There is really nothing else to say at the moment.  I hope everyone is taking care of themselves and enjoying the warm weather.  Although lately, it's been a bit too warm for me.        Well, that's is about it for this installment.  I love you all and wish you nothing but the best!  And don't be strangers!  Love,  Always,  Liza*
