       urlLink The Continuing Saga of The Booyawh Mystery   So what do I say? This weekend's got 6 kinds of trouble, 19 kinds of cool, and 51 weekends to sit up and take notice of what's possible.  Tomorrow I should, finally, get my car back from the shop, but there's no guarauntees when it comes to that. After that, I'll get to leave work early to hit the road in a ytd vehicle to head back to H-town for a night-before-the-ceremony hangout.  Saturday morning, golf with the Op's, grab Jen-Jen, go to the wedding, reception -- yeah -- there are going to be enough demons lurking at that wedding that you might be able to confuse it with my personal purgatory.  Sunday, golf with the newly engaged Mr. Paul.  God only knows what lies inbetween point a and getting back to point a Sunday night.  ------------------------  It used to happen at very specific times. The first time I remember it was this strange feeling that crept down my spine and overpowered me it was playing catcher in little league.  Sitting in my crouch, I had to go out to the mound and get Alex to throw a damn strike. After walking a few in a row, that was my job. I froze. I didn't know what to do, what to say.  I shot up outta my crouch after diving in the dirt to get ball 4 and called time. Jogging to the mound my mind was a wash. Every parent there is telling the person next to them "What's a 12 year old going to do?" "That kid can't do anything." "He's going to make that pitcher feel bad."  My coach that year was a friend of mine's dad. Great guy. Told me I did the right thing after the inning.  I don't remember much about the meeting, but I felt like I had the weight of the world on me. I'd only been catchin' about 2 years and never had done this before. The shortstop or someone would always go and then I'd join and nod my head along in agreement...yeah team!  "If you're going to miss, miss inside on this guy."  That's the one line I remember. The batter was a guy in my class. Later in life I'd learn to love the guy, but at the time, no love lost if he got whacked in the head.  Alex struck him out on three consecutive balls high and inside. He kept swingin', and he kept throwin' right on by.  -----------------------  I got that feeling later on before football games, after warmups. After the lockerroom talks. See, there's like 2 minutes where you get out of the pre-game meeting after stretches. When the tunnel's forming to run through. Everybody's jumping around, shakin' out all the bugs in the system. You're looking at the field, the lights, the crowd, the empty scoreboard. Sometimes you felt flat. Sometimes you thought this was your night.  Then, like a bolt of lightning, without so much as a word said, you bolted through a tunnel of cheerleaders and people onto the field to the sound of the fightsong, piled on each other in a huddle on the sideline and a few people would say a few quick words.  That wasn't for me. I wasn't the pre-game preacher.   Instead, I remember being out, recieving the opening kickoff. I was the center of the first wedge. Point. I was going to have at least 4 to 6 guys running at me with a 30 yard head-start. At a dead standstill, most times, I'd stand side-by-side with my guys and get mowed down. The idea was to become  a wall. Take as many of 'em out as possible, make'em go around, just not through.  The principal behind my job when we were kicking was the exact opposite. I was one of two things. Either the last guy down the field, the "oh shit there he goes, he's only got one guy to beat..." that guy...or I was the wedge buster. I don't have to tell you how nice it was to whack someone else for a change. You just ran your ass off, feeling like you were alive for the first time. There are a thousand people watching you...your job is to run at some kid named 90 and put your helmet in his chest.  Damn.  That was it. The feeling right then. You see the kicker start to move and you're either running away or at. Either way that feeling was all you could feel. The last thing you wanted was  to faulter on the first play...  ------------------------  There was a song in jazz my junior year. It was a helluva an honor. I had a solo piece. I think it was a thanks, or at least I always have taken it as one, by Mr C. Since there was a senior and my more capable counterpart in my class, and I got it, I had to take it as one.  I stood out front at festival, forgetting ever note, standing in the limelight, alone. The first time it was Joe and the band. The last time it was Joe and the band. I started it. No one else. I could stand out there for an hour and everyone had to sit ready. Damn right.  That first run was the most difficult thing I'd ever done. Not musically, but just getting my horn to make a sound. Having spent a ton of time on stage in high school, it was a unique experience -- and that's what baffled me under the light. I couldn't see a damn thing and that was probably my saving grace.  You see, I'm still scared of the dark. I sleep with a light on most nights. I hate it.  But those nights that I lie in bed, in darkness, I tell myself the same thing that broke that limelight, the samething that broke my feet from the ground as that football flew through the air, and the same thing that got me out of my crouch in little league -- if it's going to come, let it come.  Wrecklessness is a saving grace that few tend to embrace. Yet, it doesn't take much of a good look around to see it everywhere.  Most of my friends that have become happier in recent times than any other span of time in their lives, it's due to this same wrecklessness. You can rename it to make it sound nicer to Grandma, but at the end of the day, you threw caution to the wind and said bring it on.  ------------------------  The whole point of it all is that I get that feeling still. I can see it coming to a much greater extent than I used to be able to, but the point isn't foresight here. That feeling can't be dealt with by preparing for it, building a ditch and hunkerin' down, or anything else for that matter. It's coming.  Why? It's the event. It's getting that foot outta the dirt for the first time with purpose, it's putting that first note against the wall in the back of the auditorium. It's putting on a mask and being the rock in a time of crisis. It's hiding inside yourself.  It's coming this weekend.  ----------------------  There's not much I can do about it really. I've seen it coming for a while now. If I can just get going, there's no telling where the ball's going to roll. But just like a ridge in a green, you've gotta get it over, but let it roll back down on it's own.  I'll be more scared the day that I don't get those butterflies, I believe.  ----------------------  I hope she knows I'll be ready for that moment this time. I hope I know to be ready for that moment this time. I hope that moment knows to make it self known this time.  ----------------------  No one's going to tell you to go to the mound.  Sometimes you've gotta just take a step without looking.  This is the night we ride.
