      All right children.... let me tell you a little story.  You see... I was born a poor black child... oops wait that was from a movie.... name that movie and I'll give you a prize....  Anyway, when I was 16, way back in the day, I was with my friend Big Ohio.  Big Ohio and I were driving around in my car a big black 57 chevy bel-air two door hard-top sports coup.  It was this huge lead sled that was simpy badass... but I digress...  So me and Big Ohio are driving and he says we should head to his girl's house.  I'm thinkin' who's this girl, she must be new.  Then he tells me we're going to her house and I might like her friend.  So when we get to this girl's house I walk in and this girl slaps me in the face.  I don't mean literally, but that's what it was like, a good hard slap in the face.  Her name was the One and man I fell like a ton of bricks.  But, as these stories go, she had a boyfriend.  Not only was he her boyfriend but he was one of my ex-best friends.  He and I were great friends at one point in the 8th grade, then we had a falling out, as these things sometimes happen.  His name was Nemesis and he was out of town for a month.  That meant that I got to spend lots and lots of time with the One while Nemesis was out of the loop.    So things are progressing nicely and me and the One are hitting it off like spam and potatos.  Then one night Big Ohio's girl Psycho-Circus throws a fit and says me and the One can't hang out anymore because something might happen and that wouldn't be fair to Nemesis.  So the One gives a speech in which she claims that "nothing's going to happen" with yours truly because she's in love with Nemesis.  I fell in love and she broke my heart all in the same sentance.   "You love her, and she loves him, and he loves somebody else, you just can't win... and so it goes until the day you die, this thing they call love is gonna make you cry."    Time passes....   Anyways, nothing ever happened with the One and 10 years later I'm living with Piano-Girl.  I had moved from my home town of Louisville to Honolulu, Hawaii.  One day I get a call and it's from the One.  She says she's been living in Boston and just moved to Honolulu.  I must admit I had a bit of a panic attack.  I mean, here is my first love calling me out of the blue after almost 10 years.  The One that got away has somehow managed to cross time and space and now shows up on my doorstep.  I must admit that all this messed with my head.  But as these things go, in the interim I had met and fallen in love with a beautiful girl and was as happy as I'd ever been.  I'd even almost proposed to piano-girl.  So Piano-girl and the One become best friends.  This causes me some discomfort from time to time. I find that I really enjoy the few times I get to spend with the One when it's just us.  She even recommends a book to me that turns out to be one of my all-time favorites... longitude.  I'm conflicted but I decide that I can't dump my love for a memory.  About a year later I leave Hawaii and the One behind.  Piano-Girl has set up the One with a guy named Hawke.  The reason Piano-Girl sets up the One with Hawke is because (and I quote) "he's a lot like you."  Needless to say, Hawke and the One hit it off very well.  So well in fact that about a year ago they got married.  [Insert your favorite country song lyrics here.]  Piano-girl and I move to Chicago and live there for about a year.  Then Piano-girl announces that she wants to go back to Hawaii for one year to finish her classes.  We decide that it would be best if I stay in Chicago, we have a dog, etc. and that if I stay and work we'll have more money than if both of us move back to Hawaii.  Upon her return to Hawaii, Piano-girl talks to the One.  The One suggests the Piano-girl move into a house that the One's sister has just moved out of.  This house has three guys living there now and one extra bedroom.  So Piano-girl asks me if I minded her living with three guys and I said no problem.  (I actually thought that she would be safer and since the guys were friends of the One I wasn't worried.)  A few weeks later I'm in Chicago eating lunch with a friend, Wise-man.  I tell Wise-man about my girlfriend of 7.5 years who's in Hawaii living in a house with three dudes.  Wise-man starts laughing and says "how long before she starts fucking one of them?"  I didn't find this funny.  I get all rightous and indignant and give him a speech.  I tell him that I'm not sure of anything in this world.  As far as I'm concerned the sun may not rise tomorrow, but there is one thing I can count on.  That thing is Piano-girl.  I know she has enough respect for me and for our relationship that if she's ever going to bone somebody else, she'll break up with me first.  That night she fucked on of her roomates.  Apparently she felt so bad about it that she fucked him again the next night.  So in essence, I fell for a girl who was faithful to her boyfriend at 16 even though she had feelings for me too.  This girl then showed up many years later and tempted me the way I tempted her at 16 and I passed the test as well.  Then the girl that I was faithful to cheated on me with a guy she only would have met because she became friends with the girl I fell for at 16.  And finally the girl I fell for at 16 married a guy she only would have met because of my girlfriend who cheated on me with a guy she only would have met because of the girl I fell for at 16.  Whew!  It's enough to make your head spin.  I'm not a big believer in Fate, but it sure had it's way with me.

      O.k. so I'm not quite yet an immigration lawyer.  Let's just make that perfectly clear.  I graduated from law school recently and I'm taking the bar exam in July.  I already passed the essay portion and I'm down to the MBE.  I missed it by one question.  (don't push me on this I'm still a little sore.)  I'm going to be studying for the next couple of months and I think I'm going to use this to vent my frustrations.  And please don't get me started on George Bush.  From now on he will affectionately be known as G.W. the village idiot.  I also think I'm going to need to vent a bit about another fun part of my life, women.  I love 'em.  But they sure as hell have a way of kicking my ass from time to time.   I think I'll post a few thoughts on my many X's later.  Gotta put the past behind you.. I always say.  But then again... we may be done with the past, but the past may not be done with us.
