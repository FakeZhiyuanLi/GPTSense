      At the moment, it's my lunch break. I had a can of ready-made soup and I'm trying to decide if I want a Lime Coke or not.  I'd generally get my coke at the corner store, referred to around work as the "Brothel Deli" -simply because by day they sell sandwiches and by night...well, you can figure it out. But perhaps I can resist today and therefore avoid the brothel row walk.  You've probably figured out by now that I work in a district in which the day-time occupation is general commerce-type jobs and after about 7 o'clock the common prostitutes come out. Lovely area really. No wonder Jace won't let me take the bus to work.   Currently, I work for  urlLink Internet Business Corporation  (IBC for short). I am the Marketing and Business Development Coordinator. To translate, it means that I do workshops, PR stuff for the company and its products, copywriting, and sales. Everyone wears multiple hats by force, being a small company, as opposed to the preferred reason, which I would be tempted to say is fashionable choice. As mentioned, I'm on the outskirts of the city but every so often I'll walk into the city during lunch to meet up with Jace. He works for  urlLink Apache Energy , an American oil and gas firm. Go figure he gets the perfect international company and I get the web development role in the red light district... but I guess if I don't get a raise I can easily pick up another job on the side. Score.

      This is our blog. I hope that everyone can use this to keep up to date on what we're doing and what life is like in Australia...  I'll probably write more than Jace, but he's a contributor none-the-less, in one way or another.  The wedding pics are for nostalgia purposes. Let's all say it together.. "Ahhh..."

      I must say it...Nobody, simply nobody... makes croissants like the French. I say this because there's this quaint little French patisserie around the corner from my current job (current for only 1.48 more hours I must say) called Les Papillon (or The Butterfly for everyone that, as I did, would have to look it up on  urlLink Babelfish ) that makes the most fantastic almond croissants-fresh, flakey little fattening layers with the most delicate, butter-coloured almond cream paste filling. They're magic... I'll probably miss having the Papillon in the vicinity more than anything...That's not really true...the team here at  urlLink IBC  is pretty cool all in all.  Jace is on a pub crawl tonight with his mate Beamo-it's his 24th birthday. I will probably catch up later, just in time to carry him home. Until then, I'm surfing  urlLink Jamie Oliver's blog , eating a Kit Kat and counting the hours. For a bit of fun though for you as well, check out the " urlLink This Land " cartoon from JibJab.

      I've finally found a new job! Starting on the 16th of August I'll be the Marketing Coordinator for  urlLink iinet . This rocking new job will enable me to get into the nitty gritty of the tough ISP Industry in Australia and dabble in things such as broadband packages, VoIP programs, telephony and more. I can't wait... My last day at  urlLink IBC  is tomorrow and I imagine if the past few days are indicative of tomorrow's atmosphere, it's going to be a quiet one. Nevertheless, drinks at the Queens to celebrate... er, I mean, say "goodbye." You can continue to keep in touch with me via my home  urlLink email  address. Look forward to hearing from you.

       urlLink    This is the vacant lot where we decided to build our first home. It almost brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?
