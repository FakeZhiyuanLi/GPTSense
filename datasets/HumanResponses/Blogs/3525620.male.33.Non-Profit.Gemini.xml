       urlLink Yahoo! News - Rising U.S. Homeownership Brings Woes - Study   I'm glad that last night my wife and I decided to not be apart of the statistics that this article discusses.  Me, being a bottomline type of guy and my wife, wise and understanding, decided to hold off on your plans to purchase a home.  Even though we were approved for a mortgage loan, we both felt uncomfortable with making such a commitment at this time.  We therefore decided to give ourselves a six month time-frame to increase our income and savings and also eliminate some of our debts.  Though foregoing homeownership at this time may cause us to lose out on current low interest rates, I would rather be able to comfortably afford my home and maintain my lifestyle, than to be house poor and risk foreclosure.  I guess what was wonderful about the situation is that my wife and I both had similar sentiments.  We didn't want to make any rash decisions that would've risked our future.  During our conversation, we both confirmed that we were committed to striving to improve our lifestyle.  That's the main reason my wife has decided to return to school and major in nursing.  She stated, sure I could get a job in retail or as a secretary or whatever, but I want to contribute to our household in a substantial way.  After hearing that, I told my wife, I am committing myself to take my liscensure examination this summer, which would make me certified in my profession.  Ultimately, being certified could translate to a $10000 - $20000 increase in salary.  That is my short term goal, which would instantly put us into a totally different realm of possibilities.  Well until next time, please take time out daily to just think.   Thinking just might be the single most important act that could make the difference between your success or your failure.

      Opportunity, is it always present or is it once in a blue moon?  When is it best to go after opportunity and when is it not?  These are questions that I'm currently asking myself.  I believe I'm a natural born opportunist rooted in wisdom and realism.    The question that I'm asking is,  can it be wrong to pass on opportunity when you feel and believe it may not be the right time?   Actually, opportunity from what I've gathered is when luck and preparation meet.  I feel somewhat lucky that I was approved for a home loan for the price range that I wanted.  However, I just don't think I have everything in order.  For example, I need to increase my monthly income and reduce my current debt to feel comfortable enough to commit myself to a mortgage payment.  Then if I say no, I don't want to disappoint my family.  So what should I do?  Well opportunity should put you on the path of progression rather than regression.  The path that you choose to walk down will determine whether or not you'll pursue certain opportunities.  I am not a pessimist, but I'm just cautious and I like to operate within reality.  Reality dictates that if I commit to this mortgage, there really won't be any wiggle room or margin for error.  Also, we have a baby on the way and that in itself is going to increase our monthly expenditures.  I guess to summarize, my response is the same that I give when people ask me how did I know my wife was the one?   When you know, you just know.   The fact that you have doubts or unanswered questions, should be the red flags.  There's no philosophical explanation, no magic formula or anything.  When that opportunity is for you, a sense of confidence and peace enshrouds you.   The bottom line is that it's okay to say no to some opportunities, especially if it is not time or it was not intended for you.

      There is so much going on right now in our lives and it seems like everyone is looking to us (my family) for answers.    My response is, WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU WANT FROM US???  How dare you try to fit me into your box, just because you might take pills if you're depressed, just because you've done it a certain way all of your life, just because your house looks a certain way, doesn't give you any authority, what so ever to judge me and my house.  You see, the Bible implores us to not judge others.  It also points out, how can we talk about the speck in our brother's eye, when we have a plank in ours.  That reminds me of when Clinton was president and the republicans just brow beat him, because of his personal misdeeds.  However, here we are several years later and we are witnessing what the republicans have been doing in the dark.  For example, Connecticut's republican governor is currently on the verge of impeachment for corruption charges, then there's the representative I believe from one of the Dakotas or one of those Northern states, who was recently convicted of killing someone while driving drunk.  Then Mr. Rush Limbaugh (the grand puba himself) a self-admitted drug addict, is on the verge of divorcing his wife after 10 years.  Finally, our beloved Mr. Bush can take full credit for attempting to resolve his personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, at the expense of our military(Can you say, "Mob Boss" - Godfather Bush).  Furthermore, they stated that Clinton lied under oath, but what do you call a President that starts a war based on nothing else but hearsay, fallacy and false pretense.  I call it "The fleecing of America."  I've come to the conclusion, that  it is just flat out easier to point out the faults of others, rather than fess up and take responsibility for our own shortcomings.   I don't want to end this posting on a negative note, so the bottom line is as follows: Strength is characterized by dealing with reality.  No matter how difficult that may be, it's the hand that we've been dealt.  One of my favorite cliches is  "it's not a matter of what you have, but it's what you do with what you have that's important."   So for everyone out there, who desires to be my personal Jesus Christ, get off your cross, 'cause I need the wood.

      I haven't blogged in a week, because it has been a difficult week.  However, I hope that writing today will help in clearing my mind and bring clarity to my thoughts.  Earlier this week my step daughter became ill while visiting her birth father.  So my wife and I dropped what we were doing on last Sunday and picked her up.  She had been gone for a week, which is the longest she has ever been away from us.  It was such a delight to have her back home.  I really didn't realize how much energy and vitality she brings to our lives and home.  She was having problems with her mouth, I believe it is called thrush or something like that.  Anyway, she had stopped eating and was crying because her mouth was in pain.  Also, I believe her wisdom teeth are beginning to grow in.  Anyway, when she got home we gave her a bath and made her brush her teeth.  We also fed her without a problem and we made her drink water.  She claimed that she had only brushed her teeth once while at her dad's.  Also, she stated that she had eaten a lot of candy.  Since it was the weekend, we couldn't take her to the doctor until Monday.  My wife has class every morning from 7:30 to 9:30, so I took off from work to stay with my daughter.  When my wife returned home we took our daughter to the doctor.  After that we came back home and ate.  Then, that afternoon my wife had an appointment with a pre-natal specialist.  So we went to the appointment where we found out that we're having a baby boy.  However, the doctor noticed a cloudy looking area in the baby's brain, which appears that the baby may have down sysdrome.  The news wasn't devastating, but my wife and I were concerned.  Our reaction was more of uncertainty and numbness.  We really didn't know what to say or how to react.  I guess the fact that we've experienced so much in recent times, that nothing really devastates us anymore.  It's kind of like, "well here we go again."  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but that's how we responded.  The doctor was going to do a test on the baby to determine if the baby has down syndrome or not, but we opted to not do anything at that time, because with the test, there is a risk for miscarriage.  However, as we were leaving the hospital, we decided that we would drop by my wife's doctor's office to see if her last blood test revealed anything indicating down syndrome.  The doctor was not in and her nurse stated that she could not speak concerning the blood test, but the doctor would have to talk to us about it.  So we scheduled a test for next week.  Also, that evening we took our daughter back over to her dad's house for the remainder of her summer visitation.  Well my wife continues to go to school, but it appears that it is really taking it's toll on her body.  She goes to bed late doing homework, then she wakes up early to go to class.  She is barely eating, and when she does she throws up.  I'm very concerned about her health, to the point that I told her that she really needs to consider dropping school for now and perhaps after the pregnancy she can resume it.  However, stubborn as usual, she is still determined to complete it.  I think the main reason she continues to go is that she is getting financial aid to go to school, and she's afraid that if she drops her class that that will negatively impact her financial aid.  But I told her that if we have to pay it back, then we'll just pay it back.  Furthermore, I'd rather pay back a couple of $100, than to risk losing you.  It has bothered me so much, that I've practically stopped eating.  I really don't eat, but once a day.  I worry all day about her, because I trully believe that she is doing too much at this time.  On Wednesday night, we had a good meal and we were enjoying the evening together, when my wife started feeling nautious.  She started vomiting, but while vomiting she strained too hard and burst a blood vessel in her esauphagus.  We didn't know the severity of it at that time, but she did start vomiting blood.  So we went to the ER and we were there for 3 hours without seeing a doctor, it was after midnight and my wife was still concerned about her homework and going to school later on that morning.  So we decided to leave the hospital without seeing the doctor.  We got up yesterday morning, my wife went off to school and I went to work.  I got a call around 11am that morning from my mom, indicating that my wife called her, stating that when she came home from school, she started vomiting and blood was once again coming up.  I called my wife immediately, and she was driving herself to the hospital.  I asked why didn't she call me and she stated that she knew that if she had called me I would become alarmed and take off from work to see about her.  She scared that I might get fired, because I take off alot.  But as far as I'm concerned a job is just a means to an end.  Therefore, I can always get multiple or subsequent streams of income, but I can't replace my family.  I didn't get alarmed, but I told her that since it was almost lunch time, I would take an early lunch and meet her at the hospital, which is only 10 to 15 minutes away from my job.  However, my wife had also contacted her best friend and her cousin and they were on their way to the hospital also.  So I decided to just go see about her during my lunch break and then I would return to work.  Well I got to the hospital and I didn't see our car in the ER parking lot.  So I began to panic and suspect that my wife didn't make it to the hospital.  I finally get inside into the ER  and I didn't see my wife, so I asked the nurse and she guided me to where my wife was.  I gave my wife a big hug when I saw her.  She was crying because she was in pain and I guess perhaps she was feeling a little guilty because we didn't stay at the hospital yesterday.  Well anyway, they got her into a room and her best friend arrived, so I literally had to drag myself back to work.  Well this morning she's feeling better, they gave her medicine and told her that she needed to rest.  We went to bed early last night, but we both woke up early, thinking that my wife had to go to school today, but she doesn't have classes on Friday.  We ate breakfast and here I am right now writing.  Also, another issue that has occurred this week, is that we were approved for a home loan with 100% financing at a decent interest rate.  However, I think we are unsure if assuming the responsibility of owning a house is something that we can do right now.  I am not one to pass up on opportunity, but there is so much going on in our lives right now, that looking for a house and preparing for that process, seems just a little bit overwhelming and ominous right now.  So I'm not sure what we're going to do.  We want a house, because our family is expanding, but whenever I think about it, all I can think about is the expense associated with it.  At the moment, I have no clue what to do.  I haven't followed through like I should with the mortgage guy and to be honest with you I haven't even been excited about it, all I'm thinking is I don't know if this is the best thing to do right now or not.  We're not even sure how long we want to live in our state.  I guess if I had to sum it all up, it has been a difficult and complex week, but we're still here and we made it through.  I'm different than I was a week ago, I guess one reason is that my birthday was this week, but that was kind of overshadowed by the events of the week.  I'm really looking for a break through, whether it is a higher paying job, my own business or what.  My optimism is probably at an all time high, but I really don't know where the breakthrough is going to come from or what I need to do to attract the breakthrough.  Anyway, no matter what happens, it sure did feel good to get all of that off my chest.  Well, I hope you have a fantastic day and a wonderful weekend.

      I read an article earlier this week I believe, regarding the American Idol contestants who did not win the competition.  It went into detail about what some of them have done since the show.  It was quite interesting to hear that some have gone on to sign record deals and others acting pursuits.  Also, we may as well consider those who did not win on The Apprentice and America's next top model.  Most of us may refer to them as the losers, because they failed to win the competition.  However, there is an interesting underlying theme that I would like to discuss concerning this year's batch of "losers."  In my book, a loser is one who fails to try.  Unfortunately, most people don't look at it that way.  Have you ever heard of the expression "winning is everything," well that may not necessarily be the case if you consider the life of an opportunist.  I'll go as far as to say, you can even suck and still end up succeeding.  For instance, I believe his name is William Huong, I guess it's spelled that way, I don't know.  Anyway, he wasn't a finalist, yet ended up signing a record deal, appearing at big time musical events and if I'm not mistaken the article that I read indicated that as of that date, he had sold 38,000 albums.  In the music business that's a pathetic sales showing, but let's put it in context.  You have a guy who flat out can't sing, signs a record deal, sells 38,000 albums and we'll assume that the average CD goes for $12, which results in gross sales of $456,000.  Not bad, not bad at all for a so called "loser," or wait, is he an opportunist?  Opportunist, I love that word, is defined as "one who takes advantage of any opportunity to achieve an end, often with no regard for principles or consequences."  Moreover, opportunity, is defined as "a chance for progress or advancement."  Therefore, if we combine the two definitions, then we can define an opportunist as being someone who takes a chance for progress or advancement to achieve an end, often with no regard for principle or consequences."  I'm sure Mr. Huong doesn't mind the consequences of ridicule or embarrassment that he has faced since making his way to the limelight, because what's really funny is the fact that he's probably laughing all the way to the bank.

      Today is a pretty average and mundane day.  These are usually the best days for me, because I "zone out" and start daydreaming.  (Just a little sidenote), it's amazing how when I daydream, it's almost as if I'm not physically present where I am and then it takes an outside distraction to bring me back to where I am.  Some people may think that's weird, but I see it as an awesome way to escape the daily pressures of life, rather than doing something that may be harmful to me or someone else.  Also, what I've found to be the most beneficial is how I've been able to generate ideas, accomplish feats that I didn't know that I could and also, at times, live out my dreams.    However, something that I've learned recently that may end up being a quantum leap for my life is writing down my thoughts or dreams.  Being able to come back to a previous thought and refer back to it at a later time, perhaps after acquiring more knowledge and skill can be a very powerful combination.  That's really my whole point for establishing my blog.  I've come to the conclusion that if no one ever reads my blogs, but me, that's okay, because in doing this I'm benefiting in several ways.  Firstly, I'm establishing a habit in doing something that I enjoy, which is writing.  Secondly, I'm developing content that can be utilized later for something that maybe marketable.  Thirdly, I'm overcoming my apprehension of putting information out there for others.  I guess I've always felt that no one would really be interested in what I have to say anyway.  It's kind of ironic that I think that, because I love giving public speaking engagements and I love songwriting.  I guess I take writing and sharing my knowledge and experience as being something that is very personal or almost even sacred.  But what I've found, is that is what most people like about me.  My ability to express thoughts or experiences in such a way that they themselves feel like they're experiencing or thinking it.  One thing that I strive to do with my life, is to  do whatever I do with my heart and if I'm unable to do that then I quit and move on.

      Woke up this morning about 6:00am, because my wife just started going back to school as of yesterday and she has a 7:30am class.  Man, I can remember those days.  I think the 8:00am classes I had back in the day, I was absent more than I was there (I Hate Mornings).    Anyways, my wife is pregnant with our second child and today was the day that the morning sickness decided to make our day an interesting one.  I followed her to school, because I wanted to make sure she got to class okay.  We arrived at the school and I walked her to her class.  She sat for a moment then we stepped out into the hallway, because she started coughing uncontrollably.  This whole time, I knew she was also feeling nauseous, but I was encouraging her to try to keep her food down.  Well she went to the restroom and came back out, but nothing happened yet.  So we started to walk back to the classroom where she vomited right in front of the doorway.  These dudes who were standing nearby, started laughing and ran off.  If my wife wasn't feeling so sick, I probably would have hauled off and hit one of them.  The point is, the whole experience made me seriously think about  how insensitive we can be at times .  I realized that those guys were young, immature and juvenile college students.  But what concerns me, is if I wasn't there, would someone have helped my wife or not? (Sometimes our own insecurities prevent us from making significant impact on this world or just in our sphere of influence).  However, the real lesson that I learned came from my wife.  After the incident, I said "Baby, lets just go home and you can get some rest."  But, she said no  I got to do this , I got to go to class.  She wasn't embarrassed, ashamed or nothing.  Rather she was focused, determined and dedicated.  As I drove back home, I thought to myself, I wonder if those knucklehead boys or the others who just looked and passed on by would have half the courage and grit that my wife had.  When I spoke to her later on this morning, I told her that I admired her and I also knew that she would be successful this semester.   Bottomline , so many people are out there " keeping up appearances ," becoming so consumed about what others say or think about them that they miss out on considering what matters most.  That is  what do you think and say about yourself .  As far as my wife is concerned, she told herself no matter what I'm confronted with, I'm going back to school and I will succeed.

       urlLink Herald.com | 07/26/2004 | NFL star Williams heeds heart, not wishes of crowd   Yeah for Ricky Williams.  You've now left the rat race and entered onto the fasttrack.  I've listened and read about this story all day.  People are criticizing him and everything else.  But I applaud him for realizing that in his case, football was a mean to an end, rather than an end in itself.  I really think it's wrong for people to judge him the way they have.  He's just like the rest of us, only with celebrity status.  He got tired of his job and realized it was time for him to move on.  There are those that say, but he's only played for 5 years.  Well I retired for the first time after only working for 5 years too.  At that point in my life I realized I had been living my life to satisfy everyone else, but myself.  Unfortunately, after a year and a half, I had to go back to work, because my finances were running low.  However, none of my friends didn't have 1.5 year vacation like I did.  They were still grinding away at jobs they didn't neccessarily enjoy.  So I don't blame the guy for retiring.  I wish him well.  To be honest with you, people really don't learn to live until they start living according to their own desires.  Good luck Ricky, and one day I hope I to rejoin you and thousands of others, who've decided they've had enough and took an early...
