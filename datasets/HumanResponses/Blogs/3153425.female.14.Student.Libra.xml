      Ok.. You may have noticed that I lost my blog for a bit there. Well the HTML code got all fucked so I just picked a new layout and woopdedoo here it is again. Not much has been happening, really..Just trying to cope with my daily life of SCHOOL. Last week I didn't attend school as I was sick.. Gee, I love tonsilitis. Makes the tummy rumble. I'll just go through a whole bunch of gossip for you... Only thing I can think of doing.  Well, Tom Noonan and a chick called 'Charlotte' got caught in the change rooms at production going at it like rabbits.. Bad luck for Tommy Boy, his mum runs the production. :)    Apparently all the grades at school are getting shifted so it's mixed year classes. E.G: Year 9 and 10 in one class. Utterly Retarded.   Mr Toogood (Yes, that's his name..) wears G-Strings.   Delveck (Matt Delveck of year 11) is a total hotty and Kobi and I are obsessed. Today we found out that he's going out with a chick with huge boobs. Surprise, Surprise.   Steph Bryson slept with 6 guys on the weekend. (Highly Likely)   Rusty thinks I'm a fat bitch. (Highly Likely)  Well, I don't know what else to write. I'm really quite boring.    urlLink GO PIES! Love you boys. ;)  Remember, you're unique.  Just like everyone else.  Steph.

      Hmm. What to say. Or more so, how to say it..  I'm going out with John again. There. I said it. You can all say "Wow, Stef, You're a dickhead." Go for it. I don't think I've wanted anything more than this. Yettagain I sound like a whore. I don't speak my emotions too well, I guess.  Anyways. I had a thought today. When we were kids, we thought our parents were the most innocent people in the world and we wanted to be like them. Or something like that anyway.. And then as you grow older you can see more of the corruption.  I truly wish my father would go away. I don't think I've ever felt so bad about it, but it's true, and there's no lieing about it. You don't say things like that if you don't mean them. Anyway, the wind blows.. Stef.

Get my braces off soon.. :S I guess I'll post when I have something good to say. Steph.

      I've been helping out Alex with her production music and I've got the shoop shoop song in my head. It's driving me INSANE. So, who missed me?! Oh yeah, My tag board is shitted up. So if you wanna comment.. I dunno. Do whatever. Do and irish jiG! As you can tell I'm in a happy mood. I dunno why, I just am. Weird, hey? Yes, I'm still infatuated with rusty.. 2 rusty's, actually. I guess I'll go into the second when I'm feeling brave enough. 'There is much pain'. If he/you're reading this, TALK TO ME!! I MISS YOU!! :( Anyways.. I'm not sure what else to write. Not interesting when I'm happy, eh? Oh yeah.. The new name and background are shittouse but oh well. Better than nothing.  Big brother is watching.  Steph.

      Been surfing around a bit.. Love  urlLink This  site. Very cool.  Not alot happened today. Just cruised around quietly. We went to the Casey Indoor Sports centre today.. had a choice of indoor soccer or beach volleyball. Being sports retarded I choice beach volleyball with my mates. It was actually quite fun until Jess O'leary pegged a ball at my head and was acting like a total bitch to me all day. Fuck YOU! Weird thing happened today. Everyone was provoking Rory to ask me out, and he did. Then everyone else told me to say no so I just acted it out. I think he actually meant it. I think I sound like a whore in this blog.. I'm not. I've had 1 boyfriend in my whole life, I like 2 guys and the rest is jabber.. So, no, I am not a whore. Coming to this blog is a few changes.. Gunna HTML it up a bit. Will probably change the stupid name too. :D I'm also going back to my roots and starting painting and drawing again. I don't know what happened, but I've totally lost it. Gunna start writing more too. :) Shizenhousen. Steph.

      It's been a looong.. Loong.. Looooong.. Day.. Not to say it hasn't been a loong.. loong.. looo0ooong 2 weeks.. Today. Today, today, today.. Oh lord how can I explain today. It was worse than a bad day. It was a horrifically-bad-messed-up-shitty-asswipe-day. Forgot my damn lunch.. Failed a cooking prac.. My assignment disc fucked up, got into trouble for it being late.. Got a detention FOR A FUCKING IRRELEVANT REASON!, and Mrs Walton waffled on for 2 hours about how laddida-fuckin' great she is. FUCK IT ALL! On a happier note. Went to Clare's house for her birthday. it was greeeaattt being back home.. I was so happy. :) SEE? I CAN BE HAPPY!!! I have graphics tomorrow with Rusty.. Blah blah blah. I wish he'd go away or something or that I didn't like him. It's so STUPID. STUPID STUPID STUPID! FEELINGS ARE STUPID! EMOTIONS ARE STUPID!  Like I said in my last post, I'm not depressed. I'm probably just a raving lunatic struggling for freedom in a community that expects perfection and conforming. HAHAHA. Anyways. Smile if you're not wearing any underwear. Steph.

      hello dear readers of my blog. Long time no see. I guess I've been in such a self-destructive mood lately I haven't had the time to even bother with posting. Probably all the better for you, Dear Readers, as I would have scared the living Buddah out of you. I get a little freaky sometimes. But I've been pondering: What IS the meaning of life? I've asked around and the main answer is 'To love and be loved in return.' But what does it mean to be successful in life? What if you become the most famous person in the world? What then? You just slink away to be forgotton like everyone else in the world. What about those who don't find love? What about them? What about bums that don't get to be succesful?  At this point in time I feel like lying down and quietly dying. I've never been known to want to be noticed at all. I don't like attention.. I mean, everyone likes attention from family and friends but I've never wanted to be noticed by anyone. I just wanna be one of those people that sink in under the radar and live how they like. Sure, I may get teased along the way but screw everyone else. I'm here for me.  I wish I were invisible. Then no-one could see me. That would be wicked. I want to wait up all night for Rusty. I want to see if he comes on at all. I just want to wait forever. It feels like I could cry every time I remember him. I wish I had some port of communication with him. It's so stupid to be infatuated with someone you haven't spoken to for months. It's stupid and it hurts! It SUCKS. Sometimes I wonder if he even remembers me at all. If he has any thoughts of me. Any glimses of me. Even if it were hate, it would be better than nothing. At least he could send me a hate message and I'd know he knew I was alive. God this hurts. It fucking sucks. Anyway.. School has been totally shithouse. I swear my teachers want me to die. I guess I'll leave you with this. I wouldn't want to scar your undented minds.  Live long and prosper. Steph.

      Woohoo.. We're getting broadband tonight! Hooray for phone calls! :) Yay.. My Mum ordered in a Devdas dvd for me and she gave it to me today.. I was so happy. :) She said I deserved it after being so obediant with my school work.  You know what? It's so freezing right now.. I hate winter. It's horrid.  God I don't want to go to school tomorrow.. It's gunna be a total judge fest as it's casual clothes. Maybe I should just go in my uniform? I dunno.. I really dread it. Does anyone else dread it, I wonder..? Man it's cold.. I need a blanket or something.. As you can see this is a very mixed up post.. I'm fairly stuffed from today's doings.. Oh Well.. Life Awaits.. Steph
