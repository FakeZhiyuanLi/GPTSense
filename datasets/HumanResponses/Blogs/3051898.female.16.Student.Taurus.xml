						   Wow I'm up early... look at the time of post if you don't believe me... I woke up not long after 5am, but didn't get out of bed till 5:45. And then I came online, but nobody is online to say bye to. I did cry in bed last night, but I'm feeling okay now. Not super happy again I'm afraid, but I'm alright. Wow, this really will be my last post before I go on holiday.... I'm going to see if I can ask Chris not to be online when his mom goes out at night so that I can call him... maybe I'll be able to finally tell him that saying he loves me and then saying he doesn't is actually really upsetting for me. And maybe he can cheer me up because I'll ask him if he's been thinking about me (which I reckon he will :) ) I bet my parents are glad that I'm awake.... they were going to wake me up at 6:30, but for reasons not even I understand I woke up completely on my own not long after 5am.... Odd. I'm tired but I'm not going to get back to sleep... I guess I'll probably just have an early night tonight.  Nobody's going to read this for a while except maybe Lauren, so Lauren I'm warning you now there's loads of repetitive crap written on some days!! I hope you enjoy finding out how things between me and Chris are seeming different.... we act more like a real couple, even online last night we were asking each other if we'd miss each other and saying how we wish we were together and doing the /skiss thingie on msn and wishing they were real kisses. Actually thinking about this is cheering me up more and more... Also the fact that when we're alone we usually kiss and hug and stuff (in fact we've kissed a little bit with Louise in the room..... but I usually try to resist the temptation when she's around). I guess just because he doesn't love me it doesn't stop that things are great between us and that I reckon he's on his way to loving me (or possibly does but doesn't realise as he doesn't know what love is). Ok, now I know I'm going to be okay, I've reassured myself.  When I come back off holiday I might try to put some holiday photos on here.  Bye for 2 weeks! (unless I find a computer in Spain... *has hope*) ~Hannie xxx  P.S. A message for Lauren: Lauren my parents still don't like the idea of Shell Island... so I don't think I'm coming. I'm really going to miss you over these holidays.... When we're all together we'll have to see loads of each other to make up for it!!! And I won't moan at you too much for wearing revealing clothes! lol. Buy some credit so you can text me, as I will text you. I'm already missing you, I hope you miss me! Bye for now, luv Hannah. xxxxxx

						   I've been thinking.... please can everyone not mention the not loving me thing to Chris? It'll probably only cause problems if anyone does mention it... I would've been fine if he hadn't said he did love me. It was raising my hopes and then dashing them that makes me cry. Louise had actually told him to say he loved me anyway.... but she told him to only say it if it's true. It's really mean of him to say it and not mean it. It's cruel. I hope I stop crying soon, and that I don't cry in front of him tomorrow when we pick Louise up. I suppose he is only 14... he is too young to be in love really.... But I would've been okay. I was happy thinking he didn't love me until he gave me hope. I then went really happy knowing that he loved me, but then, suddenly he says he doesn't know what love is. Which means he doesn't love me. Which means he made the mistake of giving me hope and then taking it away. So now I'm crying.... I suppose it's probably just hormones again. You know what? Maybe I should just put the convo we had up here so you can see for yourself what happened... I will cut out parts that are too irrelevant. It was hours earlier that he was saying he loved me so that's not in the convo below.  "My House, My"&nbsp;is Chris (full version of name is My House, My Rules, My Way) "I may be an"&nbsp;is me&nbsp;(full version of name is I may be an idiot, but at least I'm a happy idiot)  [21:24:20] My House, My: do u think im ur true love  [21:24:46] I may be an : maybe... i dunno if i can be sure at only 16 tho  [21:24:57] I may be an : why, do u think i'm ur true love?  [21:25:11] My House, My: well to be fair i dnt kno wat love is  [21:25:14] I may be an : ah  [21:25:43] My House, My: id like to think u r tho [21:27:01] I may be an : so basically ur sayin u like to think i love you but u dnt kno if u love me cuz u dunno what love is?  [21:27:11] My House, My: yeh  [21:27:33] I may be an : i wish you did know  [21:27:41] My House, My: i try to keep out of emotion at my age  21:28:47] I may be an : so are u saying u dnt want to love me? :S [21:29:05] My House, My: i do wanna love u  [21:29:10] My House, My: just not yet  [21:29:16] My House, My: cus skoll  [21:29:24] My House, My: and house  [21:29:26] I may be an : :( [21:29:38] My House, My: i do wanna love u  [21:29:48] I may be an : you knowloves not meant to just happen when u want it to  [21:30:03] My House, My: i dnt kno wat it is  [21:30:11] My House, My: so i cant relli say  [21:30:28] My House, My: all i kno is that i want to love u  [21:30:33] My House, My: and be wiv u  [21:30:39] My House, My: and tlk to u  [21:30:43] My House, My: kis  [21:30:44] My House, My: u  [21:30:49] My House, My: and hug u  [21:30:56] My House, My: and tlk and kiss and hug  [21:31:23] My House, My: and love u to bits  [21:31:28] I may be an : yeh wen ur in love u just wanna be with the other person and u think abuot them all the time....  [21:31:44] My House, My: how do u kno  [21:31:51] I may be an : cuz i love you   At this point he had to go. I don't think he any idea how upset I am.  Anyway by the time I'm back off holiday hopefully I'll be happy again. This is why it's probably better if nobody says anything to Chris... I guess I'm cheering up a tiny bit... I mean, he says he wants to love me... (but not yet :(:(:(:( ) I don't know, 2 weeks away from him might help me sort out how I feel about things properly. Hopefully. Maybe.  On a different note, Lauren I miss you!! Buy credit for your mobile so you can text me please!!!!!!!!!  Bye for 2 weeks! ~Hannie xxx  P.S. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT NO1 CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS BLOG UNLESS YOU ARE LAUREN OR LOUISE OR ALISON. NEVER TELL ANYONE ELSE OF MY BLOG'S EXISTANCE PLEASE! I ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT CHRIS TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE IF HE FINDS OUT HE'LL WANT TO SEE IT, AND THEN HE'LL KNOW IF I EVER SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM...

						   Chris lied. He doesn't love me. He doesn't know what love is. He says he wants to be with me, he says he wants to hug me, he says he wants to kiss me, he says he wants to talk to me, he says he wants to love me. But he also doesn't want to love me yet because of school and whatever. Love isn't optional. He can't just love me later on when it's convenient for him. Why did he say he loved me earlier if he really he doesn't know? Didn't he realise I would be upset later? He says he likes being with me, he says he always thinks about me. I take those as signs of being in love.... but if you want to be with someone and you think about them a lot does it mean you are in love? I don't think it's fair to say people will know when they are in love, I think that often people don't know... It seems really unfair that I love Chris and he doesn't love me.... and he got my hopes up and everything. :( I don't know how to feel. He still cares about me, he's still going to really miss me when I'm gone.... but I thought he loved me and he doesn't. I wish somebody could explain love to him. I guess my best explaination is when you think about the other person all the time, you always want to be around the other person, they become the person who means the most to you in the whole world... also other people interest you less. Plenty of people have crushes on loads of people, but I think a sign of being in love with a person is when your feelings for other people become weaker, and your feelings for the one you love become stronger (although I guess this isn't always the case...). You're in love when a simple kiss can make you feel happy, but if they aren't interested you become miserable. When you're in love the other person's happiness is more important than your own, and you would do just about anything to stop them being sad. Also if you can see yourself having a future with the person and being happy, that's another sign. Anyone who reads this, please comment on how you think being in love feels like. Maybe Chris does love me and just doesn't realise... he did say he doesn't know what love is, so how could he know if he loves me or not? If you think he does love me, feel free to try to convince him. I just have one very important rule. NEVER LET HIM FIND OUT ABOUT THIS BLOG.  Bye for now! (or probably for 2 weeks) ~Hannie xxx

						   Today I was really really really happy, but then I felt pretty sad. Then Chris came online and told me he loves me so I'm happy again! He loves me! He loves me! He loves me! He loves me! He loves me! He loves me!  Can you tell I'm happy? Heehee. He's great, he can cheer me up so easily. :D  Life is good again!  That's all I wanna write right now  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   Life is good, life is great. I'm in a happy mood at the moment. My family is great (well, sometimes :P), my friends are great (I would prefer they were happier), Chris is great, I'm great.  urlLink Click here for a webpage that annoys Alison!  I find it funny though...  Alisons happy today which is nice, Louise is in quite a good mood (or at least was earlier), Chris is happy because he's&nbsp;thinking about the house he's going to buy in the future (would be good if he really did have this house), I'm in a good mood because Chris makes me happy. Lol.  Tomorrow's my last day before I go on holiday... Which means I won't see Lauren for ages (I leave here on Saturday, she comes back here Sunday) and that I won't see Laura for ages and I wont see Alison for ages and I wont see Chris for ages. Would be nice to get a goodbye kiss off him but I don't think it's possible. Louise had a plan to get her mom out of the room but I don't think it will work out so perhaps we shouldn't bother. Firstly theres a good chance my dad will come with me into the house (if I say he can stay he'll prob be like, 'no i dont mind coming' argh), and secondly Louise probably won't get her mom out of the room for long (and Louise is gonna hate readin this, but I'd really prefer a goodbye snog....). Also even if the other stuff works out then Louise would be in the room with me and Chris. So I'd feel a bit weird kissing him with her there, and also she'd probably be upset for the rest of the day. Overall, (that word reminds me of history essays...argh) its probably not worth attempting. Pity really.  Well even without a goodbye kiss I'll probably be in a good mood, so I that means I don't need one! Wooo holiday in Spain! It'll be great, swimming everyday, Universal Medditerannia often, nearby neach, visiting Barcelona. Plus I'll be with 2 great friends, Louise and Stephen. It'll be great!!! So why aren't I actually that excited inside? :S Ah well. I'll enjoy it when I'm there.  Bye for now! (Tomorrow will probs be my last entry before holiday) ~Hannie xxx

						   Stopped the night at Louise's last night and I spent most of today there. Things are going absolutely great between me and Chris. I don't think things have ever been so good! I'm dreading the fact we'll probably have an argument to ruin it all sometime soon... I guess I'll just have to try really hard not to get upset by him doing something stupid and also to not start an argument. If I sense an argument coming I must back down immediately!!!  I could tell you the gory details of the time spent with Chris, LOL. Though already the details are slipping from my mind... Also I don't think anyone really wants to know. Actually Louise tends to want to know to reassure herself... hmm. Well she shouldn't get so upset because everything is bound to collapse soon. :(   Its a shame Louise was getting upset today... In fact her crying interrupted Chris' attempt at making me horny (he was horny so he wanted me to be, but I just sorta wasn't... I basically just wanted be cuddled and kissed...)  I think Louise is a little happier now (dunno if she will be after reading my blog) but I felt sorta guilty that I was spending so much time with Chris (but I loved every minute with him!). Unfortunately I was annoyed that me and Chris had to stop... I felt like I was being a really horrible person, but I really did just want to stay with Chris and keep kissing and stuff. I wanted Louise to be happy, though. She was so upset I did recognise that cheering her up was important.... Even if it did make me feel sorta frustrated to have to jump off Chris to go look after her.   I liked the discussion we had about marriage... Me and Chris actually discussed the idea of getting married! LOL!! Nah don't worry I don't mean we decided we were going to get married or anything like that...  If we are both still together and happy in the years to come then marriage is entirely possible. He even pointed out that technically we could get married in two years time! I did mention that we would be too young then, but then later on he mention the fact that we could in 2 years time again.... Perhaps he's hinting he would like to marry me? LOL, I realise that he was just mentioning it cuz that's sorta scary. It scared me anyway.  He seemed to want to discuss the future a lot. It seems his life plan includes moving to America (something I've wanted to do for years), living in a big house so friends can visit (a great idea!), owning 2 dogs or possibly a dog and cat (he said 2 dogs but then he knew I wanted a cat so said a dog and a cat so now I don't know what the plan is), being really rich (this has always been a life goal for me actually), and having kids (I've always wanted kids until more recently when I've thought it would hurt and it would make me feel old). In fact he wants a boy and a girl, so 2 kids. Sounds reasonable to me. Actually when we were discussing it later on (when Louise wasn't in the room) he even asked me what I'd name my kids! I'm beginning to think he would like us to have children together.... (don't worry Louise, we won't get this far... I bet we'll have that terrible argument that breaks us up for good any day now :( )   I should be happy. I'm not smiling though. I think I feel guilty cuz of Lou. I think I feel sad that Louise and Alison are sad. And at the back of my mind I'm concerned for Rachel. And I miss Lauren (I hope she's having as much fun in France as I am here when I'm with Chris :D).  Apart from those things, I'd say my life is great at the moment. Things have never been better with Chris, and I'm not arguing with my family (having a tidy bedroom helps). I really wish my friends could all be happy. Although it certainly seems like I'm very preoccupied with Chris, I do care a lot about them.... They're all really important people to me. Please can you guys just give me a hint how to make you happy? (hopefully without stopping me and Chris enjoying ourselves)   I feel I've written enough to keep Louise depressed for a while. She really shouldn't read my blog, it's bad for her health. With any luck she'll concentrate on me saying how I want her to be happy and how I care about her as&nbsp;I do all my friends.   Btw, you probs guessed but my mission to stop talking about Chris has been failing really badly. Perhaps I'll succeed more on holiday (I leave Saturday for 2 weeks, so&nbsp;no blog updates for ages). I'll let you know how it goes (if I remember).   Bye for now!  ~Hannie  xxx

						   I think I'll start by saying I am very happy with Chris lately. He has been noticably nice to me and I have to say I'm very pleased with the result. I do sorta miss Lauren... I hope she's having a good time in France. I said some mean things last time about being glad she's gone... and I do regret that. Although admittedly since she's gone I have had better moments with Chris.... hmm. I can't remember if I mentioned that we were having a garden party for relatives... it was last sunday. I was worried I'd be stuck looking after all the kids but I wasn't in the end, plus my room is still amazingly tidy! Oh yeah, I almost forgot about my wasp sting ordeal, I have to write about that. This happened Saturday, so the day before the garden party. I woke up at 10:30am, which is strange because I normally would wake up at least an hour later, and also because I had fallen asleep much later than usual. But the reason I woke up was because I got stung. A wasp seemed to have stuunng me while I was peacefully sleeping (I didn't actually see the wasp, but I heard buzzing so I'm guessing). I would've just stayed in bed as I would usually every morning when I wake up - but it hurt more than I expected. So I got up and called my mom and ran downstairs, but I started feeling really dizzy. I collapsed onto the floor and was carried into the living room where my parents layed me down on the sofa. I finger really stung and I went really pale (except for the finger that got stung - that went bright red) as I had almost fainted (my hearing went weird and everything). I stopped feeling dizzy but then had REALLY bad stomach pains. I felt sick... and then I was sick... quite a bit actually. After this I got better with just a painful finger. Sunday night I stopped at Louise's house. I had a great time with Chris as we got some time alone... I won't go into to details abut what happened though. In fact tonight I'm going to stop over again. I can't be bothered to type cuz I wanna day dream about Chris just to annoy Louise, heehee. &nbsp; Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   Today I went to the cinema to see Spiderman 2 with Louise, Lauren, Rachel, Alison and Chris. It was nice that we could all go together. Unfortunately Louise and Alison got all upset... Anyway, the film was quite good. I sat by Chris and he held my hand through the WHOLE film. My hand felt sorta numb by the end though because of this... I hadn't wanted to let go as he doesn't often hold my hand, so it was nice. After this Rachel went home and the rest of us went to McDonalds, where we could see Alison and Louise were still sad... we decided to all come back to my house. On the bus Chris told me he wouldn't come to the cinema with us again becuase people were just being sad (Louise and Alison)... which I was dissapointed about. I like going to the cinema with him... At my house Louise and Alison were still sad. Chris kept trying to get Laura to come over, and Lauren spent a lot of time with us. Louise and Alison sat in my room on their own crying together... then the rest of us went upstairs, too. Chris kept messing with my webcam...(which reminds me, I need to delete lots of bad pics of me). I kept trying to get Chris to hug me... but I got the impression he didn't  really  want to. Louise felt miserable... she felt like Chris was stealing her friends away. I feel that there wasn't anything wrong with me spending time with him as I spend way more time with her and I'm his girlfriend. Lauren, however, doesn't have an excuse. I think Louise and Lauren should talk about this... Actually that's a good point. Why is Lauren spending so much time with me and Chris? I guess nobody could really tell that I actually wanted to be alone with him, to see if he was more likely to do stuff this way.... But again, she's supposed to spend more time with her friend than her friend's brother! I realise people could say the same to me, but I still have a perfectly good reason to be spending time with him, and it's unfair for people to get upset because of it. So how do I feel right now? I would've expected me to be happy... but by now I feel sortof down. Perhaps it's because everyone was embarassing me about my unnderwear that was all over my bedroom floor, or perhaps it was the insulting picture Chris drew of me (which he hadn't actually intended to be insulting....). On the one hand it does seem like Chris was being nice and was making the effort I wanted to treat me nicer than everyone else, but at the same time I do feel sad. I think it might be because I was hoping for more intimacy... but I spose what can I expect from a 14 yr old? Also when I'm in this sort of mood I don't think there's any pleasing me. I think I'm sorta bummed he didn't kiss me when he had the opportunity... I mean we had moments when we were alone and I was wishing he would take advantage, but he never does. Actually at one point when we were in front of the computer in my room he seemed to be motioning that he wanted a kiss... which I just didn't want to give. It seemed unfair because Louise was right there in the room... but I wonder if it would have changed things if I had gone for it? Either way he has plenty of way better moments to ask, so that makes him just silly. I just hope he doesn't get the wrong impression and think I'm becoming uninterested in kissing... I wish Louise didn't get so upset... if she feels as though she's losing us why doesn't she talk to us more and steal us back? Or maybe she should convince Lauren to stay with her as Lauren has no reason to spend time with MY boyfriend. (Heh, I guess the amount of time Lauren and Chris are together annoys me...) Oh yeah, today I got told I smell. Apparently it's just a Hannah smell,&nbsp;and not a bad smell.... but I think everyone was just being too kind to say that I stink. Apparently sometimes after I leave Louise's house Chris can still smell me. Wow. I must reek. Actually thinking about it this way it's no wonder I never get the attention from him that I want, as he would probably rather avoid the smell. I guess this is yet another thing making me sad. &nbsp; Well I'm getting repetitive as usual so I'm gonna stop typing and hope Louise doesn't get too upset whe she reads this. As usual this&nbsp;blog is not intended to be nice about other peoples feelings, it is intended for me to be honest and frank about mine. This is a blog for me, not for my friends. If they read it and get upset, it's their own fault and they should learn that maybe reading this blog isn't the best idea. I guess I did sorta want it to be personal anyway as I knew all along I would say things that people wouldn't want to hear... &nbsp; Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   The best word to decribe today is dissapointing. It was just full of dissapointments. First I'm trying to work out how to travel to Alton Towers, but I'm just not finding anything that does exactly what I need it to. Considering the rest of my day this was the least of my worries... Louise invited me and Lauren over, so I went and got dressed, made sure I looked decent, and then her mom comes home and tells her that actually we can't come over. So obviously I was quite dissapointed to lose an opportunity to see Chris. Right after this she asked again about going to Alton Towers tomorrow, and her mom said no. A little while after this, me and Lauren decided to go to Bearwood so I could buy Rachel a card (I already have her present) and so she could buy Rachel a present (she already has her card) as today is Rachels birthday (no she hasn't invited us to do anything... I don't think she wants to see us :(. As usual there was limited choice of cards saying 16... I thought it would be nice to get her one with people holding footballs. A boys card, but surely Rachel would be happy with this as she loves football.  While we were shopping Lauren told me how she didn't have enough money to go to Alton Towers, so I said I could lend it her, but she said she didn't want to owe me money. And then she told me how that morning her mom told her not to make plans for tomorrow as she wanted to go shopping with Lauren. Lauren hadn't even told her mom we might be going to Alton Towers!! ARGH! When we finished shopping we realised if we were quick we might see Chris after school, but then we saw the bus just slightly ahead of us... and then it zoomed off to the bus stop where Chris would've got on... so I didn't even see him in the distance, but missed him by about 2 minutes. Aftfer this I figured it might be nice to surprise Alison by meeting her after school, so I waited outside the school gates (on my own, Lauren had to go pick up her little brother from school). I was waiting half an hour and she still didn't show up, so I left. I later found out that she went to her friends house. ARGH. I went home expecting Chris to be online, he wasn't. :( He did come on a bit later though. He was being nicer than usual, so I was actually quite happy talking to him. Until Laura came online. He and Laura were talking for ages. They didn't tell me what they were talking about, but they were both too busy talking to each other to really say anything to me. It was really upsetting. I felt really left out. They only know each other because of me!!! Admittedly Laura did give me a chance today to say I didn't want her to talk to Chris... I didn't tell her that I didn't want her to though, because I know it makes me look bad. I really don't like them talking... especially on days like today when they ignore me to talk to each other more. Laura then went on to block Chris... this resulted in him talking to me again. He was all annoyed and upset, though... it seems Laura ruined his previous good mood (at this point I was thinking how this proves talking to her is bad for him). I'm worried because Laura was quite mean to him and it might have been because of me. I really really hope it wasn't, but it might have been. So at this point I could now be dissapointed that Laura made Chris in a bad mood, and dissapointed in myself in case it was my fault. And then I was dissapointed cuz Chris neva sed bye to me (when he dusn't it always gets on my nerves). Then I was dissapointed because Lauren went offline... and then finally because I found out that none of Louise's family like Spiderman... so Chris probably wouldn't want to see Spiderman 2 with me :( I've now asked Louise to see if she can come to Shell Island (there's a chance I can go, but I better not mention it to my parents today cuz the answer will dissapoint me more). I also asked if I can come over tomorrow. If I get answers to either of these requests tonight, I think I know what they'll be. Well I'm not talking to Louise much... sorta naughty of me in fact. I guess I'm not in a talkative mood. I'm feeling sad. I'm usure if it's hormones or just the dissapointment. Either way I'm not a happy bunny. Oh yeh, Louise is making her own blog so I'll have to look at that soon. Hopefully that's something to look forward to.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   I made a group blog for me and my friends to all post in, but for some reason the invitation emails weren't sending. Now I've sorted it all out, but only Louise has joined so far. I'm sure Laurenwill when she comes online, and I can probs convince Alison (who may not come online again tonight), but I have my doubts abuot Rachel. I want her to join but I don't think she'll want to. Anyway, if you want to see our group blog  urlLink click here . I don't really have anything particularly interesting to say today. I think I am improving on the Chris thing, but I have slipped up several times today but Lauren was here to point it out. It may be annoying, but she's helping me! It's for my own good! So thanks Lauren :D  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   I changed the layout... I did want a pink layout but Lauren changed hers to the one I was gonna have so I decided I wanted a different one (it's boring to have the same!). I chose this one because the archive thingie is on the left, on most templates it's on the right. Also it has pretty writing where it says Archives and Recent Posts. Actually I think I just have it cuz I reckon it looks sorta odd, so it's like me ha ha. Perhaps it will make my blog that little bit more interesting. Or not. Whatever.  Bye for now ~Hannie xxx

						   Why is it that so many people out there actually have interesting blogs? They also communicate their emotions better than the rambled garbage I come out with. It's actually quite depressing, lol. I was talking to Lauren about the possibility of me going to shell island with her, but now Lauren is all quiet and ignoring me (probably not at the the computer) and so I'm bored. I've just realised that I haven't put my quiz on here!! I have made a quiz to find out who you are most like out of me, Lauren, Louise, Rachel and Alison. Most people are Lauren, which is probably because Lauren is more normal than I am. Anyway, my quiz includes pictures of us! Yay! If you wanna take it  urlLink click here . Lauren's back now so I won't write more.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   Today I woke up in a much better mood (I had managed to fall asleep not thinking haunting thoughts). I wasn't super happy or anything, but not miserable. Also I asked Louise about yesterday and she helped reassure me a bit, so now I'm not worrying abuot him and Lauren. I really was just crazy and full of hormones. The worst thing abuot me today is that I seem to be a bit irritable. Today's been boring... I guess this post is just to clear up a few things. I'm talking to Laura on msn now, I feel like I can't talk to her as much as I used to, but we are still talking sort of acting as close as we were. I hope we both get over this soon so I can go back to telling her every detail of my love life, lol! I was kidding, I need to stop remember. So no more mentioning Chris unless others bring him up. I am also allowed if I'm talkng about something else and I have to mention him, but then I do NOT get into a lengthy discussion about him. I can do this. Maybe. I might post later...  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   I know what it is. The whole damn problem is those bloody hormones. Surely they're whats making me feel so depressed when I was happy not so long ago. I mean, a few minutes ago I was crying, wtf is wrong with me? I still feel upset... but I think I realise that the cause is most likely hormones. Chris and Lauren at party in the park were simply triggers (I know when Lauren reads this she'll point out she didn't do anything, which is true. I'm just putting it this way because it's sooo much simpler for me to explain). So I'm going to sit here feeling sory for myself, everyone can just ignore me because it's probably my own stupid paranoid hormonal fault I'm like this. Bye again ~Hannie xxx

						   Well since last time Laura has got mad at me for telling Chris about her wanting me to dump him... she said he was mad at her, but I asked him and he said he didn't get mad. Laura reckons I told him because I'm jealous of her, and she convinced Chris of that (I have now told him otherwise, I hope he believes my side of the story). Laura has calmed down since I think, but she still seems sorta mad. She gives me the impression that she does like him quite a bit. I'll admit I would be a LOT happier if they stopped being in contact with each other, but that won't happen unless they get bored of each other... which could take forever to happen (but is much more likely to happen if they don't see each other in person). By the way, my atemp to stop talking about Chris has failed. I now find myself hoping someone else will bring him up so I can talk about him, or else I just bring him up anyway. I think I have improved very slightly, as everyone else was talking about him. No noticable changes, though... I'll keep trying. Today it was brmb's party in the park. Lots of music artists were at cannon hill park basically. I went with Lauren, Louise, Chris and Louise's mom. It rained. A lot. Some of the music was good, though. I liked Mark Owen and Sugababes... Nelly Furtado and McFly were quite good, too. I'm convinced that it was Ronan Keating who made it rain cuz he sucks (Mark Owen made it stop cuz he's great). Actually I also liked Sam and Mark... Now the part you know I want to talk about where I mention Chris. A lot of the time he was talking to Lauren,  which I did my best to ignore... he also hugged her (twice!) and not me (if he can get away with hugging her why can't he get away with hugging me??). He did carry me lots so that I could see the stage better cuz I'm so short...that was sweet of him. Except he also picked up Lauren, and she could see anyway. At the time I was fine with this, but later after discussing it I now feel pretty shit. Also after reading Lauren's blog she mentions him quite a bit, why does she feel she needs to say so much about him? She didn't even mention the music! Doesn't she realise it only makes me think about it more and more and feel worse? I'm not angry or anything like that... I just feel sad. Lauren thought I was fine with everything, but I was actually trying to make excuses to reassure myself and also I was hoping she would change subject... okay so I sortof do want to talk about it, but only if it's going to make me feel happy, which it doesn't. Actually, I was pretty happy with today until I thought about everything he did with Lauren. Why did he hug her? If he's not allowed to hug me in front of his mom why would he be allowed to hug her? Also why did he pick up Lauren? I mean before I thought about it and discussed it I was a bit unhappy, but I tried not to overthink it... because he had just been saying I was heavy and I said Lauren was heavier it was like he was testing this out to find out how much heavier and how long he could carry her for, which made sense at the time. Lauren told me he kept asking if she could see though and that she thinks this could mean he wanted to carry her. I hadn't thought of that. I assumed he was asking because I couldn't see and he was just sorta wondering if she could see or not. See in most situations I would assume I'm right, but what she says makes sense and so concernes me. There's no reasonable explaination for the hugs. Lauren says they were just messing aroud hugs, but still the point remains that she got 2 hugs without really wanting them and I asked for a hug and I got none. I can understand why I got none, but I can't understand why she got 2. Ok I should stop now. It's not fair, I'm going to think about this more and more and then while I try to get to sleep it'll be worse (it always is - i think too much in bed) and so I won't be able to get to sleep and make myself depressed and tomorrow I'll probably be moody. Guess I'm not gonna stop afterall. In fact I could go on abuot this all day. Maybe it'll get it out of my system, though I doubt it. Thinking about it Chris wasn't that nice to me today actually. He made fun of the way I eat, the way I drink and my height. He talked to Lauren more than me, hugged her and not me, and picked her up for no apparent reason. Ok, really I've probably said enough now... I've probably pissed Lauren off by writing this stuff (I don't mean to...it's just the way I feel). I'm gonna end by pointing out to Lauren that no, she does not act like she dislikes Chris AT ALL! So therefore yes, you could act like you dislike him more because you actually act like you like him. You act closer than to him than I do for goodness sake... I realise me saying this will make you angry... I dunno it just does annoy me sometimes when you claim you don't like him but when you're around him you NEVER act like it. Perhaps really you do like him but don't want to admit it for fear of me becoming paranoid (as I do get VERY paranoid as I'm sure you can tell from today). If that's the case too late. Ok, I'm not saying I think he fancies you or you fancy him... just it wouldn't surprise me.  I doubt you have a reasonable explaination to calm my nerves, so I'm left panicking and assuming and worrying. It's horrible. It's times like this I really hate being me.  Lauren, I'm sorry I posted this. I've said things that will annoy you, no doubt. I suppose I created this blog for my feelings, I didn't create it for you to get offended or annoyed by, so please try not to be. I've probably exaggerated it on here anyway. I'm just gonna go and be miserable somewhere and hope that I find something else to think about while I'm trying to sleep (I CAN'T clear my mind - just doesn't work - being stuck in my head is like HELL at times... count yourself lucky you don't have my thoughts).  Bye for now ~Hannie xxx  P.S. I'm also sorry for being overly repetitive and probably not making what my point is clear. In fact it would probably be best to ignore the post completely.

						   Today I just feel frustrated. I'm not entirely sure why... I think it's something to do with Chris. Today I explained to him how he upses me... well sortof. There's more that I didn't want to add. I don't feel like I've accomplished anything, though. Nothings changed. I think I'm also frustrated with myself because he explained that he does like me even if he doesn't always act like it. I'm annoyed that I seem to be moaning at him whenever I talk to him, which I don't want to do because it will annoy him. I also told him how Laura wants us to break up, and he said it was my own fault for discussing my love life! He missed the point completely... the point was that Laura isn't such a great friend to him as he seems to think and also that if she thinks we should break up he isn't treating me right.  Something else I've decided, I'm going to try to stop talking about Chris. I'll still write about him here... but when tlking to people I'll try to only talk about him when other people bring up his name.  Actually talking about Chris yesterday he told me about how he wasn't happy with life... I could give details but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone (except I was allowed to tell Laura) and Lauren might read this. I feel sorry for him, but I'm still dissapointed that he never seems to consider my feelings... I care about him so much and it often seems like he doesn't care about me at all.  Anyway, moving on, today Laura told me that she's going to go out with her friend Matt! I wish them the best of luck in their relationship... I want Laura to be happy. I know she can annoy me at times, but Laura is pretty safe to me really so she deserves happiness.  Yesterday Alison told me she was really upset... it seems her sister has been cutting her wrists because she's depressed and can't decide who she likes best out of a college friend and long term boyfriend Will. She's been arguing with him a lot lately, and I guess I finally know why. I like Rachael (Alison's sister)... so I hope things become better for her. I hope Alison cheers up, too...  (I would like to say sorry to Alison because I said I wouldn't tell anyone and Lauren will probably read this, but I'm sure Lauren won't tell anyone else and technically I haven't told her, Lauren read it...)  Lisa (can't remember if I told you, she's my sister) is ill today, poor girl. It's only a cold, or hayfever or something, so she'll be fine. I guess I'm just showing that I do care about her even if I do think she can be a right bitch at times.  My mom's losing her hearing in one ear, it's funny to laugh at her and say it's old age, but my mom is worrying it's not old age and that it's some other serious problem, so I've decided to stop laughing at her. It was mean of me to laugh anyway...  Well this is all I'm gonna write (though it's still plenty :P). I want to load on the Sims (which Lauren has kindly let me borrow :D)  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   Do you ever feel like the world is picking on you? I'm sure most people know the feeling of when everything seems to be going wrong and it seems like everyone just wants to make your life that little bit worse. Okay so things aren't THAT serious. But today felt pretty crap. I have a boyfriend who doesn't trust me and thinks I lie all the time (I'm actually very against lying) and it feels like my friends are turning against me. I could explain everything about me and my boyfriend (as I mentioned in my last post, called Chris) but I'll probably ramble on about him enough in other posts. One thing that's really been bothering me lately is Stephen... I miss him. No he hasn't gone anywhere. He lives just down the road from me, yet I haven't seen him in quite a while. He's coming online less and less often and when he does he doesn't really talk to me. He spends more time with my next-door neighbour (Laura, we're both friends with her) and I just feel left out... It also annoys me that the few times Stephen does come here he wants to call for Laura. I know that the reason he spends so much time with Laura is because she plays football with him... and football doesn't interest me. Even so, I can't help but feel rejected that he calls her and makes plans and he never calls me anymore. I end up seeing them outside togther... and he never wants to call for me. It's upsetting, me and Ste used to be really gud mates, but I've never felt so distant to him as I do now.  Similarly, Laura is talking to me a bit less (on msn). In fact she's talking to Chris more. She tells me to dump Chris, even though they are friends (only because of me...) and even though if I did she would still talk to him on msn. She wants me to dump him because he can be really mean to me considering he's supposed to be nice as I'm his girlfriend! Depressingly enough he's probably nicer to Laura than me... Something that annoys me about Laura is the way she thinks she's right all the time. Actually that's similar to Chris. They both reckon they're always right. They don't even properly admit they're wrong when I have presented them with evidence that proves them wrong... it's so irritating.  Another person who keeps telling me to dump Chris is Lauren. Don't get me wrong, Laurens a lovely friend... I was annoyed yesterday when she signed in on msn as me though! She really shouldn't be doing that. I could've got really mad but I didn't. I changed my password anyway so she won't be doing that again. Today Lauren got all upset and started crying... all starting from me observing Alison was wearing a short miniskirt so I said it was a bit slutty... Lauren defended her saying it wasn't (Lauren often wears short skirts and revealing tops herself - yes we say she dresses sluttily). Anyway, we ended up not talking for a while... I felt as though they were both picking on me moaning at me, as I hadn't meant to offend anyone, I did mean it jokily. It was playing on the sims that really brought things back to normal, I'm glad me and Lauren are getting on okay. Though it was her who said sorry to me, and now I feel it's my turn to say sorry. I should've said this at the time, but I didn't... I guess I didn't want to admit this in person. I'll say it now because I think Lauren will read this.  Lauren, I'm really sorry for the way I say you dress like a slut. Of course you aren't a slut, I know you're not like that. When it comes to boys you're a good girl (usually :P)! So why do I say it then? As I explained at the time, sluts would also wear revealing clothes... but there's a bit more to it than that. I could say something like I'm concerned guys will get the wrong idea and something bad will happen, but the chances of that are slim. So I'll tell you a more real reason... I'm jealous. You have great legs, a nice stomach (no matter what you say you are NOT fat!), and a generally great body. The truth is that I know that if I wore the clothes you wear I wouldn't be able to look anywhere near as good! I don't even have such clothes to wear, so I can't even try to compete anyway. I'm really sorry. When I do say you're slutty I really don't mean to upset you... If it really does upset you that much I'll stop... it's just when you're dressed like that I feel like I must look terrible next to you. Please forgive me?  Moving on... I'll talk about Alison, who was taking offence at my comment today... I was sure she knew I was joking. Either way she said sorry so I'll also say sorry. I don't know if Alison will read this because it's so long, but if she does then i want to say this to her... Sorry Alison I didn't mean to make you feel upset. I really did mean it in a jokey way.  And now Louise, she's been great lately. Sometimes she gets on my nerves when I'm in a bad mood, but I know she doesn't mean too. Louise, if you read this then I want to say to you that I'm sorry I get so mad over stupid things, please don't get upset when I'm like this as I just need a bit of time to let off steam.  I now realise I've mentioned a lot of people... and I guess I've also realised that the world isn't picking on me. As usual it's just a few things upsetting me and I'm blowing it all out of proportion and taking it out on everyone else. Well I need to finish this post soon, so I'll finish by mentioning Rachel. With everything thats been going on, I still feel most sorry for Rachel. She might not always be nice, but you can still have fuun with her. I know she spends a lot of time feeling upset as she thinks many things are her fault that aren't... I realise me and Rachel have had a good share of arguments, but I really do wish her all the happiness in the world. It's not fair that she should be so upset all the time and I wish I could help her. Whenever I talk to her I always feel so helpless because there's nothing I can do to cheer her up. I don't think Rachel will read this... but if she does hopefully she'll feel just a little bit happier to know I really do care about her.  That's all for tonight then. I didn't mention my family (who were being nice today until my sister, Lisa, discovered I accidentally cut my leg while shaving and I was using her razor...) but perhaps next time.  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx

						   Well now I'm annoyed. I'd spent ages writing the perfect first post and I lost it all. I might try to type it out again... maybe. For now I'll just say hello my name is Hannah and this is my blog. I'll probably talk about Chris (my boyfriend), Louise, Lauren, Alison, Rachel, Laura and Stephen (all close friends, all amazing people) in future entries. I would write more but I'm annoyed because I lost my entire entry (it was so long!).  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
