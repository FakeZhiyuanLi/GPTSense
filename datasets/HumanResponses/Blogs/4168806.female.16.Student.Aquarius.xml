      titles are hard for me, so i usually go with whatever verse of whatever song that i'm currently singing.  anyway, hil and annie came over last night. it was really fun. man. but mia's coming over tonight. i'm excited. the only bad thing that's happened is that i lost my pay check, and i think i already signed it. :o it was almost 130.00  so yeah  it's probably in my incredibly messy room...or incredibly messy house...that i should probably clean before my mom sees it. oi oi oi  i forgot to feed my dogs this morning because i woke up 20 till i had to be at work...man....so i felt bad and fed them double and some hamburger buns. i think i'm getting chinese from buck-a-scoop tnight. i'm excited.  i'm so tired and brain today it's not even funny.  corporates came into quiznos today. that was scary. my manager got back from picking up her daughter who was supposed to be working but left because she had a really horrible toothache and went to the clinic but her car broke down, so then yeah..the manager goes to get her...then corporates arrive, and then the daughters car was going to get towed so she had to run down there and stop the tow truck people or whatever....  so i was supposed to get off at 2:30 and stayed until almost 4:00. whatever. it's my last week. but i H*TE working at the 1st street store. the people who work there are sooooo bitchy. seriously. it sucks. i am so happy i have Dixie for a manager instead of Roberta (the 1st street lady) Dixie NEVER yells at us or gets angry or anything. Roberta leaves like...de*th threats all over. well okay not de*th, but things like "will someone PLEASE explain to me why sharon is paying you to do jobs that you suck at doing, so i get stuck doing them over again for you, Stop being lazy!"  dixie would NEVER. she'd be like, "just to let you guys know, we're going to have to be a little more careful when we're washing dishes. Sharons pretty picky about that."   oi im a space case. i think i'm going to start going to this one "church" with my friend dirk. it sounds really cool. it's the Universal Unitarian or something. and anyway, it's non-denominational. it's just about like, morals, and being a good person and respecting the earth and stuff. I mean, there's a "Pastor" like person who leads discussions, but it's just about being nice and being good to the world, and about bringing beautiful things into existance and being yourself and stuff. i guess like a third of the congregation is g*y but i dont care. Duh. dirk says it's really cool though. i'm excited.  i'm also going to check out brenden's youth group thing. not cuz i want to be christian, but just because i find religion so fascinating. especially christianity and catholicism. just because, there's so much i find in those religions that leaves unanswerable questions. like the bible....i just don't see it as true at all. but i find it fascinating to watch people who do. just because it makes you think.  maybe dirks is the Unitarian Universalists....i forget.  i'd like someday to be able to buy a building and make it just a house of silence. No particular religion. Just a place where people go and it's silent and they can have a time to pray, meditate, worship, whatever they do. Anyone of any religion would be welcome. And maybe if i started bringing in more money, i would dedicate a room to each religion...and that room would be decorated just for the people of that particular religion.

      so my mom's out of town again.  she's visiting erica.  i would have gone, except for that this is my last week of work, so i need to go haha and i can't take any days off on my last week.  well, i can't politely take any days off. i'm going to go get ice cream with brenden, the freshman.  oi.  i think maybe i'm too friendly.  or maybe that one quiz i took is right.  i attract people and am attracted to people who i know very well i could never make it work out with because subconsciously i'm afraid of relationships and being tied down.  yeah.  that's it.  it could never work with this guy.  i dont care so much about age.  no one thinks hes a freshmen...he acts and looks like a junior so whatever.  but i mean, his goal is to become a PASTOR.  yeah.  this would definently not work.  hahah

      yeah i have that song stuck in my head.   anyway, about band.  is it a compliment or an insult when the freshman boys have a crush on you?  is it better that they are actually good looking, quite popular freshman boys?  or does the fact that they are freshmen make it remain an insult?  haha.  i've heard so many pick up lines in the last week.  it's insane.  like this one:  Brenden: Ally!  Ally!  wait up!  You lost your nametag (hands me a sugar packet with "SUGAR" printed across the top.)  Austin: I forgot my teddy bear.  Can I cuddle with you?  Brenden: I can read palms. Close your eyes (starts "tracing" lines on my palm, but is really drawing on it with a pen)  I see you will be calling me soon (his number has been written on my palm)  Brenden: are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside?  Austin: (not a pickup line per say) Do you have a boyfriend?  Would you go out with me if I was a junior? Me: Austin, I'm not answering that.  go away. Austin: So is that a yes, because you don't want me to know?  or is that a no, because you don't want to hurt my feelings...? Me: Austin....go away. Austin: Come one, what is it?? Me: shut up! you're such a nerd.  Austin: Have you ever kissed a rabbit between the ears? Me: No.... Austin: (stands up and pulls the pockets out of his pants) Would you like to?  Austin: Are you strong? Me: Not particularly....but I mean, i could pick you up. Austin: Yeah but that's not hard.  You on the otherhand, I've been trying to pick you up all week and you just wont let me. Me: (blank....)  OHHH I GET IT!  Dan: wanna touch my pecs? Me: sure dan. Dan: Can I touch yours??? Me: um...yeah sure.  Dan: YES!  i got to touch the connective tissue to your upper bre*st! Me: Oh my god...*rolls eyes*  As I walk by a group of freshmen:  loudly: "DON'T YOU THINK RED HEADS ARE SO S*XY???" "YEAH...LIKE THAT ALLY G*RL..."  thanks guys...  or the inevitable stretching thing...we stretch and one of them is where you spread your legs and reach to your left then to your right, you know?  and austin goes "maybe later, ally"  i was just like...you sicko.  then there's the new kid Dustin who's a junior, he's just funny though, but he follows me around a bit  Dustin:  Did you hear about the kidnapping? Me: what happened? Dustin: He woke up.  During cleanup, I was walking with brenden Dustin: Hey ally, you missed a piece of trash. Me: Oh gee i'm sorry.  psh. Dustin: To your right Me: (i turn to my right and brenden is standing there) hahaha

      I'll join the trend. I now have 3 blogs haha.  2 LJs, 1 DJ and a "blogger" or whatever.  I'm horribly     arded with things on my mind.  It's hard to get out.  I'm not a sad person. I'm not angry or lonely or distressed or in-over-my-head...everyone seems to believe that though.  I'm just not complete.  And I will never be complete. Being satisfied, to me, is the equivilant of quitting.  And therefore I am never satisfied.   What's on my mind today? Well, I just got back from band camp.  It was, well, it existed.  Stressful.  Not as fun as any other band camp I have ever been to.  Unfortunately, being a drum major is a much harder job than I imagined.  But maybe I'm wrong...something tells me being me is just a harder job than I imagined.  I got in trouble several times for relaying information from the three drum majors to the director.  He just thinks that I have an attitude problem now, when in fact I'm just this messenger. I'm the only one with the guts to go up and do anything about anything at all.  Whatever.  It's not worth being frustrated.  On tuesday night I went to ani difranco's concert.  It was almost a disaster, and was very upsetting even then.  I arrived at the door only to find out that the ticket master wouldn't let me in because apparently the tickets that had been reserved for me "had already been given to me."  Which of course, they hadn't.  Then they told me to wait for the road manager to come out and talk to me about my tickets (lack thereof).  I waited for an hour and finally told them that I wanted to wait inside and that I needed to get my job done as a reporter and photojournalist.  They told me that there was nothing they could do and basically that I was being silly.  So I pulled out my pad of paper and my pen and asked for their names.  Them: What are you taking our names for hahaha? Me:  Well, I was assigned to write a story about a show tonight several months ago.  And If I'm not going to get in, I still will be turning in a story about a show, even if seeing you is all I get to do.  Them: Oh calm down, we'll get you in, don't worry....(they were a little nervous) They wouldn't give me a VIP ticket though!  Even though I was supposed to have one.  they said VIP was out (liars) and that they were only allowed to give me a general admission anyway.  Whatever.  I was p*ssed.  So I go in, now i can't go backstage.  :(  Not that it mattered in the end because the VIP members were only allowed backstage before the show and I guess Ani didn't come out of her trailer until after the opening act was more than half way done.  So....I get stopped by every guard in there because of my cameras (no cameras were allowed) and so i have to keep showing my photo pass and apparently I was the ONLY photographer from ANY paper there because like 4 of them said, "oh you're the one" But..the show was incredible.  she is so amazing to watch . itw as just .....wow.  it was insane.  i was awestruck....  sadly, she refused to sign autographs and see the fans after the show.  I waited until like midnight, but the guards kept saying that there was no way she was going to see anyone, not even VIP.  It was a big let down.  I wanted an autograph so badly.  But I got a poster and some righteousbabe stickers.  well i'm sort of tired of writing.
