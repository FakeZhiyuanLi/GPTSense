       I'm reaching a vital crossroads in my life, when I will be called upon to determine what it is I want to do in this world, what in fact I want my life to be.  And the only thing I really want, more than anything, is to take a nap.

       In the town where I'm living for the summer, all the churches have those clever little marquee signs in front.  These are not at all common where I come from, so I find them immensely entertaining.  Apart from the obvious  urlLink Simpson's connotation , they are generally fairly amusing, either from an intention to be so (THIS CHURCH IS PRAYER CONDITIONED) or from their usage of FUD tactics (OBEDIENCE MAY BE COSTLY, BUT DISOBEDIENCE IS MORE COSTLY).  As an  urlLink agnostic/atheist , I also found  urlLink this  rather amusing.  And of course there's the ones which were obviously put up by some sweet, innocent church-lady type who is oblivious to the  urlLink innuendo .  The sad thing is, a friend of mine has seen that same sign in a different region of the country, meaning not only did someone decide to put that up outside a church in the first place, someone else saw it and thought it was appropriately inspirational enough to reuse.  
 The largest list of these types of pithy sermons that I found is right  urlLink here .  By the way, I generally have nothing against Christians, or trite sayings, but every single site I found listing funny church signs (including the one I linked to, I'm sorry) had some lame-ass animation on it.

       I asked this guy out the other day.  It seemed like a really good idea at first- he's really great, we get along fabulously, I'm interested in him, he seems at least kind of somewhat interested in me.  I mean, if that's not a textbook example of when to ask someone out, what is?  It wasn't until after all the arrangements were made that I remembered how very bad at the whole dating thing I am, and how nervous I get, and how I hate asking guys out because then there's this awkwardness like do I have to get the door for him? because that's just absurd, and how I try too hard to get them to like me and turn into this fake-laughing sycophant, and how I don't have anything to wear anyway, and OH MY GOD I AM TOO FAT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.  So that was the state I was in when I went to pick him up.  
 Luckily one of us is not a mental case, and he kept the conversation rolling despite my ridiculous level of nervousness.  I did have a good time, and I just have to remind myself that no matter how much I dislike first dates, they are a necessary prerequisite to second and third dates.

      I would just like to note that I have absolutely no control over the advertisements at the top of this page, but I do think it's pretty funny that I'm getting the ads targeted for tall people/people who want to be tall just because of my first post.

      Last night my housemates and I rented   urlLink How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days .  I'm not too proud to admit that I have been dying to see this movie.  I wanted to love this movie, snuggling into its unabashedly smarmy sappiness.  And maybe I'm just too old and cynical for romance flicks anymore, but I didn't.   
 Things that I thought sucked about HtLaGi10D: 
 
  Contrived Plot:  I was willing to let the silliness surrounding the inception of Andie's story idea slide, it's a movie, you have to make a few leaps of logic, right?  But the supposed impetus for Ben's pursuit of Andie exceeded my ridiculousness tolerance level.  Even with the level on my brain turned down to "Romantic Comedy", I still couldn't swallow the premise that major business decisions are made through not only wagers, but wagers over romantic conquests. 
  A Soundtrack is Not a Sledgehammer:  And it shouldn't be used like one.  The purpose of a song in a movie is not to narrate the action being shown on the screen.  I wanted to howl in pain when the classic romantic comedy catch-her-before-she-leaves-town-and-clear-up-all-the-misunderstandings chase scene climax was accompanied by the Gin Blossoms' "Follow You Down".  Get it?  He's  following  her! *chortle*.   
  The Stress Level:  This is more of a personal preference, but all of the over-the-top antics were almost too much for me.  I do think that Kate Hudson is a fabulous actress, as evidenced by her ability to convincingly play a total raving psychotic bitch (actually, play a normal woman masquerading as a psycho, so like a character within a character really).  It's really quite painful to watch in parts, and I just get stressed by movies like that.  I can't sit through  urlLink Meet the Parents  either.   
  I'm a Serious Journalist:  Okay, did Andie come off as politically-minded to you?  Yeah, me neither.  I thought it was great that the character was portrayed as more than just a fluff-headed women's magazine columnist, but a brief mention of wanting to write about important things with no further or more specific dialogue isn't enough to convince me.  And I would like to think that someone with a master's degree in journalism would understand that articles like "How To Bring Peace To Uzbekistan" don't belong in a women's fashion magazine.  (They don't belong in Maxim, either, just to be equal-opportunity). 
 

 Things that saved me from hating HtLaGi10D: 
 
 Kate Hudson being adorable 
 Matthew McConaughy being charming 
 Kate Hudson not being Jennifer Lopez.  The character did remind me of the stock J-Lo character, but at least it wasn't her.  I have nothing against Ms. Lopez, I just end up hating every single movie she's in 
 It was pretty damn funny in parts 
 
 Overall it ended up being one of those movies that I did truly enjoy, but will never watch again.

      Today I got a phone call from a dear friend of mine.  Recently I mailed this dear friend a whole bunch of photos from my recent trip visiting him.   It made for a rather heavy piece of mail, but I slapped four stamps on it, wrote on the envelope "photos enclosed, please do not bend" in several places, and called it good.    The letter arrived in his mail box BENT IN HALF.      Now I don't know about you, but I rarely receive folded mail.  My bills, bank statements, etc. arrive in their long business sized envelopes crisp and neat.  Am I to believe that the United States Postal Service has such limited mail handling equipment that a FIVE BY SEVEN (or whatever, it wasn't very big) envelope can't get through unharmed?   Although I believe I'm justified in my righteous anger, I do have to come clean.  I was very polite in my scrawled requests on the outside of the envelope, but I admit that the letter enclosed made reference to "those Post Office fuckers" and how they better not bend these pictures.  But you know, it was a joke.    There are, of course, only three possibilities for what happened:   Someone bent it DELIBERATELY to be MEAN which, I mean, I'm no angel myself but how can people be like that?  Someone opened the envelope as part of the new government policy of total privacy invasion in the name of the greater good, was insulted, and bent the pictures in revenge.  Okay, I should be nice, but what are they doing reading my mail?  Karma for making fun of the USPS.  I guess I would just have to accept that one

      This summer is the first time in my life that I have worked an honest-to-God, full time, 9-to-5 job before.  I've held plenty of jobs, and if you consider my occupation as student, I'm sure I average well over 40 hours a week.  But there's something different about having work contained to an 8-hour slot in the day.  I am enjoying my work here, but oddly enough I find it much more draining than my heaviest load of coursework has ever been.  What scares me is when I come home from work and want nothing more than to sit in front of the TV for the specific purpose of burning up the rest of the day, and I realize how easily I could turn into one of "those people", stuck on the treadmill.  The phrase killing time comes to mind, because the purpose is jumping ahead a few hours to bedtime.

      Short people of the world hearken:  If you meet someone unusually tall, don't ask them if they play basketball.  I know, the possibility of a sports-related bonding moment ("I like basketball too!  WE like basketball!") may be very tempting indeed, but have some consideration for those poor lanky souls who never succeeded in the one pursuit where abnormal height makes you a god.  They really don't need another person reminding them.  Side note:  when said tall person answers "no", responding with "well, you SHOULD" does NOT help.

       It snowed today!  Like six inches!  Crazy I tell you.  All those poor little trick-or-treaters who will have frozen toes tomorrow night.  
 Hopefully the roads will be clear tomorrow, as I am driving across eight hours of the most boring scenery in the Western U.S., then turning around and driving back on Sunday.  The pathetic thing: yeah it's to see a guy.  The really pathetic thing: he is totally worth it.

       Lately I've been trying to work out a life plan, not a moment too soon either, considering I graduate in December (kind of).  So here's what I have so far:
 Age: 22  - Get a job, live the romance of caffeine-overloaded programmer in a dimly-flourescent-lit cubicle.  Cubicle not absolutely necessary, but I am itching to use my job skills.  Make money.  Work for a couple years.  Explore topics, narrow potential research interests.
 Age: ~26  - Go back to school.  Get accepted somewhere kick-ass in an urban location.  Excel in research and studies, getting a PhD in C.S. and possibly a BA in philosophy but maybe just taking philosophy classes for fun.  
 Age: ~32  - (how long does it take to get a PhD?) Get on the tenure track at a university, teach compilers at least once because that would be a fun class to teach, do neat research.  The PhD/professor thing I'm still pretty flexible about, but I do think I'd like to go into research. Teaching at a university appeals to me because of the balance between teaching and research- two things I like but don't think I could do full time.  

I'm pathetic, can't even plan four years into the future without getting fuzzy around the edges.

       Last night I made the classic mistake of grocery shopping while hungry, thus coming home with armloads of cookies, pizza, and eggnog (I don't even  like  eggnog).  I also came home with a box of Fruit By The Foot, which for the uninitiated is like a really space inefficient Fruit Roll-Up.  I'm usually more of a Gushers kind of girl, but what can I say, I was feeling daring.  Anyway, it wasn't until half a foot into my second roll (serving size one roll? hardly) that I noticed the game printed on the wrapper.  It was called "Shopping Scramble", and presumably sponsored by Mall of America given the tiny logo printed above.  Instructions, and I quote: "These kids not only spent the day hanging together at the Mall, they also spent money on some fun stuff.  Unscramble the items on this receipt to see what they bought."  The items, all but two of which I successfully unscrambled, were a skateboard, soccer ball, cd player, video game, shoes, poster, magazine, bubble gum, shirt, scooter, sunglasses, jeans, bike helmet, watch and guitar.  
 All attempts to be hip by using phrases such as "hanging together" aside, I was a little taken aback at the bluntness of this pitch.  I'm sure my young impressionable mind was subject to all sorts of shameless marketing ploys, but I am pretty sure no one ever tried to sell consumerism to me.  Plus, where the hell are these kids getting their disposable income?  I've never spent that much on "some fun stuff" in one day at the mall, and I'm a 22-year-old college student digging myself into debt with student loans and irresponsible spending, fer chrissakes.

       I woke up this morning around 4:30 a.m. (truth be told I think it was because of a stressful dream about using search and replace in vi, don't ask) and found myself unable to fall back asleep because I was filled with motivation to Be Productive and Get Stuff Done.  Which is weird, because that is not a mental state I frequently find myself in at any time of day, let alone in the wee hours of the morning (my few conscious 4:30 a.m. states are not usually sober ones).  So I ate breakfast, read a little, went to the gym, started some homework, and it was kind of nice to have an early start on the day, but there's no way those extra four hours made up for being fucking exhausted from 11:00 onwards.

       Ever since I've known my current roommate, she has had in her refrigerator a jar containing mushy-looking raspberries in a jar of pale red (raspberry-colored, if you will) liquid.  This means that only in the past year of our acquaintance, there were at least three moments, in the process of moving into three apartments, in which the thought crossed her mind, "oh now I can't throw out the raspberries!"  Never mind the fact that they look disgusting; there has been no appreciable decrease in the raspberry content of the jar (yes I do notice these kind of things).  Even at the paltry rate of consumption of one raspberry per week, that jar would be long gone by now.  
 I'm really not as bothered by this as I sound, mostly just curious.  I move all sorts of junk that I never use around with me, but food?  What goes through one's mind?  It would've lasted through one apartment change with me, but then I would've broken down and admitted that I'm never going to eat that.  Maybe The Jar was a gift, so it's kept around out of guilt.  Maybe it really houses the soul of some dark being and she's its sworn guardian.  I'm sure one day the curiosity will get to me and it'll just come out- "I'm heading to the store, do we need toilet paper, now come on, what's the deal with the raspberries?"

       October Sunday mornings are for lying in bed till noon sipping peach tea and reading poetry.  October Sunday afternoons are for soup and bread and aimless surfing.  Unfortunately, and as a direct consequence, October Sunday evenings are for studying the role of Charlemagne in German history and beginning work on a multi-threaded server program.

       So I'm at my parent's house, and will be for the remainder of the holiday weekend.  I had a pretty good Thanksgiving,  turkey and cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie and all that.  In the spirit of the season, my family is driving me crazy (actual quote from my grandmother: "well, your mother bought two pies, and I bought two pies, so we have an awful lot of pie, I'm going to have some pie, wouldn't you like some pie?"  ARGGH!! )  Of course, my irritability could be due to the cold I've come down with.  (hmm, ending with a preposition, that's bad..."the cold with which I've come down"?  nope, same problem..."the cold, down with which I've come"?  now that's just silly.  Oh well)  My symptoms are runny nose, sore throat, headache, and a unique emotional state that made me be simultaneously hugely annoyed and nearly moved to tears by the movie Elf.  
 Now I face the challenge of getting some homework done in a house with DSL, tons of reading material, and TV.  Later I'll be going out with a dear friend who's also in town for Thanksgiving and doing some post-family get together detox.

       This fall has been my eighth and final semester at this university, making it four and a half years (including a six-month excursion to Germany) since I first came here as a wide-eyed freshman.  It's been a good four and a half years, I've had lots of good times and made lots of good friends.  But I regret not having been involved in more extracurricular activities.  Granted I do have a moderately difficult major, but I certainly haven't spend all or most of my free time studying, I've spent my free time wasting time.
 Usually I'm all about wasting time.  What brings up these regrets is that lately I am seeing all kinds of things I'd like to be involved in, but it seems silly to join up with less than two months left in town.  If I had more time here, I would join the College Democrats and Habitat for Humanity, and be outdoors more, and attend more lectures and concerts.  And I'm seeing more and more that what I thought was a boring little rural town is actually full of fascinating people with fantastic recreation opportunities.  There's a whole side of this town that I never bothered to find, because I was sitting around with my friends trying to figure out something to do that was free.  
 A couple cynical asides: 1) Maybe I only feel so eager to get involved since I know that my imminent departure makes it impractical, i.e., if I  were  going to be around for a couple more years, I'd just find other reasons to sit at home instead.  2) I experienced an ideological shift in the latter part of my education that makes me a lot more likely to want to join the College Democrats, so maybe my only problem is that the shift didn't happen earlier.

       Why do people feel like doing good is an all or nothing proposition?  I've noticed this lately, in my ethics class and in talking to people about free software.  People shy away from getting involved, and I think it's because it seems like too great of a burden.  Like for some reason, it's not enough to use Windows versions of free software, or to learn more about Linux, or dual boot or whatever, they think they have to be (as someone said to me) a "Linux guru" and get rid of Windows alltogether and install Debian and write their own device drivers.  I can see how it's overwhelming, because once you start caring, there is so much to care about, but I don't think the answer is to not care about anything.  
 Not being able to do everything is no reason to not do something.

       Just took a test that kicked my ass, kind of like this whole semester has done.  Sweet, sweet graduation, so close and yet so far away.  
 At least the workshop that I was in charge of today went well.  Really well, in fact, I was afraid that no one would show, or that my lack of planning would be evident, but it was well-attended and everything went smoothly.  The presenter was to thank for it really, he was excellent.  I guess that's the secret of really being a good leader: know how to find good people!  
 So now I can relax for a little while, right?  At least until my math test on Friday and the ACM programming competition on Saturday...

       Things overheard recently that have made me laugh out loud:
  "When I took the ACT, I thought it was out of 100.  I got my score back and I was like, holy shit I'm never going to go to college!" 
 "I'm high on the gospel, baby!  I've been puffin' on the bong of JESUS!"

       Oh my God I have a job offer.  Going off of my dating experience, I figured that three weeks without a call back was probably a bad sign, so when they did call me yesterday I was pretty shocked.  In all truthfulness, I wish they hadn't called back, because then I wouldn't be faced with this dilemma.  It's a great job, working with great people, with a great company...in the shittiest town known to man.  Even my other shitty-town prospect is better than this one, since The Boy will potentially be in that Shitty Town.  And I know the whole point of keeping The Thing with The Boy low key was to keep me nice and independent so I could go wherever I want...but that freedom was supposed to allow me to go to Seattle or San Francisco or Berlin, not Shittiest-Town-Known-To-Man, USA.  Surely I like him more than that.  
 I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do.  Yesterday I was going to turn them down, today I'm thinking of accepting, so who knows what I'll say on Friday when they need an answer.

      In the course of writing my final paper for my German class, I discovered that Immanuel Kant was born on April 22, as was I!  Neat, eh?  My choice of topic must have been destiny. 

I've also discovered that it sucks being a procrastinator AND a perfectionist, because then you end up trying to write a paper the day before it's due, but still taking the time to try to do it well, and ending up disappointed in the finished product and yourself.  Kant, the man whose daily walks were punctual enough for neighbors to set their clocks by, probably never had such problems.

       Time for one of those soul-searching confessions, only to be made in an anonymous online journal...
 I hate feeling stupid more than anything else in the world.  For some reason, that's my weak spot, and it's not uncommon for me to break down bawling.  It's happened to me during tests, after talking to professors, after almost backing into someone, when someone passing on the street makes a snide remark.  A comment that other people would brush off or respond to defensively just cuts me right through.  
 I'm sure it stems from the fact that my whole life I've sought desperately for the approval of others.  I don't think I'm stupid, but I just need to accept that everyone does stupid things sometimes, and not get so upset about it.

       No Debian install today, or for a while, sadly.  My professor for my online class decided to change the status of the first essay from being "due whenever" to "due Friday".  Lovely.

       Two things I discovered recently that rock my socks:
 - urlLink jigdo .  In order to keep busy without actually doing anything productive, I'm going to install Debian stable on my machine where Redhat 8.0 currently resides, and I used jigdo (short for "jigsaw download") to download the CD images.  What it does is instead of actually downloading a large binary CD image file, it takes a specified .jigdo file, which tells it all the files that will be on the finished CD, runs around grabbing these files, then assembles them on the fly into an exact copy of the original image (okay, that's a half-assed explanation, but if you want a better one go to their  urlLink website ).  So not only are you not waiting forever for one monolithic download to complete, if you want to download a newer version of an image, it can grab only the modified files, and use the unchanged old ones already on your computer.   urlLink Apparently  in the future jigdo will be the main way of distributing Debian images, so this is probably old news but I still thought it was cool.  
 - urlLink MUDDA  (via  urlLink BoingBoing )   Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel have formed the Magnificent Union of Digitally Downloading Artists, a group of artists that seeks to "help transform the music business in such a way that artists are on level terms with record companies, receive fair payments and have new opportunities to be their own retailer when they choose."  I think this is what most consumers want: a way to compensate the artists they appreciate, without lining the pockets of record executives and propping up an outmoded distribution system.  It's promising to see things moving in this direction.

       "I'm losing my mind", she said sadly, finally giving up in frustration after struggling to complete her sentence.  This is what scares me, more than the prospect of having almost translucent papery skin, or being barely able to guide the spoon to my mouth with uncontrollably trembling hands, or having my frame shrink slowly as my bones become so brittle that stumbling results in a head injury that lands me in the hospital and then in a care center for recuperation.  
 I don't really know what to say in response.  We both know it's true.  I smile grimly and say, "I feel that way sometimes too", as I reach over to her wheelchair armrest to hold her bird-light hand.  She doesn't know who I am most of the time, which is understandable considering how much I've changed from the young child she knew me as.  
 What scares me about it is the moments of lucidity.  If you lost your mind completely, you would be blissfully unaware.    But it comes and goes, and when it goes you are terrifyingly aware of your helplessness and loss of control.  You realize that the part of yourself that is you, the part that is supposed to transcend the physical, is falling apart and breaking down just as surely as your physical body is.  
 I think this is also what scares me about death.  If there's nothing after this, if I'll simply cease existing, then I won't care because I won't exist anymore to care.  But maybe in short moments leading up to or during non-existence, some part of you awakens, and faces the void, watching itself being extinguished, perceiving the end of its perception.  
 "I don't remember what I was saying", she goes on apologetically.  She looks past me to the fresh daffodils jammed into a vase with the two-day-old tulips on the small table, absurdly bright on a drizzly February afternoon, and sighs.  "Those flowers are just so beautiful, that's what I want to say.  They're so beautiful".

       I am so broke.  I am the kind of broke that makes you think about buying lottery tickets, or pawning possessions, or working in a call center.

       I went to a friend's baby shower today, the second in a couple weeks.  I've pretty much given up being weirded out by everyone getting married, so the fact that everyone I know seems to be breeding just cements our existence in very different worlds.  These showers have consisted of a bunch of young married women, most with at least one kid; I have been one of two or three single women at each.  It's weird to me, it's like here you go straight from being a child to being middle-aged and responsible, but it still smacks of playing house.  
 I realize now that I used to be obsessed with marriage, as most of my friends were.  But this wasn't entirely our fault, we had no intermediary steps of adulthood.  Every now and then I get a glimpse of how I used to think, like how I should be jokingly but secretly truly bitter about not being married.  Maybe this shows that deep down I still have that mindset, but when I'm elsewhere, in cultures where 22 and unmarried is to be expected, it rarely even crosses my mind how I'm "supposed" to feel.

       I've only been out of the state for a month and a half now, but I do get nostalgic for the absurdities and quirks of Utah culture.  I can usually get my fix by reading the  urlLink opinion section  of BYU's  urlLink student newspaper , but that appears to have tapered off for the summer.  Luckily, David Pogue at the  urlLink New York Times  brought me this story about the Utah-based company  urlLink ClearPlay  which is offering a DVD player that cleans up Hollywood's act:
 Its scene-cutting technology, called ClearPlay, comes from a Utah company of the same name. Its executives maintain that by sanitizing movies, they're actually doing Hollywood a favor by building a broader audience.   Hollywood begs to differ. Actually, it sues to differ... 
 Hah!  Of course this whole controversy has been going for a while - stores such as  urlLink CleanFlicks , which are wildly successful in Utah, have been selling chopped versions of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan for ages now, and despite protests of directors, I'm pretty sure it's still legal for them to do so.  
 I am somewhat torn on the issue, being both a lover of movies and an advocate of fair use rights.  If I wanted to make a filter that would do the opposite of ClearPlay (call it FoulPlay!) and only view the naughty bits of my favorite DVDs that I have legally purchased, it should be my right to do so.  So my attitude towards these editing services and technologies is like that of a Catholic towards abortion:  I believe they are morally abhorrent, but should remain legal.  
  P.S.  - Exploring the CleanFlicks  urlLink site  sorely makes me want to change my stance.  They are offering The Godfather (so I guess nothing is sacred), and Kill Bill Vol. 1 (haven't seen it, but from what I've heard, it sounds like editing out the violence will not leave much).   The stupid thing about offering edited versions of these films, as Pogue points out, is that they were not intended for children, and no amount of snipping will make them so.  CleanFlicks and their ilk are catering to adults who want to infantilize themselves, and have someone protect them from the big bad scary world of "fuck" and breasts, and help them feel assured that they will still go to heaven since they have still never defiled themselves with a rated-R movie.  
 Movies are rated R because they are for grown-ups.  Don't watch them if you're not one.  
  P.P.S.  - That's why I shouldn't read about this topic, because it makes me angry.

       I don't know what I find more amusing, the fact that the Center for Online and Internet Addiction has a  urlLink website , or the fact that said website promptly crashes my browser (not just Firefox, IE too).

       I love it when I can help a co-worker find an answer to a programming problem.  Even if it takes me way, way too long to track down what should have been a fairly straightforward solution. 
 And out of the goodness of my heart I even stayed an extra 45 minutes at work to do it.  Karma, FYI, you totally owe me.  
 Off to the BF's house for the weekend!

       Amazon got the better of me today, and I have two shiny new books on the way:
  urlLink   How to Cook Everything: Simple Recipes for Great Food   I have this great kitchen all to myself, so now all I need for my journey to culinary greatness is a cookbook.  Also I'm kind of a fanatic recipe-follower, so this one sounds great in that it covers the basics that everyone supposedly knows but really no one does, like how to pop corn on the stovetop.  
  urlLink   Women Don't Ask : Negotiation and the Gender Divide   Sounds like it should be an interesting look at gender issues in the workplace, hopefully without lapsing into either blaming the male patriarchy or telling women they are biologically unfit to compete. 
 I wanted a copy of this for my birthday, but I was too afraid to ask.  Har.

       Since he didn't visit me over the weekend, BF came over to my place last night.  We set up the little charcoal grill that I bought almost a year ago, and he showed me his Secret Technique For Grilling Chicken:   Step 1:  Stack coals in pyramid and light with match in several spots   Step 2:  After the flames have died out, spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the barbecue grill   Step 3:  Place the chicken on the grill, and shut the lid   Step 4:  Have a beer while you're waiting for the chicken to cook   Step 5:  Check the chicken, and see that it's not done yet   Step 6:  Have another beer while you're waiting for the chicken to cook   (etc.)   The chicken never actually gets cooked all the way, but eventually you're drunk enough that you eat it anyway.

       Trying to post daily now, but there won't be any posts over the weekend...damn I need DSL.  The BF also is not coming to visit as planned, which is a bummer, but if it keeps him from passing on his cold to me I guess it's for the best.  
 Plans for the weekend:  Check out the farmer's market  Finish unpacking my goddamn boxes already for pete's sake it's been a month what are you useless or something?  Clean my car  Go sit somewhere sunny and read the Sunday paper with a cup of coffee

       My grocery store of choice since moving here has been  urlLink WinCo .  Their prices are low, they're open 24 hours a day, and they seem to be relatively non-evil, being  urlLink employee-owned  and all.  
 An additional perk is that a purchase of $50 or more entitles you to a $0.10 per gallon discount on fuel.  In these times of soaring fuel costs, that makes me more loyal to WinCo than I am to my own family.  
 The problem is, $50 is a little on the high side of what a single person living on their own will likely spend on groceries.  Almost without fail, after I make the rounds through the aisles, I look down at my meagerly filled shopping cart and feel my stomach fill with dread at the thought of a $47.89 grocery bill.  Desperately I think of something, ANYTHING else that I need, or even might want, or even might like to have around just in case.  Pickles?  Sure, I need some of those.  Carton orange juice is pricy, but hey why not.  Soon I'm in Supermarket Sweep mode, careening my overfull cart around the promotional displays frantically grabbing gourmet hams and huge wheels of imported cheese.  
 But the best part is that I know full well that the piddly gas tank in my Corolla holds only 10 gallons of gas, and at $0.10 a gallon...It's like, my brain KNOWS I'm only saving a dollar, but some illogical math-illiterate part of it (I suspect the same part that wants to buy lottery tickets, and coincidentally probably the same part that totally digs Supermarket Sweep) still thinks I'm getting a screaming deal.

       Employment ethics notwithstanding, it is a good thing to wait until after-work hours for personal internet usage, because then your co-workers will have gone home and won't be there to be made nervous by your hysterical giggling over  urlLink these  Weight Watchers cards from 1974.  
 I'm sure this is one of those things that like everyone on the internet already has seen, but honestly, I was in tears.  My personal favorites:  urlLink Bean and Mushroom Salad  (salad as in jello salad, horrifyingly enough),  urlLink Inspiration Soup , and the incomparable  urlLink Frankfurter Spectacular!  (exclamation point mine, but really it needed it, no?)

       During all my years of college, I've lived mostly in furnished apartments, and always with well-outfitted roommates, so household items that I have acquired have tended to be supplementary - one year no one brought an answering machine, so I purchased a phone/answering machine combo, we were in need of extra glasses so I bought a set, etc.  But the consequences of my thrifty college days hit me when I moved into my very own apartment three weeks ago and found myself desperately under-supplied, or rather, mis-supplied.  I had a pizza cutter, but no pots or pans; I had a bathroom rug, but no shower curtain; I had a computer desk, but no bed.  
 Unfortunately, I didn't notice many of these missing items until I found myself in need of them, and thus my first morning getting ready for work in my new apartment was a MacGyver-esque adventure, trying to wash my hair in the bathtub, and eating instant oatmeal prepared with hot tap water out of a tupperware container with a measuring spoon.
 A few paychecks later, things are much better.  I have a bed, and cookware, and a shower curtain, but the furnishings of my apartment are still mostly cardboard.  It's overwhelming really, even though I feel like I have way too much stuff (a sentiment that arises whenever I have to move it all) it seems that there's this endless list of more to buy.

      So I really had every intention of letting this blog die alone and neglected, at least until I had a proper server to put it on.  But Blogger has wooed me back, with one simple feature:  urlLink posting via email .  I can't even begin to tell you how helpful it is to be able to disguise a purely time-wasting activity as something potentially work-related.

Updates:  I have a job now.  Things I like about it:  I work on interesting and challenging problems, the people I work with are great, they just gave me a kick-ass computer, I now live 7.5 hours closer to my boyfriend, and last but not least they are giving me money, which honestly I was getting so  urlLink desperate  for that I really was not in the mood to turn down  urlLink another  job offer.  Things I'm not crazy about:  I still feel pretty unsure about how things work socially around here, I'm left on my own most of the time (which will be good eventually when I get more settled, but I feel a little lost sometimes), and I'm not crazy about the location.  Overall it's a really good situation, and I am happy here.
