      Must be wondering what this title is all about.  This is the liner written on the 1 of the 4 T-Shirts I bought on saturday shopping Spree at Westside (for those who donno Westside - Its a brandname owned by TATA and now a days have sell almost everything made of fabric ;-) )  So what were the other 3 T-Shirts have ;-)    1. I only drink to be Anti-Social 2. Don't Keep the faith, Spread it around. 3. Always be Sincere, whether you serious or not.   I wonder from where this ppl get the liners for T-shirt.  A weekend before, me and vikas were roaming around and had a look at those   FCUK - The french Connection   branded ones at GK ...They were fundoo..LOUD to the extreames... ;-)  Our unamiously favorite one had     Virgins' - Search and Rescue Team    well the weekend was blasted away with 3 movies.  1. Yuva - (Hindi - Young) - Fundoo movie, nothing less was expected out of Maniratnam. 2. Hum Tum - (Hindi - We and You) - Harry meets Sally types; had a good laugh. 3. Along came Polly - Awesome, Never go on scuba diving on yr honeymoon ;-)  there are again a lot coming up and several are still pending  1. Van Helsing 2. The Day after tommorow. 3. Harry Potter - Prisoner of Azkaban 4. Shrek 2  So many movies and 3 Weddings to attend and a upcoming Release of Service Pack 1...So much to do...What do u ? Am I too busy ?

      Sometime back I was reading 'Discovery of India-J.Nehru'. This is quoted from it  It is a excellent illustration of what it took to create a woman.  F.W. Bain in 'The digits of moon' wrote  In the begining, when Twashtri (The Divine Artificer) came to the creation of woman he found that he exhausted his materials in the making of man and no solid elements were left.  In this dilemma, after profound meditation he did as follows;     He took the rotundity of moon, and the curves ofthe creepers, and the clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of grass, and the slenderness of the reed, and the bloom of flowers, and the lightness of leaves, and the tapering of elephant's trunk, and the glances of deer, and the clustering of rows of bees, and the joyous gaiety of sunbeams, and the weeping of clouds, and the fickleness of the winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the vanity of peacock, and the softness of parrot's bosoms, and the hardness of adamant, and sweetness of honey, and the cruelity of tiger, and the warm glow of fire, and the coldness of snow, and the chattering of jays, and cooing of kokila, hypocracy of crane, and fidelity of chakravaka, and than compounded all these together, he made woman and gave it to man.     not a easy recepie for God even !!

      Long ago, I read   "Devdaas - Sharat Chandra".   Here is the last Paragraph from the novel. Its not only the theme of the novel but also the truth of LIFE  Aap log jo kahani padenge humse hi gamgeen (Grief-striken) honge. To bhi kabhi agar   Devdas jaise badnaseeb, Asayanmi (one who has no control over himself ) aur Papi   se parichaye ho, to uske liye prarthna (Pray) kijiyega. prarthna kijiyega ki aur chahe jo bhi ho, uske jaisi   maut (Death)   kisi ki na ho. Marne ka koi gum nahin, lekin koi   sneh-sparsh   (touch of love) us samay uske lalaat (forehead) tak pahuche-ek bhi karuna-vigalit (grief striken), snehmey (lovely) mukhra(face) dekhte hue es jivan ka ant(End) ho.   Marte vaqt jisse veh kisi ki aakh mein aansoon ki ek boond dekh ker mur sake.(So that at the time of his death he can see at least a drop of Tear in the eye of someone Pear  )   Here is the   English Translation   of the paragraph  All those who shall read this story shall be grief striken like us. Even than if you ever get introduced to anybody as   unlucky and sinner as Devdaas  , than please Pray that   no matter what happens, his life should not end and he should not recieve death like Devdaas  . There is no grief about dying, but there should be "touch of love" over his forehead, there should be a   lovely face dipped in sorrow in front of his eyes when He dies  . So that at the time of his death, he can see at a   drop of tear in the eye of someone Pear  .                [This Last line is the only truth for which a human Lives]     [This is what for which he fights his whole life   "to have someone who shall Cry, when He Die"  ]

      Well, This is 3rd of the 3 books bought last weekend. So This weekend shall be spent with these books only..3 Books and Me ;-)  I wonder Did we ever thought   "Who will cry When We Die ?"    Baherhaal (Hindi - Anyhow), If the title had been   "Who will die When you cry ?"  , it would have been more fundoo..;-)

      Being at war has its own pros and cons. And Being at WAR with GOD, I sometimes feel is a real cruicial and herculean task at Hand.  But over the years I felt that GOD is equally a good Enemy as HE is a friend.  Like every war we also have pact between us which says,   "Whatever GOD shall ask from me not for himself, I shall grant him that & whatever I shall ask HIM not for myself, He shall grant me that."    Here is what I desire now.  (I feel HE also read my blog. Though I don't expect a comment from HIM ;-))   "2 of my friends are in urgent need of happiness. Grant them". 1 requires a handsome job and another one needs guts to marry the girl of his choice.

      This was pretty interesting...Though its just a speculative view, but still it offers some insight in Why ;-)   Aries  Your kisses are quick and passionate fits of lustful pleasure that are there and then gone.   Taurus  Your kisses linger; they are deliberate, heartfelt and they can go on and on and on.   Gemini  Your kisses are interrupted by spasms of giggles, smiles and funny observations.   Cancer  Your kisses are warm and tender, and you never want to let them go.   Leo  Your kisses are wild and uninhibited, biting and clawing; you expect applause for your performance.   Virgo  Your kisses are so subtle and tidy, your lover only notices them once you've finished.   Libra  Your kisses are passionate and would be given only when you are seriously involved.   Scorpio  You skip the kiss and get straight to whatever comes next for you.    Sagittarius  Your kisses are surprising, spontaneous affairs that leave the kissed wanting more.   Capricorn  Your kisses are intense moments of sublime relief from the stress of your day.   Aquarius  Your kisses are wet and messy, and you tend to keep your eyes open.   Pisces  Your kisses are starry-eyed, amorous and long-lasting.

Friday was definately TGIF, Saturday was at Ruby's Tuesday and Sunday was at PVR and then at Twister, GK.  A lot we all chatted and a lot we all remembered together....  So folks this B-day life was both FUN and Funny together.

      I had thought about this when recession struck Indian Shores in July 2001. A round of firing happened at our premises also. But I never got time to publish or even write. Here it is now....  Last day at varsity, ppl are happy around me, I am not, coz I don't have my cubicle.  Day 1 at Job, Met new ppl, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Induction complete, Assigned to Product, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Slogged for continuous 36 hrs, Product delivered, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Late Stays, Pizza treats, icecreams is the jargon cholesterol rising, becoming diabetic, But I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Girlfriend got married, Life is screwed, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Mom today said "Take care Son", Pop is furious, but I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  I can't remember the day when I relished and felt content to heart, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Forgot to take turns on the way to home, I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Girlfriend gave birth to a child, no hopes now, But I am still happy, coz I have my cubicle.  It's been long since I chatted with BIG BG, I hope he remembers me, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  News is spreading, Recession is on its prowl, Worried am I, Still I am happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Today it doomed here finally, friends are leaving, Some are shocked, Some are afraid, I should be happy, coz I have my cubicle.  Only lonely I felt, deep down something is broken, Someone is hurt I am trying hard to be happy, But I am not, coz I STILL have my cubicle.  O lord !! Devil is kind than you, I am now at WAR with you I want to be happy, I don't desire this cubicle

      A thing of beauty is joy forever   I donot remember exactly when and where I heard this. So while writing this I searched for it on google. Google is such an amazing thing. You know folks now if u search "hirdesh gupta" on google u will get my profile as the first link. This blog thing is really great and its making me so much popular.  Anyhow back to the topic.  So I found out that this quote was said by ouw own John Keats as "A thing of beauty is a joy forever; its loveliness increases; it will never pass into nothingness."  This gave me thought Do I still remeber the joy I get from a sight of beauty. Yes ! came as an answer, there are innumberable stuff I still remember.  I still remember the   twinkle of her eye,   I still remember the   dimple on her cheek,   I still remember the   dew on her hairs,   I still remember the   smile on her face,   I still remember the   warmth of her cozyness,   I still remember the   shrill of her voice,   I still remember the   depth of her thoughts,   I still remember the   height of her dreams,   I still remember the   aroma of her body,   I still remember the   scent of her attire,   I still remember the   shine of her earring,   I still remember the   glow of her skin,   I still remember the   pink of her lips,   I still remember those   sensuous curves,   I still remember those   seductive swells,   I still remember the   attitude in her turns,   I still remember the   touch of her hands,   I still remember the   angle of her smile,     I remember so much of her, does she still remember my name ?

      What fun it is doing nothing, sitting idle and staring at the empty space. I was amazed at the  calm, sooth and peace  it rendered to me yesternight.  It was around midnight, that I woke up, donno why ? I even cannot remember whether I was having a  dream or a nightmare , when I woke. So I went to the roof,  lit the 2nd last cig  (There are always few cigs at secret places hidden at home ;-)), and sat resting my back onto the wall.  I rose my head & started oogling a distant star.   Thought machine (TM)   invoked itself.  "What the heck Are you doing ?", "Its middle of the night, don't You have anything to ponder upon",    I said,  "Don't feel like !!"   TM said,  "You have one of the finest collection of books in yr wardrobe, Several of them are unfinished, Why don't you finish anyone of it ?"   I said,  "How much will it matter, If I finish one more, I know what the author must have talked about in the climax"   TM continued,  "You can call sbdy and talk to him or her, at least don't sit idle, its not like you"   I was now furious,  "Will you ever let me sit in peace ?"   TM was not bothered,  "You have gone insane, Think dear !! Think about future, Think about fetching new Job, think about the gal to whom u winked today, think about being the Howard..."   Disgusted I felt and thus interrupted,  "Go to hell, and take all these worries with you only. Lemme sit here and Stare at the empty space and leave me alone"    TM smiled, there was mockery and sarcasm, but no joy.   I ignored him now and sat and sat there....  staring   ...finishing the cig and kindled another and continued staring....   Then there was NO TM, NO THOUGHT, NO WILL, NO DESIRE, NO GF, NO FRIEND, NO PL, NO VP, NO TESTLAB, NO MBA, NO BANGY, NO BOMBAY, NO US, NO EUROPE, NO FRENCH, NO JARGON, NO LINGO, NO GOD, NO LADY LUCK, NO YOU & NO ME.   Now  there is only SPACE and EYES staring at it.

      Everybody must have noticed till now that blogger has come up with new interface to fill in the posting. Its lovely and have so many features.     Now I donot have to use  "hello"  to post in pics. The interface has the link.     Do not have to identify the html tags to align the text. The interface has buttons similar to MSWord.

      So folks after a long time a posting again, and that too not original. Sent to me by Medha (Thanx Medha !! ) and coz of certain reasons, I am posting it on the blog.  1. I donot have anything new to post right now.  2. This literature satisfy few of my criteria on what to post and what not. 3. I am at WAR with LORD, which implies I know He is There.   Waise, BTW "How many of us believe in Santa or say GOD himself ?"   After reading tell me what shall u do if u were the Protagonist i.e "RUTH" in the story.  Soon there shall be a senti stuff to be posted tonight. Staying at office again late night. :(  So here it is    Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter. She picked it up and looked at it before opening, but then she looked at the envelope again.  There was  no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address . She read the letter:   Dear Ruth:  I`m going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I'd like to stop by for a visit.  Love Always, Jesus   Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table.  "Why would the Lord want to visit me? I'm nobody special. I don't have anything to offer."   With that thought, Ruth remembered her empty kitchen cabinets. "Oh my goodness, I really don't have anything to offer. I'll have to run down to the store and buy something for dinner."   She reached for her purse and counted out its contents. Five dollars and forty cents. "Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts, at least."  She threw on her coat and hurried out the door.   A loaf of French bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of milk...leaving Ruth with grand total twelve cents to last her until Monday.   Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager offerings tucked under her arm.   "Hey lady, can you help us, lady?"   Ruth had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed in little more than rags  "Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and my wife and I have been living out here on the street, and, well, now it's getting cold and we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you could help us. Lady, we'd really appreciate it."   Ruth looked at them both.  They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to.  "Sir, I'd like to help you, but I'm a poor woman myself. All I have is a few cold cuts and some bread, and I'm having an important guest for dinner tonight and I was planning on serving that to Him."  "Yeah, well, okay lady, I understand. Thanks anyway.."  The man put his arm around the woman's shoulders, turned and headed back into the alley.  As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her heart.   "Sir, wait!" The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the alley after them. "Look, why don't you take this food. I'll figure out something else to serve my guest."   She handed the man her grocery bag.  "Thank you lady. Thank you very much!"  "Yes, thank you!" It was the man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she was shivering. "You know, I've got another coat at home. Here, why don't you take this one." Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders.  Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her coat and with nothing to serve her guest.   "Thank you lady!  Thank you very much!"  Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer Him.  She fumbled through her purse for the door key. But as she did, she noticed another envelope in her mailbox.   "That's odd. The mailman doesn't usually come twice in one day." She took the envelope out of the box and opened it.    Dear Ruth:  It was so good to see you again. Thank you for the lovely meal. And thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.  Love Always Jesus     The air was still cold, but even without her coat, Ruth no longer noticed.

So folks how is it...

      When I heard it, I was almost shocked, Who wrote this Dialogue to be spoken by our    Peter Parker aka Spiderman.     Spiderman is supposed to be a Superhero and superhero never say these kind of words. He is supoosed to be   "Man of Steel".    Even James Bond never shows that he "Bleeds". Why Spiderman ?  Is it just that he is more human, or is it something else the creator of the Spiderman wanna to convey.  Anyways think about it....   Why Spiderman being a Superhero said this ?    ...
