						   Well, this is my first post on here, dont know if Im actually gonna stick to writing on here, lets just hope that I do for the sake of myself and the readers out there. Well, Monday, another boring day at work as usual, except for one thing, my crappy Supervisor is on holidays for 2 weeks, YES!!!...Time to relax and work without him behind my back. You know what I hate, new workers taking vacation days off, i mean cmon, you just started working there...Like today, this guy thats been working at my place for 5 months now has been taking a lot of vacations lately, Today I asked my boss for the friggin days off, the long weekend of september so I can spend it relaxing with my Girlfriend and my family, next thing you know my boss tells me the new guy has got it booked off already, I was like WTF???...Totally pissed me off.... Well, work was work as usaul expect for one thing thats been making me sad all day...I didnt mean to hurt her emotionally, I guess all she could ever think about how bad I treated her...Its like a test, I try to keep her happy all the time, one slip and our arguements turn out how our fate is gonna be, she blindy doesnt see the way how I feel about her, how I treat her, how I love her.. Over and over again she tells me "You've changed from the first time we went out till now" well this is what I think:  WHO DO YOU THINK?  Who do you think snuggles with you everytime we're laying down?   Who do you think is the last person I talk to before going to bed?   Who do you think says your cute or hot because I mean it and also to make you feel good?   Who do you think I chill with 60% of my week with?   Who do you think gives words of advice about your jobs, life, helping you at the gym, giving you pointers?   Who do you think surprises you with food and other stuff when least expected?   Why do you thinkI picked up all those travel guides from sears? Because i know one day I wish to take you on a trip   Who do you think I kiss and hug and tell her " I hope your day goes well tommorow" before leaving your house"   Who do you think says " gnight, sleep tight, sweet dream, dont let the bed bugs bite" before going to bed?   Who do you think gives you full support of what decisions in life you may encounter?   Who do you think I tell all my stories about my day to, even though its the same old boring thing?   Who do you think says "I love you" the most?      and you know what, after all this I thought the littlest things mattered to you...      Now, Here I am just sitting at home, staring at this blog, always looking back and forth at her picture because I truly miss her...Things have changed but my love remains the same.
