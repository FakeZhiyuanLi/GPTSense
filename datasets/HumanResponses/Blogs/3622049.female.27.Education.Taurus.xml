      Sometimes I crawl into bed and wonder if I'll ever have that amazing feeling of comfort again.  You know the one.  The one where someone you love has his arms wrapped around you, holding you, like they never want to let you go.  That feeling of safety, comfort, love.  The feeling that know matter what else happens life is good just because of this one, wonderful person.  Often I just lay there and pretend.  Pretend he's in the next room and that any minute now he will come crawl into bed and hold me.  Sometimes I just wish I could change something in my past or present to make that happen.  Other times I lay down and I can't pretend.  I can't bear the thought of it all.  So I put on a movie to distract me until I fall into blissfully unaware sleep.  Sometimes I just can't face the night. That's a hard thing for me because I love night time.  I love the darkness.  I love the stars.  I love the subtle beauty.  Daylight brings harsh reality.  Night hides it all in a delicate light.  My favorite is an evening rain storm.  When I was young I use to sneak out of the house during those night time rains and dance under the stars in our back yard.  It had a special meaning to me.  Something... indescribable.

      I'm dead tired.  I had to be up by 5 so we can leave at 6 to work an obnoxiously long two days in Belen.  Of course I'm ready to go and no one else is.  Same old, same old.  I feel absolutely no desire to move.  I just want to crawl back in bed and sleep for a few more hours.  Days like this always remind me of basketball season where we had practice at 5:30am.  Having to roll out of bed, eat breakfast, and drive into town, all for the fun and joy of running suicides and shooting hoops.  I am to tired to write anymore.

      The ex is improving about calling the little one when she's with me.  He's already tried twice this summer.  One more week till we go hide out in my old home town. Tomarrow and Saturday is the huge yardsale.  I wonder if there is really going to be anyone but us.   Talked to my sister today.  She's having a hard time dealing with her husband's teenager.  She's never been quite sure how she fits in, having only been married to him for about three years.  It's fine when his kids aren't around, she's just not sure about how to handle the lack of disipline factor when they do show up.  That's were my ex's wife has it easy.  She got in while my little one is still young enough to assume that all adults must be respected equally.   Though you got to wonder how complicated things will be for them when the new baby gets old enough to realize that my little one gets cards and packages from me all the time. I wonder if they will favor him trying to make it seem more equal and there by only upseting my little one.  It will be a tricky situation for them. I have been very tired today.  I think it's something in the air, because both me and the little one took a nap today.  Not the usual occurance.

      I would be in a good mood today if it weren't for the pain I've been in all week.  I have so many mildish things wrong with me that people have occasionally accused me of being a hypochondriac.  Before you go down that lane a let me give you this: hyÂ·poÂ·chonÂ·driÂ·a    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (hp-kndr-) n.  The persistent conviction that one is or is likely to become ill, often involving symptoms when illness is neither present nor likely, and persisting despite reassurance and medical evidence to the contrary. Also called hypochondriasis.  Plural of hypochondrium.  Now the differance between me and that is that I acctually have medical evidence of my problems.  Really I'm just tired of people laughing at me when I tell them something is wrong.    This was not what I intended to go off on though.  I was really think of the bad old day's when I was still in Highschool.  I don't want to go back to that, it's just that I miss the daily contact with my friends.  Now we're scattered all over the world.  In ten more days I'm going to be going back to my home town.  In another month I'll see an old friend I haven't seen in nine years.

      Today I heard a voice I hadn't heard in 9 years.  From across the ocean he called me.  It would have been nice to hear from an old friend, but the connection was bad, and I was not at my best.  I get floored easily by bad connections.  Hopefully he will call again before another nine years go by.    It was... 1991, back of the movie theater, when I had my first kiss.  It was sweet, and then his friend started teasing him and they almost got in a fight.  The next boy to kiss me was 1992, after a 4-H dance at State Conference.  Then there was the third one, in the highschool auditorium.  After that most of it's vague.  Once the innocence of youth is lost each kiss in your life seems a little less special, less memorable.  It's been a year and a half scince the last time I was kissed.

      I'm always looking for someone to sweep me off my feet.  I want that whole "true love" nonsense.  I was married for two miserable years.  Oh we had our good moments, I would have stayed forever just because I hate the idea of divorce.  He left me for another woman, and far from being devastated, I've been happier ever sense. The real problem is that I throw myself whole heartily into these relationships only to find out that the one I'm with is not quite that into it. So now I'm working on not doing that.  Trying to teach myself to hold back some of that overwhelming passion that makes me think this time he's the one.  Right now it's real easy, there's no one in my life. :)

      Every time I hear another US soldier has been killed or injured in Iraq my heart skips worried about you.  Are you okay?  It's been over a week since I last heard from you, but maybe your just busy.  Maybe I'm crazy to worry, but I just got you back in my life, my dear friend, and I don't want to lose you now.  Stay safe and I'll hope for peace.

      I want a family.  My daughter has been talking a lot about her baby brother.  He hasn't been born yet, and he will be born in August to her step-mom.  The whole thing makes me wistful.  I wanted to be the one who was giving her siblings.  I wanted to have a real family, like the one I grew up in.  Only without the constant fear of divorce, the lying, and the confusion.  I wanted to go on summer vacations, have Christmas mornings at home with the kids, curl up with the man I love at night.  I have these dreams about a little boy with brown hair.  I wanted that. People try to convince me I still have a chance at that and I hope I might.  I just don't know if I can risk it again.  If I'm brave enough.

      I don't know what I'm doing.  I second guess myself too much.  I over analyze everything I do and everything every one else does.  What's the point of it all? I'm obsessing over lack of contact with a couple of friends.  Is it just that they are very busy, or did I do something wrong?  Why do I obsess like this? What does it matter? I think he's concerned about something that happened nine years ago.  This kind of puts things in perspective.  If he's worried about how I'll react to seeing him again because of something that I was never really upset about nine years ago... How silly is that?  And how silly am I for always worring about how people are reacting to little things?   The thing is there are somethings you can and should keep to yourself.  Are you going to be annoyed about this latter or is it just the moment that it annoys you?  If it's a constant problem get it out in the open, but pick your moment.  One where your all in a good mood and can have a open honest discussion.  Don't let it all fall apart because your not communicating clearly.   That's what happened to my marriage.  I thought everything was fine.  Not perfect, but good.  He was miserable, but wouldn't tell me.  At least not clearly.  Oh, he'd occasionaly have this discussion with me about things, but in the end I didn't realize it was as big a deal.  Really I think he just wanted it to come easy.  Marriage is not like a fairy tale.  It's not easy, but if you really love someone and if your in love then try.   I think that's the problem with today's society.  It's not concedered a big deal to be divorced, so people don't work as hard at their marriages.  The subconsious thread seems to be if it's not easy no big deal we'll just move on to the next one.  I just want to stay single or find someone who feels like I do about not getting divorced.  I can't go through that again.

      Sometimes I miss the carefree days of highschool.  Then I come home to visit my parents and that cures that.  I love my family.  I just don't like all the tension in the house.  It's a long battle between the younger sibs and the parents.  Occasionally they try to score points with the parents by ratting each other out.  Other times they cover for each other.  So far no ones winning.  The oldest of the younger set is about to move out.  The middle of the younger set is being sent to the Chandler's Ranch for a month in hopes of staighting him out or at least giving the parents a break. Really I just miss the constant companionship of my friends.  It's hard to be so lonely all the time.

           Wondering were I've been?  I've been hanging out with the family, and not having a chance to update.  Which frustrates me.  I like to get things out.  I like to write out my thoughts even if they don't make sense.      I was flirting with a friend online today.  It started out cutesy and ended with a possible proposition.  Then I have to wonder if I'm being... hypocritical.  He has a girlfriend, she's 19 and he's 27.  I don't take that seriously, which is probably wrong of me.  The thing is I've had a thing for him for fifteen years.  I just don't want to admit that he's not available.  Then again if he's talking to me the way he was, how serious can he be about this girl?  I know I'm just making excuses.  I don't know.  It would be easier if I knew her.  Easy to just say no.  But when she's this faceless nobody in Florida... it's easier to say yes.  Of course maybe he was just kidding.

      If you haven't guessed from my post titles, I love Aerosmith.  I went to see them in concert in October.  I love their music.  I love the energy on stage.  It's amazing.  Currently I am reading their biography, "Walk This Way".  It is very good.  I highly recomend it. I've missed catching my favorite guy friend on-line for the last couple of days.  I know about when he usually gets on, but that has been coresponding with times my mom wants to use her computer lately.  Ah, well.  I'm trying to figure out when I can get her to let me borrow her car so I can go to Cruses and see Luna and her little ones.  I miss them.  They are the funniest bunch of kiddos.  Ari loves the world.  Donovan is a real sweetie.  Have you noticed that the older you get the more you start calling your friends "honey" and "sweetie"?  Why is that?  Is it just that we've gotten over all our hang-ups and realize that it's okay to tell people how you feel?  When we were younger, we never told each other "I love you."  It was like we were afraid we would take it the wrong way.  Now we say it all the time with the perfect understanding that it means "I love you."  Now it's okay to admit we love our friends.  I think that's important.  To tell each other we love each other.

      I had a really nice chat ;) with one of my guy friends on AIM the for the 4th of July. It's funny when you reconnect with an old friend and he's become what you thought he was always just joking about being.  Apparently from my parents house I have a lot harder time updating.  Mostly because their computer is in the living room and I don't like it when people walk by.  The sibs tend to try and read whatever I'm working on without realizing it might be private.  I am so glad I have my own place, even though I have to share it with a roomate.  I'd rather have a husband and family of my own, but this was the hand I was delt and I guess I just have to live with it. The ex e-mailed me today a short note to ask how our little one is doing.  I thought about e-mailing him back with, "If you want to know, get off your lazy ass and call her." but I refrained.  I don't mind him so much, other than the fact that nothing can make him happy and he's always gripping.  It's the new wife I hate.  Damn bitch.

      I have been obsessing about sex all week.  Damn am I in need.  It's been over a year and a half since the last time and my next prospective isn't until maybe September.  When you get it all the time you don't know how bad it is to want it.  When your a virgin you don't know what your missing.  So all I can think about is how much I want.   I don't know what else to say.  All I'm thinking about is sex.

      Just a quick "yippie someone acctually reads this!"&nbsp; Because Night-Marilyn Fire at (possibly, I am just guessing here)  urlLink www.redleavesforest.blogspot.com &nbsp;left me a comment.&nbsp; It's nice to know that someone out there is reading and I'm not just sending this out in to the void. Good night sweet void.&nbsp; I'm going to bed.

      I just have to wonder what possesed me to come see my parents for the entire month of July.&nbsp; I am at the point that I don't know if I want to come back here next summer at all.&nbsp; I'm thinking of working next summer just so I don't have to.&nbsp; My mom's kids are a mess.&nbsp; Well, not the youngest, Nick's a good kid.&nbsp; Chris I just want to disown.&nbsp; She's been a total bitch, worse now that she 18, but acts twelve.&nbsp; I'm just tired of all the drama.&nbsp; What's the point anyway?&nbsp; In Sept. she's planning on moving to the same apartment complex as me.&nbsp; I'll bet five bucks she's knocked up before Christmas.&nbsp; I'm just sick of all the bullshit.&nbsp; Well, one more week here and then we're headed to Wy to see my older sister.&nbsp; The I have to take the little one back to her dad's and a couple of more weeks until work starts up again.&nbsp;  One last comment:&nbsp; My dad has got to learn that his brats aren't going to straighten up if he doesn't follow thru with mom's threats.

      After a long day at work I'm chilling out listing to George Carlin.  He is histerical.  There's nothing like a good comedian to make your day better.  I'm feeling good. "It looks like... MEAT CAKE."  "Well, smell it." "It has no smell whatsoever" "It's good, put it back."-  George Carlin Tomarrow is another road trip.  This is a good one though.  Me and my roomate are going to see some friends. I am just wondering if anyone out there reads this.  And if you do have you noticed my title entries? I really have nothing to say except: Kumkwat.

      I'm finally back home.  After seven weeks of travel I am back in my own little apartment.  The little one is back with her dad, so now I'm having a nice alcholic smoothie.  I don't drink when the little one is around so it's been about two months since the last time I had one. Travel can be terrible but occasionaly inspiring.  Like having a new title for a story pop in your head because you've finally been able to sit and not think about anything else. This weekend is my sister's babyshower.  This is her third and suposedly last child.  I am excited about this one, because now we live so much closer.   I feel like I can be more of a part of the whole thing.  It's nice to plan for a little one. We didn't plan for my little one.  It was very much a let's not talk about it thing.  I'm having a hard time tonight.  It's an adjustment.  I don't like having my world changed.  Now I just don't want to think for a while.
