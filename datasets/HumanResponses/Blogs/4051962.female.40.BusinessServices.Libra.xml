						   I am constantly dumbfounded by people who don't celebrate birthdays.&nbsp; And I don't mean those who have a hard time with getting older, who say they're 29 when really they're 54.&nbsp; Those we'll talk about later.&nbsp; I mean anyone, everyone who thinks birthdays are a waste of time.&nbsp; My fundamental question is, why would you not take any opportunity to celebrate, even if it is celebrating yourself?&nbsp; Why aren't we&nbsp;celebrating ourselves especially?  It was my husband's birthday yesterday.&nbsp; He did not grow up celebrating his birthday.&nbsp; He came from a family with 10 kids, and I guess there wasn't a lot of time or money to acknowledge birthdays.&nbsp; We met on his 40th birthday and, even if I say so myself, I did teach him a thing or two about celebrating birthdays that night.&nbsp; Yesterday was his 41st birthday, and although he feigned not wanting a birthday party, I think he really did have fun.&nbsp; At least that's what he said.  And then there are my brother- and sister-in-law.&nbsp; Two more who do not celebrate their birthdays unless forced to.&nbsp; Again, these are cases where as children, they were not given many presents, and certainly not many (if any) that met their heart's desire.&nbsp; No favorite meal at supper.&nbsp; No signs hanging on the garage.&nbsp; No visiting a local restaurant for the Birthday Club.&nbsp; None of it.  As I'm sure you will learn if you read this blog in the future, I'm not a huge fan of the job my parents did overall, although I do believe they tried, possibly to the best of their ability.&nbsp; But one thing they definitely did right was birthdays.&nbsp; We always had presents on the kitchen table when we came down for breakfast in the morning, and we got to pick what we wanted for dinner (my sister went many years picking liver - I just shake my head), and when I was younger I was in the Howard Johnson Birthday Club for which they had to drive all the way to Oshkosh, and we had friend parties every other year, and every year grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles came over, and there was cake.&nbsp; Always my favorite kind, whatever&nbsp;it was that year, even though my mom's favorite kind was angel food.&nbsp; She would try and bribe me to choose&nbsp;angel food cake&nbsp;every year, and I never did because I hate angel food cake.  And now, I do the same for my kids, because it's important for them to celebrate them.&nbsp; It's important for them to see other people celebrating them.&nbsp; It's the one day each year that is all their own, even though millions of other people have birthdays on that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal&nbsp;is to make them feel like their birthday is the only one; to let them know that, on this day, they were born and it changed my life in amazing ways forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;
