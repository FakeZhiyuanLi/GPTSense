       Sweet merciful crap. According to this bullshit quiz, I'm  The Fellowship of the Ring . Well, shit, if that's all applying to law school, 1L, 2L, 3L, the summers, and finding a job is going to be like...         You're  The Fellowship of the Ring !   by J.R.R. Tolkien     Facing great adversity, you have decided that your only choice is to unite with your friends and neighbors. You have been subject to a ton of squabbling and ultimately decided that someone humble is your best candidate for a dangerous mission. You're quite good with languages and convinced that not all who wander are lost. If you see anyone in black robes on horseback, just run. That's just common sense.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

       Well, I'm now halfway through my Cracking the LSAT book. I gotta say, I'm pretty proud of myself so far for actually buckling down and studying regularly. I've developed the somewhat bad habit of getting by without a lot of work throughout most of my academic career.  Yes, I was  that  student. You know the one. Never does the reading, always gets a good grade. Shows up late to the final, leaves before everybody else. I turned into such a slacker by the end of college--during my senior year, I actually went out of my way to see how little work I could do in a class and still get an A. (The answer, btw, was: very little work.) I know, it's not a very likeable trait, and I know, I'm a bastard. So for that I'm sorry.  But this brings me back to my initial point--I've been working hard on this, and enjoying it. I love to complain about standardized tests, but I think deep down, I have sort of a crush on them. Maybe it's just some bizarre fascination with filling out bubbles or a special fondness for the #2 pencil, but I tend to enjoy the process of test taking. Does that make me some kind of deviant?  The games are getting easier already and it's only been 3 days of really working them. Admittedly, I think the examples in the Princeton Review book are somewhat easier than the real test. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out when I take the first of the real LSATs I ordered from lsac.org, which will probably be about a week and a half from now. If I can pull a 165, I'll be happy.  It's funny that when you announce you're going to law school, people suddenly come out of the woodwork with offers of information or advice of how to go about doing it.  My family had always been behind my career as an actor. I didn't come from one of those families whose parents are always urging them to be a doctor or a lawyer, where the thought of a child pursuing a career in the arts sends them into hysterics. No, my family was always very encouraging. Partly, I think, because so many others in my family have worked in entertainment, and partly because they know you have to make your own discoveries about what you want to do with yourself. Anyhow, they were always all behind my career choice. And then I announce I'm going to law school.  And out of nowhere, everybody is throwing their hands in the year, rejoicing. "Thank God!" "Oh, what a wonderful piece of news!"  I mean, I can understand why and everything. But still.

       It's been a long weekend but it's going to end too quickly, per the usual. I still have these damn LSAT logic games running through my head. Started studying for them yesterday and, my god, are they going to be a pain in the ass. A lot of very thorough diagramming and transferring information around from words to symbols back to words. It's very similar to those matrix problems you used to get in like 4th grade (possibly copied onto that ditto paper with the purple ink that smelled like....I'm not even sure what it smelled like but it wasn't good) where you'd have to take all the information and x out parts of a grid as you made inferences and deductions. Only instead of the 30 minutes you'd have for one of these in 4th grade, you have about a minute and a half, if that. Good times.  But the weekend has been good. Went to the Air & Water Show yetserday and saw the Blue Angels, which was cool, but was so obviously a heavy handed marketing ploy on the military as well. I swear, every where I go these days I see Marines or Navy or Amry guys passing out flyers. I got one recruitment mailer the other day that invited me to sign up and receive a free commuter mug! Awesome! You mean, I can go shoot some brown folk  AND get a free commuter mug???  Isn't that what makes this country great?  Went to the Red Sox game after work on Friday, sort of on a whim. I find I really enjoy going to games by myself, even though that sounds sort of lame when you write it down in a blog. But I do.  urlLink Comiskey 's a fun place to see a game because the fans there  know  baseball. Wrigley Field, while more historic certainly (and fun in its own way) is more of a social scene than anything else. Plus you have to worry about things like  urlLink this . But the game was a lot of fun, saw Manny hit a grand slam and the Sox (of course I mean Red and not White) won 10-1.  It was equally hilarious after the game, because all us Red Sox fans left immediately (and there were  many ) while the White Sox fans stayed to watch the post-game fireworks. The platform at the Sox-35th L stop was a sea of Curt Schilling jerseys and red caps. As we all piled onto the cars, it felt a lot like squeezing onto the Green Line outside Fenway. People were laughing and joking around, saying things like, "This train goes to Alewife, right?" and of course the ever-hilarious, "Wicked pissah."

       So...reading over my first post it occurs to me that 'soul-sucking' isn't quite the right adjective to properly describe my job.  It's not soul sucking....it just sucks.  I moved to Chicago two years ago because of the theatre scene here. It's a great town to show up in with little or no professional acting experience and begin building a resume. Unfortunately, it's also not a town where you have a chance of subsiding on acting alone--you  need  a day job. And that's how I fell into my job. I'm an admin at a consulting firm. This was fine when I was pursuing acting. It's a great job when you can say to yourself, "I'm only here because I have to do this in order to something I love." But when that something else is no longer there....well, it's become pretty clear that I need to get out.  I think it confuses some of the higher-ups here that I'm clearly educated, intelligent, and overqualified for this job...and also the only male of the group of assistants. Not that that last part should matter to anyone--it certainly doesn't to me--but I'm pretty sure that there are some here who find it, well, a little odd.  But the good thing about hating your job is that it fuels you to find something better to do in its place. I've been mulling this over for a long time, and law school seems to be the right direction for me. I wish I had gotten started earlier with this whole process though. In order for me to apply for the 2005-06 academic year, I need to master the LSAT, get my recommendation letters, fill out all the applications (and pay for them, yikes), and have everything ready and complete before Thanksgiving in order to have the best shot. I've been studying for the LSAT for the last week now, and I seem to have a fairly intuitive grasp of the test. I took a practice test about a week ago, and scored considerably higher than I thought I would on a first try. I'm stil going to bust my ass to improve the score, but I'm in better initial shape than I at first thought possible.  It's going to be a hectic year...

       So it has come to this. Almost unwittingly, here I am, in control of my very own blog. As early as this morning, I would not have guessed that I would find myself at the helm of one of these. Shows how much one can know in advance about the course of a given day, I suppose. Either that, or it shows I have no attention span and sometimes behave impulsively. Take your pick.  Regardless of how I ended up here, here I am, and for better or for worse I am here to stay. Allow me, then, to divulge some statement of purpose for my newly born blog, Comma Comma Semi-Colon (or ,,; for brevity's sake). I  I have set out to accomplish a number of tasks with this column. First, as I have recently decided to puruse a legal education, I hope to document, as faithfully as possible, my experiences throughout what will likely be a long journey. My decision to pursue a career in law has arisen out of what I think are fairly unusual circumstances, (which I'll be happy to discuss later for those who might be interested) but I think the overall experience is universal, and worth sharing. I also hope I can provide some enlightening social commentary while I'm at it. Preferably on the witty side.  I intend to kill as much time as possible at my soul-sucking job. If you are a co-worker, please pretend you didn't just read that.  I will no doubt use this column to partake in that special brand of fatalism that only Red Sox fans can truly understand. I speak of course, of the unique ability to remain blindly optimistic while simultaneously resolved to miserable failure. To quote one of my new favorite pop culture savants,  urlLink Chuck Klostermann :      When the BoSox got beat by the Yankees last fall, my friend Michael lost his mind and wandered the streets of Manhattan for several hours. When he finally returned from his exodus, he very casually said, "I'm fine. It's OK. I just understand things now. This is just proof than there is no higher power, and that goodness will never overcome evil, and that there is no valid reason to believe in anything, because the universe craves darkness and despises light. So, I'm totally OK." I found this sentiment somewhat troubling. What I love about Red Sox fans is their sense of doomed destiny; they almost want to lose, because that failure is romantic. This is far different from, say, Minnesota Vikings fans, as they always believe -- and I mean always -- that this is the year. And it never is, and it never will be.     In the near future, you can expect a few things from ,,; - a little more information about me, my background, what I hope to achieve, goals, aspirations etc. This will likely turn into a bit of a blawg and not merely a blog. For those of you unfamiliar with the word 'blawg,' I have a  urlLink link for you . I will also likely publish a treatise in which I codify exactly how I will use punctuation in and around the abbreviated form of this column's title, as, clearly, that can get a little awkward.  But seriously, I've never written on a regular basis before. Hopefully this will be more successful than any number of journals that sit in stasis on my bookshelf with one glorious entry on their first page and nothing on the rest.  On that note, I will end this first post with a little information regarding the name of this column. Up until quite recently, I was an actor. In school, while studying the Folio technique of approaching Shakespearean verse, we learned about the importance of punctuation in the text, and how you should pay close attention to every full stop, comma, colon, and  especially the semi-colon.  The punctuation acts as a kind of emotional road map--every comma winding the tension higher, every full stop releasing it. The real kicker however, is the semi-colon. This is by far the most intriguing of the punctuating symbols, and requires the most serious attention. For the semi-colon represents a  major shift  in emotion, a cataclysmic event culminating in total release of control often followed by wild and reckless emotional abandon. So, as you read the title of my column, inwardly at least, you can imagine a steady build, a push, like the feeling you get when chaotic thoughts start building in your relatively quiet mind late at night, onward and upward, growing louder, stronger and more frenetic with each comma, until finally, when you think you can't possibly withstand it any longer, all of a sudden the fog clears, the heavens open up, the sun comes out, and you tilt back your head and scream with unbridled joy -- SEMI-COLON!!  Well, that, and it happened to be the first thing that popped in my head. I'm not sure I'll keep it, really.
