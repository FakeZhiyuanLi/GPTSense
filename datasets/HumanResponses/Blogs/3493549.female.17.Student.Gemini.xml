      im such a  couch potato ..i get 2 weeks break from a hectic college schedule and what do i do? Sit around watching every programme shown on tv when i know i should be catching up on homework, assignments and such...well, i will..i made a promise to myself and im gonna keep it..lol...but its just so much fun hanging around, no worries bout exams and deadlines, and just such...relaxation..i know after this holiday im gonna be all stressed up till my hair all turn grey so i might as well enjoy my freedom while i can..and oh yeah, after this, god knows when im bloggering again  im so totally confused now, i have no idea what 2 study next year, where to go etc.  if there's totally no barrier (no financial problems, distance bla bla) then i would luv to go to the U S of A. but *sigh* .. that's near impossible right now. so, everyone's kinda looking down under. well, i can accept that..Oz isn't too bad..so many ppl are there, my bro and his pals ( who are kinda my pals too ) , Haley, and hopefully Eelynn decides to go there..haha , i still remember we were making all these big plans bout going 2 America and living together and when our parents came to visit we could just sorta chuck em 2gether..*sigh*  doubt i'll want 2 go next year though, probably stay a year here, can save some $$  (what am i talking about? i can save  loads  of cash! ) .. oh and also, im gonna miss lotz of cool peeps here! my fam , friends and a special somebody *ahem*  somehow i dun wanna go where my bro is, i mean, it'll be nice if he's so close by but then, its like, "DUde, where's my freedom?" , u know what i mean..  i was just thinking bout last year, and i was so hoping i could go to Hawaii or California .. and then i find out JPL is from Rexburg, Idaho...and it's like OH-KAY..haha

      woohoo new blogger! Lol...anywayz decided to shift from xanga.com to here, guess im bit sick of that site -)   am feeling high now listening to Kelly Clarkson's Before Your Love .. something bout this song just makes me feel so..ecstatic in a way..its a powerful song, oh well, should i get her album? Gosh, there's so many i wanna get right now, but Kelly is definitely somewhere at the top of the "CD's to get" list   speaking of which, well, dun get me wrong, i dun have anything against Fantasia winning American Idol 3..but i dun see how her style, which is gospel-like, will make it in the charts, save for the fact that she won American Idol, that is. I was actually rooting for Diana, she would have been great in the charts..which is proven already on Amazon.com where Diana is at 4th and Fantasia 5th. i think Diana will outsell Tasia. Not like im planning to get any of their albums though, but if Diana comes out with a mind-blowing song (in Randy's words - "WOW"), then i might consider cuz no doubt she has an awesome voice.   Im still bitter JPL left so early on in the competition. He was like the underdawg, dude ! I raise both my hands and agree that he does not have what it takes 2 win, but hey, he is the dark horse anyway, right? Give him a chance! Ok, i m truly bias to JPL (not to mention utterlly hopelessly into him) hahah! I just feel it unfair when he bounced back from 2 episodes where he did not sing well, and came back with a startling performance of Jailhouse Rock, only to get the boot, when it was clear that Redhead John Stevens was worse than Penpal Jon Peter Lewis. That was totally uncalled for. Now, i can only reminisce the good times of JPL, when he sang Tiny Dancer, Little Less Conversation, Drift Away, She Believes in Me ( SWOON! ) , Jailhouse Rock.   At least i'll get to see him one last time in the Finale, which is like weeks away for StarWorld viewers like yours truly. Bleh . I caught some photos of him on the Net performing during the finale and the redcarpet show. Drop dead Gorgeous if you ask me. and totally clownish prancing around on stage in some yellow t-shirt and white jacket enhanced by black stripes running down the sides of it. and i just noticed, man he's short! =') makes him all the more adorable.

      ESL Research Study is finally over. I handed up the bulk of it today, and it felt as though a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders. Although, I felt a sense of loss as well, I guess  I got really attached to it, having spent sleepless nights and troubled days doing it. I wonder how much accumulated hours of effort I put in? A hundred?  Anyway, the past week seems to have passed by rather quickly. I got my license on Saturday, and I've been driving on and off this few days, just small errands. My parents still do not allow me to drive to college, even with them around. So I guess it will be a long time before I can drive by myself. Sobz.   I'm rather tired now, and hungry as well, so I'm off to recharge myself..

      Finally I've got my Internet connection back. What a relief. I must say, I can't survive without it. All those times I needed the Net for research, to await mails and simply to chat with friends. I miss coming here too; there were so many things I needed to say here.   I passed my driving test on Monday and the feeling was just so awesome. To finally get past that 'hurdle'...phew. Anyway, I was there with Shaun and Christobel and we met a couple of people there as well. Mostly their friends, so it was a bit awkward for me at first. I got to know this girl with a really unique accent, Emily, and this cute Norwegian guy, Kristien (I think that's how his name is spelt). Well, all of us passed except Christobel. She couldn't get past the slope, which was kinda scary. When it was Shaun and my turn, we were really freaked out. And it was raining and we were like the last ones to do the slope. Thankfully, all went well. Phew. Now, I await my license in silence. haha. Oh, Shaun is cute too. Not those typical cute guy, but cute nevertheless. I guess it's cuz he's always kidding around and being really nice and friendly.   My results arrived yesterday - exactly the same as 1st semester. -_- . I nearly got the perfect score I so crave for for Physics but it was not to be. I missed but a few decimal points. What in the world? I'll get my revenge this semester. Haha. And I also wanna make my Chem teacher proud. I don't know why. I just have to do really well for CHemistry. After all, isn't it my favourite subject? Also, maths. I can't let her down. Groanz. All the pressure.

      For the second night in a row, I had nightmares and woke up in the middle of the dark night in hot sweat. I wonder if it's trying to tell me something? *ponders* . Last night, I dreamt about this chair in my room which started moving by itself and I tried to scream but my throat felt so constricted. When I tried to run away from the 'ghost' chair, it was as though somebody had tied me to the bed. *shudders* There's something about these nightmares; they leave you feeling all helpless and that really sucks. Now I don't feel like going to bed tonight, I'll just toss and turn all night anyway. I've been having problems sleeping since I was young and my friend calls me an insomniac. I'm not too sure if that's true though. Sigh...   Wk came over today and Jay, Wk and I played Monopoly. Jay was the big winner and Wk was in debt about $7000 over. Lol. It was really fun and at least I wasn't losing, ha-ha. I actually invited Wk over to study but well, let's just say we got carried away. Firstly, we talked for more than an hour and then decided to leave our physics and bio behind and play Monopoly. The tough part was waking Jay up. hehe. Anyway I had to leave the game early so all my properties and cash was inherited by Wk while I went off for yet another driving lesson. I spent an hour driving around the driving range all my by myself while the instructor went off, probably for dinner or to smoke. It was fun the first few rounds but after that, I was bored and since he was nowhere in sight, I started speeding..well, just a little bit *grinz*. Then, the instructor let me drive home and it was the first time I drove on the road. Pretty fun actually. The only thing is everytime I look at the side mirror, cars behind me are signalling to get out of my lane. Well, don't blame me! I was only going at 60kmph! lol!

      Yay! I had my first driving lesson today and it's actually pretty fun. I thought it was going to be hard but it was alright really. At first I felt a little awkward, I was not used to the clutch and the balancing with the accelerator. Yeah, but I got the hang of it after I have no idea how many times the instructor made me do it. Oh and another thing. This instructor taught my bro 4 years ago which is pretty cool. For an old man he's got pretty darn good memory, even remembered how he looked like and that he liked to drive fast. Uhm, well, that's a problem for me too coz everytime i hit the accelerator, I just totally  hit  it you know? The instructor was all like, just tap it. oh well. My holidays are nearly over, so I kind of have to rush the lessons a bit and so we arranged classes for everyday this week except thursday. He's gonna let me take the car out to the road tomorrow. Way cool! Lol. I really can't wait to get my license and drive to college and everywhere. Ha-ha. That's if Mom and Dad get me a car in the first place. -)  I'm so jealous of Wk. He got the JPA scholarship which covers  everything . Every single damn thing down to his last pencil. How unfair is that? I really wanted it too but I did not apply for it. How dumb can I get?? I still kick myself over the head until today. So, Wk has been posted to Australia for engineering and meanwhile they want him to do his A-Levels at Taylor's still. Not that bad since he's already here at Taylor's. I envy him so! Real lucky fella. I would give an arm and leg to go to USA, figuratively speaking.

      Do you ever feel that you just wanna disappear from the world? Just to escape from everyone and everything and hide away by yourself. That's how I feel sometimes; that I wanna just fly away and do nothing or start a new life somewhere far far away. Sometimes, you just don't want to face things you inevitably have to face sooner or later. It's not like facing your fears, just some things you rather not dwelve into. Or some people you just do not want to face, people who misunderstand you, who misjudge you or who just love making your life a living hell. People you thought cared but then the moment you turn your back, they will be sticking daggers into you. People who are two-faced, acting so sweet in front of you but you never know what they're saying to others when you're not around. Then there are those who have single-handedly mastered the skill of sweet-talking, and you being the type who always believes everyone's an angel, fall for the sweet-talk. There are people who tell you they understand, care and love you but you never know, do you? It's very hard to trust people or see through their real intentions. You give them your trust and love but they abuse it or they do not return it. In the end, you realize you have to watch your own back and just wishing you could disappear from the world.

      I feel so exhausted and itching to shut off and go to dreamland but yet, I can't sleep. I'm just too restless now and I have a bad feeling that I'm falling sick - shivering and hot all over, sounds like fever, doesn't it?   This pig woke up past 11am this morning and was pleasantly surprised to find everyone else gone. Apparently, they couldn't wait for me to wake up to make plans for the day. Can't blame them though =)  Anyway, lunch was awesome. Mom and I went to Woods, and ordered so much that by the time we're done, well, let 's just say we were really stuffed. Not many people go there even though I absolutely love the food there. Only those who are vegetarians, weigh-watchers and health-conscious ones do. OH, and lots of medical people like doctors and such eat there too. Well, I am there cuz I like food bland (or untasty).. no sugar, salt, seasoning...blabla..Most people think Im crazy but that's my preference. Food  au naturale  is the best. That doesn't mean I do not like chocolates or ice-cream, ha-ha.  The whole afternoon was spent in 1U, yes, that's my second home lol. I swear, the whole of KL were there and the place was just packed wall to wall!! I couldn't even do my shopping in peace and pretty soon I developed a nasty headache from the lack of oxygen. Pretty sad outcome too - I didn't get anything! There was this beautiful black dress in Rest&Relax which made me look like a mermaid and it was 50% off and I was tempted to get it but then I thought, when will I wear it? Prom? That's lightyears away and besides, I wanna wear something purply to Prom, not black.   We decided on Kogetsu on lunch tomorrow so dinner tonight was really light. We had mamak at Munis and of all luck, we were 'served' by a really dumb waiter who messed up our order. My dinner came in the form of some cheese or butter naan when I had clearly stated plain naan, so we had to send it back and I was so hungry at that time already and practically downed my gallon of Mango Special. Well, don't blame me for getting all bloated later. haha.   I just realized something. Cole hasn't called yet today and I didn't hear from him. Unless, of course, you count the sms asking me to watch mtv cuz Jake Gylenhaal was on but, really. This is starting to become..a routine. I mean, when I tell him about it, like I wanna hear from him everyday, then it'll be alright for a while. But then after a few weeks, he does it again. I dunno if he's trying to tell me that I need to remind him every few weeks. Frankly, this is  bullshit . You don't need reminding for this kind of things, do you? *shakes head* I just can't believe it. The last time this happened a few weeks ago, he told me that if I do not call him by the end of the day, then he will call me. Did he tonight? No. And to add salt to the wound, today's our 3-month anniversary. How could he do this to me on our anniversary?? I don't get it. Think I'll go bawl out my eyes now. Yeah right. Guys are not worth our tears and I won't be taken for granted anymore.

      I watched  Shrek 2  yesterday and sadly, I came out of the cinema  disappointed . I somehow expected more since everyone's been going on about it and there's all this hype about it. Moreover, the first installment was rockin'. Oh well.  Anyway, I was there at 1u with WK and Jay and it wasn't a really fun afternoon anyway. I mean, I didn't really wanna go out with WK but since he kept asking and asking, I thought I might just go out with him once and then maybe he'll stop asking. It's pretty weird with him now cuz though he knows that I don't like him and doubt I'll ever do, he acts so indifferent and is still hanging around everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for being just friends but at times I feel he's just too much. Perhaps even crossing certain boundaries, if I must say so myself. He still sends me home everyday, and I do get afraid sometimes cuz he's such an emotional person and I can't read his mind and dunno what he's thinking. So, I do get scared in the car when he gets angry and loses control. Freaky? On the other hand, I think he's a sweet guy though, I really do. I mean, he's probably the most caring friend I have. Is there such a thing as being overcaring? That's how i feel he is sometimes, which can be a little bit annoying.  Anyway, I am glad Jay came along cuz he kept WK busy talking and I just had to act discreet and keep quiet. We had lunch at 3:30 at Waffle World which is a yummy place to eat. I lurve that place, though I am getting a teensy weensy bit tired of waffles and pancakes. Lol.   While I was queuing up for tickets for SHrek, I managed to snag 3 tickets for today's Harry Potter premiere. You wouldn't believe the queue and the amount of people there. They looked like ants lining up for sugar blocks or something. I just stood in the line for an hour and by then I was already exhausted. Yeah, standing up and moving once in a while is soo tiring. No, actually, I don't fancy being stuck in crowds stuffy and suffocated. It makes me really irritated and I'll snap at you...j/k.   I was all geared up for a party (not really) today. Harry Potter only comes to town once a year right? I really looked forward to today's show and  *sigh*  once more, I was let down. It makes me wonder if I'm losing the thrill for movies. Now, Harry Potter wasn't bad or terrible but it wasn't good either. This is the third HP movie and I guess it's true what  Simon Cowell  said about third installments - they are usually not brilliant and just no good. Well, I agree with Simon. Perhaps I had too high expectations cuz I really thought this will be good. After all, the first two were pretty good and it can only get better right? I'll tell you what went wrong here. It was too  boring . I did not feel the suspense or the intensity as was evident in The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. This was like a kid show. Everything was so basic and simple. The acting was good although I have to mention that the 'new'  Dumbledore  just didn't live up to the billing. If I must say, in this movie, Dumbledore was  cheesy . If I am not mistaken, it's not Richard Harris in the part of the principal of Hogwarts since he passed on last year. Well, hats off to him; he's greatly missed. He's not the only part changed I hear. Peter Jackson (is that his name?) has been replaced too, by some Mexican fella, I think. That's what went wrong. You can't just change directors like that, especially not for a multimillion bucks project as famous as Harry Potter. Everyone's gonna have expectations and you either live up to these expectations or you crash big time. I vote for crash boom bang this time.  I just don't get why he has to be replaced. I wasn't following this in the media so I have no idea what exactly what went on. But I am  sad . I really hope the Goblet of Fire will be good and go back to its former HP glory.   Anywayz, after the movie, Ken and Jay were disappointed too. We went to Secret Recipe and Ken paid for the whole meal. I felt really guilty and like, something's not right. I was insisting that we pay our share but he will not hear of it, so I did not get up from my seat. Ha-ha. I was like "No I'm not gonna budge." so he came over and tried to pull me out of the chair but of course I was being stubborn. I just didn't want him to waste his money although he's being such a gentleman. So in the end, we struck a  deal . Next week, the meal is on me and I hope he doesn't forget it. I feel sorry for Ken as he had to pay for Jay - he has such a ferocious appetite and eats twice as much as the next person *sigh*

      Top 5 reasons why you should never run out in the middle of a shower to answer a ringing phone ( even though your boyfriend is on the line ):  5. In your haste to answer the phone, you have water in your eyes and you can't see clearly. Therefore, as you try as fast as you can to turn off the water, you accidentally touch the  HOT  knob and without realizing, you on it bigger and get scalded by  burning  water.  4. Getting all worked up because the phone is ringing, you grab your favourite towel wrap it around yourself - only to remember that you still had soap all over your body and now your towel is soap-laden.  3. Because the phone would most likely have stopped ringing by the time you get out.  2. You manage to answer the phone alright, but then realize that you still had shampoo and conditioner in your hair, and now they are dripping onto your assignments which you painstakingly took 8 hours to complete and had placed them next to the phone.  And the  number one  reason why you should never, ever run out of the shower to get the phone?  1. You are in such a hurry that when you wrap the towel around yourself and dash out the bathroom without really looking. Next thing you know, you tripped over the long telephone wire, the telephone crashes to the floor (and stops ringing) and your bath towel falls to the ground. Then you realize that you did not shut your windows and you are now standing fully  naked  for all glory to see.

      Yesterday, I thought life was boring. Today, however, work seems endless. After completing one thing, there is another and it seems like there is no end to this work-cycle. I thought I might take it easy and slow down cuz there's like 2 weeks of college break. Looks like that won't be the case now.  As usual, i spent my morning glued to the TV watching Beastmaster and Punk'd. I am beginning to get a little hooked on Beastmaster, which I only started watching yesterday. It chronicles the life of this male Xena, Dar, who goes around saving everything from humans, animals to the supernaturals (Read: Centaurs). Basically, that man is a typical  hero  with a loyal sidekick, Tao and all these animals he can communicate with - ferets, tiger and an eagle. Now, I kind of like the character Tao, as he is an Asian amongst the Americans and he gave up love (with this girl  Caro ) to remain with Dar, which I think is really heroic in a strange way.  I kickstarted my afternoon with journal writing for my Research Study, which wasn't too bad. Next came a tough part where I had to analyse the feedback from the questionnaires i handed out the last 2 months. Being a total klutz with the computer but eager to learn, I soon discovered that drawing pie charts and columns ain't that easy after all. Or maybe it's just me. But whatever, i'll leave it to Jay to come to my rescue as usual. By then, I was already on to a new task - transcribing the tape interview with dr. Robin Mitra. Piece of cake, that's what I thought. Once again, I was wrong. First, my stereo isn't right next to my computer. So I had to play-stop-run to the computer-type-run back to the stereo- and because I have no idea why everytime I stop the tape and play it again, it automatically fast forwards a few seconds, I have to keep rewinding it. After an hour, I was  drained . Imagine my sheer frustration when I looked at the screen to see how far I have gone, it barely filled one page. ERGH! And apparently, I had only transcribed some 15% of the interview. This is going to take a long time. *sigh*  The bottom line is, life can get pretty interesting when you have 'nothing to do,'

      The day started a bit slow. Got up lazily at 9 and went down for breakfast of mango and bars. Then, I spent an hour reading the papers. Sunday papers are the best, there is so much to read and I love how they separate it into different sections. I always read them in the same order; Sports, Variety, Star Mag, Education, Fit for Life, then the main paper. I'm so thrilled Maria Sharapova won at Wimbledon this year, I was just waiting for someone to dethrone Serena Williams. I mean, hello?? Give someone else a chance. Maria is one tough chick, and she's only 17. *whistles* I'm pretty amused by her screams on court.   Tonight, or should I say, tomorrow morning, is the final of Euro 2004. It's between Greece and Portugal. I'm banking on  Greece  to lift the title. They're the underdogs here, and I've gotten over them beating beloved  Spain . Also, Portugal are the hosts, so they have a certain advantage, so that's kinda unfair right??   Other Sports news, Alonso is in pole position for today's race! Yay! Go Renault!   Anyway, I watched  Malaysian Idol  today. I dunno whether to be amused or embarrased by some of the contestants. Caught a glimpse of my friend Shih-Ying on tv, wonder if she made it? There was this guy who really sucked, Kenny I think that's his name, he was in Penang when he sang To Where You Are by Josh Groban. He sucked still today, he's so gay. Yuckz. Pukez. There was one girl who was pretty good, she was beautiful too, and another who sounded like Fantasia.   Lunch today was awesome, went to my fave eatery, Woods, for a healthy, organic, microbiotic meal of spinach pasta in soy dressing. Haha. I know it sounds awful right? Well, to those who are not used it anyway. But once you acquire the taste for this kind of cuisine, it's really delicious. Plus, it's healthy. Not much sin there. Lol.   I'm really exhausted chasing the baby around. Oh gosh. If only he can be still for one second, that's all I'm asking for. Sigh. Am actually glad he's going back tonight. I dunno how much more of this babysitting I can stand. I haven't been able to get much work done, only did some maths and attempted to do LAN project. Oh well.   I've been trying my best to change For things to go back to the way they were But we both know better That we're almost over this time We try to fight it, we try to defy it I have a feeling it's too late  How do we turn back time? When your heart isn't next to mine anymore? What are we trying to prove? When there's nothing we can do No, we're running out of time  Maybe we've grown aprat We try but we're going separate ways It's like you've changed And I'm surprised that I have too   We try to fight it, we try to defy it We both know that it's too late  How do we turn back time? When your heart isn't next to mine anymore What are we trying to prove? When there's nothing we can do No, we're running out of time
