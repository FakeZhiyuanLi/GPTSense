        첫째 컷: 자 이제 오디가 나와서 멍멍이 시를 낭송하겠습니다!   둘째 컷: 멍! 멍! 멍! (이하 생략)   셋째 컷: 멍! 멍……/ 이봐 리머릭 (아일랜드에서 기원한 5행 시) 은 안돼!   91. Hey! No Limericks!  베레모를 쓴 오디가 두꺼운 책까지 끼고 다소 거만해 보이는 표정으로 등장합니다. 딴에는 시를 읽는답시고 짖어대는 오디의 개소리 (?)가 다섯번째 행까지 이어지자 가필드가 갑자기 ``limerick’’은 안 된다며 주의를 주는군요. 이건 또 대체 무슨 소리일까요? 이 만화의 유머를 이해하기 위해서는 영시에 대한 약간의 배경 지식이 필요합니다.   시를 시답게 만드는 두 가지 중요한 요소는 운(rhyme)과 율 (meter) 입니다. 이 두 가지 개념을 통칭해서 시의 리듬 (rhythm) 이라고 하지요. 영시에서 운은 각 행 (line)의 맨 뒤에 위치하는데요 한편의 시에서 서로 다른 두 행의 마지막 모음이나 자음이 같거나 (look과 book, pearl과 girl처럼) 자, 모음이 완전히 일치하는 경우 두 행이 운을 이루고 있다고 말합니다. 율은 시어의 강, 약과 관련이 있지요.   영시에서는 이러한 요소들의 규칙적 패턴, 그리고 덧붙여 행 (line) 의 수에 따라 시의 종류를 구분한답니다. 대표적인 것이 셰익스피어를 통해 잘 알려진 소네트인데요 소네트는 14행으로 되어있고 네 개의 행으로 된 3개의 연 (stanza) 과 두개의 행으로 된 마지막 연으로 이루어져 있습니다.   가필드가 이야기하는 리메릭 (limerick)도 이러한 구분에 따른 영시의 한 종류입니다. 다섯줄로 되어있고 별 의미 없는 말장난을 담고 있는 것이 대부분이지요. 그런데 오디가 낭송하는 시(?)를 보니 도무지 무슨 내용인지, 어떤 리듬으로 읽는 시인지 아무것도 알 수 없게 되어있네요. (짖는 소리만 되풀이 되니까 운은 그런대로 잘 맞는군요)   그렇다면 도대체 가필드는 무얼 보고 리메릭 같이 가볍고 장난스러운 시는 이런 자리에 어울리지 않는다고 말한 걸까요? 그건 바로 오디의 멍멍 대는 소리가 다섯줄로 넘어갔기 때문이겠죠.   소네트가 주로 남녀간의 사랑을 노래하듯이 특정한 시의 형식은 특정한 종류의 내용을 담고 있는 경우가 많거든요. 리메릭의 경우는 앞서 이야기한 대로 말장난에 가까운 깊이 없는 내용이 주를 이루고 있답니다. 이해를 돕기 위해 작자 미상의 limerick poem을 하나 첨부합니다. 참고 하세요.   There was a little girl with curls 곱슬머리의 작은 소녀가 있었네   who felt like she was going to hurl 그녀는 금방 토할 것 같은 기분이었어  she got on the bus 버스에 오른 그녀는   and threw up on a kid named Gus 거스라는 아이에게 토해버렸지 (throw up=vomit)   that was the story of the little girl 이게 그 작은 소녀에 대한 이야기야   영미 문화를 이해하기 위해 모두가 문학을 전공자 수준으로 공부할 필요는 없을 겁니다. 하지만 소네트나 리메릭이 영시의 종류라는 것 정도는 알고 있으면 여러모로 쓸모가 많습니다. 즐거운 한 주 보내세요.

         첫째 컷: 뭘 좀 도와드릴까요? / 괜찮아요. 고맙습니다.  둘째 컷: 정말 아무것도 필요 없으세요?/ 말해봐요.   셋째 컷: 제 향수 때문인가요? 제가 매력적이라서? 남성다운 매력? 무엇 때문이죠?   넷째 컷: 무슨 말씀이시죠?/ 이봐요, 인정하세요. 저를 가만히 놓아두지 못하잖아요. 이유가 뭐죠?   다섯째 컷: 좋아요. 말씀 드리죠.   여섯째 컷: 당신의 말썽꾸러기 꼬마들이 계속 호출버튼을 눌러대고 있어요. / 적이 우리 영토에 침입했다. 보호막을 가동하라 오디 항해사!   90. In the Plane   존이 가필드와 오디를 데리고 휴가를 가나 봐요. 원래 애완동물을 비행기에 데리고 탈 수는 없게 되어있지만 만화니까 그러려니 하고 넘어가기로 하죠. 승무원이 두 번이나 계속 Jon에게 다가와 도움이 필요한지 물으니까 Jon의 중증 왕자병이 또 발동하기 시작합니다. 자기에게 관심이 있어서 그러려니 하고 느끼하게 작업을 걸어보는데요 알고 보니 가필드와 오디가 호출 버튼을 눌러대고 있었군요.   위의 그림에서 승무원이 지나다니는 통로는 aisle이라고 하지요 (s는 발음하지 않습니다). 극장이나 슈퍼마켓의 통로도 이렇게 부릅니다. 자연히 통로쪽 자리는 aisle seat, 창가쪽은 window sea, 가운데 자리는 middle seat이라고 하구요. 그림에서 존의 머리 위쪽의 짐을 놓아두는 선반은 overhead compartment 라고 부른답니다.   존과 이야기를 나누고 있는 여성은 잘 아시다시피 비행기의 여승무원입니다. 남녀평등이란 이슈가 언어 사용 패턴에도 영향을 미치면서 성별에 따라 다르게 쓰이거나 남성을 뜻하는 단어로 대표형을 갖는 단어는 중성형으로 많이 바뀌어지게 되었는데요 대표적인 것이 비행기 승무원을 뜻하는 stewardess (steward+여성형 접미사 “-ess”) 란 단어입니다. 요즘에는 stewardess 대신 남녀 승무원 공히 flight attendant라고 부르는 것이 더 보편적이지요. 같은 맥락에서 chairman (의장)은 chairperson, mailman (우편배달부) 은 mail carrier, policeman은 police officer 그리고 fireman은 fire fighter라고 부르는 것이 요즘의 추세랍니다. ‘man’은 남자를 뜻하는 단어니까요. 반대로 전업주부를 뜻하는 housewife대신 homemaker라는 중성형 단어가 점차 더 많이 쓰이고 있습니다. 가사일을 남편이 전담하지 말라는 법이 없잖아요?   “rugged good look”은 매력적인 터프가이의 모습을 나타내는 표현이에요.``big boy’’란 말도 성적 매력이 넘치는 섹시한 남성을 뜻하지만 여기에선 그런 착각에 빠져 있는 존을 비꼬는 뜻으로 사용한 것이죠. 마지막에 Garfield가 하는 말은 공상 과학영화의 장면을 흉내내고 있는 것이에요. 승무원 아가씨를 우주의 침입자로 보고 Odie에게 보호막 가동을 명령하네요. “Glurkon”이란 단어는 외계인 (Alien) 종족이름으로 Garfield가 만든 것으로 그 자체로는 아무 의미 없는 말입니다. 정말 못 말릴 개구쟁이 (brat) 들이죠?

        첫째 컷: 음……  둘째 컷: “전갈자리: 아주 가까운 미래에 여행 운이 있다.”   셋째 컷: 철썩   89. Horoscope   거미 한 마리가 줄을 타고 내려와 신문을 보고 있습니다. 뭘 보고있나 했더니 어느 신문에나 빠지지 않고 연재되는 “오늘의 운세를 보고 있었네요.” 운세에 여행하게 될 수라고 나와 들떠 있었을 거미. 그런데 그 여행이란 게 기껏 가필드에게 맞아 날아가는 거였군요. 그림을 보니 그래도 꽤 먼 거리를 여행하게 될 것 같죠?  우리나라 신문에도 출생 연도에 따른 12간지 (쥐, 소, 호랑이, 토끼……)로 매일의 운세를 보는 코너가 있듯이 서양에서는 태어난 때에 해당하는 별자리를 갖고 운세를 본답니다. 여기에 사용되는 12궁, 즉 열 두 별자리를 zodiac이라고 하고 이를 통해 운세나 사람의 성격 등을 점치는 것을 horoscope라 합니다. 우리식의 12간지는 통상 Chinese horoscope라고 부르지요. ``나는 뱀띠야.’’ 라고 하는데 ``I’m a snake belt.’’ 라고 하실 분은 안 계시겠죠? 그냥 ``I’m a snake.’’ 또는 ``I was born in the snake year.’’라고 하시면 됩니다.   위의 거미녀석은 전갈자리인가 봐요. 전갈은 원래 영어로 scorpion이지만 별자리이름으로 쓸 때는 라틴어로 쓴답니다. 12궁의 이름은 모두 그리스 신화에 그 뿌리를 두고 있는데요 전갈자리는 신화 속의 거인 오리온과 관련이 있습니다.   아르테미스 여신 (제우스와 레토의 딸, 아폴론의 쌍둥이 누이동생으로 사냥과 달의 여신임)과 사랑에 빠진 오리온이 자신의 힘을 과시하면서 다른 신들을 깔보고 다니자 헤라 (제우스의 아내)는 오만 방자한 거인을 벌하고자 전갈을 보내 그를 죽이게 하였습니다. 아무리 거대한 적이라도 물리칠 수 있었던 오리온이지만 작은 전갈은 미쳐 보지 못했던 것이죠. 그 후 전갈은 오리온을 죽인 공로로 하늘의 별자리가 되었고 역시 별자리가 된 오리온은 하늘에서도 전갈이 두려웠는지 전갈이 서쪽 하늘에 질 무렵에야 동쪽 하늘에 보이기 시작한답니다.   이유없이 거미를 학대하다니…… 가필드는 스파이더맨의 응징이 두렵지 않은가 보군요.  아래는 탄생 일에 따른 별자리입니다. 참고하세요. 게를 뜻하는 라틴어가 질병 암의 어원이 된 것은 의학의 아버지 히포크라테스가 살던 고대 그리스 시대로 알려져 있습니다. 암으로 인한 통증이 게가 무는 것처럼 심하기 때문이라고 하네요. 아무튼 건강한 여름 보내세요.   탄생 일 별 별자리  양자리 (Aries, 3월 21일-4월 20일)  황소자리 (Taurus, 4월 21일-5월 21일)  쌍둥이자리 (Gemini, 5월 2일-6월 22일)  게자리 (Cancer, 6월 23일-7월 23일) 사자자리 (Leo, 7월 24일-8월 23일)  처녀자리 (Virgo, 8월 24일-9월 23일) 천칭자리 (Libra, 9월 24일-10월 23일) 전갈자리 (Scorpio, 10월 24일-11월 22일)  궁수자리 (Sagittarius, 11월 23일-12월 22일) 염소자리 (Capricorn, 12월 23일-1월 19일) 물병자리 (Aquarius, 1월 20일-2월 19일)  물고기자리 (Pisces, 2월 20일-3월 20일)

      처리속도 1.6Gbpsㆍ전력소비 1.8V `GDDR' 부상  그동안 `집적도' 경쟁에 매진해온 D램 업계가 이제는 `데이터처리 속도'와 `저전력' 기술경쟁에 돌입하고 있다.  10일 양대 D램 업체인 삼성전자와 하이닉스반도체에 따르면 D램 수요처가 기존 PC 위주에서 모바일ㆍ디지털 컨슈머 기기들로 확대되는 추세에 맞춰 D램 기술전략이 고집적 일변도에서 고속ㆍ저전 력으로 방향전환이 빠르게 이뤄지고 있다.  이같은 변화는 `D램〓PC용 메모리'라는 등식이 무너지고 PC는 물론 게임기ㆍ셋톱박스ㆍDVD플레이어ㆍPDAㆍ디지털카메라ㆍ휴대폰ㆍ캠코더ㆍ카내비게이션ㆍ디지털TV등 다양한 제품에 D램 채택이 확산되고 있는 데 따른 것으로 풀이된다.  D램 비중이 절대적이었던 메모리 반도체 시장에서 플래시메모리, 저전력 S램, 슈도S램, F램 등 다양한 제품들이 세력을 확대해가고 있는 가운데, D램 자체도 애플리케이션들이 다양해지면서 각기 특화된 기능을 요구하는 시장 요구에 부응해 종류와 기능이 다양해지고 있는 셈이다.  우선 고속 D램에서 가장 앞장서고 있는 제품은 최대 1.6Gbps까지 속도를 내고 있는 그래픽DDR(GDDR) D램이다. 그래픽카드에 부착, 게임 등의 동영상을 끊김 없이 실시간으로 처리하기 위해 일반 D램에 비해 데이터 전송속도를 2배 가까이 높인 것이 GDDR의 특징이다.  속도가 빨라졌을 뿐만 아니라 전력소비 역시 기존의 2.5V에서 1.8V로 낮아졌다. GDDR의 주요 시장이 전원에 크게 구애받지 않는 데스크톱 PC 시장에 한정돼 있는 것은 아니기 때문이다.  CPU의 클록당 데이터 처리속도와 D램의 속도를 비교하는 것은 아직까지 무리가 따르지만 2000년부터 제품이 나오기 시작한 GDDR은 SDR이나 DDR에 비하면 클록(㎐)당 데이터전송속도(bps)가 CPU에 상당히 근접해 있는 상황이다.  D램에서 저전력이 주요 경쟁요소로 등장하고 있는 것은 모바일 기기 때문. 소비전력을 무시한 채 집적도만 높인다는 전략은 D램 업계에서는 이미 `넌센스'가 된지 오래다. 업계에서는 휴대폰ㆍ디지털카메라 등 디지털 소비가전용 저전력 D램의 비중이 올해 전체 D램의 6%에서 2008년에는 15%에 이를 것으로 보고 있다.  이렇듯 D램 기술에서 속도와 저전력이 중요해졌지만 한가지 변치 않는 법칙도 있다. 대용량 D램이나 저전력 고속 D램이나 미세공정 투자 없이는 이뤄낼 수 없다는 점이다. 2002년 2.5V의 DDR D램 생산에 적용된 공정은 115나노(㎚)였지만 올해 1.8V 구현에는 90나노가 적용되고 있다. 2006년 70나노 시대가 열리면 전력소모는 1.5V까지 낮출 수 있으며, 2008년 57나노로 1.35V, 2010년 45나노로 1.0V시대를 열 수 있으리라는 것이 ITRS(국제반도체기술로드맵)나 하이닉스 측의 전망이다. 사업 성공 및 유지의 관건으로 대규모 투자여력이야 말로 변치 않는 요건이 되고 있다.  하이닉스반도체 메모리연구소 관계자는 "속도와 저전력이 중요해진다고 해서 집적도 경쟁을 하지 않는다는 말은 결코 아니다"라고 전제하고 "다만 전통적인 D램 수요처였던 데스크톱PC의 비중이 지난해 45% 이하로 떨어지면서 다양한 수요처의 다양한 요구사항을 만족시켜야만 하는 시장 변화야말로 D램의 기술을 견인하는 요인이 되고 있다"고 설명했다.

       SD램, RD램, DDR SD램 뜯어보기   영차∼ 데이터를 잽싸게 나르는 짐꾼      PC를 업그레이드할 때 빠지지 않는 것이 메모리다. CPU가 처리할 데이터를 미리 준비해 두는 듬직한  짐꾼 같은 메모리는 어떻게 작동하는지, 종류는 무엇인지,  어떻게 만들었는지 알고 나면 마음에 쏙 드는  업그레이드를 할 수 있다.  양정진/본지 기자(com24@ilovepc.co.kr)   대부분 ‘메모리’하면 흔히 램을 떠올린다. 램이 메모리인 것은 틀림없다. 하지만 엄밀하게 말하면 메모리가 램은 아니다. 메모리, 그러니까 기억장치에는 주기억장치와 보조기억장치가 있고 그 가운데 주기억장치가 램이다. 하드디스크, CD롬 드라이브, CD-RW 드라이브 등은 보조기억장치라 부르는데 이것도 역시 메모리다. 이처럼 메모리 종류는 너무나도 많다. 메모리가 램이 될 수 없는 이유가 바로 그것이다.   주기억장치가 된 D램  램은 S램과 D램이 있다. D램은 SD램, DDR SD램, RD램이 있어 많은 이들이 잘 알고 있지만 S램은 잘 모르는 이가 많다. 하지만 어느 PC든지 꼭 들어가 있다. CPU가 지닌 캐시에 쓰기 때문이다. 펜티엄 4 CPU의 L2 캐시는 256KB, 셀러론 L2 캐시는 128KB라고 할 때 쓰는 L2 캐시가 곧 S램이다. D램(dynamic RAM)은 데이터를 계속해서 머금지 못하고 곧바로 날려버린다. 때문에 데이터를 다시 기록하는 리프레시를 한다. 반대로 S램(static RAM)은 데이터를 계속해서 지니고 있어 리프레시가 필요없다. S램이 D램보다 훨씬 빠르고 안정성이 좋은 이유가 바로 이것이다. 리프레시를 하지 않아서다. 하지만 S램은 재료값이 많이 들어 수십MB이상 큰 용량을 만들기 어렵다. 때문에 싸고 큰 용량 제품을 만들 수 있는 D램이 PC의 주기억장치로 자리잡게 된 것이다.   램은 어떻게 작동하나?  D램은 SD램과 DDR SD램, RD램 등이 널리 알려져 있다. 이들은 이것은 작동 원리가 모두 같지만 어떤 방식을 쓰는가에 따라 나눈 것이다. D램 안에서 벌어지는 일을 엿보자.  메인보드 칩셋은 CPU와 D램이 데이터를 주고받게 한다. CPU가 메인보드 칩셋에 데이터를 보내달라고 하면 칩셋은 데이터가 있는 곳의 행(row, 가로줄) 주소를 메모리로 보낸다. 이 작업마다 1 사이클(Hz)이 걸린다.  행 주소 명령이 실제 D램의 행 주소가 잠시 머무르는 곳(buffer)에 들어오면 데이터를 직접 읽고 쓰는 장치인 센스 엠프가 D램의 데이터 저장창고인 방(cell)을 읽는다. 이렇게 행 부분을 읽게 하는 신호는 RAS(row address strobe)라고 부르고, 센스 엠프가 읽는 데 걸리는 시간을 RAS와 CAS 사이의 기다리는 시간이라고 한다. 이 작업은 2∼3 사이클이 걸린다.  이번에는 열(column. 세로줄) 주소를 받는다. 행 주소만으로 필요한 데이터 위치를 알아내기 어려워서다. 이것은 CAS(column address strobe) 신호를 써서 정확한 열 주소를 찾는다. 이 때 걸리는 시간을 CAS 지연시간이라고 한다. 이 작업도 2∼3 사이클이 걸린다.  행과 열 주소를 찾아가서 필요한 데이터가 어디 있는지 알아냈다. D램 셀에 담긴 정보를 내보내는 곳(output buffer)으로 옮기면 메인보드 칩셋이 정보를 CPU에게 보낸다.   SD램   SD램(synchronous DRAM)이라 부르는 동기식 D램은 작동 클럭이 시스템 버스(FSB)와 똑같이 움직여서 ‘동기’란 이름을 붙였다. ‘PC133 SD램’은 시스템 버스 133MHz와 맞춰서 133MHz로 작동하는 SD램이고 ‘PC100 SD램’은 시스템 버스 100MHz와 똑같이 100MHz로 작동한다. 이것은 CPU와 SD램이 같은 장단에 춤을 춘다는 말이다. CPU가 작동할 때 D램도 따라 움직여서 속도를 지금처럼 크게 올릴 수 있다. 첫 SD램은 속도가 대부분 10∼12나노초였다. 이것은 시스템 버스 66MHz에 알맞은 속도다. 펜티엄 III가 쓰는 시스템 버스 100MHz와 133MHz에 맞추기에는 부족한 속도다. 때문에 속도를 최대한 빠르게 하고 SPD(serial presence detect) 칩을 모듈에 달아서 제원, 속도, 용량 등을 곧바로 알려준다. PC가 램을 알아차리는 시간을 줄여서 시스템 버스 100MHz와 133MHz에도 제대로 작동하게 만들었다. 시장에서 가장 많이 볼 수 있는 D램이 ‘PC100 SD램’과 ‘PC133 SD램’이다. 이처럼 PC100과 PC133 SD램은 시스템 버스 100MHz와 133MHz에 맞춰 써야 제 성능이 난다.  SD램은 클럭이 오르고 내리는 원리를 응용해서 데이터를 주고받는다. 클럭이 아래에서 위로 올라갈 때 데이터를 내보내거나 담는다. D램 속도는 시스템 버스(FSB)와 똑같이 100MHz나 133MHz로 발맞춰 움직인다. 때문에 동기식(싱크로너스 Synchronous) D램, 즉 SD램이란 이름을 붙였다. CPU, D램, 시스템 버스를 같은 속도로 작동해서 빠르게 데이터를 주고받는다.   DDR SD램   D램을 만드는 기술을 더욱 발전시켜도 D램 구조의 한계 때문에 속도를 크게 올리기 어렵다. 펜티엄 4의 시스템 버스 400MHz에 SD램 속도를 높여 맞추려면 어림없다는 말이다. 때문에 클럭(MHz)을 올리기보다는 다른 방법을 써서 속도를 높이는 방법을 연구했다. 그 결과가 DDR SD램이다. DDR(double date rate)은 주기 한번에 작동하는 데이터 양이 두 배라는 뜻이다. SD램과 같은 속도라도 한 번에 보내는 양이 두 배이기 때문에 클럭을 높인 것과 같은 효과를 본다. 때문에 100MHz로 작동하는 DDR SD램은 200MHz로 작동하는 SD램과 같은 셈이다. DDR SD램은 SD램과 같은 명령어를 쓴다. 램에 데이터를 쓰고 읽는 원리가 다르지 않다는 이야기다. D램이 작동하는 움직임은 사인 곡선(sine curve)과 같다. 사인 곡선은 한 사이클에 한 번은 올라가고 한 번은 내려간다. SD램은 사인 곡선이 내려갈 때만 데이터를 내보내지만, DDR SD램은 올라갈 때와 내려갈 때도 데이터가 나오거나 들어간다. DDR SD램은 SD램보다 데이터를 두 배 빨리 처리한다는 것은 이 때문이다. 하지만 이것은 이론적인 계산이고 실제로는 SD램보다 딱 두 배 성능이 나지는 않는다. 두 배의 데이터가 나오거나 들어갈 수 있다고 해도 SD램과 같은 명령을 쓰고 명령을 내리는 방식은 같기 때문이다. DDR SD램 전체 성능이 SD램보다 정확히 두 배 성능은 아니다.  DDR SD램은 SD램과 같은 명령을 쓴다. DDR SD램이 다른 것은 클럭이 아래에 있을 때와 올라가 있을 때도 데이터를 입력하거나 내보낸다. 이 때문에 두 배의 데이터를 주고받는 다는 DDR(double data rate)이라는 이름을 붙였다. 이론적으로는 두 배지만 실제로 SD램보다 딱 두 배가 나오지는 않는다. 그것은 읽고 쓰라는 명령 방식이 바뀌지 않아서다.   RD램   RD램(rambus DRAM)은 명령과 데이터를 주고받는 방법을 뿌리부터 바꾼 프로토콜(protocol, 규약) 방식 메모리다. 하지만 데이터를 주고받는 방법이 바뀌었을 뿐, 작동 원리는 그대로 D램이다. PC 시스템과 주고받는 명령과 데이터를 묶어서(packet) 주고받게 고친 것이다. 이처럼 묶인 데이터를 시스템 버스가 똑바로 알아채려면 D램과 서로 약속(protocol)을 해둬야 한다. 때문에 메모리 칩에 프로토콜을 알아채는 인터페이스를 단다. SD램은 8비트를 한 번에 주고받는 버스(bus. 데이터 통로)를 지닌 메모리 칩 8개를 엮고 병렬로 연결했기 때문에 64비트를 한 번에 주고받는다. 그에 반해 RD램은 16비트짜리 메모리 칩을 램버스 채널(데이터 통로)에 얹어 직렬로 연결해서 16비트 그대로다. SD램은 주기 한 번에 64비트씩 데이터를 주고받지만 RD램은 16비트를 주고받는다. 한 번에 주고받는 데이터는 SD램보다 적지만 데이터 통로의 작동속도가 400MHz이고 DDR 기술을 써서 800MHz로 끌어 올렸다. 이것은 펜티엄 4 CPU와 짝을 맺게 된 이유이기도 하다. 펜티엄 4는 시스템 버스가 400MHz라서 CPU와 메인보드 칩셋이 주고받는 데이터 폭은 1초에 3.2GB다. RD램을 쓰면 메인보드 칩셋과 나누는 데이터 폭을 3.2GB로 맞출 수 있기 때문이다.  400MHz로 작동하는 RD램은 클럭 4번이 패킷 한 개이고, 이 것이 램버스 채널에서 명령을 내리는 가장 작은 단위다. 직렬로 연결한 메모리 칩은 16비트 데이터를 엮어서 RD램도 16비트 데이터를 주고받지만 작동속도가 400MHz이고 DDR 기술을 써서 800MHz로 작동하기 때문에 속도가 빠르다

       Hans Wu, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Wednesday 4 August 2004]    Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest DRAM maker, will start mass-producing 90nm-based DDR2 at the end of this year or the beginning of next year, according to company sources.  With DRAM representing 10% of global chip revenues last year, the transition of DRAM suppliers to 90nm technology is key for the current semiconductor up-cycle, iSuppli said in a weekly commentary published by Silicon Strategies on June 25.  Samsung is the first DRAM company to begin the transition. According to the sources, Samsung will initially use 90nm technology to produce 512Mbit DDR2 400, 533 and 667 components. The company has not responded to an inquiry for comment.  Samsung said in a July 16 conference call that it is starting to use 90nm technology for producing DRAM and expects the technology to account for 3% of its wafer starts this quarter and 5% next quarter. However, it did not indicate whether the technology would be used for DDR2.

According to statistics recently generated by IC Insights for its new Mid-Year Update to The McClean Report, Intel, Samsung, TI, and Renesas maintained their number one through four positions, respectively, among the worldwide top 10 semiconductor suppliers.  Other first half 2004 ranking highlights include:  -- Total 1H04/1H03 sales for the top 10 semiconductor companies grew 33 percent.  The worldwide semiconductor market grew slightly faster in 1H04 increasing 35 percent to $101.5B from $75.0B in 1H03.  -- Only four companies had sales growth rates above the 1H04/1H03 top 10 average of 33 percent: Samsung, TSMC, Texas Instruments, and Infineon.  -- Infineon jumped from 7th in the 2003 full-year top 10 semiconductor ranking to 5th in the 1H04 ranking.  The company registered a 35 percent 1H04/1H03 sales increase.  -- Samsung’s 1H04 semiconductor sales increased 80 percent when compared to 1H03!  The company’s gains in the flash memory market were a driving force behind this surge.  It is interesting to note that if Samsung were excluded from the top 10 ranking, the remainder of the semiconductor sales leaders (the other nine companies) would have registered only a 28 percent 1H04/1H03 growth rate.  IC Insights’ forecast for full-year 2004/2003 worldwide semiconductor industry growth is 32 percent.

      SPIL expects 3-5% growth for 3Q, predicts moderate industry growth Cage Chao and Amy Lee, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Thursday 5 August 2004]    Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd (SPIL) projects its third-quarter revenues will grow 3-5%, company chairman Bough Lin said during an August 4 investors conference. Lin also remarked that the industry will grow steadily over the next three to four years.  In the third quarter, the PC segment will see seasonal growth, but sales of memory ICs are expected to drop slightly, Lin stated. He forecasted that sales in the consumer electronics segment will drop as customers need to adjust inventory. Sales from the communications segment will increase slightly or remain flat.  Average selling prices (ASPs) will stay flat or fall slightly this quarter, while gross margins will also remain flat, Lin added.  SPIL will utilize 90% of its packaging capacity this quarter, up from 85% last quarter. Utilization rates of its testing capacity will stay above 70% this quarter.  Remarks  Following a projection for the company’s growth, Lin made four observations on the overall semiconductor industry.  First, the industry will grow at a more moderate pace over the next three to four years, as compared to the current upcycle. Lin said the pace would change as product migrations are nearly complete. As an example, Lin listed the migration from monochrome handset to color handsets as a key driver for boosting chip sales since mid-2003.  Second, the high inventory issue many analysts are worried about are not industry-wide, and the supply chain will digest excess inventory over the next three to six months.  Third, chip supply may outpace demand over the next six months, but the balance will resume in the long term.  The last point Lin stressed was that chipmakers need to continue investing in high-end technologies to maintain long-term competitiveness.

      Edward Moltzen, CRN  Silicon Strategies 08/12/2004, 10:00 $ ET      MANHASSET, N.Y. — An Intel Corp. executive has told analysts that the chip maker has found and fixed a glitch that pushed launch of the next-generation Centrino mobile CPU, code-named Sonoma, to the first quarter of 2005 and confirmed that some units would ship to PC makers in the fourth quarter of 2004.   "We wanted to make sure we addressed a quality issue we found in a late stage of validation," Anand Chandrasekher, vice president of Intel's Mobile Platforms Group, told financial analysts Wednesday (August 11). "We have since found that issue and fixed it."   The Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker still expects the chip's volume roll-out to be in the first quarter, Chandrasekher said.   Intel has been beset recently by a series of execution problems, including the delayed launch of Sonoma, a delay until next year of the forthcoming 4-GHz version of the Pentium 4, and inventory imbalances. Those issues, among others, convinced top brass at Intel to tell customers they would undertake a top-to-bottom review of its entire product roadmap to ensure there would be no further slips or disappointments.   Chandrasekher made his remarks in one of Intel's regular, quarterly calls with financial analysts to provide detailed updates on its various lines of business.   Sonoma is set to follow on the May launch of Intel's Dothan processor -- the centerpiece of its current Centrino platform offering. Centrino is composed of Intel's mobile processor, its wireless card and its chipset.   When Sonoma ships, Chandrasekher said, it will still include a new chip set -- code-named Alviso -- as well as 802.11a/b/g wireless capability. Intel is promising that Alviso will improve portable audio -- including providing Dolby 7.1 surround sound and noise cancellation for VoIP applications--and better graphics.   It's clear that Intel is banking significantly on growth in the notebook space as well as use of notebooks for wireless connectivity. Chandrasekher said Intel is still hoping to see 250 percent, year-over-year growth in its mobile business this year -- a number that would make it far and away the fastest-growing, big-ticket item in its product lineup.   Along those lines, Chandrasekher said custom system builders continued to play a significant role in the growth of the wireless platform.   "I think the white book market is very real," Chandrasekher said, noting that with manufacturers in Taiwan producing an abundance of "white book" building blocks for system builders, in a competitive environment that was leading to better-quality designs. "We're certainly seeing the white book marketplace grow, and being very aggressive."

      Online Staff -- Electronic News, 8/13/2004   While Agilent Technologies Inc. posted growth in sequential revenue for its July quarter, but orders dropped sequentially and year over year for its automated testers.  The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company announced Thursday its financial results for its fiscal Q3, which ended July 31st. Agilent posted orders of $1.78 billion for the 21 percent above one year ago, but down from the $1.89 billion posted in the prior quarter.  Revenues during the quarter were $1.89 billion, 25 percent ahead of last year, and net earnings were $100 million, or 20 cents per share. In the year ago period the company posted a net loss of $1.56 billion, or $3.28 per share. In the prior quarter, the company posted revenues of $1.83 billion and earnings of $104 million, or 21 cents per share.   "Our Test and Measurement segment performance was particularly strong, with orders up 37 percent to the highest level since early 2001 and revenues 25 percent above last year," Ned Barnholt, chairman, president and CEO, said in a statement. "We achieved our commitment to reach double-digit operating margins in this segment one quarter ahead of plan, with a third quarter margin of 11 percent.   "We are pleased with the sustained momentum we are seeing in our Test and Measurement and our Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis segments," Barnholt continued. "But, we are also seeing a pause in Agilent's semiconductor and semiconductor equipment businesses that may continue through year-end before we see renewed growth in fiscal 2005.   "On balance, we remain comfortable with Agilent's prior fourth quarter guidance for revenues of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion and operating earnings 30 cents to 35 cents per share," Barnholt concluded.  For the July quarter Agilent posted automated test equipment orders (which includes electronics manufacturing and semiconductor testers) was $208 million, down from the year ago period's $251 million, and down sequentially from the April quarter's $286 million. Strength in parametric and manufacturing test was more than offset by year-to-year declines in orders for system on a chip (SOC) and flash memory test systems, Agilent said.   Utilization rates for SOC testers at semiconductor contract manufacturers dropped several percentage points in the third quarter, suggesting a period of semiconductor industry digestion and cautious ordering that could last through Q4, according to the company. Revenues of $243 million were 18 percent above last year but down 9 percent sequentially.   Meanwhile, Agilent's semiconductor products orders semiconductor Products orders continued to show strong year-to-year gains but also dropped sequentially from fiscal Q2. With third quarter orders of $470 million, orders up 31 percent from last year but down 10 percent sequentially. The company attributed the sequential decline to normal seasonal weakness and an industry inventory rebuilding that appears to have been completed.  Personal systems orders were up 43 percent from last year but down 13 percent sequentially, as the maturing semiconductor cycle begins to exhibit the normal seasonal patterns of a consumer-focused business, Agilent said. Networking systems orders were 8 percent above one year ago and down 3 percent sequentially. Fiscal Q3 revenues of $539 million were 42 percent above last year compared to a 40 percent increase in worldwide semiconductor industry shipments through June.

      대만 메인보드 제조사인 MSI와 LG 전자가 중국의 강소성 쿤산에서의 노트북 합작 생산 사업을 중단할 것으로 보인다고 시장 관계자가 전했다.  MSI와 LG 전자는 2003년 쿤산에 합작 사업을 추진하여 노트북 청부 생산 계약을 맺고 LG-IBM이란 브랜드의 IBM 노트북 생산을 진행한 바 있다. LG-MSI 합작 사업의 자본액은 총 32억원 가량으로, 이 중 LG가 51%, MSI가 49%의 금액을 투자하였다.   양사간의 합작 관계에 불협화음이 나기 시작한 것은 올 해초 MSI가 자사 브랜드 노트북의 마케팅 활동을 시작하면서부터로 보인다. MSI는 우선 중국 시장을 목표로 자사 노트북 제품을 공급하기 시작했으며, 같은 시장에서 실제적으로 양사간의 제품들이 부딪히기 시작하였다.   LG 전자는 합작 사업 관계가 종결됨에 따른 정당한 배당 권리를 요청할 것으로 희망하고 있다고 하나, MSI 측에서는 이와 같은 사실에 대해서 구체적인 언급은 없었다고 한다.

      Kathryn Chiu, Taipei; Jessie Shen, DigiTimes.com [Thursday 12 August 2004]    Unit prices for CMOS image sensors used in optical mice will likely slide 10-20% in the second half of this year, down from US$1-1.2 per unit, according to sources at Taiwanese CMOS sensor suppliers.  Taiwan-based IC design houses for CMOS image sensors, including Elan Microelectronics, PixArt Imaging (PXI), Sunplus Technology and Unity Opto Technology, are expected to grab a 50-60% share of the global market this year, with combined shipments of 5.5-6 million per month, the sources indicated.  Elan and Sunplus are scheduled to launch CMOS sensors for wireless optical mouse products later this year, following PXI’s recent volume shipments, sources at the two companies estimated.  Based on PXI’s earlier projections of market penetration for optical mice, the wireless optical mouse segment will likely occupy 30% of total mouse shipments this year, according to market sources.

      Charles Chou, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Thursday 12 August 2004]    Intel’s planned chipset price cuts, slated for September 26, will focus on boosting sales of PCIe-supporting chipsets that feature Intel integrated graphics. PC OEM makers are the target segment, according to sources at Taiwan motherboard makers, who cited Intel’s latest roadmap.  The price cuts will affect the PCIe-enabled 915-series and mainstream 865-series chipsets. The unit price of the 915GV chipset will drop from US$37 to US$35, while the 865G will be pegged unchanged at US$36, the sources noted.  This price drop is expected to encourage PC OEMs to adopt the PCIe-supporting integrated graphics chipsets on their new PCs – a move which will help lower PC prices, while further depressing demand for discrete desktop graphics chips, the sources asserted.

      삼성전자는 DDR2 D램의 누적 생산 1천만개(256Mb 환산기준)를 돌파, DDR에서 DDR2로의 D램 시장 전환을을 본격적으로 하기 시작했으며 지난해 10월 업계 최초로 DDR2 제품을 본격 양산한 이래 지난 7월까지 총 누적 생산이 1,200만개를 기록, 1천만개를 넘어섰다고 밝혔다.      이는 주요 D램 업체들의 DDR2 생산량을 모두 합한 규모의 2배에 달하 는 것으로, 삼성전자는 이번 성과로 차세대 D램 시장의 주력 메모리로 부상 중인 DDR2의 초기시장 선점 및 시장 확대에 주도권을 잡게 됐다.    이번 'DDR2 생산 1천만개 돌파' 는 삼성전자가 IBM·델·HP 등 주요 PC 업체로부터 DDR2 제품의 성능을 인정받고, 지속적으로 제품을 공급해 온 결과로, 지난 6월 인텔의 DDR2 지원 칩셋 출시로 수요가 급증한 것도 주요 요인이었다.    DDR2는 △동작속도 △동작전압 △제품특성 면에서 기존 DDR 보다 대폭 개선된 D램 제품으로, 최근 PC·노트북·서버 등시스템이 점차 고성능화 되면서 각 시스템의 주력 메모리도 DDR2로의 전환이 필수적이며, 반도체 업계의 시장선점 경쟁도 치열한 상황이다.    삼성전자는 DDR2 시장선점을 위해 지난 '98년부터 DDR2에 대한 표준화를 추진, '02년에 DDR2가 국제 표준제품으로 채택되는데 주도적인 역할을 했으며, 현재까지 256Mb·512Mb·1Gb 제품과 함께 다양한 메모리 모듈 제품을 갖추고 DDR2 시장을 공략하고 있다.    삼성전자는 올해말까지 DDR2 비중을 전체 DDR 제품의 34%까지 끌어올려, DDR2 시장점유율 50% 이상을 유지, 시장지배력을 확대할 계획이다.    반도체 시장조사 전문기관인 데이터퀘스트는 전체 D램 중 DDR2 비중이 올해 3분기 11%에서, '05년 말에는 약 50%로 증가해 DDR2가 D램 시장의 주력제품으로 급부상할 것으로 전망하고 있다.

      By Spencer Chin  Silicon Strategies 08/10/2004, 5:00 $Ä ET  MANHASSET, N.Y. — Silicon Genesis Corp. (SiGen) has developed a wafer-level uniaxial strained substrate technology, called Next-Generation Strain or NGS, that is reported to avoid the mobility degradation and the high defect levels associated with silicon germanium based biaxially strained silicon or strained silicon-on-insulator technology.   Silicon Genesis (San Jose), a provider of silicon-on-insulator process technology, claims to be first company to successfully employ uniaxial strain technology on a wafer level rather than local transistor level. Transistor-level uniaxial strained substrate technology has been demonstrated by chip manufacturers such as Intel and Texas Instruments, with Intel already using the technology in its 90nm process.   "This new material offers the potential for significant mobility enhancements over silicon germanium-based biaxial strain wafer technologies and is compatible with local straining approaches since the strains are additive," said Francois J. Henley, president and chief executive of Silicon Genesis, in a statement. "It also features very low defect levels due to use of SiGen's proprietary low-temperature processing technology. It can be directly integrated on silicon as an epi-like strained bulk wafer or on an insulator as a strained silicon-on-insulator wafer."   Henley added that the costs of producing uniaxial strained substrates are expected to be significantly lower than biaxial technologies because the process avoids the costly steps of growing and relaxing thick silicon-germanium layers.   Silicon Genesis plans to pursue the development and commercialization of its Next-Generation Strain technology with a number of partners.

      Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/11/2004   Maybe the nay-sayers who have been cautioning about overly optimistic semiconductor revenues this year were right, considering Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc. lowered the revenue forecast for its September quarter.  The move was made based on customer discussions that indicated a general slowing in semiconductor growth and wire bonder shipments, K&S said.  Previously, the Willow Grove, Pa.-based company forecasted revenue for its fiscal Q4 to be between $175 million and $195 million. Today, that was revised to $135 million to $165 million.  “We have implemented cost improvements over the last several quarters so as to be profitable in off-peak quarters. These cost cutting plans are on track," said Maurice Carson, VP and CFO of K&S, in a statement. "Even at the low end of this new revenue range, we anticipate a profitable quarter, excluding bond redemption costs, with positive operating cash flow. In addition, our R&D plans are still moving forward.   "Our revised guidance is based on our customers’ latest indications regarding wire bonder capacity. Some customers are now more cautious about the timing of future demand," he continued. "This reduction of wire bonder demand does not reflect any loss of market share and we expect our packaging materials and test products will meet their original forecast.”

      Hans Wu and Josephine Lien, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Wednesday 11 August 2004]    Taiwan DRAM makers saw mixed July revenues amid slight gains in DRAM shipment.  According to DRAMeXchange, Taiwan makers’ DRAM shipments increased to 59.3 million 256Mbit (32Mbitx8) equivalent units of DRAM chips last month from 55.4 million units in June.  Nanya Technology’s July revenues dropped 4% on month to NT$3.3 billion, as contract prices for the month slipped.  Although average selling prices (ASPs) for the month dropped 4%, Nanya said it had gross margins for the month of 45%.  Nanya’s DRAM output for the month was flat from June but the company expects that capacity ramps from Inotera Memory will increase the company’s output this month, said company spokesperson Pei-lin Pai during an August 10 investors conference.  Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation (PSC) said its July net sales increased 3% sequentially to NT$5.2 billion, on increased 12-inch DRAM output and foundry business.  As reported yesterday, sales for ProMOS Technologies grew 1% to NT$3.8 billion, with gross margins above 40%.

      Charles Chou, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Wednesday 11 August 2004]    Although Intel has started delivering 64-bit-capable processors to server and workstation OEMs, there is still no timetable for positioning the 64-bit chips in the desktop segment, according to sources at Intel Taiwan.  There has been increasing speculation about Intel’s plans for the 64-bit chips since the specifications and prices of Intel’s new Pentium 4 processors with 64-bit extension technology (known as EM64T) are similar to those of desktop CPUs, said sources at Taiwan motherboard makers.  The time is not yet ripe for positioning the 64-bit version of the Prescott processor for the desktop, stated sources at Intel Taiwan.  Taiwan motherboard makers commented, however, that Intel’s aim is to ease the relatively high inventory levels of its 32-bit processors before migrating the new chips to the desktop segment.    The 64-bit-capable Pentium 4 CPUs are available at 3.2F, 3.4F and 3.6F GHz. Intel has inserted the letter “F” after clock speeds to distinguish chips incorporating EM64T technology.

      Amy Lee, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Wednesday 11 August 2004]   Following weak demand last quarter, IC substrate makers in Taiwan are hoping for a turnaround in PC-related chip demand this quarter, said sources at local players.  IC substrates are key materials for IC packaging. Many chips used in PCs are adopting plastic ball-grid array (PBGA) or flip-chip substrates, which generate better profit margins for IC substrate makers.  IC substrate makers are counting on demand from the PC segment to pick up this quarter, in accord with projections made by Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd (SPIL).  Sales at some firms have been affected by slow demand for chipset applications, according to sources. The sources indicated that Intel had canceled up to NT$100 million worth of orders for its substrate suppliers after the US chipmaker’s chipset recall on June 25.  Among the major substrate suppliers in Taiwan, Phoenix Precision Technology (PPT) saw its July sales drop 16.2% on-month to NT$421.2 million since its products are used mainly by PC-related chipmakers.  In contrast, July sales by Unimicron Technology and Kinsus Interconnect Technology only changed slightly due to their more diversified customer mix.

      "Big 3" become "Big 4" as China-based SMIC joins ranks   Scottsdale, Arizona --- August 10, 2004 --- After growing twice as fast as the total IC market in 2003, pure-play foundry sales are forecast to increase 52 percent in 2004 to $17.17 billion.  This compares to a 31 percent increase forecast for the total IC market in 2004.  Figure 1 lists the major pure-play IC foundries and their sales for 2002 and 2003, and IC Insights’ forecast for 2004.  IC Insights defines a pure-play foundry (e.g., TSMC, UMC, Chartered, SMIC, etc.) as a company that does not offer a significant amount of IC products of its own design, but instead focuses on producing ICs for other companies.  In 2003, TSMC registered an all-time high in sales but lost 2 percentage points in marketshare.  Because of the numerous pure-play (e.g., SMIC) and IDM (e.g., IBM) foundry startups over the past few years, it has become increasingly difficult for TSMC to keep from losing some marketshare.  As shown, TSMC is forecast to lose another 5 points of foundry marketshare in 2004 while its 2004/2003 sales increase a strong 37 percent.  Overall, in IC Insights’ opinion, the so-called “Big 3” pure-play foundries of TSMC, UMC, and Chartered have now become the “Big 4” foundries with the addition of China-based SMIC.  As shown, in 2004, SMIC is forecast to almost triple its sales to just over $1.0 billion!  Amazingly, SMIC is forecast to go from serving only 1 percent of the pure-play foundry market in 2002 to having a 6 percent share in 2004.  It is also interesting to note how aggressive SMIC is expected to be in adding capacity over the next couple of years.  In 2005, if everything goes according to plan (i.e., doubling its capacity in both 2004 and 2005), SMIC will have 33 percent more wafer capacity than Chartered and just under half the capacity of UMC.  In 2004, the “Big 4” foundries are expected to be among the most aggressive capital spenders.  Moreover, although SMIC’s 2004 foundry sales are expected to be about one-fourth of UMC’s sales, SMIC is forecast to come close to matching UMC’s capital expenditures this year.  In total, the “Big 4” pure-play foundries’ capital spending in 2004 is forecast to surge 183 percent (to $7.2B), with each of the companies at least doubling their 2004/2003 expenditures!  In contrast, 2004/2003 worldwide semiconductor industry capital expenditures are forecast to increase 53 percent.

      Charles Chou, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Tuesday 10 August 2004]    Intel plans to cut prices for a complete lineup of its chipsets, including the 915 family, in the latter half of September, aiming to boost the relatively lukewarm sales of its 915 chipsets, according to sources at motherboard makers and in the channel.  The planned chipset price cuts, along with the forthcoming August 22 reduction of prices for Intel’s socket LGA 775 Pentium 4 and Celeron D processors, should administer a shot in the arm for the PC industry as it migrates to the 915 platform, the sources said.  The sources stated that current sales of devices that support the 915 platform, including sales of socket LGA 775 CPUs, 915 chipsets and PCIe graphics cards have lagged far behind expectations, with PC users reluctant to adopt the new platform.  In addition, Intel’s 865 chipsets still remain the mainstream in the market, and strong demand has even has helped ease an oversupply of the 865 chipsets, which had been dumped on the market prior to the launch of the 915/925 chipsets, the sources noted.  The price of the 865G chipset, for example, has been raised by an average of US$0.30-0.40 per unit by non-designated distributors recently, indicating an easing of the oversupply situation, according to sources.  Efforts by Intel to control the supply of the 865 family lineup also helped improve the inventory adjustment, said the sources.

      Jillian Shih, Taipei; Carrie Yu, DigiTimes.com [Tuesday 10 August 2004]    Samsung Electronics is closing-in on Sony in the North America HDTV (high-definition TV) market by aggressively cutting prices of its DLP (digital light processing)-based RPTVs (rear-projection TVs), according to sources.  In May 2004, the South Korean company captured 18.3% of the market, up from 14.3% in January. Sony’s respective market shares were 28.6% and 27.6%.  After a heated price war, Samsung has managed to take 37.8% of the DLP market in North America, which is fairly close to Sony’s 39.2%, sources said.  The sources also indicated that Samsung and Sony shipped 140,000 and 260,000 CRT TVs, respectively, between January and May this year.

      Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/10/2004   Lehman Brothers updated its outlook on semiconductors, with its new expectations lower for some big name players.  Intel, Fairchild, Xilinx and On Semiconductor have all been downgraded by the market research firm on a less-than-steady market environment.   "We conclude that while it is possible that a near term rally may ensue following somewhat more encouraging PC trends in July, the issues weighing on semis in 2Q04 in terms of unit growth potentially running ahead of mixed end market demand may continue to loom as challenges may persist through 3Q04 and into 4Q04 and 1Q05," Tim Luke, a managing director at Lehman, said in a research note late Monday. "We therefore look to use this opportunity to re-align our outlook and move to a more neutral sector rating."  According to the firm, semi industry revenue grew more than 40 percent for first time in four years in April and June, and unit growth surpassed 20 percent for five of last six months. While much has been made of inventory concerns and while inventories with OEMs do not seem excessive relative to historical levels, Lehman considers higher inventories within distribution coupled with guidance from vendors of "normal seasonal" growth in Q3 may not leave much room for inventory to be worked lower. Inventory re-ordering may be restrained, the firm said, which suggests unit growth may need to move lower.  "Our reservations are more focused on unit and sales growth running ahead of consumption," Luke continued. "Therefore, consider capacity utilization rates may be peaking in 2Q/3Q04 with component pricing flattish going forward. Given absence of 'killer apps' to lift demand and without additional pricing leverage, consider CY05 semiconductor industry revenue forecast in 8 percent to 10 percent range more appropriate than prior 13 percent to 15 percent."   On that, Lehman lowered its rating on wireless equipment and wireless semis in July and retained equal weight on Texas Instruments with focus on its 3G play with Qualcomm. It also remains neutral on enterprise networking with a focus on Cisco (overweight) and noted communication ICs are also rated as neutral.    "We are taking this opportunity to lower our CY05 estimates and price target on Intel, move comm play Xilinx and discrete vendor Fairchild both to equal weight from overweight, and fine-tune estimates on On Semiconductor (equal weight). Our European colleague Uli Pelzer retains his cautious outlook on STMicro, Philips and Infineon (all equal weight)," Luke concluded.  Intel's price target was dropped to $26 a share; Fairchild's to$18; Xilinx to $33; and On Semi's to $7.

      Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/10/2004   Bellwether Intel Corp.'s estimates may have been bold, but the outcome may not be as beautiful as the company would have liked.  Lehman Brothers has downgraded its standing on the MPU kingpin, noting missed product deadlines, among other missteps.  "Heading into 2Q04, we had signaled some reservations on our outlook, however, we were left surprised by the impact of Intel's higher production yields prompting a need for it to slow wafer starts and hence lower fab utilization levels and margins," Tim Luke, a managing director at the firm, said in a research note. "Looking forward, lower margins appear to be combined with relatively bold revenue guidance for 3Q04 of up 7 percent to 14 percent (11 percent at mid-point) ahead of normal seasonality in the 6 percent to 8 percent range.   "Currently we consider Intel's aggressive moves in areas such as flash, motherboards and chipsets combined with an improving PC market through July after a mixed June, may render this guidance achievable, although we consider that upside to estimates may remain unlikely in the context of a steady but relatively uninspiring end market for both 3Q04 and 4Q04.  We also recognize that investors are likely to focus intensely on Intel's progress in its attempts to lower its inventory levels."     Lehman stated that Intel's well-publicized delays on several new product platforms could further limit upside to revenue estimates and, while unit numbers are modest, challenges on the delivery of high-end 4GHz solutions may also limit margin expansion if the upward cycle of pricing for the highest-performing microprocessors is delayed.    "More broadly, we also consider that as Intel seeks to transition away from the steady increase in clock speeds to dual core microprocessors, that the timelines associated with such a bold new initiative could potentially see some slippage in 2005.  We also believe that the margin implications of this strategy are also subject to some uncertainty," Luke said.      On that, the firm has trimmed its calendar year 2005 estimates from $1.33 to $1.30, based on slightly lower revenues in-line with PC growth estimates and some more conservative gross margin assumptions, now 60.5 percent in 2005.    "As we move into the seasonal lift from back-to-school and given our view that near term guidance for the September quarter could be achievable, we are retaining our overweight rating on this core holding. However, with our CY05 estimates moving lower, we are lowering our target to $26, 20x our revised CY05 EPS estimate, and we see upside limited to around $26 to $27," Luke concluded.   Lehman also lowered its expectations for other semi players, Fairchild, Xilinx and On Semi, in a seperate report.

      By Peter Clarke  Silicon Strategies 08/10/2004, 5:00 $ ET  LONDON -- Intel Corp. is not among the early leaders that have emerged among vendors of Gigabit Ethernet controllers supporting PCI Express, according to market research company The Linley Group.   The situation looks like yet another mis-step by Intel as the company is not only the world's largest chip company and the market leader in Gigabit Ethernet controllers but the latest transition is being fuelled by personal computers based on Intel's 915 and 925 chip sets, formerly known as Grantsdale and Alderwood, which support the PCI Express bus.   These first PC systems, desktop systems from Dell, Hewlett Packard and IBM, are using Broadcom's BCM5751 GbE controller, which integrates a single-lane (x1) PCI Express interface, while Intel produced GbE-capable 915/925 motherboards use Marvell's Yukon 88E8050 GbE controller, which also integrates a x1 PCI Express interface, according to Linley Group analyst Bob Wheeler.   Intel has demonstrated a GbE controller running on a Grantsdale platform dubbed Northway -- at the Intel Developer Forum Taiwan in October 2003 -- which was due to ship in 2004, the market research company said. It went on to add that Northway was slated to be built using Intel's 90-nanometer manufacturing processes, so that the need to migrate from a PCI interface to PCI Express and to port a GbE-over-copper physical interface circuitry to 90-nm process this was also Intel's first attempt at analog design in the 90nm process.   Wheeler concludes that the PHY design, rather than the digital PCI Express interface, is the likely source of problems with Northway.   "Intel simply added unnecessary risk to an important program. GbE controller chips gain little advantage from the use of 90-nm technology, so a Northway chip designed using TSMC's 0.13-micron process could have been competitive with the chips from Broadcom and Marvell," Wheeler said.

      해외 웹사이트를 통해 GeForce 6600 시리즈의 실물 사진이 공개되었다. 공개된 모델은 GeForce 6600GT와 6600으로, 각각 대체적인 성능과 외관을 볼 수 있다.   코드네임 NV43의 GeForce 6600GT는 130nm 공정을 사용하여 생산되며, Native PCI-Express를 지원한다. 6600GT의 코어클럭은 500MHz, 메모리는 128비트 버스의 128MB GDDR3를 사용하게 될 것이라 하고, 가격은 199달러 선이 될 것이라고 한다. 3D Mark 03으로 테스트한 결과 6600GT가 얻은 점수는 무려 8000점 대로 성능상으로 Radeon 9800XT를 압도하고 있어, 6600 시리즈가 PCI-Express 기반 그래픽카드의 주력이 될 수도 있을 것이라 조심스레 예측해 볼 수도 있을 듯 하다.  GeForce 6600은 6600GT와 다르게 TSOP 방식의 메모리를 사용하고, 전원부가 간결하게 설계되어 생산 단가 상의 이득으로 좀 더 저렴한 가격을 기대할 수 있을 것으로 보인다. 이 역시 Native PCI-Express를 지원하며, 출력 옵션으로는 기본적으로 TV-Out, D-Sub, DVI-I를 지원한다. 6600의 코어 클럭은 300MHz이나, 메모리 사양에 관하여서는 구체적으로 언급하지 않았다고 하는데, 이에 대해 해당 웹사이트의 필진은 제조사의 재량으로 메모리 사양을 조정할 수 있도록 어느 정도 허가한 것으로 판단하고 있다. 6600의 가격은 대략 149달러 선이 될 것이라고 한다.

        Josephine Lien and Hans Wu, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Monday 9 August 2004]       After its net profits for the second quarter more than doubled sequentially to NT$1.8 billion, Winbond Electronics stated it expects production of its pseudo SRAM (PSRAM) will slow down in the third quarter, but that commodity DRAM will grow during the same period. Winbond expects to allocate 46% of its 8-inch capacity to PSRAM in this quarter, down from 52% last quarter. Capacity allocation to commodity DRAM will increase to 14% from 5% last quarter, Winbond said. PSRAM “Going forward, we hold a reserved outlook for PSRAM in the third quarter, due to customers adjusting their inventory,” Winbond noted in the statement. Shipments for the second half may be flat from the first half. The average selling price (ASP) for the product may drop by 10% this quarter, Tung-yi Chan, company vice president of sales, commented during an August 6 investors conference. These notes worry investors, as Winbond has been aiming to increase its PSRAM and specialty DRAM sales to reduce exposure to the highly volatile DRAM market. PSRAM and specialty DRAM accounted for 62% of Winbond’s second-quarter sales. In response, Chan said that orders will increase after multi-chip package (MCP) makers complete their inventory adjustments by the end of this quarter. Regarding its technology migration, Winbond said it will produce 50% of its PSRAM with 0.13-micron technology by the end of this year. Commodity DRAM Based on its agreement with Infineon Technologies, Winbond expects output of commodity DRAM will increase as it continues to yield more good dies on production with 0.11-micron technologies. Output for commodity DRAM will reach 4,000 8-inch wafers per month this quarter from 1,000 wafers last quarter, and expand to 10,000 wafers in the fourth quarter.

       Silicon Strategies 08/06/2004, 5:00 $Ä ET          SANTA CLARA, California -- Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $5.1 million at graphics processor company Nvidia Corp. compared to net income of $24.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the company reported Thursday (August 5).   Observers ascribed the income collapse to market competition with rival ATI Technologies Inc.   The company made its income on revenue was $456.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, which compared to $459.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue for the six months ended July 25, 2004 was $928.0 million, compared to revenue of $864.8 million for the six months ended July 27, 2003.   Net income for the six months ended July 25, 2004 was $26.5 million compared to net income of $43.9 million for the six months ended July 27, 2003.   "Q2 was challenging and disappointing as the desktop GPU segment declined significantly as a result of several unusual market events," said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. "A major highlight, however, was shipping significant volumes of our GeForce 6800, the industry's first Shader Model 3.0 GPU," he added.

The Taiwanese backend today reported that Q2 consolidated net revenues were approximately $597.4 million (20.3 billion new Taiwanese dollars), up 59 percent year over year and 18 percent sequentially.  It was the highest quarterly revenue mark in the company's 20-year history.  Net income for the quarter totaled approximately $58.9 million (2 billion NT), up 461 percent year over year and up 23 percent sequentially. Earnings per share were 55 cents NT, or 82 cents per American Depositary Share.  The company didn't offer specific guidance for the current quarter in its earnings press release, ASE said it has faith in the fundamentals at the moment.   ''Despite the weak sentiment in the market recently, we believe the fundamentals of our business model remain solid and the gap between ASE and our competitors has been and will continue to widen given our effective strategy implementation," Jason Chang, ASE chairman, said in a statement. "We will continue to execute our business plan with extreme caution and therefore maintain our positive outlook for the quarters to come.''   The company is confident in reaching its goal of 50 percent revenue growth for all of 2004, Chang said. Revenues generated from ASE's packaging business in Q2 were up $376.7 million (12.8 billion NT) in the quarter, up 41 percent year over year and 8 percent sequentially. The sequential growth came primarily from volume increase and improved average selling price (ASP) as the result of product mix changes, the company said.   BGA and other substrate-based packaging accounted for 46 percent of total IC packaging revenue, while leadframe-based packaging accounted for 29 percent, and flip-chip packaging accounted for 10 percent.Testing service revenues for the quarter were $120.7 million (4.1 billion NT), up 49 percent year over year and 20 percent sequentially. The increase came mainly from volume growth; ASPs remained relatively stable from Q1, the company said.

       Max Wang, Taipei; Jessie Shen, DigiTimes.com [Monday 9 August 2004]    Airoha Technology, an affiliate of BenQ, has forecast its 2005 revenues will hit NT$500-600 million, up more than three-fold from its revenue estimate this year, according to the company president Michael Lu.  This estimate is based on the anticipated impact of the company’s new RF modules, which should boost the company’s total single-chip WLAN RF shipments in the fourth quarter to 500,000-600,000 units, with a month-on-month rise of 160,000-170,000 from its current 100,000 units.  The RF transceiver design house has now begun sampling its latest 802.11b RF module, which it introduced last week. In addition, Lu indicated that mass shipments of its handset-use 802.11g RF modules will start in the fourth quarter.  Airoha also recently completed development of integrated single-chip transceivers, with embedded power amplifiers (PAs), for a range of RF applications based on the 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11a/g standards, Lu stated.  The company is gearing up to develop a new single-chip quad-band GSM/GPRS/WCDMA RF IC for use in mobile phones, with a tentative launch date set for the third quarter of 2005, according to company chairman Rick Lei.

      Charles Chou, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Friday 6 August 2004]    Nvidia is teaming up with Asustek Computer, Gigabyte Technology, Micro-Star International (MSI) and AOpen to bundle Nvidia PCI Express graphics cards with 915P and 915G motherboards from the respective companies, according to market sources.  The move comes on the tail of a recent sales campaign by ATI and Intel to bundle ATI-based graphics cards with Intel’s own-brand motherboards.  Nvidia will bundle its GeForce PCX5750- and PCX5900-based PCIe-enabled graphics cards with 915P and 915G motherboards from the makers, the sources noted. Nvidia will offer a discount similar to that of the ATI-Intel package, the sources added.  However, Taiwan motherboard makers still have doubts the strategy will effectively boost sales of PCIe graphics cards and motherboards since the discounts will not be large enough to offset the relatively high prices of 915/925 chipsets, socket LGA775 connectors, and DDR2 memory modules.

       By Peter Clarke  Silicon Strategies 08/05/2004, 2:00 $Ä ET         LONDON -- Sales at the top two foundry chip makers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), grew by about 37 percent 1H04 over 1H03 but TSMC grew by 46.3 percent 1Q04/1Q03 and UMC grew by 41.5 percent 1Q04/1Q03. This implies the leading foundries' sales growths 2Q04/2Q03 were considerably lower percentages than 37 percent.   The point is that the foundry market is growing fast -- but the growth rate has been slowing through the year. As such VLSI Research's 33 percent growth figure for the foundry market overall in 2004, looks bullish to me.   Meanwhile the semiconductor market overall grew by 32.3 percent 1Q04/1Q03 and by 40.3 percent 2Q04/2Q03 according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization (WSTS) and the United States Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which means that the top two foundries were at very considerably lower growth rates than the industry as a whole in the second quarter of 2004.   The growth figures are still high but that in itself tells us a couple of things and begs a question or two.   First a preamble then a question: in 2003 the foundries drove the semiconductor market scoring much higher growth on behalf of a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, while a lot of IDMs were still sorting out manufacturing strategy. So who is achieving the phenomenal sales growth in 2004 that is driving the WSTS figure of 40.3 percent growth year-on-year for the second quarter of 2004. Intel's second quarter, which because of Intel's size is a large proportion of the market, was only up 18 percent.   What such high growth figures must also indicate is that can surely be no more upside. We cannot expect to see even higher growth for the chip market in the third quarter, at some point the Asia-Pacific region, which is driving the overall market, has to cool. And the ordering of the numbers, with the general market ahead of the foundry market, suggests that the foundries are leading the market; this time into the second half of the growth phase during which absolute market size continues to increase but growth rates diminish.   The nagging question remains as to where are the published results of companies of significant size to drive second quarter 2004 market figures of 40.3 percent growth.

       Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/6/2004    Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp. saw revenue slip and net income plummet in Q2, just six weeks after rival ATI reported record revenues.  Revenue slid to $456.1 million during Q2 of fiscal 2005, compared to $459.8 million for the same period a year ago.  The net income drop was far more dramatic at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, falling to $5.1 million or 3 cents per share compared with $24.2 million or 14 cents per share for the same period last year.  "Q2 was challenging and disappointing as the desktop GPU segment declined significantly as a result of several unusual market events," stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO, in a statement.   The news from Nvidia stood in stark contrast to rival ATI's earnings announcement in June when that company announced record revenue and tripled net income for its fiscal Q3.  At that time ATI's CEO said its big gains were a matter of timing. By delivering on PCI Express, the company experienced a broad swath of design wins from OEMs.  Nvidia suffered in the wake of that swath. Still, Huang pained a positive picture going forward.  "A major highlight [in Q2] was shipping significant volumes of our GeForce 6800, the industry's first Shader Model 3.0 GPU," he said. "We have once again taken the technology lead with GeForce 6 and are aggressively driving it deeper into the mainstream and value desktop, notebook and professional business segments. Our bold strategy to bring a fundamentally new architecture to the PCI Express transition has resulted in winning key design wins in each segment."

      Jack Lu [Friday 6 August 2004]    Infineon will transfer its 90nm DRAM process technology and 12-inch fab production expertise to Winbond Electronics, the two companies announced today.  The two firms will use the technology to develop low-power SDRAM and pseudo SRAM (PSRAM). They may also, at some point, use it to develop flash memory, according to Mike Liu, public relations manager at Winbond.  Winbond can use the technology on either 8- or 12-inch wafers, according to Regine Liu, a manager with Infineon Technologies Taiwan. Winbond will also acquire Infineon’s assistance in planning fabrication and in the capacity ramp of its 12-inch fab in Taichung.  In addition, Winbond will reserve a portion of the fab’s capacity for Infineon and will pay license fees and royalties to the Germany-based chipmaker.  Infineon will not fund construction of Winbond’s 12-inch fab, both companies reiterated.  Winbond broke ground for the 12-inch fab in late July and expects to begin mass production in the first quarter of 2006. The fab will have a monthly capacity of 24,000 wafers by the end of 2006 and double that figure in 2007.  The announcement extends the two firms’ relationship. Winbond currently produces commodity DRAM with Infineon’s 0.11-micron technology at its 8-inch fab.

      By Mark LaPedus  Silicon Strategies 08/18/2004, 3:55 $Ä ET          NEW YORK — Applied Materials Inc. beat Wall Street's expectations for its third-quarter results on Tuesday (August 17, 2004), but analysts were disappointed with the company's outlook.   "Applied Materials (on Tuesday) reported July quarter orders of $2.46 billion, up 11 percent sequentially, beating our expectation of up 5 percent and guidance of up 5-10 percent," said Cristina Osmena, an analyst with Jefferies & Co., an investment banking firm in New York.   "October quarter order guidance is for 5 percent growth, also better than our expectation, though generally in-line with consensus," Osmena said in a report issued Wednesday (August 18, 2004). "We believe that the order upside in the July quarter was driven by the flat panel display business and the growth of the service business while silicon systems orders came in line with company targets."   There is bad news for Applied. "July quarter revenue and EPS was also better than expected," she said. "More importantly, October quarter guidance calls for revenue growth of 0-5 percent while EPS should be flat to down, in the range of $0.24 to $0.26, below consensus of $0.27," she said.   "For the first time in several quarters, consensus will have to be revised down," she said. "The company is attributing its stall in margin expansion to mix. We believe that additional service revenue streams forged through recent agreements and recent and future acquisitions have yet to conform to the company's target profits."   As a result, Osmena is lowering her estimate slightly for fiscal 2005 and raising the estimate slightly for fiscal 2004.

      By Mark LaPedus  Silicon Strategies 08/19/2004, 11:45 $ ET  SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Amid a major shift towards 90-nm technology on 300-mm wafers, Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) is quietly "engaging" customers with its new and unannounced 65-nm process.   UMC has been developing its 65-nm technology for some time, and now, the company appears to be talking to customers about making chips based on the process. "We're engaging with customers [for our 65-nm process]," said Kuen Chow, vice president of field applications engineering for UMC, the world's second largest foundry vendor.   During an interview at the Foundry Suppliers Forum on Wednesday (Aug. 18) here Chow declined to comment on the specifics of UMC's 65-nm process. Observers speculate the Taiwanese foundry company will deploy copper-interconnects, ultra low-k, and other technologies for the 65-nm node.   Leading-edge chip companies plan to sample their 65-nm chips as early as the first half of 2005. Foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) is also engaging with customers with its 65-nm process technology, with products expected to be shipped in the first half of next year--or earlier. Volumes for 65-nm products are not expected until 2006, according to TSMC (see June 11 story).   For once, UMC agrees with its foundry competitor. "65-nm will be in mass production in 2006," Chow said.   While UMC is developing its 65-nm process, the company is also making a big push for 90-nm technology on 300-mm wafers. "Our 90-nm fabs are in mass production," he said during a presentation at the Foundry Suppliers Forum, which was sponsored by the Fabless Semiconductor Association.   UMC plans to expand its 300-mm capacity, from about 20,000 wafers a month right now, to 30,000 by year's end, he said. The company has two 300-mm fabs, including one in Taiwan (Fab 12A) and another in Singapore (UMCi).

      Hans Wu, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Thursday 19 August 2004]    Hynix Semiconductor plans to boost NAND flash output to 16 million 512Mbit-equivalent units per month by the end of this year, more than doubling monthly output from 6 million units currently, according to company sources.  Hynix headquarters has not responded to an inquiry for comment.  The sources claimed that the South Korea-based chipmaker is aiming to overtake Toshiba as the second largest NAND flash supplier by shipment by the first half of 2005.  To gain more customers, Hynix is quoting its NAND flash more competitively than is Samsung Electronics, according to sources at Taiwan’s IC distributors.  According to a December 2003 iSuppli report, Toshiba held a 36% share of the global NAND flash market last year.

      By Peter Clarke  Silicon Strategies 08/18/2004, 1:09 $Ä ET     HSINCHU, Taiwan — Revenue for the second quarter 2004 at chip test and assembly company ChipMOS Technologies (Bermuda) Ltd. was US$128 million or NT$4,323 million, an increase of 86 percent from US$69 million or NT$2,329 million for the same period in 2003, the company said Wednesday (Aug 18). The second quarters's increase from first quarter 2004 sales of US$92 million or NT$3,090 million was 40 percent.   However, the company put the strong growth down, partially, to inventory building and predicted that sales would fall in the third quarter to between $115 million and $120 million, before growth resumes in the fourth quarter.   Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was US$19 million or NT$642 million compared to a net income of US$3 million or NT$106 million for the same period in 2003 and net income of US$16 million or NT$539 million for the first quarter of 2004.   "Our results for the second quarter were above our guidance, building on the growth we experienced in the first quarter and reflecting select inventory building in the market during the second quarter," said S.J. Cheng, chairman and chief executive officer of ChipMOS, in a statement.   "Demand remained strong for our testing services for memory semiconductors, in particular DRAM and flash memory semiconductors," he also said.

      By Mark LaPedus  Silicon Strategies 08/18/2004, 5:55 $Ä ET     STERLING, Va. — By 2011, the market for next-generation, nonvolatile memories will be worth $65.7 billion, according to a new report from research firm NanoMarkets LC on Wednesday (August 18, 2004).   The figure includes a raft of new technologies, such as MRAM, FRAM, holographic memory, ovonic unified memory, molecular memory, nanotube RAM, MEMS-based memory and polymer memory, according to the Sterling-based firm.   "DRAM, SRAM and flash will continue to exist for decades," according to the report. "But with powerful backers such as AMD, Cypress Semiconductor, Freescale, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell, Hitachi, IBM, Infineon, Intel, Matsushita, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments, nanostorage seems certain to take a big bite out of the conventional memory and disk business."   New memory technologies are disruptive for the disk-drive and related industries. By 2011, next-generation nonvolatile memories, called nanostorage technology by NanoMarkets, will have penetrated close to 40 percent of the disk drive and memory chip businesses, which by then are expected to total $166 billion in revenue.   In total, the next-generation, nonvolatile memory market is expected to grow from $97 million in 2004, to $17.9 billion in 2008, to $65.7 billion by 2011, according to the firm.   The MRAM market is expected to grow from $2 million in 2004, to $3.8 billion in 2008, to $12.9 billion by 2011, according to the firm. The FRAM market is expected to grow from $95 million in 2004, to $1.3 billion in 2008, to $4.5 billion by 2011, according to the firm.   The holographic memory market is expected to grow from $3.3 billion in 2008, to $6.9 billion by 2011, according to the firm. The ovonic unified memory market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2008, to $4.8 billion by 2011, according to the firm.   The molecular memory market is expected to grow from $1.4 billion in 2008, to $7.2 billion by 2011, according to the firm. The nanotube memory market is expected to grow from $1.9 billion in 2008, to $8.9 billion by 2011, according to the firm.   The MEMS-based systems market is expected to grow from $2.1 billion in 2008, to $6.5 billion by 2011, according to the firm. The polymer memory market is expected to grow from $1.4 billion in 2008, to $7.9 billion by 2011, according to the firm.

      By Mark LaPedus  Silicon Strategies 08/18/2004, 7:05 $Ä ET     SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The semiconductor industry is on track to grow 30 percent in 2004, but there are signs that the IC-equipment business is slowing based on projected book-to-bill figures, according to a report from VLSI Research Inc. on Wednesday (August 18, 2004).   The IC industry is projected to hit $182.2 billion in 2004, up 30 percent from 2003, according to VLSI Research. This matches the previous forecast for the Santa Clara-based research firm.   "VLSI's current IC forecast takes into account a mild pause in 2H04, as the supply chain digests inventories and deals with slowing demand due to increased energy prices," according to the report. "VLSI does not see this turning into a full-blown crash because inventories are not in excess like they were in 2000 and there are no economic factors compounding gas prices."   At the same time, the semiconductor equipment industry is also on track to grow between 60-to-70 percent in 2004, according to VLSI. "This is much higher than the 40 percent forecast VLSI released in December 2003, which again many considered too optimistic," the report said. "The current equipment forecast even factors in a slowdown in sales during 2H04 as the industry takes a breather from overheating in 1H04."   Still, there are some mixed signals in the market, especially with the book-to-bill ratio in the fab-tool sector. In the first quarter of 2004, for example, the worldwide fab-tool, book-to-bill was 1.06, with fab-capacity utilization reaching 93.7 percent, according to VLSI.   In the second quarter, the preliminary fab-tool, book-to-bill is projected to reach 1.12, with fab-capacity utilization hitting 98.9 percent, according to VLSI.   In the third quarter, the fab-tool, book-to-bill is projected to fall to 1.07, with fab-capacity utilization hitting 93.3 percent, according to VLSI. And in the fourth quarter, the fab-tool, book-to-bill is projected to fall to 0.84, with fab-capacity utilization hitting 95.6 percent, according to VLSI

      휴렛패커드(HP)의 연구개발(R&D) 전략이 바뀌고 있다.  급변하는 하이테크 시장 환경에 맞춰 기초 연구 투자는 줄이고 대신 단기간에 성과를 낼 수 있는 분야에 집중하고 있다.  17일 아시안월스트리트저널(AWSJ)는  이 때문에 HP의 연구개발 슬로건이  기존의 ‘창조하라(Invent)’에서 ‘현명하게 창조하라(invent wisely)’는  것으로 바뀔 형편이라고 전했다.  HP 연구개발 전략의 변화를 웅변해주는 일화가 있다.  5년전 HP 연구소(랩)는 휴대폰, 카메라 같은 전력 소모가 적은 디지털 기기(디바이스)용 데이터 스토리지 연구에 착수,  신물질을 개발하는 등 혁혁한 성과를 거두었다. 하지만 이 프로젝트는 2003년 중반 갑자기 중단됐다.  이에 대해 HP연구소를 이끄는 딕 램프먼은 “다른 기업들의 스토리지 기술 발전이 우리가 예상한 것보다 빨랐다”며  당시 프로젝트가 시의성을 상실했음을 솔직하게 자인했다.  최근 부진한 분기(3분기) 실적을 발표한 HP는 주가가 추락하는 등 다른 컴퓨터업체에 비해 어려운 처지에 놓여 있다.       PC시장에서는 HP와 달리 기초 연구에 큰 돈을 들이지 않는 델과 격전을 벌이고 있으며  연구개발 능력이 필요한 하이엔드 분야에서는 IBM과도 버거운 싸움을 벌이고 있다.  IBM은 데이터 스토리지서 부터 반도체까지 끊임없이 투자해야 하는 첨단분야에서  HP와 경쟁하고 있는데 연구개발 비용이 HP보다 10억달러 이상 많다.  연구 개발능력을 수익성이 높은 프로젝트에 집중하기 시작한 HP의 혁신 노력은  전략 및 기술부(Office of Strategy and Technology)라는 부서가 주도하고 있다.  이 부서의 사령탑은 컴팩 출신인 세인 로빈슨 이라는 HP 최고기술임원(CTO)이 맡고 있다.  그는 HP와 협력을 원하는 중소기업들이 혁신적 아이디어를 HP에 제안할 수 있는 창구를 만들었고  HP 직원들도 전화로 혁신적 아이디어를 제시 할 수 있도록 핫라인을 개설했다.  HP는 앞으로 보안, 관리 소프트웨어, 디지털 엔터테인먼트 등 3개 분야에 연구력을 집중할 계획이다.  대신 마이크로프로세서 칩 같은 콤포넌트 연구는 중단할 예정인데  이를 위해 기초 연구직은 크게 줄이는 대신 소프트웨어 전문가들을 다수 고용했다.  HP의 이같은 노력은 일면 IBM에서 아이디어를 차용한 것으로 추정되는데  루 거스터는 IBM CEO로 부임 했을때 기초 연구비를 줄이고 단기간에 성과를 낼 수 있는 프로젝트에 집중한 바 있다.   HP의 단기적인 연구개발 전략에 대해 비판적인 시각도 있다. 하지만 로빈슨은 ”하이테크 시장이 너무 빨리 변하기 때문에 혁신도 단기 비즈니스에서 성과를 내는 쪽으로 조정돼야 한다”고 말하고 있다.  방은주기자@전자신문,  urlLink ejbang@etnews.co.kr

      Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/17/2004   AMD today formally announced it is achieving a smooth transition to 90nm manufacturing and has shipped low-power 90nm Mobile AMD Athlon 64 processors for thin and light notebooks.  The shipment of the MPU, previously codenamed “Oakville," follows a report from stock brokerage firm, Goldman Sachs that AMD was ahead in the 90nm race. Notebooks with the new 90nm Mobile AMD Athlon 64 processors are expected in the coming months.  Further, AMD said it is indeed on track with its plans to deliver 90nm dual-core products mid-next year and is also seeing operational benefits such as increased production capacities, i.e., reductions in chip sizes and more processors on the same sized wafer, as a result of moving to 90nm process technology.  “We promised 90 nanometer revenue shipments in the third quarter, and today we’re delivering on that promise. The added capacity resulting from our efficient transition to 90 nanometer manufacturing enables AMD to better serve the growing ranks of AMD64 customers,” said Dirk Meyer, executive VP of the computation products group at AMD, in a statement.  The company said it expects to ship 90nm AMD Athlon 64 processors for desktop systems later this quarter, followed by 90nm AMD Opteron processor shipments later this year, with further details to follow.  In addition to benefiting today’s products, AMD said using 90nm process technology better positions it to deliver dual-core processors mid-next year through 90nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process enhancements for higher performance, lower power transistors. Those transistors can be integrated into new dual-core designs, allowing AMD to deliver dual-core processors that meet aggressive performance targets, the company said. Also, since 90nm transistors are much smaller and more power efficient than their 130nm predecessors, it allows for greater transistor densities within chips and better enables AMD to integrate additional components, including a second core and other improvements, on the same chip without a dramatic increase to chip size. Finally, AMD’s Automated Precision Manufacturing capabilities provide a high-yield 90nm manufacturing capability required for the increased fabrication complexities of dual-core designs, the company said.

      Online staff -- Electronic News, 8/17/2004   Even though worldwide PC shipments remain on track to grow 12.6 percent this year, or 185 million units, the latest estimates reveal a greater potential for downside, according to a preliminary Q3 forecast by Gartner Inc., based in Stamford, Conn.   In Q2, Gartner projected worldwide PC shipments to increase 13.4 percent this year, but recent U.S. economic data increases the uncertainty of the PC market’s performance in the second half, according to Kiyomi Yamada, analyst for client platforms research at Gartner.  “Any economic downturn would be felt in both the business and home PC markets. However, we believe that the most likely outcome is for the market to register double-digit growth in 2004,” Yamada said in a statement.  Further, the ongoing buildup of older PCs in the installed base has continued to apply strong replacement pressure, with PC users, “sitting on an aging installed base that remains ripe for replacement. So long as economic conditions remain supportive, we believe users will respond, but the recent run-up in oil prices and talk of a U.S. economic ‘soft patch’ increase the possibility that this replacement cycle could be undercut by external events,” added George Shiffler, principal analyst for client platforms research at Gartner, in the statement.

      By Mark LaPedus  Silicon Strategies 08/17/2004, 12:40 $Ä ET         NEW YORK — Semiconductor stocks remain depressed in the marketplace, including those in the booming silicon foundry sector.   Cristina Osmena, an analyst with Jefferies & Co., an investment banking firm in New York, initiated coverage — and put separate "hold" ratings — on foundry rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC).   In addition, one of China's first foundries, CSMC Technologies Corp., suffered an opening day setback for its initial public offering in Hong Kong last Friday (Aug. 13), affected by an overall slump in technology shares and a more cautious view of the China foundry market (see Aug. 16 story).   TSMC, the world's largest silicon foundry vendor, is expected to earn $0.60 per ADS in 2004 and $0.65 per ADS in 2005, Osmena said in a report, which was issued on Tuesday (Aug. 17).   "We are initiating coverage on TSMC with a rating of 'hold' and a price target of $6.70, essentially in line with the current share price, based on three times book value per share," she said.   TSMC's stock price reflects the company's defensive strategy. "Since the company has adopted a new focus [initiated during the downturn] of generating a return on equity, it has added capacity more rationally, ceding market share during an environment of tight utilization," she said.   "As utilization eases, we expect share to migrate back to TSMC, given its superior process technology," she added. "TSMC, in our opinion, is a defensive play during times of sector decline and should perform better than its peer group."   Meanwhile, Chinese foundry startup SMIC is expected to earn $0.33 per ADS in 2004 and $0.49 per ADS in 2005, Osmena said. "We are initiating coverage on SMIC with a rating of Hold and a and a price target of $8.80, down slightly from the current share price, based on 1 times projected book value per share," she said.   "SMIC is the up-and-comer foundry, growing share to the fourth largest among pure-play foundries only two years after generating revenues," she said. "SMIC, in our opinion, is an upturn play and stands to benefit from the buildout of technology infrastructure in China and the high growth of indigenous demand in that nation."   The foundry vendor faces some challenges, however. "Meanwhile, this newly formed company faces the burden of increased depreciation costs during a potentially challenging year. Dependence on long-term IDM contract business has yet to be tested by a downturn," she added.

      By Bill McClean, IC Insights  Silicon Strategies 08/17/2004, 12:00 $ ET          The following column was provided by Bill McClean, president of IC Insights Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based market research firm.   Over the past few months there have been varied opinions expressed by many analysts and industry trade groups regarding the 2005 IC market outlook. This is the first of a two-part article that will plot past IC industry cycles and discuss macro trends, external and internal to the IC industry, to determine what they can tell us about the possible path of the current cycle.    It is interesting to note that at the present time there are no industry associations (e.g., the SIA, WSTS, etc.) or market research companies known to us that are predicting a higher IC market growth rate for 2005 than for 2004. Thus, it appears that everyone believes 2004 will be the peak growth-rate year for the IC industry in the current cycle.   IC Insights believes now is the time to discuss some of the semantics creeping into discussions of "peak years" in the current IC industry cycle. Some have recently stated that 2005, not 2004, will be the peak year of the current cycle. In all of these cases it should be noted that the speaker is talking about peak total IC dollar volume and not the peak IC market growth rate.   Thus, if the IC industry grew 1 percent in 2005, and declined in 2006, some would consider 2005 the peak year of the current cycle based on dollar volume. Be careful of this type of interpretation, it can be misleading.   IC Industry Cycle History   Although each of the past IC industry cycles had their own particular characteristics (e.g., duration, magnitude of increase and decrease, etc.), Figure 1 shows the similar pattern all have exhibited. In every one of the past five industry cycles, once the peak growth-rate year was registered, the best IC industry growth rate the following year was only 11 percent (with 2001 exhibiting the worst decline, 33 percent).    Even more interesting is what the history of the IC industry cycles reveals about the second year after the peak growth-rate year. In every past IC industry cycle, the IC market registered growth (typically low single-digit growth) in the second year after the peak year! If the current cycle follows the pattern of the past five cycles, 2006 will be a growth year and not a year when the IC market declines.      As shown in Figure 1, in three of the last five cycles, the second year after the peak year registered better growth than the first year after the peak. However, in two cases (i.e., the 79-82 and 87-90 cycles), second year post-peak growth was less than in the first year.   What this illustrates is that if you have a "soft landing" (i.e., a market increase and not a decline) in the first year after the peak growth year, you are likely to have an even softer second year (but still not negative). However, if the IC market "takes its medicine" in the first year after the peak and experiences a decline, the second year is likely to demonstrate better (although single-digit) market growth.   At the present time, everyone basically agrees that the long-term average annual growth rate for the IC industry over the next 10 years is very likely to be between 8-12 percent. When the IC market grows at a rate that is more than twice this average (e.g., 2004's expected 31 percent increase), there must be a period of time when the market grows at a similar rate below the average. The phrase that comes to mind when describing the IC market "adjustment period" after a peak growth rate year is, "pay me now or pay me later!" But, rest assured, there will be a payback.      IC Insights believes that the current IC industry cycle will be similar in "shape" to past cycles, and that 2005 will be the first "correction" year in the present cycle. We could conform to others and attempt to convince ourselves that things are going to be different this time.   However, IC Insights cannot identify a single historical precedent pointing toward a strong (i.e., greater than 11 percent) 2005 IC market. There is good news, however, in that there is also no historical precedent for 2006 being a negative growth year for the IC industry!   Let's face it, nobody's crystal ball is perfect and IC Insights will be the first to admit that just because something has never happened in the past does not mean it cannot happen in the future. However, a large amount of data currently point to a weak IC market in 2005 (single-digit growth at best) followed by moderate IC market growth in 2006. Part 2 of this article will present a detailed analysis of the some of the critical data shaping the current IC industry cycle..stay tuned!   This article is based upon data extracted from IC Insights' Mid-year Update of The McClean Report. Further information regarding this report and IC Insights can be found on the IC Insights' Web Site.

      China’s total exports and imports of IT products for the first seven months of this year reached US$170.26 billion, a year-on-year rise of 48.7%, according to statistics released by China’s Ministry of Commerce, as reported by the Chinese-language People’s Daily Online.  Hong Kong, US and the European Union have been the top-three markets for China’s exports this year, while the majority of imports came from Japan, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.  The seven-month IT export/import value accounted for 27.3% of China’s total export/import value of US$623.0 billion. The Chinese language Xinhua News Agency quoted the Ministry of Commerce as predicting that the total export/import value for this year will grow from the US$851.0 billion posted in 2003 to more than US$1 trillion.

      Charles Chou, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Tuesday 17 August 2004]    A battle for the PCIe GPU (graphics processing unit) channel market between ATI Technologies and Nvidia looms in the fourth quarter, despite an ATI claim that it has delivered over one million native PCIe GPUs to the market, according to sources at Taiwan graphics card makers.  ATI said in a press release last week that shipments of its native PCIe chips have topped the one million mark since they were launched on June 1, helping speed the industry transition to PCI Express.  However, sources at the makers stated that channel sales of ATI PCIe chips have not gone well. The company gave priority to PC OEMs and system integrators, so the supply in the channel has been limited.  This has allowed rival Nvidia, which recently launched a native PCIe-enabled GPU, the GeForce 6600 (codenamed NV43), a chance to compete effectively with ATI in the channel, the source said.  In the fourth quarter, Nvidia plans to launch its NV44-series of native PCIe-enabled chips, which will target the US$79-99 graphics card segment and should give a boost to the sales of Nvidia’s PCIe chips, the sources added.

      Josephine Lien, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Tuesday 17 August 2004]    Spot prices for DRAM and NAND flash will recover slightly after reaching year-low levels in late August of US$3.50-4.00 for DRAM and US$9-10 for 1Gbit NAND flash, according to an August 16 report by Merrill Lynch.  “Although the latest price trend was a bit weaker than our expectations, we believe the worst is now almost in its final stages, due mainly to supply constraints,” the US-based equity investment firm said in the report.  The firm argued that this year’s seasonal outlook for DRAM is better than last year, as prices have already dropped significantly in late July and August. It predicts DRAM prices will increase in September since corporations are buying new PCs and PC OEMs are shipping PCs with more memory.  However, DRAM makers are now holding only 2-3 weeks of inventory, much lower than the historical 4-5 weeks.  Merrill Lynch also said that both Samsung Electronics and Toshiba are holding low inventory of NAND flash. Samsung now holds less than three weeks of inventory while Toshiba has no excess stock.

      Jimmy Hsu, Taipei; Adam Hwang, DigiTimes.com [Tuesday 17 August 2004]    Philips recently took action to protect its DVD+R patent rights by warning unlicensed disc makers in Taiwan and notifying customs agencies and distributors in Europe they should block imports from Taiwan makers who violate their patents, according to the warned makers.  Taiwan’s top producers of optical discs, including CMC Magnetics, Ritek and Prodisc Technology, are licensed to use Philips DVD+R technology, while second-tier and smaller makers are not licensed.  As Philips’ DVD+R patents also cover CD-R technology, there is some ambiguity about the DVD+R royalty claim. This is why disc makers are unwilling to pay the royalty, unlicensed Taiwan users explained.  Although Philips has not yet taken legal proceedings, Taiwan optical disc makers that have received a warning from the company are watching to see how the situation develops.  In a related development, Philips lost a CD-R/RW patent suit in the US in March of this year against Taiwan makers, which means the company may have difficulty trying to claim royalty payments for its CD-R/RW patents.

      By Peter Clarke  Silicon Strategies 08/16/2004, 11:00 $ ET     LONDON — Intel Corp. has delayed the release of liquid-crystal-on-silicon display technology, which it earlier touted as the basis of its entry into the microdisplay market in the second half of 2004, according to Internet reports.   The liquid crystal chip won't be released this year as scheduled, according to a Bloomberg report, which cited an Intel spokeswoman as its source. The Santa Clara, Calif.,-based company is holding back the chip until a better version is ready, the report quoted her as saying.   During the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Intel President and Chief Operating Officer Paul Otellini demonstrated liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) technology and revealed that Intel had code-named it "Cayley".   "We are new to this business, and the LCOS digital segment is still in the early stages," the report quoted the spokeswoman as saying. The report added that Intel is waiting until it has an improved LCOS chip better than its rivals before releasing it to the market.   Philips Electronics and numerous startup companies are already touting liquid crystal on silicon technology.

      Emma Wang, Taipei; Steve Shen, DigiTimes.com [Monday 16 August 2004]    Unit sales of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Athlon 64 (K8) processors are expected to grow 50% sequentially in the second half of this year, according to sources at Taiwan motherboard and chipset makers.  Improved yield rates for K8 processors and AMD’s recent price cuts, about 20% on average, for the Athlon 64 processor lineup, are two key factors driving second-half sales, stated the sources.  Unit sales of K8-based motherboards accounted for only about 5% of total motherboards sold in the first half because AMD was unable to improve the yield rate of the K8 processor, and the prices of the CPUs were relatively high, the sources said.  However, the sources noted that sales of K8 processors started gaining momentum in July and should continue to expand at a rapid pace in August, following the July 26 price cuts.  VIA Technologies, a supplier of K8 chipsets, is expected to benefit from the rising sales of the K8 platform, boosting shipments of its K8 chipsets to 10% of its total chipset shipments in the fourth quarter, compared to a single-digit rate in the first half, according to sources at VIA.

      Online Staff -- Electronic News, 8/12/2004   The U.S. federal government has approved $1.5 million in funding for embedded passives research and the development test bed project, the IPC--Association Connecting Electronics Industries said today.     Prior to adjourning for summer recess, the House and Senate finalized the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense Appropriations Act that includes $1.5 million for the Emerging/Critical Interconnection Technology (E/CIT) program, which included the test bed and embedded passives project. President Bush has already signed the bill, and the funding will become available at the start of the federal fiscal year in October.  The E/CIT program is an industry/government partnership established in 2002 to strengthen the abilities of both the Department of Defense and the U.S. PCB industry to support the military’s unique PCB requirements, according to IPC. It is the third year the group has successfully lobbied Congress for funding for the program, the trade group said.  E/CIT program activity is coordinated through the Printed Circuit Technology Branch of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, located in Crane, Ind. IPC is the lead industry advocate on the E/CIT program and coordinates the congressional funding requests and lobbying effort to secure funding for the program.

      by Alex Wolfe, VARBusiness  Silicon Strategies 08/13/2004, 7:00 $ ET          AMD chairman, president and CEO Hector Ruiz has been engineering a stunning turnaround since his company hit tough financial times in the last three months of 2002, when it reported a net loss of $854 million.   Simply put, Ruiz has taken a semiconductor maker that was viewed mainly as a provider of lower-cost alternatives to Intel's microprocessors and propelled it to the forefront of the 64-bit revolution with the innovative AMD64 architecture and its Opteron server and Athlon 64 desktop CPUs.   Buoyed by strong demand for those chips and for flash memory, AMD last month reported second-quarter sales of $1.26 billion and a profit of $32 million. The news marked AMD's third consecutive profitable quarter.   Ruiz, who holds a doctorate in electronics, joined AMD in 2000, after serving as president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector.   VARBusiness talked to Ruiz recently to find out how he intends to fend off new competition from Intel, which recently released its first processor targeted at Opteron in the form of the new "Nancona" Xeon processor.   VB: What's your message to AMD's Opteron VARs in light of the new competition from Intel?   Ruiz: I would view it as great news to have this additional competition. It will just strengthen the 64-bit ecosystem, and it's a great time for VARs to get involved.   VB: How do you see the 64-bit landscape changing over the next six months and the next year?   Ruiz: A good question. You know, two years ago there was no 64 bits anywhere in the enterprise. Nothing at all. And we've gone in two years to where Tier 1 manufacturers, such as IBM, Sun and HP, and others, have signed up. I don't think there's any question in anybody's mind that the enterprise from an OEM perspective is moving and offering great products, and that's only going to accelerate.   The other part of that is end users"the financial companies, the oil exploration people"are now on board. They're pulling hard on our OEM suppliers to start delivering products. So the enterprise momentum for 64 bits is going to accelerate.   Today, we're at about a 5 percent share of the enterprise [for Opteron servers]. I expect a year from now we're going to have a double digit share in the enterprise. I also believe that the trickle-down effect will accelerate to the client. So a year from now, we expect to start seeing the first enterprise applications of 64-bit clients.   VB: When you talk about the client side, you're referring to your Athlon 64 desktop processor. Will that ramp up rapidly once the 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows XP is released early next year?   Ruiz: We intend to capitalize on the fact that this is a major product launch for Microsoft. It's a major opportunity for us to use the tremendous market power they have to get the message of AMD64 out to the consumer and to users of client products.   VB: You've had major success getting three of the four big Tier 1s"HP, IBM, and Sun"to adopt Opteron. Any message for Dell, which so far hasn't?   Ruiz: They're a great company. We still feel like we need to continue working with them, because I believe that it's in the best interest of their customers for Dell to offer that solution. And we don't give up.   VB: We've talked to a number of VARs. Some of them are happy with your reseller support for AMD64. But one or two said that support has fallen off since AMD's layoffs in early 2003. How would you respond?   Ruiz: Well, anytime anyone feels that way, we're incredibly disappointed. We have more effort going on in our AMD64 technology than we've ever had on any technology in the company. Maybe never enough, from the perspective of some of our VARs, but we're absolutely committed. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to put whatever resources were necessary to cover any perceived service issues. So, on the one hand, I'm disappointed to hear it. On the other hand, I'm glad they're telling you and me, and I'm hoping somebody in the organization has heard that.   VB: You've succeeded in getting AMD back on a solid footing. How will you maintain the company's forward progress?   Ruiz: Without a doubt, we believe we're the masters of our destiny, the architects of our future. We're very focused on execution, very focused on the roadmaps we have. There's a lot of noise in the industry from the competition in this area, [but] frankly it's turbulence. I think my task here is to make sure the organization stays totally focused on the plans and strategies that we've put together over the past couple of years.

      Silicon Strategies 08/13/2004, 10:00 $ ET      LONDON -- PC processor maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has begun to ship processors made using 90-nanometer manufacturing processes to notebook customers, according to reports that cite a note written to clients by investment firm Goldman Sachs.   Desktop computer makers are expected to receive 90-nm SOI silicon from AMD in a month's time.   The move was expected as AMD said it had started manufacturing on its 90-nm manufacturing process on April 19 and that it planned to start shipping 90-nm products to customers in the third quarter of 2004.   A high-end notebook chip code-named Odessa, a part of AMD's Opteron family, is expected to be AMD's first 90-nanometer chip, followed by San Diego and Winchester for desktops

      Josephine Lien and Hans Wu, Taipei; Jack Lu, DigiTimes.com [Friday 13 August 2004]    Current price trends will push spot prices for 1Gbit NAND flash below US$10 by the end of this month, said sources at IC distributors in Taiwan.  Traders now speculate whether Samsung Electronics can continue maintaining its contract prices at US$13 since new entrants are offering NAND flash at more competitive prices.  With the price of NAND flash trending down, module makers may need to write off more inventory losses this quarter, sources noted. Module makers in Taiwan have been expanding their flash-related sales in order to move away from DRAM products, which they believe are more volatile and less profitable.  Transcend Information, Taiwan’s second-largest memory-module maker, expects flash to account for 30% of its sales this year, according to company president Peter Shu.  Prices for 1Gbit chips have already slipped 12% in one month, according to DRAMeXchange. Spot prices for 1Gbit chips made with stack technology were quoted at US$10.40 yesterday, while other 1Gbit parts were at US$10.50.
