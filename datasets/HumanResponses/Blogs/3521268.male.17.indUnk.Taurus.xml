       Free Four   One, two, free, four  The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom And talk to yourself as you die  Life is a short, warm moment And death is a long cold rest You get your chance to try In the twinkling of an eye Eighty years with luck, or even less  So all aboard for the American tour, And maybe you'll make it to the top And mind how you go I can tell you, because I know You may find it hard to get off  You are the angel of death And I am the dead man's son And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole And everyone's still in the run And who is the master of fox hounds? And who says the hunt has begun? And who calls the tune in the courtroom? And who beats the funeral drum?  The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom And talk to yourself as you die   I really love Pink Floyd, just recently I listened to an album I had heard little from before, simply because it is also a movie soundtrack and the songs are pretty hard to find. But, to my surprise, this album (Obscured By Clouds) rules, it was like Christmas again... in June. Free Four is a song from that album, it also rules, as does Pink Floyd except for when after Roger left... they still ruled, but not as much.

      grad prom thingie is tomorrow... that's almost today!! There's so much to do and I'm so unprepared!! This is supposed to be an important night where we all get to look stupid and feel fancier and more important than we really are or will really ever be. Its all so fake, shallow and one-dimensional. Not that pretty much everything else isn't, music is crap, work is crap, news media and pretty much anything anyone says is crap. Am I the only one I can really trust? I'd like to think no, but I know its true, everyone has their spin on things, almost everyone puts their own slant on anything they say. Where is the truth? Is it what I want it to be? Or will I find it through meditation? Or is it through fulfilling my own goals? Or even money and power? Fuck... I really shouldn't have taken philosophy...  I'll just go listen to my mom's "Best of Styx" tape...    come sail away, come sail away, comesailaway with meeeeeeee

      so, now that I have my driver's licence I am the official family chaufeur/errand bitch!  i hate going to IGA... its scary... I had to go alone today... I couldn't decide if I should take a cart or basket, I think to meself, I can take a cart and put like two things in it and look like a fucking retard or take a basket and have to much stuff and have to carry some of it and look like a fucking retard... so I take a cart, but its one of those squeaky stupid ones that don't work properly, so I dump it beside some old lady and grab a basket and spend a half an hour looking for pasta and kraft dinner... they need fucking big signs that say "PASTA AND KRAFT DINNER HERE!" with big arrows and bright lights so I won't miss it, IGAs don't need to be all fancy and nice inside, all they need are aisles with everything listed on a large bright sign so people don't have to spend all day looking for something... so, while I'm really lost and trying to read the fucking signs above the aisles, I run into the butcher lady and her spinning bucket of death... I've never understood why dead animal parts need to be put in a spinning bucket thing... aaaanyways, I almost knock her and the spinning bucket of death over and all the old people start giving me dirty looks so I get scared... run to the cash, pay and leave as fast as I can. But only as I get back to the car, do I realize that I parked in the handicapped spot! I'm a fucking asshole!! fuck!!    The moral of the story is, always get someone else to go grocery shopping for you, and watch where you're going, running into butcher ladies and spinning buckets of death kinda hurts

       urlLink    yay, I can post pictures!   So I've been able to post a picture, that's pretty cool, that's a little drawing from www.toothpastefordinner.com, the best site on the internet... if any of you know of this site, you'll know that the author; Drew, hates blogs, as do I to and extent... they are pointless and no one really cares, but I have nothing better to do with my time so go fuck yourself if you think I shouldn't be doing this or whatever...
