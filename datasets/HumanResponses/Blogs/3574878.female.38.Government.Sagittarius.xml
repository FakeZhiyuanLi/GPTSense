          Well I had a good  time anyway.         &nbsp;     The LHM has been in  bed all day. (Would you believe he has watched Monsters Inc three times in  succession?) So made the most of it and had a bit of a wander around the Blog  Community!&nbsp;     I have drooled over stitching finishes, perused wish lists, checked out  Works in Progress (WIPs) pondered Questions of the Week and generally had a very  relaxing and stimulating time.&nbsp; Saw some amazing mail art and might be  tempted to 'have a go'!         &nbsp;     And to add (so you  don't think I have been slacking&nbsp;on my enforced time off)&nbsp;- I also  stitched for an hour or two n Maiden's Walk!&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting, counting,  counting cutting and weaving! Someone told me to count three times, cut once : )  So far so good!&nbsp; Still not happy with the 2-stranded satin stitch which  isn't really satin-y, but.....still not sure what to do!&nbsp; Will keep looking  at it and perhaps something will jump out at me!         &nbsp;     Thanks to everyone  who contributed to my enjoyable day!         &nbsp;     Tannia         &nbsp;       &nbsp;

          The LHM is still  ill....what started as a sore throat and headache slowly morphed into gastric  upset and this morning it has&nbsp;altered form entirely to become an  earache!&nbsp; We were up all night last night with LHM coughing his little  8-year old lungs up poor darling....and I am exhausted.&nbsp; I will have to  relent and head off to the doctor today.&nbsp; I generally try not to see the  doctor until 48 hours has passed.&nbsp; I just hate it when they suggest pumping  a kid full of antibiotics for a head cold - it just doesn't do any  good!             &nbsp;     So three days after  the first cough and laryngitic scratch, I am still at home.&nbsp; I don't 'do'  the SAHM thing very well.&nbsp; All I can think of is the pile of work on my  desk, the deadlines I will fail to meet before going on LEAVE on Friday.&nbsp; I  think this says something about my personality.         &nbsp;       Anyhow  just when you think you might get some quality stitching time in - LHM in bed,  house clean and quiet...nope....foiled at every turn!&nbsp; I just don't know  where the time has gone.&nbsp; Perhaps today!&nbsp; Maiden's Walk is  calling!&nbsp; (one good thing though - I did finish the  laundry!)          &nbsp;     Oh and&nbsp;I did  try to take some piccies of my framing!&nbsp; Failed dismally - I think my  memory card for my camera is wrecked!&nbsp; Or the card reader is or  something......it's frustrating the heck out of me!&nbsp; Will get a new one  today and see what happens!&nbsp; I can't afford a new  camera!             &nbsp;        Need  coffee.....         &nbsp;     Tannia

          Seen enough of these  to want to participate :)         &nbsp;     Here we go - my  first Stitcher's Five         &nbsp;       1. What was your first finished stitched  piece?      A piece from a  magazine "For the Love Of Cross Stitch" when I was around 15.&nbsp; My Mother  still has it framed and hanging on her dining room wall.      2. What was the first piece you used beads  on?        W arm Christmas Wishes by&nbsp;Emie Bishop and a piece of  hardanger I designed myself for a friend.&nbsp; This was only last year....never  been one for embellishments but I have several pieces on the go at the moment  that will have tons of beading when complete!         3. What was the first piece you used blends  on?        T eresa Wentzler's The Castle Sampler - still a WIP and  has been for some years!       4. What was the first piece you used specialty  stitches on?        H mmm in any great details I would have to say Indigo  Rose's Desiderata (as opposed to the sampler I designed and stitched myself for  my mother!)       5. What was the first piece you stitched on evenweave  or linen as opposed to aida?       The same piece as in  answer number one.&nbsp; I have only ever stitched four pieces on aida and two  of them were the same chart!!!       More  later....       Tannia

      Today my precious Littlest Household Member (LHM) was off school sick with a sore throat and barking like a circus seal - poor darling!  So he and I had a bonus long weekend....much to the delight of my staff I suspect!  While the LHM stayed in bed till around 11.00 am and spent the next couple of hours watching Star Wars movies, I finished the knitting previously mentioned and actually stitched for a while on Maiden's Walk!  Yay Me!  I didn't even feel remotely guilty about not being at work.     The Maiden's Walk chart calls for silks, but the shop owner has requested it stitched in the DMC alternative and I have to say the satin stitched motifs are not covering well in 2 threads, but three threads looks yuckier!  What to do?  I have stitched them in three and frogged, and stitched them in two and the coverage is not good.....I'm not happy but will wait and see what the owner thinks!   Tonight the best season for stitching starts!!!  Wimbledon!  Yes, this English Tennis Tournament means I will get mountains of stitching done as I try and keep myself awake for hours on end watching little green balls getting thumped around a tennis court by nicely shaped young men in white!!!  (oh and of course there are women too!!!)  The funniest thing is, that I am not really an tennis nut, I just like Wimbledon for some reason.  Perhaps its the effect it has on my stitching output.   I am off to Canberra on Friday - to take the LHM to see his Dad.  While I am up that way I intend to nick up to Sydney for the Stitches and Craft Show at darling harbour and meet up with a couple of Sydney girls.....spend some money...and head back down to Canberra on Sunday night.  A fleeting trip but should be fun!  I have a course to do for work on Monday morning which is excellent, as it means that work will pay for my travel...a bonus to spend at the Show :)   LHM will stay with dad for two weeks, I will drive back on Tuesday and LHM will fly back later.  This means I have almost two whole weeks child-free which is an absolute God send!  Doesn't mean my social life will be any better, but it does mean that if I wanted to go out - I can!  This will not happen though I am renowned for being a homebody!   I am hoping *crossing fingers, toes, eyes and everything*  that a friend who is visiting the US will be able to procure for me Genny Morrow's "Nova"!  I am soooo in love with this chart!  I want it!    I will stitch it!  I MUST have it!  I am having a torrid affair with needlepoint at the moment!  I do hope my other stitching doesn't get jealous!   Anyhow.....back to work tomorrow where every second staff member will be bleary-eyed from watching the opening round of the tennis!  I believe our boy Lleyton Hewitt is up first!!!   Aussie!!!! Aussie!!!! Aussie!!!!   Tannia

      Hmmmph!  So much for stitching all day Monday - didn't even pick up a needle...!    By the time I had picked up the Littlest Household Member (LHM) from his sleepover, visited a friend, had lunch, waited till the huge rainstorm passed and got home, all I had time to do was frog everything I had done the night before on the Maiden's Walk model!  Bugger!  Two more days and I pick up a heap of stuff at the framers.  Three pieces of stitching (one is not mine) and three pictures from a fantastic Calendar I got from Israeli Airways.  All the pictures were drawn by children and they're really lovely and colourful.  I had a picture of Jerusalem framed for my only Jewish friend for her birthday - it's lovely!  The other two are for my bedroom - really bright and colourful...I can't wait to hang them.  Will post pics of the framing after Saturday!  Stay tuned!  One of the needlework pieces is the needlepoint you can see a picture of below and another is a little sampler I did for another friend for her birthday last year and I am getting it framed for her this year *chuckle*.  Am I the only person to have done this?  Anyhow this week so far has been a little more forgiving!  Re-stitched what I frogged and accomplished a little more...right on target for handing it over to its owner in two weeks...that's the plan.  I got a bargain today on the electronic notice board at work - a 15-speed mountain bike (like new) for the LHM for the miserly sum of $50!  Too cool - now we can ride together - or we will be able to once the weather fines up again!  Can't wait!  I really miss cycling and doing these kinds of things together.  So to the music part of this post.......Got the new Joss Stone CD today!  Wow! What an awesome set of lungs on such a young girl!  If you're into 'soul' then you have to give this one a hearing.  My favourite after the first taste is "Dirty Man".  I love it!  I really am a sucker for a great song and a fabulous voice!  Two more days to the weekend - thank goodness - this weekend I really AM going to stitch lots....House is beautiful, weather will be freezing, no better climate for stitching I think!  Happy stitching!  Tannia

       urlLink    Mtrl_Girl thanks for asking about "My Country". Just for you - a picture of the finished design. It's from Australian Cross Stitch and Embroidery, Vol 7 No 2. The chart is hand drawn, the lettering is all stitched over one and there is drawn thread work and I forgot to mention - it uses rayons *Sigh*. Certainly not my favourite piece to stitch but it will be gorgeous! The lettering is a killer!!!!  Thanks for your interest :)&nbsp; urlLink

          On one of the  message boards I frequent, the 'inhabitants' have this week been constantly been  going on and on about KNITTING.&nbsp; Now I can knit...very well in fact, but  quite frankly...when I have time to knit - I would rather be  stitching...BUT...today I picked up some wool I had and started knitting....grrr  'wasted' so much precious stitching time.         &nbsp;     Tomorrow I am  stitching all day...I mean it....from when I get up in the morning until I go to  bed...just stopping for meals....I MUST get this model finished and I had to  frog a heap this morning and that made me cranky as a public school  principal!         &nbsp;     I have to learn to  close my ears to all these people who would have me do other crafts...I mean I  have successfully come away unscathed from the scrap booking craze...why could I  not say no to KNITTING!!!         &nbsp;     More  later

      So here are my disjointed ramblings.  My first aim of blogging is hopefully to motivate myself to get cracking on some of the many Works in (very) Slow Progress (WISPs) to have something of interest for other stitchers to check up on from time to time.  Like many people who 'blog' I often wonder if I will in fact have anything of great interest to say, but then again, like the many devotees of blog reading, I often find myself whiling away hours encapsulated in the 'real worlds' of those from far and wide... Far better than reality telly I suspect!  Anyhow for my first inauspicious posting, I am here to tell you that tonight I actually picked up Maria van Sherrenburg's "NIGHT" for a couple of hours...I am sure the shop who is paying me to  stitch it is kinda wondering where she has gotten to....oh well I told them I wasn't fast :)  I am going to focus on her now till she's done - I envisage about 20 hours or so and it's all over.  I have enjoyed her...Will be sorry to see her go!  Ta Da!!! so if this is a first post...I've done it!

           How do you choose a project? What &#8220;calls&#8221; to you the most?       Hmmmmmm...generally,  it's something totally different to anything I have on the go at the  moment.&nbsp; Like just recently I did the needlepoint because I had never done  any before....mind you I am now an addict!&nbsp; For a while, it seemed that  everything I started was green or varying shades of so I couldn't wait to start  something with colour and LOTS of it!&nbsp; Now, If I am 'bored" I just pick up  the project that is yelling the loudest :)       This is probably why I  have 13 works in progress!!!!  Cheers       Tannia

            Which project (finished or in progress) are  you most proud of? Explain why.       Good question....well  asked!       My greatest  achievement in stitching is finishing Indigo Rose's "Desiderata".&nbsp; It's the  first sampler&nbsp;I finished, the first piece with specialty stitches of any  great number and the first 'real' hardanger I completed!&nbsp; I stitched the  date on upside down.....but never fixed it before it got framed, so it reminds  me that I'm not perfect!&nbsp; Stitching the verse as well made me really take  it to heart.&nbsp; It's hanging in my lounge room and I look at it every day and  it makes me feel good to see it.       I am also stitching a  sampler for my dad (pic in a previous post somewhere) which is really hard  going...I guess when it's done I will have to rethink my 'most proud stitching  achievement"       Blessings       Tannia

          I have had a fairly  weird week.&nbsp;     Work has been "weird", personal life has been "weird", love life even  weirder (but I wont get into that here)!&nbsp;&nbsp;     I feel a bit like I am sitting  on the outside watching what's going on in my life and I have no control....all  kinds of things happening that I don't like but there's not much I can do!&nbsp;  Hmmmm.....all I can say is....weird!&nbsp; Ever have a week like  that?         &nbsp;     Stitching wise, I am  working on the Fairy (MvS' Night) it's so close to being done but it seems like  every two or three stitches I have to change colours so it's not moving along as  fast as I had hoped.&nbsp; I had wanted to finish her this week -&nbsp; but  that's not going to happen.&nbsp;Maiden's walk is having her cut threads removed  and I am terrified that the last thread I cut will be wrong or something  horrible like that - so as all the good books all say I am counting three times,  cutting once!&nbsp; Hopefully it will be fine.         &nbsp;     I was so tempted  last night to start something new...but I was strong...I resisted...went to bed  instead (actually come to think of it this morning, it was pretty weak of me  really).&nbsp; I know if&nbsp;I had stayed up I would have started....DT's An  Open Heart, or Sew to Be Seen's Silent Thoughts, or Antique Fancy, or one of a  dozen things I have kitted up already...but I just want to get these two models  finished before I start anything new!         &nbsp;     I have been bidding  on a few things on Ebay...unsuccessfully...bummer although I did win a lovely  beaded pincushion for $10 (AU).&nbsp; It arrived this week and is lovely  although I thought in the picture it looked more purple, but it is actually  quite pink.&nbsp; I also won a collection of needlework/craft books and I am  looking forward to them arriving this week.&nbsp; Some good ones amongst them,  some I am not interested in but I might be swayed.         &nbsp;     The LHM comes home  today after spending two weeks with his Dad in Sydney.&nbsp; I have missed him,  but he told me last night he didn't want to come home...*sigh*.&nbsp; I am sure  he will settle in at home ok.         &nbsp;     Apologies for not  posting for a while, things have been getting away from me.         &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;

          Today, I read on one  of the communities&nbsp;to which I belong&nbsp;- that the 4 year-old son of one  of our members has been missing since Sunday morning.         &nbsp;     As I sit here in  stunned silence, the tears are&nbsp;streaming from my eyes and I can't for one  minute imagine what Stacey and Robert must be feeling, even though I am a parent  myself.&nbsp; Several times this evening, I have looked down upon my own son  sleeping safely and thanked God that I have never felt what Stacey and Robert  must be feeling.         &nbsp;     My heart is aching  for this family and my prayers and that of my community here in Aus will be for  this family until some news is received.         &nbsp;     I hope that whatever  you believe, whichever God or entity you worship, you can spare some prayers,  thoughts, white light for Stacey and Robert and for little David.&nbsp;      Stacey and  Robert my prayers for courage and strength&nbsp;are with you.&nbsp; I pray David  will be returned to you safely soon.         &nbsp;     &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;
