       What I'm referring to is the "real world". I'm not as scared as I used to be of that; I guess it's maturity finally rearing its head, haha. I've realized during my time in college that I love kids. I love teaching, directing, helping guide them. Its one of the greatest feelings I've ever had....and I don't want to ever lose that feeling. So, my career is going to be geared towards children in some way, shape, or form. Law school is still a possibility, but grad school is also an option after I'm done. I'd definitely love to teach for a little while too, middle school social studies. I'm gearing up for that right now....it is so exciting to think about!    &nbsp;  Ok enough about the stuff that&nbsp;probably noone&nbsp;wanted to read. I went to McFaddens for Kristina's bday on the 19th. Ran into a gang of people, such as Sabrina JT, Janet, Reg, Fred, Ty(the most surprising person I saw there), Eddie, and a bunch of others. I came there with Sam and Sarah. It was cool to hang out and all, but I'm really not feeling the whole bar/club scene anymore. I think the peak of that for me was when I was with Joey. I am definitely clubbed out. So, if you want to hang out with me sometime, invite me to a movie, bookstore/cafe, basketball game, picnic, dinner...........basically anything besides a club or bar.    &nbsp;  This past Sunday I went down to Arlington, VA with Sam to watch Maria's game. She did exceptionally well(of course), an we went to eat afterwards. I was so happy just watching her eat. I really don't know how things happened like this, but its something out of a fairytale with this girl. Isn't love supposed to feel unreal? Definitely have that part covered, hahaha. NY is coming soon for her, and I'm sooo happy that she's so happy and excited about it. It will be tough if I'm here in MD too, but I'm built for it, and I think she is too. Anything worth having is worth struggling for! And who knows, I could also end up in NY very soon.........y'all know how I like to sporadically relocate, hahaha.    &nbsp;  My sister is about to be a college freshman. WHERE DID THE TIME GO?!?!!?    &nbsp;  song currently playing: Janet Jackson- Because Of Love   "I&nbsp;don't care what people say   you're the one that brings me so much joy   hen I look at your smiling eyes   my heart wants to dance...."

      Ok so my title for today, "Hey!", is kinda lame but I'm sure I'll be able to think of better ones as I get more accustomed to writing in this thing. But anyways.....hey!  &nbsp; The end of this past week was a hectic one. On Thursday, we had our playoff game at Paint Branch for the summer basketball league I'm in. We lost by 4 to the "best team in the league", Montgomery College. I put the parenthesis up because they were definitely not as good as advertised. I had a good game (as usual) with 19 points, but an L is an L. All in all, the league was alot of fun, and I'm glad my boy T put me on with it. Good lookin' shorty. &nbsp; Friday, I got paid(finally) and went down to Artscape after work with Sam, Twin, and Flip. It was cool, but us being the black people that we are(yes, Sam is black, hahaha), we didn't get down there until about 10. It was really weird not being at Artscape with Luke. I think that this is the first time in about 5 years that I went down there without him....miss ya dawg :( Saturday, I had dinner with Sam and his family visiting from Boston. It was a pretty chill weekend, didn't really go out much...but then again, I rarely go out like that anymore. In MY opinion, the only good reason to go out to clubs is to hang with friends. I'm not saying that clubbing in order to dance, meet girls/guys, get fucked up, or to apply for a position as a bouncer(whaddup Dre!) is wrong; I'm just saying that it's not really for me anymore, at least not on a regular basis. Maybe I'm growing up??? Or maybe I'm just getting really lazy. Whatever though. &nbsp; So my sweetheart has been down at Myrtle Beach for the past 4 days, and she comes home today. I haven't spoken to her in those 4 days...I just wanted her to have fun with her sister and best friend, didn't really think it'd be appropriate for me to be harassing her every 10 minutes like I wanted to. I can't wait to see her again. Ever feel like there was a certain part of your life that was going so well it&nbsp;really could've been scripted for a movie or TV show? Yeah..........thats how things are with MTB. I wouldn't change one thing about our situation, not even the fact that she's definitely going to be in NY in the fall, and I might be there too. I've never ever had an experience like this, and&nbsp;my only wish is that I can experience this for the rest of my life, with her.....thank you&nbsp;kiddo.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm off to dream about seeing the world...........peace

      In case you were living under a rock, you'd know that I had a party at my house this past Thursday. It was a pretty good turnout, and thankfully my house wasn't wrecked (although the musical chairs episode minus the music damaged a few folding chairs). The freestyle sessions in the basement, led by Sam, Ferrell, Ray and my brother were classic. I'm gonna miss everyone from camp when its over next week, and I'll be looking forward to next summer with all you guys. Thanks to Dustin, Sam, Ferrell, Ashley, Nina, Shauna, Syrita, Angie, Ray, Adrian, Meghann, Nikki, Anne, Brian, Janet, Teionne, Heather, Colin, Woody, Pat, Half, Isoke, and all those whos names I forgot for a great time. Can't wait til Dustin's party on Friday.
