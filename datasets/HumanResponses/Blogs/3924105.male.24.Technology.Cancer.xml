      I've noticed in the past years, that I'm extremely affected by my surroundings. If I live in a nice place with a nice neighborhood, I feel determined, motivated, and content. When I move or just spend a lot of time in a dumpy part of town, my mood turns sour. This isn't just a minor mood change, mind you. This is a full blown change of perception, actions, and life overall. Why does something as simple as surroundings, effect me so much? I've asked around and I seem to be in the minority with this phenomenon. Unfortunately I don't have the monetary requirements to move into somewhere nicer at the moment, so I suppose I'm stuck.  Your perception is your reality, and mine is on the decline...

      Is it normal to feel utterly depressed every time you see a beautiful woman? Is it normal to hold dear the steadfast opinion that because she's beautiful, she's either taken, heartless, or stupid? All of the above? Perhaps it's a shield, perhaps it's a hope, or perhaps it's simply the truth. Regardless, I still want her, but in what way? Whether it's status, validation of self, or something more carnal, it's still undeniable.  Yet this girl tops them all, the most beautiful I have seen in my 24 years. The magnitude of symptoms was overwhelming, overpowering. She had a soft sharpness to her face, an efficiency, an almost Asian quality. Her skin, dark. Her hair, filled with highlights and vibrance. She had glistening eyes, clear yet burdened. She was a veteran of life, no stranger to emotional hardship. Her lips were a rare median, not too small, not too large; beautifully curved silk.  She wore all black, symbolic it seems. She wore the darkness perfectly. Business attire, serious yet comfortable. It represented her confidence well, a candidate for success. A shiny necklace dangled from her neck, and rested in contrast on her tan chest. Larger than average breasts, they showed themselves ever so slightly at the bottom of her shirts V. A small tease for the eyes, while maintaining more modesty than most.  I watched as she sat in the back, observing the corporate game we played. Her ringless hand sat quietly on her leg, her eyes giving away her presence in a world other than this one. She and I were similar, playing the game well while having no interest in it.  I wonder who she is. I wonder where she's been. But for a short time, she filled my eyes and mind with something priceless, something I doubt I'll soon forget. She brought a little hope to an otherwise hopeless world.  I doubt I'll soon forget, Carey.

      Have you ever had the feeling like something wasn't quite right, yet could be easily changed if you only knew what it was? Something about my current situation just doesn't feel right...or perhaps it's several things. Mostly, I'm once again unsure of my future plans. School was concrete, very definite. Then again, I wasn't expecting to land a great IT job either. So now what do I do? School and work? Just work? Just school? There's so much to learn, and my brain is aching for information. The choice seems obvious, yet the money and benefits of full time work is very compelling. Or perhaps this is a time to bust my ass and use this great income to PAY for school while I can.  It seems that neither choice is a recipe for happiness, yet one of them just seems like the right thing to do. Knowing what's the right thing to do, and then actually doing it, are two entirely different things.  I suppose for once, I should listen to myself...

      A swirly warm fur snake sliding softly down my neck, little trumpets and saxophones play light jazz all around my festive cognitive pseudo reality. Little dancing flames swing their hips back and forth, below. Slower now, the tempo dissipates, in armlock, little cartoon flames, swinging around one another. The clarity of the moment, so soothingly grappling yet intense within the moment. Ambient reality, so dormant with startling abruption. Light flicks of tickling notes, floating one into a warm oblivion.

      So, I have a blog? What the fuck? I always said "I don't know what I'd write about, and I don't know who'd want to read it". So maybe that answer will come in time, and I'll find that this is a waste. But the truth is, I know precisely what I'd write about. Whether or not anybody wants to read it is a different story entirely.  On a lighter note, I am now the Systems Administrator for a little startup company called Oregon3D (www.oregon3d.com). Thus far it's a great job, and I have a great deal to learn. There's something simply exciting about being tossed a list of techie projects and given free reign to do as you please, so long as you produce results. That's my kind of environment.  At any rate, SuSE calls, and I must answer...

      Tonight I took on the tedious task of emptying and reorganizing my filing cabinet. All new hanging file folders, new tabs, and a whole new organization. This seemingly boring task sooned turned interesting as I found myself coming across several long lost documents: receipts, school transcripts, credit information, previous employment, my entire life's paper trail all thrown into this filing cabinet that I had long since forgotten about.  At first I came across manuals and guides to old PC games that I used to play. I came across the manual for my very first motherboard, a 386 DX based board. I remember how hard I worked to earn that thing, and how much I loved it. It brought back memories of how hard I worked as a child, for the things I wanted most. Today, the story is much different...my drive is gone.  I found medical records and letters from past girlfriends. Thoughts of relationships gone bad, poured into my mind. So many years wasted on these girls, yet in some way or another I'm sad some of them didn't work out. It truly makes one wonder, why they all fail...if they all fail because of me. In the end, I was always told it was my fault, I'm the jerk, I'm the reason for it all. Maybe I was.  I came across my credit records. Tens of thousands of dollars of debt that I put myself into, as a teen. I didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into, and everytime they offered credit, I accepted. Never holding down a steady job, I never repaid my debts. I look back and am disgusted at my own irresponsibility and incompetence. But then I have to wonder, has anything changed?  Mulling over my school records, I skim to the bottom and read my high school GPA, a 1.6 cumulative. The string of D's and F's is astonishing...a glaring example of my lack of effort in my high school days. Only recently have I proven myself with A's and B's, seven long years later. I feel sometimes as though I define "pathetic" singlehandedly.  What has my life been? Looking through my file, thinking back to my youth, I realize that I've led a sad existence. I've never had any friends, never accomplished anything significant. I've never traveled the world, never held a great job, never had any academic breakthroughs. I've never had a successful relationship, never had a passion for life, and only once have felt true love. I ask myself over the years, if it gets any better than this, and I convince myself that it does. Days, months, years pass, and while little things may improve, the overall state remains the same.  My memory is shot, my health is poor, I'm overweight, my mind is going, I'm losing my hair, I'm relatively broke, I have no friends, no family to speak of. My schooling has hit a dead end, I can barely finish a book anymore. I have no forseeable future, no path, no hopeful "plan b".  I wake up every day, thinking maybe this is the day it will all change. Maybe this is the day that I finally take the correct path. Perhaps it's time to quit living in a dream world, and face the reality of my futile existence.  A mistake was born.
