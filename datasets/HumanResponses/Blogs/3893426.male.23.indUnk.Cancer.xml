      I have been struck again by the affliction of insomnia. I do as much as I can to make sure I get insomnia, poor diet, poor sleep pattern, little exercise, high stress existence and it is rumoured tha it may become and Olympic sport so every cloud.......    I had a call back from J P Morgan, so it looks like I am going to be a suit, a grey suit working in an investment bank. Yippee. Oh well pays the bills, plenty of room for progressing through the company, I should be juuuuuust FINE.    Have my theory test on Thursday, done my usual ZERO preparation but I passed it before and I will pass it again, I am not worried about that to be honest.    So yeh it's time for me to be a man now, to take some responsibility and fall into that routine that makes your last years only seem as long as your first twenty. I don;t like that theory at all, my first twenty are comfortably behind me now, meaning I am halfway in my perception. Crapola!!!     So what makes a man? What do I have to be? Rich? Funnily enough in some ways I would love to be rich, who wouldn't? It sure takes the pain out of being poor, but I am not motivated by money, merely the need for money, so having enough will be plenty, I will never want for much more than that. Success? How do I measure it? Saving someone' s life? Saving my wages? Saving the firm millions? Saving my parents' marriage? What is success at the end of the day? Maybe reproduction is the reason we are here, nature would certainly seem to indicate that to me, so maybe success is finding a partner and having a family, raising good kids. that's all well and good so long as I am happy but what do I teach them? I am 23, the age a lot of people would already be parents in years gone by and I feel I am not worthy of teaching a child who to be.    I think maybe being a man is being wise enough to know this, being knowledgable enough to know that you cannot and will not know everything, you will never be perfect or flawless and that love, life, work and health will always be a bumpy ride, just being busier and involved in things has gotten rid of my gloomy outlook, I am still pursued by these questions and uncertainties but at least now I can begin to answer them. The future is and always will be bright, the future belongs to me and you and our children and grandchildren, not everything in the world will be right and perfect but you have to love the things that are. In history we are not even the blink of an eye, 20 years is nothing in the history of my school, so think what our short lifetimes are to the history of mankind. Why even be arrogant enought to think mankind is something devine......why is our race so special? We are a dot on the landscape of the infinite universe, so I'm not going to be stressing about what clothes I wear tomorrow night.       In many ways they'll miss the good old days     Someday, someday     Yeah it hurts to say but I want you to stay     Sometimes, sometimes     When we was young ah man did   we have fun   Always, always

       Your life is spinning out of control   Seems the whole world is out to get you   Everything is wrong, nothing seems right-eh      There's a sinking feeling inside-eh   Even your best friend has turned his back   But-cha can't let it bring ya down, no you've gotta FIGHT-eyy     Coz you’ve tried but ya can’t let go      It’s when you’re down that ya gotta get up-eh   Don’t let em walk all over your face-a   Stand up for yourself and make everything right again     Even if some guys trying to blackmail you   And your girlfriend thinks you suck    It’s up to you to let them know   That it was all just part of some rich guy’s evil plan      Look out ahead there’s a truck changing lanes   You've got some yellow crumbs on your upper lip   And those warts on your dick aren’t gonna go away   Unless you start using topical cream everyday

      Why is it that 'doing' is pronounced doo-ing and 'boing' isn't boo-ing?  More from Darryl Hockings Language Phenomena next week!    I had so much to say but I can't be bothered now, it's too late and I need bed, so I will do it tomorrow.  Hoping you are all grandiose!!!       Oh when did you decide       To start living like it's suicide       And wasting all my time       And messing up my mind          Oh now darling please leave me alone       I'm so tired I wanna be on my own       But you come on calling on my telephone       And I wish I could show you somewhere better       Better to go

      I have spent a valuable portion of my life today trying to get cruddy AOL working so that we can use the Broadband connection that we pay for, but to no avail.  I will never get that time back.  Maybe I should sue AOL for it, after all their technical support is SHITE.    A few things are coming to the fore at the moment, with the advent of a real summer I have felt much brighter, I have a restlessness about me that makes me want to achieve things and get out to the places I like, attributes that have been lacking of late.    A few of my dearly beloved have said to me that I really ought to be thinking about what I want, what will make me happy, where I am headed.  I really think I haven't done this enough, and I know for sure that I don't have the answers just yet. although I will do soon.   I am feeling better for just considering.  I really think I have been so desperate to get in somewhere and settle into something, become something, that I didn't care what it was.    It's a great feeling when you have turned the corner in this kind of battle, I know it is not a straight uphill climb, I know there are peaks and troughs but I also know I was on a steady descent and I have changed course.  I will always be stronger and steadier for what I have endured, I know longer feel anxious or down-trodden, I burst with ambition and verve.  It's going to be a great adventure.  Peace out. x

      British Open started and my father and I got into a betting frenzy and covered about 10 players, I dunno if we have any chance of making a profit now!!&nbsp;It's nice to have something to spend my time with to be honest, I really am going stir crazy here, my aspirations to leave the house never lead to much.  &nbsp;  I watched&nbsp;a BNP expose&nbsp; sort of program today, you know a bit like the Donal McIntyre programmes, quite interesting actually.&nbsp; It is really a bit of a conflict for me with this sort of thing because in truth I probably have fairly right wing views on some issues but not so on others.&nbsp; I totally agree with the arguments they present concerning the immigration influx problems, that effectively it is going to cripple our country (although I don't want to get a rocket launcher and blow up all the mosques in Bradford like one of them) and I also think that the (and this one really gets me) efforts of the bureaucrats to enforce this political correctness is becoming positively discriminant against the majority.&nbsp; I mean if I went around shouting through a megaphone that Asians were the enemy and in the name of Christianity we should strike them down etc. I would be in the nick in no time, but the same does not really apply in reverse.&nbsp; On top of this I quite fancy myself as a fascist dictator.  &nbsp;  The thing that stands out most to me about my life at the moment is the sheer non-event that it has become.&nbsp; I really don't do anything at the moment and more alarming than that......I quite like it.&nbsp; Time is slipping away from me faster than ever before, probably mainly due to the fact that&nbsp;I am awake for half the night and when I do eventually get to bed I will inevitably be awoken by my considerate family (my Dad woke my up today to tell me the golf had started and when I turned on the TV to watch it he said 'No not on the tele, I just mean they will have teed off now', I was like 'Well why did you feel the need to wake me and tell me that, genius?').&nbsp; Talking of which I suppose I should make the effort to ease my sleep-deprived mind and maybe once I am fully rested up it will all make much more sense to me......someone wake me at 9 for the golf? :P     Stuck here

      Tonight I watched movies; un, deux, trois. "Blood Work" with Clint Eastwood playing a very old man who bones a young lady while doing some police work, "Cold Mountain" a multi oscar winning period film starring Jude 'he's so pretty' Law, Nicole 'she's so ginger' Kidman and Renee 'she's Bridget bloody Jones' Zellweeger (or something like that) which while being pretty good evoked 'I hate America' feelings somehow and the pinnacle of the evening's entertainment was Rocky II (yes SMELLYBEANS it is a film), a new movie about boxing with some amazingly accurate action scenes.   I am kinda stuck in this nocturnal non-achievement cycle at the moment, things are not easy, I am clearly suffering depression symptoms but I also realise that it is in me to get past this very quickly with a few breaks going my way, so CHILL OUT HOCKINGS.   No-one on MSN tonight which is very strange, I'm beginning to think something suspicious is going on. It's feasible that every person on my MSN has joined the same cult, called something like ths Order of the (very) Handsome Death, which by chance lists it's main mission as annhialating people exactly as beautiful as me in a cryptic fashion. Perhaps by dismembering their internal organs in the shape of jigsaw pieces (maybe a bit too Jack the Ripper) or maybe hold me down and using scalpels make incisions into my tendons so that I slowly bleed to death and if I try to move they will snap. It's feasible. Well it's not impossible.&nbsp; And not very cryptic.  I am in love with Lemmiwinks. Search for Lemmiwinks in google and click the first link. All hail the Gerbil King!   Shit it's got late again, I should be in bed and getting up at a reasonable time, not bloody waking in the afternoon again!! Night night.    It's alright to tell me  What you think about me  I won't try to argue  Or hold it against you,  I know that you're leaving,  You must have your reasons,  The season is calling  Your pictures are falling down   The steps that I retrace  The sad look on your face  The timing and structure  Did you hear he fucked her?  A day late, a buck short  I'm writing the report  On losing and failing  When I move I'm flailing now   And it's happened once again  I'll turn to a friend  Someone that understands  Sees through the master plan,  But everybodys is gone,  And I've been here for too long  To face this of my own  Well I guess this is growing up...  Well I guess this is growing up

      Happiness comes to you in small measures.  I don't know if sustained happiness exists.  Happiness is having a beer with your mates, a drag on your joint or your fag, dropping some pills, doing some lines, having an orgasm for a few seconds, enjoying a nice meal.  The enigma that represents happiness to me seems so elusive, contentment is a frequent visitor, happiness just a carrot on the line.    I don't know if love brings happiness either.  It sure brings contentment to people, I mean it's not like people fall in love and they are unhappy, but I think maybe it is more a bearer of stability than genuine happiness.  In my experience most guys are happiest when they have been out on the pop and then shot a load up some random tart.  It's not an experience that I can rate one way or another having never done it.  I think once you are in love you become set in an unnatural way, it's been proven that love is a chemical imbalance born out of insecurity that makes you reliant on someone.  Am I too cynical? Without doubt.  I also believe that once you have felt 'love' for someone that you will always love them, maybe not in the same way, not in the way they want you to, but it doesn't suddenly disappear.  I am facing a situation at the moment that I never thought I would have to deal with, I am not certain it will come about and I cannot talk openly of it yet but I will know soon and it may be the hardest thing I have ever faced.  One thing is for sure though, whatever happens my head will never go down.  I just pray that FM receives the news she is hoping to.  Listening to 'Together In Electric Dreams' right now by Human League, what a mega 80s nostalgia super track, I reall am getting old now!!  Good tune though very positive.  I have a call back tomorrow about an IT Sales Advisor job in Romsey.  Should I really sell my soul into this industry?  I have no idea what the post actually is, but it is cash, 20k a year and I am sure that I could make it work if I had to.  Sounds a bit like tele-sales though, that I am not sure about and I CERTAINLY will not be cold-calling anyone!!  No way, uh-uh, not on your mother fucking nelly.  I need cash bad but I'm not a whore!  So as the dreary, impoverished days drift by I become more and more disillusioned with my life.  Thoughts of death start to re-enter my mindset, overdosing almost seems justifiable, and for what?  What single good reason do I have for feeling any of this?  All I can say is that there is simply none.  I am aware that it is brought on by a chemical state in my head but I was happier before for Saddam's sake!!  I have ingrained suspicions about what biological reasons may be behind it but I will keep them to myself for the time being, suffice to say that I have done enough changing of the world's ideas on life so far this week.  One thing is for sure, I hit the apex of a trough (in the words of Gary Lineker) and I will be on the up in future.  I do not have what I want from life, to be fair I have practically nothing of what I wish for, but so far as I am aware I have my health and I certainly have far more than most on this rock it's not a time to be feeling sorrow over my predicament.   Instead I think I will get up tomorrow, have an instant hot shower, use my electric toothbrush, turn on my 1200 quid PC (one of three in the house) and print off a few CVs showing my numerous qualifications, maybe stick a couple of slices in the toaster, kick back and watch some of the hundreds of television channels available, or maybe listen to some music on one of the many media at my disposal, then go get the train with some petty cash and trot into the temping agency telling them what I will and won;t do to earn my pocket money and if I end up not working it's not a problem.  Suddenly my situation doesn't seem quite so bad does it? I could be sewing mailbags for 4p a day for fucks sake just to stay alive.    I feel myself ranting again, it makes me wonder what part of me feels so self-important and so sure of my own opinions as it is certainly not a part regularly on display right now.  I often ponder what the future holds for one such as me.  I am in great danger of tragically tumbling by the wayside, never even touching on my potential and never being more than a surf in the greater scheme of things.  It stings me to think how my dreams have evaporated along with my self belief and I am reminded of my inadequacy with a persistency like a thousand paper cuts on my hands.  I just want to feel exceptional in one way, succeed greatly at one thing.  So far as I can see my previous levels of pride for being exceptional in how genuine or nice I am to people is unwarranted, but when I lay on my deathbed (if I am so fortunate to have that luxury of notice of my end) then I will be able to look any man in the eye and know that I was somehow good.  Darryl WHO??????  Night all. x   Hey, don't write yourself off yet It's only in your head you feel left out and looked down on. Just try your best, Try everything you can. And don't you worry what they tell themselves When you're away.  It just takes some time Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride. Everything, everything will be just fine, Everything, everything will be alright, alright.  Hey, you know they're all the same. You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in. Live right now and just be yourself. It doesn't matter if it's good enough For someone else.  It just takes some time Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride. Everything, everything will be just fine, Everything, everything will be alright, alright.

      I just wrote this bastard post and it disappeared so forgive me if I am not at my poetic best because I am writing from scratch ;-)  As you may have gathered by now very few will be privy to these words that I write and it is very likely the case that no-one that I have come face to face with will be reading them, at least not anyone I have previously come face to face with.   Today the world does not seem the same dark place it was yesterday, it seems different.  That is not to say the world is brighter, more vibrant, more exhilarating, just different.  I know this is just because I got some decent sleep, in truth I think sleep deprivation contributes heavily to my depressive mood.    Haha 3.30am and I just got a call from a Welsh guy asking if I would play in the university golf team.  Practical joke? Sounded suspiciously like Marcus, but could have been anyone to be honest.  Withheld number too!  Yeh so anyway, I really have to try and find some work this week, I know it is essential to my wellbeing to relieve financial pressures and establish some kind of routine, at the moment I could stay in bed and rot or just slide off the face of the earth and no-one would notice.  A few things are striking me at the moment.  I sometimes wonder if it would be worthwhile being a politician but despite being a right wing Tory at heart I know the only way that the world's problems will ever be solved is in the purest form of communism, an ideal that will never exist or be accepted, capitalism rules and we are merely ants running in the colony, mice on the wheels, anyone feeling truly sorry for themselves? Go live and work in fucking India for a while, sew fucking footballs or maybe work the mines.....now that's sorry, especially when you earn less than a quid a week.  Some people have no choice.  We do.  That's why while I feel down I will never fold.  I am feeling particularly unattractive at the moment.  I need a hair cut quite seriously, although I am not adverse to growing it a while and keeping it a little longer, what really bugs me though is my body.  Since being home I have barely done any exercise.  I must have lost 2 inches off my chest.  Gone are the days when the least I would do was 100 press ups a night.  I feel like I have a flabby gut too, but I know no alcohol would solve that.    'All night life goes by in the doledrum'.  Nice lyric.  I relate.  The LA's were an underrated band, I know 'There She Goes' had it's success and it should for it is the finest ode to heroin I know of, but jees it was a great album and it makes me sad that Lee Mavers won't allow any music he has written since to see the light of day!! He has been stockpiling tracks for like 14 years now....the frustration.  Mind you he is a bit mad.    I have had both Olly and Matt Ryznar offer me somewhere to go visit this weekend (or any time basically) and although I haven't said I will I really hope I can.  It would be a great release and they are two of my best mates that I never see.  It really hurts me the way Jeeawock has gone, my oldest mate in the world, and he never bothers with me, not even to say how are you.  I really wonder why, he is ashamed of his girlfriend or something.  Come to think of it NONE of my mates at home have ever talked about their girlfriends.  It is the biggest boys' club in history.  I love girls.   I should be off, it is now 5am, I have been drinking alone for 2 nights on the trot, no small amount either.  From now on drink is banned, I want to get leaner and it isn't acceptable.  My eyes are heavy and bed is sounding my name, Sadie good luck in your new situation and I pray you will be as well as you can possibly be when you leave, Mel....um.....don't leave the country you bastard (or words to that effect) and anyone else that is reading Hi!!       If you want I'll sell you a life story About a man who's at loggerheads With his past all the time He's alive and living in purgatory All he's doing is rooming in hotels And scooping up lots of wine  There was once a boy of life Who lived upon a knife He took his share of everywhere But he never took a wife...  He was born to live like a mercenery Well personally I think that's fine If you're in the right mind He was burned by the twentieth century Now he's doing time In the back of his mind He can hear them outside  Better run, rabbit, run Run into the sun Kick your heels in the killing fields Run rabbit run You're a son of a gun

      APOLOGIES TO ANYONE THAT READS THIS...IT IS VERY FRANK AND OPEN....NEE CHARLES BUKOWSKI (funny thing I just heard him referenced in a Razorlight song -'In The City)  It's amazing to think just how unsure of myself I have become.  I fear what everyone thinks in almost any way, seeking privacy and dare I say reclusion in preference to baring my thoughts and feelings to someone I know well.  If I am honest with myself the people that know me best have never met me......and even then am I really totally honest about everything?? Surely somewhere along the line I have become defensive and lied in fear of judgment.  Today was a Saturday.  I couldn't get fixed up in a game in the Earl of Leven Cup so I sat in with my little bro.  I got up at about 12 and Dad had left us a tenner each, incidentally my only money in the world, so I made Matt get off the computer and dressed and took him into town.  We went to the computer game shop, he picked up 3 games and I picked out one, which on trying to pay for they couldn't find.  Then I got a newspaper.  That newspaper was the highlight of my day, I couldn't even find the motivation to make food.    I struggle to trace back what happened to me, where Darryl Hockings went.  I wasn't always this way, I can't have been.  I didn't play golf until my hands were raw with no lust for life, somewhere along the way it got sapped.  So here I stand this Saturday night, jobless, penniless, bored with everything life has given me, no energy or motivation for even the most basic functions and in constant fear of rejection and failure.  I know I needn't be lonely so I must choose to go that route.    In many ways I am glad I haven't had the money/women/drugs/booze at my fingertips.  I would only abuse it.  Some things are just a given and I know that anything going could be my crutch at the moment and it probably is the best form of therapy to navigate the emotional minefield I create for myself clear of any exterior influence.  All my mates are boozehounds, they all love it, they work to drink, then if they are lucky to fuck too.  That's not me.  These are my best friends and they are my people but I know I will never be close to them in the same way I was before I experienced a long-term loving relationship because the only way I will ever have a best friend again is by falling in love again.  This is just it.....I have heavy debts, I regret even going to university.....but why? Due to the debts? SURE there is pressure from that but I will pay them soon enough but it must be her really.  The way being with her changed me and changed my life and trapped me in a way that will take either a long time to repair or replace.  My libido is totally gone at the moment.  I couldn't even be bothered to get the porn on the case, I have no desire.  This is not a natural thing, I should want to pump every girl going full of my sperm but it's not in me right now.  If I had someone I probably couldn't fuck her properly, not like she would want.  I don't see what my current guise has to offer to a girl really, although I am sure that some of them will find something worth salvaging from this wreck of a mind.    I should sign off really, there are a million words to write but my mind and body cannot keep pace and whilst I drink this aged wine by myself I know that dawn will break on another day shortly and the world will still turn.  The people will surface from they're holes like an infestation of field mice going about their routines while th ultimate goal of reproduction is poisoned and polluted by the general population.  Think of it, the government wants the top 50% in intellect to go to university and become more educated, gaining important and successful careers from it, meaning they marry and have children later and later and the lower 50% will still get started on their families between the ages of 13 and 22 causing an influx of poorly breeded children, an implosion of society.  Why do  we wonder where the cretins come from to support the BNP????   Anyway I am off to slip into an alcohol induced dreamfest.  If you are reading this then I truly do love and care for you, for you are one of very very few. x    I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe. But today, If you think that I don't know about depression and emotional pain, You're insane.

      Life has it's ups and downs I guess.  One minute you are up flying above the fucking clouds, ur like a bird on a pill and whatever comes by you can deal with it, cope with it's challenges without breaking your stride and move swiftly on.  Then there are the other times.  I realise that everyone who reads this sort of thing will not be able to relate.  Quite frankly I couldn't give a shit what the other people think, but the ones that can find some shred of familiarity with my midset I salute you for your bravery.  The truth is that I just feel I have a dysfunctional mind.  I am not equipped to cope with life as most are, maybe I will reach a plateau of elevated mood through personal successes or maybe I will always find my default outlook is very low and depressive.  Who is to know?
