       7 Secrets of Lasting Love  Found an  urlLink article  at MSn talking bout love secrets and all... the main concern in that article is about analyzing the relationship thoroughly before it get serious .... it's not about being paranoid... it's just bout finding the right person...   maybe some people just want to settle down... at least that's one of the reason used by my friend who's getting married soon... Others would say that they afraid something bad would happen...afraid they can't control their lust...afraid he/she will get away.... want to have kids quickly and pressure from parents.... hahhahahahhahhaha... damn it... we're just 23 man... we're too young to worry bout  serious relationship...n too old for others to make decision for us... You can't even took care of urself and now you want to care of others... hahahahahahhah... Maybe it's becoz we're muslim/ malaysian... where we can only have sex after marriage and once u're married ..there's no turning back... divorce is still unacceptable here.... the same goes to free sex.... Some of them would think that..wow...I can have sex now... that's cool.... or... U're mine now... there's nothing more to worry.....  If they had this kind of thinking ..they're the one who should be more paranoid... you gonna stuck with the same person forever and u're not even sure if that person is the one...

      Soulmate….. Combinations of two simple words that bring a very deep meaning to any person who believe in it. Some people even call it Mr. or Miss Right or whatever, still it carry one sole meaning: the person that you are destined to be with. I’ve never believe in soulmate… for me the term only used by losers who can’t be in any love relationship or for those who’ve been in so many disastrous relationship that they need an assurance that there are still hope for them to be happily in love. In reality, they all just too obsessed with fairytales and actually desiring prince charming to come rescue them from the dragons, cruel stepmother, deep sleep or maybe just the mess they’ve created themselves.   Soulmate….. if such thing really exist, lead us to many questions. The first one will be, “How do you find them?”… most people will answer that when u meet yours, u will know it .. butterflies in your stomach and all… but I’m sure that for those who had fall in love and still single right now will opposed this theory (mainly because there’s thousand of butterflies (maybe moth) had flown in their stomach). “How long do you have to wait?”….. nobody will ever know. They will just answer , “Someday”. Does that mean that if there’s no butterflies in the early stages, you should just vividly discard the current losers from being the candidates for your soulmate? “ What if you have already skip or maybe overlook your soulmate? What if he/she have already vanish from this exotic land called earth (dead) ? What if you’ve already broke up with your soulmate ? Does that mean that you’re doom to be alone for eternity? Millions of questions with equal amount of answers……  Soulmates…… Not believing in it doesn’t mean that you have to pick any “thrash” around you and start a relationship. Believing in it doesn’t mean you have to wait for butterflies because maybe you’re not the type that breed butterflies in your stomach …..

      This commuting to work problem is really bugging me lately. It’s has been my main concern since I first heard about the news of me being transferred to this god-forsaken land Cyberjaya. Let’s face it. I know now I’ve been bestow with three reasonable options.   The first one would be to buy Malaysian-made car, and the only one that caught my eyes would be Perodua Kelisa. It’s the most powerful in the Perodua family, got nice reviews from people and most importantly cheap (I can afford it). The only problem is, it would really hurt my pride since I’m the one who always bragging about not wanting to own any Malaysian vehicle. Come on, being cool, smart and stylish is really important to me. It’s like the one and only pre-requisite for me to stay alive and face every living creature in this world. Maybe if I could suppress my pride a little, things would be fine. I can survive with that. The second option seem to be more tantalizing. Buying Japanese car would really boost my ego and I would really love to own a Honda. For the last one year, I’ve been searching for a Honda Ferio but to no avail. Of course I can’t afford to buy a new Honda, but second hand car is not that bad right. Girls would prefer a guy to have Honda than Perodua right? The dark side for the second option would be money. Having less money really sucks. If I buy a Honda, I would spend more in paying it and also for the maintenance. Since I never really had any experience in owning a car, maintaining it would really cause me much. Funding my family would be a problem to should I spend more money on a car. But maybe if I’m willing to make some sacrifices and ready to be more discipline, I would be fine. The third option is tricky. I could apply to move back to Menara Telekom. It’s hard and the chances is really low but man the result would be so damn fine since I don’t have to bother to own any vehicle. At the meantime, maybe I could ask people to fetch me from home and office. Of course it’s not free and seems kinda pathetic but what the hell right. The prize is too good. The only question is, am I capable to take that kind of risk?  Then I start thinking of the other thing terrorizing my mind; girlfriend. It occurs to me now that I also have three similar options. First is to stay single. It’ll give me freedom, I don’t have to bother about stupid relationship thingy and cost nothing. But then, there’s also loneliness, being label as loser, no one to share everything with and the worst of all, not having anyone to ‘play’ with except for my own two hands. The second option would be Azian, my recent ex. She loves me too damn much, we could be humping like bunnies and it’s really nice to have someone. Still, nothing would really change, I would still be too self-centered, she will always have lots of health problems, she talk to damn much and act like she’s a God and know every fucking thing about me. Third option will always be risky which is to go for someone better. She’s damn sexy and I would really feel complete if I could have her. If only she doesn’t have a boyfriend, have more interest in me and basically don’t give me a hard time in my pursuit to get her.   Two problems, three seemingly similar options and decisions have to be fast. I choose the first choice for the first problem. Should I do the same for the second? God knows………
