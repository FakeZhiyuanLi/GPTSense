      So today the girls and I thought it would be fun to go out for a late lunch/early dinner and talk all sorts of shit about our psychotic meth-head paranoid and delusional room mate.  Or should I say soon to be EX-ROOMMATE!!!    We were just talking a whole lot of shit about him and kind of didn't stop when we got home.  I mean, we were using code names and stuff so it couldn't have been all that obvious like, or could it? muwahahahaha!  So he announced that he was moving and this was his 30 days notice.  We were all so excited and happy we instantly ran to our rooms and posted on craigslist and myspace and wherever else we could that we were looking for a new roomie!  Can I tell you how happy I am?  Can I?  I am soooo happy!

      I've had the worst case of insomnia for the last week.  I know I could fix it all right now with out another word mentioned but do I really want to go back on Lexapro while I'm recovering from being so sick.  I'm still not done taking my antibiotics though, and I told myself I wouldn't poison my body any more than I already am.  Besides it's not like I'm taking it for depression, but for anxiety.  My insomnia is brought on by my anxiety.  It sucks.  Five more days until a week long vacation!  I'll probably start back on the Lexapro before I leave for NYC, so I have the energy to do everything I want to do while I'm there and not be this sleep deprived zombie girl.  I think I just might crawl into bed soon.  Oohh 2am will be an early night for me which usually wraps up around 4:30-5:00a.m.   I dread payday.  I have bills to pay and a trip to spend money on, oh and that little thing called rent that comes at the first of the month.  MEH!

      Yes Morrissey's newest album came out yesterday (the 18th) so if someone has listened to it, or bought it they should definitely tell me if it was/is any good.    It's three in the morning and my ass needs to get to bed before 4 a.m. tonight.  It will be a first in days if I do.

      I have this wierd feeling going on inside.    I leave for NYC in one week, and no one knows how much I need it.  I need to get away from my boring practically non-existant life I've been leading here.  Sure I go out, but not like I used to. I need a good kick in the ass or something, and someone to get drunk with and make out with and lose myself with while I'm "far away from home".  Last time it happened in Boston...  Eric sent me an email a while ago talking about how he was moving on the 15th? I told him we'd have to have drinks or lunch or something when I get out there... I love that boy.  He's the sweetest.  Of course if it wasn't for Ray I would never have met him.  I need to contact Ray and Ashley too, just to see what's going on with them, and to find out if they will have a free moment to meet up sometime while I'm out there.  Last October I only got to see Ray for just a little bit at the Interpol show and at the after party and that was it.  At least I got to meet his beautiful and oh-so-nice wife Cybil.  She's a peach.  It was wierd though because just 9 months prior I spent 5 whole days with him. 24 hours a day.  He's a peach too.  Just more of a rancid peach but he definitely has a heart of gold.  Oh I miss my NYC friends and BEN!  How could I NOT see Ben.  He was my cute, ultra-hip room mate before just up and moving to brooklyn with no money and no job and no clothes!  hahaha.    Back to right now. San Francisco.  Monday night.  I have an interview tomorrow.  I can't wait.  I know the job is mine.  Over the last five years I've really developed this skill at faking confidance and sounding like a professional when usually I have no idea what the hell I'm doing and totally winging it.  But everything seems to fall into place somehow.  So I hope tomorrow is the day that everything falls into place for me.  The only downside about getting this job will mean I'll be working two jobs for a while.  A full time 40 hours a week job and a part time 25 hours a week job.  I'm going to be so exhausted.  Oh well.  We all have to suffer a little sometimes right?  I want an awesome FLAT/Apartment come October so I'm going to save, save, save all the money I can until then.  I also need to get a car and thus that requires some sort of saving of the monitary units also.  I know I don't really NEED a car, and that I just want one, but unless you've had one before you can't really say anything.  I've had a car since I was 16!  I'm 26 and have been with out one for 2.5 years and am missing the freedom and luxury that comes along with owning one.  Never mind the endless parking tickets I'll have to pay or the cost of parking in the city or the price of Gas.  The gas station across from my flat now says $2.79 a gallon!!!  I still need/want one.  I won't have to lug groceries home from the store on public transportation or by  foot anymore.  Won't have to worry if the muni/bart is still running in the middle of the night while out at show/club/bar.  That really is the crappiest part.  Not being able to do things because you can't get home or get stranded and have to rely on other people to get you where you need to go.  I'm so angry at Mike.  Mike is the sweetest, nicest, cutest boy ever.  Tall, dark sexy hair and eyes and completely gorgeous, beautiful hair.  Perfect.  But he's really pissing me off for reasons I can't even begin to express.    Hunter makes me mad too, but not in the same way Mike does.  Hunter is the sweetest guy I've ever known.  He's from the south.  Maybe that's why?  Kansas City.  He's so honest and genuine it's hard to really be mad at him, but I still am.  I'm mad that it turned out the way it did.  He promised me motorcycle rides and better make good on them soon!  I just wonder sometimes what my fucking problem is?

      I've been catching up on sleep since friday night.    I had trouble with my garter belt.  I was dancing.  I had liquor.  Mike told me I looked beautiful and I believed him.  But I went home with Jessica my room mate and my best friend.  She didn't mind me lifting up my skirt to fix my stupid stockings.    I have the most amazing friends.  I am for some reason attracted to the most awesome people.    I wanted to be in bed asleep already.  Or at least laying in bed, maybe playing some nintendo.  I wish I had excite bike. But instead I was playing Jaws. Now though I'm not. I'm sitting here listening to Bauhaus.  Crackle is by far one of the best compilation albums ever to be put out.  It has all of my favorite songs on it.  Reminds me of high school.

      I made the mistake of being born a girl. All those silly little self doubting thoughts that come flooding into a girls mind when everything seems to be going along just fine. It's probably why guys think girls are psycho. I just thought something might be wrong, so I said something, but after I said it I realized I didn't make sense. I then proceeded to explain myself, my situation, and why I said what I said. I should have just ignored everything and played along for a while until the feelings subdued.  I wish there was a way I could just turn that part of me off at will.

      Ever miss something so bad it preoccupied your thoughts day and night?   Let's just say three years, three months and four days had past and you finally got what you wanted and it was great, no  I mean  GREAT  , and yet you still couldn't get it off your mind, but this time instead of dreaming about how it would be you were dreaming about how it was.  Maybe I'm just sick.  But that's all I can think about now.  :)

      Wow!  I woke up this morning really tired, not feeling so hot, and looking like shit.  But I feel like the happiest girl.  So it was all worth it.   In other very unrelated news my jaw came out of the socket this afternoon.  I was laying in my bed when Jessica called.  I yawned and it slipped right out.  I started to freak out.  It's happened three other times before but it hurts and usually involves a trip to the ER so I can get knocked out so they can reset it. It is a HUGE ordeal.  I really didn't want to do it though.  But I was prepared to go in, I just wanted to print out some information on it from the internet becase I couldn't really talk, when I came across a page that told me how to reset it.  I can't believe I did it on my own.  AWESOME that saved me a $50 co-pay!  I was relieved that I didn't have to go in, and then really pissed off at all the stupid dentistry and oral surgery that did this to me.  Thanks.  I hate you.

      Last night we were all too tired to go out.  But tonight is ID.  So I have to go out, plus it's friday.  I'm making a fabulous meal tonight, okay so it's not so fabulous just parmasian chicken, home made pasta salad and some berries I bought today.  I need to finish watching bubba ho-tep.  Leslie and I rented it last night.  It was so good and then I fell asleep.  I suck.  Time once again to rush off to the store to buy more stuff for dinner.

      I have decided officially today that I will not cut my hair.  The only way to get out of this haircut is to let it grow out.  cutting it will only prolong the misery.  I haven't had long hair since 1999.  I don't want it to be too long, but maybe just past my shoulders?    That's only like five more inches.  I can totally hold off on the cutting for a while.  I can be strong.  I do have some will power. Somewhere.    Today, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday are my half days, just one job.  I'm a happy monkey!  That means today at 1pm when I'm off, I'm going to go home and eat a huge lunch and take a nap. I was sleeping on the bus ride over here so clearly I need more sleep.  So far today seems like it won't be too busy, which is good.  I just hope it doesn't go by slowly.  Of course the day is still early and anything can happen.  I'm freezing, and damnit!  I forgot a jacket.

      So I failed to mention that my exciting weekend plans include meeting and hanging out with  urlLink Greg  on Sunday!  That is my most exciting venture of the weekend.  Really.  But that isn't until Sunday and there are 3 nights before sunday so here is the breakdown.  Tomorrow night it's off to 1984.  I haven't been in   forever  , and even though I complain about it sucking often it still holds a special little place in my heart.  So I think we all (my room mates, Jessica, Leslie and my newest room mate, Parker) are going to head down there tomorrow night.  Friday I am going to ID.  It's my friend Mike's club.  It's okay.  Better than 1984.  It's kind of a hipster paradise though.  I'm pretty sure the arrow bar people invade now.  :::insert pouty face here::: I am not a hipster and never will be and am damned proud of it.  Anyhow it's my excuse to get all sexed up.  Stilleto's, sexy black dresses, garter belts, red lips. Oh wait, I wear my red lips just about everywhere.  They play good music, there is a free fussball, fuzeball, fuzbal? table upstairs and couches to lounge on and lots of coolness just everywhere.  Saturday is Pink Saturday and the roomies and I are going down to the Castro to meet up with my Kevin and Kyle and Micah and Adrianne.    I am quite exhausted as I usually am around this time, too bad my mind won't settle down for a bit.  Maybe I'll have some awesome dreams.  I'm just hoping they won't be about me making out with men I find vulgar and unattractive, or about work.

      Today my new room mate moves in. Last night we all cleaned up the house and watched a south park and then Leslie and I decided to get super stoned.  Let's just say I slept REALLY well.    I feel so underdressed today and really I'm not. Well I am, but I'm trying to slide by with a nice shirt and slacks, but they aren't really all that nice, and the fact that i haven't taken off my hoodie since I got to work is making me look like ew.  But I'm cold and therefor the hoodie is staying on!  I can't wait until today is over.  Thursday and Friday are my half days.  I have plans for this weekend that I'm excited about.

      I caught the bus I needed to catch today, even through I left my house later than I should have.  Then after just one stop a smelly homeless man decided that he would stand RIGHT next to where I was sitting.  His pants were stained with god-knows-what! I was really trying to not be rude, being sly about covering my nose and trying desperately not to breathe. Unfortunately it gets worse.  I got off on my stop and was walking up to my building when I noticed I passed it... by a good amount.  It's so embarassing to have to just turn around.  I was still in on time, which was nice.

      Yesterday I left the house and came face to face with domestic violence.  I almost wanted to laugh, because it was old mexican people and they were moving in slow motion.  Pulling hair and trying to hit one another.  But I didn't.  I was late for work.    Today I woke up 15 minutes earlier. We'll see if I can catch the early bus or not. We'll see.  I just want one good day.  Just one day where I'm prepared and ready to go and everything flows so smoothly.

      I feel very, very not happy tonight. Maybe it's because I'm just tired.  Maybe it's because I came home to find my itunes playing Placebo.  Maybe I'm just kind of sad that my room mates who are my best friends get to move into bigger rooms and I chose to stay in my smaller room, and don't have that "I'm getting a new room bounce in my step" and am jealous. Whatever it is I hope I wake up in a better mood.   I didn't get a chance to do anything with my hair yesterday.  I'm kind of glad, because I think I would have just made an impulse decision.  I've been talking about growing my hair out for a while now. Maybe for the last three years?  I keep getting frustrated with it though and cutting it, usually very, very short.  So here I am at my breaking point.  It's in this super ugly in-between stage.  I need three more inches of growth before it hits my shoulders.  Last time I got all frustrated with it I had Jessica cut me some bangs.  That was my fix for the moment, for the month. Now I'm so sick of them I'm growing them out.  They're longer now, below my eyebrows. Maybe I'm just not destined to have longer hair anymore. But I do want it, I just need someone to tell me what to do, to keep me strong if that is what I need.  It's just so ugly, I'm always pulling it back.  I can keep it up if I really need to...

      Tomorrow I get my hair done.   I'm not sure what I want though.  I want to grow my hair out, BUT I'm really tired of it the way it is.  I'm not sure I can handle the grow out process.  Should I just get it cut short and cute again, or suffer through this miserable ugly stage!  I'm thinking cutting it??? what should I do?

      I had trouble sleeping last night.  I was so tired and didn't end up shutting my eyes until after three-thirty in the morning.  Knowing I had to wake up and clean up all the birthday mess we made last night.  Plates everywhere, floors to sweep up, dishes to do.  I really wanted to do it last night but getting locked out just put the damper on my spirit.  I can't believe I forgot my keys.  I never do that.  I was so angry at myself.    I finally fell asleep though, and I had some crazy dreams.  Like one, I was in the bathtub with this guy that I guess most girls would find hot, dark hair, tan skin, but I was making out with him and thinking in my head 'this is so gross', and things like, 'why am in in this bathtub naked with you, you arent my type. Quit pushing against me! ew'.  I don't necessarily like tan/latin guys mmkay.  I like white boys.  Even in my dreams.  So I was dreaming but my mind was still conflicting with the dream and it was really weird.  It didn't start, it didn't end, it just was.  The bathtub, me and this nasty guy.  I woke up because I thought I heard knocking so I flew out of bed and rushed to the door.  I'm stupid sometimes.  We have a security gate, they'd have to get buzzed in first.  I came back to my bed and crawled under the covers.  Starting dreaming again about something I no longer remember.  It wasn't so horrifying apparently.  Yeah, I didn't think I'd get so upset.  One of the house guests that is here this week, Isabella asked if she could use some of my parfum.  I shrugged and said yes, but after she put it on. I wish I would have said no.  It's my scent.  Sometimes I recognize it on people on the street and it makes me smile.  But someone I know wanting to smell like me is wierd. Wrong.  I've been wearing it so long, it's like part of me.  Plus, I don't think that every girl can wear it and pull it off.  I don't know why I'm getting so upset about it, I just feel weirded out by it.  I was supposed to take the train to my parents house today, but I think I'm getting a ride, so I'll just take the train home tomorrow.

      I feel dissapointed.  I wish things had turned out differently tonight.  I ended up locking myself out of my flat and waiting outside in the cold for thirty minutes.  In not so depressing news I was in Walgreens and came across the cutest condom package ever, so of course I had to buy them.

      It just hit me, It fucking just hit me!  Three years is a long time to not have sex.  God it's a long time to not do a lot of things.  However this isn't about that.. It's not about the people I've made out with and it's not really about the people I whored myself out to before that.  NO it goes back much further.  Okay so I have to take back the word WHORE.  It sounds bad, I was never a whore, but I did sleep with people just to do it ya know, just because it was easy and there were no strings attatched.  Sad part was I lost LOTS of friendships that way ANYWAYS I'm losing track of my point.  So the last BOYFRIEND I HAD was oh, I don't know EONS ago.  I didn't love him.  I never really even thought he was all that cute.  I never had those feelings.  I guess I just never wanted to say no.  he was nice. He liked me, and I saw an opportunity to have complete control over someone so I took it.  I never saw it.  Not sure why I was thinking about it today but there it was.  I controlled every aspect of that relationship because I could.  I'm not even a controlling kind of person.  I'm quite passive.  I enjoy being told what to do.  I like not making the decisions.  I don't mind making some but not all, not even half really.  I like being the passenger.  And yet I was a total control freak bitch when it came to this relationship.  I don't know why I even stayed with him as long as I did, and when it came down to it he wanted to break up with me but was too chicken so I had to break up with him.  I even had control over that.  It was so weird.  I didn't really care though I guess.    Am I a bad person?  I can't even see myself like that anymore, well it was 5 years ago. Which makes me feel even worse...

      Today is just me and the boss.  Of course today was also the day I decided to sleep in.  So I skipped the shower and threw on my clothes and ran out the door.  I look like SHIT!  Oh, and of course they day I just throw on some clothes and pull my hair back I get wierd guys on the street yelling at me.  One guy drove by all slow like, stuck his head out the window and yelled "hey baby!"  so unoriginal.  I've heard it all.  Even in spanish.  Please, if you're going to yell lude or sexual comments at me, please come at me with something new.  Maybe take some time to think about it before you blurt it out, or better yet don't say anything at all.  SOMEONE SAVE ME.   I'm not creative at all, well in some ways I am >:)and artisticaly but not in the letter writing way.  I have to come up with some form letter for a registration packet for some stupid seminar.  I suck.  Bed sounds so much better. At least today is my last day (this week) that I work 13 hours.  Tomorrow I work 5 hours and have the entire weekend off!

      I'm so tired.  This working two jobs thing is going to kill me.  We'll see how long I last.  I'm hoping that my nice new comfy office job will make me full time so I can quit my other job, but until then I'll be slaving away at both jobs, trying to finally get out of debt, plus I think I want to buy an iMac. So yeah.  I have goals.  I also want to have a nice cushy lump of cash in my savings account for those just in case moments.  You know those moments, when you just want to walk up to your boss and be like,  "if you want _____, get it your fucking self!  I quit!"   and not have to worry about having money for rent or for bills or for food for the next three months.  PLUS, I need to start saving up for a deposit on the new place I'll be moving to in October.  I was seriously debating staying in San Francisco.  I don't know.  I love the weather.  I don't know where else I would go anyhow.  I never have problems moving to new places.  I'm very independant, but I hate being lonely.  I like to at least have some friends where I live.  I'm not totally immune to being self conscience.  I'm going off on the biggest tangent...  I have the biggest headache right now.  Maybe it's just because I'm tired, or maybe it's more.  I got a bit upset today, my mom called and gave me some upsetting news that I'm just not ready to share with the world. It makes me feel like the biggest loser failure ever.  Basically I fucked up a lot when I was 18, 19, and 20.  Nothing illegal or immoral unless you count NOT paying your credit card bills as either of those.  Thus the reason for being in debt and having to work two jobs now.  fuck it.  I can't think straight.  I'm totally depressed that I'm going to pass out before midnight tonight.  I wish someone was here to kiss me goodnight.

      Damnit.    I'm supposed to be in bed.  I gave myself a curfew, so I would make sure to get enough sleep however, I'm just not tired. NOPE NOPE NOPE NOT ME!  I'm going to make myself though I promise, in fifteen minutes.    So today was my first day at my new job, and well it was a bit busy.  And then to make matters worse I went to my other job and it was so busy I almost died!  seriously.  dead.  Okay, I didn't almost die but I felt like it.  I just wanted a beer or something to help it all go away.  For my new commute I have to take the fucking bus!  I don't ride the bus, unless I have too. I take bart or the muni metro but the fucking bus?! no. no way.  ::insert disgusted look here::  I have to take not only one bus, but two busses.  The first one isn't all that bad.  It can get a bit ghetto at times, it goes by my old apartment complex in the Filmore but it's not that bad in the morning commute times.  My second bus though which takes me from job A to job B is almost too much to handle.  At first it seems normal enough. Pretty empty, with all the uppity union street people riding it.  I guess I fit into that catagory and then BAM you're in china town and all the fucking chinese people get on.  I know it sounds bad, but these aren't normal american chinese people. These are people living in China town thinking they are still back in the mother land or something.  They don't speak english and insist on sitting far away from each other and YELLING in Chi-fucking-nese across you while you're just sitting there praying the Union Square stop comes soon.  Oh it gets worse. Yes it does.  While they are yelling across you they are blowing their gross smelling breathe on you until you finally have to turn away and wince while trying to take a breath that won't smell of god knows what.  Why don't they just sit next to each other?  Why do they have to yell.  I must sound like a total fucking asshole and usually leave this kind of thought to myself but I just can't, not this time.  I don't have a problem with chinese people.  Every other chinese person that doesn't live in China Town is fine.  They smell fine, brush their teeth, etc.  But these people that live in China Town just don't - and it's pissing me off.  Like all those fucking hippies that think that patchouli will drown out their funk.  I've had to ask one of those smelly fucks to put their arm down once while riding on bart. What can I say I'm a snob, a bitch I know, I don't care.  I hate smelly people.  I used to have a sweating problem but I took care of that shit with a little drysol, but even when I was sweating a lot I never, ever, ever smelled!  I can not bathe for like three days probably and still not smell.  I don't know how they get that way?    On days like this it would be oh-so-nice to come home to someone and just be able to fall asleep in their arms.  No talking, no nothing, just gentle embracing and sleep.  oh yeah, my psycho room mate just came home.  And I'm pretty sure Parker is going to be our new room mate once he's out of here.  I can't wait until the end of the month.

      Okay so I didn't exactly go to bed, like I should have.  I fight sleep.  I know I do.  If no one is here to tell me to go to bed, I just don't even if I AM practically falling asleep.  I just got all excited.  The SF Pride parade is this 27th!  I love the pride parade.  It's so fun, and it can only mean one thing.  The 26th is PINK SATURDAY!!!    Pink Saturday is the funnest night of the year in SF, well since they took our Halloween festivities away :( boo on the city of San Francisco for that.  I'm not bitter though.  Really, I'm not.  So anyhow Pink Saturday is when they close off the Castro district (the district in SF that is largely populated by gay,lesbian,& transgender folk) and have a huge LET'S GET ALL SORTS OF FUCKED UP AND DRUNK ON THE STREETS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT STRAIGHT party.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm as straight as they come, but I have a billion gay boyfriends. :)  So I get to be the token faghag of the night and getting all sorts of sloppy out of control drunk like in the streets.  It's so much fun.  Last year I was alternating shots of southern comfort with shots of royal gate vodka, quite possibly the worlds cheapest and nasties vodka EVER.  It's pretty ghetto.  Tastes the way nail polish remover smells. The label proudly proclaims on the label "Puts the 'Ahhhh' in Vodkahhh", but really it's just pure shit.  80% alcohol so it does the job, but kills you a little with each sip.  SO gross.  but I guess that's what you get when you drink vodka that is made in San Jose, Ca.  So I was drinking a LOT, I could barely make it up my stairs when I got home.  I think I even fell asleep, er rather passed out on my stairs for a little while before making it all the way up to my flat.    So yes, another reason to get shitty drunk.    bedtime for real.

      Jessica came home, and we went out for beers at our favorite trashy bar the Zeitgeist!  I had maybe a beer and a half and was feeling quite loaded.  Mixing liquor with pills always does that shit to me.  I make for a cheap date.  I'm drunk and ready to go in just under 20 minutes.  I stayed too long.  Had a few more beers and kept my buzz, then finally I realized I hadn't anything to eat in a long, long time.  I felt like I was going to pass out and die if I didn't get some food.  Thus my decision to walk home by myself.    The place is a 10-15 minute walk from my house.  Perfect stumbling distance home.  Hell I've even taken a cab home before, a whole 4 measely blocks.  But I was walking, and my legs felt all numb like and I was dreaming about food and of passing out when I realized. Shit!  I'm drunk and it's not even 10pm yet.  When did we start drinking?  8:30? or was it 9?  on a Sunday night?  What's wrong with me.  LUSH. LIGHT WEIGHT LUSH.  :)  My fucking left over pizza tastes  SO  good!    I realized today again for like the one millionth (is that a word?) time that I am in fact a snob.  S-N-O-B.  I'm mean.  I'm a bitch.  Most importantly though I don't really care.  When I go home to visit my friends and family I'm usually way overdressed, I think someone threw around the word pretentious once.  My own mother has been calling me a snob since high school.  I used to tell her to shut up, that I wasn't a snob, but that I had standards.  And I intended to keep to them.  She loves me and my "standards" very much though, and wouldn't have me any other way.    Tomorrow I start my new job + my old job for a total of 12 hours of work.  I'm going to die.  I can just feel it.  That is why I had to go out early tonight. Why I had to come home and sober up and why I have to be in bed by 11:30. I have to find some clothes to wear tonight so that tomorrow morning I won't flip out and get all "girly" and not be able to find something to wear.  I hate when I feel uncomfortable in all my clothes.  This way the decision is made and it's final.    I hate being too girly.  I can't believe how some girls act.  I'm girly enough, I suppose.  I want a guy to hold my hand.  kisses-yes, hugs-yes. Do I want to ask a guy if I look fat-HELL NO! I can look in a fucking mirror thank you very much. Do I need to depend on someone so much that I lose track of who I really am and what I like and ditch all my friends because I'm in "LOVE/LUST"? NO NO NO!  Someone to sleep next too, to look at me in THAT way, to make me laugh, and someone to share stuff with and have lots and lots and lots of sex with, that's it.  I still want to be able to be me. To hang out with my friends, and to live my own life but just have someone special to come home to and share all details with.   Maybe I'm delusional, maybe I'm still a bit drunk, or maybe I'm just wierd like everyone says but that's all I really want.    Damnit!  it's only like 10:40pm or something and I'm going to pass out at my keyboard.   goodnight.

      Yesterday I made up my mind that I am way to old to go to festival shows.  I will go to ONE more this year,  the Curiosa Festival and then that will be it.  No more for me.  I realized I was surrounded by high school AND YOUNGER kids.  I kept wishing there were benches or assigned seating.  I hated being outside in the hot sun, which is probably the saddest thing because yesterday only got to be 73° as the HIGH yesterday.  Then I hated being outside when it got cold at night and yeah I think 53° is cold when you're standing or sitting on grass.  Again, where was my seat and or bench?  I laughed at all the stupid kids, and some adults for their choice in clothing, or the fact that they thought they were going to be immune to getting a sunburn and just decided to not wear sunscreen.  I drown my pasty ass in that shit before I go anywhere.  I laughed at all the parents that got dragged along with their kids and were having a miserable time.  I laughed at all the older people that just refused to grow up and were trying so hard to be young and hip.  I never, ever want to be one of those people.     After 5 hours of being there, and looking at 5 more hours of being there I started to get ultra whiney.  I'm tired, this band sucks, who's doing the sound because they need to turn the vocals up, I need a fucking place to sit down!, what a waste they came all the way out here to play for thirty fucking minutes?  stupid.  Right about then Kevin and I decided to go sit on the lawn around the main stage that didn't have anyone playing on it until six pm.  He fell asleep.  He fucking fell asleep.  So I had no other choice but to cuddle up next to him and try to sleep too.  It's pretty boring sitting there next to someone asleep.  Then the stupid little bugs that start to come out in the evening that flocked to the grass started to bother me, my phone rang and my room mate was trying to find us so they came over and kept me company for about 10 minutes while Kevin slept.  I ultimately was an asshole and woke him up because I was bored.    I saw more tits and ass than I ever needed to see.  Fat man-tits and underage girl ass.  It's not that smart to wear a thong with a flowy like mini skirt when there is wind.  At one point there were 4 little junior high school girls walking around all dressed pretty much the same, just in different colored skirts and the wind came and blew all their skirts up.  Kevin started making gagging noises which sent me into a fit of laughter.  It's so wierd that he can be friends with girls and even sleep next to me while I'm just in my undies but he gets totally grossed out by anything sexual with girls.  I know he's gay and maybe that is why I can't help but just die laughing.  What's even more amusing is that he's sleeping with my boss.  So yeah.  I guess I didn't have that great of time.  It was fun to see some of the bands play.  But the experience just wasn't worth it to me.  It made me realize that there are a whole bunch of little kids out there making me older really fast.    The only awesome thing I got to experience yesterday was this guy Derek.  Okay I didn't EXPERIENCE him, but he rode up with Leslie and I.  He was kind of quiet for most of the day.  I found out he had cancer.  It's his second time battling cancer and he's only 24.  His poor little head had just a few sparse hairs clinging on, but it was all hidden under a hat so only we really knew because he took his hat off a few times to put on or take off his hoodie.  He was so funny and full of life, he was trying to pick fights with the girl in the car behind us while sitting in the worst traffic of our lives.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Then he wanted us all to go to some afterparty where some of the bands would be playing and djing and crap.  He was drinking all day and just I don't know being normal and today at 7am he had to get up and go to a chemo appointment.  It king of made me feel like a fucking idiot.  I was tired, and bitchy and blah blah blah and here this guy is, kind of dying and shit, who knows.  I don't know where I was going with this thought.  Fuck it.  I'm a lazy bastard who likes to drink, and sleep and eat. :)    I could so crawl back into bed for 20 more minutes before having to get ready for work. oh yeah.

      I'm exhausted.  I just got home from seeing a whole shit-load of bands.   the strokes (but I left after 2 songs) Beastie Boys Violent Femmes Yeah Yeah Yeah's Bad Religion The Rapture Death Cab for Cutie The Stills The Killers uhm. yeah that's all the bands I saw, there were other bands but I either couldn't stand to hear/see them or just couldn't stand anymore.  I was so tired having had nearly zero sleep from last night.. and then standing out in the heat.  Thank god for my spf 45 super sunblock to protect my fragile pasty ass.  The the heat turned to bitter fucking cold.  My feet are still numb.  then Trying to get out and all the traffic and just so much shit.    The highlight was really just talking shit about the way everyone was dressed or the stupid shit they were doing with my gay-boyfriend Kevin.  So mean, so evil and yet so much fun.  I know, I know, I'm going to hell.  I'm tired.  I said that already.  Bed time.

      I wonder why I even bother sometimes.  So I finally got sleepy a little after four this morning, I crawled in bed and shut my eyes and then realized I needed to be up at 9:30.  I sat up leaned over to grab my alarm clock and realized that I was going to be wake in 5 hours. Doesn't sound all that bad. I've definitly performed with less sleep like 2 or 1 or surprise, surprise none, but that is not the point here.  I got up, called my gay-boyfriend Kevin and we mumbled that we were both awake and then hung up.  He's coming to pick me up around 11:15ish and we're off to the boring town of Mountain View.  Well Lelsie and Lisa have to still wake up.  They aren't even awake NOW, and they only have like 20 something minutes to get ready or they're going to be late.    OKAY, we're only going to some stupid festival concert type thing, but still.  If you tell someone a time you should stick to it.  My gay-boyfriend can't stay all night so we wanted to get there early so he could still get his money's worth.  I'm going to be a little bit pissed if they aren't awake when I'm done typing out this post.  The sad thing is I can feel myself kind of getting angry already, and I shouldn't.  I'm not the one who paid for my ticket.  Leslie got me my ticket.  So if she holds us up what's the big deal?  I don't know.   I'm not sure if San Francisco is wearing me thin or what it is, but something doesn't feel right.  I know this city too well now.  It's just HOME to me. I miss the excitement I used to feel when I first moved here. I get it when I go to New York, maybe that's why I've been going so often these last few years.  If only I didn't have these damned family members that I love too much holding me back.  Who knows.  :)  I love my family.  I'm an aunt, and watching my neice grow up is crazy.  It's scary to know my LITTLE brother (who's not so little at 6' 5") has a baby girl.  And he does all the nasty work like change icky diapers and stuff.  EW.  I'm definitely not ready for babies.  I still think they are a little bit gross, and a hell of a lot of work I'm not cut out for yet.  Then there is my grandmother.  She's my only grandparent left..er rather.. EVER.  Not that the others are dead, just her husband/my grandfather.  But my fathers parents could give a rats ass about me, or my brother.  My poor dad, got the shitty end of the stick in parents.  So babies and old people are holding me back.  Maybe I'll move for 6 months only and then come back.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I know I'm not going to leave any time soon.  the only thing that could persue me otherwise would be for  sex  love.  Or a fucking kick-ass amazing job I couldn't get anywhere else.   Okay I think my serious lack of sunlight is starting to depress me.  I work in a basement and my room has no windows.  Can it get any more dreary?   I need to go wake up some bitches.

      Well surprise, surprise.  I can't sleep.  I don't seem to be doing too much of that these days.  Even if I take/do/inhale mind altering substances of the prescription or the plant type.  I just can't sleep.  My body becomes overwhelmingly tired, and yet my mind continues to race on.  Wondering about tomorrow, the next day, the next week, month, year.  Where I'll be in two months and how I'll spend all that extra money that is coming in, that I really need to make sure I put in a new savings account that I'm going to have to open up, instead of to all those cute little boutiques around town, and shoe stores and to that damned M.A.C. counter at Nordstroms.  I wish someone would curl up beside me and just play with my hair ever so lightly.  It always makes me feel so relaxed and sleepy like.  Too bad I can't just order someone into my bed.    I found our new room mate.  I knew she was the one.  We instantly were friends.  I knew she was going to be awesome.  It's not 100% finalized, I need Jessica to come home and meet her for it to be all said and done.  She came over at 6:20 to see the place and didn't end up leaving until ten after eight.  We both know a lot of the same people and a few we both  hate  no despise.  Her name is Jaclyn, well to name one and she's just so overly pretentious I could smack her fake, drawn on eye brows right off her mishapen little face. Me a hater, no way.  I just have this deep belief that  ugly people shouldn't breed , er rather that if you are going to be a cunterella at least have the decency to leave the party when the clock strikes midnight.  Anyhow, we joked and I said the word  cunt  in various different ways a few hundred times and then she left.   I'm going to have to force myself to go wash my face and crawl into bed now, I have a busy friday ahead of me.

      Something is making me sad, and I'm not quite sure what it is.  Not sad, as in crying and moping around, but sad as in this little tingling feeling inside that makes everything seem more serious that it should be.  I woke up today and it was foggy and overcast, but now it's sunny and a little bit warmer.  It's still pretty cold though only 57° outside.  I went to my interview, and I'm not quite sure how it turned out.  On one hand I think I have the job, because my room mate highly recomended me and they need someone and I seem to fit the bill.  On the other hand though maybe I'm just a loser and really, really suck and just didn't get it at all.  Who knows.  Tonight is my turn to do the interviewing as Parker will be coming by to check out the place.  I have a good feeling about her.  I want her to want to live with me/us.  I just don't want to be the one to tell her no, if the others don't like her.  But whatever.  I'm tired of making myself so stressed out over stupid shit.    Jessica's birthday is on the 18th.  The baby is all grown up.  She will officially be 21.  She's been 21 for a few years now thanks to the lovely fake ID I got for her.  Anyhow the darling little 14 year old girl I adopted into my life will be officially legal to do anything in any state now.  She's making me feel old.  I'm really hungry and really tired.  I need to clean the house though.

      Today is my Friday.  Tomorrow I have an interview, I need to clean, clean, clean my house before I show the place off to  urlLink Parker  the girl I want to move in.    I have to start printing out my new schedule proposal for my job.  It sounds like a big deal, but really I'm only going to be cutting 4.5 - 6 hours from my week and I think it will be best if I actually lay out a diagram for them to see how it will work.  Seriously I work with idiots.  It's best if things are drawn out, in color preferably.  I haven't been taking my  urlLink somas  lately, and instead getting really stoned with Leslie.  Last night was one of those.. oh wow, I just want to lay here and listen to music kind of highs, of course I was stuffing my face with a kit kat that i had bought earlier, but it was nice.  I haven't done that since the first few years of college.  Sometimes I wish I would have finished going to school and actually graduated, other times I am glad I didn't.  I don't know what I want to do, career wise.  I always just thought I'd be a lady who lunches and drinks gin and collins all day.  But hey who knows, I'm going off on a tangent.  So yeah,  my stupid side is killing me again today.  It looks like I'm going to be eating advil like M & M's today.   I gave Leslie my last $5.00 like a stupid ass.  And now I'm REALLY broke, what am I going to do for lunch???  ***in addition I am having a spin off from  urlLink Greg the b/f's post  about girls who pose for "photographers".  I was one of those not too long ago.  Only I didn't show my front side nude,just my ass because I wasn't all that comfortable knowing EVERYONE in the world could see me, well if they looked in his portfolio.  He was doing a themed photoshoot with some other girls too.  Here are  urlLink my 2 shots .  I cut my head off though, because I don't need naughty photo's of me floating around on the internet, what if my dad saw. EW. gross. And they are small because well I'm kind of shy about them. especially the one shot.. of my ass!   Anyhow, I'm not sure why girls are like.. yes let's get naked for the camera.  I was more like.. Let's get naked and do it.  I had a crush on the boy at the time.  he didn't even have to have a camera in front of him for me to get naked, but hey whatever.

       "First you look so strong Then you fade away The sun will blind my eyes I love you anyway Thirsty for your smile I watch you for a while You are a vapour trail In a deep blue sky  Tremble with a sigh Glitter in your eye You seem to come and go I never seem to know And all my time Is yours as much as mine We never have enough Time to show our love"   The song reminds me of my freshman and sophmore year in high school.  1992.  I was so in love.  No not REALLY in love.  I've never been REALLY in LOVE.   But I was so in love with an idea of how everything should be or should have been. Looking back it never really happens the way you think it should.    I thought I'd have everything I wanted by now.  I thought I'd finally figure out what the hell I want to do with my life, but I don't.  I thought I would feel great, but lately I think I've reached a life-time low point for feeling increadibly self-conscience, and over the stupidest things.  Take for instance my height.  I can't help how tall I am.  And yet, I still get upset when I'm walking down the road and I'm towering over all the stupid short people that live in this stupid city.  I'm taller than 75% or MORE of the population of San Francisco.  Maybe it's just that this town is too small for me?  I'm only 5'10" not a fucking giraffe or anything, but I can't help but feel as if I'm too tall.  All of my friends both male and female are shorter than me with the exception of like a handfull who are the same height as me.  I love my short friends, but at the same time I envy them so much for being little, cute, petite, and well.. being tall doesn't excude any of it.  I'm just here to get the cups down off the top shelf for my 2 shorty room mates.  My purpose in life = to reach the top shelf.  ONLY IF IT'S THE TOP SHELF LIQUORS!!!  So I have to ask why am I being so stupid over something I have and had no control over.  Why can't I just forget about it and stop being so fucking hung up on it.   I'm tall, I have a great fucking ass, and my legs look like sex in stilletos.    Besides amputation there is no way I'm going to shrink so I better just get over it.

      My room mate found a new full-time job.  I'm so excited for her because she needed to find a full time job that paid a decent amount, so she could pay her bills and rent on time with out borrowing money.  It was never her plan to be in the situation she was, but never the less it always happens to the best people.  So a while ago she found this part time job that is pretty awesome and super easy and pays decent but not well enough for the fact that the job is for 20 hours a week no more/no less.  So technically she could have paid rent and bills with the amount she made, but that would have been it!  The job only grosses $1000 a month.    Hello cost of living San Francisco style!    Our Apartment is $2250 a month not including utilities and maybe we want to eat too. They kept talking about how after the dot.com crashes back in the mid to late 90's would bring down the property rates, but that was just a big fucking lie. It doesn't matter though.  I manage.    Now here comes the relevant part of the story... So She's leaving her part time job and she told them about me, at my request.  I already have a full time job and am looking for a part time job. So I'm perfectly content working 20 hours.  I don't want any more. Plus I'm a kick-ass employee.  I'll be working some 10 hour days but that's not all that bad.  It'll be worth it to make nearly 3k a month, instead of just 2k.  I could actually pay off my bills, and not just promise too.  Oh and think of all the shopping I could do.  Oh that is bad thinking. bad, bad, bad!    So Thursday at 11 I have my interview.  This means I need to go and sit down with my current boss and his assistant and give them my new work schedule.  Maybe I should type up a proposal now...

      Today I cried at work.  I hate when I do that shit.  Seriously.  I can't control it, I have inappropriate emotions.  I was mad, furious and yet instead of acting like it and getting that mean flash in my eye I get tears and a choked up feeling in my throat.   I come off looking weak.  I was trying make my point about a promotion I didn't get because our NEW boss comes in and decides to promote someone who works ONE MEASELY DAY A WEEK to be my new lead.  WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!  Not with out some resistance from me.  I talked it out with my boss and we came to some sort of agreement, but in my head I had already decided to take the childish route and NOT help out this other person with anything.  He doesn't know any of the procedures and I'm not going to help him. I'll just hand him the 3" thick manual on trouble shooting and walk away with my nose in the air.  I don't want to be mean to him, but I'm not really feeling like being too nice either.  fuckers.  And to top it all off he threw the fact that I know about his SEXUAL life because he's dating Kevin, who is one of my best friends who just can't keep a secret.  So what could I say back?   And now my two adorably sweet room mates want me to go out with them to the Zeitgeist, this awesome bar with like 50 picnic tables out back and cheap pitchers of beer and other stuff... but for some reason I'm feeling like shit and dragging my feet about it.  I just got home, and now they want to rush me off.  I'll have to finish my thought on this later.  I have a beer to drink before we go out and a shower to take.

      Saturday afternoon needed some pinned back hair and  urlLink red lips .    So I was just going to work.  Just going to my stupid job where I'm stuck in a basement and no one else can see me, but I was feeling kind of saucy.  Like a rebel.  Actually I was just feeling super bitchy and needed a way to convey it to the rest of the world and nothing screams bitch like red lips and black sunglasses.  today I think I'll play nice.

      I've been especially lazy lately. I need to find a new job too, however being lazy and not really making an effort kind of hurts my chances for that.  I finally uploaded the pictures from my camera and now I have a new picture I can use, instead of 6 month old ones.  I'm not making any promises on cuteness or anything but if you'd like to see it  urlLink HERE  it is.  I saw the movie  Saved  today and thought it was kind of cute.  The scariest part is I knew kids like that when I was in high school.  They all went to the same church/school aptly named  'The Capitol Christian Center' .  There  urlLink website  isn't nearly as scary as the real thing.  Anyhow Eva Amurri is hot and totally cute.  I'd be her friend if I was stuck at that shit-hole of a high school. I'm going off on a tangent here, but the movie was good.  I'm still really bothered by my room mates coment on girls being threatening. I just can't get over it.  I refuse.  I won't make a huge deal about it, but in my mind you better believe I'm fuming over such a stupid remark.    I need to get laid.

      This is me jumping on the bandwagon...     Got bored.  Real bored.  I tend to do stupid stuff when I get bored, that or drink a lot, and well since rent was due on the 1st and I have yet to give it to my landlord I'm thinking now is NOT the time to be spending it on alcohol.  Technically I have until the 5th to cough up the dough with out a penalty, a nice little grace period. Tomorrow I will go out and about and scrounge up the dough.  My paycheck should be direct deposited by now so I'm not too concerned.  I'm going to sell some clothes I've never ever worn and never ever will wear to crossroads tomorrow and make some more money because I need to go see  Saved .  I need a new job.  The job I have is so mundane.  I bitch about my job way too often so I'll just stop talking about that subject.  It's my, dare I say   FRIEND    urlLink Mike's  birthday on the 5th.  I've been working on a birthday card collage type  urlLink thingy  but I'm kind of stuck, and I don't really know if I like it...    I hate getting a creative idea and then letting it go to shit half way through.  oh well, it's supposed to be the thought, but damn it is UGLY!!!    So today I posted a new post on craigslist for the room we need to rent out. THE PERFECT GIRL responded back.  Jessica and I loved her.  She's fabulous!  However I think my other room mate Leslie might not like her.  I showed her the email and her picture and tons of stuff, and she was like.. quiet. Then I mentioned that I would kind of like to live in an all girl house.  That way I can walk around in my chonies and not really care who was looking, not that I care anyhow, but sometimes it makes guys that I live with uncomfortable.  She kind of snarled or did something I can't describe and so I pressed on to see what that look was for and she said something along the lines of "well sometimes having another girl in the house can be threatening."  MY JAW DROPPED!  First off, only you can make yourself feel uncomfortable in your own home, and second the last thing I want to know is that someone I consider my friend is threatened by girls.  Maybe Leslie thinks she is the only cute one in this house of three girls and one psycho guy.  This girl, her name is Parker is WAY cute and therefore could be a threat? I don't know.  I'm thinking that is the only reason Leslie wouldn't want her to be our roomie.  Besides if you were a new girl moving in with three girls that were already good friends and stuff I'd think the new person would feel more threatened? but no! Wait!  I don't see why anyone should feel threatened? What is it with girls and their stupid issues?  Am I the only one that doesn't have tons of fucked up "girl issues"?!?  Sure I feel fat from time to time, and uncomfortable in my own skin every now and then, but no one has ever made me feel "threatened" I don't even like to use the word.  Is this a common thing?  I think I'll go polish my nails or maybe finish hanging up all my clothes I suddenly have acquired.  I'm feeling a bit pissy after thinking about what I'm thinking about.

      My crazy room mate returned.  We all knew it would happen soon, but I'm never quite prepared for when it does happen.  This time he tried to tell us that it was our fault that he started to freak out again.  It was our fault because we didn't try to intervene.  Tried to make his Meth problem our fault.    hahaha  It's almost   too   ridiculously funny!    First off He's not my friend, he's just a psycho room mate I used to think was an okay guy before he started getting all creepy on me and doing icky, nasty drugs like Meth.  Stick to the good drugs if you're going to do drugs, like pharms, who would ever choose to be a meth head anyhow?  He was never someone I would ever go out with, just an acquaintance I knew and lived with and who has since become the main character in some of the funniest stories I've ever had the pleasure of telling in my whole life.  He is seriously a paranoid tweeker type and it is so funny.  Well in hindsight.  Sometimes it's just too much and I lose it and have to be the super bitch and yell and scream and cause a scene because he's just flipped out and starts accusing us (myself and my 2 OTHER room mates and dearest friends, Jessica and Leslie.) of stealing his gay porn that he doesn't even have, talking shit about him, well now that is entirely true but he freaks us out sometimes. I apparently am the leader of our Secret Meetings we have to discuss him and how to take him down, and I guess I've been known to talk to the government about him too.  It's just so far out there...  My side/ribs still hurt.  Tearing a 'soft tissue' muscle isn't the best thing I guess.  Thank god for drugs.  But wait.. NOT THOSE KIND OF DRUGS.  Just pain killers and somas and well my Lexapro too.  I haven't been taking it though, I want to heal before I go back on that.  My anxiety hasn't been acting up lately anyhow.

      Hi.  Can I tell you something?   It's good to be back in California.  Oh New York City is gorgeous and I had a fantastic time just being there, but staying with rude bitches is so not my idea of fun or a vacation.  I also am not sure if I ever want to go back there or on any vacation with anyone ever again!  I'm used to doing my own thing when I want, how I want, with whom I want and clearly this was not to be on this trip.    The ONLY FUN THING I got to do was head on down to the Lower East Side to see my dear friend Eric at his place of employment, The Luna Lounge.  He gave me all the free drinks I could stand, which didn't end up being too many since I was on perscription pain pills and soma's.  But it was good to see him again, kisses on the cheek are thrilling.    This just reminds me of how sad I really am.  Doesn't matter though because this isn't a post about that.  So I did some shopping, came away with a nice little increase in cuteness to my wardrobe.    Oh but stumbling home from The Luna Lounge completely loaded and off my head on pills and liquor and finding my way into a pizza place and throwing the money at the man for my slice and then making the mistake of waiting for the F train to come when it wasn't and then deciding to take a cab but realizing that it would be insane to take it from Delancey and Essex all the way up to W. 193rd so you threw a fit to get out at Penn station and slurring the words "it doesn't matter which side of the station I'm catching the A train bitch" to the cab driver and then laughing because you realized you called him a bitch, and you only left him a $2.00 tip.  Oh and that fun part about passing out on the train while riding through the Harlem exit at 125th...  That was it, the only fun part of the trip I remember.  The right side of my body is and has been killing me for over a week now, to the point that I'm taking 800mg+ of ibuprofen a day, other perscription pain pills on top of that and soma's to just numb it all away!  Oh and how did this injury happen.  I stretched and pulled a muscle.. a soft tissue muscle between 2 ribs.  Oh and when I sneeze yeah, excrutiating pain, did I metion how much California makes me sneeze?  I'm allergic to everything here.    Am I really all that happy to be back?

      I'm trying so hard to not be negative.  I really am.  I'm trying to see how happy I am and how wonderful life can be and I'm trying to have more fun.  There's just one problem though, and that is I'm just not happy.  I'm just not having enough fun and life is just shit, well right now anyhow.  I've been pondering the idea of going back on Lexapro.  But how can artificial happiness cure what's really bothering me.  The fact that I feel like a complete failure, that I don't know what I really want and can't for the life of me just see something through 100%.  with all the thoughts and ideas I have and all the plans I make for myself I fucking just throw them all away.  I'm never fucking good enough.  Not even for myself.    Thankfully I bought a six pack of stella and a bottle of kettle one to drown any feelings I might have away tonight.  Apparently though I haven't had enough to drink.  I wish I wasn't so up and down. Maybe I should take more drugs and think less.  I practically have a whole fucking pharamacy sitting on my dresser calling out to me.   I'm really not feeling all that sorry for myself.  I just wish I could be less stupid at times and not so jealous of other peoples happiness.    Besides that depressing shit, ID was fun last night.  Diego came out and got drunk with us.  I can't believe the bar tender gave him a glass of rum. not a shot, not a mixed drink but like straight on a GLASS of rum.  I had a large sip, I shared drinks, I danced.  I stepped on peoples feet while trying to push my way through the crowds.  I met a few nice girls outside.  I didn't end up in any ugly pictures this time (I don't think anyhow).  The Paradise Boys weren't that bad.  Well, I thought they sounded good live.  The music was fun and I danced a lot.  The lyrics could be better on some songs, but it was fun music to listen and dance too.  I was drunk, but was more composed and when we left I felt sober even though I knew I wasn't.  Diego and I came back to my house and passed out watching a movie.  I slept in my clothes, and woke up looking like a pirate.  My room was a mess, thankfully my friends know I'm a messy girl and don't seem to mind.  I...  fuck it.

      ID is tonight.  Let last week be a lesson.  1. NO GETTING TOO CRAZY ON THE DANCE FLOOR! My legs were sore for three days afterwards.  2. I ended up in way too many pictures looking all sorts of fucked up. Get drunk, but try to stay somewhat photogenic.  3. Get drunk. You have more fun that way. Get drunk BEFORE and save money though, then you just need to buy a few drinks to maintain the drunkeness that you love so much.  4. Be cautious of the SPARKS! It's like crack. no... seriously.  5. Laugh at yourself because you are absolutely rediculous sometimes!

      I&nbsp;always wished I looked like my mom when I was a kid.&nbsp; Straight white-blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful.&nbsp; Of course I didn't look much like my dad either, dark thick black hair, tan, green eyes.&nbsp; I'm the mutt.&nbsp; I got this sort of wavy, curly brown hair, brown eyes, and a sad look I have to constantly fight to free myself from.&nbsp; My mom was always strong and ambitious and my dad was always wild and funny.&nbsp; I don't think I absorbed anything from either of them.&nbsp; How can the apple fall so far away from the tree?  &nbsp; I missed my stop on the bus today.&nbsp; I had to walk back two blocks.&nbsp; The fog is thick and heavy again today and the droplets of moisture swirl in the air.&nbsp; I pulled the hood of my sweater up over my head and walked on.&nbsp; I really need to make something happen soon.&nbsp; I saw the pictures from ID.&nbsp; I'm in a few, er a lot of them.&nbsp; I'm displeased.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am too white, and too skinny and... too drunk!&nbsp; This Friday I'll wear something classy.&nbsp;

      I woke up at the sound of my alarm but layed back down and drifted off to sleep.&nbsp; I was dreaming about something, or someone and didn't even bother to reset my alarm.&nbsp; I simply just turned it off.&nbsp; I awoke twenty minutes later barley able to move.&nbsp; I could have slept the day away given the chance.&nbsp; I told myself five more minutes and quickly drifted back to sleep only to suddenly wake up and realize I was setting myself up for disaster.&nbsp; I got out of bed, and pulled on some clothes.&nbsp; Grey slacks, maroon top, black loafers... and bright green socks that say  'I Feel Lucky!'  all over them.&nbsp; Too bad they didn't say I feel shitty instead.&nbsp; Why must I be such a misfit when it comes to getting dressed?  My stomache hurts, but what else is new.&nbsp; I am anxious to see the pictures from last Friday.&nbsp; I stayed up too late last night reading.&nbsp; I find myself all too often bored and it sucks.&nbsp; Vacation Vacation Vacation.&nbsp; Just seven weeks away...  Diego is supposed to come and hang out with me this afternoon.&nbsp; We'll see if he makes it or not, he's notorious for flaking and cancelling.&nbsp; He's a sweet boy though.&nbsp;   Yesterday Jon, a guy I work with told me that if I do what I want when I want in moderation everything will be okay.&nbsp; I really want to believe it.&nbsp; I have a hard time&nbsp;keeping things in&nbsp;moderation though.

      my tummy was gurgling and growling so loudly I know my boss in the next room heard it.&nbsp; It acts like I'm starving.&nbsp; I feel like I'm starving.&nbsp; But I know I'm not.&nbsp; 5,000 calories a day can't be starving!&nbsp; I eat more than anyone I know.&nbsp; What's going on?   Also I'm pissed off at my hair.&nbsp; As usual.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to be growing and if it doesn't start showing some signs of getting longer I'm going to hack it all off.&nbsp; I'm trying to have patience, but that has never really been my strong point.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give it another month, and then I'll decide .&nbsp;   More Enon last night and today.   I'm on a quest for new music though, recommendations please.

      I've been listening to a lot of music lately, too bad it's all old junk  Enon - High Society The Cure - Disintegration Bauhaus - Crackle Ride - Nowhere  I'm in love with Enon again.&nbsp; Someone brought in a CD to work that had a song on it so I've been listening to the CD like crazy ever since.&nbsp;   Music is all that preoccupies my mind, that and waiting to see the pictures from last friday.&nbsp; I'm quite frightened at what I'll see.&nbsp; Next friday I will remember to be drunk AND photogenic.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      it was three in the morning and I still couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I know, I know, it's a Saturday night why do I want to be asleep.&nbsp; Why was I trying?&nbsp; Well I had no where to go.&nbsp; Jessica and Parker had some boys over, Leslie went out with some girl and I well, I just got home from work and needed to relax a little and eat some dinner and basically there was just nothing for me to do.&nbsp; I guess I could have went somewhere but I really had no plans and no one to do anything with so I thought maybe some rest would do me good.&nbsp; My legs and arms are still killing me from Friday night.&nbsp; What the HELL did I do?   So I was trying to sleep.&nbsp; But I just wasn't tired and so at three in the morning I decided I needed to go out and have a cigarette.&nbsp; I pulled a chair up to the kitchen window and leaned far out.&nbsp; The sky was very overcast and heavy with fog that hadn't dropped low enough to really be fog.&nbsp; The cities lights reflected off of it this orangy yellow glow.&nbsp; Everything was bright.&nbsp; It was like having a dim light on everywhere.&nbsp; I listened to the sounds of the city, the cars driving and the honking and I thought of how quiet it was.&nbsp; But this was my kind of quiet.&nbsp; City quiet.&nbsp; I have a harder time sleeping in places that are really quiet.&nbsp; I need the lull of noise to rock me to sleep.&nbsp; The sounds of sirens in the distance, of loud cars driving by shaking the windows, of honking and of people being too loud too late at night.&nbsp; I listened and I thought to myself that this moment was now gone forever.&nbsp; A moment I would never relive.&nbsp; I inhaled deeply and watched as the smoke unfurled around my fingers and how it billowed out into the night sky as I exhaled.&nbsp; I looked down and saw the kiddie pool and the huge balcony my neighbors below me were lucky enough to have.&nbsp; I just had this window that I strattled and my tiny view of the downtown skyline.&nbsp; So many wires in the way.&nbsp; And before you could see the skyline you had to see the backs of all the houses.&nbsp; Chaos and beauty.&nbsp;   There were no stars.&nbsp; Rarely can you see stars here.&nbsp; I'm used to never really looking up anymore.&nbsp; What would be the point.&nbsp; I finished my cigarette and lit another.&nbsp; I thought about who I was and why I am the way I am.&nbsp; I wondered if I was trying too hard, or not hard enough and then I thought why in the hell do I even have to try in the first place, why can't I just be?&nbsp;Be enough for you and you and you?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there something I'm not&nbsp;doing or is it something that I am doing that keeps people&nbsp;away.&nbsp; Am I that closed off, cold, ugly, wierd, mean?&nbsp; I&nbsp;honestly don't know what it is.&nbsp; I pondered over&nbsp;similar thoughts for a while and then I thought it was&nbsp;a pretty warm night.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a balcony.&nbsp; I'd sleep&nbsp;out there.&nbsp; My downstairs neighbors have a hamock&nbsp;set up.&nbsp; I wanted to&nbsp;scale down the building and lay in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then a light&nbsp;went on in the bathroom of&nbsp;the ground floor in the building next to mine.&nbsp; I know it's a bathroom because I watch that window often.&nbsp; Boys live there.&nbsp; A boy that wears tighty whities.&nbsp; I watched him wash his hands and stare in the mirror for a while and then he turned the light off and went away.&nbsp; I am a voyeur.&nbsp; I am also an exhibitionist, but not to the extremes.&nbsp; I flirt with the idea of it.&nbsp; I think I'm more of a voyeur though. I love to watch people when they don't know I'm watching, to see real life uninhibited.&nbsp;   I finished the cigarette and decided I had exhausted myself with thought.&nbsp; I went back to my room and crawled under the covers.

      I looked forward to going out all day.&nbsp; I keep telling myself that I have to go out no matter how tired I might be.&nbsp; If I'm going to have any sort of happiness while working these two horrid jobs than I have to keep going out.&nbsp; At least once.&nbsp; And so I go out.&nbsp; Usually I'm tired and just kind of stand around sipping on a beer, dancing a little watching life unfurl before me as I stand there in my own little world just watching everyone interact or the bands playing or the video loop playing on repeat.&nbsp; Watching people live life and being completely devoid of it myself.&nbsp;   But this time I started with my nails.&nbsp; I painted them a dark blood red.&nbsp; I had sushi for dinner (and let me just tell you, sushi is not the food to eat before getting trashed), I came home and tried on a few different outfits.&nbsp; I got talked into wearing a bandaid, er I mean my tiny black mini skirt.&nbsp; It's definitely hot.&nbsp; I wore it with a deep v-necked black tank top and this&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;red belt, it's asymetrical and big and broke up my all-black wardrobe with some color.&nbsp; To keep from freezing I threw on a tiny black blazer with some bling, a diamond encrusted monogramed A on the lapel.&nbsp; I thought I looked pulled together enough and threw on some black fishnets and stilleto's.&nbsp;   I have a problem with being tall.&nbsp; Yes I do.&nbsp; And showing so much leg almost made me feel too self conscience, especially with the three inch stilleto's on but Parker asured me that you can never show too much leg or be too tall.&nbsp; I didn't really believe her but with enough drinks I could have cared less.&nbsp; My hair was pissing me off though.&nbsp; It wouldn't do what I wanted it to do and I didn't have hours to stand there staring at it in the mirror trying to make it look good so I left it looking like I had just stepped out of the 40's.&nbsp; Smooth, curled up at the ends with a little pompador-like flip of my bangs&nbsp;in front. Dark smoldering eyes, and shiny bright red-red-red lips.   As soon as I walked in I headed to the bar.&nbsp; downed a few drinks then decided I needed to dance.&nbsp; The place was pretty empty&nbsp;but it was only midnight, it filled up pretty fast after we got there though.&nbsp; Leslie came with me which made me happy because I haven't gone out dancing with her in a long time.&nbsp; I wish she wasn't so broken hearted over that loser she broke up with, but hey I guess these things happen.&nbsp; She put up a good front though and I think she had a little bit of fun.&nbsp; She had never been to ID.&nbsp; She knew more people there than I ever expected, apparently everyone either works with her or shops from her store there and had to say hi.&nbsp; We danced, we smoked, we drank, we danced some more, more, more.&nbsp; I was getting drunk.&nbsp; I was dancing my ass off, I was having fun.&nbsp; Mike said I smelled good.&nbsp; Little compliments mean so much to me these days.&nbsp; I told him he owed me a dance and then went out to have a cigarette.&nbsp;   I always meet the gay guys.&nbsp; Yep, they're attracted to me.&nbsp; Thankfully this time though it was Leslie this one guy was after, but then his friend the more flaming of the group saw me and knew.&nbsp; He knew I was the girl he wanted to have.&nbsp; Not in the same way straight men want women of course but you know.&nbsp; Gay men LOVE ME!&nbsp; It's kind of neat.&nbsp; He told me we would have to go to this expensive restuarant, I forgot the name, and have champagne and "little snacks" whatever that meant.&nbsp; He told me I smelled good and even knew the name of my parfum, and the designer.&nbsp; See, gay men love me.   But it was time to go back inside.&nbsp; I really had to pee.&nbsp; I had tried earlier but the bathroom was too packed so Leslie and I go in and get in line.&nbsp; She makes it in, but I&nbsp;got accosted by 2 cute girls wanting to know if my name was Amber.&nbsp; I probably looked freaked out but said, yes.&nbsp; And then they squealed with delight. I was clueless, then they told me they read this blog, and someone else's blog and blah blah blah and they thought it was me but wasn't sure and I was almost overwhelmed but in a good way, I probably would have been more embarassed if I was sober but I definitely was not sober at this time.&nbsp; Someone offered me some Sparks, I was just drinking anything that night and down a big gulp went.&nbsp; Then Natasha came in and gave me a big hug.&nbsp; I've never met her before&nbsp;but she's so silly and sweet in her journal that it was just nice to finally meet her.&nbsp; It was a crazy bathroom moment though, and I never did get to go pee.&nbsp; I made my way back to the bar instead.&nbsp;   I ended up sitting on the stage up in front where I was previously dancing, trying to sip on my drink but before I had knew it the glass was empty.&nbsp; It was time to dance.&nbsp;I danced a lot.&nbsp; And then I got my dance with Mike, but I was so drunk at this point I probably was dancing like shit.&nbsp; He kept spinning me around.&nbsp; I thought I was going to fall over, but falling feels good when you are drunk.&nbsp; Not the landing part, but the falling part.&nbsp; I never fell, but I got dipped and I laughed and laughed and danced.&nbsp; And then came the rap/ghetto/r&b. It's usually played at the very end of the night, it's like a way to know when last call is.&nbsp; Leslie went and got a beer, which I kept stealing sips of.&nbsp; We danced.&nbsp; Well I danced all ghetto like.&nbsp; I blame the gay bars my friend Kevin takes me too.&nbsp; DAMN THOSE GAY BARS!&nbsp; Teaching me how to dance all dirty-like.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp; I love dancing and I finally got to dance.&nbsp; I'm afraid I'm going to end up in way too many pictures where I look like a mess.&nbsp; I know I crinkled up my face for one picture and that is bad.&nbsp;   We all spilled out onto the sidewalk outside.&nbsp; Leslie ran into some girl she knew when she was just a tiny little kid.&nbsp; I had a bonding experience with Fletcher over 6am Bart rides to work, everyone was going to the afterparty.&nbsp; I was being talked into it, and then I realized I was way too trashed.&nbsp; I needed food. I needed my bed.&nbsp; I sent Leslie off and told her to have fun.&nbsp; Then I went over to Parker and she tried to get me to go too.&nbsp; She told me I could do it, that I just had to keep conversations short with people and superficial and that I could do it, that I wouldn't fall asleep and I'd get through my drunken stupor.&nbsp; I almost gave in, and then what to my wonderous eyes did I see?&nbsp; An empty cab.&nbsp; No one was taking it, and in a cinderella like moment as the clock struck midnight (2:fourtysomething actually)&nbsp;I fled to the cab waving and yelling,&nbsp; "I just can't do it.&nbsp; goodnight! I need a brownie!!!!!"&nbsp;   I was safe in the cab and calmly collected myself to appear some what proper and in a quiet voice asked to be dropped off at the corner of 15th and South Van Ness.&nbsp; He was quite possibly the nicest cab driver I have ever had.&nbsp; Normal.&nbsp; Courteous.&nbsp; Asked how my night was and which corner I'd prefer to be let off at.&nbsp; I tipped him well and slid my way up the stairs.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I knew it was going to be an ugly day today.  I set my alarm for 7:30 this morning instead of 7.&nbsp; I almost didn't notice the alarm blaring at me either, because I was dreaming and incorporated the sound into my dream.&nbsp; I do this a lot, and it's scary.&nbsp; Sometimes I do it when people are talking to me and I'm asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding conversations with people while I'm sleeping&nbsp;is wierd.&nbsp; I found out once that&nbsp;I talked for twenty minutes on the phone with my at the time boyfriend all while I was asleep.&nbsp; I couldn't remember anything I said and it made me paranoid. &nbsp;I talk in my sleep.&nbsp; I used to walk in my sleep too, but luckily that stopped.&nbsp; I woke up a few times outside curled up next to trees or laying out in the backyard of my parents house cold and wet.&nbsp; My parents were forced to get a dead bolt lock that locked with a key from the inside.&nbsp; Fire hazard but at least I wouldn't be roaming the streets in my sleep at night.&nbsp; Who knows where I went or what I did?&nbsp; The worst part is just not knowing.&nbsp; Having people tell you you said  this  or did  that  and not being able to recall or control it was definitely creepy.&nbsp; So this morning I dreamed of my alarm clock going off, but I thought it was JUST in my dream.&nbsp; Luckily it sent me into a panic and I woke up to find it was my real alarm, but because I was so violently awoken from my r.e.m. sleep I wasn't able to just be awake.&nbsp; I had to give myself ten more minutes.&nbsp; I knew I was going to be late for work and honestly didn't care.&nbsp; It's friday.&nbsp; My boss is out of the office for the day and the fact that they never care anyhow didn't hurt either.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I took my time getting ready.&nbsp; I wanted to wear these red tights I have but decided against it since it's February and all.&nbsp; I threw on some jeans and a sweater and sauntered out to the bus stop.&nbsp; The forty minute ride seemed longer than ever.&nbsp; I read a few chapters of the book I am currently reading,  A Tree Grows In Brooklyn  by Betty Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally near the end of the line was my stop.&nbsp; I looked out the window and saw how dark it was.&nbsp; It's always dark, but there was something heavy to the way it looked today, something thick and tired about it.&nbsp; I stepped off the bus and crossed over Van Ness Avenue and started walking down Union Street.&nbsp; I never wait for the connecting bus, because it takes the same amount of time for me to get to work walking as it would to wait for the bus and then ride the six or seven blocks.&nbsp;   As I started down the hill I felt the heavy drops of dew and fog sting against my cheeks and lips, and cling to my eyelashes.&nbsp; The moisture clinging to my eyelashes made everything sparkly looking, but that soon faded after too much moisture caused my vision to be completely blurred.&nbsp; I was walking down Union Street, practically blind.&nbsp; I thought this is what it must be like for glaucoma patients.&nbsp; By now the droplets were streaming down my face.&nbsp; It felt like I was crying only I wasn't.&nbsp; I could only imagine what I looked like to others on the street.&nbsp; I didn't dare wipe my face though.&nbsp; Besides the fact that my hand too was soaked and would just be wiping away water with water I knew that I would end up looking like some homeless smeary eyed girl.&nbsp; I decided I would wait until I got to work and blot myself off in the bathroom.&nbsp; I still look a little smeary eyed, but not too bad.&nbsp; My poor book as ragged as it already was can now add water damage to dog eared, thin paged and falling apart as part of it's lovely discription.  &nbsp; My thoughts lately are have been of sweet Ben.&nbsp; Benson.&nbsp; You came over in the middle of the night for the free alcohol I was having and willing to share with anyone who would come over and keep me company.&nbsp; We talked and watched the news together over vodka shots.&nbsp; It was the day after Interpol played the Filmore, and I still had a hang over... so I had to nurse it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You only stayed twenty minutes because you had to get to work, at&nbsp;the KUSF radio station.&nbsp; I listened to your&nbsp;show that night and&nbsp;laughed out loud whenever you were on the air.&nbsp; We kept in contact&nbsp;and in a few months you moved in.&nbsp; You were everything I was not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cute, smart,&nbsp;philosphical, edgy, spontaneous but we had so much in common.&nbsp; You even tried on and showed me how cute you'd look in little white frilly girly panties for me.&nbsp; If that isn't true friendship I don't know what is.&nbsp; We shared royal gate together, and got nachos together way too often.&nbsp; You were nice enough to put our names on the guest list for the sold out Elefant show at Bottom of the Hill, quite possibly one of the smallest venues I've ever been in.&nbsp; He finally dropped out of school and quit working at the radio station.&nbsp;&nbsp; After he told his parents, he made the decision to sell or give away all of his stuff, pack one bag filled with clothes and a few books and with no money he moved out to Brooklyn.&nbsp; His friend bought him the one way ticket.&nbsp; I slipped a note under his door the morning he was to leave.&nbsp; It was a sad goodbye letter.&nbsp; I think I cried the whole time I wrote it.&nbsp; I never get sad at goodbye's.&nbsp; I usually don't cry, but then again I'm usually the one leaving.&nbsp; It hurts a little more when people leave you I guess.&nbsp;   Anyhow, I've been thinking about Ben a lot lately.&nbsp; I tried to get in contact with him when I was in New York in May.&nbsp; Didn't end up happening though.&nbsp; I guess I can't just pop up in New York and expect him to be home or have time for me anymore.&nbsp; I hoped on the J or maybe I took the L?&nbsp; I don't remember and headed out towards his home.&nbsp; Thunder storms ensued, and the rain started to really come down.&nbsp; I decided I wasn't going to wander around Brooklyn all wet until he answered his phone or called me back so I got back on a returning train to manhattan.&nbsp; Quite possibly the only time Ben has ever disapointed me.&nbsp; How fun would it have been to go running through the streets in the rain?&nbsp; Rain never bothered me...  This time I gave him 2 months warning.&nbsp; I miss my Ben!

      I woke up thinking it was the middle of July, but when I left the house I realized it was February.&nbsp;   Strange things the weather here does to me.&nbsp;   Dark, cold, windy and misty.&nbsp; Grey and ugly.&nbsp; It makes me feel all somber like.&nbsp; Quiet.&nbsp; Sad.&nbsp; Grey days make me think too much.&nbsp; I caught myself staring out the window of my office out past the golden gate bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out into the nothing.&nbsp; Josh walked in and asked if something was wrong.&nbsp; I mumbled no and headed back over towards my desk.&nbsp;   My hands are numb and small looking.&nbsp; The nails short and ugly.&nbsp; They need painted.&nbsp; They need cleaned up.&nbsp; My hands tend to reflect who I am an any given moment.   When I get&nbsp;off work&nbsp;I'm going to go sell my soul to the devil with Jessica, that is if there is anything left of it to sell.&nbsp; And then I'm coming home and taking my soma holiday as promised...

      I love how some people think they know everything.   &nbsp;  It makes me smile inside to know that not only are they wrong but that they look quite stupid by being so cocky and sure of something that really isn't.   -------------   Jessica had dinner ready for me when I walked in the door.&nbsp; I love that girl.&nbsp; We sat around talking over plans for the future.&nbsp; We talked about moving.&nbsp; She really wants to move to Phillidelphia.&nbsp; She loves it, but she doesn't want to move until she's lived here for two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm ready to get out of here right now, today, but I know it's not going to happen.&nbsp; I need to finish doing what I need to do here first.&nbsp; I need to have that X amount of money in the bank.&nbsp; I'm not carefree like some people.&nbsp; I don't always come out 'okay' in the end.&nbsp; I am fiercly independant and wouldn't feel comfortable relying on other people to help me out.&nbsp; So I need to make sure I'm at a spot where I can do whatever it is I want to do with out the help from ANYONE.&nbsp; It's the only way I operate these days...   So my thoughts and ideas are just that.&nbsp; Nothing is set in stone.&nbsp; Nothing is written down, there are no firm plans.&nbsp; Just my ideas and thoughts in my head and feelings in my heart.&nbsp; I want to live alone for a while.&nbsp; I've yet to do that.&nbsp; Maybe I won't be able too, but I'm hoping I can.&nbsp; Jessica is probably my best friend.&nbsp; She's someone I can be honest with and tell things too that I just wouldn't share with anyone and even when I know she won't like something or approve I know she won't judge me, and that is why I can discuss even stupid stuff like this over dinner and make plans with her.&nbsp; Of course then our talk turned to our moving out of this flat and into a new place in October.&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp;   Who knows where I'll be in six months...   -----------------   I'm so curious, so nosey, I want to know who you are, why you say such things to me as if you know what I'm thinking.&nbsp; Maybe I'll get an email, maybe I won't.&nbsp; I just hate not knowing.   -----------------   The new underwear line is out at my 2nd job.&nbsp;   urlLink http://bodywear.puma.com/   I like the pictures on the boxes.&nbsp;   I think I'm going to quit soon though.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I need to find a new job.&nbsp;   -----------------   I need to find someone to go&nbsp;see the Pixies with me in September.&nbsp; My roommate Leslie can't go.&nbsp; She'll be attending her cousins wedding down in LA on the day of the show so I have an extra ticket.&nbsp; It's a sold out show.&nbsp; Apparently people want to see them.&nbsp;   -----------------   My stomache is upset.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's from the food I just ate or from the thoughts in my head.&nbsp;   Tomorrow and Friday are half days.&nbsp; When I get home, I'm going to slip under the covers and not wake up until it's dark outside.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I'm feeling I'm getting to old to waste my time here in San Francisco. The city isn't really exciting enough for me right now, and before long I'm going to want to settle down and my youth will have been completely wasted.   I can see myself settling down here one day, but that day isn't right now.   I haven't really spoken these thoughts or feelings out loud before. A few people have talked about moving away and I've commented back on the subject but lately it's been all that is on my mind. Where to next, isn't so much the question but when and how?   Fleeting thoughts of a life less ordinary.  I will save up X amount of dollars and then I'm out of here.   &nbsp;

      I need to go see a dentist.&nbsp; But only so they can bitch me out about getting my wisdom teeth removed.&nbsp; I just need to get a referal to a good oral surgeon.&nbsp; I can't believe how grown up I'm being about all of this.&nbsp; Willingly offering myself into days of pain and suffering.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Why not though? &nbsp; My teeth have always been straight and appear to be great, however I've had more dental work already performed on my mouth than most people have in their entire lives!&nbsp; And it was all due to falling off my bike and cracking a tooth when I was 4.&nbsp; Straightness was never the problem, it's allignment.&nbsp; I had braces for three horrid years of my life, they were clear, but still.&nbsp; I've had a zillion x-rays taken and not the normal mouth kind, the kind you have to get strapped into a chair and have wierd things pushed into your ears and basically I looked like a lab monkey.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had oral surgery once before when I was 12, and as I recall it was the worst pain of my life.&nbsp; Even the&nbsp;Vicoden didn't work.&nbsp; Of course I didn't know you should wash it down with a few drinks back then either. >:)&nbsp; And all of that lead to the TMJ I have today. MY JAW GETS STUCK OPEN!&nbsp; Okay not very often but 4 times is MORE than enough.&nbsp; Three of those times I've had to go to the hospital to have it reset.&nbsp; Embarassing and painful.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So this is a big deal for me.&nbsp; I'm scared.&nbsp; I don't have anyone here that can really take time off to make sure I get too and from surgery okay.&nbsp; However, I just have to do it.&nbsp; My teeth are starting to hurt because it is pushing on them and shifting them out of place, and I'll be damned if I didn't suffer through years of braces and crap to have jacked up teeth.&nbsp; Not that I really care.&nbsp; Honestly my teeth still don't line up properly, but maybe that is something I can get fixed while I'm at it too.&nbsp; I think it's cute when people have slightly crooked teeth,&nbsp;but mine aren't getting crooked they are doing their own thing and it hurts :(&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I really, really don't want to go in and have people fucking up my mouth again...

      Why is it that people you don't even know and have probably never even met have to try their hardest to make you feel shitty?  &nbsp;  I know I'm a bitch.&nbsp; I know I do mean things.&nbsp; But I'm usually kind enough to do it to someone's face, or at least within ear shot so they have a chance to see who I am.&nbsp; At least I do it in person to people I have actually met.  &nbsp;  Maybe I am the only one that thinks that some people are actually interesting and worth getting to know and the people that aren't, I just don't bother with them.&nbsp; I wouldn't hang around someone I didn't like and the same goes for the internet.&nbsp; I wouldn't read someone's blog if all I had to say to or about them were negative things because I didn't like them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm not trying to say that a person can't disagree with something or share an opinion on a particular subject, but some things that people apparently think are okay to say to someone are not.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You mean, cold, heartless bitches you!  &nbsp;  ----------  &nbsp;  Today is going by slow.&nbsp; I can't wait for the day to be over.&nbsp; Or at least half over.&nbsp; I really just want a tall can, or maybe a forty for lunch.&nbsp; mmmm 40's.  &nbsp;  ----------  &nbsp;  Why do homeless people push around shopping carts full of junk?&nbsp; Seriously, if I was homeless I wouldn't be pushing around a bunch of shit like old books and broken lamps, some pictures, old stuffed animals&nbsp;and crap.&nbsp; How is that going to help you out in life?&nbsp; If I were homeless I'd have a pillow, a blanket, some change of clothes and a jacket maybe some spare shoes if I found some and whatever cooking supplies I could scrounge up.&nbsp; The homeless people living in the ally behind my house like to barbeque, so they have their little habachi grill and a few utensils.&nbsp; It's like camping for them, just EVERY DAY.&nbsp;&nbsp; So why all the junk?&nbsp; Anyone care to help me out here and let me know?  &nbsp;  -----------  &nbsp;  This Friday is ID.&nbsp; It's my new favorite club.&nbsp; Even if I do complain about scenesters&nbsp;a lot, I still love it.&nbsp; They play good music, and this friday is all dancing.&nbsp; NO bands.&nbsp; I need to dance.&nbsp; I wish more of my friends would come with me though.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel shy when I'm by myself.&nbsp; AND unloved.&nbsp; I want to get drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk.&nbsp; I don't have a problem though.&nbsp; I just haven't been drunk, in a month.&nbsp; Buzzed does not equal drunk and when I'm buzzed I still have a conscience and I'd like to get rid of mine for a night or so.&nbsp; It's starting to bug me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I'll at least have fun stumbling home drunk again.&nbsp; Maybe this time I won't be walking home alone.  &nbsp;

      I've always been the kid that no one realizes is even there.&nbsp; I've had this ability to disapear since I was a small child.&nbsp; I don't know quite how or when I developed it, but people always used to say things like "I didn't even realize you were there." or "you're so quiet, I almost forgot you were here."&nbsp; I had a loud, noisy, little brother that had ADD.&nbsp; He got in trouble so much, it seemed that not even one day could go buy with out him being the focus of some conversation or argument my parents had.&nbsp; His teachers would always call home.&nbsp; When he was in third grade he started staying out well past midnight and my parents would freak out.&nbsp; He'd come home around midnight or one in the morning and act like everything was fine, that he just lost track of time.&nbsp; At this point I went into hiding.&nbsp; I was in sixth grade&nbsp; I'd stay in my room for hours listening to my radio, tapes and records I owned, usually acting out on my own.&nbsp; I started stealing, shoplifting from the grocery store.&nbsp; I stole cigarettes and started smoking.&nbsp; They weren't locked up back then, and were right near the exit.&nbsp; I used to cut myself a lot. I liked to watch myself bleed.&nbsp; It wasn't really for the same reasons you usually read about.&nbsp; It wasn't taking away any pain, I wasn't really using it as a release for anything other than, it made me feel real.&nbsp; It made me feel like I existed.&nbsp; I never cut my arms or legs. I'd usually just cut my palms or the bottom of my feet.&nbsp; Places that scars don't really form because the skin renews faster there.&nbsp; I'd stick myself with needles or use an exacto knife.&nbsp; It would be tiny cuts but deep enough for drops and sometimes streams of dark red blood.&nbsp; I liked the way it looked running down my skin.&nbsp; I'd clean myself up, put on a bandaid and then go back to doing what all 11 year old girls do.&nbsp; Talk on the phone.&nbsp; Read my stupid girl books like "the babysitters club", Think about the boy I liked, which at the time was a boy named Andrew Jensen or Brendan Rector whom I used to spend every summer day with swimming in his pool.&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone about my crushes or my cutting.&nbsp; I guess sometimes secretely I wished I'd just bleed to death.&nbsp; Then I'd never have to hear my parents fight or worry about my brother and even worse I thought that if I did, they'd all really miss me.&nbsp; I used to wonder who'd come to my funeral, who would find me. Stuff like that.&nbsp; I've always been a "dark" kind of kid I guess.&nbsp; But I'd always think it would be the stupidest thing ever to do because then I'd be dead and it wouldn't really matter.&nbsp; I wasn't a complete idiot.&nbsp; I just never got the attention I wanted.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and it gets worse.  &nbsp;  A few years before all of that started I was eight years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had long brown hair down to my lower back, big brown eyes with enormously long black eye lashes.&nbsp; I was skinny and tan and used to run around in my bathing suit all summer long.&nbsp; I'd roller skate in my short jean mini-skirt that was  SO  popular then.&nbsp; It was the summer of 1987.&nbsp; My cousins boyfriend lived in the same neighborhood as I did.&nbsp; He was sixteen.&nbsp; He wasn't particularly cute or anything but he was a pervert.&nbsp; He used to chase us kids around and then one day I was walking down this path that all of us kids used to play on and he came up to me and said I had pretty eyes.&nbsp; I just kind of looked at him like he was stupid.&nbsp; I was eight.&nbsp; I just wanted to play with my toys, except I knew I wasn't going to be able too.&nbsp; I knew something wasn't right.&nbsp; The horrible part is that I knew and I didn't do anything.&nbsp; I was like a deer in headlights.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; Everything we had just been shown in school to run, to tell someone you trust if someone does something to you inappropriately seemed to not fit into this equation.&nbsp; I stood there just staring at him while he said that I was always making him hard by running around in my bathing suit.&nbsp; He said I was sexy and then proceeded to shove his tongue down my throat.&nbsp; I nearly gagged.&nbsp; I thought it was so gross, but I couldn't move.&nbsp; I just kept thinking, this is so gross I never want to kiss anyone like this EVER!&nbsp; And then he tried to grab me in other areas and I pushed him off of me and glared at him.&nbsp; Every day after that I'd purposely roller skate on by him in my bathing suit and smile at him with this look of hatred on my face.&nbsp; He kept his distance from then on.&nbsp; I hated him, and I also told myself I'd never let any stupid boy do anything to me that I didn't want.&nbsp; I never told anyone though.&nbsp; I'd just think about it at night.&nbsp; Then I'd think about this boy I used to like, that I'd play with at recess...  &nbsp;  Years went on.&nbsp; 7th and 8th grade rolled around.&nbsp; I stopped cutting, started smoking more, cutting class, failing classes, but I never got in trouble.&nbsp; Nothing I could do was wrong in my parents eyes.&nbsp; I was never  AS BAD  as my brother.&nbsp; I got away with murder.&nbsp; This worked to my advantage the older I got.&nbsp; High School was a blur.&nbsp; I was a late bloomer, small and too skinny, but mildly popular.&nbsp; Summer nights were the best though.&nbsp; One of my best friends Ericka and I would stay up late,&nbsp; wearing bikinis and short jean shorts riding our bikes downtown in the middle of the night.&nbsp; rolling joints, drinking whatever we could steal from our parents house, being dumb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I met Beth.&nbsp; I met her my junior year of high school and we became instant best friends.&nbsp; Beth and I were trouble from the begining.&nbsp; We did everything together and got into plenty of trouble for it too.&nbsp; She would always try to hang out at my house because I had the cool young parents that trusted me and let me go out whenever with out a curfew.&nbsp; Her mom was the exact opposite.&nbsp; I'd stay at her house and we'd have to sneak out.&nbsp; We'd call this guy George who was MUCH OLDER than us to come pick us up and take us out.&nbsp; We'd go out.&nbsp; We'd drink and use him for his money and his car and then we'd make him take us back home.&nbsp; He liked Beth a lot, and she knew this and we used him.&nbsp; It was mean, but there was no way in hell she was ever going to be attracted to him.&nbsp; Not like that.&nbsp; His family owned this little french pastry shop in our neighborhood.&nbsp; Beth and I started to become master theives.&nbsp; We'd blatently steal&nbsp;shit from stores left and right.&nbsp; The more obnoxious and obvious you were the more you could get away with.&nbsp; It was fun to test the limits of places.&nbsp; I got an entire new wardrobe in a month!&nbsp; STILL my parents never even asked where I got the clothes from, or where I was, or anything.&nbsp; We got arrested though after about sixth months of massive shoplifting sprees.&nbsp; We'd joke about it all the time.&nbsp; Thankfully we got caught with just one shirt between the two of us.&nbsp; If they ever caught us on a good day we'd probably be thrown in jail for grand theft!&nbsp; I remember sitting in my room with her adding up all the price tags and on more than one occasion I'd have over two thousand dollars worth of merchandise just sitting in a pile on my bedroom floor, and all that not including what she took.&nbsp; I was a bad kid.&nbsp; I just couldn't get in trouble though, and the rush was amazing. We got a job working at a water park for the summer that year.&nbsp; We got interviewed together and worked together and then one day she disapeared.&nbsp; I ran into her a few years later and she became my drug buddy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't become a junkie or anything but I started doing more drugs than just pot.&nbsp; I remember being extremely high one night and thinking outloud that it was poly-drug use.&nbsp; I was on MULTIPLE DRUGS. Saying it all slow like and laughing.&nbsp; God I had fun.&nbsp; It went on for years, and then she disapeared again.&nbsp; I think of her often. I hope she is okay.  &nbsp;  College I got more normal until I dropped out... and now I'm just somewhere floating in between being the saddest girl in the world who feels like she doesn't even really exist and feeling like the luckiest person because I didn't turn out all sorts of fucked up.&nbsp; I have my own problems and issues and each day is it's own day filled with highs and lows.&nbsp; Today wasn't a very high one though.&nbsp; I know I have attention problems.&nbsp; I crave it.&nbsp; Not all the time, but sometimes, a little and lately I don't have it and I want it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I also feel like there is nothing left here for me.&nbsp; I often ask myself what kind of changes I need to do or make to help me feel alive again, so I'm not just stumbling along from one day to the next but either the answers are alluding me or I just am refusing to see or acknowledge them.&nbsp; I'm wondering if I want to stay here, if I want to sign another year lease, if I want to find a shorter 6 month lease when I move.&nbsp; Do I want to stay in this city?&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorts of&nbsp;questions keep coming up and I wish I had the answers.&nbsp; I get scared though.&nbsp; I always feel that any ideas I have or things I say are permanent that I can't change my mind and take them back. Like that is what I will be held to forever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am so wierd :(  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Only I can find a way to become broke just 1 day after getting paid twice. I rule sometimes. But I have Beer, a new cell phone, clean laundry, some food and lots of new clothes and other goodies to tide me over until the next time I can splurge again. I feel good, even if I have only $2.00 to my name. Seriously.   I wasn't feeling very happy last night though.&nbsp; I came home and started getting ready to go to Jordan's party. I forgot that I told Kevin I'd meet him afterwork and he remembered&nbsp;but I had already bolted down the stairs to catch the bart train&nbsp;leaving him&nbsp;there waiting for me. Oh fuck! I am a horrible friend sometimes. He called me and left me this super guilt trip message&nbsp;making me feel like an asshole, but I deserved it. I called him back too late though because he was already on bart or the muni underground and wasn't getting service on his phone wherever he was.&nbsp; I apologized to his cell phone.&nbsp; Profusely.   I got home to find a small cluster of hipster dudes standing in my kitchen. OH Parker must be going out, I thought. She's so cute in her slutty, super hipster way and I do like her. She's sweet and nice and everything else, I just feel that had I not met her through the craigslist ad to find a roommate that I never would have even given her a second glance. I'm so full of reverse snobbery.. no I take that back. I'm a snob to everyone. It sounds bad. I hate this, I hate that, I hate you, I hate your fucking boots, blah blah blah.&nbsp; I hate your fake pretensious act, I mean if you're going to be pretensious just be it. But be it all the time and not just in front of the "cool kids" ya know.&nbsp; I do hate boots though.   I talk too much about this, but that is because there is always some stupid scenester boy with   THAT   haircut and a black blazer with a skinny tie on in my house. (I don't even mind the look, I just wish EVERYONE wouldn't look the same though.)&nbsp; And please don't be rude to me in my own home. I had to deal with that when Ben lived here and I won't fucking take that shit now. I'm over it. I won't try to make you feel welcome or comfortable if you have that kind of attitude with me! So last night no one was really rude, but the attitude that two of them were throwing almost made me laugh in their face. (And they weren't even good looking!) I guess I do that too. I've been told by a few of my friends that the first time they met me they thought I was the biggest bitch in the world. So maybe I am just seeing myself in others and hating it? I don't know. I try not to be so bitchy anymore.. hahaha no that is a lie. I used to think I was a nice sweet person, but who am I kidding?  Okay reading what I wrote just made me realize I'm the most jugemental fuck ever. OH man this just made my day. Gave me a special feeling right here in my heart.   I can't finish that thought.   So... I came home and talked some shit with Leslie and Jessica which led to me demonstrating some sexual technique for Leslie. She's having problems getting hers with her BF so I thought I'd give her some advice. It was hilarious. I wish we would have documented it with photos or a video. "so if you're on bottom you just kind of roll your hips under like this.. and keep doing it until..." All the way, demonstrating it for her on her rug. She was like.. "I can't do that!" So I made her try. It was cute. Jessica was just sitting there laughing her ass off. We were drinking beers. Finally I started to get dressed to go out. Jessica was already ready. All she did was throw on a super ghetto-fabulous black fuzzy coat and these white rimmed sunglasses and was set to go. I however just got off work and looked like puke. We got ready, I had more beer. It was about midnight when we left. Not too late. I grabbed another beer and we headed off to the bart station.   This fucker lives way the hell out in the Richmond district. Why anyone would want to live out there, I'm still not sure. After getting off bart at union square we had to catch a bus, the 38. Usually the 38 is a double sized bus so it's okay, but what pulls up is this rinky-dink super tiny short bus, and it's already full, and then some homeless man in a wheelchair decides that this is the bus he wants to ride. The bus fucking smells so bad, Jessica and I are being obnoxiously rude and opening all the windows and hiding our noses in our sleeves. I loathe the bus. We finally get to our stop around 12:50am. That is not late. We walk up to the door and contemplate whether this is a party or not. It sounds pretty quiet. I'm trying to call Anthony to see what's going on, but that fucker won't answer. So we knock. Turns out it got busted up already. Now see, this is why you shouldn't live out in the quiet, boring ass Richmond district. Parties are NEVER busted up in the Mission. So it was time to head home, as we had no alternate plans, and Anthony STILL wouldn't answer his phone.   Good thing I had a bright idea of packing beers in my purse just in case something wrong should happen. But first we hit up this bar across the street to go pee. We had already been drinking for a few hours now and it was definitely time to go. While we were peeing the bus came by and we missed it, as we saw it roll on by from the upstairs bathroom window. I called Kevin, to apologize to him again and to see what he was doing since he has a car.. no, no, no I knew he would already be out at some bar in the Castro which he was. But it was hard to hear him through all the background noise so I hung up. Finally I pulled out a beer, cracked it open and began to down the fucker right there at the bus stop. Everything was going kind of smoothly for about 5 minutes. We got back downtown and realized that bart wasn't running anymore and we'd have to take the dreaded smelly-ass 14 bus home. Too bad we sat there for an hour before a bus came!  The night busses are supposed to run every half hour fuckers!!!  By now we were tired, and hungry, and had to fucking pee again! We complained, whined and tried to hitch hike home, but to no avail. And as usual when the bus did come it nearly killed me to actually get on. Now if I had more than $2.00 to my name as previously stated my ass would have been in the back of a taxi and already home. But... no I'm sitting on a bus gagging, and trying NOT to breathe and about 10,000 other people are trying to get on. I'm starving. Jessica and I decided we'd make tacos when we got home, which we finally did around 2:45. They were good tacos. I was now too tired and grumpy to stay up and finish getting drunk. My buzz had long since left me. I didn't have enough beers packed for the trip to sustain it. Three hours wasted. Three prime drinking hours gone along with my spirits and my energy and everything.   You know this morning is the most dancing I've done in forever.&nbsp; ALONE IN MY ROOM! Won't someone take me out to have a good time? To dance and drink with me? To take me home when I can't walk all that well? FUCKERS.

      So I'm going to be at ID at the end of the month and this band called The Paradise Boys will be be playing there.&nbsp; I figured since I had nothing better to do I'd look them up and give them a listen.&nbsp; Well much to my surprise turns out one of the band members stayed the night in MY house.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Parker did him, but I wasn't there so I don't know for sure.&nbsp; It was a coke filled night.&nbsp; This is the boy I had a disagreement with in MY kitchen the morning AFTER!   (Addendum:  Yes she did him.  While he was making out with ANOTHER BOY! who was having sex with another girl. OMG!  TOO MUCH INFORMATION.  I love my slutty friends!) &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   urlLink I Burn For You  is the only song they have up on their site that is in full.&nbsp; It doesn't suck.&nbsp; It's dancy.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll have fun.&nbsp; I think I might go dressed as a pirate.&nbsp; Just because I can.  &nbsp;  There is a pirate store by my house that sells pirate stuff.&nbsp;

      I felt like being a saint.  I felt like being a savior.  &nbsp;  I went shopping and I bought lots of non-parishables.&nbsp; Did you know most non-parishables are carbs?&nbsp; Not that I care.&nbsp; I just&nbsp;noticed.&nbsp; However I packed a big bag of beef jerky in there too.&nbsp; It's almost 100% protein if you just ignore the high sodium levels but mmmm I  &nbsp;  ---------------new thought----------------  &nbsp;  I got off work all early like today.&nbsp; At noon.&nbsp; A whole hour earlier than usual.&nbsp; I should have been off at eleven but decided to stick around for another hour just to validate coming in at all.&nbsp; 9am-11am just seems like a waste of getting up early and ready for work but three hours seems worth it.&nbsp; After I got off work I headed downtown for what was to be another shopping spree.&nbsp;  urlLink Nordstroms  was having their anniversary sale so I had to go.&nbsp; I got a cute pair of pink pants.&nbsp; I'm not a big fan of color.&nbsp; I like black, and I like navy and I like jeans and I like scarlet red.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; But these pants are too die for, are cute and look good with all my black tops and sweaters and stilletos so I got them.&nbsp; I also walked away with a black sweater hoodie.&nbsp; It's more appropriate for life at the office and for dressing up a swank pair of pink pants or throwing on with a skirt.&nbsp; The last thing I got there was a black pin-striped shirt.&nbsp; The collar and cuffs have a super hot pink inside lining giving it just a tiny kick in the ass!&nbsp; Still work appropriate but slightly devious all at the same time.&nbsp; After wandering around Nordstroms trying on everything for hours I decided I wanted to buy a new cell phone.&nbsp; And so I did.&nbsp; I love it, it's dark dark kind of sparkly navy in the sun but looks black.&nbsp; I guess I'm a closet goth kid.&nbsp; I just like black.&nbsp; it looks good on me.&nbsp; Plus so much cute stuff comes in black.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I then headed over to the Gap to visit my gay boyfriend Kevin.&nbsp; I can't believe he works at the fucking Gap!&nbsp; eh oh well.&nbsp; He needed a job.&nbsp; Stupid fucker quit the cushy job he had with me and made my life hell, maybe he deserves this.&nbsp; He totally broke my heart by quitting on me.&nbsp; He wouldn't let me quit, giving me a guilt trip about how we have to leave together and shit, but the second he gets pissed off he goes and runs out on me.&nbsp; He's still one of my best friends.&nbsp; I don't even mind that he falls asleep in random places with me and snores.&nbsp; Like at that stupid BFD festival concert.&nbsp; He just fell asleep on the lawn next to me leaving me sitting there alone and awake.&nbsp; I've had about 6 people on my bed watching tv in my room and he'll be the only one that falls asleep, and starts to snore. :) I think snoring is kind of cute actually.&nbsp; I like sleeping next to boys that snore.&nbsp; Am I wierd?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he's my platonic love since he doesn't like vagina.&nbsp;  He's currently fucking my boss for my full time job.&nbsp; Those two apparently go at it like rabbits and dirty whores.&nbsp; Oh the stories I have heard.&nbsp; Oh the stories I want to let my boss know that I know.&nbsp; I know he knows I know.&nbsp; He knows Kevin and I are best friends.&nbsp; He knows.&nbsp; It's so awesome.  &nbsp;  too much sex.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh but none for me.&nbsp; I got a request not to turn into a slut like my room mate Parker, who yes has been slutting it up lately.&nbsp; She admitts it though.&nbsp; Jessica and&nbsp;I were teasing her today that we could hear her getting it on last night.&nbsp; That's why I like my room, no one shares a wall with me.&nbsp; I can be&nbsp;as loud as I want too, if I wanted to be.&nbsp; BUT back to my point,&nbsp;I couldn't be a slut.&nbsp; I'm just not that kind of girl.&nbsp; I'm not delusional, and I don't think that sex = love or that it should be with someone "special" all&nbsp;the time.&nbsp; The occasional good fuck is awesome, whether it's with someone you love, like, or barely know.&nbsp; I'm just not into sharing with everyone.&nbsp; I have a small list, a very small list of people I would do.&nbsp; I have enough notches on my belt.&nbsp; I'm at an even number and I don't have room on my hands to count them anymore.&nbsp; I was a virgin until I was twenty, but I was a really late bloomer.&nbsp; In fact I didn't stop growing until&nbsp;I was 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost my virginity to one of my friends that was from NYC, Queens... Bayside to be exact that moved out here (to San Francisco) for the summer.&nbsp; He lived on Sutter Street and I came to hang out.&nbsp; He made me dinner, we talked about books and geeky stuff and then we did it, and then we took a shower together and I did other stuff. I got a lot of stuff out of the way in one night.&nbsp; Then we slept.&nbsp; I woke up and left early in the morning.&nbsp; He was my friend and I didn't want to ruin anything.&nbsp; We were still friends up until two years ago when he disappeared off the face of the earth.&nbsp; I had gone back to NYC to visit him a few times and he came out here.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a nice friendship while it lasted.&nbsp; Last year I went to a party that just happened to be at that very same house on Sutter street.&nbsp; Different people lived there.&nbsp; The room I had lost my virginity in was packed with people dancing and drinking.&nbsp; The bathroom where I did naughty things in had the longest line ever, I know because I waited in it.&nbsp; It was so wierd to be back in that house.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also the night I found out that Leslie and I had slept with WAY too many of the same people.&nbsp; We laughed about it.&nbsp; We made a list.&nbsp; We weren't good friends at the time, just acquaintences so it was okay.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So yeah I'm not a slut.&nbsp; I won't ever be a slut.&nbsp; Only one person thought I was a slut, and that was my friend Mark, but once I explained what really happened he went back to his original thinkings that I wasn't a slut and that some of the boys I did just liked to talk about how I gave awesome head, and wouldn't let it go... even if SEVERAL months had past!&nbsp; I've had a few slutty moments but they were few and far between.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  -----------------new thought--------------------  So tonight was beer night for Jessica and I.&nbsp; I had a few at home, and then we headed off to my favorite bar the Zeitgeist.&nbsp; It's not much.&nbsp; just a simple bar with a pool table and a juke box filled with lots of random music on the inside and a TON of picnic tables out in their back patio area.&nbsp; It was packed.&nbsp; We played two rounds of Rummy.&nbsp; I like to drink beer and play cards.&nbsp; It's so awesome.&nbsp; But then I was starting to feel tired and hungry and Jessica was meeting up with one of her quasi-boyfriends and I just felt it was time for me to head home.&nbsp; So I started walking home alone.&nbsp; I had a good buzz.&nbsp; I couldn't get this monologue in my head to stop so I carried on this conversation with myself about stupid stuff like doing laundry in the morning and then changed my mind and decided I'd do it Sunday morning.&nbsp; Then I thought about how I often am just walking home in the middle of the night all alone.&nbsp; But San Francisco is so safe.&nbsp; Well it seems that way to me anyhow.&nbsp; I take for granted that bad stuff could happen.&nbsp; I don't care.&nbsp; I then saw this boy and this girl having fun riding on a single skateboard together and secretly wishing that they'd fall, but they didn't.&nbsp; I was almost home and I passed the empty can of beer I had set down on the corner on the way to the bar.&nbsp; I like to drink on the street.&nbsp; I usually leave my house with a can or a 40oz. of beer in my hand whenever I go out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm still buzzed.&nbsp; Maybe earlier I was a tad drunk?&nbsp; I can't tell anymore.&nbsp; It all feels the same with beer.&nbsp; Hard liquor I definitely know when I've reached my limit, but beer sometimes tricks me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel tired and sloppy and awake all at the same time and I'm eating these potato chips like nobody's business.&nbsp; Shocker!&nbsp; I have to pee.&nbsp; Beer makes me have to pee more than any other drink in the world besides Tang.&nbsp; I don't know what it is in these two drinks but my bladder just can't take it.&nbsp; I can go almost all day with out having to go, but when I drink... it's over.&nbsp; Especially after you break the seal, then it's really over.&nbsp; Bathroom line here I come, again and again and again!  &nbsp;  So I'm sitting at home all alone and still buzzed.&nbsp; I think I'll put on some pajamas, watch a movie, maybe kill some kittens and then drift off to sleep.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I glanced out my window to see what the weather was like, and if I'd need a jacket.&nbsp; It looked all sunny and bright with just a slight breeze, then I did a double take and saw the great impending doom lurking over twin peaks stretching out and over downtown and the Marina and all the rest of San Francisco.&nbsp; We're talking thick, dark, nasty fog! Living in the Mission is a lie.&nbsp; It's warmer, sunnier, a bit smellier, and dare I say more 'hip'&nbsp;than the majority of San Francisco.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew&nbsp;I better grab my hoodie, and thankfully I did, because it is so cold and dark and grey here it's killing me.    I recall the happy years  we had underthe sun.  But in the darkness where I am,  all the happiness is gone.   &nbsp;  anyway, I'm trying to have some fun today.&nbsp; I only have one more hour here and then I'm free!  &nbsp;  But I look like crap!&nbsp; I don't care what the junkie waiting in line at the Methadone clinic said. (He yelled out "you're soooo beautiful" in an almost scary way.) To make matters worse I spilled my bosses old nasty coffee down the front of me.&nbsp; At least it's jeans day and I'm wearing a black shirt so you can't see it.&nbsp; But still.&nbsp; I smell like old coffee now.&nbsp; EW.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Just a little bit. On the inside.    I've lost five pounds in two days.  Not sure why or how as I am eating the crappiest junkies food ever.  I've always had a really good metabolism, but this is insane.  I'm thinking this two job thing is going to kill me or put me in the hospital.  I never feel good anymore, always so tired, even after eight hours of sleep.  I think it's because I haven't had a day off in over a month.     I had a Jell-O pudding pop for breakfast.  I didn't think they still made them but when I opened my freezer this morning it was looking at me and whispering softly,  "Devour me" .  And that was that.  The girls went out for drinks at the Zeitgeist and I'm sitting here kind of jealous and angry that I'm not there getting drunk too, but I just can't move. I'm so tired. Saturday is a party at Jordan's house that I'm supposed to go to.  I promised Anthony I would.  I just hope I don't feel as shitty as I do today or else I'm going to have to flake...  and if I flake I'll never hear the end of it at work because everyone is going.    meh.

      My room mate Parker and I at ID.  White Bitches!  Okay I know I'm pasty but I look dead in this photo, plus it looks like I am either fat or have a fat head.  damn my cheeky bones. And the hair EWWWW I knew it would be gross.  Soon it will be long and pretty and I won't have to worry about it looking so shitty.     Today is better.  I was the only one in the office for the first twenty minutes of the day.  I stared out the window at the views of the golden gate bridge, Saucalito, Alcatraz and Angel Island.  I stared at the ships sailing by.  I thought about everything and nothing in particular.  Sometimes I'm too much like a movie script.

      This morning has been a complete disaster.  I wake up with enough time to get ready, but I'm feeling slow and tired. I guess I took too long but manage to get out the door on time only to get half way down the street and realize I forgot my keys and bus pass.  I was already pissed off that I didn't have a jacket that matched what I was wearing and further pissed off that I had/have to have a jacket in the middle of summer in the first place.  Then pissed off that I was going to be late for work because I was dumb!    It started to creep up on me.  I was getting too angry at nothing.  I missed the bus I needed to catch to be on time for work.  I was tempted to jump in line at the methadone clinic but kept on walking to the bus stop.  No busses were in sight so I lit a cigarette.  I usually don't smoke in the morning.  I've never really got into smoking in the morning but I fucking needed one.  At that moment of course the bus comes.  Before I lit it I looked all down the street and didn't see a bus in site.  Lit it, and it's one block away.  At this point I realize I'm having an anxiety attack. The bus pulls up and is packed.  I'm not sure I can do it, but I know if I don't I'll hate myself even more.  I climb on and work my way towards the back and I can feel with each step it's getting worse.  I feel sick, dizzy, short of breath.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I wanted to sit down, but there were no seats.  I realized I had started to hold my breath so I tried to relax some.  This went on until I got to work.  I'm still feeling crazy.  I never should have stopped taking my Lexapro.  It made most of the anxiety I feel go away.  It has side effects though like a super increased libido, we're talking out of control sex fiend.  And it made my stomache feel upset.  But maybe I should start taking them again.  I just don't want to be dependant on some stupid happy pill to make me feel normal.

      I laid in bed next to Jessica tonight.  She was feeling shitty because her quasi-boyfriend Marcell didn't come over and do her today.  I just looked at her and said shut-up.  It's been two weeks.  two weeks.  She looked over at me and said well at least you can't say it's been 3 years 3 months and 4 days anymore.  And we both busted up laughing.  I love her so much.    Work is killing me.  I can't believe I thought I'd be able to hold out as long as I've committed too.  We'll see how long I can keep it up with out totally losing it.  I thought I felt my mind snap in two the other day.  My eyes started to burn.  I thought I was going to cry but the tears wouldn't come. I got a migrain instead.    My new favorite song is  Take You On A Cruise .  Makes me wish I had someone to hold hands with.

      Oh yeah, 45 minutes and I'm ready to head out the door.       I went to I.D. I didn't dance much like I wanted too, but that's because they had 2 bands playing and I felt wierd later on.  Like I had either one too many drinks or not enough.  I opted for the redstripe over the stella only because I could get redstripe in a bottle and not have to worry about people bumping into me and making me spill.  I hate when that happens.  I'd much rather drink stella.  Anyhow, it was fun. Mike told me he read this journal because of the link from the pictures.  I was a bit shocked, a bit embarassed but not too much, just a bit. A little bit.  He took a picture of Parker and I outside at the end of the night.  I'm sure my hair was all sorts of gross looking because I didn't put anything in it to keep it from getting all nasty like.  If it's cute I'll post it.  If it's not, maybe I'll post it with the help of some photoshop-like magic over my hair.  I'm hating on the hair anyhow because it's in a horrible grow out stage as it is, but sf moisture can be the death of even the most promising of good hair nights.  I did the stupidest thing though.  I opted out of taking a cab home and instead decided to walk.  I'm in a little black dress, fish nets and stilleto's but ya know, I want to walk home.  I had $6  I could have taken a cab, I just felt like walking though.  Sometimes I feel like doing the dumbest things.  Alone, walking down Franklin to Market to South Van Ness. I live really close the Rickshaw Stop so it's not a matter of distance.  After I set off though I realized I was a dumb girl and called Jessica and talked to her until I was a block away from home.    I was a bit drunk, but not fall down or giggly drunk just numb feeling drunk, the kind of drunk that makes me spacey.  I didn't talk too much I just sort of observed. I had been drinking since 6:30.  I met up with my friend Hunter at the Zeitgeist for beers and stuff and was quite buzzed when I left.  Then I come home to find my room mate Parker has bought a gallon sized bottle of some sort of citrus vodka and we proceeded to make vodka spritzers. So here I go.. drinking some more.  And then the redstripe later on. And then I was holding Parkers drink and of course when I hold alcohol I drink alcohol so I'm sipping and am telling myself NO MORE.  Finally I just have to hand it back to her and tell her not to let me even look at it.   No wonder I didn't feel so well.  I hate when mix hard liquor with beer.    Today was hell.  I hate working on the weekends.  It all needs to end soon.  I've been listening to the new Interpol Album and it is so awesome.  It took me a few listens all the way through before I could really appreciate it.  It's different from TOTBL.  More focus on rhythm and less on guitars it seems.  Or at least I notice the rhythm section more on this album.  I don't think it's better than TOTBL though, but it's damned good. I think TOTBL just came into my life at a moment when it all made sense though.  Plus I saw them play the album live over 10 times in one year.  Maybe after I see them play this album live (on tour) I'll appreciate it even more.  They are amazing live.  I've seen them play more in NYC & Boston than I have in California. Oh the stories I could tell of afterparties... but I'll save those for another time, another place.

      I love Bauhaus. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I've decided that is all I will listen to this weekend.     Don't you get the feeling you're being watched?  I went and looked at a beautiful three bedroom apartment today in Russian Hill.  HUGE beautiful kitchen with a dish washer.  Washer/Dryer in the apartment.  Windows in EVERY ROOM! Tons of Closets.  Beautiful living room with huge circular bay window, a parking spot included and a security door. And ahem... RENT CONTROLLED!!! only $1740.  I couldn't believe it.  Of course those two little words had people Flocking out.  Over 50 people showed up to look at the place just today alone.  I wasn't looking for me however but for my friend Kevin.    I still can't believe a) the price for the neighborhood usually a one bedroom will go for that much and b) that it was rent controlled. I was shocked.  The carpets would have to be cleaned but who cares, it was gorgeous.  But who am I kidding anyhow.  I'm so not a Russian Hill type of girl.  I'm more of the mission/hayes valley type.  I'm not nearly classy enough to be Russian Hill.  That's too near the Marina for me. Although I did get called a "fucking marina bitch" today.  Just because I work in the Marina neighborhood doesn't mean I'm from the Marina thank you very much!  Union street where all the trophy wives shop and frolic and spend their husbands not so hard earned cash.  Where trust fund babies wine and dine and get their spray on tans.  Seriously.  there are three spray on tan places within 2 blocks of my job.  Honey's, Brown Sugar, and Brownies.  It makes me laugh every time I pass by.  Mercedes and bmw's, SUV's and little bitty dogs being carried around like babies.  It makes me want to puke.  But not on the doggies.. only on the babies. hahaha.  Tomorrow is I.D.    I told my room mate Parker I'd go with her.  We're going to get our dance on, or at least I am.  I want to dance so bad.  It doesn't count when you're all alone. I wish I had someone to dance with.  But I have to stop wishing because wishes are stupid and dumb.  I'm going shopping tomorrow.  I'm feeling saucy!

      :::insert insane amounts of laughter here:::  I'm easily amused.  I like to laugh, what can I say.  So I was reading through my emails. Most of which were comments on my blog, and then at the end it was a spam message from Ticket Master telling me not to miss Nickelback.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing so hard.  I so needed that.  Stupid Nickelback. The name itself makes me laugh let alone getting a stupid email telling ME not to miss them.   fucking hillarious.   In more serious news today I got a $75 dollar check from the city of San Francisco.  Little do they know I owe about $400 in parking tickets or they wouldn't have been giving ME money.  Thankfully I don't have a car anymore or that shit would be booted... for life.  I want one though. I was thinking about getting one for my birthday.  Just you know, a little something to cheer myself up on my special day.  Too bad my birthday isn't until the 20th of December.    I don't really want a birthday this year anyhow.    People on the streets like to stop me and tell me the strangest thing.  There is this guy who stops me whenever he sees me and yells, "It's the jewish girl!"  But I'm not jewish.  My father is jewish.  His mother is jewish and his grandparents are jewish.  I am not jewish.  I am nothing.  I have no organized religion tied to me.  I know a little about jewish holidays but that's it.  I don't think I have any stereotypical jewish features but he insists on calling me "the jewish girl".  My father is Spanish.  I'm half spanish, half british.  I look like a pasty white girl with dark eyes and hair.  He tells me every week he's going to win the lottery and when he does he's going to kick down some of it to me.  Don't think for a second if it comes true I won't be holding him to his word.    It's been too cold in the city lately.  Too cold. The highs for the week are only getting up to 61°F and the lows at 52°F.  Usually our summer days peak around 80°F for a few hours, but not lately.  I freeze at my first job.  The Marina district is always colder than where I live.  For this reason I think that's why all the mexicans live by me. The Mission district, because it's warmer and more like mexico.  The marina is colder, foggier and moist much like England and this is why all the wasp-y people live there!  hahaha. again I amuse myself.   This is hillarious.   urlLink Drug Test

      the last song I heard as I left the house was Jack the Ripper by Morrissey.  Fitting.  Today I look like the girl version of Carlos D. Scary. Black pinstrip skirt that falls just below the knees. Black opaque tights and mod/goth shoes.  I spiced it up though with a fitted bright red sweater.

      I started last week off on a high and it's gone down hill very rapidly. Yes this is a self depreciating post.   Hi. My name is Amber, and I'm a loser.   Why am I working two jobs, two crappy jobs?  Why do I not have any REAL goals.  Being a "lady that lunches" is NOT a real aspiration.  Why am I not good enough ever for anything.  I'm not sure why I ever dropped out of school.  Why thoughts of my future were always dilluted away to almost nothing.  I've never had dreams or goals bigger than what I could actually foresee happening.  I've never had any ideas about what I wanted to do with my life.  I'm lazy.  I'm full of doubt that I can actually do anything and it doesn't feel very good.  I always thought I'd just grow up and it would come to me.  It never did.  Should I make a decision now?  Is there something gnawing at the back of my psyche that will drive me in a certain direction? And if so, how and when will I know?  Is it already too late? Have I missed my chance?  I feel trapped.  I feel like I'm getting too old too fast and I have no control over anything anymore.    Maybe I'll go back to school.  Live off financial aid and student loans.  Keep my one part time job.  Maybe I'll be stuck doing the same shit over and over again until I die a miserable, lonely old lady.  Why is it that some people know what they want to do with their lives and then there are the people like me that are just fucking clueless.  I'm always afraid I'm not going to make it so I never even try or worse yet, I half ass it and then prove to myself that I suck.    Nothing can ever just be.   I fear and hope for tomorrow... literally.

      I was riding on the bus with my friend Kevin. Kevin is one of my best friends.  He's my gay boyfriend.  He's not one of those overly afeminate gay boys and he's not super leather-like butchy.  He's just your average gay boy. Cute, funny, into spending lots of money and drinking to the brink of death with me.  He's nearly gave me alcohol poisoning on new years eve.  Anyhow back to the bus ride.  We were just sitting there talking and then it gets kind of quiet.  I look over at him and he's just staring at my boobs! I kind of give him this sideways - what are you doing? - kind of look.  He smiles but keeps staring and then he pokes one.   "What?!" I snapped, and he kind of laughed "Your boobs don't bounce, they just sort of jiggle a little."   "Why are you looking at my boobs?" "I don't know, they're kinda cute." I took a long breath knowing this wasn't going to just go away and said, " I thought you thought girl stuff was gross, disgusting, what else have you said.. oh yeah fucking nasty!  What's changed now?" "boobs are okay.  Yours are cute and perky and" I cut him off, well he continued to talk but I stopped listening I was turning all sorts of bright red. "shut up.  Your going to give me a complex. shut up."  And that's when he did it.  He fucking reached out and grabbed them on the bus.  Right there.  I just sort of froze.  He was laughing.  I was dying.  People were staring.  "so what size bra do you wear?"  "size small, why?" "really, what size?" "34C" "that isn't small" "it's small on a ginormous girl like me" "yeah you are a bit on the tall side." "ya think?"   From that point on everything went back to normal. I hate when gay boys get all curious about girls. EW.

      Last time I checked it was the 5th of fucking July!  That means pack away the stupid firecrackers you stupid fucks!    I get up this morning and get dressed for work.  I wasn't running late, everything was going well and then I stepped out of the security gate and into the street.  DEAD.  No one was out, not even a car on the road. Overcast. Cold.  I walked towards my new bus stop (I stopped taking the 22 last Thursday and now ride the 49).  Even the line at the methadone clinic was missing.  Not a soul on the road.  It reminded me of 28 Days Later.  I forgot that today was a "holiday".    A holiday I was under the impression that I didn't get off.  I was one of three on the bus.  It was amusing because it was a double length bus and totally empty.  I sat in the back anyway.  I got to work only to find I was locked out of the building.  I sat on the stoop for 45 minutes before giving up and going back home.  Not that I wanted to work, but the fact that I was told we didn't get it off, and that I was up at 7am and that i didn't go out with my friends, and that I was now sitting in the cold down in the marina forced to look at stupid marina ladies with their sneakers and flood capri sweat pant combo (it's hideous!) walking their stupid dogs and cleaning up their stupid dogs stupid shit off the stupid sidewalk just made me a little bit angry.  I came home and decided I needed to be a little productive, so I did the dishes and cleaned up the kitchen.  Took out PILES of trash. Apparently I'm the only one in this house that knows how to do it.    I hate being angry.  Vacation is all I ever think about anymore.

      the 4th of July sucks, because I still have to work tomorrow.  Last night I had the most amazing dream.  It was so hot.  I could have fantasies about that dream for a few months.    I had been listening to Controller. Controller last night as the previous post implies it was on repeat while I was cleaning my room, and figuring out how much I owed for bills and just all the other stupid adult shit I have to do that I loathe.  So I'm folding my laundry and dancing around in my room like a stupid girl just doing my thing and I look over and see it's already sometime in the early morning.  So I stripped down and crawled into bed.  Only I couldn't get comfortable.  I kept placing the pillows behind me like they were another body and finally I felt settled in.  I must have taken the CD off of repeat because it wasn't on when I woke up this morning.  I can't recall.  I fell asleep pretty soon after getting comfortable.  The next thing I know is music is playing (similar to what I was listening to before falling asleep or perhaps it was the CD still playing?) and I'm in some dark place, some hot, dark building dancing.  Dancing harder than I've danced in a long time.  Dancing differently than I usually dance, because I'm not dancing by myself.  I'm not dancing in a big crowd I'm just dancing and someone else is there but I can't see them I can only feel them.  I'm hot and sweaty and there are tiny bits of light reflecting on skin, but I can't really see who it is.  BUT.. I know who it is. (I just can't tell YOU.) I couldn't seem to see their face in this dream.  It was a first person dream, like I'm really there not just watching.  I don't have many of these, usually my dreams are third person.  Anyhow it was just intense.  I woke up hot and sweaty and had to get a glass of water around 6am.  Then I crawled back in bed and realized I would be plagued by this dream all day, and that it was going to suck because I had to be at work and not at home thinking about that...  I can't wait for my hair to grow out, I feel so ugly with it the way it is. I just want everything to be better right now.  Is that too much to ask, really?  I don't want to work two jobs anymore.  I don't want to wait for things to come to me.   Although... I can think of a few things that have recently COME TO ME that have been nothing short of amazing.   But that is besides the point!  I mostly just want to not have to work 2 jobs anymore, well at least not my stupid lame basement dwelling job anymore.  Oh yeah, and I don't want to owe anyone or any place or any company money anymore, ever!

      I'd like to give a big Thank You to Greg for getting me addicted to Controller. Controller.  I've been listening to it on repeat for the last hour.  I think my room mates are going to kill me now.  :) That is all.

      September is going to be a fabulous month indeed!  It's the month I find a new place to live, where ever that may be.  It's the month Interpol comes out with their sophamore album, which includes  A Time To Be So Small , which has kind of always been a favorite of mine.  Dark and Sexy.  It's also the month that I will be taking my next vacation.  I want to go somewhere warm and dirty with air that is hard to breathe.  I am going to quit my old job in September and find a new one also.  I'm taking the money from my 401(k)  from my old job and using it for my vacation. So I guess I'll be quitting before I leave on my vacation which I want to take Sept. 11th - 19th.  It's 9 days.  Extended vacation.  Last time I took a week, 9 days will be the most time I've ever taken off from home.  I want to disappear from here for a while.  I want to pretend I'm someone more important than this.  I want a lot of things.  I have a few hopes and dreams and they are just now showing themselves to me.  I'm not going to be young forever.  My mortality has been on my mind for the last few days.  It's creepy.  I don't really like it, but it's inevitable I guess?  Too bad I'm living for the future, but right now is kind of boring.     And he said to stop fidgeting with my keys...  If you had this much going on inside your mind all the time you'd fidget a lot too.  I keep 90% of what I want to do and what I want to be and what I want to experience locked away from almost everyone.  I used to think I was an open book, but the older I get the more I can see I only want to share parts of myself with certain people.  The people that are fleeting in my life usually have the most impact.  I usually open up to them more than I can with my friends and family mostly because I'm not really afraid of how they will see me.  These people don't already have a preconcieved notion of who they think I am.  One day I hope to find someone I can be me around all the time.  iTunes is randomly playing  'Every Shining Time You Arrive'  by Sunny Day Real Estate.  How appropriate.  If you haven't heard it I recomend it. It's like the sound track for this post.    I should get dressed I have to leave for work in fifteen minutes and I'm wearing nothing but a towel and wet dripping hair.  Summer today is only 63°f

      ACK!  I wasn't able to escape this time.       Yes that blurry girl shaped blob on the left side of that picture, in the white shirt and the hair in front of her face is me dancing.  At least I'm nothing but a blur.  Fletcher (the DJ) was the main focus.  WHEW!  I'd hate to have super ugly pictures of me dancing on the internet. Just look at some of the rest of the  urlLink pictures .  Stupid hipster fucks!  The only hipster fuck I'll ever be nice too, or give the time of day to is Mike.  He's the one on the left.  He used to give me total boners a few years ago, but now everyone looks exactly like him.  That guy in the picture isn't his twin, but   he is!    Anyhow Mike is nice, we're friends so I go to his club.

      It's Friday.  I should be happy, right?  I'm not.  I'm miserable.  I'm not sick anymore.  I just feel empty.  I think I need another vacation.  Another excuse to run away from the nothing that is my life.    I have plans for some stupid bbq type 'let's get drunk on someone's roof and try not to fall off thingy' for Sunday night, but I don't want to go.  First off, it's going to be at my room mate Leslie's boyfriends house.  Second Jessica's quasi-boyfriend is Will's friend.  They're all going to be shacking up like bunnies all cuddly-cute with each other and I'm going to be the girl with two 40's in her hands teatering near the edge trying to keep my balance, but wishing I couldn't. I HATE hanging out with my friends and thier boyfriends or fuck-buddies or whatever they are for the moment.  It isnt' so bad when it's just one of them, but both?! NO WAY!  Not to mention both of those boys, as nice as they are are all bmx bike riders that don't eat meat and blah, blah, blah.  Okay so it's not the fact that they don't eat meat, I just don't have much in common with them and I don't want to be the only one there wasted, killing time, wishing I wasn't there.  It doesn't hurt that I'm tall, and already stand out in a crowd, but alone too.  NO NO NO NO. Jessica was trying to give me the pouty face but it's so not working this time.    So I'm going to stay home, get wasted on my own, maybe wander the streets celebrating the fact that it's a day we can shoot mini-explosives off into the air to see bright pretty lights.  Or not. Sleep might be better.    -----------------------------------------end thought here----------------  Last night I couldn't sleep.  I felt so uncomfortable.  I finally took off all my clothes and slid under the covers completely nude.  I haven't slept nude alone in a long time.  Oh sure I've been mostly naked, but not 100% in a while.   I forgot why.  It's not important.  The feeling of my warm flannel sheets (I live in SF it gets colder here even in summer and our apartment has no heater) against my bare skin kept me awake even longer... My mind wouldn't just rest.  It made me wonder what you went through your head when you rolled over.

      Thanks to Greg, I've been thinking a lot about where I live.  Then I remembered my friend Stephen, who took tons of artsy like photos of the city before he left. My favorite one is this one.   It's Delores Park late at night and two people are sitting on a bench under a tree. It's my favorite park.  It's not to big, but is close to my house and has a neat little feeling to it.  I go there with some beers and blanket and just kind of hang out.  I've never been at night though, but I wouldn't imagine it to be much fun all alone.  Other boring photos:  urlLink un   urlLink deux   urlLink trois   urlLink quatre   urlLink cinq   I was a cute kid, once upon a time...   I'm still not sure what happened.  Lately I've been in a photo type mood.  I should buy some film for my poloroid camera.  I need to start documenting my life so I can remember it.

      With everyone's talk of moving lately, or wanting to move, or even remotely thinking about it, I've been debating what the hell am I going to do come October.  My lease is up.  I want to move to a cuter place.  Who will want to move with me?  What will happen?  I want closets! And 2 bathrooms sounds good too.  more thoughts on this as they come to me.

      I am giving myself 8 months to save up enough to move.  Okay so really it shouldn't take anyone eight months to save enough money to move but I want to be 100% prepared.  I want to have enough money saved up for rent for an entire year, plus left over money for food and bills.  I'm usually a very spontaneous person, but this is just way too big of a leap for me to take with out a safety net.  So there it is.  March/April I should be all set to go.   As of right now of course I have not a penny to my name, but I have a plan.  A map of things to come.  I haven't told my parents of my plans yet.  I figure it's only a matter of time before I break their hearts so I might as well hold out for as long as I can.  And if they see how responsible I'm being about the whole thing they will understand how prepared I really am and won't be so worried about me leaving them behind.  I've definitely leaned on them more than I probably should have because they always offer, and because they are always there...  Of course I'm not the kind of person that can abandon my family.  I love them.  I'd have to come home often.  They are my parents and they love me.  It killed them to watch me move 100 measely miles away what will they think of 3,000?  It's been a decision in the making for the last seven years.  One which I never wanted to come to terms with but finally have and I feel confident in it.   This week begins a whole new chapter in the book that is my life.

I.D. celebrates this contradiction by forcefully stimulating your brain with quixotic perfunctory remedial learnin'.... I.D. style! yes bitches. Bring your best schoolgirl uniform, smart-person glasses and librarian snooty gear, or professor disguise complete with patched jacket with suede elbows and a smoking jacket! ..cuz this shit is going off like a riot of post-grad intelligentsia with a flaming bottle of booze... special surprises all night... expand your rapidly deteriorating brain before its too late!"    and the 27th     As for tonight, I have no idea what I'm going to do...

      I slept in this morning just the tiniest bit. It felt good. I got up washed my face and brushed my teeth and then spent a good ten minutes just admiring myself in the mirror. My waste is getting so tiny. Even as I slid my pants on I realized that maybe I should have bought the size 6 instead of the 8's. Of course when I tried them on the 8's fit perfectly. But now, they are a little loose. Not so big that they look frumpy or sloppy. The 6's would have been way to short on my long legs though. 8 is a good size, especially for my height.  I look way too professional today. Black slacks, white button up shirt, cropped black trench coat. LOAFERS - ew I know, very gross. However the last three days I've been trying to dress up a t-shirt. For instance the other day I was wearing a lavender colored t-shirt with a black skirt, and a black cardigan. But ya know, it is still just a t-shirt and I know I am going to get talked to about it if I didn't pull something with buttons on it out of the closet soon.  All I really want to do today is stay at home running around in my undies and a t-shirt alternating between excercizing and watching tv. I have a head full of fantasies...  I keep thinking that maybe I don't want to move from the flat I'm living in now, I mean until I really move.  I'm in not financially ready to pack up and take off somewhere with out a job or anything, and my lease is up in 2 months at the place I'm at now.  Oh sure it would be nice to have closets and a window, but it's been my home for the last two years. It's close and conveniently located to  everything . But... I'm not sure what the other girls want to do.  I had a cookie for breakfast this morning, but I'm really craving sushi. Some spicey salmon rolls and maybe some sashimi. The last time I ordered any sashimi though it was way too big! I nearly gagged there was so much in my mouth I could barely chew. Next time I'll bring a little knife with me and chop it into bite sized pieces. It's so wierd. It tastes good, but if I have to sit and chew on it for a long time I start getting grossed out that it's just raw meat all up in my mouth. That's a big reason why the bites have to be small for me if it's sashimi, because if I have time to think about what I'm eating I'll make myself sick, even though I like it. I'm so odd at times. Mmmm, but I love me some Unagi. Okay I'm making myself so hungry right now I'm turning into Pavlov's dog.  I've been trying to drink more water, get more sleep, eat better, take a fucking multi-vitamin daily but I just can't seem to do it. I'm on the junk food diet from hell. I took ONE vitamin a few days ago. I get maybe 5 hours of sleep a night, I smoke, I drink, I do drugs, I drink rockstars to keep me going and maybe a few glasses of water a day, if I'm lucky. I  want  to be a healthier person, I really do however, I just completely lack the will power.  I'm supposed to go out and see an old friend of mine play some show tonight. I haven't seen Mark in like 4 years? It's going to be wierd. We all kind of parted ways on unsettling terms thanks to a few people that were in my circle of friends way back when. I'm glad I got out before they had the chance to drag me down into the spiraling abyss of backstabbing and hatred that had ensued. Jessica and I were the only ones to escape unscathed, well nearly anyhow.  Things are bothering me a lot lately. Stupid little things like when someone who's super fat thinks they can squish in on that one open spot on the bus/train cars and part of their fat leg or ass totally crushes and pinches you between them and the seat and you are now half way entwined in their being? My new slogan is "IF YOU CAN'T FIT, DON'T SIT!" Today this large man squished in to the seat next to mine and I started getting sucked into his rolls. I could care less how fat you are. Honestly it doesn't bother me until I'm being absorbed by it. When I see spots that are too tiny for me I stand. I don't try to squish my ass in. Anyhow someone finally got off a few stops down the line and "big-boy" was able to move over I felt relieved until a woman with MASSIVE hips came and plopped down squishing my leg! It kind of hurt. I don't even take up my own little seat and here she is taking up hers and mine. I just wouldn't do that to someone. She was practically sitting in my lap! It bothers me. I must sound like the bitchiest of bitches but really.

      I am so exhausted.  I'm sitting here looking up and printing out snapshots of random stocks and I just want to hang my head down and fall asleep.  I've stolen a few moments with my head down on the desk.   I woke up at 6:30 am wide awake from some sort of amazing dream, but laid back down and went to sleep until 7.  Everything was fine and now I've hit a wall of sleepiness. I must sleep.  I'm dreaming of beds and can't wait until 1 when I get to ride the bus to Union Square for my 2nd job.  I'll sleep on the bus instead of reading like I usually do.  It will be wonderful.  Sleep is wonderful.  I'm shoving mini milky way candy bar bites into my mouth to appease my growling stomache.  I'm so healthy it hurts.  I feel skinnier than ever though, and I contemplated whether or not I might have a tape worm.  I thought better of it though and figured no tape worm would be able to sustain life on the junk I eat.  Besides this is America and tape worms are super nasty.  I sold my cell phone on ebay.  It was the free one I got when I signed up with t-mobile, but I have since upgraded.  It didn't cost me a cent, and I just made $67.00 on it.  I'm still $100 short for rent.  Damn me and my spending spree.  I knew I should have not went shopping last week, but whatever.  I needed food and liquor.  Besides I have till the 5th (tomorrow) to send my rent into the landlords.  I'll just write them a check.  By the time they cash it I'll have the money there, I get paid on Friday at midnight via direct deposit.  I'm not worried at all.  I just wish I would have been more responsible and not so stupid.  But hey, that's me.  I am the girl that just manages to scrape by.  Everything always works out in the end.   I want to quit my jobs.  So who wants to marry my ass and support me for a few months.  I'll go back to work after that.  I just want a few months off.  I can cook, I can clean, and I give awesome head.

      Forget everything you thought you knew about me.  This is the new-old-new me. This is the me that made a new years resolution to drink MORE! The me that was the life of the party, the me that dances her ass off with reckless abandon.  This is the me I knew a few months ago, and a few months ago before that.  This is me on drugs.  Apparently my system is still adapted to taking the lexapro. Maybe I didn't quit for long enough. I feel good again, oh it's fake happy you can bet your ass it's not real, but it's nice to feel not so sad all the time again. It gives me this giddy, nervous energy. Today I was dancing around all crazy like, pulling up my skirt shake-shake-shaking it around. I was in a good mood. I felt pretty. The side effects have returned as well. Not the upset stomache side effect but the sexual side effects. I can't really complain, I guess. It could be worse. I have the exact opposite side effects of most people that take anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medicine. Instead of lacking in the libido area mine gets super amped. Everything is sexual to me. I can't stop looking at myself (side effect - vanity/narcissim). Listening to certain songs today totally excited me. I have wild lucid fantasies and dreams that come at all the wrong times. At work, it's not really an appropriate time, but what can I do? It's the craziest shit.  In other news, I got a library card. Lived here for eons and just now found where the library was. I'm retarded. I also like to buy books, so I'm not sure how much use this library card is going to get.

      Yesterday I found out that one of my managers was discussing my sexual orientation with a coworker of mine. Now what should I do? I was kind of offended, okay kind of doesn't even begin to describe how irritated I was. Mostly because I know that what she did I could get her in serious trouble for and possibly even fired. Now do I tell my boss, do I let it go, or do I use it as blackmail against her??? I'm thinking blackmail. Hey I'm a sneaky, no-good, underhanded, get-what-I-want-by-skill-or-by-force kind of girl. When it comes down to it. I'm just a little mean and it would teach her a lesson to ever bring up my name in a conversation I'm not in. >:)  She thinks I'm a lesbian because I'm always talking about Jessica to my coworkers. I'm sorry. I live with the girl. She's my best friend. I've known her for eight years. We have a lot of stories, and fun moments. Plus a few coworkers know her and are always asking about her. Oh, but if I talk about about a girl then that instantly makes me a fucking dyke. Hello flashbacks to high school. Just because I didn't go out with any of the guys from my high school that made me a lesbian too. Until I brought the cutest boy to some god aweful dance, which I only stayed at for fifteen minutes before sneaking out and driving off somewhere to make out. He lived in Auburn which was an hour and a half drive with out traffic and I wasn't allowed to drive all the way out there but I did anyhow. I drove this little navy blue toyota 4-speed truck. I always had to be the driver though...  Today I'm playing office bitch. I've been sent to go get my boss coffee and money from the ATM. I'm making a million copies for her and it's going by pretty fast, pretty easy. I didn't even want to come to work today so ya know? It's not that bad. I look like a high school girl and I can't stop listening to Morrissey and Enon. More of the latter though.

      I started taking those fucking pills again.  The Lexapro.  I talked to Kevin today about being unhappy.  I think he understood.  He mentioned he wasn't feeling very happy lately either, and that maybe the weather was to blame.  I wouldn't doubt it.  it's been grey, foggy, sprinkly, dark and cold for weeks now.  But I think my unhappiness is more than just the weather.  I think the weather just makes it worse is all.  So I'm back on the fucking happy pills.  The pills that make my stomache feel upset more than it already does.  They make me feel like I have morning sickness.  I hope they make me feel better, sooner.. I don't want to wait three months to feel good again.   It's not like I'm sitting around sulking all the time.  I usually keep it bottled up.  I still enjoy sitting around with my room mates watching movies and tv.  Going out, getting drunk, having fun.  It's just the quiet alone times that bother me so damned much...
