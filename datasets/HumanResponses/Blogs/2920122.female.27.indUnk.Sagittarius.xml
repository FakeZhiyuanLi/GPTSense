      rue Charles Fourier, in the 13th  Opening in 1887 and no more than 255 meters in length, it marks the beginning of our Free City--our phalanstère--with a street small in scope but grand in vision.   The view from the south, at the Place d'Abbé G. Henocque.  The door and number of the third building on the right...

      Destination: parc Georges Brassens, rue de la Convention  Weather: overcast/sunny spells  Time of departure: 1pm  Canine breakdown (today’s offerings were hard to identify): 4 chiens, one of which was a Labrador and another a kind of terrier  Public transport options: 62 bus, 69 bus, PC1    Dimanche. Sundays are still sleepy in Paris, the by now empty significance of a day adhered to like glue. The route between the 14th, 13th and 15th arrondissements is becoming homeground to me now, and I know my way around these streets better than most. Today my route takes me down boulevard Jourdan to Porte d’Orléans, right on avenue Géneral Léclerc, left on rue d’Alésia and straight on to the rue de Cronstadt, where I take another left and enter the parc Georges Brassens. Back on rue d’Alésia, there’s a wall covered in prehistoric beasts, some kind of postmodern attempt at cave painting. .         my favourite is the mammoth, who’s really quite wonderfully rendered. I’ve always appreciated the fact that these particular beasts have ‘woolly’ in their name. .         A little further down rue d’Alésia, in fact just where it seamlessly becomes rue de Vouillé and just before it equally effortlessly turns into rue de la Convention, is a street that tugs at my heart. .         Hi, I say. Hi. And then enough with this misty-eyed sentimentality and on with the mission, dammit. Two great bulls guard the entrance to the park. I realize that I have no idea what I am looking for here, only that once I have found it I am meant to head to rue de la Convention and break with just that. The bulls are cool, but they don’t call out to me. There’s a statue of a donkey inside the park, all kitschy and weird and filled with flowers. I don’t think that’s it either. Just ahead, a large slide… am I meant to go down this? I think it’s closed. How the hell will I know when I find this thing. I ban all notions of U2 lyrics from my brain. And then I turn to the left. What’s that? Under those iron eaves? .         And there it is. I smell books. Nose in the air like a true old book hound, I run around the park like a displaced eejit trying to work out how the hell to get TO the books. A bit of scrambling later, and I’ve found the entry. .         My wallet feels lighter already… what are you doing to me, monster? Is this some kind of test of my willpower? Don’t you know me well enough by now?  There’s another sign on the door, encore un chat perdu.         It’s a very cute message. These people obviously love their beastie very much.    LOST  ORANGE CAT  Male, good and fat, yellow eyes, miaows a lot, tattoo on his right ear.  If you’ve seen him, or let him into your house recently, please let us know at:  01 44 19 05 95  or  06 07 23 53 68  THANK YOU ALL.    Bonne corpulence! Miaule beaucoup! The French language is very, very wonderful and versatile and strange.  I see no sign of the yellow-eyed meowser, and so wander on into the hall of books. Ninety minutes, eight euros, and a beautiful copy of La Princess de Clèves, another of Camus’ L’homme révolté, Vercors’ La Marche à l’étoile, De Brissac’s essay collection O dix-neuvième! and (best of all) a lovely edition of Poe’s Le Chat noir et autres histories, translated by Baudelaire later, I leave. The ‘later’ in that last sentence is far too far away from its fellows.  Back onto the rue de la Convention, then, where the day’s food market has just finished and several glâneurs are searching the debris for melons, camembert and apples that have been left behind. A street cleaner chundles past, spraying the footpath with streams of water. Paris uses a lot of water. I take advantage of the clean footpath to do a cartwheel. Will that do? Does that break with anything? Apart from common decency? I don’t know. Next to me the hippotami look out from their window, laughing.          p.s. I forgot about the orphanage. I've never seen one either. I guess we'll both have to wait a while.

      Take a walk to the Parc George Brassens in the 15th.  Walk the park thoroughly--as it looks like a cracked egg from the sky.    This cat lives in an apartment overlooking the park. He knows what goes on at the weekend.  After finding what you are looking for, which will be there if you are there today or tomorrow, head north to the Rue de la Convention.  Do a dance in the street or walk backwards. Break with the street somehow.  Slightly north on Rue Vaugirard there is an orphanage.  I have never seen an orphanage.

      Destination: parc Larousse, ville de Malakoff  Weather: glorious  Time of departure: 1.30pm  Canine breakdown (parading of dogs obviously illegal on national holidays): 1 poodle, 1 poodle cross & 1 choc Labrador cross sitting in passenger & driver seats of abandoned car  Public transport options: PC1 and 89 buses, metro line 4 to porte d’orléans    This particular project may have been hexed from the start. Several days of freezing rain made it impossible to do any kind of sitting around in a park. Last night it cleared up and I set off, only to realize half an hour into the trip that I had forgotten my dictionary. Trip aborted. Today I had already reached  urlLink malakoff  before I worked out that my camera was still in my room. But the weather was glorious, it’s a national holiday, and I refused to go back. So no pictures. I would write about the fascinating RER harassment unscandal going on here right now, but maybe I’ll just point you  urlLink here , as it has absolutely nothing to do with this site.   Walking down boulevard Jourdan to boulevard Brune, there is nothing but fumes and bleary-eyed people, hungover from dancing with the pompiers last night. The buses have little French flag ears, fluttering in the wind as they come speeding down the boulevard. Traditionally, the president of the Republic pardons criminals on Bastille Day (although this year he’s decided that race crimes and sex crimes will not be forgiven… and it’s the first time!!) and so I think that the bus drivers all break the speed limit on purpose, five times over, thinking that there will be a reprieve. It’s just that the policemen are also hungover, and have more important things to worry about today.  I take a left at Porte de Chatillon and immediately everything takes on an ambience of strip mall. There’s a super GO SPORTS across the road, claiming to cover some 3000 sq m of space. It’s pretty big. And then a SUPER MONOPRIX which, being more patriotic than the GO SPORTS, is closed. None of the other Monoprix branches are closed today. Perhaps that’s why this one is super.  Crossing over the periphérique feels a little like sticking my nose in an exhaust pipe and breathing in deeply. But once I turn off the thoroughfare and onto avenue Larousse, the city ceases to be sprawl and becomes a town. Bars and brasseries, all very male-dominated. Little alimentations. Bakeries on vacation, with lists of other non-vacating bakeries on their windows. The parc Larousse, when it appears on my left, is rather small. Not even so much of a park, at least not when compared with the likes of Buttes Chaumont or André Citroën or even my own Montsouris. It’s closer to one of those narrow meridians in the city proper, with a few trees and some gravel and some old men playing pétanque. Except this one has eradicated the old men in favour of a kiddies’ playground. The kids don’t seem to care. There’s very little grass here, and so parkgoers are spread out on a series of green benches. One holds three youngish men, one with a guitar. They are later joined by a couple with two young children. At one stage an old man comes into the park and hands one of the young men a plastic bag. Then he leaves. Another bench features a middle-aged man and his bag. They’re reading. Also reading is the young man with the ponytail on my right. Beside him, two 20-something year old women, gossiping. They are interested in my dictionary. And then there’s the woman with a towel wrapped around her waist, trousers rolled up, baseball cap, rugby shirt, washing vegetables and clothes in the drinking fountain. Next to her, a sunbather, lying on her back. Behind is a high-rise, all pink with balconies. Les chiens sont interdits. So no dogs, but lots of pigeons.     My random words:    Mutiné(e) adj mutinous, rebellious n m/f . mutineer, rebel.    Catégoriel, elle adj 1. category; classement ~ classment by category. 2.

Elle regardait les gens autour d’elle, en essayant de les mettre dans un classement catégoriel. C’était commendataire, mais un tel but n’était pas rattrapable.

Moulin,  Veuillez noter ces trois mots :  FENDILLEMENT   RIPAILLER  MOUCHARDER  Merci,   Nicky Agate    A fendillement is a cracking, spitting, splitting, springing, crackling or crazing. Ripailler is an outmoded verb that means to have a feast. Moucharder is to tell tales or grass on someone. I leave these words on a scrap of my notebook on the avenue Jean Moulin, chef du Conseil National de la Résistance. A wall, half tumbled-down, looks like it should have been here when he was. I tuck the piece of paper between the stones and watch its erratic descent, past spiders’ webs and memories, to a niche behind some wood.

      Bring a dictionary outside the city skin to the Parc Larousse.       Choose five words at random and develop a scene for the park.  Choose three other words you don’t yet know and write them on a small sheet of paper.  Follow the Avenue Larousse down to the Mason des Arts.  Left on Boulevard Pierre Brossolette and back into Paris proper until the Avenue Jean Moulin.  Leave the words somewhere for Mr. Moulin to read.

      Destination: jardin de Tocqueville  Weather: absolutely gorgeous   Time of departure: 11.40am  Canine breakdown: 1 golden retriever, 1 poodle, 1 husky, 1 westie, 1 shih tzu  Public transport options: 6 metro to charles de gaulle étoile then 2 metro to villiers      Preamble: There was something about this one that was bound to go wrong from the start. The time of day, maybe, or the fact that I was distracted by the deuxième démarque in the monoprix sales. Capitalism... i don't know. Whatever the cause, my decision to find the jardin de Toqueville and attempt some physiognomy in order to better know the city in the space of an hour and a half, and to walk there from Passy, should not have taken after a double-dose of vending machine coffee. .         Anyway.  Passy being within a stone's throw of the tour Eiffel and that part of Paris in which the sixty year old women are dressed like 20 year old girls and the 20 year old girls are dressed like middle-aged women, but in the most expensive clothes, I am tempted to do a fashion breakdown instead of a canine one. Normally, an average walk from the metro to my school will reveal several thousand poodles and no other dog larger than a teacup. Today doesn't provide much better rewards, but the fashion becomes much less interesting after five minutes, when Passy cedes to Trocadero and Trocadero to one of the most touristed (and polluted) intersections of the city: l'arc de triomphe..         One could also do a car breakdown of Paris. Cars are just a means to an end here... half the population of the city drives a tiny smart car, the other half some clapped-out old volkswagen of golf. And SUVs (les quatre-quatres) are banned from the city streets. It's very refreshing, especially after two years of living in the midwest of the United States, where every corn-fed student seems to be given a gas-guzzler (or worse still, a hummer) on their 16th birthday. I digress. It's the influence of Monoprix.    Paris also smells and sounds different around here. Perfume, exhaust fumes, sweet popcorn, dog shit... and then the sound of English in its many accents, and of German, and Italian, and not being a true polyglot I don't really know what else. But very little French. None of the sing-song cadence of the boulangère as she sings good morning to each customer.     Round and round the arc de Triomphe I go, remembering last summer and a certain afternoon spent circling the thing in an aforementioned smart car. Now they are bringing out a four-door. Apparently one's feet will still feel like they are touching the earth. At avenue de Wagram I take a right, and slowly the sounds of cameras and coaches fade as the 17th becomes truly inhabited. Haussmann's influence is strong around here, almost oppressive, but the rigid effect of the avenue is soothed somewhat by the occasional well-placed square.     I reach the place des Ternes, and am beginning to wonder if this was such a good idea. It's already 12.10 and I have to be back and in the classroom by one. Tant pis... right again on the avenue de Wagram and on up to the place of the same name. I see signs all round for the périphérique ... it's  fluide  and realize how close I am to the ceinture of the city, to her belt. place de Wagram, right onto boulevard Pereire. It's late... almost 1230. I feel like I can't do justice here. Nor can I read anyone's face, I'm moving so bloody fast. Finally! The rue de Tocqueville..         And it is here that I make the error. In my haste, I take a right instead of turning left. There's a beautiful woodsmith's shop on the corner.         Marching marching marching and I stop to take a picture of a 19th-Century carving on the wall of an old insurance building..         But where's the damn garden? The numbers are descending, and I realise that I can't remember where I was meant to enter the garden. I look at the time on a parking meter. 12.40. Mission aborted. I have to go.

      Inspired by the recent American holiday, and in preparation for the upcoming French celebration:  Le Jardin Tocqueville dans le 17eme           The common man in the United States has understood the influence of the general prosperity on his own happiness, an idea so simple but nevertheless so little regarded by the people.  Moreover, he is accustomed to regard that prosperity as his own work.  So he sees the public fortune as his own, and he works for the good of the state, not only from duty or from pride, but,  I dare almost say, from greed...  Nothing is more annoying in the ordinary intercourse of life than this irritable patriotism of the Americans.  A foreigner will gladly agree to praise much in their country, but he would like to be allowed to criticize something, and that he is absolutely refused.  -Democracy in America   Not much has changed since the 1800s.  Please have a coffee in a bar on or near the jardin. What does the city look like in the faces of the people there?

      Destination: rue de Casablanca  Weather: overcast   Time of departure: 7.30pm  Canine breakdown (scarce pickings; I took the bus): 1 golden lab, 1 poodle, 1 mutt with a pointy nose  Public transport options: PC1 or 62 bus         An immediate dirth of canine activity on the PC1 bus. Begin to rue decision to take it but as we pass outpost after outpost on the Parisian circumference, it becomes worth the decrease in dog activity. The PC1 is both the least and the most Parisian of the city’s buses. It never leaves the periphery, not once venturing into the inner circles of urbanity, but it connects with the last stop on many metro lines. It’s an heure de pointe and there are people everywhere, armpits in the face of other’s human heads. The peripheral settlements vary hugely in their social status, but by the time we reach Porte de Vincennes, my chosen stop in the 15th, we’re well within bourgeois ground.  Walking up the rue du Hameau, I’m first struck by the restaurants. Middle class, of varied world cuisine, and empty. Then I reach rue de la Croix Nivert and realize that it’s this quartier’s architecture that renders it most strange. It’s a good time of night to be out, the shadows cast by a setting sun insisting upon the incongruity in architectural style.         The pigeons – and there are many – seem to prefer one particular kind.         rue de la Croix Nivert is full of trash. Everywhere the big green bins are overflowing. Was there a block party this weekend? Or do the bin men come tonight? I don’t know, but the sight – and the smell – are striking. There’s even trash where a rusty sign specifically states that trash is unacceptable.          Moving swiftly on, I pass a little T-junctioned lane, with a plomberie on one side and a theater on the other. Both have wonderful signs, and just in case you get them confused, someone has thoughtfully spelled things out on the space between the two.        And then a little further down, I see a poster tacked to the noticeboard of a Laundromat. Reading it through the window, I see it concerns a lost cat. She looks like one of ours, lemonstre. The note is so sad: they think she may have got lost on one of the neighbouring terraces, "the scaffolding having served as her trampoline," and are asking if anyone has seen her, or if they should broaden their search. On first glance, the picture suggests that it is the girl, not the cat, who is lost. A dubious tactic?         On the corner of rue de la Croix Nivert and rue Lecourbe, the advertising in a bistro window cries out to be noticed.          The winsome ghost on the guingette poster is just odd and lovely; the fooding poster I have noticed all over town. It’s an advertisement for a new magazine called, unsurprisingly, Fooding. If there’s any way to sell things to the French, a combination of gastronomy, reading matter and suggestive photography would seem to be just it.         The rue Casablanca is just opposite. It’s tiny – I could walk it in maybe thirty paces. There’s a brasserie on one corner and a hotel on the other. This, too, is a dead end… what used to be a lycée téchnique, and is now just a derelict building site.          The window I can’t explain.         On the left hand side of the street as I look to its dead end is an art gallery of sorts; the art inside seems as close to bad as I’ve seen. I wonder how they pay the rent.          Disgusted at my own snottiness, I walk away, but not before trying to inconspicuously snap the young man wolfing down what looks like poached eggs on toast (in Paris?) in the brasserie.         Feeling like I may have cheated the quartier by talking the bus, I decide to walk up the rue de la Convention until I reach Alésia… from thereon in I’ll be on familiar ground. The walk is worth it for three precious moments: a comic-book store with everything in its three windows displayed upside-down, apart from the handwritten sign that reads “DERNIER BD AVANT L’AUTOROUTE!!!”; the baths, still operated by the city         And the nail shop.           I take a leaf from my good friend Jennifer’s book and decide to photograph the shop window. I suspect I may not have done justice to these disembodied hands.

      Off of Rue Lecourbe, the Rue de la Croix Nivert.  Nearby is a small street next to a strange gardin--the Rue Casablanca.         We'll always have Paris.  Indeed.

      Destination : rue Didot  Weather : overcast   Time of departure : 5.30pm  Canine breakdown : 1 black lab, 1 german shepherd in a cafe, 1 pregnant mutt in a cafe, 1 westie, 2 yorkies, 2 terriers, 2 airedales, 5 poodles  Public transport options : 62 bus    I can’t find my map and so need to turn to the route suggested to me by maporama. Straight up and into the parc Montsouris, which I try and visit at least once a day to laugh at the ducklings as they learn how to swim. People are everywhere in the park today: older ladies drinking tea at the buvette, mothers watching their kids play in the climbing area, picnickers, lovers, football players, joggers, and all around the lake people watching, alone but relaxed in their solitude, happy in it, reading or writing or looking out onto the lake.         The water birds are beautiful, and over on a flat, wet rock different coloured ducks lie sleeping beside a basking turtle. The little boy next to me turns to his brother, “T’as vu? T’as vu la tortue? Sur le rocher là? À côté du canard? Tu l’as vu?” At first the kid can’t see it, and then suddenly he gurgles in delight, “Ouais!” I walk on past the ponies (the word is spelt ‘poneys’ here) who spend their day trekking round and round the park and débouche onto the Avenue Reille. Waiting for the lights on the other side is a wedding party, the second I have seen heading for the park since I arrived in this quartier.          On up the rue Saint-Yves and over to Alésia. A lived-in calm hangs in the air around here; it’s a place, one of those corners of a city’s nexus, where people live. The only stores respond to quotidiana: boulangerie, alimentation, bar-PMU. Even the graffiti is calmer here.          The rue d’Alésia itself is like most of the minor but still heavily used Parisian thoroughfares: Monoprix, balconies, boulangerie after boulangerie. Atkins is nowhere here. Nowhere. I reach the rue Didot and take a left, wondering off in search of villas. It was Richard Pevear who told us there were so few villas in Paris, I remember this now. He lives at villa Poirier, and we were at villa Gaudelet at the time. The first I come to today is villa Duthey, a little alley off to the left of the already-minor rue Didot.         And then a few steps further down, villa Deshayes.         These streets seem to get older, more cobbled, more faded… more lovely as I descend rue Didot. Villa collet is next, also on the left, just a few steps from villa Deshayes.        They just don’t stop. But then they do. I know I have to cross the road to find villas Leone and Mallebay,               but I don’t know where villa Jamot has gone. It’s only now, looking at an in-depth map of the area, that I notice that Jamot is shaded in grey. What does that mean on a map? Is it a ghost villa? I don’t know. Just past where it should be, the road passes over an old, overgrown railway track. The evening sun (entre chien et loup?) dapples through the trees and onto the track, evoking some kind of temporal leap in my consciousness. It is early 1930. I will be on the next train.         Leone deserves a closer look. The façade is amazing, and reveals nothing of what lurks behind. I wait for a few moments, hoping to catch a resident on their way in or out, but nothing happens.         I never do succeed in finding villa Jamot, despite walking the length of rue Didot several times over. There are flowers, though, discarded on the pavement and keeping their secrets close.         The people walking behind me start to become annoyed at my consistent stopping and photographing. They are pushing a pram. I keep walking, until I come across the vending machine. It’s quite a sight.          From this machine, should I so choose, I can extract anything from an omelette du lapin to chicken wings to camembert to petit écolier chocolate biscuits to milk to nutella to sandwiches to salads to something called doowaps and zazoo condoms. Wow. I tear myself away, and right at the end of the parallel rue des Plantes I find, as I expected to find, the villa Brune.        Nearby, a street is named after Giordano Bruno, and uncommonly (even for Paris) the facts of his death are also on the plaque. A philosopher burned as a heretic in 1600. And Italian. I wonder about his significance to this part of Paris.        I’m disappointed about my failure regarding villa Jamot. I wander around a little more, coming across the most beautiful tree by the Hotel ibis.        And then, as I start my path back to my green and white room in the polyglot college, I remember a little side street I’d seen on the way here. Not the one I’ve been looking for, but another villa nonetheless. Not quite but almost. I’m done with chasing ghosts.

      Somebody once told me that there were only about eight Villas in all of Paris.  I don't know if the number I remember is accurate, but near the Metro stop  Plaisance  is the Hopital Broussais, and walking south on the Rue Didot, one enters the Villa Ville.   Villa Collet  Villa Deshaves Villa Jamot  Villa Mallebay Villa Duthy  Before that, off of Rue Bardinet, which is a right turn after a right onto the Rue de l'Abbe Carton is the Villa Leone. A quick glance at the map further south by the Boulevard Brune, off the Rue des Plantes is the Villa Brune.   The streets look like a skyline of highrise buildings that spring up from the horizon into the dense sky of the city fabric, and down deep into its mud.  A figure/ground simultaneity.

      Destination : avenue d’ivry  Weather : overcast   Time of departure : 5.30pm  Canine breakdown : 1 chow chow, 1 grey terrier, 1 pitbull with a black eye, 1 grey poodle, 1 pug, 1 fat golden lab, 1 springer spaniel pup, 1 boxer sporting a red cape, 1 unidentified pointy thing  Public transport options : 67 bus, 62 bus    I can see Les Olympiades on the map. There is no indication as to what it might be. Crossing boulevard Jourdan i reach rue d’Arcueil, which curves round to the right before meeting a post office and the rue de Rungis. Here, a rotund bonhomme is leaning out his balcony window. At place de Rungis, people are drinking, laughing, getting home from work for the weekend. Yet another fat bonhomme is walking a very little springer spaniel, holding up traffic while everyone stops to look. Emboutillage! It’s while I am waiting for the traffic jam to clear that I see the tigers:         On up the rue Bobillot and look! over there on the park bench two men are huddled over a small thing… there’s a transaction going on. A little further up the street, just before it meets rue de Tolbiac, a grooming salon for dogs.  Toilettage . Another block, and it’s flagrant desire.         rue de Tolbiac is insanity at this hour. As I walk past the upper end of rue Charles Fourier, the church seems more imposing in its looming beigeness than it did yesterday. The patisserie directly opposite is now closed... which makes the experience of walking past it so much more rewarding:         Tolbiac is a hotchpotch of everything Paris could possibly represent, a microcosm of some kind of inhabited Parisian ideal. There’s the art gallery, which is currently closed, its insides gutted and messy, dustpans and paint on the floor. I couldn’t have gone anyway; the entrance fee is too high:          In the window, a cut and paste collage of a RATP sign.          Some kind of comment on the dubious tactics employed under the banner of vigilance? I’m not sure too much here makes sense. There’s a poem of sorts, about seven feet high, on the right.         I could stand here forever trying to work this place out, but instead I let the pull of one of Paris’ best interpretations of capitalism, the bookstore, take me away.         Right onto avenue d’Ivry and suddenly I am in Chinatown. Every second building is an Asian grocery store, every third a Chinese or Vietnamese restaurant. The cultural make-up undergoes an immense shift and here, amongst supermarkets called BIG where every fruit and vegetable is shrink wrapped in plastic – even the lettuce, even the oranges, even the bananas. Shooting to the sky are several towers and high rises, and everywhere the crowd,  la foule .  The French seems to contain the idea of madness within its crowd. I like it. It seems like the whole world is outside. In search of the Olympiades, I walk down to the Porte d’Ivry metro, but nothing advertises itself as such. The post office is on the rue Simone Weil, and the many signs pointing to it force the idea of this strange suicidal white philosopher onto the topography here.  Things don’t mesh around here. I’m still wondering what and where the Olympiades could be, and have started trying to make things fit. I am almost convinced that it can be what I want it to be:         (it turns out these are part of the Université de Paris 1: Centre Charles Mendez France) when I see a sign that reads OPTIQUE OLYMPIADES outside a grotty shopping complex. I go round the back of the OPTIQUE building, past the billiard hall and the dank corridors lined with stores, and on the other side I find proof that there’s at least a memory trace of this word, even if I still don’t really know what it stands for.         I look around me: tower blocks everywhere. And there’s one called the IMMEUBLE HELSINKI and another named the IMMEUBLE TOKYO, so, for lack of any other inspiration, I toy with the idea that it’s a collective name for this miniature high rise city, the names of the towers corresponding to the countries of the world. Some very French attempt at cultural unification through baptism. But still,  je ne sais pas. Je n’en sais rien . I squeeze onto the 62 bus coming from the Bibliothèque Nationale and start my ride home, still wondering.

      Destination : rue charles fourier  Weather : overcast ; chill in the air  Time of departure : 5pm  Canine breakdown : 2 golden retrievers, 1 wire-haired dachsund, 1 unidentifiable mutt  Public transport option : 67 bus       Today's destination isn't far from where I'm living, and as my instructions say i have to approach from the south, there's no point taking the bus, which would leave me at the north end of the street. I take boulevard Kellerman, and almost immediately before me is the  urlLink stade charlety , where the world record for the 100m was broken in 2002. it's a great white shark of a building, with wings that fold like armadillo scales towards its body. Following the boulevard to the left, I pass the BAR PMU LA MASCOTTE RAPIDO COURSE PAR COURSE, and wonder if the food is served as quickly as the bets are played and the name is said. Kellerman briefly becomes the rue des Longues Raies before reverting to its former self -- somewhere around here come the two golden retrievers and the saucisson a pattes. Left under the bridge and onto the rue des Peupliers -- on the corner, a couscous restaurant. It was crowded when I walked past two days ago; now there's just a lined man, sitting in the window, looking without seeing into space.       My dumpy Kodak digicam is looked at with some suspicion, especially when I photograph the dustbin and the street sign at place de l'Abbe Georges Hencoque. From here, the rue Charles Fourier doesn't look like much, although it is wholly dominated by a goliath beige church at its northern end. The third building on the right is a little hard to find, because they all seem to bleed into each other with little regard for architectural style or numeration.       I pass the mini strip-mall offices of Europe journal and orchid tours and eventually decide that number sixteen is the most legitimate candidate for the third building on the right. Number 16: on the right we have a glass door, a sheet of letter paper affixed to it. CENTRE NEY. On the left, a blue arched door and the words MIE DE PAIN.      Two men, one in his seventies, the other closer to forty, watch and whisper as I stare at the building -- there is nothing remarkable about it -- and then take a photograph. Next door is the CLUB OMNISPORTS. I am yet to decide whether this establishment officially forms part of the third building on the right.

      lots more about the twenty-tongued EU in the news today. from tomorrow, it's an amorphous beast. hurrah.  and there's a really interesting article about the translation of a Canadian book for kids, Mmmm cookies, into  Ojibwa . The rights were given for free, in order to try and help preserve the Ojibwa language. Apparently, when a language starts to die, one of the first things to go is children's literature... the article doesn't explain why, and i don't really understand why because you'd think that the orality of kid's stories would at least keep them alive a little longer than sweeping wuthering-heights style novels.  the canadians are doing quite a lot to try and keep this language alive, and have several immersion programs in which these books will be used.  i feel ashamed. i had never heard of obijwa until today.  also, i'm cutting and pasting the article because it's only available through lexis-nexis: The Leader-Post (Regina, Saskatchewan) April 30, 2004 Friday Final Edition   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ont. (CP) -- The Ojibwa translation of Robert Munsch's book Mmm Cookies -- or Mmm Pkwezhgaanhsak -- was launched with a "clang, clang, rattle-bing-bang" at Sault College of Applied Arts and Technology.   It's the first of three published and seven unpublished works by the children's author that the community college was given permission to translate at no cost.  Giving away the rights for the translation helps preserve a First Nations language, Munsch said this week as he helped get the book's launch underway.  Two of his books have already been published in Mohawk, but Munsch said it can be an uphill battle when children are surrounded by a "sea of English."  "When a language starts to die, one of the first things that dies are kids' stories, because people think they're trivial," Munsch said.  Students from Sault Ste. Marie's three school boards were invited to fill the gym as Munsch and retired Sault College aboriginal counsellor Barb Nolan read from the newly translated story in both English and Ojibwa.  The children went from listening raptly, as an animated Munsch told a few of his tales, to shouting along with the popular refrain from Mortimer, the Guelph-based writer's first story about a boy who refuses to go to sleep.  Josephine Pelletier, of Wikwemikong Unceded First Nation on Manitoulin Island, provided the translation for Mmm Pkwezhgaanhsak, and has already finished translations of two more books: We Share Everything and Andrew's Loose Tooth.  The translated books will be used for Sault College's new Ojibwa immersion program, and could be shipped out to other Ontario schools which run similar immersion programs.

      as many of you already know, this administration here in the US is pretty dumb. The trade embargo fiasco made me angry enough to write to the NY Times, but the amazing  urlLink circumference  magazine has gone one step further: "As many of you have heard, and according to Democracy Now!, The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control recently declared that American publishers cannot edit works authored in nations under trade embargoes which include Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Cuba. As editors of cirumference, a journal founded on principles of free and open exchange, we want to respond to this issue in the most direct way that we can. We would like to dedicate a substantial section of our second issue to poetry from these countries."   so go to the circumference website... and submit!

      For Italian speakers: Here is an article in l'Unita,  urlLink "Lo scrittore e la sua ombra" , which discusses the state of literary translation in Italy. It seems that Italians have many of the same issues and concerns as we in America do: translators are underpaid, undervalued; translators sometimes over domesticate foreign works, often because publishers encourage/force them to do so.  This article also brought my attention to some interesting new books about translation, in particular  urlLink  Di seconda mano. Né un saggio, né un racconto sul tradurre letteratura  , by Laura Bocci, a sort of hybrid work I am very eager to read.

      "Why say 'coffee break' instead of 'pausa caffe,'" he asked with a laugh, "when Italian coffee is so much better than English coffee?"   Exactly!!! This is the subject brought up in this article  urlLink Italy Struggles to Keep the Mother Tongue Pure , about the disturbingly strong influence of the English language on the Italian. Unlike, for example, in France, the Italian language police haven't been doing much to keep Italian Italian. Is there anything wrong with that? I am undecided.  It seems like a double edged sword- learning other languages is good, right? Perhaps it's different in cases like this because it's not about learning another language but rather having a foreign language take over your own. And especially English and its evermore encroaching hegemony. But I guess we translators are fighting the good fight by translating stuff into English, right?

      Irrational (or "feminine") Nouns in Arabic  "In the dialogue in Section 4, the man refers to the four languages the woman knows, using the separate pronoun (hiya), 'she,' which is singular feminine.  He asks (ma'a hiya?).  The reason for using (hiya) is that all nonrational (or non-human) nouns are usually referred to in the singular feminine regardless of gender.  That is, the plural noun (kootoob), which is masculine, is referred to by (hiya), (haada), and (tilaka), which are used to refer to singular feminine entities."  from _Ahlan wa Sahlan: Functional Modern Standard Arabic for Beginners_.   I wonder if it is the same in Hebrew-- is that why the monster was a "she" in Tamar's translation?

      Thanks for creating this blog and for the invitation to join. As a French translator living in Montreal, I am currently working on informing myself about the industry of literary translation in North America. I just found about the International Literary Market Place, a directory of all players in the US industry, including the subsidiary rights managers. Did you know about it? I haven't had a look at it yet, but I found that the latest edition is available at university libraries. This might be useful for information about translation rights for us literary translators... If anyone knows about  the equivalent for the Canadian industry, I could use the info, by the way.   Info about ILMP :  urlLink here . Have a wonderful day, Nicky, Jamie, Eric. I guess we will soon be too numerous for me to know the names!

       so maybe i'm just cynical, but whenever you have articles about machine translation  in the  urlLink  christian science monitor  experts saying (i.e.) ""Individual words are very ambiguous, but whole phrases, especially in a particular context of use, are not really ambiguous," then i understand that it is little wonder that we translators are so invisible. if we can be replaced by much cheaper (and less demanding, i'm sure) devices such as the Phraselator (TM). But then again, maybe not: "fully natural conversations - two-way translations - are "a very daunting problem," says Dr. Frederking of Carnegie Mellon. Even human translators aren't perfect at it," he adds."

       breakthrough literary translator self-publishes georges sand's  the black city , hitherto unavailable in english.     urlLink tina kover , a "young literary translator" has taken a brave step and self-published this george sand work with  urlLink  trafford , one of the companies that have started to do publishing on demand. The article says that "Since publishing resources for literary translations are limited, Kover took advantage of an innovative process in order to self-publish The Black City." is this a viable way forward for literary translation? is it the only way we're going to get more work from other languages across into blinkered english? or will it just serve to lower the status of literary translations, seeing as so many people still see 'vanity publishing' as just that, and nothing more.

She didn't want her own book to be translated badly, so she hired her own translator. It's called Funny in Farsi."

      I'm just testing. Not sure I've got all the technical side of this right. Nicky, there's no harm in plugging things shamelessly if you're a literary translator. No one else will do it for you. The more forums (or fora) there are for us poor starving garret-ridden literary translators to do a bit of self-publicity, the better. But I think that maybe literary translation into English is gradually being nudged into the limelight by various initiatives. A pity I didn't find your sex and death earlier, as I'm just translating excerpts from a novel involving just these matters.  Won't say much more now as I don't know whether this will work.

       ITALIAN  report: a brief summary of new Italian writing in English translation  If you are interested in Italian fiction, the two most important American presses to check out are  urlLink Italica Press  and  urlLink Steerforth Italia . Italica's most interesting recent publications are  After the War: A Collection of Short Fiction by Postwar Italian Women , which includes a wide span of work by women, since the collection gathers by age and not by genre; certainly it is a good taste of what Italian women have been writing in the last 25 years. Italica also has a new anthology called  Italian Environmental Literature: An Anthology , which mines the whole 20th century for prose, poetry, and essays by a wide range of writers. Penguin has, in the last year, published 4 novels by popular contemporary Sicilian writer Andrea Camilleri, who is worth checking out as well, although he writes of crime and occasionally the mafia, his prose is spare and lovely, and the translation is bound to be interesting as well, as the translator has had to deal with rendering the Sicilian dialect.

      "If a work does not compel us," [Fagles] said, quoting Yves Bonnefoy, the French poet and translator, "it is untranslatable.'' Dr. Fagles continued: "When Andromache in the Iliad laments the death of her husband, Hector, she foresees the future life of their son without a father. This moved me deeply. I lost my father when I was 14. The lines from Homer hit close to the bone."

      Quote from   urlLink The Atlantic  , June 2004. “ urlLink Offshoring the Audience " (note italics):  “Here, alas, is the virus laying waste to modern Hollywood movies. What do, say, the Batman and Matrix pictures have in common, besides banality? Just for openers, insipid, infrequent dialogue.  Why take the trouble to bang out good lines—supposing one can—if they'll only be mistranslated for their real target markets, abroad?  Both these movies could have been silents if they weren't so loud. They're overbearing, carelessly told, and gang-written into incomprehensibility. Small wonder they were tepidly welcomed in the United States. Americans at the movies are guilty of the same mistake in the early twenty-first century that grown-ups made at the movies in the 1980s: supposing that the pictures are made for them.”  Interesting, provocative logic; but I really don't think it is the reason for bad dialogue in movies. I mean, WHAT do you expect to see in a translation when the original is bad to begin with??? And there is always the possibility that the dialogue is SO BAD that no matter what the translator does, it's just going to sound BETTER. Anyway, just shows how we're unappreciated—Oh yeah, blame the translation!  (By the way, did anybody notice how gaunt and ghastly Tony Blair looked on that cover...though he has every right to look that way...i wonder how they got to use that picture...america's frail, tired, stressed out partner...definitely not good advertising...for washington, at least.)

      here's a thing. the us embassy's culture office in egypt brings seth gordon to town, to direct an arabic translation of wilder's  our town ... it's not 'egyptianized' (which apparently happens to most translations out there) and the writer of this article in  urlLink egypt today  is glad. she bemoans the egyptianization of translation, saying "It’s good for Egyptian audiences to really see a piece of foreign culture every once in a while, without a language barrier."  if only wilder's own culture could take a leaf out of the egyptian book...

      finally someone's actually concerned enough about the whole trade embargo/publishing fiasco to write an  urlLink opinion piece  about it. this is an issue which, of course, directly affects not only literary translators but publishers and editors as well. for a while there, it looked like we could be facing up to ten years in jail just for correcting a spelling mistake in a translation from farsi. sigh.  for those who might not know about this, here's a taster from the office of foreign assets control archives: "Activities such as the reordering of paragraphs and sentences, correction  of syntax, grammar, and replacement of inappropriate words by U.S. persons, prior to publication,  may result in a substantively altered or enhanced product, and is therefore prohibited."  Oh! and this one: "Despite Berman's 1988 amendment, which was intended to prevent such  use of authority, OFAC asserts its responsibility to regulate the publishing industry. "It's  illegal to provide a service for a sanctioned country," Millerwise says. "This isn't something  new that we just came up with."

        typically trashy right-leaning british broadsheet pays attention to translation  this is really quite impressive: a discussion of the finer points of several  urlLink translations of dante , with translators mentioned by name, in a mainstream, rather stodgy, british daily newspaper! the journalist concerned even writes that people have written in to him when he has previously lauded one translation over another. what's happened to the daily telegraph? to the good readers of old blighty? je ne comprends pas.

      This, apparently, is the work of the  Independent on Sunday 's poet in residence, Martin Newell. It's entitled  HELEN OF TROY - THE ESSEX TRANSLATION (AFTER HOMER) and it's really quite funny. But maybe only if you're from the isles...  And so after a week's run of plastering work in Sparta Priam's boy, Paris, got in a sesh with the guv, Menelaus And, with her consent, copped off with his bird, Helen. Well tasty. Long hair. Lovely face. Legs up to her neck.  They got a smash & grab back to his and ... say n'more. Menelaus's bruv, Agamemnon, got well humpty over this, It being considered that Paris may have had a rep'n'that But this was pissing in the Stella and calling it "tops". Agamemnon now had to get a crew up to get it sorted. Words were had about it in some of the livelier drinkers And some mushes who were a bit handy got on board. After a lot of giving it all that, they went on the mission. A fleet of Escorts. Tooled up. Everyone in good order. They was barely out of the motors before it kicked off But if the parking had been a nightmare, it was nothing Compared to the door policy at The Troy, mate. Even Achilles, their top boy, after nine years of it Seemed to be flagging. This weren't just a smart/casual. And The Troy was no wendy-house. Far from it, geezer. Hector, the head monkey on the door, was a right yahoo. Totally lost it and threatened to torch all their motors. Achilles said he definitely wasn't having any of that, Got stuck into the ruck and put Hector out of business. That put the Trojans off their nosebag, for starters, but Then Achilles went down. It looked like it was all over But they steamed The Troy anyway. Done the bouncers. Left the place torched. But not really a result. As such. Not if it took ten years. The trip home was bloody rubbish. Rowing among theirselves all the way. Weather was crap. And Helen? What can you say? Can't live with 'em ...

      CALL FOR PAPERS  Deadline: MAY 15TH  Institute for Social, Cultural and Policy Research, University of Salford and Department of Italian Studies, University of Reading with the support of the Italian Cultural Institute  Value and Visibility: Poetic Translations across Italy and Britain in the Twentieth Century  September 10 and 11, 2004 Institute of Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London  Papers are sought for this two-day conference. The conference will create a forum for scholarly debate on poetic translations in Italy and the UK during the Twentieth Century, and aims to help reshape current research trends within translation studies. Three topics have been identified for debate: 1) the politics of translation (high culture versus popular culture; commodification; mass education); 2) translation and the development of the literary language  (relationships between linguistic registers and social class and gender; the breakdown or the endorsement of the opposition between literary and everyday language); 3) links between translation and community (the role of the translator as the bridge between the foreign and the familiar; how translation defines historical, social, and literary periodisation; editorial policies and their relation to reading communities). The conference will unite leading specialists in English, Italian, and Comparative Literature and outstanding younger contributors on the subject. By bringing together international scholars in London and developing material for a published volume, this conference aims to encourage comparative research across departments of English and Modern Languages and stimulate interest in courses on translation studies.  Keynote Speakers:   George Steiner (Churchill College, University of Cambridge, UK)  Lawrence Venuti (Temple University, USA)  Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo (University of Padua, Italy)  Michael Schmidt (Carcanet Press; PN Review; Manchester Metropolitan University, UK)  Anna Dolfi (University of Florence, Italy)  Jeffrey Wainwright (Manchester Metropolitan University, UK)  Carla Locatelli (University of Trento, Italy)  Please send a 500 words abstract of your paper to d.caselli@salford.ac.uk and to d.lapenna@rdg.ac.uk BY MAY 15TH Conference Organisers: Dr. Daniela La Penna (Dept. of Italian Studies, University of Reading) and Dr. Daniela Caselli (School of English, Sociology, Politics and Contemporary History, Institute for Social  Cultural and Policy Research, University of Salford)  Conference Venue: Institute of Romance Studies, School of Advanced Studies, University of London Conference fees: £25 per day standard; £10 per day for members of the IRS and concessions (student, retired unemployed); £5 per day for graduate students in a department subscribing to the Institute of Romance Studies.

      here's an article in the  urlLink guardian  about flora drew's translation of ma jian's the noodle maker. it certainly gives more visibility to the translator than is usual, even mentioning the fact that she had no prior experience in literary translation. which is great, although i fear the journalist may just be mentioning her because she's his partner, or literary handmaiden as they'd have us believe. but maybe not. the really interesting thing is that she translates in parallel to his writing...

      It seems like the general public has a fairly underdeveloped understanding of translation. This was my initial impression of reading the article " urlLink After 25 yrs, translator still learns new things from each translation ", which was mentioned in another blog  urlLink The Elegant Variation . It was, in my opinion, a very simple, amateurish account of Toshiki Taguchi's experience of translating novels from English into Japanese. (He has translated some 150 novels and is known as a translator of books by Lawrence Block.) Of course, the article could have been "too easy" because it was a translation into English from the Japanese (which I suspect it is), or the writer had yet to grasp the subtleties of the English language (which I suspect is his or her second language). Still, it frustrates me that translation is only understood by and conveyed to readers in such oversimplifying and often ambiguous terms. And the sheer number of translations Toshiki Taguchi has published is also, in a way, misleading--it somehow implies that translating is "easier" than "writing." I mean, could anyone imagine a "serious" writer having already published 150 novels (with more to come)?

       st peter becomes rocky; mother of god now known as maggie; fornication ok with the man upstairs   This has to be my favourite bible translation yet. The  As Good As New  bible, translated by former baptist minister John Henson, has been approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who lauds it as "a vehicle for thinking and worshipping that is fully earthed."   Within its pages, we find nicknames galore: St Peter is Rocky; Mary Magdalene, Maggie and Barabas, Barry. A few choice excerpts are below; for more information go to the story at  urlLink WorldNetDaily . Let's go get dipped!   Matthew 26:69-70   Authorized version: "Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, 'Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.' But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."   New: "Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'"    1 Corinthians 7:8-7   KJV: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."   New: "If you know you have strong needs, get yourself a partner. Better than being frustrated."     Mark 1:4   Authorized version: "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."   New: "John, nicknamed 'The Dipper,' was 'The Voice.' He was in the desert, inviting people to be dipped, to show they were determined to change their ways and wanted to be forgiven."

      CALL FOR PAPERS   27th Annual ALTA Conference October 27-30, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada Session Organizer: Anna Barker   anna-barker@uiowa.edu  "The Word in Language is Half Someone Else's: Translator as the "Other" Author in Russian Literature."   As Mikhail Bakhtin pointed out in his Discourse and the Novel, "the word in language is half someone else's." No other field proves this to be the case more than the field of translation studies. Be it Ivan Turgenev, Constance Garnett, Boris Pasternak or Vladimir Nabokov, all of these translators became active contributors to the "afterlife" of the books they "exported" out of Russia or brought into the Russian literary environment. The re-creation of a literary text involves both a distantiation from the language and culture of the original and a simultaneous bridging of the two texts which occurs, according to Walter Benjamin, because of the essential "kinship" between languages. Does this kinship extend to the author and the translator? Does the author/translator relationship acquire a singular intensity in the Russian context? This session will focus on the role of the translator in the Russian literary tradition, both past and present. Papers on the reception and dissemination of Russian literature in the West are also welcome.

      MAN BOOKER INTERNATIONAL PRIZE  So the new owners of the Booker prize have announced another prize, one for international fiction, to be awarded every two years. it's a LOT of money, about $110,000, and guess what? not one penny goes to the translator. in fact, in the company's  urlLink press release  translation is not mentioned at all -- and i quote: "Worth £60,000 to the winner, the prize will be awarded once every two years to a living author who has published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in translation in the English language. " and again, "The Man Booker International Prize is unique in the world of literature in that it can be won by an author of any nationality, providing that his or her work is available in the English language." there's a  urlLink story  about the prize in today's guardian... but once again, no mention of how these works might get into the english language in the first place!

      From the Letters page of the Guardian's Saturday Review:  Translators' trials  (Dec 13, 2003)  Dear Sir,  As a fellow "ambulance driver" I should like to reinforce what Michael Hofmann said about the common perception of literary translation ("Speaking in tongues", November 22). As he correctly argues, the mysterious aura which lingers around translation is a mask for breathtaking ignorance. Furthermore, the literary translator is well aware that any personal input will go largely unnoticed by the reading public. Translation is viewed as a secondary occupation, a halfway house to real creative writing and its practitioners are viewed as little more than obscure solitary craftsman beavering away like those wood beetles which one hears but never sees until they drop out dead on the carpet.

      It's interesting what happens to political biographies in translation. I remember something about Hilary Rodham's having passages deleted and such- specifically, passages that were critical of the Chinese government. But I just came across  urlLink this article  on how Clinton's  My Life  is being received around the world. The most interesting tidbit being:  "The Times of London reported this week that a Mandarin translation of 'My Life' on sale in China included several passages that were not in English-language editions, including statements in which Mr. Clinton tells of his appreciation of Mao Zedong.  The changes start in the first sentence of the book, which in the Chinese version says that the town of Hope, Ark., where Mr. Clinton was born, has 'good feng shui.' "

      Here's a review of the new Italian novel by Giuseppe Genna, translated by Ann Goldstein, in the Guardian-   urlLink In the Name of Ishmael . It's a crime novel- predictably- but is of great historical and stylistic merit.   "In the Name of Ishmael is a sophisticated, cinematic thriller in the manner of Rosi, cross-cutting confidently between two Milan-based investigations 40 years apart, linked to "an occult, tentacular power", a secret religious organisation led by the mysterious, unseen Ishmael. Genna is smart enough to know conspiracies per se aren't interesting because the truth is always disappointing. What counts is the driven nature of the investigator and the accompanying landscape of paranoia, in this case a chilly, inhospitable Europe, in which weather and architecture play as important a part as the crimes"- where "Milan exists on the edge of poetic hallucination."

      INDIA AND ITALY SIGN CULTURAL AGREEMENT.  According to the  urlLink Deepika Global  newsite for "global Indians," Italy and India today signed an agreement to strengthen cultural interchange between the two countries. Obviously, literary translation will play a major role in the implementation of such an agreement, which also envisages an exchange of knowledge in the fields of education, the arts, and architecture.  Hmmm. Anyone know if the US happens to have signed anything like this of late? Or the UK? Except with each other of course?

      Our very interesting new friend Derik Badman at  urlLink madinkbeard  has brought an essay by Harry Mathews to our attention. Entitled  urlLink "Translation and the OuLiPo: The Case of the Persevering Maltese" , it comes from his Mathews' book  The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collected Essays , published in 2003 by Dalkey Archive. The essay -- hell, why not, the book -- looks really interesting too... Thanks Derik!

      the current  world literature today  features an article by ANUSHIYA SIVANARAYANAN on translating  urlLink tamil dalit poetry  into english, with some of her translations of n t rajkumar. apparently (and forgive me if i'm insulting anyone's intelligence by repeating this) "dalit" is the word that collectively describes the 'untouchable castes' of india. it's a great piece.

      An unlikely, and most welcome, surprise for those who are fans of both nose flutes and long place names.  The longest place name in the world is the Maori appellation for a hill in New Zealand,  which is just 305 meters high but has 85 letters in its name.  Details on other long words in the English language, as well as the translation of the aforementioned Maori place name (which tells the romantic tale of a lover and his nose flute), are available  urlLink here.
