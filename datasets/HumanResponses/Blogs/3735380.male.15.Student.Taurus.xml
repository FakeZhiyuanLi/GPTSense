      "Michael, vacuum the carpet." "Michael, fix the remote." "Michael, clean the rat cages." "Michael, sweep the driveway." "Michael, do the dishes." "Michael, take the dog for a walk"  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! This is crazy. You can't expect me to do everything. It's summer. Time to relax. Imperative sentences are supposed to be gone, along with school.  I already have a job. I get paid. It's not my fault that I requested hours and didn't get any.  And what am I getting paid for these chores? $0.00 a year.  That 's gonna buy me a car. When I did a cruddy job on sweeping the driveway, I yelled back to my dad, "You get what you pay for", and that got him. I still had to sweep the rest anyway.  "But it's simple." Then do it yourself.  All I ever wanted to do today was sit and play Golden Sun on my GameBoy. I managed to play about 4 hours of it, and 1 hour of reattempting failed sidequests. But that was for the entire time of today. The other 5 hours I was forced to do something else.  It was a long morning too. My brother yanked the covers off me to wake me up at 11:00. That got me in a great mood to beat him up this morning.  Basically, I was ticked the entire day. In the game, I was stuck against Saturos on the Mercury Lighthouse aerie. That's when the batteries ran out.  So what happened that actually went right today? Let's recap for a minute. 1. I'm still alive.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Let's wait and see.

      Day two of the demolition. I don't know why they do that in the morning instead of the afternoon. Today I woke up at about 12:00 with them crushing what was already knocked down.  The morning—err, you know what I mean—was a drag.  Then my mom practically forced me to sit in the sun for 10 minutes. I guess I should have told her about photons (my second last blog). Anyway, I got a very light tan, hardly noticable., nothing big.  The rest of the afternoon was a drag.  Next thing we did, my brother's 8-year-old friends were going to see the movie "Dodgeball". Like that would teach them any life lessons. Note my sarcasm.  Anyway, after a phone call, I gave in. My mom threatened it was either Dodgeball or Two Brothers. I completely gave in and said Dodgeball. They won't follow the movie anyway. All they enjoy is throwing popcorn in people's hair.  Throwing popcorn? I meant flicking popcorn, and I was the main target, until I sat behind them. Great movie. Three stars, and that's actually good, because I've only twice given a four star rating. Pirates of the Carribean and Spiderman I.  Anyway, we went to my brother's friends house. They played dodgeball. Typical after a movie like that. I chased the dog when she jumped out of the car. At least I got some exercise.  After all that, I finally came home and wrote this blog. My parents are still trying to make me read my summer books. I say not until July. But they always find a way.

      Today my sleep was ended abruptly by the deconstruction site across the street.  The owner of the house died last August. It's been due for demolition for a while now.  But 7:00? Some people are sleeping! It's summer. That's what we're supposed to do during summer break: sit in a chair for 12 straight hours and sleep for 12 straight hours. It's life.  I woke up and watched the demolition anyway. I even felt sonic vibrations like an earthquake at one point.  When the house went down, I went straight to sleep. That didn't last long.  At 9:30 I had to wake up for an orthodontist appointment. I broke four brackets on my braces and needed them fixed. 9:30am? Why not 2:30pm when I'm awake?  So much time, so little sleep.

      There is usually something abnormal about every week at work. This is the third time this week something weird happened. That is rare.  My mom is really beginning to complain that I'm not tan enough. "You need dark skin to attract ladies.", "You look anemic.", "A tan would get you some popularity, or a girlfriend.", or my favorite: "When we go on our vacation, you're going to get real bad sunburn."  Who needs that? My skin is perfect as a slightly pale white. I don't need a tan. I'm one of those people who look bad with one. I'm just a regular pale-skinned friendly person. Maybe a little gold would work, but mainly I look perfectly normal with this skin color.  Usually we're dead on Sundays. Until about 5:30, we were. People then came in waves of about 5 separate groups each. Probably a baseball game across the street.  Near the end of the day, about 6:30, this group of 6 girls came in. They seemed a little nervous about me. They bought food and sat down.  15 minutes later, my supervisor let me take the night off. 15 minutes early isn't much, but it's enough time to eat my meal, and I was thankful for that. I clocked out and sat down next to and facing the side door, as I always do.  I finished my food, fries, and the group of girls passed me. They said "Hey, sexy!" and giggled. I almost jumped.  So much for my mom's advice. Look what a tan would  lose  me. I guess my skin color is fine with what I had now.  It's not time to get my ego all flared up because of that, but it really is an interesting situation. Maybe I don't need a tan. Maybe they're just joking.  Whatever it was, it sure was surprising.

      So unfortunate events can lead to a major freakout? Let's hear it. Saturdays have lots of bad juju. Care to let me explain? It's a really verbose explanation. Read it only if you have time on your hands.  Two weeks before this Saturday, I was playing a video game on my computer, which took up the whole screen. No clocks in sight. I was truly addicted to Descent Freespace II.  The only problem is that I didn't know what time it was.  And  I had to work the 3-7 shift.  You can guess. I finally finished a mission, took a look at the clock about 10 feet away. This is the main reason I put the clock next to my computer. It showed 3:16. I threw on my uniform and yelled at my parents for not getting me off the computer in time.  I got there at 3:45. Apparently my parents need to look nice when I'm late. Screw that. I got to work and, well, it almost got me fired.  ~  One week before today, I woke up at 1:40. I remembered what happened last week, so I put on my McDonald's uniform to remind me. The clock was put next to my computer, so I'm not addicted to any games such that I can't see the time.  I played Descent Freespace II again. Great game. I looked at the clock. 2:30. I got off the game, and looked around. No parents. Not a trace. They were at my brother's little league game.  There was a lot of calling during this week. Hang on while I explain.  I waited. 2:45. I started pacing back and forth. I took some sticks of spaghetti and started munching on them, one by one.  2:55 and no sign of anybody. This is going to screw me over. I cursed under my breath, and waited longer. I found a slip of paper. Thank God. It was my parent's cell-phone numbers. I quickly dialed the numbers.  I tried first with my dad's number. No answer. He turned his off. I had one more chance.  I dialed my mom's number. Soon after, I heard a noise on the counter while I had the phone in my hands. I hung up to find out what it was. I didn't see it. It was probably a mouse.  I dialed again. I heard the noise when the ringtone went off on the phone. I searched and found it. It was my mom's cell phone. She left it home.  Okay, this would get me fired for sure. It was already 3:15 and I was due to work the 3-7 shift again. This is not working out.  I took the entire box of spaghetti and started eating the pieces one by one, like a nervous serial killer. It was 3:30. I had already finished half the box when the phone rang. I jumped, hoping to God that it was my parents.  It wasn't. It was my boss. She wanted to know why I wasn't there. I explained that I had no method of transportation. She understood. Thank God for that.  Fifteen minutes later, 3:45, I ate the box of spaghetti at twice the speed. Where were they? What the heck is wrong with them? If I wanted to get to work, I had to walk. Real creative. Two miles. My bike was broke, so I couldn't take that. I could take my brother's bike, but it was way too small.  3:55 already. I turned to the news. I opened another box and started munching. If my parents got home in time, I'd owe them an explanation, but by the looks of it, they owed me a bigger one.  4:05 and the car came through the drive through. Lucky me, to be an hour late for work. I started yelling when I got into the car. This was the second week in a row. The hour late got me on  really  close watch with the management. If I was late again, it was my job. Nobody told me that, but it was in the handbook.  ~  This week was actually more in control. Saturday. Finally a chance to get to work  early . I woke up at 11:00 with my mom flushing the toilet in my room. I yelled at her to fix it, because it had an inner leak that kept it running and running, and she didn't know how. I turned off the lights in my room. Hardly noticed it was on. I told my mom to not forget that I had work today. She left for my brother's game.  Okay, the next few things happened exactly like last week. I tried calling. No answer. At 2:57 my mom came home today. Speeded my way to work, which I thought would kill us all. I got there, but I wasn't on time.  One minute late. Could that get me fired? I stood there with a pale face for at least 20 minutes.  Luckily, no managers came by and fired me. I was still alive. I still had my job.  When I clocked out, I looked at the paper. 15:01 - 18:25. At least I walked out with that slip. I still have my job. I still have my meal. Everything was okay.  I sat down and ate my food with relief. I called my parents up to take me home. They agreed. Some guy sat across from me. It scared me when he tried to converse with me. Maybe he was lonely. Maybe he wanted my food. Maybe he was a—no, not today. I picked up my food and said I was going to check the time.  Checking the time took 20 minutes. Why weren't my parents here? I nervously stood there facing the door, out of sight from him.  What was wrong? Does it always take this long for my parents to pick me up?  My supervisor is really starting to worry about me leaving late at 7:30, when I get off at 7. Repeatedly. My parents either don't have their cell phones on or leave them at home. My supervisor is really becoming wary about that.  My parents seriously need a built in clock for their brains. Even that might not help. Finally, at 7:10, I took up my stuff and finally left. The happiest face I wore since I got my job there.

      Yesterday was a tough day at work. I had to work the fries, and that's not the easiest job. Trust me. I'll explain.  First of all, my manager told me to remember to put the fries on the fry-rack from left to right, so that the runners for the drivethrough would pick them up left to right.  Simple? Not really. I had to mentally calculate every the rate of consumption of fries, and put a fry in the tub to cook if they were getting low. And who says working at McDonald's isn't mentally exhausting?  Finally, for the last 30 minutes I had to work at the first window. Collect change. That's all there is to it. A horribly simple job they call "the hole"; literally a hole in the wall.  Finally the day was over, and I was off 30 minutes early. That's 2 hours and 30 minutes of work. On the dot. I collected my meal and left with my paycheck.  I waited in the car to open it. I thought for a minute that I didn't have enough hours.  I opened the check. Sixty-four dollars? Usually I make about 75 a week. This is 10 dollars below. Well, I guess it's not that bad. More than I ever got for a birthday. And I get paid every two weeks, so that's pretty good too.  Okay, not so bad for a paycheck.

      Okay, first of all, this is a total rip off from Fahrenheit 451. I'm surprised the author of that book isn't suing this jerk for ripping off his title.  Okay, so this flake Democrat wrote a movie about what happened before and after 9/11. I'll tell you what happened.  Let's see. First of all, the terrorists threatened to destroy the twin towers before 9/11. Did we believe them? No. I'll tell you why.  First of all, they didn't succeed the first time. The bombing didn't even  shake  the tower and it stayed almost fully intact.  Also, the building was designed to resist a smaller size airplane, just in case. The architect was some freaking genius.  Okay, the threat. That's like me saying I'm going to destroy the world. So arrest me. I have a freaking bomb planted in the Earth's core and I'm gonna blow you all to hell!  See how stupid that sounds? But it's possible. We don't know for sure if it's going to work, but it's possible. More unlikely than likely.  Okay, secondly, this Michael Moore should rot in hell for saying Bush is not doing anything about it. He sent troops to Iraq to stop a dictator who could potentially end up like Hitler. He sent troops to Afghanistan to take down a ringleader with power that could potentially end the world with terror. He has personally walked over to the houses of deceased American soldiers and comforted their families. Now this guy's telling me that Bush isn't doing anything? What a load of crap!  American soldiers are dying in Iraq. That's less than we had for any war. In fact, that's about 1/1000 the amount we lost in any war. Now this guy is complaining that 500 soldiers died in Iraq.  Well look at it this way, jerk: If those 500 people didn't die in Iraq, then that would be replaced with 50,000 more deaths, mostly victimizing the innocent Iraqis. If he came to so much power as to be able to rule all of the middle east, like Hitler started taking over Europe, then it could potentially be 50,000,000 soldiers dying. This is the safest way out. If that idiot thinks we're losing too many soldiers, then let's see what would have happened if Bush never sent them in the first place. Let's see how much money Hussein funds to terrorism. Let's see how many innocent lives he kills. Look back and see, Moore, all the things that could have happened.  Also, I'm sick of people who call Bush a dictator. He's not a dictator. He's a president. Just because someone you didn't vote for comes to power, doesn't mean he takes control of your life. He's trying to help America. More people wanted him in power than you did, so that makes you a flake.

      You know what I hate the most at my job at McDonalds?  Customers who insult your comany right when they're buying food. You can't do anything about it, and you have to serve them.  What are they expecting? Some long laugh? A friend? A punch in the face?  I'd punch the face if I wasn't on duty. But this guy came up to the counter and made a really offensive comment to the company.  The thing that ticks me off the most is that he did it knowing he couldn't get hurt.  What's his problem? How come he doesn't have any friends to tell this to instead?  McDonald's doesn't serve crappy food. I've told many friends this. I even explained that we have a ton of food safety awards. Yet some people are idiotic enough to watch the news and not look on the positive side of things.  You wanna know what that makes those customers?  Cowards with money.

      Last night I fell asleep at 7:00pm. I usually never do that.  I feel like I want to kill my little brother now. When I was asleep on the couch, he woke me up at 10pm blasting the music on MTV in the room I was in. Lucky that got him grounded.  Sleep is sacred in our family. If anyone wakes another person up, and they complain, it's an automatic grounding.  Anyway, I walked up to my bed and laid down 5 minutes later at 10:05. I fell right asleep.  I woke up after a weird dream at 6am. What the heck? I never wake up at that time. Ever. I tried going back to sleep and that strangely continued my dream until I woke up at 11am.  Okay, that's more normal. But now I've slept for  sixteen hours ?!  Strange thing is that I'm still tired. I just woke up anyway. So that might be the case. Sixteen hours of sleep? That's weird. I'll see if I get too much sleep again tonight.  Sixteen hours. Usually I get about 8-9 hours and one of my brothers wake me up to play on the computer, which is in my room.  I don't know how I slept for sixteen hours, but it was a waste of my day.

      Okay, I don't think you have to look at more than 5 posts that I made today to see that I'm already obsessed with blogging.  This thing is truly addictive. It lets me be creative and at the same time, helps me get my ideas, thoughts, impressions, and feelings out to the world.  Blogging is truly addictive. However, I don't know what to write about now. I already finished all the topics.  Oh well, I'll come up with something. Maybe I'll come up with something at work.

      The RIAA has been milking money out of customers and downloaders for over half a year now. Can you believe it?  But is it really the RIAA who is being cheated, or is it us?  Look at it this way. It takes at most $1 to stamp a CD, with its plastic case. To put the paper catalogs and stuff, it should be about $1 extra. The total comes to $2, or at most $3 per CD. So why are we paying $20 per cd? They should at most charge about $5 per CD.  Or at least they would. If they had a major competitor.  Their unreasonable pricetags like $19.95 or whatever is completely insane. First they charge 3 hours of earnings on your paycheck, then they start suing people.  Here's the situation. The RIAA has no major competitor. They can raise their prices to about $25 or $30 if they wanted to.  This is why you see McDonalds next to Burger King. Walmart across the street from K-Mart. The BP station about 10 feet away from the Shell station. Capitalism is a world of competition. The rule is to sell the best goods at the lowest prices.  The RIAA does not follow that rule. Instead, they have tiny similar companies that are almost bankrupt that are competing against them. In fact, they can even sue without losing customers, because the customers have nowhere else to buy music from.  The situation is that unless someone steps up to compete, things are going to get worse.  Leave your comments. I dare you.

      Today I didn't wake up. I was asleep all day.  Strange thing is that it was random parts of the day.  When I was watching a chess game at chess club today, I felt really drowsy and almost fell onto the board.  When I came on the computer screen I felt a tiny bit drowsy.  When I was drinking milk out of the carton, I almost fell down and slept on the floor in the kitchen. Weird. Luckily no milk was spilled.  The last time I did that recently was when I was watching TV. I felt extremely tired and would've fallen asleep if the vacuum wasn't turned on.  Weird, huh? And the most recent 3 happened within an hour.  I guess that's because I had to get up at 7:30  Note to self: Never ever ever wake up earlier than you can take. Note to self: Add 6 hours and 30 minutes to sleep time.

      Chess club wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, it was almost routine.  I played the guy in charge, and he beat me, as usual.  Then I played two other guys, and I beat them. Typical.  Well, I feel kinda tired playing chess for an hour.  I'm gonna take a rest for a minute or two.

      Javascript? Not everyone knows the valuable javascript. Most people use it to sell stuff on their sites, like the deliver button on amazon.com or whatever.  I do nothing of the sort. I make mathematical programs.  Basically, they're different from regular programs, but who cares.  I used to program TIs. They were way too slow. Now I just use Javascript. The codes are alike, and it's a lot faster.  Since I like the number pi a lot, that's my first number to experiment with on the coordinate plane here.  I made a program called  urlLink Pi Finder!  that uses an RNG to find pi.  Kinda cool?

      Okay guys, you asked for it. Now I'm giving it to you. It's like waiting in a slow food restaurant, or waiting at a line in Wendy's. You say what you want, then you must wait for a while.  Keep in mind that I do have a life. I just chose to spend it here for now.  All you dorks be well advised that this is not a book. It's a video game.  Thanks for waiting guys. Here it is:  -----------------------------    Golden Sun: Book One    You wake up as Isaac (or whoever you named your character). There is a storm in your hometown, Vale. Your mother, Dora, wakes you up, and tells you the great boulder from Mt. Aelph is about to fall. She lets you on your own telling you to seek the pavilion.  Four town adepts (or weilders of psynergy) are holding up the boulder with psychic powers.  Once you get to the pavilion, your friend, Jenna, asks you to help her find someone with psynergy (or  psy chic e nergy ) to get Felix (Latin word for Lucky or Happy, but this guy's mostly unlucky right now. He's Jenna's brother) who is trapped in the river, hanging onto a pole with his life.  You find an adept who is ready to save Felix. When you finally take them to the river, it's too late.  The boulder falls and Felix is swept away. No more Felix. Jenna's brother, and her parents who were attempting to help Felix, are dead. Your father, also in the attempt to save Felix, is dead too. Four people dead in one day; not good.  You go east, because there's no other way out of that area, and two people are talking. A mystery man and woman appear, and they seem to have extraordinary power. They are evil adepts, who used their power to break inside the Sol Sanctum (the large house of worship next to your hometown) and accidentally caused a trap to summon the storm, since they were looking for the source of all alchemy.  They spot you and accuse you of eavesdropping. They knock you out.  Three years later...  You're helping fix the roof of Dora's house, and Jenna and your other friend, Garet, are talking about the incident 3 years back.  You are going to Professor Kraden's house. The old man who lives across the bridge. You plan to sneak into the Sol Sanctum and basically do the same thing as the Mystery people did. But the Mystery people are lurking behind you, little do you know.  You wander around the Sol Sanctum, and you find a secret room with four precious gems (or stars). These gems contain the purest essence of alchemy.  The Mercury Star - Water The Venus Star - Earth The Mars Star - Fire The Jupiter Star - Wind  You're sent out to get these and you get 3 of the 4 when, uh-oh, the mystery people come. They reveal themselves as Saturos and Menardi. And they have someone in charge of them: Alex. They bring in a prisoner mystery man. They also bring along a prisoner. They take 3 of the 4 and make you get the last star for them.  As soon as you pull the last star, the water drains, and a rock shaped eye floats, and Mt. Aelph is about to erupt. Alex and the others take Kraden and Jenna, along with none other than Felix, whom they saved from the storm three years ago.  You get out of the sanctum, because the floating eye, The Wise One, teleports you out of there. You tell your story to the town elders and take your quest to retrieve the four gems, before the lighthouses are lit by them.  You leave town, do all these quests, and go north to meet Ivan, a wind adept. He joins your group, you go further north, and you reach a town called Imil. There you meet Mia, a water adept. So now you have one adept of each.  You are too late to stop Saturos from lighting the lighthouse, so you defeat him there, and Alex revives him, saying that the lighthouse was to blame, because water puts out fire.  You travel south, where you meet Master Hamma. She teaches you a couple psynergy tricks. You go further south, to a town called Lalivero, where you find out a girl named Sheba was kidnapped by Alex and the others.  Then you travel further south, where an old man named Babi, who has lived 150 years, needs draught from Lemuria. He gives you his boat under the condition that you find the continent for him. He says that if you're not quick enough, he will die.  You travel to the top of the Venus Lighthouse, and you meet them  before  they light it this time. You defeat both, and they drop the star into the lighthouse. They change into a dragon because earth is fire's strength, and you battle a two-headed dragon.  You beat the dragon, and Sheba falls off the lighthouse. Felix jumps to save her, and a wave safely carries them to a peninsula.  And you're sent west on a boat to look for the lost continent of Lemuria.   End Book One   -----------------------------    Golden Sun: Book Two    First you started off as Isaac, now you start off as Felix. You're on a floating peninsula, and it gets knocked into a continent by a tidal wave. All the boats in that supercontinent are destroyed.  With Felix, your mission is to light the lighthouses. The exact opposite of what you had to do in the first book. But pretty soon you see his point of view.  You travel around looking for a boat, but every single one is destroyed by the tidal wave.  Alright, this is where things get annoying. You see a boat, but you don't know how to ride it, and it won't run anyway.  You find a man named Piers who will lend you a boat if you get him out of jail. He actually is innocent anyway, and they let him go before you get back.  He goes into a tribal area, because they stole his black orb, thethingy that makes his boat go. He joins your group.  So you basically do that stuff and get the black orb and ride around. You search the pieces of the trident, and you have to do that in the three towers to the gods. Anyway, you get to the top of the towers and get the trident pieces, get them welded together, and go to the center of the Eastern Sea: Lemuria. Of course, after defeating Poseidon with the trident.  It really lets you down. All that work getting there, and the people are too lazy for even time to move, and Parliament is too conservative to let anything happen. The king lets you leave Lemuria, and you're off to the Western sea.  You find a town called Contigo. You travel around and find out Master Hamma is there. You go north to light the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You meet up with the gang from Book One. They're caught in Karst and Agatio's trap. Karst and Agatio are basically recruits who replaced Saturos and Menardi, only they're stronger.  They call you betrayers, you beat them up, and they drop the star in, and steal the last star and go north, to their hometown: Prox. Isaac and friends join your team. You have 8 people now: 2 adepts of each element.  Once you get down from the Jupiter Lighthouse, Ivan learns that Master Hamma is his sister. Short story there, not worth talking about.  Okay, you go north, and get on top of the Mars Lighthouse Aerie, (after taking the star back from Karst and Agatio). Now the Wise One meets you up there. He calls you betrayers too. I guess you can't do anything right.  He sends in a three headed dragon, and you beat it.  It dies, and the three heads turn into three adepts: Jenna's parents and Isaac's dad. They are on the brink of death.  You throw the star in, and it lights the last lighthouse. You've done it. You beat the game.  All the families are reunited and you live hapily ever after.  You see a cutscene of Alex climbing Mt. Aelph to harvest the power from the beams of the lighthouses, and he is bound to the mountain by the Wise One, and the mountain sinks into the earth.  Alex is dead...Or is he?   End Book Two

      Ever hear about that book?  I bet not. You might have had to read it for summer. You might have read it before. Some of you haven't, so I'll get to the point: It's about bio-terror.  What freaks me out is that I have a flu, while I'm reading this book about bio-terror. It adds to the effect of the scare, but I don't think it's mentally healthy.  It's kinda like reading The Tell Tale Heart with your dad hammering something. Freaky, because you have sound effects.  Right now, I'll need to delay that book until I regain my health. Until then, I'll just try to enjoy the popcorn, chips, and tylenol I get from sitting in front of the computer for the rest of the week.

      You may have heard of this really interesting bug called the May Fly. It only lives 24 hours, and dies.  But did you ever think about the effect it has on the people who live in that area? Have you ever thought of them as annoying or gross?  Today they invaded Cleveland. I live there.  Let me tell you something. May flies come by here every six months. However, since they die in 24 hours, their reproduction rate is faster than you can imagine. Within seconds, they cover the streets, houses, windows, sidewalks, bikes, cars, and street lights. You name it, they sit on it.  Then they die.  They don't move now. The wind doesn't blow them, because of the sticky secretion on their feet. The sun doesn't dry them up.  You just walk on them, step on them, and live with bug guts for at least a week.  What's so interesting about the may fly?  It leaves a nice crunch when you step on it. In all the places that they are.  Per square foot.

      What's the big idea? I'll tell you the big idea.  Spam. Spam mail. Junk mail. Bulk mail.  Whatever your ISP calls it, it needs a lid.  Did you know that at least 10% of junk mail is pornographic, while the rest is mortages and ads? Well now you know. So what happens when an unsuspecting minor (age under 18) opens one of those pornographic ads? Nobody sues the company? Nobody even bothers threatening a freaking lawsuit on "the blue pill", when that's a legitimate case for a lawsuit?!? That's surprising.  Every day there are more than 10 billion spam mails per day. The number is growing. Why doesn't someone take care of this? Are ISPs really idiotic thinking they can create a box for spam, instead of making a simple test to answer? A test! That's it!  There have been service sign-up techniques that make positive you're not a robot. These tests are incorrect at a rate of 0% during its entire existence. That's 100% accuracy right there. What is it? It's a messy image text test. Yup! You heard me. A messy image text test. The simplest test in the world. The best part is that it takes less than 5 seconds. Below is an example.        Messy images, huh? Why not implant them into e-mails so you're not spammed to death? It's really fun to sit back, look at the world, and laugh. Why didn't they think of this in the first place?  I'll tell you something. Humans are not the smartest creatures. They will need to hand-sort the e-mail before they come to the messy image test, that for so long has been hidden in the depths of "Get me on the e-mail send page".  I guess we'll just have to live with it until some ISP discovers this.

      This one is not meant to entertain you. This is real. I found this from lots and lots of facts. Do a  urlLink google  on these two. That might serve as proof.  -----------------------------   Part I   The Mayans were a celestially based civilization established before their end. Before they were conquered, they had created such precise measurements of eclipses and other celestial events that, even today, they are only thirty-three seconds off.  The Mayans predicted the world will end on December 23rd, 2012.  Their celestial measurements were only 33 seconds off. Will this one be also?  -----------------------------   Part II   About two millenii (Latin plural for millenium) ago, the bible was completed.  A Jewish rabbi discovered that if you took every other 50 letters in the Torah, it would spell out the word "Torah".  Years ago, Isaac Newton's roommate discovered the bible and hundreds of notes on Newtons desk. When asked, Newton said that the bible may be the key to unlocking the future. He was right.  Later on, today, scientists and mathematicians have input the bible into computers. The mathematicians were startled when they discovered that the bible is not only a collection of stories, but it's also can be input into a computer program too.  Scientists have already discovered the Even Spacing Generator, meaning it takes every Xth letter for Y amount of times. They discovered that the bible is also like a crossword puzzle.  At the end of the world, the Bible Code predicted there will be six years of oppression, starting 2006, followed by the end of the world by nuclear war on December 2012.

      If anyone has ever beaten that game, you might know how I feel.  Nostalgic, and really into the spirit of that game. In fact, my profile pic is just that; including the one on  urlLink Chess-Live   Anyways, I'm thinking about starting all over again.    What's weird about that game, you ask?  I'll tell you what's weird: there's gotta be a sequel. There are so many questions unanswered that I'm baffled. Here's what I could come up with in a 10 minute time frame:  What happens to the villagers? What's the thing with Garet's arm at the end? He said he felt something but it wasn't really anything. Maybe we'll find out IN THE SEQUEL *nudges Camelot and Nintendo* Why does the Wise One say "Maybe we'll meet again some day" to the doomed Alex? Why does the Wise One send in the three-headed dragon that is actually Isaac's kidnapped dad and Jenna's kidnapped parents? What happens to Alex? What happens to the ship Isaac got from Lalivero? What was the Wise One's true intentions? He says "You have learned too much" and tries to kill Isaac and friends. Why is the top of Mt. Aelph still sticking above ground if it's supposed to have the doomed Alex bound to the top and have it sinking? If the Wise One can't interfere with the actions of mankind, then why does he bind Alex to the peak of Mt. Aelph? If the Wise One can't interfere with the actions of mankind, then why does he send a three-headed dragon to the aerie of the Mars Lighthouse?  Well, I guess that can all be explained in the sequel. "Golden Sun: Return of Alex" or something.  That game is awesome. I'll see if I can come up with an explanation for you guys within the next couple of days.

      Today I will explain something very dangerous to human beings. Photon radiation.  Photons are malignant particles that can be found anywhere. On your computer screen, outside, your alarm clock, the sun, and even the computer screen you look at.  Photons travel at speeds up to 300,000 kilometers per second. They are invisible to the naked eye.  Unfortunately, that's just the facts. Photons have killed and can kill many.  The largest concentration of photons happens outside during the daytime. This is the biggest place for a photonic accident. Next in line comes indoors at day, indoors at night, and outdoors at night.  Urban areas are infested with photons, while rural and suburban areas experience them in the daytime.  Some common sources of photons are your computer screen, televisions, the sun, digital alarm clocks, street lights, stoplights, lamps, fire, lightbulbs, cameras, and more. In the digital age, it's impossible to escape all these sources, but it is possible to expose yourself to as little as possible.  Doctors are warning patiens that intense photons from the sun can cause sunburn, or even skin cancer in most cases. Photons can dry up water and drain the crucial nutrient from our lakes, rivers, and your own bathtub, leaving millions of people dying in droughts.  In an intense ray, photons can cause eye problems, even blindness in rare cases. Studies show that people whose eyes are exposed to too many photons can get eye disorders.  Photons are virtually unstoppable. They are, right now, bouncing off your hands, feet, face, and your little brother.  Here are some ways to avoid this menace: 1. You must stay inside at all times, being wary when going outside. The best time to go outside is when it's raining. The majority of photons are being blocked by the clouds. 2. Don't use a flash camera. Those give off dangerous photonic radiation. Instead, turn the flash off. 3. Stay away from fire. 4. Turn off the computer and T.V. when you go to bed, or at least turn down the brightness. 5. Make sure the lights are off during the daytime, and read your book with the dimmest light possible. 6. Keep all water sources away from photonic radiation. 7. Cover up the front part of your digital clock with black tape when you're not using it. 8. ALWAYS wear sunglasses when driving. 9. Do not go to tanning salons. The photonic radiation from the ultraviolet waves can cause skin cancer. 10. Wear protective clothing when going into the sunlight. If the sun gets too bright, hide under a tree or a desk. Always bring an umbrella.

      First thing... before I actually let you in on it, you'll have to read about my daily life.  I got to work an hour early by mistake, then left an hour early. Then I started weightlifting until my muscles burned. First weightlifting day. That's about it.  See? That wasn't so hard!  Now back to the All Your Base.  For those who don't know what this already is, I'll refer you to this link:  urlLink All Your Base   Okay, now I totally ripped off the stuff and made an action/drama comic. Don't expect anything too funny, except the poor English that I mocked. The first 6 slides will show you the story, the ones after that are the ones I made.  Okay, click  urlLink here  to see it. Read-only password: 123456789  SPECIAL NOTE: You must click the link, type the password, and then close the window and click the link again.  More comics coming soon!

      Okay, in a couple days I'm going to see my girlfriend's play! War on Kerry is in part II.  Part I: Rough birthday.  A rough time for my brother. I almost felt sorry for him. But I didn't. Here's the story.  My brother's birthday was today. I'm lucky he didn't bug me all day. You know how birthday-boys are.  Anyway I overheard a conversation when I was getting a snack in between editing images. My brother wanted to play Monopoly indoors, but my dad wanted to play baseball outside. He promised to play Monopoly tonight.  Well, it appears that he was ticked. I walked upstairs and continued editing and creating images for peoples profiles. Hey, I was addicted to photoshop!  The family went to dinner, we ate, got stuffed, and nobody could finish the last morsel on the last item of the meal.  When we got home, I came upstairs but was quickly called downstairs for the birthday present openings. Well, Dad and Mom were not pleased when they found the garage door hinge halfway in, halfway out. Kicked stuck.  My dad knew the culprit. Birthday boy it was. However he said "It wasnt me", which implied directly that it was me. Allow me to explain.  My mom and dad would never do a thing like that to the door. My other little brother just was't strong enough. Yes, that meant he implied the blame directly on me. The only people who truly knew were Dad, my brother, and me. My dad refused to talk, knowing that my brother was in deep trouble for lying, and nobody else believed my defense.  Now this loss of credibility in front of your parents is devastating for anyone. When around parents, you need to be a good little angel in their eyes, so when you make mistakes, they'll trust you. My little brother, one year older, has less privileges now.  He sat down at the table and cried. I almost felt sorry for him, but with the pain he gave me within the last year, I just walked away apathetic. It was his decision, and he made the wrong one. To make the situation worse, it was in front of his parents—the worst nightmares of his next 5 years living in this house.  When I was in my room, about 30 minutes later, my mom came up and asked me to join in a game of Monopoly. That fool has been hostile toward me all year, he tried to rub the blame off onto me after ruining the door, and now he wants me to play Monopoly? I said forget it, along with the sentence above.  Part II: War on Kerry  I stayed in my room. Then I met some nice republican dude. We came up with the idea of a new comic strip. Yep, you guessed it. War on Kerry. I'd post this on proboards support forum but it will get me banned because the admins on there are all Liberal. Below I'll show the first three images I've made so far.   Warning  These comics are very Republican and may offend you. Read at your own risk.  Please understand I am not responsible for any injuries resulting from the high amount of laughter you will experience from this. My suggestion: do not read with food in your mouth, or if you're in a dangerous position.

      Okay, this should span over about 3 days...  I talked to my girlfriend after working a 6 hour shift and before going to bed. I was invited to go to a play that she was performing in. Woohoo!  The next day, I was surfing around and I noticed that I made a big mistake.  Apparently I got the wrong e-mail to avenge my in-box.I guess an apology will be in order coming up. That's my major Oops of the Day.  Last night someone wanted to be nice, I guess. He messaged me on the forum and asked if I wanted Adobe Photoshop. I said alright. He's the nicest random person you could meet on the internet.  We spent about 30 minutes on AIM downloading until my computer crashed because of a popup. Crud. I rebooted and started all over again.  We talked for about 2 hours before it was finished. I installed it and went directly to bed, giving him my eternal gratitude.  Last night I had the weirdest dream about being Spiderman, and being seen in my underwear, and that turned the whole city against me. I spoke a lot of profanities in that one, but then again, it was only my dream. I ran out of town muttering that I was unappreciated, etc., etc., and woke up.  I made a new banner and some good buttons for my site with the new Adobe Photoshop. http://gameboards101.proboards15.com if you want to check it out. It might take a while to load.

      Keep in mind that this covers an 11 day period, not just a few, like it may seem. Vacation lasted 9 days.   Part I: An Eye for an Eye and an E-Mail for an E-Mail   The day before I left for vacation, I created a thread at a message board, and someone called it spam. Everyone else seemed to disagree, and that person was seriously ticked at nobody else but me.   So this person messages me on the forum and says that she will hack my computer, etc., etc., and says when things go wrong, think of this incident, etc.   Well, it figures she just set me up for a thousand spam mailing lists. Is that your great hack? Is that your big bad threat?   She had her e-mail protected on that forum, so I couldn't get back at her for that.   I left home ticked.   Part II: Sunburn and Sand   I left home and we drove for about 7 hours. I remembered telling my boss that I was going on vacation, but I had a feeling it wouldn't work out so well as I left the house.   On the way, it was&nbsp;a quiet trip. No instigating brothers, no loud farting noises; just plain silence. Perfect.   We finally got to Virginia Beach. We stayed at the Marriott. Then we went outside and played around the ocean for a couple hours, and went back. Lots of sand and sunburn.   Part III: Disney Basketball   I bet at least once in your life you've wished on your birthday that you'd have instant popularity, importance, and acceptance around other people. I know someone who did.   I arrived at the game and bought two&nbsp;blueberry&nbsp;muffins. That filled me up for the day.   I forgot to mention the reason we stayed at Virginia Beach. We stayed to get some relaxation and to watch my brother play basketball.   My brother (the middle one) got crippled after his first ball&nbsp;game, so he was on crutches. I went to the game anyway.   The score was dead even the whole way through. Halftime we were down 10 points.   We caught up quickly, because the Cleveland Bearcats are known for their second-half comebacks. We ended up even again, 45-45.   There were 10 seconds on the clock, and we had the ball. The other team stole it from us. We fouled them. They got two shots. 3.4 seconds left on the clock, and they scored both. We needed a miracle now.   It figures that the birthday boy, sitting on the bench, was put in and it was his turn. He needed to make a three-pointer. 47-45 them.   The coach blew the whistle and the point guard took the ball about 100 feet from the basket. He passed it to another kid, 2.4 seconds left. He passed it to the third kid, who was standing at halfcourt.&nbsp;1.6 seconds left. He passed it to the birthday boy. 0.5 seconds, and he took the three point shot, and made a nice Disney buzzer-shot. You know, the ones you see on the movies.   That was a relief. 48-47 us, and time to go back to the hotel.   Part IV: Revenge   Remember how Part I ended?   Lucky for me, there was a computer terminal at the Marriott. It was like a deus ex machina.   I sat down and added all the spam addresses to my block list. Yahoo isn't too tough to do that with. No more spam for a while.   Next I logged onto a different forum. Not the support forum. A member with the same name and same profile of the fool&nbsp;was registered there, and the e-mail was exposed. Lucky me.   I siezed the opportunity, and e-mailed myself the address of the fool, and saved it for when I got home. I couldn't wait to avenge my in-box, and it would be a nice thing to do when I'm bored, too.   I left the computer terminal with a smirk.   Part V: Red Skin   We went to the beach later on that day. I sat on the shore and fell half-asleep for about 5 hours, just waking up to get a catch of the view or to turn over.   The stupid thing about that is that I forgot the sunscreen. When I got home, I looked like a walking tomato shaped like a human. I knew that all that sunburn would eventually turn into tan, but for now it just plain hurt.   Part VI: Full Gas Tanks   The ride home was a gaseous ride. I don't mean that in a good way. I was almost dying&nbsp;from methane poisoning until someone opened the window. Mr. Fart It All, my crippled&nbsp;brother,&nbsp;was sitting right in front of me the whole trip.   When we got home at midnight, I was a pale green, and stepped outside to regain my breath. The dog was happy to see us. I'm not surprised. 9 days x 12/7 (rate in dog years)&nbsp;= 15.4 days. That's how long we were gone in dog-days.   Part VII: AWOL   I returned home and went inside only to find out that my boss thought I went AWOL. I would call tomorrow.   Okay, tomorrow morning, rise and shine and find out that your mother has&nbsp;done everything for you. I told her that it was  my &nbsp;freaking job for crying out loud. Anyway, I called them up and told them I'd work the 1-7 shift today.   One of the girls there was jealous that I had a darker tan than her. I explained that I was at Virginia beach. I straightened everything out with the managers. It appears that they knew about my absence but never erased my schedule. Oops.   After work,&nbsp;I went home early&nbsp;at about&nbsp;5:00 with a nice paycheck of $72.00. Time to sit down, relax, avenge my in-box, and write my blog.

      I know I haven't written a blog in a while, but we're going on vacation soon, so when I get back, expect a few pages.  Last night I had a really weird dream. It could probably even be made into a video game, but if anyone like Nintendo is reading this, you might think I'm crazy.  It started with me and my family in a cabin, enjoying our lives in the Medieval times.  I was warned that I had to stop a scientist from using his experiment, because it would fail and possibly destroy half the world (somewhat like Doc Ock's experiment in Spiderman 2).  I ran over to the place where the scientist was doing his demonstration. He turned his machine on. I was too late.  This created tornado force raindrops that were actually entire ponds and lakes repelled by the machine, but no wind. I took quick shelter.  After the raindrop bullets ended, the town got out of their houses. There was no water at all except the dew left from the experiment. All the water on this side of the world has been jetted to the other side of the world. I was set out on a mission to go to the other side of the world and bring that water back, before it was too late and everyone died from dehydration.  So I started, and only got halfway through until I woke up. Now don't tell me that wasn't a crazy dream.

      I finally broke my record. It's official.  This morning I woke up at abou 11:00 and talked to my girlfriend for a while.  Next thing I did was I played some roleplay again.  Next thing, I was doing some programming with the staff's select thing on the  urlLink Gamer's Forum  that I'm in charge of.  I got a nice start to the day, then I looked at the clock. 2:45. I was lucky to make it to work on time.  I threw my clothes on and luckily, my dad was there to take me to work.  Isn't it weird how I work at McDonalds and never get fatter? It must be my exercise program that I call the "Relentless Program". However, its practices are exactly opposite its name. Below is a list of what to do.   The Relentless Exercise Program Sit and program on the computer for as long as you can  Bring up food if you're hungry. Preferably cereal and/or milk.  If you get bored of programming, sit and watch TV for a couple hours  Once you feel nostalgic because you left your computer, go program again.  Go to bed when you feel like it.  Wake up when you feel like it.  Stay inside as much as possible.   Not much of an exercise program now, is it? I'm still working on the details, but that's really what I'm doing here. I'm still  underweight   Anyway, back to my day.  I was working in the first window. Not the most exciting post for my shift. I got my paycheck. I opened it.  $100.03  But there were $10 taken off for tax. It should have been $110.03. I looked again and there was a new tax listed on there. Maybe it was a tax only for >100.00. Maybe it was a new federal tax. Whatever it was, it was sapping my wallet dry and I hated it.  I talked to my Girlfriend tonight. I forgot to tell her I got my paycheck today, but oh well. I can do that tomorrow. We talked more about each other's lives.  We're finally staring to communicate a lot more. I am happy about that.

      I don't see what problem my brother has with living in the same house as me. We always fight and never get along. Not like most brothers, you'd say.  My twelve-year-old brother always thinks he's muscular, cool, and über alles just because he wears his pants halfway his thighs, blasts rap music everywhere he goes, plays basketball, and uses every foul word invented—including the ones in sign language. He's only halfway cool and still attempts it, which makes him a wannabe.  This conflicts with my interests. My interests are more computerized. I like technology, programming, and graphic design. These interests are always the target of the belligerent "cool" person, so he tries to score extra points by picking on his older brother. Real smart.  This morning he woke me up by the sound effects of  the computer, at full blast.  The rest of the day followed, and this was the most intense non-physical fighting we've ever done. Insults, threats, and cuss words were flying like grains of dirt in the Dust Bowl. This lasted about two hours.  I only fought back to defend. What is his mental diagnosis? He thinks he can be cool by picking fights.  Later that night, I started doing some roleplaying games. Those are fun online, and you make a story in a co-op mode.  I talked to my girlfriend again on AIM.  It was a mellow conversation, but we did find out about each other's more recent lives.

      Today the Electrician finally came and fixed the electricity. Now I can write my blogs. Woohoo!  Not much happened today. I rolled out of bed. I still had sunburn, which made my scratch even more painful to touch, and I changed clothes.   I was wondering about Hannah all day. I haven't called her up on a date in a very long time. I've been busy and stuff, but that's no excuse to keep her waiting  this  long.  I just haven't worked enough guts to do anything. I'm either too conservative or too cowardly. Probably too cowardly, because of the Millenium Force incident.  I checked my mail, worked up to pace and worked ahead of even that. I started programming, and my brother started bugging me to play a game called Easy Money. He took my chair and threw it out of my room and cursed at me for not agreeing to play.  So how does he expect me to play against him after he cusses me out every day? I don't see what his problem is, but it needs fixing—and fast.  At about 11:45, I saw Hannah log into AIM. Usually she never goes on AIM, and neither do I. I was surprised. This was the first time we've talked in months. We talked for about 15 minutes, finding out more about each other's summers. Then we both said goodbye and logged off.  I wrote three blogs with happiness.

      Today I woke up on the wrong side of the sunburn.  Allow me to demonstrate: "OUCH!"  The morning was a drag, as was the afternoon. I was told to see Spiderman 2 with my brother. So I watched it.  Free popcorn night. That was good. I stepped into the theater and the movie began to roll.  It was a great movie. I'd give it 4 stars out of 4.  It focused mainly on Peter and Mary.  That was about it. I went home and went to bed.

      Cedar Point  This morning, I woke up and got ready to go to Cedar Point with the rest of my family. My dad didn't come along because he has motion sickness.  My first and only roller coaster was the Blue Streak. The oldest roller coaster in the park. I almost destroyed my back on that one. That's why I hate wooden roller coasters.  Next thing we did was stand in line for the Magnum. The wait wasn't so bad. It was only an hour.  As soon as I looked at the slope of the Magnum, I chickened out and stepped out of the line. I hate zero-g. I'm afraid of heights. This park isn't made for the weak. I stepped out of line to get some lunch.  It amazes me how much fear my baby brother can take. He's 8 years old and by the looks of it, he doesn't have any sense of fear. He can watch the worst horror movies and not have nightmares, he can go on the Dragster and say it was a baby ride. Now  that's  freaky.  After that, we all went on water rides. That froze us in the hot sun.  Last thing we did was stand in line for the Millenium Force. I watched as the trains zoomed by us. I had a good feeling, and stood in line for two hours.  I looked at my sunburn. That was going to hurt. I wasn't white anymore, I was fluorescent-pink all over.  When I finally got to the front of the line, I felt a sudden unpleasantness in my stomach. I was freaking out. I wasn't shivering in the cold anymore, I was shivering in fear. I stepped out of line just before the next train came.  I'm such a coward. I'll never conquer my fear of heights and speed. Maybe not until next year. We'll come back, and when we do, I'll be ready.  We left the park. Funny thing though, as soon as we got onto the highway, we got a flat tire. A flat tire! We're stuck in the middle of nowhere, about 15 miles from home, and we have a flat tire. This is when my ingenuity came into play.  The Truth About OnStar  I asked my mom to press the OnStar button. We called them and told them we needed help. They said we needed to setup an account.  We went through about 20 minutes of registration. My mom couldn't read the Vehicle Identification Number, so I found a cell phone and used the light for that.  After about 25 minutes, they asked us to turn the car on and wait for a beep. That didn't work. They tried again.  "Our satellites might be failing. Try again tomorrow."  What is wrong with those people? We needed help! They disconnected us and left us on the highway with no tire change. Thanks a lot, OnStar.  We would have stayed there all night if it hadn't been for a tow truck that randomly came by. He wasn't affiliated with OnStar, he told us. Thank God he came by and helped us replace the tire. He warned us not to go anywhere over 60 mph, and we took off again. A lot of good OnStar did.  We all went home and went to bed. I had sunburn, so I was uncomfortable all night.

      This morning I woke up at 6:00 am. I had to serve mass, so I ate a breakfast and got my dad to drive me over there asap.  It was boring this mass. The usual Sunday stuff.  When I went home and sat for a while, my dad made me mow the lawn. That's where I got angry. I got almost 4 hours of sleep and I have to mow the lawn. Real fun.  After two hours when I finished, It was about 12:00, so I thought I might watch some TV. I had to go to work in 3 hours.  Work was really dead when I got there. There were no customers. What the heck?! Everyone was making food on their home grill; nobody wanted fast food on a day like this.  So my manager made up for the lack of money by putting us to work.  I had to sweep the floor, mop two different large areas, clean the windows, walls, and change the garbage, scrub the toilets, and sweep and wipe the playland.  After four hours, I was exhausted.  Then it was time for fireworks. I was almost too lazy to tie my shoes. I did it anyway, and when we got to my parents' friends' house, I laid down in a hammock. I was wide awake when I laid down, but I was sleepy when I stood up. That was strange.  Then the fireworks began. I put my chair in the best view possible.  The fireworks were amazing, but then I felt an extreme exhaustion come over me. I felt drowsy and tired, and almost slept through the fireworks.  When I got home, our uncle and aunt came to visit. They wanted to take us to Cedar Point. I agreed, and went to sleep.  In the next sequence of events, my uncle tried to fix a lightbulb, and broke the circuit-breaker. That lost power in my room and in my brother's room, which is why I wasn't able to make a blog until today. The circuit-breaker was broken off, and we needed an electrician to come by soon.  That was the end of the fourth, and I went right to sleep.

      Okay, today I was bored. Big deal.  I woke up on my own this morning. When I got to the cabinet, I noticed there was no more cereal. I skipped breakfast.  Later on, I played more Golden Sun. I'm still trying to get all the djinn so I can get to the secret level in the second game.  Anyways, that was boring: djinn hunting. I got stuck in a cave. How much boredom can you get.  I then flipped the game off and turned on the TV. Nothing was on except news. News is boring.  Next thing I went to work. Not as boring. At least I'm doing something. The three hours I worked today went by smoothly.  Somehow there's a big scratch or something on my forearm. I'd tell you what it was if I knew, and it doesn't look like it's going away soon. It looks like one giant scar. I have no idea what that was caused by. As soon as I find the  source  of this I'll tell you.    Next sequence of events, I went home, played more Golden Sun, trying to complete the cavern level this time, and didn't succeed. I put the game down. Maybe tomorrow.  I flipped on the TV again. Might as well watch the news. I stopped that and went upstairs to my room to play on the computer, update some cage scores, check my  urlLink gameboards  messages, and screw around editing graphics for a while. I'm actually getting pretty good at that.  What my parents' problem is that they can't tell me things unless it's short-notice. I stood up until 12:00 midnight and then my parents came in and said I had to wake up at 6:00am. What the heck?!  I guess now it's inevitable: I'll only have 6 hours of sleep tonight. Minus the hours I can't sleep.

      Today was a mellow day. I hardly did anything before or after I went to work.  This morning I had Reese's for breakfast. Candy for breakfast?  No  Reese's Puff  Cereal ! Soon I was swirling in a peanut buttery—okay you get the idea.  I woke up catching my brother sneaking into my room. That's rare. He was going to try to yank the covers off me again. What a moron.  Next thing, I put on my uniform. I went to work. I sat at the first window collecting money for 4 hours. Nothing special at all, except 90% of the time people gave me $20 bills, even if their total was only 50¢. That ticked me off a little.  When I got home at 7:30, I played Golden Sun for about 4 hours, then I wrote this blog.  See what I mean? Nothing eventful today.

      Today, Cage Matches started. It's a bi-annual event at  urlLink Chess Live  that I'm in charge of. It's a big competition that lasts an entire month. Today, the opening day, the whole thing went into a frenzy.  The whole Cage Match thing is controversial. Some members like it, others think it's stupid and pointless.  I'm still begging my parents to get batteries so I can finish the Golden Sun game. They seem to never have any time for that.  Today started off like every other day. I tried to go to chess club, but nobody showed up. I guess the schedule change wasn't in effect yet. I got ticked.  In other news, I have work tomorrow. Not 4 to 7 as usual on Fridays, but 3-7 shift. Woohoo, finally. One more hour.  One full hour: it's a start, but I'm getting more hours.

      Once you read the title, you might be thinking of the  urlLink www.badgerbadgerbadger.com  website or something.  Well, the truth is that Im actually going to use that term because my parents badgered me out of something I really wanted to do.  Okay, I wanted to see my girlfriend's play. My parents wanted me to invite a friend. First of all, they will be more bothered than interested.  My parents kept bugging me over and over and over. I finally gave in. I called all my friends up and asked them to see the play with me.  The only problem was that they were all on vacation. Now that means that I get to go alone. The futile argument was won by me, but it didnt last long.  My parents cancelled the reservations. Sore losers! They said wait until next week when they're all home.  Bah. Badgers.

      This is the biggest debate between spiritual leaders and scientists, but we are here to make common ground, not to argue.  On one side, you have spiritual leaders saying that the Bible is the main story of creation. On the other side of the boxing ring, you see scientists proving their theory of evolution.  Scientists have proven that monkeys actually have blood that is almost identical to the human DNA, making it possible for blood transfusions. Also, the Bible says that everything happened in seven days, but science has proven that no man has ever been alive during the age of the dinosaur, possibly meaning a "day" was an "era" in the formation of The earth.  Take below the quotes as you wish. The story of creation: Evolution style.  "In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the warth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters."  The part "The earth was a formless wasteland" most likely means that earth was still gathering dust from the nebula, gaining matter, and making a suitable spot for life to form.  "Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day."  The light forming was the sun's hydrogen atoms collecting together in dense, intense heat. The pressure became so great, that the sun ignited and became our star. The light and night was actually a very old explanation of how the world saw night and day. Remember, this was back in the days when they didn't have any NASA satellites.  Well, those are just some examples. I hope you find more examples than I do. If so, then by all means, share them!  In conclusion, Science is not our guide to the bible, but the bible is our guide to science.

      Okay, another survey says that Democrats and Republicans are almost completely even.  urlLink Click here  for details. Don't worry, I already told everyone to act mature. All of them are over 13.  At another poll, It the statistics seem to be more interesting.  Have you been kissed yet? Most people over 13 years old say they have not had their first kiss yet. That is about one third.  The other third has had his/her first kiss before he/she entered high school.  The final one-fourth had their kisses during high school, while a tiny percent had the kiss after high school. It's a really interesting poll, and I suggest you take part in it. (You must be a registered member to vote though.)  So if you're over 13 and haven't had your kiss, there's a good chance you're perfectly normal.   urlLink The poll can be viewed by clicking this text.

      Are humans the part of the Animal Kingdom, or are we something else?  According to raw science, when it comes right down to the facts, we eat and drink like animals, sleep like animals, we reproduce like animals, we can kill our own species like animals, and we can be trained like animals. Without education, there would be difference between the behavior of humans and animals.  However I have encountered many people who say that since humans are spiritual beings, we are not animals.  I have to agree partially with that. We are intelligent, sentient, spiritual beings. But we are not completely separate from monkeys. Studies show that human DNA is almost identical to a monkey's, allowing blood transplants from our primate cousins.  So does this prove the theory of evolution?  The theory of evolution I hope you all know. The belief of creation I hope you all know. I will discuss this in my next blog.

      Here's somthing to think about. Some people think so, some people don't know. Can chatting on the internet really improve your social skills?  My experience is at acting class today. There were about 85 students in all. Today is only the second day and I've already made about 15 new friends. Previously, though, I have been an internet addict for the whole summer. Is this a nice way to train your social brain, or is it just a coincidence?  In a poll asked  urlLink here (click)  the opinions are divided 2/3 to 1/3.  So what do you think?

      Okay, since computers are a part of science, I think I'll launch this big baby off with some computer science. It's my main field and I'm actually quite interested in computers. Expect a lot of posts about computers.  As I was saying:  Let's go to the basics. A character is a letter, number, symbol, or a superspecial character. A spacebar is considered a character, a "U" is considered a character, and punctuation and this thingy: §. All of those things you can highlight.  Okay, let's get a little more advanced. Now you're wondering what a special character is. If you go to start > programs > accessories > Character Map, you'll see what I mean. Double click something to get it onto the screen, but since I have most of them memorized, I'll teach you something.  You know what the number pad is? It's the little group of keys that look like a calculator. You know, the buttons 0-9 that you thought were useless on the far right on your keyboard (unless you're using a laptop). We're using that in this demonstration.  Okay, what I want you to do is click the textbox below. Hold the [ALT] key and tap 0189, then let go of the [ALT] key. You should get something like "½".    Okay, now the final part is more complicated, since there is no way of testing this and there are no visual explanations here. These symbols do  not  appear on your character map. You can get them through extensive trial and error. You can get superspecial characters like &#9829 and &#9632 along with &#8362. You can find an entire site about this at http://shark.nickj.elixant.com/symbols.html. What you do is you insert them into a HTML editor and watch the sparks fly. My personal favorite is &#1645. Have fun with your newfound knowledge!

      Okay, since my other blog was constipated with a mix of scientific blogs and my personal life, I decided to separate the two. Below are the best links that I have written so far. You might enjoy these links. The best one in my opinion is link #5. However feel free to look at them all!  http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/07/51-ways-to-know-youre-addicted-to.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/is-riaa-monopoly.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/pi-finder.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/invasion-of-may-fly.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/spam-spasm.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/prophecy.html http://ilovepi.blogspot.com/2004/06/photons-liability.html

      Okay, here's a new scientific thing you might want to read. These will be designed to keep you up thinking all night. Another one of the great things of science is that the more you share your thoughts, the more you help benefit society.  For starters, some of you might know me as Relentless from Proboards, ILOVEPI from Chess-Live, or just plain Michael Carozzoni from real life.  Well, let the blogging begin!
