      I decided that everytime I have nothing to do in the computer lab, I'm just going to write in this thing. I'm waiting for one of my sorority sisters to finish e-mailing whoever she's e-mailing. I feel incredibly dizzy today. But I'm going to go.

      I went home this weekend, and my ex totally avoided me. He took my phone calls, but he even stopped doing that. I don't understand what I did to deserve to be treated like I'm an unwanted disease or something. I wanted to get back with him long before I knew he was going on a date with someone else. I should've told him. I know I broke up with him for good reasons, but now I just want to take it back. I guess that's my own fault. You never know what you've got till it's gone. Now I'm stuck with getting the shaft because he's got someone to take my place. I don't know what to think of this. I think I'm making myself sick crying over this. Or maybe it's the weather change, but I don't know about that. Well, I can only blame myself. Maybe he's avoiding me because he knows it's best this way and that we shouldn't see each other because it will just hurt...maybe he's got the best interest in mind. But I can only feel what I feel and that's what I want to act on.

      I have less than 12 hours till I will be going out for my 21st birthday! What a weird feeling to finally be able to drink alcohol legally! I mean, I haven't since I've been back at school, so the appeal of alcohol has already started to wear off, but will I get a second wind when I turn 21? Oh, boy, I'm superexcited about all of this. I mean, it's not life changing or anything, but it kinda is! People tell me it gets old quick, but that's fine. Now there's nowhere I can't go because I'll be 21...I'll finally be able to go the big girl bars, where normal people my age hang out!

      Don't ask me why, I have that stupid new Britney Spears song in my head. I really don't like Britney Spears, but her shit is annoying and stick in your head like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. Anyway, last night I just hung out at Jed's with a guy I used to consider my best friend. I don't think we even have the right to consider each other that way anymore. It's sad. I totally adore him, love him to death. I asked him if it bothers him, the situation between us, and he said, "It's been four years. I'm just used to the way it is now." I wanted to cry. He means so much to me, but to me it always seems like he's running away from the people that want to be in his life. He flocks to the people that want an unattached way of life like his. I mean, I can't force him back into my life, and I can't jump right back into his. I wish it wasn't so complicated, but when we were back in high school, it all seemed so easy. And he was someone who really made me think...I just have a hard time believing that we've truly grown apart. I miss him. I know it will never be the same. Losing touch sucks, it really does. I am still happy (like yesterday), and telling people that I broke up with the ex makes me feel all the more empowered, but I'm feeling a little down about circumstances.

      HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  Well, even if it is a day late, I still mean it. I don't know how long it's been since I wrote, but I am doing so much better now. My life is going very well lately. I am happy to be single, and happy to have my freedom, and happy to still be me after everything is said and done! I am a bit stressed out, but I only have 3 or 4 weeks of school left, and I have some loose ends to tie up. I'm looking forward to leaving, but I'm not. Beginnings are scary, endings are sad, and the middle is what counts. And although my middle wasn't exactly how I would've written it, I have learned a lot and I wouldn't take any of it back. But I definitely wouldn't do it over again! I'm glad to be in the place that I am now, and I wouldn't want to have to suffer again to get to this point! Breaking up with my ex was the best thing I could've ever done. I am seeing that now. If we never talk again, so what? What kind of person was he to cheat and cheat over and over again? What kind of love is that? That isn't a relationship! That's dependence, and I'm too smart to believe a mirage. I am so free and happy right now, and I love being myself and single and making my own choices, not based on what anyone else wants or strongly believes. And I know that I will find someone who loves me for me, and won't try to change me or clip my wings. I have learned that the wings of an eagle cannot be held back forever! I am so happy right now! My friendships are wonderful, and I have gotten rid of the people who just bring my life down. What a great feeling to have everyone I love in my life (as much as possible, anyway!)! And I am no one else's girl but my own! My family is good, of course, but I really don't see them enough. School is fine, and I'm enjoying life. Can you tell? I suppose I'll stop here. But to each of you who are doubting yourself, maybe you need to do a little cleaning house of the soul and the external influences that may be bringing you down...I did!

      Hot damn, it's been awhile since I wrote in here! I think I'm back to using this journal because they freakin' erased my other one on Open Diary for not logging in after three months...I haven't logged in here after almost two years, so what the f**k? Anyway, wow, reading my old entries has shown me that so much has changed! I am living in Los Angeles now. I am working as a paralegal and waiting out this year before law school. I'm so hung up on someone else (who is now my ex, someone I met in DC when I interned there) that it's disgusting, but I'm still trying to negotiate my own way in life. I'm not as happy as the last time I wrote, but I feel more free and independent than ever.

      Lame night. Lame day at work. It's all just blending together lately. I'm not sure if I'm in a funk from the events of this past weekend or if I'm just sick and tired of this shit and looking forward (anxiously) to the next step (law school). I just feel really really low. I think it has something to do with the fact that my weekend was traumatic. But my friend C knows a guy from her job that wants to be set up with me, which is a positive thing. I have really sworn off of dating for a long time, but the good thing about this is that I am leaving here in two months (and counting!) and so I know it cannot turn into anything serious or more than a good time. Unless he's a psychotic bastard, but I hope I don't get to that point with him. We'll see where that all goes. I am just glad to be on the recovery track from this whirlwind of lies and betrayal. Now I can just leave R and V to deal with their own bullshit and deception together, because I'm completely out of the picture. I wonder if they'll work out...hard to say. I really do feel for V, because she thought she was getting back into a worthwhile relationship and believed their drama days were behind them. And she gave him her virginity, too...I don't wish heartbreak of that sort on anyone, even if they are the object of the person I love's desire. I'm starting to doubt how I feel about him anymore, anyway. I don't think I can love him after he deceived me the way he did. I am just so numb to him now, so I'm not sure if I can comment how I truly feel. It just seems like my body and my heart went into shock. After Sunday, I just couldn't cry over this anymore, and my head will not really allow my thoughts to remain there, either. But my body has been extremely and inexplicably lethargic, and it's hard to pinpoint the reason for it. I don't know. I just imagine that the toll taken on me cannot be masked by any defense mechanism, automatic or forced. I just wonder if he's truly sorry and if he'll get over losing me from his life easily or not. I just want to believe that he didn't mean to do this and that he's really sorry, but I don't believe it. I can't. So I guess it does hurt me enough to have a strong reaction...but I won't allow myself to dwell on what happened much...probably healthiest that way. Anyway, I think I'm gonna take a break and read a book. Too much Internet for one day.

      Here's a little original poetry, by me. This actually isn't poetry, it's more like prose, I'd say. Just my thoughts on my current situation.  YOU LET ME DOWN, by F.A.E. I had this faith that nothing could shake, no matter how many times the phone should've rang and didn't. You had this way of piercing through my cynicism and my agonized past to make me believe in you. I put you on a pedestal so high that I didn't mind that you blocked my view of the sky. But then I couldn't see you falling from that great height until you were at my feet in a crumpled heap. At first, I wasn't sure it was you because, well, I though I knew all about you. You reached out your hand, and I wanted to save you but you were so far from what I wanted anymore that I held you and held you... and finally, I turned my back and walked away. I could've taken you along but there wasn't enough room for the two of us on this path I chose.

      I did it. I played the bigger person, I sacrificed my own integrity for someone else (who I love) so that he could be with someone he loved...but I didn't do it without changing my life so that I could finally be free of the chains that lies and deception have shackled to me. Geez, yes, I love him, but all of this pain is unacceptable. I need to move on with my life, and he chose to hurt me so much to the point where I couldn't forgive it now, and I may never be able to forgive it, who knows. It's all so raw right now, it's hard to say. I am liberated, though, because he turned out to be someone I didn't know after all, and my heart is broken but I realize that this is the way things must be and I must hurt in order to heal. I have surprised myself with my own strength. I am this pillar that I never knew I could be...there is someone inside of me who only comes out when she is really hurt, and just knows how to pick me up and carry on until I'm ready to stand on my own two feet. Like, my strength and unselfishness truly has amazed me. I think I'm a jealous person by nature...not a devious one, a jealous one, but I became the reasonable ex-girlfriend today, I became the martyr when I sacrificed myself for someone else who wanted me only to do that to save something he had with another girl. That "he" is someone I happen to be in love with, who I thought was "the one." Wow, I don't think I'm the best person on earth right now or anything nutso like that, but I am surprised at my capabilities. I am surprised I could ignore his sobbing when I told him I was through with him and all of this. I have no desire to respond to his desperation e-mail because he's right, I do want to put this (and him) all behind me. Honestly. This time, I'm not fooling myself, I mean it. I meant everything I said, everything. I told him he made me sick, and I told him I was all out of tears, and at that moment, I was. I didn't cry talking to the girl, I didn't cry talking to him...who I am? Who have I become? I don't know the strength of this girl who is capable of choosing herself first in a time of crisis. I know that I won't stand by and watch him break me as slowly as he can. I have already been broken, and I won't be broken again. Wow. I can't believe all of this is the truth, that it's all what I mean with all of my heart. But I do. I'm changing. I am growing. I am me again.

      I am out.  He got back with his ex-girlfriend. I don't know why. He said she changed. She has matured. He likes her a lot and his feelings for me are gone...I don't get it at all. I can't comprehend it. But it's over. It has ended. This cycle has come to an end for me. There's nothing left to feel and if there is, well, it's not legitimate. It's unfounded. He wants her and she surely wants him again. And they've both changed and they'll be happy together. I awake from sleeping hoping this is all a bad dream, but it's not. It's my reality. My disease will eventually be cured, my disease of being in love with someone who doesn't love me anymore. I'll never see him again. We will never be in the same place at the same time ever again. He'll be out of my life forever, forever, forever. This is it. He's going to go on his merry way being with someone who cannot love him near as much as I do ("para ser mas franca nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo..." -Shakira, "Inevitable"), but it doesn't matter. It's over, he's gone, it's done. "Seguir amandote es inevitable." -Shakira, "Inevitable" Cry, sleep, cry, sleep.

      Does the name Cassandra mean anything to me? Because I just had an awful dream about R and a person with that name. I have nothing but nightmares about him lately...what do they mean? Is it just because he's on my mind? Is it just my own worries playing out? Or am I psychic? Telepathic? What does it mean? Why am I nuts? Why have I allowed this to drive me completely berserk? I am not a crazy person, but I surely feel out of control of my mind and my heart. It's like there is nothing I can say or do which takes away this panic inside of me. It's panic, it's anxiety, it's fear, it's everything...I cannot control it, I hate it. I am beginning to hate myself for it. No, I'm not beginning to, I already do. It's like I feel some strange lifeform has inhabited my body and it just won't leave me alone. But why? Why can't I just buck up and get over him? I have nothing to hang onto, so can you say I'm really hanging on? It's like something attached to my body I can't shake...what is the deal here?

      Ah, finally, it's Friday. I work all week long for this day...isn't that pathetic? But when you have a crap job like I do, that's all that you have to look forward to. I just have to keep repeating "law school, law school, law school" over and over in my head to remind myself that this will all be over soon.  Well, he called yesterday. Probably in response to the two e-mails and the message I left on his answering machine, but yeah, well, I never doubted that he'd call me BACK, but I wanted him to take the initiative and call first. I should remind him that it was his idea that we be "friends" after we broke up, not mine! The conversation was nothing to write home about, since I had just gone to sleep (granted, it was early, but I was tired) and he was acting like he felt like he was waking me up from this Snow White-esque sleep or something. He said he'd call me later, but ask me how much stock I put into that? Not much, don't worry. I'd like to see him this weekend, but what is the point of pushing it? If he wants to, he will, right? But that doesn't dismiss the fact that I miss his stupid ass.  But I think I have other things to keep me occupied this weekend. One of my sorority sisters is coming here from San Jose and another one is coming from Ohio. It should be a pretty busy weekend, I'm guessing, although I don't know what the hell the plans are, because I think they're all being made through one of my sorority sisters who lives in Van Nuys (25 miles from me). I miss my sister (sorority sister, don't forget) from San Jose. She was one of my best friends in college. So I'm excited to see her again. I haven't seen her since graduation weekend.  So, my friend R from home got into Teach for America. Whoopee for her. I'm actually really excited for her, but I'm a bit turned off by her lately. When I went home to Ohio, she was just out of control degrading and rude to me. So now, she is supposedly "falling in love," and now that she got into Teach for America in North Carolina, she's having all these crazy thoughts about "having the talk" with her current boyfriend (of two months...gimme a break! There's no talk to be had yet, but of course, will she listen to me? No! My advice is worth jack diddly to her, why does she bother asking me shit?) and maybe asking him to move down there with her. Those are similar to the circumstances for which she degraded me...I mean, f**k that shit! What a hypocrite! I'm really just sick of being her little pawn in life, and when I advise her (unselfishly, mind you, since she has a terrific way of wanting what's best for her in her advice to me) of what's best for her situation, she completely disregards it. But if I don't take her advice, I'm degraded, laughed at, pissed on with her snide comments...why the hell do I maintain this friendship? After my most recent trip home, I have to keep asking and asking myself that question. I almost wrote her a letter telling her that I needed a break from all of this bullshit, but I didn't...but I can't be sweet, mute little pawn me with her anymore.  Whew. Weekend is here, thank you thank you. I hope it turns out to be a good one, but most weekends for me having been finding themselves in the lame department. I'm going to chat in the Dave Matthews newsgroup chat now...until the next crisis...

      Wahoo for faking sick!  Yeah, well, I am not faking being sick of my damn job. I do hate it. I'm glad not to be there today. I didn't feel good yesterday when I left, and I'd probably be sick if I had to go in. Man, law school is just SCREAMING my name, isn't it?  Anyway, well, R did not call me last night. I was hoping he would, but where does hoping usually get me with him? Not very far. I had a dream about him last night, though, and it started with us kissing and me telling him exactly how I felt about everything...but oddly enough, I never got to see his reaction. It was morning then. So, I guess I'll never know until I actually do it. I don't know what the hell this all means and I know I should just move on. Damn it, I know that! But what do you tell your heart? How do you force it along? I am interested in casual dating, some sweet hooking up, but then I realize that sweet hooking up is love, and I cannot be looking for love in every random guy I decide to kiss. God, I am so not ready for anything with anyone, anything at all. I didn't realize how UNready I am, but I can't even detach the physical from the mental, and that's catastrophic. Better that I am alone. I crave one person and I crave one feeling, and neither of those can be obtained at this time. Best to just be me and not someone's girlfriend.  I have no plans for the day, although I should. I did some housing searches in Syracuse. It's such a rip off to live in off-campus graduate housing (owned by the university). Like I want to take out double the loans I already have to...no thank you!  Oh wow. They're playing flashback lunch hour on KROQ and "Mayonaise" just came on. One of my all time favorite songs, oh wow, I am so thrilled. "Fool enough to almost be it, cool enough to not quite see it..." oh, heart is breaking. Enough babbling for today. "When I can, I will..."

      Conmigo nada es facil...  Listening to Shakira right now. Can't help but take a line from her, it's so true. Not really feeling much of anything right now. Don't want to eat lunch, don't want to work, don't want to be here. I went with my friend to The Whisky last night to see her friends' band play. They rock, check 'em out for yourself: www.minuslarry.com. I really dig them. There's a guy in the band that I completely dig, too. I don't know him at all, but he resembles my ex boyfriend so much, in many ways and mannerisms. I probably won't go after him or anything, because that's probably not very healthy. I cannot just try and find a replacement for R in every guy I meet. I just have to get over R. What a boring day. Nothing much to say. I actually want to just go out and get plastered tonight, and the next night, and the next night. I'm not depressed, I know how being depressed feels, and I feel better than that. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, whatever.

      I hate my job, so very badly. I want a fun job for the last two months that I'm in here in good old California. Maybe the Sunset Strip? Who the hell knows.  What a really uninteresting weekend I had. I did nothing, nothing at all. I was angry at someone who I will not mention because I felt like he was blowing me off, but he wasn't, he was just doing school stuff. I watched 13 Ghosts (do not recommend) and Training Day (recommend but still confused) with my roommates, and I hiked up to the Hollywood sign (well, as close as I could get). That was the extent of my weekend. I worked Saturday morning and slept all of the afternoon away. I cleaned my room, too, but that's not newsworthy. Right now I'm sitting at my desk, eating. Lame. What a crap day.

      Oh yeah, I made a complete ass out of myself last night. What a fun girl I am. I went out with my friend and her friends from USC and got plastered. I didn't even really notice how much I was drinking. $1 drinks, how can you resist? I was having a great time, until I realized I had to drive home from Rina's house. F-ing balls. So then I called my ex and he was angry and said that I should stay at his place, although I'm sure it was a huge inconvenience and I'm sure he didn't really want me to. When I got there, it was 1:30 am, yes, I was still drunk as balls, and I was giggly and strange and probably really annoying. I didn't puke in anyone's better or at all, for that matter, but still...I think I was really annoying to him when he just wanted to sleep. Am I a bitch? Does that make me a bitch?  So, well, I'm agonizing over the fact that I'm going to go to law school where the city is virtually the size of my pinky. That freaks me out. I am not originally from the city, so therefore maybe I'm not a "city girl," but I've been living in them for over a year now, and I completely dig it and actually need it. So I'm panicking. I'll be 4 hours from NYC and 4 hours from Montreal and 6 hours from Boston...but still...I'm worried...  That's it. Best be getting back to work. Ugh, grr, boo.

      I am sick of my Rossford friends! Mostly just R. I am sick of the drama that her having a boyfriend has created! I cannot stand this "we" shit and her perfect image of him! I cannot stand being accused of shit that I don't do, I am sick of her putting words in my mouth to make herself look better, and I'm sick of being her pawn! I'm sick of looking bad for her benefit! Being her friend is just flat bullshit these days! Shit! I don't need the drama from her, I don't need the drama from my ex R, I don't need these sorts of people holding my life back! I need to just get the balls up and tell her to go fuck herself. That's best for me. I have been dealing with her manipulation for years and years. Enough bullshit already!  I am just angry because I had a fight with my ex J (my high school sweetheart) because of some shit that R concluded that I said that, in reality, I did not say. I never implied that it was J's fault that R's boyfriend got himself into trouble...whatever. I am not getting involved in this "we" shit with my friends.  I just had a looooong talk with my roommate, so now I'm mellow, and therefore, this entry is a little less heated than it would've been had I finished this up when I was on fire and venting earlier. I simply need to get myself some new friends, and discard those that only hinder my life. I think I know what I have to do, just a little nervous to end an 11 year friendship. Can you blame me? I mean, it is detrimental to me to stay friends with her, but it is hard to cut it off cold turkey. Despite the bullshit, the entire friendship isn't bad, but mostly, it is. There are less redeeming qualities to this friendship as time passes. Oh well...I will figure this out.

      I know there is no remedy for a broken heart. I know by holing myself up in my room, I'm not being overly productive in dealing with it, but I cannot bring myself to enjoy life in this empty state of heart right now. I miss him, I really do. It's been a week, that's it. I cannot believe it! It feels like forever...but it hasn't been. I need to keep that in perspective. I've never gone longer than a week not talking to him, but I have nothing to say. When I think of him, automatically something pops up into my head, like a circumstance where he lied. I gave him the benefit of the doubt all the time, I never doubted his integrity...I can't believe all of this still happened. But disbelief isn't going to change anything. But I still feel pain when I think of all of the things he could've said or done to remedy this and he didn't. I mean, the last time we had sex, I thought it was so loving and, well, at the very least, I thought it meant something. For him to ask me to forget it like it never happened? No, I cannot...and for him to make me out to be some kind of psychotic crazy woman to her? No, I cannot handle it! I cannot! I am still shocked that he did this to me, after how wonderfully I treated him and how much I loved him and how much I did for him and everything, everything. I can't believe it.  Went out to dinner last night with my friend T. I sorta have a crush on him, but I think I'm a little wild for him. I mean, I'm not a wild girl, he's just a little tamer than most guys I that I date or date me. He's adorable, though, purely adorable...I mean everything, his personality, his smile, his intelligence. Nice guy. I have known him in the friend capacity for a few months now, so most likely nothing will happen, especially since I'm leaving in less than two months...but it's nice to think about him. He is a wonderful, wonderful guy. I highly doubt he's capable of anything devious, but I haven't been the best judge of men lately, so I wouldn't put anything past anyone. Anyway, T and I had a great time. Good conversation, Cuban food, laughs, just fun times. I haven't seen him since December, so it was nice to spend time with him.  I should've gone out tonight with my friend S to Sunset, but I'm in this funk...I cannot seem to shake it. I feel like I am trying to emerge but have not yet emerged from my web of torment. I know I'll get out, but I don't think the new me has quite "hatched" yet. I guess I thought I could force this process along, but in all reality, I cannot. I just need to let myself mourn and hurt and I know that nature will allow me to progress like normal. *sigh* But I never thought I'd have to go through something like this with R. Surprise surprise!  Anyway, I think I'm going to read and fall asleep. Gonna run errands tomorrow to get ready for my mommy coming to town next weekend. More later.

      Getting ready to leave the office for the weekend, although it's not much of a relief, because I do have to work tomorrow morning. But I'm going to dinner with a really cool guy (who I sorta have a closet crush on), so that's a nice way to start the weekend. I'm doing alright, all things considered. Been feeling a little more at ease with things, although graduation is coming up and I have been finding my thoughts resting on him. However, it's been almost a week, and I have no urge to call him, which is completely miraculous to me. I'm proud of myself in that sense, though. I am going to be able to pull through this, and I'm proving it to myself daily. I've been a little down in the dumps this past week, I will admit, but I'm taking it one day at a time and trying to forget that my job sucks and just look forward to the new life I have ahead of me in law school. I've been feeling a little cute lately, which is also good for the ego. Well, anyway, enough of that. Later!

      So much sex on TV. Why do I bother watching smut, smut, and more smut? Ah, I wish I was sexy. Well, I may be sexy, but I think I mean skinny. I'm in a bummy mood. I just ate, I'm full, and feeling fat. You know how that goes? But I am too tired to do anything about the fat part. Working late hours never lends itself to exercise. All I know is that I gotta get myself into a routine before law school. Not really good to be set on laziness. I'm watching that dumb American Idol show. Some of these people can sing, but some of them are so annoying and pathetic, I want to slap the blond tips and tight jeans off of them. Anyway...have I said enough? Or maybe too much? I'm gonna check and see who called my cell phone and then lay down. Whoa, the guy Simon on this show just ripped that little teenager guy apart...he wasn't that great, anyways. Dumb little painted-on boy. Enough of me! Bye bye.

      It could've been simple...but it wasn't. Another day, another heartbreak. I have advice for all of you fucked up dudes out there. When you meet a girl who doesn't play games with you, don't play them with her. There's a reason she doesn't play games, so try to respect that. And if you're going to tell a girl that you like her, and you're going to have this conversation with her, then don't be shady about it after you have this discussion. You're fucking with her, and you're looking like an asshole when you may not be one. So give up the bullshit for once, okay? Yeah, that's my statement for the day.

      It's hard to diagnose a feeling sometimes, like how I feel at this moment. I just got off the phone with him, and yet, I'm not sure if I feel sick or if I just feel exhausted. I'm not sure if I got anything accomplished or if I'm still in the same place before I made the phone call. Not sure if they were the wrong or right things to say, not sure if I got an apologetic or an "oh I pity you" response...I don't know. All I know is that it wasn't wrong to call, because I feel alright and I'm not crying. I guess my body is in shock. I guess I don't want to let myself have a reaction to this, because whether or not I admit it to myself, it still hurts. And what he did can't be taken back and won't go away with time. The effects may go away, or fade, or get buried...but what happened can't be taken back. Which means that we can't go backwards and go back to being "friends" (if that's what you can call what we used to be) because...well, because he fucked it up, and when you fuck things up, you can't get them back again. So. So, that's that. He's going to visit V in New York tomorrow. He told me that she and he are not together, but I don't believe it. That's it. I give him no credibility anymore, whatsoever. I don't feel like I can believe anything he says. I discredit everything he has said in the past, and everything he has yet to say. But I just want to scream at the complexity of this situation! I don't know why it has to be this way! It's so ridiculous but he really left no other option. Ah. Brain on overload...or maybe brain frozen. Either way, must go to sleep before numbness wears off...don't want to be conscious for that. Good night.

      I am a flat out worrier. I can never rest easy about anything. I don't know how to quit thinking about things that I cannot change, or things that I have no control over. I just got to thinking about R, the ex. Wondering how he's doing...wondering if he ever thinks of me...wondering if he will be with V forever. Why do I think of that? That is all completely out of my hands. Then I think to myself, "I really want to talk to him." But what answers do I want from him? What exactly is it that talking to him will do for me? I am not going to get myself caught up in this drama again. But I guess it's because I'm still asking myself questions. I never ever expected this from R, and I'm still in shock that it ever happened in the first place. I don't know whether or not forgiving him will help me get over him. I know I needed the time away from him...and I feel like calling him tonight. I don't know if that's the right or wrong thing to do, I just feel like dealing with this lately. I feel like I need to let this go in order to move on with my life. I don't know what to say to him...but I feel like I cannot harbor this animosity toward him.  I guess I'm gonna get in the shower and try to shake this off...but I sorta feel like talking to him. I am not ready to talk to him on a regular basis, but I feel like I should talk to him tonight. I really have nothing to say. I guess I'm still looking for the answers that he wasn't able to give me before. I don't know.  Things are going alright besides that. M and I decided that we're going to "hang out," whatever that means. I hope it involves being alone with him and lots of making out, yeah! He's away for the rest of the week, so I hope he calls me when he gets back. I don't want to talk too much about it, because it's all up in the air right now.  Off to the showers I go!

      So, I have a new crush. But, I don't know how he feels about it. I don't know how he feels about anything besides that he kissed me about two weeks ago when he was drunk and he didn't want things to "get weird". Strange. Is it worth it to have crushes and like guys? Is all this agonizing over someone really worth the time? I'm thinking no. I'm thinking of how much I want to strangle him for not getting it. Ugh. I don't have much more to say because I don't want to think about him anymore. Or this dating bullshit.

      I am the captain of my own ship, according somewhat to Dave Matthews. So then why do I feel so out of control? I am going out to dinner with R tomorrow. Tomorrow is it, this is it. I am never ever going to see him again. I am going to be relegated to a girl from his past, a lesson he learned, and that will be that. I hold no place in his future, and I guess he really holds no place in mine either. I can't say I feel great about getting to have that position. I'm a chapter that's already been read, I'm a thing of the past. I'm distraught over this. I know that this is the closure that I need, but I still hope for us. I cannot help it! None of his decisions have made any sense to me, even a year after the breakup. How many years will it take for me to forget about him? My friend K was in Kent this past weekend and she said people said nothing but good about me. Not even an inkling of bad sentiments from anyone. If that is the case, then why am I alone? Why am I always suffering? Why is it the things that I want most elude me until I'm blue in the face? Law school, love, happiness...I may have complicated thoughts, but I'm not hard to please. I only ask for some of the things that people have and take for granted. I could appreciate them, and I'm certain of it. Why can't I have a chance at any of them to know whether or not I would really know what to do with them? I don't want to meet anyone else who's not into me like M. I don't want to get my feelings entangled in someone who's not capable of losing themself to someone. I just want something to work, dammit! Geez. I guess I'd better finish closing out my life here and get my worldly possessions into the boxes and bags and other storage mechanisms where they belong...I'm returning to the status of "nomad," as I have lovingly nicknamed myself after the past year of my life. Always roaming, always alone, searching for something...

      I cannot sleep at night anymore. I wake up in a panic thinking I have only one more week here. I'm just about on the verge of tears at almost every moment of the day. I don't know if I have really grown attached to this place as much as I see this place as a lot of missed opportunities. I could elaborate on that, but I think that it would take a lot of effort to rehash my regrets. I'd rather not. Not to say the entire year living here was a complete and utter waste. It wasn't in the least. I learned a lot about me and what I'm capable of. But I don't think a lot of the elements of this city worked with me (on my side) to maximize the experience here. There are a lot of cases of "what could've been," sadly enough.   I am not feeling so incredibly great right now. I took a little catnap since I got up this morning at 5:30 am this morning (in a panic, of course), and I feel warm. I feel fat too. I need to work out, but I cannot thing of one physical activity that I want to do besides eat. I gotta do something, this is pathetic. Get out of this funk, you crazy woman you (note to self, sorry you had to be privy to that epiphany).

      I have nothing to say, not so much. Just waiting for my friend K to call so we can meet up at The Whisky and see the other band on their label (www.unjustcause.com). Had a great late night conversation with M yesterday. Wow. He is great. I wish I had met him earlier. I don't really know him well enough and I'd seriously like to. I am convinced that he's just an awesome person. Someone that would've been a good person to have in my life. I hope I keep in touch with him. I really really do, but only time will tell if that will happen. You sorta lose touch with the people you are pretty sure you may never see again. I don't know if I'll ever see any of my California friends again. It's hard to say. Anyway, I guess I'm gonna leave work and head on out to The Whisky. Adios!

      Since when did I become a California girl? Ha ha ha. I had a good night last night. I hooked up with M and I'm happy about that. I found something that he wrote on his desk...a song or a poem or something. I think it was about me, I think. Not being vain, I just think the wording really fit this situation. It said something like, "You hold me to the little things that I easily forget," and something about "you know that I forget, but still you hold me to them." And then it says something about "Two weeks to two long months," and then something about "I can't seem to you get you off my mind, but still I know it's not right," or wrong, or something like that. I want to know what it was about, but I cannot ask to read it. But I think it's about me, I really do. Hard to say. I wish I remembered more! Anyway, I think I'm gonna get back to chatting and watching the Real World marathon. I'm too hungover to do much else. Smooches!

      Help! Rescue me from boredom! I had the worst 4th of July yesterday that I've ever had...I cruised around looking for something to do, trying to get a hold of friends on their cell phones who were already out and having a great time, and I ended up seeing sporadic fireworks from my car and watching everyone else stumble around drunk in Newport Beach. Fuck that shit. GEEZ! Just when I feel like this is my life, I get proven wrong with no fun plans with no one! Fucking balls! Not sure what the rest of my weekend holds in store for me, but at this rate, looks like I'll be spending a lot of time alone. Fuck this shit! I hate this! M's parents are out of town in England for awhile, which means he has the house all to himself...I fucking wish he'd call me up. Every time he mentions it to me, he always says, "I'll be allllll alooooooone," in that tone of voice that makes me think I should hope for something. However, my brain seems to know better from experience that I should never believe what he says until he puts his money where his mouth is. Tuesday night he said we'd hang out this weekend, but I don't see it happening. I don't know, I'm not going to hold a knife to his throat. I leave in a little over two fucking weeks. So if he doesn't have any incentive to see me, then I don't give two shits about seeing him. Whatever. I'm gonna try to sleep this depression off. The sun's not out today, which makes this a great day for sleeping. I'm not the least bit disappointed, because the sunny days in California are a dime a dozen, so there's cause for celebration when the sun isn't shining. Good night/day/afternoon, whatever you call it when you take a midday catnap.

      I am chillin' like a villain. Nice long weekend ahead of me, but I sure hope it involves something fun. I was invited to hang out with all of the boys, but my friend S was sort of "uninvited," and so I don't know if I should go. Hard to say, but I definitely don't want to sit around and pick my nose on the 4th of July (one of my favorite holidays, second to my birthday and New Year's). Anyway...I've been putting off getting ready for my move because I freakin' don't want to go. I'm not ready! I'm scared to go back East. My life is here. I can't believe I didn't have the foresight to understand that maybe I would love it here and want to stay. Ugh. Oh well, nothing wrong with change...but I wish I could stay where I like things. Well, a change will do me good! I'm just babbling now. Nothing to say. Just relaxing...thank you, Calendar God, for putting the 4th on a Thursday! Loooooong weekend!

      Well, I had a decent weekend. It didn't consist of anything I normally do, which did actually make me happy. I didn't go out and drink on Friday night and get wasted like I have been doing since I started school. That felt good. I didn't see any of my girlfriends this weekend, which was strange but alright (most were out of town, anyway). I saw my family, like my ENTIRE mom's side, which was also so much fun and a nice escape back to reality. I didn't feel the need to lament or cry once over the situation with E, which made me feel very rejuvenated. I didn't get my homework done which causes me to panic somewhat. However, I am going to be okay in the grandest sense of the word, and I'm happy about it. I realized that no tears are worth E, they just aren't. He's not a quality boy by any means, just by what I wanted to see in him. He is selfish, he is not intelligent like I like my men, and the most unappealing thing about him is that he's so confused that he makes other people look like the bad guys when really, it's him! I am happy to have hit this revelation so early. I mourned him a week and now I'm ready to get back up off the ground and start dating again. Hell, I need to revel in being single! I have been thinking about R lots and lots lately. Strangely enough, those thoughts don't hurt, they just offer me comfort and a hope in my heart. Things are looking up, and this week is not going to be anything like the last...I guarantee it! No more E getting under my skin. I don't need him! He's not the love of my life, and he doesn't even have the qualities I'm looking for in a boy. So, here we go, back on the roller coaster I go!

      Well, E spent the night at Y's house last night. I had a feeling, yes, I did a drive-by, and no, his car was not at his apartment. Nor did he return my phone calls, or my friend T's phone calls. I can't believe that I dumped him but I am the one getting dumped in the end. No rest for the weary, I suppose. I thought he didn't want to date anyone exclusively...so what is this regularity going on between them since last Friday? What is this about him liking me so much and him not wanting to be the "guy that hurts people"? He told me that he wasn't sure about dating altogether, yet he's fucking that potbellied bitch? Why is it that I always, always, ALWAYS get the fucking shaft? Okay, so maybe E's not the guy for me...what about our friendship? What about everything we had that existed a week ago? Did he forget? I feel like it's been months since we stopped talking, with the way he's acting, like nothing else matters and it's all done and forgotten. Why do I always find myself in situations with schmucky fucking assholes like this? Why did he do this to me? What about our friendship? What about everything that mattered only seven fucking days ago? What about all that?

      I talked to him today. I just thought the back and forth e-mail charade had to stop. So we talked. He doesn't see what he did as wrong...he thought that fell within the scope of our agreement. I told him maybe it did, but it happened way too soon, and he said he didn't have any control over it happening. I wish I could believe a word he said, but I don't buy that line. I think what he means is that it wasn't preplanned, but he still could've stopped it if he'd wanted to. I don't think he cared either way. He totally seems like he does, and when I talk, he's really listening to me, but I cannot change the fact that it's not just me that he wants. Maybe one day it will be just me. Maybe not. I don't think I can get back into things with him, though. Not knowing that it's going to be like this. I am a monogamous girl. It's the sort of relationship that I'm happiest in. If I wanted to date around, then I'd do it, but I wouldn't string someone along that I liked just because I wasn't sure. I can't believe he's 24 and still so immature. Right now, what would make me happiest is to be in a gratifying relationship with someone worth dating. I don't know if I want to go on the marriage track just yet, but I do want to have a functioning, adult relationship. I'm done with the fucking around with other people. It's so unfulfilling, and I'm not 18 anymore.

      Bummed. Still thinking about him. We did a good job avoiding each other in school today. But my concentration is still shot because I saw him today at flag football, since he joined my fucking team, and he just reminds me that he really really sucks. And that there's no remedy for what he did to me.

      I'm still feelin' a little icky sticky wicky. I know, I'm a fuckin' weirdo. I'm up too early. I slept on the floor at my friend A's house yesterday. Maybe that has something to do with it. And my hands are sticky from the orange juice I was just drinking. I didn't get drunk last night, just sat around with my friends D, A, A, and D's fiancee D. We talked about E, therapeutic, but doesn't solve shit. D (the fiancee) has his male theories about how E probably isn't feeling bad about what he did now, but in the long run, he'll realize that he's not gonna meet another girl like me. Greeeeat. I wish I didn't have to believe that all men are fucking scumbags. But I've got a guy telling me that it's really just about testosterone and it's not about who, it's about when. Is this the reality of it? If so, it is pointless to date and fall in love...they're always searching for someone! If it's not you, it'll be someone else to stick their dick in. Ugh, don't want to think about this bullshit anymore.

      So, E, well, he proved himself to be the biggest fucknut of them all. We had a talk this week about how he wants to date me and other people (oh, and lucky me, I could do the same, too!), and I think he already had someone in mind. Some potbellied black bitch who didn't look too into him when they were dancing, anyway. But he got her number last week at the club, and he danced with her all night last night at the club (yeah, even with me there, he made no attempts to dance with me), and then he took her home. So that's the end of us. I know it didn't last very long, but I can't help being upset because we had a friendship and not just a romantic relationship. I thought he had more respect for me than to just fucking hook up with someone like that. He was the one who said he'd be honest if that's what he chose to do. Guess there was no time for honesty last night! I am going to miss him in my life. I told him I hated him, that he was a slut, and I never wanted to talk to him again. I mean it, too. I fucking don't have anything to say. I could ask him if she was good, I guess, but I don't care, actually. I hate him. I can't believe these shitty things keep happening to me over and over. I don't know anyone whose dating life is as fucking tumultuous and as AWFUL as mine! I know every girl thinks her dating life is bad and guys are the devil, but geez...get a load of mine. It's so over, I'm so bummed out. He always said he hoped things went somewhere between the two of us...yeah, they went into the gutter! I can't think about this much more. I am running the maybes over and over in my head, and that's not good. He didn't want just me, and none of my actions could've stopped what he did and nothing I did would make him 100% satisfied. I know it's not me, it's him and his fucking gigolo attitude. Ah, but you know, all of the good reasons still don't cure the hurt.

      Whoa, law school. Yeah, whoa. What else can I say about it? I live it, I breathe it, I sleep it, I eat it (and yes, I have to like the taste of it)...it's really my life. Alcohol on Friday nights washes away my thoughts of torts and the Federal Rules of Procedure, but it also washes away my reasoning and I do things that are out of my character because I'm wound so tight lately. And I'm trying to comprehend everything, and I'm trying but not sure that I'm succeeding. I wish I didn't have to think so deeply about things...I don't think you can ever be ready for this and the changes that this brings to you and your life and your psyche. I have been thinking about R lately...why? I don't know...I feel like everyone's marriage meters are on full blast and I think I've been catching that fever. I mean, in three years, after this law schabang is over, I'll be 25. Should I be married then? Should I be in something serious? Should I have an inkling of a clue who "the one" may be? That's why I've been thinking about R. Because I'm dating this guy E, he's very sweet, intelligent, and an overall great person (except for the fact that he is a flirt, but I am too, so I suppose I'll freakin' deal for now). But I don't think he's "the one." I don't think he's the guy for me as much as I don't think that I'm the girl for him. And then I wonder, "Am I too old to be completely dicking around anymore?" Should I be considering who I date as a potential someone? I mean, am I wasting my time with E if I already think he may not be "the one" material? Or am I hitting this crap way too early in my life? I mean, career, marriage, etc...I can't ignore the fact that if I don't actively do something about it, it may not happen...right? How long can I just go along my merry way and expect something to happen? Things just don't "happen" to people...I've always made things happen to me. And that's where R comes into play. I thought he was the perfect boy, the boy I'd been looking for that only existed as a figment of my imagination. Should I let that get away? Has it already? Is there one more chance in the world that exists for us? Will I ever have the opportunity to know? I wonder about it...I wonder. I should stop wishing that one day there will be a one day for us, but I can't. I still harbor that hope that life will lead us back to each other. He may not feel that way about me...I don't know if I even fall into that context in his mind anymore. He probably just thinks about V as the one who got away...probably. But am I wrong to hope that one day he realizes that it wasn't her, it was me? Ah, there's no way to resolve this in my heart. I can only live my life for what it is, not for what I wish for. But one day, I hope those two consistencies will merge. I'm not sure if I'll be able to live life without taking that chance...love sucks! I wish I didn't have this hold over my heart!

      Well, I'm not in such a happy-go-lucky mood anymore. Law school isn't for me. I cannot keep up intellectually or even physically. Everyone is so much fucking smarter than me...who am I kidding? I heard my roommate today talking about how her roommates (me and H) like to go out so much and she's at a different place in her life now...I hate her for saying that. She has a boyfriend, she's content with life. Is it MY fault that I don't have a boy to cling to that makes me happy? Does she think I like the emptiness of going out and getting wasted beyond belief every weekend? Not exactly. It really pisses me off to hear her say that she's "just not in that place anymore." Give me a fucking break! Just because you're dating some schmuck seriously doesn't make you in any better place than me. I mean, give me a fucking break! I feel so incredibly low right now...I feel like a little kid compared to everyone else, and I'm starting to see things crawling up the walls and around the floor. I am just incapable of dealing with the bullshit that comes with law school. I should just do school and work and fuck everything else. I can't believe she actually thinks she's in a better place than me! Just because she has a boyfriend, and I go out to party because if I don't, what else do I do for amusement around here? I don't have the crutch of my boyfriend to rely upon! And everyone seems to have someone to keep them warm at night...I only have one friend who can remotely understand what boat I'm in. Two of my good friends are living with their boyfriends, and the rest of them always seem to have someone to count on. Annoying. And you know what? It's only annoying because your friends seem to lose the capability of understanding what life was like when they were single so that they can relate to you. Whatever. I have to concentrate on school now, but I needed to vent. Thanks and goodbye.

      Gotta get to work...but as for the rundown, more or less a bad-ish weekend. The boy I like is still hung up on his ex-girlfriend, although he knows that I like him now! Who cares...life's too short to keep your mouth shut. And you can quote me on that! Anyway, back to IMing with my buddies and then work, eek!

      Um, I'm totally avoiding reading my Torts homework. I am a sucky, sucky girl. I am still fried from midterms. I can't seem to get back on track! When I start to read, I think about everything else I could probably be doing...not so good at all. I think I'm going to be completely frivolous and list my law school potential boy exploits and really get away from my computer.  Boys to Chase (hahahaha, I'm so high school again!): Chris (but it would never work out!) Erik (yes, you look GREAT in a suit!) John (but he's the unchasable) Ed (had him once, I'd probably have him again, he's fun) Matt (but he's someone else's, so I'll wait it out) Mike (was that purple bandana for me?) Kris (I could learn to like Abercrombie) Graeme (no, not the cracker, the Italian stallion, ha!)  That must be it. Not the comprehensive list I thought it would be. Look at all those American boy names! The ethnic boys at this school are soooo lacking! I'm going back to my roots and dating Caucasian boys again...what an adventure! Actually, some of those boys are ethnic, their names just don't show it. Okay, enough enough ENOUGH procrastinating. I'm gonna read some tonight and do my best to get up in the morning to finish...or maybe I should just finish them all tonight, knowing me and my waking up early habits (nonexistant!). Anyways, bye bye, adios, sayonara, see ya later!

      I wanted to be your good friend...but good friends don't hide things from each other, and good friends aren't in love with each other, and good friends don't miss someone so bad that your heart aches and you'd forsake anyone else just to know that one day they'd be yours again. Who am I talking about? It's hard to say. There is someone who seems to care about me a lot more than anyone else does right now, like, he cares about my opinion and he's genuinely interested in my trials and tribulations. But he's in California, of course. Then there's someone else, who cares off and on, who's still most likely in love with someone who gave him up so that she could be selfish and noncommittal, and there's a secret that I have that would put the hope back in his heart...and I want the hope to fade so far away that it dies. I am just so out of it. I'm sober, I had a sober day, but still...I'm pensive, melancholy...just not sure how to deal with the phantoms from my past altogether and these feelings like little windwhispers that don't ever ever let me be. The love of my life is a past tense sort of description, and the current tense finds him in love with someone else. I want to be his friend, I really do. I want to get over this...but do I really? Do I really want to get over this? I probably really don't, I probably just want things to work out for us. But he and I working out isn't probably what he wants. -sigh- I don't think I can type anymore without getting too worked up. Gonna stop now.

      How long has it been since I wrote here? I can't remember. Life is good, I guess. This is probably as good as it can get while in law school. I feel satisfied with the test I took today (my first in law school!) and I am listening to a great CD (the new Beck CD) and I just "clumsily strummed my guitar" (as I've always wanted to since Jewel said it). So...it's good. I'm single, I'm fine with that. There is a boy that I want to date, but it won't happen. Don't foresee that happening whatsoever. And...my friends are wonderful, both the ones from home and school. Law school is a bit lonely, but I'll deal. I'm so tired, I may just crash early tonight as my reward for working so hard. Or maybe I'll just hang up clothes until I pass out. Yeah. See ya later.

      I'm pretending to be chillin' like a villain, but really I'm freakin' out about finals. I'm still at home for Thanksgiving (lovely) but reality is coming back to bite me in the arse tomorrow when I return to school. YIKES! Ten days till my first final, yeah, I'm freakin' out. Um, what's new in my life? Well, there's a new guy, kinda scandalous b/c he used to date one of my friends, so I'm keepin' it on the DL. It started out as a FB relationship, but I'm finding that it's becoming more and more emotionally involved, on his end and on mine, which is weird...aren't these things supposed to be detached and uninvolved? Who knows. We get along well, although we're really really different...it's nice. Maybe it's because law school is just a lonely,lonely place, and we all need someone to cling to. I think that's the answer, b/c he just isn't the monogamous dating type. I knew that from the get-go, so I didn't set myself up for any sort of heartbreak...but I'm starting to find that maybe I was wrong about him. But don't fret! I'm still proceeding w/caution! I am not stupid! I've been burned too many times to be blind...but not to be hopeful ;)

      I don't know what the fuck to do about my life anymore. I hate it. It is miserable. Nothing makes me happy anymore at all. I'm not suicidal, I'm just extremely depressed. I don't want to cry and I don't want to jump for joy. I feel nothing at all, in fact. I have no interest in doing anything. I have great thoughts and ideas but I don't actually want to carry anything out. What's wrong with me? My friend seems to think it has to do with the fact that I'm not fully over R. I don't think so. I think my downward spiral to the point where I've been for the past year had a lot to do with our breakup, but he's so far beyond the reason for my feeling this way anymore. What is it? Why can't I shake it? What is wrong with me? Why am I lifeless?

      Eh, I'm finally done with my first semester of law school! Halle-fucking-lujah! There's so much to tell and I don't really have the energy to tell it, but I'll try. So I guess I've sorta been seeing someone new, first of all. He's Jewish, from Jersey, good kid. I don't know if I trust him completely but hey, it's only been two months and I'm not sure if it's really going anywhere. Um, what else? That's really what's new. I was in the front row for the Dave Matthews Band concert in Madison Square Garden...I made some friends in high places, yes I did! And the place went mad when James Brown came out on stage, so that was very exciting to be a part of. Anyway, I think I'm just being lame because I'm tired, so enjoy this entry till I feel enlightened enough for the next one!

      Yeah, I'm just sitting here...I should be working, right, but I'm tired. I will do work after I let myself have a nappy-poo. Talking to my friend P online, feelin' a little sorry for myself after the grades rolled in, but hey, this is a new semester,and law school is not graded on a curve for the entire three years! So fuck it! I had a great time last night at bar night. I haven't gone out w/o M (the guy I'm dating) in awhile, and I hate to say it, but it was kinda nice. I got to go back to being myself, the social butterfly that I am. Not in terms of dudes and hooking up and shit, but just being me. M isn't nearly as social as I am. I have come to realize that not everyone I go to school with sucks. I have to deal with them for the next three years (well, only two and a half more!), so I'd better just like it, damnit! I was supposed to go to Boston this weekend but the damn car isn't complying. I guess I will get it jumpstarted soon...I have no option in that respect. Stupid Syracuse winters! Anyways, I'm going to try to get into my website (which I can't anymore and I really don't wanna start a brand new one), and chat w/Peejer. I will write more whenever the feelin' hits me!

      Ironically, I am supposed to be working on my "memorial" right now...but it has nothing to do w/dying, although it feels like it. It's a big ass complicated paper about a subject that I'm not familiar enough with (international law...gimme a break, I'm only a 1L!), and life has sucked ever since that word entered my legal vocabulary. So, this is my second semester of hell! And of course, there is always life that is going on around you at the speed of light, namely boys, boys, boys. Gotta get them outta my head! Anyway, back to reading shit I don't even understand...hopefully you'll hear from me again after I've kicked the shit out of this paper.

      Of course I care about both of them and what they think...I don't want either of them to find out about the other, I just need to make a choice between the two and stick to it. The problem is, no matter which one I give up one I am giving up something important. Neither one of them are perfect for me. I guess I'm just having fun and it's not right. I don't believe in cheating, and my longer, more committed relationship is with MH, but I don't believe he's even thinking about being faithful. But technically, I haven't cheated on him since we got back together. I haven't slept with EK and I actually don't have any intentions to do so...but I'm lying to EK so that I can avoid confronting it. I am not a cheater. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself or anyone...I guess I just don't believe that anyone has honest intentions toward me anymore. I don't know...I need to be smarter...I don't do this, this isn't me, and I'm hurting myself the most here.

      Well, I left here (my apartment) on Friday around 5 pm, and I have just now returned. What a long Happy Hour that was, hahahaha! I had a great weekend, overall, except for some minor tiffs here and there. The most fun was Happy Hour, where me and some cool law students (as to be differentiated from the NON-cool law students) ran back and forth from Dorsey's to the Tusk drinking. It was such a motley group of people, which made it all the better. I love hanging out with people who are fun. I love finding out that people are more fun than you thought. Had a semi-fight with MH. He is a very immature person, and I'm not going to sweat it about him anymore. Going to have fun with both him and EK and not think twice about it. My theory is, MH doesn't care about me enough as much as he should, and EK cares about me more than I deserve. So, there you have it! My theory! I guess I could stop this, and I might, but I might not. I don't feel that I'm necessarily wronging anyone but myself, because neither one of them care about me like I needed to be cared for, anyway. So, so, so...I have nothing else to say. I should clean or do some homework or something...I might. It's not really an option, only a question of when the hell should I go up and get my books (they're at school), since it has proceeded to SNOW in the waning days of March. WTF? Anyway, later, gators.

      I am hoping that I can avoid a father-daughter visit this spring break, but seeing as plans for Vegas and LA didn't work out, it looks like that may be the option. Honestly, I could stay home all day long and be content, but that's not healthy, and next week, I'll be really unhappy about doing that. So, I guess I'd better prepare myself for a road trip. I'm gonna buy the Jack Johnson CD to keep me company.

      I don't know what to say. Day 2, same old story. Still heartbroken, still missing him, wishing this didn't happen the way it did. I wish I could trivialize my heartache, but I can't. I wish I could put it into the big picture perspective, but I can't. I fell in love with someone who just couldn't be honest with me, and my heart is broken. He picked someone over me, one of my worst fears. And I don't forgive that. I can't, not after dating J all those many years ago. I called his/my friend R today, and it was good to talk to him. He said he thinks M cared about me more than he cares about this girl Allison, but M just needed to get out of our relationship. I don't know why...I guess maybe he cared too much for his own good and he knew it would never work, I don't know...I know it was never going to work out b/c of the Jewish thing, but I didn't want it to end this way and I didn't want it to end now...I had sex last night, but it shouldn't have happened. It was not good timing, I care about the guy but I'm not ready for this again...but it's not even the sex that has me all in a tizzy. It's the fact that being with anyone new at all just isn't what I want right now. I'm so glad it's spring break. I need this week to heal and be alone or surrounded by people who care about me a lot...God, I wish I could articulate what I'm feeling better, but my pain is just too deep right now. I am going to get ready to eat more sushi...ah...I miss you, Fluffy. I wish you hadn't done what you did :(

      This was me, signed on as him at his house, and I IMed our friend S as him...I shouldn't have done it but I felt that something wasn't right after he told me that he met a girl at the gym (Alison) that he has been calling and sorta seeing (I'm the "f" referred to in the conversation). So, it's over.   S: i think we're going to war in 4 days  M: who knows, maybe  S: bush told israel that he'd give them 4 days notice  M: shit man  S: and today...el al (the israeli airline) shut down  M: shit  S: yeah  S: thus...i think in 4 days  S: war  S: because el al is the safest airline in the world  M: i'd better hurry up and have some sex or something now  S: definately  S: as much as possible  S: go find alison  S: :o)  S: or leight  S: leigh  S: :o)  M: no f?  S: ok  S: her  M: why alison?  S: i thought she was your new friend  M: yeah but should i hook up w ith her?  S: thats up to you  S: i thought you wanted to hook up with everyone  M: what do you think though  M: i mean should i hook up with her again  S: yum  M: what?  S: you're such a playah  S: ;oP  M: wait, did i already tell you i hooked up with alison?  S: no  S: are you broken up with f?  M: no, i didn't hook up with her, i was joking  M: but i told you about her, right?  S: yeah  S: i'm a remebering girl  M: what do you think i should do  S: i remember stuff  M: it has been awhile since i saw her  S: hmmm  S: that's not good  M: i need girl advice  S: ha  M: like, i need some serious advice about what to about f and alison and leigh  S: be nice to f  S: and choose  M: ok  S: you cant have it all  S: you're too nice for that  S: you care  M: but do you think alison likes me?  S: i have never met this chick  M: i thought i told you about her though  S: i'd have to see the interaction  S: that doesnt mean anything  M: do you think i like her?  S: you told me you met her at the gym, she's sexy...and you like her  S: YEAH!  M: but what about f?  S: you arent treating her well  S: you dont wanna be with her  S: but you dont wanna hurt her  S: but no matter what...you will hurt her  M: why?  S: you tell me  M: why do you think that though?  S: think what?  M: that i don't wanna be with her and i'll hurt her  S: you told me  M: i flat out said that?  S: yes   And I haven't talked to him since I left his house, and he never came back to his house after leaving to pick up his friend R.

      Am I in love? How do you figure out if you're in love, FOR SURE? I have been in love before, and I can tell you that this is not like those times. It's not that it's not a strong feeling, because it is, but it's a very guarded feeling. I feel like giving into it may be very bad, and that's why I hold back. But how bad could it be? How wrong is a feeling, even though you know you shouldn't have it? He's Jewish, I'm Arab, it can't and won't work, and it's going to go nowhere. So I ask myself, should I fall in love? Is he in love? Does it matter? Does the fact that this does not compare to the others prohibit me from being in love? Will he fall in love with me? Has he? Is he? It's been 5 months today...it seems quite normal for me to be in love way before this. So, what is holding me back? Is it right? Should I jump? Or should I just walk slowly back down the ladder?

      I don't know what's going on. I don't know what M thinks, I don't know if this is going to work...I want it to but I'm just not sure...I have to go, M wants to use the computer.

      Sometimes I think, "Should I sit here and write when everything is most likely the same as yesterday?" Eh, why not, I suppose. Something has to be different every day, doesn't it? Anyway, so I got laid last night, whoo hoo! M doesn't seem to have the sex drive that I do, and that's always frustrating. But last night he came into the bed, said, "I love you (I don't think there was any way that he was sleeping this time," and I said, "No, you don't," and then we proceeded to get it on. So, if he was sleeping during THAT I-love-you incident, well, then he was also sleeping during sex. I have a hard time believing that's true. So whatever. Anyway, I really think Property is calling my name, and since I have a shitload to review, I'd better hop to it. I took an extended nap today, which wasn't smart but I had no control over that, and so now I should be rearing to go...right? Hmmph. Anyway, laters.

      I AM: getting ready to take a nap before studying. I KNOW: a little bit about the law. I WANT: to be finished with my first year. I HAVE: a lot of studying to do before finals. I WISH: that I would be spending the summer in California. I HATE: the way people have changed in law school. I MISS: the beach and the mountains, and In-n-Out and Jamba Juice! I HEAR: the TV in the living room. I SEARCH: the Internet for something to distract me. I WONDER: if R ever thinks about me like I think about him. I REGRET: letting myself fall into bad relationships that don't satisfy me. I LOVE: R, and M, and being in love. I ACHE: to figure out who I am and what I need for me. I CARE: about everyone and everything and that is way too much! I ALWAYS: feel sleepy and hungry. I AM NOT: easy. I DANCE: when I can! I SING: when I can be alone! I CRY: about the smallest things sometimes, and sometimes I go w/o crying for months. I DO NOT ALWAYS: do what I should be doing. I FIGHT: with myself. I WRITE: very rarely anymore. I WIN: nothing anymore! I LOSE: just about every law school thing I try to do! I CONFUSE: myself and most people I talk to. I LISTEN: with all ears. I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: at M's. I NEED: to sleep now. I AM HAPPY ABOUT: the fact that summer should be fun! I SHOULD: really take that nap...

      I am not sure what I feel like saying...just feeling a little frustrated with everyone and everything. Maybe that's natural, I am not sure. I just want things to be better overall. I want M to say that he loves me, I want him to kiss me more, I want to feel special and important like E claims that I am. Frustrating. I do love him, but do I? I had a long talk with a friend last night at our law firm party...made me think a lot about things...a lot. He says I can't be in love, not yet. But I could, but not the kind of love that makes you head over heels crazy and not the kind of love where even when you're pissed and his true colors come through, you'd still be there. That was only R, and no one is R, and R is gone, and I can't go looking for that in everyone. So. I called R last night, in my drunken frenzy. I have to be less stupid when I'm drinking. I promised myself no talking to him until I was over him, and then I make an ass of myself in a drunken haze? No, no excuse. I asked him stupid questions which he had no answer to...he can't tell me why he isn't in love with me anymore. He can't say anymore than he already has...so what the hell am I looking for? I like my relationship with M, I do, but it's never going to become what I need. At least at this point I don't think so. I like spending time with him, I like knowing him, I like what he brings to my life. But he and I both know that we aren't going to end up together one day (that magical mystical "one day"). So maybe there isn't a point...I dunno. I'm rambling today. I feel like rambling. Honestly, I should just take a nap now. I think I will. And listen to Coldplay. Or download some Chris Cornell. It's a good remedy for a broken heart.

      I'm laying on my back right now, because I'm too tired to sit up. I just finished my own personal Dawson's Creek marathon (thank you, Kazaa!) and I downloaded some stuff from the Internet, like the new Liz Phair CD (thank you, Kat!), and I'm being a bitch and avoiding a friend who I promised I'd go out with tonight. I just didn't feel like it! I know, I know, horrible me, but I have a hard time saying no to friends who wanna go out when I don't. Whatever. I'll send her an e-mail. Um, I think I'm going to Ithaca tomorrow with M...biking or hiking, not sure. To go biking, we'd have to take two cars, and I think that's a bit ridiculous. But hiking, hiking may not be exactly what he had in mind. Whatever. I think I'm gonna write my friend a very apologetic e-mail about how I fell asleep and just woke up (wink wink) and really hit the hay. G'night!

      Since when did dudes become so virtuous? I mean, when did a guy think twice about a hookup and since when did he EVER think about it the next day in terms of, "Oh, I may have done something wrong"? Since when do men give a crap about a good friendship and how hooking up may not be good for it? I mean, when did this little conscience switch happen? Would someone please steer me away from men who think like that? This has happened to me twice now and I'm just about sick of it! I mean, I like a good boy as much as the next person, but when you're living 3000 miles away, a good hookup is in order! You can still have a friendship if you only hook up once a year! What the hell? This is utterly baffling to me. My other question is: am I just not good enough to date? All of these virtuous boys feel guilty for hooking up with me, but 1) they did it! and 2) why don't they like me enough to date me? I realize hookups don't usually turn into relationships but it's not like I am Stranger X. I know these boys, these boys know me, we have mutual respect for each other...so what's up with that? I realize I'm probably asking contradicting questions here...but both situations simply confuse me. Either let me be the girlfriend or the good hookup girl, but pick one and not neither!

      I am going helter skelter in my life right now. I am so out of control. I don't know which way is up and I need to slow down and just THINK! I create this drama that I'm dealing with! Second year of law school has gone so much faster and produced much more personal confusion than ever! I am happier though, especially since I broke up with that good for nothing Mike. What the hell was I thinking? I see him and I am reminded daily that I'm a complete and utter jackass when it comes to choice of males. I am really good at making mistake after mistake, aren't I? When will that stop? I guess the new theme of this school year is trying to screw me...well, not for everyone, but I've gotten propositioned more than I like by dudes with girlfriends. And I'm not down for it, exactly. Who knows. I just want a nice guy to want me for my mind and who I am, not my body. But the worst part is that I have to stop taking that as the only solution to my indifference towards men. I am numb, and I'm scared, because I'm making so many mistakes and I can't snap out of being numb. There is one person who really really touches me in my life right now, but he has a girlfriend of two years and no matter what happens between us, I'll never be more than the "other woman" in his life. And that kills. I hate cheaters. I hate homewreckers. But I just haven't met anyone for almost three years who has affected me and touched my heart the way he does. So how do I reconcile that dream with the reality?

      IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!  I'm 24, and I'm honestly not all that excited about it, but I do love a day that's devoted to just me...and the kazillion other people who are probably born on this day.  Anyway...I'm a little older, but I know I'm not wiser, probably a little fatter, maybe a little happier (than my last birthday!), but yeah...I'm 24.  I am not going to go on and on about how old it seems to me, because in reality, it's not, but I guess I am 24 and I don't think I have my shit together, and I seem to be too old NOT to have my shit together, you know?  Maybe I'm just hallucinating.  I did have a lot of toxins this weekend ;)  It's just that I'm still making the same mistakes that I was making when I was 19, only now I'm in law school and in a lot more debt.  It's scary!  I have to clean our house, eat, and get jumping on homework.  I didn't do anything all weekend, I've just been celebrating.  So I should get to that.  Happy 24th to me!

I am listening to the DMB Central Park show...so much more excellent than I remember!  I was in the back, though, and I didn't get to experience the show in its entirety.

      Hi all!  I am in Toledo now, after a fun and crazy weekend in Kent.  If only we could relive college every weekend and have the same lives that we do now.  We've accomplished so much, but sacrificed so much, too!  I really need my college friends in my life.  I miss them incredibly.  My college friends were my rock, my sounding board, my encouragement.  It's sad that we're all so successful and yet, we all leave a piece of us at Kent State and a piece of our hearts with the other ones. -sigh- It's sad.  But what makes me thrilled is that all of my girls seem happy and successful.  Emily is the main (and only!) photographer for the newspaper in Port Clinton, Kris is enjoying her grad school life at Fordham in the city, Quesa is finishing up soon and has the coolest boy in the world, Jessie is going back to school for design (which will make her happier than what she was doing before!), Lauren is ending old chapters and beginning new ones in Germany (even though it may not be "for months and months"!), Alison is graduating in December and ready for the next step in her relationship (what are you waiting for, Daniel?), Teresa is a nurse at OSU, Petretti is a Spanish major and bursting with energy, Woods is engaged to Paul, Becca has two healthy babies, Alicia is getting into her real estate stuff, Julie Winn is still in marital bliss, Suzy changed her job to something she likes better...I'm just very happy for all my girls, happy that life is treating them well.  But I miss them.  I miss the big group of them and I miss each individual one of them.  I totally see why some people never want to leave...why leave when everyone you need is right there?  And here I was, thinking I was a cold, unfeeling person because I never felt homesick and I never felt the loyalty to any particular place.  Well, I think it's Kent.  I miss it, I miss the times, I know that I couldn't and wouldn't go back but I also know that Kent was good to me.  And it helped me be where I am today, and I owe it and everything that came with it a great deal.  -sigh-  Just feeling a little nostalgic today.  I'm still looking for the contentedness that I had at Kent.  I know I'll find it if I keep searching...I know different chapters in one's life brings different states of mind, and I'm waiting for the next chapter to bring one to lift me up again.  -sigh-

I can't do a damn thing about it while I'm still waiting for the loan company to do something right for a change.

      This is my very first entry in this one (I'm taking everything from my old one at Live Journal and sticking it here).  I'm not sure what this stuff is all about, but I have seen stuff about it a few times today alone, so maybe this is a sign...like the condom I got in the mail today, a sign like that.  But what do they mean?  Hahahaha.  It's way too late for that sort of analysis.  I need to finish reading National Security and go to bed.  It's 3 am and I'm at the point of ridiculousness.

      I could sit here and pretend that I'm actually working on Commercial Transactions, but alas, I'm not.  I'm going to fail this semester miserably if I don't get my sorry ass act together...where is my motivation this year?  Is it because the fear is all gone?  Is it because I just don't care anymore?  What the hell is it?  I wish I could figure it out, but as I sit here, attempting to get a jump start on studying for finals, I find myself more and more interested in anything BUT getting a jump start on finals.  I think I am addicted to the Internet.  Is that possible?  I just like the fact that the light on the Internet is always on, and there's always life out there, and there are always things to learn from the people busily ticking away on their keyboards out there.  I wonder what will replace the Internet, b/c we all know that something has to.  Or maybe it doesn't HAVE to, but it will.  The Internet is ridiculously fabulous, though, no matter how bad it is for me and my studies.  Information all at your fingertips...conversations to be had, confessions to be made...news to be read, opinions to be analyzed...why didn't I go into journalism or something like that?  I need some ACTION in my life, and I don't mean in my bedroom (b/c frankly, I'm perfectly happy with that aspect!).  -sigh-  I should return to the wonderful world of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  I'm gonna.  I'll see ya 'round.

      This heaviness in my heart just won't go away.  I started off Monday in such high spirits and everything seemed to be so wonderful.  What happened?  Was it X?  I don't know.  I just know that I'm heavy.  I went to hang out with J and B to watch some Monday night football with them.  It was nice to talk to some guys who respect me and care about me, and would never hurt me intentionally...or even unintentionally, for that matter.  Why is it that my friends are so good to me and I have so many friends, but there are those few who fall outside of the spectrum and they just can't treat me the way I deserve to be treated?  My friends at school treat me like a queen, and I, of course, treat them accordingly.  I treat everyone with such respect...and that's what I get in return.  But X, why doesn't he see that?  Why doesn't he see what everyone else sees?  On Friday, I asked him, "C tells me that everyone in the school seems to want me, and yet, you have me, and you don't want me."  And he made this face like, "Are you crazy?  Of course I want you," and I think he said something like, "Whaaaat?" maybe.  I don't know.  I just can't expect much of him, I can't.  I knew what I was getting into and I can't expect to be the girlfriend.  But can I get something?  Why am I agonizing over this?  It's nothing and it never will be anything!  I knew that from the get-go!  So why?  Why did I willingly entangle myself in this?  For lust?  For hopefully one day?  If someone would've told me this was where things would be 2 months later, I honestly STILL wouldn't have done anything differently!  Why am I so damn self-destructive?

      So, my heart is mildly broken.  I have boys throwing their girlfriends in my face, and I don't really need to deal with that right now.  C'mon!  You know what the right and wrong things to say are...you know that you know!  Hmph.  Trying to decide whether it's a good idea to go out tonight and drink my cares away or stay at home and wallow in my sorrow.  Hmm, choices, choices.  I'm dreading going home for Thanksgiving.  Call me bitchy, but I don't want to deal with it.  I am fine being there when I'm there but it's hard to get me to go and hang out with people and shit.  I dunno, whatever, whatever.  I am so random right now b/c I had a disturbing incident with a girlfriend mention that I'm just not interested in right now.  Ugh.  So...what should I talk about?  I have nothing good to say.  I have pretty much ruled out the option of work for tonight.  I will be doing enough of that over break.  I think I may fly home on Thanksgiving Day and leave on Saturday morning.  Who the fuck cares anymore?  I am very upset, actually.  I shouldn't lie.  I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect to be intentionally upset.  He knows that he can't say those things to me!  He knows that I don't want to make her a reality in my world!  I have told him that.  That was so advertant and I don't understand why.  Man, I really DO think too much.  Why?  Why am I cursed with a brain that thinks so much?

      I want someone to go out to dinner w/me.  I don't understand why I can't get a single damn person to have dinner with me!  WTF?  I was supposed to have dinner with B, but B said today that this "probably wasn't a good night."  Fine.  So I call F.  F said he has dinner plans with C.  I said, "Why don't you and C just come with me?" and he said, "I don't know about that."  FUCK OFF!  What the hell?  Ugh!  So now I'm stuck here with an appetite and my roommate's crackers.  How is this possible?  I am so much fun to eat dinner with!  It's not even like it's a date...it's FOOD!  Fuckin' fuckin' a.  I don't need a partner to eat dinner with, but since I had planned to go out to dinner tonight, and B decided it wasn't a good night (blah blah blah), I was hoping to have dinner with some sort of companionship tonight.  No damn dice.  Freakish boys out there.  A girl wants to go to dinner with you...YOU SAY YES!  I don't think law school boys are even boys.  They're like half-girls.  The girls in law school have more balls than the dudes.  RIDICULOUS.  Can you tell I'm just a little damn IRRITATED right now?  UGH.

But all in all, I'm happy and healthy and ready to get to work...I guess...

      Hmmmph.  I am about to start getting ready to go out tonight, and I'm a little wary of drinking.  Granted, I went out last night and drank and all went well, but that's because I drove.  I had C with me and there's no way I could let things get out of hand.  But I don't know if I'm driving tonight...I don't know if I want to.  And I'm a little nervous about that.  I am just a little nervous about going out and not having a good time the way I want to have it.  I dunno.  I think too much.  That is obvious to everyone.  But I think after last weekend's episode, I'd better start thinking a little more, wouldn't you say?  Who knows.  Anyone, laterz...I'm gonna finish up some IM conversations and get ready.

      I think I drink too much.  And I think I have figured out why I do it.  Because I am trying to escape from my head.  And when I'm drinking, I realize that I cannot escape myself by drinking, so I drink more, and I try to drown out what's in my head by flooding it with toxins.  That leaves me drunk, afraid because I'm not in control of things anymore, and dependent on someone to take care of me.  And of course, hungover the next day.  I have made phone calls to my friends (well, actually, guys that I have either dated or are currently "involved" with) because I'm so scared about what I've done to myself.  It's terrible.  I don't know why I don't have any self-control as of late.  It wasn't always like this.  And I'm so glad that B took me home in a cab yesterday.  If my car had been home, I would've driven it.  I don't know why.  I could probably think of some reasons...a certain person I wanted to see that I knew was still awake...but I would've done it.  I don't know when this started...maybe when I started this thing with X?  I don't know.  After M?  When did I start not wanting to be me so badly?  I have to lay down.  I'm still suffering from my recent attempts to extract my head from myself.

      Okay, okay, I'll just post something already.  I had a great weekend.  Hung out with F and his friends on Thursday night at Faegan's...man, I love 1Ls...and we all (except the sober driver J, of course) got piss ass wasted, freakin' awesome.  I had a great time that night, let's just leave it at that.  Friday I went out with my 2L "summer boys," as I call them, b/c I got pretty close with them this summer but haven't seen much of them outside of school when the actual school year started up again.  GAWD, I loooooove those boys!  I have nothing but a great time when I hang out with them.  I always end up drunk really early and I go home alone, but aside from those two things, I have no complaints.  They are some of the most fun, quality dudes I know.  Saturday...hmmm, what was Saturday?  Saturday I was getting ready for the mommy to make her appearance in Syracuse.  Got in a fight with the roommate on Sunday, a screaming and yelling fight, interesting.  And then here I am, trying to work on CT.  Ugh.  I guess I could sit online all day and avoid it, but honestly, the UCC is calling my name and I have quite a few more statutory provisions to get through in order to attempt to be caught up for tomorrow's class.  Not to mention I'm taking mommy-mo to the airport reaaaaaaaally early in the morning.  So here I go...bye bye, don't miss me too much.

      Lovely evening it is. I have done no homework tonight. And sure, I feel guilty, but I'm planning on waking up at about 5 am and doing what I gotsta. I'm just deep in thought right now. Maybe I could attribute this to the lack of sleep...I dunno. What I do know is that I've been thinking a lot about R lately. Just how everything in that relationship was exactly how I thought things were SUPPOSED to be in a good relationship. Everything. And things like that aren't SUPPOSED to end. Am I ever going to find love comparable to that again? Or should I settle? Or should I live the single life for the rest of my life? It's a ponderable question. I just don't know. Anyway, enough thinking. It makes me sad to dwell on it. 'Night.

I HAVE: a bloated tummy. I WISH: that my dating situation shapes up in 2004. I HATE: the fact that no matter how far ahead I think I am, I am usually wrong. I MISS: my friends in Syracuse! I HEAR: some infomercial on TV. I SEARCH: for that "one true love." I WONDER: if that "one true love" will ever happen to me. I REGRET: leaving LA. I LOVE: not having anything to do. I ACHE: to find my real love. I CARE: about too many things! I ALWAYS: feel tired, no matter what I'm doing. I AM NOT: as happy as you think I am. I DANCE: anytime, any place, when the feeling strikes me! I SING: in the car, where no one can hear me! I CRY: at stupid things. I DO NOT ALWAYS: brush my teeth and wash my face before bed. I FIGHT: with my roommate quite a bit. I WRITE: random poems when I'm procrastinating. I WIN: everyday just by being alive and smiling. I LOSE: my mind sometimes when it comes to X. I CONFUSE: love and lust. I LISTEN: to what my mother says, if she says it the right way. I CAN USUALLY BE FOUND: in front of the computer in my apartment...or the bar. I NEED: to lose a few pounds. I AM HAPPY ABOUT: the fact that I'm halfway finished with law school. I SHOULD: get right on job searching over break.  Argh.  So tired.  I had good intentions of spilling my guts (or something like it), but I think I'm too tired.  I honestly don't have one interesting thing to say, but I think I'm just bored.  Ahhh, BORED!  What a lovely concept!  I have already watched three movies (well, part of Seabiscuit, so four) in the span of about 30 hours.  That's so unlike me and sooooo refreshing!  I haven't had an ounce of alcohol and I haven't had a shower, either.  Sometimes I wish I could be a hermit and not care about seeing people or being social.  I should just live at home and let my mind turn to mush and enjoy it!  Look what law school has done to me...made me fantasize about being a good-for-nothing!  My soul is just tired, that's all.  And it's up to me to save it.  I never want kids, I really don't.  I'm 24 and they still make me cringe.  I just want to find my soulmate and live a beautiful life with him.  I wonder where he is...I think I may have worn myself thin with all of the sex I had this past semester.  Every boy I slept with (except 1) had a girlfriend.  I am a despicable person.  My friend C was reading this article in an old Cosmo called, "I Sleep With Your Boyfriend."  Basically, it explains why girlfriended boys seek single girls like us out.  It's supposedly because we are what their girlfriends aren't.  Maybe they can't admit to themselves that their girlfriends aren't enough or maybe they take personal responsibility for it.  Either way, there's something lacking and they see girls who represent the antithesis of their girlfriends, and they're drawn.  I swear I have not pursued any of these boys.  I promise I didn't.  I don't know why they are drawn to me in particular.  Maybe that'll change next semester.  Maybe I will.  And maybe it'll all stay the same and that's that.  I dunno.  My friend R says I have to save my soul.  But am I really affecting my soul this way, or just being young and having fun?  I have a great time, and I'm detached from all of them except X.  Maybe it's X that I need to save my soul from, not the others that are just sex for sex.  -sigh-  I don't wanna think about this.  MERRY CHRISTMAS!

      So...exams are over for everyone (except the 1Ls).  I don't know.  I'm going home tomorrow.  I feel strange.  Just a little empty, a little happy, a little wiser.  I am not in the mood to go home.  I couldn't go to the funeral today, no flight availability.  I don't want to be single anymore, I don't think.  I'm not sure.  I am just tired of looking forward to something that isn't gonna happen.  I don't know how to explain this.  I feel like I'm waiting for life to start...school keeps me waiting, waiting, waiting...but will it happen?  And if it does, will I be happy?  And why isn't this the "life" I'm waiting for?  -sigh-  I have nothing of any interest or substance to talk about.  I'm fighting with my roommate because I think he's stealing my things.  It makes me feel really insecure and upset inside.  I feel like I can't trust him.  And that upsets me a lot.  All he does is come back on the defensive and then what can I do?  -sigh-  It's hard to conduct an argument between two law students.  Especially a self-righteous one like him.  Anyways...back to cleaning.

      So, what's up?  I'm finally finished with school for the year.  Life has definitely not been dealing me berries lately, though.  One of the closest people to me just suffered a huge loss in her family.  Her father and sister were killed in a plane crash on Wednesday, December 17.  Her uncle was flying it, and her sister was returning home from Spain to spend Christmas with her family and introduce them to her boyfriend, Jose.  I had a really hard time coping with the news, because I just felt so much pain for Tracy and her family.  Yesterday I found out that they died from the crash, so I'm pretty sure that means that they didn't suffer afterwards.  That gave me a little bit of solace.  I am reading about the service right now, and I'm going to get on the phone with my mother to see if I can go (it's on Monday).  I will write later.

      Hmmmm...so it's gonna be damn cold tonight.  And I guess it looks like I'm gonna stay home.  I wanna go out.  I wanna have some fun fun fun.  It's about time...I haven't had any fun since New Year's Eve (but what a fun night that was).  I love starting my weekends on Thursdays at 11:15 am.  I have been a good girl, because I'm going to be getting this present for 15 weeks straight.  Ahhhhh.  Okay, I guess I'm going to return to my Sex and the City marathon...wish me luck for some trouble tonight or tomorrow! ;)

      So I'm feeling low.  Just got in a fight with P.  I don't know why...I'm not overly emotional or anything, I just assumed that he would always be upfront and honest with me, but I feel like he's playing with my feelings.  I like him, he knows that.  Maybe sometimes I don't even know that, but he does know.  It's just that I'm cautious with my feelings b/c I know he's going to hurt me.  And he already has, and he will continue to do so.  It's so fucking complicated.  If I knew that he wasn't just spitting game at me, I'd probably melt for him.  But I know he is and I know he will never stop doing that as long as he knows me...so what am I supposed to do?  Fall for him and get hurt every time?  I don't think so.  Ugh, I am not even making sense to myself.  I need to rest some more.  I am just crabby and pissed off and frustrated with the way I reacted.  Ugh ugh ugh.

      Goddamnit, it's very frustrating living with someone who takes your things without asking, drinks your WINE without so much as a mention, is irrational for no apparent reason except the fact that he's a jerk who's mother never disciplined him, and is inconsiderate in every possible way.  And he's not even my boyfriend, he's my fucking roommate.  "I like living with you, I think we live well together."  Yeah, because you do SHIT!  I am not sure if I can handle this for another year, damnit.  I really really don't know if I can.

      There is a wasp in my room.  My cat is very angry that I won't let him back in here.  I am really freakin' afraid of wasps.  Maybe it's a hornet.  I actually don't know the difference and I frankly don't care.  They can both sting me and that signals only bad news to me.  It's fucking big.  I'm tempted to wake up my roommate 'cause he always kills them for me.  I think I may cry if I have to kill it myself.  Or freak out.  It's not that I'm afraid of bugs, it's that I'm afraid of stinging bugs.  Stinging, flying bugs.  I have never been stung before and so...yeah, so I don't want to be.  Crrrrraaaaap.  P just IMed me.  Must go.

      REALLY (written in 2003, copyright 2004 Me.) I sat down and tried to write a letter to your memory My pen wouldn't get past the puddles collecting pools of never-beens And every time I want to take a hard look in the mirror My mind just slides back to you instead Voices knocking at my door, but I refuse to answer 'Cause I'm naked and shivering on the bathroom floor And life is still refusing to hand me my dinner So I'll be licking photographs instead Now, who is the man who told me to trust my own shadow? I never gave it more thought than right now Because it follows me everywhere, and dances with the sunlight But I can't find it when I'm looking 'round He will sit and turn to me, he likes me more than some things But I just cry into the couch's arm He says, "Little baby, can you tell me what's the matter?" I just close my eyes till he's gone Turning, chilling, jumping, yes my throat is still on fire Is there something else I should be seeing? Brits and pies and brandywine, oh yes, I must be bleeding Culture and popularity So feed me just one love affair that leaves me much too full Help me grapple with the blues and whites There's always one more gentleman that I should be misleading Lest the devils militate my mind

      BAREBONED (written in 1998, copyright 2004 Me.) My face is glistening with diamonds of pain And the cavern of my heart deepens at your name The star of my sky chased me insane Just because you preferred the downpour to the rain A white aisle of hope was waiting for you and I So in this equation, there lacked the curse of goodbye But the lure of lust sent temptation to ripen your eye And your heartless blunders deemed you to lie My visual sphere keeps fond memories of you Although I prayed for the absence of a heart untrue Away from my island you steered your crew And while you were at sea, I was forever yours, you knew I never doubted your hazel deceptions of divinity Doused in fantasy, I handed my love and virginity On this cloud, no, it couldn't be just you and me And with the light took my dream of infinity But your tears caress me like broken glass And weaken me with the anticipation that this will pass We're still hovering at the scene of the crash But this love from your sorrow will wilt into ash As I relent to the slivers in my skin I wonder why I haven't torn thin The state of numb that I'm dwelling in Begs me to dismiss your sin King of Hearts, mine has had enough Hot pokers don't extinguish the love The strength I possess that I've heard so much of Can't keep me from cascading for this gift from above I have set it free, though it isn't what I want I thought I'd won that scavenger hunt A disheveled heart just newly gaunt Leaves me looking in the rearview with a gallon of daunt

      I'm obviously watching Passions.  Anyways, I hate to say it, but the "Washingtonienne" saga has inspired a journal name change, but for two reasons.  1) "Washingtonienne" sounds really cool and 2) it is *very* important to maintain anonymity in these blog entries!  So anyways, I think that's important to note.  I thought I had enough energy to write about this weekend, but I actually don't, so I'm going to sleep.  I seriously need a nap.  I've slept about 6 hours in the past two days.  I've thoroughly enjoyed my days, regardless, but I cannot stay awake any longer!

      I'm watching Friends.  I'm exhausted.  I woke up early today for two wasted hours of work (i.e., "orientation").  I hate being broke and I hate working!  I hate my face, it's breaking out like mad because of all the worrying.  I wanna go out and drink but I don't really have money for that.  I am listening to the awful background music of one of No Doubt's very first singles, "Trapped in a Box."  I wanna kill myself, or the radio.  I think I'm going to nap.  I have nothing really exciting to say except, oh yes, funny story!  I was talking to my ex JB (well, actually, he came over here and we drank some beers and talked), and he happened to tell me that MP, who I hooked up with the last time I was home, worked as a maintenance man in a warehouse and never went to college (and if he did, he never graduated).  Funny, 'cause he told me he was going to go to MED SCHOOL in a year!  What a fool!  Did he really think he had to lie?  And did he *really* think I wouldn't find out?  Ha!  Idiot!  I mean, I'd still hook up with him again, but I'm totally confronting him!  I mean, he could be a slimesucker and I would've hooked up with him if I'd already made up my mind that I wanted to...it's not like he has a chance of marrying me or anything.  Oh, amusing, amusing hometown boys.

      That subject line is from Jay Leno trying to be a smartass about John Kerry.  Whatever.  Haven't we learned our lesson?  Yes, both Gore and Bush sucked in 2000, but look where we are thanks to Bush?  Whatever.  I can't shake this feeling that I made the wrong choice of law schools.  I should've gone to Seattle.  I know there's nothing I can do about it now, decision has been made.  But I guess I still think about what it would've been like, had I gone to Seattle instead.  Today was the most boring day EVER.  Ugh.  I don't know why I didn't do a damn thing, but I just didn't want to.  I work tomorrow.  First day at Lonestar.  Whoopee.  I really hate working.  I need the money, which makes it even more the worse.  *sigh*  I've been doing this a lot.  Sighing.  I wanna go out tonight, but no one's here to go out with.  Next weekend, I am going to a stupid family wedding.  Great.  The cousin getting married is my age.  What do you think I'm going to be listening to all weekend?  "When are *you* getting married, honey?"  "Why aren't *you* married?"  "Aren't you a little *old* to still be single?"  I am not ashamed of it, but honestly, I never thought I'd be one of the last ones to settle down.  I mean, even R is getting married before me...she could barely get boys to date her in the past!  This isn't something I'm just making up out of jealousy, either.  She will attest to its truth.  The first friend of mine from home to get married never even *kissed* another boy!  I mean, honestly?  Is there something wrong with me?  I think I'm just not the marrying type.  I travel too much, my ambitions are way too high, I am not a compromiser...I guess I've dug my own anti-wife grave.  Oh well.  If I had to do anything against my will right now, I'd rather shoot myself.  I'm not ready to be buying houses and talking about things in terms of "we" and joint checking accounts and shit.  UGH!  Gag me, no thanks!  Alright, I'm going to have IM conversations now.

      So I'm reading about the DeWine staffer from Syracuse who was sleeping with six "higher-ups" in DC.  There's  urlLink a reproduction of her blog online , and it's absolutely fascinating.  I mean, if this is legit, it's amazing.  I am amazed by this chick's lifestyle...but I totally don't put it past a Syracuse girl to do that.  Amazing what some people will do for money.  She says some funny things in her blog, like, "Who can live on $25,000?" and then says something about how everyone must be doing some freaky shit.  Yeah, sweetie, but probably not like that!  Ha!  I'll update my own life's blog in a bit, but for now, I'm gonna read about this hookerneck's exploits.

      This Tori song always reminds me of FS.  I love the lyrics..."How could I resist? You are desire. When it all is said, said and done, who could love you and still be standing?"  Even still, he's still the most beautiful (asshole) I've ever laid eyes on.  From a purely physical standpoint, I have *never* been with someone so beautiful.  Wow.  He is completely amazing to look at, to touch, to kiss, to feel...so it's just fitting that his poison was the hardest to swallow, too.  you caught me lingering  in another girl's paradise  the way she paints the world i want that in my life  emeralds, you should know,  are renting in her meadow  with a stroke beauty lives  *how could i resist you are desire*  *when it all is said, said and done*  *who can love you and still be standing* there's mary calling up a storm  *can i take from you and not keep taking* naked as day gemma follows him  *does it all come down* *to the thing one girl fears in the night* *is another girl's paradise* through twists and turns  jasmine foxed me in her grove  arms filled with honey-bells,  st. michael's sanford bloods  "you have come to discover what you want"  *what i want is not to want what isn't mine* "but i am desire" when it all is said and done.  is another girl  is another girl  is another girl's paradise

      I just got off the phone with my sister M.  What a hilarious conversation!  She started off telling me about how everyone in her class hates her and they won't talk to her and stuff.  She told me about these two boys who pick their noses and "scream around," and she also told me about how they "show each other their underwear (and I told her there's a word for that, but she'll find out about that when she's older)," but the funny part is when she went into describing her "crush."  M told me about this boy who's older ("he must be in fourth grade because he's taller than me and two of my friends"), who she thinks is so "cute" and "awesome" and she can't talk to him because she's too shy.  So I suggested just walking up to him and talking to him, and she said, "He's soooooo nice, he's just soooooo nice, I can't."  So then I suggested writing him a note, and she said, "Well, I don't write adult and he probably does, so that wouldn't work either."  As if they speak different languages or something!  Man, I thought I was going to pee my pants, but I didn't want her to think I wasn't taking her seriously.  Besides, she was talking about "love" and stuff like that, so I am sure she was serious (although she doesn't know his name, he just rides her bus).  She was talking about him like a "man" and stuff, not anything too mature for a five-year old, but I don't know where she was getting these things.  I think she watches too much adult TV!  Anyways, just thought I'd share...one day I will tell her that story and we'll all get a good laugh out of it.  Kids are funny.

      So, my weekend...went to law school graduation (I have one more year, so not mine).  It was, to be frank, anti-climatic.  Didn't feel like graduation, didn't feel like people were as pumped about it as they should be...a big fat letdown overall.  And I haven't really gotten to hang out with PB for a week now, so I'm just gonna get my stuff together and go home.  I know nothing will happen between us and he's just going to move away and that'll be that.  I'll miss him but apparently nothing was meant to happen...

      So...yesterday was the Spring Fling.  I had a good time, but I was hoping a certain someone would show up (who never did).  I wanted to talk to a certain person, but never really had the right setting.  And I was sort of hoping for a reconciliation with another person, just to end the year properly (which never happened).  That being said, I still had a great time.  We went straight there early on, around 9:30-ish, hoping to eat pizza (which ended up being gross anyway) and get tanked on the free beer.  Mission accomplished!  I don't know how much I drank but I know that I definitely had like three shots, too...ewww, Jager, just remembering that makes my head spin.  Whoa.  Is my head really spinning?  I'm definitely hungover and I'll tell you one thing: I'm definitely drinkin' tonight!  Anyways, so I had a couple people confess their love to me and I definitely confessed my love to my "1L boyfriend," as I call him...all of which were rejected advances.  *sigh (for me)*  My friends (a couple) got in a fight 'cause some girl grabbed his face and kissed him on the cheek and she thought more was going to happen so she was freaked and left (don't blame her, he doesn't do anything to alleviate jealousy...I know, I used to date him).    Here's a snippet of an IM conversation that I had when I got home yesterday:  K (2:27:51 AM): and cause i'm REALLY drunk K (2:27:58 AM): i'll tell yo a secret K (2:28:02 AM): i really want you K (2:28:07 AM): i can still smell you on me K (2:28:14 AM): and it hurts that you're not here K (2:28:15 AM): oh well K (2:28:18 AM): i'm not that lucky F (2:42:20 AM): hi silly [snip] K (2:47:13 AM): you're hot, what can i say [snip] K (2:47:40 AM): look, i don't dance, and i danced with yo twice [snip] K (2:49:02 AM): you looked so good [snip] K (2:49:38 AM): g had to drag me to dance, and i ran to dance with you F (2:50:01 AM): Hahahahahaha, g is much cooler and hotter K (2:50:13 AM): noooooooooooooooooooooooo K (2:50:27 AM): i'd rather have yo K (2:50:33 AM): but i don't count F (2:50:39 AM): What are you talking about? K (2:50:47 AM): i don't count K (2:50:54 AM): nothing i say or want matters F (2:51:54 AM): what are you talking about?

K (2:54:24 AM): i wanna be with you F (2:54:41 AM): you're just talking out of drunkeness K (2:54:51 AM): true, but i really do K (2:54:54 AM): when i'm sober K (2:55:00 AM): i just don't have the guts to say K (2:55:35 AM): i just wish i could kiss you once K (2:55:40 AM): cause K (2:55:44 AM): you're the kind of girl i like K (2:55:51 AM): and i like you aside from everything K (2:56:04 AM): but the one real relationship i had in my life K (2:56:11 AM): was with a girl e xactly liek you K (2:56:12 AM): so yeah K (2:56:14 AM): i'm drunk K (2:56:19 AM): but take this as a major compliment K (2:56:30 AM): i really wish i could've kissed you F (2:56:39 AM): How do you know? F (2:56:51 AM): I mean how do you know I"m like the girl you used to date?

I dropped his hand and walked in the other direction.  So I got that IM whe I came home and I was like, "Uh, duh!"  Drama drama.  And I have yet to find out what happened with this random IM I got from my friend C when I woke up this morning: C (6:35:19 AM): OMG C (6:35:22 AM): I AM SO STUPID  So...that sums up the night.  I danced, I drank, I flirted, I ate, I worked the door (although I definitely didn't have to) and I had a good time overall.  Here's to more drunken debauchery tonight! ;)  Cheers!

      Due to the beauty of the fact that I've just finished my second year of law school, I have decided to post YET AGAIN, for the third time today.  I honestly don't think anyone's complaining anyway.  I have been waiting months and months to just sit down and spill my heart, so why don't I just indulge myself, just this once?  So, ahhhh.  Time to reflect on the mess that was my second year.  Well, I started off being everyone's lust object and indulging in those desires, then I realized I more than lusted for someone who definitely was not more than lusting back.  He ended up making some lame excuse and making a quick getaway, only to find out later that he was fucking a friend of mine at the same time!  No sweat off his back!  Then I went to Puerto Rico with the sister, after almost sex-free months...then I came back, spiraled out of control one weekend, and I'll pay for it forever.  But it helped me realize that it's time to grow up, time to stop thinking that some acts are merely games.  I then met someone who'd been right under my nose all along, only to be faced with the fact that oh, graduation is near, and oh, he's moving to Florida!  Oh, and yeah, one of us still has yet to make a move...with less than 10 days to go!  And that's just my love life we're talking about!  If we wanna go deeper, I dealt with a backstabbing friend who has no respect for me whatsoever (and now it's just a matter of time until I completely burst and tell him the fuck off), I made a friend in a girl out of circumstances that I don't completely like (and who I also don't completely trust, as she *is* always running after the boys I seem to like), I cut off a friendship with someone when I couldn't handle the fact that we were not going to be in a pseudo-relationship anymore (here-but-not-here girlfriends...and then some!), I compromised my values but I enjoyed doing it (for the most part), and I realize that some feelings are better ignored instead of trying to fight them anymore.  I realized that maybe there actually might be someone out there for me, but it's not here, and it's probably not R, and it's probably not someone I know right now...but I love to think about the boys I *do* know and wonder...PZ being one.  I moved in with my best friend, but we are remaining here in this apartment as more of acquaintances than anything.  I realized who I could trust and who I really can't (but isn't that an epiphany that occurs yearly?).  I didn't travel nearly enough, but I will have the Next Great Intern Adventure this summer in DC.  I hooked up with someone from high school that was symbolic of the most unfinished business of my past more than anything.  What's with me saying "than anything" a lot today?  I must still be in a comparative analysis mindset from that damn paper I turned in yesterday.  I bonded with my mom over the most unlikely event, I watched both my mother and sister get engaged, and then my sister get unengaged (is that a word?) and realize that she could do much better than she was letting herself see.  I finally cut off my ties (in general) with a group of girls who were supposed to be my best friends...but really aren't.  I cried too much over nothing (as I always seem to), and I thought too much about everything (another regular me thing).  I've cursed law school up and down and bemoaned my terrible choice of higher education, but I'm going to pull through for the last year, because I have to.  I didn't do as well as I should with keeping in touch with friends, but they know I love them, I know they know.  I was a better "girl's girl" this year, and I pride myself on that...after all, my real friends are HERE, and nowhere else, save maybe NYC (A, K) and my sister and my mom.  So...that is me, that is life, that is my year in review.  I am terrified of my third year in law school, but you just have to roll with the punches, right?  I'll make it.  I always do.  I've made it this far...I'm not gonna lose it.

      I have had two of the most random days ever.  Wednesday I went out looking for a job, and I'd filled out a few applications, and I came to this Italian restaurant, Sorriso.  I went in and asked if they were hiring and the bartender (Karen) said she'd ask the owner.  The owner came over and I asked him myself and he said he'd look for applications, so I just took a seat and waited.  At the end of the bar was this old guy (Jack) who wanted to buy me a drink.  I protested (I honestly don't like taking anything from anyone I don't know...there are always strings attached), but after awhile I just accepted.  I was sitting there talking to everyone who works there (bartender, owner's daughter, the assistant to the manager, etc.), and the owner came back and said, "So, when can you start?" and I told him tomorrow, and he said fine, come in.  I hadn't filled out an application or anything!  And then the guy at the end of the bar insisted on buying me dinner.  And then the bartender kept refilling my drink...and it's all been downhill from there ever since.  Yesterday I worked and went out with them afterwards (despite my protests), stayed out until 3:00 am (I only had to be at work at 9:00 am this morning, no worries), and seemed to manage to make the Jewish 33-year old want me.  All in one night.  I have to get to work now, but whoa.  Odd turn of events in my neighborhood.  All I know is that I need a sugar daddy in this town, a nice, temporary one, who will pay for my shit and take me out to dinner.  I've never been that way but this summer I'm broke as a joke and I am not ashamed to admit it...and do what every other sleazy girl would do if she couldn't pay for things herself!

      ...in Washington, D.C.!  It's the truth!  And we all do nothing but e-mail all day.  I mean, I'm reading stuff right now, and apparently I'll be getting an assignment on some topic that I'm to write an admissibility report on (see  urlLink my internship's website ), but as of right now, just reading, reading, and more reading for me.  Some in Spanish, more in English.  Good practice, not so exciting stuff...stuff that I've read over and over again!

      So I'm waxing nostalgic.  This happens when I end up digging through my old garbagesque memories here.  I have come so far since my last academic hurrah as a high school senior here.  I have left, I have come back, only to realize I shouldn't have left, and then I went again.  So many people come back, so many people never leave.  Why do they try to rekindle a dead past?  Things are the way they are, we have changed, things can't be like they once were.  But then I think: wow, our friendships have really grown since then.  As I was wiping away tears after looking at the last picture from our last VDP dinners (although two members had broken the official rules at that point) and remembering how empty I felt when RM said her last goodbye before I went to college...I start to wonder, "Why can't it be that way again?"  When EL and I were still great friends, when RM cared enough about me to call me a million times a day (and she always had something new to say)...why isn't it like that anymore?  Is that what people are looking for when they come back here, that past sense of security and friendship?  Can we go back to that or am I the only one who believes that it's lost?  Why do I always just feel sad about these old times?  Is it the "end of the innocence" for me, in a sense?  Am I subconsciously longing for what used to be?  I know I don't long for it when I'm not here.  What is it about this place?  I'm not sorry I reached for more.  I guess I just miss my relationships.  I miss the sweetness of the way things used to be...although then, I would completely argue with you about them being sweet, that's for sure.  I dunno.  I look into the eyes of those 17-year olds at AfterProm and think to myself, "I'll bet they never imagined who they'd be in 7 years."  I look at myself and wish for that innocence and optimism again.  I mean, I'm a pessimist by no means, but I guess I'm more of a realist than I ever dreamed I'd be, and I'm not so sure I'm proud of that.  That's the law school effect, I suppose.  I guess I'm gonna do some online newsgrouping now.  Just finished Lolita and wondering if I should start The DaVinci Code or Nobody's Fool.  I'll probably start with whatever one I'm in the mood for.  All I know is that I need more action after that listless Lolita.  Well-written, dragged on.  Props to Nabakov for his mastery of the English language, but ack!  Readers, hope you can tolerate long-windedness!

      6769: i dunno what if he changes? 6769: what if he does? 6769: i know it's far out  It's not just far out, it's IMPOSSIBLE!  I LOATHE hearing those words out of girls' mouths.  "Maybe he'll change," blah blah blah.  STUFF IT!  He's not changing, 'cause if he was gonna change, he damn fucking would've already!  *sigh*  Please punch me if I ever say those words.  Don't let me be a stupid, starstruck, idiotic girl who is willing to return to a stupid fucking relationship based on the "he'll change" premise!  I know I'm boy crazy, but I'm not all about boys every waking second of the day, am I?  I certainly hope not.  I don't mind boys being a part of my life, and I don't mind them being a big part of my life, but becoming a complete assface because of them?  Count me out!  *sigh*  My friends all hung out last night, and went to this girl SE's house that she bought not too long ago.  I asked my friend AO what everyone did afterwards, and she said, "Well, RO and I just went home, but RM and CF went to Jed's..." and I was thinking, "Well, no need to call me, I'll just be at home in my non-paired up existence."  Then I realized, when you have another person that constitutes an "us" or a "we," the rest of the world just doesn't matter.  You don't really *need* anyone else...and you don't see that you don't need anyone else, either.  Love makes you blind in ways that aren't always good.  When all of my friends are married, who will remember me?  I will still exist in my singleton (to borrow Bridget Jones terminology) life, doing singleton things, thinking singleton thoughts, and will be completely happy doing it until I am reminded by my the smug marrieds (again B. Jones) that I should be unhappy being alone.  *sigh*  I don't want to be the runt of the pack my whole life.  I mean, I guess I'm a pioneer in some sense (namely education-wise), but in terms of growing up, why do I feel like people view me as light-years behind everyone else?  Ack, what am I saying?  What is all this garbage in my head?  It's the Midwestern influence, weddings and marriage and proposals. This life is not for me, and I have nothing to be ashamed of.  Can I get a w00t on that?  I'm sick of vent blogging.  I'm going to try to focus on more, um, productive things, like, um, I don't know.  But I don't wanna be bitter for the rest of the night so I think I'll just sleep it off.  'Night.

      Yet I'm still awake, since I've been sleeping all day.  And what I need is to sleep, since I have to wake up and go to work tomorrow.  Twice.  At Lonestar and Amigo's.  All this stress lately is driving me crazy.  In other news, is it stupid for me to be developing (or rekindling) a crush on MP?  We hooked up a few nights ago, and I have actually been looking forward to it since I got here.  I have been thinking of him.  It's pathetic, I know, but I guess boys at home are just the excitement I need.  Anyways, I'm too physically exhausted to analyze this.  Good night.

      ...and I'm not getting maaaaaarried!  Been thinking about this marriage thing a lot lately.  Ever since I got home, actually.  It's 'cause I'm here in Toledo, that's why.  And when I hang out in Toledo, it seems that EVERYONE is engaged, married, having children, or in serious relationships that are well on their way to marriage.  I am not ready.  Is that okay, world?  Is that okay conservative, baby-making, Midwestern society?  I don't want children, I don't want to discuss the mortgage, I don't want to commit to someone just because I think that's the next step in life.  I don't!  Is that okay?  Can I do that?  I mean, I am seeing the most random people getting married.  I mean, these people couldn't get dates in high school as far as I can remember, and now they're getting married?  I mean, they were and are wonderful people, but are they marrying the first thing that comes along?  I am not willing to do that.  I know there's better out there, I know it.  Am I the fool for believing that?  Man.  I hate how Toledo does this to me.

      Thank you. I am honored to share the podium with my Senator, though I think I should be introducing her. I’m proud of her and so grateful to the people of New York that the best public servant in our family is still on the job and grateful to all of you, especially my friends from Arkansas, for the chance you gave us to serve our country in the White House.  I am also honored to share this night with President Carter, who has inspired the world with his work for peace, democracy, and human rights. And with Al Gore, my friend and partner for eight years, who played such a large role in building the prosperity and progress that brought America into the 21st century, who showed incredible grace and patriotism under pressure, and who is the living embodiment that every vote counts—and  must be counted in every state in America.  Tonight I speak as a citizen, returning to the role I have played for most of my life as a foot soldier in the fight for our future, as we nominate a true New England patriot for president. The state that gave us John Adams and John Kennedy has now given us John Kerry, a good man, a great senator, a visionary leader. We are constantly told America is deeply divided. But all Americans value freedom, faith, and family. We all honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world.  We all want good jobs, good schools, health care, safe streets, a clean environment. We all want our children to grow up in a secure America leading the world toward a peaceful future. Our differences are in how we can best achieve these things, in a time of unprecedented change. Therefore, we Democrats will bring the American people a positive campaign, arguing not who’s good and who’s bad, but what is the best way to build the safe, prosperous world our children deserve.  The 21st century is marked by serious security threats, serious economic challenges, and serious problems like global warming and the AIDS epidemic. But it is also full of enormous opportunities—to create millions of high paying jobs in clean energy, and biotechnology; to restore the manufacturing base and reap the benefits of the global economy through our diversity and our commitment to decent labor and environmental standards everywhere; and to create a world where we can celebrate our religious and racial differences, because our common humanity matters more.  To build that kind of world we must make the right choices; and we must have a president who will lead the way. Democrats and Republicans have very different and honestly held ideas on that choices we should make, rooted in fundamentally different views of how we should meet our common challenges at home and how we should play our role in the world. Democrats want to build an America of shared responsibilities and shared opportunities and more global cooperation, acting alone only when we must.  We think the role of government is to give people the tools and conditions to make the most of their lives. Republicans believe in an America run by the right people, their people, in a world in which we act unilaterally when we can, and cooperate when we have to.  They think the role of government is to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of those who embrace their political, economic, and social views, leaving ordinary citizens to fend for themselves on matters like health care and retirement security. Since most Americans are not that far to the right, they have to portray us Democrats as unacceptable, lacking in strength and values. In other words, they need a divided America. But Americans long to be united. After 9/11, we all wanted to be one nation, strong in the fight against terror. The president had a great opportunity to bring us together under his slogan of compassionate conservatism and to unite the world in common cause against terror.  Instead, he and his congressional allies made a very different choice: to use the moment of unity to push America too far to the right and to walk away from our allies, not only in attacking Iraq before the weapons inspectors finished their jobs, but in withdrawing American support for the Climate Change Treaty, the International Court for war criminals, the ABM treaty, and even the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  Now they are working to develop two new nuclear weapons which they say we might use first. At home, the President and the Republican Congress have made equally fateful choices indeed. For the first time ever when America was on a war footing, there were two huge tax cuts, nearly half of which went to the top one percent. I’m in that group now for the first time in my life.  When I was in office, the Republicans were pretty mean to me. When I left and made money, I became part of the most important group in the world to them. At first I thought I should send them a thank you note—until I realized they were sending you the bill.  They protected my tax cuts while:  · Withholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leaving over 2 million children behind · Cutting 140,000 unemployed workers out of job training · 100,000 working families out of child care assistance · 300,000 poor children out of after school programs · Raising out of pocket healthcare costs to veterans · Weakening or reversing important environmental advances for clean air and the preservation of our forests.  Everyone had to sacrifice except the wealthiest Americans, who wanted to do their part but were asked only to expend the energy necessary to open the envelopes containing our tax cuts. If you agree with these choices, you should vote to return them to the White House and Congress. If not, take a look at John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats.  In this year’s budget, the White House wants to cut off federal funding for 88,000 uniformed police, including more than 700 on the New York City police force who put their lives on the line on 9/11. As gang violence is rising and we look for terrorists in our midst, Congress and the President are also about to allow the ten-year-old ban on assault weapons to expire. Our crime policy was to put more police on the streets and take assault weapons off the streets. It brought eight years of declining crime and violence. Their policy is the reverse, they’re taking police off the streets and putting assault weapons back on the streets. If you agree with their choices, vote to continue them. If not, join John Kerry, John Edwards and the Democrats in making America safer, smarter, and stronger.   On Homeland Security, Democrats tried to double the number of containers at ports and airports checked for Weapons of Mass Destruction.  The one billion dollar cost would have been paid for by reducing the tax cut of 200,000 millionaires by five thousand dollars each. Almost all 200,000 of us would have been glad to pay 5,000 dollars to make the nearly 300 million Americans safer—but the measure failed because the White House and the Republican leadership in the House decided my tax cut was more important- If you agree with that choice, re-elect them.  If not, give John Kerry and John Edwards a chance.    These policies have turned the projected 5.8 trillion dollar surplus we left—enough to pay for the baby boomers retirement—into a projected debt of nearly 5 trillion dollars, with a 400 plus billion dollar deficit this year and for years to come.  How do they pay for it? First by taking the monthly surplus in Social Security payments and endorsing the checks of working people over to me to cover my tax cut. But it’s not enough. They are borrowing the rest from foreign governments, mostly Japan and China. Sure, they’re competing with us for good jobs but how can we enforce our trade laws against our bankers? If you think it’s good policy to pay for my tax cut with the Social Security checks of working men and women, and borrowed money from China, vote for them.  If not, John Kerry’s your man.    We Americans must choose for President one of two strong men who both love our country, but who have very different worldviews: Democrats favor shared responsibility, shared opportunity, and more global cooperation. Republicans favor concentrated wealth and power, leaving people to fend for themselves and more unilateral action. I think we’re right for two reasons: First, America works better when all people have a chance to live their dreams.  Second, we live in an interdependent world in which we can’t kill, jail, or occupy all our potential adversaries, so we have to both fight terror and build a world with more partners and fewer terrorists.  We tried it their way for twelve years, our way for eight, and then their way for four more.   By the only test that matters, whether people were better off when we finished than when we started, our way works better—it produced over 22 million good jobs, rising incomes, and 100 times as many people moving out of poverty into the middle class.  It produced more health care, the largest increase in college aid in 50 years, record home ownership, a cleaner environment, three surpluses in a row, a modernized defense force, strong efforts against terror, and an America respected as a world leader for peace, security and prosperity.   More importantly, we have great new champions in John Kerry and John Edwards.  Two good men with wonderful wives—Teresa a generous and wise woman who understands the world we are trying to shape. And Elizabeth, a lawyer and mother who understands the lives we are all trying to lift. Here is what I know about John Kerry. During the Vietnam War, many young men—including the current president, the vice president and me—could have gone to Vietnam but didn’t. John Kerry came from a privileged background and could have avoided it too.  Instead he said, send me.   When they sent those swift-boats up the river in Vietnam, and told them their job was to draw hostile fire—to show the American flag and bait the enemy to come out and fight—John Kerry said, send me.  When it was time to heal the wounds of war and normalize relations with Vietnam—and to demand an accounting of the POWs and MIAs we lost there—John Kerry said, send me.    When we needed someone to push the cause of inner-city kids struggling to avoid a life of crime, or to bring the benefits of high technology to ordinary Americans, or to clean the environment in a way that creates jobs, or to give small businesses a better chance to make it, John Kerry said send me.    Tonight my friends, I ask you to join me for the next 100 days in telling John Kerry’s story and promoting his plans.  Let every person in this hall and all across America say to him what he has always said to America: Send Me. The bravery that the men who fought by his side saw in battle I’ve seen in the political arena. When I was President, John Kerry showed courage and conviction on crime, on welfare reform, on balancing the budget at a time when those priorities were not exactly a way to win a popularity contest in our party.    He took tough positions on tough problems. John Kerry knows who he is and where he’s going. He has the experience, the character, the ideas and the values to be a great President.  In a time of change he has two other important qualities:  his insatiable curiosity to understand the forces shaping our lives, and a willingness to hear the views even of those who disagree with him. Therefore his choices will be full of both conviction and common sense.    He proved that when he picked a tremendous partner in John Edwards. Everybody talks about John Edwards’ energy, intellect, and charisma. The important thing is how he has used his talents to improve the lives of people who—like John himself—had to work hard for all they’ve got. He has always championed the cause of people too often left out or left behind. And that’s what he’ll do as our Vice President.    Their opponents will tell you to be afraid of John Kerry and John Edwards, because they won’t stand up to the terrorists—don’t you believe it.  Strength and wisdom are not conflicting values—they go hand in hand. John Kerry has both. His first priority will be keeping America safe.  Remember the scripture: Be Not Afraid.   John Kerry and John Edwards, have good ideas:  · To make this economy work again for middle-class Americans; · To restore fiscal responsibility; · To save Social Security; to make healthcare more affordable and college more available; · To free us from dependence on foreign oil and create new jobs in clean energy; · To rally the world to win the war on terror and to make more friends and fewer terrorists.   At every turning point in our history we the people have chosen unity over division, heeding our founders’ call to America’s eternal mission: to form a more perfect union, to widen the circle of opportunity, deepen the reach of freedom, and strengthen the bonds of community.   It happened because we made the right choices.  In the early days of the republic, America was at a crossroads much like it is today, deeply divided over whether or not to build a real nation with a national economy, and a national legal system. We chose a more perfect union.    In the Civil War, America was at a crossroads, divided over whether to save the union and end slavery—we chose a more perfect union.  In the 1960s, America was at a crossroads, divided again over civil rights and women’s rights.  Again, we chose a more perfect union. As I said in 1992, we’re all in this together; we have an obligation both to work hard and to help our fellow citizens, both to fight terror and to build a world with more cooperation and less terror. Now again, it is time to choose.   Since we’re all in the same boat, let us chose as the captain of our ship a brave good man who knows how to steer a vessel though troubled waters to the calm seas and clear skies of our more perfect union.  We know our mission. Let us join as one and say in a loud, clear voice: Send John Kerry.

      I like  urlLink this picture of Big Bill and Hill .  He looks like a little kid. He's definitely the greatest President that I remember living through. I mean sure, I was born when Carter was President, but who remembers that? And anyways, he was a great humanitarian, but not a very good politician. No bother, he's doing good with his life now...but Bill, now that's another story. I adore Big Bill. I am going to put the transcript of his DNC speech here so I can read it over and over again (in case it ever goes away). Yay for Democrats!

      But this time, it really hasn't.  What happened?  Que pasa, DC?  *sigh*  Maybe I am too worn out to be inspired.  Maybe I am just not interested in anything I'm doing.  Maybe I am looking for other people to help me be inspired.  Maybe it is all of that.  Or none of that.  But the boiled down bottom line is that I'm not.  I'm empty inside, truly.  I even find myself missing Syracuse.  What a mess!  Maybe it's just the people I miss.  I was well-aware that that would happen.  *sigh*  I was unaware that I'd be suffering from an inspiration shortage this summer.  I thought this summer would be grand.  I'm not complaining, I adore DC (as anyone who knows me is aware), but I am feeling empty.  I'm just gonna talk to W on IM about my failed chase of S and do some work in oh, maybe half an hour or so.  We'll see what I feel like.

      My favorite music:   DMB ('course), Matty P. on guitar, Tori, Ani, Ben Harper, Phish, Radiohead, Saves the Day, Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Shakira, KDTU, Pumpkins, Fiona, Norah, 2Pac, Coldplay, Howie Day, old BNL, jazz/Miles, Wilco, Boards of Canada  My favorite TV shows:  Sex & the City (on DVD), sometimes I'll catch Friends, Will & Grace, Ellen, Dawson's, West Wing, 90210,  Saved by the Bell, Dr. Phil, Fresh Prince, Oprah, Ally McBeal, and Passions (eek, I know)...but not on a regular basis.  Can't sit still long enough!  I like drinking beer outside at Yanni's, guys who inspire me, being brunette, World Bank lunches, meeting people who know people, Conan O'Brien's show, Gmail, my long-ish (real) fingernails, the girls at both of my jobs, Adam's apples, the Metro, and good horoscopes.    I do not like thongs, being yelled at by Pietro, jiggly butts, feeling like a pee-on/Spanish idiot, living alone, and anchovies.
