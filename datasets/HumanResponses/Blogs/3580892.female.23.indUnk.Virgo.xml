      It is so amazing how God reveals to us and reminds us of things.  Over the past couple of days I have been reading a few different books and devotionals.  In each of those readings, Matthew 11:28-30 was mentioned.  I was even flipping through t.v. stations last night and there was a Christian program on and they were discussing those verses.  Maybe God's trying to remind me of something?!!?   Are you tired?  Worn out?  Burned out on religion?  Come to me.  Get away with me and you'll recover your life.  I'll show you how to take a real rest.  Walk with me and work with me - watch how I do it.  Learn the unforced rhythems of grace.  I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you.  Keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly." (Message) Also over the past few days, I've had some really good talks with a few people.  Thanks for being there through the good and the not so good...you know who you are!

      I had an interview today!  It was a group interview and I was rather nervous before hand.  After everyone introduced themselves, I felt a lot more comfortable and ya...I think it went okay.  I ended up getting called for a second interview!  It is scheduled for next Friday (right before my grad).  So anyways, if the second interview goes well I will begin orientation June 23.  There was a girl I went to high school with at the interview as well (weirdly enough we ran into eachother this past weekend as well).  We ended up going out for lunch.  It was neat catching up with her and hearing about others from "the good ol'days" at EESS.  You know, who's married, who has kids, who's divorced, who cheated on who...all the important stuff (um, ya...)     My comfort for the day:  When we give over our worries to God, He provides for us when we need it the most. (Matthew 6:25-34)

      Who knows what exactly I will use this for.  I'm "stealing" this idea from a friend.  It's a great way to get thoughts and ideas down.  It's also a convenient way to let others know what's going on in my life.  Any suggestions, let me know.

      I had my interview this morning and was asked to come in for a second one!  The second one is going to be right in the residence (for young offenders).  So I'm really looking forward to that.  It will be sometime next week.    Tomorrow morning I have a second interview for a different place.  Apparently they ask pretty much the same questions as in the first one, but this one is not a group interview.  Training for this one starts next Wednesday, so I'll find out soon if I get it or not.    Tomorrow afternoon is grad!!  I'm so nervous about tripping up the stairs or something dumb like that.  I've seen the order of grad (it's not just my program in the ceremony) and I'm about 1/2 way though...I would hate to be first...to have to wait so long to get out of there.  Anyways, it will be fun to see everyone again.  We'll probably end up going out afterwards...I predict Molly Blooms...although it's not karaoke night.  I don't have any second predictions because that's where we always went last year.

      I'm so drained.  From what, I couldn't tell you.  Maybe because I have no set schedule at the moment...working whenever I can, fitting in interviews inbetween that, having time for friends and family and all the other little life things in between.    I found out today that my old roomie got engaged on the weekend. Fun, fun! So that is officially my first wedding of next year.  I even introduced them to eachother!  Wow, that was back in OAC...forever ago.  So, that will be the second couple that has gotten married that I've set up.  Woo hoo to me.  When's it my turn?

      Ok, so I never have been able to figure out how internal time clocks work.  Mine is  so messed up .  For the past couple of weeks I have automatically been waking up at 5:45...what's up with that?!?  I haven't had to be up quite that early since the middle of April.  It doesn't matter if I go to bed early or late...eyes open at 5:45.  Messed.  Anyways, work sucked today.  I'm really looking forward to getting something new and quitting this job on the spot...no notice.  They've screwed me over way too many times.  They know I'm looking for something else, so it won't be a total shock to them.    I had a call today for another interview.  This one is Thursday morning.  I don't really know much about this agency, so I'll have to do a little research on them before hand.

      I've been "done school" since April 22nd.  Since then (before then really) I've been looking for work in the field.  For the longest time all I heard was, "we're not hiring at the moment, but we will keep your resume on file...blah blah blah."  You get sick of that after hearing it a trillion times.  So anyways, starting last week I've been getting calls for interviews.  Some of the places I really have no desire to work for, but the experience sounds good.  I even had to turn down an interview today because the only time they had left was during my graduation ceremony...go figure.    So anyways, now more than ever, I need direction in which way to go.  What if I get offered more than one job?!?  What if I take one and then get offered something that I like better?!?  What if, what if...ahhhh.  Ya, direction.  I guess I'll just take it one step at a time (ya, get through the interview first...duh).  So if anyone is actually reading this, keep me in your prayers over this issue.

      Over the past couple of months at church, we have been going through "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren.  As a church we went through the book, along with having small groups.  Today and last weeks messages wrapped up the series by asking the question, "so what are you going to do next?".  Last week focused on the  delusion  of staying where we are.  This weeks focus was about the  adventure  of going where we can.  So anyways, I wanted to share the main thing I got out of these messages.  We all have a purpose in life.  God's purposes for us are  fellowship ,  ministry ,  discipleship ,  evangelism  and  worship .  The question is though...are we going to follow through with God's purpose.  We have two options.  The first being to stay where we are at the moment...but is this part of the mission?  Secondly, we can step out in faith and follow the purpose God has for our lives.     THE DELUSION:  We think that  safety is priority ,  familiarity is security ,  predictability is stability ,  certainty is a reality  and that  faith is discovered .     THE ADVENTURE:  Adventure involves  risk ,  unfamiliarity ,  unpredictability ,  uncertainty  and  faith .  Notice these two things are total opposites?  There is no sitting in the middle here.  We weren't meant to "stay in the harbour."  There is a risk of heading out of the harbour and that is that we might run into a storm.  The alternative though, is staying in one spot and waiting for the storm to hit us.    The delusion  [a belief or impression that is not real (Oxford dictionary)]  we have sounds like a comfortable place to be...safe, familiar, predictable and certain.  BUT when we don't step out of our comfort zone to follow God's purpose our spiritual growth is stunted...we're not letting God work in us.  The adventure  [1) an unusual, exciting and daring experience 2) excitement which is the result of danger or risk (Oxford dictionary)]  sounds a bit scary, but God never gives us more than we can handle.  Lately I've been hanging out near the harbour...not tied to it, but close enough to get back quick enough.  Through this study, I've been challenged to fixate my focus on God rather than the harbour.  When I leave the harbour, He will be the compass that guides me...through storms and all.  If you have never read through "The Purpose Driven Life", I would really recommend it.    Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.  See, I am doing a new thing!   Isaiah 43: 18-19a (NIV)

      I officially begin my training on Wednesday at Craigwood.  I have to do 2 days of PMAB (Prevention and Management of Aggressive Behaviour)...which I just took in December.  Then I have a day of medication training and then an orientation day.  So I am looking forward to all this.    I had my second interview at Community Homes today.  It went really well.  I should find out tomorrow if I get this job.  I'm super excited about this job too.  I really want to get out of the job I am in now.  As of today actually, I've been there 4 year.  I'm ready to move on...break free from Hicktown...I'll still visit mom and dad of course.    Anyways (notice I say that word all the time), that's all for now.

      Today at church, I ran into my youth pastor from when I was in grades 7-10.  He, his wife and their 4 kids (another on the way as well) were visiting.  He pastors a church in Windsor now.  So it was neat to catch up with them briefly.  The last time that I saw them, they only had 2 kids.    I also introduced myself to a girl, about my age, that was by herself...like me :(.  She said it was only her 2nd week at GTA and that she was brought up Roman Catholic, but wanted to see what the 'Christian Church' was about.  Her parents and her roommate are all Born-Again-Christians.  Anyways, we chatted a bit more and I gave her my phone number.  She's really searching for something.  So, being Fathers Day, I (along with my brother and my roomie) went to my parents place for a BBQ.  It was fun.  We pulled out the golf clubs, stuck a flag in the ground and took turns seeing who could get it the closest.  Katie and I had to practice a bit because we both hadn't done this in a long time.  I was pretty consistent in my hitting.  I either got it right near the flag (woohoo) or on the neighbours lawn.  I still haven't really figured out how to aim for my target properly.  Maybe I'll have to hit the driving range (b/c then I don't have to collect my own balls!) a few times this year...practice my aim and distance.  Katie totally sucked (she knows this too...her own words actually).  She had troubles getting it in the air.  My brother ended up being the most consistent getting it near the flag.  My dad had the distance down.  He drove some out into a field and before we could get back there to get them, the farmer was out there working up the land in the same spot that they landed.  Go figure.  Mom takes care of us and sends home WAY TOO MUCH FOOD all the time.  She had a huge box for me to take home.  Can't complain.  Number one thing in the box...strawberries...mmm!

      Technically I am employed at 4 places at the moment.  I'm still in the middle of my training at Craigwood and it is going well.  I have done 2 midnight shifts at Community Homes (I just got home from one actually and am leaving soon for more Craigwood training...who needs sleep anyways).  My last shift at ICS is tomorrow.  I'm really looking forward to this!  And #4 is the flower store.  They are usually pretty slow for the summer, so I have been told to give them a call in September and we can talk about if I would still like to work there.  I'm ok with that.  I think that I will get enough hours to survive!  By the end of today I will have worked 30 hours this week...and it's only Tuesday (I think...I have my days all confused...I go to work one day and when I leave it's a different day)  Ya, Tuesday!  Anyways, so that is what is going on with my job situations.  I should jet though...I just came home quickly to shower (aka wake up) and make a lunch.  I'm trying not to get into drinking coffee, but I just might have to get one this morning...training involves sitting in  nice ...zzzz... big ...zzzz... leather ...zzzz... chairs ...zzzz...

      I had today off, but it didn't end up being all that relaxing.  I had to go do some paper work for my one job...so that I can get paid (looking forward to that day!).  I also donated blood today.  It used to totally disgust me, but as I was saying in my last post, why do bad things happen to good people...that's why I give blood now.  Sometimes, if they have a demand for a certain type of blood that day they tell you exactly what it is going to be used for.  Today my blood was going to 4 kids who have cancer.  That was my warm fuzzy for today!!

      Why?  That is what I've been asking myself recently.  Why must bad things happen to good people...people who don't deserve it.  I won't go into specifics or anything, but this week has been a crazy week.  I know that everything happens for a purpose but it's really hard to grasp that concept when terrible things happen.    As part of this crazy week I worked 56 hours.  Haven't done that in a while.  I slept 10 hours today and will probably be up all night now.  I really needed a good sleep though.  Because I'm not on a set schedule, (like a week of the same shift) I've been having troubles with knowing when to sleep.  Anyone have any suggestions?  They would be greatly appreciated!  This week should be a bit better, although I do work a double shift on Wednesday.

      Wow, it's been a long time since I've blogged.&nbsp; This shows how busy I've been.&nbsp; It's already July 18th and I've only had one day off this month so far.&nbsp; I can't really complain though because work has been great and I really need the money...so I can start paying off school!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Other than work I really haven't done a whole lot recently.&nbsp; I did go to a Switchfoot concert last week.&nbsp; It was good times!&nbsp;  &nbsp; That's about all for now.&nbsp; The next few days is work still and then I guess I have a few days off.&nbsp; I'll probably be bored as I've been so busy lately.&nbsp; Oh well, need a break sometime! &nbsp;

      Wow.....what a week.&nbsp; By the end of this week, I will have worked almost 80 hours between my two jobs.&nbsp; That's crazy-nutso.&nbsp; I was asked to work this morning as well but turned it down as I had no clean clothes and desperately needed to do laundry.&nbsp;   That's about all that has&nbsp;been going on.&nbsp; I don't really have a social life beyond my co-workers at the moment.&nbsp; That's ok though, there's not too many people I actually hang out with anymore anyways.&nbsp;

       Lately I've been struggling to find out who my true friends are.  Really this is not something that is just recent but over the past few months I've really been thinking about it often.  Ok, so what is the definition of a true friend....or friend for that matter.    Something to think about.

      Who ever said that days off are relaxing?!!? I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off the past two days. I think I need to go back to work to recuperate.   Yesterday I had a good visit with the parents.  It's nice to get back to old hicktown once in a while.  Today I had lunch with a friend that I used to work with.  It was good to catch up, although I couldn't get the juicy office gossip as we went to Mc D's and others from the office were sitting right beside us.  Oh well.   Then I had a great visit with my grandma.  She's starting to really slow down.  The worst is that she is forgetting a lot of things.  I think I heard the same story a couple times today.  Gotta love grandmas!!   I also got an email from a friend who moved home for the summer.  I have been terrible at keeping in touch, so thanks for the nudge *nudge nudge*  BTW, I did email her back already.  Bonus points pour moi.  Oh she would like that one....she likes to talk French.   Anyways, back to C.S. Lewis.  Ya, I'm trying to read more often....I'll let you know how it goes.
