       "bro, she played me."    this was what a good friend of mine told me after pouring his heart out over a girl he was starting to love, while downing several bottles of san mig light in a watering hole somewhere in the makati cbd the other night.    i would've agreed with him and a lot of his anger-filled statements were it not for another friend of mine who was with us, and who had a tendency of being one: a player.    his current situation came in as a surprise to me. i mean, i knew the girl in question. i've been out with them on a couple of occassions, even exchanged sms with her. she seemed to be the sweet, good-girl type that you could take home to meet your parents and be proud of.       apparently, it wasn't just him who was deceived.    i've had my share of experience with these type of people. its just like the song, buttercup: they build you up to the point that you would start falling for them, then they'd suddenly drop you like a hot potato.      just like that. a notch in their never-ending belt of conquests. score one more for the visiting team.      one moment your world is a blur as you've met someone who'd give you butterflies in your tummy everytime you see them or even think of them. the next, you're all alone, broken-hearted and confused about what happened and what hit you.      believe you me, if you think that girls are the only victims here, then you're dead wrong. guys can be the victims, too, just like me and my friend; another statistic in the world of players and their victims.      why would these people, intentionally or not, play with the feelings and emotions of other people?      it could be a lot of reasons ranging from a bad childhood experience, to his/her family's background, to the person's peers, to even just plain cold-heartedness (i.e. they'd just like to have fun at other people's expense). its already hard enough trying to understand people of this sort; and its even a lot harder trying to convince them to curb their behavior or change their view on things. in fact, most of the people i've encountered who are qualified to be categorized as a player refuses to open up on the real reason behind their actions (lest you've already known them for quite some time).      again, believe me, i've been there and done that (no, not me exactly, but i've tried to convince a very good friend of mine). unfortunately i've learned the hard way that if someone doesn't want saving, superman's reason for existing is worthless.      so what exactly can we do about these people?      nothing short of just understanding them, being patient with them or even avoid getting into a relationship with them.      but if you're an unfortunate soul who can't avoid the fate of being a victim to a player, hope and pray that it won't hurt that much when you get your heart chewed and spitted out. be afraid...be very afraid.      don't get me wrong: i'm not judging these people.  its just my opinion.  most of the ones i've met won't change their ways.  although i'm quite sure that once the right time or the right person comes into their lives, they will.    oh, and remember: you can't play a player (especially if you're not one).

       what is it about music, songs in particular, that we could relate it to ourselves?      depending on our mood, we usually associate ourselves with a particular song that we've heard over the radio or in our officemate's workstation. i've heard of friends having themesongs that reflects their situation in life, whether joy, happiness, contentment, sorrow, jealousy, or anger.  even i'm not spared from this feeling of association. yep, been there, done that.      its the best medium of expression that we could equate ourselves with.      sure, there's movies, tv shows (probably soaps), comics, books, and even plays that we could equate with a part of our life and even have it touch our deepest emotion, but that's just it: it only goes as far as a PART of our life.      enter music & songs. it speaks of different levels of emotion, different scenarios and situations, different topics: a medium that carries a message that's as dynamic as the events, no matter how big or small, in our everyday lives. messages that we could relate to how the singer or composer behind the song felt at that time, or how the feelings or events that brought about the creation of such a piece.      i, for one, had experienced going through several songs at one point in my life.   i once had the song, You Might Think, by The Cars (seen below) as my song of the hour. my themesong, if you please.        you might think i'm crazy   to hang around with you   maybe you think i'm lucky   to have something to do   but i think that you're wild   and inside me is some child   you might think i'm foolish   oh baby, it's untrue   you might think i'm crazy   but all i want is you      back then, i was courting this girl who definitely didn't want to have anything serious with me. all she wanted was to have fun &amp; hang-out with me. she was a player, as some people would put it. and i was a fool to fall into her web (so shoot me).      but foolish as my heart was, i still pursued her. how couldn't i? she was showing me mixed signals. her logic center was telling me that there could never be an "us," but her actions spoke of what was in her heart...well, that was how i saw it. so another song came into mind:      i'm falling even more in love with you   letting go of all i've held onto   i'm standing here until you make me move   i'm hanging by a moment here with you      familiar?      its Lifehouse's Hanging by a Moment. seemed like the appropriate song for me that time. i was in limbo, as far as what i was to her. i mean, she didn't want to stop doing things with me since she enjoyed my company, but i still couldn't call her mine.      well, enough of that.      i just used my experience to illustrate my point. and my point is this:   songs are as much a part of our lives as rice is a staple food in our meals. no matter where we'll be in this world, music will still be there; be it in english, chinese, filipino, arabic, japanese, russian, or otherwise...even instrumental. music is going to define who we are and what we feel because we could relate with the message that it brings. and likewise, we're defining the music that we create by incorporating what our deepest emotions tells us, what we're feeling as of the moment.      its a sick cycle carousel, isn't it?

      what is it about being a good guy these days?  what is it about being a good person?  a friend of mine was somewhat devastated when a girl (he tried to court) told him that he was "too good to be true" and some other crap that he's just too straight a person.  because of this, i began to wonder if being good has become a liability more than an asset.  if having an upbringing that would turn you into a nice, good person is a curse.  i've always thought that people liked the good guys, that they'd always win, and that they'd end up with the prom queen.  i guess that that idea is way passe for our time.  nowadays, most ladies tend to look for the bad boys.  these are mostly the guys who look and/or act bad: guys who'd treat them like shit, guys who'd play around with them.  the white knights, guys in shining or shimmering armor are a thing of the past, while the black knights are the models of tomorrow.  unfortunately, my friend has fallen for this type of girl.  you wouldn't expect her to be one of them.  why?  its because this girl is sweet, smart, funny, and intelligent.  she's got the brains to carry a conversation anywhere and the humor that would leave you laughing so hard; smart & intelligent humor, if you please.  to top it off, she's pretty and could pass for a ramp model. believe me, that was all my first impression of her when my friend introduced me to her.  and as first impressions go, mine was somewhat wrong...well, dead wrong to be exact.  after summoning enough courage to tell her how he felt, she turned down my friend saying that he was just too good a guy for her, that she needed someone who was bad, yet had a hint good.  what the crap is that?!?  what the hell is this world coming to??  my friend recalled an instance when a guy that same girl was seeing didn't even offer to pick her up at the mall.  my friend waited with that girl for more than two hours for a cab, while the guy just sent her an sms saying how he feels for the girl.  great!  and to top things off, the girl didn't even want to ask the guy to pick her up and was saying that it was her fault.  this was after my friend kept telling her to ask the guy for a lift.  jeez!  knowing my friend, if he were in the guy's shoes, he wouldn't have thought twice and just rushed off to pick up the damsel in distress.  luckily, my friend is one of those unfortunate nice guys who've been blessed without a car.  bummer.  to think, this girl likes the other guy.  what is this world coming to?  i feel for my friend for this experience.  i feel for all the good guys who've gone through or is currently going through something like this.  and most of all, i pity the girls who would prefer the bad boys over the good guys.
