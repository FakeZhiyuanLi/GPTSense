       My friend Liza Galon sent me this, very nice...   My mother was a fanatic about public toilets. As a little girl, she'd bring me in the stall, teach me to wad up toilet paper and wipe the seat. Then, she'd carefully lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat. Finally, she'd instruct, 'Never, never sit on a public toilet seat.' And she'd demonstrate 'The Stance,' which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position without actually letting any of your flesh make contact with the toilet seat. But by this time, I'd have gotten wet down my leg. And we'd go home. That was a long time ago. Even now in our more mature years, The Stance is excruciatingly difficult to maintain when one's bladder is especially full.  "When you have to go to a public bathroom, you find a line of women that makes you think there's a half-price sale on Mel Gibson's underwear in there. So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, also crossing their legs and smiling politely. And you finally get closer. You check for feet under the stall doors. Every one is occupied. Finally, a stall door opens and you dash, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall. You get in to find the door won't latch. It doesn't matter. You hang your purse on the door hook, yank down your pants and assume 'The Stance.'  "Relief. More relief. Then your thighs begin to shake. You'd love to sit down but you certainly hadn't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it, so you hold 'The Stance' as your thighs experience a quake that would register an eight on the Richter scale. To take your mind off it, you reach for the toilet paper. The toilet paper dispenser is empty. Your thighs shake more.  "You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on-that's in your purse. It would have to do. You crumble it in the puffiest way possible. It is still smaller than your thumbnail.  "Someone pushes open your stall door because the latch doesn't work and your purse whams you in the head.  "Occupied!" you scream as you reach out for the door, dropping your tissue in a puddle and falling backward, directly onto the toilet seat.  "You get up quickly, but it's too late. Your bare bottom has made contact with all the germs and life forms on the bare seat because YOU never laid down toilet paper, not that there was any, even if you had enough time to. And your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew, because her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because, frankly, 'You don't know what kind of diseases you could get.'  "By this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so confused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a fountain and then it suddenly sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged to China. At that point, you give up.  "You're soaked by the splashing water. You're exhausted. You try to wipe with a Chicklet wrapper you found in your pocket then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks.  "You can't figure out how to operate the sinks with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting, cross-legged and unable to smile politely at this point.  "One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi River! You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it in the woman's hand and say warmly, 'Here. You might need this.'   "At this time, you see your spouse, who has entered, used and exited his bathroom and read a copy of 'War and Peace' while waiting for you.  "'What took you so long?' he asks, annoyed. This is when you kick him sharply in the shin and go home.  "This is dedicated to all women everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public toilet. And it finally explains to all you men what takes us so long."  Other noteworthy immortal words of wisdom from my mom included:  (1) Pinch your nose every evening so that it would grow to be aquiline (didn't work).  (2) Never mix drinks. (Ignored up to the point when I woke up one morning after and thought my head would fall off.)  (3) "Nice girls don't smoke." (No comment.)  (4) Make sure your underwear has no holes on it; you never know when you'll meet with an accident.  (5) Don't wear pencil skirts when your behind is completely flat! (Also ignored.)  (6) No matter how pretty or smart you are, there'll always be someone prettier or smarter.  (7) The fate of a plain woman is often envied by a pretty woman.  (8) Never say, of these waters I will not drink.  (9) If you don't stop frowning, your face will freeze and you'll be ugly forever.  (10) Never go out into the sun without an umbrella or headgear; you don't see farmers in bikinis, do you?  (11) If you don't stop showing off how smart you are, no one will ever marry you.

        By Alya B. Honasan    Of course I'd love it if Prince Charming zoomed into my life today, at the onset of my high-risk pregnancy years, preferably in a late-model car. But women like me aren't holding our breath anymore; we've got too much living to do.  WHAT was that awful ratio again? Something like five single Filipinas to every eligible Filipino man? About five to ten years ago, that statistic threw me and my friends into wide-eyed panic. The prospect of never finding a Significant Other and spending every Saturday night or (worse) Valentine's Day alone for the rest of one's life was unnerving indeed, notwithstanding the assurances from both the cynics ''Better than settling for a jerk'') or the optimists (''There is somebody meant for you somewhere in this world'').  When you're 35, and there's not a glimmer of commitment and/or motherhood on the horizon, things aren't so simple. You wonder if the jerk won't be rich and funny enough to make you happy; you ponder whether that ''somewhere'' is an East Timor war zone, and The One Who Was Meant For You just got blown away in the last skirmish. Heck, you can be really philosophical about it.  Thank goodness the days of the inevitability of marriage are gone, even in this country, where your aunts still ask about your chances at every family reunion (although in fairness to them, my dear sensible aunts have gotten off my own back). ''Old maid'' has become more a matter of personal style than an age bracket. Filipinas are marrying later than ever, and fertility doctors are making conception possible into our early 40s, even if 35 is supposed to mark the onset of the years of high-risk pregnancy, if you haven't gotten around to it earlier. Even when there is a man waiting in the sidelines, and he's neither married nor gay, Filipinas are opting to wait.  Those who are unattached, like myself, are no longer as pressured about meeting biological deadlines and using that uterus before it gives.  Which is not to say 35-year-old single Filipinas don't get lonely. This is not a naive celebration of female independence or an exercise in man-bashing. Any single woman my age who says she is never, ever lonely is lying, and there are some really good men out there. But some of us run into them, and some don't.  For me, staying single has not always been a bold and painless choice. I thought I'd met someone I wanted to marry, but things didn't work out. I do believe in love, and am still of the opinion that sex is more than just a biological need akin to eating and sleeping.  I'm not mad about diapers and losing sleep, but I do think I'd make a fun Mom. I would love to marry someone willing and able to make the commitment that a real marriage entails, somebody I love and who loves me--but I haven't met him yet, and I feel no urgent need at the moment to comb the streets in search of him. I've also learned enough, vicariously and through my own close calls, to see marriage for what it is--not an escape, not a solution, but a privilege that will also take a lot of work.   A writer once told me that one should get married as soon as one falls in love, before one changes one's mind-- a romantic notion, but a bit too flaky a course of action for me. Like I said, I'm a believer in love, but I'm also convinced it takes a lot more than that to keep two people together. At 35, if you still waltzed into an unwise relationship hoping love will conquer all, then, girl, you haven't been paying attention.  With the discrimination that comes with age, I've come to view marriage like every other major decision to be made If conditions aren't ideal, don't bother. There are other things to do with life.  The biggest difference between 25 and 35, I guess, is that the older you get, the less frightened you become of loneliness. You've confronted it often enough,you've learned how to make it go away or, better, to see it for what it really is. And you've seen enough evidence that a husband, babies, even friends may not be able make that occasional emptiness in your heart disappear miraculously. In short, you have to learn to love yourself enough to be comfortable going solo if you have to, just you and your Maker jamming in that solid place inside you.  Why isn't it such a bad idea anymore, staying single today? Well, at 35, most of my contemporaries and I are sitting in jobs we generally like, at levels of professional accomplishment and financial security that we've worked our butts off to reach. We may not be millionaires, but we can take care of ourselves, with room for occasional indulgences. At least when I go on a week-long diving trip to the Sulu Sea or have to rehearse late for a play, I don't worry if my toddler has fallen down the stairs when her yaya wasn't looking. But then again, I won't have a little angel running into my arms when I get home. Such are the trade-offs.  I read somewhere once that you have to have made peace with everybody in your life by 30, so by 35 you must be bursting with goodwill. We, my friends and I, have befriended our parents and siblings, become mentors and doting aunts to favorite nephews and nieces, and figured out more or less which friends will be with us for the long haul.  It's a warm, strange place, being a 35-year-old woman. You're not yet quite middle-aged, but you're no girl, either; you can swing between the wisdom of your years and the enthusiasm for a good time that you can still express without looking ridiculous. To be more concrete, you can get bloody drunk on the finest wine one you bought with your hard-earned money one weekend--and spend the next one curled up at home with a good book, leaving the night to the 25-year-olds without feeling too washed up.  A few weeks ago, I got together with some of my dearest, oldest girlfriends in the world, schoolmates since first grade, to celebrate a birthday. There were four of us, all age 35, and only one in a relationship, with marriage still a far-off prospect. Yet, over the years, our conversations had expanded from fleeting heartbreak blues and family conflicts to the bigger picture--what was going to happen to us in this country we called home, what options were still open to us, what did we want to do with our lives.  We threw around our dreams and plans, what we wanted to do, what we could do. We joked about snagging rich husbands, but we all knew we would keep dreaming, alone or with someone by our side. When you're a 35-year-old Filipina, you've still got your options, and they aren't at all bad.

      By Laura Synder  Every player in the dating game has the tale of the one that got away. But sometimes we get a second chance to reel that catch in for good. But should you?  If you're hooked on starting over with an ex, consider the following:    How bad was the break-up?    It's not just a matter of who dumped who, but what the reasons behind the split were. Was it just a circumstance (like too far a distance or too demanding jobs) or was there bigger reason behind the split, like infidelity? All relationships deserve to start on a clean slate, but some old hurts are much, much harder to erase.    How have things changed?    Maybe it's as simple as your long-distance ex moving back to your zip code, but most likely a reconciliation requires a change in behavior on both sides. Has your cheating girlfriend proven that her wandering eye is finally focused on you? Or are you sure your jealous boyfriend is really ready to trust you? Make a little time for self-reflection here, too. Chances are, you have your own burden of fault in the end of your relationship. Have those conditions changed?    How long has it been since you broke up?    After the break-up, give yourself enough time and distance to gain a little perspective. Break off all contact with your ex, if possible, until you've recovered enough from the pain to honestly decide if ending your relationship was really the wrong thing to do.    Why do you want to get back together?    The most important question is often the hardest to answer. Neither of you should be on the rebound from another break-up, nor want to get together just to escape the sometimes lonely life of a singleton. Are you feeling particularly vulnerable or nostalgic? It's a challenge to pick up the pieces of a relationship that's already failed once; you'd better have a good reason for taking the risk again.

      There are people who can walk away from you. And hear me when I tell you this! When people can walk away from you: let them walk.   I don't want you to try to talk another person into staying with you, loving you, calling you, caring about you, coming to see you, staying attached to you. I mean hang up the phone.   When people can walk away from you let them walk. Your destiny is never tied to anybody that left. The bible said that, they came out from us that it might be made manifest that they were not for us. For had they been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us. [1 John 2:19]   People leave you because they are not joined to you. And if they are not joined to you, you can't make them stay. Let them go. And it doesn't mean that they are a bad person it just means that their part in the story is over. And you've got to know when people's part in your story  is over so that you don't keep trying to raise the dead. You've got to know when it's dead.   You've got to know when it's over. Let me tell you something. I've got the gift of good-bye. It's the tenth spiritual gift, I believe in good-bye. It's not that I'm hateful, it's that  I'm faithful, and I know whatever God means for me to have He'll give it to me. And if it  take too much sweat I don't need it. Stop begging people to stay. Let them go!!   If you are holding on to something that doesn't belong to you and was never intended for your life, then you need to ...LET IT GO!!!   If you are holding on to past hurts and pains ...LET IT GO!!!   If someone can't treat you right, love you back, and see your worth...LET IT GO!!!   If someone has angered you ... LET IT GO!!!   If you are holding on to some thoughts of evil and revenge .. LET IT GO!!!   If you are involved in a wrong relationship or addiction .. LET IT GO!!!   If you are holding on to a job that no longer meets your needs or talents ... LET IT GO!!!   If you have a bad attitude...LET IT GO!!!   If you keep judging others to make yourself feel better... LET IT GO!!!   If you're stuck in the past and God is trying to take you to a new level in Him... LET IT GO!!!   If you are struggling with the healing of a broken relationship....LET IT GO!!!   If you keep trying to help someone who won't even try to help themselves...LET IT GO!!!   If you're feeling depressed and stressed .... LET IT GO!!!   If there is a particular situation that you are so used to handling yourself and God is saying "take your hands off of it," then you need to... LET IT GO!!!

      ----- Original Message -----  From: "Paolo Campo"   Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 2004 1:44 AM  Subject: [upgeclub] pakiusap lang     to everyone,   I would just like to make a suggestion and a comment  at the same time. Could all of us please refrain from  writing emails using the so-called "text speak." I ,  for one, am irritated seeing messages coming from the  internet written using "text speak," when you have a  keyboard and a full set of fingers that you could use  for typing. I understand that when using a cellphone,  we would like to maximize the length of a message  using only 160 or so characters, that we only have our  thumbs to do this, and that we are using our phones'  keypads. Not so when typing on the internet, unless  you guys are using your keypads still. For one thing,  it is difficult to understand "text speak" since it is  not standardized. Another is that we tend to lose our  English writing skills in terms of spelling and  grammar. And finally, i hate seeing the word "me"  being used inappropriately, whatever the case may be.  Whoever started this trend of using "me"  inappropriately in sms messages and whoever thinks  that using this word is cool or cute should be shot.   I am one of the advocates of the "no to text speak in  the internet." Believe me, people in forums and other  groups are beginning to ban the use of text speak  because of the abovementioned reasons.   But then again, I may be the only one here who  actually hates text speak in the internet. It's just  a suggestion anyway.    &nbsp; My response to Paolo's email:  Paolo has a point, no offense to text-typers/speakers. I do believe that there is no limit to the amount of characters we type on the internet, well except for some very few instances. Even when I send sms/text, I pretty much use regular words most of the time. A former student constructed a sentence similar to this: D roses is on d table. I was appalled!!! His Ate said he is used to text speak. I have a cousin who lives and breathes text speak. I make her repeat everything she types on IM or email when she uses text typing. I tell here that she doesnt have to make tipid the words she says on IM or email. I have a hard time understanding text typing or text speak. Her justification why she uses text typing: she's TAMAD.  Although technology has made our lives easier it has also has made most of us tamad. Pinoys are inclined to text rather than call, when I say call I mean use the landline to call someone who also has a phone at home. Everything has become impersonal. Are most Pinoys tamad or maybe we have forgotten the art of good old fashioned conversation? I'm not saying NO to text speak but we should all realize that there is a right time and place for everything. This also goes for the murder of both English and Filipino: alis na me, go ka d2, 22log na u, etc. Duhh?! Sometimes I wonder if I'm reading shorthand...  Of course, to each his own. If text speak works for you and the person you're "texting" online then go right ahead! MY generation rarely uses text speak online anyway. Understandably, the generation AFTER US are pre-disposed to use text speak because of genetics: most people of this generation are born all thumbs. Hehehe.

       Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. - Luke 16:10   I remember this verse way back in college. This has made an impact in my life but I wasn't even aware then that the verse was from the Bible. The exact verse that keeps playing over and over in my mind is:   "If you can not be trusted w/ small things, how can you be trusted w/ bigger things?"

      Did you know that you can see anyone's Drivers License on the net including your own? It's an American based site, but apparently it now links into Canada, and the Philippines, and other countries where they've been for nearly a year now. Just key in your first and last names and then hit the search button. Just disregard the "state" field, you can bypass it and just input the "city".  I just searched for my license, and there it was, picture and all. This something I didn't know you could do. I'm not sure I like this info out there ready for anyone to access. This is a serious breach of privacy!   http://www.license.shorturl.com

       Got this from Arlene aka drumz...    Ang YAP ay acronym for Young Affluent Pretenders o in short, YAPs. Sila yung mga feeling rich, mga wannabes and social climbers na professionals at executives. Karaniwang nasa edad 25 hanggang 40, ang mga YAPs ay paboritong target market, because they'll lap up everything, buy anything, do what it takes as long as everybody else does. Kaya kung may 3330 yung ka-opisina niya, para maging "in" din siya, bibili din siya, kahit hindi niya talaga kailangan. Kung may Palm Pilot, bibili din siya. Kung nagba-bar hopping, magba-bar hopping din siya, basta lang maging "in" or "sosy" siya. They're image-driven, caring deeply about belonging, being called something, which they strive madly for. That's why, kahit hindi niya afford o hindi niya gusto ang pagkain sa isang cafe, pupunta at tatambay pa rin siya dito, just to be seen and just to be "in".  Atleast, masasabi niya, "Well, y'know I had café latte, cappucino and sandwiches there, and I saw this celebrity, and that sports star, and that singer and that famous person." Imbes na bumili ng P5.00 kape sa isang karinderya, they are willing to fork out P100.00 for the same coffee, just for the ambience, and just for the sake of saying, "In ako."   Nakakatawa ba ang lifestyle nila? Ngayon ang tanong, ikaw ba ay isang YAP? The point is, you don't have to be "in"; you just have to be true to yourself, to others and to the Lord. You can dress up in your best designer outfits, splash on the latest cologne or perfume, buy the latest gadgets and go to the trendiest discos, nightspots, exclusive restaurants, cafes, vacation spots, etc. So, do you think after you've gone through all those things you'll be happy? Are you? See!? The point is you don't have to be a YAP. We live in a materialistic age. Gadgets and luxuries with their glitter and glamour entice even Christians to spend too much energy and money to obtain them. That's why it's important to keep spiritual values foremost in our minds. Have you been putting all of your energies into getting ahead in this world while neglecting heavenly values? Jesus said, "Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food which endures everlasting life (John 6:27)."   So when looking for a good time, forget about everything commercials tell you. It's okay na mag-bus, mag-jeep o mag-pedicab ka, bumili ng second-hand clothes, kumain sa karinderya o turo-turo at tumambay sa mga restaurant na walang dress code. Forget about the pa-class thing, nobody needs it. Just do whatever it is you feel like doing, wear anything you feel like wearing, evolve into whoever it is you're being. And remember, you don't have to be called anything but your name, to belong to any clique but your own circle of close and trusted friends, or to be anybody but yourself. And before I leave, let me share with you this simple thought:  "What we are is God's gift to us. What we become, is our gift to God."

      Somethings never change talaga. No matter what I do or where I go, people would come to me help. People from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc. would come to me to seek my assistance in whatever it is they can't seem to handle; from love problems, which is fairly common, to technical problems, which I'm not an expert. True to my nature, I would end up helping all these people. I don't mind helping people, it's just that these people would eventually become dependent on me for a lot of things. Instead of reading the help file of some software or the detailed instructions on how to do something, these people would expect ME to tell them what to do! Not only that, the same people you help, the same people who would call you up in the middle of the night for some mundane love problem they "feel" they need to tell you, these people won't be around when you need them. How many times have I experienced being brushed off as unimportant when I turn to these people for help or just to talk?  A lot ! This is why I've grown tired of helping others. When I have problems, I have no one to turn to, these people won't give you the time of day. I have become tougher now, I know how to say NO. I can spot emotional vampires before they can suck the life out of me.   Two things everyone should realize:  1.   There is a set of instructions or a manual that comes with every gadget you use, READ IT  . Don't expect everyone to help you all the time. Read the manual that came w/ it. It's not enought that you know how to use something, you should also know how to troubleshoot it or be willing to spend for repairs. 2.   You can't get what you can't give, or maybe, you don't want to give  . Don't expect me to be always there for you, to listen to you if you don't know how to listen to me. How can I be a friend to you if you don't know how to be a friend to me? If you treat my concerns as trivial then don't come to me for advice, I'm trivial remember?

      I know I should be posting my thoughts here and not the stuff I get from other people. I find it hard to be serious all the time. Even in the face of a crisis, I would always find a way to make fun of my situation or link my situation to something amusing. I read this blog from a friend and I saw colors. I couldn't help but cry. Although I haven't seen her and the child, I somehow feel some form of attachment to them. I have been critical of her actions and indifferent toward his lifestyle but the kid is just a kid and he is innocent of his parents' sins.  I find it strange that I feel deeply and strongly for the loss. I can only imagine the pain a mother feels when she loses her child. It's more than losing a lover, it's losing an extension of your life. I can imagine the deep, dark void inside her, nothing can ever fill the emptiness she now feels.  I'm sorry. I wish I could comfort you but you never came to me for comfort. I'm sorry for being critical. I just wanted you to do the right thing, be the best you can be. And for you, the father, I hope you find it in your heart to change, be a better man. You can never find happines in temporal things. Both of you, have peace in your hearts. Go with God. To the one in heaven playing with the angels, pray for your parents.
