      before I have to force myself to go to work . . .   more about yellow    some strenghts and limitations    as an individual  I -and all yellows- am/are:  highly optimistic (rarely depressed) like themselves and accepts others easily love to volunteer for opportunities see life as an experience to be enjoyed are flashy are advernturous and daring need to look good socially irresponsible and unreliable self-centered and egotistical flighty and uncommitted lots of talk with little action superficial and mostly interested in a good time unwilling to experience pain in order to produce quality undiscipined loud and obnoxious in public places exaggerates successes and omits unpleasant truths and unable to confront or face issues.  These strenghts and limitations may not be all true all the time, but they are part of a yellow's natural personality.  If the yellow developes character, they can improve on these limitations.  For example, my white boyfriend taught me that being loud in public can really scare people, and how to be more calm in public situations.  Thank you!

       THE COLOR BREAKDOWN . . .    This will be a really short introduction to what being yellow means to get your foundation for understanding what I'm blogging about.  More info about different color types will be randomly given as you get to know the other people in my life.  I began to tell about all four colors, but I think I'll stick to yellow for now.  If you want more info about the Color Code itself, go to  urlLink  this website.     what is yellow?  Yellow's are motivated by fun.  They  NEED  *to look good (socially) *to be noticed *to be praised *approval from the masses, and they  WANT  *to hide their insecurities (loosely) *happiness *freedom and *playful adventure.

      My first experience with the the Hartman Personality Profile is when I was in fifth grade.  My entire life I've had a hobby of investigating personality tests.  I have retaken this test many times throughout my life, and always with the same results.  For me, it's as true as true can be.  So, you ask, what about me?  Why this blog?  I need somewhere that I can share my personal experiences with people.  I have a lot of friends, but I have a difficult time making a real intimate connection with people.  Here, I will share crazy experiences and feelings.  I'll just wait and see if anyone listens... I guess it doesn't really matter if you do, but I know there are those out there who are like me.  Or if you're not, you know someone who is.  Maybe I can help you relate to them better.   Coming soon  . . .  *Personal facts about me, outside the color code. *An impersonal explination of the Colors, and what they mean.

       Don't Blow Your Fingers Off    Well, the fourth of July was nice.  The band we went to see, Tuxedo Junction, was much better than I had expected.  Nice sound quality, and they laid out a portable dance floor that was nice and slick.  Unfortunately the small space was overrun by active children, leaving little to no room for those who actually knew how to dance.  By the end of the night there was floor space, but I spent the entire last set in line to use the bathroom, and got out right at the end of the last song.   Fireworks were nothing spectacular, and the cuddling could have been better.  I'm sure Red was concerned with him image, as there was another girl with us who goes to his same church.  As I don't attend the same church they do I'd make him look bad if it got out that we were dating.  Red is probably one of the most image concerned people I know.   Well, plans are for capture the flag tonight.  I know Yellow will be there, and I remember inviting Blue last Monday or so, but I don't know if he'll be interested or remember.  It's ok by me if he doesn't come . . . all the more attention I can focus on Yellow.  And, seeing as it's not Saturday and we won't have to wake up early for church, perhaps I can manage some post-activity activity with him.  We'll see.  :)

       A Day Full of Rainbows    Well, if I had been in a kissing mood yesterday, I could have set a record.  Three in one day.  Luckily, I wasn’t like that and I didn’t kiss anyone, but there were some exciting impasses.  (I think I’m going to just refer to these boys as their color.  It will keep things more anonymous just in case, and if you know you’re colors you’ll understand them better than just by their names.)   Anyway, Red didn’t have to work at his second job yesterday, so we decided to do dinner.  I got off work at six, and he rode his bike over to escort me home so we could do the food thing.  Well, he was a little earlier than six, and I wasn’t quite all the way closed yet.  As he was waiting outside while I did the final money stuff and locking up, I saw someone walking toward the door on the other side of the store.  It was Blue!  That was really surprising, because he has never come to pick me up without calling first.  I hurried outside to make sure things would be completely civil when Red and Blue crossed each other’s paths.  To my great fortune, everything was ok.  Red even asked me if I wanted to ride home with Blue.  No way, I was having dinner with Red tonight!  They were totally nice to each other and we all discussed our plans for the fourth of July.  Blue had gotten off work late, and said he saw me as he was driving by so he decided to stop.  I’m sure it caught him off guard that Red was there, because he know Red usually works.  But they both have big enough guy egos that they both think I like them better, which is pretty amusing.   So on the way home with Red I got a phone call reminding me of a plans I had made.  At the pool party on Monday we talked about getting together to play RISK.  Since I didn’t know where the girl lived who was hosting the game, it had been decided that Boy #4 would pick me up since it was on his way.  Interesting again!  (BTW, it has been confirmed.  Boy #4 is definitely yellow.  He knows the color code, and said so himself.)  So I had dinner here with Red, and he was still here when Yellow came over to pick me up.  I think I half-invited Red to come play, but he isn’t a fan of RISK, and besides he was nearing the end of a good book and at the I-don’t-want-to-put-it-down stage.  So I felt no guilt coming home with Red and leaving with Yellow.   RISK was a lot of fun.  Yellow is definitely a big flirt, both in words and actions.  When it was getting late, we took turns laying on each others laps etc. while waiting for our turn.  Neither of us took over the world, but we were two of the three strong contenders early in the game.  It was obvious the other two girls weren’t going to win, which actually ended up being my biggest mistake.  I was too comfortable being surrounded by one of them, that it became too late for me to really contend in the game.  When we were all tired and wanted to go home, I decided to just help the speed of the game, and ran a suicide mission taking as much of the other two girls out as I could so the serious wars could get going.  Yellow kept tickling me and laughing at my jokes, and gave me a hug at the end of the night.  I think I decided last night that I won’t kiss him, because I really like our friendship and I think that would take it to an irreparable weird place.   So tonight I headed out for fireworks and dancing with Red.  We’re going to have fun!  I’ve spent most of the day in bed so far, and decided it was finally time to get off my lazy rear.  I can’t upload this for a while though, because my roommate for some insane reason is working on a holiday, and using the internet.  Oh well.  I’ll report about fireworks with Red later.

      Before I begin brainstorming jobs, I have to wonder publicly.... How do people get others to read their blogs?  I really want to share this.  I would be so fun to hear comments and get advice from people I don't know.  Do I have to get noticed by the blogger team?  Do I have to pay to not have advertisements to be considered at all?  Trouble is, I'm completely broke.  (A typical problem being yellow as *work* is deemed as evil as the four letter word that it is.)  I'm using what I've dubbed the "flirt for food" method right now just to eat.  I would love to pay to support blogger, I think it's wonderful, but I also think paying my rent is an important issue right now.  Enough rant, here *just for fun* is a list of possible fun careers... a hotel critic, a profession university class auditor, swing dance instructor -high profile enough to give world-wide workshops-, travel guide book contributor, human subject for scientific experiments (non-life threatening of course), wedding planner, professional photographer -not the kind in a studio, but the kind that go out and do artistic things like for advertisements or fashion mags-, singer in a big band, music supervisor for movies.  I think that's a pretty good list.  Anyone offering jobs?

      I hate working.  It's true.  I'm on my second senior year of college, and my third college.  Sometimes I feel like just quitting since my degree isn't really anything marketable anyway.  I see so many of my graduated friends working at places like Blockbuster, that it leaves me little hope for the future career world.  So why do I stay in college?  Because it's just plain fun.  Forget the stress and the homework, I've seen what life outside of school can be.  I took a year off school before starting college, and it was the most boring year of my life.  I don't want to join the rat race!  Where's the fun in that?  Unless someone calls me up and offers me a job that has fun as a definition....   coming soon, a brainstormed list of jobs that could be fun...

       Time to get into my life.   I'll just go for it and fill in details as necessary.  Last night I went to a pool party, and ended up walking home with a tall, curly haired boy that so far I'm guessing is a yellow himself, but he's new enough yet that I can't bet on it.  We discovered melted peanut butter is great on ice-cream.  It sort of hardens life magic shell, and boy is it yummy.  I think I may start spending more regular time with this yellow boy.  Hurray, this gives me one boy to test drive from every color!  You may think I'm horrible for dating four boys at the same time, but really I'm not.  I'm a single girl, who does not want to be tied down just yet.  I have different boys to fulfill different needs in my life.  Don't worry, I'm not sleeping with any of them, and they all know about eachother (pretty much) so it's perfectly honest and legit.  If I'm considered a "playett" at least all these boys know what they're getting into from the get-go.  Boy #1 = White, motivated by peace.  He fills the place in my heart reserved for love.  Only problem is that he's very far away, and long distance relationships get extremely diffficult.  He knows this, and knows how much I need attention, so he allows me to date other guys with a promise of as little jelousy as possible as long as he's reassured he's number one.  Boy #2 = Red, motivated by control.  (note=officially red is supposed to be motivated by power, but in all the Red's I've known, I feel control is the more appropriate word.)  Red boy is leaving for a year of study abroad in August, and as far as I'm concerned that's forever, since I plan to have moved again before he gets back.  So he's just a summer fling.  Because he is such a workaholic, I usually only see him really late at nights, and we spend Thursday's together.  Boy #3 = Blue, motivated by intimacy.  This boy adores me.  He told me to give him a month, and I'd be in love with him.  He knows I'm in love officially with "white", and sees me with "red" every Thursday (we all go dancing) but isn't scared off by the competition.  I told him if he wanted to pursue me he was only asking for heartache, and it still didn't deter him.  I've finally gotten him to the point where he's realized I won't give him what he wants... and he's no longer calling me "sweety," which is a very good thing.  Boy #4 = Yellow, like me!  This boy is brand new and is wonderful.  I've already been able to have deep conversations with him, and he completely understands and relates to me.  This could easily develop into a best-friendship.

       It's Too Darn Hot  "But when the thermometer goes way up ..."  The song is true.  It is too darn hot, and I think things have no choice but to cool down.  Yellow's girlfriend is coming back on Friday, and although we had some good visit yesterday I know it will be much harder to keep this friendship happening with a girlfriend around.  Also, Blue hasn't called me in a while.  I'm sure it's because I haven't answered when I saw him on the caller ID (I always had someone else around then!) and I haven't called him.  I'll have to make sure I flirt with him tonight.  Red, on the other hand, is getting harder to send home at nights.  He comes over after work, which is about midnight, and I'm getting tired of the "wake him up and send him home" battle.  I think a combination of the heat and my new allergy meds, with the drowsiness side-effet, have made me be too tired to care.  Actually, the other day Red turned to me and said "I think that guy with the beard likes you."  It took me a while to figure out that he was talking about Yellow.  I was able to easiy pass that off by telling Red that Yellow is dating someone else.  It's true, I didn't lie, but I also know that Yellow does  like me.  He's just smart enough to know to not get attached to me 'cause my heart belongs to White.

      Lightning Storms  Oops, I thought I had updated since my fourth report.  Sorry.  I had a wonderfully fabulous Yellow weekend.  Saturday, I played a five hour game of Risk in the park.  It was great flirting fun, and it ended up with me winning by taking yellow down.  (There were three other players...)  After Risk we went to see MIB II, and Tommy Lee Jones is still fantastic!  After that I turned down shooting off fireworks with my roomate and her boyfriend for one on one cuddle time with Yellow.  Both happily and curiously unfortunately I had decided last Monday that I would not kiss him, given the opportunity.  I had plenty of opportunities and, for the first time in making this kind of decision, I stuck to it!  I amaze myself!  Then, Sunday was also great.  After church (Yellow attends my same church) we went for a walk and read and took a nap in the park.  We then had dinner, and talked some, and then went back for prayer.  Yellow told me that he was gonna have to put a stop to hanging out with me so much because I was too addicting.  (How's that for a twisted compliment.)  His long-distance-relationship girl comes back from Montana on Friday.  The biggest problem is that I know this girl and I really like her, so I'm just gonna have to agree with him.  He also said he had to try to figure out why a girl like me came into his life.  He said it was like the current weather situation, there was a cold front and a hot front coming at the same time.  Was this ever a prediction!  A HUGE lightning storm hit that night.  So this may be close to the end of the real fun with Yellow, but who knows.  Girls always seem to get in the way of my friendships [with guys], but I think I'm going to at least attempt to maintain a friendship with him.  Better post.  Red just pulled in the driveway.

      Well, I have new news for almost every boy.  Except Blue.  I think I did a good job of letting him realize he should lay off at least until Red is gone. Least eventful is Yellow, who's girlfriend came to visit last week.  They had a great time, and I'm happy for them.  He's going to come over tomorrow morning and cook me breakfast and have a dance lesson, so that will be fun.  Yellow, just like me, has a long distance girl he's really in love with but doesn't really admit.  She's a missionary and an ex-fiance, and he's having a good time dating the girl he's seeing now, but I can tell where is heart is.  I've been there! Red is worried about his image more than anyone I know.  I think he purposly avoids doing anything public with me because he doesn't want anyone from his church seeing him and thinking that he's dating someone outside of his church.  His church is having a nice formal dance, and my bet is this is the reason he hasn't invited me.  I'll see him tonight and ask him why he hasn't invited me. I was at a hospital last Wednesday, and they were having a jewlery sale in the lobby.  I usually don't get excited over jewlery and hardly ever look at it, but my mother was with me, so we had to look.  It just so happened that they had a very particular ring that white and I have been searching for.  In fact, we've been looking for something similar for years, and this ring was PERFECT!  It fit perfectly, was the perfect color, and was even small, simple, and unobtrusive enought that I would wear it.  Why is this such big news?  Well, I most likely just bought my wedding ring.  I'm not wearing it yet because I want to wait for him to propose with it. . . and besides, then all this rainbow of boys would be over.  I promised white that as soon as there was a ring on my finger I would no longer even flirt with other boys.  I will keep that promise.  :)

       some slow time  Well, I only saw Yellow yesterday, and he was with his girlfriend.  I really like her, and hope they have a good long relationship, but also hope I still get to be friends with him.  I think it could happen as he called to make sure I was coming over, and even drove over to pick me up.  We were playing Risk, and I sat on one site of Yellow while girlfriend sat on the other.  He would occasionally look at me and say something flirty, and I would have to tell him he was saying it to the wrong person. As my body is being unkind to me, I gave up fighting really early in the game and went to sleep on the couch.

       possible fun   Very interesting development.  At least I'm not as busy with Yellow or Blue right now, but hmmmmm.  Something's gotten into Red lately.  I don't know what it is.  He's been pretty strict in the past with his call that we don't do anything more than just cuddling when watching movies.  Well, yesterday he held my hand in a public place.  He hasn't done something like that since our first date back in May.  Also, when I tease him about being such a work-a-holic he usually just says how he needs the money.  But lately he's said things like "I'm beginning to realize that" or "I know!"  And I mentioned something about him not coming over so late at nights and he said "but then I wouldn't get to spend time with you!"  It doesn't bother him that much that most of the time he spends with me is while he's sleeping.  But then he invited me (inviting me = a new thing... I usually invite myself to social things he's doing, it's not that I'm pushy, he just doesn't think of inviting me) anyway, he invited me to go visit his mother in a few weeks.  And then last night, he suddenly up and kissed me.  That hasn't happened for a long time.  Usually I'm ok with kissing, and it doesn't throw me off or anything.  But we used to kiss, and then he decided that we wouldn't.  He said if we did more than just cuddling that we'd have to stop spending the time together that we do.  But he's the one who chose to kiss me!  So do I go for it and kiss him back, and enjoy myself?  I'd like to say yes, but then what if he suddenly turns back and says, "ok, we can't hang out anymore if we're gonna do this."  I don't wanna lose his friendship.  It's not worth losing that over a kiss.... oh help.

       Hi ho hi ho workie workie - oh!    I began a post yesterday, but forgot to save it before I took off to the store to get ice cream with Red.  This was at midnight.  Have I mentioned that's around the only time I see him?  Like you stereotypical red, he is a total workoholic.  Four jobs!  Well, two of them are pretty much the same thing (cleaning offices) but they're with two different clients.  I can have four jobs, as long as it's not more that two jobs in one day, and not all day!  Red gets up at 6am goes to job one, then the video store at 10, Walmart at 4-close, and then goes and cleans another office.  He only takes Thursday evenings off to play, and Sunday's for church.  I think he's absolutely nuts!    Technically I guess you could say I have three jobs.  But I never go to one of them because the hours are optional, and I totally don't consider teaching dance a job.  Sure sometimes I get a little bit of money for it, but that always either goes right back into dancing, or saves me from starving when I'm low on funds.  It's a good thing I'm very frugal with money.  I don't spend on many things, or spend frequently, but I do save up and blow all my money at once . . . like I did for my fabulously wonderfully cute new imac.  Most of my money goes straight to bills, which seem to keep getting higher and higher.  Medical bills sure are icky!  Yellow leaves to visit his girlfriend in Montana this weekend.  White still hasn't told me whether or not he's gotten a job, but hasn't said he's coming to see me either.  I wish he would get up here!  Blue calls rarely (yeah!) and just checks in on me to see if I'm doing ok.  (I've been having some medical problems lately.)  Sweet caring Blue.    Well, I must force myself to go do laundry.  I can't even see my bedroom floor, and I hate that!  But more to reality, I'm out of underwear and socks.  And I can't just go buy more 'cause I already did that this summer.

      Good News!  I spent ALL day yesterday dancing.  Yellow's dance lesson went well, and the breakfast burrito he made me was yummy.  He brought these special garlicy tortillas that made the whole thing just yummy!  I proposed the idea of being my dance partner for a competition in November.  He has a long way to go, but I also think he may just have the drive and desire to get good.  We'll see. I convinced Red to take me to his church's dance.  It turned out to be just like an old fashioned fold dance.  Virginia Reel and everything!  My other theory is that he just doesn't think about others enough to remember to invite them to things.  It's possible.  But he was great while we were there.  While I sat out on dances I would scope out girls who weren't getting asked much for him, so he could try to make sure to give everyone a chance to dance.  I didn't get asked by anyone but him, but I'm sure that has much to do with the fact that I showed up with him, because I'm cute!  Who wouldn't want to dance with me.  :)  Also, I don't know if there was a single boy close to my age there. After stopping for some breadsticks and hotwings at PizzaHut (I wasn't too impressed with the food) we found my church dance by rolling down the windows and following the music through the fields.  I've never been to a dance that played so much heavy metal.  I mean, even if you life the stuff, how in the world do you dance to it!?  But we still had a good time.  Red got groovy and Yellow showed up too.  Yellow IS exactly like me the male version!  He was really silly, and a social butterfly, and doing crazy interperative dances all over the place.  I haven't done that for a few years, but that was always me when I used to be a regular at church dances.  Now, as much as I try to have fun, it's just not the same as the experience of dancing with a partner.  I LOVE swing dancing! THE END (for today)

       drama  I spent about three hours on the phone yesterday morning with White.  White suffers from anxiety, and he was definetly having what he calls "an episode" while we were on the phone.  I've never seen or heard him like he was.  It was really scary.  There was absolutely no way of getting him to think or say anything logically.  I finally convinced him to take one of his pills.  He hates to take his meds for it because they make him very sick physically.  I think he needs to go see a new shrink and get new drugs.  But since his last shrink experience was not a good thing for him he doesn't think it would be worth it.  It all started because he's worried about school.  He's going back to college after two years off.  He hasn't been offered any financial aid yet because he's just barely young enough to still have to report his parents earnings.  Well, his parents haven't done thier taxes for three years now.  He began bothering them to do their taxes since before summer.  He may even lose his full tuition scholarship if they don't get their taxes filed.  Poor guy!  Then, because of that problem he's mentally turning everything else into a huge problems as well: getting a job, finding a place to live, getting into the classes he needs, etc.  Well, I put my sister and her husband on the task of apartment hunting for him.  And I'm going to call and bother his parents about getting their taxes done.  Poor guy!  Directly after hanging up with Dallin, I taught a two and a half dance lesson with a beginner that has real potential.  He's not bad looking either, but I doubt I'll get to add him to my list of boys since he works with my roomate, and she'll most likely tell him not to mess with me.  Who knows.  Red was well behaved last night.  Not even a kiss.  He's been in a really good mood lately, though.  It was fun.  He took me grocery shopping, and he went and raided McDonald's recycle dumpsters for french fry boxes since they are the perfect size for packing things for when he takes off.  He wants to get all his things packed up way ahead of time, but he doesn't even leave until Aug. twenty-somethingth.  But since he has no other free time with all his jobs I guess it makes sense for him to plan this far ahead.  I would never do it though.  All nighter the night before moving, that's more my style.

      You think I'm awful, don't you?  It's strange because it seems that everyone, except for White and myself, think so.  "How can you have a boyfriend, and still date other people?"  I face this question all the time.  But I have to tell you - I don't feel guilty about it in the least.  I have nothing to feel guilty for.  By most people in the world's standards boyfriend/girlfriend = the person you're having sex with.  To me that just shows the absolute lack of morality today.  That used to be the world's definition for husband or wife!  Look how far we've progressed.  Anyhow, there's a dictionary sitting right next to me.  Let's see what it says about dating, shall we?   date:  "an appointment for a specified time; esp: a social engagement between two persons of the opposite sex"  dating:  "to make or have a date with"  boyfriend:  "1. a male friend; 2. a frequent or regular male companion of a girl or woman, 3. a male lover"  So you see?  A boyfriend does not have to fill all three definitons, only one definition is needed.  So I have many "frequent or regular male companions" and you tell me what's wrong with that?  Just because I would much rather spend my time with males than females I'm a "hussy" (as a  co-worker jokingly called me).  With this definitions I could have many boyfriends who are "taken."  My own definitions:  boyfriend:  The boy I'm spending the most time with and I know cares for me.  taken:  Could be a friend, or frequent companion, but do not cuddle, kiss, or seriously flirt with because you would be invading someone else's territory.  fiance:  Not only have you decided to marry, but there is an engagement ring on the finger, signifying your "taken" status.  married:  Don't even flirt!  I believe in complete fidelity, and if a married man flirts with me than I'm calling up his wife right away!  love:  yeah right, define love.  Love has a gazillion defitions and manifestations and levels.  I love my brother, I love White, I love Red, I still love an ex-boyfriend, I love my roomate, I love God, and they are all in very different ways.  There are common elements to all, and that is trust, the willingness to sacrifice for, and the ability to recognize and care about their feelings.  I think this is obvious.  I reserve telling someone I'm in a relationship with that I love them unless it's the kind of love I have developed with White.  I have never told another boyfriend that I have loved them.  Though I have, it's never been in the way or the level you get to where you say the words "I love you."  That level has a sacredness about it that you don't just toss out to every person you've kissed.  So, do you still think me an awful person?  I hope not.  And if you do, then you will never understand what it's like to be yellow.

       Sorry for the lag  Sorry I haven't written for a while.  I've been mildly but constantly sick for about nine weeks now, and have had to make trips to go see certain doctors.  But what kind of fun is that?  On my last trip, I got to go see White.  He was great and cuddly and wonderfully nice and fun.  What a great time.  Only problem was that for some reason (maybe because of the heat) both of us were constantly very tired, or in some kind of pain.  We're like an old creaky couple.  Emotionally he did really well until I dropped him off in Logan on my way back home.  He's going to start school again, and began having more anxiety problems right before I left.  Boy that made me anything but happy to leave.  It sure made me worry about him.  Is he going to go into a full blown anxiety attack every time something little comes up?  I mean, how stressful is a marraige.  I love him, a whole lot, but I think I'm only beginning to realize the effect something like this can have.  The day after I returned, Red took me up to meet his family.  Actually, he told me we were going to see his mother.  I had no idea that both his sisters, and his Grandmother would also be there.  Not to mention two of his nieces and a brother-in-law.  (I think he was an ex-husband of one of his sister's, though.)  I felt kinda dumb.  BUT oh! was the dinner good.  Homeade tortillas, fresh and hot, yummy tamales, and just one good thing after another.  On the very next day Red came to dinner with both my parents.  They really like him.  They commented that he would make someone a good wife one day.  I agree with them.  But we're all agreed that the wife will not be me.  Besides the religious differences that totally rules the thought of marraige out, I think he's to self centered for my taste in husband choices.  Don't get me wrong, he's a great guy, but he's totally in his own world.  Also, he's just not fun enough.  You can't tickle him, or wrestle with him, and he would never get silly in public.  He's far too proper.  He's a great dancer, but you can even tell in his dancing that he's always much more concerned with what he's doing than with you.  I need more fun and more attention.  I wouldn't do well with his attention span.  Also, I can't relate to his work-a-holic life.  I would get jelous of his job....jobs.  Haven't seen yellow or blue in a while.  Yellow's girlfriend is back in town.  He did call last Monday to see how my doc. appointment went.  I think I'll call him today.  I'll see Blue tonight.  I'm pretty sure he's moved by now.  I'm sure once Red leaves (in just a few short weeks) I'll see more of Blue.  Unless I get really into school this semester.

       well well well   At least Red was really nice to me today.  I stopped by his work on my way home from work, and he was very good to me.  He even offered me the use of his car to go pick up the new printer I wanted to buy.  It was actually at his second job that I was heading to pick up the printer, and I saw him there also.  He took the time to talk to me, and that was really nice.  I'm definetly gonna miss him when he leaves.  His phone lost all power yesterday, and that's why he didn't call me.  He actually thought about it, but decided not to since it was 11:30pm.  I still don't know what's happening in the land of White.  Actually yes I do.  I just need to give it time, and wait and see what he does.

       reality hits  Life is not all bliss.  In fact, it's been a very not so good day.  I'm not going to go into details of my health, because that's not the important stuff.  It's about relationships.  We'll start with the biggest beef:  Like I've stated before, I'm absolutely in love with White.  In fact, I plan on marrying him.  This is where the trouble begins.  You see, the most important aspect of my life is my religion, and Jesus Christ.  When I first met White this was not so important to him, but it came to be.  And I know that he did not just change for me.  I could definetly see a difference between when he was going to church to make me happy (which I could easily see right through) and when he really believed in it.  In my faith, marraige is for eternity, and one of the most important decisions you can make in this life.  With your eternal companionship of husband and wife you can progress to the highest kingdom of heaven.  I have to explain this for you to understand why what's happening now is such a big deal to me.  I wrote a bit about the time I was on the phone with White and he had an anxiety attack.  During that, I asked him if he had prayed, and he said no.  I also told him that he should ask for a blessing, and he said he didn't need one.  That seriously upset me, and I told him that.  I couldn't understand how he could choose to not ask for help from God.   Well, I asked him again today if he's asked for one, and he again said he doesn't need one.  He chalked before up to his chemicals getting in the way of not thinking clearly.  But now that he's not in the midst of a panic attack, he feels that he can handle things.  But he's going back to school, looking for a place to live, and a job, and trying to deal with his anxiety.  I don't see how he doesn't need a blessing.  But he refuses to ask.  On top of that, he missed church last week because he slept in, and this week, he didn't call to find the right one to go to.  He went to part of one church and part of another, but wasn't there for the entirety of either.  He also didn't ask if anyone was looking for a roomate, which is the original reason I took him to Logan.  This also upset me.  But he said it was ok because he did find a place to live.  He's decided to accept an offer he was given at the beginning of the summer (and had decided then not to accept) to live with an old friend of ours from Jr. College, and his girlfriend.  Besides the fact that he'd be living with an unmarried couple, neither of whom even believe in God, this friend was known to be a big partyer.  White said he checked things out and he doesn't party like he used to.  On top of all this, he's not taking his anxiety medicine, and isn't getting therapy or help.  He needs to be put on a different medication, and he definetly needs help.  I'm getting seriously scared and questioning if this is someone I want to spend eternity with.  The hard part is that I really and truly do love him.  I did get to talk to Yellow a bit about it, along with his girlfriend, but they didn't have much advice for me.  I actually wanted to talk to Red about it, but he is a different faith for one thing, and an awful listener for another.  (He has a tendancy to speak his mind, and then fall asleep after the first five words of your response.)  So then I decided I just wanted a hug from him, but he hasn't returned any of my calls today.  I usually don't hear much from him on Sundays, but I wish I could have at least had him call to know that I'm in need of a hug.  I should just let him go since he'll be leaving for good in just a few short weeks.  I actually talked to White about my  concerns, and as a typical White he couldn't come up with any words to explain himself, and therefore just changed the subject.  I did talk to my bishop, and he's very concerned about White not taking care of his anxiety problem.  He thinks the other things are a result of his anxiety, and also, if he doesn't treat it I'm in for a very hard life even if White does resolve the other issues.  I've decided to give White some time, and not try to get words out of him.  I'll give him some time to proove himself through action, and if these things aren't important enough to him, then I'll have to decide if I should let him go, though it will break both of our hearts.

       back to the boring  Well, no more real excitement anymore for me I guess.  Red left last Tuesday for Costa Rica.  Bye bye for good for him.  Bye Bye Red! I think Blue got a girlfriend.  (yeah!)  I haven't heard from him in forever. White starts school at USU next Monday.  He should be busy. Yellow has pretty much dissapeared since his girlfriend moved back to town.  Bye bye Yellow!  Actually Yellow is going to help me set up for a dance tonight.  I forgot to advertise for this dance 'cause I got sick, so we'll see if there's any kind of turnout.  I hope so!  I also hope I get better before school starts.  I took today off work for one more recovery day.  I hope it was worth it.  At least my voice is back, but I sound like I smoke a million cigarettes a day.  Oh well.

      Well, things are finally picking again for me.  Back to the fun life. There are two boys that are brothers, and both dance well.  I think they are both interested in me.  Well, I know the older one is, but the younger one may just be too young.  Brother the Younger is going to be my dance partner for a competition coming up, so we'll actually be spending a little time together.  Also, there are two roomates who are possibly interested in me as well.  One is a Blue/White, and the other is a Red.  I'm not really interested in Blue/White, though he is a good cuddler and likes to dance.  New Red, on the other hand, I am interested in.  But there are a few complications with that.  One is his perfectionist Red personality.  This boy has never even had a girlfriend.  I think he's waiting for miss perfect, and doesn't realize that she doesn't exist.  Also, because of this aspect of his personality, he would probably tell his Blue/White roomate to "go for it" in pursuing me.  The last complication is that he's one of my students.  I don't know what the policy is on that...but uh...  I invited New Red to go to the county fair with me last night.  All my friends were going, which meant two couples, and me.  I had to even out my odds.  We rode some spinny rides, played in front of the warping mirrors, and ate elephant ears.  There have been complications in my love for White.  He's got some serious issues with anxiety, and has not been to see a doctor, and is not taking any medications.  I'm getting really tired and worn from his saying he's going to do something, and then not.  (Or saying he's not going to do something, and then doing it.)  It got to the point where I had to play mean girl and give him an ultamatum.  I'm possibly going down his way in October, and I told him that if he did not have a good shrink by then, that I would not see him while I was down there.  This of course sent him off the wall, until he realized how much it's hurting me.  The minute he saw it as taking care of me (rather than taking care of his own problems) he was fine, and made an appointment with a doctor.  He had to change his appointment, though, because he had a substitute teaching job that day.  This is the only job he has, and he only has time to do it one day a week.  He cannot qualify for any financial aid.  I don't know how the poor boy is going to survive.  I'm getting worn out from worrying about him.

      I stayed up way-hay-ay too late last night.  Now I'm very tired.  But it had to be done.  Important conversations with Blue/White Idaho. We talked about everything but the one thing I really do need to talk to him about... where WE are.  The DTR.  (Determine the Relationship.) Possibly the end.  Or maybe not.  Who knows!  Well, I'd love to call him and get this straightened out, but Derek is coming over today, so I know I won't have time.  At least I Hope Derek is coming.

      Derrek called me this morning.  Wahoo!  I keep breaking into a huge grin every time I think about him, something he's said, or anything related to anything to do with him.  I think I may get to spend Friday with him in addition to Saturday now.  I mentioned teaching him how to dance, and he's actually up for it.  He's either open-minded about doing things (bonus) or he'll do things just to spend time with me (also bonus).   He teases me about where I work, and calls it a "compound" because I live here, and there are bunk houses.  (They run a summer camp here.)  He said this morning that he looked it up online, and said the facade of us being an art camp even holds up there.  He looked up my work online!  I never even gave him the address.  Somebody's thinking about me... I'm smiling.  On a different note... upon further reflection I decided that Venesuela was definetly a yellow, and not a yellow/blue.  Intamacy was just his source for fun, and not a motivator.

      Color explanations help:  Derrek - I mean, I'm actually even using his name - I have yet to discover what color he is.  NOT a red . . . always good.  Plumber is Red.  He is scared at how easy it is for me to read him.  He's so obvious, and goes "WHOA!" every time I tell him what he's thinking.  I've been right 100% of the time so far.  Venesuela is Blue/Yellow.  We had a whole lot of fun until we kissed.  Oh the kiss was good, but  he then decided he was head over hills for me, and didn't care about anything he was doing that was hurting those around him.  He just wanted to have fun being with me, consequences regardless.  Woops on I part, I thought a kiss is just a kiss, and I'll be far away from him soon.  Well, he got my number and is calling me now.  Luckily, he'll forget me as soon as he has someone else to kiss.  Idaho is Blue/White. Idaho lasted about that whole time I haven't written.  So we were a thing for about a year.  It was true love.  He's perfect and everything I'm looking for in all ways but one.  The one was the top of my priority list. Now it's time to decide to move on.

      I have three and a half weeks to make Derrek my boyfriend. Which also means I have to officially decide that I need to break up with the boy left in Idaho. Which also means I have to work hard at convincing the plumber, the dancer, and the Venesualan that it just ain't gonna happen.  I like Derrek, and I'm on the verge of twitterpation, I just need signs that he likes me back.  I don't wanna scare him off, though.  Oh, this is the first time in my life I've actually planned on hooking someone.  The rest of the time, it just happens.  But this one is serious.

      Dear Exam Administrator, † This is a pretty confusing test. It's multiple choice, yet I'm supposed to check all answers that apply and write essays explaining my answers. Then, halfway through the exam, additional answer choices are given. What if I had already finished? The Professional Engineer exam better not be this hard. Here goes: † In this hypothetical situation, perhaps our inexperienced and distracted hero had thought the girl probably didn't want to come on a long drive to see people she didn't know. The girl might have rather done something else or have had responsibilities on the farm. Our hero isn't sure what to think of the girl with the strawberry scent. She is scary (in a good way),†and†she is really fun. His friends in the wintry far off town had said she would be welcome and have a place to stay in the closet under the stairs if she did come. † Our hero, on the eve before his departure, realizes a more considerate course of action would be to invite the girl and let her decide for herself. She could make the journey more enjoyable, he rationalizes,†and if she gets too scary I can make her walk home.

      Sharpen Your Pencils and put on your Thinking Caps, this is a multiple choice Exam.  1. Given the following scenario,  There is a cute nerdy (In a Good Way!) boy who is going on an overnight trip into unknown depths of an Eastern State to visit old friends.  There is a scary (in a good way?) girl who in is new to the East and would like to explore and see as much of it as she can during her stay.  She also likes to spend time with the boy and thinks he's an adorable nerd-in-a-good-way; exactly her type.  Her stay in the East could be as short as five months, OR it could last years.  She just doesn't know, which hightens her urgent desire to see as much as quickly as possible, or find a reason and way to stay.  Which course of action most nearly matches the one that will happen:  (Mark all that apply)  __The boy goes and has a great time.  The girl stays at home writing children's stories, and wondering what would have happened had she had the guts to say she was really interested in going along. __The boy never even considered inviting her, she's too scary, so he didn't. __The boy thought of inviting her, but didn't want to be too forward, so he didn't. __The boy thought of inviting her, but was embarrased at the idea of introducing this girl to his friends, so he didn't. __His friends have a very small place, and he didn't invite the girl because there would be no room for her. __The scary girl forced the boy to let her come along by threatening death by tickles. __The boy decided to do something he'd never done before, casting out all fears (of the girl, and the severe teasing that would result among friends and family about the girl), and take the girl - introducing her to his friends as the girl he was currently:      __Afraid of      __Seeing      __Dating      __Kissing      __Using to Learn how to kiss      __Afraid to kiss because he hadn't really had experience, and knew she had, so it made him nervous      __Giving a chance to see somewhere she's never seen before      __Humoring      __Tickling      __Really Really afraid of      __Experimenting with the notion that taking care of strange Daughters of God was part of his Priesthood Responsibility __The boy had asked his friends if he could bring a friend along, and they said, NO WAY! __Something came up, and the boy couldn't go __For reasons beyond all description, the girl could not go __Due to top secret matters, the whole "visiting friends" was a guise that he presented for the girl so she would leave him alone for what he was REALLY doing for the weekend. __He thought it would be inappropriate to invite a girl along for a trip like this. __He cried out Leave Me Alone You Scary Girl!!! __He cried out You're Very Interesting You Scary Girl, (in a good way!)!!!  Essay explaining your choices:   Remember, there are no wrong choices.  Just different consequences. Good Luck.  This is a timed exam.  Please respond before it is too late.  Go!  (Later, there was an amendment with added options... which I don't remember now)

      Yeah!  I think I'm going on a mini-trip with Derek this Friday/Saturday.  His response to my email quiz was fantastic and made me laugh out loud right here in the office.  And it wasn't even a short guffah.  It was a real laugh that lasted for a bit.  Nobody cared well enough for me to get to share what he actually said with anybody.  Maybe I'll copy and paste the emails here...

      Something must be done.  I've been with Derek three times since our first kiss, and he always gets just as nervous when its time for a goodbye kiss.  I want to get him over this nervousness, but at the same time I want him to know that he's more important to me than his ability to kiss.  I don't want him to get so wrapped up in being nervous about kissing that it affects other things, you know?  How to handle this... Hmmm...  On the really bright side, I talked with Idaho White, and things couldn't be better.  We're exactly on the same page of not really wanting to totally let go of eachother, but not really seeing our relationship turning into any kind of life long commitment.  So it's totally ok if we seriously pursue other people, but we will still be friends and there to support eachother.  Whenever I tell someone about a breakup and use the words "we'll stay friends" they say Yeah Right.  But so far, it's always happened.  Most of my best friends are ex-boyfriends.  Once I've truly loved someone, the Care for them doesn't go away, just the nature of my love and commitment.  So, Idaho-White and I WILL remain good friends, and both of us are happy about things.

      It Happened, I did it!  WaaHooo!  So, we went out on Friday night, that was nice.  I was supposed to go to his place Saturday, but it was snowing, and I started to get sick, and well.... He decided he would come over to my place.  I teasingly bugged him about how many girls he's kissed, since he's only had -in his words- "pseudo girlfriend."  He got really shy and couldn't answer me.  It was obvious, none.  So we watched finding Nemo, but I have seen it so many times that I couldn't concentrate and just kept talking to him.  He didn't seem to mind paying attention to me, and then began the tickling and the hand holding and...  It began to get really late.  We talked about him leaving again and again, but he just didn't get up.  We cuddled, and it was fun and I could tell he was nervous and wanted to kiss me, but I just didn't want to be the one to make the move and be too forward.  So, I was walking him to the door and he noticed the story I had read to him the night before: "The Three Questions" by Muth (based on Tolestoy).   "Do you remember the three questions?" he asked. "Of course." "Who is the most important person, what is the most important time, and I forget the third." "What is the right thing to do," I looked at him. "What do you think the right thing to do is?" I blushed, and kinda looked away.  But, I turned back, and he still wouldn't kiss me, though he really wanted to.  So we tried again, "So you see, it's not a waste of time hanging out with me.  I'm helping you study for your engineering test.  It's Yellow Time." (This will only be understood if I let you know we had a previous conversation about traffic lights.) "That's right!" "So the question is do you speed up or slow down for the yellow light." I said. "What do you do?" He asked. "That depends on what it is we're talking about," and he really blushed.  But he still just stood there.  "You're really nervous, aren't you?" I said. "Yes" And before I new it I had my arms around him and was kissing him.  He almost was okay, but then his lips went really tight as he was too nervous to kiss back.  "I really have no idea what to do" he admitted. "Just relax," I said.  And he did right away.  A real kiss, and then it was goodbye.  He'd obviously never kissed before, but this was by far the most precious first kiss I've ever been a part of - even if he was so tight lipped and nervous.  It makes a great story.  After church I went to his place for dinner, and he was still adorably nervous.  I finally got real compliments out of him, and there it was.  Both of us have never moved this fast before.  Both of us like eachother.  I was even good and kept silent when his parents called while I was there.  I'm sure he isn't ready to be teased by them yet.  But I hooked him!  That was easier than I thought.  Now to just unhook the other guys that are calling me and hitting on me, etc.  Derek would be to nervous to say anything to them I'm sure. :)  I even told my parents about him.  I'm scaring myself.  I really need to call Idaho White tonight.

      Danger, maybe.  I'm starting to think.  How important are politics to me?  Exactly where does Derek stand on these issues.  I know he's anti-abortion and that's why he votes Republican (how many times have I heard That story!) but where does he stand.  It's probably a very safe bet that I'll continue to be involved politically so I think this is definetly something I have to find out.  Maybe I'll do the day trip to DC with him tomorrow...  I should, but I'll have to drive my car through the flood that is currently New Jersey. . .

      So during the weekend mini-trip, I discovered that Derek is a big fan of Silverado.  We watched a few minutes of it at his friend's place before we had to leave, so imposed a study break on him last night and we watched it.  He's got one of those city apartments where the building is locked so you can't surprise anyone by showing up at their door... but he lives on a ground floor and has a little sliding glass door that is easy access.  So I showed up at his back door, with a dark blue plastic flower fresh from Michaels.  He's got such a total single guy apartment that I decided it needed *some* life, even if it is fake.

      Aaaaahhhh Poop. I have to work a concert on Valentine's Day Evening.  That means the only way I get any Derek Time at all is if he attends the concert (and even then, together time will be minimal) or if we do something very early or very late at night.  At least the concert should be decent.  Rosanne Cash is getting good attention these days. Maybe we can do something Friday...

      Opinions about Valentine's Day Stuff:  THE USUAL:  Chocolate: Chocolate is yummy, but not the best expression of Love.  If you give me tasty chocolate, I'm going to eat it, probably without any self control and all at once, and then I'll at least feel bad emotionally if not physically for allowing myself junk like that.  Also, you give chocolate, I eat it, and then it's gone.  All done. Over.  So, if you're going to give something edible, at least make it, either something nutritious, or make a memory out of it - like a nice restaurant.  Quality food IS a good gift.  Flowers: Well, every girl loves flowers it's true.  How can you not feel happy with a flower?  But I wouldn't say flowers are the most ideal, because they'll usually wither away and be done soon too.  Not that they're any less appreciated because of itÖ   A flower or plant that gets to keep living, now there's a step up.  Life is always good, and continuing to nourish a house plant is more symbolic of real love than a pretty flower that withers away in a couple days.  Jewlery: There's something enduring, but most people realize I don't really wear jewlery.  I'll eventually take a wedding ring if offered by the right person -because symbolism and ritual are important- but even then it's not worth wasting money on a diamond.  Let's be practical here.  With my luck, I'd probably end up losing it down a drain or something anyway.  THE BETTER:  Food: As mentioned above, REAL food is good.  A nice dinner works because it gives you quality time.  If the effort is made to either make a nice meal or pay for a nice restaurant, then that is truly appreciated.    Time: Time is good.  Quality time is quality memories.  Surprises, or plans, outdoor, or in, with others, or one on oneÖ (For Valentine's Day, One on One is usually preferableÖ) Time focused on eachother, now there's a quality gift.  Creativity: Ok, so I start off by ripping on all the typical gifts and how I don't like them.  People automatically think "oh no, she'll be impossible to give to. She won't appreciate anything that's not Huge and Complex, and Augh!"  Or, they think "She'll just be happier if I don't do anything at all."  Neither of these are true.  I'm surprisingly very easy to please, but I will be hurt if I have a boyfriend who does nothing to recognize a special day.  So, just think of SOMETHING, and odds are high that you'll make me smile.  ..... We'll just have to wait and see how Derek Does.  I'll try to do something good too... but his birthday is just a few days after V-day, so I'll have to come up with something for him then.

      The weekend trip was fun.  We visited a former college roomate of Derek's, who is married and has an adorable 13 month old toddler.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing with the little boy, and driving on a long trip with someone who liked to sing silly songs along the way.  When everyone likes to sing along, They Might Be Giants is some of the best driving music.  It makes the time go by nicely.

      I just found out why I haven't heard from him all week... and he's totally forgiven.  He's been fighting some inneficient beurocracies to further is way along his career path, and just lost a frustratingly stupid battle.  He's been keeping himself occupied to redirect those frustrations.  He received a Valentine's Day care package from his mother, complete with those sugar cookies he raves about, so I'm not going to make him cookies anymore.  I did, however, get some good backpacking food to give him.  I decided to revert back to my usual mode and just not care about if we're "something" or not.  I'm going to live in the moment, and not attach myself until he is the one doing the attaching.  I think that will fix all previous problems.

      I had already bought some sugar cookie dough to make Derek some Christmas Tree shaped cookies for Valentine's day.  I'm sure they won't be the same as his real favorites that his mother makes (if it weren't for the wierdenss last Sunday, I probably would have called her to get her recipe) but the thought will be fun.    I also bought a package of sugar to give him.  Both of us really like smoothie's, but he has it stuck in his mind that a good smoothie needs sugar.  I've never actually made a good smoothie for him, 'cause he doesn't have the ingredients I would work with, but I've learned that all he needs to be happy are "sugar and a blender."  Personally, I think sugar is probably the last thing you ever need in a smoothie... so that's why I'm giving him sugar.  I like him for who he is, it says.  I also saw a little M&M man with a construction hat on.  Fitting for Derek the Engineer.  So I had to get that on impulse too.  I almost bought him a card, but decided to attempt painting one instead.  Valentine's Day is going to be Friday for us, since I have to work ALL DAY (literally) Saturday.  I'm excited for Friday, but mostly nervous now.  Maybe I should really branch out and work on meeting other guys.  I'm also actually starting to miss Mr. White in Idaho.

       And after Sunday   Ok, total confusion.  In church, Derek came and sat by me. :) He didn't sit next to me, though.  There was enough room for an entire large body to sit between us.  Even after I teased him asking if he was afraid that I would bite, he didn't scoot over.  And when the meeting was over, he immediately got up, without even looking at me, and went to talk to someone else without even saying anything to me.  I didn't see him again until after two more meetings.  I was waiting outside an office to meet with someone else, and he had to wait near there for a different person.  He talked to me then, but never sat down, and always stood on the other side of the foyer.  What is up with this!  At least before he left he told me he would be going straight home, as opposed to the possibility of coming out to my place.  I looked at him and said "I just don't get it."  "I know" he said.  I figured he just didn't want there to be rumors out there that we were anything more than we are.  And what are we anyway? Does he consider me a girlfriend, or just someone he's dating, or who knows?  If he can cuddle with me on a Metro, he should be able to speak to me at church.  It's not like I would try cuddling with him there or anything!  I have a hard time trusting someone who can't be comfortable being seen with me in public - strangers and friends.  So I called him to try to figure things out.  Unlike many guys, he was completely aware of what happened, and even felt bad.  I was right that he didn't want rumors and such, but he admitted that he overeacted.  He didn't have any sort of real answer the DTR stage of "what am I to you?"  We finally got to a comfortable stage of understanding that he just doesn't know.  Well, it is too early to know anything complicated... but I also don't want to waste my time.  If there's no possibilities than I need to be seeking elsewhere.  These are the risks one takes when deciding to just like someone full force.  I've taken a different approach to this whole thing than I ever have before; maybe it wasn't right.  Maybe, we'll see.  But my old method was definetly in need of revision because it wasn't right either.

       The Blog that would have been posted Saturday Night   I had so much fun today!  I went to Washington DC with Derek.  We met his sister at the American History Museum, and spent time wandering around various museums at the Smithsonian.  Actually, museuming was interesting in itself, but not socially.  There wasn't much interaction between any of us.  Hmmm, actually now that I think of it, that part was kind of akward.  But the rest was great.  Derek was cute and fun and totally not shy at all.  He held my hand in public, and cuddled with me on the Metro and everything.  When we got home, we watched a movie and just had a great old time.  Even the goodnight kiss was good.  Quick and simple, but definetly his best yet.  Giddy Giddy Me.

      Derek called me yesterday for no real reason.  That was nice.  I got TWO valentine's day cards from Idaho-White yesterday.  I am so loved!  Every day is Valentine's Day with him in your life (even though he's not very good at *saying* the L-word, he's great at showing it).

      Oh, I never even wrote about Valentine's day, or Derek's birthday!  Friday, we hopped in the car and went exploring for a nice resaurant.  We found one that looked great from all the signage, its location, and its presentation.  It was right next to Wheaton Village in Millville, NJ.  Well, the food was absolutely ick-ick-icky.  It wasn't just my opinion either, Derek didn't like his as well.  We couldn't even share half of eachothers plate's 'cause both tasted like garbage.  They had drowned our food in overpowering sauce that tasted disgusting, and nothing on the plate could be salvaged from its flavor.  Oh well.  We then went to see Miracle.  Not what I would have chosen for a Valentine's day movie, but hey, I wasn't paying for it so who can complain?  It was a Disney-feel good movie, that was nice, but it didn't fill me up with warm fuzzies.  I got a right-wing America is always good vibe, though the theme of you have to work really really hard was good.  Goodbye quick kiss, no hug.  Birthday, I went over and made a mostly unsuccessful cheese fondue, and an easy chocolate fondue for dessert.  Derek had never had any fondue before.  I promised him it would be better than eating at the Paper Waiter (our Valentine's day restaurant) and it was true.  He had no previous fondue experience to compare to, so he couldn't really complain if he wanted to.  We watched a few episode's of Malcom in the Middle on DVD.  That show makes me laugh.  He let me cuddle a lot, and that was good.  No goodnight kiss, though.  Just the few quick traditional pecks on the cheek as penalty for dropping food in the fondue earlier in the evening .  Ho Hum.

      Interest wanes daily.  Maybe Derek is just a moon cycle.  It begins, there's excitement.  It builds.  It wanes.  He's still fun an interesting, but each time I spend time with him I'm less interested romantically, and more interested in *just* friendship.  Possibly time to expand and explore further options again.

      Well.  Nothing new to report.  Derek still calls and emails me, so that's good.  He keeps me posted on the status of his soon to be niece.  I was hoping to get the numbers of two guys at church last Sunday, but much of my time was monopolized by another guy who I'm not interested in.  I did get to talk to both gentlement of interest, so I'll have to keep trying for digits.

      It's been a while.  Derek came over last night.  We went outside and tossed around the "jumbo mother" (A giant frisbee), made "peanutbutter things," played a round of Speed Scrabble, and watched the beginning of Spirited Away.  I even got a goobye kiss . . . on the cheek. He was fun, but we'll see if I get very interested again.  I miss Idaho-white frequently, but not desperately.

      Longest Email Ever From Derek... *background* While talking to him on the phone yesterday, when he told me he was going to a birthday dinner party last night... I gave him a bad time about how he avoids me when we're at church functions.  I was a bit frustrated - but honestly thought, it's not worth this.  This morning in my inbox he writes.... ***** I'm sorry. I'm generally a nice person, I promise. I'm sorry I've been a jerk to you. In a smaller role I am sure I could do much better. I don't have a good explanation, because I do think you're a really awesome girl and fun to be with (in a good way) and you've done a lot of really cool things. I'm just not prepared right now or something, and I'd rather fulfill a smaller role well than fill a larger role so poorly. I'm sorry I've been so lazy and forced you to pester, though pestering from cute girls isn't as tormenting as you think. † It's only March and you're here at least till June, so I don't agree with your "not making friends" speech. I've tried to include you on a few occasions, though I could do a much better job. I still think you should come to institute in Philly on Wednesdays. Even if you work till 7:00, the class goes till 8:30, so you could be there for an hour of it and to hang out with everyone afterwards. I'll pay your $3 toll. :) I know it's not fun to be isolated on the farm, though you are good at entertaining yourself and others. When it finally stops snowing, there are going to be hikes and trips to the Shore, and on some of those Saturdays you won't have to work. Hopefully this isn't a prison term for you.†There is still a lot of good Amber Time to come, and, if I haven't permanently disqualified myself, I may ask for some. † I give you permission to use the cookie-making tablecloth for brownies, if that's what you need it for. I hope the concert is fun. † I reserve the right to think of a better response later, but I wanted to send some kind of email this morning. If the rest of this message is disagreeable, just read the first sentence. † Derek  *** I wrote back and told him he is not being a jerk, and that I have no idea what "role" he's talking about.  I told him I think the reason he does get nervous and avoid me is because he thinks there's some sort of special role he needs to play.  I told him I just want a friend, and if I like him - so what - don't do anything unless its natural.  I like all sorts of people I find interesting and think would make good friends.  I'm still frustrated and sick of all this.

      Well - tonight was Derek's only opportunity to have time with me this week, and he's out being fun and social again.  He for once was (only slightly) brilliant enough to invite me... but I'm stuck at work until 7, so I can't be t a 6:30 dinner party in the city.  I give up.  It's just not worth this.  HE can chase me.  I will not chase.  I deserve to be pursued.  It's time to just Zen it out with the boys.  When it's right, the picture will be complete - but right now he just isn't fitting.

      I've been reminded that this needs an update.  Thank you. Well... I had no fun responses to my fun email.  Oh well.  Every time I called Derek last week, he was on his way out the door.  He'd been invited to a concert, he'd been called up and asked to help with a service project, he was going camping with his sister for the weekend.  And none of his little one liner emails from work either.  He had a busy week.  At least I was *invited* to go camping - but he already knew I had to work on Saturday.  On Saturday, there was really no good reason for me to be there either.  I was a little annoyed that I had to stand around doing nothing for twelve hours when I could have been camping with Derek.  On the bright side - it was really cold this weekend, so I probably wouldn't have been too excited camping.  I mean, it would have given the opportunity for body heat excuses... but his sister was there too, so he would have been cold.  He was his usual very distant self on Sunday.  But at least cute smart doctor boy obviously made a point to say hi to me.  And tasty Paraguay boy did as well.  But those... AGAIN... were the usual talk going nowhere.  Still no dates or even digits.  Then, Derek calls last night just to check in, and essentially apologize for "being a jerk" in his own words.  WHAT IS THIS!  I mean, if he would just stick to being the kind of jerk who either just doesn't treat me well in relation to others and doesn't notice it... I could pass it off to typical guyness.  Or, if he treated me the way he does around others because he's a total player and doesn't want to scare off any of his other female conquests by being seen with me, I could just pass it off to typical guyness.  But instead, though I can truly see where he's coming from and why he acts the frustrating "he loves me he loves me not"-victorian courting way that he does... he recognizes the roller coaster he's taking me on and calls to apologize.  And he does it in such a covert way that I can't even ever get mad at him.  At least I mostly enjoy the roller coaster, even though I've never felt so frustrated!  I wish I could just let him go, but I think the reason I can't is because his sincerity on this ride reminds me of me!  It's just very frustrating because usually I'm the one causing the ups and downs, not the one being taken on them.  This must be my Karma come-around.

      I know... Suspense huh.  Tuesday was fun.  Turns out I was wrong.  He's not a med student... but we'll have to call him "the doctor" anyhow just for consistancy.  The med stuff only has to do with his job.  I don't get it right now, but he is fun.    I saw him AND Derek Wednesday.  I managed to stick around long enough to get to "hang out" with "people" after.  (I feel like that Shiela girl from Say Anything...) Anyway, Doctor Boy left early for something else, so we just talked a little bit.  But a few people went to this red-head-from-Seattle (yeah Seattle!) guy's house, and he made a curry dish for us.  Derek was still a lot of fun, and darn it all, ok, I'm gonna leave it at that.  There was this girl there who was the type of girl who kinda drives me nuts.... I mean I like boys and all, but this was that type of girl who -  Well, she's my age, and she's been divorced already.  I shouldn't be judgemental, but she seems like the typical kind of girl who got married young out of bliss and quickly so that she could "legally" have sex.  And it doesn't seem liked she learned anything from it.  She one of those girls that are the reason I'm glad I don't live where I grew up.  I gotta give her credit.  I don't even know her story, and she seems like she'll be a lot of fun to hang out with... even though I won't be able to compete with her boy-wise.  (Did I mention she's the gorgeous preppy blonde type?)

       Derek Drama  I guess I should explain myself.  So, yeah.  We were both invited to a girls house for games and such on Saturday night.  Derek asked if -I think her name was Emily- was going to be there.  The girl said "No, why, are you disappointed?"  He said yes.  Then, while we were there, somebody asked him where a particular girl was.  I thought it was the same one.  And I start thinking - what is this?  He's afraid to be seen with me in public, but there must be some other girl that he's not afraid to be seen with.  So I was upset and couldn't say anything about it because of last weeks' clarification that we really are JUST friends.  Gruff!  So this morning, at the end of my response to his usual daily email, I simply wrote "so is her name Emily?" ... with no explanaition. He wrote back today saying he didn't know what I was refering to, but there wasn't anyone he'd asked out or anything.  I wrote back and said with him asking about her, and others asking him where she was I thought it was worth teasing him about.  I totally kept my cool, and he'll never have to know how upset I was.  But the past few weeks have definetly affected his conscience, as he called me pretty early today to see if we could hang out this week.  I kinda had to turn him down - busy Tuesday, but I didn't tell him why (but I'll tell you in a second!) and Thursday I'm headed to NY.  He's going up to see his family on Fri. for the weekend so that leaves us with Wednesday.  He goes to this class he's been trying to convince me to go to on Wednesdays, so I promised him I'd go this time and be social that night.  I'll see him then, but not exclusively.  This game is back on my terms now.  Yeah.   and, it's a date!  Another thing that made yesterday crappy (on top of all the other things not really worth mentioning - except for this guy who was attempting to hit on me Saturday that gave me this "he's probably got good intentions but kinda creeps me out" vibe-there was an email from him in my inbox this morning.  Not so much interested.) - I was hoping to see smart Medical Student Boy.  Didn't see him at all.  I knew he had spring break this week, so I was hoping to get his number and some of his free time.  This morning I received an email from him!  He said he was disappointed that he didn't see me yesterday because he wanted to get my number and see if I wanted to hang out sometime this week.  Ohhhhh yeah.  Short of it - we're going to see Hidalgo tomorrow. Fun and games of it - Derek introduced me to him.  My roomates are the great girl-friend type who we all share our dramas with.  They're all as excited as I am for tomorrow, and have begun drilling me with questions. I didn't know the answers to any of them, but they said I had to know by Wednesday.   and my fun with the rainbow of boy personalities continues.....

      Maybe he IS a typical guy, and now I'm hurt.  Who is this Emily that people were asking him where she was?  Oooh frustraition.  Especially that I just reassured him that I don't like him as anything more than a friend.  But if he was being dishonest with me....  Ouch.  Today I'm hurt.

      Email analysis.  (Oh goody) Various Emails from various dates and various boys - interuppted by my brain's annotations. Here We Go:  >Let's do Survival Boy first.  This is in reply to my saying I want dinner as payment for lessons.  He asked what kind of dinner, and I said anything but potatos.  He says:  "Oh so you would like me to cook? I think you may be selling your self  short. Besides none of my kitchen experiments have ever turned out and I  wouldn't want to hurt you. Is that your final offer? Could I talk you down to New  Delhi after Institute on Wednesday with the option of the dinner of your choice at some later date?"  ***Young, not cute... but fun enough to dance and flirt with.  Maybe he'll set me up with his big brother.  >Not-Doctor Boy, regarding a pic. of me I sent of me in my "hi Ya" dress from when I was little.  After seeing Hidalgo I told him about it, and he asked for a picture:  "oh, you're so cute.? This picture should definitely go on the website!? Thanks for the pic. How was New York?? Hope you had fun and didn't get lost.?"  ***short sweet, not enough to go on.  Sums it up.  >Derek's Turn (fyi, this is a long one for him.  He knew I had been a little down...):  "I got one of the last parking spots in the stake center lot. I sat up in the third row by the Bishop and [NAME] and [NAME], but my seating was surviving on borrowed light and not the result of celestial timing. I'm sorry you were cast out of the synagogue." *Intelligent and funny use of scriptural phrases.  Yes.  More my style. "I tried to call you last night, but it was busy so I called the Piggy Horns girls in Utah and they kept me up late on the phone." *Young girl that are like nieces/little sisters to him.  Piggy Horns is a silly game they invented when the girls were toddlers.  He likes to play with kids.  Proof.  More bonus points. "I'm not sure what your question is about, but if you're asking about any girls in the ward, there is little to tell and I haven't asked any out." *That was his response to my simple question 'So is her name Emily?' "Anything exciting going on at the farm today?" *He calls where I live "the compound" or "the farm."    ***Yes.  It's fun.  >Direct qoutes from Wanna-Be-Lawyer Boy:  "How has the week been?" *Seven Days last time I checked. "Its been pretty good for me i think." *Are lower case I's a cutesy thing or a self esteem thing?  You only *think* your week was *pretty* good.  Commit to SOME level of decision.  "Work is well and im getting super excited for Conference." *Oo, and contractions without the ' .  I'm super impressed.  ??? "Ive been waiting six months for this conference." *Last one wasn't good enough for you, huh? "I cant wait to recieve some new revelations" *Yeah, cause that's exactly what it is.  'The world's gonna end the day after we get the 354th temple.'  Or ... ok I'll stop. "and just feel the Spirit from the conference." *It's a good spirit, I agree - but something seems a little to Happy-Valley insincere here. "I have some theories about some of the things we will hear." *Ooooo, do tell.  (with the fresh garlic breath level of sarcasm.) "Of course the last time i had theories i was way off lol." *see - there it is. lol.  I have a theory we'll get married.  Oops, way off. "That generally happens. The Lord knows what to address better than I do:)" *Yeah, I'd rather be reading an email from him too. "but If the sermons the GAs have been given lately are any indications there will be mention of Soddom and Gommorah atleast once this weekend. Either way im super excited." *??? Ok.  And I bet they'll mention Gethsemane too.  Or maybe I'm way off.  (Ok, I think I'm needing to repent now.) "Tonight has been kinda sad today." *And just when I was going to try really hard to start being nice!  I'd hire this guy as MY lawyer, wouldn't you? "Been reading about what happened in Iraq today with the contractors being killed and their bodies being dragged through the streets. Its sickening. I saw a photo of it and it made me want to throw up." *That's why I DIDN't LOOK at pictures.  The thought was bad enough. "I just cant comprehend how people can be so careless with life sometimes." *Careless is not the term I would use here.  I am thinking more along the lines of what horrors have these people have been subjected to to drive them to this level of anger? (That was a lot of to-s.) People don't just wake up and think, I'll be "careless with life" today.  Just calling them evil and saying they hate us isn't enough.  The important question is why.  Why do they hate us?  What's the point of the message they're trying to send.  Are we getting it?  As a country, I don't think so.  Ok, this is an email analysis today, not letting me get on a political soap box - "This world can be a frightening place," *I'm not afraid.  I LOVE this world!  "but isnt it like so totally awesome how we have the Gospel in our lives?" *Oh, I know.  It's like soooo totally awesome, dude. [edit out more of the same]  "Anyway just wanted to say hi. Talk to you soon. "  *** I think he's trying to make a positive impression on me?  I really shouldn't laugh at others expense.  But Really!  Maybe impressive if I were twelve.  Ok, then again, maybe not.***  Ok.  Maybe I'm not really as nice as I think I am.

      Nobody wanted to be social on Wednesday night... Doctor-Boy had to leave quickly because he gave his sister a ride and whe was ready to jet right after class.  He sat by me during class... I gave survival boy another short dance lesson after class, but no dinner happened.  I was ok with that. Derek was the last to leave.  I got him to proof my resume for me, as I just finished revising it for the job fair I went to yesterday.  It's *possible* I'll see him Saturday.  We'll see. --- Yesterday Doctor Boy and I ran to a grocery store to get some eats before the game.  Of all the choices in the deli - I chose one piece of spinich pizza.  So did he.  At the movie he did the same thing.  I told him he didn't have to get the same thing as me, but he insisted that was what he wanted (even though he complained about the pizza being healthy?!?).  I don't know if he's just strange, or if it's cultural. (He's Chineese.)  Oh, during dinner conversation I figured out his job has nothing to do with Doctor stuff.  I have totally confused a conversation I had with some other Chineese guy at church, and thought it was him.  I don't know how that happened - and I have NO idea who the REAL doctor boy could be.  We'll have to switch to calling this one Not-Doctor boy.  So the game was fun.  I think I was more into it than he was, and he was just into me - but not in a creepy way. He managed to get his arm up on the back of my chair.  I never nestled into it at all, but I didn't Not let him keep it there.  Blazers played straight up better, but I cheered and clapped as a 76ers fan all the same.  Walking back out to the car, he was holding his arm as if it hurt.  "Are you okay?" I asked.  He looked at the hand of his "hurt" arm looked at my hand, took it in his, and said, "There, now its better."  It was so funny, and no one had gotten me on that one before, so I had to give in.  Silly.  After the game, we pulled his basketball out from his trunk, and shot a few baskets at the church.  I did MUCH better than I expected myself to be able to do after not having touched a ball in years.  The more I threw, the better I got.  He even complimented my form.  I gave a goodbye hug. In short, I'm trying to be open, but the chemistry's just not happening.  I wish I was interested more on that level... I have no real reason not to - but, eh.

      Hopefully the title will work now, and hopefully commenters who know me will be smart enough NOT to use my real name. :0)  I'd rather root for Portland tomorrow, my heart is still in the west.... but as I'll be IN Philly WITH a Philly boy.  I feel slightly (but only slightly) bad about accepting these tickets.  I mean, I'm sure there are sports fans out there who would appreciate them more than I do... but I guess just too bad for them.  I'll have a great time even if it is just because I'll be there for free, with a guy who's interested in me, experiencing something new.

      Movie (Starsky and Hutch) with Derek last night WAS a go - and was a blast.  I definitely could have gotten away with more physical contact... but I kept it at a bare minimum (and those were really all his doing, though I held onto the strings from the hood of his jacket for a long time).  It's a power thing.  HE will now do the chasing, and I will leave him wanting more.  I think I could even have gotten a goodnight kiss out of him... but I left the car with not even a hug, but a very great smile.  He even prolonged the movie by finding dessert afterward.  In his fantastic way of teasing, he said he decided spending time with me was not *that* bad.  Controlling the Derek fun-ride will be so much easier now that Doctor Boy is in the picture. (There was a message from him - he called @ 7 last night.)  Unfortunately... I'll have to do the great balancing act of making sure I don't break any hearts (too badly).  I like Doctor Boy, but it's way too early to tell if there's any potential for really liking him, and I really like Derek, but I don't know if there's potential for him *really* liking me.  And there's wanna-be lawyer on the side.  And another young one too, who I began teaching how to dance.  New one actually used to live in a real live compound in Idaho.  Not only that, but its one I know of... one that was trying to grow right near my parents place.  We shall call him Survival Boy.  He seems recovered and normal now.  I think Philly is as far away from his own private Idaho as he could get.  Don't worry... it was not the kind of compound where racism was a factor.  I couldn't tollerate that.  I have no interest in Survival Boy other than I'll teach as many boys to dance as I can, and make them pay me with dinner and such.  I doubt I'll have to worry about him developing a like for me.  Strictly a dancing relationship.  Happy girl.  Too bad I don't know any of these boys well enough to assign them colors yet.  Survival Boy may be a yellow....

      But back to the kind of nerd that I like . . .   I might get to Movie with The Engineer (namely Derek) Today!  He's Bob Dylan concert going tomorrow, I'll see him at The Intstitute Wed., and he's at a conference the rest of the week.  Do I get to monopolize his one free day?  mmmm I hope.

      I think I'm too nice too people.  But I can't help it.  I'm just nice.  As a result, boys I'm not the slightest bit interested in... the slightly slow on the *social* intelligence side of things... get interested in me, and I have to be very very blunt in my disinterest.  For example... currently its Wanna-be-lawyer Boy.  He does nothing but sit around at his parents' home all day and wait to hear back from law schools he has applied to.  Oh, and he also has been sending me emails - starting last week - that go something like this:  "hey cutie.  I'm bored.  lol. Did you have a good weekend? Wow.  You have a whole circle of friends?  I don't have any friends, so I've just been sitting at my computer bored all day.  Is it ok for me to talk to you? lol."  First - this doesn't sound like a high quality lawyer. My response reprimanded him for calling me cutie.  I told him those sorts of names are usually reserved for when somebody has known me for a long time - and cutie is usually not a word that they come up with.  I also told him he needs to work on his confidence/self esteem issues.  Doesn't sound very nice, huh.  But unfortunately, both my intentions and my presentation of my arguments to him ARE nice.  I want him to figure out how to treat girls (like real people!). Therefore, he keeps emailing me.  Five emails in the last two days.  His response to my "don't call me cutie" was "is hotstuff alright?"  I wrote back and said, "I don't think you get it."  I understand he's trying to be nice and flirty, but he obviously misunderstands me if he thinks "cutie" and emails full of "lol" are going to go anywhere with me.  If I thought he was cute - or if he had given me the impression in person that he was intelligent - things would probably be different.  But I did say straight out that lack of self esteem is a big turn-off.  Always will be.  Don't like 'em cocky, but at least let them be secure.

      Derek has gone to visit his family for the weekend.  Doctor Boy was fun at the Luau (that was secretly a Fiesta in disguise... don't ask) and gave me a hug when he left.  If anything developes there... he definitely won't be afraid to be seen with me in public.  :)  I hung out with Derek's friends after and had icecream too.  They are the general fun crowd that is pretty typical of who I meet through church... though not as cheesey.  No, they weren't cheesey.  Some things were not really my style, but mostly good folks.   One recently made a short movie that he showed us.  It was really quality!  If I can find the link to where it is online I'll post it.  (I had to watch it at his home because it took me way too long to try to download.)  I think I still like Derek more than I should.  Perhaps once he notices Doctor Boy is chasing me, he'll step up and join in the competition.  Or he'll be relieved.  It all depends on if he can figure out how he feels about me.

      Yesterday may have been my only Derek time for the week.  He's getting very slightly more flirty each time we're together in public - but there's still not even close to any idea of us being together.  That made no sense.  Not-Doctor Boy thought I was mad at him becuse he wasn't getting my emails.  I'm worried that he may just be too overly sensitive for me.  But again - still too early to tell.  There might be happenings on Friday... fondue and "A Pyromaniac's Love Story"... and all boys may be there.  Saturday WILL be Wash DC  - no Derek, yes Not-Doctor Boy.

      Not-Doctor Boy wanted to know my schedule for the week on Monday.  I didn't answer him yet because I wanted to give Derek the first choices at filling my schedule.  Derek called Monday night, just to call.  I was hoping he'd mention doing something this week (aka ask me out) but he didn't.  I thought it would be his turn, as I seem to ask him most of the time.  Oh well. He did check to see that I was coming to class Wednesday (tonight).  But c'mon man!  Call me!  Ask me out! It's your turn.  Perhaps I'll ammend my thought about what Derek will do when he learns of Not-Doctor Bay chasing me.  (Did I mention a good friend of Derek's saw Not-Doctor Boy and I together last weekend?) Before I said he'd either step up and compete, or be relieved.  I decided I don't want him to be relieved, but I forgot what I usually do in a situation like that... back off and let the other one go for it.  I don't want Derek to do that!  So, now that I am getting to know his other friends a bit, I think it's time to try to discover what he thinks about things through them... I'll talk to Video Boy... (the friend who made the video I linked to a while back.)  Maybe he'll give me some good news, or at least help clarify.

      I grew up in Utah, where *everyone* (not just Mormons) gets married young.  It's not like I avoided it purposely or was against it or anything - I just knew I wouldn't get hitched that young - call it a feeling/whatever.  My guess was closer to 30 than 20.  (I'm already right!)  If I said I wasn't going to get married at a young age while I lived there, people interpreted it as a low self esteem issue.  "Oh yes you will," they would say reassuringly while patting my arm, "you'll be married before I am for sure." Ok!  Visiting old friends, now married and usually with a child, I was again reassured,  "It's ok.  You'll find somebody."  My thoughts were, "Yeah I know.  I know it's ok.  That's WHY I'm still single.  If I didn't think it was ok, I could easily be married by now."  But I have standards.  If I'm going to commit to a life (and more) partnership with someone - they'd better be worth that commitment.  Now - at only twenty-five - if I go back to visit... it's even worse.  As they reassure me in the usual way, but the look in their eyes says "what's wrong with this girl?  Why isn't she married?  Oh well.  Not all of us are meant to be married in this lifetime."  Yup.  That's it, I'm broken.  Good thing I don't feel that way!  Good thing I've moved out of that land into a land where people still think I'm too young to consider marraige.  (Some people still think I'm a teenager too - upon first meeting.  Hurray for looking younger!)  Marraige and Motherhood always have been goal #1 for me, but that was 'sometime it the future' - until this summer.  When I lived with my sis and her kids I thought, 'this is great!  I wanna do this now.  I'm ready.'    My close married friends tell me they love to hear the drama of my dating life (thus this blog) but they are all so glad they don't have to play that game anymore.  I agree with them.  I'm having fun - but I'm ready for different kinds of fun. Now, I have to be weary of that "I'm-spouse-hunting" smell that always immediately scares others away.  (I know it scares me away!)  I tried, for a moment, a different style and let myself get taken on the dating ride.  Nope, I did'nt like that.  So I'm back to my original format that I like.  I'm in control, and I just sit back, have fun, and take things as they come.  Yes, I'd like things to happen now.  I'm ready to get serious.  But if I push anything, I could end up making a mistake.  I'm not goint to let my sense of urgency lower my standards (nor my fun).

      Survival Boy got another dance lesson last night.  He's going out dancing on Saturday.  I might just go too... it's been a while. I stopped by and visited Derek for just a moment yesterday.  He showed me his current art project (a gift for his parents anniversary), and his latest CD... a folk music group his family loved when he was little. Not-Doc Boy wants to come over and hang out Saturday.  I just learned of some great hiking nearby, so maybe we'll go there.  I like Derek, he doesn't like me back. Not-Doc Boy likes me, I don't like him back. A new girl I met likes Not-Doc Boy - I'd prefer not to be in the way of that. And I'm supposed to be hunting for my next job...

      Iíve come to the conclusion that my dream man cannot exist.  Iíve had two boyfriends now that were everything I wanted - EXCEPT.... they were both missing one key important factor for what I want in a partner. I decided last weekend that if I did marry someone who was exactly what I wanted in every way... how would I learn from that?  How would I improve?  Truly, other than self gratification, how would I improve.  So have I thrown my wish-list out the window?  Of course not.  It still shines bright and hopeful.  Itís just prioritized into what qualities are comprisable or not.  I mean, Iím sure thereís an intelligent, faithful, LDS, liberal, politically active, artistically talented, outdoors loving, dancing, singing, heterosexual, gorgeous, relatively skinny-but-toned, well dressed but not obsessed or spends excessively on frivolity, not-too tall, dark, articulate, good cuddler and kisser, fun and games loving, supportive, aged between 24 and 34 man who can provide a steady income for a family he loves, somewhere in the world.... but odds are some other lucky girl will find him before I do... and sheíll benefit more from his love than I would anyway.  So Iíll just demand the basics... Iím still not gonna ìsettle.î

      So I was wanting to talk a little bit with Not-Doc Boy, just to clarify and make sure I don't lead him on - but I never really had the chance. So yesterday, in the middle of this potluck, he starts asking me these questions: "When was the last time you had a boyfriend? What did you think about that basketballgame?  Was that moving too fast for you?" Why do you want to know? It was fun.  Yes. Moving too fast?  Already?  As if we've gone somewhere?  Yes - clarification was needed, and oh well if other people are around and might hear.  He brought it up. So I tell him I am a slow go-er.  Boyfriends are something that just happens - evolving out of certain friendships.  "So you think we should be friends first? yeah, I think friends should come first. That's what my sister says too."   That doesn't mean friends can't go on dates and stuff, I make sure to clarify. Turns out, he's never had a girlfriend... never even kissed anyone.  Not one of these again!  Why do *I* always end up being a first attempt at a girlfriend.  What's with these guys? Also, I found out Not-Doc Boy is 22... or was it 23.  I'm in the middle of being 25.  Not that it's a big age difference or anything - he just thought I was younger.  They always do.  Just because I don't do the make-up sophisticated lady thing.  I'd like to be a kid still (with maturity I hope).  Some guy I don't know very well was asking me if Not-Doc Bay and I were together.  (We *were* talking in public after all.  And more than once.  Oh my!)  No.  Not at all.  Dates, yes.  But I'm totally available.  (Hear that Derek?)  So, as far as I'm concerned things are good here too.  - Wanna-be lawyers' been thankfully low key.  He did email me today, but I think my reply was around four words long. - Survival Boy gets another dance lesson Wednesday.

      And it was a good weekend.  I had Friday off for the holiday, so I wanted to do something Thursday.  Wednesday night Derek had said he was busy Thursday - going to a record store... instant translation: he has a date and he's embarrased to admit it to me.  But after work Thursday, just as I was snuggling in to veg in front of a movie for the evening - Derek calls.  Plans fell through - do I want to go out for dinner?  YES!  So I go to his place, and we go out to Baja Fresh (YUM YUM!!!).  He was being unflirty - but he seemed very tired.  (Wednesday was a rather late night.)  I had been very tired, but the adrenaline from Derek calling me hadn't worn off and I was full of energy.  Anyway, he says yes he IS tired.  He *was* going to be going to the record store and be taken out for mexican food by someone else, but she had some things come up.  He never did say her name - so I teased him that he didn't want me to know who she was because he liked her.  He denyed it, saying she's just a friend who likes good music and they sometimes go to concerts together.  Well, after dinner we're sitting at his place, and the phone rings.  Its her.  I'm quiet and well behaved (as usual) but not only so I could try to hear what she was saying.... ;)  I DID hear her name, though.  Same as mine!  So after he gets off - we suddenly start talking - like, real friend talking.  Who does he like, really - who's been chasing him (Yes, I knew cute blonde divorced girl had been!  But she scared him and got nowhere with him, score for me!) who's been chasing me.  I got him to give me names of guys that like me.  That's fun.  He DID know about Not-Doctor Boy.  See, they're somewhat friends, and Not-Doctor Boy found out that Derek had been going out with me.  Not-Doc. Boy said "Ah man, I wanted to ask her out!" and Derek replyed "I don't have a monopoly on her or anything."  So I told him the scoop.  We'd been out, he's made his interest very clear, he's a nice guy, but there's nothing there for me. We talk about scary people and the way they pursue.  I tell him all about Wanna-be Lawyer and the rest.  He explains that he either flirts (in public) with girls, or does stuff with them.  Never both.  Maybe one day we'll get him over it - be it with me, or with another girl with my support as his friend.  I told him how LDS dating has always been difficult for me because of the amount of expectation for a "real" relationship, and the automatic "possible future spouse" evaluation.  He agreed.  Yup, on the other hand, I'm used to guys who let me cuddle and it doesn't have to "mean" something. "It's good to be able to talk to a girl" he says.  So this talking was like a major breakthrough.  Derek finally feels like the kind of guy friends I usually have... that eventually accidentally turn into something more.  We decided to watch one episode of Malcom in the Middle before I left.  "Well, I'm still going to cuddle with you even after all that talking," says I.  His response, "Just as long as we're clear."  Clear as stretched celephane.  He's turning into quite the good cuddler.  I is a very happy girl. :)

      I wanted to go camping tonight!  Derek and I had been planning it since Monday - but we can't find ANYONE else to go... and therefore he called me last night to say it's a No Go.  I'm so bummed!  We're still gonna do something tonight, but I'm not really excited.  It will be the first one-on-one time with Derek in a while, but there's no excitement for that like there used to be.  Mostly 'cause we won't be camping.

      So Derek and I were trying to recruit for camping, and got mostly no's, but I think it's still a go.  We found a few people to go.  With an undercurrent of understanding Derek said, "I can probably persuade Not-Doc Boy to be there if you want."  I immediately shook my head no, and there was an unspoken OH! from Derek.  Later I said, "Yeah, about that.  Don't encourage him.  It's been a little overwhelming as of late - but you don't know what that's like." With an added wink (reffering to my own behavior toward Derek, as well as formerly mentioned blonde girl).  Smile and nod, "No, not at all."  "But I just want to be friends with you... so." and it stopped there.  I don't want to be to Derek what Not-Doc Boy is to me... but there ARE important differences.  I have been honest from the get go with Not-Doc Boy that I am not interested in that way.  I will smile and flirt, and let him take me out and such... but I never kissed him, and the little bit of hand holding was all his doing and I even told him it was too much.  He occasionally puts his arm around me, but he does that with others.  I don't settle in, or even attempt to cuddle with him, and he still just keeps being right there - DEREK held my hand, HE did kiss me, and as he'd never kissed anyone before, I thought he meant something by it. And when I cuddle, even though we clarified nothing is meant by it... he cuddles back.  But now we are clear, and know he just wants a friendship - but he will sometimes give personalized flirtations.  So I'm not going to deal with any of it.  I'm totally not interested in anyone - which makes the idea of not staying in the area based on whatever job I get just fine.  And I'll begin again my efforts to meet NEW guys here too.

      Derek and I are planning a camping outing for Friday - and planning to invite a bunch of people.  He personally emailed Not-Doc Boy to invite him.  I was hoping he wouldn't be there.  He called to tell me he couldn't come.  I know they're friends, but is Derek personally inviting him because he knows how much Not-Doc Boy likes me... you know "Yellow's going to be there"... or just because they're friends?  Not-Doc Boy isn't the camping type at all.  He's the hip-hop let's play basketball or tennis type.  Nice guy, not my type.  Derek is the folk & indie rock camping and outdoors as much as possible type. I know.  I'm going to tell Derek not to be helpful... don't HELP Not-Doc Boy have more opportunities with me.  He's really starting to bother me... He's a nice guy, I don't want to hurt his feelings, but more and more I KNOW I'm not interested.

      Remember the list... and how I need to hang on to the "must haves" and be willing to compromise on the "I'd like him to haves" ?  Well, as far as marraige goes, being LDS is a must have.  So does that mean I don't even go out with boys who aren't?  I mean - I really do know how easy it is to fall in love, and how hard it is to really look hard at and evaluate those "must haves."  I don't want to be too serious about everything from the get-go . . . but I also don't want to be wasting too much more time.  Also - if I do even go out with non-Mormon boys, Mormon boys who I would like to date look down on me and think I have lower standards - and that's not a good thing.  But what if I'm only here for a few more months anyway.  It wouldn't be long enough to fall in love with any non-Mormons - and then it would kind of be a waste of time not to date whoever I get a chance to.  Every date, and every relationship (whether its major or not) is a preparation.  It teaches you how to deal with different people, and further develop your relationship skills so that when you do find one to commit your life to, you can have good experience under your belt.  And Derek will probably never get around to liking me enough anyway.  I think I'll casually ask Derek his opinion of girls who date non-members.  Or I could always just have as much fun as possible one moment at a time... But that's what I did in North Carolina, and that had disasterous consequences.  But that wasn't my fault!  I didn't know those boys were mentally unstable!

      And then there was dancing.  I had never driven into the city (Philly) on a weekend night before - and was unprepaired for the long time to find parking - and then to actually find where the dancing was.  It was on UPenn's campus - which I know close to nothing about.  There was some large event going on, so swarms of students were out and about - drunk.  I finally found the dance, found a corner to hide my stuff in, and found the guy who invited me to be there.  He needs a name... this new guy - 'cause its possible there will be more talk of him.  He interviewed me for a job a few weeks ago... at a political related organization (and yes - its leftist)... he's cute, he dances relatively well (not a hardcore lindy hopper, but a good lead for sure)... I'm interested... but he's of course not Mormon.  We'll call him Boss Man.  Yes, that's perfect.  It's fits swing lingo, politics, and how I met him.  So Boss Man was a good dancer, and pointed out a few people I should dance with.  I danced with a few more people who pointed out more people I should dance with. And thus the night continued.  I sat down for only a few songs - so i could breathe - and had to turn down about two people per dance I sat out.  Tiring - and more fun than I've had dancing in a looong time.  After dancing, "the regulars" go out to a local diner and eat.  Boss Man invited me, another guy, who was friends with Boss Man invited me, and yet again, a third guy invited me.  Success - when you dance well enough that you get invited to "hang out with the dancers" your first night in the new town.  And hanging out was a great time too.  There was a group of people from church there as well - I said hello to them, but otherwise was too busy dancing with people who knew what they were doing.  One tried to dance with me, but he was doing the country (wanna-be-a-swing-dancer) style where they have no rhythm, mave as fast as they can, and rip your arms out in the process.  I stopped - because I'm unwilling to let a guy hurt me - and  went back to dancing with real swing dancers.  The church people now believe me... I told them I can dance! :)  But this interest in Boss Man brings up all sorts of complicated issues, which I'll probably write about in my next post.

      Not-Doc Boy had been bugging me all week to do something on Saturday.  Of course, I was already going dancing Saturday night - so it had to be a daytime activity.  Well, I just got a map of a nearby state park - and discovered there's a large lake with a beach within five miles of my place.  So, we had a great picnic (well - he selected the food, and I'm too picky about food to be overly imppressed... but I'm happy he made his own decisions about food for once) on a great day outside.  We talked more about our previous dating experiences.  He never dated because he was insecure about being overweight.  It's surprising to believe he was ever either.  He comes off as so confident, and he's very fit.  I thought the talk was good enough for him to really understand that I think he's a great guy, but there's just no interest in him as a boyfriend.  But he was still his constantly pursuing self on Sunday, so I think I'm going to have to spell things out in black and white for him.

      I was a popular girl around 2:30pm last Friday.  Survival Boy called to say "A bunch of people are getting together to watch A Pyromaniac's Love Story, and we need to know if you and the movie will be there."    Then, I'm told Derek is on another line calling!  Derek has first priority. . . so I tell Survival Boy I'll call him back.  Derek likes the idea and says "Let's Do It" so I called Survival Boy back to say, Yes, the movie, Derek, and I will all be there.  "So are you two dating?" asks Survival Boy... He heard (A while ago) something about Derek going out (on a few dates) with "a Yellow." (names changed for my privacy.)  As he knows several Yellows, he didn't know who.  But he actually saw Derek and I together at one point and made the connection.  (Although, I know Derek HAS been out a few times with another Yellow.)  But "no" I reply.  "We go on dates - but we're not together.  I like him, but oh well."  "Well Derek's a good guy"  "I Know!" So I dig a little.  He heard - there was talk of me?  What was said???  Nothing good or bad, just that he had been on same dates with me.  But there was talk... so even if he's afraid to be seen with me in public, he's not so afraid that he hides the fact that we've been on dates.  That's a step.  Survival Boy's best friend is a really cute Dental Student... whom he had encouraged to go after Derek 'cause he's a good guy. Luckily for me - she was really far too agressive and scared him off.  I think I've written about this before.... so back to what happened Friday.  Shortcut to the action: We meet up in Philly.  Not Doc Boy, Survival Boy, and Derek are all there (as well as others).  We walk to the park - and Not-Doc boy is doing his usual paying attention to only me.  We play frisbee.  I'm the only girl whe plays.  I have lots of energy. Life is good.  Then, it's time we decide to go watch movie and order pizza.  (Not Doc pays my portion for the pizza.) I have to walk back to my car and get the movie first, and Derek has to go put away his frisbees (The Jumbo Mother, and Lightning).  Drama Queen girl has to get games out of her car, and Not Doc boy just wants to go wherever I go.  So the four of us take a detour on the way to the party apartment.  Drama Queen (don't get me wrong - I don't mean to be negative, she's a great person, Drama Queen just describes how she is) is obviously noticing that both guys are paying attention to me, and neither are giving her the attention every Drama Queen needs.  I'm all for Not-Doc Boy giving her attention... but the Yellow in me just loves the attention as well - so I soak it up.  Not-Doc Boy sees a couple walking and proclaims "PDA!"  "What," I say, "You have a problem with it?"  "No - not really" he replies. Derek and I are flirting over the frisbee.  "PDA!" announced Not Doc Boy.  So I go over and give him a quick hug so he can get some PDA too - but go right back to giving Derek my attention.  At the movie - Derek sat next to me . . . but still with enough distance and inattention to me that he felt comfortable not letting anyone else think anything of our sitting next to eachother.  Later, after the movie, my back was hurting.  Not Doc boy helped by pounding on it for a little while.  I wasn't complaining.  Then... even more frisbee.  This time, it was a little colder outside - so I used some body heat.  Linked arms with Derek on the right and Not Doc Boy on the left.  And that's pretty much how the night went.   Derek and I decided at the same time that we needed to go home.  So finally, we had some one on one time on the walk back to our cars.  (Derek was a walking zombie at this point, but my energy had only just begun to wane.)  But at this point - suddenly - there was no flirting, and hardly any talking.  He walked near the other side of the sidewalk, and didn't even come close to a hug before he got into his car.  He almost didn't even SAY goodbye.  I'm going to mark it up to tiredness - only because I don't want to place any meaning where it may not belong. (No really, I'm not in denial.)

      So I thought about going dancing Saturday when Survival Bay mentioned he was going, but when I got home that night it became clear - I was definetly going.  There was a message on my answering machine from a previously unmentioned boy - letting me know about dancing this weekend and telling me I should be there.  So there it was.

      He emails in reply to mine today:  "If you're wearing your red pants, it must be a good day. Nice blue sky, but a little chilly... Would you be up for an evening hike at that state park tomorrow?  "I'm sorry if I've made you feel bad by being weird. Notwithstanding my intermittent states of confusion, I've always enjoyed Yellow Time. And I still rank your attempt to secretly pay for dinner in Millville when I caught you with a sly smile on your face as one of the coolest things done by a girl on a date. Not that this is your funeral, and I don't think you should not look in Philly for a job."

      Have you ever had one of those dreams that just feels important?  I had several last night, and for some reason, even during them, I asked to remember them because they were of some importance - but during the dream it was mostly just watching.  This morning I woke up and began writing down images I could remember, as fast as I could.  I filled up the rest of my current journal with it.  As I was finishing up, I recognized some patterns - and maybe even some of the possible significance.   There were three things, one of which was always there: The cute boys from the baseball team in high school, Latino Boys, or Derek.   All of these were desires of mine at one time or another, but I had no desire for them in my dream.  I was happy without them.  I think this clinches it.  Derek is not for me, and I can go on having fun with him, and not have to worry about liking him more than I should.  I feel great this morning!  (This was an episode from My So Called Life!  Now I just need my best girl friend to hook up with Derek - but I don't have a best girl friend, and Derek isn't anything like Jordan Catalano!)

      The phone call came.  It was pleasant, but... "You already know what my short answer is" says he.  And?  "I like hanging out with you.  You're a fun girl."  I know that much!  But that doesn't answer my questions...  One answer comes secured: "Well, I don't hang out with you just because you're flattering..."   One option I had given him (for why he acts the way he does) was that he hangs on to me because the fact that I like him is flattering, so he flirts when it's convenient (when we're alone) because it makes him feel good, and evades me when it's convenient (when others are around) because it makes him feel awkward. "There are plenty of flattering girls I don't hang out with..." "I'm not quite as scary as they are" "yeah" he laughs. "yet" I add.  Another option I had given him:  That he just takes each moment as it comes, and doesn't put any effort into trying to figure it out as I may be leaving soon anyway.  His reply: He actually has put some time into trying to figure things out.  He just hasn't. "I don't really have a long answer... I thought we were clear on things." He concludes.  Well, we were - I explain.  As I told him before, I will cuddle with "just friends," but I will guard my flirting if there's no chance for me liking them more...  I'm not really one to talk, I admit, sometimes I flirt more than I realize - but I'm always honest I'll tell a guy if he's got no chance, or needs  to back off or slow down.   It's just that he's an extremely sincere guy... he couldn't even give these girls hugs because he didn't feel sincere about it.  So when he flirts with me, I wonder if he means anything by it.  I just don't want him to lead me on without realizing it.  He gets what I'm saying.  But he doesn't know, "I guess I just don't have much practice." "That's your own fault." "Well, I always choose what kind of awkward it's going to be.  Me either doing too much or too little.  Lately its been too little 'cause I'm sick of feeling stupid when I do too much." "I feel stupid a lot around you," I say. "Sorry to make you feel stupid!" he says. "It's my choice, it's not your making it happen."  He used to - in his own words - stalk girls.  (Not STALK, but try too hard.)  I don't believe it!  It's true.  And look what's happened.  He's scared one too many girls, that now he's almost afraid to do anything. If only I could be overly and cutely pursued by someone I was interested in.  I don't want to scare Not-Doc boy into doing too little... but you've gotta be sure the feeling is mutual when going for the real sweet stuff.  I'm very level headed - but a true romantic at heart.  I must admit, my dream response would have been for him to drive out here, and surprise me with flowers and a bear hug and say "I'm sorry!"  But Dreams.  Reality told me we'd end where we did...  "Well, I guess it's good enough" I say.  "Not clear as glass, but clear as cellophane." Amazingly, he totally understands!  "Sometimes transparent, sometimes translucent-" "Yup, depending on if it's stretched tight or crumpled... so we're good - until I go crazy next time."  He laughs. I guess so - We go on to talking about if I'll get to go camping or at least get in some good play time before my time is done here...

      So today was area conference.  I was tired, but had to get there early to get in.  With the extra time before it began, I did some reading, and then began to write out my thoughts...  Which turned into writing out all my thoughts of different reasons Derek acts the way he does.  Which turned into a letter explaining why I don't want to put up with this.  I'd like to be his friend, but it's just more than I feel like dealing with when I always have to wonder if there's any hope in liking him, or if I bother him, or what.  I sometimes write out letters like that just to get them off my chest, and then I feel better.  But I didn't feel better.  I knew I had to do something drastic.  I had to give him the letter.  So after the meeting was over, I began working my way back to where he was.  Every time I looked and saw where he was, and then was stopped by something else, he had gone to somewhere different.  (Did he see me coming and was he trying to avoid it?  But I had to get this note to him.  Cheesey Middle School Style, yes... but I had to.)  Stopped by Drama Queen- "You're coming to dinner with us?" Can't, too tired.  (It's true, work yesterday was tiring and I NEEDED extra sleep today.) Stopped by Not-Doc Boy- "Blah blah blah smalltalk."  I notice Derek and his friends are huddle together, and look over in my direction with a smirky smile - his friends, not him.  (This is so like Jr. High all over again!)  Are they smiling because they're watching how I handle Not-Doc Boy coming at me when they now know I'm not interested?  Are they smiling because Derek's doing a beter job at evading me than I am at avoiding Not-Doc?  I hate this.  I'm nervous.  I'll play the game.  I can't walk up and give Derek a note like this in front of all his friends. I go to the girl I visit teach, and try (in-vain as always... I try so hard!) to set up a time to meet with her.  "Maybe like during the last ten minutes of church next week" she says... after doing a pretty good job of ignoring me and talking to every other new person that comes up to her - offering them candy.  Well, even if she HAD offered me any, I was fasting today, so I would have refused... but I'm already nervous and her with her usual "you're just not cool enough for me" vibe is not helping. Where'd he go?  There putting away chairs.  He's somewhat separated from others - for his comfort's sake his talking to me may not be noticed by anyone.  His hands are full of chairs, so I just slip it in his shirt pocket and say "I have something for you before I dissapear."  "OK" he says cooly.  We joke often about "scary girls."  I prefaced the note with: "Warning This Is Scary. (Especially for me.)"  Now I just wait for a response...  I'm nervous and ready to move far away, meet Mr. Perfect and get on with my life.

      Like I said, I wasn't excited to hang out with Derek.  Friday, I tried emailing him early in the day to see if maybe he would come out here, I didn't want to make the drive.  (I just realized with gas and tolls it costs me around $8 every time I go into Philly.)  Well he never called and said he'd come, so I took a nap after work to try to untired myself, and give him a little more time to possibly call and say he'll come my way instead.  No luck.  I called before I left saying to his voicemail "Either you didn't get my message, or you didn't want to come, so I'll be there in a bit."  When I got there, NOBODY WAS HOME!  I knew he was expecting me, but I was a little worried that maybe he did go to my place and forgot that he didn't tell me.  So I walked around the building, and his car was still there.  So I went back to his door again.  Maybe he was sleeping - knocked on his window - nothing.  I waited in my car for about ten minutes, trying to decide what to do.  Went back to his door for one last try, and it began to rain.  I sat down on his porch and thought about how much longer I would wait before leaving.  Soon, I felt the pressure of a door opening, and saw lights flick on.  (I enter from his back door, as you can't get to his front door without key access to the building, and the call buttons to let you in don't work.)  There was Derek, in shorts and a Tshirt, sweating and breathing hard.  He had gone running.  (He does that whenever the weather's decent.)  "I thought you were coming later," says he.  We had discussed 6 or 7.  It was a quarter after 7.  I come inside and his phone rings.  It's his friend - and he talks to him, ignoring me, for what seems like forever.  I lay on his couch, read a little, and then attempt to pretend to take another nap.  He talks, goes to him room to talk and change, and talks more on the phone.  Finally, he gets off and says "sorry."  He then goes on to tell me a synopsis of the story of his day up to that very moment, I honestly don't remember what he said, except for that he ended with "so that's my story, what's yours?"  So - I tell him my story, including not wanting to drive out there, and then feeling stood up, and then feeling ignored.  I smile.  It was nice to let him know how I felt.  He smiles and says, "Good, we're all caught up then."  From then on out for the rest of the night, he's back to the guy that makes me like him.  Dinner is just my style - simple, healthy... and he lights a little scented candle and dims his lights with a giggles (we're eating finger food right off the serving plates on a card table).  "I do have dimming lights! We can have a candle light dinner," he says.  We eat, he puts in the movie we planned to watched. ("Gigantic: A tale of two Johns"... a documentary of They Might Be Giants.) He turns off the light and we're on the couch.  I lean on his shoulder, the same way I do with all guy friends who a)do not have a girlfriend/wife or b)like me too much and I don't want to lead them on.  HE begins the tickling and the flirting and slightly extends the lenghth of time holding hands while keeping my hands away from being able to tickle him back.  So then we get ice cream, listen to some CD's - and I drive the long stretch home late at night.  We both lost track of time and were surprised at how late it was.  "No wonder I'm tired" he says and I think.  I do not give him, nor do I try for a goodbye hug.  I just leave.  And I'm angry.  Not Angry-angry, just angry. I don't want to like him.  It's not fair that I should decide not to like him and then he treats me like he does and I can't help liking him.  Grrrrrrr

      ...it wasn't.  I'm out $5 gas - $3 tolls - and 6 hours of a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I brought my own food to the BBQ, just in case, and I'm so glad I did.  Hot dogs and hamburgers are ick.  I like BBQ, but only in certain instances... shall we say Gormet BBQ.  A Snob.  Yes.  Ok. I admit it. Some ultimate frisbee was ok, and the few times I got a chance to be involved I did very well.  I contributed to some goals, even.  But too many times of being wide open and completely ignored brought back elementary school and Young Women's sports bad memories.  And I didn't meet any new guys.  I was totally uncomfortable.  With everyone. Although, Survival Boy was there.  I overheard him admitting to someone else that he has a crush on me.  Hello!  What is it with these YOUNG boys!  So discovering that made me uncomfortable with even him.  You know those times where you're surrounded by people and you feel totally alone. YSA activities are that way for me about 98% of the time.  Sometimes it's depressing.  Sometimes, you don't care, because anyone you'd care to be with is no where to be found.  Today was that second one.  Speaking of people I'd rather be with, I'd really like to get a job in Philly.  Derek just needs more time, but I think he'll figure out how much he likes me.  But right now, I only have one more month here, and that's not enough time.

      Woops.  I totally missed getting to do anything with anyone tonight. I had to go into Philly early for an interview, and wasted a bunch of time waiting for 7pm to roll around, as that is the standard time "people" meet at the institute to do "stuff."  At 7:30 one person showed up, and at 8 we gave up.  I just checked my email and I guess today they met at 6 to go to a baseball game.  And I totally could have been there!  Oh well.  Because I have no cell phone, and had no access to a phone, I wasn't able to call and find out what time or where Salsa dancing was, so I had to drive the hour back home.  I also didn't have the expected chance to change into my contact lenses - so I was pretty blind driving in the dark with my glasses.   Loads of fun.   Ah well.  Another mellow Friday night home alone.  I WILL figure out where things are happening tomorrow.  Valley Forge should be on a map.  There's swing dancing to live music tomorrow night I'll have to try to get to also.  Oh, the interview went ok.  It's very possible they'll offer me a job.  Now I must hurry and decide if it's something I even want to do.

      Derek called, just to say hey.  Hey.  He is still saying "You should stay and work in Philly."  I agree.  Idaho White finally called back last night.  I told him I had a chance to move back there, but turned it down. "I'm leaving here soon enough anyway."  Later when I worded it "What would you think if I moved back?" His reply was "That would be good."  That made me feel happy.  He would take me back.   No, Yellow, No.  Remember - I've moved on.  Yes I have.   Plans for this weekend: Salsa dancing tonight  (danger! danger! fun ahead) , Hiking around Valley Forge tomorrow.  Will I get/give digits this weekend?  Chances are pretty high.

      I first met Utah White, and I learned that, yes, I  could  settle down and have  A  Boyfriend.  (He was a really good one, too.)     When I originally met Idaho White, I thought that I would probably never find someone as well-matched for me as Utah White was.  But I learned that moving on  can  be moving better.   (No offense Utah White - I know you sometimes read this.)   But then I had to prioritize.  After Idaho White I learned that Moving On does not have to mean Letting Go.   (I posted a nice blog on this - I wish I knew how to link you to it.)   And I think I have also learned that I can  Move Up , and don't have to  Give Up .  There just may be some man who has the qualities I both  Require  and  Desire .  I spoke with a completely random (in a good way) Red in California, and though I would expect nothing to ever come of a possibility for a relationship-type-thing, (CA, NJ, PA, Oh Hey) I have again a reassurance that  "My Type"  does exist - not just on paper.  I often wonder if my expectations are completely unrealistic.  But I don't think they are.  I think they are reasonable.  And so, again determined,  I will not settle . . . but I  would  prefer to be a wife and mother in this lifetime. :)

      So I'm in the midst of choosing what job to take next.  I know that "what I will be doing is secondary to where I am" although, the blessing did not mention anything regarding finding "him."  *I could hold out for three weeks until the position at my current job becomes available, but I know I'll have to turn down other offers to do that, and there's always the chance that I won't get hired here.  *I may have the choice to move to rural Massachussets, for a job that sounds fun and would greatly further my current career, but also sounds like not much time for social life - which is what I need if I plan on furthering my ultimate career goal.  I don't even know if there would be any LDS population there.  *I could work that political job, which would take he to Seattle, Portland, or leave me here.  It seems like a lot of fun, but again, too many working hours.  *I could take the Idaho job, and go back to Moscow - a place I love.  But then there's Idaho-White, and ALL the old Swing Dancers.  I know it would be fine to see them, but I don't know if I want Old-Blue-Boy waking me up in the middle of the night to play his therapist again.  (He had a girl break his heart and refuses to get over it.)  *I could go back to NC and be close to family and work at the bookstore temporarily again.  There's a great potential AirForce Boy there, but there's also the Young-and-crazy-but-beautiful-Cousins who were fighting over me when I left.  I would prefer to avoid them.  *Or, I could disregard all options and keep looking at new ones.  "I'll go where you want me to go Dear Lord," it would help to know where that is, though.

      Derek has great taste in music.  (I suspected as much, which was my initial attraction to him.)  I'm borrowing two CD's from him now.  One I like so much I can't really stop listening to it.  And NO - it's not just because they're his.  I got a job offer that would move me back to Idaho - right back where I used to be.  Hello Idaho-White.  Hello soap opera drama of everyone I knew there.  Do I really want to be a "back from her coma" character in this soap?  I think... probably not.  I don't think I should go back and fall in love with Idaho-White again.  We've both decided that we just don't have the same ideas on how we should get to our destination.  It's difficult to travel side-by-side with someone if I want to take a miada, and he'd prefer the tricycle.

       LDS Boys don't know how to date.   They approach things the same way they do on their mission when they are asking someone to read the Book of Mormon, or get baptized or something.  The idea is, well, ok - I mean, "building a relationship of trust" first and all that is a good idea - but in reality it makes dating an awful affair for girls like me.  Here's the key difference: One Date IS NOT the same as a life changing commitment to convert to a whole new way of life by joining the LDS church.  One Date IS NOT a commitment!  Wait 'till you  know  the person first before stressing over marriage potential!  But, because they look at it the same, they put  so  much pressure into it that most of them are just terrible at even asking girls out at all.    This lack of dating is a serious concern to any leadership of young single adults.  Therefore, the boys are occasionally given "The Lesson."  "You need to date these young women in our ward.  It is part of your priesthood responsibility.  How will you ever marry if you can't date?  Brethren, will you commit to asking one girl out this week or month?  Do your duty!"  And so, the men come out of class today... several have been scared to death and quickly sneak away before they have to look at any girls and feel guilty - especially since that one girl they can't stand keeps stalking and knows today was "The Lesson."  Much worse, several guys exit with a new found determination:   scoping their prey... who should I ask? who should I ask?  Is she cute enough?  Would she go out with me?  Could I stand being married to her?  Whoa buddy.  Hi.  It's me.  Just a girl - sure I'd go out, but right now I feel like part of a menu in a swarm.  Would you prefer sugar candy, steak, or fresh vegetables?  But also, why not look to me as a possible FRIEND first?  Can we JUST go out?  What's scary is these are the days it's hardest to avoid those "social misfits."  Bad haircut, bad glasses, unbecoming personality is RIGHT THERE at my side everywhere I turn.  I've done good at avoiding until now (at least in  this  ward) but today there is no escaping talking to him.  I DO, however, manage to escape the building without being asked on a single date.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't like a date - but I'd prefer one without this pressure, thank you.

      Three days in a row with Derek Time, and all is well.  The flirting is still on high level, the kissing is still non-exisitant, and the "I feel fine" level is completely in check.  I'm just having fun without a worry where he's concerned now.  Thursday, he came for a walk around the nearby state-park with me.  Friday, he was working in Jersey, so he stopped by afterwards.  Saturday was a DC Temple trip.  We weren't in the same car, but I saw him and NotDoc Boy there for a moment.  That night I had planned to go dancing in Philly.  But when I got to the place where the dance was last time, the building was locked and nobody was there.  I had double checked the date online, but not the location.  Oh well, my bad.  So, instead I stopped by for a surprise visit at Derek's.  We watched a movie and had a great time.

      Yup.  Family wins.  (Ok, that's a good thing.) No boy willing to hang out with Yellow.  I can do better, anyway.  Too bad I'm going to be really cute and charming at church tomorrow.  Especially since I'm almost done there.  If I can finally be brave enough to actually talk to anyone...   ---On a Totally Different, and much more serious note---   So why do girls have it figured out that personality and brains really DO matter more than looks (but of course we'll take looks if we can get 'em) but guys will flip if a girl decides to . . . oh, let's say, not shave their legs?  Not all guys, I realize, but seriously.  Most cultures out there understand how ridiculous it is to make a woman shave, but in our culture guys literally cringe.  FYI - I am shaving, now.  I didn't last summer, for several reasons: -My boyfriend (Idaho White) not only didn't care, but looked at me and seriously understood, "Why do you shave, anyway?" -Buying razors, especially ones that do a halfway decent job and don't cause me to brake out in rashes or give me ingrowns are expensive, and I was (am) really poor. -Rashes, and ingrowns are common, and  they don't feel or look pretty.  -The people I knew in the town I lived in weren't bothered by it. -My father, has always been VERY bothered by women who don't shave.  I wanted to see if it was possible to open his (or anyone in my family's for that matter) mind about it.  I think it just made them all think I'm even stranger than they already thought I was. -I have stubble that pricks my legs by the end of the day anyway, and that hurts too.  When you just let it grow, it's not a problem.  (Guys leg hair isn't a problem.)   -But mostly, it was for my own being ok with myself.   Body hair has always been the no.1 thing I've been self conscious about, and was the biggest thing that always made me feel miserable about my self image.  For some girls it's weight, or shape, or something else.  I've got a great shape, actually.  But there are people out there who are fat because they live unhealthy lifestyles, and there are people out there who do everything they can, and are still fat because of some medical condition.  And people have stood up and said "get over it!"  Loud and clear.  People stand up and say "It's ok to be big, you are still beautiful!"  But NOBODY says that about the girl with facial hair.  People not only think, but say really loudly, "ew gross."  Everybody does!    This affected my self esteem in a BIG WAY.  So, I did it (not shaving) for myself.  If I can appreciate myself and feel beautiful at my hairiest, than I can accept myself the way my Heavenly Father made me, and I can love other people the way Heavenly Father made them too. It was actually a wonderful experience for me, and I miss having someone like Idaho White around who loved me in such a Christ-like way.  But now, I shave again.  I don't have that kind of support, and right now, I feel like I'm *so much* "in the world," with big city and hip fashion all around me (instead of my little granola-artsy town) that even at my dressiest I feel like my linens are not fine twined enough.  It's hard enough finding an LDS guy who suits my tastes, but one who would be ok with me not shaving?  I gotta let them have that for now -   But I don't want to change.  I want to stick to my belief that modesty is truly humility in appearance - not just covering yourself, but not getting "holier than thou" based on style or name brand.  If you don't know me, no - I am not a slob, and I'm not ugly.  I actually love dressing up.  I am confident enough not to wear make-up, and most people these days are learning to be ok with women letting their face show.  But I really really wish people could truly love all things about who they are.  Yes, exercise, eat healthy, have good hygiene, care for your body-temple.  But let it be loved how it was created!  You ARE SO BEAUTIFUL - and so am I.   You'll never love who you want to be if you can't love who you are right now.

      I find anonymous commenters irritating.  At least come up with some silly name or  something .  Creativity is a requirement when dealing with a Yellow.  On a brighter note - I bought a big floppy hat to wear for my next three Saturdays of working all day in the sun.  I've only purchased one hat before--A baseball cap from Disneyland.  Baseball caps look terrible on me.  I almost bought this cowgirlish hat, YeeHaw!, but then I saw it in the mirror and it was icky on me.  I then decided I'll just go out and get sunburned (no matter how much sunscreen, scalp burn happens).  Then I just randomly tried on floppy hat and a big smile happened in the mirror.  I rarely shop, or buy anything *new* for that matter, but when a hat can make me smile like that... it's for work.  Yes.  A Floppy Work Hat.  Good.

      but when you spend every weekend hanging out with them, it makes it difficult for the girl who is pursuing you (but not yet at the stage of being invited to the parents - that can be a big stage for some) to ever get to do anything on weekends.  Hey Derek! This is my last non-working weekend before I might be leaving town!  Do you realize what you're missing?  (I obviously heard from Derek.  He's been out of the office, so he hasn't read emails.)

      It's possible the really good Monday Evening scared Derek a little, as I haven't heard from him since.  But I'm going to vote that he's just been busy.  Hopefully I'll hear from him before tonight, as I'll be out his way for a career development workshop tonight and tomorrow.

      but only sometimes.  Here's an email and reply I received today about this very blog! (>emailer, *me)  >I've spent about 10 minutes reading your blog.  You sound interesting... that color thing seems like too much like a mlm racket though.  I'm still trying to figure out that 4 letter personality test scheme ( I forget it's name).  I haven't figured out your age yet, or where you're from... but I'm here outside of Winston-Salem.  *Thanks for reading.  mlm?  I'm sorry, I don't know what that stands for.  The 4 letter thing is called Meier-Briggs.  They've dubbed me an ENXP (Equally split between an ENFP and an ENTP).  I wouldn't call it a scheme, though it's not something to live your life by.  I don't LIVE by the color code, it just fits me, that's all.  They are both based on different things, all interesting.  (I took psychology of personalities in college - didn't learn much new info, as its always been a hobby of mine, but the two tests are different schools.)  You'll be able to figure my age if you read one of the first few blogs.  (Don't forget to read its date - I'm a few years older now.)  I'm not really from anywhere right now.  It's just a life stage.  I'm from wherever I've been.  Huh?  Exactly.  You're in NC, or MA?  I may go to... well either one... next.  I don't know.  They are both in the running.    >So would Dwight Yokam be too much like Brooks and Dunn?  What about Beck's latest? or Elvis Costello's more country influenced stuff.  *No.  Your musical taste is approved. :)    >I spent most all of my twenties married, so I never experienced the "Dating" lesson.    *And you are now how old?  Oh, it's too bad you missed that lesson!  It's great.  (I wouldn't really know, as I attend RS, but that was said with the heartiest sarcasm.)  > After my 20s I felt too much like the guys we made fun of during my pre-mission years.  You know the one's who the girls upon seeing would with desperation snatch the closest guy to them at the slight hint of movement in their direction.   *The "Social Mis-fits."  Yes, I know them.  Very well.  >I'm not sure if I agree with your dating for fun, just getting to know her philosophy.  *What?  Dating must begin as fun, or it will never go anywhere with me.  First Fun, THEN Friends, THEN let something develop.  People that want SOMETHING before they even know someone scare me, and are usually too intensely serious that I end up hurting them because they don't appreciate my playful nature.  >I always remember the "chasity"  (sic)  talks we got as priests and the fear of eternal damnation those left us with.  That was so long ago (but not in a galaxy far, far away).   *Chastity.  It's a good way to be.  Too bad it left so many afraid to kiss.  Poor kids don't know what they're missing!  At least the fear of kissing keeps them chaste, though, eh?  >So you do something related to politic's  (sic) , or did i infer too much?   *Not by way of profession, it's just another hobby.  But it could be a profession one day, maybe.  I like to do my part to serve my community.  I have done some, and will continue, certainly.  >Ever been to Pat's Steaks in Philly or Geno's?  Both of them are very good.   *No I haven't, but I'm afraid to trust what people say is very good here.  I'm not really into any of the food I've had on the East Coast.  I'm more of a "California cuisine" kind of girl.  Give me light and healthy and I'm happy.  >going to read more of your musings.   *Enjoy.  Thanks again.  Yellow.

      Having the same, or at least similar musical tastes is a big plus.  I always check out the CD collection.  Here's what I look for:  1) Musical taste comes first, of course.   *If I see Brooks & Dunn or anything likeunto it, just ew.   *If I see a bunch of bands I know and like, good. *If they have bands I like, PLUS a bunch of bands I've never heard of, even better.  I always love discovering new music. 2) If the REAL CD's, not burned ones, are dominant, that is a good thing.  You understand the value of supporting musicians. 3) Are they kept in good condition, or thrown everywhere and scratched?  They don't have to be perfect and alphabetized, just respected. 4) I used to think having several of the same CD's was a good sign, but I have revised that opinion.   *First, because my own collection isn't very good.  I'm poor, and if I allowed myself to purchase all the CD's I'd like, I'd have to use my "flirt for food" method much more frequently.   *Plus, I have a bad knack of somehow owning the worst CD of every good artist.   *Most importantly, were this CD collection eventually to become part joint property, I would much rather have our music collection double, than end up with a bunch of pointless duplicates.

      A phone call from a job interviewer for a cool place in Rural Mass. called to see if I could meet with him in NY tomorrow for my third interview.  I told him I wasn't sure if I could get off work, but I would check.  I was then unsure what to do.  I'm not so sure I want the job, and even if I could get work off, was it worth it taking a day off work and paying for a trip to New York for a job I'm unsure about?  What are the cons to this job?  Basically, rural Massachusetts, and that's it.  It's perfect for my career goals, but imperfect for my life goals.  Can I really tell someone I don't want a great job just because I'd rather be in a city area where I can have a better social life.  Turning down a great job because I'd rather play more doesn't make much sense to most people.  But I'm a Yellow!  That's what it's all about.  AND, if what I REALLY want out of life is to be a mother, than I have to do what it takes find a husband.  And that means play time.  Well, my boss said it's not enough time for me to get off anyway, so that answers that.

      Derek treated me to dinner at Panera, "Putt-putt" mini golf (where I made a fantastic comeback an the second nine, and won with a decided victory), one game of air hockey, one episode of "Malcom in the Middle," plenty episodes of tickles and snuggles, and one real compliment.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  It was  great.  I like how he lets me dump all my complaints in my "don't pity me, I just want to tell somebody" way.  He asks for them ("How was Valley Forge and Dancing"), then listens, then smiles and says some Slovak word that is exactly like when my mother would say "poor baby" - meaning I have no sympathy, so quit your complaining at get over it, but I still think you're a great person.  I wish I could remember how to spell that word.  It sounds like Hoo-Dee-air-Kuh.  I know it stars with a "Ch" in its spelling.

      In my response to Derek's almost daily email, I warned him that Yellow Time is in short supply, as I may be moving soon.  It worked!  He called me to do something today, before I was done at work. Although I have to drive out to his place, he gets to foot the bill. :)  I'm off!

      Plan for the worst, but hope for the best.  I forgot to do that last weekend, and ended up disappointed.  It seems every time I plan on having a fun weekend, it doesn't happen.  No dancing Friday or Saturday - even though I knew of three different chances I had to go, they all fell through.  But, if I expect to spend my weekends home alone writing or sleeping, then I'll be much happier when I do get out.  That is probably what will happen anyway as I have to work 3/4 of my Saturdays left here.

      I talked to Idaho-Blue on the phone today.  I don't think he realizes it, but every time we talk he tells me about yet one more person who doesn't like me.   "Yeah, we were talking about you the other day. They were talking about how much so-and-so doesn't like you, but I stood up for you."  It's more detailed than that, but it's a new person every time.  I don't even ask what people say, it's just what he brings up every conversation.  Do this many people really not like me?  I don't think that's really what's happening.  See, I know the way Idaho-Blue works.  It's a manipulation thing.  He has to prove what a loyal good friend he is when nobody else is so that I'm obligated to keep him as a friend.  (And he wonders why he loses friends!) He knows that it really hurts to be told that people don't like you, and so he exaggerates it.  So far, almost everyone I used to know there has been painted as a bad mean person who doesn't like me at all.  Actually, he's done that about everyone I knew there excepting Idaho-White, and for some reason he keeps asking why we (Idaho-White and I) aren't still trying to stick together.  But I refuse to believe him.  It's just one of his tricks he plays to feel better about himself.  I mean, some of those people are the few who faithfully read my blog.  They can't hate me that much.

      Well, somehow the topic couldn't be avoided (me having an honesty complex and all).  We watched Johnny Lingo (the new MGM version, oh yeah!) and then put in Finding Nemo.  I think he was just trying to get in more yellow time, and I could have gotten some cuddle in, but I - I couldn't bring myself to do it.  When he put Nemo in we began talking about dating, and weren't watching the movie at all, and finally it came out that I like Derek.  NotDoc used to be Derek's home teacher - back during the initial excitingly scary first good times.  Turns out Derek did talk about me, and he was excited.  But that was then...  I told NotDoc how the hope of something happening with Derek is the only reason I have to stay here, and I just don't think that hope is strong enough to make it worth staying.  NotDoc said "well, there's other guys out there." I definetly know that.  He also said "it's his loss" and I said "I know, but I'm probably just prepairing him for when he does meet the right girl."  NotDoc then realized he was tired enough to go home, and left pretty quickly.  I could see he felt rejected.  I was sorry, but I have been totally honest with him the whole time.  On the way out the door,He asked if our conversation was confidential i.e. 'can I talk to Derek about this?'  I told him Derek already knows all this.  Why do we all have to be rejected?  Well - it's just like in Johnny Lingo, the higher the price, the more valuable the prize.  It just matters if we're willing to pay.

      I have no idea if this song *could* even stand on its own.  It all makes sense to me, but I find things that need a lot of explanation usually aren't that great on their own.  In any case, here's the explanation. My roommate AJ may help me write music for it.  The word Derek means "The Way, the Path, the Road" (among other things)  The first line is a slight allusion to the song "Nineteen" by the Old97s. Derek admits he's rotten at relationships.  It's not that he's a bad guy in any way, he just doesn't know HOW to do it, he's rotten at playing the game. *I* gave *him* a flower.  Granted it was plastic and from Michael's, but it was blue for his BYU college, which has always been my least favorite school.  We joke about it often.  "It" in the chorus refers to actually having a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.  We never really did, though we kinda did and I really liked it then.  The possibility of maybe having one is the only real reason I can come up with to stay here instead of taking this job in Oregon, and it's not a very good reason.  The second verse is what I thought of first when listening to the song "Nineteen." They sing that he doesn't know why he let her go, but he was only nineteen, so that's his reason - he didn't know any better, or he wasn't ready, or whatever.  I WAS 19 in 1997, and Derek is now 29.  I don't like the lyric mean, but he is just letting me go, and doesn't have "I'm only 19" as an excuse, and doesn't really have an excuse, and that's mean.  The second chorus refers how Derek and I called so many things, including eachother, scary.  I borrow his music all the time, and love it, and I'll miss that, but - I'll most likely move - and be what Derek has dubbed "An Or-A-Goner."

      I'll never know if we'd go sour, you played rotten from the start. I played blue, a plastic flower, even tried to play my heart.  And it's not my fault we missed it, though I hit it, fun and all. I could play this game forever or be gone to Oregon.  The 97's had a reason, it was 'cause they were nineteen. But I was back in 97 and you're twenty-nine and mean.  And it's not my fault that we missed it, though I hit it, scared and all. I could hear these songs forever, or move on to Oregon.  See, I shouldn't really stay here, you might realize you care. Hey - at least you learned to cuddle- She can pick it up from there.  And it's not my fault we missed it though I hit it, tears and all. I could drive this road forever or go on to Oregon.  And I'm gone to Oregon.

      with Not-Doc Boy.  First movies with him non-theatre-style.  He'll probably want to cuddle.  At this point, why not?  Derek even did what movie cuddling is possible in the theatre.  My head on his shoulder, his head against that.  Arm around me at the end, and a hug goodbye. (It's been a while.)  We were listening to yet another Old 97s album I hadn't heard yet, and he skipped a song saying "that's too poignant right now."  Hmmmm - I'm going to have to figure out what that song was.  I was listening to the CD I'm borrowing now, reading lyrics, and one song spoke to me in a way that made me stay up late and write a song of my own, except I wish I was good enough at guitar to put an actual song to it.  The lyrics are there, though.  I write classical, I've never done otherwise.  This one is in the style of the 97s.  Watch for lyrics, I'm sure I'll post them.

      "Don't know what you got, 'till it's gone...."  Derek's realizing it suddenly.  He took me to see Shrek 2 last night.  (Not-Doc Boy wanted to take me to see it Friday night, but D obviously has priority.)    He even said "I need to get in all the Yellow Time I can!"  My reply, "You'd better." (He's going to his parents *again* this weekend, this time to go to a Who concert, and meet his brothers girlfriend.)  It's not DEFINITE that I'll be moving to Portland yet (I have until the 27th to decide), but I'm going to make him miss me when I'm gone.   :)

      I just got a job offer, from the job I had decided I didn't want.  They want to give me a position that was better than I expected, with hours that don't look as bad as I expected, in Portland.  Portland is one of my favorite cities.  Second to Seattle, but without drastic volcano danger.  Hmmmm-  I was just a bit bummed yesterday, and talked to my sister who really cheered me up.  (Thanks Sas!)  I don't know if I really have any great reason to stay in Philly.  I would really love Portland.  Oh!  Decision time!

      I was right.  I am cute today. At least my roommate complimented me before I left for church this morning.  I talked to two new guys today, and a few that I've spoken with before and never really did anything about.  Nothing worth getting excited about happened, though.  There was a slick without-even-talking exchange in giving Derek his Wilco CD back, while another guy (Peruvian, but not the cute Latino guy I've talked to almost every week, and gotten NOWHERE with) was convincing me to go to dinner at his place that night.  Peruvian has dinner at his place almost every week, and I've turned him down too many times, so today I gave in.  But, as is my unluck with guys, he asked me out on an official date before the dinner and escape was over.  This guy is about 5 ft. tall, and not extremely bright.  I didn't flat out say no, but I did warn him I'd be very busy the rest of my tenure here (which is true).  Why don't cute LDS guys ask me out?  They rarely even talk to me.  What is it?  The non-cute LDS guys I'm not remotely interested in ask me out a lot.  Cute Non-LDS guys ask me out all the time.  What's the deal?  I think I'm competing with too many Barbies.  Really.  That's the real mistake I made with Derek.  He was the first active LDS guy that I liked and that liked me back (or so I thought) so I got really excited and felt like going in full force.  Well, that obviously was a stupid approach, and didn't work.  I don't want to play this game.  I just want a cute LDS guy to pay attention and see how cute I am, and blah blah blah get on with it.

      When we talked Wednesday night, we decided we both played opposite rolls from what we usually do, and neither of us are very good at them.  I'm not good at pursuing, and he's not good at being pursued.  I told him it felt like middle school all over again, where everyone is very awkward, although back then it was awkward bays pursuing me to no avail.  Now I empathize with them a little more.  Derek reaffirmed that he really did like me the whole time, and assured that's he's not indecisive like this in other aspects of his life.  That I already knew.   He's taking me to a Phillies vs. Atlanta Braves game after work today.  It should be fun.

      It's totally official.  Phone calls have been made.  Portland here I come.  The more I learn about Portland the more excited I get.  I've been looking into living situations and areas of town to live in, and which singles ward to attend there.  http://ldslinkup.com is a great tool.  I search for Portland, send a message to people there, and have found some wonderfully helpful people.  :)  Derek called just to work out Saturday plans.  He's going to join the volunteers and mylself doing great manual labor here at "the farm" and then we're gonna hop in the car and head out to the Jersey Shore.  He said it was bittersweet talking to me, and he'd better say goodnight before it became more bitter than sweet.  There I go - breaking another heart.  But this one is entirely not my fault!  I did more than I've ever done to prevent it.  But, no more being persuer.  Now I will stick to being persued.  I'm better at it.

      though he called it a class evaluation.  After class last night, I trickily avoided being taken out by someone else so Derek and I have could have one last go of Yellow time before the official decision.  At first I began to second guess my decision.  Then we sorta recounted everything that happened since the first time we met.  It was a good night, of sorts.  But it went on too long, I'm too tired now, and I didn't get a kiss at all.  I probably could have gotten one before we began talking, but I didn't trick him into it.  Anything other than a final goodbye kiss is going to have to be his doing.  Which means, it most likely won't happen.  I really hope every time we hang out before I leave doesn't feel like goodbye.  It's not really goodbye.  Remember, moving on doesn't have to be letting go.  But it did reconfirm my decision by the end of the night. I AM moving.

      So I was thinking and thinking and thinking, trying to decide what to do.  I called my mother and talked it out with her.  I called my father and talked it out with him.  I guess I think too much like them, because they didn't have anything to tell me that I hadn't already thought about.  Then I talked to one of my roommates, who's about to have her 10 year anniversary with her partner, and has had to do several bouts of longdistancing.  All the ideas of Derek and I working out were there, and  all the realistic thoughts that the worst and best case scenarios whether I stay or go were there, and I wasn't really worried.  She pointed out that me being able to find another job wouldn't be a problem.  I've had plenty of call backs and interviews, and all for very good jobs.  But, I wouldn't get to start looking again until mid-June, and then it may be another six months or who knows how long before I find the next good job.  I may as well take this opportunity in Portland, as I would already have six months of experience under my belt by the time I would even begin another job elsewhere.  If something is going to happen between Derek and I, it still will.  He/we can make the effort to travel to see eachother and although he does have a more permanent type job, he's not locked in to staying here.  Then I felt great.  That's it then!  Nothings stopping me.  I'm going to Oregon.  So then, it was happy times through American Idol time at Grandma's house (that's the name of the house where I live at my work) my home teacher came to teach me for the last time before we both move.  The lesson he had prepared was on making Choices.  Funny that.  The line that stood out to me most was that not making a choice IS a choice.  And thus, Derek had made a choice.  After that I called Derek, to let him know I had decided on Portland.  Suddenly, he realized how really sad the thought of me leaving made him.  I told him all the great reasons to go, and even that things don't have to be over, and he was only thinking how stupid he's been to not recognize what he's had all this time.  "Well," I said "If you think I'm making a big mistake stop me now!"  Portland here I come.  Let the next adventure begin!  Whether it's me or another girl, I think Derek won't let his opportunities pass him by so easily next time.

      Derek called me at lunch.  He has a class to review for his engineering certification exam after work today, so he wanted to make sure and get in touch with me.  Of course his answer was "I do like you, and if you go I'll buy your children's book when it comes out, and show Yellow Appreciation from time to time.  I don't know if that's a good enough answer for you, but with the deadline and all, that's what I've come up with."  "And what if I stay?" says I.  "Well, I might still buy your book, and there would still be Yellow Time." laugh.   "Would anything change?"  Silence. Thinking. "I guess I would step it up a notch, but I don't think I'm prepared for anything big."  What is it with these Mormon boys and thinking just having a girlfriend is such a big deal?!  It's only dating, with the benefit of not having to figure out who to call when you need a date.  As usual.  Clear as cellophane.

      Derek came over last night.  He had fair warning of what was ahead (I just told him we needed to talk in person) and the fear was evident in his face when he arrived.  I could have just not mentioned it at all and sprung things on him, but I don't think that would have been fair.  So we spent time on the new Ikea comfy futon outside under the pavilion, and compared notes on a class we both took, with a little study.  Then we finally got around to the scary stuff.  What's scary about it is that there is a timeline.  I have to accept or refuse this Portland thing by Thursday, so he really does have to choose.  He kept "trying to find loopholes" as he put it - just speaking in hypotheticals and saying pros and cons for me.  All the things I already know.  It was a long night.  I wouldn't say we got nowhere... but there was no definite conclusion.  We had a good talk, and I got some good compliments.  He's great at compliments.   At the heart of the problem:   He's an engineer.   He thinks there's some sort of formula for how a relationship works.  Since nobody has taught him that formula he's afraid to even begin.   I'm an artist.   I see all these little tools and colors and possibilities, and love the adventure of seeing what can be created from combinations.  I told him I'd be willing to be his training wheels.  I don't even know him well enough to even think about what's going to happen eventually.  But how can you enjoy one day at a time if you worry so much about what the outcome is supposed to be?   I really don't know if I'll have to use a bike to get around, or ride it just for fun, or become a hardcore cyclist... and therefore I am worried about learning how to ride a bike.   Could I give up Portland to be training wheels?  Yes.  But not if they just stay stored in the garage.  I wrote up a cover letter, and gave my resume to the Director of Development at my current job, applying to be her assistant.  She said they wouldn't be hiring until into the summer.  I mean, it would have been too easy to help my decision along if she'd have said, "sure, I'll hire you."  But she did say she would put me a the top of the list to know when she is beginning to look.  That brings me back to my decision.  It's still not definite either way what I'll decide if Derek says stay or go.  Another song reference, hurray!  The V. Femmes show up all over the place.

      Yesterday, I fasted and prayed about pondered and meditated and wrote out all the pros and cons of staying here or accepting this job in Portland.  At church the Sacrament Meeting (our main meeting, but with different speakers -chosen from the congregation- each week) talks were all about making decisions, and how to clearly know answers.  This is what I decided: Before I decide if I can accept this Portland job, I have to know Derek's real decision regarding us.  If he wants me to stay, and if I stay - if he would be a real boyfriend rather than a pseudo boyfriend, then I will refuse this Portland job and work hard to find a job here.  If he is still too afraid, or has decided I'm not the one, I will move.  He's such a chicken, that I see the second choice as more likely, but we shall see.  If he chooses not me, I will not be heartbroken and will easily just move on.  He called me to pass the time on his 2hr drive home from his parents' house last night.  I talked him into coming over today so we can talk, etc.  Yesterday, one of the scriptures we discussed regarding decision making seemed especially applicable.  It reads perfectly with only a few word changes for the whole chapter if Derek does not come back around to really liking me.  (I know Derek *is* looking for his future wife, and that he *did* like me when we "commenced.") I will give a short excerpt: D&C ch. 9 v7 - Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. v9 - But, behold, I say unto you that you must study it out in your mind; and then you must ask me if it is right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. v9 - But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot date that which is sacred save it be given you from me. v10 - Now, if you had known this you could have dated; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should date now.  *v11*  - Behold, it was expedient when you commenced;  but you feared , and the time is past, and it is not expedient now; v12 - for, do you not behold that I have given unto my daughter Yellow sufficient strength, whereby she is made up?  And neither of you have I condemned.

      Expect a slight lull in my postings - I'm running a festival this weekend, so I'm very busy.  Also, Derek is headed to the Pittsburgh area to camp and see a free Wilco show for the weekend.  I'll then have one week of cleanup, one weekend with Derek, one week visiting the Eastern US part of my family, and a little more than a week of traveling across the country.  I went to ldslinkup.com to find some people in Portland to help me out before I get there - apartment hunting and the like.  One male in particular has been very helpful, and fun to talk to.  I have a new Portland friend already!

      Scene: Derek and Survival Boy discussing me moving across the country.  Derek: Well, it was a good learning experience.  Survival Boy: All this time and energy and feelings, and you're just gonna let be a learning experience.  Well, that might make a difference.  Actually, it already has.

      First it was the Phillies vs. Braves Friday night.  A good time was had by all, but nothing huge to report.  Saturday, Derek and Survival Boy came to help as volunteers at my work.  The weather was perfect, and the work was good.  We finished several hours earlier than scheduled - then the three of us hopped in the car and headed for the Jersey Shore, Wildwood to be exact.  Wildwood is a cheap carnival style boardwalk town with tacky stores, games, and people - but we went on a GREAT roller coaster - and the beach is big enough not to be crowded.  Also, I got dumped in the ocean, and that was fun.  The water wasn't too cold - but I didn't have a swim suit or a change of clothes, so I was cold on the way home.  Sunday, Derek was brave enough to sit by me in Sunday School AND in the combined RS/Priesthood meeting. He even invited me over for dinner after.  Dinner was good, and the talking was good, and spirits were good, and he finally had the guts to kiss me goodbye.  I'm so proud of him!  I think his drive home & talk with Survival Boy Saturday after Wildwood helped him much.  Monday was Memorial Day, and my last day off before life turns into 100% work for a few weeks.  We went with the singles ward to Rickett's Glenn... a very very beautiful hike with at least 25 waterfalls.  It rained the most of the time, but that didn't even matter.  It was beautiful and soooo worth it.  After we got home, Derek wanted a final bit of Yellow time - as it's  getting close to the end of our time.  We went to Blockbuster and rented Master and Commander.  There was much too much gore for me to watch - so we stopped watching it after just a little way into it.  We then tried watching an episode of Malcom in the Middle - and we had to stop that one for his sake.  One of the boys was doing embarrassingly stupid things to try to impress a girl, and Derek said it was just painful to see, and not funny.  So we skipped to another episode - and that was that.  It was so much it feels like one big long day of fun - and now I must go back to work.

      There was some movie where they talked about the "art" of making a mix tape.  I made Derek two CD's as goodbye gifts.  One is called "Training Wheels - illustrations of an era" and the other is called "Tricycle Music - no training wheels required."  The first is full of songs I find applicable.  The playlist:  1) Slung-lo -Erin McKeown 2) Love is Just Around the Corner -Peggy Lee 3) Call My Name -Peter Breinholt & Big Parade 4) Nice Work if you Can Get It -Ella Fitzgerald 5) Enjoy Yourself -Lee Press-On and the Nails 6) When It Comes To Love -Big Bad Voodoo Daddy 7) Bernaise -Rebecca K Downs 8) Just Kiss Me -Harry Connick, Jr. 9) Ring of Fire -Swim Herschel  10) I Don't Understand You -They Might Be Giants 11) I'd Rather -The Lascivious Biddies 12) I'm Beginning To See The Light -Bobby Darin 13) OK -Ani DiFranco 14) Should I Stay or Should I Go -The Clash 15) Perhaps -Cake 16) Undecided -Ella Fitzgerald 17) I'm Leaving On a Jet Plane -Bjork 18) Better After All -Jonatha Brooke 19) Heartbreak Even -Ani DiFranco 20) Be My Yoko Ono -Barenaked Ladies 21) In A Big Country -Big Country 22) Nellie the Elephant -Toy Dolls 23) Gone Daddy Gone -Violent Femmes 24) Cinematic -Erin McKeown 25) Heaven -Los Lonely Boys  The second is just fun songs he would enjoy that I know he doesn't already own:  1 - Ponderous - Two NU 2 - Bohemian - Swim Herschel Swim 3 - Montero - Swim Herschel Swim 4 - Fuz - Swim Herschel Swim 5 - Snail Shell - They Might Be Giants 6 - Sleeping In The Flowers - They Might Be Giants 7 - Rocket To The Moon - They Might Be Giants 8 - Bed Bed Bed - They Might Be Giants		 9 - John Lee Supertaster - They Might Be Giants		 10 - Where Do They Make Balloons? - They Might Be Giants	 11 - If I Had $100000 - Barenaked Ladies 12 - One Week - Barenaked Ladies 13 - Songs About the Great Divide - Peter Breinholt & Big Parade 14 - What About - Peter Breinholt & Big Parade 15 - You Wear Flowers - Peter Breinholt & Big Parade 16 - Happy Birthday Song (Funniest Version Ever!) 17 - Temptation - Fun 40s Songs	 18 - Abbadabbadabba 19 - Cocktails For Two - Spike Jones & City Slickers 20 - Doin' What Comes Natur'lly - Dinah Shore 21- I Never See Maggie Alone - Kenny Roberts 22 - Deep in the Heart of Texas - Alino Rey & Orchestra 23 - Personality - Frank Sinatra 24 - It's Unanimous - Alex Pangman  The mixes themselves could be much better, but I did a FANTASTIC job creating the cases.  I'm off now for my last sure day of Derek time, sights of Philadelphia here I come!

      I went over to Derek's and kept him up late tonight.  I still can't sleep.  We watched the Chek version of Cinderella.  It was fun. The more I think about it, the more I have no problem moving on.  Just more good training wheels for Derek.  I made him a mixed CD called "Training Wheels" with applicable songs.  Well, the minivan to Portland is set, which means I'm leaving in about 10 days, which means I have to take off so I have some family time before I leave the East coast.  That's much more important than some more Derek time.  I haven't even seen either of my nieces yet.  I've already been asked out on a date by a Portland guy!  I get better at getting dates and making friends quicker each time I move.  This is fun.

      While watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (definitely the best one yet!) Derek mentioned how many movies we've seen together, and how he'll miss it. He thought I was going to Potter with co-workers and thought "Who will  I  see Harry Potter with?"  I've been kinda Ho-hum about whether I'll try another long distance thing or move on - and when I'm not with him I don't really feel strongly one way or the other.  But I had fun swimming and movie watching yesterday, and was noticing all the little details that I really like about him.  I'll definitely miss those aspects if anything.  I love the punny way we play off each other.

      I'm not completely offline yet.  One more week of heavy manual labor, busy busy busy, festival cleanup.  The fest. was the kind of chaos that I  love !  I was/am crazy busy, but there's a thrill of energy running through my blood.  I hardly even got to hear any music all day of the festival, but I couldn't get the smile off my face (even in the rain) or the dancing out of my bones.  I'm sore everywhere.  Life is grand!

      I would highly recommend the constitution center.  By the time we were done I did something I never would have otherwise done.  It's really just not like me... but I decided that while I was in Philadelphia I may as well get the full Philly experience -  I ate a Cheesesteak.  Ok, so I really only ate almost half of one, but I did it. If you don't know, a cheesesteak is a big sub-type sandwich full of meat.  Basically -ew- but it is the food of Philadelphia, so I finally gave in.  Derek made me a really cool card.  It was a comic strip style spider man presenting me with the Miss Amberica 2004 award.  It was a fun goodbye.

      I must make this short - I have packing and cleaning and driving to NC to do today - not to mention I should get more sleep.  For the last round of Yellow Time, we went to the Liberty Bell and the Constitution Center yesterday.  Quality.  It was a sweet goodbye.  I don't think I've ever  actually  felt sad about a goodbye before.  I will miss Derek.

      What happens when you combine a Mormon woman, a Jewish male (in a committed relationship), and a gay Buddhist male? Add in to the equation that they are all Yellow personalities (I predict - they'll be taking the test today), have great musical taste, and are spending all day inside "Marina, the Midwife of Frankenstein" (a blue minivan). A Grrreat trip - so far.

      Oh, and I forgot to mention that I'm excited to meet the Portland Blue I've been emailing.  Yes, there is a date lined up, but no pressure.  It takes me less and less time each place I move to nab a date, or at least make friends.  That's a good thing about moving.  I have to practice making friends.  It's a skill I've always felt weak in, though those who see me as an outside observer wouldn't think so.

      I spent the weekend seeing old boys, that were always just friends.  Never "my" boys.  Yesterday, I visited an old friend from when I lived in North Carolina.  I was nice and fun, except the timing was bad.  There was also another girl in from out of town visiting... and he wasn't able to find me a date in time, so it was the three of us playing games.  It didn't feel awkward to me, but I'm sure things would have been slightly different had it been one on one.  He's one of those guys other people automatically think are cute, but for some reason isn't exactly my type physically.  It's not that I think he's bad looking - maybe it's just that he's blonde.  I don't know.  I'm more easily attracted to dark haired boys.  Also, today I saw someone I had forgotten about from when I did live here.  He was the fun date everyone kind of guy when I lived here.  I never did go on a date with him, but I met him during a group date.  I became pretty good friends with a girl who had fallen for him and felt crushed by him.  Well, he's married now.  Right in speedy LDS fashion.  His wife is a babe, and he's still very a friendly.

      They aren't Yellows at all, they just appeared that way after the first driving day because they were so much fun.  After they took the test, it actually made sense that the Jewish boy was a White, with heavy secondary blue, and Buddhist was a Blue.  Our beautiful Blue (yes, light blue) Marina died in Livingston, Montana.  So we rented Bob, the white Impala to finish the journey.  After Marina, he was AMAZING.  But then a change of plans did more than just drop me of in Idaho - I then hopped right back in the car and headed south with my parents toward California for my Grandaddy's funeral. We stayed the first night in my ol' hometown of Sandy, Utah - where I actually was amazing enough to pull off a get together of four of my favorite Sandy, Utah people, plus one of my favorite spouses of old friends. The first two showed up, and we had a great talk.  I excitedly realized we are all doing exactly what we had hoped to do when we "grew up" or at least within the "5 year plan."  One is saving the world through his band, one through her motherhood (3rd is on the way) and me though my job - in the Northwest no less.  Then today, as we stopped for lunch in St. George to see my sister, we changed plans again, and I got to stay and see my sister for a few days! It's Sas and I making trouble in the south.  WAHOOO!!!  The trip is still great!  P.S. Grandaddy's passing is one of those, good he's out of pain now kind. And I will see all those family members next week, so this is not a drop responsibility to play kind of thing.  This is maximizing family time.

      Love has been on my mind.  As a question . Not what if- but what  IS  LOVE.  I remember how I first loved. the boy of games and beauty quiet, patient, persistence commitment. I still do-  I'm sorry for you Love.  I wonder how I could have loved the boy with timing. loud, temper, fleeting unreal.  A lesson learned .  I'm sorry for you Love.  In awe I see one Loved. the boy of soul and truth everything as at first and more. And questioning  my deepest desires , I revere,  and wish you well, Love.  I linger on a missed Love. the boy of fear and tears laughter, music,  hope - lost hope- A lesson taught.  I wanted to  BE  Loved.   Love has been on my mind. Not what if, but  what is .

      I don't know what I did expect, but not this.  I don't know, I guess I thought I was totally over Idaho White or something.  But seeing him... everything suddenly feels just like it did when I was here, well kind of.  There is this awkward unnatural feeling of not snuggling with him or holding his hand or whatever.  I'm pretty sure he's seeing someone right now anyway... I haven't gotten further details from that since they first got together.  Everything is the same as it was, minus everything physical.  At the same time, nothing I felt when I was away from him has changed either.  I still know that we're taking different paths in lives and that it wouldn't work out between us.  But I REALLY enjoy being with him.  This reminds me of the poem I wrote the other day - (I'm writing from Idaho Whites computer right now... I wonder if I can sneak off safely... here goes risk!) -

      Relationships are a matter of faith in action which leads to knowledge. A loving healthy relationship is always the desired result. But it requires acts of faith  each step of the way . Faith that if you talk to the person, they'll talk back. Faith that your compatible interests could lead to a positive partnership. Faith that if you give this person love, it will be well received. Faith that this person will deal with you honestly. It takes CONSTANT faith to maintain a good relationship.   But is the faith IN the relationship the most important thing? No! It is the tool to achieve the result.  My would-have-been relationship with Derek didn't happen because of his fear in trusting his faith when he didn't have full knowledge. He knew he liked me, and that I liked him, and that everything was great - but he was unwilling to invest when he was unsure what the future would be. He wouldn't ask me to stay because he didn't want to feel responsible if somewhere down the line things didn't work out, and he had asked me to stay. THIS is lack of faith which led directly to lack of knowledge. Knowledge in this case must follow faith. And, relationships require the faithful ACTION of BOTH parties to exist.

      I had Dad give me a Father's Blessing last Sunday.  Our entire family used to get them at the beginning of each school year.  Now there is no school year for me, and I hardly see Dad.  But, as I'm here visiting parents now, and will be starting a new job in a new city - I figured it was a great time.  Balanced between the words in the blessing he gave me about finding a mate who will see the beauty in me (Did I ever post that poem on here?), the last blessing I received before I began my job hunt which said what I'll be doing (for my new job) will be secondary to where I will be, and my overall feeling of complete calm - seriously no worries (just wonders) - I think I'm getting ever closer to finding a good companion.  I've moved a lot lately.  Every move has felt great and exciting and right.  But this time, for the first time, I feel like I'm headed home.

      Yes - but not in that longing my heart is going to dissolve without him way.   I think I'm too independent to get that feeling.  In this area, I think I inherited my mother's way of dealing.  My dad turns to mush.  Porridge.  Yogurt.  I really miss Derek's sense of humor.  Not that it's so much above anyone else's, but because it was so exactly like mine.  Others have had very compatible humor styles - but Derek has MY style.  I also miss his complimenting style, which he grew in and adapted from my style of giving and accepting compliments.  He was a perfect equal match when it came to playing games as well.  Neither of us sore winners or losers, but we will be totally competitive and try to win.  Every game we played seemed to be a neck and neck equal match.

      And I'll turn from an Oregoner to an Oregonian.  I went out to dinner with my Grandma (Gramm) this evening.  I don't remember ever hanging out with her one on one.  It was nice.  We both enjoyed it so much we were in tears.  I love my Gramma.  I also love that I will soon be in Portland.

      So my cousin decides she needs to set me up.  "Oh, there's this online singles thing - you can look up my friend." I do LDS link up, a networking thing, but a dating (meat market) service is a little beyond what I'm interested in right now.  Anyway, you have to sign up to browse, so I do under her pressure.  We find the guy.  45yrs. old is above my dating range - and no, dear cousin, he really isn't cute AT ALL.  Can I tell her this?  No.  So I just stare at her blankly and shrug.  BUT!  As part of your profile, you take the color code personality test!  It's the real one too!  And yes, even according to it, I'm still *very* yellow.  I'm more Red then I thought I was, though. The service is http://www.ldsmingle.com If you're curious about the color code, here's the only place I've found it free online.

      (song lyrics)  (I thought I already posted this one, but I can't find it anywhere...)   It's an in between life leaving love each place I go. Sometimes I'd like to keep it, but some feelings grow too slow.  I'm living in the middle when some broken heart becomes a new love down the line I don't remember missing... those broken hearts aren't mine.  (chorus) I live in between with a love before still mine, living in between hopeful new love on my mind.  I wish I weren't coldhearted. I feel deeper than you know. Sometimes I'd like to keep it, but some feelings grow too slow.  (chorus) I live in between with a love before still mine, living in between hopeful new love on my mind.

      (song lyrics)  It's my first "Goodbye, I'll miss you." It's my first "I want to stay." It's your first "I hope to see you again," For our final time today.  (chorus) But we never said "Love" for the first time and we never said "Love" at the end. Yeah we never said "Love" couldn't figure it out, but we said "Goodbye" today.  It's the last kiss awkward feeling. It's the last game we can play. It's the last time we're together alone. It's our final chance to say -   (chorus) But we never said "Love" for the first time and we never said "Love" at the end. Yeah we never said "Love" couldn't figure it out, but we said "Goodbye" today.  (bridge) Yeah we never said  Love  never  Said  love  Never  said love, never said. Yeah we never said  Love  never  Said  love  Never  said love, never said.  But I can feel it in my stomach, feel it reeling in my mind I can see it taste it touch it hear it shivers up my spine  But we never said "Love" for the first time and we never said "Love" at the end. Yeah we never said "Love" couldn't figure it out, figure it out couldn't figure  thinkin' 'bout it TOO MUCH , Love Couldn't figure it out  And we said goodbye today.

Today  Today I woke up Beautiful,  and no one near to see. Today I woke up charming,  with none to see by me. They don't know what they're missing, The things they'd get to see. Today I woke up beautiful  and beautiful I'll be.

      It's fun to be introduced like: "Here's Yellow, the single one." That was sarcastic.  Hanging out with lots and lots of family is GReeeeat.  For doses no larger than 48 hours, complete with the ability to sleep.  Actually, I am enjoying myself, but I'm wanting a small family of my own.  The Single One.

      Derek called me.  Chudak is sick.  :(  He still hasn't sent me the pictures from my Phinal days of Philly.  Man he's a good guy.  I hope he figures it out - girl-wise.  Seeing Idaho White was great, and I do still love him, but I'm still totally fine not being with him.  It's back to priorities again.  We did both say that there wasn't any reason there's not a possibility that we could get together again in the future.  He has been learning good things about himself through the girl he's been seeing lately.  It's weird, but I am so happy about him dating other people.  He needs to experience more people.  He still gets so caught up in the idea that everyone is going to react to things the way his first girlfriend did.  It's so good for him to learn to deal with different people.  Idaho Blue was so happy to see me.  He called me last night.  Good for him.  I still care for him and all, but I'm getting impatient.  He still hasn't grown up and I don't think he ever will.  I feel like a Pirate saying that (Peter-Pan esque) but some people!  If he would just finish school, get a job, and get out of dodge - but he's still a good guy, and a good friend.

      No contact yet.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; But that's ok, because I got a call from the Relief Society Pres. inviting me to go dancing tomorrow night.&nbsp;   You mean I might actually make friends with a girl before befriend a guy?&nbsp; Wait, I kinda started doing that Sunday.     I miss being able to be an honorary guy.&nbsp; (You know, where the guys don't act different because there's a girl around - but you're still a girl, just not one to worry about.)&nbsp; I really like guys as friends.   I'd really like a guy that likes me in other ways too, though.&nbsp;  Pltttt.    But dancing tomorrow is gonna be  fun .&nbsp; It's not even swing or salsa, which I haven't done for ages, and I'm excited!   Yes. I love Portland.

      I don't know where to begin - or how to explain how I feel.  Why am I shy at church social function-type things?&nbsp; I have no problem speaking up in classes (but not so much I monopolize).&nbsp; I have no problem being outgoing and wild and crazy if appropriate in certain elements (i.e. swing dancing/game playing, etc.).&nbsp; I have no problem having meaningful conversations with people.&nbsp; And outside of church settings - I'm often good at small talk.  &nbsp;  But those in between class times, and after church/fireside times . . . it's not that I'm shy - I just have absolutely no idea how to approach people or what to say.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; I guess I AM shy.&nbsp; So it linger quietly on my own, on a chair or something - until I can go home.  &nbsp;  I think I mentioned how in Philly Derek realized I could be shy and was surprised (he had met me snowtubing - time for outgoing behavior) while Not-Doc Boy realized I can be silly and was surprised&nbsp;(he had only seen me at church).  &nbsp;  Maybe it's because I take&nbsp;spiritual things&nbsp;seriously and just can't look at it as a meet market.  &nbsp;  ***  I missed my Philly ward again today, but oh well.&nbsp; I am once again in a younger ward - have not met a male over 23... but it's just one day so far.&nbsp;None of the talks were insightful, so I really had to depend on the spirit to teach me.&nbsp; This will be good exercise in humility, which I once again have been focusing on developing.  ***  The date I had lined up before I got here hasn't happen yet.&nbsp; The guy had a conference this weekend, so he was unavailable.&nbsp; He said he would give me a call this week, however.&nbsp; Wish me luck.&nbsp; I'll need it.

      No Spiderman last night.  My co-worker I was going with had a friend call and invite him to go to the coast.  He's lived here a year, and goes back to New York next week, and has never been to the coast.  I said, GO!!!  I thought about going to a concert last night.  I went on a walk instead and decided to save my money.  I have to buy food all week in Boston.  I gotta go now!

      A canvasser tried to kiss me tonight, but he didn't get to.  On purpose.  Too bad for him.  :)   I'm being selective these days.     No, there was no date or anything.  It was during the post-work social time.       I got to go out canvassing at work today - educating people about what's happening at the Hanford Nuclear site. This is not something I'll be doing. It's just a for-fun cross training thing. But there were lots of cute guys there. On guy who is an English teacher and was just doing this for the summer was great conversation. But the boy who tried to kiss me. Uh - no. Besides. I'm doing this whole working hard to date LDS boys thing.

      So today I was in downtown Portland at a Press conference for work. Walking back to the office I saw a guy that looked just like the guy who had written me saying "I'll have to take you out when you get here." He was walking hand in hand with a gorgeous girl.   This is the story as I imagine it:   It's just like that Utah ask to the dance thing, where you ask/get asked a month to early, and then during that month meet someone you totally like, and by the time the dance comes around you're just not interested.     See, he totally dropped contact the minute I got here. He probably remembers that he had mentioned taking me out, and is now so embarrassed about it that he's just avoiding talking to me.     It's too bad.  It would have been good to have an LDS friend.

      And then one day I suddenly became the writer of love poems -  which I had always thought  were silly  and usually pretty stupid  always at least sappy.    And when the muses spoke  it was always about    love.    and I thought -  am I that     desperate?      I don't   feel   Lonely,   except for when I want company,   but not the kind of company  I always seem to find.    But then they were all  Love Poems -  which I  guess  is  ok.

Except you won't because                                    you're perfect     way is planned because                                    you're perfect     path includes no one      but you                  and your     perfection.

      If I could make my left hand work  then I would write a song,  and sing it in the hippest clubs  about how you were wrong.  I'd sing it in my pretty voice  and kids would think I'm hot -  it's only 'cause my hand won't work  my songs just sit and rot.    I'd make 'em sound real funky  in a cute rock sweety voice  an' I'd dress 'em up real punky  and my lyrics would be choice.  I wanna sing my songs about you  and I wanna see your face  when I'm singin' that "I love you"  lookin' straight out at your place.    I used to play piano  but it's just not the same thing.  I wanna strum some guitar chords  for songs I wanna sing.  I could sing 'em A'Cappella  but you see, I'm far too shy.  So they'll stay here in my little book,  and I'll never even try.    See, my stupid left hand's broken  it can't hold a single chord  and I'll never sing on stage now  and I'll never be adored.  So I'll just write all the lyrics  and you'll think that it's a poem  and you'll think I'm kinda silly  so instead I'll just stay home.

      Once in a While  it's nice to get to  NOT   sell yourself for naught   when someone  asks you to.  ( A recognition  of Self Worth  which is   AT LEAST  to sell oneself for  LOVE  that is sincere    not just that is selfish .) -  With a silent smirk  of selfish pride  that someone  would ask.

      So I've been praying lately to gain a testimony regarding morality  (in the physical context) .  I  logically  understand all the arguments for it, and live by it, but I've never truly been sold on it on certain levels.   This could be a dangerous confession as most people who read this actually know who I am.  But anyway -    So I had a victory tonight, but this is on the same level I've always been sold on. So it's really not a victory or learning experience at all, but anyway, it  was  interesting.     So I spent the day hiking Mt. Hood  (Ahhhhhh! I love it here)  and although it is a Saturday night, I felt tired and decided not to go out. So I'm messing around on the computer, and a guy begins chatting with me (I should clarify - I don't chat just anywhere, this was LDS chat stuff). Turns out he's in Portland. He invites me to come over to "hang out." So I talk some more, and I discover his motivations. I tell him, nope. No interest at all.     It's good to get that unexpected check-in and know I have a good sense of self worth.

      Boston is a neat town.  I love the old architecture here.  We had free time last night, so I wandered around Harvard square with two of the other  directors here for training.  One director (and by far the best looking male one) swing dances.  We wanted to go last night, but there wasn't anywhere in town we could go on a Tuesday.  We're planning on going after dinner tonight.  A great bonus for him is doesn't smoke or drink AT All.  That makes me happy.  I'm not alone.  I think there are a few other non-drinking directors, so it's a good solid core.  I like the Harvard bookstore.  I was about to buy the 9/11 commission report and Howard Gardener's new boos "Changing Minds," but I know I don't have money... and when we were about to leave I told the good-looking-swing-dancing-director I was trying to talk myself out of buying them.  He said, "Here, let me help you," took them out of my hands, and put them back on the shelf.    I like this place.

      I went for a walk just to take a walk, and decided to take one of my left-over disposable cameras that has a few pictures left. As I was taking a picture of this fantastic road sign that has arrows pointing to everything  (the ocean, Portland Maine, different attractions in town, just everything)  and how far away they are, I noticed a boy hanging up his cell phone and walking toward me. I thought nothing of it, and continued on with my walk.  Later, as I was coming around another block, this boy was again headed toward me. I smiled to acknowledge him as we were about to pass when he stopped and said, "Hi. I was going to talk to you when I saw you last time, but I was chicken. Would you like to go grab a quick tea or something?"  This is not the first time this has happened here in Portland.  Is this a city thing, or am I hot?  Why can't LDS boys be so easily casual?  Why can't all of us be so easily willing to meet other people?

       &gt;Subject: Howdy  &gt;Date: Sat, 7 Aug 2004 05:40:29 -0000  &gt;  &gt;Hey, just wanted to say hi and see what you have been up to lately.  &gt;Anything interesting on your mind?  &gt;  &gt;[Name was here - he's an Air Force Pilot, a friend from North Carolina]  Hi [Air Force Pilot]!  I'm loving Portland, and just finished up a week of training in Boston, MA.  Actually, I woke up this morning thinking about my job, my family, and how I will vote in the upcoming presidential election.  These are all related in the way I was thinking about them.  At my job, I have the opportunity to give announcements almost daily.  I realized I can use these times to practice public speaking.  I can definitely speak about political issues etc. at these times, but must remain concise and purposeful.  Perfect thing to practice.  Also, I had a long discussion with one of my brothers regarding why he likes President Bush.  I thought his reasoning was very weak, especially for his amazing arguing skill (this man wins any argument he wants to - and you walk away Loving him!).  So I thought about beginning and essay for his and my sake about why I will not vote for President Bush.  (Surprised?  I didn't think so.)  I'd love for him to be able to give stronger arguments regarding my severe dislike for his policies.  I'll get that to you - but it may take a while, as it just became a zygote in my mind this morning.  I have an idea of using the theme "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness" for a basic structure.  Speaking of zygotes, I was also thinking of an anti-abortion argument my brother made.  He said that even without knowing if a spirit has entered a developing life while still in the whom, the process of life has naturally begun, and committing an unnatural act to stop it is wrong.  But if this is the argument, the same must also be true for the natural process of death.  If I had cancer, the process of death has begun in me, and it takes a very unnatural act (surgery, chemo, etc.) to stop it.  Does that make stopping death wrong?  I don't think so.  I am not pro-abortion, though I do/would support stem cell research - I am, however, undecided as to whether or not to be pro-choice.  Should a woman be allowed to make her own choice given her own unique circumstances - perhaps bringing a child into the world where it won't be given the proper care it needs to preserve family - or should that be dictated by law?  By the spin of my stating the subject, you can see where I lean.  Yet, at the same time, there is a very real possibility that I cannot bear children of my own.  And this makes me take this issue deeply seriously.  Adoption is certainly the best option for an unwanted pregnancy... yet there are countless unwanted children born in other countries where women don't abort the child - and they are in desperate need of someone willing to adopt them.  I have a friend who worked in a Chinese orphanage - and it makes me heartsick.  I've also been pondering what I should do when people I'm just meeting find fun in making fun of those around them.  I want nothing to do with conversations like that - but is it more loving to say something, quite possibly isolating myself from possible friendship - or to stay quiet?  And, I must love everyone - so I need to give these people a fair chance to show me their positive qualities.  So, I've been pondering what love is on this level.  I'm also trying to figure out how I'm going to keep myself in line and balanced when it comes to dating.  I've barely had a chance to even talk to LDS boys here, and I'm getting asked out close to daily by non-members.  (I have a very social-oriented job.)  How do I balance my goals and desires with my circumstances?  So no, not much has been going on - in life or my mind.  :)  How have you been?  Are you in need of correspondence?  I can definitely write more often if you'd like.  How long is your war stay this time?

      You know how when you kiss someone for the first time, you're so excited you want to run home and tell your best friend - or your female roomies who will join you in squealing with excitement? Ok, maybe YOU don't experience that, but I do.  So, one of the reasons I started this blog was so I could tell someone (and honestly too) when I had no one to tell.  But then I started letting family know about this blog, mostly so I wouldn't get the "So, any dates?" question all the time.  But then, I have to weigh things. Do I run to here to write about a kiss when I know who reads this? How brave and honest am I? Well honest, I think I'm good at that one. Most people know about my honesty complex.  This is why last week received so little comment, but did get the smiley.  Hmmmmm.
