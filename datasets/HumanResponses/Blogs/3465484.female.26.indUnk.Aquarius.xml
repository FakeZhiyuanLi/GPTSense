      My dad did something yesterday that made us all cry.   Last May 11, around 2AM my mom woke us up because my dad had chest pains and he couldn't see anything. My sister took his blood pressure, it was just slightly higher than normal but his pulse rate was really fast.  I am bound for an out-of-town training that day until Friday so my mom told me to go back to bed and that my dad will be alright soon as he gets back to sleep. I went to Tagaytay knowing that my dad was fine. When I got back Friday night, I am eager to pack for my barkada's outing the following day.  My sister broke the news to me that my dad had a pretty serious stoke last Tuesday.  He lost his already poor eye sight and worse, he couldn't remember basic details like the parts of our house or the names of his friends. He asks the same questions every five minutes and he doesn't want to take a bath. He is worse than Drew in the movie 50 First Dates. The situation is hard for us to accept.  We need to sleep in their room to help my mom answer all of my dad's questions and to lead him to the toilet in the middle of the night.  We can't leave him alone.  We need to give up our social lives for him, my sister can't go to her clinic anymore, we can't spend too much because we might need the money for my dad.    Sometimes we ran out of patience answering my dad's endless questions.  A priest told us that how can we expect my dad to accept his situation while we can't accept our own.  We need to treat my dad like a helpless child. As Badong said, it's payback time.  It's our turn to take care of them.  Our turn to be parents to our parents.  Yesterday, my sister finished her 2-day retreat.  We wrote letters for her.  My ate told my dad to try and write something.  With my sister's assitance my dad tried to write, his penmanship barely readable. My ate said  "dad, write a letter to Ophie" .  My dad asked  "bakit nasan ba s'ya?" .   "e di tanong mo sa sulat mo" , replied my sister.  My daddy wrote:    Opie,  Nasaan ka ba?  Uminom na ako ng gamot at naligo na ako ngayon.  Love, Daddy   That's all he has written. All we ever need.

      Yesterday I got the bag from Carmie (a fellow baddict).  She's selling her new K-Swiss badminton bag for only 500 pesos so naturally, several baddicts wanted to grab it.  Badong wants it, so does Mae, they both need it and I don't. But why did it ended up with me?  Badong said I'm the priority because "medyo malungkot ako". Charming! Pero kung palungkutan, talo ako kay Mae. Too bad that she's so lonely, she can't tell her story. So I won!

      A couple of months ago, I came across an online forum called Baddicts ( urlLink  www.baddicts.com  ). I have read the posts and got hooked. I spent the whole afternoon just reading and laughing. I told my friends about it and they signed up even before I did. I did not sign up immediately because I don't really like chatting and EBs.  Now we are all addicted to this forum. We love it as much as we love badminton. The people here are warm, generous, smart, and very funny. Every EB is something to look forward to. Five hours of playing, dinner, and a wacky company -- it's a sure blast.  Thank you to all the people of Baddicts, you are one of God's sweetest blessings.

      "Define Platonic" tanong sa akin ni Wilbert, "There's no such thing" sabi nya. Platonic - yung nagpapanggap ka na wala lang kahit meron pero carry mo. Yan ang sagot ko sa kanya.    Actually maraming ibig sabihin yung Platonic relationship depende sa gumagamit. Platonic - kapag kahit anong close nyo ay hanggang doon na lang yon either by choice o talagang ganun.  Platonic kung mahal mo pero ni katiting na pagnanasa wala kang maramdaman, in other words - barkada material. Platonic din ang excuse kung isa lang ang may gusto, unrequitted love ika nga. Platonic din kung pareho kayong manhid para maramdamang kayo talaga ang bagay sa isa't isa. O kaya naman pinipigilan nyo lang o kaya in-denial lang kayo. Ang tawag ko dun ay constipated love, ayaw pang bumigay kahit masakit na.  Platonic kung nakahanda kang sapuhin sya pag nasaktan sya sa relationship nya. Minsan nga hindi ka lang handa, nakatanghod ka talaga, iniintay mong magkahiwalay sila para ikaw uli ang bida sa buhay nya. Platonic din kung gusto mong makalamang, pwede kang magka GF/BF kahit ganun din ang turing mo sa kaibigan mo, kung baga sa data may backup copy ka, yun nga lang kung ganun ang intensyon mo e isa kang certified jerk at dapat sa yo sunugin ng buhay.   Sa ganitong meaning ng platonic, maraming kaso akong alam, marami na rin akong napanood na ganito, marami na ring nobela ang ganito, pati yung TV ad ng magkaibigang pare ang tawagan nila, yun nga lang may nangyaring maganda sa kanila dahil sa shampoo. Sa totoo lang shampoo ko din yun dati, paganda ng paganda chuva, pero walang ganoong ending. Alam na alam ko ito dahil reyna ako ng planetang platonic. Oo, platonic, as in boy and girl platonic, as in walang kinahinatnang platonic, as in wala akong choice kundi platonic, as in buti na ang platonic kaysa wala.

      Bakit masarap maligo sa ulan kesa sa shower sa banyo? Bakit mas masaya kumain ng ice cream sa apa? Bakit mas masarap ang balls ni manong, ang itlog ng pugo, ang lugaw ni Ogo?    Ilang beses na ba tayo binalaan na marumi ang pagkain sa kalye, pero wala talagang katulad at kasing sarap ang mga panindang ipinasyal at rumampa na sa kalsada,niluto sa over-used na mantika, isinawsaw sa espesyal na suka, pinausukan sa tambucho, at tinuhog sa stick.  Pero para mas masarap, kumain kasama ang barkada, magkwentuhan habang nagsasawsaw at naghihintay na matusta ang binili.  Mahahalata mo kung sino ang expert sa pagkain dahil kayang-kaya nya umiwas sa tulo ng sauce o sa talsik ng mantika, hindi rin sya napapaso, at may automatic mental count kung nakakailan na sya. Saya diba?  Kaya yan ang ginawa namin, binalikan namin si manong sa labas ng school para kumain ng fishball at isaw.  Sayang dahil gabi na kami dumating at wala ng fishball.  Kaya tiis kami sa isaw at square na dugo.  IUD at Betamax Sarap!  Masaya manood ng sine, pero mas masaya manood ng DVD habang bumabaha ng chips, dips, tinapay, at coke. Pagkatapos, ang di maubos na kwento at lokohan.  Hay sarap ng buhay. Sa isaw at pirated DVD, daig pa namin ang nanood sa Rockwell at nag fine dining sa Le Soufle' hindi pa magastos.

      It has been my dream to create and  maintain  a web site for so long.  I want a venue for my twisted stories and random thoughts. I already lost count of the web sites I've designed and started but did not reach completion. If ever I reach the point of publishing it, I just couldn't maintain it. Lack of time? Lack of inspiration? Motivation? I don't know.   A blog would be perfect for me. Bakit ngayon ko lang naisip to?

      I will go to Butuan tomorrow to conduct a one-day seminar.  I really don't like to do that but my assistant and my supervisor really wants to travel so I lost.  It's not that I don't want to travel; I just don't like to go there and work.  The dark skies and the strong winds are now giving me the jitters.    Yesterday, my badminton buddies and I were talking about two of our officemates who passed away last year.  Both of them are badminton players too.  When the first one died from a motorcycle accident, the news spread in the office like wild fire.  Everybody was talking about Red  (let's call him Red because he's from the Red team).   There are about 2000 employees in our central office so it's hard to recall his face.  My friends were trying to describe him to me: "Si Red, yung may highlights tapos medyo mahaba yung hair". "Yung laging kasama ni ano...". "Yung partner ni ano nung laro natin sa Sheridan".  I still can't remember him so in desperation, Paolo tried to make a sketch.  I had a person in mind already based on his drawing but imagine my shock when I saw the guy I thought was Red in the canteen.  The other guy, Yellow, died of leukemia.  This one I am familiar with because I once had been in a meeting with him.  Now it's my turn to describe him to my friends.  "Si Sir Yellow, yung naka brush up yung hair, tisoy na taga 15th floor." "Siya yung tumalo sa min nung first game."    Tomorrow I’m traveling by air and the sky doesn’t look too friendly.  My partner was teasing me, asking me on how he should describe me to those who will ask him.  “Si Daday, yung mataba, taga MIS sa 1407” “Kailan lang nakasabay ko pa sa elevator yun eh” “Naglaro pa nga yon ng badminton nung isang araw e.”  Creeeeepy!  I told them, if something happens to me, please refer them to my web site or to friendster. Please don’t try to describe me.  I would really hate it if you can’t describe me well.  I also warned Paolo not to draw my face.    It’s a funny conversation really, though a bit morbid.  Alone in the bus on my way home, it made me think, how would people describe me? How would they remember me? "Si Daday yung taga orange. Yung nakipag rematch sa table tennis, yung nagbigay ng seminar sa `tin, yung kasama natin sa Tagaytay".    Oh well, I better make good and lasting impressions while I can.  I hate to spend 8 hours sitting here in front of my desk.  I can end a day without talking to anybody.  How on earth would they remember me?!  Lord, please keep us safe! I haven’t updated my photo and profile in friendster yet.

Ikaw ba'y napapagod  Araw gabi'y puro kayod?  Buhay mo ba'y walang saysay  Walang sigla, walang kulay? Bawa't araw ba'y pareho Parang walang pagbabago?  Tara na, biyahe tayo Kasama ang pamilya Barkada at buong grupo Para mag-enjoy nang todo.  Halika, biyahe tayo, Nang ating makita Ang ganda ng Pilipinas Ang galing ng Pilipino.  Napasyal ka na ba Sa Intramuros at Luneta Palawan, Vigan at Batanes Subic, Baguio at Rice Terraces?  Namasdan mo na ba Ang mga vinta ng Zamboanga Bulkang Taal, Bulkang Mayon Beach ng Boracay at La Union?  Tara na, biyahe tayo Mula Basco hanggang Jolo Nang makilala ng husto Ang ating kapwa-Pilipino.

Tara na, biyahe tayo Upang ating matamo Ligaya at pagkakaibigan Kaunlaran, kapayapaan.  Halika, biyahe tayo Nang ating makita Ang ganda ng Pilipinas Ang galing ng Pilipino.  -------------------------------------------------------------- Daming tanong ng kantang to! Ang sagot ko: HINDI PA! KAYA TARA NA!  I know summer's over.  I missed our barkada's summer outing this year, sayang talaga.  I feel like I need to unwind. My business trip to Iloilo next week could give me the opportunity to do just that.  But guess what, my much awaited trip to Iloilo was cancelled and we will go to Butuan instead. Butuan! That's in CARAGA, Mindanao.  I don't want to go there! My officemate asked me what are my plans after the seminar in Butuan, I bluntly replied: "Keep myself safe. Ride the soonest trip home!"   But then again, I don't want to be skeptical. Who knows I might enjoy the adventure there.  The only thing I hate about it now is that I'm going to miss the opening of Spiderman.

      I have a series of weird dreams related to badminton.  When I lost my first game in our sportsfest in the office, I can’t sleep thinking about it -- my errors, the crowd, and how can I forget the face of our opponents.  The moment I fell asleep, I dreamt of a shuttlecock flying in mid-air and I naturally smashed it with all my might – with that, I almost fell off my bed.  This dream re-occurred to me, again there was a shuttlecock coming my way and I hit it hard – unfortunately, when I opened my eyes I saw a stranger beside me with a startled look.  Only then I realized that I am in the bus and how silly I look swinging in the air.   After that I didn’t have weird badminton dreams for quite a while, well not until last night.  We recently had a part of our garage converted to a dirty kitchen.  In my dream last night, I saw two of my teammates in our house in full badminton gear.  When I looked down at our kitchen floor, it was covered in taraflex mats! YEEEEHAAA! We can play badminton in our kitchen!  We started moving the dining table and the chairs to the side and put up the net, then I heard my mom calling me – it’s almost six o’clock and I’m late for work!  Maybe these were lapses of our past arguments on what flooring should we use for the new kitchen.  I never suggested taraflex though.   When I thought I was the only one who had a court installed, I figured I was wrong when I had yet another badminton dream when I fell asleep during the lunch break.  I saw Mae.  We were in her new house (though it looked like Sally’s old house),  we were sitting in the living room with some fellow baddicts  (wow extra kayo Rors and Des),  then from the window I can see another baddict coming  (uy extra din si Phonam).   We’re going to have an all-girls game (like how guys spend the night for poker).  When I stood up to open the door for Phonam, I saw Mae’s backyard – 2 taraflex badminton courts! WOW!  Now this is what I call a dream!  Then the bundy clock alarm went off.   Badminton is getting into my subconscious.  Dreaming about the games I lost and the shots I missed are nightmares but having a court in our kitchen and Mae’s backyard, these are ultimate SWEAT DREAMS!

      Do you know the feeling of feeling nothing? As in nothing at all. You’re neither sad nor happy. You’re not excited nor bored. You seem to feel bored but still you don’t want to do anything. You’re not inspired, you’re not interested in anything. You feel like a cloud on a still day, floating with no direction. Your mind is blank, and your body - numb. It’s like being in a coma. Brain freeze! My head contains nothing but thick air and it hurts. What could this feeling be? The feeling of feeling nothing. Questions about your reason of existence passes through your thoughts but it's not enough to wake half of your brain cells.   I hate this feeling.  It feels like you're in a hurry but you don't even know where you're going.  You feel the pressure but not passion, you feel the need but not desire. It is as if dementors sucked out all the happiness in you. Sometimes I think that if I am not happy at all, I would prefer to be sad or hurt.  I prefer the opposite of being happy than the mere absence of it.  The reason movies are worth watching is because it's a story showing the two faces of life, sad and happy, but in real life there are more than two faces.    There is one part in the book "Where the Heart Is" when a kid said to Novalee that he envies her because of all the things that is happeining in her life.  It's full of drama.  Novalee said, look at it this way:  "don't be disappointed that nothing much is happening to you right now, it could only mean that there's a wide range of opportunities waiting for you" , or something to that effect. It makes sense however, it's hardly convincing.   When I feel down with this ill feeling, I sing a song I learned in grade school in my mind:    give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning,  give me oil in my lamp, I pray. Alleluia!   give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning,burning, burning. Keep me burning till the end of the day.

      I want to write my own epitaph but I don't know the details yet, so this will do for now:   Rhodora Encarnacion Pascual    Daday_da_Makulay    System Shutdown: MM DD YYYY  though now in the grave, her colors will never fade  you may also visit me online at:  http://www.daday.com   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Here are some funny epitaphs I found on the web:   The children of Israel wanted bread  And the Lord sent them manna,  Old clerk Wallace wanted a wife,  And the Devil sent him Anna  --------------------------------------  Here lays Butch,  We planted him raw.  He was quick on the trigger,  But slow on the draw.   --------------------------------------  Here lies the body of our Anna  Done to death by a banana  It wasn't the fruit that laid her low  But the skin of the thing that made her go.   --------------------------------------  Here lies an Atheist  All dressed up  And no place to go.  --------------------------------------  Remember man, as you walk by, As you are now, so once was I, As I am now, so shall you be, Remember this and follow me.        - To which someone replied by writing on the tombstome:         To follow you I'll not consent,        Until I know which way you went.

      Malikot ang isip ko.  Mabilis. Sari-sari ang mga pumapasok na ideya.  Kaya naman buong akala ko talaga ay matalino ako.  Pinaniwala ako ng isang award noong kinder pa ako, ng mga tao sa paligid ko, ng magulang ko, kapatid at mga kaibigan. Nagtataka ako noon kung bakit di ako napupunta sa star section.  First time ko noong Grade 4  na ako.  Nung Grade 5, balik row 4 na naman.  Siguro kahit mga teacher ay naguguluhan na sa akin. Pag nilagay nila ako sa mababang section, lutang ako.  Hindi naman ako ang top 1 pero higit kaysa sa karamihan pa rin.  Ilalagay naman nila ako sa star section, mukha naman akong alikabok dun.  Wala rin akong permanenteng barkada. Kaya lahat kaibigan ko, mapa teacher’s enemy o teacher’s pet.  Ako, none of the above.  Di mabait, di masama, di bobo, di rin naman henyo.    Kakaiba lang talaga siguro.  Kung bakit ba naman kasi ako naging first honor nung kinder?! Natatak tuloy sa isip ng marami na matalino ako.  Nakakahiya man e, ang pre-school na pinasukan ko ay lolo ko ang may ari at kamag-anak ko pa ang titser. Natatandaan ko din na pinapalitan ng ate ko pag may nawawala sa mga stars ko na gawa sa ginupit na art paper.  Pero minsan para hindi sayang ang papel, dinadagdagan nya na rin.  Mahirap mapagkamalang matalino pero mas mahirap pag ikaw mismo ang maniwalang matalino ka. Kaya nga hindi ko matanggap nung bumagsak ako nung college.  High school pa lang alam ko na na mahirap ang Math at malinaw na hindi ko na ito makakasundo.  Pero pangarap kong mahigitan ang ate ko, Computer Science siya kaya kumuha ako ng Computer Engineering.  Hindi ko na inisip na ang engineering nga pala ay pinsang buo ni Mathematics! Algebra, Trigo, Analytic Geometry, Differential at Integral Calculus na tig 5 units, Differential Equations (Combined Differential at Integral), Numerical Methods, at Advance Engineering Math. Bumagsak ako sa Differential Equations.  Ako lang sa aming magkakapatid ang nag uwi ng failing mark. Ako lang. Di ba matalino ako? Bumagsak na ang reputasyong “pers onor”.  Hindi naman nagalit ang mama ko dahil siya man daw ay kaaway ni Math.  Ang masaklap ay nasundan pa yun nang bumagsak ako sa Strength of Materials, na di ko maintindihan kung bakit may subject na ganoon sa curriculum ko, e pang civil engineering yun.  Di ko alam kung bakit kailangang i-compute ang force at inertia ng isang bar kung nawawala ang isa sa apat na rivet.  Leche! Di ba problem-solving to? E ano ba problema, di ba kulang yung rivet? E di bumili ng rivet!  Ganyan mga rason ko noon eh, sabay lamukos sa test paper at labas ng classrom!  Naiisip ko tuloy na baka mali ang napili kong kurso. Pero tanungin mo man ang kahit sino, sasabihin sa yong mukha na akong computer.  Sa bahay namin dalawang lugar mo lang ako makikita, sa kama ko o kaya naman sa harap ng computer.  Hindi ako programmer, malinaw yun sa akin. Nangongopya lang ako kay Onat (pasensya na sa teachers ko ha).  Ubusin ko man ang maghapon at magdamag sa harap ng computer, ito ay sa paglalaro, pag gawa ng cards, website, picture editing, at syempre pa ng mga tulad nito, mga salaysay ng buhay.    Gusto kong maging manunulat.  Madaldal kasi ako. Maraming kwento, di nauubusan ng opinyon, di papatalo sa balitaktakan, at marami rin akong mga paniniwalang gusto kong ibahagi.  Computer na lang yata ang hindi sumusuko sa akin,  siya lang ang matiyaga kong tagapakinig.  Maghapon, magdamag, kung kailan ko gusto.  Sinubukan kong gumawa ng tula pero nauwi sa apat na pahina, naging nobela.  Di ako makata. Kahit malamim ako magtagalog.  Makati lang ang daliri’t dila.  Gusto kong pag usapan ang buhay. Ang buhay at damdamin.  Hayag at di hayag.  Gusto kong makilala ang sarili ko.    Pagkatapos ko ng kolehiyo, tumigil na ako sa pagtatanong kung matalino nga ba ako.  Sinumulan ko naman ang taong na “sino ako?”.  Mas mahirap sagutin.  Nasundan pa ng mga mga tanong na “masaya ba ako?”.  Mas mahirap ang kursong ito.  Araw-araw may pasok, walang bakasyon.    Natatandaan ko pa ang tanong ng em-cee sa graduation ko noong kinder: “Ano’ng gusto mong maging paglaki mo?”, isang malakas pero mabagal at umaalong “Paglaki ko, gusto ko pong maging nars”.  Ni hindi ko nga alam ang ginagawa ng nars noon.  Alam ko lang gusto kong maging duktor pero alam ko mahirap yon kaya pwede na maging semi-doctor, isang nars.  Pero kung ngayon mo ako tatanungin kung ang gusto kong maging, hindi ko alam ang isasagot ko.  Gusto kong maging manunulat, maging psychiatrist, maging trainor, web developer, advocate for nature, journalist, madre, negosyante, o isang simpleng may bahay ni Keanu Reeves.    Noong Kinder matalino ako. Noon alam ko ang gusto ko.  20 years na ang nakakaraan.

       source:  urlLink http://www.personalitytype.com/types/istp.html    It's very important that we take time to know and assess ourselves. Go to the link above to find out what kind of personality you have.  Are you  1. Extravert or Introvert (Where is your energy naturally directed?) 2. Sensor or Intuitive (What kind of information do you naturally notice and remember?) 3. Thinker or Feeler (How do you decide or come to conclusions?) 4. Judger or Perceiver (What kind of environment makes you the most comfortable?)   As for me, I am an ISTP.    Life as an ISTP           (Introvert, Sensor, Thinker, Perceiver)            People of this type tend to be: logical, pragmatic, and matter of fact; quiet, unassuming, and autonomous; realistic,   pragmatic, and aloof; impulsive and curious about the physical world; flexible and resourceful; objective and unemotional.  The most important thing to ISTPs is the freedom to act independently and follow their impulses.    How to Love an ISTP              • Appreciate my ability to calmly and quickly solve problems.  • Be a patient and non-judgmental listener.  • Give me plenty of space and freedom to follow my impulses and explore my world.  • Try not to nag me about order or force me to make decisions to quickly.  • Have fun with me, and be open to new adventures I suggest.  • Above all - Don't pressure me to share my feelings or reactions before I'm ready.    So freaking true!

      Our Numerical Methods final exams was scheduled 7-9pm.  We all hate this subject. We don't really give a damn about the proximity of x to c, or when numbers go through standard deviations, or when they reach infinity either by bisection or secant method.  What I know is that I need to copy from my seatmate because my chances of passing approaches zero as well as my food level.    After the gruesome exam, we decided to have dinner first before we go home.  The canteen is already closed and we thought that we deserve something grand after that exam and add it to the fact that it's very rare that the original engineering barkada is complete. Jim, Paul, John, Enoch, Mhel, Onat, and the prettiest of them all, me. We went to Congressional Ave. but no restaurant seems appealing, so went to West Ave., Quezon Ave., and Timog Ave., (no gimmick place in Morato yet), but we couldn't find a nice place for us to eat.  We were losing hope already when we found ourselves in a dark portion of the Greenhills parking lot good thing Goodah was there to save us.  Lamon to the max. Kanin at lugaw, hirap pumili eh. On our way home, at the end of Annapolis St., we found a not-so-packed bar, Music Hall! We went in to peek. Soon we were already dancing to YMCA and having a pretty good time!  Too late when I realized that we just finished the band's last set at 2AM.  I'm dead! I'm sure my mom is going mad already because I did not ask permission. My good buddies Mhel and John brought me home (naturally because we live near each other).  As we go down the bus, we saw my dad waiting for me already.  He didn't say much but from what I remember, he said "Lagot ka kanina ka pa hinihintay sa sala!".  Badong and John took off when we reached our gate.  I want to go with them and escape what awaits me in our living room.  When I entered the house, everybody's present, all furious. My mom asked me: "Sa'n ka galing? Alam mo ba kung anong oras na?!".  With my head down and in a very soft voice I answered   "Kumain lang po ng lugaw"  . My mom was quiet for quite a while then my sister asked:  "Kailan pa nagka lugaw sa Music Hall?!".   Huh?! Patay!  "Pa'no n'yo nalaman?"   Apparently, Jim returned my sister's call when he reached home.  I can just imagine them calling all my friends looking for me as if I were kidnapped. The verdict:  "Mabuti pa wag ka muna mag-aral! Puro ka lakwatsa!".   I really thought they are going to make me stop schooling so I called Paul and told him I'm not going to enroll for the next trimester.  I was crying the whole day.    That's my famous lugaw story.  My friends find so much joy in teasing me by re-telling this story over and over.  When I look back at it, I couldn't help but smile too.  It was one heck-ova-gimmick!  Today, both Goodah and Music Hall do not exist anymore.  Buwahahahaha! Tumalab ang sumpa ko! Hahahaha!

       The morning sky is clear The sun is here to stay After the cold and stormy night I can see the light  My heart has been forgiving My mind forgets it all The pain inside is healing And I can smile again  Moving on, after the hurt is over Moving on, after what I’ve been through Learning from the past, hoping for tomorrow Moving on today is what I should do  It’s time to say goodbye And leave it all behind Letting go to head on So I can start again.    (You don’t know this song. It’s an entry of a friend to the Metro Pop several years ago, too sad it didn’t qualify.)     I dedicate every word in this song to a friend.  I pray that you can utter these words soon.  Things are easier said than done, I know.  On my part, I can always tell you that you can do it, that you have a choice, that you can be independent.  It is also easy for you to say that you have accepted your situation, that it’s better this way, and that you are starting to move on.  I’m sorry but you failed to convince me.  Nobody said it’s going to be easy and nobody said that it’s not going to be painful, and nobody said you can do it instantly, but you need to pick your self up.  Be brave.     Who moved your cheese?   Nobody did.  You’ve eaten it all up at this station and you need to move soon or you’ll starve.  The maze is scary, the search is daunting, and leaving your comfort zone is terrifying.  You need to take a big leap; you just need to make it a leap of faith.  Remember one thing though: you have friends to help you through it.  Unfortunately, I am the Simon (American Idol), the Hukom Bitay, the Genie (Sing Galing hehehe) of your life.  I’m sorry, but it’s my job as a friend to tell you these.

      I can’t help but reminisce our happy days at Hogwarts (AMA), the common room (tambayan), the different houses (courses), the sorting hat (registrar), Professor Dumbledore (the school director) and other professors like McGonagall (dean), and Snape (terror teachers) and of course He-who-must not-be-named (Lord Amable).  Who can forget Hagrid a.k.a. Arnel “Bonel” Cayabyab?  It was really exciting going through platform 9 ¾ at King’s Cross (Muñoz) and riding the Hogwarts Express (jeep).  Had the little red Norwegian dragons (tricycle) messed up your robes? Don’t you just miss the cheers and thrills of Quidditch (basketball)?  Team Captains Oliver Wood and Mike Melendrez, are equally good and good-looking. We may not have Cho Chang but we do have Chong-hai (though they do not have anything in common except the Chinese names).  Do you realize Marlon Adora’s resemblance to Neville Longbottom?  I surely miss strolling along Diagon Alley (SM North Edsa) to buy our wizarding stuff.    I never had food like the ones they serve in our canteen, it’s as exciting as eating Bertybott’s Every-flavor beans!  Badong (Harry? Bongga ka! Salamin lang pareho n’yo!), John (Ron), and I (Hermione) chase the Knight Bus (California Bus) to get home real fast. Ah those were the days...  If you don’t get what I mean, you’re probably a muggle.

        Daday  . Do you think I like my name? Like it? I love it.   When I was in first year high school, turning thirteen and all, I said I don't want to use Daday anymore, it's immature, peculiar, and so pinoy.  I wanted to be called Rhory -- that’s my original nickname which I cannot pronounce when I was little.  Somehow Rhory didn't work for me, so I dropped it.  Daday is easier to say, easier to remember, it's down-to-earth, it's unique, and it's me.  So far, there's no one I know personally that has the same name.  The closest I know is Dada, and her brothers Dodo and Denden and sister Didith.  I should be a member of their family and together we can sing A-dadada-a-dududu.  My friends call me Daday, my teachers call me Daday, my classmates, my officemates, my boss, everybody does.  Some people are not comfortable with it at the beginning but they get the hang of it as soon as they see how well it fits me. Although, there is one person I know that finds my name unacceptable. I could never forget the day of my first class in Informatics, the first time my name will be in the schedule board.  She asked me, "Uh, what name should I write? Daday? Don't you have another name? Can't you think of some other name?" HA! She surely tapped my bitchy nerves so I said slowly as I control myself from strangling her, "Miss, my name is Daday, may problema ba? Put there Daday, that's D-A-D-A-Y."  Everybody in Informatics know that messing up with me was the biggest mistake of her life hahahaha. (Any guess kung sino s'ya? Hahaha.)  Harold calls me Daday Doods, Gen and Abby calls me Daday Kups ("kupad" yun ha!), Cheche calls me and Gen "C'mon-c'mon", Bel calls me Duday (sometimes Dudaykoy when I call her Belekoy), Kudz and Toti calls me Dadskie, my students invented Ma'am D, some call me Da, Dads, Dayday.  The only people who calls me Rhory are my cousins, at least three of them.  Whatever! I consider pet names as term of endearment, it's sweet and very personal.   You might ask where “Daday da Makulay” came from.  It's from a birthday card I received on my debut. Since then I embraced the name and lived up to it.  Life is colorful.  No matter how boring or how simple your life is, it's really a matter of how you take notice of the tiny details and appreciate its value.

      Today I received the list of players who qualified for our company's badminton team.  I'm in! Yeeehaa! We will play in the Government Corporations Athletic Association (GCAA) tournament. Obviously, it will be among government corporations and agencies.  Most of the players (if not all) were participants of  our last year's corporate sportsfest.  We played against each other but now we are in one team.  I can still feel the tension during the try-outs.  I hope all the negative feelings and impressions we had on each other be gone soon or we would surely be an awful sight in the court.      I still believe in the power of badminton bonding and happy hormones.  I hope that once we practice together we will become friends and regular badminton buddies.    To team PhilHealth, the best of luck!

      Like what I have described in a previous post, July 14 (Fourteenth of July) is a day of extremities for our family.&nbsp; My daddy was admitted in the hospital July 11 because he doesn't want to eat anything and his toes hurt.&nbsp; We thought it was that simple. I went on with my normal life, going to my badminton games everyday.&nbsp; Then FOJ came, I was nervous but I didn't want to entertain a nasty thought at the back of my mind.&nbsp; After my game, I went back straight to the hospital hoping that I can go home with my mom and join the get-together for my lola's death anniversary.&nbsp; I cannot remember why I was left behind, my mom went home without me.&nbsp; We had a lousy game that day.&nbsp; We were leading 12-5 then the next thing I knew, the score was 15-12 in favor of our opponent.&nbsp; I thought that was all the bad luck FOJ has for me.   At around 9PM, my daddy's all well and&nbsp;having a happy conversation with us.&nbsp; The young resident doctor went in and said that she will insert a catheter to my dad.&nbsp; It will be a big help for my dad because my dad can't walk.&nbsp; A few minutes after the simple procedure, we noticed blood coming out of the tube.&nbsp; We called the nurse and the doctor.&nbsp; I am not sure if she actually panicked and quickly removed the tube.&nbsp; This started the pain in my dad's lower abdomen.&nbsp; Another doctor came he looked worried, he inserted the tube again and said they shouldn't have pulled it out the first time. My daddy was bleeding pretty badly already and the worried look on the doctor’s face made us panic.&nbsp; After half an hour of screaming and bleeding he decided to just remove the tube again.&nbsp; This doesn't look good.&nbsp; My sister is already going berserk.&nbsp; My other sister and I was crying and praying beside my daddy.&nbsp; I have never seen so many blood in my life.&nbsp; Finally at around 11PM, another doctor came.&nbsp; He looks dignified and experienced.&nbsp; Thank God somebody who seems to know what to do came to help my dad.&nbsp; He told us to go out of the room because he performs the procedure there.&nbsp; He scolded the young doctor and nurses telling them that they should never panic.&nbsp; He's a doctor for goodness sake!&nbsp; I can see more blood from the glass window, I heard more screams, I cried and cried until my eyes hurt.&nbsp; I kept on looking at my watch.&nbsp; I wish that FOJ will be over soon.&nbsp; That&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;the longest hour.&nbsp; Crazy things were running in my mind.&nbsp; Is FOJ a curse?&nbsp;   By 1AM, everything was calm.&nbsp; Blood was all over.&nbsp; It looks like Kill Bill took their final shoot in my dad's room.&nbsp; Daddy managed to thank the doctor before he fell off to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;I took it as a sign that my daddy will be okay soon -- after all he survived FOJ.&nbsp; Who would have known that it was just the start of a long and horrible story of my dad's illness?&nbsp; However, I am thankful that my daddy is still with us, sharing a miracle with us everyday.

       "Overcoming one's fear is one thing but doing it for the sake of a friend is noble."   &nbsp;  I sent this message to three of my friends who donated blood for my daddy.&nbsp; Among those who selflessly donated blood for my daddy's hemodialysis (which we will be forever grateful for), the effort of Mhel, Tine, and Melay touched me the most.&nbsp; Though all donors donated the same amount of blood, these people gave more.&nbsp;    Badong  -- my dearest buddy Badong.&nbsp; I know he was there to accompany Tine and to visit us, but when he decided to be screened too, I know he was there for me like he always had been.&nbsp; Badong never left my side in my most testing moments.&nbsp; Although I've known Badong since first grade, he still continues to amaze me and overwhelm me with his kindness and generosity.&nbsp; I can see uncertainty and fear in his eyes when he entered the blood bank.&nbsp; I know him too well not to notice the slight tremble in his voice, the cold beads of sweat in his forehead but I did not hear a word of reluctance from him.&nbsp; I admire him not only for being courageous but for his concern for me, my dad, and our whole family.    Khristine  - I know Tin's family is one of the most generous in their in their town. &nbsp;My priest friend was telling me how their family is helping in funding church activities. Giving monetary donations to the church and other charities is a great way of sharing your blessings but what Tin did for my dad was more than any amount.&nbsp; She shared herself to us.&nbsp; If you're going to ask me what was I thinking while you were there inside the blood bank, here are some of the things I can translate to words: I was praying that the Lord comforts you and calm you because I cannot go there and hold your hand; I prayed that you feel no pain; I wish I was in your position, being qualified and all; I was thinking that I can never repay you for your kindness; I was thanking God for giving me friends like you; I was trying hard to give you encouragement by acting like a stupid cheerleader behind the glass doors.&nbsp; Your article verified how poor my acting was because you saw through me and felt the guilt I was feeling instead of encouragement.&nbsp; Yes, I was sulking in guilt.&nbsp; I was guilty because you experienced the pain you do not deserve.&nbsp; I was guilty because I did not qualify as a donor because of my darn hepatitis history.&nbsp; These are just some of the things that runs through my mind while blood was coming out of your veins.&nbsp; I was conquering my own weaknesses too.    Melay  -- my partner Melay.&nbsp; This person is one of the most talented person I know.&nbsp; My fingers are not enough&nbsp;to count the different sports and gimmicks she gets into and that is on top of being an outstanding musician.&nbsp; She said it herself that she wants to join the show Fear Factor (apparently AXN's Urban Challenge was too easy for her).&nbsp; I also once told her that she has the guts to match her great talents.&nbsp; But is Melay really fearless? Is it not fear I felt when she was making all those funny excuses? She denied it and proved it by returning to the hospital the next day by herself and very much determined to do it.&nbsp; She said she is uncomfortable with needles but it was not what she consider as a fear.&nbsp; Melay could have done this to prove that she's one hell of a brave girl but more than that she did it because she wanted to help a friend. She showed me that behind the adventure and ceasing the challenge was a sincere and deep concern for my dad and our family.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My badminton buddy Chai (who also donated blood, thanks!) said to me that surprisingly, in times of troubles you will find some of life's greatest joys.&nbsp; If I can measure the amount of courage I have in my being it is way too short for the challenges I now face (read: I'm a self-confessed coward) but the inspiration that our friends and relatives give us in their own way keeps me alive.&nbsp; For our blood donors, thank you.&nbsp; Your blood gave life to all of us who loves my daddy. Thank you for overcoming your weaknesses to give strength to our whole family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Nagmamarunong    She thought she's smart, she thought she knows everything, she thought she understands us  (especially me-- it would really be surprising if she does),  she thought she can do everything, she thought we didn't know that she just recycle things from the internet and other old documents, she thought we wouldn't notice that she's just blabbing most of the time, she thought we still believe the things she say, she thought she's better than any of us, well she thought wrong.  I pity those who still believes her, those who admire her, those who are blinded by her sweet talk and her position.    All it takes is a little bit of honesty and a little bit of humility to accept that it is impossible for a person to know everything and that other people may have better ideas . Oh please! She can't fool everybody.  She can't fool me, that's why she hates me.  She's always defensive when she talks to me and often she would interrupt me and say "Don't bother, I know what you're thinking".  When I'm in a bad mood, I would answer back "Probably not, so hear me out". I'm lucky if I get my chance to open my mouth and say that, most of the times  all I can do is nod then hate myself for it. Since she's not open to our ideas, she ends up doing almost everything by herself.  In the end, this makes us seem useless and it makes her a shining superwoman.   Nagtatanga-tangahan   As much as I hate those who are "nagmamarunong" I also hate those that are "nagtatanga-tangahan".  These are people who seldom use their brains.  For them it's just a mass of muscles in between the ears. They don't like to learn anymore, they don't listen to reasons, they stick to what they believe in, and they itch when they hear the word "logic". There are also those who are passive, who doesn't care about anything.  These are people who asks endless, senseless questions.  Their brains and their mouths seem to have very little distance.  They love to think aloud and advertise their ignorance.    When I was teaching, I always assume that students are intellectuals and not helpless babies.  I treat them with respect and with trust. I trust in the potentials of a person. Just like how I treat newbies in badminton, teach them the basics then forget that they're any less than you are. Give them the dignity of a challenging match.  I don't like those books with titles ending with "for dummies" and "for idiots".  Dummies and idiots don't learn.  They are helpless and dependent on others.  We are not dummies.    Nagmamaganda   She thought she can always get away with things by her charms. Charms? Huh? Think again. `Nuff said.    Nagmamaasim   She's a person who can't be happy for others.  She wants all the fame and glory to herself.  It pains her to see to you happy and successful. Again, `nuff said.  I'm sorry that I have to rant here.  Stress is getting into me.  I just need to let these things out. Breathe. I'm okay now.  Anyway, I will leave the office before three this afternoon and play badminton until 9:00 PM tonight.  That'll surely wash out these angst.

      The fourteenth of July is a very important date for me.  For how many years, it has been an ordinary day in the calendar but in the recent years, there are things that changed my life permanently which coincidentally happened on this date.  Two of the latest deaths in our family happened July 14.  First is my auntie -- a quiet and simple woman.  Though she doesn't say much when she was alive, her death brought anxiety in the family because her children cannot accept it when their father re-married.  After a few years, my lola died due to pancreatitis.  Many things have changed when she died.  One of the things I miss the most is our family reunion which we usually hold on my lola's birthday.  She keeps us together in so many ways, she keeps peace and discipline especially when adults behave and think like little children.  I cannot believe that it has been six years already since she passed away. We usually don't go to work or school on July 14th. We declared it as a family holiday. We go to the church then visit their graves and have picnic there or have a little gathering at home. I just have to say, that my lola's grave is one of my favorite place in the world. We used to go there riding our bikes, or jogging, or with our trusty ol’ jeep Pandoy and hang out.   July 14 is Badong's birthday.  There is one particular celebration of his birthday that affected the lives of so many people in our barkada.  We were in a burger joint in Katipunan, munching on humongous grilled burgers when P announced that he got married that afternoon. Talk about stealing someone's thunder! It was supposed to be Badong's night.  He failed to ruin our appetite though, so we continued eating and delayed our reactions to his announcement.  We just can’t process that kind of news while we are eating our delicious mozzarella burgers.  Paying enough attention to what we’re eating surely saved us from indigestion but ignoring the fact that P married W  (W doesn’t stand for witch ha *wink wink*)  gave us tons of headaches and heartaches which I prefer not to discuss.    This year, on my lola’s sixth death anniversary, we are planning to have a celebration.  The political conflict in our family has been resolved and I can imagine my Ima’s big smile.  I am still hoping that one day our conflicts with P & W will be resolved too. I’m not sure if it has something to do with the arrangement of the planets or other heavenly rocks, but I await for life’s little surprises every FOJ.

      What does a baddict do in Butuan? What else?! Play badminton!   Oh yes, I was able to play eventhough I am in a remote place of the country where the bars have happy meals, the movies are delayed, and where Sun Cellular's sun doesn't shine.  In our courtesy meeting with our regional director, AVP Johnny, he said that Caraga is a very poor region.  He told us about the history of Caraga, the problems they have in transportation, and other problems in the office.  I think he failed mention any problems in the peace and order.  When he was running out of stries, he asked if anybody wants to join him in the Cathedral for the Novena (since it was a Wednesday) and nobody answered, then he asked if anybody wants to join him play badminton the following night. Me! Me! Me!   Without second thoughts, I said yes to his offer, even if I don't have my racket with me.  After the seminar, he invited everybody for dinner and said he will send someone to pick us up in the hotel.  I thought he forgot about our game.  When we were about to leave the office, he said to the driver, "bring them to the hotel and wait for Daday to change, bring her to the badminton court."  Yeeehaaaaa! Doña ang lola mo! At the PPA (Philippine Ports Authority) abandoned warehouse, they built 2 badminton courts.  I was impressed by the quality painted cement court (better than some of the cement courts here in Manila).  I saw some staff from our regional office.  They are all good.  I hear "whapack" everywhere!  I wish I could bring them all to Manila because we have a tournament in two weeks.  After losing 2 games in a row, I had a chance to talk to the nice lady who lend me her racket.  I asked her who maintains the court because I can't see any office or shop, not even a desk.  The courts are maintained by the Butuan Badminton Club, she said that they pay twenty pesos per hour. What?! Twenty pesos! Boy, you're lucky, we pay 150-300 pesos per hour back home!  She said, they were even complaining because it used to be just 11 pesos.  I learned that there are three badminton courts in Butuan.  Two in government land and one privately owned.  In the other government court you only have to pay 10 pesos which is good for one whole day.  The private court costs 75 pesos per hour, which they think is way too expensive.  No wonder they are all good in badminton, they can play all day without straining their wallets!  After two more power-packed games with Sir Johnny (we won 1 game hahahaha, 1-1), I was so tired and thirsty already.  I don't have water with me and I can't find a place to buy.  When I looked around I saw a mini-ref.  From its glass door I can see a big bottle of water.  Suddenly the court turned into a desert, I am so freakin' thirsty!  I can take the risk even if I'm not sure if the water inside the ref is potable.  The only problem is, the refrigerator is locked with big chains. Aaaaarrrggghhh!!!   How is badminton in Manila different from badminton in Butuan?  1.  The court fees! 2.  They all have good rackets (perhaps because they save a lot from the court fees) 3.  They play for only one reason -- pure love for the sport! Not for the "japorms" or anything. 4.  No badminton politics. 5.  No pro-shops, canteens, and no masungit na bantay. 6.  The discipline.  Eventhough no one's taking care of the court full-time, the comfort rooms are clean and  there's no problem with the queueing eventhought there are only two courts. 7.  They all speak Visaya while playing, and I don't understand a thing they say! Pastilan!  Once again, badminton paved the way for me to reach out to other people.  People of different status and different origins.  I surely enjoyed playing badminton the Butuan style.

        AJ's Message of Thanks at our dad's funeral mass     Unedited    Words are not enough to express how much we were overwhelmed with the overflowing love and sympathy our friends are relatives have shown us during our time of suffering and grief.  When my dad was hospitalized last July 12 at the Chinese General Hospital, he was found to have so many illnesses.  It was a shock to us to find out the so many complications he had, despite the weekly check-ups. We only knew he had stroke several times in the past 7 years. For each of the five strokes that he had, he was so blessed not to have any permanent physical damage.  But his last hospitalization seemed to tell us that daddy’s end of earthly life is coming to an end.   We thank God for the opportunity that we were able to have family bonding when daddy was in the hospital and when he spent more than one week at home.  I would always say, there was never a dull moment, as you know, Daddy’s a born comedian, despite of his sufferings he would always make us laugh. Whenever he feels pain, he would always request us to pray for he believes that only the Lord can take away all his pains.  He would even request us to sing for him his favorite song Amazing Grace hoping that somehow he could forget his ordeal by pondering on the words of the song.  We had so many visitors at the hospital and at home for the past three weeks, and that made my dad very happy and hopeful that he could overcome these trials.  There was a tremendous number of people who went to his wake for the past three nights.  Love was overflowing; Masses and Prayer Services were endless.  These made us feel that we will easily overcome our grief over the loss of Daddy.  We would like to thank all the priests who visited my dad in the hospital and at home, Dad was anointed and given the Last Sacrament at least 7 times!  The priests who came over to the house during the wake to celebrate Mass and give him funeral blessings, and the priests who gave us comforting words even if they were not able to come to visit.  To the Pascuals in the United States and Quezon City, thank you for your support and prayers. To the Encarnacion family who was with us all the way and helped us through our ordeals. To Ipe and Abet who helped us take care of daddy To my dad’s doctors, thank you for doing all the best you can to save dad’s life. To all the parish organizations, our friends in the religious orders To my dad’s colleagues at the NSO and Sacred Heart Memorial Corporation To our colleagues in the Asian Development Bank, PhilHealth, Meycauayan Rural Bank To our neighbors, friends, and to everyone….  Thank you for joining us in our thanksgiving to God the Almighty Father for giving Daddy to us.  I am sure. in one way or another,  Daddy, Pepot, Mang Joe, Bro. Joe, Pareng Joe, has touched your lives.  Truly my dad’s life was an Amazing Grace from God.
