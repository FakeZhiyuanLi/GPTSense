        your heart... felt good.    and so it went on, this slow progress on my thesis. Bits and pieces floating out... with trepidation, hesitation... out of the abyss of not-formed ideas and made into something solid, signifying some commitment of faith from me. so i guess i believe this, i wrote it, it's mine. or an incarnation of somebody elses, jumbled with some breath of my own.  i can't guess at how much the music i listen to as i write affects my thoughts. because, dammit if i can't even decide on punctuation listening to the string quartet tribute to coldplay (can you blame me?) but put on the moon and antarctica and modest mouse has me NAILING out critical development theory. with conviction.  with conviction.

      So the best friend, she is a-gettin' married. the bachelorette party was this weekend: a crazy parade of performing femininity and heterosexuality. it was fun, it was spectacle, it was pieces of the real and the hyper-real, and i was glad to do it because i love my friend. the craziest part of it to me was that there seemed to be so much of underlying discourses of loss and escape  -- as in "we're losing her from this prison of singledom, but hallelujah she's going on to a better place."  standing back i kept feeling like the mid-to-late-twenties boat to monogamy and marriage was leaving and i couldn't decide whether to give it a good kick ("GOOD RIDDANCE!!!") or to dramatically hip-hop aboard. i think that i don't want to be on that boat, i'm FAIRLY sure i do not, but still, as i'm looking at it as it's leaving with all of my friends on it, i'm wondering if i'm going to realize suddenly (too late of course) that dammit, that boat was THE way to go. lord knows i've kicked enough relationships to the curb once they threatened to get too serious (or felt serious for too long). but EVERYONE'S doing it. the ultimate peer pressure.  of course, with the best friend (and i hope, with others) there is a stable, long-term loving relationship not fraught with drama and baggage.  In other news, one of my favourite bands, the Unicorns, came to my hometown this week and i had a "unicorn party" to celebrate the occasion. it was complete with a "pin the horn on the unicorn" and unicorn piñata. i invited the band. hahaha. they actually came (or jaime and nick did, to be exact) and i was fuh-reaked out over this fact. they ate some carrots and drank some sangria and then were pleased to smash my piñata to bits on stage with their guitar. so fun, so strange, what a week.
