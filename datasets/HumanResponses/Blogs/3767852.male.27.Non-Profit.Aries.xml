						   Once we get to the essence of life all things become quite clear; not easy, but clear. Say we believe in love, the expansion of emotions in our hearts until it  literally feels like we’re overflowing, it is easy to make a monetary sacrifice or to abandon some pursuit after security or excellence. Even teenagers get this automatic functioning right, we do and choose whatever we believe in most. This is the key to unlocking a life of fulfillment and joy: to know what the underlying values and beliefs are that drives us to make each decision. These real values differ greatly from the pseudo list we would draw up if asked to write our most important principles and priorities.   Christ and the school of ladders  How high can He go? Jesus is in the business of climbing ladders. Important to note however is that he climbs ladders, He never resides on them. This game of snakes and ladders describe with brutal clarity the powerful position we have in our dealings with Christ. We do not have the power to make Him do anything, but we do have the power to reject Him. He desperately wants to climb up our ladder of true priorities, but we have the capacity to effectively blocking Him through our desire for food, clothing, shelter, money, TV, gossiping, friends, spouses, books, laziness, status, power, lust, greed, fear, etc. It is a long road to submit these things as steps for Christ to reach the highest position in our minds and in our hearts. Once we start to think honestly and practically of situations we will recognize which desires are steps on the ladder that Christ is not permitted to climb. So He waits for us on this ladder, yet if we continually block his progress up, he climbs down, further away from our hearts. Then it’s up to us to invite him again to start the climb to our highest priority. He only climbs upon invitation, but the miracle is that he continues to accept the invitation, even after all our mid-way rejections as he reaches the central parts of our ladders. So, next time you sing: “We exalt thee” let us mean it, let us sacrifice our priority steps, let us invite Christ to step higher, until he reaches the top and reign our lives.  “Dear friend and savior Jesus, I invite you to climb my ladder, over all other priorities, to the very top. That is why I fast, that is why I pray, it is the meaning of my solitude, silence and service. I give my things (time, money and opportunities) away to invite you to climb higher, to conquer my heart. Be the God of my ladder.”
