      from entertainment weekly:   Celebs plan ''Simpsons,'' ''King of the Hill'' cameos. Everyone from Brad Pitt to Tony Blair will appear   Brad Pitt apparently hasn't let the lackluster box-office for his ''Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas'' deter him from doing more cartoon voiceover work. He'll be leading a Texas-sized contingent of celebrities doing voice cameos next season for ''King of the Hill'' and ''The Simpsons,'' Fox announced Thursday.  Pitt will bring his pipes to ''King,'' as will Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Jamie Kennedy, Laura Dern, and Fred Willard. Several country stars will visit Arlen, Texas, for the Christmas episode, including Trace Adkins, Brad Paisley, George Strait, Deana Carter, and Travis Tritt. Other musicians slated to appear are Kiss' Gene Simmons and Texas' own Kelly Clarkson.  Over in Springfield, the 15th (!) season of ''The Simpsons'' opens with an episode featuring the return of Glenn Close as Homer's fugitive mom. Another returning parent: Jackie Mason, as the rabbi dad of Krusty the Clown. The Halloween ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode will feature Jennifer Garner, Jerry Lewis, and boxer Oscar De La Hoya. The already much-touted trip to England (in an episode called ''The Regina Monologues'') will include appearances by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ian McKellen, J.K. Rowling, Jane Leeves (as Grandpa Simpson's old flame) and token Yank Evan Marriott (of ''Joe Millionaire''). Also visiting Springfield will be Simon Cowell, Mr. T, ''Bowling for Columbine'' director Michael Moore, and the late Robert Stack.

      The Strokes shot a video last night in Brooklyn, N.Y., for "12:51," the first single from their sophomore album, "Room on Fire," due Oct. 21 from RCA. As with videos for prior tracks such as "Last Nite," "Someday" and "Hard To Explain," the new clip was directed by Roman Coppola. "12:51" will be delivered Sept. 9 to U.S. radio outlets for airplay consideration and released commercially Oct. 6 in the U.K.  Like its predecessor, 2001's "Is This It," the new album contains 11 songs but at just over 32 minutes in length, is about three-and-a-half minutes shorter than the debut. A number of songs underwent last-minute renaming, with "Raga" changing to "Automatic Stop," "Supernova" morphing into "12:51" and "Never Needed Anybody" being altered to "Between Love and Hate."

I've been wanting to do a record with loud guitars for a long time." [ urlLink rolling stone ]

I find them all to be just a bit of a sham. I mean I don't mind, I don't care, that's for some people who are into that. But don't be telling me what my life is. Because in the likes of Kelly Osbourne and this silly Lavigne thing, yapping on about what punk is or isn't—it's just unbearable. At their age, if they're calling me old, then I want to know why they haven't done nothing of their own. Nothing. It's all borrowed from my life. Therefore, they have no word of any value in it.”   urlLink ever wonder what happened to that nirvana  nevermind baby ?  i didn't either.

      it was a kind of eery and lonely walk from lincoln center (66th street and broadway) to williamsburg, brooklyn. there were thousands of people around me, many of them walking in two and threes and even fours. i scurried past them.   i opted not to put on my headphones. i wanted to be aware of everything going on around me, sirens from cop cars and fire engines, the screaming babies, the radio news blasting from random cars parked on the street, the screeches of car brakes as they tried to make their way through intermittent deadlocks.   i stopped by the entertainment weekly building to see if there would be any familiar faces there. there wasn't.   i continued on and made my way downtown via second avenue. there were all sorts of wacko traffic activity because of the lack of traffic lights and traffic cops. conscientious civilians began to take matters into their own hands, helping to direct traffic. that was nice to see.   i kept walking.  many stores were closing. delis were also closing down. many people perched outside of their office buildings to wait it out. i wanted to get out of the hectic mess that consumed midtown. i trudged on faster, getting annoyed at all the slow pedestrians who happened to wear their stilleto sandals to work. suckers. i had my trusty converse.  i couldn't help my memories of sept. 11, which flooded back to me. the chaotic scene of thousands of people on the street, similar to now. i knew we were going through a huge blackout that spanned the north eastern united states, but who knows what would happen in our incredibly vulnerable state? i remember walking across the 59th street bridge on sept. 11 with several other friends. most of us walked in silence as we saw the empty, smoky downtown skyline from the bridge.   i got down to the east village and thought i would check to see if my friend rachel was home. she wasn't. i saw one of her neighbors, and they kindly offered me some bottled water. i took it. i started to feel like i was going to pass out, not only by the physical exertion and dehydration but because mentally, i just wanted to talk to and relate my feelings to another person and there was no one. my cell phone continued to not work, and i felt so frickin' irritated.   i continued to walk.     i got near the entrance to the williamsburg bridge, and i actually saw people i used to work with at alloy -- will, john, bill, and tim. i was overjoyed. i began to take some photos of what was going on around me. i smoked a cigarette. i trudged on and chatted about what the hell was happening around us. i felt the 59th street de ja vous again. it made me woozy.               we ran into deron who was on his way into the city to find anna. i thought to myself, that is totally crazy. he should just stay home and wait for her to come home! but it wasn't my business so i stayed quiet and wished him luck on his search. when i turned around, the alloy peeps were gone. they hadn't waited for me. jerks.  then i ran into chingyi and her friend. they were heading to bed-stuy. we separated.  i continued to walk, again on my own.   when i finally reached my house, keith was there waiting for me. he had been terribly worried, and i was glad that i had someone who still cared about my whereabouts. it was a nice feeling, and i didn't feel so alone anymore. the blackout was not the most pleasant experience, but at least one good thing can still result from it.   urlLink ')"> getCount(' ')

      the walkmen show previewed in the  urlLink new york post . you should note that the walkmen haven't quite risen to "superstardom" status (at least not until hamilton marries j.lo after she divorces ben), and adam green is still in the moldy peaches so he's not exactly "ex-Moldy Peaches". ugh.    August 5, 2003 -- TO prolong that summertime feeling, pray for no rain, have some pink drinks al fresco in the Meatpacking District, then head to Pier 54 (West Side Highway at 14th Street; no phone) for the Walkmen on Thursday at 7 p.m..   They first rose from the ashes of Jonathan Fire*eater and then rose to national superstardom with their Saturn ad-tune, "We've Been Had," but the neo post-punk band isn't resting on its laurels.   The New York quintet, fronted by the theatrical Hamilton Leithauser, has a follow-up to the vintage-piano sprinkled "Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone." Expect new tunes. Adam Green (ex-Moldy Peaches) and the Oranges Band open.

      WOW! DON'T YOU WANT ME?  THE HUMAN LEAGUE FEATURING: PHILIP OAKEY JOANNE CATHERALL SUSANNE SULLEY  w/Guest DJ MICHAEL T (of MOTHERFUCKER)Spinning before and after THE HUMAN LEAGUE  August 5th $25.00 Advance $30.00 Day of Show SRO * Doors @ 6PM 8 PM  Synth-pop's first international superstars, the Human League was among the earliest and most innovative bands to break into the pop mainstream on a wave of synthesizers and electronic rhythms, their marriage of infectious melodies and state-of-the-art technology proving enormously influential on countless acts following in their wake.  Their breakthrough hit was the classic single "Don't You Want Me," from the album Dare!; both topped their respective charts in England, and went on to become major hits in the U.S. as well.  In 1983, they scored a pair of hits with "Mirror Man" and "(Keep Feeling) Fascination."  To the surprise of many, the Human League resurfaced in 1986 with Crash, produced by the duo of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; the plaintive lead single "Human" soon topped the U.S. charts.

       in defense of liars i've heard a lot of people griping about the "secret" liars show on saturday night at the knitting factory. ok, here's my response: if you didn't like any of the four songs that liars played on saturday night, then you probably never really liked noisy post-wave rock. that's ok, of course. so they've become more experimental -- so what? my guess is that all that touring with sonic youth has heavily influenced the band, and they're trying out a new sound. i have to admit, i was curious as to what the band would sound like minus two original members, but i wasn't disappointed by the band on saturday -- i was disappointed by the fans, most of whom were stiff as a board during the set. and for some reason i was surprised that the guys didn't play any oldies and sad that their set didn't last longer, but that doesn't mean i didn't like what they played. this band has never been about following what the rest of williamsburg has been churning out. keep that in mind, dearies. the new york rock revolution will soon skew towards more experimentalism, and mtv rock will fade into the  trl  countdown.

"bitch, i put you on the list, you're jackey's plus one!" uh, jackey didn't tell me! it was funny cuz he called her up right then and there and yelled at her. ha. then he bought me a drink. sweetheart. love love him! i told him i didn't mind buying tickets and supporting the bands. he called me a dying breed. then he introduced me to katie from  young people  who was knitting at the knitting factory. priceless!  i didn't see cameron or bidi around, but mike d tells me they were there. i did run into Say Hi To Your Mom. chatted with those boys for quite a while. it was nice to run into them again. i loved their set, and i thought that lead singer eric had such a cute stage presence. i love running into people at shows these days. i feel like going to shows is so much more of a community event now. a couple years ago for me, it was just going to a show and seeing a band. now it's like seeing many of my friends.    liars  played songs from their forthcoming album, which includes tracks that are more experimental. and angus gets on the guitar! i didn't get to snap any photos, but i did rock out. i have to say though that the crowd was pretty lame. it's probably the tamest crowd that liars have ever played for. why don't you dance, people! start a little ruckus. by the time i got into the front and center area, the boys had just finished their final song. that was the shortest set ever!  naf gave me a bootleg of  dirty on purpose  and  on!air!library!  at the sin-e show. i think i might post a couple of the tracks online here for a limited amount of time -- maybe when i have the photo galleries up. for the rest of the night i lost track of the friends i came with (they ended up in chinatown) and so i hung out with mike d and kevin. alcohol was just not agreeing with me that night.   the next liars show: october 30 at the bowery ballroom. buy your tickets now, suckas.  also tonight, go see  sea ray  at the bowery ballroom with  clem snide !

      tonight i went to luxx -- you know that glorious rock club of old that used to have punk/dance/electroclash shows and hipsters hanging outside smoking and bullshitting? yeah, that one. there's also a new "carribbean bar" that opened up a couple doors down from the club. if you haven't heard yet, luxx is turning into a gay dance club beginning oct. 25. but right now there is a late night gay dance party on friday -- after the rock shows. so during the  25 suaves  set (a husband and wife team like the white stripes only harder, crazier and better), i stepped out for a cigarette and some alone time. that was probably my big mistake. while i'm smoking, i overhear this conversation.   guy one:  so you're gay right?  guy two:  no i'm straight.  guy one:  oh, i'm straight too.  obviously though guy one does not believe that guy two is straight. he continues.   guy one:  things are so different now. back in the day, i could batter you.  needless to say, guy two soon snuffs out his cigarette and heads back into the club. unfortunately, of course, that means that guy one moves his interrogation on to me.   guy one:  you probably don't want to talk to me after you heard that conversation.  me:  [silence, puffing cigarette]  guy one:  can i ask you one question?  me:  no.  guy one:  just one question. c'mon!  me:  no.  guy one:  just tell me, what makes you want to be with the same sex?  me:  excuse me? what are you talking about?  guy one:  what makes you want to rub up on another girl?  me:  what the hell are you talking about? i don't.  guy one:  you don't? ah man, i fucked up didn't i? but what makes you want to have a relationship with another girl?  me:  i don't.  at this point he must have lost his train of thought or was thoroughly confused. he continues.   guy one:  oh you're chinese!!  me:  [silence, puffs cigarette faster]  guy one:  you're chinese right?  me:  no.  guy one:  you're not chinese? ah man i fucked up again, didn't i? you're not chinese?  me:  no. what are you?  guy one:  puerto rican. if you're not chinese, what are you?  me:  korean.  guy one:  oh. i fucked up. i know you don't want to hear my story but let me tell you anyways...  me:  no, don't tell me your story.  at this point, he tries to light his cigarette with mine and i back away, saying, "i have a lighter." this somehow perturbs him and he says, "keep your lighter." and finally, walks away. i went back into the club, but left shortly after. this kind of weird harassment does not bode well for the gay disco and its carribbean neighbor.

      thanks to all who came out last night to the show at sin-e. i thought  urlLink  on!air!library!   was amazing. the new drummer kevin adds depth to their dark, moody songs. pee and ali's voices sounded wonderful. and i love claudia on the farfiza!   as announced on  urlLink melodynelson  yesterday, i have begun to manage  urlLink  dirty on purpose  . so i've been going to the last few practices as they ran through their set list for last night, and i knew it was going to be killer. the set was pretty heavy, and they debuted a new song tentatively titled "spider eyes" where joe sings in a voice that draws me in every time because it is so distinctive. many of their songs flowed really nicely into each other. and they ended with everyone's favorite, dynamic instrumental, "monument." it was totally hot.   urlLink  pela   also sounded wonderful live, and the boys in that band were such a joy to talk to! as sweet as the music they were singing. lead singer billy has this unique voice that rings with heartfelt, uplifting melodies -- a voice that really carries the beautiful music they create. my faves are from their ep -- "episode," "latitudes" and "venom." and the live performance was just as good, if not even better, than their recording. i was so happy!  surprisingly, i knew the keyboardist in  urlLink  say hi to your mom   already! so when alex walked into soundcheck yesterday, i was like, "hey, i know that guy!" funny how that happens, eh? i had never seen them live, but i've been listening to their mp3s online for a while now. so i was very excited to see shtym in the flesh! and i must say they delivered. i hold "the fritz" dear to my heart. i love how the songs are so smooth musically and have this really cool, almost jazzy vibe to them -- eric's vocals have a mysterious edge, and then the lyrics have sarcastic, witty bite, which gives the songs even more appeal. can't wait to see them again!  it made me so happy to see so many of my friends at the show -- christian and justin from bishop allen, naf from OTM Tokyo, Knife Skills, deron, Jenna, Jeff Sea Ray, Asobi Seksu, rachel, jennifer, the Red Comes Up, June Fool, the jean genie, Divestar, Miss Modern Age, melody nelson, jasper jenyk, new york doll and more that i am probably missing cuz my brain is so foggy (but you know who you are!). thanks for coming and making a girl like me so very happy.  photos from the show coming soon...

Born and raised in England but presently based in New York, Leona Naess is an introspective singer/songwriter whose alternative pop-rock draws on influences ranging from Edie Brickell, Tori Amos and Joni Mitchell to the Cure, David Bowie and Joy Division. -- allmusic.com

       urlLink finally someone agrees with my opinion that  meg white of the white stripes  is boring!     Seeing the duo in concert is like watching a gifted artist cut a demo. It's as if he says to Meg, "Hey, can you just keep time for me while I get this stuff down on tape?"  ...The songs blurred like the years and spoken words slurred into one another, and the whole thing slowly turned into a bunch of electro pseudo-blues gobbledy gook.   ...Meg's simplistic skin-pounding, her child-like delivery and coy posturing resemble a stunt more than they suggest unique technique or talent. Even the White Strpes' positioning onstage -- Jack frequently singing incoherently into a mike behind the drums, Meg playing directly to him at all times -- suggested as much. The only thing that made her a better choice than a drum machine was her partner's ability to control her tempo without physically pushing a button. Well, she's cute, too.

      spoiler tee-shirt tagline contest from  urlLink drewbacca : Hey hep cats,  SPOILER 3 is just a month away, and one of the myriad tasks that must be done between now and then (apart from actually finishing our films), is that t-shirts must be made!  The t-shirt, as we see it, will consist of the SPOILER logo and a tagline.  Rather than stick with the boring "A Comedy Film Project" tagline, we thought we should drum up a new one for the shirts.  Something with moxie and, preferably, razmatazz.   We've come up with a few ideas already, but thought: hell, why not get as many ideas as we can?  So, without further ado, I'd like to announce the SPOILER T-Shirt Tagline Contest!  Email us your ideas for the SPOILER t-shirt tagline by the end of the day WEDNESDAY, and if yours is the lucky winner, we'll send you a $20 gift certificate to Amazon, and a SPOILER t-shirt.  That's right: you can have your bullshit immortalized on a t-shirt, AND get that DVD of Daddy Day Care you've been salivating over.  For those who don't know what SPOILER is, please check out our website at:  urlLink http://www.spoilerfilms.com   Cheers,  Drew  urlLink spoiler@drewbacca.com

      "The city itself and the scene feels jaded now. I can remember seeing Interpol a few years back and there was hardly anyone there. No one really cared about local bands back then. You could never get a gig. The only way people would book you is if you could bring an audience. Now a NY band can go from opener to headliner in a month and after three months they have a recording contract and a manager. It's crazy. It seems so hyper-aware of the outside attention. The heartfelt passion and the authenticity to just f*cking rock out just because you need to,  with your friends. I think that's really tainted." --  Nick Zinner  [from annabiotica] Hmm, wonder what bands he's talking about?

        last night, annabiotica and i rushed downtown to the knitting factory to see three of our favorite guys in the new york rock scene:   urlLink jude, luke and dAve  . when we got to the box office we found they annointed us with nicknames on the guest list: anna "kicking ass and taking names" barie and uh, jinners. the box office guy smiled and asked, "how am i supposed to ID you gals?"   we snuck into the green room and greeted the boys, thanked them for putting us humble and po' girlies on the list. then minutes later,   urlLink qatsi   took the knitting factory stage and totally kicked ass on that tiny stage (was it always that itty bitty?).   this new york trio gets tighter and tighter every time, and they are a joy to watch on stage. dAve really gets theatrical on stage... at times it seems like playing guitar is musical masturbation for him, and he continually flirts with the crowd. we wanted more luke (aka more drums!) 'cuz he's a giant drummer in more ways than one, and we wanted the music to pound more. and jude's voice was in stellar condition as he got all hot and sweaty under those stage lights. and we ate it up when he jumped off stage for that song we can't remember the title of. what's the title of that song???     ***  anyhoo, a coupla my friends work for the PR company that represents narciso rodriguez. isn't his  urlLink spring 2004 collection  totally hot? not very indie or hipster, true, but if you walked into a club wearing  urlLink these numbers , the rock stars would be drooling all over you, fo sho.  ***    why are there praying mantis on the subway? it freaked everyone on the train. nature gets too close to us nyoo yawkers again!   ***  happy belated birthday, cameron. may you find your gravy train!

         it was heartwarming to see   urlLink bishop allen   take the stage at the bowery ballroom, under the red and blue glow of the stage lights... the cheering fans up front, us loyal followers who have been waiting for the group to return from their ambitious, long summer tour. and finally we get our fill of a band that's totally changing the sound of brooklyn. and they are getting lots of radio play on kexp.org, too, so i'm totally siked for them. john in the morning knows what's up!  they played my favorites and did a cover of talking head's "psychokiller." bonnie says they've been playing that cover all summer -- they did a great job of giving the song their own twang. some of my fave bishop allen tunes include "quarter to three," "eve destruction," "busted heart," "another wasted night," "little black ache," "charm school" and of course, "things are what you make of them." yep, they played all my faves -- though i have to say i love ALL of their songs. they are the shiznit, and you betta recognize. and a special hello to new bishop allen member christian o, the girl with mad skills on the xylophone.  after their show i chatted for a while with  urlLink a great photographer , and then the band and blake downstairs. then i pulled myself away to head over to vicious at sin-e. talked with jasper and audrey. said hello to luke, yannick, bill jr., hugged dennis, heard the candy butchers canceled the bowery show (fuckers!), chatted with some asobi seksu, wanted to see the fiery furnaces, but decided i couldn't cuz i was so tired. so tired! so now, folks, i'm off to bed.

         i really liked the kings of leon after i saw them live... more on their set later (they were joined by ben kweller on stage for one song)....   the kings of leon afterparty was downstairs at the bowery after the show. it was pretty crazy. i met ben kweller who has a mighty grip. the kings in the flesh. i saw julian and the rest of the strokes. i stood next to nick valensi for part of the time during the kings set in the balcony. i met gina gershon. it was an insane night of meeting people. and now my feet hurt.  here is the one photo i got of julian and the back of nikolai. i kept wanting to take a formal photo of julian and other rock stars, but he sensed that and ran away downstairs. har har. whatever -- i didn't want to be like the papparrazzi around us. that was actually quite sickening.   i have come to hate the papparazzi and thank god i am not a celebrity! flash flash flash. how annoying to stand there talking and feeling like you're going to have an epileptic seizure. this one guy seemed so normal. he came up when we were talking to gina gershon and he acted like he knew her. gina was like, "when have we met?" and he was like "at some premiere for some film, i'm sure." then he asked her something like "did you make out with some chick and could you recreate that moment?" d'oh, it was papparazzi. he kept saying it as we walked away. shit like that must happen to celebs all the time. i was so weirded out by the experience. also in attendance were liv tyler, drew barrymore who was making out with fab quite a bit, that mooney suzuki guy, the donnas, jet, and a host of other rock stars i'm sure i didn't recognize.   along the way i ran into justin from bishop allen. bloggers. nina and matthew. jco! and the red comes up. more news later...   and now a moment of silence for 9-11.  apparently, there are bloggers including me in this mtv you hear it first  urlLink stellastarr* piece . co co co! i learned from reading hard glitter and listening to dennis that the realistics will return to the bowery ballroom oct. 3 in support of the candy butchers (that guy who sang "that thing you do"), jonny lives and the flesh. erik -- that's all you!

       december, baby    i could have gone to see the strokes/kings of leon show, probably hanging somewhere in VIP (through work, of course, not jinners) but my boys and my girl were playing a show at the mercury lounge, and like a good manager, i went and saw one of the coolest nights of rock i've seen in a long time, including cmj.      i am so so so very proud of  urlLink  dirty on purpose   for pulling off a spectacular, amazing, wonderfully, exhilarating set last night, pulling in the second most people of the night, second only to the headliners,  urlLink  the decemberists  . i have a major crush on colin meloy, who reminds me of colin firth. i want to travel to portland to see this band play again!! dirty on purpose did a fucking awesome, tear-jerking cover of "summer of 69", and i was totally floored.       urlLink  earlimart   also blew me away with a robust, energetic performance that was both beautiful and whimsical.  urlLink  pela   performed probably their most perfect set yet, playing all of my favorites! i can't believe that every band on the bill tonight was FUCKING AWESOME. it was a totally sold out event, packed to the brim on a wednesday night, days after cmj madness. how cool is that?

          the strokes & the rapture: new york rock's latest hangover…    Albums by the Strokes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Walkmen, the Liars, Oneida, the Ex Models, Enon and Animal Collective and the collection "Yes New York" proved that the music still sounds exhilarating offstage. But now comes the hard part. Every celebrated local scene has a half-life, from Detroit and Memphis in the 1960's to New York City and Athens, Ga., in the 1970's to Minneapolis in the 1980's to Seattle in the 1990's. To survive beyond the initial buzz, the music has to point someplace new.   [ urlLink new york times ]  yay!  urlLink  fiona apple   is about two weeks from finishing her next album. the album is slated for a february release.   Among the songs guaranteed to make the final cut of the yet untitled 10-song LP are "Extraordinary," a Tin Pan Alley-esque blend of Tom Waits and Vaudeville, and "Better," an OutKast-like deluge of beats.   [ urlLink rolling stone ]   urlLink  fischerspooner   go wild on  #2 .   The new wave/electro sound of their debut is still intact, but Fischer said the album will also feature songs like "Downup," which he described as an "anthemic shoegazer" track that mixes influences such as Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine with a dash of the Ronettes.

      i saw  lost in translation  and wasn't as impressed as everyone else seems to be. sofia coppola had the potential for an interesting story, but she didn't quite develop anything too much. but the movie was beautifully shot. i really liked the mood of the movie, but it dragged at times without ever really going anywhere. my favorite scene was indeed the karaoke scene.  i also went to see  kill bill  for the second time this weekend. it was just as great the second time around. i am totally into the gogo character. anna tells me that this is the same girl from battle royale. i heard that quentin tarantino saw gogo in battle royale and decided to cast her in this role. how awesome. i am dying to see this flick. must surf ebay.  drank pumpkin ale and saw  willard  tonight with george, dj, gary and joe. that movie was terrible. awful. patooey! joe totally called the fact that crispin glover sings "ben" at the end. it was a movie-filled weekend, where music hardly played a part. very rare in my world. but i guess it will all balance out after a crazy fun filled week of concerts during cmj. woosh!

Maybe you can make use of this time-travel thing by convincing him to change his self- indulgent ways, altering the course of history and preventing his eventual evolution into a scary lizard-man. Unfortunately, just as you are on your way over to talk to him, Mr. Jagger's delivery of cocaine from Bogota unexpectedly arrives, burying you alive in an gigantic avalanche of Colombian blow!You gasp for air in vain in the sea of nose candy. As the cocaine enters your bloodstream and you begin to lose consciousness, you notice the faint but unmistakable melody of Bee Gee's "Night Fever." This is the best nightclub ever!

      OK, I didn't watch the Yankees-BoSox game. I did however learn how to crochet (thanks, shara!!), and I also went to see  urlLink Bishop Allen   last night at the Mercury Lounge. If you didn't know, they changed the lineup a little – put Jack on drums, new girl C.O. on keyboards… I like the new combination a lot. What I find particularly appealing about this group is the fact that they are so full of character and quirks, and write intelligent songs-stories about being young, in the city, in and out of love… with sense of humor and heart. Those are the qualities that charmed me when I first saw them perform in their loft a year ago, and those are the qualities that still bring a smile to my face when I see them now. That and, oh, Justin's hokey pokey dance moves. Adorable! Hehe. And yes, I did love their new song: "Making friends is so damn easy, Just smile and act all pleasing!" Classic.  Bishop Allen were followed by headliners,  urlLink  Metric  . I had to admit I was curious to see what this band was all about because so many people were singing their praises ( urlLink Sarah ,  urlLink Marc ,  urlLink Eric ,  urlLink Jo ). I thought that the lead singer, Emily Haines, had a great voice and an OK stage persona… but then she started acting like she was on drugs -- totally bizarre and high as a satellite. she started doing jump kicks and shoulder twitches and hair flinging and making eyes with  urlLink fans . it was funny, but very distracting. so, in short, I almost liked metric. maybe I have to be on drugs, too, to enjoy it. or at least drizzunk. neither of which I were…  the other night, I inadvertently went to see  urlLink  oxford collapse  . I was hanging out with my friend, saryn, who I haven't seen for ages, and we wandered into lit. I suddenly realized that OxC were playing downstairs, and we went down to watch their set. the boys have a new bassist to replace Yong Sing, though I don't know his name. mike started rockin' out on stage like crazy, as the room sweltered in body heat and cigarette smoke. they were a lot harder than before, and their stage performance has improved quite a bit. if you haven't seen them, they are playing the vicious/crashin'in cmj showcase at sin-e on October 22. go see them, along with  urlLink  mommy and daddy   (8 p.m.).

      another  urlLink  rufus wainwright   album so soon after  want one ? how excellent! expect it possibly in the spring…   Following the release of Poses in 2001, Wainwright hit a personal rock bottom in October 2002 after years of alcohol and pill abuse. He entered rehab and on the last day wrote "Want," a song he says "encapsulates something I realized, which is that it's all about the simple things."   That song helped open the door to a double album that was to bear its name, Want, but due to the record industry's lagging sales, the record was cut in half, leaving Want Two for future release.   "I was listening to it as a double album set," Wainwright says, "but the record company wasn't too keen. And also in listening to all of the stuff, I realized that no human mind is capable of really properly digesting that much overwrought emotion. It was just too much for one sit-down, and I realized that certain things would get lost. I tend to really demand for the listener to pay attention, and I didn't want them passing out."   Wainwright says the songs for the Want albums are among his most autobiographical, addressing subjects including his personal struggles, his show business life and his rocky relationship with his parents (singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle). "I'm not trying to be moralistic or tell other people what they're doing," he says. "I wanted to go down on record, so no matter what happens in the future, I can always look back on this period as a sort of intense journey."  [rolling stone]  from the  urlLink  spiritualized   interview [filter magazine]:   Jason Spaceman is that illuminating science professor who blew your mind and taught you to dream. Jack White is the cuddly but ultimately unstimulating history teacher holed up in his office down the hall, reminding you to memorize all those presidents.   sure, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the French Kicks, Oneida, Rye Coalition, the Ex-Models, The Seconds, The Prosaics, The Narrator, Trans Am, Songs: Ohia, Josh Ritter and Liz Phair all have  urlLink Oberlin connections … and so do Folksongs for the Afterlife. don’t forget them! [freewilliamsburg.com]  a little birdie told me that  urlLink  the stills   are playing a free show with andrew wk at an anti-cmj party by vice at that venue that used to be limelight…   urlLink alexander chats with nick zinner.  hey, where’s that interview you did with kenna??

          urlLink  margaret cho   looked so hot last night. she wore this icecapades-like outfit that was brilliant, sparkling white. she looked so happy. this is her third touring comedy show, and i was happy to be seeing it. i've seen all of them live, starting from "i'm the one that i want" to "notorious c.h.o." and now to "revolution cho." her act has gotten considerably more political and socially conscious, which explains the show name. she talks about social inequalities, racism, crazy recent political events (aka gov. arnold).   she focuses less on the gory sexual details, which was prevalent in "notorious," and more on how we all can start a revolution by recognizing the silly, "sacred" traditions we all have come to accept as normal. marriage does not have to be sacred between just a man and woman. the government shouldn't have to ask you to die for your country, but tell you not to talk about being gay. and my favorite is when people ask you what kind of asian you are ("i can't tell any of you apart!"). marg cho: "uh, why do you have to tell us apart? are we going to be separated and put in internment camps?" i couldn't stop laughing when she said that. it's so true! why DO people have to tell us apart? not even  we  can tell us apart!  she had so many new jokes and interesting perspectives to add to "revolution," which made me happy because a lot of the material in her first two shows overlapped. "revolution" was packed with lots of new material that talks about her more current life experiences, and it's good to see that she's living in the past less and less and enjoying her present more and more.   go,  margaret cho !  her opening act, bruce daniels, was pretty funny too. he talked a lot about the same types of issues -- racism, social inequalities, stereotypes...  marg and bruce and some other chick (can't remember her name) did a rap at the end that wasn't very good, but i had to give her props on her effort. mc mc!

      school of rock the movie is better than most music today, says  urlLink  the lefsetz letter  . [from jon bahr]    damien rice beats out the yyys, cat power, sigur ros, interpol, the streets and more to win the short list prize, the shorty. i didn't  urlLink  damien rice   was  that  unknown. but i suppose it is true he doesn't get played on the radio... yet.  everyone who was nominated played except for the yyys and sigur ros.  Paul Banks, the typically taciturn singer of Interpol, said during the band's set that if he were in the audience, he probably would have considered the show the best he had ever seen.    urlLink eddie izzard gets sexie.

       urlLink groupies vs. music journalists.  [annabiotica]  i was telling the knife skillers this last night, i could never date a musician. all the musicians i've met are self-absorbed and needy. they need you to support their project, but hardly ever is the favor returned. but most of us just need to accept the fact that it's not a two-way street and move on in life as art philanthropists and that music karma will take care of things itself.

      stopped by the mercury lounge to drop off copies of this awesome poster joe made for  urlLink  dirty on purpose  's next show -- they're opening up for  the decemberists  and  earlimart  on oct. 29. i saw modest babs at the merc, and remembered she started working there a few weeks ago. she's totally sweet, smart, and into good music. LOVE her.  dirty is also playing  urlLink vicious  on nov. 18. it's going to be totally hot.  to support some work peeps, i stopped by the sidewalk cafe for the "writers at night" series they have every month... but i was feeling kind of tired and decided to head home da 'burg.   anna was meeting up with fellow  urlLink  knife skillers   fon lin and jerry (turing machine), and so i decided to stop into union pool and say hello. of course, i ended up staying there for a little bit... but i just drank water. we had so much fun despite the weirdly, out-of-place romantic music.  after a lot of research on  urlLink  jason mraz  , i knew that he wore a red and white trucker hat every now and then... so i think i spotted him again at union pool tonight, hanging with some friends. but i'm kind of blind, so i can't be 100% sure. it did look like him a lot.

      i did the jason mraz interview, and he's a lot smaller in person. we were both so tired, we sat at the table and whispered to each other. he was nice enough. he had just gotten his hair styled because he was on the view this morning. michael moore was on it, and some stupid guest host that was on called  bowling for columbine  a staged mockumentary. of course, he got so angry, and an argument ensued. they quickly cut to starr jones who said, "we need some music up in here. stay tuned for jason mraz." hahaha.

       urlLink  kenna  is officially awesome.  i saw him perform last night, and he blew me away! the energy emanating from him and his band was just brilliant. his music reminded me of depeche mode. he told me people have told him he sounds like flock of seagulls on crack. HOT! and he wore a tee shirt for  the kills  on stage and wore  the the  and  johnny cash  pins on his jacket. how fucking cool is that? there were a gaggle of girls from fischerspooner (kenna just finished touring with them) screaming their support for him. i love when bands support each other like that. and outside of the club, kenna complimented my beat up chucks and gave me a big hug! he's my new crush. **sigh**  also i met this R&B artist who was wearing levis pins with  the realistics  and  the boggs . i traded my  dirty on purpose  pin for the boggs. he wouldn't give me the realistics pin because it was all beat up. how funny! i can't wait to start wearing it around. they are fabulous!  congrats to laura for her  urlLink scenester award .

      the other night i met up with george from DoP and we headed over to the knitting factory to support doug marvin (DoP drummer) in his other band  an ideal for living . they completely took me off guard. amazing! i wasn't sure what i thought about the music in the beginning. it seemed kind of all over the place, but in the middle of the first song, it started to take shape and form into this awe-inspiring noisy, experimental set that featured double drumming and intense feedback. doug played both guitar and drums. this guy is such an impressive musician -- creative, dark and unpredictable.  finally saw  urlLink  hula  , too. it was the end of the night and i thought i was going to fall asleep during their set because i had heard it was mellow music... but i was far from sleep. their songs had such cool, groovy beats and notes that were pure and clean -- no distortion, no fancy pedal work, no feedback -- just good, clean music.

There are subtle references to gambling 'n' guns (the four suits in a deck of cards, revolvers held aloft by both black and white hands, and an abstraction of a roulette wheel).

       urlLink  queen latifah  signs to the new cool label, vector recordings.  ken and jack also own the company that handles that really hyped tennessee band,  kings of leon .  their reach is growing so quickly! when i went to the KoL show at the Bowery, I had heard that jack was looking for an assistant at his label. now I know what they were talking about! too bad I like my job and don't want to leave it!  the free  urlLink  dirty on purpose   show at  urlLink grand central bar  went better than we all thought it would. walking into the bar and realizing some people had to play around a pool table is kind of like a big train wreck, but only a band like DoP could pull it off and draw everyone in with their amazing music. it was beautiful. at many points, i didn't even feel like i was deathly sick from my miserable fall cold! oh, how their music warms me... after the show, the band was packing up their equipment and these guys across the street, who were throwing bottles of beer at people who i'm guessing are their enemies, kept yelling, "gentrification! fucking gentrification!" i kept thinking, perhaps these guys should use their anger for better things than throwing beer bottles at people and yelling big words from the  urlLink dictionary . sometimes i hate gentrification too, but i don't go around screaming it in the middle of the night, do i? i mean, i can barely afford to live in my neighborhood, and don't feel like i can move because apartments are so friggin' expensive now in wburg. but i certainly don't go around yelling at every hipster and hipsterette on the street. that's what crazy people do. they also try to kill people by hurling beer bottles. that was kind of scary, yo.  i'm waiting to hear the reports of the realistics show at the bowery from the rest of the bloggerazzi. how was it, gals? what's the good word? i'm sure the boys did a fantastic job of rocking that supercalifragilisticespialidocious venue.

      From our favorite new filmmaker Andrew:  As you probably know, we're up and running on this new film project--   This coming Tuesday, the 7th, we're shooting what will presumably be by far the most complicated scene of this mostly uncomplicated film, a performance scene in which the makeshift supergroup of  urlLink Justin Rice  on guitar + Kevin Micka on drums plays a couple of songs at the Northsix club in Williamsburg. (Where, we are told, they shot a scene for School of Rock...?) 66 N. 6th St., near the Bedford stop on the L. We need extras, folks who look like they might conceivably come out to a rock show. We don't need a lot of folks, Justin + Kevin are supposed to be a pretty underattended opening act.   Most of you have jobs and cannot hang around a rock club from 10am - 5pm on a Tuesday, which is what we need, but if you're considering quitting your job, now would be a good time. What's in it for you, I guess is (a) we buy you lunch + there's some snacks around, (b) the glamour/creative process blah blah blah, (c) you get to see a free concert, sort of, albeit a concert in which the same two songs get played over and over again...It's an adventure, an adventure.   And if you know anyone who you think would be up for this, please do forward this along, I'd appreciate it tremendously.  If you want to do it, e-mail me back asap and let me know. If you can't, no need to respond-- Thanks so very much, Very excited,  Andrew  ***  if anyone is interested,  urlLink email me  and i'll pass your message along!

      while going to see qatsi play last night at pianos, i saw another pretty amazing band called  urlLink  read yellow  . they were throbbing noisy punk rock with lots of sharp guitar licks and hard drum kicks. they are from amherst, mass., and i think they're gonna blow up, considering their next couple shows are with mission of burma and radio 4 -- a pretty impressive move, though i'm not sure their music gels with those bands -- they're much harder. listen for yourself:  urlLink "the association"  and  urlLink "fashion fatale"    urlLink  qatsi   also brought the house down last night. i'm pretty sure dave was playing guitar between some girl's legs at one point. they always bring something a little new to their performance. those guys are awesome. if you haven't heard them, here's a song:  urlLink "City Son"   and i wish i could go to sleep tonight, but there is so much going on!! if anyone is around the east village, they should stop by lit and see  turing machine  -- it will be their last show for quite a while as their bassist is going abroad for a while. justin will be pulling double duty as he will rock and sweat in both  panthers  and  turing machine . that guy is a maniac! oh yeah, there's open bar from 9 to 10.

       vomit launch   urlLink the new york times says that interns are the new hipsters.  every young person in america has at one point or another heard that getting an internship is a valuable and necessary way to get ahead. it is all about the people you know and the hands-on experience you have. when i was in school, i certainly took that to heed and did a bunch of internships. looking back, i think that all meant horseshit. not to say that my times at some of those major magazines, non-profits and other miscellaneous organizations weren't valuable at all, but they just don't mean much anymore. i just think about them fondly as experiences i had a long time ago.    so how were they valuable? all of those experiences cannonballed and led me to my current aspirations as less a writer and more a behind the scenes type in the music industry. working at major magazines made me realize that i don't like writing about things that are huge and commercial. and i don't really care about fashion and beauty as much as i enjoy  urlLink making fun of it . my enjoyment lies in the indie culture that is unfortunately fast becoming huge and commercial enough to be written about in the new york times.    that kind of commercialization makes me shy away from professing my love for bands like the strokes and pavement, and instead, professing my love for  urlLink smaller, up-and-coming bands . i get a rush from trying to change and grow with my community. thinking of ways to improve the community that is soon in danger of imploding on itself. it's like how malkmus said in the slow century documentary on pavement when their videos started spinning on mtv and a wholly different group of kids started coming to their shows. the fans and the band started to diverge, making gigs less enjoyable. suddenly they were playing for kids at lollapalooza, getting booed and mud thrown at them. hopefully living in the new york indie community won't become less enjoyable with its recent commercialization.

       tim harrington is getting married!   urlLink omigod  from  urlLink catherine's pita    Met: May 1999 Engaged: Jan. 26, 2003 Projected Wedding Date: July 3, 2004  When Tim Harrington’s future mother-in-law first saw him perform in his punk-rock band, Les Savy Fav, she had a most unmother-in-lawish reaction. "She was like, ‘He’s the Messiah!’" said his fiancée, Anna Schwebel.   "She’s European," Mr. Harrington explained—specifically, Swedish. A Web designer by day, he makes an impressive sight onstage, jumping around half-naked with his bushy golden beard and bristling eyebrows to match. "I like to examine space," he said.  Ms. Schwebel, 28, an abstract painter who works under her mother’s maiden name, Killander, first saw him perform at Tramps (a pal of hers was dating the band’s scruffy drummer). "I was just like, ‘Yeah, he’s a kooky guy. Whatever,’" she said. But Mr. Harrington, 29, was quickly smitten by the cherubic, ponytailed blonde, a Columbia grad. "I thought she was stone-cold fox," he said.  They became friendly, and when Mr. Harrington had an empty spot in a five-person share in Williamsburg, Ms. Schwebel moved in. Ah, la vie bohème …. Mr. Harrington, simmering with desire, would sing Bad Company’s guttural "Feel Like Making Love" around the apartment, hoping she’d take the hint. But she remained oblivious until this woman Ivy began calling the house for him. Turned out Ivy was every New York woman’s nightmare: a gorgeous Rockette. "I got really jealous," Ms. Schwebel said. "I hadn’t understood how great he was, but then one day I woke up and was like, ‘Oh! Oh my God, I’m in love with Tim!’"   They began sharing a loft bed, eventually moving to a private apartment in a Williamsburg townhouse, and it sounds like they’re having a wild time behind closed doors. "He’s really good at pretending to be animals. Really good," Ms. Schwebel said. "Like Gorillas and tigers. And lions, too!" Grrrrr.   Mr. Harrington consulted his female kinfolk for advice on how to propose. "They gave me all these cockamamie ideas—straight from the WB," he said. "And I did them all."  But the chunky diamond ring he ordered was all wrong. "It was like it belonged to the Bride of Frankenstein," he said.  And the week before they jetted off on a surprise trip to Paris, Ms. Schwebel broke her wrist snowboarding.  Dying to get the damn thing over with, Mr. Harrington dropped to one knee in the middle of the night at a Rive Gauche hotel when she slipped out of bed for some water, offering up the ugly ring and promising he’d replace it with a nicer one later. Ms. Schwebel responded by erupting in giggles.   They’ll be married at an inn near her family’s country house in Vermont. The bride will wear a Reem Acra gown she got from a sample sale and a new rose-gold ring with 10 small diamonds. The groom is writing a love song for the reception—something along the lines of "We’ll Make a Lover Out of You," Les Savy Fav’s only existing love song. "It’s about how we have enough love," he said, "so that everyone else can get some of it, too." Groovy, man.

       there's no place like texas  i found out today that i will be heading to  urlLink  sxsw   next year. of course, i will be working a lot of that time, but i will also have the opportunity to party a lot and see lots of great shows for free. the more i think about it, the more i'm getting excited about it. hopefully,  urlLink  dirty on purpose   will join me. the band is getting ready to record some more songs this month, and we're all as excited as can be! everything seems to be moving smoothly, and everyone's working very hard.    vicious night   dop's performance at  urlLink  vicious   was good. i was nervous before they went on stage, but after the music began, all of my nerves melted. their songs washed over the crowded room like a blissful breeze of pretty atmospheric notes that shimmered. the set list was really exciting. they debuted a new song called "mind blindness," and then they followed it with a kick-ass version of "monument." i feel like they get stronger and stronger every time i see them. they probably won't have another show lined up until mid to late january, so to tie you over, buy a dop cd from  urlLink  truthflies.com  .    i was also impressed by  urlLink  scout  's performance. they had catchy songs that build nicely into poppy rock songs. i liked ashen keilyn's husky vocals and her tomboyish vibe won me over. i still have their song "before you" in my head. it's on their website if you want to listen to it! oh yeah, and boy could that guitarist do high kicks!    urlLink  ps   were also quite good, though their set felt really long. i really liked their one song that had the lyrics, "i used to think you had a sense of humor." don't know the title of that one... that sensitive song stood out the most to me, but overall ps gave off a thom yorke-ian vibe that was less technical and full, but still really cool and heartfelt. i heard they used to have a cellist, and perhaps the music would have sounded more full with some strings.     urlLink  aerial love feed   also performed with their strobe lights and sunglasses intact. they definitely have a placebo vibe, complete with rock star poses and haircuts. their music throbs and bounces off the walls, but it's not really the kind of thing i'm into, though i think technically they're a good band. sometimes i don't know why i am attracted to  urlLink some bands  more than  urlLink others . music is mysterious in that way. there's something inside of us all that draws us to different chords, different lyrics, different intonations. and that's why being in a band is such a gamble these days. who knows what will work and what won't?   however, the rocks, a highly charged band from london, apparently is fairly confident that rockin' out, jumping on bars and falling off the stage is what they want to do. though i wouldn't say their music was overwhelmingly brill, their performance was quite outstanding and fun to watch. it certainly made me whoop and holler. it also seemed like most of their cohorts (including the lovely miss vivian from mommy and daddy) were in the audience supporting their english buddies. also the girl in the band had these phosphorescent yellow heels paired with royal blue stockings -- all with a dress that had the poofiest sleeves ever. joe, dj, erika, jenna, jason and i had dinner at the pink pony with the band's bassist who was very nice and charming. dj lent him some bass stuff (i know, very specific, eh?) and joe lent their guitarist some guitar stuff, and the band was quite happy to play with dop's equipment. i didn't mean that in a dirty way. haha. anyways, the bassist was leaving back for england the next day and couldn't play with the rocks at plaid, so vivian was subbing on bass for them. the drummer also couldn't play at plaid and kevin from on!air!library! had to sub on bass for them. anyone go to that show?   throughout the night  urlLink dennis realistic  played the best list of songs ever. he played the ronettes with the raveonettes and the realistics with old school kylie minogue. and the best new strokes song - "the end has no end." so good! dennis is always full of energy and is the biggest sweetheart always. he also donned a tres cool fedora. love that boy.

       from the darkness to enlightenment   seems like these days, everyone likes  urlLink the darkness . me? i'm not sure. i'm too busy trying to understand why all of a sudden everyone thinks bands that sound like  urlLink those hair bands that my heavy metal boyfriend listens to  are suddenly considered the next big thing after the death of electroclash and the slowdown of post-no-new-wave. granted, i do dig the justin hawkins' falsetto, wavering voice, and i do like "i believe in a thing called love" and "love is only a feeling." jesus, am i starting to like  urlLink the same bands  as my boyfriend??? this is freaking me out.  on a different note altogether, someone sent me this  urlLink scary link .

       kurt cobain comic book   The book combines biographical fact with a bit of fiction (perhaps it'll give readers a nice version of Courtney Love?), and chronicles everything from Cobain's childhood and Nirvana's rise to fame to the tortured frontman's suicide in 1994. The cover features a beefier-looking Cobain with angel wings, which should incite curiosity as to what his Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl and Krist Novaselic's cartoon alter-egos look like (one can only hope that they'll be clad in skin-baring leather loincloths).

       the strokes of art    i actually found myself reading the liner notes and fine print on  the strokes  CD. i was curious to find lyrics in the cover (d'oh, you'd think i'd look for those first), and yes, in fact, julian casablancas again wrote the words and music of all the songs, save one -- "automatic stop" -- which apparently everyone's favorite curly-haired guitarist albert hammond helped pen.   i was looking for the cover art credit -- and i was surprised to find that one of the inside artworks was by german artist  urlLink  anselm kiefer  . go figure! i remember going to the met to see a kiefer exhibit in connection to my german film class. beautiful dream-like images that were endearing in the seeming gentle glide of each stroke.

       winter makes me numb  i'm not sure if it's this winter weather or the fact that i go out every night that makes me so tired. are you feeling like that too? i am finding it very hard to kick myself out of bed in the morning, but once i am up, i am ok. it's just those few seconds when my alarm beckons that i am ferociously exhausted.   anyhoo, i stopped by  urlLink product shop nyc 's first  dead hookers social reading club  last night, and it was a really great lineup. i was there to see dan kennedy, who i think is one talented, funny mofo. he was funnier last time i saw him read, but not less talented. before him, there was a newbie reader named randy stulberg, who i found out is a friend of scott. she wasn't bad for her first reading, but stumbled here and there. she definitely has the potential to grow as she becomes more confident. i wanted to stay to hear marc spitz and jonathan ames, but had to head over to some other commitments...  then jenna and i jettisoned over to mercury lounge to see  urlLink  aeon spoke  , a band i think is from california, play. they were very atmospheric and moody, but i felt that they were a little too spiritual or over-the-top emotional -- if that makes any sense. however, the crowd there loved it. jasper will be sad he missed their very pretty girl bassist! be on the lookout, jasp. the band was like radiohead but with more whispery vocals.  later i finally met alexander (not andrew) laurence. he was really nice and knows a lot about music so it was fun to go back and forth with him for a little bit. he was heading over to tonic, and i was hungry so we parted ways. chatted a little with yannick and bill jr at sin-e. i actually missed talking to them. they're such nice peeps! afterwards, i walked jenna to sidewalk cafe where she was going to see ian thomas. i headed for home and ran into daniel from  urlLink  circle and square   (i run into him everywhere!). we talked for a bit, and he told me C&S would be performing at the knitting factory soon. later closer to my subway i ran into steven mertens, who had been on tour with adam green. he was leaving agan to tour with another band that i can't remember the name of... (a.m. something?). anyhoo, it's good to see all my peeps so busy and making music and touring and being so happy!

       cover me  yesterday was the night of covers in the basement of north six. it was dingy down there, and someone was sucking on tea tree oil toothpicks (mmm, minty fresh!) and some band was practicing very loudly in the rehearsal space. plus, the sound in the basement was terrible, but we were all there to support and have some fun...  first  urlLink  the debutantes  , a gothy raveonettes in stereo, sang the go-gos "our lips are sealed." their own songs were cute and spunky. the lead singer definitely had a belinda carlisle-esque voice that was nice to listen to. they had two guitars and drums and were rocking out. some of their songs kind of sounded the same, but i think this band is still evolving nicely...   then  urlLink  kudzu wish  , a les savy fav-ish group from athens, ga, sang "web in front" by archers of loaf. god how i love that song.  "all i ever wanted was to be your spine!"  the lead singer hung by his feet from the rafters (very tim harrington, eh?). then he fell off and landed on his head!! that has gotta hurt. yow. also this band used a cowbell in one of their songs!    '64 World's Fair , composed of annie and sung bin with doug dop sitting in on drums, covered the pixies' "gigantic." because the sound was so bad, i couldn't hear the vocals too well but i know they sang songs about how beer is better than soda and thomas the tank engine. yeah!! i was so tired and didn't stay for the last band,  urlLink " target="new"> the winter pageant  , but i hear they are good. will catch them next time!

       detroit rock city  went to detroit unexpectedly last week for work, but i was siked to go and check out detroit rock city. i had never been before, and i found it kind of dirty, but dirty isn’t necessarily bad. unfortunately, i don’t think i got the proper tour of the city, and as a result, my impression of the area lacked. i was staying at a hotel in downtown detroit, where there were hardly any restaurants, though we eventually found a german biergarten that had decent burgers.   i was helping with a sold-out (free) showcase sponsored by ascap and heineken  at detroit’s independent rock venue, the magic stick, featuring some of detroit’s up-and-coming bands: the detroit cobras, the paybacks, the detroit city council (members of the dirtbombs), and even the odd.    the detroit cobras  had a singer who had a stevie nicks vibe going on from her streams of long hair to her throaty voice. the band could do down and dirty rock ‘n roll to soulful gospel.  the paybacks  had a singer with andy warhol hair and a massively wild personality to go along with it. the crowd ate her up. her band was quite good drawing from all-over-the-place 70s stoner rock ‘n roll, but i didn’t really dig the singer’s voice (though it wasn’t bad, just not my thang). i kept thinking that if the paybacks’ band teamed up with the singer of the detroit cobras, they would be amazing. something to think about.    the detroit city council  had a total bluesy, motown feel to their music – something you’d expect from a band composed of members of the dirtbombs. one of the guys in the band (can’t remember his name) was responsible for founding kid rock and eminem. the lead singer had this chubby bono thing going on, and he kept shuffling around the stage like james brown. quite entertaining.  even the odd  were a harder band with screaming vocals and more deafening music. again, not really my thing, but they weren’t terrible. while this was going on in the main part of the magic stick, there was hardcore slam dancing going on downstairs!   the band room was gross with lude graffiti all over the walls. it stank of vomit and cigarettes. but there was a stellastarr* sticker in the midst of all the ugliness. how funny! at one point, i was in the room, and it was full of groupies. i was rolling up one of the banners, and one of the groupies threw her beer bottle across the room at me. it shattered against the wall (damn the free heinekens!), and i didn't react at all. i just finished rolling up my banner and left. the room was silent. i think they were amazed that i didn't react at all. c'mon, kiddie, flying beer bottles don't faze us new york rockers. plus, i don't have to sleep with a band to be their friend! haha!   the magic stick , i think, is like the mercury lounge or bowery ballroom of detroit. the space fits about 800 people, and has pool tables, bowling lanes, food and video games to occupy you in case you don’t like the music on stage. the night before our showcase the rapture played. i looked on the schedule and in the near future the shins and james chance will be passing through…  overall, i think that detroit really wasn’t my scene, though i adore  pas/cal  who are from detroit. tried to get in touch with caz while i was in town but wasn’t able to reach him. it’s not meant to be! maybe next time i’ll get a proper tour of detroit through the eyes of pas/cal. is it hipper than i think it is?

       three time's a charm    i saw  urlLink  the walkmen   three times on saturday night. so much fun in so little time. thank you, ham, paul, pete, matt, walt. you rock.  le sigh.   i have a review of the night written up for  urlLink  PopMatters  . i'll post the link once it is live. so yeah, now i've started to write concert reviews for PopMatters. now i actually have a "real" reason to go to lots and lots of shows and cover all those bands that  NEVER  get covered. however, please don't ask me to review your band. i only want to write reviews when i feel compelled to write one.  by the way, i love how british sea power (aka that band that sounds like david bowie) start "fear of drowning" --  "jesus fucking christ, oh god no"  -- that is the best lyrical start to a song to date and i can't stop playing it on repeat repeat repeat. it perfectly reflects my mood lately.

       happy new year!   DoP finished up in the studio last night and we went over to antique lounge for some celebratory drinks. so much fun! the jukebox was wonderful. during van halen's "jump" a group of two guys and a girl started strutting their stuff. one guy gave the girl quite a lap dance while us jerks whooped and hollered. then antique lounge closed up and we headed for greenpoint tavern. that joint was closed too. in desperation we went to the abbey, and surprisingly to me, they were open. we sat down and joe was ridiculously drunk by that point, playing pool with thugs and hippies from the nabe. greg also played pool with the thugs and on his last shot, looked the thug in the eye, and fucking made the shot. that's some cool as pool playing right there, dude.

       s-s-studio    spent hours and hours in the studio with  urlLink  dirty on purpose  . they are recording a new EP for release early next year. it's going to be hawt. fucking hot! if you haven't voted for that suicide girls contest,  urlLink please vote for dop now ! scroll down to new york city, and then vote for dop, the second band over. the cut off for votes is december 31.    i also went to see the  urlLink  dresden dolls   at joe's pub. they were amazing. i was in jaw-dropping awe as their magnificent sound filled the room -- which incidentally was packed to the brim. this is an amazing feat if you consider that they were the only band on the bill and the cover was $12. the band sounded 10 times better than they did at mercury lounge. the acoustics at joe's pub were mindblowing. i won't say too much here because i want to review the show for  urlLink popmatters , but let's just say i was enthralled. anyhoo, jenna and i also ran into  urlLink daniel and robin , as well as glenn and yuki of  urlLink  asobi seksu  . there was an entire boston contingent at the show, which i am only connected to by jenna. she's da bomb, yo.

       aw shucks  so much has been going on the past few weeks that i feel like i haven't had a chance to breathe. i took today off from work to do just that. breathe. i guess today is my day to get my shit together a little. the holidays are such a drain. work has been crazy as well, but i like that better than having downtime. if you haven't noticed, i like to keep busy.   this time of year is also a time for reflection and correction. that whole new year's resolution. i always make one or two or three, and then sometime in the middle of the year, i forget i made any. typical.   there are certain things i'd love to accomplish: build a higher tolerance to alochol so i'm not puking in some restaurant on the steps like a crazy person. hmmm, that'd be lovely.   other things i'd like to accomplish: meet colin firth and fall madly in love and he'd leave his wife and his kids for  me ... oh wait, wife and kids? scratch that. alimony is a bitch.  another accomplishing thought: read more books on the subway coming home from a rock show when i'm either tired or buzzed or both... oh wait, lately i've been terribly wasteful and taking cabs back to wburg, so nevermind. maybe i should try to stop doing that and instead invest said money to smoke more cigarettes.  sounds like i'm going to have to think more about this.

       wha tha?  geez, where the hell have i been? yesterday i had been drinking since like 1 p.m. it was a day of holiday party after holiday party after holiday party. i totally lost my cookies at virgil's for my work's departmental holiday dinner. that was after 4 glasses of bubbly. i shoulda slowed down the pace because then i had to go to  urlLink another holiday party  and i was just such a wuss. my head was aching and i couldn't find any water! go figure. just more alcohol. so shortly after greeting several of some  urlLink lovely   urlLink lovely   urlLink lovely  peeps, i bid adieu and cabbed it home.   the other weekend, i saw anna's band  urlLink knife skills . the only word to describe them is BADASS. they are fucking badass. with all of their practicing and rehearsing and recording, they fucking ruled that small sin-e stage, and seemed destined for bigger halls of music. anna's vicious vocal and guitar skills. fon lin's sexy voice and basslines. jerry's machine gun drums. watch out, people. you have no idea!  at some point i also went to see my friend miker's jokey robert palmer cover band, dr. doctor, and it was fun times singing along to those songs. i kind of wish that they were dressed up with slicked back hair and red lipstick. that would have been fucking hawt. isaac kept playing songs by people like crystal waters ("she's just like you and me but she's homeless!") and jody watley?? ("real love! i'm searching for a real love!") i found out last night that i had missed brian long's set at the startime holiday party. he was the first DJ, but i'm sure i'll catch him another time.  oh and for those of you who missed the panthers show at "the lounge" the other night (me included), paris hilton and seth green was there. woopty-doo. i hope she was at least flashing people and saying, "i'm not spoiled."  jesus, i honestly don't remember what else i've been doing. i know there was something else that i did? please feel free to remind me.

       will fill in the blanks soon    ok so the other night i went to the vector holiday party at joe's pub with daniel -- he plays drums in  urlLink circle and square  and also works for  urlLink inland empire . i met him way back when i booked his band and the boggs for those "on the moon" shows. anywho, we walk into joe's pub and lo and behold there are waiters walking around with trays of alcohol. it's the kind of party where you don't even have to ask for alcohol. it's right in front of you! so as soon as we walk in, i grab a glass of red wine. 10 minutes later, i see a guy walking past me with a tray of tequila shots. i grabbed one. then 10 minutes later, he came by again, and yes, i grabbed another one. by this time i was really trashed. damien rice, who is on vector records, was supposed to perform at the party. daniel and i only caught one song -- but i heard the rest of the night was simply amazing... will have to check out damien rice again.   so daniel says he has an extra spot on the guest list for the rapture show that night because someone canceled at the last minute. on our way to bowery, we ran into a guy who was dressed up as tony clifton -- the alter ego of andy kaufman. daniel started calling his name, and so i joined in. we didn't expect the guy to actually come over, but he did. i took the photo above to capture the moment. as we continued on to bowery, i was worried that i wouldn't get into the rapture show. but as it turned out, we didn't even have to check at the list because we were waved in. how awesome is that? i wasn't planning on attending this series of nights at the bowery ballroom, but i was intoxicated and it was free, so why not? we arrive, and i see miss melody nelson et al faithfully in the front, as we (we also met up with another c&s dude, ed) made our way to the middle. the rest of the night was kind of a blur of dancing bodies, but i remember being amazed that the rapture had improved so much since i had seen them at irving plaza. wowzers.    damien rice, with yes, the worst sweater in the world, performing earnestly at joe's pub. whatever, i still love his music, despite the fact that he obviously needs a stylist.    some other night, i also caught  urlLink the winter pageant , who actually impressed me with their great live show. i was only there for three songs, but i distinctly remember loving, "daggers and nails," a song that i was disappointed to find was NOT on the CD i have. record this ditty and send it to me, mike! the band filled the small luna lounge space, and people were totally into it.       i also met up with bsiii for the second time in my life at a bar/lounge called happy ending. it was so weird because i felt like i was at some kind of underground fashion show and there was a runway of some sorts with the strip of space between the band and the booths. very fashionably conscious people were strutting down that strip, workin' it harder than missy elliott. bsiii had described cousin to me as "steely dan meets radiohead." this was not aan accurate description. they were like some kind of neo jazz ensemble -- i didn't get the whole radiohead reference, but i suppose it was because the singer's voice was kind of high like thom yorke's. i can't remember at the moment, but the band had kind of wack, pseudo-funny song titles... though i could totally picture myself listening to that music on a quiet wednesday night of sorts...

       awards awards awards   urlLink in case you didn't know, the grammy nominations were announced today.  someone told me this is the first year the grammys have had the "best alternative music album" category, of which nominees include:  Fight Test   The Flaming Lips  [Warner Bros. Records]    Hail To The Thief   Radiohead  [Capitol Records]    Untitled   Sigur Rós  [Fat Cat/MCA Records]    Elephant   The White Stripes  [V2/ThirdMan Records]    Fever To Tell   Yeah Yeah Yeahs  [Interscope Records]   wow, can you believe the yeah yeah yeahs got a grammy nomination? that's a fucking huge step for indie kind. i don't really consider the other music "alternative."  maybe  sigur ros... out of those people though, i think the flaming lips have the tightest album. word!  i also attended the deems taylor awards yesterday. i thought it was pretty interesting. that  spin  editor, sia, was there. the deems taylor awards honor writers who cover music in journalism and books. i missed the first half of the awards ceremony, but i found that most of the awards went to blues and jazz genre writers. it was cool though that  urlLink allmusic.com  received an award. i never knew that the whole allmusic.com operation is based in michigan, though they have 600 writers who contribute. the a&e show  urlLink "live by request,"  which was produced by tony bennett and his son, danny, also received an award. that's a show where the big names in music take requests from their fans via phone or email, and many times they actually interact with their listeners. people who have been on the show thus far include bowie, elton john, elvis costello, tony bennett (of course), gloria estefan, etc. sometimes, even other stars phone in, just to rag on the featured guest. i've never seen this show... but now i'm interested in seeing it.

       braving the cold    lately i've been in complete hibernation mood. i've been totally repulsed by this biting cold weather, and have retreated to the warmth of my apartment and lots of carnivale and da ali g show on HBO on Demand. the key word is "comfort." but every once in a while, i can be compelled to leave the comfort of my home and venture out... like when bishop allen play a show.   yes, i went to see  urlLink  bishop allen   tonight at sin-e. this was the first time i saw them without bonnie, their former bassist. they put C.O. on bass duty now and have no keyboardist and no main female singer. if you are adept at the keyboard and have a sweet voice, please email them and try out for the band! they write catchy pop/rock/alt-country tunes that charm my socks off. it sounds like they are still trying to figure out how to transition with the absence of bonnie, but the essence of the band is still intact in both the new and old songs. i am still giddy as a school girl when i hear them play "quarter to three." i really liked the new song that they started to play but never finished, "remember monday."    side note: yannick got a cute new hair cut!    starfoods, oh how i love thee    afterwards, rachel and i headed over to  urlLink  starfoods   -- just like old times! starfoods has the best comfort food in this city. there is no doubt about that. and they have the most handsome, nicest staff i've ever met. the owner, byron, greeted us with hugs and then he brought us champagne with casis on the house! i was so excited. i love me some bubbly, but this drink is beyond DIVINE. it's my new official new fave, and i may be wandering back to starfoods every weekend just to have one. byron, you got me hooked!!! then while the cars were blasting from the speakers, i had a fabulous grilled cheese with tomato soup that left my tongue craving for more and more. i was so stuffed though because i also gobbled down the star-shaped buttermilk biscuits that were freshly baked warm from the oven. then byron and our delightful waiter adrian surprised us again with free dessert. i was completely in shock. could my tastebuds handle more goodness? they brought us an ice cream sundae with caramel and chocolate syrup AND a banana pudding with vanilla wafers and whipped cream. it was fucking decadent as hell. i felt like i had won the comfort food lottery. thanks starfoods! and thanks for playing the new rapture album! if you haven't been to this place yet, you must go and check it out. it is the best cure for the winter blues.  OH AND HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY,  urlLink MIKE D !! YOU LEGAL BASTARD.

       wowee zowee!    thanks to everyone who came out last to the mercury lounge to see  urlLink  dirty on purpose  . the turn out was overwhelming! i saw many familiar faces and  tons  of new faces! the band was on first, and had the biggest crowd -- their performance was simply illuminating (not that i'm biased or anything...) but my high spirits were confirmed by several people who came up to me afterwards. it's so nice when you get immediate feedback like that. it's too bad the band didn't get to play "mind blindness," one their new ones that just consumes you, but their performance exploded into wild gusto when they ended with crowd favorite, "monument." i couldn't stay still. i was dancing and just drowning in the intense musical finale.  i love dop, not only for their good music, but they're just awesome people. they're good natured and appreciate everything that comes their way. they love their fans. they love their peeps. they love music. it makes all of the work i do for them extremely rewarding. it sounds a little sappy, but that's the truth, ruth. hanging with them at practice and recording and just hanging out is time i never feel i've wasted because i get so much back. a special thanks to dop!  also another thing i'd like to announce: DoP's first EP is officially sold out at  urlLink truthflies.com ! thanks to all who purchased a copy. i think truthflies.com will be taking pre-orders of DoP's second CD at some point. we'll let you know when it all goes down. i also did get ed from truthflies to come to the show (granted it was after the band went on) to sell me a walkmen  bows and arrows  cd. word! you know i'll be buying a bunch of copies of that on the official release date to give to my peeps.    anyhoo, while we were hanging around the mercury lounge's downstairs band room, a small, smoky space covered with graffiti and band stickers, we got to know the guys from  urlLink  swell  . they were ultra nice, and we were all siked to see them on the lineup. their music had a wonderful groove to it that was more laid-back than dop's set. it was music that just made you say, "yeah this shit is coool." extra "o" intended. i really liked them and look forward to seeing them again soon! they have an upcoming show with the wrens at sarah lawrence, so if you missed them this time, you can check them out again soon!    i was seeing  urlLink  the blondes, inc.    last night for the second time. what's immediately striking about this band is their look. they had really cool lighting that came up from the stage floor. they were going to put up their signature black-and-white polka-dotted curtain, but at some point decided against it. i think this was a good move. instead of the audience focusing on their stage set up, they were focusing more on the music. the result is rewarding because i completely disagreed with the village voice review that the blondes don't play good music. their music is a throwback to the old school. and i saw many girls swaying their hips like they were at a rolling stones concert or something.  tonight i'm going to see  urlLink  the go station  , a band i've been hearing many good things about. they're playing tiswas with  urlLink  aerial love feed  . i've never seen them live before, but you should come check them out with me...

       +1 +1 +1 +1  the launch of jonny kaps' new company,  urlLink +1 Management and PR  last night at don hill's was crazy packed. it was difficult to maneuver through the crowd that was shuffling about with their discounted vodka drinks. i walked into the venue as  inouk  was on stage. i liked what little i heard as i headed back to the coat room, an arduous task that took longer than it should have. i'd have to see them again to really formulate a solid opinion.  my spirits were high , and i couldn't help but break into lots of smiles. later  ambulance ltd  took the stage and impressed me. they've gotten a lot better since i last saw them -- and as you know they also have a new keyboard player. there were definitely parts of songs i liked better recorded than live, but they were tight overall. marcus' voice was also stronger.   on tv screens in the bar,  stellastarr*  videos were playing on a loop as if to foreshadow to their "surprise" performance. they took the stage, looking exactly how i remembered them the last time i saw them. they started out with "in the walls" -- those opening guitar parts are always so engaging and ominous of a spectacular performance. i'm not sure what it was, but i think they sounded better at don hill's than in any other venue i've seen them in (funny, because don hill's is the first venue i saw them in). it was like they had come full circle in my eyes. the crowd exploded when they began to play the anthemic single, "my coco." it was good to see that people that weren't that impressed with their recorded stuff, were impressed with their live performance. i always think of stellastarr* as a band that is fun to watch live because guitarist michael jurin will undoubtedly be writhing on the floor in dramatic flails as will lead singer shawn christensen. the drummer arthur kremer also broke out into his trademark barechests, with his trademark asterick nipple. he's probably the most entertaining performer to watch on stage because his personality is so pronounced. bassist amanda tannen also seems like her stage presence has improved, her stance on stage seems to have more hamony with the other members than it had in the past.

       killing penguins is not cool    urlLink penguins penguins penguins  click on the penguins and play the game... the trick is to get the penguin to slide when it lands on the snow. you get more distance. i got 530 ft.   don't let your co-workers see you playing this game. it will give them nightmares. in fact, it gives me nightmares. and maybe it will give jo divestar nightmares. you know how we both adore penguins.   i wonder who created this sick game? i have to confess, it's damn fun. it's damn addictive. and i love the "whee." i don't think i can write enough crap to fill this space on the side of the picture. oh well. deal with it!  penguins! penguins! penguins!  ok i'm done now. sorry about that. i'm loony for penguins.

       vaz + the amber smith  on the same night i saw the unicorns play, i saw  vaz  for the second time and the amber smith for the first time. i remember being really impressed with vaz the first time i saw them play with knife skills back in the days when luxx was still a cool rock venue. the lead singer, paul, is a sweaty agile performer who spits frequently and attacks the mic viciously. so much fun to watch. i became fascinated with just staring at him and his wild, but strong performance. whoa. his drummer was like a crazy homeless person with severe schizophrenia. his head would swivel wildly like he was having a seizure. i'd be caught staring helplessly at him, too. then suddenly his eyes would rise from the drums and quickly fall back down. it was rather scary. and i liked it.   the amber smith  were the exact opposite. not scary. not threatening. their music had a cheerful tone. it reminded me of the strokes meets  that thing you do!  i swear. one singer sang while chewing gum and playing guitar at the same time. the other singer looked a bit like michael ian black, kind of. some people describe them as a girly version of the strokes. i basically agree except that some of their lyrics were on the sarcastic, snide side (which turned out to be their saving grace) -- i think one of their song lyrics were "i'm having an affair with your girlfriend." if there wasn't that iota that makes them stand out from other poppy rock bands, i would say they were good but nothing special. in this case, they might grow into quite a catchy band if they work on charisma and diversity in tempo and pitch.

       we're the unicorns and we're people too   urlLink    even though it was snowing, i went with deron and anna to southpaw (they drove) to see  urlLink  the unicorns   play at southpaw. one of the first things out of one of the unicorns' mouth was, "this show is so much better than last night. pianos sucks." hmmm, i heard it was crazyfest! but let me tell you, southpaw was jampacked with people, and y'all know that venue is a pretty big size. the buzz was'a buzzing.   urlLink CHECK OUT THE PHOTO GALLERY !!   also check out real player video clips of the unicorns: *  urlLink unicorns 1  *  urlLink unicorns 2  *  urlLink unicorns 3  *  urlLink unicorns 4   i'm writing up a formal review on popmatters.com, but my overall impression of the unicorns was first amusement, pleasant surprise to later yawn-eriffic to then amused again to confused to amused to physically tired of watching their "grody roadie" dance around spitting beer, throwing condoms all in a unicorn uniform. all in all a good show, but way too long. however, there was some kylie thrown in there. laura will love that. thank god they didn't do "hey ya." aren't we getting tired of people covering outkast? maybe not.  right before the unicorns we ran into susan. she said that she liked the unicorns after seeing them at mercury lounge. i was kind of surprised, but after i saw them, i felt the same way. i also met doug who books at lit, does version city records, blah blah blah. he was nice. his label is putting out the amber smith cd... i also saw  vaz  and  the amber smith  but i'll talk about them in a separate post...

       boys, inform me     photo: rachel lovinger   i had this incredible post about  the shins  show at the mercury lounge and blogger ate it up. argh! here's the short version:   starfoods , nila wafer banana pudding, mac and cheese, bourbon and chocolate pecan pie, i heart byron who is a total sweetheart every time!   todd barry  +  the shins  is funnier than  david cross  +  the strokes . i was skeptical about the whole comedy before rock thing, but todd barry pulled it off.    tigers and monkeys  had jeff from  sea ray  in it. incredible female singer. surprisingly gutsy... we'll have to see how they develop. jeff plays the drums standing up!  roland, ok = awesome the shins = awesome  the last time i saw the shins was at siren fest a couple years ago. they were just OK back then. so i had medium expectations this year... jeez, was i blown away. their performance at the mercury lounge was dynamic... almost explosive at times. the guitars and keyboards were jacked up and LOUD. it was nice to see the keyboards showcased a little more. they are kind of buried in the recording, and that marty kind of goes wild on stage. NICE showmanship! james mercer was kind of the logical foil to his wild antics. his voice was so much better this time, really crisp and that sweet ring of his vocals was heightened and really made the songs pop. they sang all the usual suspects from the old and new album -- no  flake  songs, much to rachel's dismay. rachel can tell you why they are reluctant to play flake songs.   what is roland, ok?  the city and state where the shins got arrested for pot and drug paraphanelia. marty seems very bitter about this and kept making mary jane jokes throughout the set. he was a hoot to watch...  people i saw and talked to: jeff from sea ray, eric from  say hi to your mom , dawn, noah from  sam champion , daniel from  circle and square  -- he pinched my cheek (the one on my face) like i was an infant, todd barry, rachel, justin and c.o. from  bishop allen , jo divestar who told me the latest shins video had penguins in it!!  people i wished i talked to: david cross (i hope he smokes everyone in celebrity poker showdown!) watch it tuesday on bravo. james mercer and marty... all i would have been able to say woulda been something dorky like, "uh i really thought you guys were great."

       hammin' it up  i am going to be interviewing hamilton of  urlLink the walkmen  on monday over the phone. i'm prayin' he won't be surly towards me. i don't know why he still intimidates me. maybe it's the perpetual scowl on his face or his considerable height. the new walkmen album is DOPE. it's so weird to be hearing the songs on a CD though because i've been hearing them live for so frickin' long. but i likes it.

       some more shows     urlLink  the stills   have added a second night at the bowery ballroom for jan. 29. it's a special bbc 1 broadcast and is 16+ for the kiddies. there might be a possibility that i'll be giving away a pair of tickets to the show so stay tuned. are they playing before or after  the killers ? i just saw that ultragrrrl posted on her site that the killers were gonna play the bowery on the same date...  while perusing, i see that  the von bondies  are coming to the bowery ballroom on feb. 25. hope those bruises have healed, jason. ouch.   the national  have been added to the bill for the feb. 21  elefant  bowery show, too. does anyone else think that's kind of a strange combination? on one end you have kind of dark serious music with smart introspective lyrics, and on the other, well... you know. let's not kid ourselves. he's hot but nowhere near deep.

       many good things to come    woo boy, i've been swamped at work and wasn't able to update at all for the past couple days. day-am! after whooping some ass in an intense game of scrabble, i headed over to sin-e with jenna to see  urlLink  au revoir simone   for the second time in 7 days. let me tell you, i really love the concept of this band. to create a band that revolves around keyboards is simply awesome. and three keyboards, no less! i can tell erika, annie, sung bin and heather are heading in the right direction. their songs are pretty and hip. i really enjoyed the instrumentals (just like  urlLink jenna  did), and there were a couple songs with super-soft, melodic harmonies -- pretty heavenly, you might say. i also loved their covers of heavy d & the boyz' "now that we've found love" and liz phair's "girls, girls, girls." there will be many good things to come for this band down the road if they keep at it. their next show is in the old office at the knitting factory on jan. 21 with  coup fourre . okay, that is a mighty strange combination of bands, but the show is free, so go check it out!  so what's coming up? i'm sure you already knew, but, well  the shins  are playing under the moniker "roland, OK" at the mercury lounge with comedian  todd barry  on sunday. my friend rachel talked to todd barry about it, and he said something like, "i hope it's not a blood bath" in that wry tone that pervades his stand-up. dude is funny, so i'm looking forward to this show very much. it sold out at some point this week so i hope you have already bought your tickets. apparently, the show is a warm-up for the shins' before they appear on letterman or one of those other talk shows.  on tuesday, jan. 13,  the fever  and  the unicorns  are playing a FREE show at pianos. word is that the show is going to be insanely packed so get there early, kiddies. you know how frickin' small pianos is.   bishop allen  is playing the mercury lounge on wednesday, jan. 14.   on jan. 15, there is one juicy show going on:  prosaics ,  mahogany  and  the winter pageant  at sin-e.   on jan. 16, another juicy fruit:  asobi seksu  and  moonraker  at mercury lounge.  i promised annabiotica i wouldn't post this on my blog, so i'll be vague. one of my favorite brooklyn bands might be breaking up because their drummer is moving outta town!!! i am heartbroken. argh!!   nyc bars closing at 1 am!  urlLink jo divestar  forwarded this message: Apparently City Hall and the Department of Consumer Affairs have been getting complaints about noise late at night from neighborhood activists and other lame ass people like them, so much like the smoking ban, New York City is about to be ruined once more.  Only this is much worse.  They are planning an initiative to force all bars to obtain a license to stay open past 1am.  It's somehow tied into the repealing of the cabaret laws, but apparently it's a big joke because they can revoke the license at any time based upon the dumbest criteria and without due process.  If you care at all about keeping NYC...well, NYC and keeping bars and clubs open past 1am, then I suggest you go to these links and write to your state congressman and Mayor Bloomberg himself.  Tell them what bullshit this is, and that you're opposed to it.  For those of you who are musicians, this is a potential threat to your way of life. Congressman Joe Crowley:  urlLink write2joecrowley@mail.house.gov  Mayor Bloomberg:  urlLink http://nyc.gov/html/mail/html/mayor.html

       au revoir 2003    i stopped by jco's dinner party at the powers house on new year's eve. there was a lavish spread of food, but i was wary to eat anything cuz i thought i might end up puking it all up when i get boozed later on. then later on i rushed over to graham's loft to see erika's band au revoir simone play. au revoir simone are four lovely ladies, three keyboards, one drum machine and four beautiful harmonies. have you ever heard of that before? three keyboards! afterwards, we all headed up to the roof to ring in the new year. we could see the city skyline, the empire state building and all that good stuff. when the clock struck midnight, the fireworks in times square went off as well as in other places within eye sight. everyone was chugging their own bottle of bubbly and giving each other good cheer. soon afterwards, keith and i headed home because he wasn't feeling well, and we passed out. happy new year!!

       elephant woman    i adore the new  urlLink  blonde redhead   song, "elephant woman." i was listening to it on repeat whlie walking around the city last night. the emotion in kazu's voice is startling. mind blowing. inviting you into the sadness. embracing and gentle and fragile... can't wait for the album to come out on march 9... the album is more produced and pops a lot more than their old stuff. i bought a ticket for each of their upcoming bowery concerts, and i just can't wait to lose myself in the dizzy spin cycle of their music.  while walking around, i started off feeling very cold, but after a while of just wandering around and seeing the night life, my body warmed up with a flood of memories. after almost 7 years of living here, i have so many memories... so many different aspects of my life lived here... and suddenly here i am today, a product of all those experiences. motherfucker, where did the time go?  sometimes i take for granted the fact that i live in new york, and what a fucking great city it is. how fortunate am i? i have always known that i would end up in new york, even before i knew what new york was like. and once i came here i never left. some people go home during their summers in college, i was emphatic on staying and working in the city. some people spend time with their family during vacations and breaks, i stayed in the city and lounged in the buzz of new york -- those experiences i wouldn't trade for anything else.   earlier in the night i was at pianos to see  the blue sparks  and meet up with jo jo. i have to say that i had had my doubts about  the blue sparks . i've seen them twice before and i didn't remember them at all. the only song i knew was from the truthflies compilation. so when i saw them at pianos that night, i didn't know what i was in for. it could be good. it could be really bad. but luckily, it was really good. they play their music fierce, sometimes even getting in fights with each other on stage. the tension was definitely thick. but those spats add fuel to the electricity in the air of their performance, and actually made them quite interesting to watch. plus the girl in the band has one of the biggest girl fro's i've seen in new york, minus macy gray. that's quite an accomplishment in my book.  then we headed over to see  urlLink jo jo  deejay at black and white. boy was that shit packed to the brim. i'm very claustrophobic so the place was really freaking me out. i had to go outside every 15 minutes or i would get very short of breath and annoyed at all the people brushing violently past me. i was determined to stick around though and see jo jo deejay. that was my entire goal for the night. she finally went on pretty late in the night... i think she started with  stellastarr*  "my coco" and then she played  the walkmen  "the rat". i was overjoyed, but probably the only one besides jocelyn who was rocking out to it. i'm the biggest dork when it comes to the walkmen. their fast stuff makes me want to dance and pop a vein in the process. can't wait to see them in april!

       practice makes...  ... awesome. practice went well yesterday. i think i was in a haze for most of it, and i felt like i was dreaming. my head was swimming in music that really comes alive, swirling and twirling around the rehearsal space like chinese dragon kites on a windy day in central park.  afterwards we went to kayrock's speakeasy. i had never been before, but he turned his place into an amazing lounge. i didn't feel like i was in someone's apartment at all. i ran into steven's roommate and luke. very random... i was gonna try to drag my ass into the city to see jo jo spin at pianos, but i was starting to feel deathly ill. so instead i made the long, cold trek home and completely passed out.

       this winter is killing me  you know it's cold when you have to prance around like an elf just to keep warm while you're standing outside of a building to smoke. or something. well, that's what i found myself doing all night. plus, the late night after late night gig was weakening my defenses. but i told mike from the winter pageant i would come see his band, and i was determined to keep my word. i mean it's a pretty exciting gig to be opening up for french kicks. i was only sad i had to leave to go review the fever/von bondies show at bowery... peeps, that is what happens when you make plans in advance. i am going to try to never do that again.  the night at mercury started off with a sweet trio from kentucky called  shopping . as a girl, i have to tell you that i like the name... but i can't explain why three guys named their band shopping. i didn't have time to talk and investigate further. i wanted to pinch their cheeks they were so cute! they definitely had the startime vibe exuding from their pores, especially one guy who was nerded out in glasses and a v-neck sweater. i had no idea kentucky could birth indie-ness as such. the other singer was a cute one as well, and boy could he sing charismatically. it wasn't so much that he had a beautiful voice or anything like that (the other guy had a prettier voice), but that he commanded a lot of attention when he sang and sang it with spastic energy. they started off strong and upbeat, and at many points reminded me of french kicks in fact. i really liked the song they dedicated to isaac, mostly because of they screamed this one line in the middle of the song in unison and it sounded awesome -- it totally brought a smile to my face.   after shopping i ran into jerry from  knife skills  and  turing machine . he's the coolest dude ever. always has something cool and interesting to say. a very engaging person, not to mention an excellent drummer who seems to make other drummers scream like girls. ;-)  he and i both were there to see  the winter pageant . he's friends with paul the bass player. you might have heard me mention this band before on this blog/site/thang. they were and are still auditioning for drummers. but i saw them a long time ago at luna lounge, and was pretty amazed by the pretty sleepers they were offering up. the lead singer's voice is almost like an instrument itself -- gliding along the top of the music like a cool current of coos. they're the kind of band you want to lie down on a carpeted floor, close your eyes and listen to. plus they have some kind of xylophone instrument that makes their songs ring like icicles dripping and freezing on the ground. excuse me if that doesn't make any sense. it's quite early in the morning for me.   then i headed over to the bowery to see  the fever  and  the von bondies . said hi to rachel as she headed into the merc for the kicks. ran into jo jo also, and we and her friend headed over together to bowery. i ran into matthew at the bowery, who is a total sweetheart. found out a little more about the band he is starting. i have to say, i am dying to hear him sing. you can read my review of the rest of the show on popmatters in the somewhat near future. if i don't die of pneumonia before then.  and no i wasn't at the after party at starfoods. before that point i texted jo jo and said, "i'm dying here." that's when i know i gotta go to sleep or else i'm gonna pay sorely.

       opening the locked doors  as you probably already know, i started off today listening to  urlLink  neil young  . what a great songwriter... except for that song "a man needs a maid." i don't care if he wrote it in the 70s -- that song was quite comical in a "is he serious?" kind of way. that really made me laugh, but i hear there is an acoustic version of the song that will erase my memories of the dramatic musical version. on the other hand, i love love "pardon my heart." it appeals to the sobbing sap in me.   when i listened to that song five billion times, i got into the mood suddenly to listen to  urlLink  the dresden dolls  . they are dark and emotional at times... i craved the song, "half jack." it was weird how i began to listen to it on a whim because it's one of my faves of the band, and then i started to feel intensely sad. the lyrics are vague enough to where i could relate to them and the pain that is encapsulated in amanda's voice and those powerful words. the song opened a flood of thoughts and emotions -- opening the doorway to stuff i don't like think about. not too many songs do that these do they?  most of the time we listen to music to escape and forget our troubles. but the dresden dolls love to open up and put the spotlight on their troubles. wallow, even. or poke fun of. their music is exposed, and listening to songs like "half jack" is like picking a scab over and over to watch it bleed -- until finally it forms a scab and you can move on. quite cathartic.

       the art of storytelling  anna's story about our run in with the split pants guy is up on  urlLink really small talk . her perspective of the sitch is funnier than mine.  also tonight:   urlLink watch dan kennedy as he hosts the moth  -- in another life, jco and i were interns at  urlLink the moth  for about two years. i like to think of them as the golden years of the moth where we had amazingly talented storytellers like mike albo, shelagh ratner, jonathan ames, frank mccourt, hazelle goodman, romy ashby, edgar oliver, sarah jones, candace bushnell, albert maysles, george plimpton, jerry stahl, joey xanders, reno, timothy "speed" levitch, Philip Gourevitch and many many more. now i think the only person i know at those events is george dawes green, the founder and funder. i haven't been to one since kimya dawson, dan kennedy and gideon yago told rock and roll stories!  also, i think i am in love with this  urlLink cass mccombs  ep,  not the way  and his full length,  A . love love!

       more lit shit  went to see another friend's band  urlLink circle and square  play at lit last night. i was really exhausted from partying the night before, but got myself siked up for the show anyways. two nights hanging out at lit is kind of too much. but such is life. circle and square is a band that has been around for a while. they have their shit down. so when they're on stage, all four members perform tizzight. it just looked so natural. to me they kind of sound emo-ish, punk... very catchy.   other bands performing were  kilowatthours  and  soundtrak . there was one song that kilowatthours played, it was the last song of their set -- an instrumental -- that was just really pretty and magical. i was actually surprised. it was gentle at heart. i like! i like! by the time soundtrak got on stage, i wasn't really paying attention too much. but from what i heard, they are very strokes-ish. i will have to see them again some time i think to really form a solid opinion. what d'ya'll think?  some peeps were hungry so we went foraging the cold city for food. i was a dumbass and wore a skirt -- so i froze my ass off all night. we all headed over to the new  urlLink misshapes  party in the west village at a bar/lounge called luke and leroys -- a two story mini-club. we got there kinda late -- 2-ish, so the party was actually kind of winding down. we hung out for a little bit -- it was good to see all the bloggers in tow. and the most outrageous part of the party was the last song i stayed for -- the walkmen's "the rat." ultragrrrl instantly pulled me on to the dance floor and a bunch of us freaked out, screaming those hammy lyrics. love love!  spent the rest of the night at a friend's place just listening to loads of really cool music that was new to me. it was pretty awesome. then i completely passed out, in a drunken haze that had me in and out of consciousness. i hadn't stayed up that late in forever. it was a crazy, but memorable night. thanks to all.

       all lit up  i went to see anna's band  urlLink knife skills  last night. it feels really good to support a friend's band, especially because you get to see them grow and bloom as a performer. i feel like every time i see this band, the assault is more massive, more killer. their songs are short, to the point but just as deadly, like sharp, quick jabs to your racing heart. if you haven't seen this band, you haven't seen tough, sexy girls kick ass on the stage. i'm not talking about girls who LOOK tough. but girls who really let go and lead with their aggression. if you haven't seen this band, you are missing a phenomenal drumming maniac. i'm not talking about some guy who just bangs hard on the drums. i'm talking about insane beatings that would make the most vicious domestic abuser blush with envy. in short, get thee to a knife skills show soon! if you think you can handle it.   the forms  played afterwards, and they were pretty good through the first three songs. energetic, swaying, melodic, notes elliding into others... and then they began to sound the same on every song. they had a lot of energy and oomph, but could probably stand to fill out more diverse forms to break up their set a little bit. but perhaps the point was to reject form and standard lyrics for the more abstract vocals and the kind of music that melts into itself... a very interesting concept if you want to intellectualize it. i could be taking my thoughts too far though!!  i am so totaled now. i thought that you couldn't get hangovers with liquor, but i proved myself wrong by drinking the most i've drunk in a while: three makers and gingers and a shot of tequila. serious shit, man. and i think i'm ready to do it all over again tonight at the circle and square show. watch out for this girl. she is on a roll. she is talking in the third person... ok i'll stop now.

       mall-o-riffic  today anna and i ventured into the big time warner mall on columbus circle. we are happy because there is a  whole foods  and  whole body  in this mall. there's also a sephora and the borders where the  urlLink fab five  signed books yesterday. i feel like i'm back in suburbia. lunch time has become a little bit more fun. i'm eating melons like crazy.  on our way back to work, a guy dropped something on the sidewalk, picked it up and then said to me, "i split my pants!" it was a total line but i didn't realize it at the time. he wanted me to look backwards at his ass. i didn't look, but anna had the pleasure. she said he looked back and waved. the whole funny sitch kind of brightened up my day!

       more photos from vegas  i was in the worst mood until keith bought me this las vegas trucker hat to wear. then my old, goofy self came back and i was able to enjoy las vegas despite the cheesiness. i played black jack for an hour, and left only five dollars down. not bad! it was fun. i felt like i was in one of those celebrity poker showdown episodes, except i was playing black jack.

       mr brightside  walking around las vegas is like being in a pedestrian terror trap. unlike new york, las vegas is anti-pedestrian. but after hearing from the hotel clerk that there was a 45-minute wait for cabs, i was like FUCK THAT I'M GONNA FUCKING WALK, in true new yorker fashion, of course. i started walking over to the strip, in a cynical kind of mood. but it was just so nice outside. i swear it felt like it was in the 70s, a pure joyous contrast to the east coast weather i was trudging through only a couple days earlier. warmth = good mood. i ambled on the streets directed only by the huge "harrahs" hotel silhouette on the skyline.   when i got there, i followed some people walking into the harrahs. of course i saw the casino floor and just sort of walked through the entire thing. the ka-ching of the slot machines were kind of enticing -- reminding me of the time i went to detroit and went to canada to gamble in the windsor casinos. i had lost $20 that day. today i wasn't really in the mood to play much of anything. soon i realized that there wasn't much to do in las vegas if you weren't in the mood to gamble. but seriously, who gambles on their own, right? i decided i would do that tonight when keith is around. today i would just walk around, soak in the gaudiness, take photos of things like the tourist i am, and go shopping! i'll spare you the details but here's some eye candy. i'm hoping to feel the energy of a song like  the killers ' "mr brightside" while i'm here in vegas. so far, no go.

       colorful evening, sleepy days     urlLink joe and george  and i went to see  urlLink  the color bars   last night at sin-e. i was listening to their cd earlier in the day, and wasn't sure i was into the pop-alt-country-funny songs. but what was particularly delightful about the color bars in their live performance is their beautiful three-person harmonies. it's pretty amazing that three people can sing so in synch. it was like watching an alt-country version of hanson!! while their lyrics were kind of silly (intentionally, i'm sure, but still not too impressive or enticing), some of their songs were really well-assembled rock songs with beautifully swaying guitar lines. it was weird because the band would go from plain goofy to really intricate, sweet music. it was also the kind of band that switched instruments a lot, which was cool and brought in different dynamics to their performance. i also loved it when they gave away valentine's day cookies that one of the guy's girlfriend had made. sweet.      originally we were at the show to meet up with some peeps for band business shite, but couldn't find them in the crowd. i was kind of annoyed because i missed seeing  urlLink  sam champion   at luna lounge -- sorry about that noah and jay. i didn't miss you guys on purpose!! and i promise i will catch you next time. sorry sorry sorry.     anyhoo while i was there at sin-e, i talked with bill britelle of  the blondes inc  for a little bit. and he introduced me to this guy who's an artist -- a pretty amazing artist, in fact -- very basquiat. i think his artist moniker was fa-q -- pronounced like "fuck you." i saw his portfolio of work, and was instantly taken in by the complex emotions and raw display of pain and anger in his work. this guy should not be working at sin-e. he should keep on with his art and have shows again in new york city.       it was kind of a late night, and j&g and i headed over to my place. i had like almost an entire pizza in my fridge from the night before that i needed to get rid of, so i heated it up in the oven, and we all had a late night munch. it felt like i was in college or something. we ended up watching elimidate -- a show i've never seen before, and soon found it was kind of fucked up!! all the girls on the show kept bitching at each other and the jockish guy was totally grossing me out. "i wanted to squeeze her butt like they were georgia peaches." YUCK-O.  after j&g left, i had about an hour to pack and clean up the house. i didn't have any time to sleep. before i knew it i was heading to laguardia. i thought i was gonna pass out!! but the music list on my ipod helped me get through my 8 hour plane ordeal to vegas. here's what i was listening to: "mind blindness" - dirty on purpose "monument" - dirty on purpose "latitudes" - pela "all in time" - pela "what" - brendan benson "quarter to three" - bishop allen "don't hold your breath" - calla "mother sky" - calla "lovefool" - cardigans "delicate" - damien rice "love is only a feeling" - the darkness "here i dreamt i was an architect" - the decemberists "coin-operated boy"- the dresden dolls "in this city" - enon "crying just for show" - french kicks "close to modern" - french kicks "1985" - french kicks "trying whining" - french kicks "the devil wears earplugs" - the joggers "mr brightside" - the killers "rocknroll" - lovedrug "down toward the healing" - lovedrug "to hell with good intentions" - mclusky "tomorrow" - morrissey "happy kid" - nada surf "inside of love" nada surf "big brat" - phantom planet "1st things 1st" - phantom planet "nothing better" - postal service "lipgloss" - pulp "common people" - pulp "disco 2000" - pulp "collide" - rachael yamagata "house of jealous lovers" - rapture "samson" - regina spektor "waiting" - the rentals "wonderwall" - ryan adams "gone for good" - the shins "the end has no end" - the strokes "inoculate the innocuous" - the unicorns "the rat" - the walkmen "my old man" - the walkmen "little house of savages" - the walkmen "138th street" - the walkmen "maps" - yeah yeah yeahs "y control" - yeah yeah yeahs  the hotel room is nice. but i totally crashed and slept all day. i got to vegas around 10 a.m. (vegas time). so crazy. completely exhausted. i ordered room service, ate heartily and then went to sweet sleep. keith had his laptop all set up with internet connection for me (he knows me so well -- i'm completely addicted to the internet and would go crazy if i didn't have a computer on this short trip). tonight we're supposed to go to some party that his company and ibm are having. then we have the rest of the night to do whatever we want. originally he had told me that friday night would be stripper night... i dunno if i'm totally down with that, but i guess we'll see what the night will bring!

       rough trade  this week has been kinda rough. some good things, some bad things. there has been this huge anxiety building up within me these past couple days. i've been trying to fight it off, but it's kinda weighing me down emotionally. though i always try to be my perky lil' self. think happy thoughts. happy thoughts!  ...  urlLink pela  . whoa, they totally stepped it up a notch or 10 at their mercury lounge show on tuesday. the volume of their show has gotten considerably louder, and billy is as passionate at the mic as ever. these are the kind of guys who wear their heart on their sleeves. love love them all! they also have this great new drummer who makes rock faces while he's pounding the beats. i love bands that look like they're having a lot of fun while their songs are bursting out of the monitors. full force. a good performance needs great songs, great spirit, and charismatic players. all was had by pela. also had lots of fun listening to their manager, lee, tell his biz stories. this is what i imagine touring life must be like -- sitting around in musty rooms with my peeps, smoking and drinking and telling stories that draw laughter and bring us closer together. sorry i don't have any photos. i brought my temporary digicam with me but then realized there was no smart media card in it. d'oh!!

       no week for the weak  what a crazy week it's been! i started off friday morning at work, and there was an explosion in my building. the entire place was evacuated and eventually people were sent home. this was fine with me because i had a lot to do to prepare for the dop show at the knitting factory... but it was kinda scary seeing thick black smoke coming out of the side of my buliding. i think the first thing people thought it was was a terrorist attack. all they smelled was smoke and then when they looked out the window, they just saw black smoke. scary eh? people were running out of the building before anyone even announced an evacuation.  anyhoo, the  dop  show with  suicide girls  was great. the place was packed, and our fears that they'd get boo'ed off stage in favor of naked girls was forgotten once the band started playing. there were a lot of new faces in the crowd and people were into it. their set was 25 minutes long -- short and sweet. it was cool because after their set, people in the crowd asked for more. and they finally got to premiere their hot new song, "mindblindness." that song just drowns in emotion and builds up to an epic finish. sigh.  i really liked the people who worked at knitting factory. thank you especially to johnny the night manager. you are a total sweetheart!!! mwah!  so good to see bsiii in the house. i was happy that he was really into dop -- i had given him their cd at the last  cousin  show i went to at happy ending, and he came out to support. talked with him for a little bit but then lost in him the crowd later on. he's going to have a birthday party coming up at sin-e this month on feb. 22. cousin will play. it will be rad. come out and celebrate!  arthur from  stellastarr*  also came out to check out the show. one of my friends told me she didn't recognize him with his shirt on! it's ok though because he looked just as cute with clothes on. ironically, later in the burlesque part of the night, there were many topless girls with tape on their nipples. that's such a stellastarr* rip off! haha. saw daniel from  circle and square  at the show, and i was very delighted to hear that he liked the show. ed from circle and square was also in the house representing. we also ran into doug from  the go station , jeremy from  autodrone , heather from  au revoir simone , and many more that i can't seem to think of at the moment. forgive me, it's been quite a week.  on a side note, lately the band has been calling me "pickles" despite the fact that i keep telling them i'd rather be called "penguin." i think i'm going to have to just accept this new moniker. but i thought another nickname for me uttered later that night was even funnier: "america's sweetheart". just as long as no one calls me "all-american girl" i think we're a-ok.   the band's show with pela last night at b61 in carroll gardens was super fun. it was so comfortable and free with lots of warmth. the bad part was that i got more than tipsy, dropped and broke my camera. while that's getting fixed, i will be using my bf's little digi-cam. cute and just as effective. pela was really amazing. it's been so long since they've played a show so we were excited they asked dop to play with them and even happier to see them play. i think the last time they played was october! they played my old favorite: "latitudes" and my new favorite "all in time." there were some technical difficulties -- the band played so hard that they blew out the power! but that's awesome in my book. the more passionate, the better.  dop also played a fun set that included one of my faves that still hasn't been recorded yet: "air show disaster". it's this huge instrumental that always makes me want to cry. it sounds cheesy, but when i listen to it, it affects me so deeply i want to weep or something. what can i say? i'm a sensitive sucker. george broke a string and the band, like pros, went into an impromptu performance of erika's new keyboard song. it's a very low-key song with a beautiful flow. hopefully they'll play it at another show soon...  here are some new photo galleries: *  urlLink french kicks @ mercury lounge  *  urlLink dirty on purpose with pela @ b61  *  urlLink dirty on purpose @ mercury lounge  *  urlLink dirty on purpose with suicide girls @ knitting factory  *  urlLink knife skills @ north six    and some cool upcoming shows this week:  feb. 10:  pela  @ mercury lounge feb. 10:  steven mertens - solo!  @ cinema classics feb. 10:  dresden dolls  @ joe's pub feb. 11:  french kicks ,  peelander z  @ merc lounge feb. 12:  sam champion  @ luna lounge feb. 12:  ambulance ltd  @ pianos feb. 13:  ex models ,  roger sisters  @ merc lounge feb. 13:  asobi seksu  @ sin-e feb. 14:  regina spektor  @ tonic feb. 14:  my favorite  @ the hook feb. 14:  the wau wau sisters  @ bowery ballroom  check my  urlLink nyc shows calendar  for more!  buy  the recoys  cd at  urlLink realisticrecords.net !  see the amazingly cute stills  urlLink aeri  took from her video footage at the triple walkmen knitting factory shows!  omigosh, i almost forgot to mention that i saw  the lilys  downstairs at the knitting factory the same night of the dop show. they were amazing and surreal and beautiful. i was captivated with their low key set. i want to see them again soon!

       cuts like a knife     urlLink knife skills  ravaged the north six stage last night. they opened the night with their fast-paced, dangerous riffs. anna let loose on the mic and guitar. fon lin exuded sex appeal. jerry beat the hell outta those drums. and they owned it. so fun! it was good to see my dop crew in tow. lowbrau was in the house representin'. and the lovely katy. and her friend jenny. i saw a little bit of  parts and labor , and really dug what i heard. experimental, loud but in a strangely catchy, dancey way. the music moved.

       french kicks!!!     urlLink  the fucking french kicks   made a triumphant return to new york city with the first installment of their residency at the mercury lounge. fucking hawt, people. FUCKING HAWT! i was amazed when they took the stage and wowed me with wondrous, melodic, pure-joy-filled new songs. my hips were swinging and my head was bobbin' with jaunty jubilee... whee!  i know i sound silly but who the hell cares? drummer #2, the post-hugh drummer, quit the band so they temporarily used jake from the joggers, who apparently only practiced with them twice before the show. i was quite impressed. he hit those beat, and he hit them with sassssss! flirting with the crowd! the keyboard and guitar parts were as catchy as ever and josh's voice was featured on one new song. some good quality shit here, peeps! they sounded waaaaay better than they did at irving way back in the day. that venue just plain sucks. mercury is the bomb! no doubt! the whole time i felt like i was a little too close to nick's crotch. but at a french kicks show, i guess that's not a big surprise. that mofo is one tall drink of water. a special thanks to  urlLink isaac . isaac, you are the man. awesome possum and whatnot. matt! lawrence! nick! josh! jake! love love.  met jay from flavorpill, and had a blast! we talked about all sorts of music and had great conversation. he introduced me to the man of the night -- johnny beach who books mercury. johnny was the nicest guy ever. i had so much fun jabbering away, i had to apologize for talking so much. sometimes i get in these weird moods where i have insane motor mouth. it just won't stop! but i promised we would go out drinking and have lots of fun after he returns to the city. wonderful totally cool guy. love love!  anyhoo, also chatted with peter bauer about all things  walkmen ! i had heard from a friend that the "listen to this" supplement in entertainment weekly this week was going to have a walkmen drinking special in it... so i asked pete about it and he said that the writer just drank with them and asked them what they drink. pretty lame stuff apparently... we'll see how it turns out. he said  weird war  may or may not join them when the band attacks irving plaza. i wish i had gotten a chance to say hello to hamilton. i never know if people connect jinners to jin, you know? but apparently hamilton does. i told pete i interviewed hamilton recently, and he told me that he knew because hamilton had told him. the whole time i thought i was interviewing all incognito and shit! no more, jinners, no more. mental note: come up with new incognito shit.  earlier in the night, stewart lupton's band,  the child ballads , were actually quite impressive. stewart has the kind of voice that makes you think of crazy legends like tom waits or bob dylan. i liked the folkish feel of his band. it was weird because i was expecting jonathan fire*eater redux! but got some quality rock music. straight from d.c.! it's kind of a shame because i think a lot of people didn't give it a chance. there were some lulls, but for the most part, quite dramatic.  i still don't know what i think about  the shout out louds ... my initial reaction was a non-reaction. but i think i was so distracted i couldn't form an honest opinion. will have to see them another time. i know jo divestar loves them so they must have some merit!  at the end of the night a bunch of us went to starfoods! of course. i had my standard makers and ginger. i chatted up a storm with new friend jess. shared a cab with new friend justine, who i found out lives a couple blocks from me. it was good to see jco and rachel back in action. i had so much fun! i might end up going all four nights at the merc! crazy? could it border on walkmen love? we'll see...    before all of the musical chaos i went to see adrian tomine at the housing works cafe. great place to hang out, i realized. i briefly saw jason from  urlLink product shop nyc , but i don't think he saw me waving to him. i got adrian to sign my book and i was a stupid flustered nincompoop. damn!!

       love and lost  ok, so... flavorpill fixed the fact that dirty on purpose wasn't mentioned online. whatever. i still think they're journalistic dunces. not in a harsh way. just from one journalist to another. now i know i can't exactly trust their reviews. moving on...  anyways, back on to the music i've been listening to. on saturday night  urlLink  the gostation   played tiswas. the crowd was full and lively. it was weird how i was there to see and support singer doug levy, a recent acquaintance. then i realized i knew another member of the gostation, their guitarist, from college. small small world! the gostation is brit pop gone rock'n'roll on u.s. soil. relatively new to the scene, i was digging their oasis ways... it was weird to hear them also cover an oasis song, but doug had the lead singer moves all down pat. watch out, liam! their set was energized and emphatic. looking forward to seeing them again soon...   urlLink  aerial love feed   headlined the night. i had seen them once before at vicious. the first time i wasn't really sure what i thought of them. they were loud. they were stylish. and they were strobin'! and geez were they strobin' again at tiswas. however, my opinion of them changed for the better. strange, eh? the only thing i didn't like was the fact that their set started to sound more and more like one big song. they had energy and the rock star poses (which are great, actually), but not enough differentiation between songs. and way too much strobe. please stop the strobe. it's great for finales, but not for a 35 minute set!  also, in case you were wondering, my interview with alex greenwald of  urlLink  phantom planet   went well! he seemed a lot younger than i expected, but he was a talker and easy to chat with. i can see why the teeny boppers like him. while listening to the new phantom planet album, i felt like dancing. i think that's a good sign. who cares if their last album was a pop-tumor? though i did like that "turn shift repeat" song. anyways back to the fact that it makes me want to dance. dance!

       the good and the bad  happy  walkmen  bows and arrows   day! go buy your very own copy of their record today!  I was really underwhelmed with the Flavorpill review of the  Suicide Girls  show this Friday. Could everyone  urlLink email them  and let them know they forgot to mention the featured band,  Dirty on Purpose ?? I will love you forever if you do me this favor.  in other news, popmatters finally posted  urlLink my review of  the unicorns  at southpaw…   also, I am interviewing alex from  phantom planet  today over the phone. we'll see how it goes…

       the walkmen are A+++++  entertainment weekly give  the walkmen 's  bows and arrows  an "A". fucking hawt. they were the featured review --  urlLink full page review!  i kind of don't like the comparison to the strokes though. they are NOT the strokes! get over it! they are the walkmen! thanks.  i read that time out interview you're all talking about. can't they get through one interview without mentioning neil hagerty?? the answer is no. haha.  all i have to say is IT'S TRUE!!    also: Reprise Records says it will begin selling the debut album from rock act  Secret Machines , "Now Here Is Nowhere," as a download three months ahead of its physical release. The move pushes the envelope on the lead-time major labels are giving to online sales of new releases. as part of the reprise offer, those who buy the album online will receive six free additional downloads, a bundled collection called "sympathy for the download 01." the digital sampler will feature a secret machines bonus track and cuts from the upcoming von bondies, the walkmen, the sun, head automatica and johnathan rice. fans will also receive a free CD-R to burn the tracks on to. the cd-r is a limited edition featuring exclusive secret machines artwork. [billboard.com]  i also got a chance to listen to the von bondies. that album rocks! can't wait to see them when they come to nyc feb. 25, bowery ballroom...

       eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  Yesterday my new movie buddy mike and I went to see one of the most amazing films I've seen in a long time...  eternal sunshine for the spotless mind . We were both in the perfect mood to see this film. It was rather sad, but what a beautiful story, full of just the right amount of romanticism and whimsy balanced out with the gloomy, cynicism so many of us feel about love. I cried, and wiped my tears with a stupid movie theater napkin. I immediately wanted to see the film again! Hope it comes out on dvd soon so that I can watch it over and over! This could be my next  high fidelity  or  me without you . The movie caused mike to not finish his icee, which apparently is an event that has not occurred ever. So there u have it. Go out and see this movie because it is  that  fucking badass hot shit (not "nice").  I also convinced mike to "make party" with moi and meet tom at  urlLink the hook  in red hook. We hopped in a cab and made our way over to the club, which is pretty easy to get to with good directions. We didn't know what to expect when we got there but was instantly struck by how beautiful and elegant and cool the club looked. As mike would say, "it is the jam," or simply, "hot shit"! Ha, and he wonders why he gets carded for R rated movies!   Tom gave us the full tour of the place, which has this amazing downstairs "green room" and then a back outside area where I can already tell will be amazing to hang in during the summers with a juicy bbq set up. I was so excited when tom asked mike and I to deejay the club on may 7. So come see me and dj hot shit human-jukebox! I'll let you know deets as soon as I have 'em...  So we went to see the bands  the dears  and  sons & daughters . I had been hearing about the dears for quite some time now. In fact they were the band I got once on an indie rock band quiz. I had pretty high expectations -- looking forward to getting engulfed in a wall of what I call depressionistic music. And they were dark and depressing at times, but would also often times roll into a psychedelic haze of long, long jams...  The band I was really excited to see was sons & daughters. I have been curious about this band, the kind of band u hear about for a while and suddenly u see them and instantly think, Amazing! I believe they are from glasgow... With a guy and girl singing and harmonizing lyric lines that spoke of unrequited love and dreary states of mind: "you made the first move when I'm near you, don't walk away."  The guitar parts were folkloric with incredible, passionate strumming.... I thought for sure they would break a string or two. Some of the songs also swaggered with cool struts, moments that made me take notice of how tight this band's performance was. I think they play knitting factory soon, so go check 'em out if u can!

       a night of dirty furries  i've been moving into my new digs, located centrally in the wonderful east village. i am really excited about this change because i feel like the east village has been my hood for quite some time now, and now i'll be able to walk home from a rock show. save money on cab rides, yo!!  mike came over late afternoon with a bottle of wine, and his friend anna who i met at sxsw joined us. it was fun just sitting in the living room and having a glass of vino. then i was on my way to pianos for dop's soundcheck. everything was swell in the air. i was light on my feet, breathing in the city.      the rapture and the furries @ knitting factory  tom had invited me to a private party at the knitting factory for cartoon network. his gf lexi got the hook up, yo!  har mar superstar  and  urlLink  the rapture   were playing. i missed har mar, but after all the sxsw drama with har mar, i wasn't too sad. i haven't written about it yet, but har mar beat up some guy who threw a big penis prop at his head. he got all huffy and refused to finish his set... after only performing three songs and stripping down only twice.   i got to the knitting factory right before the rapture went on stage. there were all of these people in animal and pirate costumes walking around. very bizarre. i thought maybe it was a cartoon network thing? but then i also heard that the rapture recently did a photo shoot with a bunch of people in animal costumes, so maybe it was a rapture thing. i dunno. either way it was lots of fun! the open bar was a complete open bar, meaning  you could order anything you wanted. so i went all out and ordered two grey goose and red bulls. i wanted to get some caffeine in me for the long night. i was totally double fisting it, and it was awesome. as i finished one drink, the rapture were stepping on stage.   i quickly ran to the front. the thing i love about seeing the rapture live is that i feel free to dance like a crazy person. there are few indie rock bands that i feel comfortable doing that with. but the rapture is one of them. something about that cowbell and luke's crazy robert-smith voice, it just makes my legs move and my feet jump. i was also really totaled. i started dancing with the polar bear. i was singing along! we were dancing for joy! they danced with furries. luke jumped into the crowd and danced. he jumped on amps and rocked. the cowbell/sax dude was going all dancey. everyone was dancing! it was crazy. at one point, luke sang to an owl bobblehead. it was really hilarious! man, the had to have been totaled to be so goofy. luke gave me a high five after their set ended. i was so happy!! i think all of our dancing really hyped up their performance.   and afterwards the polar bear came up and introduced himself to me, without the costume. apparently, he's in a band too -- his band rahim is playing  urlLink misshapes  on saturday at 10:30. i don't know what they sound like or what he plays in the band, but any guy who dances with me at a rapture concert in a polar bear suit is fucking ROCKIN' in my book. word! plus  urlLink dennis cahlo  (realistics) and audrey of  urlLink melodynelson.com  are also deejaying so there's three awesome reasons to go!  i think the pictures will tell you more than my words:  urlLink check out the rapture photo gallery   i ran into jason from  urlLink  the boggs   at the show, and he told me his band was playing a show at tommy's tavern in greenpoint on saturday night with tall boys and the double. it's a todd p party, and the boggs are one of my favorite new york bands, so you should check 'em out!     dirty on purpose @ pianos  then our crew zoomed on over to pianos to see  urlLink  dirty on purpose   play. shark sandwich had canceled last minute and a band called other passengers (formerly medicine hat) played. they were really good, and had a somewhat similar sound to dirty... the difference being the vocal arrangements and harmonies and basic quirky aspects of dirty like the guitar bow and the fact that dop also have four singers and five songwriters. dop really digged them, and was siked that they were added to the show.  when dirty took the stage i was really excited. they started off with "monument," which was a crazy, dynamic way to start the set. they always get really hyped up for that song. i was still high from seeing the rapture too so i kept jumping and bouncing around. it was pretty awesome. they also played some songs on the upcoming ep, which will be released april 22. we're all really siked about the way the CD is shaping up, and goldenrod has been mixing like crazy! thanks to everyone who came out to pianos last night. i had the best time!   urlLink check out the dirty on purpose photo gallery here.   i hung out with miss jo jo dancer afterwards, it was really chill at a bar where her friends were dj'ing. we were dancing to punk rock and pulp. how hawt is that? and we took silly photos like this one:    tonight i'm going to see  urlLink a place to bury strangers  at pianos. come and join me in a night of LOUD rock. this trio is rawkin' and i'm sure they're gonna blow up very soon. i saw them at sxsw, and was completely entranced. plus, they're very swell peeps too. and i'm all about supporting nice, talented musicians! and then over to black and white to see jo jo dancer deejay. i told her to save the walkmen's "the rat" for when i get there!!!

       SXSW: march 20, saturday daytime  it was one of those off-and-on gray days in austin, where the sky was somewhat shaky. i didn't know if the sun was just peeking out at me shyly or what, but i was ready to start my day early. i have to say i was in a sour mood when i woke up. i think i almost felt like crying, i was so emotionally exhausted. this past month has been a trying time for me. and i went downstairs to smoke outside the hotel, and then do some writing in the hotel lobby.   as i was writing, i saw this familiar looking guy on the couch. i suddenly realized this guy was dan wilson, the lead singer of that band semisonic, except now i think he only does solo stuff. he had played the ascap sundance music cafe in january, so i recognized him from those photos. you might think i'm sorta bizarro, but i used to have a huge crush on this guy back when my favorite song used to be semisonic's "secret smile." that song still makes me happy... it's the kind of sentimental happy that never goes away like when i hear that new radicals song, "you get what you give." it reminds me of my romantic mishaps over the years, and i'm overcome with whimsy.   so i had to do it. i went over and sat next to dan wilson and introduced myself, explained i worked for ascap and he did the sundance music cafe we produced and blah blah blah blah. he was supernice. i didn't tell him i used to have a crush on him. that will be my secret smile for now...     the winter pageant @ the tillery street theater  [winter pageant write up coming soon]   SXSW: march 20, saturday night    rachael yamagata @ la zona rosa  most amazing rachael lyric: "not gonna shed one more tear for you until sunday afternoon" [full write up coming soon]     matthew caws of nada surf  ...so when i had the chance to see matthew caws and ira elliot play a stripped down nada surf set, i was jumpin. it was pure. it was beautiful. lemme tell you, not too many songs can withstand the test of a simple acoustic strip down. most would run away from embarrassment after being so naked because they tend to be empty. but nada surf songs have tons of substance in their storytelling and the strength of their lyrics. plus, they are romantic, which always draws me in. the stage was short so matthew asked everyone to sit on the floor, and it reminded me of the intimate setting that the very first  on the moon music show  i threw last year in march had with the moldy peaches side projects at luxx, except the floors were cleaner.      ira elliot of nada surf  matthew is a gifted storyteller, and we were moths drawn to the flame of his heartache and openness. beautiful. they are working on recording new material, i hear, so i can't wait to hear that!! i was singing along to pretty much every song, except for the new ones (for obvious reasons), and at one point, i had to consciously lower my voice because i felt like i was singing louder than matthew!!! i didn't want to have a  rockstar  moment, if you know what i mean... i told ira about it later, and he laughed and said, "that's so awesome!"     michelle from read yellow @ club deville  [read yellow write up coming soon]     bishop allen  after read yellow, ran into the bishop allen kids everywhere at sxsw. love those kids, but every time they had a show, i was working at the trade show. sometimes things like that get me so down, but luckily i've seen this kids perform so often, i could just sit at the trade show and think fondly about them and just smile. i imagined justin singing one of my favorite bishop allen tunes, "quarter to three," and my face would light up. if you don't know these kids, get to know them now. they are the sweetest bunch with the most surprisingly good music.      ezt  [ezt write up coming soon]     ???, brian, daniel  ok, i'm not sure who that girl in the photo is because i wasn't formally introduced to her, but that is brian, the booker from the knitting factory l.a. and daniel next to him. we were outside of the cass mccombs show at one of the many monitor records blowouts. they had amazing fajitas outside of the venue. texas is good for mexican food, which i ended up scarfing down a lot. my stomach is still recovering!     cass mccombs  cass mccombs is just one of those songwriting wonders that astounds me. i pay so much attention to lyrics when i judge a band, especially with people like cass. substance over style, any day kids. his recorded music is much more wondrous and simple than his live performance. when he's on a stage, cass has a full band with a full sound. when he's on the recording, it feels like it's just him and you in a room and he's telling you all about the sorrow in his life. it's pouring out of his mouth and flowing directly into your heart until your stomach wrenches with empathetic pain. ouch ouch ouch. he didn't play my favorite song, "so damn pure," though, but i forgive him because he did an amazing "aids in africa."     ira from nada surf  while we were gathering enough passes for all of our group to get into the kemado/vice party on saturday night, the doors suddenly closed. we were like, what are we gonna do now? fortunately, we had been talking to ira outside for a while and he saved our evening. after he showed off his "national waffle association" button, he solved our problems, and invited daniel, tom, brian and i to his friend's house party. fortunately, tom had a car and drove our asses over to this guy's house. i felt like i was in suburbia! a real neighorhood! a real backyard! no supertall buildings with glass windows in sight! it was a nice laidback change. we rolled into the house and a gaggle of comedians (i think including eugene mirman) were jamming and goofing around on instruments.      just chillin' in texas on swings and stumps      swinging texas!   we walked to this beautiful backyard with home-made christmas lights chandeliers hanging from the tree-tops. their was a bench swing sweetly framed in lights. the setting was perfect and instantly comfortable. our host and hostess for the evening were instantly hospitable, offering us beer and friendly conversation. i LOVE texans. they are proud, but they are damn friendly. they also had a fireplace in the backyard that looked like a bong, no doubt. check it out below.     daniel, that is NOT a bong.   i had this really long conversation with ira and his maplewood bassist jude about drumming and what drummers would like to be asked in interviews, as they rarely do the interviews... then we talked about the infamous nada surf tune, "popular." i don't care what anyone says, i love that song. and if you listen to my launchcast station, you will notice that it comes on the station every single time!! yes, it's very highly rated. spoken word. making fun of high school brats. the crescendo and sarcasm. genius!!! but of course i also really loved their other songs, especially off of the latest album...  the house party was pretty much the perfect, laid back way to end our sxsw extravaganza. we all gave each other a group hug and parted our separate ways, promising to party with each other again soon. hopefully i'll make it over to l.a. at some point to visit brian. and i'm seeing tom again this thursday. i feel like i met some really good friends! the bonding that goes down in austin is one of a kind and i can't wait to go back next year.

       SXSW: march 19, friday daytime    the killers @ the spin party, stubbs outside stage  i had the best time dancing with ultragrrrl to my favorite killers song, "mr brightside." that song gives me such a high with its dancey beats and its lovely melodies by a mr. brandon flowers. the guy was wearing a full-on suit in sweaty, sun-searing weather. you gotta give a guy props for that alone to suffer for the sake of fashion, but the bigger props come from producing such danceable, poppy tracks that make a silly girl like me dance like a dork in front of hundreds of non-dancing hipsters, probably staring at me and thinking, "what the hell is wrong with that girl?" whatever, i still love that song. it makes me happy-go-lucky.     the constantines @ insound party, club deville  while you walk into club deville, the beer is just sitting in bunches at the bar for you to grab on your way to the backyard area, where the stage is set up for you. the insound.com party is awesome in that way. ok, i didn't know much about the constantines before seeing them at sxsw at the insound party. and that's what this whole experience is about, right? discovering new music? that's why i tried not to see too many of the bands i frequent in new york. i was in austin, with a no-holds-barred amount of new rock around me. and i was hungry to see something novel and new and stunning. vocally, the constantine's music hark back to the days of old school singers like dylan and neil young. the singer's voice is classic, but the music is forward rhythmically forward-thinking. let's just say there were a lot of bobbing trucker caps and rocking knees in the crowd. including mine, of course.    electrelane @ insound party, club deville  [electrelane write up coming soon]     panthers @ insound party, club deville  [panthers write up coming soon]   SXSW: march 19, friday night    the detachment kit  [the detachment kit write up coming soon]     all night radio @ blender bar  i saw all night radio for the second time. the first time i saw them was at the ascap cmj cocktail party at lit. they were just a two-piece, fairly new to the subpop scene, and i totally dug what i heard then. they are members from beachwood sparks, and their sound is pretty out of this world, including lots of points of recorded announcements: "all night radio" -- and in response, i kept saying, "in case you didn't know, we're called...." --- "all night radio". jimmy's drumming style is so loose, yet so solid, and his hair is well... like cousin it. long and flowing and rockin'. farmer dave's voice is just wondrous, drawing you into the psychedelic haze.... their music is better than drugs and alcohol. it's the shiznit. if you don't own their album, buy it now!!!!!     robin phillips prays for the baptist generals      guy from the lilys dancing to all night radio!  when i saw them play the subpop showcase at sxsw, i was all goofified (meaning, all goofy and shit) and apparently so was the singer of the lilys who was dancing all dodgy (and drizzunk?) in front of the stage. they added a third member on bass guitar, this awesome asian dude with the world's biggest funkified sunglasses. it made me instantly adore him. can't wait to see them at the mercury lounge! come to the show and see the wonder for yourself.     swearing at motorists @ buffalo billiards  [swearing at motorists write up coming soon]   broken social scene @ stubbs  [broken social scene write up coming soon]   kinski @ blender bar  [write up coming soon]     the east-west coast rivalry between daniel and steve heats up with a rumble at foosball at the blender bar... it's a tie.  so the story goes, steve and daniel are the same people, except they dwell on different coasts. the rivalry was built by mutual friends who couldn't decide who was hotter. daniel or steve? what do you think? foosball says it's a tie.     a couple in the rain... fighting or making out?  right before i went to see the walkmen at the love collection party, it started to rain lightly. it had been doing this on and off the entire week because the air was so thick and humid. i couldn't believe the saturation of heat that was engulfing me, making my skin perspire and sweat. i couldn't believe it had been snowing in new york the day i left for the festival. and now i was encapsulated in hotness. as we were walking along this fairly empty street, i saw a couple standing in the rain at the end of the street. with the way the light was striking their silhouettes, i was instantly drawn to wonder if they were fighting or just being romantic and lovey dovey. i hoped it was the latter, and decided i wanted to capture the moment. snap snap. and here it is above. doesn't it just make you wanna sigh really big?     me in the rain...  me? i was enjoying the rain too. i took steve's awesome white sunglasses and took a photo of damp self. at this point though i was getting tired and impatient to hop into a cab and head over to the love collection party. the two girls we were hanging with ran off somewhere to do coke or something and we couldn't find them. finally we decided to just head to the party ourselves. it was a drive to somewhere in the dark boonies of austin, where even the cab driver was like, "are you sure you are going to this address?"     the mean reds @ the love collection party      penis prop guy @ the love collection party  finally, we arrive at the love collection party! there are a lot of people already there. the mean reds are on stage in short 70s style running shorts and no shirt on. they are skinny young'uns with a huge penis prop being thrown around stage. i headed for the free beer in the back, hoping their set would be over soon. i was looking forward to seeing har mar superstar... yet scared at the same time. he has a bad reputation of getting huffy on stage...     har mar superstar @ the love collection party  [har mar superstar write up coming soon]     new kid and steve      la steve and moi      the walkmen @ the love collection party  and finally the walkies! i was pretty slick and didn't tell peter or any of the other   urlLink walkmen   that i was coming to sxsw. so imagine the look of pleasant surprise on peter's face when i was there, front and center, as they walked on stage at the love collection party? steve, who used to write for filter, daniel and i hopped in a cab and made the long, scary trek over to where this party was -- basically an empty warehouse about 5 minutes from the main drag of sxsw. even new yorkers couldn't walk that far. the look of surprise on peter's face was priceless. it said, "what the fuck are you doing down here? that's awesome!" and my look was like, "no you're fucking awesome!" oh how i love the walkies.     the wildest walkmen fans ever... yes, wilder than me.  i got a bunch of people around me to dance like crazy throughout their whole set, and i think that amped up their performance. my photos basically suck ass because the light was beaming straight at the audience and would drown out the walkmen. so this is the best i have for ya's. i think every time paul saw a bunch of us dancing, he couldn't help but flash that adorable smile of his. their performance was electrified, and i was singing along to every friggin' song. those guys are the soundtrack to my life, no doubt! "what in it for me?" "the rat" "old man" "thinking of a dream i had" "bows and arrows" ALL FUCKING AMAZING SONGS. if you do not own their albums, what are you doing? you're a slacka, babe. i bet if you ask me and i have some extra cash, i'll buy it for you. no worries.  some random guy took my camera from me and took a photo of me and daniel. then he wanted to take a photo of me and myself. it was like the most bizarro thing to do, but i was so high on music that i was all giggly and into it. saw dawn barger at the show. i say it every time and i'll say it again, she's one of like three women in new york that i admire more than anyone. if i ever needed a woman to look up to, she's it! she manages three amazing bands (the walkmen, the national and the decemberists), and she's fucking awesome at it. a strong role model indeed! she says she's in talks in adding one more band to her management roster, but wouldn't tell me who... hmmmmmmm....     me and peter from the walkmen  the lovely peter came up to me after the show and thanked me for coming. uh, thank the walkies for playing such a wonderful show! they have grown so immensely and intensely over the last two years, that i felt like i was seeing brothers grow up and find their place in life... and in this case, find their place on stage. hamilton is one of the most intense lead singers around. he really gives his all to the performance... his veins pop, his voice get hoarse with emotion, and his face perspires in red huff. paul starts roaming the stage and smiling at the audience. walt was as still and calm and collected as ever. matt was bumping up and down in his throne and slamming those sticks on those drums. and peter was convulsing and sweating in his very distinctive bass waver. together they just work. the equation is a full-on bullseye! and you know what? i can't wait to see them again at irving plaza.

       SXSW: march 18, thursday daytime  I was working the ascap booth at the trade show during the day but my lovely friends would come visit me and keep me company.... Tom! Jo! Mike and jared and byron from  winter pageant ! Thanks so much for coming by for the free beer. I also randomly talked to the guys from the national, who were supernice! I gave them all beers. I also chatted with keith girard, the eic of billboard. He asked me what the hot shows of the night were and I of course raved about  the walkmen , and I told him he missed the amazing  cass mcccombs . And I told him about a band called  I love you but I've chosen darkness . Best band name ever. They are from austin and are phenomenal. See my photos and write up below...     the pleased @ the fader/levis party  Before that I was with jo jo at the fader levis party to see  the pleased , a band from san francisco. The girl in the band was absent and I forget why -- but they were still really good. I just love the way the music felt like drugs were surging thru my brain. I swear it wasn't the free red stripe. Their music just wooshes and unfurls like a trippy kaleidoscope.    SXSW: march 18, thursday night     robbers on high street  i also decided to see  robbers on high street  with jo jo. now i have to say they didn't impress me much the first time i saw them, but i decided to give them a second chance because i find that bands tend to get better over time... and robbers have definitely improved their stage charisma tenfold. i really liked the last song of their set... don't know what it's called but if any of you can enlighten me, please do!! is it on a record or what? i couldn't stay for the sounds because it was beginning to remind me of the nightmare experience of seeing them at luxx -- crowded, smoky and sweaty. i jetted out of that joint and wandered over to try and see stellastarr* -- tom was supposed to be over there.      i love you but i've chosen darkness  on the way, i ran into the winter pageant boys who were standing in line to see  i love you but i've chosen darkness . so i stood with them for a while because i heard that the line for ss* and ambulance was too insane to even attempt. so tom met up with us at red eye fly to see chosen darkness. everybody's been raving about this band like crazy. and i hear the bbc did a huge write-up of the band as well. they are going to be huge!! their songs were so moody in an upbeat way. it made me feel like i was soaring and diving into something quite extraordinary...  Check these dudes out. Met their manager thru daniel. She was a total sweetheart, and I could tell she felt the same way about her band as I did with  dirty on purpose . Its nice to see that. I was also at the show with tom, mike and byron. We were all floored. This band made my jaw drop. I can't wait for them to come to nyc. Nota bene: aurelio from  calla  was there too. along with chris newmyer from self starter and corey from absolutely kosher records.     modey lemon @ beerland  Then we couldn't get in to see  the walkmen  (when i ran into peter later, he said not even people from warner bros could get into the show -- uh, that's crazy!!) so we went to see  modey lemon , who were surprisingly fun to watch.... Actually the asian dude with the bleached hair who was rocking/making love to the guitarist was fun to watch. They thrash their hair around a lot and the music was much like that. I liked the venue b/c it was called beerland and had empty prescription pill bottles on fish nets on the wall. I drank vodka and red bull to keep me awake. I was still not anywhere near drunk so I think my tolerance was way up... Tom left and told us to call him when we left for the next show.   the stills @ emo's  So then we went to emos to see  the stills . Daniel had a special pass that gets u into the venue through the back way. It was funny. I felt like we were incognito celebs sneaking in the back way to avoid the papparazzi. We met up with tom there. We were so tired we sat on the bleachers, but ended up leaving halfway thru the stills set b/c of utter exhaustion.      dinner with ma' peeps @ iron cactus  Earlier in the night I had arranged an amazing dinner at iron cactus for mexican food with jennifer from the ascap l.a. office, jojo, tom, justin and jack from  bishop allen , mike and jared from  winter pageant , and jennifer's friend brian, who books at the knitting factory l.a.     It was a lot of fun just hanging and getting to know each other a little better. Tom said the table was full of jin's friendsters! So true! It was funny and bizarre how friendster is in our normal lexicon.            We ran into  ultragrrrl  at the restaurant. She is one of the coolest chicks in the music scene (besides the obvious other queens of nyc, you know who u are) and always friendly. an entire table applauded her when she walked in and she did a little curtsy. Word!

       SXSW: march 17, wednesday daytime  Don't have time for much of an update but here's kind of a general overview of what happened last night... Set up booth at trade show... Was in the elevator talking about going to see max from  natural history  play the fader/levis party... And one guy said, hey I know max! And the other guy in elevator said, I know him too! Apparently one of those guys was britt daniel of  spoon  (bidi, isn't that funny?) ran into isaac at the hotel.... He's staying with dawn.... Briefly saw  the walkmen  on the street but didn't have time to say hi! Had lunch with tom the booker at the hook (dirty on purpose is playing there on saturday with dennis cahlo and surefire -- go see them!) saw christi from sxsw who is apparently  rhett miller 's sister. She was supernice.... Went to soundcheck....    SXSW: march 17, wednesday night    sea ray  Saw  sea ray  who were phenomenal! they have improved a thousand times since the last time i saw them. with visuals going on in the background and a wash of sound flooding my ears, i found the experience quite overwhelming. the songs are so strong, and the atmospheric surges of music swirled around the air like the flutter of leaves on a windy, autumn new york day. i practically ran to the venue to see the band play sxsw. i hadn't seen them in ages, and was dying to see them, especially in texas! the place was packed.     cass mccombs @ la zona rosa  Saw  cass mccombs  who was wonderful, but not as dreamy live as on the album. I stilll swayed a lot. and i think i missed some of his set! but i bought a tee shirt to support, and still listen to "so damn pure" all the time on my ipod. what a great fucking song... Daniel got stuck in dallas so we couldn't hook up for his showcase. He got me into cass, who I want to see and sing along to all the time!    the go @ hard rock cafe  [the go write up coming soon]     the dresden dolls @ hard rock cafe  Tom and I ended up hanging all night. He was a good partner in rock. We tried to sneak over to  the von bondies  but the line was insane. We went back to the ascap showcase and saw  the go ,  the dresden dolls  (love love! Amanda is a total sweetie), and tim's band,  a place to bury strangers . justin, the drummer totally pulled an arthur stellastarr* by whipping off his shirt and sweating up a storm on the beats. the funny part? arthur was there. i turned to him and told him, and he laughed. so talked with arthur and michael from  stellastarr*  who showed up for aptbs, and lio of  kanine  for a little bit. aftewards, i was sooooo tired and headed back to the hotel. i had been wearing heels all night, and just couldn't walk anymore. i vowed never to wear heels to sxsw again. this girl has learned her lesson, peeps, so don't yell at me.     a place to bury strangers @ hard rock cafe  [aptbs write up coming soon]  I feel like I'm forgetting funny things like how tom and I ran into gaggles of birds who would swarm the tree tops and poo on the ground like some weird bird cult. Anyhoo I'm off to work the trade show and drink more. What a night!

       SXSW: march 16, tuesday night  So I'm addicted to listening to "all new friends" -- the fucking coolest song that is on repeat on my ipod.... Yes it is a dirty on purpose track but who fucking cares? Its one of those tracks that make u wanna jump up and sing.... And dance especially.... Excuse me if I'm using "interweb" language like "u" and lack of apostrophes. I'm a bit tipsy from too much free red wine tonight...   So far I have met some really cool people at sxsw.... And I'm totally loving it. Had a great dinner with some peeps including the cool kids from a place to bury strangers (tim, ollie, justin) and karen from violator -- a fucking depeche mode cover band! How fucking hawt is that?   Tomorrow I have a lot of shit to do for work but I plan on seeing ambulance ltd at the vice/jane party... The wrens and clearlake at the 33 degrees instore.... And ma' boys in the natural history at the fader levis party... and maybe charlie mars at the bmg new times bbq... And cass mccombs at the inland empire showcase and of course dresden dolls and a place to bury strangers at the ascap showcase....   I just came back from some film and tv party.... And the bar was called "maggie mae" .... Do u know that pietasters (?) song "maggie mae bring us another beer take away our trouble dear.... Uh neither did ANYONE in texas. What the hell didn't anyone listen to ska back in the day???

       i feel like reposting this so...  i've been reading my old blog, and it's been so funny. like a trip down memory lane. and i thought i'd repost this funny article i wrote over a year ago:   How To Get Over My Band Obsession:  1) Get one of the members of the band to offend me in some unforgivable way. Like, don't you hate it when a guy asks you about your gorgeous best friend?  2) Every time I hear the band's music, I can zap myself with a taser to the beat of their drum until I have negative associations. It worked for Pavlov, it can work for me, damnit!  3) Just get over my shyness and make out with the keyboardist already…  4) Go all out and make out with all of the band members.  5) Stop being such a drug addict and snap out of my star fucker phase. Besides, guys rarely look as sexy when you're sober. Am I right, ladies?  6) Pretend they're all 12 years old. Jailbait is so passé. Pass it on!  7) Take some scissors to their next show and cut off all their irresistibly dirty indie rock hair. Remember, Samson and Delilah?  8) Give the rock star the worst pick up line ever and run away in horror, never to go near him again. Just like the time I ran into Steve Malkmus in a library… "Er, I, like, really like your music…Der…"  9) Keep telling myself they all look like Keith Richards naked (or at least, they will sooner or later).  10) Meet another band to obsess over. Ooooh, shit!

       bands against bush  i went to see emma la reina and shellshocked at the bands against bush show at sin-e. it was quite fun. saw joel (sp?) from the blondes, inc. at the door, he's so sweet and nice and always has a smile.   met matt, the drummer from  emma la reina , a band whose former incarnation was called telenovella. they played with dirty on purpose at one of belvy's gotham parties at luxx last year. i thought that the band was overall good... but was unsure if it was really my kind of thing. i liked the music for the most part, but the songs weren't as strong vocally... but you know what? people were definitely into the music, cheering on the band, and that's a good sign for them... plus, matt seems like a really nice guy with a passion for drumming.  also saw anna's friend's band  urlLink  shellshocked  . they were quite good. the lead singer is reminiscent of tim harrington's wild style, and i instantly fell in tune with him. he jumped on the bar. he jumped on the counter. he jumped on chairs. he jumped into the crowd. i was fully enthralled and entertained. i really liked the girl singer in the band too. watch out for this band! they really know how to get the party up in arms.  then anna and i jettisoned off to north six. like old-fashioned nerds, we chose the subway over cabbin' it. we arrived just as  cheeseburger  was going on stage. i had never seen them before, and just heard dj raving about them. i think they were good, but not exactly my steez. they were good at what they do though, rambling about the stage like drunken indie party boys who infuse a little bit of blues into their music. it was like being in detroit. said hi to christy (sp?) from the band, who was dancing like crazy during mommy and daddy's set. that was awesome, dude!  then of course we saw  urlLink  mommy and daddy   perform spectacularly too (listening to their fantastic demo this morning!! good way to wake up.). i love watching them rawk together on stage. the interplay and sparks between them is dreamy and fun. every girl's fantastic voyage! vivian is a girl who's not afraid to just let loose and dance and sing her heart out. edmond, from the first time i saw him, has always been crazy scary behind the mic and then the sweetest being off stage. their energies mixed together is the perfect concoction for the punk dance music they produce -- and i don't even usually like that genre of music. viv and ed just know how to rock it the right way.  caught a little bit of  bad wizard  afterwards, but my knee is all fucked up and i was passing out on the bleachers of north six, so i grabbed my bag and made the long trek home. it had been a long night, and i still can't believe i made it through in one piece. i've been going out every night for the past two weeks, and now next week i'll be heading off to sxsw. life is so crazy, i feel like i'm dreaming. the bliss that surrounds me is tingling my nerves. in a good way.   urlLink

       wine is silly  yep, folks, wine is silly. but i can drink the stuff like nobody's bidniz! and what a wonderful haze it is. jackey and i went to her roommate's gallery to preview works they are premiering tonight. i'll post details on the opening here a little later, so that you can show up for the free wine and the wonderful pencil drawings that are worthy of hip screened tees or framed on your purdy lil' wall. i want to buy one or two or three of them, but can't afford to shell out the $75 at this point in time... otherwise, i'd be all up in there because they are  that  good! fans of  urlLink yoshitomo nara  will love colin burns' simple, quirky pencil drawings because they are infused with the same wit, sarcasm, cynicism and humor... but he also has these amazing paintings too... well, you'll see.

       morning playlist  don't mean to sound cocky, but i made the most amazing ipod playlist this morning, and i just wanted to share. make it yours:   calla  - "televise"  dirty on purpose  - "mind blindness"  au revoir simone  - "through the backyards of our neighbors"  ben kweller  - "make it up"  damien rice  - "delicate"  dennis cahlo  - "crushed"  the cooper temple clause  - "blind pilots"  the decemberists  - "here i dreamt i was an architect"  sonic youth  - "superstar"  the stone roses  - "i wanna be adored"  the walkmen  - "french vacation"  doug and i were talking about how we're both people who can zone out of the world with their mp3 player... and how we also sometimes just enjoy the sound of the city. sometimes (most times) i just don't want to hear a crying baby on the subway on my morning commute. word? besides, music is cheaper than therapy.  doug also told me that he recorded me singing, "superstar" at winnie's. omigod. i might feel compelled to post it online... but i started singing the words that were the on the screen and realizing they were wrong, so i closed my eyes and just sang my heart out, remembering the words suddenly like jagged edges of my nervous finger nails. sigh.

       the revolution will be televised   just when i was beginning to think that aurelio's hair and eyes were prettier than calla's music, something completely changed my mind. wow, my mouth dropped wide open when   urlLink calla   played the last song of their set last night, "televised"... then i couldn't stop talking about how amazing that song was to doug. how amazing it was when they softly played the song like it was going to end and then how they crescendo'd right back into the song. i was completely blown away, and that one moment made up for all of the duller ones. it put me into an instant daze. i loved the way aurelio moved on stage. it looked like he was walking through the crowded streets of tokyo, manuevering his guitar around people -- like his guitar was swimming around the stage. and i loved how he was making out with the microphone. what a fucking sensual being.       urlLink the cooper temple clause  ... someone yelled out, "the cooper temple clause, the cooper temple pilots: same thing!" and it was kinda true, but not really. i love this band's ability to delve into so many different elements and mix mish mashes of things together to create a wall of sound that could be taken as a lotta rock, a little bit of hip hop and a little bit of jazz, they were great. i love tom bellamy, the guy with the stache who reminded me and doug of a shorter angus andrew from liars. i love guys like that. he was wild on stage, just letting it all loose and i enjoyed watching him. you could probably say i have a new crush, folks! turns out he's the one i interviewed last week, and he was indeed nice, but definitely has a girlfriend. my favorite song of the night was of course "blind pilots" -- the song i have playing on my ipod endlessly in all my playlists. fucking love that song. you only need one really good one to win me over, at least for now, in this temporary moment of blogginess.   earlier in the night, i stopped by vicious to see   urlLink the gostation   again. i had seen them play before with aerial lovefeed at don hill's and was curious as to how they would sound at sin-e. i had recently befriended doug the lead singer of the band, and found he has a great presence on the stage. i like watching people who look confident when they are behind the mic. it might be sort of an obvious point, but rock stars have to look like they want to own the stage, and doug definitely has that going on, without being annoying like some people can be... anyways, they covered new order, and that's always fucking cool in my book. it was fun, and i was definitely glad doug went with me. incidentally, we ran into the other doug (the gostation) again at the cooper temple clause, who loves tctc. rock on! audrey and dennis were dj'ing, and she informed me that i missed "the rat." rats!!!!!! next time i will have to arrive earlier so i can dance my ass off to that, eh? i was in good spirits, dancing all around with jo jo and jocelyn and whoever. it was fun being a lil' tipsy. so we added a fourth member to  "excuse, moi"  -- miss jojo dancer on drums! how hawt is that? ok, you think i'm silly. but really, i'm just happy.   even earlier in the night, i was having after-work drinks with ma' girls at pianos while  surefire  was soundchecking. we ran into justin from   urlLink bishop allen   there, who was cracking us up with his chipped tooth. we nicknamed his adorableness "snaggletooth" and drank and talked about boston. (everyone had gone to school in boston 'cept for moi.) we were all giggling because surefire were so cute, and they kinda sounded like the monkeys or something -- i love the monkeys! it was cool... now i want to see surefire again. fo' sho! wouldn't it be funny if everyone started callin' them sho'fire! that would be awesome and completely snoopified. unfortunately i will miss the band when they play with dirty on purpose at the hook, but if you're all around, you should go support!! march 20 @ the hook. mark your calendars, babe. also, dennis cahlo is performing, and we all know how good that boy is. and he gives the best hugs of any singer 'round town! so ask him for one.  i told justin i would come see bishop allen at lit on friday. you should come too. it will be loads of fun! and probably the last chance you'll get to see them for a month because of their crazy tour schedule. justin told me the band would be at sxsw the whole week next week, so i'll definitely run into him again down there. every day i meet someone who's going to the festival. it's going to be fucking insane!!!!!!!!! insane!!!!!!!!

       questionaires  decided to go ahead and fill out jocelyn's questionaire...  Favorite band in New York City:  the walkmen, dirty on purpose  Top bands I'm excited about right now (in no particular order):  dirty on purpose, au revoir simone, knife skills, cass mccombs, damien rice, pas/cal, pela, dresden dolls, bishop allen, qatsi, the winter pageant     Rockstar crush:  matt from french kicks -- the cutest, nicest boy ever to grace this planet. always with a smile and a hug! also, slight crush on sweeney from trouble with sweeney... talked to him for a little bit at southpaw and was very taken with him onstage. he's like what jack white would be if jack white were a sexy, geeky indie rock boy   Rockstar whose head I would like to bash in with a brick:  i can get along with almost anyone. and i'm not that violent. but if you give me 'tude, i'll give it right back to ya.    Rockstar I wish I could be best friends with:  ed harcourt. i was once alone in a room with ed harcourt for an hour. we got along so wonderfully, just chatting away like best friends. when i went to see him later that night at fez, he was the sweetest to me... and then i never saw him again. so sad. i think we'd get along splendidly!!  Rockstar I am best friends with:  anna barie from  urlLink knife skills   Soon to be rockstar:  jinners and audrey and dennis in "excuse, moi!"  Band that all the hipsters love to love, but I think is actually total crap:  ha, wouldn't you like to know?! i don't like to diss bands because everyone has a right to their rockstar dreams in my book.  Band that I love to love, but all the hipsters think is actually total crap:  hmm tough one... most hipsters like what i listen to.   Band that I wish I could be in:  blonde redhead or enon  Band that I used to wish I could be in:  belle and sebastian -- don't you love "take me away from here i'm dying"?  Best band to photograph:  the walkmen -- hamilton is intense. INTENSE  Band I wish I could have seen back in the day:  the recoys  Band that I will be SAYING I saw back in the day:  dirty on purpose    Rockstar I want to be right now:  sweeney from trouble with sweeney

       come on let's go  so i get home from rod's place last night and get ready for bed when... i hear sweet caz's voice on the fucking telly. i was like, what the fuck!?! and today's email from caz confirms my suspicions:  Jin, Here is some oddball news... urlLink  PAS/CAL   have followed the path of the likes of Cameo, Brendan Benson, and the Walkmen and are now featured in the latest Saturn ad campaign. The nice thing about the dealio is that it will enable us to record our debut full length instead of doing a 3rd EP. Braggadocio notwithstanding, Caz  congratulations, caz! i still love you.

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY,  urlLink ANNABIOTICA !  as part of her birthday present, i took anna out on the town to see dresden dolls. this band  sleepytime gorilla museum  opened for dresden dolls -- we had no idea what we were in for! they were kind of cliche experimental pagan rock of sorts, interesting at first, but in the end, they were simply tiring and entirely predictable. snore! yawn! headache! i did like the girl in the band though. she could go solo and be quite successful. creepy, but in a good way.     dresden dolls  were great, but not the best i've seen them. maybe amanda was tired from playing the night before. maybe she was bummed half the place emptied out after sleepytime (bizarro). but me, i just can't get over "half jack." what an amazing song. some goth girl yelled at me for taking photos. damn, that was the first time someone ever yelled at me for snapping a few photos. what the hell?  currently spinning: cooper temple clause seafood damien rice mono folksongs for the afterlife french kicks brendan benson dresden dolls dirty on purpose  finally decided i hate the  franz ferdinand  ep (enough to want my money back!!), although "darts of pleasure" is completely danceable. don't hate me, ultragrrrl. on the other hand, i can't get enough of  the cooper temple clause . "blind pilots" is amazing. i've also been consuming  damien rice  in large quantities. "delicate" is the bestest.

       cooper temple clause  in researching for my interview today with  urlLink the cooper temple clause , i am caught up with their obsession with poet philip larkin:   It must be admitted that there is a strong current of skepticism running through Larkin's poetry. In "Kick up the fire, and let the flames break loose" from The North Ship Larkin writes about the human need for companionship; he suggests that when we are with a friend, we "prolong the talk on this or that excuse" in an effort to avoid being alone. Unfortunately, "when the guest / Has stepped into the windy street, and gone, / Who can confront / The instantaneous grief of being alone?" Although we find some comfort and meaning in the company of a friend, as soon as we are left alone, the reality of our personal isolation crashes down upon us with frightening implications.

       all in time  you already know this, but i really dig that new  urlLink  pela   song, "all in time." so damn catchy! caught the band again at sin-e this weekend and had such a blast. billy was extra active on stage, bashing and crashing around. and nate, eric and josh were so awwwn it as well. i especially love nate's catchy-as-hell guitar parts. their new drummer was also rockin' out and is quite fun to watch... but you've heard me spill time and time again for pela.  after their set, i SPRINTED to the living room to see  urlLink dennis cahlo  from  the realistics  do his solo thang. let me tell you how sweet his voice is... it's so soft, and his falsetto just melts into the air, swirling around and unraveling like an intimate secret whispered into your ear. it's a dizzying spell, like almost kisses and hands accidently brushing up against your arms. his acoustic songs made me giddy. and his tender cover of my favorite realistics song, "why didn't you stay?", just blew me away -- to the point i was sitting in my chair, singing along, my heart tingling with each wonderful lyric. the girls are gonna swoon big time when his solo album comes out. and i thought it was totally sweet how he dedicated pretty much every song to  urlLink my favorite frenchie !

       Dirty on Purpose on Riot Radio!    The upcoming  urlLink  Dirty on Purpose   CD,  Sleep Late for a Better Tomorrow , will be streamed live on  urlLink Riot Radio  on April 22 at 10 a.m. EST until 12 noon.  There will be another broadcast of the show for those who missed it. It will be from 4 to 6 p.m.  Check it out, kids, and then come to  urlLink the big party at Pianos !!   Hear the Buzz:   From  Time Out New York :  Local five-piece Dirty on Purpose's stunning EP  Sleep Late for a Better Tomorrow  is full of strange, sweet melodies that had us wishing it was more than 20 minutes long.   From  urlLink Sugar Zine :  This Brooklyn five-piece has been making some serious waves since they began playing out in late 2002. One of the more interesting aspects of this group is their trading vocalization. Although their drummer Doug Marvin is considered the lead singer, three other members share time on the microphone while all five contribute to the song catalog. DoP’s sound can change from delicate to dynamic in a matter of seconds with soaring instrumentation and intense riff interplay. With a self released Ep due out in April (with some help from On the Moon Music), DoP is ready to win you over.    From  urlLink www.rheingoldbeer.com/backyard   You'll be lulled into those dreamiest of states like a baby rocked in the cradle when you catch this Brooklyn based quintet. Their soothing, glistening sound creates climaxes for the smart ones who really listen with raspy guitars and unique plays on volume. Less is more in their game...DOP's winning but understated complexities will make your cup runneth over...lets just hope its full of Rheingold!    From  urlLink jenyk/dot/com   With the able assistance of producer extraordinaire Rod (of Pela fame) - fused and synched and flowed their 5 distinct personalities into a sound that after having sat down with the songs on eternal repeat for a good solid week I realize aren't dark like I had thought they were when I first heard them live, but have taken on a youthful so-not-typical optimistic childlike wonder way of seeing the world - a feeling that if you knew Doug, Erika, George, Joe, and DJ you'd understand just how and why they'd feel that way.   From  urlLink Flavorpill.net :  Brooklyn's Dirty on Purpose open with sprawling soundscapes that induce dreamy reflection. The pensive lyric-writing duties are split between all five members, while only four of them share time behind the microphone, anchored by the strong vocals of drummer Doug Marvin.    From PlayLouder.com: urlLink    Kicking off the night were New York rock scene newcomers Dirty On Purpose, a five-some causing a stir with their swirls of atmospheric pop, combining soft, smooth melodies that seem to caress like warm summer waves, and introspective lyrics delivered in a childlike croon by none other than the band’s drummer.   From  urlLink Escaping Words :  I heard about dirty on purpose last summer and remember checking out the tracks on their first ep. I remember them being cool. They vaguely reminded me of Explosions in the Sky...The previews got me re-excited though. They sound check-them-out-worthy if you like layers and don't mind lots of repeated notes.    From  urlLink Mo'Time :  Dirty On Purpose meanwhile are well matched with Say Hi To Your Mom; they too have a mellow and fluid sound. However DOP rely more on rock-based structures, heavy on the echoing electric guitars and feedback. But they can also tone it down to an acoustic hush with such songs as "Go Back To Sleep", an imperative song whose command is easy to follow.

       those kids  you know, those kids you always run into at shows, on sidewalks on sunny days in new york, in dingy, smoky bars in the wee hours of the morning? yeah, those kids. love them.  urlLink you know who you are.   in other news, i finally saw noah from  urlLink sam champion  do his solo thang at the mercury lounge this past weekend. sure it was a stripped down version of the cd i've been listening to... but i really liked what i heard -- the kind of shy guy behind the mic who sings quirky lyrics with humor, wit and a bit of charm. stephie and i liked him so much we gave him our drinks. i especially love "TV Fever" and that song that Jay calls his "cuddle song"... the band's next show is: may 20 @ pete's candy store  709 lorimer st, williamsburg, brooklyn, ny 10:30 pm // 21+ // free.   we also went and supported bsiii in the off-broadway play he's in,  urlLink the moonlight room . the play is set in a hospital waiting room -- it's the kind of play that has a lot of witty repartee, along with moments of silence that almost act as other characters in the story. as the play unfolds, and you begin to figure out the complexity of the characters, you see that there's always more going on with people than it originally seems. this is a lot like life, we all hide behind painted exteriors that can slowly peel and chip away in floods of hardship and reality checks. and as the play progresses, you see the characters aren't always what they seem. if you get a chance, you should check out the play. call 212-239-6200 or 800-432-7250 to reserve tickets. use discount code (MRGR645) for $10 off ticket price!

       march 25: dirty on purpose -- up party @ pianos  I think I already told you about this show... but it was loads of fun, and the bands on the bill were amazing... kari and belvy's party on Thursday nights at pianos are always loads of fun with all of the amazing people that show up from week to week. They really have their shit together, and promote some of the coolest bands in the city. We had some problems with the sound at the venue, but overall it was a fun night of hanging with peeps in tow.  urlLink Dirty on purpose  are happy to have them host the cd release party on april 22 at pianos with  urlLink jasper  and  urlLink audrey  sponsoring.    march 26: a place to bury strangers @ pianos  it was tim's birthday, and we celebrated with cake and congratulations. I first saw tim's band,  urlLink a place to bury strangers , when I was in Austin for sxsw this year, and was impressed by their jesus and mary chain roots. Their music often swerves from subtle romanticism, muscled with a tough masculinity that just pulsates with sex. The droning guitars and bass are a total turn-on, the shirtless drummer is magnificent and sweaty. Can't wait to see them again when they play at the dirty on purpose cd release party!   march 29: paper mag party @ blvd & all night radio @ mercury lounge  I was going to spent the night working on my writing, but carol called me up and invited me to go to paper magazine's party to celebrate the beautiful people issue. So I put on my dirtiest jeans and grabbed my g-fab gold lamee purse and headed over to some club called blvd. On the way over, I walked past mercury lounge and saw the chalkboard say, "all night radio."  Wha??   urlLink All night radio  is playing? Why didn't anyone remind me? You are all officially dorks for not doing this.  I continued on to the club, thinking maybe I could convince carol to come with me after the paper mag party. I got to blvd and carol and I strolled in. That place was  massive . We walk in and there are people everywhere drinking skyy vodka and cranberries. Talk about advertising! But the drinks were free, so who were we to complain?  We partied with carol's vidal sassoon peeps and one guy named clint seemed to take to me instantly. He was a white, super fashionable guy who was adorable and bubbly. It made me miss mikey and scotty. Clint works as an asst art director here in new york now, but apparently in Toronto he used to work with a lot of Korean hairstylists who taught him some of the language. It was amazing. He sang me Korean lullabies, songs I haven't thought about since I was like 10 or something. It was wonderful. Then he sorta flipped my hair with his hand and declared that he wanted to cut my hair. I felt like his diva. Mold me! Mold me! My hair has been looking pretty rough!! He gave me his business card, and I was giddy.  Carol agreed to check out  all night radio  with me. What I love about her is that she's always game for anything. She just moved here from boston, and is one of those smart women in this world I so adore and admire. We zipped on over to mercury lounge and I dragged her to the front of the stage because all night radio is a band that is both a visual and aural spectacle for me. My voice cracks with joy when I'm watching jimmy drum all crazy and sweep the wind chimes connected to his drumset. He's become one of my favorite drummers, aside from Jerry from Knife Skills and Turing Machine. Farmer Dave and Jimmy are from beachwood sparks and they have a new bass player playing with them, this skinny asian dude with googly sunglasses. He is very rad.   As a band they create these fantastical soundscapes that are trippy and weird and wondrous. I adore their song, "oh when," and I have it playing on my ipod all the time. it's a total pick-me-up-from-my-rotten-mood song. The band also has this electronic voiceover that says "all night radio." It's totally tongue in cheek, which is another aspect I adore. They don't take themselves too seriously. That's the trouble with a lot of bands these days. They are waaay too serious... get over it, buddy.  Ran into noah from  urlLink sam champion  outside of the venue and tim from a place to bury strangers. Sam champion is a band I've recently listened to a lot because I love pavement. They are pavement reconstructed or revisited. Whichever is the case. I love the twang and the steve malkmus vocals. I haven't seen them live yet, but definitely want to check them out soon!!   march 30: delightful dinner and mixing at rod's  I had a delicious dinner with deron and anna at angelica kitchen where I scarfed down a marinated tofu sandwich. Yummmmmmmy. And drank apple cider. Yummmmmmy!  Then I ran over to Brooklyn and hung out at rod's while we were doing some more mixes on the upcoming dirty on purpose CD. Watching rod work is like watching Einstein solve complex equations. And then all of a sudden it's like "E=MC2" and you're like, what a total fucking genius! He's the best producer, and just has a natural talent that can't be explained.  urlLink Email him  if you want him to work on your CD, and y'all can discuss rates. This is what he does for a living, folks!   march 31: robbers on high street @ mercury lounge  already I'm beginning to see that I'm hanging out at mercury lounge soooo much. I still think it's one of my favorite venues in the city besides Bowery. The sound is always amazing there, and the people who work there are delightful. In fact one of my fondest show memories is when I saw natural history, panthers and the walkmen play there... And I was a dumbass and didn't stick around for liars. Boy did I regret that.  I remember being really impressed with how much  urlLink robbers on high street  have improved when I saw them open for the sounds at sxsw. There was this one song they ended with at sxsw that I didn't hear them play at mercury lounge. I was kinda of in a crappy mood at the venue, and I could have definitely benefited from hearing that song. It's ok though. The first thing that someone said to me when the band started playing was, this band sounds exactly like spoon! I was like, yeah they are similar but I think robbers on high street have more lush build-ups in their songs than spoon do. Spoon is more about the sparse, open land of music (at least on Kill the Moonlight), and britt daniel's vocals are a bit more closer to the mic... more intimate with a bit more drawl. Robbers in contrast have good vibes shining out of their prettily constructed guitar lifts and pulls and melodic keyboard parts.   april 1: the walkmen @ irving plaza  there is something terribly incredible that happens to me when I hear  urlLink the walkmen . My body starts to quiver and I start to full-on dance. It was amazing. I have to thank peter bauer for putting me on the list for this show, and I have to especially thank him for the vip pass, which I didn't know I was getting. It was one of the coolest gestures a band has ever offered me. And I am wholly grateful. I didn't use it very much because I like being up front and center so I can dance with all the other die-hard fans. I danced like crazy!  You know how we are so connected to music and the emotions and experiences and people associated with certain kinds of music? What recently happened to me was that one of my favorite bands was sorta ruined for me because of the fact that they were associated with a certain being. It was insane. Now I feel like I can't listen to that band anymore because it will always make me think of awful emotions!! However, that will never happen to me and my Walkmen music. Why? Because the Walkies only remind me of my exciting entree into the New York music scene. They remind me of times at shows with friends and swaying in front of Hamilton crunched over the microphone. How times have changed! Now Hamilton owns the stage with scary intensity. His in-your-face performance just blows my mind because I saw the band grow so much from their early days. From shy boys to rock stars. The transformation was inevitable, and it is just awesome to witness. I never get sick of seeing them live -- this is a girl who has seen them four nights in a row, and probably could have gone for a fifth. And then went and saw them three times in one night!  I feel like I am a part of history. The walkmen have a special place in my heart that is only associated with me, and for that I am grateful. Currently loving, "Thinking of a Dream I Had"!! But adore "What's In It For Me?" and of course, "The Rat." Angry, vitriolic, bitter, reflective... step off!  Bsiii called me afterwards and we met up at the walkmen afterparty at hi-fi. We hung out for a bit, and I talked to Peter and Hugh for a little while. JoJo and I also hung and partied. I randomly ran into Fiona, one of my former bosses who I am quite fond of. She will forever be 17! I also saw jennifer, preeti, rachel, who I haven't seen in the longest.    april 2: dirty on purpose -- bushwick blast @ asterick art space  I've never really ventured much into bushwick, that place often dubbed these days as "east williamsburg," but I strolled in to see  urlLink dirty on purpose  play the  urlLink bushwick blast  with some of the coolest, noisiest bands out right now. The band was honored and siked to play this festival, which was inaugurated and organized this year from dr.k of  the drayton sawyer gang  She did a stellar job!   And we all pretty much agreed that the show was the band's best performance ever, so if you missed it, you missed a historic moment. We didn't expect it, but because the band just let loose and experimented with different things on stage for their songs, the creativity just juiced up their performance. They completely changed the end of "mind blindness" and they revamped the beginning of "monument." They also dared to play a quiet song, "cheat death," which is probably my favorite song from the upcoming EP. It is so pure, and george's bowed guitar part makes me weepy and heart-achey. Can't wait for y'all to hear it recorded with the vibraphone parts! So pretty!  We enjoyed the bad-ass antics of  the Drayton sawyer gang , and the delicious pancakes produced during the set of  tungsten 74 , a band who improv'd their album during the recording session and then went back and learned the songs they just made up on the blink. How awesome is that? And having food made in front of the stage while they played definitely made me have pleasant associations... I mean coconut and chocolate silver dollar pancakes are fucking awesome! I also think  services  (flux information sciences) were banging on their drums and cymbals with knives... fucking hardcore. And scary.   april 3: coney island at 2 a.m. is a ghost town  we spent another night finishing up the mixes for the upcoming dirty on purpose EP. Yes, you've heard me say that a million times, but this time it was for real and we worked on it until midnight. Then spontaneously we decided to drive down to coney island like we were high school kids driving down to the beach for a picnic. Except it was 2 a.m. and freezing, so we just drove there and came back. Good times! Dirty on Purpose and Rod are like my second family. Good brothers and sisters, like I've always kinda wanted. I'm lucky to have befriended them all.   april 4: dennis cahlo and hightower @ pianos & the sleepy jackson -- shout @ bar 13  dennis started his residency last weekend at pianos. That kid's songs break my heart. I was yearning to hear me some more  dennis cahlo . So I went over to pianos to check him out. He played with a guitarist who was a lil' too loud, but I liked the dynamic element he added to dennis' purely beautiful songs. Truth be told, I prefer the stripped down dennis, but that's because the bare essence and power of his music is in his angelic, tear-inducing vocals and those wonderful constructed lyrics about love and heartache. I'm a sucka for a beautiful love song.  Then we went to see the  sleepy Jackson  at the shout party at bar 13. I didn't know what to expect really. At that point, I had listened to their CD twice, and each time I kept thinking, this is NOT sleepy. I want sleepy.  But they amazed me at Shout. Their music was rollicking and playful. They were earnest and down-to-earth. There were no antics (well not too many anyways). I wish I had listened to the CD more to sing along to the smooth melodies. It was a mad-house free party. I was kinda feeling intensely anti-social though so jo and I jetted on outta there real fast. I've been kinda anti-social lately. I'm sorry if you think I'm ignoring you or hating you. I'm just not feeling very well. So stressed and incredibly ill. There will be no other apologies.   april 6: passion of the chris: thermals, say hi to your mom, dirty on purpose @ north six  this night is one of the finer moments in new york city rock, where three incredibly awesome bands in their own right came together and totally rawked Brooklyn like there was no death cab for cutie show going on at irving. Haha.    urlLink Dirty on Purpose  played another stellar set, filled with old and new songs. They are constantly writing new music, which is exciting for me, a person who's seen them a thousand times now. I still get chills when I listen to them.    urlLink Say Hi To Your Mom  started with Eric playing two songs on acoustic by himself. I love him for his sarcasm and smart lyrics. He and I are like the same person in that way. We like to make fun of a situation that pains us, rather than deal with the harsher reality where humor turns into hurt instead. His songs might sound happy and poppy (though not all the time), but the underlying message is that of confusion and sadness. Dude is mad-talented. I still love "Hooplas Involving Circus Tricks" and "Super." I also adore the other members of the band, who I got to know better during the night... I think at one point I tackled the drummer while Dan from SHTYM tickled him. They all rock personally and musically, and it's nice to keep company with such awe-inspiring talent.    The Thermals  fucking WOWED the shit out of me. One of the most amazing surprises of the evening. They RAWKED hard. So much energy and sound spouting forth from this three-piece, and Cameron and I were dancing like mad with a few handfuls of other people who were equally as rawked as I was. Holy mother of god. Lordy Lordy Lordy. I took loads of photos. Hopefully one day I'll be able to post some. I'm updating this blog from Alt Cafe. So East Village of me, I know!  Big love to  urlLink Chris Newmyer , the coolest, nicest jesus look-alike I know. I totally adore him!!! Passion of the chris forever!   april 7: the pleased @ mercury lounge & detachment kit @ north six  then I went to see  the pleased , a band from san francisco that draws comparisons to echo and the bunnymen and u2. I got to interview noah the lead singer right before their set. Noah was a sweetheart. His powerful vocal abilities kill me. He gets to into his performance, arching and swiveling the mic stand around with passionate gusto. I met the rest of the band after their set, and they were the nicest peeps. I love when bands are like that. They just want to chill and hang with peeps. They aren't snobby or up-in-their-britches. They are basically a DIY band, and I dig that down-to-earth approach to music. Don't be cold and distant, working through however many layers of publicists, managers, agents and whatnots. Be warm and into creating a community.  Then I met up with my DoP peeps at the  Detachment Kit  show, another night celebrating Chris Newmyer's birthday. I saw Detachment Kit at SXSW and loved them so much. Their music has so many shifts and turns, my head was dizzy with delight. I love the way they sort of arch forward as the music makes a dramatic shift. I love how they clatter around the stage like it's some playroom with plenty of disposable toys to kick around. But it was late night and I had to get to bed. Thus now I am sick with a terrible feverish cold.  But I like to support my friends despite my illness. So I'm going to see  urlLink Au Revoir Simone  at Pianos tonight. They go on at 10:30. Then off to see JoJo Dancer deejay at  urlLink Misshapes . 11:30. Cutting it close, I know.

The best performance yet, you knows its a good show when peter's smiling from the stage during the set. I was sooo waiting for a second encore. Apparwntly they were thinking about it but by that time everyone had run out for a ciggy. Damn! But at least they played "what's in it for me?" of which I know all 10 lyric lines oh so well.... Ohmyheart, they are so sweet and fierce at the same. Rawr!

       The Fever @ Bowery Ballroom  New York Rawk City, a mishappen land very near and dear to my heart, has many a band hoping to not only be the next big things but also grow to be legends or classics. It's a common formula for groups here to tag along and ride the wave of whatever rock is popular NOW. It's a habit that New York, and in particular, the Williamsburg scene, has afforded bands that don't have much vision or originality. Here, bands like A.R.E. Weapons can make the  Spin  magazine spread for hot band lead singers, but we all know they suck and are only hyped because of the celeb connection.... But nonetheless the media feeds and dresses up these lackluster, hype-filled bands with nary a wink of lost slumber. Blogs included.   So I wasn't surprised when I got to Bowery on Friday night, hoping to have missed the ARE set altogether, and found people yelling at said band to get off stage. The hostility that the common rock fan feels toward this group seemed in unison that night, summed up in one simple phrase: "You suck." It was that phrase repeated by many that finally got ARE and their weird posse off the stage. Tell me again why their friends were all standing on the stage? Their brand of hopeless noise was enough to make my intestines twitch. Yikes.  The Fever finally got onstage and proceeded to play their album in order of the tracklisting. As lead singer Geremy Jasper stepped on stage, I could see something glimmering at me. Holy shit, he had a fucking g-fab earring on his left ear! Then he turned around and I saw even more glam shining at me -- a huge golden sequinned butterfly that seemed like it could just flutter all over the sold out crowd at the Bowery Ballroom. How fantastic! That alone got me pumped for their set, which started off with "Cold Blooded" -- whose title reminds me of a Paula Abdul song -- but seriously, the Fever are retro in such a fun, party hardy way... Then sometimes they surprrise with more heartfelt songs like "Put It On You" with parts that scream with emotion. What I kind of missed were the days when I used to go see the Fever and get doused in water or beer and get hit in the head with microphone stands. They have such a raw, unabashedly crazed energy to their music that makes them charming and almost gleeful. The spirit of fun times in New York is certainly within the Fever, and I hope they go on to charm the rest of the world as well, if they haven't already.  Then Mike and I headed over to Rothko, where the afterparty included free Sparks energy alcohol drinks (oxymoron???) and performances by Diamonds and Cheeseburger, two bands that probably should have played Bowery along with the Fever. I quickly snatched up a Sparks... And about halfway through I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I put that shit down right away, but at least now I was awake. This was my first time at rothko, a new Lower East side rock venue that's just a bit bigger than sin-e, with three floors. The inside was all red with a spinning disco ball. And the DJ dared to play Jackson 5 back to back with Michael Jackson. Jacko love? Always. It was fucking packed in there, and I didn't exactly like the crowd. I don't know why but some of the peeps there were a lil' too trendy and swank-faced for my taste.   Diamonds finally stepped on stage and I thought they were better than I'd thought they'd be. I know Jo has been raving about them forever, and I trust her taste in music... But something in me was resistent until I saw them live. The sound at rothko was great. But the vibe was sucky. I didn't feel like anyone in the room except for the couple people going crazy in the front were really into them, which is a shame. I definitely want to check them out again. They're the kind of band that isn't exactly doing anything that hasn't been done before (and not many bands these days do), but they made good rock and weren't annoying or pretentious about it.   Christie's band, Cheeseburger, also had a similar vibe -- fun rock music about partying on Saturday night. The lead singer had on his captains hat and strutted the stage barefoot like a cross between Mick Jagger and Tim Harrington from Les Savy Fav. They were better than the last time I saw them at North Six when they played with Mommy and Daddy. I recalled visions of Christie, a dude with shoulder length brown hair, thick glasses and some kind of tropical printed loose button down, dancing like a joyful maniac during M&D's set and thinking, that guy is so fucking cool! That is a rare occurence for me in this city, but it happened that night -- and in fact happens every time I see him. Man, I hope I am spelling his name right...

       thank you, peeps!  thanks to anyone who came out and enjoyed free pina coladas and my second dj set ever. it was fun fun fun playing my favorite songs like  pavement 's "shady lane,"  enon 's "disposable parts," yes, two  dirty on purpose  songs,  rentals ' "waiting,"  walkmen 's "thinking of a dream i had,"  french kicks ' "one more time,"  thermals ' "no culture icons,"  liz phair 's "fuck and run,"  suzanne vega 's "tom's diner,"  realistics ' "why didn't you stay?" and  weezer 's "islands in the sun." etc etc etc. maybe i'll have time later to post my complete playlist somewhere... though i don't remember what order i played it in. sorry. and thanks to  urlLink jay  and  urlLink hawkins  for putting the soiree together. fucking hot shit! thanks to the guy in the suit who complimented my set. no thanks to the other guy in the suit who tried to dance with me. thanks to everyone else who just was there to have wicked good times! let's do it again sometime!  doug, dj, george, annie, sung bin and i were also jumping on the small stage at the tiki room and dancing to dennis and audrey's dj sets. they were playing some great dance tunes... i jumped out of my skin when dennis played pizzacato 5's "twiggy." i was going to play their song "magic carpet ride" but ran out of time. next time, folks, next time!   eric from  urlLink say hi to your mom  did a lovely solo set for a packed bar. it was awesome. he didn't play "hooplas..." but i still adore him. i'll hopefully have photos to post at some point for all of you who love to look at drunk people chugging from free beer and stuff. oh and do i have some footage of eric grooving to some of  urlLink dennis cahlo 's tunes? yes, i do. and peeps, audrey spun some wonderful tunes as well. they both rock in the dj booth. jay also spun some fun stuff as well. i was so siked to hear him spin the walkmen's "the rat!"  during the coarse of the night, i also met the dude who does  urlLink casa de punk , and then he just walked away from me... thanks for the chat, dude!   and then i talked with the boys from  urlLink other passengers  for a while and we all danced to that song from  dirty dancing  -- i think it's called "be my little baby"? it was awesome. we were so wasted. i haven't gotten that drunk in quite a while... you know, my tolerance is not that high but those pina coladas were sweet!  and then after the party, a bunch of us crammed into jay's car like we were clowns at a circus. i was so embarrassed but so tired that i didn't care that i was sitting on jay's lap in the front passenger seat hoping and praying that i wouldn't fall out of the window or that the cops wouldn't stop us kids in our tracks and ask us why we have so many fucking people in the car. hawkins is a wild driver. and dancer. s'wild!

       knife skills cuts you till you bleed    ohmygosh.  urlLink  knife skills   were so fucking tough last night. i have seen every one of this band's shows and last night was probably the best i've seen them. no joke. their songs are so tight with many swift shifts that my head was left dizzy. their new song, "vessels and streams," particularly surprised me. there were so many cool changes within the song that rawked so hard... and built up into a fierce bomb, exploding into my ears. the band played my personal favorite, "summer of teenage lust," which i plan on playing for y'all tonight when i try my hand at deejaying for the second time in my life. that song is so good!        afterwards, george and i headed over to jay's house and watched part of  24 Hour Party People . i didn't fall asleep this time like the first time i watched the film. perhaps because i only saw like 30 minutes of it or something.

       living in new york is $$$$$  read about  urlLink new york's ubermiddleclass  from the observer today. thanks, anna for sending this along. it's really true. living here, you walk out the door and automatically without thinking spend $20. last week i actually went to my ATM and it said, "insufficient funds." that was an eye-opener to my spending habits. now i am much more careful on how much money i withdraw and spend. that extra quarter for movie tix is always makes me huff.

TONIGHT, May 19 @ 9 p.m. sharp  urlLink  KNIFE SKILLS   @  urlLink Pianos  (Ludlow and Stanton on the Lower East Side)  oh and i forgot to mention that i can't stop listening to their song, "summer of teenage lust." i particularly love the lyric that gets stuck in your head: "if this isn't desperation... then i don't know what is." then the catchy-as-hell guitar part comes in and i'm totally hooked!!

       come on, let's go to sin-e to see pas/cal!    i got to see  urlLink pas/cal  for the second time in my life last night, and they were oodles of adorable splendor. i love everything about them, from their pink accented outfits to their nerdy glasses to their love of tambourines to caz' sweet and dear voice to their often goofy storytelling. this band makes this girl goofy and geeky, in a good way.    plus they have great matching shoes. word.  i was quite baffled by the huge turnout for openers,  urlLink elkland , who were like handsome boy modeling 16-year-olds covering erasure songs with their cute, swept-over 'dos... it seemed they brought their entire high school to the party as sin-e quickly filled up with people whooping and hollerin' for more more more... i swear one song sounded very similar to "total eclipse of the heart" as the lead singer held dearly onto the mic stand and sang, "i really need you tonight..." oddly enough, the crowd asked for more and the band gave a rather lackluster encore. i think, however, if i was 15 and starry-eyed and a total hag again, i would have LOVED them. i can totally picture them playing the roxy with a bunch of people dancing like crazy under the disco ball.    the more disappointing part was that most people left after elkland and missed  urlLink shelby , a musically superior band that swayed from gentle vocals to fierce rock-out explosions. they surprised me with their beautiful violin parts and the singer's exceptional, soaring voice. i want to see more of this band.  i didn't get to stay and see much of  urlLink soundtrak . someone told me that they were like U2, but i didn't see that comparison at all from the one song i heard. what did everyone else think?

       skateboarding... am i back in high school?    saturday was starting to be one of those days. i woke up with a hangover... throbbing headache. then i went shopping in the thick, sticky heat that was swelling feet in the city, and finally decided to make the trek into williamsburg to hang with ma' peeps. the catch of course is that this weekend the L train wasn't running at all. the mta should give us a refund on our unlimited metro card because it means nothing to me if i can't travel into wburg. wtf is up with that? it's such an isolating feeling.    as i was chilling out to my summer mix in my apt, joe called me and i decided to meet him at andreas' art opening at kcdc, a skateshop in brooklyn. anna and ryan decided to come with too. they were going to another art opening, where the theme of the night was anti-war. i don't know how i feel about the art i saw there. it seemed reactionary in a childish way that didn't really say much more than, "hey, you suck for making us go to war." i didn't feel inspired... i didn't feel  anything  other than  bored .     then we headed over to kcdc, and it started raining a lil' here and there. andreas' work is charming; perhaps i'm biased cuz i know him. but there were photos of friends, his mom and dad, and screens or paintings of sorts...and there was a live cockroach crawling on his "broken arm" piece. that was classic. his work at least made me smile.    i have to say, i haven't ever really been to a skate bowl before. when i was in high school, i really liked the idea of skateboarding and skateboarders. i wore big baggy pants and sneakers and band tee shirts... kind of like how i dress now actually. i was a total tomboy. so when i was watching the skaters on the ramp, i was completely fascinated, watching them go back and forth... trying to figure out what the skater ramp etiquette was. it was pretty entrancing to see a subculture like that at this point in my life. i felt like i was surrounded by 16 year olds. i got to see  urlLink andreas  and  urlLink chris  skate, though joe refrained. it's too bad, i wanted to photograph him on the ramp. thanks for the free beer, kcdc.  anyways it started pouring, and anna, ryan and joe and i headed over to pete's candy store where anna's friend alice was playing and goldenrod's new country cover band was playing. that was cool and chill. joe and i had walked in the rain, so we got there soaking from head to toe. but it was a fun walk nonetheless. at least for me. joe said he ruined his skateboard in the rain (apparently that is not good for skateboards). we hung at pete's for a while and listened to the music, which was good... country covers of rock music by the likes of journey... and other people. i recognized the songs but couldn't tell you what they were called or who they were by.   ok, the end.

       the giraffes @ sin-e    The night started out innocently enough. I met up with dave, who I now want to call pfeff, at a bar somewhere down the street from pianos. We hung out and drank for a little bit and then headed for sin-e to see  the giraffes , a band dave can't stop raving about. I have to say, there is something very intriguing about the mustached singer with the slicked hair. I got pulled into a van where the band was hanging out and drinking jim beam choice. The whiskey was smooth and strong. I think they made me take one too many sips. I remember saying hi to chris, dj and sung bin... The rest of the night was a drunken haze of loud loud LOUD music. But I have photos somewhere that I will hopefully post at some point. Hehe.

       diesel wha?    ok i went to see  urlLink au revoir simone  play at pianos last night -- met up with new friends dave and chris. the ARS girls were in top form last night and covered bruce springsteen's "dancing in the dark." hot shit!   more au revoir simone photos:            dave, chris and i headed over to the diesel party after their set, and on the way got the call from  urlLink cameron : there were too many people at the party and no one can get in. too bad we were already in a cab heading over. whatever! if you went to the party/show, tell me how it went? i also said hello to the  urlLink bishop allen  kids standing outside the show. they couldn't get in either. boo!  afterwards, dave went home (boo!) and chris and i hung out at alt cafe where mike was working. i had an iced coffee, and after i got home, i went right to sleep. coffee has no effect on me anymore. so sad!  this morning i put on moz's "do your best and don't worry" again and it made me feel so good. it's probably his most uplifting song ever, eh?  right now i am entranced with the  urlLink on!air!library!  cd. there's always been something in their moodiness that has caught my attention and my heart. ever since i saw them in that dank basement of cb's gallery with their million-part instrumentation and their haunting vocal melodies... and eery chords and sounds, i have been swept up in the rush of o!a!l!

       you give me fever    i went to  urlLink the fever  listening party last night for their upcoming album,  red bedroom . it was packed full of peeps, and you can't really beat $2 beer, unless of course it's free. songs like "labor of love" and "hexxxed" get me energized -- so much so that i felt my body moving, despite the comatose state my brain was in. as  urlLink miss modernage  has already stated, the album illustrates the band's diversity, and if possible, their songs are even catchier this time around than on their  pink on pink  ep. bravo, kids! if you haven't bought  urlLink tickets  to their record release show at bowery ballroom yet, you should grab them quick. i hear they're going fast!  i talked for a little bit with brian long, who manages  urlLink vhs or beta . you might also know him as the guy who put together the  yes new york compilation . he got me siked for the new vhs or beta album,  night on fire , where craig pfunder debuts his vocal artistry. he also talked about his experiences in the music industry and how he got into managing a band, which i thought was cool. i love to hear stories like that because it inspires me. the album comes out in a couple weeks... i'll let you know what i think of it when i get the cd.  holy mother of gosh. i am drinking a berry-lime  urlLink jamba juice  from the whole foods on columbus circle. it is so good! but a and were saying cherry-lime would have been infinitely better. just something to consider...

       movie aside  if you thought for a second that getting stoned and watching  urlLink  van helsing   was going to be a good idea, i can re-assure you ahead of time that it is NOT. thanks, joe...  after that horrible movie experience, george, joe and i meandered to the east east village to rue b, a saucy lil' bar on avenue b complete with a classy piano player. the place was kinda small, and i bumped into the piano player and made him mess up his song. sorry, kiddo! there we met up with a man by the name of daniel sasse (pronounced like that teen magazine of yore). i kid you not. what an amazing name to live up to... and peeps, he certainly did live up to that name. his talk was amazingly involved and strangely entrancing. i fell asleep on his couch for 15 minutes. but he made us amazing coffee in four minutes with a french press. we were impressed. and awake.  then george and i, newly awakened, wandered over to pianos, where the shins and any number of other comedian and celebrity hipster types were all sipping on clear cocktails with limes and chillin' after the big bowery ballroom show. i heard their gig with moz on friday night was splendid! as was SNL with the olsen twins and their bowery gig with the hold steady -- as DT put it, "their best show i've seen them in ever which includes about 20 shows or so." wow, big praise!  my dj gig went fine, and it was so much fun to spin music that i like listening to. i'll be spinning again with  urlLink miss melody nelson  at a huge listening party with  urlLink dirty on purpose ,  urlLink the thermals ,  urlLink say hi to your mom , catheter and more that jay good times is putting together. that kid has so much love for music, it makes me inspired. save the date: may 20! check the  urlLink on the moon music  calendar for details as they develop!

       so what am i doing tonight? hmmm....   well for the first time ever, i'm going to try my hand at deejaying. i'm really terrified, but i have this need to share the music i love with people. and since i don't have a cd burner anymore to make and send mix CDs, i figured DJing was the next best way to do it. what is cool is that i'm getting to do it with one of my faves,  urlLink mike greensleeves ! the other day we came up with an amazing playlist (just an outline, i'm planning on throwing in a few surprises here and there), and i realized mike and i are PERFECT dj partners because our tastes in music are so similar, but our catalogue of music is just different enough to make it interesting for the both of us.  if you don't happen to be going to the moz/shins extravaganza, come party with me! despite what you might have heard,  urlLink the hook  is incredibly easy to get to by way of car or cab --  and if you turn in your cab receipt at the bar, you get a free drink!  the hook is also a wonderful place to see some good rock, the sound is amazing and the space is really impressive. here are the deets for the gig tonight (this is what i posted on  urlLink friendster :   COME SEE ME DEEJAY, PLEASE!   For those of you NOT attending the Moz/Shins extravaganza on Friday, let me tell you about another exciting New York rock event... Uh, yeah, the debut of me as a deejay. Are you titillated yet? Thought so.  Yes, I'm still a deejay virgin, but gosh darnit, don't you want to be there when I pop my turntable cherry? I feel like you'll like listening to the music I'm going to spin with my partner-in-rawk for the night, DJ Greensleeves, or as I like to refer to him, Mike from Winter Pageant. Ahem.  We're also deejaying with Sam from  urlLink Interpol  and Audrey from  urlLink Melodynelson.com . Plus, some really cool local bands are playing:  urlLink Qatsi ,  urlLink Other Passengers ,  urlLink The Big Sleep  and Feast.  We plan to bring it awwwn, so put on your rock shoes and cab it over to the Hook ( urlLink www.thehookmusic.com ) this Friday night, May 7. Come on, we know you wanna. Mike and I start the music from 9 to 10 and again around midnight right before Feast go on.   DIRECTIONS:  Here's how to get there from the city. Save your cab receipt for a free drink at the bar! + Take the Brooklyn Bridge + Make a right onto Atlantic under the BQE + Left onto Columbia + Right onto Degraw + Go left and stop + Left on to Van Brunsik + Left on to Commerce + and it's between Richards and Columbia.  See how easy it is? Plus, you will get some free hugs from moi for coming.   xoxo jinners

       coffee and cigarettes  lately, i've really taken to hanging out in coffee shops instead of bars. the bar scene gets tired after repeated exposure, though i still love going out for a smokey smoke. i'm also tired of drinking, after a week-long respite from alcohol, last night i had a drink at 2a with  urlLink joe  and gary, who made their first appearance in my new hood! i was actually about to go to bed when i got the call at 1 in the morning from joe. and i was like, "when is joe  ever  in my nabe?" never! so i need to hang with him while his jokey ass is here. hanging with joe is like laughing in spring time. joyous as he's a primo comedian who likes to greet me in a lovely british accent: 'ello, jin! where's my gin? gary is his best friend from erie, who is probably one of the nicest, down to earth guy i've met. we all talked about how in erie, $5 for a beer is simply preposterous. yeah i said it, preprosterous. let's just say that they tip with quarters in erie -- that's how cheap the beer is!  there we met up with  urlLink jay  and  urlLink noah  (happy double-two birthday!) jay had just seen the bouncing souls and was wearing a cute green cap, his lip piercing still in place. i'm surprised the ruffians at the concert hadn't ripped that off. noah was sufficiently drunk, and told me he was going to the moz/shins show tonight. i'm utterly jealous.

       dear peeps  Sorry I have been slack on the updating of my adventures in nyc. Does anyone besides my friends even read this site?   Anyhoo, there's been TONS of stuff going on lately in my night life except when I'm at work I can't do a proper blogger update cuz I've been swamped with award show writing at work. Believe it or not, part of my job is to write bios of award winners and also even writing the entire script for the different genre award shows we have at work. I'm no bruce vilanche, but I do learn a lot of stuff about various artists along the way. Working for a songwriters organization is definitely a learning experience for me, plus it's been fun getting to know the ins and outs of the biz.  What's bad is that in my outings I've taken to smoking a lot more. This is a result of hanging out more with smokers. I'm what u might call a social or stress smoker. I smoke in social sitches or when I'm super stressed. Lately I've been both stressed and social -- so double the smoking! U know what though? I like it.  Hanging with  urlLink DoP  has also caused me to love bbq'ing. When u know someone with a backyard and they like cookouts and the weather is warm, then it's all good. This weekend is gonna be a double picnic extravaganza with erika's birthday on saturday in mckarren park and deron and katy's birthday on sunday in central park. Cross your fingers for sunshine! I'm reading to chill out on blankets and grass.  I'm also getting really excited about deejaying this friday at the hook, even though I think some of my close friends and others I haven't seen in a while won't be able to make it. Things like scheduling things in support of each other is really tough, especially if your friends work in the music biz. I know I constantly feel bombarded with shows and dj gigs of friends and since I can't be in two or three or four places at once or sometimes I'm just plain tired, I miss a gig here or two. Please forgive me if this happens. I still love u and your band, and will keep trying to catch you. Many of my friends have band practice or are in the recordiing studio or have to catch their other friend's gig or have some kind of birthday party to go to. Life in new york seems to revolve around everything like that and the buzz of the city is built on this "busy as a bee" syndrome.   I think I have come up with a bunch of key songs that I want to spin on friday. I will post more details on the dj gig, complete with directions to the venue. I would love to see your adorable face there to eat up the fantastic mix of delectable music morsels I plan on feeding u. Woohoo!

       the paper chase & we ragazzi @ north six while most people were probably getting totaled at the les savy fav craziness at volume on friday night, anna and i zoomed on our bikes over to north six to check out her friend's band the paper chase from dallas/denton texas. isn't everyone from denton these days? we got there in the middle of their set, but just in time to hear my favorite song, "don't you wish you had some more." unfortunately though, there weren't that many people there. i still enjoyed watching them create their spastic set, complete with sound effects, guitar, bass, drums and keys. it was hot and sweaty, just the way i like my friday night rock. if the band isn't dripping with sweat, they didn't try hard enough, you know?  i had never seen we ragazzi before either, and this three-piece was definitely interesting. anna says the lead singer sings like prince, but what fascinated me about the band was the kick-ass drummer girl. not only did she hit those drums hard, she did it with such a unique style. it was tough and forceful without being out of control. though their songs started to sound more and more the same, i did like what i heard... and am curious to hear more -- hopefully more diverse songs from this band.   celebrate brooklyn! neil young tribute @ prospect park on saturday it was a beautiful day. i got a call from annie asking if i wanted to ride our bikes over to prospect park for the neil young tribute. i was game. annie brought the scrabble board and made this delicious picnic for us. we were zooming along, and about three-fourths of the way to the park, the chain on my bike broke. it was so sad. i abandoned the chain on the street (r.i.p) and we walked our bikes the rest of the way there.   we were quite early and stood in line to get into the concert. half of the time we were trying to figure out how we were going to sneak our wine inside. they were checking bags... shit! annie stashed the wine in the bushes near the fence... we thought we would go get it later when we were safely inside. doug and his friends from north carolina met up with us a little bit later. we found out they snuck two bottles of wine in. and we went to fetch our stashed wine. i had kind of a headache and decided not to drink. i was quite impressed that at the end of the night, annie, doug and the gang had finished up the wine! drunks!  annie and i slowly played scrabble as people walked by and commented on our game. people would say thinks like, "is 'liven' a word?" we'd reply, "why yes it is." the concert was pretty bad. though cat power, iron & wine and ron sexsmith i thought were good, most of the people who played were just plain awful... kind of a massacre.   while there, i ran into dt, noah, josh, sean and robin. they were all there just hanging and of course representing for iron & wine. hotness. dt said he never heard sam beam sing the way he was singing at the tribute. it was more of a country style of singing. it was good though. as that crew rolled out, i stayed and hung out a lil longer with annie and co. we took the train home and luckily doug's friend helped me carry my bike home (thanks dude!). overall it was just a nice day spent in a beautiful park. i heart new york!!!   lazy sundays i woke up the next morning to go and fix my bike chain. there was this obnoxious texas family in line in front of me, just completely boasting their richness. the dad was buying bikes for his two daughters, who were in their 20s. they kind of gave off spoiled vibes as their dad paid for their $450 bikes. the cashier guy was like, it will probably take a couple weeks to get the bikes made, but don't scream if it's a little longer. the dad replied, "oh don't you worry. they'll definitely scream."  after i got my bike fixed, i rode over to mckarren park. met up with doug and annie again. we tried to go over to pete's candy store, but it wasn't open yet. so we bought a bunch of stuff to make dacquairis (spelling?) and also a kiddie wading pool to fill with water. it was pretty awesome. we dipped our feet in the pool and got drunk on dacqairis and mojitos. yummy! somehow i rode home drunk in the dark, totally buzzed on the wonderfully relaxing sunday. i love weekends like that!   a little extra something-something   urlLink if you're bored and feel like starting a restaurant, here's how to pitch your restaurant to the mayor.

       my awesome roommate anna    i read a lot of blogs... and everyone always talks about their cool roommates, so i figured, i should start doing it too, so i can be wholly awesome.   ok, so let me tell you about my roommate, anna. i met her about two years ago, so unsuspectingly. i used to be the music editor for  urlLink a teen website , but i was also responsible for posting content on other sections of the site, like a fashion column called "dig or dis," where we took clothing from our delias-like catalog and posted it on the site with some cutesy question like -- floral tank: wilted or in bloom? and the kids would post their thoughts on the java board. most of the time they just talked about how the model's boobs were too big or too small or too fat. it was the stupidest thing ever, but i had to take one of my skinny coworkers each week and take like 7 photos of her wearing various clothing from our catalog. anna was working as a receptionist on the floor where all the fitting rooms were. we instantly connected as we laughed about my ridiculous job. she suggested i write for  urlLink venus zine ,  urlLink popmatters  and  urlLink kitty magik  instead... and eventually i did.     hearing i was the music editor of the site, she talked about her band,  urlLink knife skills . they were going to play their first show soon. i told her i would check them out. around that time i was throwing a mod party at my apartment, and invited her to come check it out. i didn't think she'd actually come. i didn't think anyone would come. it was raining horribly that night. but people did, anna included. from then on, we became really great friends as we started to hang out more and more.   her boyfriend, deron, now her hubby, was working sound at a club called luxx in williamsburg. i kept reading these huge articles about luxx and the whole electroclash thing. it was around the same time i started to dig the walkmen and basically the entire  urlLink startime records  catalog because my friend miker was doing the website and an old college acquaintance isaac ran the label. i started to hang out with her and deron at various rock shows.     i started to meet tons of people, including members of the asian rock jury (pictured above). i started listening to a bunch of cool bands i'd never heard of before. i started taking photos at shows. then i started a blog. she introduced me to music like turing machine, vaz, les savy fav, bishop allen, the new humans, the big sleep, on!air!library!, semiautomatic... most recently paper chase.   she introduced me to vegan food, and i dig her tofu and her vegan Magnolia-like cupcakes. she makes me more politically aware than i would be on my own. she helped me start my own monthly  urlLink On the Moon Music Presents...  party at Luxx, which I stopped doing soon after Vicious took off because booking shows stopped being fun. She encouraged me when I decided to start managing  urlLink a band .     she introduced me to my long-lost cousin,  urlLink slim moon !  usually people are never around for my birthday because it's two days before christmas, but anna (along with my ex) managed to round up all of my friends and throw a karaoke party for me... two years in a row. last year, she and i went to chinatown together to buy dumplings for the party. it was pretty spectacular, and made me feel loved.   she's also one of the only girls i know who can do high kicks. she also sings that "thank you for coming to loews. sit back, relax, enjoy the show!" song and dance better than lindsay lohan. she's also the toughest female rock star i know. just check out this photo. too many girls these days just want to look fucking cute and coy. anna is badass. she screams. she writes menacing guitar lines. she tells jokes in between songs. she writes great lyrics. she's BADASS and not afraid to show it.  And then when I had basically nowhere else to go, she let me move into her apartment. i've since come to adore lucy, the stray cat she and deron adopted. and this weekend, she and deron are adopting a dog named nikita from mighty mutts. are there people our age who do caring things like that and are so giving of their time and love? not many. plus, she plays scrabble with me. She's pretty fucking awesome, and one of the coolest people i know.

       don't you wish you had some more    i went to see  urlLink french kicks  play bloomies soho yesterday... it was kinda weird. but my love for them is so strong, i ignored all of the weirdness, danced, sang along and had a great time. free shows are always awesome. they played mostly stuff from the new album, including my favorite, "one more time," and also a couple oldies, including "close to modern." here's a  urlLink video clip  of them playing "close to modern." btw, their drummer is amazing. mike, byron and i tried to drink the non-existent "cocktails". after some foraging, we found stella served in wine glasses. some people were walking around with trays of bread. tons of cute indie rock kids showed up. i think only one girl was full-on dancing and singing. indeed, we need to teach the indie rock kids how to dance. stop thinking you're too cool to dance. how can you not dance to french kicks? they're so damn catchy. shame on you.          cass mccombs and iron & wine @ maxwell's i got a last minute invite to the sold-out cass mccombs and iron & wine show at maxwell's. the last time i went to maxwell's (in hoboken) was to see the walkmen. i swore after my treacherous commute to and fro, i would never go back to maxwell's. but there i was, taking the path train, heading out to jersey on a thursday night. but c'mon, cass mccombs canceled all of his new york dates and this was his only area show for a while. dt and i got there in the middle of cass's set... cass was wearing some kind of eyeshadow and his brand new band had a guy wearing a dress like he just came from some hippie festival. i thought, uh oh. while they did mostly play fast songs, cass did play a couple of my faves: "aids in africa" and "not the way." so beautiful.     i have to say that this is my first time hearing or seeing  urlLink iron & wine  in concert. and boy was i looking forward to it. the band did not disappoint. their songs were so soft and sweet and pure -- probably the most sincere music i've ever heard. ever. the lead singer, sam, had this voice that was like a soft whisper in your ear, incredibly intimate. it gave me shivers. i just closed my eyes and swayed to the music. i found out that i had seen the drummer's other band last week. he also plays in a band called teen wheat who played with circle and square last week at lit. iron and wine and teen wheat are total opposites as far as musical styles, so it just goes to show you that you can use music to express your creativity in oh so many ways.

       can we say, astrobi seksu!?    wow,  urlLink asobi seksu  put on a great performance last night. i was impressed with their live show -- their songs really come alive... especially with their strobe light endings, though that got a bit epileptic after a while -- for one or two songs, it's a great effect, but after four or five, i start seeing dots and dots and dots... yuki looks like she's in the throes of ecstasy on stage. she just kind of throws her head back and closes her eyes. i wish there were more songs with james on vocals too. he's got a great voice that kind of reminds me of the mink lungs. hot damn!      urlLink mellowdrone  exceeded my expectations. i had only seen jonathan bates do his solo mellowdrone thang before, but this time it was pretty awesome -- the sound is obviously much fuller with a band backing him and his wild stage antics. his voice travels from sweet jeff buckley-like notes to low sexy drawls -- and it all seems so effortless for his skinny ass. i've never seen someone that skinny. he kind of threw his slim frame all over the stage, pushing mic stands over, stumbling over himself and then finally at the end just falling onto the floor in front of the drums. very mellow-dramatic.    and for those of you who stayed for  urlLink au revoir simone , i know you were not disappointed. the girls put on a solid show with their dreamy soft melodies. and they looked pretty cute while showing off their catchy fast songs and then falling into their more numbing, romantic electronic ballads. they get better and better every time!   sidenote:  dude the line from the killers outside mercury lounge was just ridiculous. it was a mile long, and full of "hipsters." are you a hipster? get in line, right here. haha.   oh my, that billboard scandal ok i've met keith girard a couple times through my job (most recently at sxsw), so when i'm reading about  urlLink this huge billboard scandal , it's even crazier!   According to the formal complaint, "gender and race-based discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliatory firings, intra-office sabotage, and other wrongdoing ... took place in the offices of the music industry's leading trade publication."  The complaint adds that Girard and Chang "found themselves in a newsroom culture in which corporate management readily sacrificed editorial integrity for the sake of financial interests, [and] sexual philandering among senior and junior-level staff members was not only condoned but encouraged."  "Schlager frequently and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks to Chang of a sexual and/or erotic nature. ... During all relevant times, Schlager maintained a green phallic vibrator, of the type normally intended for sexual use, in full view on a shelf in his office. On at least three occasions, Schlager removed the vibrator from the shelf and showed it to Chang, and on at least one of these occasions he turned the vibrator on to show Chang that it still worked."

       wtf is wrong with this world?   honestly, right now, i can give two shits that lollapalooza is canceled. i couldn't care less about bill clinton's best-selling memoir. why? because this world is just  urlLink totally fucked up . terrorism is spreading to attack all parts of the world. and we're boo-hooing about not being able to see moz and the pixies while some mother and father across the world is crying over the beheading of their son. i feel so helpless. i feel sad. wtf? anna says this is the beginning of a new world war, and that thought scares the shit out of me. why is there so much hate in the world? can't we all do something to make each other feel good? god, it's so frustrating.

       is clear channel evil enough to pull the plug on lollapalooza?  from a listserv somewhere: We had a couple rentals for Lollapalooza (our business specializes in renting vans to touring musicians) and of course this is a big setback for us. From what I have heard the main problem wasn't ticket sales (Major markets were doing just fine, and Baltimore was already sold out). It was that Clear Channel decided they didn't want to support what is basically a liberal festival. With organizations like MoveOn.org doing major promotions over the whole tour (which in turn were being documented by VH-1 for a series) Clear Channel decided to pull the plug. Without Clear Channel there was no place to play, since as we all know, they own or control almost every large venue able to accommodate a festival of this size. The promoters aren't saying anything because they have to do business with these guys, but that's the back story as I heard it.

       the paper chase & foreign sounding bands  i can't stop watching  urlLink this video  for  urlLink the paper chase . can't wait to see their nervous, twisted rock at  urlLink north six  on friday (june 25). they're playing with  urlLink we ragazzi , another band i've been meaning to check out, but my plans just never work out. all the stars are aligned this friday though. you should come out too! that is if you're not planning on  urlLink les savy fav  and  urlLink q and not u  at  urlLink volume  or  urlLink iron & wine  at  urlLink bowery  or  urlLink enon  and  urlLink mellowdrone  at  urlLink rothko  or  urlLink saintface  at  urlLink sin-e . holy shit! too many choices.   UPDATE:  I forgot to mention another great show on Wednesday, June 23 @ rothko. Some of my favorite bands are playing it: Local faves  urlLink Asobi Seksu  (which means "play sex" in Japanese -- rawr!) and  urlLink Au Revoir Simone  (i believe that is a peewee's playhouse reference? anyhoo, these four ladies are dreamy electronic pop) and  urlLink Mellowdrone  (who i've only seen solo, but he's amazing and i can't wait to see the full band play!)  let's also not forget  urlLink sam champion  (very reminiscent of one of my faves, pavement) at luna lounge (free show!) on thursday, june 24, with  urlLink these bones , who do a funny cover of britney spears' "toxic." show starts at 10...  or if you get a chance, my friend jumee's friend, miho hatori, who used to be in cibo matto is playing solo at pianos at 9 on thursday, june 24. one of anna's friend's band,  urlLink the quick fix kills , are also playing that show.

       is this what touring life will be like?     urlLink dop  did a double show this weekend, one in  urlLink jersey , one in  urlLink nyc . as we are currently booking a tour right now, we got a little taste of touring life with the trek to good ol' passaic. passaic is in the middle of nowhere. we all hopped in a van with  urlLink the girlfriends , and happily zoomed on over to jersey. we found out that, as expected, dj is a swervey and aggressive driver. i thought we were going to die. but as the trip went on, he got better, so i guess practice makes perfect.   we ate dinner at some sporty bar that had like 10 big screen TVs, and one of the nicest waitresses ever. there was a dj who was pumping all this techno dance music from the 90s. i felt like i was in some kind of time warp. even the CVS was playing wilson phillips from the radio. sung bin ran around with a rubber lobster on her head, and annie and i perused the makeup aisle. yes, suburban life is this boring!    when we played the dead disco party at loop lounge (which is like the tiswas or misshapes of jersey), we were happy to see that the crowd was really receptive to us, including the local band that followed us,  urlLink mynuskris  (pronounced "minus chris" -- as in minus this guy kris who left the band). the party promoters todd and geoff were also totally sweet guys, and that made us feel good about playing a show in some area that definitely needed some good music to pass through. we were pumped to play our set, thinking it would be a great warm up show for the mercury lounge show the next day in new york. we were right. the set flowed beautifully, and dop were charged. and we left jersey. home sweet home!   the next day, i was feeling pretty rough. riding around in the back of a van with a bunch of amps and people isn't exactly my idea of comfort, but it was fun. my back was aching and my head was feeling heavy. i tried to chill out for most of the day to psyche myself up for the evening's show. it was part of a  urlLink karipalooza  celebration of one girl's awesomeness in the music scene. hot stuff. i especially love supporting other girlies in the scene, we all gotsta stick together, ya heard? the mercury lounge show promised to be excellent with its hyped up bill: dennis cahlo's new band, the sons of sound, benzos, the band kari manages, and the bravery (or rather, flock of seagulls!). the early part of the night boasted kick-ass rock, while the latter part of the night summoned tripped-up dance music.    dennis's new three-piece band,  urlLink the sons of sound , completely blew me away. i had no idea what to expect, but i didn't expect the bold pairing of gentle jeff buckley vocals with such dark, badass music. wow! the textured sounds of two guitars and one forceful drummer is just explosive. i can't wait for their next show! i can't help but say it though... i will miss how dennis's solo stuff made me want to cry and yearn for sweet, beautiful things. is that cheesey? sorry i'm so completely bridget jonesin on you.    i love anytime george breaks out the bow in dop songs. i don't know how he makes it sound so beautiful and pure, but his bowed guitar parts simply soar over the crowd and makes my heart pitter patter with such sadness. i also loved that doug stood up front for "cheat death" three part vocal harmonies.   the band started with such a rockin' song -- "mind blindness" with a special extended ending that gets so fucking loud without losing any momentum or catchiness. they also debuted that brand new song, "your summer dress," which joe sings on -- his voice is such a trip, but i love its strange, sweet quality. it's almost other worldly.  there were these kids dancing up front like it was a fatboy slim "praise you" video. it was totally cracking me up. those dances were worse than elaine's from  seinfeld . yikes!!! all in good fun though. all in good fun. ok this post is getting way too long.  i finally met  urlLink mr. coolfer  himself! i was so excited when i found out his blog name was taken from slang used by his friends, as in when your friends eat half of your meal, you say, "coolfer eating my meal, dickhead." hotness!   another slang term to add is my friend katy's new one. she was walking into our apartment building one day and the kids outside pointed to her and said, "that's my type. smell it." ahahahahaha!

       hooplas involving circus tricks  apparently rachel trachtenburg couldn't make the show last night at north six because she was being interviewed by vh1 or something. after dop practice, we all went over to say hi to eric and the  urlLink say hi to your mom  gang. we thought we'd slip in just in time for shtym's set, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. we suffered through the last half of  jason trachtenburg 's solo show... the absence of rachel's cute face was thick in the air, as we all tried to patiently listen to jason mutter out long, drawn out, seemingly directionless stories... he seemed to nervous, i felt so bad for him... but it also pained me to listen to it. so much so that i couldn't help but laugh out of nervousness for him. oh.my.gosh. poor guy.  then some kind of funk band whose bassist had this blue light up flashing ring came on stage... and we all knew we had to leave. pizza run. we ran into billy from other passengers there, chomping away on a slice. this town feels more and more like family as time goes by.   we eventually said bye to billy and wandered back to north six. eric finally went on stage super late, but we enjoyed the set nonetheless. i was barely conscious because of my lack of sleep these days. but hearing eric sing "super" is nice and reassuring that someone else in the world holds the same sarcastic sense of humor that i do. word.    back to band practice though. i don't know why, but i am addicted to going to band practice. i think that i miss dop when i don't see them at practice for like a week. having such access to their music and their creative process is an amazing privilege that i take advantage of as much as possible. i see them develop. i see them grow. i see them create amazing songs. i feel like a mother, proud of her children's accomplishments. the beautiful sounds start to envelope me, and i can't help but smile. it's so fucking good! i took some video of them practicing dj's new song, which joe sings on. his voice is so sad and beautiful. the song is so goddamn catchy.   urlLink watch them here and see for yourself!   [warning: it will take you a while to download, even on high speed, but it's worth it.]

       surrender, surrender! rock and roll still exists in nyc    it's been quite a while since i've been to a rock show and had a beer bottle thrown at me, but it happened last night at  the blue sparks cd release party  by miss alanna. it came out of nowhere and splattered all over near the bar of sin-e. craziness! all in good rock/n/roll fun! it's always a good night when you spend some time at home washing the beer from your face, and the ink from your hands.  in case you don't know,  urlLink the blue sparks  are down and gritty rock and roll that splatters (like a hurled budweiser) with tough spastic fun. it's pretty amazing how tight they are, and i especially love when phil rocks it out on the guitar. he seems so innocuous, but that boy just rips out the demon when he's on stage. in an adorable way, of course! they just pound their guitars, and i don't know how their strings aren't all in pieces right now.   i really liked their entire set, but the old song they pulled out at the begging of john martin was pretty amazing. jo tells me it's an old blue sparks song, but a classic, called "tell me whatcha want." that song is so good, i thought it was a cover song! it's the kind of old school rock song that makes you want to go crazy and scream along, "tell me whatcha want! i want i want i want! tell me whatcha need! i need i need i need!" sooooooo fucking good. i'm officially an addict.     wolfbait  (which of course was  urlLink the fever  playing cover songs) played some goodies too, including: ** hall and oates' "maneater" ** r. kelly's "ignition" ** cheap trick's "surrender"  i'm also happy to report that  urlLink geremy 's hair is lookin' better than ever. word.  this was all  urlLink witnessed  by a lovely group of  urlLink sweet   urlLink hot   urlLink familiar   urlLink peeps . so much raw goodness. i fucking heart new york.    another great band i saw last night was  urlLink other passengers . this band just gets better and better each time i see them. their dark, despondent lyrics and overwhelming compositions swallow me up into some kind of abysmal black hole. just amazing, and quite heart-stopping live.

       new slang (for me) some people i've recently met have been saying some funny slang that is new to me. i thought i'd share them so that you could laugh with me:  mika, christy's gf, is originally from japan. when we were all hanging out at snacky's, she suddenly turned to dj and said, "why you so dick?"  my co-worker jeremy (you may see him spreading around ascap earplugs at the vicious events) has a couple great sayings. if he wants to ask you if you're interested in certain things, he'll say, "do you fuck with that?" and when he wants to communicate that he's tired, he will say, "i'm so assed out."  when my friend mike likes something he'll either say, "hot shit!" or "that's the jam!"   so anyhoo, what kind of funny slang phrases do your friends sling around?

       a shady lane, everybody wants one  this past weekend was not only filled with lots of weary moments, but my housemates and i watched two documentaries:  spellbound  and  capturing the friedmans .    spellbound  was entertaining, but i thought it would be more intense. the kids in it were so cute, and some of those words were damn tricky. the sweat pouring down their foreheads, the biting of the lips, the utter fear of blanking out cringing out of their eyes.... we always knew that vocab tests in school were always so damn nerve-racking, but imagine taking that test in front of cameras and hundreds of parents. yikes! the one lesson i learned from this movie:  bee happy.    capturing the friedmans ... i really didn't know what i was in for when i decided i wanted to watch this film. and to think that it all started because the filmmaker was profiling new york's #1 clown... who turned out to have some not-so-funny family drama going on. as the story unfolded, i became utterly horrified. then i was confused. then i was like, wtf is wrong with these people? hello, your father is a child molester.  geez us!   in the unbearable heat, there is one song that always makes me happy. i love pavement's "shady lane". sing along with me:  Blind date with the chancer we had oysters and dry lancers when the check when it arrived we went dutch, dutch, dutch, dutch a redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash And this emory board is giving me a rash I'm flat out You're so beautiful to look at when you cry Freeze, don't move You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life.  A shady lane -- everybody wants one A shady lane -- everybody needs one Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god Oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god The worlds collide, but all that we want is a shady lane  Glance, don't stare Soon you're being told to recognize your heirs No, not me -- I'm an island of such great complexity Stress surrounds in the muddy peaceful center of this town Tell me off in the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the over-friendly concierge  A shady lane -- everybody wants one A shady lane -- everybody needs one Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god Oh my god, oh your god, oh his god, oh her god It's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god, it's everybody's god The worlds collide, but all that I want is a shady lane.

       calling all book worms!  i wish there was a book club called "great books for people who love music." i would totally join that club.    the last book i finished reading was called  urlLink  drinking: a love story   by caroline knapp. it was one of the most depressing books i've had to page through, and as i was reading it, i felt like i was also going through many of the trials and tribulations with drinking recounted in the book. the book is actually caroline's memoir on her bout with alcoholism. now i know we all like to consider ourselves alcoholics, but caroline went through some major drinking episodes that make mine seem like some sort of pathetic joke. she would drink before going to work, right after work. hide bottles in back porches. drink entire bottles of wine and replacing them so that no one would know... she drank to deal with pain. she drank to not feel anything. she drank just for the sake of drinking. it was like a nervous habit. some of us bite our nails. caroline fucking drank until she would pass out and not remember anything. reading this book made me realize that i was definitely not an alcoholic, though my love affair is quite coquettish.  now i'm thinking of picking up caroline's other book,  urlLink  appetite: why women want  . why? because i wanna find out why.   i'm also trying to get through  the corrections . but sometimes it's so fucking boring. granted it certainly has moments of brilliance, but then i get to another chapter and the story goes from somewhat interesting to just plain dull. i was quite attracted to the story however. it's about a family from pennsylvania that is totally dysfunctional. the absolute struggle to get family together, even at the most stressed times. the basic outline plot reminded me of my own family and how disparate everyone is. i think much of my frustrations as a person is partially due to the fact that i don't have much of a family structure to fall back on. i don't have the close bonds. i don't often feel the compulsion to call my familly. not to say that i don't love them, but some of them drive me up the wall. they are quick to criticize me, and i often think my somewhat chronic bouts with depression are because of all the fucked up ideas they have instilled in my head about myself. i was never skinny enough. sometimes not smart enough, though most of the time my academic life was the only thing they ever showed approval of. i was never girly enough. blah blah blah.  the corrections  covers all of that fucked up nonsense about families and their ability to both support and tear apart each other. hopefully i will plow through this soon and move on to another book... but i'm kind of infamous for reading multiple books at once. judging by my past posts, maybe i should read jonathan franzen's  how to be alone . ha.  any other recommendations?

       to lost souls everywhere  i feel like i'm perpetually caught in limbo. i feel inexplicably sad. i feel lonely. this is partly due to my recent singleton status, i know. when you're in a couple, you don't mind other couples so much. you don't mind the fact that all of your other single friends constantly hook up with other single friends or make out with random strangers, whatever. you don't mind being on your own every once in a while. then you read things like  urlLink this , and it makes you kind of sad. girls are fucked up. boys are fucked up. and together, they manage to fuck each other up real good. what the hell?  in my new single life, i'm finding that being alone sucks. and what's even more interesting is that in my new digs, i find myself living with a married couple, who are nice peeps and all, but hell, they are newly married. they are a unit. it's sweet, but weird for me.   my new bedroom is what i call "the bat cave." i climb up these creaky, wooden stairs to get to my bat cave. at night when the door is closed, i am swallowed in darkness. and i pass out and dream strange dreams, most of which i can't recall anymore. this past weekend, i found myself in a terrible mood, and i just couldn't get out of bed. i slept all day saturday, then finally ventured out of my bedroom around 7 p.m. granted i went out to support au revoir simone at trash and bishop allen at the tank, but then the next day, i walked around like a zombie yet again. i felt incredibly woozy and unwell. my head was pounding. i was nauseous. i passed out around 7:30 p.m. and didn't awaken again until well past noon the next day.  i was suddenly sick.  steadily since then i've been feeling better, and i appreciate everyone who has shown concern. i'm alright. it's kind of amazing how powerful our minds are. if we are unhappy, then we sort of react physically to our emotions. i feel sort of lost right now. it's probably the norm for all people in their 20's but in this town, who has time to fuck around like this? not i. and so i solider on, trying to ignore everything that makes life so miserable for us young ones. in the grand scheme, things like that don't matter much. and like i said, i'm trying not to be emo. i'm trying to look on the brighter side of things. i'm trying to be optimistic and avoid cynicism.

       midnight cravings  you know when the clock is nearing midnight, and then a friend calls you and asks you to go for a drink? yeah, that's mike. he was done band practice and was in my hood. i went to meet him at snacky's. i later found out he thought i said spanky's. teehee.   he's one of those dudes who are really easy to talk to and totally sweet and honest about everything. he's the first guy friend i've had in a while who i felt like i could just talk about everything with. he's the best fucking friend! i haven't seen him since i moved out of the east village. so it was good to see him in my hood! i heard that he got into an accident, and it was totally freaking me out! i had not heard from him for about a week, and already something crazy, life-changing happens! time is fucking crazy like that sometimes.   we had so much fun just talking, drinking sake and beer, eating korean bbq beef and peanut chili wontons and watching the kung fu movies on the tv. snacky's is the best! thanks for the good talk, mike. we gal pals certainly appreciate.

       the slow century  i feel like these days, i'm totally into slowing it down. for the past couple of years, i've lived fast. heck, for the past 7 years in new york, i've lived fast. But night after night of hanging out at rock clubs with earplugs and the search for free liquor can be quite taxing. i've never been one to limit my experiences like that, but these days nothing compels me too much. except for things that are free because i've become quite broke.   going to a rock show? probably not unless i'm on the list. this makes me sad as i desperately want to attend lollapalooza and see moz and the pixies. i'm talking,  a lot . but not only would i have to take two days off of work, i'd also have to shell out like $90 on tickets and probably another however much on transportation. rock and roll is like my drug and all, but seriously, this habit can get quite expensive on a big scale. perhaps that's why i try to keep most of my show experiences on the smallish, local level.   with all of the work that i do end up doing in the music industry, sometimes i feel like i don't get enough back to sustain the lifestyle. i envy all of the rich kids who have the support of their parents and can afford to do whatever their little hearts desire. i, on the other hand, need to balance everything out with a full-time job. it's a tough thing to juggle in this twisted economy. but c'est la vie! c'est la rock/n/roll!   i've also always thought that i wanted to be a writer, and a part of me still does. but things can get discouraging in this day and age. i feel like many others get the chance to do things that i can only dream of doing... for one reason or another. mostly because my tastes are not very mainstream. that was one thing i learned from interning at  entertainment weekly . i despise mainstream stuff most of the time. it's too manufactured and not raw enough for me. thus my life is not mainstream, and the opportunities that present themselves to me are all lowly funded indie projects. but the awesome thing is that i believe in everything i do, and i don't think that i get swayed into writing and believing things that are simply trendy or buzzworthy. anything that i support really does have some weight (in my opinion). it's not all dressed up in purdy bows and ties. it's real. it's meaty. it's something precious to me. it's not a paid-for-commercial. i hope you get that sense of me.

       tangmonkey knows where it's at  here's a cool review from sean of  urlLink tangmonkey.com . thanks for the kind words, dude!  Dirty on Purpose - "Mind Blindness". Vibrant shoegaze pop from a NYC band that knows to blend haze with clarity, summer somnolescence with a young autumn's skip-run-and-fly. (cf. my jeans feel a bit tight, think i washed them a bit too high. i was gonna be late, so i picked up my pace to run.) There are sighs and interlaced vocals, dream guitars, a touch of Yo La Tengo earnesty, but then the brilliant bristling sprint of Doves or "Where The Streets Have No Name". Lots of bands strain to reach this kind of place - Torrez, Tiger Saw, heck, Mercury Rev, - but here's a group that not only has the mood, it's got the soaring, spaceship hook. Marvellous. (To top it off - I'm told they like Os Mutantes.) From the sleekly-packaged  Sleep Late For A Better Tomorrow  EP.

       stop fucking around things have been quite hectic for me this week, in more ways that one and for all of my friends, i dearly apologize. sometimes i get so friggin' busy with work, music, etc that my head explodes and i become comatose. this week has been one of those weeks where i think my mind just went blank. but i can't swear off rock/n/roll like  urlLink some people can . i feel like i physically and emotionally need music to feel like myself. it's worse than crack.  i still feel really out of it -- and still feel like a nomad with all my shitty moving around. it's been sort of an adventure, but right now my life doesn't need more drama. today's culture is going more and more for minimalism. take the impact of the film  super size me . also consider ordering a small coffee for 60 cents with one less lump of sugar, and maybe no cream at all. frequenting bars only once in a while. cooking more at home and eating half as much. twice the leftovers. mini skirts. shoes that don't have a back on them, i think they're called mules. jeans that expose more than they should because they are ultra-ultra-low-rise. this is steadily becoming the norm. i don't really remember what my point was... see, what i mean? even our thoughts are downsized... or rather, shorter-lived.   the winter pageant @ rothko the other night i went to see mike's band,  urlLink  the winter pageant  . they were so good! there is this incredibly sad, delicate haze that surrounds their entrancing music, and listeners beware, if you are depressed, the winter pageant will only induce more tears. and perhaps, even if you are happy, you will walk out of their show wholly depressed. think of a lost love. think of loneliness. think of disappointments. think of mean girls (not the movie). think of everytime someone ever betrayed you or kicked you in the shins or made fun of you. every time your parents criticized your life, your looks, your low salary. you get the point. incredibly atmospheric (especially when mike breaks out the e-bow) the winter pageant have the same mood as elliott smith songs but they come across as a bit more emotional, more swirly. a lot less bitter. and yes, equally as beautiful.    need new body @ knitting factory   in contrast, the band i saw last night thanks to some list action from  urlLink dt and rt , was energized, ridiculous, sarcastic and spastic --  urlLink  need new body  . HOLY SHIT. i had no idea what i was in for, but i got a clue when rt was like, "you've never seen need new body? oh man. i guarantee this will end up on your blog." and so it is! i think i spent the entire show squealing in delightful shock and amusement.    re-enactment:   aha! oh.my.gosh. aha! wtf?!? oh.my.god.   the band started off doing a few ditties that sounded like a re-interpretation of the theme from  all in the family . dude, i'm totally serious. it was obviously some kind of joke (and admittedly funny in a freaky sort of way that someone's voice could be so friggin' high normally -- think geddy lee or joe jurewicz), but then the band suddenly broke into their real set list, which was amazingly dancey and funky, with punk ideals. and whenever i hang with drummers like dt, i am always made to watch the drummer on stage. and i'm glad i did -- that dude was really fucking crazy. his eyes were bugging out and he was thrashing those drums like he was some insane asylum resident gone hogwild. it was kind of scary actually. the main lead singer had a very redneck look to him, and he kind of reminded me of a  urlLink tim harrington , but with less theatrics and more emphasis on just pure dancing.  also, thank god,  creed  finally broke up. woo hoo!

       good news for people who like bad news -- that's me!   is it just me or is there an air of  pixies  power on the new  urlLink  modest mouse   album? i can't stop listening to it. i love the jubilant squeals bursting forth from singer isaac brock. i love the high-pitched, swooning guitar parts. it makes me inexplicably happy, even during dark times. this will definitely be one of those albums i throw in the cd player whenever i'm feeling down and need an instant pick me up. sigh.    favorite lyric:  "we were done done done with all the fu-fu-fucking around!" -- from "black cadillacs"

       that joke isn't funny anymore  Being in New York is definitely a privilege. Not only is it expensive to live here, it is one of the most competitive cities in the world. And at times when I think that everyone seems to have lost a sense of community, something comes along to prove me wrong.   Struggling to recover from Thursday night's drunken Makers & Ginger debauchery, I spent most of this weekend kitten sitting for my boss's friend who lives in Nolita. Walking out of that neighborhood was quite refreshing, the warmth of the sun and the myriad of shoppers buzzing along the sparkling sidewalks, happy because they don't have to go to work the next day. I was one of those shiny happy people.   I walked from Nolita to Alphabet City, where I was moving the very last of my stuff out of my two-month sublet. I was kind of sad to be leaving what I think is the heart of the city for me. I spent more time around Avenue A and B in the past two months than in the entire time I've been in the city, which is coming up on 7 or 8 years. I will miss the convenience of crossing through Thompkins Square Park and visiting Mike at Alt Cafe. Or heading over a block to some listening party at Hi-Fi. Or breaking down at 3:30 in the morning and eating San Loco tacos (evil!) Or meeting peeps for drunken fun at B-Side or 2A and walking home afterwards. That is the shizznit.   Now I am back in Williamsburg, a community forever labeled by rock mags everywhere as the birthplace of electroclash and New York's burgeoning indie rock scene. And I have to say, I have missed Wburg a lot. Many of my friends live in the 'burg and steadily I have missed that slower-paced community of friends. The city is immediate and swift. The borough is lounge-worthy and calming in a strange way.

       two cute bands, one great show   urlLink    we are scientists! i was immediately attracted to their geeky name. i heard about them through my friendship with another awesome brooklyn via boston via texas band, bishop allen (pictured below). then someone at work gave me their cd and i was hooked. dude, i'm so excited to check them out this saturday! @  urlLink the tank ! times square! be there or... well, you know.   urlLink    bishop allen! one of the most charming and unpretentious bands in new york today, these cats are solid peeps and solid songwriters. I am forever in love with their song,  urlLink "Quarter to Three."  Favorite lyric: "Now let me tell you I've been up since a quarter to three / And I've been pacing back and forth through the hall / I've been thinking 'bout the first time she took my hand / And I don't understand it at all".    UPDATE: By the way, Bishop Allen's "Things Are What You Make of Them" was used in the movie,  Saved! . Who wants to go see it with me?

       so wha happened?  ok i've been getting a lot of questions about what happened on saturday. well,  dirty on purpose  didn't back out of the show as people were being told even on saturday evening... we did get a phone call from  the new year  telling us they were sorry about what happened -- apparently knitting factory overbooked the night, including some kind of weird party before the new year show, and one band had to get dropped from the bill. because of the party, the new year didn't even get a soundcheck, apparently, which is totally bogus. fucking bedhead! of course it sucks that all of this had to happen 2 days before the show... hopefully everyone was able to get a refund if you were seeking one. thanks to everyone for their support! the next dop show will be on july 30 at office ops for superfun rock/n/rollerskating fun! bring your skates or rent one! au revoir simone and circle and square will also be playing. it's the start of the dop tour, so come and celebrate with us! word!

       my little danish friend  a bunch of us went to see  metallica: some kind of monster  last night... it was one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while. probably funnier than anchorman. my favorite line was when dave mustaine was in a therapy session with lars...   dave: do you know what i went through? lars: i can imagine what i put you through. dave: you're not hearing me. do you know what i WENT through? lars: [rubs his face] dave: i miss my little danish friend.  or the exchange was something like that. seeing a band dissected like that was crazy. it was crazy when they were like, rob, please be our bassist -- here's a million dollars in advance! shit!! it was crazy to know their therapist was earning more a month than i earn in a year. beejezuz.

       dirty on purpose with the new year   urlLink    hmmm... here's a little self-promotion. dude, it's my blog. it's all about self-pimpin'.   Hey Peeps,   urlLink Dirty on Purpose  is playing on Saturday, July 10, with the New Year (x Bedhead), VietNam and Mazarin at NYC's Knitting Factory (79 Leonard St).  We would love to see your purdy lil faces in the audience, front and center, whoopin' and hollerin' and yelling "We Love DoP!" ever so raucously. Come celebrate this awesome bill with us.  Show starts at 10 p.m. and it's $12. We know, it's a lot of money, but you probably spent about that much to see a movie this past weekend, and we think this show will certainly entertain you more than  Spider Man 2 .   urlLink We think this show is gonna sell out... so buy tickets ahead of time at knittingfactory.com.

       i love you golden blue  this past weekend was like being in some sort of weird comatose state. or drifting in a deep pool of water... scissor-kicking my way to nowhere in particular. it's like listening to sonic youth's "i love you golden blue" on repeat whle the sun warms my cheeks to a nice shade of rose.  on saturday night i hung out with anna, george, katy, stephanie of va, greg and ryan the girl. some of us checked out vaz at north six. what a fucking awesome show, including the end where paul knocked the microphone stand off the stage and mimed his thank you. vaz is heavy rock that foams at the mouth but over the last couple years, they have developed really catchy guitar lines that swerve around like race cars. how can a drummer and guitarist make such a full sound? i dunno, but that drummer is fucking outta his mind. he looks so possessed. blink and you'll miss way too much.  then we headed over to ryan's apartment... which is crazy. they have a swing and hammock. they usually leave their double doors open and people riding their bikes by think it's some sort of tropical bar. but no, it's a fucking apartment. so stop walking in! while we were lushing on puerto rican rum, a couple people just walked in. one of ryan's roommates were like, "who are you?" and they were like, "isn't this a party?" hahahahaha.  i had been wanting to ride my bike all weekend. finally got to a little bit on fourth of july. after making peach daiquiris with katy and stephanie of va, i rode my bike to greenpoint to meet up with george. george, joe and i ended up watching the sonic youth dvd that george bought. i still can't get over the video with macaulay culkin in it. disturbing to watch thurston moore bobbing heads and playing guitar with the red-lipped wonder.  then george and i headed to the rooftop party. we ran into christy and eventually greg and joe graced us with their presence. i got kinda smashed on makers and gingers. we watched the fireworks in awe. smiley faces with whiskers! we danced around with wimpy sparklers. we ate the bbq food that christy brought. then i was so tired i went home early and passed out. how was your J4 celebration?  then i re-read the  griffin & sabine  trilogy, which chris helped me locate. that story is so romantic. love those books!

UPDATE:  here is a  urlLink link  to the stream of the show... (nota bene: the mics in the studio weren't working right so if you don't hear anything between songs, just imagine bidi and anna goofing it up and screaming things like "who rocks the party that rocks the body?" the link will only be live for about a week.  ps. we did not play the strokes. that was bidi. har har har!! (ok, she says it was a request. fair nuff!)

       your wish is my command    ok peeps. sorry i've been lax on the updates this week. indeed, it is true. i've been assed out. it's been a rough one! but now i'm back on track and want to share some fun stuff with you... if you're still into it.    i spent much of last night at band practice, preparing for the impending  dirty on purpose  tour coming up... if anyone can help us fill dates on august 5 or 6 (we currently have some leads in boston, rochester, providence and possibly chicago),  urlLink let me know . word! george's brother, greg (pictured above), came to practice to let the music just soak in.   i also went to this new williamsburg bar after practice to drinky drink with dj. the bar is called  funhouse  and it was pumping some kind of weird mix of music -- anywhere from !!! to bad techno music. but the british bartender was nice and mixed the makers and ginger strong. and they showed these projections on the white walls -- and guess what? there was a whole segment with penguins! fyi to people not in the know, but i fucking adore penguins. jo told me that when they cry, they can turn their salty tears into fresh water. or something like that. plus, i heard they mate for life. plus, they're damn cute, so...  tonight i think i'm hitting a couple birthday parties... and then i'm not sure what i want to do for fourth of july. there are several rooftop parties that i've been graciously invited to... but it's funny when you think about how many of my friends don't peep together. so it's probably impossible for me to see all my lovely friends. boo!  in other news, noah and dt were remiss in informing me that  modest mouse  and  the walkmen  are touring the west coast together. for once, i am jealous pf the left coast. c'mon walkies, come back to nyc. we need some "RAT" up in herre, ya heard?  i also saw  farenheit 9/11  on monday night. it was horribly depressing and i found myself crying several times. the movie was also kind of funny, but i think i was more annoyed with all of the wacky sound effects and musical emphases that michael moore was using to overscore his points. yeah, some of it was smart and witty, but other times, i felt like some obnoxious child was directing the documentary... er, film (it was far from an unbiased documentary). while i agree with a lot of what michael moore has to say, i think the way in which he expresses his opinions can be outlandish and over-the-top... which will turn a lot of people off. on the other hand, sometimes i think one has to be extreme to make an impression in people's minds. unfortunately, we americans are often too complacent and need to be shook. shook hard.
