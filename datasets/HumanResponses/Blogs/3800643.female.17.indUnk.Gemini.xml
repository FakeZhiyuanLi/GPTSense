       So for anyone who looks at my blog and is like I wonder what this crazy girl looks like well there I am! So I'm now very excited because I love pictures. Sooooooooooo now I get to put pictures I want into this blogger. Awesome!!!   Other then that I'm doing wonderfully good. I miss my boyfriend very much. He is working two jobs and haven't gotten a chance to be with him. Truthfully I don't like his job doing Valet. Because he always has fucked up hours to work. And I know he is going to start getting tired and cranky. This baby girl don't want anything to do with that.   School is getting ready to start again. My last year of High School finally!!!! Yay! Plus my little brother is going to start going to my school which I'm curiouse to see how that works out. I haven't been to the same school as him since well elementry school. I'm going to try not to embarress him.  I might not be on for a little while writting because my mom is gone on vacation so I will be at my fathers house for a week or so. For all those people that worry when I'm not online this is why I'm not on. Well xoxoxoxoxo Baby Girl

      What can I say? I'm in a good mood. Life is treating me pretty damn good. Luke and I are getting along. I'm glad to have the friends that I have. Even though they are all different, with all different promblems, and some that think no one has life as bad as them. LOL I still love them. I hope someday they can find peace. Shit I want it lol. Luke has a two jobs now. Which will suck cuz I won't see him much. OH well he will be bring the money in. I need a job though speaking of bring money in. I wish I had a job. LOL. It would be awesome to pull money out of your ass!! Wouldn't it? I probably could get one with fast food but me and food don't really go together lol, unless i'm eating it. Well I dont' know what else really to say soooooooooooooooooooooo. I Love All my friends. xoxoxoxoxo Baby Girl

      I Wish I could just find a job. It is horrible trying to find one, and then having your boyfriend keep telling you that your not trying hard enough. It sucks, and it is very stressful for me. I shouldn't be stressed over a stupid fucking job. I'm only 17. The only reason my boyfriend wants me to have a job is to help him pay for shit. He thinks I take his money for granted yet when I say I'm not hungry when we go out cause I don't want him spending his money on me he gets pissed. At least I clean his apartment everyday for him. At least I fucking feed there kittens, and at least I give him back rubs all the time. And when he wasn't living at his fucking apartment who was the one driving is fucking drunk ass home!!!! ME!!!!!! I hate how he acts like I dont' do shit for him. He acts like I owe him this big favor cause he pays for shit for me! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love him to death but shit can't always be my fucking fault. He accuses me of fucking doing shit behind his back, he accuses me of fucking cheating on him when he has more signs pointed to him. I've so far found fucking bobbie pins (female hair clips), a females white shirt, and a sweater in his room!! And I'm accused of cheating. Plus his ex came over saying that she was his boyfriend. Which I know that nothing happend with that she is just insane. But is he found guys shit in my room he would break up with me accuse me of cheating and leave. I dont' know what to do. I love him so much. But I'm afraid of losing him. Cause I know he cares for me. And he is just watching out for himself. But it hurts so bad not to be trusted he has no clue. I pray to god things change. For I can't take anymore pain.  xoxoxoxox

      For anyone who is wondering why I haven't been online it is because my network is down. We haven't been able to figure out what the problem is. I miss talking to everyone online, and I hope that I will get this stupid problem fixed. I miss my internet!!!! On the other side of life I'm doing really good. Why is it that ex's like to try and just jump into your life one day and all of a sudden they want to marry you!!!??? I don't know either. LOL. Just a thought yea know. To bad for them I have a wonderful boyfriend that I don't plan on leaving. Plus that guy probably just wants me for sex. That is why I hate men. But I'd much rather be friends with them then females. Females like to bring the drama.&nbsp; Guys you know what I'm talking about, and don't lie to yourself Girls you know you do.  Well that is all happening in my life. Oh before I forget if your boyfriends ex girl friend who always calls him came over to his house claming she is his girlfriend what would you do?

      I had a wonderful fourth of July. I went to Glendo Lake. It was packed to the max. Over 2,000 people in just one camp sight, and all drunk. Someone started a fire. My boyfriend's family noticed it and put it out before the fire department even came. They didn't even thank us, and his brother inhailed to much smoke and had to go to the hospital. He is fine now though.  I was able to hang out with my cousins Holly, Austin, and Wyatt. They are from Bakersfeild, California. They left for the long road home yesturday. I'm excited they might be moving to colorado!  I'm off again to go with my mom camping in South Dakota. I will be back sunday night. Or monday morning either/or. I'm upset my friends, nor my boyfriend could go with me up there, and save me from the old people. Ahhhhh..........!!!! OH WELL what can I do but complain, right?  I've just started reading an Astrology book again. I forgot how much I love astrology. I'm exactly like a Gemini, and my boyfriend is exactly like his sun sign. It amazes me. I have to believe the thing cuz it speaks the truth on so many levels. It also explains why I feel so depressed. It is because I have nothing to do to let out energy inside me. I dont' work I sit around all day with all this energy that I end up crashing. I start feeling depressed. So I'm going to work out more see if it helps any. Did you know that if you date a Gemini you get a couple women in one? I think it is awesome for some. The only thing that sucks about a Gemini is she is prone to cheat. Until she is really inlove. And right now I am with Luke. I have never ever cheated on him. The worst part is that he always thinks I am. It makes me feel well it wouldn't matter if I did cheat on him or not he would still think I did. But I'd never do it to him he is everything to me. I make my life evolve around him I don't know why. He is my ecstasy.  The only other guy that I had such feelings for was a guy named Richard little to say he lived far away, and was going into the Marines. I couldn't stand not being able to see him but every weekend, and for him to leave to the Marines would of made it worse. And apparently he was scared that I was to good for him. Not true. But it is okay now because we are good friends. Now if my boyfriend could understand lol. Well wish me good luck with my family reunion in South Dakota.  Loves!

      I have a lot of different kinds of friends. I have rich friends, poor friends, happy friends, sad friends, depressed friends, jock friends, preppy friends, goth friends, punk friend, and even nerd friends. I have so many friends with so many different lives it is amazing. And I love it. Give life a bit more of excitement. The one thing that I always find interesting is they all think they have it the worst out of everyone. The way I see it is that everyone has there own problems. Loose a family memeber or worse be treated badly by them, someone hating the way they look. I consider myself pretty lucky I mean I have problems that come up but not so bad that I'm devistated at least not yet. I think god put me here to help others see the peace of life. Even though it is a big fucking bitch to get through. You only get one chance so live it to it's fullest. I'm sick of hearing about war specially with religion. It is stupid, you believe what you want to believe and let the other believe what they want too. Why do we have to agree on it? It isn't like everyone ever agree's with anyone about anything anyways. I'm I true or not. Anyways I hope someday we can find peace in life and not going through it like it's the end of the world. Someday it will come but until then just live life don't dread it.  xoxoxoxo carin

      I've decided relationships are one of the most difficult things in life. Not the most but one of the most. Everyone wants to find that someone. That person that you can count on to be there for you when you aren't yourself, or that person who you know loves you will all your heart... ect. I'm inlove with Luke. He is my everything. And I know we fight about stuff but doesn't everyone have there arguements. You can't tell me you have never argued with your friends, or family. We can't always live with one or the others opinion a relationship is two peoples minds put together. Of coures there will be some head clashing. I even talked to Lukes aunt about it. I think Luke and I are going to be married at Disney World!!! YAY!! That won't be for a couple years but it will be awesome I'm so excited. I've started to really think there are so many guys out there that I love but they are friends. I love them very much but Luke and I fit together.  Well thats my thoughts right now. loves Baby Girl
