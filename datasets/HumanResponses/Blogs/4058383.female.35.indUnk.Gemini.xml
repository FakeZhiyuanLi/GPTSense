						    This song came out shortly after my dad died. I was a mess before I heard it. I was a mess after I heard it. This song offered healing though in a way.  Luther Vandross wrote it, sings it, and released it. Now Kelly Coffee sings it in country music. Here are the lyrics and my own memories of it all.      "Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence   My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep Then up the stairs he would carry me And I knew for sure I was loved."       My dad would dance with us all. He was a wonderful dancer. I have not found a man who could dance like him. Yes he would carry us upstairs to bed. This first part of the song was a wonderful memory.       "If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him I’d play a song that would never, ever end How I’d love, love, love To dance with my father again."     This verse is so true. How much I would love to dance with him one more time. Just to speak to him again would be wonderful.      "When I and my mother would disagree To get my way, I would run from her to him He’d make me laugh just to comfort me Then finally make me do just what my mama said. Then finally make me do just what my mama said Later that night when I was asleep He left a dollar under my sheet Never dreamed that he would be gone from me."      I remember that fully. How many times I would cry to him. Complaining how unfair my mom was being. Yes never faulting mom he would explain how I should just do what she said.     Well this verse hits right at the heart. Never in a million years would I think that dad would be gone. It's amazing how much it still hurts.     "If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him I’d play a song that would never, ever end ‘Cause I’d love, love, love To dance with my father again."    Again what I wouldn't do to have that option for a day.     "Sometimes I’d listen outside her door And I’d hear how my mother cried for him I pray for her even more than me I pray for her even more than me."     My mom is still having trouble with it all, I understand it because how can you just forget 30 years?     "I know I’m praying for much too much But could you send back the only man she loved I know you don’t do it usually But dear Lord she’s dying To dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream"     As sad as it may seem, I do pray about letting him give my mom an A-OK sign, just so she could have some peace.     God gave this man to my mom to help raise us. He was legally my stepfather, but my DAD no matter what. He taught me about life, as most dad's do. Yes there were times when he and I butted heads. We argued our political differences, but I grew up and learned how much he really knew.     About 2 weeks before he died he called me. My sister was a handful even at the age of 27. He was helping her through some problems. Well he asked, "If she doesn't care, why do I?" I explained the best I could. I told him like our Father in Heaven loves us all no matter what and when we call on Him, He is there because we are his children. Like we are your children you love us no matter what and you will always be there when we call you. He was very quiet, but at that moment I knew he understood how much we loved him.   That was the first and last time he really really listened to what I had to say.     The day he died I had called him, he told me not to go to the hospital because he didn't want a big deal made there. I told him I would see him when he got home. I did not know it would be our home in Heaven. I said "I love you Dad" he said "And I love you." Then an hour or so later mom called and said he went code blue. He was gone by the time I got there.     How long would I have kept him on the phone had I known he was leaving us.  There is so much more to all of this, but if I continue I will cry.

						    Well this is my first blog entry. I imagine I will get better at this. I remember the first time I heard the word blog. I wondered so much what it was, so I looked it up and was more confused when I found myself reading so much. Then I had&nbsp;a Jessica Simpson moment and said to myself, "Oh Blogs are people's life stories." I was addicted. Took me six weeks to get the nerve to start one.     &nbsp;   I am in the process of job hunting. I have excellent office skills. The only thing is that because I have been a stay at home mom for the most part of my adult life, my work history looks bad. So I just keep applying, hoping and praying someone will see my resume and say, "Wow we need this persons skills".     &nbsp;   I have 2 wonderful children. They are normal but I never dreamed how wonderful they would be. I thought for sure our rocky and unstable life would have destroyed them. I guess having mom with them through it all actually did some good. My oldest is so anti-drug, anti-anything out of the straight and narrow path, I am afraid she will never learn how to live it up. My youngest is just full of joy, you would never know that he has had some very bad luck with school and other students, but he knows how to live it up, and be responsible at the same time. Now his room is a different story.     &nbsp;

						   So do other people read these? LOL!!  That is the question I got from my mom. I told her maybe. She was not too thrilled that my life would be on display like this. I told her it would be a long shot for someone to read mine. Didn't make her feel any better. We just laughed it off.
