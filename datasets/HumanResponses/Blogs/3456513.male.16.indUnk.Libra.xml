      Today my grandma got like 5 pounds of strawberry (no kidding) we all cleaned and sliced them then put them into a massive bowl and added an massive amount of sugar to make the juices of the star berry come out :) and after dinner we had huge strawberry shortcakes, very good, I when back for seconds :D  also since my grandma only comes out every 2 years, she offered me a gift of my choice (at the expense of my birthday and some Christmas money :S ) so I mention I been keeping my eye on this:   and agreed to order it for me :)  I always wanted one of these but never got one :) but this model particularity has some interesting features like; "User Programmable Messages - 4 custom messages up to 200 characters can be stored in memory and programmed to display on certain dates or as often as you like!" and "Quartz Accuracy - Precision microcomputer-controlled instrument has a high accuracy crystal controlled clock and built-in 100 year calendar" even if it has 100 years of max lifetime I don't think it or me will last that long :o  it claims to have "Captivating animations/digital effects - Interesting non-stop graphic action on the display attracts and fascinates viewers" but I only seen old ones that have only 2 different ones I pretty sure there be more as this seams like a new one and I never seen this one before  well even if it hasn't very many animations/digital effects it very cool :) and besides I pretty sure I could figure out something to "enhance" the features on it

      Well my parents and grandparents are deciding to rent a yurt at the beach and stay 2 night there but there's a problem, the forecast predicts rain and chances of thunder storms for the hole state but I don't go by there prediction as they can't tell if it going to snow or not in July : but the radar and sats don't show much good ahead so maybe I give some credit to the forecasters other that than it been normal...

      After watching the season finale of star trek: enterprise it bugs me that I have to wait 6 months until the next season episodes. the ending was very good but my god WHY! The always leave us hanging, and plus we have no clue what the heck what that was at the end and what it means.  I was reading around the  urlLink star trek site  for the The next season and I found out that they a lot of people trying to keep Star Trek running.  if you want to know I do like watching star trek but I'm not a super duper trekkie fan, I've just always watched the The series since I can remember.  the other things that happened to day it my parents got me the PC gamer magazine that has a special on Half-life 2 which was very cool. They also and also had some thing about "guild wars" and "black and white 2" not much but it was something.  guild wars has a free beta demo which I tried once not really fun yeah it has pvp and coop monster killing but it all 4-8 player based nothing huge to it pretty much lowers the level of battling, from mmorpg war to rpg lan gaming which I s comparable to dungeon siege but at least in dungeon siege the world it limitless (well almost)  if you want to check out " urlLink Guild Wars " or " urlLink Half-Life 2 " or even " urlLink Black and White 2 " just click the links

      Well since I started the last post late at night I kinda dropped off. so hear is some more info  I have 3 sisters and I am the only boy, so that's an odd mix as you can tell I was the first born and we all live in a nice house my mom love to play around the garden planting flowers, fruits, Veggies ect. my dad works most of the day and we only see him at the end, lunch break when, and weekends  this  could  be a normal family if you subtract the 2 cats, lizards, and 2 of my sisters. but we can't let that happen :)  so something else to say in hear except what I am like (yeah, I not that pathetic). yesterday my grandparents flew in from New York to spend 2 weeks, like the do every year and as so we had to prepare for there coming which I hate because we spend all day cleaning, baking cookies, moving the beds around so that my 2 other sisters can all sleep in a bed and still have a bed for them.  other than that nothing else has happened because I lazy and just woke up an hour ago :\

I like computers, games,programming (which included game development), cats(Bomber, databug, pearl, Sam), and my lizards :)  most of the day I wake up 10:00 am yes I have school but its at home so I can do such things, MAHAHAH I do my school and house work after that I usually go right on to the computer to do "work" on my programs\games I'm developing or if I'm frustrated with a bug I go play dod or ns (half-life mods) steam.  well that's it for now I will post something tomorrow :D

      Well the reason i haven't put anything up is because the new version of firefox (0.9) corrupted a lot of things so i couldn't get my bookmark (but i still have them thank god) i counldn't login,hit the back button, see flash,shockwave, and a lot of things the only thing is i could do was browse when the patch was released i deleted the corrupted files (but not the bookmark) and it all working now  so what happened you ask?  well today my summer vacation is now officially here not much about hl2 except *it will* be release in summer valve mentioned august (which is still in summer) and a German video posted at  urlLink http://www.halfliferadio.com/  it shows stuff about cs:s so if any one can translate what they were saying please tell me  i started work on an installer creator and installer called "Rolgerd installer" it Dreglor backwards yes i have no sense in names but its interesting it almost complete the beta should be on the purebasic forums soon (matter of a few weeks or days, depends on how much i get done each day if there is any)  also some one on irc explained (more like flooded) and excellent idea for keeping my software crack-resistant maybe crack proof and I'm not lieing but i will not explain it here and you know why there always watching...  my mom who works at the church as a youth teacher has an summer idea for a party involving my lava lamp, a disco ball, and records far as i can tell were doing a late-70 style party for this wensday  there also be a water fight/party in the backyard with water balloons and squirt guns, but that doesn't happen until mid July  and i found just yesterday very interesting and fun little physic demo for a gpdk (game physic development kit) features very good life like physics try both the jeep demo and the showcase one the jeep is 11meg and the  showcase is only 1.8 Meg.  urlLink Jeep Demo   urlLink Showcase  showcase there both very cool the jeep has some good textures and has shadowing give the physics a nice look on my computer my video card crashes (yes it can and it does it just resets the video card a slight pause and flickering of the screen) in some demos but its all cool i noticed a bug in the showcase if you pull (left click) an object then while holding the object pull it (right click) then let go of both mouse buttons the object will continue to hang there as if you were still holding it there now you can't release the object but were ever you click to pull the object will zip to the location with great force and you can hold more than one object the same way. so you can have a monstiosity of objects all trying to get to the same location and in the static mesh demo and castle demo you can click and hold the object and use it as plow-ball hehe use the well(?) stone to obliterate the wall :) can pick up all the objects (with time) and the move your mouse in circles to make all the objects orbit around and watch them slowly come together like some weird planet  enjoy ~Dreglor

      Well my parents decided for the remainder of my 2 years of high school I won't be doing it at home I will be doing it through the local high school. it all started when my sister though it would be a fantastic idea to go to high school just to make friends, I dough she ever get any were in there... and they (like always) dragged me into it and before I can even get off in my work there picking out what classes I will be doing next year, when they don't tell use anything about them except the points they get that's about it...  also my dad feel that waking up around 9-12 in the morning is a bad thing e wants me to wake up every day at 7 before my dad goes to work because he wants me to get a done and have some fun after school and get into the routine of waking up at a normal time but I told him I can still get all my school done before 3 even if I wake up at 1 O_o and even if I had a job that required to wake up at 7 I can get up, but they never listen...  it kinda funny living in silicon forest because just about anything that gets into your computer is made in the state you could probably build a complete computer (minus the case) from dealing with a couple of friends at work. not like I do that, my dad did he was talking about video cards and one of his friends said that they know a guy at a ati disturbing (a company that takes the cards and put them into boxes some times changing the cooling on them) and he some how made a deal that if he could get him a motherboard from intel (which we have plently of sitting in are house :) that he would get him a brand spanking new ati 9800 all-in-wonder pro 256meg  this was a week ago... I wonder when this will all happen? because my dads video card will go into my I can't wait to be upgraded :) (radeon 9100 to radeon 9600xt *drool*)  if any one reads, until next err session.

      Well my parents are on the ground and are en route to the house, which I happy about :) I got my holo-clock and having a ball with it :D I set up the clock to say (randomly) "Dreglor ROCKS!","Beware the mushroom people are coming! :O","Chocolate num nums?" and on my birthday say "WOOHOO! It's my birthday" I can just watch it all day...  I did notice when I first was getting out of the package that it was controlled by a micro-controller (basic stamp maybe) because the main chip was replaceable all I know it that it's replaceable and the chip is 28 pin. I've already begun to figure out how it does what it does >)  my parents had there share of exictment in SF after taking pictures of "master commander" ship and feeling an earthquake from the 28 floor they said that they had enough execitment for the week  during the days they were gone I was happy playing Might and magic 6 because I always loved that game and never really finished it (like most games)  so after 3 days of constant play I happy to say I am in the middle of the game (I think...) I mean this game is insanely long and has so much detail it plain fun to find the best way of doing things and the way you level up is just enough to have you satified but still wanting more points for the skills

      Well my dad got an an award at work and there's a convention for that down in California and my mom want to go to a photoshop convetion so they leave tomorrow and my neighbor's going to watch us :) so all is arranged and there set to go  also my "holo clock" is finally being shipped and will arrive this week (this wensday-thursday) so I happy about that since a waited a week already...  yesterday my dad was getting bored because he had no games to play as he finished farcry, so he picked up "breed" it's ok needs some improving in art and textures the really bad thing about this game is that the AI COMPLETELY SUCKS.. it just horrible your team mates often get stuck or kill them selves because they used a route that involves walking off a cliff : but I do have to say some of it is pretty good story isn't half bad and the voice acting is pretty good put some HI res textures that look nice and redo the AI and you have a battlefield 1942 clone that takes place in 2060 ^_^  I also found a very odd site, its a guy who was really bored so he hooked up his webcam,lamps,lights,toys... To the internet so that people can watch as people click the lights on and off and if some one is there have fun watching them watch you mess with there lights if you want to have a good laugh go  urlLink here

      Found a interesting site that hosts a huge "geek test" 200 questions long at least I got 36.29191% - Major Geek :D if you want to check it out your self and take the huge test go right ahead at  urlLink this Link!  :)  my dad and I have been trying to create a water cooling system for my system. see my system is special (no really it is...) it is different in it special intel CPU and motherboard specially from intel, there old hardware betas that were tossed or given to those special few (hehe). most of these betas don't work but the ones on got here do but with some bugs, now what makes this special is that the CPU can be overclocked and normal intel CPU's can't in fear of reselling issues. this means that even if you have a 1 gig p4ee CPU (if they exists) the CPU can go up to 4.0+ because the CPU architecture surpports it. Now since water cooling is heck of a lot better at sucking the heat off of the CPU than air every body wants to use it because CPU's as we know it are becoming so hot that water cooling is the savior of the next 10 years of CPU's (5+ gig and up) the only thing in the back of every bodies mind is that if there's a leak.  so what me and my dad are going to do is take 2 water blocks, 32oz water bottle, a pump, peltair cooler, a heatsink and fan, some plastic flexible piping, some sort of massive power supply.  now what a peltair cooler is a passive (no moving parts) cooling system that literally sucks the heat from one side to the other side using electicity now what's funny is that we have a big one. Its 50x50mm a little smaller than your palm I guess, but it sucks more power required from a car battery o_O but then again today's computer power supplies put out more than needed power for this unfortunately mine doesn't  the peltair cooler requires 12 volts 17 amps and 170 watts of electicty unfortunately my power supply only puts out 13 amps and 180 watts just short but if it was right I would still have to get another power supply for my computer because my computer uses some of that (I'm not all sure HOW much)  now all of this is going to put inside of a box so it nice and neat but it kinda makes a problem for one size may be a problem as I want to fit this into a small of a box as possible and my dad want to put a fan on top of the heat exchange system (waterblock,peltair,heatsink) while I want to cut a hole above the exchanger and take a 120 mm fan to it and leave the heat sink, because 120mm fans are silent and move more air besides we already have 2 (double fans could be placed in as well) my other reason for this idea is that the power supply will be creating a great about of heat as well.  if this is to "fuzzy" for you to really get an idea what I trying to say just comment your questions and I will try to answer them because this is just plan after all with some pieces : oh and my sister ordered and received a linkin park sweater in the start of summer just because she was SO CRAZY to get it. I still don't understand why she listens to people who yell until there lungs are dangling out...  well that's all for today.

      Well my grandma left yesterday, and I started my school up again. some times I loath it because the way the thing is set up is that you go over and over the same subject. like history I studied the "beginnings of America" for 3 years...  I worked on my projects a little I saw a short video of dungeon siege 2 gameplay, just..Wow they really put some good ideas into the game like duel-welding and powers one of my favs of the demostration was "pets" were you can premantly create (or buy?) that the only way to have it grow is to feed it your items you pick up or buy. interestingly enough the items you feed it, will give the pet the stats of that object. it would be interesting in real life, "yeah, could I get that corvette for my dog and tank too"  I picked up the game freelance again for just because I needed something to do when I was frustrated with my programming. finished the game in 12 hours :O I'm already pretty much max out in the stats in that game... I figured once I max out I would put some mods in to make it more fun just to explore and see if any of the new ships weapons were better :D  then if I ever get bored of that I will try one of those huge servers there hosting now days I did at one time host a server for that lasted only about 1 year because my parents were getting annoyed :but in that time I got 10000+ unique players it was all ways full even in the late hours and now after there's are servers that host 65 verus my 32 and there full o_O. the server program  does surpport 128 players but my god you would need twin p4ee 3.5 cpu's and a oc-12 connection to host it. for those who don't know what oc-12 is it's a fiber optic connection I think that has like 5 gig transfer rate.  and if you want to know what freelancer is it's a space flight/sandox like game good sp and mp but there's missing things like there's just "ok" level of systems and general stuff, there's lots of exploring because each system rather big and some of them contain derilics full of goodies and some of the higher level areas contain lots of hard to reach ones and they contain top level non buyable weapons :) I do have to say the atmosphere is awesome everything from docking/exiting a space station from you and other people to people barking at each other on the radio to even people telling you what happened before the game what really needs to be put into the game it just more of everything so of and of development team of "freelancer" are reading this;  polish the graphics, add more systems,weapons,hidden things, stations, increase AI traffic in every system by 10 fold at least to make it more interstice, more radio chatter, types cargo, types of missions, add a buyable power and engines because, and last but not least add more interactions for planets most likely for mp sp is ok  well most of these things can be achieved my mods in the community but there's a lot of things there.  the smaller things that happened around here is that I put up a small picture for you guys to see he it not me but it close :) glasses, brown hair, geek shirt and a  FEW  pimples and you got your self a cartoon version me.

      Well my camping trip is over it lasted 2 days we stayed at the beach in a yurt (nice too) the first day we were there the beach had winds of 50+ mph :O it was insane the second day we just did normal camping things, camp fire, cooked and ate fatty foods and played around the camp and the beach  when we got back my grandma finally ordered that clock thing (might as well call it a floating-clock)  our neighbor's are still on there vacation they will be back soon but they send us a email saying there having fun and all :)  I been working on my programming, right now I am working on a web browser that has it own http and html code not like some others that use ie's or netscapes. it project name right now is Dragon but I call it something else when I get a good name into my brain  I also have a huge game in development not going to tell you much the project name and profile the final title will be A.R.R.T.S it will be a 3D RTS I will give no info at this time because I really haven't got a lot to say and it on hold until a newer version of pb is ready to be downloaded :BUT I can assure you that I will not cancel the project I may re-code it and cost me 5 years of my life but I will get it out the door :D as the idea is very unique and nothing has really come close to the interesting idea of this, well except one but I won't tell you because I'll give away too much :P

      It been a while since I posted here it been kind of busy and the fact that my hard drive was held hostage for 2 weeks (was going to be a month but I was so good :D )  and the fact that my master boot record got messed up some how then fixed then a update windows had killed my network connection (dunno why) so I backup and reformatted everything now my computer is squeaky clean :)  I've been doing a week long (almost over) kids church thing not all that hard but the kids really suck the energy out of you at the end of the day  I did started up Diablo 2 again since I didn't totally finish it last time IM in act 2 last part (arcane sacuary)  I keep on hearing this d2x patch thing I can't get much info on it the only site with info was  urlLink www.diabloii.net  and the page on it is all messed up and nothing can really been read or clicked on  so if any one can tell me anything on this please tell me

      For some odd reason my watch died (battery's) today it was nice my parents say there going to get a new battery's I not sure if that's going to happen in the mean while I will wonder thru my life clueless to the time,and try to fill the "skin shadow" from the watch :) half life 2 seams to be coming along according to gabe Newell(co-founder,project manger?) there was a mention of a demo after the game is sent to the publisher maybe before hl2 is out :) that would be great my dad wants to get cs:cz because a cs:s beta will be coming soon and it will be coming to cs:cz people I wouldn't blame him because getting to at least see what the engine is capable of is bone chilling :)  doom 3 seams to be shipping currently, but I'm not exactly running to grab a copy the game seams to be super remake of the other 2 gore/scare-fest with little story  dungeon siege 2 won't be out until December...But it looks sweet :D  if you look at the games now they shifted from polygons to shaders and physics have just made a big ripple before physics were a dream because CPU was still a major rendering factor even with 3d cards now since 3d cards really pull about 80% of rendering it frees up a lot of stuff for AI or physics now every programmer knows that AI shouldn't take all (even if it's pretty advance it still comes down to if and else statements) so physics now take the leftover which is more repetive because physics can be explained pretty easily to computers because its basically math the only hard part is optimizing it  well that's pretty much it have a nice week to who all that reads this (if any)

      I find odd things on the internet, like people purposely (for fun of course) jumping in the way of there buddies car "Never under estimate stupid people in large groups" if I ever had a motto this would be it...  I saw a another's persons blog were he was really angry he like 14 and hates him self and everything around him. he was truly evil... I think he's parents never loved him, honestly. people like him should really try to look at the world another way before jumping : well of note, I had fun at fourth of July setting of colorful explosives is always fun my sisters birthday rolled by nice cake :) while were on the subject girls around her age (maybe others) are either on guy surfari (literally) or depressing them selves kinda odd or normal I really wish I can't help people like them but in most cases I can't bummer tho'  hmm this blog is making me hunger for food :P

      Well this week has been very chaotic and filled with events most of them centered on my parents "renewing of the vows" getting ready to have a party at are house was very tiresome  in light of all this (or darkness hehe) my dad bought Doom 3 in the time we got it to just about 10 mins ago I played it until I finished it which was roughly 48 hours of gaming thur the span of 4 days  I think the game was awesome scared the crap out of me several times, one of the monsters that probably the most scariest is the bug-baby thing it always seamed to jump in my face with out me knowing were it was and every time I knew it was close I would get goose-bumps my dad played it a while haven't heard his opinion on the game but my sister tried to venture into the game she though it was cool and liked it but the first time she played it she came up to me and said "Oh my GOD that game is FREAKING PHYCO" I think she meant by insanely scary at the time there were only zombies hehe the first big night I played it I had nightmares of the zombies although my system isn't the best one to play it I was able to get medium and 800x600 just fine and 1024x768 if I wanted to play with a lot of "chunky play" the game atmophere is very vivid and scary a lot of audio that sets the mood and sounds from near by monsters also makes it very interesting (the sounds of the bug-baby give me goose-bumps :\ ) the story was cool and the PDA stuff did give a lot info into the story I never did play doom or doom 2 but it doesn't really matter because doom 3 takes place before those the only real bads were that the physics were kinda weird like a lot of friction was applied to everything and that gameplay wasn't all that, there were hardly any puzzles to do go to place-find key or PDA-open door-kill everything-boss-repeat  the only real unique thing was the interactive panels were when you got close were you looked is were your mouse went and you can click on things that way and the buttons did do a lot of things that interacted with the environment another thing was kinda cool (and kinda mind challenging how they did it) was the camera in/out. There was one instance were the camera was looking at the monitor it was displaying on so it was "hall of mirrors" effect now the problem of this is that it should of gone forever and the game would lockup and eventually crashed maybe it's a simple cap ..  now for some hl2 news! the cs:s beta has been delayed know one knows why or how long it will be delayed for but by the sound of it its a few evil bugs that just won't die  not much else has gone on in the hl2 world  my game I working on is really doing well in the design stage I've got tons of txt files and papers on my desk and in the folder it just seams to get better and better when I thing longer I think eventually I going to stop thinking and start coding I'll set the date at Set at the 15 of august gives me a week to clean up my txt files and papers and put them all onto one clean essay the plan is then go to the pb forums and ask a few people to help :) if no one wants to help (which I dought there very good people) I do it all by my self in that case it will be considerable longer...  ~Dreglor

      On Saturday (2 days ago) I was helping my dad do rotatilling the back yard we were taking turns it was 95 out side we did it for 6 hours and even today I'm still sore, from sun burns and muscle pain the rotatiller that had was 5.5 hp and only had  2 wheels so the blades were the part the was dragging you around we both were having trouble handling it what was worse was that the clutch would get stuck on so I couldn't stop the blades some times so both of us were scrambling to stop it and of course the on/off switch is on the front one of the times my dad was in getting a drink it decided to take off and I was trying to hold it back from eating the massive rose bush that was right in front needless to say I had to have it dig in so that it couldn't go any were so I could reach the front and turn it off  so that was an long day..  it my littlest sisters 11th  birthday so (if any one even reads this) feel free to post a "happy birthday" comment :)  and I have an eye appointment to get some new glasses because one of my friends dog chewed one lens then I lose it 'nuff said there
