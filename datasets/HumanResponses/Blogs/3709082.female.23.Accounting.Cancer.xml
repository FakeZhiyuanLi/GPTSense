        5pm  Went out last night but Sandra called at the last minute and said to meet round her place because she was running late and didn't want me sitting in a pub on my own. I didn't drink anything I wasn't in the mood. We chatted for a while and then I came home.   I couldn't get to sleep until aroun 6am but I woke up at 7am and threw up quite a bit, it was really hot so I turned the heating off and opened up a window in my room, then went to back to sleep. I feel fine now so maybe that was it.  I don't know whether to go out tonight or just have a long soak in the bath and read my book. decisions decisions.   I think I may write children's stories ,lol.

       1:40am    So i'm pretty sure that my phones broken, i threw it across my room last night hoping that it would land on the couch and it seems my aim was a little off. I called my number this morning so that it would ring and I'd find it only it said the number i was ringing could not be recognized or something. Anyhoo I found my phone and I can still ring out and send and recieve text messages, maybe it'll fix itself or something.  I'm sorta drunk from last night but I can feel myself start to sober up.   I'm supposed to be meeting Sandra in some pub in Mitcham, the something or other arms, apparently i've been there before according to julie but i dont remember. I cant remember what time i said i'll meet her, I'll have to call her later on and find out either way it'll probly be a good hour and a bit before i find the place and she'll have left.lol. I don't know why we aren't meeting at her place, I know how to get to there. I'm sure she does these things on purpose just to confuse me.  i think he's sick of me, he said he'd wouldn't mind ending things if thats what i wanted but i said it wasnt, maybe he was hoping I would say ok and leave him in peace, i dont blame him. i've been a total cow. I didnt tell him i was here i was just gonna text him one morning and say i was here if he wanted to meet up but it seems like a stupid idea now. Maybe I shouldn't think about stuff too much.  i don't feel well.  that lump i found has been aching on and off all day and that can't be good.   I keep thinking its monday when its tuesday and i spent the whole of sunday thinking it was friday, I'm losing my marbles. And theres nothing but shit on the radio.  best program on tv = the hoobs (especially when you haven't slept for a couple of days)   Why do hairy, beer guzzling. 14+ stone bikers like Vanessa Carlton songs?  Oh and a new year begins today. Seems like a good excuse for a trip to the pub.   I came across this and I like it so I thought I'd share.

       5:30am   So Sandras going to leave Bob, finally. She's said it before so we'll see wether she goes through with it or not.  I didn't get the chance to meet up with her last time I was here so it's been ages since we've had a good laugh together. We always have a laugh. We went for a meal to this little restaurant, She's really picky when it comes to eating out so it took a while to find somewhere she felt confident to eat at. I told her she should be a hygiene inspector or something.   So anyway her ex-fiance is doing the whole 'shoulder to lean on' routine and she's weary of his motives. She said she didn't know if leaving Bob was the right thing and I told her I was amazed she'd stayed with him so long, she's lived with him putting her down and beating her up for 5 and 1/2 years. I told her I knew what she was going through and if living like that was making her unhappy then she was definately making the right choice by getting out of the situation. I just hope she actually does it and doesn't let him talk her out of it. From the way she was talking it sounded like the decision to seperate was a mutual thing.   I think I got about 3 hours sleep yesterday morning. We'll see how much sleep I get today.    I was taunted by an Irish git about England going out of Euro 2004, he said the biased referee was a legend and that I should send him some rude text messages so his friends wouldn't think he was a total loser even though he is, he also thinks I should let him fuck me up the ass.     Stupid Sweden went and lost on penalties, I didn't see the game. I was too busy eating.   heres a pic of my dog trying to attack my best friend      ......and by attack I mean lick to death     I am currently talking to Margie on the phone, she gets up every morning at this ridiculous time to Iron. She'll spend a good hour ironing. She got back from honeymoon a few days ago and is telling me all about it. She still has tendonitis, she doesn't understand that ironing probably doesn't help with it. Bulgaria, who goes to Bulgaria on their honeymoon?    5pm   I slept a little today, after a weird group chat on msn. boy are those people strange.  Mom called today and I got some lecture about not coming home for next Friday and how I was going to miss some party or other for a friend of hers i've never even heard of that I'm supposed to have said I'll go to. She didn't even ask me how I am. Viv wasnt in so it was a short conversation before she hung up.

       3:48am  Dill rang Viv yesterday morning and she found out I was staying here and demanded to speak to me. She apologised for telling people my business and said she wouldn't do it again, I told her she wouldn't have the chance. As far as I'm concerned I'll be pleasant if we should happen to be in the same room again but I can't trust her anymore.   She was one of my best friends, someone who I've confided in my whole life, and time and time again she keeps going behind my back and telling other people my business. Her excuse was that she really only meant to tell Cameron about it and didn't think that other people would read a public message board. It wouldn't have bothered me if these people were strangers but they're not, they're people I know. She claims I would have told Cameron about it anyway, she fails to miss the point that if I wanted Cameron to know it was up to me to tell him.   I've had an offer on my house, I'm not sure if I want to sell it anymore. I've always felt more comfortable over here and with Viv being here semi permanently I figured it'd be a good chance to spend more time over here and it didn't make sense keeping a house that I didn't really like standing empty. Ideally I'd just knock it down and build a better house in it's place but it'd be pointless if I don't see myself living there. It's a great little peace of land with some amazing views and I'd love to live there when I'm old and wrinky cause it's so peaceful.  Emily sent me a bunch of Photos we took when I was staying with her in New York for a couple of days in October. I wouldn't mind being in New York for longer it was nice.   Paris, Australia, New York, where else (thinks)

       6:45am   I haven't been to sleep yet and I probably should.  England are out of Euro 2004, stupid football   We had a goal disallowed and it went to penalties.     I need to go to Paris, I've been twice but only seen as much as the airport. I want to go to Australia to.   6:40pm   I can't decide whether to get really drunk tonight or not.

          Today: Windy and overcast with showers. High 61F. Winds W at 25 to 35 mph. Chance of rain 50%.   I talked to Viv at breakfast and I've decided to stay down here until the end of next week, I'll catch a train back on Friday because I have that appointment with my chiropractor on the 3rd so he can mess about with my toes. I don't get why I have to go back, last time I was there he said they were healed and that he couldn't see me having any more problems. Maybe I'll cancel and stay down longer if I like it here. The past two times I've been here I was so distracted by bullshit that was going on that I didn't really get a chance to enjoy spending time with my brother and my niece.  Viv keeps hinting that I should move down here permanently while he's here, I think he just wants a live in babysitter although he spouts this rubbish about being a protective brother and he worries about me when I'm not around, he seems to like it around here and he's really settled in which is good for him.    He says I can have the attic room, the one I've already claimed, and decorate it whatever way I choose if I make staying here a regular thing. I do miss him when he's down here and I'm up north, and it doesn't take long for me to get used to having him around that it's weird when I go back and he's not there anymore.   anyway, it's a huge room, it runs the length of the house and has these huge windows in the roof that I can see out of and up at the sky when I'm lying on my bed. It's cool when all the stars are out and twinkling and stuff.    I've already stolen Viv's laptop and brought it up here, he hardly uses it and hasn't noticed it's missing. He has another one he uses for work that the company gave him that I'm not allowed to touch under any circumstances. I'll probably use that information as a bargaining tool. My beds at one end of the room and couch at the other end facing a widescreen telly, the couch and the telly were left by the previous owner cos they couldn't be bothered with the hassle of getting them out of the door and down the little staircase that joins this room to the rest of the house. They took the bed though, I'm glad though cos Viv said it was rank and the bed I'm sleeping on has the best mattress ever, you just sink into it. I had a little sleep on it before considering I didn't get any sleep last night and I failed to sleep on the train because of the creepy stares guy and then too much stuff running through my head.    Viv brought up the idea of me going to college to get some qualifications, he thinks I'm smart enough but I told him he was deluded. I've already decided that college is not for me. I've already dropped out of school once and I don't really want to do it again. The thought of having to stop in once place for a whole year is just too weird. I don't like the idea of not being able to pack a bag and buy a plane ticket and fly off to where ever I want with a moments notice. Plus if I did go to college where would I go?  Newcastle's full of distractions I'd be at the pub most nights and get as little work done as possible or London cos Viv wants me to move here, He finishes his job in the new year so what do I do when he moves back home or goes where ever he decides to go next? People really should think about things before they lecture me on "doing something with my life". Haven't I earned the right to take some time for myself?  I had a talk with Cameron about people telling you they love you, I reckon its just another word but he disagrees. It's like someone saying "I love you" and them telling that to everyone they talk to, friends and mild acquaintances as some kind of signing off, it's meaning just becomes lost. I'm a fond believer that actions speak louder than words. Cameron says that no matter how many times a person says they love him it always has some sort of affect on him, it still means something special even if the feelings aren't reciprocated. Am I a cold hearted bitch or something? Maybe the person that called me that was right :/   And things just go from bad to worse. From what I've seen and heard from certain people I'm "not really that interesting and all I've done lately is cause stress" but "It'd be good to be seen out with someone like me" so basically I'm just being used as an ego boost. Assuming that's all true of course, but the sources are fairly reliable and why would they lie? I've been told about stuff before that's been said behind my back about how I'm such a bitch and that everything that was said to me was being said to someone else but I was reassured all of that was just lies. I'm trying not to listen to everybody else but its hard, If something happens once its not so hard to dismiss it as lies but when it happens again it makes it a little more difficult not to believe. Stupid crap like this keeps happening and not only does it piss me off it confuses me even more. How many times am I supposed to give him the benefit of the doubt.   We barely talk anymore and when we do I try to put it to the back of my mind but when people keep telling me stuff it's hard. I don't want to end up rowing everytime we have a conversation either. so what does that leave me with?  I don't want to see him, with all this going through my head I'm just going to sit there and look at him and think he's lying to me and making a fool of me, I'd prefer that I trusted him and was over all the stuff that's happened in the past and could sit there and just feel comfortable. At the minute I know I won't feel comfortable being there with him no matter how much I care for him. He doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong, he just thinks that I'm being weird and stroppy.  If things don't get any better in the next couple of weeks I'm going to have no other choice but to tell him that I can't do it anymore.   I didn't think things would be this hard and complicated. Part of me just wants to walk away from the whole situation and part of me wants to start things from scratch with a clean slate.    How the fuck do I bring all of this up anyway? "oh by the way not only do I think that you talk about me to all your friends and have a good old laugh at my expense and cheat on me, I also happen to think the only reason you want to be with me is you just want to impress you're friends, have a nice life bye bye"

       2:58am    Germany are out, they were basically beaten by the Czech Rep. reserves and didn't deserve to go through to the next round, poor Phil hahahaha.    I'm going to bed in a minute. I'm tired and bored as hell.  I need to figure out this html stuff.  I'm looking after Olivia later today because Viv still has work today and tomorrow, I'm going to have to find a pub to watch the match in, I don't really fancy watching it at home by myself, I prefer the atmosphere you get in a pub, plus a few pints is good too.

       5pm  Some weird bloke kept staring at me on the train, he got off at York. I pretended to go to sleep but every time I looked in his direction he was looking at me, he didn't even look away when I caught his stare. Anyway the train journey on my own gave me a chance to think about a load of stuff that's been going through my head.   How are you supposed to have any sort of relationship when you don't really talk to the person you're supposed to be having the relationship with?  It's not really working the way things are, and to be honest I don't think they've been working for a while and we both know it. I don't think it has anything to do with the way I feel, although sometimes I'm not sure, it's more to do with crap that's happened before. I've suggested we take a break from each other but I think if that happens I'm going to find it hard to come back to things. I have issues and things about stuff that's happened in the past and I think the only way things will move on is if we talk about them but I don't want to talk about it, I know I'll hear stuff that I don't want to hear and part of me worries that I won't believe what I'm told and if that does happen I'll have to end things. Why stay in a relationship if there is no trust?  The first time we argued it was that he didn't try to get back with his ex and stuff but now he doesn't bother to deny it he just puts it down to a mistake. What am I supposed to make of that?   It was raining when I got in from the pub last night and it was still raining when I went for my train, I don't think it stopped the whole night.

      hahahaha Italy beat Bulgaria and still went out of Euro 2004.     .   meh, i have to get up early, ive got to catch a train, stupid viv making me spend the weekend with him. He said he felt bad about falling out with me. brothers are stupid. I probably won't go to bed and just sleep on the train.  people are annoying. people hassling me for stuff are infuriating.  I dont know if i'll be able to post many entries while i'm at Vivs.  my knee still kinda hurts from the other day, but i dont really mind the pain to much anymore. in fact I kinda like it, plus i get to use deep heat which is always a pleasure :)

      My knee seriously hurts every time i bend it. >:( stupid old perverted men who can't keep their bastard hands to themselves.   Apparently because I'm financially stable i'm not allowed to hate my life or bitch or moan about anything ever! what a crock, people are so nosy.   It sucks that I can go for ages being happy and content with the way things are going and then something comes along and completely messes with my head. It's even worse when your head is fucked to begin with and something comes along and fucks it up more.   Cam uploaded a pic to my MSN group of me and Max hugging. I don't think he knows that photo was taken a couple of weeks, maybe even a couple of days before Max died and is probably that last photo we had taken together. Hell it was one of the last times that I saw Max alive. It just brought back all those old memories of the way we were together and all the feelings that I had for him, not to mention the pain i went through when he died and the shit time I had dealing with things last year. I guess I'm feeling guilty for moving on and making a little progress in finding someone who makes me happy, well sometimes anyway. The fact that I know feeling guilty for being happy is ridiculous should provide me with some comfort but it doesn't.   I want to live in a hut in the middle of nowhere and spend my days sitting outside in the sun on a big old rocking chair admiring the view.

      Henry and I went out last night and got a bit carried away and I ended up staying at his, he woke me this morning with a cooked breakfast but i turned it down cos the sausages were pork and I can't eat them. He has such a comfy bed I didn't want to get up. I may steal it from him. He's taking a three of weeks holiday starting monday and he's offered to come and stay with me while Simon is in Paris, Si said that I should go over and stay in a hotel and he'd show me the sites and stuff while his girlfriend was at work, I doubt it'd be too hard to convince Henry to come with me and with my Mother coming over at the weekend it would be a great chance to escape her.  We're going out again later so I probably won't make it back home tonight either and Henry doesn't have work tomorrow so we'll move on to the trebles more quickly than we did last night. He's going to take me to Anna's wedding on Saturday and then on to the reception which is good because then I don't have to worry about walking home on my own in the dark with the lunatic hanging around.

       Spent today shopping in Newcastle, bought a bunch of stuff I probably shouldn't have but what's new. I got the new Pearl Jam live album but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet.  Henry's taking me for dinner to some fancy place in Newcastle, he says I spend too much time in dingy pubs and working mens clubs and I'm the sorta of gal that should be treated like a lady so he says I have to get dressed up and stuff and we'll make a night of it. He's been really great these last couple of days helping to take my mind off various things. He's cute too.   He'd be perfect for me if i wasn't "involved" with someone, someone who doesnt seem to think anything of making me feel bad, someone who likes to let me think that every joke i make is a serious criticism. I can't be bothered with it. he's too good to have a regular conversation with me now it seems. 'out of "sight" out of mind, springs to mind these days.

      Henry and I drove up the coast and into scotland on saturday morning to this great little place that's kinda out of the way and really peaceful, it overlooks the sea and has some great views. I say little but it's what is left of a castle that was pretty much destroyed a couple of hundred years ago, from pictures and stuff it looks like it should be massive but it's not as big as you'd think and there aren't that many rooms in the place.  It was good to get away from things even if it was just for one night. I didn't worry about the noises outside wondering whether a snapping twig was Jack walking around getting ready to break in and attack me in my bed. I felt quite sad knowing I was having to come back home on sunday morning but we couldn't stay any longer Henry had to do stuff today. I could have stayed there forever. The place was surrounded by this fantastic atmosphere and it was real romantic too, the kind of place that would be perfect for a small wedding or something. The sunset on saturday night was amazing, it made me wish I had a camera to record it. Henry said something about skinny dipping but I reminded him that it was the north sea he was talking about and we would probably die from pneumonia.

      52. my winning streak at pool has nothing to do with my skills as a player&nbsp;but more to do with my distraction techniques and the gullibility of men.  53. i've often thought you're as exciting as a noodle.  54. I did see your junk&nbsp;on sunday night and I wasn't that impressed.  55. Ive deleted all trace of the irish muppet.  56. I've had weetabix for my breakfast for the past 3 days  57. I've stopped feeling like i'm about to have a heart attack, now i just feel like i'm a horrible person.  58.&nbsp; i'm a&nbsp;fucking genius and i have the i.q to prove it  59. I'm going to college in september  60. My mother called me the other day to see how i was doing and managed to drop into the conversation that i was putting on weight and that i should do something about it despite the fact she hasn't actually seen me in 4 months.  61. I'm ambidextrous sometimes 62. My mothers coming to england next week, she's staying at my brothers and wants to see me   63. I can ride a unicycle. 64. I named my goat Takoda, it means friend to all. it seemed pretty fitting. 65. John came on to me when you went to the bathroom on tuesday night. I think he tried to spike my drink too which is why i got Colin to pour it away.

        "Don't be afraid to cry. It will free your mind of sorrowful thoughts."       I didn’t go to Atlanta and I never intended to. There was no flight booked. I rang Carly on Friday morning and turned the job down she said “we both know I’ll be back on the phone in 6 months asking you again” and I said “I might give you a different answer in 6 months time” but for now I’m staying put.  &nbsp;Why did I say I was going?  &nbsp;Because I was bored and there wasn’t much else to write about, plus it’s always fun messing Camerons head.      Speaking of Cam I chatted to him&nbsp;for a bit this afternoon, he got pissed at me because I solved this puzzle he told me about within a couple of seconds and he still can't work it out, apparently according to the rules if you work it out you cant share the answer so&nbsp;I can't tell him how I worked it out hahahaha!  urlLink http://personal.baker.edu/web2/cdavis09/roses.html    &nbsp;  I got really drunk last night and ended up going back to Henry's, it's been so long since i got that bad that I had to crash at someone's place because I couldn't make it back home. My backs kind of sore now too.

      3am  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I'm still a little drunk from last night, me and a few friends went out for a drink and I drank more than I should have. It was kind of a last minute going away party. I'm going to miss not getting to see them so regularly, henry and maggie have become really good friends to me I didnt think that would have happened this time last year.  &nbsp;In exactly 12 hours I'll be on my way to the airport ready to start my new life. I can't wait. I've tied up almost all of my loose ends. A few I may just leave hanging as they really aren't worth the effort.

      I’ve spent all day thinking about it and I’ve decided that the best thing for me to do is to take the job in Atlanta. I’ve spent plenty of time wandering about and doing nothing and now I feel like its time for me to put down roots and stay in one place. Atlanta’s the perfect opportunity for me to do that, I can find a home there, build a career and basically start afresh away from all the shit that’s been messing with my head for the past 6 months.  &nbsp;The biggest mistake I made was turning it down last year; I’d already be settled there if I had taken the job instead of choosing to be with Jack. I don’t want to make a mistake like that again and like Viv says it’s time I started doing what’s going to make me happy instead of worrying about everyone else. I just want to settle down and have a decent routine. If it doesn’t work out I can always come back.  &nbsp;I’m leaving on Sunday; my flight leaves at 6pm. Tomorrow will be my last post for a few days.  &nbsp;   Am I doing the right thing?    Oh and Jonny sent me a txt telling me what a geordie slapper I was so I told him to go to hell and he thinks I'm over reacting, he won't be able to do that when I'm in Atlanta.   the plan is to fly back to ND on sunday, stay for a few days, pack up some stuff and then go to Atlanta. I'm going to spend a week or two looking for somewhere to live and get used to being there before I start work.

      &nbsp;So last night was the seventh night I've gone without sleep. I've been getting a couple of hours here and there. I'm starting to get really short tempered with people so today I put my mobile&nbsp;on divert to voicemail, unplugged my home phone, not answered the door and have&nbsp;been having as little&nbsp;contact&nbsp;with the outside world&nbsp;as I can manage without becoming completely bored before&nbsp;everyone decides they're better off hating me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;I must have fallen asleep around 9am but I woke up at 11 and my heart was racing, I took a couple of deep breaths and it seemed to go so I tried to get some more sleep but I woke up a half hour later with my heart racing again and feeling even worse than the first time. It felt like sweat was oozing out of every pore so I went and laid down on the cold tiles in my bathroom.&nbsp; I haven't eaten much these last couple of days, today was the first time I've woken up without throwing up but I think I preferred that to what I experienced this morning. I had this bad feeling in the pit of my stomach that my panic attacks were returning. Considering the crap I've been through in the last week I'm suprised I haven't had one already.  &nbsp; "I'm here if you need to talk" .......erm no you're not, you rarely are. And when you are I feel like a burden so what's the point?   &nbsp;  I was offered a job today, Carly left the message on my answerphone saying that she really wanted me to manage the business for her and that she didn't think there was anyone else she could trust to do it. I guess I'm flattered to be offered it. I was offered it about a year ago, when she found out she was pregnant&nbsp;and wanted to spend more time at home,&nbsp;I turned it down&nbsp;because things were begining to happen between me and Jack and the job is in Atlanta and I thought we were worth a decent shot at trying to make things worth, stuff had been getting in the way of us hooking up for years, what a massive mistake that was. I should have taken it and all this crap that I'm having to deal with now wouldn't be happening. I said I'd think about it and get back to her after the weekend. If I do take it I'd have to start in a couple of weeks. The job does sound like it'd be something that i'd enjoy. I've lived in Atlanta before and I have a couple of friends in and around the place so it wouldn't be like I would be totally alone there. It would be kind of like starting from scratch again, I'm not sure it's what I want and I'm not sure my heads in the right place to be making such a big decision.

      Anyhoo today I discovered from a friend that Henry went round to Jacks and warned him to stay away from me, Henrys a pretty scary looking bloke and apparently the message got across but Jack started quoting weird statistics as Henry was leaving like "70% of women are raped by men they know" and crap like that.    I was talking on MSN with Jonny and he said that if I didn't stop being mean to him he wasn't going to talk to me ever again, I said that if he didn't stop being irish I wasn't going to talk to him ever again and then he blocked me. He waited a few seconds and unblocked me and told me he loved me really and that he'd give it to me up the ass any time i wanted. I blocked him.

      Henry thinks he knows me better than anyone in the world. He says I can't come up with 100 things about myself that he doesn't know. I have a week.   1.  My real name is eaddon and most people don't know that.  2.  I'm 23 years old and intensely hate my birthday, partly because nobody remembers and partly because I feel stupid when people give me things.  3.  I intensely hates sloths and given the chance would wipe them from the face of the earth, unless someone can come up with an acceptable reason for there existance.  4. I lived in Atlanta for the best part of a year.  5.  I've slept with 7 men my entire life and I remember there names and their birthdays and if pushed I can probably tell you the names of their mothers.  6.  Last year I broke my leg, two of my toes (on seperate occasions) broken my rib and had my rib broken for me(not through choice)and nearly got stabbed in the eye.  7.  I can drive tractors, HGV's ,LGV's ,forklift trucks, motorbikes and cars.  8.  I swallowed my engagement ring once (i was made to) it now resides at the bottom of Lake Oahe. I bought it myself.  9.  I was pushed down the stairs once but suffered no injuries unlike the moron that pushed me who tripped over his own shoe and fell head first into a brick wall and split his head open thus requiring stitches.  10.  I've never cheated on anyone and I don't intend to.  11.  I never tell someone I love them if I don't.  12.  I believe that Morrisons is the greatest supermarket in the whole of the land and think they should build one nearer to my house but do it on some disused already scummy looking land and not chop down nice countryside to build it.  13.  I don't believe in "god".  14.  I believe in ghosts and that my grandmother often sits on the swing set outisde my house in the winter back in ND, sometimes really late at night when its all calm you can hear a womans voice softly singing in the breeze.  15.  If you're english I'll talk to you in my english accent, if you're american I'll talk to you in my american accent. I'm weird like that.   16.  I have a lot of questions to ask people who sport mullets.  17.  I like some of Harry Fonseca's work even though you've never heard of him.  18.  I think I'd probably like to do the whole get married and have kids thing.  19.  I listen to century radio more than metro radio, the baldy brothers were funny but they're gone now and that makes me sad.  20.  Barbra streisand annoys me, mainly because her names actually Barbara and she took out the extra 'a' for no apparent reason, I have no idea why or how I know that information.  21.  The hoobs is quality viewing, if I was a kid I'd like to be one.  22.  I used to watch the olympics as a kid but since linford christie packed in it's sucked.  23.  I'm predisposed to hate anyone called Colin.  24.  I don't particularily like the taste of alcohol.  25.  I've smoked off and on for the past 10 years.  26.  The main reason I was never arrested as a teenager was due to the fact that my best friend at the time was the sheriffs son.   27.  I have 3 mortgages and I can't spell that word without the aid of dictionary.com  28.  I tend not to spell my name with a capital letter.  29.  I  will  punch the next person who asks me if I can tell them what all that chanting in the enigma song means.  30.  I own shares in a casino although I never go cos I just know i'd develop a gambling problem.    31.  The 414 is my favorite.  32.  I have a wedding dress in my closet back home.  33.  I'm stronger than your average monkey.  34.  I had a weird german internet stalker who has probably tracked this down, so Hi!  he wanted me to give him my address so he could send me a birthday present.  35.  When I was a kid I wanted to win a gold medal at the olympics.

      today was a really shit day. I woke up thinking I couldn't feel any worse. I was wrong.   Everything I say seems to be coming out wrong, and I'm messing up the only good thing in my life at the moment. I just need to clear my head of all the shit that's running through it and he's taking it as me not wanting to see him. I just don't want to spoil the time we'll spend together by thinking and worrying about stupid crap like my ex being a bastard to me. He deserves my full attention. I feel bad for the way I'm treating him but after everything we've been through I don't want to rush into it and ruin something that could be really good. I want all the bad stuff to settle down or go away and I just hope that he doesn't get sick of waiting for me, I couldn't bear it if he did.   The thought that he'd be better off without me keeps returning, just the fact that I'm totally selfish and I want him so badly keeps me from ending things, its weird that i've come to care so much about him but I do and that makes me happy.

      No matter what I do my hair wont go curly, its always really really straight, damn my blasted genes!!!!     Henry came round this evening. He said he was worried about me and that I shouldn't be alone while Jack was still in town. We got talking and he said it may be a good idea for me to go away for a while to clear my head. He's probably right, He said he'd come with me if I didn't want to be alone. He's been really sweet these last couple of days I don't know what I'd have done without him. I don't feel so bad laying all my problems on him because he tells me all about his problems too. I don't feel like a burden to him. I am a burden to everyone else, I know I am.    Viv has his thing going on, he's finally happy with his life and I don't want to ruin that or put a dampner on things for him, that wouldn't be fair of me.   Tom said he's going through some "deep, emotional stuff" which i have no clue about and makes me feel like a real shitty friend because he obviously doesn't feel like he can talk to me about it. Plus I feel bad if I'm not all happy and stuff when I'm talking to him, I feel like I've been nothing but miserable and whiney and stuff and that he's trying to talk to me as little as possible because of it. I just can't do the whole fake happy thing. He said I could talk to him about it if I wanted but he made some comment about how talking about exes is not what people do in relationships so I figured that was him telling me he really wasn't that comfortable with it. If he's got stuff going on I don't want to complicate things for him by being in the way or whatever. He said something about how I'd want to go back to ND permenantly eventually, maybe that was some sort of a hint.   Anyhoo Henry says he's taken the rest of the week off work, he can do these things apparently because he's the boss. He's gonna come round about 10am and just hang out with me, I told him I hadn't been getting much sleep and that I was feeling ill a lot of the time so he's making me go to the doctor even though I really don't want to and then he says he'll stay with me if I want to catch up on some sleep. The doctor must think I'm a total hypochondriac.   "Listen or your tongue will keep you deaf"  springs to mind today.    todays mood  =

      I didn't drown myself in the bath as I had planned. Instead I went to the pub with my mate and started with the trebles. I've drunk loads of water and I'm starting to sober up so I shouldn't have a hangover in the morning, not that I ever do. Some bloke asked me to go back to his place, I nearly went but realised he's a moron and went back home by myself.again.    I'm really scared. I really really dont want to be on my own. I'm sick of talking to people, they're like "oh if theres anything i can do" blah blah. Nobody gets it.    I'm supposed to be able to share my problems with someone who has problems of there own but doesnt appear to want to share them with me. Life's just a big pile of crap and I could seriously do without having to deal with it.    Moving back to ND feels like a good idea right now.

      I said I'd probably meet him next week but I have this massive black eye and I dont want him to see me like that. It's mainly because I look utterly repulsive, more than usual at least, and also because I didn't tell him my ex decided to use my face as a punch bag. It's not the sort of the thing you can easily drop into conversation anyway.   I'm amazed at the fact I've kept this diary thing up. It's weird because I kept a diary for years and I get real uptight if I think anyones been reading it, plus I hate them forever if I find out they have. I don't know what I'd do if i found out someone close to me was reading this, I guess I wouldn't mind if they told me they were but I'd be pretty pissed if they were reading about stuff and not saying anything.   I didn't get any sleep last night, I felt like I was being kicked in the stomach all night long so I was really cranky when I finally decided to get out of bed and took it out on everyone who spoke to me. I haven't been out of the house since wednesday. I don't want to leave my bed.     Henry rang me to try and persuade me to go to the pub with him but I knew that would mean we'd be on the trebles and I wasn't really in the mood, plus I have a long drive tomorrow. I'll have the dog with me which means I'll be stopping every 20 mins to let him out so he can go familiarize himself with various trees along the way.

      woke up and was sick again. not good. Got up and had some toast and was fine. I was going to go out but I couldn't be bothered so I just curled up on the sofa and fell asleep. There was banging on the door and I'm pretty sure it was Jack but because Simon is away in Paris for the weekend I wasn't going to let him in to hit me or do worse damage to me.   I think he's all super worried that I might go to the police about it because this time I have a witness. His mother came round to see me and said that she was sorry her son had been like that and she believed me about the other times. better late than never. She thinks she can talk some sense into him and that he'd be worth another shot because "i'm the best thing that ever happened to him". I think these people are crazy. I've already wasted years of my life being beaten up by a creep who told me I didn't deserve any better, I'm not about to make the same mistake again. I'd rather hold out for something better.  I'm going back down to Vivs on Sunday morning. He's going to Manchester on Monday for some meetings or other so he'll need his car back, I'll have his place all to myself for a week and a half. I can't wait, peace and quiet is just what I need.

       I had a discussion with Margie, she says she feels sorry for me that I'm not close with my Mother,. Maybe if she was younger when she had me we might have been/ I've never shaken this feel of being a burden, that's why I moved out as soon as I could and probably why I went running into Brady's arms. I ruined her plans for an early retirement. I'm not close with most of my siblings. Viv I love to death and wouldn't be without. He's a total rock. He's always there for me and though I rib him about him being sponge he'd never ask for anything. We're pretty close in age, maybe that's why.  Ann I'm close to, she's more of a mother to me than my mother is. She lives in Atlanta so I don't get to see her that often, I think the last time I saw her was Xmas 2002. All through my childhood I expected someone to tell me that Ann was really my mum, wishful thinking maybe. I got a birthday card from her but with her sending it to Simons and me being at Viv's I didn't get it until I came back up here. I got a silver bracelet thing from her that she made, It was like the ones my granddad used to make. It's pretty.    Katie and I have pretty much picked up where we left off, although I'm wary. She said that her saying those things about hating me and stuff were said in the heat of the moment and I agreed that I said some shitty things too. I think that maybe she did say those things about me to Tom, maybe so that he'd end up hating me and I'd go running to her for a shoulder to cry on or something. It's easier to understand knowing how close she and I have been for the past couple of years.  The stupid thing about all of this is that when he told me about the stuff with Emmy texting him and stuff I did believe that he was telling me everything, but he made such a big thing about me thinking he's a liar and stuff, and when I did say that I believed him he thought I was just humouring him. I can't win.  How's that going to work in the future? Me not trusting him but when I finally do he won't believe me. I know he's a decent person and stuff and he wouldn't hurt me. And when he says he loves me I believe him and I haven't felt like that since Max died. It just annoys me that all that stuff came along to mess it all up and set things back.

      I was putting some of my stuff in the boot of Viv's car so I wouldn't forget to take it back down to London with me when Jack pulled up in his car. He got out and started going on about how Simon was in the pub talking to one of his mates about how I was back for a couple of days and he came over straight away cos he thought we needed to talk and it was really important that we do. He'd obviously been drinking. I told him pretty matter of factly that there was nothing I had to say to him ever again. I just kept on with what I was doing and he kept standing in my way so I'd look at him but I just kept moving around him and ignoring his babble about how we should try again. I figured I'd go in the house and lock the door and he'd get the message and go away, except he grabbed my arm when I turned around to go back inside. I asked him to let go of my arm politely and he did. I said he had two minutes to say what he wanted and then he would have to leave and he agreed. He kept going on about how sorry he was that he'd hit me when I'd gone round to his to pick up the rest of my things, things he hadn't let me have for 7 months. He said that I was being annoying at the time and he got irritated and frustrated and just lashed out at me and he knew it wasn't an excuse for what he'd done but it was the only explanation for it that he could give me. He said he could learn to control his anger in the future because I meant too much to him and he couldn't let me go without a fight, I didn't realise what sort of fight he was talking about but I was about to.   I told him for the hundredth time that I wasn't interested in having any sort of a relationship, that I didn't even want to say a polite hello if I passed him in the street and that I just want to forget that he exists and existed in my life. I could see him getting that same look in his eyes that Brady got just before he was about to fly off into one of his rages. I told him that I felt nothing for him and I never would. I turned around again but he grabbed me and turned me around to face him again, the feel of him touching me was turning my stomach. He was really hurting my arm so I pulled it away sharply and he let go of his grip. I could see that he was thinking about raising his hand, I could have moved out of the way but I didn't and he hit me .I laughed at him and said if he was going to bother to hit me he might as hit me like he meant it. It hurt like hell, my face went numb for a few seconds then it felt like it was on fire but there was no way in hell he was going to see me cry. He looked like he was about to apologise although for a second I sensed he might hit me again but Simon came running across so he just got back in his car and left. I can't say I've ever wished anyone dead but it would have been really great if he'd crashed head first into a wall and died after spending several days lying in unbearable agony. I pity his son having to grow up with a shit head like that for a father.   I went to the doctors about this lump but he said some waffle about what might be causing the soreness and not to worry about it, He asked me about my black eye so I told him. He gave me some leaflets about domestic violence and said he could put me in touch with a support group but I told him I knew pretty much all I needed to know about it and I didn't need his help. I keep thinking about Brady and how great the good times were and what it would have been like if things had been like that the whole time but then I remember the utter shit times that filled most days. I wasted 4 years of my life on that asshole.  The foot doctor was a bit strange and he kinds gives me the creeps, I'm glad the weather changed in the afternoon and I had changed out of my skirt because I wouldn't have been surprised if he'd tried to sneak a look up there, He would have got my boot in his face for his troubles.    All in all a busy day although apparently I'm supposed to do nothing but sit around on my fat ass all day. It's not like I have friends to hang around with or errands to run. I saw shrek 2 and did a bit of shopping, shame on me for getting out of bed and doing something with my day instead of whittling it away playing stupid computer games and watching neighbours.

      Why do I always end up thinking everythings my fault even when I haven't done anything. He was the one that brought the whole thing up and said that he was only doing it so I wouldn't think that he was going behind my back or something like that, that made me feel real bad as though I was forcing him to tell me or something. It felt like it was a real hassle for him to tell me what was going on. He made this whole big deal about How I dont trust him and that i think he's a cheating liar and stuff, why does he want to be with me if its so terrible that I dont trust him, Like its my fault i feel that way. Maybe I should just leave him alone, but I don't want to. Anyhoo I think i pissed him off with my text messages anyway.    I came back up to Newcastle this afternoon, I borrowed Viv's car for a couple of days. I've got to see the foot doctor again, I cancelled the last appointment but he was insistant that I keep this one. I've got an appointment for the regular doctor tomorrow evening, that lump I found in my breast has done nothing but ache for the past week or so and god knows that can't be normal. I'm going to get some more stuff and go back down to Viv's on thursday night. I've got the car so I can bring the dog back with me.

      Sandra had a 'heart to heart' with Bob, which means that she went round there again and let him fill her head with a bunch of soppy crap that has convinced her that he loves her and wants to make a real go of things. His latest piece of news is that he's willing to change, he's happy to get couselling to sort out his drink problem and is willing to go to anger management. Sandra will fall for it, she always does. He'll sweet talk her into staying with him so she wont stop giving him money for booze and weed. She says that when he told her he loved her that he really meant it. YOU DONT BEAT UP THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. I realized that the hard way, I wish she would.   And as if by magic he decides to tell me that she's been sending him text messages and stuff and he told her that they'd be friends cos she was crying on the phone and he was too much of a pussy to tell her to go fuck herself. anyway. Then the conversation went weird some of the stuff he said made out like we were talking about heresay as opposed to the 'facts' he had stated earlier.  It's fair to say he expects me to have a hissy fit over the littlest thing

      I've started talking to Katie again. I don't see why I have to believe what she 'supposedly' said about me and lose her as a friend when it seems that he continues to talk to one of his friends who called me an "evil bitch" and "a user" cos he apparently talked about all of our problems to her. If he's still talking to her then he's basically saying that its fine for her to call me names and put me down. This is all assuming that her claims that she still talks to him are true. I don't care that he is friends with her or not actually. I just don't want him to lie to me about it. I don't know who or what to believe anymore.  I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it. Urgh! I just feel so let down sometimes and it's frustrating. It only serves to remind me of all the bad shit we've been though all ready.

       6pm   I had the best sunday dinner I've had for ages. Viv makes the best mashed potato. I'm absolutely full. Sandra came over, she was feeling a bit down this morning when I called her to see how she was doing. She's sleeping on the couch now, I think it's the first bit of sleep she's had in a while. From the things she was saying she seems a bit unsure about wether leaving Bob is a good idea but i told her that was normal and I went through the same thing when I left my fiance. I keep telling her that getting away from him is the best thing for her. She had a heart attack a couple of years ago and living with Bob and his drinking and him being violent towards her isnt doing her health any good. I think she feels like she needs to take care of him, she needs to start putting herself first for once.  He said to her that he's changed but she knows he hasnt and never will. When she went back the other day to pick up some more clothes she got upset and he comforted her, She got angry that he thought things were alright and that she would give things another try.   I think she does want to leave him for good, she just needs reassurance that she's doing the right thing.

      Nothing of great interest happened. I slept most of the day. I messed about on the Xbox for a little bit and then I went to the pub. There was some moron who kept trying to chat me up, and the drunker he got the braver he was in trying to touch me. In the end I told him real politely that if he put his hands on me again I'd have to break his wrists. He kept trying to buy me double vodkas but I had to tell the barman not to let him, I figure he thought that if he got me drunk I'd go home with him. Me and Sandra were trying to have a quiet night out. We talked about lots of rubbish.   The above sentence took me about an hour to type.  I also got a goat for my birthday, don't ask why. It needs a name so if anyone has any ideas?

      1:30am    1:30am  My Parents forgot it was my birthday which was nice (sarcasm in case you missed it). I didn't even get a phone call. They're old so I guess I should make allowances. I got a card and a dirty text message. Maybe I should make a fuss about it next year and see how many presents i can rake in, or maybe not. It didn't feel like my birthday. Tom phoned me and that was cute.

I turned 23 today.     i might buy meself one of these and take pics of really pointless things   It was Camerons birthday yesterday, I posted his present. I hope he likes it. He's a year and a day older than me, pfft.  I think I'm going out for a meal later. Not sure tho. A highly uniteresting day all round.

       I got up early this morning and took Pip and Takoda for a long walk, we walked around some of the trails near mitford then I packed them in the car and took them for a run on the beach, it was a bit drizzly but it was still pretty, cos it was early there was no-one around for miles and really peaceful.  I went into Newcastle with Henry this morning it was really sunny, he was looking for something for his uncle, some rare model or other but he couldn't find it anywhere. He came back here and we did some investigating on some nerdy websites and theres a shop in York with one so he rang them and asked them to keep it for him and he'd go collect it tomorrow, so tomorrow we're going to York. I like York.    I found out Gramma's gone on holiday this week to some place in scotland, She just flits off all over the place and forgets to tell people.    The Parents are coming up tonight so I have to go for dinner with them soon. Mom's friend 'auntie' Chris is coming, she's cool she's nice to me and doesn't remind me of all my faults while we're eating. Hopefully she'll keep my mother busy talking about knitting or something equally boring so I can get drunk in peace.    I had a long Chat with Cam this afternoon about the state of his love life, it seems the poor dear is a bit confused with things. He lent his sister some money which means he's had to put off coming over for a visit, I offered to help him out but he refused. He's so stubborn!

      I did absolutely nothing, I stayed in bed for most of the day and I only woke up when Henry rang me for a chat, he babbles on for hours that boy. I went to the pub for a couple of hours but it was dead so i didn't fancy staying until last orders, plus the weather was starting to turn and if i'd have stayed I would have gotten drenched.

      Couldn't find my key today so I was stuck indoors for most of it, I probably wouldn't have gone out anyway because it was pouring with rain. It eased up about 6pm and I went to the pub for a few pints with John, we didnt get a chance to catch up the other day, he got stuck working inside. Ronny was there too, he's an old friend of my dads, he kept pinching my cheeks and telling me I was the double of my mother.   Newcastle played Middlesborough in the first game of the season and in true typical newcastle style we lost the lead right at the end of the match and ended up with a draw, it could have been worse I guess we could have been beaten. The goal was a handball and the ref still award it, talk about injustice. PFFT! oh and he was totally offside too.

      Typical, friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky or something right, so I wake up to find that the river has burst its banks and is now covering half my garden. The good bit in all of this is that I got a visit from the fire brigade with sandbags to cover my door, like that'll actually do any good. Nevermind, Cos the garden is on a hill at the back it's unlikely the river will reach the house. It just means that I can't cross the bridge, they'll have closed it off and that connects me to the main road and if I can't get on the main road I wont be able to go anywhere and If I want to go to the pub later I'll have to trek through the woods for about four miles and with the rain the path will be all the muddy so i'll probably sink so it looks like I'm staying in tonight.

      went to danny's pub. John was in apparently he's in there every night, it's his new local. I hadn't seen him for months. He's been working out, his arms are really muscley now. His hair is getting long too, he's not blonde like i remember him. He pretended he hadn't seen me for most of the night and then when I said goodnight to Henry and left John came jogging up to me and said he'd walk me home despite the fact that i live miles away from him, anyhoo I said ok and we chatted a bit. I didn't think it would be so weird just being normal around him and not flirting outrageously like we used to. He was married at the time so I guess that's why nothing ever happened between us. He's divorced now, he told me several times. He walked me right up to the door and said he'd heard about all the shit that had happened with Jack and that he'd look out for me and stuff, he said he always had been and that just because we hadn't been chatting it didn't mean he didn't care. He was quite sweet. He pecked me on the cheek and went home. He said we should meet up for a drink and catch up properly and I told him i'd like that so he said if the rain was as bad as it was today he'd be in the pub cos he'd have to down tools and he might as well waste the day away in there.

      Thursday (day 1) arrived in Paris just after noon, went to hotel to dump our stuff, had a stroll around some of the sites. Simon picked us up in early evening and took us to his gf's parents farm for a bbq type thing on some traditional rustic farm,the kind you see on channel 4 in the afternoon that some middle class family who've tired of london have bought. Simon told his in laws I was in the property business and the Dad kept telling me about how he was going to restore the place to its original condition, how he wanted it to be just like it was intended, I casually said "you'll want to take out all the laminate flooring you've just put in then", he wasnt too impressed. we left soon after that.  Friday (Day 2) got up really early, drove through belgium some of the places there have some really weird looking names, We got to Brussells just in time for lunch so we found this nice quiet little cafe and grabbed a bite to eat, Henry's totally into history and architecture and all that stuff so he was loving walking along looking at the palace and the parliament building and stuff, we did some window shopping in the Boulevard de Waterloo too before we set off again for Cologne, Germany.  Saturday (Day 3) Henry speaks fluent German, that was a surprise. Turns out his mother was half german and spoke nothing but german to him every other day up until she died. It's weird what you find out about someone when you're in a confined space and can't escape (i.e a car) not that I wanted to escape. Phil lives in Germany somewhere and when I mentioned that I'd visited Cologne a couple of years ago he started going on about how he knows that place or lives near it or something like that, or maybe it was that he didnt know the place and didn't live near it. He said I should go and visit him one day and I said ok and maybe if we'd planned this trip a little better I would have gotten his address properly or something. Last time I was in Cologne it was December and my mother made me walk around a Christmas Market at night, the cathedral was pretty cool all illuminated and looking pretty against the night sky and I was drinking mulled wine and chatting to some cool old german bloke. This time it was the middle of summer. We walked up one side of the Rhine and back down the other, then we did this 'medieval route' Henry had found out about from some american tourist who was in the hotel bar last night, that took up a couple of hours, then we went to get drunk in a couple of german pubs, they get really pissy with you if you don't put your drink on a beer mat.  Sunday (Day4) We drove down to stuttgart, well to a little town just outside. Some of Henrys family grew up there and he had a couple of addresses he wanted to check out so he spent half the day trying to find them so he could take a couple of photos for his aunty so she can tell him all about how much the place has changed. Some of the places he was looking for had been knocked down and replaced by some real hideous looking houses. We went into stuttgart and found a place to crash for the night, I wanted to see Palace square cos I'd heard people yapping about it so we went there, It has an amazing fountain nice gardens but not too impressive, and then we went to some fancy restaurant for dinner and then to an irish pub for a drink that was full of americans before going back to the hotel cos I was knackared from walking around all day.

      2am  We talked and by talk i mean him asking me if i've seen this movie or that movie. I feel like I'm talking to a stranger not somebody who supposedly wants to be with me. I can't do it anymore, theres no way I'll go see him anytime soon if things don't get any better.  Things aren't the same anymore because he suddenly can't tell whether I'm joking or not, so to save arguements I only say the bare minimum. Having not really spoken for a while and the times before that having stupid fights I just don't say very much anymore. Like i'd call him a pervert and say he was only after one thing if we were talking about sex and stuff and for months he laughed it off but recently he decides that it "confuses" him because on some level i must really mean it, so we just dont talk about that now. Assuming he chooses talking to me over getting stoned.  I sent him an email earlier saying I was going away for a while and wouldn't be taking my phone so we wouldnt get to talk for a bit and didnt say a thing about it, like it doesnt even bother him that we wont talk. I just feel like I'm nothing to him and I don't like it.

      6pm  Yesterday was shit.  Margie thinks i have nothing better to do than sit in a pub by myself waiting for her to turn up. she waited until half an hour after i was supposed to meet her before she bothered to ring me and tell me she'd decided in the morning not to come and meet me and go to visit her mother instead, so that pissed me off.  Then Anne landed on my doorstop after months of me not seeing her, she wanted a coffee and to unload her problems on me before telling me she needed some money and leaving again. She only ever shows her face when she needs something. Tomorrow I'll probably tell her I have a cash flow problem and can't help her out. She needs to learn to manage her finances better and she won't do that if I help her out all the time. It's not like she hasn't got any money anyway she just spends it on stuff she doesn't need before she pays her bills.  Nicki's mother was in the pub, she came over to tell me that Nicki was pregnant and living with a drug dealer or something and because I vaguely know the guy it's my responsibilty to tell her what a huge mistake she's making. It's got fuck all to do with me.  Everyone's gossiping about me and Henry about how we've been sleeping together etc. Who knows whaere that pathetic tale came from. why can't a guy and a girl be friends without everyone assuming somethings going on?  Then I had a conversation with an idiot who thinks I have nothing better to do than sit around aand wait for him to talk to me, and by talk I mean badger me to download crappy songs, tell me how all I do is insult him and he's only ever nice back to me and generally tell me how I'm such a shitty person. He twists stuff around to and says that he "didnt mean it to sound that way" if i show the slightest hint of being offended at it and i'm just misunderstanding things like i'm too stupid or something. When he says he loves me it just feels like its out of habit, like its something you'd say to a friend when you're leaving.  Creys gets married tomorrow at 4pm so that should be fun. London on wednesday, who knows where after that, maybe Atlanta. lol.

      July is over.  I got back from Henrys about 4pm, he made me a proper Sunday lunch, complete with mash potato even though old potatoes are out of season or something and you’re supposed to have new potatoes but I don't like them so I was happy with me mash. He's quite a good cook. I showed him the video clips that Phil sent me, I'm teaching Phil (who happens to be German) some Geordie phrases and he sent me clips of him saying them over msn, quite hilarious. Phil is quite a funny guy and his English is really good, sometimes I suspect the whole 'being German' thing is a lie but then I'm a skeptic or so I've been told. I woke up at about 6am this morning and Henry was out for a jog, what sort of person goes jogging that early on a Sunday?!? It's insane, I used to go running with Paul but he hurt some part of his ass and had to stop and it’s not that much fun running on my own. Round here is great for it though, there’s loads of little paths through woods and fields and stuff, there's one track that goes by the river then over a little hill and through a field and conveniently meanders back to the pub. Anyway when I woke up I thought about just disappearing for a couple of months, I'd tell my parents and brother and Simon that I was going away of course so that they wouldn't worry or report me as a missing person, but I could leave my phone behind and just cut myself off from the world. Peace and quiet would be great. Nobody could find me to bother me or hassle me about pointless crap.   Travis gave me some tips on how to defend myself the other day, I reassured him that I know the most affective ways to injure someone and if that wasn't enough I made sure I always had a knife close at hand.  I spoke to Mike on the phone for a couple of hours last night, its weird that he's so far away but he's only a couple of hours ahead of us. Apparently he's made a bunch of friends and has been flirting with some girl who works in a store he purposely visits and he's working up to getting her phone number, so much for the shy guy I once knew. It's great that he's finally coming out of his shell.  Dill is dating some 34 year old college lecturer and her mom wants me to have a word with her and let her know what she's in for and basically tell her it's not such a good idea seeing as I have experience in that area, I told her it wasn't any of my business and it was up to Dill what she does with her life. I haven't really spoken to her since that whole business a while back, she's called me a couple of times but I haven't picked up the phone or returned her calls.  I've been drinking loads recently and I probably shouldn't but its fun and I get to forget the shit that enters my head the other 95% of the time I'm conscious.  I bought some fantastic heels from this place in Newcastle, they were really expensive but totally worth it, it's not often I spend such a ridiculous amount of money on shoes but it's always nice when I do.  I have a bunch of stuff that I need to post to Jenn in Chicago, I've been meaning to send her the stuff for ages but I keep forgetting or thinking that I should wait until I get something else. It's going to cost me a small fortune. I'm calling it a belated birthday present; I'm not going to tell her I'm sending it so hopefully it should come as a nice surprise to her.   My parents landed this morning; I spoke to them on the phone a few minutes ago. They're in London and staying at Viv's before coming up here. I said I wasn't sure if I would see them what with me maybe going to Paris next week. Dad suggested I go down there for a couple of days and then go over to see Simon. He said Paris sounded like fun and he and Mom might go for a couple of days themselves.   I'm meant to be meeting Margie in the pub later on; we haven't had a proper natter for ages. She keeps telling me about the honeymoon in Bulgaria like I haven't already heard it a hundred times before but I smile and nod and seem interested to humour her. I might have a couple of drinks with her and then come home and have an early night.   Lately I have mostly been listening to The Pixies and some Live Queen stuff.   I was at my Gramma's house the other day and was looking through a bunch of stuff she had in her loft and look what i found  my bear!  It's about 40 years old, some uncle or nephew or cousin gave it to me when I was a little baby and he was going into the army and he'd had it for 20 years since he was a baby. My gramma says I should pass it on to Liv or someone but I told her to forget that idea i'm keeping it untill I die. I'm selfish
