      Tired with all these for restful death i cry,  As to behold desert a beggar born,  And&nbsp;needy nothing trimmed in jollity,  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,.. If even shakespeare feels this way, perhaps abandoning the entire world isn't a mistake, onli an attempt failed tinged with thoughts tt can't be bore. As memory may be a paradise from which we cannot be driven, it may also be a hell from which we cannot escape. And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.   True tears&nbsp;is a constitution&nbsp;of those tt fall from the eyes and cover the face&nbsp;together with&nbsp;those that come with hurt and bleeds&nbsp;within the heart. If I ever know tt it's to be abandoned, i fear not for the time to come, since time would come to take it all, whether u wan it anot. Time bears it away, and in the end there's only darkness. Sometimes we find others in the darkness, and sometimes we lose them there again.. perhaps thus, thou shall feel no pain. Sick of explanation. Life sux.   Take so called life away then, but&nbsp;god didn't. Parents dared not work.&nbsp;Bro skipped Ns. His sis got condemned. Her true frend came in the middle of the night, apprehensive and shocked. Have not reached the ides of life, got reprimanded by buddy and scared poor josh. Stunned Tian yong aka mr fat although he's not.

      Yesterdae was a fun dae, i have switched to pistol instead cos the coach&nbsp;told mi to try pistol out. Josh kept his word and he had really signed the membership up for mi. Was so touched and elated, i kept smiling and even dreamt of studying literature the nite before.   Skipped tutorial todae.. Have made the decision to quit poly soon, probably tmr.. I believed i have startled almost everyone who learns about it. Nothing to fear though, cos deep down, I'm clear of my so called nonsensical actions, tired of explaining too, scold if they wan to and feel free to pretend they know when they dun..   Met up with chin hao just now as all his lessons were cancelled. He treated mi to baked rice and a game of pool as a farewell gift. Could sense how much he missed Mj&nbsp;too, just tt he can't afford to take the risk as the impending NS daes are approaching him soon. Really glad for all his fervent and sincere encouragement and help ever since the first foot i lifted into Mj. It was him who brought mi&nbsp;to explore Mj on&nbsp;nov 18. =)   Darling sze teng aka chicken just called mi, lol, she told mi to write good stuff about her. >.    Todae is Kaye's birthdae. It's been about a month and so since we last met. Time flies.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      It's 2:04 am now.. Just ended my conversation with Josh josh. I have not shot for 2 months plus.. But miracles do happen.. He's going to apply membership for mi in safra later as an early birthdae gift.. He's so nice, i can't believe it. Lol, my bro here is wonderful.. love him lots&nbsp;=) That means i will go to safra every now and then for fun to shoot which in turn means tt i can account better to Mr Cheong, the greatest teacher one can ever have.   Meeting Jeremy at 8 later, looking josh up at range at 2 plus and buddy at marina bay for dinner. Cancelled the escape outing, kind of happy though. =)

      Just completed my essay.. The topic is whether teenagers should vote in the singapore elections, and for tt, i read up the entire political system.  School was rather nice as in the hrs is short. However, sharon and rui ting were like in a total bad mood, leaving mi pondering over what happened.&nbsp; They were also pissed off with samuel, tim, joseph and I. Lol, cos we didn't concentrate on doing the project wholeheartedly but probably becos we were all in high spirits. I have just gotten my withdrawal form todae as well.  After the project, I played badminton with them. I was restricted from those intense actions cos i was in a skirt and thus, couldn't really run or bend. Gald to sae, my double partner was Samuel and is a understanding gentleman, he didn't blame mi for not coordinating well.&nbsp;Timothy really surprised mi todae with a marvellous literature work. It was a poem he titled ' for a lady', his sec 3 lit piece. It wasn't&nbsp;exactly superbly&nbsp;enchanting but really captivating as sincerity is portrayed, not with the least bit of hypocrisy. I couldn't believe tt it was actually written by him and I truthfully liked it so much, i took it home, lol. Also, the songs he played on the guitar simply depicted the other soft side of him. Samuel said tt Tim has a soft heart deep down. This fellow hu smokes, oogles at girls, talks nonsense, has&nbsp;totally changed my impression of him todae. Somehow, i feel happy for the one he is going to be with in future.  At about 6, i got back home and was naturally late for my next appointment again. Honestly, i went onli becos my buddy dated mi.&nbsp;Was feeling really uneasy, understand her kind intentions for todae, but ever since i have closed my doors two months ago, i dun intend to open it again at the moment. Lol, she is so cute though, persistently feels tt she is going to find the key and someone to subdue mi. But yet some hurt&nbsp;has&nbsp;yet to be&nbsp;ebbed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I seem to have gotten my momentum back. I feel tt life is more colourful todae.  Skipped two lectures todae. Initially wanted to go back home for some sleep but still glad to sae, buddy called. Her voice emitted sadness so i hid my fatigue from her cos she would either chase me home to sleep or feel bad. Hehe.. Sad to sae, she is feeling lost, rather helpless i must sae. We have a plan in mind yet it's whether we have the courage to implement it, to take the chance that's far to risky cos we are getting old. Went for lunch together in pasir ris but she was broke so we shared the last 7 bucks i had cos i am broke too. Lol, weird to sae, really dun feel the pain even&nbsp;when i'm cashless cos certain frends are really worth it. A happy thing is tt we are meeting again tmr. =) She made mi 3 roses, how sweet.  Just printed 20 pages of info on the parliament. Have nv tot tt politics is so exciting. I am basically going to cramp the history of it into my head tmr and write the expository essay out by sat.   Currently still on msn with poor sean, still rushing thru the articles for pw. Glad he joined air rifle or i would have missed this frend here. =) Sulin just msged mi too, it's so touching, she wrote mi stuff tt really lit my dae up. Sighz..   It's 12:54 now, going to pretend to sleep soon cos my father is going to hack mi&nbsp;with his 0.22 air gun&nbsp;and is trying to put an evil scheme into practice which is to compel his adorable daughter to sleep at 11:59. -__-''

      It's a sad day. Went to many places, experienced and witnessed the various kinds of sorrows one can feel in life's journey.&nbsp;Not all are felt by mi.. But&nbsp;i am&nbsp;able to understand their stirred up emotions.  &nbsp;  Started the dae by hunting for the lyrics of Ou de yang's Gu dan bei ban qiu for Sean. It was 12 plus in the morning and I couldn't sleep so i guessed i might as well help a friend&nbsp;if i can&nbsp;brighten up his dae by doing a good deed. It was tedious as&nbsp;my  urlLink internet  was full of problems, annoying me so badly tt i decided to&nbsp;call my frend, ask for the lyrics and write them all out on my own instead. It was 1 plus, poor thiam boon was called up&nbsp;since he is my best male frend, supposedly still awake. Lol, he said tt&nbsp;i&nbsp;seem to be testing his chi when i made him read them out for mi. Hence, i wrote them out with the help of my dictionary for it has been ages since i&nbsp;really put pen to paper in chi. Not really sure of wad i had done, onli knew tt everything was completed onli at 3 plus.  &nbsp;  I woke up at 8+ to rush down to purchase an MC for i really wanted to go support the team instead of being in the lt when ur heart and soul isn't there. Was reprimanded by my parents again for the same reason, but if  urlLink time  were to be turned back, my actions would still remain the same cos i think that it's worth it. But this  urlLink time  round it's rather serious cos there's a possibility tt i may get debarred from the exams. Nevertheless, not going for the comp todae would&nbsp;simply mean tt i would regret for the rest of my life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jorcelyn didn't do well todae. Looking at her&nbsp;sobbing uncontrollably simply made my heart sank. I pulled her towards me and wiped her tears away, comforting her with wadever i could bring myself to say. In fact, i felt the hurt building up inside mi then, like a wall ready to crumble, not becos I feel tt they didn't do well but becos I&nbsp;felt wad i shudn't feel again.&nbsp;The torment of&nbsp;this stubborn misery nv seems to lose its control for more than&nbsp;a&nbsp;few daes.&nbsp; Really warm tt they can come till this far and I have faith tt it will achieve even more astounding results.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We went for lunch after everything, talked to Mr Cheong about tt thing and he proposed 10 of august for mi to take action. To be honest, i am afraid for numerous thoughts flashed through my mind for the emotional barrier still exists. The confusion makes mi apprehensive. Kohji said sumthing during tt  urlLink time  todae which totally changed my impression of him. He's indeed a sentimental chap and i'm glad he's here instead of where he felt he shud be.&nbsp;Wad happened to Jing Na todae&nbsp;came as an impact tt crashed into her like a high speed bullet train tt i felt really sad for her too. Mr Cheong related the story to Jorce and&nbsp;I to make her feel better.  &nbsp;  Met buddy todae. Felt really gd to meet her for I can't seem to&nbsp;feel comfortable&nbsp;through a week w/o her company. =)  urlLink Hp  went out of batt and she had to call josh to ask where i was, glad to sae, my beloved bro told her to rush down quickly as he was worried cos i'm reaching tt area soon. Wad a nice frend. hehe. Could tell tt he was feeling low.. Sulin&nbsp;and mei kwan looked dejected too..  &nbsp;  Anyway, glad tt i'm meeting my og in Escape on Sundae.. Buddy is bringing her boy and someone of whom she mischieviously refuses to reveal his identity to mi. =/ I have wonderful ogls and group mates of whom buddy is obviously most important to mi.  &nbsp;  I have done the most impossible things this yr, gone&nbsp;against everyone&nbsp;who cared for mi but to be honest, i have nv regretted the actions and am willing to face the impending consequences. The worse is&nbsp;over.&nbsp;It is not just a  urlLink memory  but a constitution of hurt, disappointment and pain. What i loathe most is when pple pretend to know when they dun. I guess onli Jeremy would understand this feeling.

      Currently listening to Angels brought me here by Guy Sebastian. A rather captivating song.. Just came back not long ago after meeting Josh, Nich and Kian tong..  &nbsp; I really miss tt clique&nbsp;i must sae. We have had times too valuable to be exchanged for any amount of gold, at least to mi. At least i had 5 months with them. Perhaps it's fate tt i had to leave but then again it must have been angels tt brought mi there to get acquainted to them. Wishes dearest Jorcelyn and the rest of the gerls best of luck tmr. =) &nbsp; Rui Ting&nbsp;surprised mi with a friendster testimonial todae. I felt quite sad yet touched. The two pple tt i can't bear to leave would be sharon and her i guess. She told mi tt she feel heartbroken whenever i mention about leaving. Regardless of whether it meant to be a joke or whether it's sincere, I feel touched for whatever she has done for mi.. Copying notes for mi when i skipped classes for my competition, putting up with my moanings and groanings and e guidance when I got lost in my csa lecture while playing friendster instead of listening to the lecturer. =]  &nbsp; Heartwarming to have some friends tt are real, even when everyone else including ur family blames u for not doing wad is deemed as rite.&nbsp;A friend&nbsp;told mi tt he dun believe tt i am&nbsp;doing all these for no reason. It takes understanding for one to be so certain about something especially when i didn't tell him wad happened and tt facts and evidences were all against mi. Trust depicted made mi feel tt i am not alone..   &nbsp;

      This is my second blog cos i have decided to cast certain memories aside, leaving certain emotions etched behind at the boundaries of dejection.   It's a moment for mi worth to be rejoiced over for this indicates a new start..   I had a nitemare just now.. Dreamt of an eerie range and the onli pple whom were with mi in the dream were sean, nich and perhaps hafiz? Not sure, could onli rem my aunt floating about with extremely red lipstick. My beloved  urlLink baby  cousin, darius was floating about too.. Everything was ghastly.. All a sudden, I received a fonecall from some eccentric fellows telling mi tt i am down with a sickness called  urlLink Chocolate  rulez cursed souls.. I was like wad? The id of the other party read 'Dr oeioei hp' on my mobile.. It was quite lame. The lady cried tt i needed an operation immediately cos of my knees and it would take 10-15 daes. I onli rem tt i bought her story and was like worried cos i needed to study. Suddenly the line got cut off.   I woke up, msged my darling sze teng, telling her tt i was frightened. How nice of her to call mi immediately. She's very sweet and caring i must sae..lol. But i was really afraid, cos the onli thing that came to my mind was tt i wouldn't be able to shoot for life and tts drastic. Furthermore, i can't do outdoor activities animore, how dreadful.. It seemed real cos my mum's legs are having some pros and even had to undergo some weird op.   Hey I went out of my rm and told my bro tt i had a nitemare. Being the most caring bro, he told mi to get lost, dun irritate him and shut up! Lol, at certain point of  urlLink time , i really dunno whether tts funny or something to be depressed over.   I called josh and told him about it. Lol, well he's someone very important to mi in meridian cos he's my god brother. =) Really feel the brotherly  urlLink love . My buddy, Serene is also in his class. Met her on mon, tues, wed, fri last week. We are very close i must sae and my world revolves about her now. Feels weird when she didn't  urlLink contact  mi todae. They are both older than mi by a yr and I truly miss them. Glad to sae, i have nv let them down as a frend i guess.   Too many happy memories left behind in this sch. Despite the fact of being in bv for ten yrs, the five months spent in mj have long surpassed the ten yrs of  urlLink love  for a sch. It gave mi  urlLink energy  i have nv seen before. =)   Currently listening to Ekin Cheng's theme song for the legend of speed. It's in canto, dun really understand, rather antagonizing, but in a sense, maturity, together with a serene and tanquil feeling is emitted. Just ended my conversation with sean, eggie, on msn.. Well, both nich and him are the extremes of the eng world and yet they possess such great difference in personality. Lol, just translated one entire song of ou de yang for him both in eng and han yu pin yin. He's so cute, telling mi tt he's going to bug his chi b tutor to write him the lyrics and to depict the song. Lol, quite fun anywae since lit and chi are fav subs.   It's 2:05 in the morning and yet i do not feel the least weary. Perhaps it's due to the fact tt i feel peace in the night, no pandemonium, nobody beside mi, stressing mi to vibrate my vocals..

      It has been two consecutively perfect or almost perfect daes. =)  16 August. I arrived at the doors of bengawan solo at 9:10 for Mei Kwan's cake. Omg, it was still closed, ready onli at 10am. Feeling a little lost, i could feel the disappointment tt would be constricted in e team's hearts. A tot then flashed thru my mind, leading mi to lift the metal doors up, with the help of the fruit seller, lol. The two salesgirls were shocked at my barging in. But then again, i got the cake after going to change coins for them n..., just tt i was late, as usual. Kian tong, nic and teng were sent to open the gate, i felt like an alien in home clothes, trespassing mj. It was a rather emotional dae her Mei kwan.  Hmm, after recess, sat in the canteen with my ex classmates, then after they left came along Elicia and Shanshan, followed by buddy then came along the most impt one, Mr cheong! I dashed up to him as i have been waiting for him for hrs.  Was initially just intending to seek for his advice, but we ended up seeing Miss lai immediately. Omg, wasn't e least prepared. But he was so nice, alleviating my fears. My impression of Miss Lai was a ferocious tiger. Astoundingly, she was very nice, i was stunned and still am. She didn't even pose any qns to make things difficult for mi. I told her my reasons, she listened and analysed them understandingly. After tt, she said ' ok, i will see u next yr, we will take u back'. =X I was flabbergasted and i still am. Mr Cheong said things like he gave mi inappropriate advices then, causing to the sequence of events. It wasn't his fault, he knows it, it was just to add on to help mi. I am really touched. My respect for him increased. My impression of Miss Lai has changed a total 180 degrees. I felt faith in the world. My last verse was 'thank you Miss Lai', in it conveys not onli gratitude, but with true respect as well..  Buddy was the first to learn about it, she was screaming together with mi, Mr cheong was shaking his head and laughing at us. Teng was also very happy for mi, hugging and feeling retardedness in elation. The uncertainty is finally over, onli with obstacles tt would have to be conquered bravely.  Went to safra for training todae. Coach Gai taught mi pistol for the first time. His skills are superb and wad he taught was really brilliant. Had shot pistol twice, but was oblivious of the techniques. I was shocked at my shots too actually. Both coach zhang and coach gai were like very pleased? Coach gai told mi to continue with pistol instead but Coach zhang hesitated cos my experiences originated from rifles. Sighz, dunno, leave it up to Mr Cheong, I might disappoint myself after all. *Touch wood. Miss Coach Li, he has alwaes been so nice to mi, giving mi the most pallets while i tot him sum basic vocab which he learnt it so cutely, hehe.. Sighz, he's gone back to china and i didn't even said any last words. =(  The dae was great though. Sumone really surprised mi with the bdae present too. =) Pleasant surprise though. Hee yep, feel fat and broke, but nvm, the daes were impeccably spendid.

      It's a peaceful sundae, had to be a good gerl cos i came home late last nite and hence, i didn't go for training todae.  Somehow, Darling ting just managed to make mi appear at paragon with her yesterdae for the mass dance. (She cheated, she used emotions and guilt as the art of persuausion =P) I danced onli for two dances and of which the couple dance was out of complusion. I have basically forgotten the dance steps and during tt period of time, i just remembered how patient lucien was with mi for it. Lol, a sweet ogl whom knew all the steps at the back of his palm, accomodating to mi, the idiot. Orientation -__-   We went to get Mei kwan her farewell gift after tt. Was actually feeling a kind of inexplicable joy when i saw them again, so Jorce, Mei jin and i went to mac and stayed there till they chased us out. Going to bring mei kwan a cake tmr during their recess as requested and tt means tt i will force myself to wake up early no matter wad. It's saddening cos she's migrating.  Listening to ge qian. Its captivation is tinged with sadness, collected yet arousing. The secret is safe as coincidentally tested upon. I wasn't wrong about him. The dressing downs from my family, friends and everyone else were worth it. No regrets although it was hell, cos in the journey, i felt bliss. Who could ever understand? Amongst these feigned intelligence may their ignorant comments cease and be scoffed at. I express no compunction and no explanation for e exasperating souls.   12:29 am. Feeling a little fat and wanting to watch the notebook again.

      It's 2:30am now. The past 2 daes were kind of nice overall despite the evolution of certain unhappy incidents tt took place. But i have mastered a skill from joshua, which is to focus on other things and dun even think about e unhappy stuff.  I feel like i have just enrolled into a gp class cos at this point of  urlLink time , i'm still  urlLink writing  a gp essay for sze teng hu sincerely possess this heartfelt hatred for gp and on wed, while i was happily with buddy eating in mac, josh suddenly msged mi to tell mi tt his essay needs to be handed up the dae after. Then after tt, sze teng called mi to protest cos josh happily told her tt i would complete his gp for him and she jealously said tt it was unfair. Lol, faints.. I dunno whether she is cute when she said tt cos tt means i have more work to do. =X But it's ok, i dun mind cos i actually feel kind of delightful after they feel retardedly happy when they are freed from gp. Lol.. Life is short and during these daes when i have no sch, they have been accompanying mi emotionally. It's gd tt in the period of  urlLink time  spent in life, we are able to bring on smiles to pple tt are close to our hearts. Oh yep, am touched too, cos thiam boon actually went to find the info on nathan martinez and.. for mi.  Hmm, sumthing significant tt really made my dae was tt my beloved shane had finally gotten his o level chi results. Omg. I was so happy for him, he was behaving retardedly in joy. I expected this A1 from him anyway, but it's really intoxicating when it's reassured. Hope we can have the third consecutive A1 from Kaye next yr, I have complete faith in her. hehe, still very happy, he's so close to mi tt ever since young till now, pple have alwaes mistaken this cousin of mine to be my childhood sweetheart cos we used to look alike and now, they sae we look like a couple. Lol.  Would be meeting josh and maybe serene aka buddy later.. The other daes would probably be seeing Elicia, chin hao and the same old few i guess.. My mother was grumbling on how she would ever find mi if i'm out w/o my fone and i'm in trouble cos she was basically feeling tt i'm not like my brother hu would leave her his friends' nos. So ok, sighz, everydae affair, diverse comparisons.. So i left her serene's, chze yin's, joshua's and thiam boon's nos..  Going to be rather busy these daes that I'm actually rather lost and indecisive of which activity i should indulge in. My ex mj classmates called mi up cos they are short of helpers for the charity stuff and I agreed to help, but my mother is going to have a loadful of comments so i would shun away from those words to do wad i think is right.  It's 3:24 now, have got to get down to pen and paper or else my darling teng teng would get into trouble later. It's Zheng yang's bdae todae too so Happy birthdae! He's a nice guy ya, my ogl and dance partner. Oh yep and i feel very fat now.

      It was a wonderful dae. I met up with my extremely close  urlLink friends  back in secondary sch, chze yin aka maomao, chiu yan and teresa. =)  It has been some  urlLink time . We were at bugis taking neo prints again. The four of us took for the first  urlLink time  then after tt, i just blurted out the fact tt i felt like taking again and teresa was like yayaya, let's take again. Thus, onli e two of us were scrambling into the brightly lighted machine cos yan and mao are more sensible and hence, thrifty, so it leaves us as insensible extravagant morons. Lol, it's typical of us cos i think the two of us are fanatic fans of that non-living thing.  They have not changed, still the same old good  urlLink friends  of mine and have simply made my dae just by talking nonsensical nonsense. Oh yep, maomao looks longer! 1.72 m.. Sighz. Oh yep, they were laughing at my chi again cos there was smoke  urlLink smoking  out from the  urlLink food  and i said you huo when i'm supposed to sae you yan. I didn't find it funny cos as long as they understood tt i was basically conveying the msg tt the  urlLink food  is hot but they laughed like they have nv laughed before. And these kind of similar situations have been their  urlLink entertainment  since sec 1. Lol, basically wadever retarded move i make, my dearest mao would laugh. =]  I am currently reading through all the necessary stuff about the mass media to write joshua's essay. Oh yep, he's lazy and hates gp so i am doing him a gd deed since it's fun, so dun be grateful. Thiam boon is tormenting me currently at 2:44 am in the morning! -__-  Anyway, am really surprised to have received the little note left by sky and emm thanks =) Hope u are doing fine in AJ.

      1:56 am rite now.. Had a persistent headache earlier on.. But to be optimistic, i'm glad it's mild.  Many incidents took place yesterdae, misunderstandings surfaced, turning trivial matters into sumthing major. Said some truthful yet hurting words to buddy. She said she liked the conversation but i felt and still feel terrible. Zhong yan ni er li yu xing, liang yao ku kou li yu bing. Hoped it helped..  Currently talking to darling guru Clare, josh, thiam boon and alywin on msn, listening to in love with u by jacky and regina. Watched the bachelor just now.. It is my fav show, yet i alwaes feel sad after watching it. Then again, the main question arises; is it worth to get ur heart shattered over such despicable obnoxious pestiferous creatures? The ans is undoubtedly apparently clear yet we fall into it and get an innocent heart bruised everywhere.  Meeting josh later to watch the house of the flying daggers. Hee yep, sad to sae, have to spend again but the show seems nice. Oh yep and i feel very fat now! Hey yep and good luck to diligent thiam boon for his test tmr as he is still mugging now at 2:48 am this fateful morning.

      It's 1:28am, enjoying the serene night again.. The apprehension ebbs away and comes back every now and then again as it pleases yet it's beyond my ability to control it. It is worse when the pple u dun even know are still vehemently insisting on u to meet them and bring u to wad doctor. Mental harrassment. -_-  Met buddy again. This time i'm really broke too after wad we have spent todae. Sighz. Talked to bro joshua, darling sze teng, thiam boon and buddy todae, actually it's like tt almost everydae. My life revolves about small conversations with some friends thru smses, on the phone and going out with the few pple closest to my heart now, and meeting some old friends.  Read through the ecosystem again, would probably finish the whole topic by this week and the tutorial qns next week. Rather lonely but glad tt i have my faithful books' company. Not to the extent of being in dire straits for glad to sae, i do have true friends with mi. This very special friend have been with mi since last yr, regardless of the time, he will alwaes be there when i'm down, i just wana sae thank u for no words would be pertinent enough to express this sentiment. Really very touched for he has been the bestest friend one can be and i thank god to have bestowed me such a gift, combined with a buddy who makes mi feel so attached to her.  Talked about my dreams with buddy. She wans to migrate to new zealand with her boy by the age of 40 and purchase a plot of land there. We talked about living in a cottage filled with bright coloured flowers, rearing sheeps, pigs and dogs. Our lives would be tranquil, living by the beach and gazing at the stars with our loved ones in the night. Then again, it's onli my utopian visions which can't turn true for i wun leave my family behind for they wouldn't wan to leave, and less to sae my responsibilities.

      Met up with buddy again todae. She is very depressed, antagonizing to see her like this. Rememebered her feeling angry yesterdae, glad to sae it's just for a moment but sad that these have to happen. Sighz, we went to get an MC after she calmed down.   Feeling kinda apprehensive, petrified, ugly, fat, shallow, stupid and lonely. Fallen in love with the instrumental songs too.. It's sad yet beautiful, captivating and collecting at the end of everything.

      It's exactly 2 am in the morning. Hopefully, it's a nice week to begin with..  Went for training just now.. Ram was down with flu so onli josh and i were down at the almost empty range. It was raining so i was drenched. Infuriated buddy todae cos i didn't go to donkey's house aka her boy's place for dinner when they have already gotten my share of the food and i didn't pick their 20 over missed calls. Sighz. I had my personal reasons.. Went with josh to meet his classmates, qisheng and wan zhen, to print their class jurseys. The colour looked kind of soothing, so i got myself one too after they told mi to. Broke again.  Just read through the new testimonial darling tingting wrote for mi. Perhaps it's becos of the combination of the instrumental sappy jap heats i'm listening to, i felt teary and warm. Miss u too.. sighz.. She calls mi almost everydae to tell mi she misses mi. In the midst of sadness, some friends make u feel loved and warms a frosted heart, by the things they do, they sae and by the emotions they feel, provided they are genuine.  I hope to go to Desaru with some frends.. Away from the urban area, away from everything. I hope to find peace. I hope to find silence within the secret emotion a heart is feeling. I hope that the dream i had was real but it isn't. I'm glad i had it though for it was the onli light i had then.  It's kinda scary at the moment as i can hear the fury wind blow and the chilly air around for it's pouring cats and dogs. Poor thiam boon is still mugging for his econs. Lol.
