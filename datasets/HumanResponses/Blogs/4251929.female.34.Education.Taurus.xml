        We just got back from Virginia.  I won't say where but the people who think that NJ is congested haven't gone here!  Not much to do.  The coolest thing was the Rainforest Cafe.  My little one was so freaked out by the "real-life" alligator.  My 7 y.o.  loved the hot tub at the hotel.  I'm just glad to be home.  Next time we come with my beloved on a buisness trip, it will have to be to Florida.

       I am on my way to  sunny  Virginia tomorrow. The boys and I are tagging along for a few days of sun and fun by the pool. Too bad that  my beloved  is going to be bored in training. I'm actually looking forward to going. I didn't think that I would be. The last time I mooched a vacation to this God-forsaken place, I was BORED STIFF in a hotel room for a whole day.  I'm looking forward to September a bit. I like having fun with the kids but I'd be very happy to "dig in" with someone's "difficult child.  I have been a real "political junkie" of late. Here in the great state of NJ, there are all sorts of political scandals. I voted for Mc Greevey but wasn't crazy with his "performance". I don't care if he's gay, straight or purple. I do feel bad for his family! At the press conference, they zoomed RIGHTIN on Jim's dad. He was crying. Leave the poor man alone! Where does this leave the very supportive wife? This is a rhetorical question..... I don't need to know but I suspect that we will all find out the skinny.  I don't want a Republican gov. I sure as heck don't want one of their presidents either! I can't wait until the annoying GOP convention is OVER!

      Some might wonder,  why the crazy title?  Quite simply, I have TWO boys, THREE if you count my husband. I am a special ed teacher too. 'Nuff said? I love them dearly but being the lone female in a house full of testosterone can be tough. My seven year old got a toy that the single object was to squeeze the "guts" out of it. It was that nasty gack stuff. I was desperately trying not to "gack" all over the floor! I take the kids to the pool and try to prevent my 2 year old from taking a flying leap off the side of the 2-foot deep pool. Now, maybe girls are better, maybe not. You can weigh in on this later. So inevitably, at the end of the day, I have a strong, mega-sized headache.  People, I donate my white blood cells, not only to save lives but because it guarantees me 2 hours of peace and quiet! Hello?!  Get it?!
