      I did have a little whiplash from an unexpected trip down memory lane recently. My parents uncovered a box of my elementary school reads, a box that I'd thought lost after their basement flooded several years ago, mixed in a soggy mess that got dumped. I opened the box to find paperbacks ordered from the Scholastic reader flyers that the teachers sent home and purchased from the Rose's in my hometown. My very first Nancy Drew book was a paperback  urlLink Nancy Drew Files , Case 5, Hit and Run Holiday, published 1986. I still remember scenes from these books! Nancy in a boat off the Florida coast, trying to rescue a girl with a broken arm. In Case 15,  Trial by Fire , I remember Nancy trapped in an underground garage, saving Ned. In a popular fiction course just this last year, I remember people lamenting the Nancy Drew Files as the worst incarnation of the strawberry blonde teen detective! Oh, but they were wonderful! They introduced me to young women as detectives, college students, white water rafting tour guides, athletes, fighters. By a weird twist of timing, I went from  urlLink Beverly Cleary  to these 1980s girl power Nancy Drew stories, before I read Sweet Valley Twins and Sweet Valley High. Nothing against the twins, but Nancy kicked ass.  Another very influential book,  Chilling Ghost Stories  by  urlLink Bernhardt J. Hurwood , was acquired at a  urlLink Reading is Fundamental  third grade book giveaway. Students could each choose a certain number of books from a table. I read and reread these ghost stories. I still remember the atmosphere, some of the scenes, the red-eyed black stallions pulling the old-fashioned hearse on the cover. Whenever I hear " urlLink Hotel California " I revisit the feeling of this book, peeling wallpaper, greenish shadows, ghostly hotel guests. So there's no real texutal connection, but I feel it and see it and even smell mustiness when I hear that song.  Here's  urlLink  The Dancing Cats of Applesap  by Janet Taylor Lisle  (illustrated by Joelle Shefts, except my cover doesn't look like the one I find online now), a book that I'd forgotten until I pulled it out of the box. As soon as I glimpsed the cover, I remembered. The cover, and the small illustrations within, are very detailed and I spent much time inspecting the scenes.  I want to reread these books! But I've got so many new ones just lurking, waiting for me!

      I find that a great part of the information I have was acquired by looking something up and finding something else on the way. -- urlLink Franklin P. Adams , American journalist  Just when you thought there were enough book reviewers in the world. Well, if it makes you feel any better, my book reviews will be more like travelogues, rather than name-dropping insipid put-downs or uneventul  urlLink amazon.com  reviews (of dubious integrity). I'd rather talk about the connections I made while reading the book, my experiences during the reading. I encouarge feed-back and reports of other peoples' reading experiences and the connections they made while reading. Connections between a reader's life and the text, between the text and another story, between the characters and your neighbors. Whatever connection reaches out and snags a bit of something else to make a web of consciousness that binds us all in our living and reading and interacting. Reading is about peeping into another person's thoughts, the landscapes that their mind travels through. So a travelogue isn't too far off base, huh?  I'm not reading anything right now. I'm in a dry period that hurts my heart, seeing books everyday, but not finding the one that wants to stay with me for the long haul.

       urlLink Utne  magazine (July/August 04) has short piece called " urlLink Blogging Off " by Whitney Pastorek (p. 90). A subtitle adds, "Your blog's great, but can it buy me a beer?" Pastorek is a non-blogger (like me, two days ago) who has discovered her social life suffering from everyone else's use of blogging for their social outlet. She raises good arguments against blogging, but also questions about the purpose of blogging, although she doesn't flesh the questions out. So, perhaps its time to explain my blog intentions further.  I do not intend for this blog to be a social outlet in the purest sense. If I make personal connections based upon shared interests, fine. I still have close friends that I will not expect to read this blog. If they do, fine. If not, fine. Flesh and blood friends are best for sharing wine and  urlLink Scrabble .  In addition to doing this blog for my own entertainment, it would be grand to create a space for readers' reactions to diverse reading experiences. This is where personal book reviews come into my master blog plan. More about reviews later!  I do intend to share book-related experiences, my interests in various subjects and the related resources I've found. I am interested in almost everything I come into contact with, but I choose to delve deeper into some subjects and, for a short time, am a woman obsessed. In these times, I think having this blog will help me organize my thoughts and build a larger inventory of those thoughts and interests. The brain can only be expected to achieve so much!  My only complaint is that the blog structure is so linear, which isn't the way I think. I anticipate lots of links between new and archived posts.

      Is anyone else freaked out the first time they try this? Using blogger.com puts you right out there, much quicker than I expected. So I work on my profile, save my changes and view it, and right away there are hyperlinks between my blog and tons of other blogs mentioning whatever term is linked! Oh the power.  Now, I'm no techno virgin. I designed and maintain our library web page using Stormdance Antenna web design software, WS_FTP; I edited XML code while converting the print American National Biography to the online edition; I can hand code HTML when needed...true, I have a painful relationship with cell phones. But I am impressed and a little tickled by this blogger.com service. I had planned on developing a web page on my own, updating it by opening the web design program when needed. But this is easy, quick, and I'm sounding like blogger.com has paid me for this virtual airtime. Not a bad idea! Well, thank you blogger.com for making the virtual world a little more close-knit.

      I have thought about what I want this blog to be about, some topic, besides just  me , to give it coherence and trajectory.  But, I have so many interests and curiosities that deciding on a single topic is impossible.  Here is a taste of what will make its way into this blog:  book reviews, knitting projects, library stuff, pets, traveling, my sneaky strategies for losing weight, movies, oh, and who knows what may become a hot topic in my mind.  Its a big library in there, my mind that is.  So many subjects, so many resources, so little time to dig your hands into everything!  So, this blog will be about exploring it all!  This blog itself is a venture into another interest.  I've designed web sites, but never tried blogging.  I've written diaries and kept journals, but not online.  Its all the rage, so I'm going to throw some thoughts out there and see what happens.   Happy blogging!
