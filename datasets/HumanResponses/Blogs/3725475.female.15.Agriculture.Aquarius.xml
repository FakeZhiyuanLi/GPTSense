      I'm back from Pizza Hut. I'm always back from Pizza Hut. For the past few weeks when I blog it's always been "I'm back from Pizza Hut".   So yes, I'm back from Pizza Hut. It was tiring. I got there and my manager decided to tell me it was just going to be me and him for the whole night. A saturday night. I screamed and he called in a few others.   Khoo and Mrs Khoo came to visit me. It's amazing how different mother and daughter are. I was out the back when they came into the store and Mrs Khoo leaned over the counter and waved like mad. She's so cute (in the crazy way), while Khoo's all cute in the quiet, reserved way. That's probably going to be me with my daughter. No my kids will probably all be crazy too. Where am I heading now? Thinking too far. Back to reality. I'm 15.  I'm smelling way too much cheese and oil for my own good. Today I sent in my application to Myers. [It was a serious one Lay, not the "just for fun" one I did.] I feel bad though.   Next time remind me when I like a guy make sure his name is something a little less common like...zoblof. Then I won't get all intsy when a group of girls come into my store screaming "darren!" or when my manager sits there with his phone speaking to a "danny". I'm an idiot. [It's a figure of speech Lay, don't take it for real - of course I'm not really an idiot.]  I finished my commerce stuff today, moving on to Geography.

      It's 11 O'clock and I am currently covered in paint. No not that professional paint stuff from painting a house, it's kid's paint. I sometimes think I'm really too nice a sister. "Nancy, I'm going to bed so can you paint my peep-o-scope for me?" "Sure thing"..  Freddie has come visiting again and my stomache is not feeling too feel. In fact, it's a little rumbly grumbly. My big dilemma of the day..WORK EXPERIENCE. No Lay I don't really want to go to a childcare centre. Thanks for your offer, please don't cry.  Miss Busatto is asking some multimedia place for me today. Work experience needs to be finalised tomorrow, so I'm a tad screwed.  I made something for drama night, because I felt bad. My name's down for publicity but I haven't done anything.  It's the whole Ming Mong theme.   urlLink Poster.

      Dearest Nancy, my friend in Lametown,  I understand that living in Lametown has certainly gone to your head but I will not hold that against you. You seem under a trance when you say that you went to Lametown to find Steph when you actually went to find your true, inner self. Lametown is your home. Be happy in your home.   Love from your understanding friend, Lay.  R . E . A . L . I . T . Y SRP wasn't so bad . Quite good for me and science actually. When we co-operate, we can blast past the stars. =) I dont like ur plans either. They sound a bit , mmm.. hoe should i put it? oh yeah. LAME . haha. sorry. couldnt help it.   I have absolutely crabsolutely no idea as well. I agree with nancee on this one, something FUN that i like (like me or chocolate) and not boooorrrriiinnnngggg and un-fun (like pants or brussel sprouts). But i would just like to be quite well-off. And i would be happy. =)  -lay-

      Dear Lay,  I glad to hear your concern about my stay at Lametown. Sad to say, I wasn't there for too long. I was there to visit my lame friend Steph but she wasn't there. A little disappointing but oh well, must try again another day. Thanks again for your concern. You too must be disappointed upon hearing such news. That Steph of a girl must have tried to sneak into Cooltown again (where I live). It's her 678th attempt. How can I let her know she will never fit in?  With regards,  Nancy   --> Back to my life   Today I walked home from Epping Station. I am proud. I am amazing. I am tired.   After long hours of pondering I've finally decided I'm failing this year. Failing badly. 48/60 for SRP. I've also decided that the best and only solution so far is to take a deep breath and sing "It's a hard knock life". Janice didn't like me plan.    When I "grow" up..  I don't know what I want to do. No doctor or some kind of "logist" for me. I want to do something fun; something I like, but I don't know what.  Lay isn't letting me type. I'll just post this now.

       I decided to take some time to  appreciate the world . It all began last night when I was&nbsp;making Pizzas at&nbsp;Pizza Hut. While I was doing so I was&nbsp;also in California and chillin' in the holiday inn. The music was&nbsp;on full blast. As I was walking home&nbsp;after I thought: &nbsp;    I love the  street lamps  for keeping the  streets bright .    I love  my jumper  for keeping me  warm .    I love  my manager  for giving me a free oversized but  warm pizza hut jumper .    I love  walking in the streets at night  and appreciating what I've got. [Not really. I only started appreciating things because I was feeling scared.]     &nbsp;   I'm here to continue appreciating the world...and to continue  procrastinating .     &nbsp;   I love having  all my little pumpkins  in the pumpkin patch  always being there for me .    I love   NSGHS   for allowing me to befriends with someone  as lame as Lay  and the rest of the pumpkin patch.    I love  RobertSmith  for making the library green and purple. I have fallen in love with it.     &nbsp;    [I'm going to cry now.]      &nbsp;   I love  the musical  for letting me  meet new people .    I love&nbsp; my little pumpkins  (namely Seepeeka, Sheetal and Sruti)&nbsp;for wanting to  try out for the musical .     I love  my commerce assignment  which I am about to start anytime now.    I love  my english assignment  that I must start after that.    I love  this world . I love  school . I love  my home . I love  my family . I love  my friends . I love  my work  and my  work friends . I love  my phone . I love  my icecream . I love  music . I love   Blogspot  . I love you  world .     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       i also have decided what im going to do next year.     &nbsp;  3 english   3 maths   2 legal   2 eco   2 physics    &nbsp;  but probably will change after subject selection night. maybe. hopefully not.     &nbsp;  sorry about the real short blog. but i'll blog again later.     &nbsp;

       Today I'm feeling Pink.  Not blue.  Pink.    I have decided what I want to pick for  next year .     &nbsp;   3u English.    3u Maths    2u Chem    2u DT    2u Society & Culture     &nbsp;   Though they all tell me DT and I  just won't click  because DT is capped. The highest mark you can get is 90.2, but I've decided I'm not going to listen. Oooh I know. A  rebellious  move here.     &nbsp;   After  much thought  I've decided my definition for  Media Hype  for the commerce assignment is going to be : The media hyping things up.     &nbsp;   Once I get the funny photos on my phone on to my computer I'm going to create a new layout for our blog.     &nbsp;   I've once again procrastinated and made a poster for some girl I don't know. She just emailed me and said she needed a poster for  Winglin Fanfiction &nbsp;. So I made her something.     &nbsp;    [Our Story]          I must stop procrastinating now. It is most lame to be procrastinating in the form of blogging online about how you're procrastinating.

       lay takes on persona of nancy's&nbsp;shrink for this blog    &nbsp;  i  see   that   you   have   found   colour!     and...  l o v e    &nbsp;  pant, we all know that you want and are going to take him because you ... l o v e him as you blurted out so truthfully this lunchtime     we all also know that you should stop shoving the blame of that wonderfully disgusting smell onto me because we ALL know who it actually comes from      &nbsp;  we also all know that you l o v e studying. it makes u feel loved and happy. don't go around trashing the only thing that can deal with the smell    &nbsp;  also about the formal, no need to worry about formal dress because lay is here! shopping with lay is the most enjoyable way to spend a saturday afternoon     &nbsp;

          After many years of waiting I have finally managed to book a   "heart to heart"   session with my heart. No worries dearies it's not meant to make sense.      &nbsp;    My heart tells me:        &nbsp;    I'm worried. As usual. Just about random things. Assignments. Exams. Curing Lay's lameness. The formal. Random things that enter my mind for 2 seconds and only intended to stay for that long but manage to slip into the "I will stay here and worry Nancy" section.     &nbsp;     1. Assignments.   I'm such a    procrastinator    it's killing me. I want to change that. Really I try. I tell myself ok 10 more minutes and you do some maths homework. 15 minutes later I'm telling myself ok just another 10 minutes and on it goes. I can't help it.      &nbsp;    2. Exams.   Same goes with the    procrastinating   .   I can't   always   cram.       &nbsp;     3. Curing Lay's lameness.   That one is really starting to worry me - especially today in computing. My funniness usually balances her out a bit when I'm next&nbsp;to her but now she's gone too far. Paying me buckets and pots for rent for the reject shop.        &nbsp;    4. The formal.   I don't know. What will I wear? How much will I need to spend?&nbsp;Will I take a date? Would he still want to go by then? Will I feel comfortable? Would I still like him by then? Would my parents let me? Would I be able to afford it?    Will Lay smell too bad?       &nbsp;      Session over. I conclude:     I'm a paranoia.

      i'm back! hey pance. and i see we have acquired some fans. =O  before i tell my holiday story. u got yet another job intervieW? got too much time on ur hands. didnt the dodo ads, midday movies AND instant noodles keep u busy? i wanted an update on what ads were on/what midday movies were on/what flavour noodles u liked the best.  good work with the work experience . it sounds like heaps of fun . even if ur not with me . dont cry.  &nbsp; ok. to my holiday. it was hot, happy and HOT.  today in sydney was like 10 degrees after coming from 3 weeks of like 30 degree temperatures.  &nbsp; -s e e n &nbsp;t h e&nbsp; s i t e s- &nbsp;&nbsp;  Taiwan  went to taiwan for about a week. we did heaps and heaps and HEAPS of shopping (everything is like. disgustin gly cheap there) we saw all of our relatives and we did a hell of alot of eating . =) &nbsp;  America  went to america for almost 2 weeks. it was heaps of fun but everything was heaps expensive so we didnt buy so much. we went to LA for 4 days then we went on a tour to Las Vegas and the &nbsp;Grand Canyon. Vegas was really fun&nbsp;but it was&nbsp;like 40 degrees so we didnt get to&nbsp;do that much&nbsp; - Grand Canyon was really nice and .&nbsp;big..? it was huuuuge . then after our tour we&nbsp;went back to LA for a couple of days before going to Disneyland. Disneyland was heaps of fun even though its more for kids,&nbsp;there were a couple&nbsp;of rides that we went on around 10 times. The next day we went to Disneylands California Adventure which is more for older ages, and there was this crazee mad ride called California Screamin' that we&nbsp;went&nbsp;on for the whole day but by the end, it got a bit boring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day we went to Universal Studios. There were lots of rides and shows and these were all directed for older people so&nbsp;i&nbsp;had more fun at&nbsp;universal studios&nbsp;than disneyland.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Notes  All American food is humungous, greasy and expensive. Their pizzas are about triple the size of our pizzas (imagine making those!) their mcdonalds hasnt introduced a "small" meal and their prices were almost double the prices here..!  &nbsp; American money is the most annoyingest thing ever. especially one centses. Another annoying thing is their tax which doesnt get included so u have to stand at the counter fiddling with all the tiny coins and the damn one centses.  &nbsp; They have the maddest cars! And their number plates are funner than ours.  &nbsp; streetball = coolest thing ever &nbsp; PLane food = disgustingest thing ever but planes have good movies. the only thing that kept me going were the movies. and u pance.  &nbsp; oh btw loved ur letter . i cried everytime i saw a fan and everytime i went to the bathroom. alone. and i was howling when there was a fan IN the bathroom. so sad.  &nbsp; -lay-

      While Lay's in America enjoying herself now I'm here, back home in Australia, chilling out. Well, not exactly.  Let me recount everything that has happened so far this week - things, eg my job interview that everyone has heard about already. Nevertheless, no one minds hearing things a second time. Refreshes their knowledge about my life.   Monday   Home all day, waiting for my camera phone. Oh yes did I mention the phone guy still hasn't delivered my phone and it's Thursday. Daddy says he's definetely comng tomorrow. I'm assuming it's a he. I'm a sexist and I believe women can never be that slow, besides you Steph. So as I wait, I'm also sitting at my computer talking to random people on MSN. Did I mention I signed on at 9:30am? So I talk to Megan for a while, and this person who added me but don't know who I am. Then I talk to Darren, and we have this major discussion about which guys are hot. It's made me realise he's really a strange one. A gay perverted one. "in this one coke ad, theres this guy who looks half asian and he's in his underwear - that guy is probably the best looking guy i've ever seen". But he's so amazingly cute. I think I'm liking him more and more, which is really sad and depressing. I haven't seen him for 2 years now. This is going to turn into one of those tragic stories of unreturned love. I'll be 62 and still sitting in front of my computer waiting for Darren to pop on MSN. I'm such a loser. Snap out of it Nancy.   Tuesday  Coles Myer group interview at Parramatta. One second Daddy tells me he can drive me there, the next he's got some other urgent thing to attend. Being the good, considerate, charming daughter I am, I tell him "it's ok, I can catch a bus". So my interview's at 10:30 and I'm out of the house at appoximately 9:22. I get to Eastwood station [by foot oh yeh.] at 9:45ish, catch a Parramatta bus and get to Parramatta Station at 10:29am. Good work? I think Woohoo! I'm here! What I don't know is Macquarie Street is one hell of a long street that goes on for millions of kilometres. One step the wrong way and you're left walking an extra hour. Well, that's what happened to me. I'm wondering up and down Macquarie street for 10 years because a man decides to point me the wrong way. I don't blame him though, I'm thinking he actually told me the right way; I just interpreted it wrong. [Well, only a man who can interpret could go far. Could become a star. Could be famous. Could be a big success.]  So it's 11:15 and I'm standing at the door of Lachlan Tower. Missed my session, need to attend next one at 12. Sounds good. Only a 45 minute wait. I walk to some club place hoping to use their phone (for 40c) to call my sister (just to tell her to eat lunch on the table cos I'll be home late - cos I'm such a damn caring sister) and the lady says no. Ooh a bit harsh but I take it. I end up using my mobile (still the old one) which I don't like to use cos I'm a cheapo. I talk for 5 minutes on the phone to my sister (me talking, her saying yes or ok every 2 and a half minutes), and I hear this voice going "excuse me, excuse me.." I look around me and see there's no one so I go back to talking. After I hang up, I move away and the door that was behind me opens. A lady steps out and I'm left standing there embarrassed. "Oh it was you, I was wondering where that voice was coming from". She smiles but doesn't really take the joke. Then I called Khoo. Cos she was the first one I scroll down to on my list. Now I regret making that many calls. 2. Yes, many.  Late to an interview was already not a good sign. I arrive back at Lachlan Tower at 11:20ish and everyone waiting is standing in "formal attire". I stand in a brownish sports shirt and white pants. Luckily I make some friends fast and being an expert at "making people feel sorry for me", I end up with the jacket of one lady and the comb from another. (I didn't ask for it, they offered things to me.) We go to the bathroom and I get all made up, ready for anything.   Group interview - there were about 10 thousand people attending the session. In a huge room there were around 10 tables and 10 at each table. One observer sits at every table, observing how we you communicate and contribute to the group activities.   1st activity - "A lady and her child comes into your hotel at 9:30pm tired, she has documenttaion proving that she has booked a room but your database cannot find it. All the rooms of her booked type are full. What do you do?" I'm the first to give all my weird solutions. eg. Send her to a nearby hotel - pay for her of course, only the best room will do. Offer her your room, after all as the manager you can afford to sleep somewhere else. In addition to that offer her all sorts of discounts and specials for her next visit - cos she's sure to visit again. It was fun. I was kind of Miss In Charge. Some things I said were just plain  lame  funny, but the lady did say "just be yourself".   2nd activity - "just to get together and discuss all the things you would do as a sales assistant from the second a customer walks into your store to the second he/she leaves" Everyone had the whole "greeting them asking them what they want" thing going so I didn't want to repeat it. So I suggested "Well, if they're after something for a holiday and they come in for a fishing rod you can show them all the other fishing equipment too ...oh and a boat...I went a bit off there. Really, just a bit.  It was fun overall.  Yesterday I got an email.  Dear Nancy   Thank you for your participation in our recent group interview. We would like to advise you that you have advanced further in the recruitment process for a position with Coles Myer Ltd.    Wednesday  Yesterday I got lost at Central when I went to see a guy named Grant Parr. Grant Parr. Like Grant Parr. Get it? He was a funny man and Woohoo! I have work experience!   Have to go to Violin lesson now. Will continue later.

       That's obviously what the Australian Olympic Team decided when they showed up at the  Opening Ceremony .       My week has been   extraordinarily ordinary  . Yesterday, after 2 consecutive potato scallops in a week, I resisted at Strathfield Station and bought sultanas instead. The halo stayed above my head for a while, but then I realised I had earlier eaten a bag of Crunchie Chocettes and 1/4 of a Cadbry Caramello block.  The halo bid me a sad farewell .    Due to my reluctance to buy a potato scallop and eat it alone the other day, Cassandra called me    a follower .    Anyone who knows me [well enough] will know that other than my absolute hate for those who feel more superior than others I cannot stand others accusing me of something I'd never be,  something I'd hate to ever be .    Cass: you're such a follower   Me: me?   Srut: Nancy's not a follower [something along those lines cos Sruti loves me and I love Sruti]   Me: because I don't want to eat a potato scallop by myself?    Cass: no not just that. other things too.      That blew me off for the rest of the day. All afternoon and night I was easily steamed up. I guess I'm a follower because I like to embarrass myself and do all things no one else will do. I'm a follower because I run to hug Del Galo when everyone else stays behind and laughs. I'm a follower because I prefer my belongings different to others.   I prefer to not follow "the trend".      On the other hand. I originally believed that "followers" were those who come to school everyday with eyeliner and mascara because others do it. I thought followers were those who tried to sit with other groups and pretend to fit in.   Those who tried to be someone else.   Someone they're not. Those who thought -       I will stop. I'm not in the mood to go on. I don't want to be in that mood. I'd like to stay my happy self fo today. and tomorrow.  Shopping with Lay and then Megan party . Work Experience next week - I'm actually kind of excited in a way.   ExoDay   - Tuesday - must get breakfast for a silver coin.      I'm still obsessed. I'm a idiot. A sad idiot who leads a depressing life. I have to admit I'm obsessed though. I can't help being so obsessed. I'm just sad.

      larry is always always  always   funnier than hillary.  we  all  know that panty wants to take darren and darren wants to take her. as new revelations have come to surface ....  here's a little story for u.  as soon as she got home from school she rushed upstairs. when in the safety of her bedroom, she quickly got changed, pulled on her pantyhose (sound familiar?) and connected her laptop. she had an urge to talk to her friends and to check on a special someone. she quickly logged on and started to chat with her friends, after about 5 minutes, the special someone came online. she was nervous at first to start a conversation but she knew that she  had   to talk to him.  P: hey D: hey. how are you? i haven't seen you for a while! P: yeah. its sad. D: so tragic. P: anyway, you got any plans next saturday? D: is this an invo or a hypothetical? P: invo... D: sure! i would love to go out with you. u know i really actually love you and want to take u to the formal to show my affection for u.  haha. im LARRY.

        Today Darren came to visit me at Pizza Hut again. The Pizza Darren, not Darren Darren. Yes, the guy that makes me ask "are you sure?" when he gives me his name. He's pretty hot, in a way - though not the Darren Darren hot. Darren Darren is not so the looks hot, Darren Darren is more personality-wise hot. Pizza Darren is the hot looks but not so the attitude, walk, talk hot.    Steph is the mentalisticest person I know.
