       Emotions filled mi up&nbsp;as I went home jux now.. I've told him everything I should n I could see tears welling him up.. I could see his regrets through his eyes.. But, wad can I do? Things have alreadi happened liaox arx.. Guess he can onli blame himself bahx.. I never wan things to happened lik this too arx.. But, it's really far too much fer mi to take le lahx.. I've to face him n other teachers.. On e other hand, dere's oso other frnx fer mi to take care of in a sense de arx.. Get mi? Wad can I do?    He can onli blame MsYeo fer doing tht to us mahx.. N tht causes all of us to be unhappie wid lorx.. MrSeow arx.. I reali agree wid u tht NP wld drop if we're gone..&nbsp;But, no&nbsp;pt regretting nw rite? Wad sldn't b said are orleadi said liaox arx.. Muhds dey all, Diana N CC can't come fer NP anymore too le.. N wad can u do? First time ever, saw ur eyes so teary.. Kinda frightening.. It's not tht we dun wanna help.. But, wid e presence of MsYeo, makes us feel far too uncomfortable le.. Guess, we&nbsp;can onli&nbsp;complete our contribution to NP in our sec sch life onli whn O lvl is 1 mth or so away bahx.. Sigh.. Wad to do nehx? Nvrm lahx.. Live life as it is.. Rite, pals?

I reali feel so sad.. Fine.. I'm not gonna beg u guys to go down.. C'on.. Who r u guyx? I reali feel so sad.. Mayb lik wad u sae is rite? I sae dun go down de.. N yet now is oso mi who sae wanna go down.. Call mi indecisive.. Call mi siaox.. Sae tht i go back on my words.. I dun mind.. Cuz u guyx weren't dere to hear wad he'd sae mahx.. Mayb I'm jux soft-hearted in a sense.. It's not a must tht we mux go down.. But, it's tht kinda guilt tht actuali fill mi up lorx.. So much so tht i dun noe wad can i do to ease it.. Guess onli esper is standing wid mi now.. Thx Esper.. *Muackx* At least wid u ard.. I feel better.. Sigh.. Guess onli gers understand gers more.. I can't deny tht I'm at fault.. But, afterall..

Nobody can hear mi cry.. Nor hear my speakers blast.. Kinda hungry.. Cuz todae din have recess n onli ate le pasta at abt 1+..&nbsp;&nbsp;Till now.. But, no appetite to have anything too.. Mayb I'm far too selfish to jux think in my point of view.. But, wad else can I sae? M i wrong to think in my way? M i wrong to do wad I wanna do?  I noe.. By pouring everything here wun solve things.. But&nbsp;I jux hope tht tml wld b a better dae.. Guess it's not too much bahx.. Feel so sad.. Hope aft tonitex slp..

           First dae of e week.. *Shurkx* Life is still as worse.. When back to class.. Emaths was first period.. Gt back our test paper.. Mmm.. Din do veri badly.. But, I din expect to do this well too. Gt 23/25~ Okie lahx.. Not so bad lorx..&nbsp;Cuz I din reali studie mahx =X I was fousing on Amaths on Thurs nitex while watching MGII.. Lolx.. Den everything was as usual lorx.. N whn it was Chemistry lessons, Mrs Soh spent a good 30 mins jux to teach us on Qns 1(a) N tht was e filling n recording of reading obtained thru titration lorx.. Crap sia.. Last 5 Mins she returned us our CT paper which was lik 2 weeks ago de lorx.. Diaox rite? Lolx.. As usual, I failed.. Haha.. Kinda sad lahx.. Cuz I did studied fer it N i mean reali studied lorx.. Wonder y too.. *Sigh* Gt 16/35 =X Nvrm lahx.. Guess I'm not fated to b a Chem student nehx.. Physics was next~ Nth much too.. Went up e lab.. Have to sit beside him.. Sigh.. I jux dun feel lik seeing him lorx.. Let alone talk to him.. He called mi, apologise for sat issue.. Yet, I ignored him completely.. Instead, I stood fer e whole hr except fer e last 5 Mins.. =X&nbsp;Guess I'll need more time b4 I can overcome wad has happened.. It's not easy to heal some wounds de..  Recess was cool.. Cuz I'm hungry~ Din have dinner lax nitex. N&nbsp;I guess tht explains y I'm straved~ Diana came looking fer mi.. Saying abt e Emaths results.. She was so high tht she passed.. 14/25 She was so on clouds sia.. N kept toking abt CC failing~ 'Top' e class.. Asked how I fared, I told her n guess she gt a shock bahx.. Cuz she din sae much le.. Lolx.. If I noe tht cld stuff her mouth, n shut her up, I wld have sae tht earlier than having her bla-bla-bla-ing non-stop.. But, she din completely go mute.. She went on saying tht I topped e lvl~ Bla Bla Bla.. C'mon lahx.. 23? Top lvl? So lousy sia.. Better go hide moi face..  After recess, got back Amaths paper.. Lolx.. Thok I wld fail into mani pieces.. But, things weren't as bad.. Lolx.. Mi gt 9/25.. Mayb u think it's bad.. Rather, I heaved a sigh of relief.. Cuz I din gt 2 or 3 mahx.. So, I'm kinda happie wid moi results fer Amaths&nbsp;more than Emaths.. Lolx.. But, moi hard work hasn't reali pay off too.. Nvrm lahx.. Add more oil bahx..  Guess tht's abt todae bahx.. Gonna go studie liaox.. Having Hist test tml nehx.. Dun wanna fail.. Haha.. N pray hard tht I wun bahx.. Hao lahx.. Take care guyx.. Oh yahx.. BingHuan, if u happen to c this, no nid to explain le~ I wanna hear no more.. I've gt eyes to c, rite? Afterall, moi eyes r moi.. N I trust dem.. Wad else do I sae? Disappointment reali filled moi heart.. Dun u agree? Put urself in moi shoes den.. Who else can I trust?&nbsp;

      Feeling so slpy now.. Sld i go & take a nappie? *Ywanx* Let mi blog finish first bahx.. Nth much in sch todae.. Mayb onli fer e fact tht MrTan wasn't in sch n tht we din have our usual 4Hrs, 8Periods of Maths on Tues lorx.. Mmmm.. Everyone in class seems to b going against awt.. First was some guys here n dere.. Den was Esper.. Now is Kenny.. Cuz sth happened during emaths jux now lorx.. No nid to ask wad bahx.. Cuz I guess this is either u noe or u dun.. Afterall, it's a M2 stuff..  Had English Oral jux now.. N it's fer Prelims man.. Not much of a feel.. It simply come n go jux lik a breeze~ No traces left.. N to think tht this mornie I woke up wid qt a bad throat.. Ended up had to buy Strepsilx frm Shell.. Haha.. Frm this mornie till now, I ate less than 6.. N now 3 quarter is gone liaox.. All distributed out.. Lolx.. It's okie lahx.. Wid moi strepsilx, chocolate, pokka green tea & plain water frm e Billabong bottle.. Throat seems better le.. Hope it wun come back tml mornie again.. It's is reali so, den I'm not gonna care abt it liaox.. Haha.. Jux let moi throat rot bahx..  Nice dae without any sci sub~ *WhOoOx* Jux lurves it~ =) Feeling not veri good after oral jux now.. I wonder y.. Guess Mood Swing bahx.. Mayb oso cuz of MsWoo lorx.. Dunno how she exmaine ppl de sia.. So crap~ Jux dun lik e way she examine.. Nvrm.. Who cares? HaHa.. Hao bahx..

          *Mondae blues* Lolx.. Posted loadsa pics last nitex.. Jux lik those scenes of Jin Chuan & Bing Huan.. Snapped dem frm outside e Art Room.. Nice~ Loads more under moi photo album de link nehx.. Mmm.. School todae was rather bored.. Learnt nth basically.. So sad..   Went cwp after sch.. Ate le den pei&nbsp;siling went buy foolscape nehx.. Lolx.. Mi&nbsp;& Sam shared a baked rice n a Ham &amp; Mushroom de Pizza~ *Yum Yum* Chatted qt alot over lunch~ abt life in MSL.. Time reali seems to have fly real fast nehx.. How thirteen gt together.. N how e 5 of us have changed over e yrs.. His & Her de relationship.. Wad's so diff btw/n now n present&nbsp;etc.. This reali makes mi think back how fragile life reali can&nbsp;be..  Rem whn I was onli P3, I've gt a frnd.. Rather a ex- classmate who met wid an accident at e interchange.. N he died on e spot.. Although I din witness it or wad, but this left deeply in moi mind~ N to think tht he died b4 his hari raya.. Tht's jux too bad..  Often, we tend to take things fer granted.. Not cherishing who & what we have with we.. We onli regret when it's reali too late.. What's e pt of bearing grudges wid each other? Mayb a simple sorrie can simply save a friendship from breaking? No one is perfect.. We have to accept wad's in our frnd~ By giving in to dem.. U're actuali undersstanding dem more.. Wad u feel mite not b wad dey feel.. So, y not clarify things b4 u make any conclusion? A broken glass wil nv b prefect again no matter how hard u try to fix dem back nicely..&nbsp;Cracks wil alwax b dere..

      Thurs nitex, having 2 tests tml yet I'm stil here updating moi blog.. Ain't suppose to update de.. But.. u noe.. Dere's alwax a BUT in life lahx.. Okie.. Lik wad mani had said, todae topic will definately be on O LVL MT RESULTS nehx.. Well, not gonna reveal wad I've gt YET.. Tell u wad happened todae first bahx..   Earli in e mornie gt called out by Elanie to get e OARS cheque.. N moi first thinking is tht 'My hair is messy!!' Lolx.. So not presentable nehx.. Haha.. Den, saw Lindi and she din reali look good.. Hence, I went over to show moi concern.. ( Hello! I'm concern abt ppl de, u noe.. Stop qns-ing mi nehx.. ) Den, found out tht she gt some itchy rashes appearing lorx.. So, told MsChow abt it & accompained her all e way while e Upper Sec ppl were running.. Sobbiex.. I wanted to run nehx.. Nvrm.. Take it as I zhuan bahx..  Den, gone back to class fer lessons lorx.. Nth much either nehx.. After English was Physics.. Sigh.. Used to lik physics, but no more.. Wonder wad gt into MrKoo nowadays man.. So weird.. N he din seems to feel fer our MT results, noe? It's lik he dun seems interested at all sia.. Let alone tht, bell rang at 10 & still refuse to let us go whn he noe clearly tht MrLim is outside n his lessons has ended.. Gosh.. Tht's so barbarian lik man.. I'm not being baised.. I'm merely stating a fact nehx.. Isn't it so.. Cuz I'm not e onli one who sae this arx.. DiaOx.. Hao.. NEXT~!!   Results was announced.. 100% passes!! WhOox~!! !*Sup man*! 43% dist.. Almost half but not yet.. Sigh.. Cuz tht was wad MrLim wanted MORE than half a class dist.. We disappointed him nehx.. Can't disclose ppl grades here, so generally tell u how they fare lorx.. Those who r suppose to get A, gt their A.. Those suppose to fail, manage to clinch a B/C.. Lolx.. N guess wad I got? Dun tell u lehx.. =P Dun ask.. Not gonna tell u.. Haha.. getting a lil lame.. But, no way M i gonna tell.. Lolx.. Anywai, seen onli tears of sadness fer our lvl lorx.. Sigh.. Qt a couple of ppl cry over e results.. Well, did I? I was expecting myself to.. But, still I din.. Dun b disappointed.. Guess mani were expecting mi to cry ehx.. Lolx.. Well, mayb u can sae tht I'm jux being greedy fer wanting higher grades.. Who dun, ryte? Everybody wants e best fer themselves.. E highest grade obtainable mahx.. N i guess I'm one of them whn it comes to results.. B3 to someone who failed consistantly in Sec3 thru out & earli Sec4 is indeed a sense of achievement.. Guess I expected this grade but, jux dun wanna resign, u see.. Plus as a matter of fact tht I gt Dist fer moi Oral.. N tht's sth good, I guess? So, main prob now is to retake or not..? =X  I can sae tht I'm not confident enough to get a Dist.. I have to admit tht MT paper is easy to score but, It's onli a matter of HOW WELL? Sitting e same paper as those higher MT candidates simply drop moi confident.. Plus, izzit worth it to spend so much time & effort on a sub tht mite not have any improvement? Sigh.. So mani qns.. All ard a circle n back to e same point.. Will lady luck b wid mi den? Wun things b better if I jux concentrate on e other 6? Or do I have a higher adventage to score a dist wid my oral dist? Sigh sigh sigh.. Anywai, u din noe I gt B3 ryte? Shhh.. Nobody noes.. Dun tell anyone lahx..   N u noe wad? Todae oral is on Campcraft, camping & leadership etc man.. WhOox.. Certainly seems to b 100% nicely fit fer mi, ryte? Lolx.. Jk lahx.. But, I have to sae tht if I gt this topic, I wld b laughing till all my teeth drop man.. It seems so easy.. Esp to Wt, kaiyuan, Esper & Shufang man.. Make mi so jealous.. Nvrm.. Luck counts.. Who ask moi dad surname not A-H de? Lolx.. Jk lahx.. Gimme free de, I oso dun wan lahx.. Lolx..  MrsAnshad is finally back! Simply feel so warm-hearted to c her back again n this time as our Co- form.. WhOox.. Lolx.. Hope I will work harder n score well bahx.. Guess it's been 200 yrs ever since I last pass my Chem paper, despite of studying so hard? Mayb I'm not a Chem student at all bahx.. No worries.. I wun give up de.. ( I hope so! ) Lolx..   Sat having e SPF badge rehearsal.. Have I said it b4 anywhr? Nvrm.. Jux reminding myself bahx.. Wonder if e BBQ is still on mahx.. Gonna comfirm again tml.. Hope not lyk e previous Sat man.. So diaOx.. Feel lyk catching more movies.. Craving~! Haha.. Tml's e last dae of e week le.. Finally.. Hope everything wld b fyne.. Esp to those taking Oral de bahx.. N a BIG BIG congrats to those who fared well in their Mt paper n those who din perform up to expections, dun worrie.. Dere's a second chance fer this arx.. Wadever izzit, ppl live in e furture.. Get things over n done wid.. Be brave to move on bahx.. Prelims + O lvl fer 6 other Sub is still waiting fer us in 80 daes' time nehx.. JIA YOU, M2.. We mux all strive together!! WhOox..

Life carries on regardless wad happened.. Who can remember wad they've done last yr at this time wid who? We're all jux living everydae as e daes lived fer us.. People simply feel sad and cry, happie and cheer, angry and yell, confused and ignored.. Who wouldn't hide their feelings from another in fear of wad others mite think? People put on a mask to show thier best n nicest part to others.. Who dun? Everyone wants happiness, No one wants pain.. But, u can't make a rainbow without a lil rain.. So, jux cherish wad u have n those ard u.. nItex time.. (-_-)zzZzZ
