      What I have found interesting for sometime is the fact that the United States federal government  urlLink gives more money  to the government of Egypt than to any other except Israel.  Yet they still refuse after 20 years to move toward free market reforms and greater freedom for their people.  Not to mention the fact that the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt is persecuted and  urlLink discriminated against by the government .  Once again, your tax dollars at work.  And I'm sure many so-called "evangelical Christians" in the United States are concerned when Muslims persecute Christians, but urlLink  not when Israelis do .  However, I'm sure a lot of evangelical Protestants don't really care since they consider us Orthodox Christians not be Christians, while they treat Israeli Orthodox Jewish extremists who hate Christianity as their allies.    Why do we continue to give money to the likes of Egypt (and Israel)?  If you want empirical evidence, hasn't 20 years of nothing but more oppression demonstrated the failure in our policy?

      The Libertarian Party  urlLink nominated it's candidate for president  yesterday. Catallarchy has an  urlLink interesting article  on the matter and I think I'll weigh in on it.  To be blunt, I'm for the total abolition of the state. Not limited government, not constitutional republicanism, but market based anarchy. To me, the LP and other mainstream libertarian organizations are acting foolish. They're spending so much money on getting in good with the government that they aren’t taking the time to support and take part in major research and educational efforts. I hate to sound pessimistic, but the LP isn't going to make a splash anywhere anytime soon if they do not have a major refocusing of their efforts from electoral politics to education. Lew Rockwell wrote a great  urlLink column  on the issue a little while back. I borrow from him when I say that to become a bureaucrat to fight bureaucracy, to join the state in order to roll it back, makes as much sense as fighting fire with matches and gasoline.

      Story  urlLink here . The neocons have actually been calling for a gas tax for a while now, but now supposedly free market Chicago economist Gary Becker is calling for a gas tax as well. Slate does get something right though:  " The irony is that the free market forces that many of these writers normally extol are actually working. Americans are buying more Priuses and fewer Hummers. Ford is rushing a hybrid SUV into production. Car-buyers need to be bribed to purchase gas-guzzlers. The Wall Street Journal reported today that U.S. automakers have jacked up SUV rebates by an average of 17 percent from last year. Givebacks on tanks like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator are up 50 percent.  "  This is very similar to what the government's own statistics show about the period after WW2 and before the EPA. During that time, emissions were down about 25%, and gas consumption in vehicles was down in similar numbers.  All of this before any regulatory agency was established to watch over the industry.  So... why did we need that agency again? When asked in the early 1990s, the head of the EPA could not answer that question.

       urlLink It may be a first . The article does tell it straight, though. I could not possibly be more fed up than I am with the "blogosphere" and their constant ranting about the news media and Iraq. Do they report everything going 'well' in Iraq? No. But do they try to make it look like the end of the world? Once again, no. The media in all forms is biased, even the "transparent" blogosphere. As they surely know, most bloggers have been extremely kind and supportive of nearly every war thrown at them, and they too have not reported all they could. Do we then have to call for their heads? No, we just stop reading them and find news somewhere else.

      Richard Neville today on  urlLink Nick Berg's murder .   "· They are well-fed, fidgety, and reveal glimpses of white skin.   · Their Arabic is heavily accented (Russian, Jordanian, Egyptian).   · An aside in Russian had been translated as "do it quickly".   · One character wears bulky white tennis shoes.  · The man on the far left stands in the familiar "at ease" military posture.  · The men's scarves are worn and tied by people who "haven't a clue", says conspiracy theorist Hector Carreon, like actors in Hollywood movies."   Now, I have not seen the video, nor do I want to, so I cannot lend any verification to those points. But, with all of the US and Iraqi bickering about who had him when, there are questions that need to be answered about this incident.

      Butler Shaffer  urlLink writes  today at LRC on his view of Memorial Day and other federal holidays. It's definitely not PC, and it pulls few punches. It's a strange situation for me- my father and grandfather served in the US Army during the Cold War and WW2, respectfully. I don't hold anything against 99% of the soldiers who have served in the US Army and military, all of those I have met are well-intentioned and good people who simply see things much differently than myself. But I agree with Shaffer that not once since the Revolutionary War has a US Army fought for our freedom. I think that, once again, the Cato Institute is busy in  urlLink PC appeasement of the State.   They should be pointing out just how big the State has gotten due to war and the fear of foreign enemies, not worshipping at it's altar.

      Most of the people I meet through debate, school, and other social functions, are absolutely baffled by the libertarian conception of foreign policy and war. I think the subject must be clarified a bit. The major misconception when it comes to war and libertarians is that libertarians are pacifists. I have no doubt that some are. However, most are not. If you define a libertarian, as Rothbard, Kinsella, and Hoppe have, your definition would be one who does not believe in the initiation, or threat of initiation of force, against an individual and his property. This basic theme is often known as the Non-Aggression Axiom, Non-Aggression Principle, Libertarian Property Ethic, and other names.   Now let's break it down.   Is this ethic pacifistic? No. The ethic strictly prohibits the  initiation  of aggression, not the use of force in self-defense. In fact, most subscribers to the non-aggression principle are strong advocates of self-defense, militia organization, and gun ownership.   Does this ethic justify preemptory war? No. Preemptory war falls into the category of the initiation of aggression. The War in Iraq is  impossible  to justify if you subscribe to the non-aggression axiom. Bush and the Neocon's Iraq war, then, to those subscribing to the non-aggression axiom, is at worst murder and at best negligent homicide.   Can any wars be justified by the non-aggression axiom? Yes, but it is rare. For a war to be compatible with this principle, it must be fought on the defensive and voluntarily funded and manned. A good example of this can be found in the War for Southern Independence. The Federal Government's aggressive action against the South, their conscription, their taxation of income, and their inflation all make their war completely unjust. The South, on the other hand, fought for her defense and independence. However, the South also used conscripts and inflated their currency. While the cause of the south- secession - was certainly just, their method was not.   For more discussion on this topic and the non-aggression axiom, see  urlLink Hoppe's interview in Québécois Libre , Rothbard's  urlLink For a New Liberty , Chapters  urlLink 2  and  urlLink 13

      Today's  urlLink Cato Institute daily commentary  comes from Ludwig von Mises. It's about time that Cato and other "libertarian" organizations recognize and respect Mises, Rothbard, Hoppe, and others from the Austrian school. Of course, with an award  urlLink named after a Chicago boy , and that  urlLink award given to an admitted statist , I have little hope that the main proponent of 'libertarianism' in the country will give the hard-line libertarians their due.   Back to the article. It's from Mises Treatise  Human Action , one of the founding works of the modern Austrian School of Economics. It's right on when it says that capitalism and the free market are the ultimate guarantees of peace and freedom. If anyone thinks that war can bring him peace or security, this article shows just how wrong he is.

      John "kick one for me, guys" Derbyshire is  urlLink complaining  at National Review Online about far left and far right attacks on Bush and his people.    "Whatever you think on this point, at least acknowledge that George W. Bush and his administration are decent, intelligent, and patriotic Americans, with a century or so of collective experience in government between them, doing their honest best for the country. As opposed, I mean, to the stuff you hear from Bush-haters on the Left and Paleo-Right, to the effect that the Bushies are    Stupid — So stupid they let themselves be used as helpless pawns of Israel, Iran, the Saudis, or the oil lobbies (pick your preferred nutso conspiracy theory).  Venal — Just in it for the money, you know. Oil for blood, Halliburton, yada yada.  Crazy — The most popular diagnosis being religious dementia, GWB taking his orders directly from God."   He's obviously referring to groups like moveon.org, antiwar.com, and lewrockwell.com, and that's OK. I personally have gripes with the way many people have opposed the war in Iraq. I think the rampant name calling, while its not necessarily untrue, is not a good strategic move. Those against the war have a strong enough case on evidence, ethics, and history to wipe the floor with the neoconservative hawks.   Speaking of ethics, I have always wondered if the neoconservatives are even capable of maintaining a coherent theory of ethics and morality. They seem to be nothing short of left-wing moral relativists.

      I forgot to mention the Block-Epstein debate in my earlier post! This debate,  urlLink available for free  at the Mises Institute, is a great illustration of the dichotomy that exists between the two schools of thought. Block's Austrian-based anarchism contrasts wonderfully with Epstein's statism. Furthermore, if you read the comments below the link to the audio file, you'll find both analysis and links to help clarify any misunderstandings of Block's argumentation.

      In today's topsy turvy world we often go looking after things that are new and progressive.  The latest idea out of some philosopher's book or some think tank seem to dominate political circles.  The new fads coming out of the music and movie industry, trying to push the envelope even further, having already broken traditional boundaries.  Now, before some people fly off the handle, don't take this to mean I support censorship of any of these above mentioned things.  The first amendment of the Constitution guarantees them the right to produce what they will.  However, we must make a distinction between what is permissible by law and what is moral.  Lying to your mother about taking the car is legal, but not moral.  Committing adultery behind your wife's back is legal, but not moral.  Refusing to comply with an immoral law is illegal, however, it is virtuous.  Murder, however, is both illegal and immoral since it violates that persons moral right to the life given them, and it harms society by devaluing human personhood to the level of animality.    This is where tradition and culture are so important to the liberal society.  What do I mean by liberal?  Liberal in the classical sense; a society which recognizes that to allow virtue, you must also allow vice.  One that values the life of everyone from conception to death.  To do this you must allow the human person to spend their money as they will, do with their property as they will, and to think and believe what they will; all within the limit of reason.  By this limit I mean that as long as they are not adversely affecting the natural rights of another.  For example, if they spent their money on hiring a hit man to kill you, that is clearly immoral and illegal and falls outside of their rights.  Or, poisoning you land with radioactive waste, when you clearly know that it will irradiate other peoples land.    As an Anglo-Saxon I value my cultural heritage going back to the 5th century.  Anglo-Saxon society brought us Shakespeare, Elliot, Ricardo, Jefferson, Washington, Calhoun, and countless others.  The Anglo-Saxon virtues of honour and loyalty to ones lord and friends, as well as rugged survival instinct that has allowed us to endure tyranny and invasion both from foreign enemies and often our own government.  The Anglo-Saxon tradition helps me realize who my people are and I feel joy in this.  These comments are considered racist by some, that is, by those who hate Anglo-Saxon culture.  Feminists, black racists, neocons, socialists, and hosts of other want me hate the fact that my ancestors lived in a deeply religious and patriarchal society.  Anglo-Saxon men are evil, it is good when they are killed or oppressed.  They deserve punishment for their ancestors actions.  Nonsense.  If there was no Anglo-Saxon cultural heritage for America to build upon, we would not have the concept of freedom.  Germanic cultures (of which the Anglo-Saxons are the standard bearers) resisted every attempt to be dominated by those who claimed superiority over them.  The Romans spent hundreds of years in failed campaign after failed campaign.  Our Celtic brothers of Gaul fought for freedom to the point were almost all of their population was massacred by Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars.  Society is held together by common beliefs, respect for other inherent rights, faith, music, marriage, friendship, and trust.  This is what tradition is and why it matters.  By forsaking all of this, we turn our back upon all of human civilization for nearly 10,000 years.  I don't care if you are Anglo-Saxon, Slavic, Arab, Chinese, Latin, Jewish, or whatever.  Just realize that these traditions give us the combined knowledge of all our ancestors.  They weren't right about everything, but, they at least deserve a fair hearing.

      Story, via Fox News,  urlLink here . Interesting article. Particularly this part-   Laurie has reason to be concerned. In the last few years Israel has intercepted a number of ships carrying arms, including the Karine A, which was carrying 80 tons of weapons —enough to alter the balance of military power in the occupied territories.    Unless that ship was carrying tanks, which it obviously wasn't, no weapons can tilt the balance of power. As long as Israel has air power and armor, they don't need to worry about any tilting of the scales.

      It is not every day that people get to spend time with very good friends.  Time among good company is time well spent.  The Divine Liturgy this Sunday has taught me something very important: Life isn't found in being occupied with material things, but with God's Love.  As a libertarian I too often forget the fact that political and economic liberty is not an end in and of itself.  The reason I wish for political and economic liberty is so that there is time for myself to pursue those aspects of life which are important.  To love God, family, and friends.  We only find our true light when we learn to love one another.  Faith is a hard thing, and something not to be taken lightly.  But, it is to be taken slowly, and with small steps.  Then fear rises up in our hearts, fear as to what God might do.  Will he call me to do something I don't want?  That is always before many of us (including me).  But, we have to realize that Christ only offers us what is best.  Often I don't like to take advice from friends, relatives, and counselors because it seems as if I would be admitting my ignorance.  This is a habit that often leads to the wrong paths and makes me wish I had taken their advice.  However, I have to be allowed to make my own mistakes, only then can I see how truly in need of help I am.  For those who are not sure of faith, understand, hope is always within reach.  Friends are always there.  God doesn't expect us to be perfect right away.  Becoming Christian isn't about having a holier-than-thou attitude; it is about recognizing that we need God's love every day.  If you take the journey of faith it will be long and hard, many sacrifices will have to be made, but, speaking from personal experience, the days seem clearer and clearer at the end.  Cursing, anger, dirty thoughts and actions, and all the things that are sins (which are when we fail) aren't going to disappear immediately.  It took me years to rid myself of these passions to which I was enslaved.  What the Lord expects is for you to try, and if we fall, to get up and try again.  After all, what are friends supposed to help each other do, if not that?

      Great  urlLink post  at the Mises blog by Karen de Coster on the differences between Austrian and Chicago school economics. It's confusing to a lot of people. Some say the difference is monetary policy; others cite anarchism as the difference. But, as de Coster clarifies, the difference is methodology. Another key point made is that Chicago economics is  not  free market, laissez faire economics. It's certainly less heavy on intervention than Keynesian theory, but that isn't saying much.

      Just ran across  urlLink this  timely FEE article today while looking for somthing to write about. The article goes well with the Washington Times article I pointed out yesterday.    If property is liberty's other half, privacy is its guardian. The right to privacy is essential to the preservation of freedom for the simplest of reasons. If no one knows what I do, when I do it, and with whom I do it, no one can possibly interfere with it

       urlLink This  story has been in the news a lot the past week or so. The line is typical- Iraqis claim that US forces destroyed a wedding party in the desert, US claims it had evidence terrorists were present. However, the indignance of the US commanders in charge is astounding. I've not yet heard one of them deny the fact that women and children were killed in this raid, terrorist camp or not. And the supposed evidence they have pointing to terrorism is weak. On The O'Reilly Factor last week, Dan Senor of the CPA said that US forces found large supplies of weapons, passports, cash, and satellite communication equipment. I'm sorry, but is that it? I have passports, cash, and satellite communication equipment at my house! Nearly everyone I know owns at least two or three personal firearms, and some even have upwards of 20! These guns aren't your typical .22s either; we're talking AR-15s, MP5s, and AK-47s. The government's 'evidence' does not excuse  urlLink the horror of that night .   'We went out of the house and the American soldiers started to shoot us. They were shooting low on the ground and targeting us one by one'. She ran with her youngest child in her arms and her two young boys, Ali and Hamza, close behind. As she crossed the fields a shell exploded close to her, fracturing her legs and knocking her to the ground. She lay there and a second round hit her on the right arm. By then her two boys lay dead. 'I left them because they were dead,' she said. One, she saw, had been decapitated by a shell. 'I fell into the mud and an American soldier came and kicked me. I pretended to be dead so he wouldn't kill me. My youngest child was alive next to me'

      Story by The Straits Times  urlLink here .    From the dusty Sahara to the jungles of Indonesia and in the cauldron of unrest that is US-occupied Iraq, a new generation of Osama bin Ladens is emerging to take the place of elders who have been killed, captured or forced underground.

Even if the government is denying it, "Blowback," as they know it, is a serious problem. Check out this analysis at  urlLink Cato  for in depth research on the problem.

      I am a monarchist in the sense the Professor J.R.R. Tolkien would be.  Professor Tolkien said he would rather have a king who could sack his chief minister over a parliament any day.  But, my idea of a King is that of the King of Gondor in Lord of the Rings.  A far off distant figure who leaves well enough alone, and allows men to go about their business as long as they don't harm others.  It is interesting to me that it was only in the European monarchies that classical liberal ideas flourished.  Having a king who has to obey the sense of the Ten Commandments is preferable any day to Congress.  Long live monarcho-capitalism.

      A great, albeit brief, interview conducted by the Acton Institute's Religion and Liberty. Klaus served as Prime Minister of the Czech Republic in the early 90s. It is rather old, about 12 years old to be exact, but its message is not diminished by any time. Klaus is no dummy on economics either. When asked about the importance of a stable currency, he says   Inflation, by eroding the purchasing power of money and thus the trust of people in this crucial socio-economic institution erodes the virtue of thrift, ignites social conflicts arising from redistributional consequences of inflation, and thus endangers prosperity of the whole economy and the basic stability of a society.    I'm impressed. Most self-proclaimed economists don't even recognize this basic fact.

      Article by Victor Davis Hanson  urlLink here . I find myself more than a little dumbfounded when I read articles such as this. It's hardly an original message- The National Review and other neoconservative publications have been hammering the mantra of "The War in Iraq is the only moral thing to do" for a year now. Davis' thoroughly banal sermonizing gives me the urge to point him to a much more important sermon- Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.   If we are to discuss morality and the National Review, I must remind you that this is the magazine that has writers who have expressed their desire to have the troops "kick one for them" after the Abu Ghraib crimes became public. It's the magazine that believes that it's ok to kill 10,00 civilians in a war, and millions more in a blockade, as long as you get what they deem good results. And it's the magazine that sees nothing wrong with what Sherman and his troops did to the city of Atlanta in the War for Southern Independence. They may preach morality, but when it comes down to it, they're relativists.

      A very good question! The title "original right" originated, to my knowledge, from economist, historian, philosopher, and activist Murray Rothbard. Rothbard used the term to describe the coalition of right wing elements during the Great Depression who allied together to oppose FDR's tyrannical and socialistic New Deal, and in many cases, entry into the Second World War.   With the invention of the Internet, information now flows freely across the globe in a matter of seconds. Information and points of view previously out of the average person's reach are now at his fingertips. Debates that were once considered taboo are now widespread. This is a truly remarkable time.  And though we are blessed to live in a time in which learning is nearly unobstructed, we are faced with rampant statism and war. With the US Federal Government's 'War on Terror,' the state has a means by which to drastically increase the size, scope, and authority of their rule.   Those of us who truly believe in liberty, peace, and the market, are now obligated to spread the word and speak out in opposition to the increasing size of the state. Any victory for the state must be considered a defeat for human liberty. It can only gain by the destruction of our rights, lives, and property. This is why we must sound the call for liberty, the call for the rollback of the state, the call for an end to empire and belligerent war. It is the only hope for the future.

      While scanning Reynolds’s blog Instapundit, I found an  urlLink interesting post  @Salon on Michael Moore, Ray Bradbury, and Fahrenheit 9/11.  I agree with Bradbury on one point- Moore is an asshole. Though I don't care what he says about Bush foreign policy, his socialist views on the economy  urlLink are some of the worst out there today .   However, I disagree with Bradbury when he says Moore "stole" the title of Bradbury's famous Fahrenheit 451. Yes, Moore's movie borrows the title, however, there is no theft involved. Intellectual property, that is the idea that people have the rights to ideas, is completely illegitimate.   As stated above, the idea of intellectual property is the idea that someone has the exclusive rights to use the intangible creations of the mind. Proponents of IP say that there is no difference between tangible and intangible creations as it relates to the right to property.   When examining IP, we first must examine just what property is. Property, as defined by Locke, has two necessary preconditions- it must be scarce, and it must be in demand. Anything that is not scarce and not in demand is not, and cannot be, property.   Immediately then, we run into problems with IP. Namely, knowledge is not scarce in the economic sense. If I educate myself, I do not make anyone else dumber. That is, I do not, in acquiring knowledge, decrease anyone else's share. Stephen Kinsella writes,    IP is not naturally "scarce," in the economic sense. Under Lockean theory, the state of nature contains natural property, which is economically scarce, meaning that my use of Blackacre conflicts with your use of Blackacre. Use of such property is exclusive, since my use excludes yours, and vice-versa. So that scarce property and resources can be used without potential users eternally warring over these tracts, ownership is allocated (to the first user who "mixes his labor" with it, according to Lockean theory; or to the creator for created goods) so as to solve this problem.   However, were we in a Garden of Eden where land and other goods were infinitely abundant, there would be no scarcity and thus no need for property rules. For example, your taking my lawnmower would not really deprive me of it, if I could conjure up another in the blink of an eye. Lawnmower-taking in these circumstances would not be "theft". Thus, classical property rights do not seem to naturally apply to things of infinite abundance.    As knowledge is infinitely abundant and not restricted by any set quantity of knowledge, it cannot be considered property.   Now, this ethical argument does not stand well with utilitarian who believe in wealth maximization through government action or inaction. Utilitarian could care less about the ethics of a situation; they only wish to maximize wealth.   This theory of utilitarianism has numerous problems inherent in it. First and foremost is the inability to make any kind of interpersonal utility comparison. That is, because everyone's value scales are unique, one has no way of knowing if his actions will increase anyone's utility or value but his own. Because utilitarians cannot even show themselves capable of making such comparisons, their arguments are not solvent.   For example- most utilitarian proponents of IP state that if we did not have patents to protect inventors, they would go uncompensated for their inventions and we would loose incentives to innovate and develop new technologies.   However, Mr. Kinsella has pointed out that patent law only covers what is considered to be a practical innovation. That is, while an airplane that makes use of the laws of aerodynamics is patentable, the laws of aerodynamics themselves are not patentable. This intervention reduces the incentive for theoretical research and rewards only practical research. One cannot say that either theoretical or practical research would maximize wealth in the long run, and thus one cannot say whether or not patents increase the utility of society in the long run.   I could go on, but you're probably better off reading Kinsella himself. His website can be found in my links section.

      Great LRC  urlLink article  by Thomas DiLorenzo on neocons and Lincoln.    The Lincoln myth is the ideological cornerstone of the American welfare/warfare state because it deifies not only Lincoln but all of his successors. It provides the necessary moral cover for the crushing of states’ rights as limits on federal power at home and for military adventurism abroad. As Robert E. Lee warned in a letter to Lord Acton in 1866, the destruction of states’ rights and the transformation of the American government into one consolidated empire was sure to become despotic at home and aggressive abroad. A truer forecast was never made. The Lincoln myth has been the essential ingredient in the destruction of the Jeffersonian political tradition in America, in other words.    DiLorenzo is right on. Just scan the Claremont Institute website and you'll find near-religious worship of Father Abe.

      WaPo story  urlLink here . What I do not understand is why those supporting this and other subsidization of education constantly complain about the increasing costs of college. I would point them to Neal McCluskey's  urlLink brief  on the issue.    The report -- released to herald the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act -- quickly identifies the tuition rocket's likely fuel: "Beginning with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government ... has provided significant funding to help ensure that low- and moderate-income students and families are not prevented from receiving a postsecondary education simply because of financial circumstances." This year, thanks to the Education Act, "roughly $90 billion [was invested] in higher education, with the bulk of that money, about $65 billion, [going] directly to students...."   Consider that $65 billion going directly to students and its effect on demand: A student will "purchase" education at a price he can afford. Extra education money enables him to pay a higher tuition. In the aggregate, multiple billions in student aid artificially inflate demand -- and average tuition -- as students who might not have gone to college do, and others attend more expensive institutions than they otherwise would have.    The government, through its subsidization policies, is toying with the price of higher education. When that price rises, they point to greedy universities. But if they fall, I guarantee the state would take all the credit.

      Maybe some people will accuse me of being hung up on this issue.  Frankly, I don't know.  What I do know is that my heart is torn for the Coptic people of Egypt (as it is for the Palestinians in Israel).  From the  urlLink Al-Kosheh massacre  of January 2000 when 25 Coptic Christians were killed in a riot, all the way to arrest. Imprisonment, and death of a  urlLink Coptic Orthodox priest, and two parishoners because  they dared to repair a brick wall without government permission!  How would some of our readers like to live in a country where you have to carry around an ID card informing the police of your religion, or where your daughter  urlLink could be raped , and then forced to convert to Islam no matter what you say or do?  Yet, the Egyptian government receives more foreign aid than any other country, except Israel.    Why? Why do so many Americans not care? Well, because the Copts are virtually unknown, although they make up 15% of the population of Egypt.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that we go into Egypt guns blazing, like we went into Iraq.  We would have a worse mess in Egypt than in Iraq.  Why don't we start with stopping all foreign aid to Egypt (and hey, while we're at it, stop all foreign aid period).  Secondly, stop interventionist policies all around the Muslim world, that engender nothing but hatred and disgust for all Westerners, whom they think are all Christians.    By giving Egypt foreign aid for decades we have unwittingly supported a failing dictatorship, and been implicit in the Egyptian governments policies of repression.

      Ron Paul via LRC  urlLink here . Ron Paul attacks what is seen as a sacred cow by Washington and it's enablers- that government can protect us. He writes,   But the obvious lesson of September 11th is that government cannot protect us. Even with trillions of tax dollars spent on “defense,” hijacked planes flew unchallenged over our skies and attacked national symbols of business and government. Yet now we’re told to put even more faith into the same bureaucracies that failed us so miserably in the past? Self-reliance and self-defense are American virtues; trembling reliance on the illusion of government-provided security is not.   He could not be any more correct in his analysis. He continues,    It’s easy for elected officials in Washington to tell Americans that government will do whatever it takes to defeat terrorism, but it’s your freedom and your tax dollars at stake – not theirs.    Because our government can ensure their own profits and livelihood by taxing us, they have no economic incentive to act efficiently and protect us. In fact, they have every  dis incentive to do so. If a government worker were to look out for his economic well-being, he does not have to serve consumers, only his boss. For his boss, he simply has to convince the higher-ups that there is a crisis that necessitates more spending on his agency. No one has to serve the consumers, make us safer, etc- that would only make their posts expendable.   There is a plethora of literature out there regarding Austrian economics and market anarchism, and I suggest you read as much of it as you can. The national defense myth, that is that some far off, self-serving government employee can protect us, is the very intellectual foundation of all governments. If this foundation disappears, so do our rulers.

      Op-ed from TNR online  urlLink here .   First off, the article's tone and moral backing is consequentialist in nature, and I have already made public  urlLink my thoughts  on that kind of moral theory. Also, Hanson seems to think he knows all, for example:   Clear success in Falluja--defined not just by apparent tranquility, but the absence of arms caches, nocturnal assassins, and organized gangs of Baathists using homes and businesses to foment insurrection--will undermine Sadr's militias, embolden democracy-minded moderates, and frighten Iran and Syria into curbing their mischief. Iran will talk to us soon enough about behavior that promotes stability rather than terrorism--but only when they have real reason to fear U.S. success in Iraq.    I would love to find out how he knows this. Writes Matthew Hirsch for the Mises Institute,   In each case, though, the focus is on the repercussions of an interventionist U.S. foreign policy. Sometimes called "blowback," or what might otherwise be identified by Misesians as the unanticipated consequences of government action, the lesson is the same whether dealing with foreign or domestic policy. Government policy presumes a static and unchanging world and cannot predict or account for the human response to its policies. Even its "dynamic" models are static because they cannot account for every variation.  In foreign policy, the problem is arguably worse than in domestic policy, because the government deals with political systems its supposed experts cannot understand, cultures that are unfamiliar, and unleashes forces and responses that it never expected. The result is always some "crisis," which means nothing more than a dangerous development that had not been part of the plan.    To make it short, there is no way anyone can predict the outcome of any foreign engagement, to do that would require us to understand every possible action taken by every possible actor involved. In such situations, you always have unexpected consequences. Throughout history, we see that these consequences often outweigh any good that came from the original intervention. US entry into WWI set the stage for the massive allied victory that led to Germany's subjugation. US entry into the Russian Civil War between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks gave the two nations nothing but mistrust, that mistrust and continued interventions by US government in regional affairs gave us a Cold War. These blowbacks were far more damaging that the initial problem. Even Hanson's example of US defeat in Vietnam was an unforeseen consequence of an originally minor intervention. The Cato Institute has done an  urlLink extensive survey  of this subject. Still, however, we have pundits and politicos who do not understand this simple principle.

      I was going through the  urlLink archives  of Rod Long's  urlLink weblog , and I ran across a series of  urlLink articles  dealing with, at least in part, the moral philosophy of consequentialism. That is, that wrongdoing is justified if it brings a positive result. Professor Long writes,   I don’t regard consequentialism as a viable moral theory. Thus murder remains a forbidden rights-violation, regardless of whether some “good” comes of it. Or, to put it another way, no good on balance can come from an immoral act, because no result counts as good if achieved through wickedness. Either way, no end can justify an immoral means.     I'm in agreement with him on this point. If one holds that immoral action is just if "good" comes of it, then one  has no real objection to torture, genocide, or robbery  if it benefits the "greater good." They only have an objection if it does not have net benefits. In many ways, this is the position of many on the War in Iraq. Even though the US has killed upwards of one million Iraqis since the early 90s, most of them children, that's not a problem since we had good intentions and seek to bring them democracy. To them, the government's intentions justify mass murder. Similar arguments are made by the left to justify regulation, redistribution, and affirmative action programs. They may violate property rights, but they create a net benefit. And if we are to get to the crux of the matter, all supporters of the state are consequentialists to some degree or another. The state's very existence is predicated on the theft of income and property from the producers, a violation of their rights to keep and own property. However, they see the state as necessary for establishing justice, ignoring much of the important scholarship on the utilitarian side of anarchism. The consequentialist argument is flawed to the core precisely because it holds no principled opposition to any violation of rights as long as they benefit society at large.

      Article  urlLink here .     In fact, it could be argued that one of the most serious emerging threats to human rights today is Amnesty's decision to spend a disproportionate share of its limited resources attacking the United States--at the opportunity cost of focusing attention on governments that are slaughtering, enslaving, torturing, and imprisoning millions of people around the world....   I think Ghitis is drawing a false dichotomy between "governments that are slaughtering, enslaving, torturing and imprisoning millions" and "The United States." The US Govt. embargo of Iraq has led to over one million deaths. Ten thousand more, at least, have died as 'collateral damage.' Similar 'collateral damage' is also found in Afghanistan. Say what you will about our motives, they do not justify this level of death. Let's not forget that the only reason Saddam was even in power was because we propped him up as a counterbalance to the Ayatollah Khomeini, whom also only came to power because of US meddling.   And if we are to talk slavery, let's talk about the legitimacy of the very existence of the State. If we reject slavery, and define slavery as a condition of subjection or submission characterized by lack of freedom of action or of will, then we must also reject the state. Allow me to illustrate-  1. Slavery is immoral 2. Slavery is a condition of subjection or submission characterized by lack of freedom of action or of will 3. The State is legitimate.   One cannot hold two of those views without rejecting a third- The State's existence is only supported by the subjugation of a segment of the population through taxation, coercion, and intimidation- slavery.

      	In the spring of 1966, Murray Rothbard’s Left and Right carried an  urlLink editorial  describing Cold War revisionism as the major historical task of the day. Rothbard saw the struggle between the ‘official’ state-sponsored versions of history and revisionism to be one of the utmost importance.   	Today, the importance of revisionism is unchanged. The history taught to the nation’s students in the state’s schools is flat out wrong. My generation is coming up ignorant of the history of this nation and the world. Nearly everyone simply accepts what he is taught without any thinking or analysis.  	Revisionism is important because it takes the ammunition from those who seek to enlarge the state.  Around Memorial Day, we are bombarded by reminders from statist historians that those men who served their country during wartime were fighting to secure our freedom. They invoke the images of Lincoln, Wilson, FDR, and Reagan in an effort to support the state’s most recent war. If we allow these propagandists to go unchallenged in their interpretation of our history, we doom ourselves to a defeat in the war of ideas.   	This Memorial Day, we see a perfect example of this invocation. The Chicago Sun-Times ran a  urlLink column  yesterday on the current war in Iraq and the War for Southern Independence. Steyn writes,    You think Iraq's a quagmire? Lincoln's ''new birth of freedom'' bogged down into a centurylong quagmire of segregation, denial of civil rights, lynchings. Does that mean the Civil War wasn't worth fighting? That, as Al Gore and other excitable types would say, Abe W. Lincoln lied to us?   His version of history has been taught in schools for as long as public schooling has existed on a large scale. Because his is the orthodox view of history, this column will serve as a resounding reminder of our moral purpose to a majority of the public.   	And this is precisely why revisionism is so important to the cause of liberty. Were the public educated on the causes, effects, and historical implications of the War for Southern Independence, this article would not resonate with anyone. It would likely be ridiculed and laughed at by most people if they knew the truth about that horrible war. Instead, it will re-affirm the belief in Bush’s war. We cannot allow this to continue if we hope to ever win the war of ideas

       urlLink This must be the product of government schooling.   Let's look at some quotes.   You think Iraq's a quagmire? Lincoln's ''new birth of freedom'' bogged down into a century long quagmire of segregation, denial of civil rights, lynchings. Does that mean the Civil War wasn't worth fighting? That, as Al Gore and other excitable types would say, Abe W. Lincoln lied to us?   Why I most certainly do think reconstruction was horrible, and that Lincoln was a liar! No, the Yankee invasion of the South was NOT justified. Go read DiLorenzo, Wilson, and other revisionist scholarship on the war, and then tell me that Lincoln was right.    hey had victims galore back in 1863, but they weren't a victim culture. They had a lot of crummy decisions and bureaucratic screwups worth re-examining, but they weren't a nation that prioritized retroactive pseudo-legalistic self-flagellating vaudeville over all else. They had hellish setbacks but they didn't lose sight of the forest in order to obsess week after week on one tiny twig of one weedy little tree.   Wrong again! If not for Lincoln's dictatorial policies, Delaware, Maryland, and even New York may have drifted out of the union! And let us not forget that Lincoln shut down more than three hundred newspapers during his war on the South, effectively silencing criticism of his regime.    Playing by Gore-Kennedy rules, the Union would have lost the Civil War   If he means by telling the truth about the motives, implications, and costs of the war, he's absolutely right. However, as I have said before, Lincoln didn't allow that to happen because he silenced, shut down, and exiled opposition. Hell, he even arrested the head of the Supreme Court!   Mr. Steyn has unwittingly proved the point of the paleoconservative/libertarian anti-war camp, and for that I drink to his ignorance.

" Beatings, torture, imprisonment, and even killings of Palestinians have become commonplace. Palestinian farmers have been deprived of water for their farms, while Israeli farmers get what they need. Palestinian freedom of travel has been restricted or denied on numerous occasions, making it difficult or impossible to visit family or go to work, thus causing economic hardship. Christian and Moslem Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza have been prevented from worshiping at Jerusalem's religious sites for security reasons. Palestinian merchants who sell watermelons in the local market have been beaten because they sliced open the watermelons, revealing the colors of the Palestinian flag, which was forbidden at the time. Palestinians have also been beaten for wearing shirts in the colors of the Palestinian flag. During the recent election, right-wing Israeli party posters placed in front of polling places falsely warned Palestinians that their health and pension benefits would be taken away if they voted, greatly reducing the number of Palestinians who dared to vote. Some of those who tried to vote were beaten by police. "

To make a long story short, I got very sick for a few weeks, went on a road trip, and then after that just forgot all about blogging and, in all honesty, economics, philosophy, and politics all together.  However, that just changed.  I just got back from  urlLink Mises University  in Auburn Alabama a few days ago, and I can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever done. I learned more in a week than I have learned in most years at government funded schools in my home state of North Carolina. Not only though did I learn, I was inspired to continue learning, thinking, and spreading the word about Austrian economics, libertarianism, and market anarchy. So, with that said, I'll probably be blogging a lot more in the future.  Blogging will formally resume in around 22 hours....
