Y is this world pple so fuck one… whenh pple is down, I really interested n concern towards pple, but y when I need corncens no body actually carry out?????????????????? Afternoon @ edwin’s house already said I hav low self-esteem, he n zhuan heard it, n also I said I am extra n useless, they didn’t confort me, but say ya lar, u r useless bla bla bla lar. Even zhuan say so. I believe even though zhuan character is liddat, if he is really trasure the frenship, he will not agree wif me, he should comfort me. N juz now online, he didn’t even show a words of concern onli aft I ask 4 it, n he asked whether had I eaten? Wad is this man, fuck. Me really feeling extra n useless in this world liao, somemore they still luo zing sea shi. I always been strong, even though I am sensitive towards feelingssssss, if not I would hav really died by suicide liao. I really hope I would do tt, but I always comfort myself PERSONALLY!!!! Sometimes can even feel the real heart ache in it u noe… n u noe how tt feels???? Sometimes when I feel hurt I really enjoy the hurt. I onli got 1 true fren, zhuan, n he liddat treat me. Becoz of yesterday massage, he 2day said me besides massage, I am useless!~ how cum pple whu re bad get so many gd things???????????????????????????? Maybe I am the bad one….dono lar. No stead nor true frenz liao… my death shall make no diff in this world. Even my 2nd aunt also fed uip wif me………………….. my freq is juz totally diff frm everyone in this world lar, maybe next time when I survice, I shall commit crimes to make myself happy. Yea, juz now when I really enjoy toking, they both say I am vv noisy……….. but if I keep quiet, I really feel sad sad sad sad. Like tt day in coffee shop above Mac, n always last time, they would always suan me, I display a sad face n they nv ever bother!	 As I said, wad 4 be such a gd person, no one realizes it at all. When I am gd, nth happen, when I bad abit, pple will say me bad 4 plenty of things, as if I was not gd at all.

IF all this really leaks out, i don really mind lor, coz i somehow gave up this unit liao.  In these yrs in np, my memorial events r esp. NDP 2003. Then my Camp Sapphire 2003, Sec.2 Atc, fellow squadmates in the same old unit, n of coz my squad (B 2003) then B 2002.  Many frenz were made in NDP 03, all frm diff unit all across sg, suffering under e hot sun every sat. n ended up having red arms n hands, face n of coz a 'v' shape on e neck. The sorching heat we had in the parade ground except when our umbrellas opened... E times in indoor stadium, when eating pizza n KFCsss. Oya, got once when we dono waiting 4 wad, someone asked me how old am i, n she called me 'ah pek' aft me revelling my age to her... becoz i was 1 yr older.. haha... Many frenz n chio bu there, e trg we gone through... memories...... WEll, having a crush on edwina, tian, yongni..haiz... me flirt right?? now v v seldom c edwina online liao, maybe get ready 4 Os ba, i also hav to prepare my Os 2.. haha. Rememering ther is once b4 we march in, while waiting n tok tok, a Crescent Sec NCC Land Cpl n i like 'zai lai dian' to each other... she is also another one i somehow had a crush on her too. Anyway lik i say, let nature takes it coz. N now i yi ge stead dou mei you...haha. NDP 03, shall always be in my heart.  Sigh, sgss npcc B2001... don mention abt them lar, juz to say onli a few good ones but they r not so active. The CIs, i really don like them xcept 4 the Ng's n sometimes Huang, Gerry still ok lar. I juz don like the LOH! Haiz, even if i go 4 CI Coz, i will not cum back to st.gabs... given up hope liao.    Dono y, as long as sat. no trg, i will be v sian, like now i am writting this blog as u can c ba hor. But When go down 4 np, hav to c their colours...haiz...  Lastly, Wei Ling, I hope to c u again... even though it has been so many yrs, i still hope i can c u. LAst time, me got no initiatives to ask 4 telephone no. r wad so ever, sch, date of birth... all dono. Onli noe ur name. Now e Konika shop @ serangoon central is no more, n i dono where u r... haiz. Maybe one day c u on e streets, also dono tt person is u... Anyway, wish u good health n always safe n sound, nv ever get bullied r nv let any harm get to u...n gd luck to wadever u do.

      Gezz.. here to write my blog again. Today I had both sad n happy times. Sad…………. Huhhh, is abt becoz of e same guy ba.. Dono y his freq always diff from me one lor… when smt tok things he sure hav things to say, n when ague he would always say tt I am right and he is always wrong… lame right?? 4 example, when I told one of my fren tt I had a Christian name n he overheared it, he said do u noe wad Christian name r for??? As if I dono like tt. bUt Of coz I noe lar, my this name is my ah-ma n other family members giv one, n they noe the meanings of it n they told me b4. n so does he means tt I dono wad it means????? Arrrrhh. Basically I felt tt he juz think he noe much more things lar, which is e truth. But he don hav to project a image which make pple feel tt he himself don.. N also somewhere las yr, a news article abt e commandos unit was disqualified from best unit comp, n when he mentioned abt this to me n my frenz, I continued conversation. N guess wad?? He said tt ‘as if I noe liddat’. Wad the f is this man.  Haiz, lets 4get abt the sad part. Today alone went to NYP open house, e place was really an eye-opening sia… maybe becoz everything is in one building and saw shops selling things, like in a shopping centre liddat. Maybe I nv xplore SP n NP ba… tts y. Over ther, I saw a few frenz… 2 whom I noe frm NDP parade, 1 senior of mine in sch, 1 ex-gabrielite n 2 school mates frm ncc lamd one… N also saw a fren whom I noe frm camp sapphire~~ Well, it still a little sad as e person whom I hope 2 c were not there….

      Nearly scared me, tot password wrong… but in e end get it right. Noe mi feeling bit down ba, don feel like doin my sch wrk even though now DT is my 1st priority coz of e folio.  Haiz, today as usual got trg, but today one is rehearsal 4 this comin sat. DC visit. Haiz, n y ther r pple who like to the calls e shot, e black chinese guy… haiz. Becoz of his character nowadays mi attitude him liao, wa lau, I his senior n nv show repect one lor, e same way he treat other pple, n also suck up to pple one.. haiz… this type of pple, although he has e leadership I muz say. Still can rem last time, when they were sec 2, abt to take over tt time, waaa, damm guai.. listen to me bla bla bla, show respect to many pple, n when take over liao, hack care us luike shit liddat. Smt feel like punching his dark skin face. 	Anyway, regarding the unit, I tink I can really step down liao lor, now I pass the admin backto Cis, n how they wanna settle is their prob. Oya, even though today I said many times abt attendance taking, I tink nobody in the end took the trouble to take the attendance of their squad. Coz this batch they hac care admin one I noe., b4 becoming NCOs, all dream of goin to trg dept liao, whu will care admin n log????  	Also, aft trg heard frm mr.low, tt npcc may be closed down to form another uniform group, merging the police n civil defence to form a home team uniform group. In some sense aft mi givin much tot to it, I think this oplan would be beta coz CD will not be left out, although npcc has courses wif CD. This merge I tink will increase e variety of activities like first aid n other CD stuffs lor. but is sad to hav npcc close down. But I tink this plan may start aft when I completed my years of CI if can lar..

      WEnt 4 a 4 days 3 mights camp @ sch for e Sec.1 orientation camp of coz. But got tution on e 1st  night so hav to go home, n went back to sch on the next morning. Esp tt day was e day to go P.Ubin. Haiz, e Sec.1s all like vv slack liddat, can tget things moving fast. N also my Sec.3 ncos, also not tt fierce enough. Rem, e time @e beach, e sec 1s r juz too slow, so i knock them down, but the effect wasnt immediate n so i hav to say another time. When i said it 4 e 2nd time, i was afraid tt the sec.1s would not listen n will hav some kind of rebel attitude lor, also scared tt sec.1s r not afraid of my power. But lucky they seemed to be like follow my instructions.  I still can rem tt evening, when some grps r waiting to go 4 their bath, they were quite noisy n 1 of my sec.4 cant control them. But my apperance made the sec.1s kept quiet~~ This reminds me of my Sec.2s when they were under me last yr, they also like this yr sec.1s, saw me then start to tell each other 'Shhh.. Shhh..' one. Haiz. At e 1st day of camp, 1 sec.1 sprained his wrist in e morning, n so the sec.3s let him take a rest. Later in e afternoon @ e AV room he suddenly cried becoz of his pain, i wonder how he can tahan e pain 4 so long... Regarding their trip to Ubin, i felt tt they were vv lucky, becoz of our T.O Mr Tay, e security guard @ the NPCC Campsite let us in to let the sec1s to c the np campsite. For all my years in np, i can onli step into e campsite when we hav our ATC ther, if not don tink of even entering. Anyway, my 2 yrs of ATC were camped @ the old campsite, n the new site was built abt 2 yrs ago... On e last nite of e camp, tt was e 1st time in my life i had not slept 4 24 hours! E CIs, HO, Mr Low n I were at the staff lounge toking craps n also abt the DC visit lor.

Now my cloest fren is Zhuan lor, n nowadays he like vv bz liddat, always go home aft sch, coz he hates sch, tts y. Maybe becoz my classmates all hav things in common ba, n they are all able to mix with each other well. Me le, usually quiet quiet one. But i can c those pple quiet one also together wif bunch of pple lor. Maybe my fate is liddat ba, fated to hav no true frenz lor, anyway used to it 4 the past 17 yrs liao. Wad to do?

      Bit tired of life thesedays. Tinking abt slping @ night feel sian also, coz I hav been goin to slp @ night 4 e past 17 yrs. N having to wake up n go 2 sch again if not stay @ home dono do wad also. Haiz, there’s quite some dust in my room, n it is accumulating  fast. Tink of cleaning also tired of it liao. Well, currently now my fav. Past time is to either play com. Games or online game r do my 10-years series. Last wk I got e hook onto the maths 10 yrs series. Dono whether will I be doin the same 4 this coming Sunday? Tml is sec 3 marksmanship. N me will go 2 sch early to do some unit admin stuff. Haiz, smt tink of it y am I doin all this? With all those bloody sec4s haning around. I noe they don like us, B2000 and so r we to them. Onli noe how 2 suck up when the time comes. Still can rem the days when they r still cadets, as cadets they r already rather rebelious n vv attitude. Me take them when I was sec.3 f up wif them, damm assholes. But luckily, if I am not wrong, no sec 4s will be goin tml n so r Cis. Yeah~ Got sec.3 whose uniform even lost, n me hav to ask Edwin to bring his uniform down tml, n juz now he called me tt he cant find his uniform, so shafik got no uniform to wear tml lor I guess, unless miracle appears. Now in class, I prefer in sitting in e way I am not then compared sitting beside the TK Leong, who is either saying tings out of nowhere, relating to nth basically n tell his own tales out of sudden- like ‘hey, u noe my fren hor vv funny one, he… …’ if not things like ‘the British army las time/ now hav this tt this tt bla bla bla’. All abt military stuffs. If not toking, he will be @ dazed during lesson time, bitting his fingernails. N usually him n I broke out into quarrels due to all of his toking craps out of nowhere. He looked to me like a hypocrite 2 me, onli start to really befren to e person when he needs help frm tt part. Person. So like today I refuse to lent him my chem. File, wads e use of leanding him n he is not appreciating it? I still can rem las yr wad he said, ‘u nv treat me good b4’, bloody bastard. Despite of e tings I done 4 him, I has the guts to say tt. Lionel Q, this yr start to learn dono wad attacking skills, using stationarys like pens, compasses to behave e way like X-men, holding the pen by his fingers n juz swoop to cut thro e person’s throat. N this was taught by yulin. Lionel, also anti-sociall n dono how 2 control n manage himself well enough, I not saying tt I am act. Good, but in this case abt lionel, I really tink he is. Like during e visit to Metta Home, he reserved himself n does not go forward towards the pple ther. While we r preparing ourselves for songs, he stood one corner n I went over to bring him forward, n this time where is Alvin, if he really a fren of quek! Then @ the canteen area, juz nice during tt day of our visit was 2 person’s birthday, n we served the cakes to others, n lionel stood ther not doin anything, juz watching the rest of his classmates doin the job. When getting results @ sch, whenever he score badly, r pple force to c his marks even lionel was refusing, he would then sink in his chair, cross his arms n hav a angry look, reserving himself 4 abt 5-10 mins. Anyway, I really dono wad r e minds of these pple, but I am interested to find out, so if I manage to go to e U, I may wan to take up physo course if ther is one. As 4 my social circle, I hav a rather small r mini one, coz I tink I am not tt well-liked. Although I get along fine wif most of my classmates xcept pple like corny n tim, whose mouth is out of control one. I c them like maintain contact aft sch n hangout together, me? Juz tok 2 them in class times then aft sch, off we go on our own way. Ppple like Edwin, gone ITE now, I don really like him also, always giv the gangster tones… … Haiz, this world I hav a lot of unhappiness lor, n keeping all these 4 years while hoping tt I could share it wif someone. But juz 4 e sake of saying out, I type it out here. I still hav other unhappiness abt my life n feeling of unfairness,  n occasionally tink of dieing 2. Haiz… ….coz I believe die is a relief n not a crime lor, if suicide is not against e law, n everyone is doin it, isn’t tt gd in some sense? Beside reducing population n saving food prod. If there is a day 100% of humans in this world is to die, wont the earth be great!?! Having able to restore itself, reducing grennhouse effect? A earth wif no trouble n war?  N wad I wad I am moving myself by saying to myself I wan to noe my fate n how will my life be in e future, maybe by tt time I don even tink of e same way as I am tinking now!~~~

After Wilson past the bags to the galz then I went off liao, n they went into the house, dono wad will they do inside also, sec.1 galz n sec.4 bois…. Haha, wif no other pple around.. whu noes wad will happen? But I believe nth will happen lar. 	Hmm.,. mi hav to finish my exploration of ideas as soon as possible lor, but e prob is tt I don hav e mood to draw so many stuffs lor, but still hav to press on, this year taking Osss wad to do? Haiz…. No one motivate mi so I hav to do it by myself.. cum’on man, do ur DT foilo!!!!!!!!!!!! Haha… maybe mi juz check mail then offline n do start wrk ba!!!

      Dono how to express my feelings… Anwe, dono whether can this diary of mine is able to be uploaded to online blog in e 1st place anot. Coz preiously tried to access to the webby to type all this words appears to hav a prob, which it hangs everytime when I click the link to add a new entry.  Well, firstly, is abt the SPF_NPCC badge. I felt it was unfair 4 e both of them to hav been awarded. U can say I am jealous but I can seriously tell u tt I am not, is juz t is not fair lor… Firstly is tt I had contributed so much to this letdown useless unit… the forming of Air-Rifle course suggestion to the previous OC early last yr. E efforts put in over 2 yrs of UOPA, efforts 4 makin both admin n log to become efficient when I am sec 3 n early sec 4. Made sure tt my B2003 r up to standard which I did, which comprises of their attendance by goin to their class on Monday moring b4 assembly 4 those whu failed to attend sat trg. N this n tts lar… Despite of all my commitment, those two fagots got it! The spf-npcc badge! Bet is mark low played a trick to it. He sure place the two of them in the first n second place of priority. I juz cant get it y! Izzit becoz their commitment is more den mine? Den I should say the f-ing mark low didn’t see the true whole picture lor I should say. Is not becoz I am self-centred r wadsoever which made mi say this lor… I strongly believe tt if u were to see the whole pic u will understand how I fell… Those 2 ass-holes, onli done trg wrk, but their attitude sucks, onli suck-up one lor, which I don’t n never! How I noe, is coz I seen them suckin up to mark low n other CIs lor, n den @ times tried doin e same to mi n I didn’t gave in to their suckin-up. Thinkin again, of all the admin I have done, all e proper file lings I had done,,,, which all this I nv seen other sec.4s r 3s done it! Is juz unfair. Now is either should say HQ CORRUPTED or UNIT CORRUPTED ARRRRHHHHH. N dur to this spf thingy, I told myself to scrub off the idea of becoming a CI liao.. becoz of the corruption! I noe this is also the wish of the CIs… they also had the intention of sending this 2 assholes for D05 as well…. Noticing all this coincidence.. I can really say mark low is e idiot playin all this craps. Is inpossible 4 HQ to hav done it lor…  2nd, is abt my studies. Hated to always score so badly 4 my SS. Let say 4 last wk paper. E way I interpret the ques.. haiz, e SS ques r so hard to interpret. Don tok abt it lar. 3rd, thinking abt my life in sec sch. Teachers r like somehow frenz to mi liao…Smt tok cock one… haha.. Wif Chang, Maggie, my bro (same surname), Cheng, n many more lor… haha… N smt tok to e sch attendants except 4 e gurad whom I dislike 4 quite n number of reasons. Haha… Thinkin abt life in sec sch, is quit of a memories… also of times in the unit except for my 1st mentioned incident.  Now, nth much to comment abt my life. Juz hope tt my life is always a smooth sailing across wad oceans, hahah…. N hope to hear good news abt my Chinese o level results.!  N now, my xanga.com seems to be down n chosed to upload here ba..
