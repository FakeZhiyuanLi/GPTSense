      Ho .. This is one of my favourite song and its composed not by me, but Britney. Some feeling,    "Never look back," we said How was I to know I´d miss you so? Loneliness up ahead Emtiness behind Where do I go?   And you didn´t hear All my joy through my tears All my hopes through my fears Did you know? Still I miss you somehow   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   "Baby," I said, "Please stay Give our love a chance for one more day" We could have worked things out Taking time is what love´s all about   But you put a dart Through my dreams Through my heart And I´m back where I started again Never thought it would end   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   You promised youself But to somebody else And you made it so perfectly clear Still I wish you were here   From the bottom of my broken heart There´s just a thing or two I´d like you to know You were my first love, You were my true love From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, I never knew love ´Til there was you From the bottom of my broken heart   " Never look back" we said How was I to know I´d miss you so?   Bye bye...     Katch you suun with new stuf, later.

        nt-style:italic;">When I turn bac k and look into the past years I can remember few things that remain in my tiny cerebelum/cerebrum(not sure). Among those some are fun, some are sad, some are enjoyable.. and it goes on.  When I am doing my postgraduation, we(my friends and myelf) went for a trip to Bangalore and Kodai. We all had nice time enjoying there. Few snaps  for you here.    Elavarasu, Selvin and myself(from right to left) .....a kind of relaxing.   A part of our group..   Nice huh?!   Later after my PG, I joined for CGI Software Solutions @ chennai. And he is my second employer. There I joined on Feb 2003. Andrew(the tall, honest, spritual man), my ex-boss there. There my team is Nanda, Ravi, Rajen and myself(may be small, but perfect team) done great job. we usually have a fellowship lunch every week.   Andrew comes once ina while from US and will be with us for the 15 to 20 days. Snapshot of one such lunch is here(quite favourite dish....yesssss... its Pizza).     After 6 months Nanda left for another concern, and in the next 6th month I left CGI, and joined in NatureSoft (where I am working now)
