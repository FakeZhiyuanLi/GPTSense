       Why don’t you clarify the rules? – you may think. But once you indicate the rules clearly, it will arouse opposition from those who are against the rule. Japanese people usually think any conflict is of no benefit.  When it comes to democratic process, it must be more desirable to discuss about the rule and try to reach agreement. But some Japanese probably regard this process as waste of time and say, “we’ve done well without them.” Certainly, it seems that we’ve done well, but how about hereafter?  The number of foreigners living in Japan continues increasing. We will have been left them out?

       Why are there many tacit rules in Japan? The principal factor is, I think, homogeneity of Japanese or Japan.  Japanese people don’t like behaving in different manner, for they want to avoid making themselves conspicuous. In a train, for instance, you can always see Japanese people sitting in the same polite manner. In addition, those who live in Japan are mostly Japanese. ( it's anything but tautology.) Race homogeneity is the important feature of Japan.  In short, Japanese want to do as others do, and there are only Japanese in Japan. Therefore tacit rules have worked well. It’s the rules which work only among similar members.

       You have a plenty of opportunities to feel "tacit rules" in Japan. For example, you can see people standing on the left side on every escalator in Tokyo though there are no rule that you must stand on the left. Sometimes you can also see a foreigner standing on the right side of an escalator and others behind him trip on and frown at him. They think he stands on the wrong side.

       Today I watched the movie,  Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior  (  urlLink  マッハ!!!!!!!!   in Japan) . It's not so interesting as I had expected. Compared with  KungFu Soccer  (  urlLink  少林サッカー   in Japan) , it's all the more boring.

        urlLink    Emmanuelle Beart, a famous French actress, is my favorite. Have you ever watched   urlLink Date with an Angel  ? She played the role of an angel in it.

       Do you like talking about food? I'm more indifferent to food than any other people. Of course I like eating but I have no desire to eat good-tasting things so much. It is only nutrition that I care. Above all, I hate talking about food and hearing others talking about such kind of things. I'm quite fed up with talks and TV programs about delicious dishs or cool restaurants!

       Yes, Olympic games. These days everyone talks about it. Therefore I can't help mention it. But unfortunately, I don't like Olympic festival, or rather, people who are excited at it.

       Criticize, denounce and deny - these are totally different. You can criticize me with love. You can denounce me with love. But you never be able to deny me with love. Absolutely not.

       Now I'm listening to "Wishing Well" ( from   urlLink Voices  ) played by  urlLink Mike Stern , famous jazz/fusion guitarist, while remembering a night in New York. I watched him playing at  urlLink 55 bar  in N.Y. this January .

       As usual Saturday, I got up at around 10:00 a.m. and had lunch at my house. Then I went to the English school in Shinjuku. I talked with beautiful woman, she is a teacher from Canada, for 90 minutes there. After that, I went to a McDonald's in front of Seibu-Shinjuku station. It was about 5:00 p.m.

       Who does know the best who you are? Needless to say, it's you. So if you want others to know about yourself, it's you that can do the best presentation about you. It's a matter of course. But in general, Japanese are not good at asserting themselves so much. I'm not, either...maybe. So now, I dare to have a try at declaring:  I can collect proper intelligence and analyze them very well.

       Everyone must have what he/she doesn’t want to remember any more. The more you try to erase such memories, the more vividly they get aroused. It is often said that you can naturally, little by little, forget what you don’t want to remember because your instinct works. But I think it’s not absolutely true. Why do her faces, voices and touches still keep me so annoyed…?

      Today I got a call from an English speaking man at work. I can't tell you what he asked, it's a secret, but I must confess I couldn't receive well. Actually I was not in charge of what he asked, but I wish I could have helped him.

       Go out by JR Shinjuku Station west exit.  urlLink    You'll see the rotary on the underground floor.  urlLink    Take left sidewalk around it to the underground pedestrian mall. Though there are some signs, strangers tend to lose their ways. So take care.  urlLink    If you can get to the underground pedestrian mall, you have only to go straight till Tokyo Metropolitan Government office building(T.M.G.)  urlLink    You can go outside by about 5 minutes walk. Then you'll see Keio Plaza Hotel on your left.  urlLink    200 meters or so further down, you'll reach T.M.G. office building at last.  urlLink

       My favorite artist is  urlLink U2 ."Where The Streets Have No Name","With or Without You","If God Will Send His Angels","Beautiful Day","Walk On","Kite"...These songs are amazing. Especially, " urlLink With or Without You " always makes me moved.  As for composition, it consists of the repeats of only 4 chords : D,A,B,G - very familiar. The bass guitar line is also very simple - the roots of those chords continue in 8/8 time throughout the song. And The Edge's guitar colors the song briliantly. The phrases he plays by using delay effectors are really marvelous! And  urlLink lyrics . It tells me something important.

       I studied philosophy at  urlLink the University of Tokyo  for 3 years. Of course it was too short to study philosophy, or rather, any learning. The academic people continue studying for life. But now I believe that I got something from studying philosophy. It's, so to speak, an attitude. I'll tell you later.

       To tell the truth, I've wanted to work at  urlLink the U.N.  though I'm an officer of  urlLink Tokyo Metropolitan Government  now. But the motive is still vague. I have to seriously ask myself and make it clear what I work at the U.N. for.  Is it for a childish longing for humanity? Or is it for satisfaction of fame or just for self-esteem? Or is it because of passion to help poor people living in developing countries? Or...  Honestly, all these are true answers. But the most important reason is that I want to improve myself. I want to challenge . And if it will be also for others, I become happier. Is this wrong idea?

       I started to work at  urlLink Tokyo Metropolitan Government(T.M.G.)  from this April.  T.M.G. is very large organization. Over 50,000 officers work at T.M.G. And the budget of T.M.G. is approximately $100,000,000,000. It's larger than that of South Korea, India and Switzerland.   urlLink The T.M.G. office building  in Shinjuku where I work everyday is called "Tocho" in Japanese. It's the highest building in Tokyo. Did you watch " urlLink Lost in Translation "? The scenes of the movie are around Tocho.  urlLink

         I'm a local government officer of  urlLink Tokyo Metropolitan Government(T.M.G.) . I'm engaged on government procurement. Let me talk about my career in detail now.  T.M.G. buys hundreds of goods, services, costruction and construction-related services each year. Individual agencies of T.M.G. are authorized to conduct procurements for goods and services valued within certain prices. All higher-valued procuresses for goods are conducted by Bureau of Finance, which I belong to, on behalf of the other agencies. I intermediate between agencies and vendors by appropriate procedure - usually bid.

       I already have an another weblog. On that weblog, I'm musing about novels and philosophy I've read in Japanese. So what am I meaning to do here? Sorry, I'm not sure...  In the beginning, I try to write down some trivial things of my daily life in English. I'm not so good at English that I must practice writing for a while.  Well...O.K. Let's get to it!!
