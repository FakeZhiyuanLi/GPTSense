       the wind is so cooling tonight..... wooZzZ~~.....   A mighty pain to love it is, and 'tis a pain that pain to miss; but of all the pains, the greatest pain is to love, but love in vain,   Spread love everywhere you go: first of all in your own house. Give love to your children, to your wife or husband, to a next door neighbor... Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile, kindness in your warm greeting."-Mother Theresa,   If you love someone, let them go. If they return to you, it was meant to be. If they don't, their love was never yours to begin with  ..."We all want to fall in love. Why? Because that experience makes us feel completely alive. Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our everyday reality is shattered and we are flying into the heavens. It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon. But that doesn't diminish its value. Because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives."  Relationships--of all kinds--are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost.... hahaz... (  ThaTs All FoR tHe NiGhT~^_^) SlEp TiGhT

      Jun & Jen were a pair of young couple...Jun was veri charming &amp; many girls could`t helpfalling in love with him... therefore, he became quite a flirt.As for Jen, she was an ordinary girl with average looks. Although there were quite a number of guys chasing her, jenonly had Jun in her heart.altought She knew that one day Jun would eventually leave her ..she still continued to love him whole heartedly...Jen loves rainy days...she loves playing in the rain, & whenever Jun wanted to join her, she'll always stop him from joinin.Jun then ask her; Why don't you let me join you?Jen replied;Err..er..because i don't want you to fall sick.Jun then ask her again;If playing in the rain will make me fall sick, then why are you still doing it?But each time Jen will always keep quiet & smile at him...Although Jun was`t able to join her, he felt happy. To him, as long as Jen was happy, he'll be happy as well. :)However, nothin last long... Jun soon fell for another girl after two months. He even love the girl more deeply den he love jen One day, while Jun &amp; Jen were having their dinner , Jun told Jen that this would be their last dinnertogether... Jen looked at him. She knew dat this was going to happen, but she choose not to ask any farther...Jun then requested for a break up.. And Jen...she accepted willingly... partly because, she knew...Jun was just like the wind...never stop at any point.That night..it was to be the last time Jun send Jen home.. Jen kept veri quiet...although deep down she wanted to know the reasons but she choose not to ask. Just when Jen was about to step into the lift, Jun stop her. He said:Jen, I'm really sorry that i've let you down. But i'll never forget those days when i see you playing in the rain...those are the most happy &amp; unforgottable memories i had with you After listening to Jun, Jen could't help it but cried..Jun hugged her tightly. He said:Jen, There's one question i wanted to ask you long ago... Why is it everytime when you are playing in the rain, you just would`t allow me to accompany you?Jen was stunned..pausing for a few seconds,Jen replied...Because...Because i don't wish to let you know...I was crying..

      Peter and Tina are sitting in the park doing nothing, but just gazing into the sky, while all their friends are having fun with their beloved half. Tina: I'm so bored. Just wish I have a boyfriend now to spend time with. Peter: I guess we're the only leftovers. We're the only person who isn't with a date now. (both sigh n silence for a while) Tina: I think I have a good idea. Lets play a game Peter: Eh? What game? Tina: Eem..It's quite simple. You be my boyfriend for 100 days and I'll be your girlfriend for 100 days. what do you think? Peter: Oookay..Anyway I don't have any plan for the next few months. Tina: You sound like you aren't looking forward to it at all. Cheer up. Today will be our first day and our first date. Where should we go? Peter: What about a movie? I heard that there is a really great movie in theater now. Tina: Seems like I don't have any better idea than this. Lets move. (went to watch their movies and sent each other home)   Day 2: Peter and Tina went to a concert together, and Peter bought Tina a keychain with a star.   Day 3: They went shopping together for a friend's birthday present. Share an ice-cream together and hugged each other for the first time.   Day 7: Peter drove Tina up onto a mountain and they watch the sunset together. When the night came and the moon glowed, they said sat on the grass gazing at the stars together. A meteor passed by. Tina mumbled something.   Day 25: Spend time at a themepark and got onto rollercoasters, and ate hotdogs and cotton candy. Peter and Tina got in the haunted house and Tina grabbed someone's hand instead of Peter's hand by accident. They laughed together for a while.  Day 67: They drove pass a circus and decided to get in to watch the show. The midget asked Tina to play a part as his assistant in the magic show. Went around to see other entertainments around after the show. Came to a fortune teller and she just said "Treasure every moment from now on" and a tear rolled down the fortune teller's cheek.   Day 84: Tina suggested that they go to the beach. The beach wasn't so crowded that day. They have their first kiss with each other just as the sun is setting.  Day 99: They decided to have a simple day and is deciding to have a walk around the city. They sits down onto a bench.  1:23 pm Tina: I'm thirsty. Lets rest for a while first. Peter: Wait here while I go buy some drinks. What would you like? Tina: Eem...Apple juice will be just fine.  1:43 pm Tina waiting for about 20 minutes and Peter havent return. Then someone walked up to her. Stranger: Is your name Tina? Tina: Yes, and may I help you? Stranger: Justnow down there on the street a drunk driver has crashed into a guy. I think its your friend. Tina ran over to the spot with the stranger and sees Peter lying on the floor with blood over his face and her apple juice still in his hands. The ambulance came and she went to the hospital with Peter. Tina sat outside the emergency room for five and a half hours. The doctor came out, and he sigh.  11:51 pm Doctor: I'm sorry, but we did the best we could. He is still breathing now but God would take him away from us very soon. We found this letter inside his pocket. The doctor hands over the letter to Tina and she goes into the room to see Peter. He look weak but peaceful. Tina read the letter and then she burst into tears. Here is what the letter said:Tina, our 100 days is almost over. I had fun with you during all these days. Although you may be greedy sometimes and less thoughtful, but these all brought happiness into my life. I have realize that you are a really cute girl and blamed myself for never taken the time to knowing that. I have nothing much to ask for, but I just wish that we can be together forever.... ----- haiz... touched ma..??
