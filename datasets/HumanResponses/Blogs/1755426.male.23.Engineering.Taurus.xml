       Wow, what a great (and long) weekend.  I went up to Casper pretty early on Friday (cuz no one has anything for me to do and I was sick of waiting.)  In any case I went and played 9 holes at the country club with Keith and Meg.  Too bad I am so much better than Keith, otherwise it could have been less embarassing for both of us!  Saturday I had a BBQ with a bunch of friends.  Grilled up some roasts and just had a dandy time playing a little monkey ball.  God I love that monkey ball!  Sunday was mostly a family day.  I watched Miracle (the olympic hockey one) and we went to see Shrek 2.  An awesome movie if I do say so myself.  Made me want to go rent the first one again.  Monday was visiting the people I missed the rest of the weekend and driving home.  And it is a long drive home.  But I suppose it isn't 17 hours...so that is ok!  Have a good week everyone.  At least it is a short one.

       One really nice thing about starting my job when I did is that I get a vacation almost right away.  Woohoo!  Memorial day rocks man!  But anyway, I am heading back to my hometown for the long weekend and am really looking forward to some quality time with the couch up there.  Really I should go play some tennis...but no one really does.  Oh I guess Meg, but we gotta learn her first.  Work still blows.  The little bit of work they do give me is sizing poop pipe.  (1) Not difficult (2) Come on, poop pipe.  Feeling better though.  Felt way nasty this morning so I went home a bit early (YAY SICK LEAVE!)    Have a good extended weekend and talk to ya'll Monday!

        Ahhh, so I rented the Return of the King tonight.  Unlike the Matrix movies, which went from pretty cool to mind numbingly stupid, the Lord of the Rings just got better as it went.  All I could do was complain about how much I hated the ending of the first one.  It just kind of ended...so anti climatic. But you know what?  It was all worth it in the end.  Now I just need to convince myself to sit and watch them through from beginning to end one day.  I hope I have too much stuff to do though.  9 hours can make for a long day.  And boy do I mean that.  The damn project I was working on is gone.  So I sit at work taking the meal scrappings from engineers who do have something to do.  I sat from 1 until 5:30 today pretty much staring.  I hate that.  It is this reason that I hated the first few months in Cali.  I can only pray that I get something decent to work on...and soon!  Oh, but my new wok rules!

       The reception started out like most.  The ice sculpture was brimming with shrimp and cocktail sauce.  The cheesedip was covered in walnuts, and the little bubbles were set on the table.  Then I walked by the bar and low and behold the beer was sitting out.  After a couple of those I was feeling fine until a gentleman decided to buy me the biggest shot I had ever seen.  Like 4 shots in one...no longer a shot, but a cup of liquor.    Shot it anyway.  That is when the fun started.  We all drank and just got darn happy.  We danced...a lot, and with everyone.  We asked questions to the grooms parents that should not have been asked (seriously though, how do they feel knowing the deed will be done that night?)  We drank straight from the champagne bottles, we licked the ice sculpture, we danced to more Michael Jackson songs than I even knew had been written. We got older women to dance with us cuz we had danced with both of her daughters (and the trifecta needed to be completed!)   And in the end, we woke up on the couch with a raging headhache.  And it was awesome.  Thanks for a killer time Spence...my sore legs will not soon forget!

       Wow.   Wow wow wow.  What a crazy weekend.  I mean, it started off with a rehearsal dinner on Friday, to which I enjoyed some beer at the elks club.  They were also serving rocky mountain oysters.  I passed.  Then we did the rehearsal, but everyone was late and the people at the church were ticked.  I walked goodly!  Friday night we went to Fat City.  We bowled, but it was all black light with huge TV screens.  Cool, but the computer for keeping track of the bowling sucked.  Who knows how we did.  Saturday we got up and hauled out to the church.  The church, by the way, was very nice.  About 15 miles out of Denver in a field.  We did the normal pre wedding stuff...decorating Spence's car, hiding him from the bride, pushing eachother around on the boards with wheels.  You know.  The wedding was cool I usppose.  I hate to outshine the groom, but there I was!  Oh, and if you just rub shaving cream into your pants for awhile it will go away.  Not wanting to bore everyone with details I am going to save the reception for tomorrow.  It was incredible!    Oh, and I would love to have pictures, but see Keith has his camerae and I have his cord.  Suck.

       My Mom is heading out to the Cayman islands this weekend with a good friend of hers.  Very very spur of the moment kind of trip (my favorite kind.)  They will eat and sunbathe and just do all of those cool things we all want to be able to do.  Can you feel the jealousy?  The Golf swing thing was working tonight for the first time since I have been here.  I actually played about 12 holes of golf.  I still suck, even virtually, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.  I still have not figured out how to put on it though.  it clims you can, but I think it is full of it.  I swung a putter everywhere I could and nothing moved.  Oh well, still cool.  Work is slow right now.  I guess I got spoiled at first with stuff to do.  I spend most of my time talking to the CAD tech and telling her how I want it drawn, when really I could draw it myself and save us both some time.  Oh well, I don't get paid to do CAD.    Out.

        I finally found a Super Walmart out here.  I never found one in California (because they do not have ANY.)    OH...MY...GOD!  I can not believe how much cheaper it is.  It is freaking ridiculous.  It single handedly explained why I gained so much weight in college while being broke.  We ate the worst stuff because we could pay bottom dollar for it.    But in any case, it is just one more thing to like about being back in the Rockies...way cheaper food.  (Oh, their produce sucks ass though, so I will still be heading to the nice places for that.  I can only compromise so much.)

       Wow, what can I say really?  The graduation was nice...both of them.  Then there was a reception after the graduation that was also nice...well they had a keg anyway.  And our party was excellent.  Having the keg just added a whole new dimension to the party.  We played Nintendo for a bit, then a TON of people came over. And pretty much it was like that all night.  People popped in and out up until 5 o'clock when the last drop in showed.  Everyone left and went to bed by 6, but it was still pretty awesome, if not tiring.  So this week I have work and a wedding.  This week will be much more exhausting than last one just because of all the wedding stuff, but it should be fun I suppose.  Hope you had a good one too!

       Well I am headed off to Laramie for the weekend to celebrate the graduation of some friends.    Congrats guys and welcome to the real world.  In my case, the real world meant more time to do stuff, more money to spend, cooler living accomodations, and as many avocados as I could buy.    BTW...for now, the real world beats the hell out of college.  Well the school part at least!

       Wanna know why I am happy to be back in the Rockies?    Tonight I went to the gorcery store to buy some stuff to make my famou (well to me) Mexican Tortilla soup (sans tortillas).  This stuff is the best.  Shredded chicken, tomatoes, lots of cheese and avocado.  Really tasty stuff, and spicy at that...thanks to my friend the jalepeno.   Well after I bought everything I looked down at my recipe and realized I had skipped the jalepeno.  Off I head back into the store to get them.  When I get back into the line the thought occurs to me that I am going to have to pay for these 2 jalepenos with my credit card...no cash.  I get up there and the guy says 20 cents.  I looked at him and hung my head in shame as I slid my card through the reader.  Right then the guy standing behind me said, "Throw it on mine."    Look, it may be just be 20 cents, but it made me feel good.  Thanks man!

       Oh yeah, been putting that wasabi I got on everything.  Eggs, burgers, salads.  Pretty much everything but icecream...and I considered it.  I got that dickhole from Colorado Springs to finally cough up all the money (well most of it) that he owes me.  Good thing too.  I didn't want to come down there and shove that wasabi in various regions.  That's some hot stuff there boy!

       So I decided I needed to give my new cookbook a try.  When we were at the Chinese restaurant this weekend we watched them serve lettuce leaves with a crumbly meat filling that people spooned into the lettuce, rolled and ate.     Well it just so happens that my new book has those in it.  I have never shopped so much in the specialty Asian section in my life.  I mean I bought some stuff called fish sauce.  Surprisingly it does not smell fishy!  Spicy Thai peppers and lots of fresh herbs round it out.  The verdict?  Pretty darn good...could have been spicier.  But very very simple to make, once you find all the stuff.    Which brings me to my very first "I miss California" item.  I miss the selection of produce in California.  It was kinda pricey but it was all perfect.  Not a blemish or rotting piece of produce in the place.  And the selection...ohhh the selection.  You never ever had to worry about finding stuff.    On another note...God its great to be out here.

        We totally did the Denver mall thing today.  We did Colorado Mills (my personal fav) and Park Meadows (like 3 times).  I got a couple of cool things...my favorite being a cookbook by Nigella Lawson.  This woman is of the Gods.  She is on Style network and just makes the coolest things.  Stoked about that.  For dinner we went to PF Changs, an incredible chinese bistro.  I loved it and my Mom loved it, and my Grandpa likes to eat.  Everyone else was satisfied I suppose.  Too picky of eaters.  Expand your palette people!!!  My sis got me a smaller coffee maker, which is cool cuz I never need the big one that I have, and my mom got me a cool meat/oven thermometer like Alton Brown uses!  She also got me a cool grater thing that is wicked sharp.  All in all a good day...oh, and I got a lot to talk about the pool area tomorrow.  What a sight that was!

        After my burning incidents yesterday with the grill, I thought it best to try something not cooked.  Welcome sushi!  I grew very fond of sushi while I was in California.  Once I got over the initial shock of raw fish, it truly was excellent stuff.  And Wasabi is of the gods!!!  I journeyed down to my local sushi place ( I have been trying to tell you I live in a stupid ritzy area.)  There, while being severely underdressed, I was seated at the bar.  The lady was very nice and gave me a menu of way overpriced raw fish, but I felt I should at least give it a try.  Then she gave me a dinner salad and some chopstiocks.  Intersting, never done that before, but it worked.  Sushi was good, but here was the interesting part.  There were 2 guys sitting next to me exchanging stories about parties and stuff.  One was telling this story about how he hooked up with this concierge of a hotel he was staying at in Paris.  They did the nasty and he woke up the next morning to find all his credit cards and cellphone stolen.  Apparently he chased her down all day long and eventually had her arrested.  I need stories like this!!!  This went on forver.  It was great, remind me to tellyou the full story sometime.

        I decided to give the grill they have for the community a try tonight.  I made up my best hamburgers (nice flat patties, kosher salt on both sides and a generous amount of pepper) and headed out.    K, first things first...unlike my grill apparently there is no red button thingy to push to light it up.  So back I ran up to the apartment to get matches.  When I got back I realized I had not turned the gas off.  Not caring I tossed a match in anyway.  WHOOF!  No worries, I still have most of my eyebrows.    Alright, now it is time to cook.  High heat on all of 'em.  Crap, one of them is for the smoker.  Wow, it has a smoker!  Crap, it is smoking!  Alright, got that turned off.  Now I just have to wait half an hour for the damn thing to get hot.  Finally hot.  Now to make a really good burger you need the good stuff...at least 15% fat! Fat burns and makes more smoke.  Windows start closing around me.    Burgers?  They were great!

       God I love mint tea...yum!     Second day of work was a lot longer than the first, but that was because it was about 3 hours longer than the first in actual time.  Too bad they didn't have a good reason to send me home early today.    I got to work on my new project...a highrise apartment complex in Wisconsin.  A pretty cool place actually.  I like all the sheets cuz they are like "Floors 4-16."  Meaning I only have to do it once then copy it about a dozen times after that.  The bums still haven't given me a computer though, so I have had to actually focus and work ;)    It is also quickly becoming summer down here.  But nothing like Sactown...95 today...suckers!

       So today was my first day at the new office.  I gotta say that it was at least interesting.  I get there and my boss is surprised that I came in at 9 instead of 7:30.  Well come on, I was told like 10 times to come in at 9.  Then he walks me back to my new cube, and I am stoked because I got one with a window...the one I actually asked for during the interview.  He then tells me that I will actually be working with another team for a couple of months on some big apartment complex, so I won't get to sit there till that is done.  Kinda blows, but oh well.   The coolest part was talking to Ken on the video.  That was way way cool!  They put Ken and I through all of the benefits and company stuff at the same time through the video thing (Ken is in Grand Junction now.)  We did the normal crap and signed about a million different forms.  I now know very well my address and phone number.    Afterwards they told me taht they didn't have my new desk setup yet, so to just go ahead and go home.  You don't have to tell me twice.

       Guess what?  After a long long delay I have returned to the blogging scene.    In the time since we last chatted I packed all my stuff up in California, put it on a semi (which got here almost a week after I did) and drove out to Wyoming.  I proceeded to hang out in Laramie for several days with my kickin friends, just having a good time.  Then I ran up to Casper to hang with the family for a day, then back to Laramie to take care of some business.   I have found a new apartment in Denver which is far too nice a place for the likes of me, and I have gotten all but completely setup now.  I mean, I have a washer and dryer now!  I think that means I am all grown up!  In any case, the move went great!  I had the help of a lot of great friends and family.  I cannot tell you how great it is to have the kind of support I was used to having my whole life back again.  I am so happy to be back here that I just kinda walk around with a skip in my step all the time.  I even start work tomorrow and am really not nervous about it at all.  It will be work, just like before.    Oh, one more thing...you like the design?

       How are you guys doing?  Holding in there alright?  Enjoying your summer?  Good, good to hear it.  Hot where you are?  Not here, got hot for about a week and never really has gone back.  What's that?  You got married?  Wow, you and everyone else I know.  Oh I know, tell me about it.  You mean you got another wedding invite in the mail this week as well?  Yup, I suppose another trip to Crate and Barrel is in order.  You don't say!?!?!  You know a guy who is getting on a fishing boat for 9 months in Alaska as well?  And he hasn't even told you when he is leaving?  GET OUT!  Wow, well I hope he has a good time...or at least makes some money.  Well have a good summer and all.  Yeah?  Yeah, I hope to get out and camp too, but then again I say that every year.  Good luck with that.   This random and absurd post brought to you by Nick

       I just grilled up a $15 steak and some asparagus and it is the most divine thing I think I have ever tasted in my life.  I also made a couple of friends while I was down there grilling.  They were making some ribs...I should have been jealous, but then again I did have an enourmous steak.  Funny, they recommended that I go to Tony's Gourmet Market to get a steak.  Funny, I totally did get it there.   I also got up and went and saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  Now I will admit that this was toally set up to let Michal Moore's viewpoint come through, but there truly were some interesting moments in the movie that are, quite frankly, irrefutable.  Watching Bush sit there for 7 minutes after he was told about the terrorist attack was simply amazing.    They also showed a lot of the charred remains of people, and the hanging from the bridge, and a beheading.  Definitley not for the lighthearted...but at the same time very though provoking.  I feel about the same after this as I did Bowling for Columbine (his previous flick).  A good, very well told and orchestrated movie that provoked thought.  Obviously there is another huge side to the story, but this got the wheels spinnin.  I wonder how/if it will affect the election.

       (It was Excellent)  I had a wonderful time on my date.  We ended up going to dinner because she didn't hook up with her parents.  She drove down to the tech center (she insisted) and we got a bite.  It was really early though...like about 4 that we got together.  Then we had dinner and came back to my place and hung out for a few hours.  A good time was had by all.   I also had a very nice time with Spence and Jenny.  We went to a wine tasting in downtown Ft. Collins.  It was really interesting.  You select what type of wine you want, then you buy the grapes to make it. 8 weeks later you come back and bottle it and label it...then take it home.  Very intersting, and a bit expensive!  We then just kind of hung out and enjoyed ourselves, talking about old drunk Spencer days.  The somersaults, the superman, the races against no one.    Today I am going to go see Fahrenheit 9/11...that new documentary by the guy who did Bowling for Columbine.  I have have heard some interesting things, so I will tell you how it goes.  Next weekend is a THREE DAY WEEKEND!!!  YAY!

       This weekend should be really good.  Tonight I am heading to Ft. Collins to hang with Spence and the new wife.  We are going to a wine tasting somewhere there in town.  Then I am going to go stay with them and maybe have a drink or two.   Saturday not much is going on...well except I have a date!  A true to life, real girl is going to spend time with me without me having to pay her any money!  I actually have a real live Saturday night date.  I have heard of these things before, seen it in the movies and such, but I was always convinced that it was one of these fables people like to tell so much.    Holy schnickles!  Too bad I don't look like the guy in the pic (unless there are ladies reading this...then I totally do.)

       Sorry for the lack of/crappy posts that I have had this week.  I suck, I know.  There just hasn't been a ton of stuff to talk about.  Work was very very busy until this morning, and now I've nothing to do (as you can tell since I am writing this in the afternoon.)  I did, however, move to my new cube today.  It is sooo much better.  No one preying their eyes right behind be all livin day long.  That and I don't have to sit with the "Bobs" anymore.  Thank God!  Today we even had an icecream social at work.  Ahhh, so much fun to hang out with all my fellow employees while eating.  Just make this day end!!!  Still talking to the girl, we will see where it goes.

       Not really, but wouldn't it be cool if I had spent the whole day at the fair riding the merry-go-round and eating blue (not pink) cotton candy all day long.  Yeah, my sugar high would be crashin right about now I think.  Nothing much to report today kids.  It's still damn cold and stuff.  Work was good for a change today.  Good work with good people.  Can't ask for much more.    More tomorrow.

       Friday I did not end up doing much, but that is okay because the rest of the weekend was packed.  Meg and Keith came down and we went to go see Goodnight Gracie, a play about Geroge Burns' life.  It was a one man play and was frankly fantastic.  He kept me interested and laughing through almost the entire thing.  A true pleasure.  Sunday saw me hooking up with my Dad in Longmont after my friends had left.  It was nice too.  I am never one to pass up on Johnny Carinos.  We had a good time though, talked about stuff.  I got to see the little kids for the first time in quite some time and they are getting less little very single time that I see them.    Well the sun came out too...just a few minutes later than I would have liked.  Allin all a very nice weekend.  Not looking forward to work, but hey you keep reading and tell me when I am.  Have a good week ya'll.

       It has been raining here for like 4 days straight now.  I am starting to forget what the sun looks like.  Don't get me wrong, I like rainy days as much as the next guy, but dang!  Also Denver gets a lot of hail.  Kinda fun to watch actually.  I cannot believe I am saying this, but I might actually turn the heat on tonight.  It's freakin cold!  Got off work nice and early today so I went to my favorite gourmet store and bought some deliciousness.  Also I cooked a lemon and garlic roasted chicken with a thyme white wine sauce.  Yum!       Things are going really well right now, even though I seem to miss typing now and then.  Nothing going on for me tonight, but that is ok I suppose.  The rest of my weekend should be full of stuff.  Meg and Keith are coming down tomorrow and we are going to a play, then on Sunday I am going to go meet my Dad and the kids for dinner on Father's Day.    Weird.

       No post last night cuz there wasn't much to post about.  I watched 50 First Dates (funny, but not too funny) and watched the simple life and Reno 911.  See, I told you nothing to talk about.  The rain has been really awesome though.  It actually got cold for most of the day...colder than it EVER was in Sacramento...and this is already mid-June.  Busy day at work so I should go.  Talk to ya'll later though.

       Yup, so tonight I drove up to Ft. Collins to meet Meg and her friend for some dinner and chillin.  I walked further into a Victoria's Secrets than I ever have in my life.  And guess what?  They totally do look at ytou when you walk in as if to say "Ummm, so do you like have a girlfriend or what?"    We went to this soup and salad bar place.  It was good, and they let you put pepperoni on your salad.  Ohhhh pepperoni!  Then they had other good stuff.  Nice conversation though.  Meg's friend was a newly graduated engineer, so I felt the need to let her in on all my secrets that I have come across since working.  Secrets like not lying about what you know, cuz then you have to do it anyway and you look like an ass.  Well anyway, quite busy on a project right now...so the week has been flying.  I hope it keeps up.  Sleep well (yeah, so most of you are awake and it is morning...but maybe a nap would be great for you right now.  Just think about it...a nap right there on your desk!)

       I had another stupendous weekend!  I just wish it didn't meean me driving so much to do it.  I got to do a nice car ride with Meg, and see Josh and Kyle and good ole Keith.  My mother even bought me a nice meal.  Oh and we got to run through pages on Mario Party.  Man that is just like the coolest mini-game in the whole world.  The wedding was good...as far as weddings go.  Tons of people, but short everything else.  In fact the head table didn't even get touched it went by so fast!  Then I got to try Popey's chicken for the first time since Taiwan.  Oh...My...God!  That is some good southern spicy chicken!  And the gravy was frickin good.    Oh, and I also got a new watch this weekend from my grandparents.  It is awesome!  It has Pinnochio from Shrek and even glows in the dark.  I mean even the watch band has Pinnochio on it.  I don't know which cereal box this came from, but my suspicions are Frosted Flakes or Frosted Mini-Wheats.

       It seems that once a year or so I go into a phase where I do nothing.  Sure I go to work, and get dressed and take a shower...you know...stuff.  But the rest of the time?  Nothing.  Not a darn thing.   I always know it is bad when I myself stop finding humor in how lazy I have been.  Just today as I rounded my third hour of TV I started to consider what I would do instead.  What can I do instead of laying around?  And you know what?  I don't have the faintest.  I am afraid it would become sitting at the computer all night.    And so it is this...my challenge.  I shall not, starting tomorrow morning, turn on my TV for a week.  I know, I expect to go through heavy withdrawals, and having a new lazy boy won't make it any easier. I just need to know what else I would do.    Updates will come for the next week, with next Thursday night culminating with a celebration by...uhm...well I am sure I can reward myself somehow.   Think I can do it?  Want to join me?

       ...as plopping down on that new leather recliner for the very first time.  I mean, you just know right away that your ass is going to love you for the rest of your life when you take that first sit.  Ohhhh, and when it reclines...   Simply no pleasure so sweet.  I am sorry, but this thing beats the hell out of the broken $90 Kmart special I had for so long.    AND it fit into my car.  Amazing.  I even put the back of the chair on myself.  Talk about being a handy man!

       Well I didn't manage to do a whole lot this weekend.  In the end I suppose I should have gone up to Casper, but I am heading up there next week and definitley for the Fourth of July.  Come, it's a long drive...give me a break.   I did manage to buy a lot of stuff for the place though.  I accidentally went garage saling (is that a word) and found some end tables and a cool wine rack.  I also managed to go see Harry Potter (felt like a pedophile) and go to a gourmet food store.  Oh, and just cuz I hadn't spent enough money...I went and bought a LA-Z-Boy.  Yeah, I suck.  I know.  It was a good deal though...that is at least what I told myself.  I get to go get it on Tuesday and they insist they can take the back off and it will fit in my car.  I suppose we will see!

       Man it is really getting warm tonight.  I got windows open, fans ablazin'.  still not turning on the AC though.  Screw that.  Mechanical Air systems are for loser anyway.  Still nuttin' to do at work...so I built a killer spreadsheet that almost does what I want it to do!  So in other words I spent a whole day on it and it is still useless.  Sigh.  Not looking like much is going on this weekend.  I will definitley see Harry Potter at some point during the weekend.  Gotta love that stuff.  Tomorrow is a wicked short day, so I spec I am gonna go check out all of these gourmet stores I found on the net today.  See if I can't find me a truffle and try it out.  Always wanted to do that (read "always" as being since I got into cooking a few years ago.)  Have a good weekend.  I might write more, I might not.  Be good anyway chillins.

       So I finally got to see Monster starring Charlize Theron.  Wow, amazingly there is a way that Charlize can be unattractive.  All you have to do is give her an guly mask, make her gain some weight then start killing away.    A really interesting movie though.  I can really see why she won the acadamy award.  For once I really do think they made the right choice.  The movie just kind of keeps you hung tight.  I mean I put off eating some icecream cuz I didn't want to pause it and mess up the feel.  Some meeting we had at work this week kinda gave me the spooks (I really have nothing to worry about, but you know me) so I started to look at culinary schools in the area.  I got on one site and asked them to send me some information.  Wow, they really take you serious when you ask that.  I got calls, and they are sending me a book.  If nothing else it would be intersting just to see.  But I kind of doubt it.  A mere $351 per credit hour, and with only a measly 192 credit hours I am sure it would be nice and cheap for me.  hmm, if only...

       Tonight I got the worst craving for some sushi.&nbsp; Like really really bad.&nbsp; And the stuff they try and pawn off as sushi at King Soopers was not going to cut it this time.    I went to a sushi place just a couple of blocks from where I live.&nbsp; I popped in here once before, but got a little sticker shock and barely ate anything.&nbsp; This time I was prepared for how much good sushi was going to run me.&nbsp; I got the White Tuna Shashimi, a spicy tuna roll (2 really), and some edemame (beans...yummy!)   Oh, I also tried to get some hot saki.&nbsp; What I got was a beer called "Asahi."&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp; Good, but crap.&nbsp; I love sitting at the bar and looking at all the colorful ingredients and wondering what they are.&nbsp; There are a lot of different kinds of fish eggs (I got some flying fish fish eggs!)&nbsp; There is the block of something egg yellow, but couldn't possibly be egg.&nbsp; Tons of very fresh looking things.&nbsp; I watched them make a spider roll (soft shell crab) and watched as they put the little guys claw hanging out of the last roll.&nbsp; Very creative, and made me wanna puke.   But the nice thing was this.&nbsp; I sat there long enough that they just started giving me stuff.&nbsp; "Here, would you like to try house special?"&nbsp; "Don't mind if I do."&nbsp; It was pretty much every fish and sea creature they had behind the bar rolled up into one big fat roll.&nbsp; It was...ummm...well I ate it.&nbsp;   All in all, excellent and almost worht the $30 I threw down.&nbsp; Have a good weekend kids and see you all Sunday night.

       Back in the day I used to have a little site called  urlLink Cooking for Losers. &nbsp; The site was great, and even posted one of my recipies.&nbsp; But then one day, the recipes stopped.&nbsp; Well it looks like it is moving again so I bring you how something can be made to sound difficult, and how it can be made to sound easy.&nbsp; In the end...both pretty much the same.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp;     Hard way to eat pig...     BBQ Pork Chardonnay     1 (10 1/2 pound)  wild pig , cleaned 6 to 10 garlic cloves, sliced 6 to 10 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 cup olive oil, to rub 1 cup Italian seasoning 1 bottle sweet Chardonnay wine Spray bottle Salt and pepper .  Score the meat with a sharp knife about 1-inch deep. Push a slice of garlic and a sprig of rosemary into the sliced areas. Rub the entire roast with olive oil to coat. Shake on the Italian seasoning covering the entire roast.  On a hot charcoal or  wood BBQ , place the meat on a rotisserie or on the grill.  A dry, oak, wood base  is the best. Put your sweet Chardonnay in the spray bottle and spray the meat every 10 minutes as it cooks. Char the outside of the roast, and the inside will cook.  Turn the meat every 20 minutes if not on a  rotisserie.  Cook the 10 1/2 pound roast for 2 1/2 hours.   EASY WAY      crockpot bbq pork      1.  your creepy uncle  dug a rust-orange crockpot circa 1973 out of your grandfather's garage and gave it to you. make your husband (substitute boyfriend, manfriend or self) clean it for you. 2. take  a big chunk  of pork roast and cut it up. put it in the crockpot. 3. pour an entire bottle of bbq sauce over it.  i don't care what kind, but you might . 4. cook on low for 8 hours. 5. spoon the porkout and shred it up with two forks. 6. consume over toasted white bread.      &nbsp;   See, and in the end you are both eating yummy pork.&nbsp; Sometimes I like it when people take the no nonsense, easy way.&nbsp; Cuz frankly, I have made the crockpot way and it was fantastic.

       Yeah, either that or myself.&nbsp; I wrote up this cool post showing off all the cool things that blogger can do now.&nbsp; Change colors and fonts and all other sorts of nifty little things that I could never do before.  And what did it all amount to?&nbsp; My site crashed and burned.&nbsp; Hard.&nbsp; Been working on it most of the night to revive it.&nbsp; But no frets, it made it back alive...eventually.&nbsp; No more playing with things I don't understand.&nbsp; Even if it is built so Joe Blow can use it.  I have come to the conclusion that with all my friends getting married, others having babies, and still others just becoming all grown up, it is time for me to be the immature one.&nbsp; One day my mail-order bride will come from Russia and I will have to settle down, but for now I need to be the guy whom the friend's say "Did you hear what Nick did?"&nbsp; as they sit down to their family meal.&nbsp;   Well guess what Nick did?&nbsp; Ummm, crap nothing.&nbsp; But something is totally gonna happen!&nbsp; You just wait.

       Well too freakin' bad!&nbsp; What, you think I can just put on a show day in day out of every minute of my life???&nbsp; You think that I can just sit down at this computer and just come up with "Bitch made me waffles." on a regular basis?  Well think again.&nbsp; Blogging does not mean that just on the spur of the moment I can have things like "I love scotch, scotch scotch scotch." come bursting forth from my menial task head.&nbsp; Oh no, you have to work at it.&nbsp; You have to try hard to bring the funny.&nbsp; Sure anyone can spew out "I have a face like a elephant's behind." and feel good about themselves.&nbsp; But it takes talent to come up with notions like "The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I'll never be as good as a wall."   So stop with the pressure.&nbsp; It may take weeks to say something as funny as "I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."&nbsp; So stick with me on this one.&nbsp; The funny is coming...but first, I gotta go to work.

Work should be okay this week.&nbsp; My deadline got pushed back yet again...so no worries there.&nbsp; Just a lot of pipe crap and crap pipe.  Have good'ns and I will do my damndest to write something funny tomorrow!!!   &nbsp;

       Well I am back on the blogging scene.&nbsp; Sorry, totally tired last night and nothing to talk about anyway.&nbsp; Tonight I hooked up with Spencer and Jenny, and they took me out to dinner at Magiano's...a very good italian restaurant.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it is a chain though, so not as special as it could be.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wine was very good though and it was one of the few times that I had bleu cheese and liked it.&nbsp; Very creamy and just happy, without the wrotten cheese feel that I normally get from it.  Work has been going well.&nbsp; My boss busted a contractor today trying to get a freebie out of the owner.&nbsp; It is stuff like that that really is the purpose of us being engineers...to not let the contractor screw over the owner.&nbsp; Anyway, it was pretty exciting to bust him on it...the contractor sunk his head low and walked away from it.&nbsp;   I just found out Pat is pregnant, well the wife anyway...I think.&nbsp; Big congrats on that.&nbsp; Sorry the phone died!&nbsp; Wow, I suppose after all these weddings that have been going on that is the next thing to start happening.  Wow, that's weirder than the weddings.&nbsp; Speaking of which, off to Casper for another one this weekend...so have a good weekend peeps!

       Why is it that when I watch a movie...and this is most every movie...I sympathize with the main character so well that I myself end up feeling like they do for the rest of the evening.  Case in point.&nbsp; Tonight I watched The Secret Window, a thriller about a man driven mad by his wife cheating on him.&nbsp; I watch the movie.&nbsp; The man goes insane.&nbsp; I finish the movie, and I sit there thinking what a terrible person I am for doing what he did.&nbsp; What the hell!?!&nbsp; Frankly my dear, I think I'm losing it.  Anyway, ok flick.&nbsp; Worth renting or getting on Netflix.&nbsp; I find myself already yearning for the weekend.&nbsp; I suppose the days at work are going by quickly, so I will keep the complaining to a minimum.&nbsp;   Take care yo.

       You are at the right site, I just felt like changing the template again.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Blogger has been coming out with some real stellar templates that just look super keen, so I figured I would play with it some. &nbsp; Nothing new and cool to report...but enjoy the new site, check out the profile (which is pretty much just my pic right now) and click all the links.&nbsp; All Nick approved.

       Another really great, and very interesting weekend.&nbsp; I ended up hooking up with my friend Nate in Ft. Collins.&nbsp; He was waiting for a friend of his to get off work, and I was feeling bad for dogging him so I went up.&nbsp; Then some stuff happened, one thing lead to another, and I never made it back to Denver that night as was planned.  &nbsp;  The next morning I gathered my things...ummm, my cell phone...and left for Laramie...in the same clothes.&nbsp; I go there pretty early so I had time to nap a little (and watch Bob Ross make a painting with that gigantic fro).&nbsp; Then we went to Altitudes.&nbsp; It's fine but it never really has done much for me.&nbsp; Then off to camping.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We didn't go to Happy Jack this time.&nbsp; We decided (I did) that we should try the Snowies instead.&nbsp; It was actually great.&nbsp; We found a nice secluded spot with a couple of firepits already made and started gathering wood.&nbsp; After almost killing a friend of mine with a tree I had stood up on end then dropped, we started the most amazing fire.&nbsp; Putting a whole stump in a fire will make it big!!!&nbsp; Anyway, we had dogs and just stayed up and laughed the goodtimes away.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today I drove back to Denver after hanging in Laramie a bit.&nbsp; Same clothes I put on Friday morning for work...and 3 days worth of great weekend smell on them as well.

        Now to start off, I am in no way saying this is one of those life changing decisions.&nbsp; One of those that keeps you up at night.&nbsp; Not like "Should I move to Denver or not."  &nbsp;  No, this is more like, I made plans with a friend weeks ago to get together in Denver.&nbsp; No big plans with it, just time to hang out in the big city and have a good time.&nbsp; My friend lives in Laramie, and I am hoping we will get to hang out quite a bit before he graduates.&nbsp; Anyway he called me up Tuesday to confirm.  &nbsp;  Wednesday I get a call from "my group."&nbsp; The group I have been friends with since back in the day.&nbsp; The group that loses contact for a year at a time, then comes back together like we went to the bars last night.&nbsp; They want to go camping...but up in Casper.&nbsp; Sick of driving to Casper I politely decline.&nbsp; I have plans anyway.&nbsp; But then they decide to move it to Laramie.&nbsp; Understand 3 of these people are not going to be here at all for at least a good 9 months when the summer is out...and some it may be years before I see them again.&nbsp; But how to tell somone that you would rather hangout with your other friends?&nbsp; Especially when the plans have been solid for weeks.  &nbsp;  You find a way to do both.&nbsp; Denver Friday, camping Saturday.&nbsp; And the goodtimes keep on rollin'  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        So I checked out my stats for my little, boring, nonsense site this evening...and apparently there are more people out there who read this than I thought.  Hi to whomever reads from New York most days, and I mustn't forget you out there in Huntington Beach, CA...or San Jose for that matter.  And the one in Albuquerque has been here since the first post.  Morning bro!  Howdy to all you cool readers in Laramie, and I personally know most of the Casper ones.  I really have no idea who is reading up in Wheatland, but you too deserve a special shoutout.  And I would give my left leg to know who read the blog from Bosler Wyoming.  Yeah, Bosler.    Maybe it is the guy who hid in the school out there with his son for months...or perhaps the bar that always has broken down trucks out front.  Heck, my hope is that whoever lives in that little white house with cars in front that look like they could actually move.  It's funny, you get in a zone where you think that you are the only one reading it.  Guess I should try to start writing something interesting before you all run off!

       I have had the worst time focusing at work this week.  I know what I need to be doing, I have work, but getting on the ball has been tough for some reason.  I am starting to think it is just the summer mentality.  I am not really, nor have I ever been, a big outdoors person, but there is something about when it heats up outside that my mind is still programmed to relax.  I think that I need the cold of winter to numb my head enough to close out all those thoughts of doing something cool.  Frankly I need a really crappy weekend to make work seem a little less crappy...by comparison anyway.  Lately I have been nothing but spoiled almost every single weekend.  I have done something awesome.  This weekend for instance my friend Nate is coming down and we are gonna have a good time, maybe go to warped tour.  The following, back to Casper for a good friend of mine's wedding.  Following, a camping trip with my best friends.    And then now, at least I think...labor day weekend I am off to Pennsylvania with Meg to go to a wedding.  Hell, I've never even been to the east.   Poor poor Nick.

       I got the new Tiger Woods golf game.  I rodered it Friday and it showed up in the mail today!  Sweet!  Positive feedback for that dude.    Work was very frustrating.  I have found that even though I like my new team that I am on, my new boss (understand there are like 7 levels of boss) can be very unhelpful.  Smart guy, just not one to jump in and point out things to me.  Oh well, maybe it is just a lack of brown nosing on my part.

       Seriously, I need to slow down on the whole awesome weekend thing, or work is just going to start looking more and more drab every single week.  Friday I went and got some stuff for the apartment.  A new plant and some other decorating things.  Then I dealt with the whole AIG thing (grrrrr!).  But Saturday Keith and Meg came up and we went to the Natural History Museum here in Denver.  The planetarium there was wicked, and the Bugs IMAX was pretty cool as well.  I just love that place anyway.   After that we went to PF Changs (my favorite) and then got dressed for Dave and Busters.  D&B is an awesome place!  I don't know the last time I played so many arcade games...and for $10, no guilt!  Sunday was off to Cherry Creek to look at a bunch of stuff I can't afford, but would love to own.  Then they took off and I went to see Anchorman.  Will Ferrel is a God!  Hope you guys had good ones too!

       So I got paid today.  YAY!  I decided this afternoon that I should probably go pay for my car bill and my car insurance since they are both due in a few days.  No big whup.  I get online, pay my car bill and push send.  No probs.   I recently changed my insurance to living in Colorado...you know, since I live there now.  I hop onto my exact same service that I had in California only to find the amount I owed was $2828!  My premium in Cali was $770 for 6 months!!!  I called them up and they told me that since I moved out of California the 20% discount for good driving was gone.  Also apparently I am more likely to get in a traffic accident out here.  Apparently  4 F-ING TIMES MORE LIKELY !  "Cancel it...cancel it now."  "I am sure we can find something..." "No, cancel it NOW!"  AIG...go to hell.

        What a crock of shit.  Two 12 hour days in a row just does not sit well with Mr. Nick.  I know, I am probably preaching to a crowd who has been there before...but that it sucks royally.  I mean, it is one thing when you are working on a job and it has to be sent out the next day and there is just a lot to do you haven't gotten to yet.  It is another when it is someone elses screw-up that makes it happen.  so yeah...shit!  Wendy's Chicken Nuggets - Oh how I adore thee.  With your tender white meet and flavorful batter fried till golden brown.  (I would go on, but it gets a bit personal.)  My boss called the outside consultants (the ones to make the working place better and more efficient) the "Bobs" today.  See, even they know.  hmmm, how to finish?  ummm, GO POKES...or something.

        Man, the stuff is just everywhere and I cannot stop myself from getting in on the rawfish action.  lol.   I started playing my new guitar today.  Did you know those things give you blisters on the end of your fingers?  Who knew that playing a guitar could be hazardous to my soft supple hands???  I find myself staring at that human clock for like 20 minutes at a time at work.  I think I should get a camera and do something creative too...but then again that would probably mean leaving the apartment.    Far too scary.

       Hey, I will be happy to tell everyone about my weekend very soon, though I think most of you who read this were probably there.  I just want everyone to know that I have retired the  urlLink Mad Pony  link.  I loved the girls and they put up really cool posts...oh and they weren't that bad on the eyes either.  But they have stopped posting so now I bring you.........  ....... urlLink Human clock!!!   This thing is simply amazing.  Some guy has a picture of every minute of the day of people or animals or just objects showing the time.  I can watch it forever.  So be sure to check it out right below Meg's Blog and Alex the girl.  Tres' chic!

        So I decided to go ahead and take tomorrow off.  I mean, it isn't very often that I can get a 4 day weekend while only burning 4 hours of vacation, so I figured why not.  Tonight I will head up to Laramie and watch Spiderman with some friends...WOOHOO!  Then on Frriday morning sometime I want to make it back to Casper to hopefully hook up with some other friends of mine there.  I will be up early all weekend though because wWimbledon finals are going on.  If history says anything, its that I will get up to watch it and fall asleep through most ot the match.  Hopefully a barbecue, fireworks...blah blah blah.    Interesting though, this is the first weekend from Sacramento that I truly remember what I did.  I sat around playing Nintendo with Ken all day and we made steaks.  Wow, what a couple of winners we were.  In any case, I hope everyone has a nice 4th and that I get to see many of you while I am home.  See you soon!

       I know, it's been awhile...sorry about that.  This one tonight is gonna be brief too.  I've been staying up way too late talking to various people's and just cannot seem to get off the phone.  Thank God for free Verizon minutes or I would be so screwed right now.  Work is fine, everything else is fine.  I am just really looking forward to seeing Chicago and watching the opening ceremonies for the Olympics.    Tune in tomorrow.  I'll give you all a nice upadate before the weekend.

        ...so I filled it with other things.  I can't imagine what it must have been like to work 10 or 15 years ago when you ran out of things to do.  What did you do?  Certainly not look stuff up on the internet for no particular reason.  Tonight I watched the sushi battle of Iron Chef.  My conclusion?  Making sushi still looks really hard.  Now you don't have to go and eat rawfish to eat sushi, but just making the stupid rice looks incredibly difficult...that is why I think I should try it.  Not sure when, but certainly soon.  Anyway, it seems like I have a new friend in the blogging world, so check out Madiecat on my favorite blogs to the right there.  Just starting on it, but I think it will end up well.  Yeah, so maybe I will try to say something interesting tomorrow.  You never know!

       Well, maybe not.  Really not a bad one either.  Just a weekend I suppose.  Friday I got to hook up with Ken and his fiancee' and went out to PF Changs (YUM!)  That was nice, and it gave me a good reason to pick the place up.  Saturday I spent most of the day at a car dealership test-driving cars and letting the salesman think he had sold me something.  I almost did buy a car, but I think it is just best to let my current one die on me somewhere random on the highway before I get too frantic!  Oh well, these things happen.  Really not sure about the week this week.  The past few weeks have just been frantic, but this one may be the exact opposite.  Studying for my test (that I have to take by Friday) and just being coolkid Nick.   Hope ya'll had good ones.

       Yup, it was one year ago today that I jumped onto the blog scene.  Most people don't last more than 2 or 3 months, but today my friends, the journey has gotten us to one year!   I've had some great posts (Dear Wendy's, Trips to Tahoe, The Pumpkins!) and some nnot so great ones (work sucks, work is hard, I am tired...).  But its all good stuff to me.  In fact, I know of only one person who has been reading since day 1.  Well some people read day one and were turned off by it (me complaining about how html is hard) but eventually I got them to come back.   So I think this is cause for celebration!  Ken and his fiance are coming to Denver tonight and we are gonna hit up PF Changs (even have a reservation).  Tomorrow I am probably going car hunting...not a pleasant experience, but not awful either.  So anyway, have a great weekend and remember to drink a beer for the blog!!!

       So here I am at work, waiting for a whole slew of selections to come from the vendor guy.  You see when someone was checking my work today they found a very serious error that had to be fixed.  My fault???  Of course not.  Well, a little for heading the advice of an upper level without questioning the logic.   So here I sit, waiting at my computer to work the whole night away.  By the end of the night I won't even have to come in tomorrow or Friday, though I will.  All I can hope is that someone noticed.  The lady checking my stuff said she has been very impressed with my work, aside from the fact that it is mostly wrong and needs to be fixed.  Well, at least she likes my coloring.  I may not post tomorrow night, for if I do indeed finish everything tonight and tomorrow morning, I think a 3-day sleep is on order.  Night.

       Tonight I flipped back and forth between Iron Chef (always on at 9pm!) and a show on Discovery about the history of cannibalism.  I got to the point that I was just getting confused on which I was watching.  They really went into some detail about that human stuff...and you know Iron Chef...always some interesting ingredients.  Work is still a pretty rough, but my Mom surprised me with a ticket to Chicago here in a couple of weeks, so that helped a lot!  I am seriously looking forward to that, and maybe I will get to eat at that Cuban restaurant she always talks about.    Anyway, sweet dreams of Thai mystery meat (blech!)

       Boy that was a long one. And I am still not done. I should have stayed past 9 but I just couldn't keep my eyes open and staring at that computer screen any longer. Probably try and get in around 6 tomorrow so I can have everything done in time for the person to review it. What is up with this work being work thing? Like they expect me to be on top of things and have responsibility for some dumb reason.  Still in the search for a new car, or a way out of a new car. Stupid money with its stupid green and its stupid paper. Yeah, it needed to be said.  More tomorrow...if I love you as much as you think I do.  Oh, and just because I do love you ...Will Ferrell as George W.

       Wow, I think for one of the first times ever this summer I am not going to gush about my perfect weekend.  First things, I ran into some car problems and it is quite possible I will be in need of a vehicle very soon.  Sucky.  Then the money woes kept coming.  A huge electric bill (deposits suck) and a pretty expensive Friday night.  Speaking of Friday night, I am sorry that it turned out the way that it did.  I had a good time, but it probably cost me too much in the end (and more than just in my wallet.)  Encampment was ok.  I had never been there without being put to labor :)  We really didn't do much though, trying to recover from the previous evening.  The moon was incredible though.  Not only was it a blue moon, but it was a harvest moon...glowing orange in the sky.  Very cool.  So this week is studying for my test and trying to figure out how I can pull all of this car/money stuff off for the next few months.  Too bad Ramen isn't in my diet.
