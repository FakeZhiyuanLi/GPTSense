      It was a beautiful spring day when I heard a knock on the door. I had never been so happy to see my mail carrier in all of my life.  I signed for the package, and all but skipped back in to my house!  The suspense was killing me... I wanted to be patient and wait until I could open the gift I had just received, while on the phone with the sender.  Alas, fate was not in our corner. Knowing I had to open this very private, secret gift while I was still alone, I grabbed the box, and pulled the opening cord.  As I pulled out a festively decorated gift bag, my heart began to race, and a smile beamed from between my ears. First I pulled out a card.... noticing my hands begin to quiver as I carefully opened the envelope.  Pulling out the card, I released what seemed thousands of pieces of confetti's.... such a kidder he is I think to myself.  I open the card.. And read what the stroke of his manly hand wrote... "Remember how important it is to find yourself, and not lose track of your importance..." My smile grew even bigger... I even found myself giggling out loud.  I dug a bit deeper in to the bag, pulling out a small statue... an adorable little hug figurine.  Giggling once again... at how well he knows me.  Overcome with excitement, I reached in the bag yet again... this time pulling out a bookmark, which read..."A fine beginning is a beautiful thing."  A Chinese Proverb.  My heart racing a bit more, I reach in to this never ending gift bag... this time my hand finds a familiar material... a soft gel like material... with no hesitation I quickly pull out a vibrant pink vibrator. My very first insertion toy!!  Just when I didn't think my smile could become any bigger, I prove myself wrong... I was now glowing... smiling from the inside out.  Noticing there was yet more in the bag, I reached in again... this time pulling out a box of penis peppermints... this made me bust out laughing... one, because I knew he remembered how I felt about bad breath, and two because he was being his normal humorous self, sending them in penis form.  Such a turn on... a man with a sense of humor and the mind to know how to use it :)  I couldn't believe there was yet more to discover, this time I decided to just empty the bag out on my futon... to my surprise there was what I believe to be another toy... some sort of clitoral stimulator I am guessing, with what looked like fun attachments.  My head began to shake.... I couldn't believe how thoughtful this birthday surprise was... he had covered all the bases.  Motivational words.... caring thoughts... humor... fun... and sex. If my birthday were to end with his gift alone, I would consider it one of my favorite and most memorable birthdays in my 32 years of life.
