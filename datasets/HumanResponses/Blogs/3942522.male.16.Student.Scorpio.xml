      I got this female friend who I have known for 5 years and certainly my best friend. She's got this very different character which seems to&nbsp;possess magnet ability to attract me. She's also a very resplendent lady with very well structured organs. Not forgetting her smooth and fair complexion which seems so comfortable to touch with. Well, she's also got this very cheerful splendiforous smile which will makes you go "WOW" !! I still remember we used to do stupid things together which led both of us into deepest regrets. Not only that, we sufferred the worst torment no one can ever imagine or go through. Thinking back, I feel so disappointed with myself for living that type of life which I will never want to ever again. Fortunately, we turned more mature and make ourselves a much happily person which we wanted forever. However, we must pay for our sins for&nbsp;a long period of time which affects our lifes severely. We can't blame but to accept with pride. Most people looked down on people like us but people in&nbsp;our circle are very encouraging. They didn't give us up nor dislike us and are even proud of us. That's because we did something most people are unable to. I would rather tell myself that I have gone through more than anyone elses do. Gain an experience and get into a higher&nbsp;level of maturity. We seems so near yet so far and now it is getting miles away and away. I can't wait to meet her MY BEST FRIEND again. We share the same problems and understand each other very well. Someday, we will be able to meet again and commemorate that day. Never shall I forget that day and will be looking forward for it.&nbsp;*sad* :(

      *Yawns* I'm so tired and exhausted after all my studies and homework.. They are killing me !! And worst still exams are coming and it's the major one !! Oh god, I am lack of time and sometimes I really hope there are 36 hours a day.. So that&nbsp;I can sound sweet longer and no longer morning sun could bug me to wake up... My exams are around the corner and is no longer&nbsp;relax as before.. It would be fine if there are 1000 days a year so that I could enjoy youth.. :p But I could dream no more and face my reality.. Its been quite long ever since I have enjoy.. But I will make sure I will play hard once this torment is over... Well, fun in studying is still existing to me as I really enjoy passing my time with it.. Moreover, I am not afraid of any subjects anymore because I have adequate skills in all of them.. Awwww, I missed my primary school days suddenly !! Maybe because I have been stressing myself all along but I really hope to go back to the days where I do not have headaches.. Turning the time back, I remember the scene and image when I am so childish !! Oh my god !! It's really embarrassing for me to even think of it let alone still having the attitude.. However, it is quite cute and I even smile to myself for that.. *Sigh* Those were the days while time is travelling and here I am ageing.. I could dream no further and hope that I could be climb up into another level through this test..

      Awwwww... Just finish doing my 100 skippings and now I am exhausted.. While waiting for myself to cool down from panting, I am here to blog.. Well, I am trying hard to reach my ideal height, 180cm. I always think that guys shouldn't be short and that it won't look nice while standing beside your partner if you are.. I learnt some tips to grow taller the fastest way and skipping proves to me the most efficient way.. Everyone knows skipping but do everyone know the secret behind it? Here comesss the tips... When you are jumping, you make sure that your legs are stretched until you feel as though something is pulling your legs.. Remember to do it slowly and not rush.. You will waste all your energy if you do and worst still no improvements at all.. To add on, try to do this constantly everyday and increasing the amount of workout.. I grown 5 cm taller within half a year but I still have to work even harder for my dream.. *Sigh* I have chunks of homework not yet completed.. Gotta go to enjoy a refreshing bath and have my homework done.. See ya ~

      I saw this blogging way back a few months but never had the time.. Well, recently did I realise that it is an interesting way to make&nbsp;myself glance back and expressing myself.. I used to keep a diary when I was young but I lost the interest of holding a pen later on.. I have scary past and backgrounds which no one wants to go through.. Neither do I wish to see it happen again !! Blogging seems different from writing in a diary.. It seeeeeeems like my secrets are no longer needed to hide..

      My exams is coming and i'm still quite far from target. I have tried my very best but its very tiring. *Sigh* I need an energy boost but where to search for it ? Red bull and chicken essence ain't useful anymore. I'm numb of it and it doesn't seems to work now. I'm busy nowadays and that's why you can see why its been a long since i blogged. Just had my lunch and i feel so sleepy now and don't know why it always happen. Anyway, I'm going to lie down on my bed and digest all my chicken rice. Bye Bye !

      I just taken my prelim exams and it almost had me killed. The questions are not as direct as the revision we done before. I felt so helpless and had my paper scribbled with all my nonsense. Well, I could only do a few of them while the others really sucks !! Oh my god !! Its the most fearful subject I gonna take tommorrow, its Chinese !! It is always the lowest mark that I score among all. I neglect my Chinese since I was young. But never mind, I think it would not beat me down because I believe I can pass it. Yesterday was Jay's album first day of release but I still haven't collect my CD yet. *Sigh* Anli told me it was nice and I couldn't stand the temptations. I heard it before on the radio and MY GOD !! It was extremely nice to be able to smooth my ears. You will like it when you hear it the first time.
