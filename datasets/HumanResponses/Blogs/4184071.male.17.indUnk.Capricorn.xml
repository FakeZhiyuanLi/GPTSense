      Ok, so my friend put this in his blog, so i figured i would steal his idea. I was always good at taking things. Mwahahaha. Anyway, these are some of the things im grateful for in life:  1. At the top of my list are my friends. Whether i talk to you every night, see you every day, or just say hello once in awhile in passing, i appreciate all of you. I can't express my gratitude enough, and without all of you, I'm seriously nothing. Thank you for every time you've put up with me, cheered me up, or spent time with me. 2. My heath. I'm not dead, dying, or even seriously injured, and for that I am thankful. I could have some illness, a broken leg from soccer, or a cronic condition which could keep me in bed forever. But because i dont have any of those things, i can run around, be crazy, and just enjoy life. 3. My parents. I dont give them enough credit, but they have given just the right amount of leniency and give just enough freedom for me to make my own mistakes and take from them, but not so much as to fuck up my life, which i dont think i've done so far.  4. Freedom. Without it I'd be going crazy, and even if i feel confined by life sometimes, i can always walk outside my door and know that i wont get shot or run over, which is a better feeling than being trapped or unsafe.  5. Comfort. Yeah, it hurts after a week of two practices a day, but i know that i have a comfortable bed at home that i can lay down and pass out in. Even if my nights are often sleepless, its still good to have a place of refuge like my room. Tylenol and ibeuprofin (which i found out last year from my doctor, can safely be combined!) also fall into this category.  So yeah, today was tough. My grampa's funeral service at the cemetary hurt pretty bad. It was harder than i thought to say goodbye. And what hurt even worse was seeing my sister emily cry too. Both of us were pretty close to him, and i think she took it worse than i did. Its just strange, her being a lawyer, cool and collected and completely on top of things usually, and then today she just broke down. Crying, shaking, yearning for a hug. And thats just what she got, and it felt good to comfort and be comforted in return.  After that, we went to lunch with a few relatives (cool ones) whom i havent seen since i was a little kid. It was really good to catch up and enjoy laughing and sharing memories about the great man who was my grampa. He'll forever be in my heart and mind, and many of my actions, and a good part of my character will reflect the traits and properties of his own. He was amazing and he will be in my heart and mind as long as i keep breathing.  After lunch we parted ways, and went to a Barnes and Noble. I bought a few books about college and the such, and it made me a little sad, but at the same time excited for my future. I can't wait to get out of this town, you dont even know.  After that, i got home, went to ice cream with dave bess and the sarahs, which was good (and so was the ice cream, i LOVE paige's) got home, relaxed for awhile. Then went to the Complete Works with a few people. It was hilarious and ingeniously performed. Especially ben and nathaniel with their crazy RVB and Family Guy inside jokes. LOL. Thanks for the laughs guys.  After the good times, went with Korin (welcome home) and Nick (have fun in NY for the next week) and Shawn (wow you're crazy son), and played Ghetto Munchkin (dont ask) for a few hours. It was loads of fun. While i was doing all of these things, i had a few things on my mind. I really wanted to talk to jessie and kate, make plans with jess for tomorrow, talk to kate about a bunch of stuff, and just relax. I did just that when i got home. Talked online, then on the phone for awhile, grabbed a small bite to eat and then wrote this. I have a lot on my mind, my heart's on fire, and im going crazy. But life could be worse, and I'm thankful for all that I'm given. The love, the friends, the good times. Thank you all and to all a good night.

      Ok, so after doing this morning's practice, I'm halfway done with soccer week. Five done, five to go. Thank god. So much. Scrimmage against Leland and Gray tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes. I think we're all damn tired, so hopefully we'll be able to stretch our legs and beat the everlovin crap out of em. The team (or at least I) am getting sick of practices, and some good solid (or even not-so-solid) competition would be great. Anyway, not too much going on. Rather uneventful week so far. Nick is almost done with painting, then we can hang out. Wow. Stupid Italian, always painting. Not really, but it seems that way. Har har har. Lets see... almost looking forward to school just because it'll be good to see everyone, even though we have a game the first day of school... Still, I dont wanna start having to do stuff with my brain again. Not at least for another month. Sox won with a bottom of the ninth rbi by cabrera - its good to know he's good for something. Damn it. Nomar should just, like, magically get traded back, or something. Meh. Stupid Yanks lost. All in all, a decent day - hopefully today will be at least the same.

      Ok, so i'm watching water polo from the Olympics, and we just beat Kazakhstan, 8-5. And I start thinking to myself... does Kazakhstan even have water? I mean seriously. 8-5 is way too close for playing a country that hasn't invented water yet. We have the great lakes, from sea to shining sea, the land of 10,000 lakes, and about 100 million pools. Ok good. At least we won, unlike our bball team. WTF is Iverson doing as the captain? What a joke.  Soccer's been a bitch, past two days at 7am. GRRRRRRRRRR. Too bad for me. I'll live. I just wanna get out there and play. None of this practice stuff. I'm lucky to have escaped with a few bruises, scrapes, and turf burns...  I miss people. Call me. I'm available this week from 9am - 5pm and after 9pm. Anyway, I'm alive, still able to walk and talk and breathe, and thats good enough. Har har har. Mourn the lobster boat! I'm so sorry Liz... lol. Peace.

      So after three days of caddying, my feet are blistered, my wallet is bigger, and im no nearer to being ready for soccer at 7 tomorrow morning. Oh well. I'll live. I'm not really a soccer player, just a goalkeeper. Therefore I get to slack off. Sometimes. A little bit.  Life is average. Could be terribly worse. Could be so much better. I'm feeling worse about soccer than ever before. Like the only reason im doing it is because everyone expects and wants me to. Dont get me wrong, the extra attention and the physical shape im in by the end of the season are great perks, but i just dont think its worth it. I hate getting up in the morning and "wasting" my last few weeks of vacation dragging my ass to a practice i dont want to be at. I probably sound like a spoiled kid or something, but its become one of my least favorite things in the world - more like a chore than a favorite past time.  Now that I've gotten my anti soccer feelings out, I think I'll get on Eurosport and look for some cleats and gloves. Fun! I love shopping.  So yeah, life is weird. But I'm happy to be alive. Sometimes I wish I weren't. But other times I swear I'm the happiest guy in the world. A mixed bag, you may say.  Got a bunch more college info from the places I requested it from. The decision is not getting any easier, I have no idea where to apply to. It sucks.  So yeah, I'm just in a random mood, filling my mind with random feelings and random tangents of thought. I hope you're not too tripped out by my format tonight, going from one thing to a completely unrelated next.  Leave me comments god dammit! I love you guys, send some back.  Anyway, I'm going to enjoy the last few hours of the night before I go to sleep and then wake up, more than likely miserable.

      Yeah, so Wednesday and Thursday were good fun, hanging out with friends, playing in a softball game, just chillin, eating good food, etc. It was surprisingly good to take a trip away from the life i know all too well.  Speaking of life, it sucks sometimes. You figure out the best thing in the world, and its just out of reach.  Certain things just make you wonder about life and this weekend was one of them. Maybe its just me, being a little depressed just because its what i do, coupled with a few smaller things going on, and the stress piling up to my eyes, but i just hate it sometimes. Feeling hollow, out of the control, hating the old self for every little shitty thing that goes wrong. Thats just what i do. I get these little bursts of terrible things going through my head, blaming myself, thinking of things i could have done differently, little things building up to be bigger things, etc. It happens a lot, especially this time of year, but somehow it caught me offguard this week and just tore a big hole in me. Not anyones fault but my own i guess. Maybe im just dumb. Thats just me, how i live.  Anyhow, im thankful for my life, especially now for a number of reasons. Got some great friends and a sweet year ahead... just need to stop being a depressed dumbass and we'll be ok. Anyway, just needed to vent a little bit, and im sure theres a lot of steam left, but its going to be a long day tomorrow, so hopefully i'll live.  PS: Sorry Lizzie, NH was a blast and i couldnt find anything about it that sucks compared to vermont. No construction, no dumbasses, beautiful country, good old friends, etc. Will keep trying though, have fun with Devo tomorrow.

      So its 3am ish, and im feeling pretty restless, sleep deprived, and insomniacal, but thats nothing new. Tomorrow (or rather, later today), I'm going to NH to chill with some people i havent seen in forever, so that should be good. Just figured i'd say good bye and ask for all you people who are going to miss me (riiiiight) to leave messages here. Thoughts on this summer would be good, because i know i havent seen some of you at all. Amy, hope Chicago is fun, Jon, Cali is always good, all others who are travelling, have a great time. Molly, thanks for the fun times today, really helped me get out of a funk. You know how it is. But how did you hide that pond behind my house? Seriously, it never really existed. Oh well... will miss you guys, have fun in vermont. Woot.  Ps: Lizzie... its going to be really hard, but i WILL find reasons why NH sucks. Okay? Good. And I'm pretty sure we're on for the formal party type deal (valet?) on the 20th. We'll see. Pizout!

      Ok, so this is my second post in a row, and for all you who know me, you know that its a miracle. Anyway... yesterday was decent. Didnt really get to chill with JessiCA, and i was really sick, and soccer didnt help (stupid dad making me go), but overall i felt better than sunday night. Got to chat with friends long into the night - it was almost like last summer. Ha! Anyway... so yeah, today hopefully i will get a lot done... like write my scholarship essay, hang out with molly and jess, and get practice over and done with. Tons of fun!  Random thoughts: -Evan is a big loser, but he's cool anyway. -Jessie is evil, but still cool anyway. -Soccer sucks. -I miss Kate. -What happened to Jenn, did she disappear or something? -Tums are my friends. -KOTOR (evan will get this one, maybe nick if he can figure it out)  Ok, had to get those out of my system. Maybe I'll post later, this one was kinda boring. Even for me. Peace.

      So this is my first post... and therefore the biggest update ever...  Life is... weird. Last night it hit me like a sledgehammer that my grandfather died while i was in Japan. Why mother's mother passed away last year, and it felt nothing like this. I was a lot closer to my Grandfather, and for some reason it just hadn't registered that he was gone forever. I thought I got it out of my system, trying to accept it for what life had given me, but the more I think about it, the more depressed I become. Oh well, I'm like that. I bottle things up and once in awhile the cork just pops and everything in my mind crashes down for a few weeks. It also doesn't help that I've been unable to see the people I care about most very much this summer... I've missed Lela, Jess, Britt, and Korin (despite his dumb sarcasm) a ton this summer, and now I miss Kate more than ever. Grrr, but what can ya do? Its just like that sometimes.  That aside - This weekend was the most fun I have had all summer. I got to meet Kate, whom I love dearly, more than she knows, went to six flags, got lost in Massachusetts (only for a little while and it was fun), and just relaxed. The next two weeks are going to be hell, with soccer, travel, school coming up, working, etc, but this weekend was respite from a summer that has been great, but has still left longing for more. It made me realize (again) that I've been drifting away from my friends and that they're the single most important thing in my life right now.  Kate - I love you, miss you, and don't want you to go to Maine (its an hour farther away)... but thank you for this weekend, and we will continue to talk religiously on the phone. You're amazing. Jessie - You're amazing, and I owe it to you to hang out with you tomorrow. Highschool is going to be fun, and I love you so much, we're going to be crazy this year. Nick and Evan - You two are my best friends and I'd be nothing without you guys to chat it up, play video games, or just hang out and do nothing for entire days at a time. Jenna and Karin - I know we haven't chilled as much as I would have liked to this summer, with UB and travelling and the such, but you two are great friends who just make life fun. Britt - One of my best, even if we dont chill that much any more. Have fun in Hofstra and don't forget us here in VT. Everyone else - Miss you all, at least school will bring us together (go seniors!)  So yeah, I'm a little depressed, but its been a great summer, so I can't and shouldn't complain. Life goes on, doesn't it?
