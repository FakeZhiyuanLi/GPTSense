      There's a place off Ocean Avenue, were I use to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right, sleepin' all day stayin' up all night Stayin' up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street Where we'd walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night Stayin' up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a peice of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by And I can make believe that you'r here tonight That you'r here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eye When I told you that this was good-bye You were begging me not night not here not now  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a peice of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go it's everything I see When I sleep I dream and it gets me by And I can make believe that your here tonight That your here tonight

Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love cause you're so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that? You're the one who gives it all away  [Chorus:] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Don't think that your charmin the fact that your arm is now around my neck I got you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said Did I not tell you that I'm not like that, you're the one who, throws it all away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?

      It starts with one... One thing,  I don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try, Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme, To explain in due time, All I know, Time is a valuable thing, Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings, Watch it count down 'till the end of the day, The clock ticks life away, It's so unreal, You didn't look out below, Watch the time go right out the window, Trying to hold on, Didn't even know, I wasted it all, Just to watch you go, I kept everything inside, And even know I tried, It all fell apart, What it meant to be, Will eventually be, A memory of a time, when ,  I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter, I had to fall,  To lose it all, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter,  One thing, i don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try, Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme, To remind myself How I tried so hard... In spite the way you were mocking me, Acting like i was part of your property, Remembering all the times you fought with me, I'm surprised it got so far, Things aren't the way they were before, You wouldn't even recognize me anymore, Not that you knew me back then, But it all comes back to me, In the end... You kept everything inside, And even know i tried it all fell apart, What it meant to me, will, Eventually, be a memory of a time when,  I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter, I had to fall,  To lose it all, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter,  I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as I can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know,  I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as i can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know...  I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter, I had to fall,  To lose it all, But in the end,  It doesn't even matter

      What's with these homies dissin' my girl? Why do they gotta front? What did we ever do to these guys That made them so violent?  Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours. Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine. Woo-hoo, and that's for all the time.  [chorus] Woo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly. Oh-Oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore. I don't care what they say about us anyway. I don't care 'bout that.   Don't you ever fear, I'm always near. I know that you need help. Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit. You need a guardian.  Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours. Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine. Woo-hoo, and that's for all the time.  [chorus] I don't care 'bout that.  Bang! Bang! Knock on the door, another big bang, you're down on the floor. Oh No! What do we do? Don't look now but I lost my shoe. I can't run and I can't kick. What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick?

      The sea is foamin' like a bottle of beer. The wave is comin' but I ain't got no fear. I'm waxin' down so that I'll go real fast. I'm waxin' down because it's really a blast. I'm goin' surfin' cuz I don't like your face. I'm bailin' out because I hate the race Of rats that run, round and round, in a maze. I'm goin' surfin', I'm goin' surfin'.  [chorus] You take your car to work. I'll take my board. And when your out of fuel, I'm still afloat.  My buddies and their honeys all come along. They seem invincible as they surf along. The sea is rollin' like a thousand pound keg. We're goin' surfin', we're goin' surfin.  [chorus](x2)  All along the undertow is strengthening its hold. I never thought it'd come to this. Now, I can never go home. (x2)  [chorus]  You take your car to work. I'll take my board. (All along the undertow is strengthening its hold.) And when your out of fuel, I'm still afloat. (I never thought it'd come to this. Now, I can never go home.)  [chorus]  You take your car. I'll take my board. (x2)  Let's go!

      I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you  [Chorus:] I've become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired, so much more aware I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you   Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control 'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart, right in front of you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) An' every second I waste is more than I can take  [Chorus: Repeat]  And I know I may end up failing too But I know You were just like me With someone disappointed in you  [Chorus: Repeat]  I've Become so numb I can't feel you there I'm tired of being what you want me to be (x2)

Anyways when I woke up, my mom told me we were going with her family to eat at the Melting Pot downtown. That was the coolest place ever. You like pretty much made your own food. Dont really wanna explain right now. Maybe in my next post. Then Robbie came over and we watched Little Rascals. Did you know Donald Trump is in  that movie. Wow. Anyways, thats the last time I will see him for a week. Got a pimp new layout for the site. Check it out.  urlLink The site   Im out Matt

      Well. Robbie came over (I think all of my posts shall start with this) about 11 and he skateboarded some more(by the way his pics and video section is updated) and well he actually landed it. We were getting on the board and pushin it out from under eachother and it hurt but it was extremely funny. Then me and Robbie went in to play some nintendo 64(oh yeah were old school). We played south park as usual. Jason left today and wont be back for 12 days. That sucks. Robbie leaves Saturday to go to Indianalpolous(or however u spell it) He wont be back till next saturday. Brittany comes back when Robbie leaves. Guess I will have to hang out with her for a week. Worst of all. Maci leaves for the beach tommorow. I wont see her anymore the whole summer, then Im going to High School. So I wont see much of her anymore. This summer rocked now it looks like its ggoing downhill. Anyways. Corey came over and asked out Maci twice hahaa. She said once just jokingly and he kept telling her he loved her. Funniest thing evar lol. Then. Robbie went to the movies, Maci went in, Corey left, So I could only do one thing. Drink gatorade and play basketball till someone came out. Finally about 8:30 Maci and her sisters friend came out sneaking on Danielle and Her Boyfriend. HEHEH. Then Maci came down and some other dude and his Girlfriend and we played 21. The game never ended. All the girls(The dude GF, Maci, and Haley) were on a team and me and the other guy were seprate. We just kept tipping the girls. The other kept tipping me and I just tipped him back. So it never really ended. Anyways that leads me to now and I just heart Kacey and Logans voicemail (lol) Pretty funny girls. Okay well im out. Im really tired

      Sorry bout the no updates guys. I will just start from yesterday. I was over my cousins....sleeping. My phone rang at 10, and youll never guess who it was........ROBBIE! He was back. So I went home and he came over. We went on the internet and did some crap. Then we played Halo for bout an hour and then Red Dead Revolver. So then we went downstairs to eat hotdogs, and drink these juices, it was hilarious, you just had to be there. Then we went over Sarahs, and we those liquid ice things. One popped and got in our eyes. OMG!!! That was the worst thing ever. It hurt so bad. Like we both could cry. My eye was burning, and when you open it, it would like sting. It hurt so bad. Gosh, It hurt for like 30 minutes. Sarah gave us water and we poured it all in our eye. Oh geez. It really is liquid ice guys, cuz when you open your eye, you couldnt hold for more then 2 secs. Finally after I held it for a long time, it started to stop hurting. GEEZ STAY AWAY FROM LIQUID ICE. Anyways. In theropy from our SCARY ACCIDENT, we went to my house. Did whatever and Daddy Daycare was on, so we watched it. That flash kid rocks, and the one that speaks the star trek. lol. At 5:45 we went to robbies and we play fifa soccer, and then he went to eat. So my cousin picked me up and I went to smoothie king. Oh I got the big one, made me sick afterwards. Then on my way home, robbie came back over. We shot basketball then got on the computer. We were downloading all these funny songs and put them on my PCDJ(its a song mixer). It was hilarious. He had to go in so, I got on the internet and played halo. Then I went to bed at 12(Wow I know, isnt that amazing). I woke up, took a shower and everything, now I am sitting here and waiting to go church. Well I guess I will see you there. Seeya guys.

She had to go the mall so I went back to Justins and we lit off those little fireworks called Bees. After that, I just chilled I guess. Oh yeah, btw my hand hurts and has little places, but its fine ^_^. We went home and then back to Brittanys to get my retainer O_o. So then I went to the mall with Karen, just me and her lol. We walked around pretty much the whole store. Then I went home, had me a Georgia Peach, and then Robbie came over. We were hitting whiffle balls with golf clubs towards Macis House.

Then Alaina left (sad isnt it) and me britt made cookies, giant cookies to be exact. I ate one. Then went to Taco Bell. Yummy. We came back and I was pressure washing my aunts driveway. It ran outta gas so I filled it up and then was starting it. I put my hand on the engine and burnt it real bad. Thats the worst pain I ever felt. I had to keep it in water all day. I watched Top Gun though. Great movie. Then Alaina called me like at 11:30. We talked till twelve. Heh. Then I went to bed. Now Good Bye. And have a great day.

We then headed to Dollywood. Fun fun fun. The ride, well was hilarious. My aunt is crazy, cracks me up. She made the trip awesome. Rode the rollercoasters first, thunderhead. It was pretty wild, didnt scare me though. I sat with Alaina through everything. I rode the other roller coaster, Tennessee Twiser, twice. The second time me and Alaina or actually Alaina and I but stfu, rode in the front. It beat my head to death. The very last ride, ze ferris wheel. Im not afraid of heights but dag gomit, Alaina kept bending over and the thing was rocking, I was gonna freak. I dunno that really bothered me. I got to know her better though so thats great. I bought  a season pass.  Went home, sat in back with Alaina. Then went to my Aunt, Karens. Ate. Then rode britts go kart, and then Alaina rode with me, forever. I lost my wallet. I found it later in the road XD. Everything was in there lol. Then we went to Target. It was pretty fun. Saw Hank and Mariah but they didnt enter. Now Im home, and tired. Might go to bed soon
