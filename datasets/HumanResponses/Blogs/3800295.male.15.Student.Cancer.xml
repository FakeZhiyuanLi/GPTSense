      theres this girl im going out with.  im definetly not telling were she lives...u would want to steal her (if your a guy). shes awesome. I love just hanging out with her shes so entertaining...im never bored with her. we always go to this place called hpvillage. if u havent heard of it ill tell u about it. its like a plaza thats has all these old looking buildings...they kinda have that mediteraining look. but anways its owned by one person so it has like the perfect combination of shops. there is a really small theatre there thats all like old looking and stuff. u can actually see it at regenttheatres.com. there are like different restaurants. our favorite is this italian restaurant. it has this pattio thats really cool  that we sit out on and share a pizza. But both of us just sneak out to this plaza place all the time. We kiss in the theatre sometimes. My birthday is this saturday...cant wait! were going to see a movie and hopefully she will let me kiss her. she is really pretty but she never gives herself a enough credit for how prety she is. sometimes i feal guilty because she is so beautiful and she dosnt know. i think that if she did she might not go out with me. but dont worry i tell her she is pretty. she just dosnt believe me.   i cant wait to see her again.

      ok first of all im a mac os x guy. panther was kick A and tiger is going to even be better. the programs that will be dexeloped on it our going to be awesome with all these features that help developers and stuff. i wish i could help make all these cool apps on xcode. but i just cant figure it our. i wish there was just a book that tought u how to do everything with xcode. like i learned c++ for a while...but i cant figure out how to make source on that work...and all c++ seems to do is have input and output on a prompt. but im just a newbie. but if i could just find the right info i wouldnt have to be. oh well.   anyways im running a powerbook g4 with 1 ghz...ive got 256 ram yes i know sucky and panther. and my hardrive is 40gb...which is fine for me cause i only need a few gigs to store music and i keep all my movies on a dvd courtesy of my superdrive!

      ive been thinking about how r brain works. but im not sure how it does. maybe were like a computer were the input is sight sound taste...etc. and maybe the output is r movments and what we say. so the real question is do we have any control between that input and output. or r we just victums of the world around us and everything going on.

      I'm planning on getting my moms old dell that she has. I hope to run BSD on it so i can learn how all of it works. the Dell is pretty slow but it will have to do. (12gb hardrive, cd drive, 256 ram, some really crapy graphics card)

      sorry that i haven't been able to update lately for some reason my posts would not correctly publish.   Anyways i've got a new book that teaches objective-c and I'm reading as much as I can. objective-c is language for making good programs in mac with the cocoa frame works which let you create powerful applications that can easily have GUIs. Also i have been reading my mac os x panther unleashed a lot. i skipped to the BSD subsystem which is about like all the "behind the scenes" stuff which the graphics of panther cover up and work with. I'm on the chapter about advanced shell concepts and commands.

      ok so i was thinking a little about if i really did live in a pink tube with my whole life fed to me via a neural simulation. but, i came up with some reasons the matrix dosn't have me. wouldnt the agents destroy the movie about the matrix before it came out. or maybe the movie is a systemic anomly to the matrix. which brings up another question. why can't the machines just press the delet button on neo? if they built the matrix obviously they should be able to control it. and i have another question about control how can anyone hide in the matrix? shouldnt every particle in the matrix be programed to read the surrounding happenings...and then just send each of there feeds to millions and millions of different ai programs that had the sole job of reporting an error to the archetect. and then  finally when an error is spotted the agents have to mosy on over or do there use somebodys body to pop out thing. why cant they just make the needed changes to the matrix to be wherever they need to be...why cant they just teleport basically. i came apon some good answers for that...its makes for a really cool movie.

      im finally figuring out how to use xcode! im learning a new programing language...objective-c. im trying to figure out how to use all of the features in xcode reelating to cocoa and all that, but its hard enough learning objective-c online. all the documentation is really vague. but i think im getting a grip on the whole objective programing....at least i wrote a very simple program using objects. the only thing left that i really need to grasp is how to make a application with a gui. oh ya, and i got a new book called mac os x panther unleashed. while im still going to be a programing newbie i can at least become a unix and pnather guru.
