       1) netstat -an ----> this will show you which applications are listening on which ports - this is one way to tell if you're web/db server is up and runnning  2) locate   -----> locate searches the file system for the file name you give it (well actually it searches a database of the filesystem, but that's just splitting hairs)  3) ps -aux ----> This command shows you ALL the processes running on the system ( the '| grep http' bit searches through the output of ps -aux and filters it based on the arg to grep - in this case the string 'http')  4) netstat -ln ------> Lists network ports that are in the LIsten state.  5) netstat -lnp -----> Lists network ports along with programs( Active Internet Connections)

       Here is the process :::::  you just need to reinstall LILO. That means you have to boot into Linux some other way. Use the First CD of ur distro and go to repair option. At the command prompt just type /sbin/lilo. You should get a response that looks like this:  Added linux * Added win  The asterisk (*) indicates the default boot image. (If you see anything other than this, something went wrong. Go back through your lilo.conf and read the man page to see what it was.) When you reboot, LILO will be back where it belongs! ------

       It's happened to almost every GNU/Linux and Windows dual boot user at some point: You have a nice installation GNU/Linux cross-booted with Windows. So far so good. But then, at some point, you reinstall Windows, perhaps because you upgraded to a new version, or perhaps you just did it to "clean up" Windows, reinstalling the original system files to make it a little more stable. When you reboot, however, you'll find that if you had LILO running from your hard disk's MBR, it has been killed, and Windows has claimed the MBR as its own. How will you reinstall your boot manager so you can get into GNU/Linux?   here is small tutorial on how to reinstall your gnu boot loader in that case. I chose GRUB here as now a days it's very popular and powerful too. For those who use LILO, chekc out my next post  ;)  ----  Boot into the rescue mode using install CD1 by typing "linux rescue" at the boot prompt. When it asks you if you want it to find your installation and mount it, let it by selecting "Continue". Once you get to the sh prompt chroot into you installation with:  # chroot /mnt/sysimage  If the disk you boot from is /dev/hda then you should be able to reinstall grub with:  # grub-install /dev/hda  Just remember to exit the chroot'ed shell before you reboot. If you reboot by "Ctrl-Alt-Del" the installer will unmount your partitions. Although it probably wouldn't hurt to try to unmount as many as you can yourself with something like:  # umount /dev/hd?[1-9]*    -----  :)

       Tutorial : Redhat 9 Intallation step by step Tutorial / How to Distro specific : Redhat 9 ( also works for 7.1-8 ) Skill level: Newbie Time for procedure : Depends upon machine and user. Prerequestic: Should know what is operationg system. Basic knowledge of computing. Redhat 9 installation Cds. A latest computer with atleast 128 MB RAM (256 MB Recommended) CDROM drive and more than 400 MHZ of CPU power.  Author's Note: Again.. After lots of question about installing of Redhat 9 I decided to write this step by step tutorial / how to. I feel little late as Fedora core 1 is officially launched but still I found people asking question about how to install Linux Redhat 9. I have decided to write this ask people hesitate to install linux for first time because they are not sure whether it is safe for their current OS data ( M$ windoz or any other OS ) So before discussing how to install , step by step method I like to give some introduction about dual boot concept.  What is Dual booting : When we say dual booting we mean having more than once OS on same machine. Only one Operating System can run at once. It makes you feel like you are having two or more differnet system as you differnet OS. We can have more than two operating system on a machine, ie. you can have 3 or 4 OS on same machine. When we make a dual booting usually (if not chosen to boot from cd or floppy) we get the choice on startup that which OS you want to boot to ( start ). It is handled by a bootloader which take care after your choice to load which OS. Linux bootloader ( GRUB , Lilo ) has ability to boot Linux as well as all other known available operating system. Although you can use Windows bootloader also ( see Booting Linux from Windows bootloader ) but that is little advance.  Common Questions about dual boot : a. Can I access windows partition from Linux , vice-versa.? Ans : Yes you can access windows partition from Linux, Infact already answered several times (Use search feature at LinuxSolved.com to find your answer). But to access linux partition from windows you will need some software like explorer2fs used to access linux from windows.  b. Do it ( Linux Installation ) will cause data loss ? Ans : If you follow this tutorial correctly then there will be no loss.  c. Can I have triple boot ? Ans : yes you can have.  d. What about partition ? Ans : See Preparation & Requirements and also step No. 10 & 11. directly.  e. My question is not answered here..!! Ans : please post your specific query to get detailed answer.  Preparation & RequirementsI suggest you to have atleast 6 GB of free space or a empty 6 GB of partition. You can actually install RH on less than 1 GB of space when only server is chosen. If you are using MS windows 98, XP, 2000, ME and have a partition which is around 6 GB then all you need is to empty that partition by moving its data to ( if data is important ) other drive or else leave it as it is if data is not important ( not to be preserved ). Although you can choose any of the windows partition to install linux ( that partition will be not available for windows) ie. D:, E:, F: but I suggest you to choose the last ( here F: ) for easier and hassle free install. In the case you don't have separate partition ie. on big partition then I suggest you to use utitlity like partition magic to resize your current partition and then create New partition for Linux.(If you are planning to install linux on separate hard drive then no need to read about partitions. Also keep a floopy disk handy in the case if it is required.  Installation Step by Step  1. Get Linux CDS. ( here we assume that you have proper bootable Redhat 9 cds with you or you have downloaded images and then burnt into cdroms )  2. Now make sure that your computer is set to boot from CDROM ( It is done through BIOS ). Insert your Redhat 9 CD-1 and boot off of your computer from it.  3. Now it will show screen showing few options.. ( Redhat Linux 9 ) and a RED HAT of course . Press Enter to through graphical installtion ( We are not using text installation here ). It will now ask various things which will be described in separate steps further.  4. In this step it will ask you to have a Media check to make sure that medium of your installation is safe ( I suggest to do media check ). To test CDs navigate using tab and select "OK" by pressing Enter then it will show a screen asking you to start test using "TEST" button or change cd using "EJECT CD" Button. So test the current cd press "TEST" and to test another select "EJECT CD" then change cd and put another cd to check. The checking process is little longer takes around 5 minz to 15 minz , if you cds are fine then it will show test results as "PASS" and you can continue other wise "FAILED" you can continue but you should never continue b'coz it wil cause trouble later in installtion. Try to clean you cd in the case of "FAILED" and do the test again, if again failed then don't install , get another media (New CDs). If result is "PASS" then select "CONTINUE" to install the Linux.  5. Welcome Note: After this it will load the Redhat Graphical installer. ( may take few minutes to load ) then i will show a "Welcome Screen". It has basically 2 parts a. Left : Showing online help, b. Middle+Right part: The actually action place. Now press "Next" to continue either by mouse or using Tab + enter for navigation from keyboard.  6. Language Selection: In this step it will ask you for the your preffered language ( Mostly english ) So select your language and press "NEXT" to move to next part.  7. Keyboard Configuration: Here it ask that which type of keyboard you use (Mostly U.S. English) then press "NEXT" to move to next step.  8. Mouse Configuration: This step is to configure your mouse. Most of the time it automatically detects the right mouse but if it has not just see if your mouse manufacturer name is there if yest then select appropriate model by expending the list and you are unable to find manufacturer or model then from generic select the the mouse which suits you mouse best.If you have serial mouse then select your devive to which it is connected. (/dev/ttyS0 if COM port 1 of windows, ttyS1 if COM port 2 of windows and so on). If you have 2 button mouse then select Emulate 3 buttons option which will make your mouse three button when you press your both button at same time . Now press "NEXT" to continue.  9. Installation Type: In this step first it will search for previous linux (Redhat Linux )installation. If you have one then it will ask you either upgrade or fresh install. BTW.. this tutorial is for fresh install becaue you are installing for first time. Now after searching when it don't find any previous installtion then it will show you 4 choices all consist of differnet sets of package of software as the name of choice suggest (Also well describe there) a. Personal Desktop b. Workstation c. Server d. Custom Choose the type of installation you want and then press "NEXT" (type of installation you need depends upon your requirements I choose "PERSONAL DESKTOP")  10. Disk Partitioning Setup: Here it will ask that Do you need manul or automatic partition to be done. Select "Automatically Partition" for automatic partition or Select "Manually Parition with Disk Druid" for manual partition. Now here becuase it will get bigger and complicated so I suggest you to choose "Mannually partition usin Disk druid" b'coz it will be easier in all the cases. Now press "NEXT" to move to next step.  11. Partitioning: It is the most important step for Newbies. Be careful and read every thing with patience. Go for either part a. or part b. as per your conditions. Now you are with a graphical utility which shows all the current partition on your hardisk or hardisks ( if you have more than one hd). Please don't bother for LVM and RAID thing over here those are advance stuff. a. Installing on separate physical drive If you are installtion Linux on second hardrive (primary slave) then it is called hdb in linux and first primary master is called hda so others are call hdc, hdd. Say you are installing on drive hdb then select it.Now press "NEW" from Menu bar above the table. It will show a dialog box with lots of option, just select mount point and give size then press Ok.So Creat a partition with mount ponit "/boot" around 100 mb press "OK" if it shows any error then just Press "CONTINUE", create root parition with mount point "/" of atleast 6 GB as suggested. Make a Swap partition of around 300-500 MB ( I suggest 300 MB) by choosing file system type as SWAP then mount point will not be required. Also you can creat other partition like "/home" whose size depends on the No. of users who are going to use the computer. Bigger size more flexibility. Press "NEXT" to continue.  b.Installing on Differnet partition same drive : When you are going to install Linux on differnet partition on same drive then follow the following steps. ( You should have either free space around 6 GB or a parition of 6 GB or more). I assume that you have 10 GB of Windows partition (FAT32) which was the drive F: under windows. NOTE: Partitions in linux are devoted by hda1 , hda2 ie. hda1 means fist drive's first partition , hda2 means first drive's second partition, hdb1 means second drive's first partition. Now locate your windows partition or free space you want to use for linux. To do so I have windows Last parition for LInux ie. F: so i looked for the last partition in the table which I found to be hda7. (If you choose a partition which is not last then find it by its size. And if all your parition are of same size the always choose last parition to install linux.) Now I found hda7 for linux then select and press "DELETE" in the Menu to delete that now it will become free space. ( If you have free space already then you should start partitioning from here ) . Now press "NEW" from Menu bar above the table. It will show a dialog box with lots of option, just select mount point and give size then press "OK" you can also change file system but just keep it "ext3" only. So we are now going to create only 4 partitions.. root ("/") 6 GB (6144 MB), boot ("/boot") 75 MB, ("/home") 3759 MB and SWAP (300 MB). To do so just press "NEW" select size and "OK". Make a Swap partition of around 300-500 MB ( I suggest 300 MB) by choosing file system type as SWAP then mount point will not be required. You can also make different partition table but I have suggested above for ease of understanding. Now when you have done your partion make sure who have done work over right partition becuase after this step you can't undo that. Now press "NEXT" to continue.  12. Boot Loader Configuration This is another important step in our installation. Mostly you don't need to do anything here just press "Enter" and continue as it alwasy detect your windows. But for the sake of this tutorial I will describe this a little more. This section first allow you to choose bootloader to be GRUB or Lilo. I chose Grub over here. Next option shows that how many OS it will boot to ( here two as Winows and LInux). You can also set that which OS should boot by defualt ( automatically without your intervention ) by giving tick on the box in front of the OS name. You can also change the Display name of the OS over here by selection and the pressing "EDIT". Also you can set bootloader password ( not necessary ). Here make sure your boot loader is getting installed on "/dev/hda" because we are going to use linux bootloader as the default bootloader. Now press "Next" to move to Network configuration. In the case you want to do advance stuff ( Like requried by our tutorial about Starting Linux from widnows bootloader ) then select "configure advance bootloader option" and Press "NEXT" then it will show advance option like want to install bootloader on /dev/hda or first sector of linux root partition (here /dev/hda7) then press "NEXT" to move to network configuration.  13. Network Configuration: This is important for network users, people on LAN etc. But also eqully important for general user. It shows you fisrt option with List of all network devices in your comptuer. I have a Single LAN card as eth0 (if more than one lan card then eth0, eth1, eth2 and so on.) which will be need to configure via DHCP. So I chose to configure via DHCP . In the case if you want your machine as server or it is connected to a LAN or ISP which needs static ip address then you have to select your network device and then press "EDIT" to set its option ie.. configure via dhcp or static IP address then PREss "OK" to close the dialog box. Now other option is to set HOstname of your computer. Again if you are on DHCP then just slect Automatically via DHCP otherwise give yourself like " MYcompuer.mlocaldomain.local". Under Miscelleneous Section if you are on DHCP then dont' touch but if you need to connect to a ISP providing static IP Connection then you have to give all details provided by your ISP or your LAN admin. If not sure leave them can be configured after installtion. Now Press "NEXT" to move further.  14. Firewall Configuration Her you can choose what level of security you need. High , medium or Nothing. Medium is good. secondly chose the device which is local net etc. ie. if you are on LAN and your lan device is eth0 then eth0 is trusted device. Thirdly choose incoming request you want to allow ie. if you want to run a webserver then you should tick the www (http) to allow incoming and then same for other options.Lastly if you run special services which needs specific porst then you have to give its port No. in other porst section. Now press "NEXT" to continue.  15. Additional Language Support: If you want to install additional language other than what we choose in begining you can select here. If you chose three languages in total then you have to define that what will the default for your system. This section is quite simple so press "NEXT" when you get it configured.  16. Time Zone Selection: Just select the time zone in which your region falls by moving mouse over the Map and make that it has selected the right one by checking the list below the map . Now press "NEXT" to another step.  17. Set Root Password : This option is important. It ask you to set up your root password which will be required to do system maintainance, installation as well as to log first time. After setting the password press "NEXT"  18. Package Default options: Here depending upon what installation you chose it will show you little details with two option a. Accept the current package List , b. customize the set of packages to be installed. If you choose a. it will on pressing "NEXT" will tell you that now it is ready to install then again pressing the "NEXT" will begin the actuall copying (installtion). IF you chose b. then after pressing "NEXT" you will be give opportunity to select individually what software (packages) you want. Just give this place a good time and explore all the packages if it is your first time and then decide which you want to evalutate, select those. It will also display the size of install on the lower right corner as No. of package you add or remove. If you choose "Select Indiavidual packages" then you will further get a choice to select at more deep level the package you want then PRess "NEXT" and it will tell you that it is ready to install , onl pressing "NEXT" again it will start actuall installtion (Copying).  19. Now you will see the Progress installtion. It will take some time. In between it might ask you to provide cd 2 and then cd 3 just put the cds in drive and then press OK.  20. Boot Floppy CreationNow your Installation is almost over, It will now ask you to create boot floppy, You should create floopy for the case if anything goes wrong.. just put in the floppy and press "Creat boot disk" ! If every thing goes fine then after making boot floppy remove it. Now press "NEXT"  21. Graphical Interface (X) Configuration : Here we will configure the Video card of our system. It shows the list of various cards manufacturer.It mostly autoprobes.. ie. automatically find the right driver for your card , if not so then just find out your card manufacturer and the card model from the list. Then select how much video RAM your card have llike 8 MB, 16 MB,32 or so on. If your card is not listed in the list then you have rather bad time. Try to select a card which matches your chipset or either find driver for your card and then configure that after installation. But best is if you don't find your card manufacturer then set it to generic or default.  22. Monitor Configuration : It shows list of monitors.. If your monitor is probed right. ie. it shows the right make and model for your monitor the press "NEXT". If it is unable to probe write make then search it is in list. If it is there then OK. otherwise found Manul for your monitor and enter the currect Horizontal Sync and Vertical Sync rate. If you are not sure about it then just press "Restore Original Values". Now press "NEXT".  23. Customize Graphic Configuration Here we will set resolution, login mode etc. Here it will ask you the color depth. leave it as it is unless you want it change, also don't change resolution. Now it will ask you that what type of login you want -- Text or Graphical ? In text it will lead you to command line on startup then you have to give username and password then if you want you can start X systm by typing "startx". It is recommonded here to use graphical login (like windows). Press "NEXT"  24. Ah. Now the Installation is fully complete. It will now ask you to prepare for boot and will remove installation media ie CD, so take out cd from cd drive and reboot. It will now show Choices of the OS to be loaded .. If you choose Linux it will start Linux and if you choose windows it will start windows.  Lastly if you don't know now what to do with Redhat after installation .. then just explore it and try to do your daily routine work with then you will get the Power of Linux .. And if get stuck anywhere ask us at this forum.  ------  btw by RedHat Linux and Linux, I actually referred GNU/LINUX (The OS), here. :)

         To recover the root password Follow the instructions:  If you're using GRUB, then, as GRUB loads up, highlight the Red Hat Linux entry on the GRUB menu and then press [E] to edit the boot configuration. Locate the following line, something that looks like this:        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-0.70 root=LABEL=/hdc=ide-scsi       Type the number '1' at the end. Doing so boots the PC into run level 1-single user mode, where you're automatically logged in as root. This done, type 'passwd' at the prompt. You can enter a new password here.        ...............................................       Remember that since it's so easy to recover a boot password, you need to physically secure your machine if you don't want someone else using your computer as root.   :) enjoy.....

         It some times happen that we have forgot the GRUB password and we need to crack it ...      To break the GRUB start-up password, follow the steps given below:      1. Boot the system with the first Linux CD. At the boot prompt, type linux rescue to switch to rescue mode. In rescue mode you will be asked if similar steps should be followed, which need to be followed in the installation. Once you get the # prompt, type the following command:      # chmod /mnt/sysImage       2. Edit the grub.conf file and remove the passwd line from the file. Save the file and exit.       3. Once your machine reboots, you will be able to start your Linux OS in the usual manner.   :) enjoy.....

       Scenario : There are two pcs. one is connected directly to internet and you wish to have another one too. You can use Squid - Proxy for that. But there is another  smart way to do the same. yes use, IPTABLES !  :)  here is how.....    You need to have "rOOt access.  1) edit the file: /etc/sysctl.config add a 1 to the ip_forward like so:  net/ipv4/ip_forward = 1  save and close file.  2) at the prompt type:  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  Then at the prompt again type:  /etc/init.d/iptables save or service iptables save  Restart the network services, like so:  /etc/init.d/network restart or service network restart  All this is done on the firewall machine.  The eth0 is the network interface pointing to the Internet not your local network  This will let all pc on the local net to get online and the main pc will masquerade the internal IP address to look like the request is comming from the firewall pc.  :) enjoy....

      A Brief Description  The world offers a number of computer operating systems; in fact, they've never been so abundant. Big names like Apple's MacOS and Microsoft's Windows have been dominant for a long time, but there is an important emerging operating system called GNU/Linux. After the initial hype of 3-4 years ago, GNU/Linux is spreading like wildfire across the globe, silently yet successfully.  One of the most important aspects of GNU/Linux is the huge community of developers working on it. This incredible development force is made possible by the concept of open source, or free software, which allows thousands of highly skilled developers throughout the world to create and build software quickly and efficiently.  As a result, GNU/Linux has quickly become one of the most promising operating systems available. Not only has GNU/Linux proven its superiority in the server field as a robust and efficient system, it has also greatly matured as a full-featured desktop alternative. So why are more and more users - individuals and corporations - using these strange free software products instead of traditional equivalents from the proprietary world?  First of all, GNU/Linux is valued as a high-performance operating system due to its modular nature - entire portions of the operating system can be easily added or removed to greatly affect performance. Additionally, GNU/Linux now supports most PC hardware devices, including even the "latest and greatest" products. GNU/Linux's extensive range of features has increased dramatically over the past few years. GNU/Linux is certainly not a computer hobbyist's plaything anymore; it's becoming more and more difficult to find areas that it cannot handle. Finally, the commercial offerings based around Linux have dramatically improved, including certification, training, support, and deployment of complex solutions.  --- To be Contd. ---

      There are many ways of contributing to Free Software movement other than just hacking on the codes.Lets take a look at how you can make a difference.  REPORTING BUGS AND ENHANCEMENTS:  Users feedback is necessery and indispensible too. If you find any bugs in the software you arer using or if you wish to have a feature added in future, you can report it tin the bug section of the concerrned website. some software also have inbuilt bug tracking/reporting tools for your convenience, you can also use them too.  CREATIVE WORKS:  If you are good enough in artwork or creating multimedia stuffs, you can do a lots of works for this movement. Create logos, icons, graphics, wallpapers and above all themes to make Free software and related websites  more attractive and userfriendly.  SOFTWARE LOCALISATION: You can promote your mother toungue in computing task and vice versa. Make regional users use computers without learning English. Localise not only the software but also the manuals, help files and even the website too.So that people can take the advantage of these software without any English terms.  ADVOCACY:   Encourage others to use Free software and make then informed about the alternatives offered for available Proprietary  software. Also abouts the advantages of using Free software. Thus you can make not only a community of Free software  users but also a community of active contributors of Free software Movements.  FINANCIAL and RESOURCE HELP:  Donating money to the authors of various Free software, you are using, can also help this movement to grow rapidly. Because it willl make them satisfied that someone really thinks that their software is worthy.  You can also donate Hardware to the projects and to your local GNU/Linux users groups can also can help them grow  in a big way.  GREAT IDEAS:  No one can guess all the needs of users. So if you have any great idea, which you think may help this movement and community to grow, feel free to discuss it on various forum or at relevent venue.   USER GROUPs : The simpliest one, gathered with some of your fellow Free software users and make a user group at  your locality or join the same.   And keep preaching for this Movement.

      A better question is how do software companies get away with charging so much? Software is not like making a car. Once you've made one copy of your software, the production costs to make a million more are tiny (there's a good reason Microsoft has so many billions in the bank).

      why would people spend hours of their own time to write software, carefully package it, and then give it all away? The answers are as varied as the people who contribute. Some people like to help others. Many write programs to learn more about computers. More and more people are looking for ways to avoid the inflated price of software. A growing crowd contribute as a thank you for all the great free software they've received from others. Many in academia create free software to help get the results of their research into wider use. Businesses help maintain free software so they can have a say in how it develops -- there's no quicker way to get a new feature than to implement it yourself! Of course, a lot of us just find it great fun.

      Tutorial : Redhat 9 Intallation step by step Tutorial / How to Distro specific : Redhat 9 ( also works for 7.1-8 ) Skill level: Newbie Time for procedure : Depends upon machine and user. Prerequestic: Should know what is operationg system. Basic knowledge of computing. Redhat 9 installation Cds. A latest computer with atleast 128 MB RAM (256 MB Recommended) CDROM drive and more than 400 MHZ of CPU power.  Author's Note: Again.. After lots of question about installing of Redhat 9 I decided to write this step by step tutorial / how to. I feel little late as Fedora core 1 is officially launched but still I found people asking question about how to install Linux Redhat 9. I have decided to write this ask people hesitate to install linux for first time because they are not sure whether it is safe for their current OS data ( M$ windoz or any other OS ) So before discussing how to install , step by step method I like to give some introduction about dual boot concept.  What is Dual booting : When we say dual booting we mean having more than once OS on same machine. Only one Operating System can run at once. It makes you feel like you are having two or more differnet system as you differnet OS. We can have more than two operating system on a machine, ie. you can have 3 or 4 OS on same machine. When we make a dual booting usually (if not chosen to boot from cd or floppy) we get the choice on startup that which OS you want to boot to ( start ). It is handled by a bootloader which take care after your choice to load which OS. Linux bootloader ( GRUB , Lilo ) has ability to boot Linux as well as all other known available operating system. Although you can use Windows bootloader also ( see Booting Linux from Windows bootloader ) but that is little advance.  Common Questions about dual boot : a. Can I access windows partition from Linux , vice-versa.? Ans : Yes you can access windows partition from Linux, Infact already answered several times (Use search feature at LinuxSolved.com to find your answer). But to access linux partition from windows you will need some software like explorer2fs used to access linux from windows.  b. Do it ( Linux Installation ) will cause data loss ? Ans : If you follow this tutorial correctly then there will be no loss.  c. Can I have triple boot ? Ans : yes you can have.  d. What about partition ? Ans : See Preparation & Requirements and also step No. 10 & 11. directly.  e. My question is not answered here..!! Ans : please post your specific query to get detailed answer.  Preparation & RequirementsI suggest you to have atleast 6 GB of free space or a empty 6 GB of partition. You can actually install RH on less than 1 GB of space when only server is chosen. If you are using MS windows 98, XP, 2000, ME and have a partition which is around 6 GB then all you need is to empty that partition by moving its data to ( if data is important ) other drive or else leave it as it is if data is not important ( not to be preserved ). Although you can choose any of the windows partition to install linux ( that partition will be not available for windows) ie. D:, E:, F: but I suggest you to choose the last ( here F: ) for easier and hassle free install. In the case you don't have separate partition ie. on big partition then I suggest you to use utitlity like partition magic to resize your current partition and then create New partition for Linux.(If you are planning to install linux on separate hard drive then no need to read about partitions. Also keep a floopy disk handy in the case if it is required.  Installation Step by Step  1. Get Linux CDS. ( here we assume that you have proper bootable Redhat 9 cds with you or you have downloaded images and then burnt into cdroms )  2. Now make sure that your computer is set to boot from CDROM ( It is done through BIOS ). Insert your Redhat 9 CD-1 and boot off of your computer from it.  3. Now it will show screen showing few options.. ( Redhat Linux 9 ) and a RED HAT of course . Press Enter to through graphical installtion ( We are not using text installation here ). It will now ask various things which will be described in separate steps further.  4. In this step it will ask you to have a Media check to make sure that medium of your installation is safe ( I suggest to do media check ). To test CDs navigate using tab and select "OK" by pressing Enter then it will show a screen asking you to start test using "TEST" button or change cd using "EJECT CD" Button. So test the current cd press "TEST" and to test another select "EJECT CD" then change cd and put another cd to check. The checking process is little longer takes around 5 minz to 15 minz , if you cds are fine then it will show test results as "PASS" and you can continue other wise "FAILED" you can continue but you should never continue b'coz it wil cause trouble later in installtion. Try to clean you cd in the case of "FAILED" and do the test again, if again failed then don't install , get another media (New CDs). If result is "PASS" then select "CONTINUE" to install the Linux.  5. Welcome Note: After this it will load the Redhat Graphical installer. ( may take few minutes to load ) then i will show a "Welcome Screen". It has basically 2 parts a. Left : Showing online help, b. Middle+Right part: The actually action place. Now press "Next" to continue either by mouse or using Tab + enter for navigation from keyboard.  6. Language Selection: In this step it will ask you for the your preffered language ( Mostly english ) So select your language and press "NEXT" to move to next part.  7. Keyboard Configuration: Here it ask that which type of keyboard you use (Mostly U.S. English) then press "NEXT" to move to next step.  8. Mouse Configuration: This step is to configure your mouse. Most of the time it automatically detects the right mouse but if it has not just see if your mouse manufacturer name is there if yest then select appropriate model by expending the list and you are unable to find manufacturer or model then from generic select the the mouse which suits you mouse best.If you have serial mouse then select your devive to which it is connected. (/dev/ttyS0 if COM port 1 of windows, ttyS1 if COM port 2 of windows and so on). If you have 2 button mouse then select Emulate 3 buttons option which will make your mouse three button when you press your both button at same time . Now press "NEXT" to continue.  9. Installation Type: In this step first it will search for previous linux (Redhat Linux )installation. If you have one then it will ask you either upgrade or fresh install. BTW.. this tutorial is for fresh install becaue you are installing for first time. Now after searching when it don't find any previous installtion then it will show you 4 choices all consist of differnet sets of package of software as the name of choice suggest (Also well describe there) a. Personal Desktop b. Workstation c. Server d. Custom Choose the type of installation you want and then press "NEXT" (type of installation you need depends upon your requirements I choose "PERSONAL DESKTOP")  10. Disk Partitioning Setup: Here it will ask that Do you need manul or automatic partition to be done. Select "Automatically Partition" for automatic partition or Select "Manually Parition with Disk Druid" for manual partition. Now here becuase it will get bigger and complicated so I suggest you to choose "Mannually partition usin Disk druid" b'coz it will be easier in all the cases. Now press "NEXT" to move to next step.  11. Partitioning: It is the most important step for Newbies. Be careful and read every thing with patience. Go for either part a. or part b. as per your conditions. Now you are with a graphical utility which shows all the current partition on your hardisk or hardisks ( if you have more than one hd). Please don't bother for LVM and RAID thing over here those are advance stuff. a. Installing on separate physical drive If you are installtion Linux on second hardrive (primary slave) then it is called hdb in linux and first primary master is called hda so others are call hdc, hdd. Say you are installing on drive hdb then select it.Now press "NEW" from Menu bar above the table. It will show a dialog box with lots of option, just select mount point and give size then press Ok.So Creat a partition with mount ponit "/boot" around 100 mb press "OK" if it shows any error then just Press "CONTINUE", create root parition with mount point "/" of atleast 6 GB as suggested. Make a Swap partition of around 300-500 MB ( I suggest 300 MB) by choosing file system type as SWAP then mount point will not be required. Also you can creat other partition like "/home" whose size depends on the No. of users who are going to use the computer. Bigger size more flexibility. Press "NEXT" to continue.  b.Installing on Differnet partition same drive : When you are going to install Linux on differnet partition on same drive then follow the following steps. ( You should have either free space around 6 GB or a parition of 6 GB or more). I assume that you have 10 GB of Windows partition (FAT32) which was the drive F: under windows. NOTE: Partitions in linux are devoted by hda1 , hda2 ie. hda1 means fist drive's first partition , hda2 means first drive's second partition, hdb1 means second drive's first partition. Now locate your windows partition or free space you want to use for linux. To do so I have windows Last parition for LInux ie. F: so i looked for the last partition in the table which I found to be hda7. (If you choose a partition which is not last then find it by its size. And if all your parition are of same size the always choose last parition to install linux.) Now I found hda7 for linux then select and press "DELETE" in the Menu to delete that now it will become free space. ( If you have free space already then you should start partitioning from here ) . Now press "NEW" from Menu bar above the table. It will show a dialog box with lots of option, just select mount point and give size then press "OK" you can also change file system but just keep it "ext3" only. So we are now going to create only 4 partitions.. root ("/") 6 GB (6144 MB), boot ("/boot") 75 MB, ("/home") 3759 MB and SWAP (300 MB). To do so just press "NEW" select size and "OK". Make a Swap partition of around 300-500 MB ( I suggest 300 MB) by choosing file system type as SWAP then mount point will not be required. You can also make different partition table but I have suggested above for ease of understanding. Now when you have done your partion make sure who have done work over right partition becuase after this step you can't undo that. Now press "NEXT" to continue.  12. Boot Loader Configuration This is another important step in our installation. Mostly you don't need to do anything here just press "Enter" and continue as it alwasy detect your windows. But for the sake of this tutorial I will describe this a little more. This section first allow you to choose bootloader to be GRUB or Lilo. I chose Grub over here. Next option shows that how many OS it will boot to ( here two as Winows and LInux). You can also set that which OS should boot by defualt ( automatically without your intervention ) by giving tick on the box in front of the OS name. You can also change the Display name of the OS over here by selection and the pressing "EDIT". Also you can set bootloader password ( not necessary ). Here make sure your boot loader is getting installed on "/dev/hda" because we are going to use linux bootloader as the default bootloader. Now press "Next" to move to Network configuration. In the case you want to do advance stuff ( Like requried by our tutorial about Starting Linux from widnows bootloader ) then select "configure advance bootloader option" and Press "NEXT" then it will show advance option like want to install bootloader on /dev/hda or first sector of linux root partition (here /dev/hda7) then press "NEXT" to move to network configuration.  13. Network Configuration: This is important for network users, people on LAN etc. But also eqully important for general user. It shows you fisrt option with List of all network devices in your comptuer. I have a Single LAN card as eth0 (if more than one lan card then eth0, eth1, eth2 and so on.) which will be need to configure via DHCP. So I chose to configure via DHCP . In the case if you want your machine as server or it is connected to a LAN or ISP which needs static ip address then you have to select your network device and then press "EDIT" to set its option ie.. configure via dhcp or static IP address then PREss "OK" to close the dialog box. Now other option is to set HOstname of your computer. Again if you are on DHCP then just slect Automatically via DHCP otherwise give yourself like " MYcompuer.mlocaldomain.local". Under Miscelleneous Section if you are on DHCP then dont' touch but if you need to connect to a ISP providing static IP Connection then you have to give all details provided by your ISP or your LAN admin. If not sure leave them can be configured after installtion. Now Press "NEXT" to move further.  14. Firewall Configuration Her you can choose what level of security you need. High , medium or Nothing. Medium is good. secondly chose the device which is local net etc. ie. if you are on LAN and your lan device is eth0 then eth0 is trusted device. Thirdly choose incoming request you want to allow ie. if you want to run a webserver then you should tick the www (http) to allow incoming and then same for other options.Lastly if you run special services which needs specific porst then you have to give its port No. in other porst section. Now press "NEXT" to continue.  15. Additional Language Support: If you want to install additional language other than what we choose in begining you can select here. If you chose three languages in total then you have to define that what will the default for your system. This section is quite simple so press "NEXT" when you get it configured.  16. Time Zone Selection: Just select the time zone in which your region falls by moving mouse over the Map and make that it has selected the right one by checking the list below the map . Now press "NEXT" to another step.  17. Set Root Password : This option is important. It ask you to set up your root password which will be required to do system maintainance, installation as well as to log first time. After setting the password press "NEXT"  18. Package Default options: Here depending upon what installation you chose it will show you little details with two option a. Accept the current package List , b. customize the set of packages to be installed. If you choose a. it will on pressing "NEXT" will tell you that now it is ready to install then again pressing the "NEXT" will begin the actuall copying (installtion). IF you chose b. then after pressing "NEXT" you will be give opportunity to select individually what software (packages) you want. Just give this place a good time and explore all the packages if it is your first time and then decide which you want to evalutate, select those. It will also display the size of install on the lower right corner as No. of package you add or remove. If you choose "Select Indiavidual packages" then you will further get a choice to select at more deep level the package you want then PRess "NEXT" and it will tell you that it is ready to install , onl pressing "NEXT" again it will start actuall installtion (Copying).  19. Now you will see the Progress installtion. It will take some time. In between it might ask you to provide cd 2 and then cd 3 just put the cds in drive and then press OK.  20. Boot Floppy CreationNow your Installation is almost over, It will now ask you to create boot floppy, You should create floopy for the case if anything goes wrong.. just put in the floppy and press "Creat boot disk" ! If every thing goes fine then after making boot floppy remove it. Now press "NEXT"  21. Graphical Interface (X) Configuration : Here we will configure the Video card of our system. It shows the list of various cards manufacturer.It mostly autoprobes.. ie. automatically find the right driver for your card , if not so then just find out your card manufacturer and the card model from the list. Then select how much video RAM your card have llike 8 MB, 16 MB,32 or so on. If your card is not listed in the list then you have rather bad time. Try to select a card which matches your chipset or either find driver for your card and then configure that after installation. But best is if you don't find your card manufacturer then set it to generic or default.  22. Monitor Configuration : It shows list of monitors.. If your monitor is probed right. ie. it shows the right make and model for your monitor the press "NEXT". If it is unable to probe write make then search it is in list. If it is there then OK. otherwise found Manul for your monitor and enter the currect Horizontal Sync and Vertical Sync rate. If you are not sure about it then just press "Restore Original Values". Now press "NEXT".  23. Customize Graphic Configuration Here we will set resolution, login mode etc. Here it will ask you the color depth. leave it as it is unless you want it change, also don't change resolution. Now it will ask you that what type of login you want -- Text or Graphical ? In text it will lead you to command line on startup then you have to give username and password then if you want you can start X systm by typing "startx". It is recommonded here to use graphical login (like windows). Press "NEXT"  24. Ah. Now the Installation is fully complete. It will now ask you to prepare for boot and will remove installation media ie CD, so take out cd from cd drive and reboot. It will now show Choices of the OS to be loaded .. If you choose Linux it will start Linux and if you choose windows it will start windows.  Lastly if you don't know now what to do with Redhat after installation .. then just explore it and try to do your daily routine work with then you will get the Power of Linux .. And if get stuck anywhere ask us at this forum.  ------  btw by RedHat Linux and Linux, I actually referred GNU/LINUX (The OS), here.

      Free Software model, implemented in linuxjunkies.org  at LINUXjunkies foundation, what we are doing is, we are trying to reach more and more people with GNU/LINUX and other Free software.  Now the problem is, people are accustomed to proprieatary software in such a big way that they prefer to use pirated copies. The reason of this are many. Among them some use these s/w because they think, there is no alternative. The reason of this are:  1.they donot aware of the alternatives. 2.they are not well informed about Free software movement.   some others know that there is a alternative but they face mainly two problem to adopt this free alternatives.  1. They don't know, where to get those. 2. There is no proper and vast training on those   As if we talk about any Computer training facility in West Bengal, whether it's govt. or Private, everybody's curricullaum for beginners contains MS Windows and MS office. So the people never know that there is a Free option.   And on GNU/LINUX, here is a perception that this is tough to install and tough to use. and not only that this is made for programmers and not for the home users. Again here is the same reason of this. Everybody, whether it's the Computer education institutes or Local vendors or local assemblers, everybody are indirectly discouraging people not to adopt GNU/LINUX and Free software by providing them pirated copies of Proprietary s/w and also by hiding the info on the Free software.  To tackle these barriers we have to adopt a simple method.  We have to provide not only the Free software but also the services, rahter i say solutions for them.  We can divided our target people on 4 sections.( keeping West Bengal in the mind )  1. General home users 2. General Students 3. Students of IT and computer Sc. 4. business houses    We will provide them Free software and related solution, from Installation and deploymenet to Training and Education.it may be Free ( Free as Beer) at the beginning and may be paid after some times.  Here are some most probable scenario, in which we can provide organized solutions :  1.people may approach to us with an inquiry such as: "We like the software, but can you make it do xxxx ?" Examples are porting the software to a new platform or adding a particular feature. And We will respond to such inquiry by quoting a price for adding the desired functionality. The parties will typically sign a contract detailing the work to be done, the timetable, and a price, generally fixed, to be paid for the work.  2.Another successful model is to sell yearly support contracts. They are similar to the support contracts sold by many vendors for non-free software, and provides fairly comprehensive service--in particular both assistance using the software (typically by telephone or email) and fixing bugs. By having a fixed yearly price rather than charging for each problem resolution, the free software method has an incentive to maintain a quality product (in those areas that customers care about). However, many users find that such contracts are too expensive. They don't expect to need a lot of bug-fixing and assistance. For example, they might be willing to work around bugs rather than get them fixed.  3.A support offering which may be more appropriate for some people is telephone support. This is may be priced per-minute or per-call, allowing people to use the service with no big financial commitment. This service is often most useful for people seeking assistance but also could encompass bug-fixing, at least for some kinds of bugs.It is probably not as profitable as the more expensive yearly support contracts, but seems to be viable.  4.Training classes are a method which is well-established at least for non-free software. Classes may be located at the users's site or our site. Classes typically have a standard curriculum.  5.Another well established method,is hourly consulting or customization. The people will have us come in, look at the their use of the software, and offer advice, help set up the software in a way that matches the their needs, or write software to meet a specific need. The most common arrangement is that the peopel receives ownership of any software produced.   To encourage people to adopt more and more Free software, we must ensure that the software must be easily available. Wide distribution of software is must. Wide distribution also promotes word of mouth marketing. The more people who are using the software, even if they are not people who are interested in the services of the free software at the time, the more likely that it will spread to people who will use those services. To meet this goal, we have to distribute publicly, free software CDs for very cheap rate or even Free ( free as beer). Along with this we also have to provide tutorials to them. This my be done offline by arranging InstallFest/seminars or may be online through websites.   We believe that, most of us use pirated and propreitary s/w, without knowing the fact that there is a Free alternative to this. and to make them aware of this we have not only to provide them free software but also training and most importnat solution to them.

      Basically is due to two reasons: First of all software owners have to update to the software, even if there is no reason to interest in doing so. Otherwise they risk facing a situation where there programs are not capable to process documents and files, created by newer versions of the same product. The second coercion to upgrade evolving from this dependent situation is the ending support of 'older' version.  This situation has thus major consequences for the cost side of IT management. Additionally for the costs for new licenses and update implementation, software users constantly have to be trained in new program versions. User performance in the phase after the implementation of the software always decreases. On the hardware side this dependency leads to an increase of expenditure.

      Problem that is more often faced by the user is that they cant come out of the proprietary model software. Since the standards of proprietary software are normally not open, it is hard for competitors -be they for profit or non-profit, proprietary or FREE Software – to ensure that their software is able to process data produced by proprietary software (e.g. Graphs or tables in word processors). By their dominant market position, proprietary software vendors thereby enforce a kind of de facto standard, e.g. On office software, which then – despite and because of the fact being closed – enhances the vendors, market position. This is of course a self-enforcing process. Whenever the proprietary standard are established the necessity to 'follow' them is given. Even in an open tender acquisition system, this requirement for compatibility with proprietary standards makes the system based towards specific software vendors, perpetuating a dependency.  --Contd...

      Another distinctive advantage of GNU/Linux and free software applications, maybe the most important, is that software is designed and created for users by users. In the traditional software industry, new features are introduced by a software company solely because the company thinks it will be a good idea, perhaps as the result of a marketing survey. In the GNU/Linux world, the approach is totally different: users request new features and free software developers implement them. The resulting products and features answer real needs, which is really the purpose of designing and building software in the first place.

      Another key advantage of GNU/Linux is that it includes only open technologies based on public standards (when available). This means that GNU/Linux is always a smart choice because the included technology is very likely to already be a standard in the IT world - technology that is compatible and interoperable with other operating systems. With GNU/Linux, you will never become a prisoner of technology as often happens in the Windows and Macintosh worlds.  For example, with GNU/Linux it's very easy to communicate over a network with just about any other computer platform, with various protocols, such as for exchanging data files. Even in the office productivity field GNU/Linux is rapidly gaining superiority with its OpenOffice and KOffice office suites, which understand a number of different office file formats, including MS Office documents.  On the other hand, the way that GNU/Linux and its applications are developed and produced ensures that it's very perennial because in the free software world, even if a software project is abandoned by its original authors, there is always someone, or even a new team of developers, willing to maintain and release new versions of the software.  --To be Contd...

         Many times i see people asking this question in diferent forums ans mailing list...      Here  i have tried to answer to this... correct me if  i am wrong... :)      Under the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000, the act of port scanning does not amount to hacking.              which is defined as:              "Whoever with the intent to cause or knowing that he is likely to cause wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person destroys or deletes or alters any information residing in a computer resource or diminishes its value or utility or affects it injuriously by any means, commits hacking."              The essential elements of hacking are                 1. Intention or Knowledge          2. Wrongful Loss to Public or Person          3. Deletion / Alteration / Destruction or          4. Diminishes Value or Utility              of information iesiding in a computer resource              Port Scanning will satisfy the first requirement of Knowledge or Intention.             But the second essential is not met, as port scanning does not necessarily cause any wrongful loss. E.g. if a network administrator, scans his own network for security reasons, then he will not intend to create any wrongful loss.             Also, all the other elements of hacking are also not invoked as port scanning merely scans the crust of the network without affecting any information resource residing within it.             Thus Port Scanning definitely does not attract the offence of 'hacking', unless it is used by a cracker, with the intention to crack the system, and in conjunction with any other tool that actually changes any information that resides in the computer.              so enjoy and explore the knowledge.               ** Please Note that    Most ISP's internet starter packs also include a printed manual. It clearly mentions that they dont expect you to not indulge in anything like portscanning, as the traffic goes from the ISP's server. **       --- Source : Indian Information Technology Act, 2000 ---       ---- i used the word "hacking/hacker" to go on with the definition of indian cyber law. Though i strongly believe that there is a difference between hackers and crackers.

      How many times have you had to send the same letter to several different people?  Was it important to have each letter customized for each individual you were sending it too?  Wouldn't it have been easier to let the computer change the necessary text, instead of having to do it by hand?  This procedure, called mail merging, is a simple process to do using OpenOffice.org. Save yourself some time, while still making your recipients feel special, by following these simple steps.:  The first thing you'll have to do is create a simple spreadsheet, using OpenOffice.org's Calc.  Open up a new spreadsheet and start typing column headings in row 1 of the sheet. Each column heading will represent the different, customized element within your letter that you're going to create.  In the rows 2, 3, 4, etc., enter the unique information for each recipient of your letter for each element specified in row 1.  Once that is done, save your spreadsheet. Make a note of what you named your spreadsheet and which directory you saved it under. You can now close Calc.   Open up OpenOffice.org Writer and start composing the letter to send to everyone you included in the spreadsheet.  Wherever you require a customized field (later take from your spreadsheet), mark it's place by using an asterisk ( * ),  Once your letter is completed, save it to your hard drive.  Now's the time to import your data from the spreadsheet you created. From within Writer, click on Tools (from the menu at the top of the screen) and then Data Sources.  This is where you tell Writer the file that contains the mail merge data to use.   A window, like the one shown here will appear. If you have not already specified data sources, the left hand column window will be empty.  Click on the New Data Sources button. Next to Name (to the right of the window), give your data source a name. In my example, I've given the name contacts.  Next to Database type click on the scroll button and find the Spreadsheet selection option.  To finish up, next to Data source URL click on the . . . button and find the spreadsheet you created earlier in the directory tree. When you're all done, click on OK.   You're almost there. Now, from the menu at the top of the Writer window, click on View and then Data Sources.  This will produce a window called the Beamer window. It is most likely that this new window is covering up some of the window that's containing your document.  Click on the little icon of a thumb tack on the bottom frame of the Beamer window. That should allow you to see your document as well as the Beamer information.   Your Beamer window should like something like this. In the left hand window, expand the directory tree (click on the + signs) to display your table containing the data to be mail-merged, as I have done here.  It's now time to replace the asterisk in your letter with the data from your data source.  Click on the first column heading in the spreadsheet you created. In my example, this would be the block labeled Hero's Name. Holding down your left-mouse button, drag the block down into your letter and release it next to the appropriate asterisk. Repeat this step for each heading in your data table, everywhere you require this data to appear in your letter. Like this...   Once you've gotten all of the data field properly represented in your letter, click on the little icon in your Beamer window that looks like a stack of envelopes (it's the second-last icon on the right). This will bring up the Form Letter window. If you wish to have each of the letters (for each entry in the spreadsheet) printed, leave the output set to Printer and click on OK.  If you'd rather have the letters created then saved to your hard drive for printing later, click on the bullet labeled File then click on OK.  That's it! Now, each letter will have the unique information that you've specified for each individual, and you've just saved yourself allot of extra work.    :)

        Writer handles a few tasks differently, though, like the examples listed below. Here's how to deal with them:          Word count:  Go to File and click on Properties and Statistics, you'll see the word count.           Highlighting:   Change a highlighting color or un-highlight something by right clicking on the Highlight icon. Hold the pressure down for a moment, and a selection of colors appears.           Fonts:   OpenOffice gives you a decent selection, without getting extravagant like MS Office. OpenOffice offers the key ones such as Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Courier New, Garamond and Tahoma.           Finding features:   OpenOffice lists most features in the same place as MS Office, but not all. For example: You'll find templates in the File menu, tables in the Insert menu and collaboration features in the Edit menu.           Numbering/font corruption:   Anyone who's ever used Word is familiar with hassles with numbering and fonts. For instance, you cut and paste text into a document and then as you edit the document, the fonts change, the text goes bold and so on. OpenOffice reduces this confusion significantly, and also cuts down on trouble related to automatic numbering sequences.              Paste:   One problem with Writer is that when you paste text from the Web into a document, it automatically puts it in a separate box. There's probably a workaround for it, but I haven't found it yet.
