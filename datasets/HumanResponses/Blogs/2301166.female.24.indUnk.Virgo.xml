      I found out today that amidst the chaos of my moving house, some poor and pathetic bastard nicked me bin!  Can you believe it, it's a bloody rubbish bin for crying out loud! MY bloody rubbish bin! It also happened to contain a bottle of mortein for roaches, which I had planned on using to eradicate the roach population at my new place. More importantly, placed on the top was a pair of shorts I had borrowed from a friend. There is nothing worse than losing someone elses belongings whilst they are in your care. I'll have to get her a new pair now. Damn chinatown cheapskates!

      It's February 29th! This date only comes once every 4 years so I have to post something, anything!  Time for a little reminiscing. The last time it was February 29th, I was starting 3rd year uni, not believing that I had made it so far without flunking any subjects (not counting those conceded passes, ok). I was still living at Mulwaree with the MSO bunch, about to encounter the killer OS class which I so dearly loved. End reminiscence.  On a totally unrelated note, can I just say how annoying it is to receive missed calls on your mobile from people not in your address book. I normally just ignore the numbers, but curiosity got the better of me this time.  Just then, I decided to ring back one of the missed call numbers I got during the week. On the other end was an answering machine for either the  death  or the  health  society. The women was way too soft and I could hardly hear anything. Whatever it was, I had no idea, which just frustrated me even more, because now I have to ring back again during business hours to find out why they tried to ring me!  There was another missed call which I received today, from an 08 number. I haven't had any 08 calls since, like, 1.5 leap years back. This was back in the days when I didn't even own a mobile. I will leave that question mark for next week maybe.

      As unhealthy as this may sound, I had a hot dog for breakfast this morning.  This hot dog, topped with ketchup and mustard, suddenly got me thinking,  "God, I used to hate mustard, when did I change my mind about it and why do I love it so now?"   I then went on thinking about all the other things I used to hate, but now love, and things I used to love, but now hate. There are also things I used to feel strongly about, which don't seem to matter much anymore. It really disturbs me that people can change. I'm a firm believer of the fact that no matter how people change, they are still the same person deep down inside.  So I decided to list down all my  changes  as I discover them. I shall start with the mustard.  I used to whinge in disgust whenever  mustard  was in sight, yet now I lavish in the taste of it. Thinking about mustard makes me drool.  Then there are  tulips . My favouritest flowers in the whole wide world. I thought they were really very very special. Now when I look at them I think about how fast they are going to die compared to other flowers, like, gerberas. I like  urlLink gerberas  now.  *More coming soon

      I have a really bad habit of editing my previous posts. I just can't help myself. I keep changing my mind on what I should write about, what point I should bring forth, or what punctuation I should use etc. It's something I have to learn to stop doing.

      I've become quite fond of bus trips. You always see lots of different and interesting people. Today, there was a little boy who reminded me of sideshow bob, from the simpsons.     He had the same wacky hair and was really really, truly, adorable, and shy too! I think he must have been about 3 or so. His mother was paying for the bus fare and told him to grab a seat, but he kept on walking back and forth, wanting to sit down but not wanting to be more than a metre away from his mum. I have a feeling that he melted everyone on the bus.

      I found a pair of dead ants floating in my Brita water bottle this morning.  It must have been a titanic moment for them. You jump, I jump.  I really have to do something about my ant problem.  On a positive note, all the cockroaches have disappeared. Damn those cocky baits are good. Although I went cheapo and got the  lure n' kill  instead of the  nest kill , which meant I had to deal with dead corpses rather than have them die in the safety and peace of their own homes. So if you're ever standing in the supermarket pesticides aisle wondering which one to get, I say spend the extra five bucks and go for the  nest kill .

      I spent a good deal of today's afternoon looking at the American Idol finalists, and finally decided on a favourite.    urlLink Camile Velasco . The Hawaiian Chic.  She reminds me of Jessica Alba as far as looks go. Extremely sweet. Her voice is another matter though, soulful and powerful. I would definately buy her album, wouldn't you?

      A friend was complaining to me about the opposition party which lost the Taiwanese Elections, saying that they are sore losers and are dividing up the people in Taiwan by encouraging their supporters to go out on the streets and protest.  I kinda agreed with him at first, because things like this should be settled in the courts, like adults, not like hooligans who run around on the streets shouting offensives.  However, after reading up a little more on the whole situation. I believe that the  losers  really do not have much choice.  It is part of the Chinese culture, I guess, that if you don't make alot of noise, everyone loses interest and nothing happens.  Therefore, the only way to show that 50% of the people in Taiwan want real answers, they have to protest. They have to stand in the rain outside the presidential office, and they have to shout, chant, and make a scene. Because, well, it's the only way to get things done!  Do you try to talk sense to a potential liar and cheater? No, you beat the truth out of him.

      OK. I'm usually not into politics, but the recent Taiwanese Elections has really gotten on my nerves.  It feels as though the government is manipulating its people and treating everyone like complete morons! The sad thing is, alot of them ARE complete morons, who can't make educated decisions on their own. Yes, I fear that the government is brain-washing its stupid citizens. I really hate stupid people! But more so, I hate smart people who think everyone else is stupid and won't know what they're up to!  I believe that the issues raised in  urlLink this  article must be answered and clarified. Not everyone is stupid damnit!  The Republic is really no better than the People's Republic if holes as big as these are not filled, no?

      Amazing! My first 5-star movie, and new tags on my board! :O  I just loved Something's Gotta Give. It is such a wonderful story and I'm such a sucker for happy endings.  My fave part will have to be the bit when she finds out she's in love and she can't stop crying and laughing at the same time. Absolutely hilarious!! Highly recommended to everyone.

      I loathe and despise people who don't listen and people who can't follow instructions.   Example 1   Situation: We have a problem with the server and users can't login.   Person who can't listen (aka  ignorant bitch ) rings up.  Ignorant bitch:  "I can't login!"   Me (calm and collected):  "Yes, we are currently experiencing problems with the server and..."   Ignorant bitch (cuts me off completely):  "I was working on a file and my computer suddenly crashed. I then tried to restart the computer but nothing was responding, so I had to power down the computer and turn it back on again. It came up with the login screen which I could type my name into, but it is not recognising my password and does not let me login! I tried restarting the computer again but it still does not let me login. I... blah blah blah"   An entire minute went by with her rambling on.  Me (starting to get annoyed):  "Yes, we are currently experiencing problems with the server and users are unable to login."   Ignorang bitch:  "Is there anyway that I can get around this and login? I was planning on using the computer right now."   Me (thinking what the?!):  "No, we are currently experiencing problems with the server and users are UNABLE to login. I will let you know if there is a way around this but I don't think there is."   Ignorant bitch:  "OK. So you'll call me if there is a way around this?"   Me:  "Yes I will. Bye for now."   I never called her back.  IGNORANT BITCH - LISTEN UP!   Example 2   Situation: Student (aka  stupid idiot ) is unable to login and demands help.  Stupid idiot:  "I can't login!"   Me:  "There is a problem with the server right now and I am unable to reset your password for you. Please go to that computer there and set up a password for yourself"   Stupid idiot walks off to the computer.  Stupid idiot comes back to the helpdesk:  "I can login on that computer but not on those ones"   Me (thinking that stupid idiot is really a stupid idiot):  "OK - the server's just come back on and I will reset your password for you."   I reset his password, and hand him a piece of paper with instructions on how to login.  Stupid idiot walks off to the computer.  Stupid idiot comes back to the helpdesk, sounding  rude  now:  "I still can't login. I'm already late for my class and this happens everytime I try to login. Why do I have to spend so much time just fixing my login?!"   Me (startled):  "It looks all fine here. I will reset your password for you again. Follow the instructions I gave you and try again."   Stupid idiot looks at me, blur as hell.  Me:  "I have reset your password to be the same as your login. Follow the instructions on the piece of paper and you should be able to login."   Stupid idiot walks off to the computer. Tap tap on the keyboard.  Stupid idiot manages to login without looking at the instructions on the piece of paper, wasting a perfectly fine piece of instruction sheet as well as my time.  STUPID IDIOT - CAN'T YOU READ!

      I went to watch  The Passion of Christ  last night, the new movie by Mel Gibson about the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. I wasn't expecting much of it, but was pleasantly surprised throughout the film.  Despite the fact that it was a little over 2 hours long, meaning that I was expecting to fall asleep, I think it was really quite captivating. This is possibly due to the fact that it wasn't in English and I had to keep reading the subtitles to keep with the story.  What I got out of it was that Jesus died a painful death for what he believed in.  They portrayed him as very much the good son, growing up a happy child with his mother Mary. The saddest bits are when he is suffering and he looks at his mother, and there is nothing she can do for her son.  By the way, they got a hunky actor to play Jesus. He had an extremely pretty face and was very well-built too. Meanwhile the other disciples were say, a little less prettier, than Jesus. Damn Hollywood.   I wish there were more people like Jesus as portrayed by the film. Good-looking, well-built, strong both mentally and physically, honest, faithful, with integrity and straight as an arrow. Purrr-fect!

      If there's one thing that can be said about me for a fact, it would have to be this.  I sleep, alot.  I have been lethargic since the day I was born.  Looking back at pics of me when I was a child. I'm usually asleep in the stroller while the rest of my family is smiling happily into the camera lens.  I remember falling asleep during my piano lessons which my uncle took me to. I remember falling asleep on the scooter which he took me home on nearly causing an accident. Yes, I kind of fell off.  I remember falling asleep on the bus, on my mum's right shoulder while she desperately tried to stand still, with my sister clutching at her left thigh. In the end she gave up and we took a taxi home.  I remember falling asleep in my Economics class, whilst sitting right in front of my teacher. I'm sorry Mr. Tibbit! It wasn't you. It was me.  Lately I remember falling asleep in my lectures, no lecture in particular, but all of them. It's just impossible to stay awake!  I also almost always fall asleep if I attempt to read, or watch a movie, whilst lying down on my bed.  Ahh... I do love to sleep.

      I caught the final episode of  Average Joe  in  Hawaii  on telly.  It's so anti-climax I tell ya. The super secret that she held out from everyone until the very end is that she used to date  Fabio . Is that really such a big deal!? I thought she was gonna tell them she used to be a he or something actually shocking.  And, she picked the musclular blondie over the intelligent brunette with an annoying accent. Figures, since she used to date Fabio.  I bought something from  urlLink L'Occitane  today. Expensive stuff, but really good.

      A mother kangaroo was dying. Beside the road they found her lying. And when beside her they did crouch, They found a joey in her pouch.  The Richards' took the young Roo home. They couldn't leave her there alone! The family reared her as a pet, And Lulu was the name she'd get.  She'd follow Len around the farm And soon became his good luck charm For when a branch fell on his head He lay unconscious - as if dead.  When Lulu saw he'd come to harm She barked and barked, to raise the alarm. The family were at once alerted, For the barking now was quite concerted.  They found her there beside her master. Did her quick response avert disaster? If Lulu had not been their guide, Perhaps he could have even died!  Such loyalty deserves great praise, Though kangaroos would rather graze. But with a medal in her paw, She'll be a legend that's for sure.  And maybe somewhere in her mind That Roo has traveled back in time And seen a human in a crouch, Lift a joey from its pouch.

      Woo! Just found an episode guide for  urlLink tales from the crypt . The one I'm talking about is season 1 #3: Dig That Cat...He's Real Gone  (Originally aired on 6/10/89).

      I made it to work on time today! After furiously hitting the snooze button for at least 60 times no less.  I think I may have a fetish for amateur horror movies. The  tales from the crypt  was on telly late last night and although I was real sleepy I managed to watch it in its entirety. It's cheaply made and the storyline sux but I enjoyed it nonetheless.   I still remember this one episode which I watched ages and ages ago about a man who had nine lives. If I remember correctly he had somehow inherited nine lives from a cat and exploited them by taking part in freak shows where he gets killed in a variety of ways. He gets buried alive in this act and it being the last time he would be able to perform a stunt (having died seven times previously), he starts recounting his nine lives while lying underground in the coffin. He counted seven deaths, then elaborated on how he had inherited the nine lives from that cat... and bam! he suddenly realises that he couldn't have inherited nine lives from the cat since the cat had already died once! So there he was, buried alive to his final death. All the kicking and screaming did nothing to help.   As per usual, the crypt keeper does his shrill laughter at the end. hee hee hee. What a story! Engraved deep within my memory for some reason.

      My manager said to me this morning,  "Now that Duncan is on leave, can you make sure that you get in by nine o'clock every morning?" .   I think what he really meant was,  "Get your lazy ass to work on time please!"    Bless him for being so nice to someone who has been late to work almost every single day. Determined not to disappoint and bring further shame onto myself, I have set my alarm clock earlier by one whole hour! Hopefully it works out tomorrow morning.  I am bored as hell. Having to read about how to price bonds is not helping...   I am also worried that if, by some miracle of God, I manage to secure a job interview, I will most likely NOT be able to attend it since I'm off on hols in exactly 10 days' time! I don't know if that's good, or bad.

      I went shopping again today. Westfield at Eastgardens this time.  I got another stack of DVD's, a couple of books and a new sweater! It looks very similar to something I already have, but I kinda liked it so I got it anyway.  Today is a public holiday but I'll have to head into work later. It's my weekend gig which I've been putting off for the last 3 weeks.  I'm also halfway through Season 1 of Sex and the City. It plays very much like a blog. Carrie must have really liked the dress she was wearing on the bus ad cuz she wore it on at least 3 other different occasions.   I like Mr. Big.

      It has been an extremely eventful weekend for me.  First of all, I am now the proud owner of all 6 seasons of Sex and the City!!  Secondly, I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2 and it was  urlLink abso-fucking-lutely  brilliant! I laughed, I cried, and everything made sense. I would have done the same for B.B.  Then, I had the cheapest steak in Sydney. $5 was all it cost me and although it's no  urlLink Ruth's Chris , it was pretty darn good and pretty darn filling.  As if that's not enough, I also visited the neighbouring Bondi Beach slash markets and checked out the new Westfield at Bondi Junction.  All in all, a tiring but rewarding weekend. Many moneys spent and much things gained. Aloha!

      After a little further investigation, it appears that the html acronym tag requires more work than is neccessary.  The alternative is to just add a title="" as part of the link tag. Same effect, less coding.  There is also the alternative of using smarty pants software such as Macromedia Dreamweaver, but my lappy top is soooo sloooow that if I run anything else other than notepad I have the urge of unplugging it from the power source and chucking it out the window.  Just a few more weeks till I get my new and improved lappy :) Definately something to look forward to.

You get 1G of space, which means you can send large attachments such as divx movies hohoho.  There should be a link when you login to your blogger.

      Just had my mid-session exam.  I finished in about an hour, and sat there for half an hour contemplating whether I should continue sitting there for another hour in frustration, or give up and leave. I eventually decided on the latter, so got up and left.  I'm pretty sure I got perfect scores for the first half the paper (the easy half), and zero for the other half. That makes for 50%. Not bad for the amount of effort I put in, heh. The shame! I had scheduled everything perfectly, but got the date of the exam wrong (refer to previous post). If only I had one more day to study, I swear I would have aced it. The ego!  Anyways, I'm glad that at least I didn't miss the exam, so I shan't complain no more.

      It's times like these that I do believe in God.  Just received a call from my course mate asking about the upcoming exam. I said to just go through the textbook questions and old quizes and it should be fine, sounding alot more confident than how I really feel since I have done jack all.  The miraculous part of the phone call is when he mentioned that the exam is tomorrow. Monday. Tomorrow.  All this while, way back from the beginning of session, I had put down in my diary that the exam is on Tuesday, the day  after  tomorrow.  Imagine if I had shown up on Tuesday, in an empty room, wondering where the heck everyone is, and failing the subject miserably because I managed to miss the exam.  I cannot thank my friend enough for ringing me, he is my saviour. I thank God too, because that's whom you thank when things like this happen.  It's also times like these that I feel the urge to blog, when I should really be studying. Tough times are these.

      Damnit! I knew I shouldn't have bought that book.  I can't stop reading it now, despite the fact that I am totally unprepared for my mid-session exam which is in 2 weeks' time and that I'm going on holidays this weekend.  Oh it is good but...  Did you know about  PHI ? The  Divine Proportion  that applies to everything in nature.  PHI = 1.618  The number of female bees divided by male bees, in any beehive in the world, is equal to PHI.  Your height from head to toe, divided by your height from belly button to toe, is equal to PHI.  Distance from your shoulder to fingertips, divided by distance from your elbow to fingertips, is also equal to PHI.  Amazing coincidence? I think not.  No, this is not a textbook. It's  The Da Vinci Code  by  Dan Brown . I think I should get paid for advertising it so much.

      I forgot how much I  lurrved  shopping. There are no words to describe the thrill of finding something you adore at a bargain price, the hours you spend rummaging through a stack pile for the right size, and the uttermost disappointment if it doesn't fit right.  Yes, that was my Sunday shopping trip in a nutshell. Turns out I also forgot how fat I am now. I brought in size  XS  to the changing room and almost had a panick attack from not being able to take off what I tried on. I still have no idea how I got the thing on me in the first place! In the process of tugging and pulling I managed to sprain my neck as well. Ouch. At least I didn't break the damn thing because I swear I heard a little ripping sound...  In the end I got a book instead.  The Da Vinci Code  by  Dan Brown . It's for my 12-hour Sydney to Melbourne bus ride on Thursday. You see, I like to plan ahead.

      I hate moving. I really do. Today I'll have to shift in the rest of my belongings which are currently in storage at a friend's house. I was hoping I didn't have to deal with this but I think they've overstayed their welcome.  My friend tells me that Willie, the family dog, fancied my mattress so much that he decided to number one on it. Now I have dog piss on my spare mattress! This isn't good news as I'm having guests over in a couple of weeks' time. It better wash out.  I have to admit I'm really worried about the rest of my stuff. This friend is known for not returning borrowed items in their original conditions. What if my doona smells or my fax machine has been dropped, or worse, my telly doesn't turn on!  Can't wait to get it over and done with now.

      I am back in Sydney and it is freakin cold in here!!  My blog is grossly outdated and I have so much shite to attend to... going on a holiday is like putting your life on hold. All the stress which evaporated when I stepped on that plane is rushing back as I speak...  I'm skipping work today, and maybe tomorrow as well, if I can.

      #1 - The shopping. The shopping here is incredible! All the branded stuff are cheap cheap cheap. We found adorable baby gap hats for under a dollar, and I got Abercrombie tops for under four dollars. Also, Reebok sweats for ten, CK undies for three, Denim jackets for fifteen... etc etc. Absolutely fabulous! This is as opposed to back home where they mark up prices before going on a sale and you can only ever find dodgy stuff which you won't want anyway.  #2 - The universities. The uni's here are beautiful. They have so much character and history. The one I am at right now (Washington University at St. Louis) is celebrating it's 150th year this year. Plus, there is always wireless and free internet. This is as opposed to back home where the campus is relatively ugly and stingy.  #3 - The entertainment. Yup, all the new movies come out here first. Nuff said. I saw Shrek 2, Troy and Van Helsing. Shrek 2 is my fave! Brad Pitt has lost his appeal to me, and Hugh Jackman isn't as good all covered up in black clothing.  Am going to check out the uni here now... it's graduation day and there are free food and drinks all about.

      My sister got hitched today and I was the maid of honour :)  Weddings are alot of work. I think when I get married, I will have a tiny little one. That is, unless I am loaded and can hire a wedding planner.  Went to a symphony after the wedding. I love strings. Strings are my fave. I think I will have 4 kids so they can form a family string quartet.  I paid special attention to the old semi-bald man who was the xylophone player. For some strange reason I always giggle to myself when I see a xylophone player. heehee.  PS. I changed my comments provider to blogger, it looked nice on globber's site so I thought I'd get it as well.

      - Experiencing all the glamour and splendor of the new Airbus A320, complete with genuine New Zealand leather seats and brushed steel arm rests. Iz better than them Boeings!  - Finally meeting the love of my life, my four-months old nephew. He is a sweet and simple soul with a dark past. I say this because he freaked me out with his non-stop crying when he had a nightmare which he couldn't wake up from.  - Catching a perfectly timed cold/flu so I can waste one whole day lying in bed doing zilch. I'm not sure if this is a highlight actually.  - Pigging out on Movenpick ice cream from Switzerland. Excellente!  - Spending quality time with the love of my life.  - Spotting   urlLink Doris Roberts   while en route at the LAX airport!  - Adjusting to jet-lag.

      I think I may be developing premature alzheimer's disease.  I've been forgetting things left right and centre, and I can't remember if I've always been this forgetful or if it's just a recent phase. I forgot if I was forgetful!  Just made a friend wait for half an hour for me. She remembered the meeting but forgot to bring my number out with her. Lucky for her she managed to get hold of someone who had my number and gave me a ring. I remembered the second that I saw her name flashing on my mobile. I wasn't late or anything, just comepletely forgot about it!  A couple of weeks back I was supposed to meet up for shopping at 10:30. I had somehow in my mind changed that time to 11:30. Consequently, I was late for an hour.  Then there's the time that I almost missed my exam, thinking that it was on Tuesday when it was actually on Monday.  HEEELP!!

      Woke up today with a terrible sore throat, and have no idea where the hell it came from. Was feeling fine yesterday and then bam! sore throat. Why why why me?! I debated with myself for a good ten minutes on whether or not I should come in to work. I did in the end, not because I'm hard working, but because I thought the money would come in handy.  There must be something going around in the office. A colleague called in sick yesterday, and I just got a call from another colleague who is home sick as well. It's the viscious cycle of germs. People really shouldn't come in to work when they're sick. I mean, really.

      At lunch today someone approached me with a piece of paper. It read something like:   I'm deaf. Please give me your money so I can  buy a bus ticket back home to Newcastle.   Unconvinced, I shook my head and went back to my food.  The man continued on to other people around the area and while most said no to him, a couple of good samaritans spared him some change.  With what was given, the man walked straight over to a cake shop and bought himself a nice chunky cheese cake.  What happened to the bus ticket?!

You can't convince someone to buy it if you hate it.  Can I just say that  Sharapova  sure can scream. She's the  Kournikova  with skillz.  And, I had my exam today! It was hard, so I think I will just pass it. Shame. Sigh.

      It's been years since I sat down and watched a tennis match in its entirety. I'm so glad I caught the  Hewitt vs. Ivanisevic  match last night, cos it's the last time Goran is going to play, sob sob. He is going to retire :(  Even though he lost to the annoying  C'mon!  boy, he was so good in so many ways. He loves the crowd, and the crowd loves him. I love you, Goran!  Sigh. You know you're getting old when all your favourite tennis players start losing to little boys.  Buh-bai  Sampras,  buh-bai  Rafter,  buh-bai  Ivanisevic.   We've been on the run Driving in the sun Looking out for number one California here we come Right back where we started from Hustlers grab your guns Your shadow weighs a ton Driving down the 101 California here we come Right back where we started from California here we come

      I am really disturbed by how thankful my customers are. Really.  I sold them some stuff, but the shipment got delayed for about a week or two. Even though I apologised profusely about how sorry I am and kept them up to date on the status of things, I was expecting at least one of them to go off at me and demand a refund. Much to my surprise, not one of them was unhappy, but instead, they all gave me extra nice feedback and thanked me for doing a great job.  Is is just me, or does something not smell right? Have we come to expect such bad services, that when someone bothers to keep you up to date on the status of a screwed up order, you thank them for doing a great job?  There is definately something rotten in the state of Denmark.

      They just started airing  The OC  on telly here, and I'm hooked!  It's your typical teen drama series. Good-looking boy from not-so-good-looking background gets brought into a whole new world of wealth and luxuries at  The OC .  I did some research on the geography of Orange County, and it covers the coastal areas between Los Angeles and San Diego in Southern California. This includes Newport, which is where the kids from  The OC  live, as well as Irvine, yes, Irvine.  As a result, I am now seriously considering  urlLink UCI  as my exchange University of choice, since its location, as its name suggests, is in Irvine, smack middle of  The OC   My sister warns me that there will be many rich preppy kids, aka  schnobs . I don't think I'll mind though,  schnobs  are people too, right? Plus, I'll only be there for a semester, and it's the experience of going to a totally new place that I'm most looking forward to.  I do realise that I'm a real sucker for product placement. First the shoes from Kill Bill, then the city from Sex and the City. Now the county from  The OC . Is it just me or do they seem to be increasing in size?

      For the lucky few who got to see my blog template go out of whack... turns out that the template is fine, but there was a bug in my  post . Well, maybe the template had something to do with it as well, but I can't put an apostrophe in italics between some words in my post, else it all goes bonkers.  As a result, I have lost my existing comments on the previous post. Not that anyone comments besides Globber (and Brigger, on occasion) anyway.  I would like to blame this stupid BUG on Microsoft. Damn IE browsers! It worked fine on my Linux browser.

      Last Friday, we had a pest control dude come in to exterminate a family of ants who had decided to settle down inside one of our printers.  What was thought to be a family of ants soon turned out to be a whole  kingdom . No exaggerations whatsoever. There were ants  here ,  there , and  everywhere .  Extermination-wise, the pest control dude had wanted to use baits, but the explosion of numbers prompted him to use the  super-quick-knock-em-down-now  powder, which contained some sort of chemical that causes ants to lose their nerves and explode from their insides. (eeeks!)  Sure enough, the ants went spastic and started running around everywhere. Now, usually, you'd expect ants to crawl down the side of a table when they hit the edge. When these ants hit the edge, they just dropped. Like lemmings running off a cliff! Imagine if you will, a table full of black dots running around, raining down the side as they go. It was quite a sight.  The pest control dude spent a good two hours trying to get them all, but everytime we thought we were done, more would come crawling out. Eventually, we decided that we had to call in the printer maintenance man, so he can pull the printer apart completely and make sure that every last one of them is good and dead.  So, this morning, the printer man came and I accompanied him to the crime scene, giving him the low down on what had happened. He exclaimed that in all his years of work, he had seen many things inside printers, including  roaches  and  condoms , but ants? They were a first! Ladies and gentlemen, we may have ourselves a world-first here.  In the end, the printer man took the printer back with him, for further extermination. He wasn't happy with just vacuuming the little suckers out and wanted to make sure that the printer is in an 100% ant-free zone. The man is very serious about his work indeed.  This is actually my second post about ants. Something tells me it won't be the last.

      A friend of mine has been accused of being  gay  by his male friends. Why? Because he's met the perfect girl for him, but feels nothing for her.  This is strange, because he himself admitted that this girl is perfect for him. She scored perfectly on his dream-lover checklist, and seems to fancy him as well. And it's not that he doesn't want a relationship neither. In fact, he's been searching for  the one  for quite some time now.  So, herein lies the mystery. Why does he not feel anything for this person, who is perfect for him?  Brushing aside the  gay  theory, which is just preposterous IMO. Could it be that you can't find love, but love finds you?  Perhaps there is indeed a Cupid, who goes around shooting arrows (at twenty-somethings and forty-somethings no doubt), who has missed his aim on this perfect match.  If so, I think that these arrows of Cupid's must be so painful on impact that they numb the senses. Once shot, your vision becomes blurred and your defence shields drop all the way down. What is love if it isn't blind and senseless?

      A post before I hit the books...  A twenty-something friend of mine (who is younger than me) revealed to me recently that she is now kinda seeing a forty-something man. She had wanted to know what I thought of the whole thing.  Now, usually, I'd say that age is just a number. Or, in Chinese, the following:   Age is no problem Height is no distance Weight is no pressure   (as you can see, it only makes sense when you say it in Chinese...)  Anyways, I was a little disappointed in myself for being so brutally honest and highly pessimistic with her. I told her that this guy is too old for her and that it would probably never work out. He has a teenage daughter for cryin' out loud! I, having said all this, without even knowing the guy. Talk about being quick to judge!   Where have all my optimism gone? Long time passing... Where have all my optimism gone? Long time ago... Where have all my optimism gone? Boys have picked them everyone... When will I ever learn? When will I ever learn?   Thinking back to that conversation, I believe I was  way  harsh. Cos who knows, it could work, people find love in the most unexpected situations, right? Bless her for tryin' and following her heart :)  And that twenty-something girl, if you're reading this, remember,  low expectations  is the key to lasting relationships. It's been proven true by research.

      The cause of my embarassment for the day - my alarm clock.  It rang at 7:00 AM, as planned. I hit the snooze, as planned.  Zzzz...  The next time I looked up, the clock read 10:30 AM.  I freaked out, literally jumped out of bed, and without another thought reached for the phone and called in to work.    "Sorry to ring so late. I'm running really late today and won't be in for another half hour or so"  "Late? You're not late..."  "I'm not late?"  (sneaks a look at my other clock sitting next to the phone)    "OH! It's EIGHT! I'm not LATE!"  "There is something seriously wrong with my alarm clock..."  "HAHAHAHAHA"

      It really boggles me that the Queen's birthday can be today here in NSW, last week in NZ, next week in WA, and God knows what other day elsewhere. How can you do that, just make up a birthday like that! I hereby declare today, the 13th June, my birthday as well. Well wishers please leave a comment.  Thanks to the Queen's unnatural ability of being born more than once, I got to sleep in and laze around. Then I decided that too many times had I answered the question slash remark of  "Oh, you live so close to the beach, do you go there often?"  with a guilty  "Urr no actually, it's not as close as you think lar" , I ventured out, all by my lonesome self, on foot, both ways, down to Coogee beach.  I got myself something to eat and sat down on a bench by the sea. There were musicians playing jazz, a couple dancing to the music, and a cute little chiwawa staring at my food.  I think I will most definately go back next weekend.  This damn song is stuck in my head...  Yes it's true. I do I do I do I do I do.    16/06/04 - Correction: That's today, the 14th June, not 13th. I always lose my sense of timing when it's a holiday.

      Saw the new Harry Potter flick today.  I wasn't going to at all... since I didn't like the first two one bit. BUT, I heard this new one is directed by someone different, someone famous for directing a very R-rated French film or something like that, so I thought I'd give it another shot. After all, it's the director who puts the heart and soul into a movie, right? Also, a friend had seen it and highly recommended it.  So yeah, it was not too bad, pretty good in fact. I think the director captured the personalities of the characters really well. Kinda reminded me when I was in my third year at Hogwarts.  My favourite is Hermione. Go girl power!   16/06/04 - Correction: The director guy is Mexicano, not French, Mexicano.

      I haven't had much to blog about lately... it's been the same day in day out. Work, study, work, study.  I'm still undecided with my snow trips. The big factor is of course, money.  It's not that I can't afford to go, but I'm concerned about the amount of dosh I've already spent on travelling this year alone.  It's funny how money can make people feel secure. It does that to me anyway. My goal is to have enough so that working becomes an option, not a necessity.  Until then... I guess I'll just have to keep at it!

      Just paid my deposit for a snow trip in Aug. Can't wait!  I miss that down-hill rush you get when you board down a steep slope and get faster and faster. It's a feeling like no other, when the only thought going through your mind is  "Oh sheeeeet I'm gonna faaaaaall" .  Life is so much simpler when you only have to worry about survival. It's true!  In other news, I'm also deciding if I should go to Auckland (again) to the snows with my cousin. Very tempting since I have enough points for a free flight, and I miss my cute little nephew dearly.  Alas, there is a third snow trip in the making as well. If I can fly myself down to Melbourne I've been promised day trips to Mt Baw Baw. Hmmm...   Damn. If I actually end up going to the snows three times this year, I might as well get my own equipment! Time to go shopping... hehehe

      I was just browsing through some personal web pages of old friends when... BAM! I see that my ex-roomie is getting married! I am totally shocked, which happens whenever I hear of anyone younger than me getting married!  Is it that time of the year? or am I just starting to notice the notion of marriage?  At least a couple of my old school mates are now married with kids, my cousin is married with kid, my sister is married. My colleague is getting married, another old school mate is getting married, and now my ex-roomie is getting married!  This has to mean that I am really getting old. Perhaps it's time to find myself a perfect being and settle down.  Then again? nah.

      I figured out what my dream job is!  I would be the   musical director   for movies and tv shows, or even shop fronts such as Abercrombie & Fitch. The work? Picking out appropriate songs for appropriate moments.  IMO, zee best TV & Music moment:  Sex and the City - when Carrie trapezes down to the sound of   Breathe   by Michelle Branch.  and I, take it just a little bit I, hold my breath and count to ten I, 've been waiting for a chance to let you in  If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I'll know, everything is alright  Breathe Every little piece of me You'll see, everything is alright If I just, breathe...  PS. Did you know that A&F has their own special CD's which they play in their stores? They are of a special format which can only be played on the stereos in their stores, so the employees can't borrow the CD's to make copies for themselves. How do I know this? The check-out chick informed us when we tried to find out whose song was playing. She didn't know and now I forgot what it sounds like :/

      I just started reading the punctuation book by Lynne Truss and realised that I too, am guilty of punctuation-abuse.  I like to add apostrophes where they are not welcome. I realise that they are not welcome there, but it just looks so much better with them there!  For example, I much prefer writing "LOTR's" as opposed to just "LOTRs", or "Shrek's" as opposed to "Shreks'".  Looks better with the apostrophes wrong, ain't it?

      Anyone heard of  Renee Olstead ? 14-year old singer slash actress,  jazz  singer.  I just saw her on telly and she is good! Due to jet-lag I am now waking up at 4am and get to watch NBC Today as well as make it to work on time. Jet-lag is working for me :)

      When a friend asked me if I wanted to see the  Brandenburg Orchestra , because he had access to corporate tickets (ie. good seats at a discount price), I agreed immediately. It probably wasn't a smart thing to do, saying yes when I had no idea what the concert would be about, but I thought what-the-heck.  So I did a little research on the performance, and apart from finding out all about Mozart's Tenor, I also discovered that the corporate tickets weren't such a good deal after all. Yes, it pays to look things up first, literally.  But, since I had a good night, I guess paying freakin double the price can be forgiven. Orchestra, check. Tenor, check. Next on my  to-watch  list is  Quidam  by the  Cirque du Soleil . This time, I'm doing my research beforehand.

      My new and gorgeous Colorado shoes are causing me much bliss, and pain. So much bliss that I must wear them all the time, and so much pain that I am tiptoeing around like an idiot on stilts.  Why does one have to break into a new pair of shoes, blisters and all, before they start to feel comfy?  Why can't there be pre-broken shoes, like pre-shrunk jeans, so you know exactly what you are getting when you try them on in the shops?  I'm taking the bus home today.

      I made some double choc cookies just now... and thought that the cookie dough bore an uncanny resemblance to poo poo...      Still unconvinced?      If you have leftover dough, roll it up and store it in the freezer. The next time you have a craving, just take it out, slice it, and straight into the oven it goes. Easy piecy, Japanesy.

      Went shopping for a sleeping bag today in preparation for my snow trip. Got the warmest one I could find cos I am extremely afraid of the cold.   I wish someone would make a sleeping bag which is easy to fold away. I spent at least half an hour tugging at the damn thing before I could fit it back into its bag. I was so exhausted after the ordeal that I had to have my power nap.   I also saw the cutest pez dispenser ever! I got the sheep one. Cute eh?

      I was having a serious conversation with a friend one day, about how people are never satisfied with what they have and just want more and more.    Human nature sux , I commented.    Why?  said friend.    Well, it's human nature to be dissatified about everything,  I said.    It's through dissatisfaction that a person grows, &nbsp; I continued.   Friend starts laughing uncontrollably, and says,    I thought you were talking about the singing group.     &nbsp;   A singing group?  I said, confused.    Yeah, human nature,  said friend.   I remembered this convo whilst walking to lunch today and chuckled to myself. Human nature sux.

      In the spirit of procrastination, I shall attemp to translate one of my favourite songs of all time:  Listen to the Sea - Chang Huay Mei (A-Mei)  Write me a letter and tell me, the colour of the sea today. The sea that accompanies you night after night, what does it feel? Grey means it doesn't want to say, blue means its blue. You're drifing, your heart of wild waves, where does it stop?  Write me a letter and tell, what you wish to dream of tonight. Outside of your dreams, do I give you no choice? With a clenched heart, unable to close my eyes all night. Why is it that you can care, but can't get close?  Listen, to the cries of the sea. It's sighing for the ones who have been hurt, unable to wake up. It can't be me, at least I am calm. But the tears, even the tears, do not believe.  Listen, to the cries of the sea. This sea is too full of love, with its endless cries. Write me a letter, as our last promise. Tell me, when you left me, how you had felt.

      One of my favourite songs of all time:  寫信告訴我今天 海是什麼顏色 夜夜陪著你的海 心情又如何 灰色是不想說 藍色是憂鬱 而漂泊的你 狂浪的心 停在哪裡  寫信告訴我今夜 你想要夢什麼 夢裡外的我是否 都讓你無從選擇 我揪著一顆心 整夜都閉不了眼睛 為何你明明動了情 卻又不靠近  聽 海哭的聲音 歎惜著誰又被傷了心 卻還不清醒 一定不是我 至少我很冷靜 可是淚水 就連淚水也都不相信  聽 海哭的聲音 這片海未免也太多情 悲泣到天明 寫封信給我 就當最後約定 說你在離開我的時候 是怎樣的心情

      I just started watching  Angels in America , the Emmy-nominee for Outstanding Miniseries.   Real love is never ambivalent , they said.  So if I told you that my love is full of ambivalence, does it mean that it isn't real?

      Saw  Will Smith  kick robo-ass last night. I went in with zero expectations and came out a very satisfied customer. Storyline, check. Special effects, check. Hot leading male, check. It was like  Minority Report  meets  The Terminator . Highly recommended to all.  I also splurged on a pair of  Bloch  dance sneakers. I've wanted them for ages and finally took the plunge. I love them to bits and can't wait to try them out!  Looks like it's gonna be another cold rainy weekend. Sigh.

      Shame on me for doubting Ashton Kutcher's abilities... this movie is simply brilliant! It's still got my all dazed...  And yes I finally made it back to work today...

      My vicious sleeping cycle has done it again. I decided that I'm still sick today and gave myself an extra long weekend. I just don't wanna go to work! &nbsp; So instead, I went and got my eyes checked out after convincing myself that I'm going blind. The results were surprisingly, quite the contrary. My left eye has actually&nbsp;improved while my right eye worsened a little. This is good news as the degree gap between the two eyes have decreased, although most of the strain is still on the one better eye.  &nbsp; My hopes of getting contacts will have to wait now that I've been proven not-so-blind by a professional. &nbsp; I'm going to make spagetti for dinner tonight. Cooking is fun!

      I pulled a sickie today... thanks to my afternoon power nap I was unable to fall asleep again until the wee hours of the morning and consequently unable to get out of bed when the alarm went off.  &nbsp; Actually, this happens to me pretty much every day, but today I gave in to my laziness and made  the   call . The last time I made  the call  was say, three months' ago? Damn I'm bad. My&nbsp;mother says lucky I have&nbsp;a bummy job, else I'd be fired. Cheers to that. &nbsp; It felt like a Sunday today as I made myself brunch (pan friend bacon and eggs on a lightly toasted and buttered muffin) with a glass of juice. I was feeling so domesticated that I also baked some choc chip cookies, which turned pretty damn good. &nbsp; I love Sundays, or&nbsp;any other day&nbsp;which feels like a Sunday.

      With much time on my hands now that the exams are over, I decided to cook dinner tonight. Cooking with  Brahims  that is, hehe. &nbsp; I usually leave the rice cooking whilst I go off somewhere else but today I stayed in the kitchen stirring my dish... and suddenly I caught scent of a strong fragrance in the air... I followed my nose and ended up in front of the rice cooker. My gosh it's no wonder they call Jasmine Rice  Jasmine  Rice, cos it really smells like Jasmine!! Do try this at home. &nbsp; The MTV Awards are on telly now and I'm on a roll! Got all the winners right so far... I guess they do kinda stand out from the rest of the nominees. I'm looking forward to seeing  Adam Brody , he's such a cutie.

      I usually try not to have any Maccers for fear of lack of nutrition and that awful after taste you get in your mouth.  This morning though I was starving and didn't really want to go to the deli nearby cos everything there is over priced and blend tasting. So into Maccers I went and I tried their new smoothie which is part of that supposedly healthy saladsplus menu.  I have to say I was surprisingly impressed by the taste. And it's like 99% fat free or something, not that I'm counting. I guess that  Supersize Me  movie really hit a nerve.

I get very very  extremely  annoyed when I spot an ebay listing that makes no sense... it's hard to describe the feeling but it makes me want to tear my hair out and slap the person silly.  While searching for my competitors' listings, I came across one which read:   ***************************************************************************** asics(onitsuka) Kill bill shoes limited edition  Specially bestows: Original factory black commemoration shoes box.

      I reckon that  Benjamin McKenzie  looks just like a young and restless  Russel Crowe .  Everyone else must think so too cos they played it out on the show, with his on-screen gf commenting on how alot of people think  Russel Crowe  is hot but he just doesn't do it for her. hehe.  My fave character is  Seth Coen , the Jew-ish guy (half Jewish, half Christian) with the cute roman curls. I like roman curls.

And I feel really lucky cos a week after I signed up they changed their plans and I got away with not paying a setup fee, hee hee.  I have decided to archive my song-of-the-moment guitar tabs on a blog! A brilliant idea if I may say so myself, ho ho. 'Tis pp.tabz, on the links.

I'm also very happy that  Sharapova  ended the  Williams  reign of women's tennis at Wimbledon, mainly so I can finally get some sleep.   Before you landed I had a will but didn't know what it could do You were abandoned And still you're handing out what you don't wanna lose You make me drop things Like all the plans I had for a life without you  Someone to die for Someone to fall into when the world goes dark Someone to die for Someone to tear a hole in this endless night Someone like you  I'm drunk when sober The room is spinning  You are what I hold on to You're taking over I find that giving in is the best I can do  Someone to die for Someone to fall into when the world goes dark Someone to die for Someone to tear a hole in this endless night Someone like you

      Prior to my departure to the snows, I have to quote one of the many great lines from  Angels in America :   Nothing's lost forever   In this world there's a kind of painful progress   Longing for what we left behind   and dreaming ahead     What a strange, funny, and wonderful series.

        Idiom: cheek by jowl   Side by side; close together.  Apparently, also the name of one of the ten great theatre companies in the world.  So anyway, I went to see their production of   Othello   last night. I had scored myself and a friend free tickets by entering in a giveaway competition at uni and surprise surprise!  I have to say,   Othello   isn't one of my fave Shakespearean plays. There is nothing outstanding about the story, and there seems to be a running theme in all of Shakespeare's plays.  What theme? Well,   communications  ! If these people would just  talk  to each other, then there would be no great tragedy to unfold. I think William is trying very hard to tell us that we need to talk more.

      Looks like my food poisoning phase has passed. Just had myself two juicy bacon and egg muffins and no tummy aches, touch wood.  I really feel for muslims and jews and whoever else that can't eat bacon. I don't think I can live without bacon. Bacon bacon bacon!  Of course, you might say that what they don't know won't hurt them, but it does. It does.

      I think I've got food poisoning... except that I ate so many different things at so many different places I can't pin point exactly what's causing it.  The symptoms are mild I suppose, I just can't eat anything cos they come straight out. I can't afford to spend all day sitting on the loo so I'm starving myself and hoping it'll pass soon. I'll have to try taking a vitamin when I get home and see if that gets rejected as well.  I am never buying a new pair of shoes again!  (until I see one I can't live without, of course)  Both pairs of my new shoes caused me much pain and suffering on the weekend. How long is it going to take to break them in? Sigh.
