      Why is it that I always find places in my house to shove all those unwanted items.  I usually declare a drawer in my home as the "junk drawer" and every time I get a piece of literature that looks interesting, but I don't have the time for, it undoubtedly gets crammed into the drawer for later viewing.  I eventually have to go through the crumpled up and mangled mess when I find I can't even close the silly thing.  I end up throwing most of it out without even taking a second glance at it.  And in my house, I don't just have a junk drawer. I have junk closets, and junk car trunks, junk cabinets, junk dresser drawers, junk corners....'oh, and the list can go on.  From the outside that drawer or closet or space looks neatly kept, but one look inside might have you thinking I am a housekeeping hypocrite.    This practical scenario plays itself out in my spiritual life, as well, more often than I would like.  I will hear the Holy Spirit say "don't do that" or "please do this" and I will cramm the thought or notion back into the "unkept" places of my swirling mind.  Sweeping it under the rug works for a while-but eventually I trip on the massive bulge it creates under the rug.    The need to read God's word and pray and sing praises and meditate on him also gets crammed away into a corner of my heart that is ignored.  It gets so stuff at times, that I find myself in a spiritual depression.  I usually end up in a heap on the floor in my apartment asking the Lord to fix me.  I credit this to my human nature that thinks I can do everything on my own without help from God.  And I would contend to think that yes-for the most part-every day decisions, such as what I will wear and how long I'll sleep can be left up to me-but having a relationship with Jesus is more than just about me.  It is praying for those in need of prayer, helping those in need of help, meditating on the God who desires my desires, and singing praises to the one worthy of my praises.   I honestly don't know how to stop this cycle of the spiritual junk drawer, but I feel recognizing here and now is a huge step in the right direction.  Maybe those of you who read this can pray for me, and in some small way-it might be a catalyst for change.  This is Faith-signing out  Love in Christ-peace

      This morning I got into my car, dreading the horrendous drive up Highway 52 to work.  I sat in the car parked in my driveway long enough to let the engine warm up and get to that "just right" temperature. At this point I was still trying to get a few more z's so I hadn't turned my music on yet.  Needless to say I eventually left my driveway and began my drive to work.  Just as I headed out of the top of my driveway I turned up the volume to my car stereo.  I beautiful piano was playing and then a soothing calming voice came over the piano.  It was Nicole Nordeman.  I had bought the Woven & Spun cd a few weeks ago and had not really listened to the entire cd except a few choice songs.  This morning it was on the last song of the cd.  "Graditude"! As I listened to the words of this beautifully written song, my heart began to hurt.  My eyes began to blur with enormous tears.  It was the line that says "Oh, the differences that often are between Everything we want and what we really need," pierced me.  I began to ask myself "what is the difference?"  For me the difference is greatfulness.  I have been far too ungreatful for what I have, always looking at what I don't have, or the lack there of.  Not enough clothes, not enough jewelry, shoes, cds, makeup, money, furniture, dishes, and no boyfriend.  Its really the last one that God really spoke to me about.  All I "need" is Jesus and yet I am focusing on "wanting" a boyfriend.  How foolish to wish my life away instead of acting in servanthood.  I pray now that I can remember this personal revelation from God tomorrow-tonight-as I watch other couples...and remember that God is husband-he is my friend-he is my father-he is everything that no man could ever be.   Another quick excerpt: I kinda got a double whammy today.  My mom had slipped Glamour magazine into my car yesterday while I was helping her and her husband move some things around their house.  I have steered clear of these kinds of magazines for the last six months-just because they cause me to be dissatisfied.  Let's just say-curiosity got this cat-and I took the magazine into work today (which-by the way-was a day from hades) and read it inbetween phone calls.  I happened to come across this article entitled "Love will find you" (or something to that extent) and it caught my eye.  I was able to read the whole three page article without getting one interruption.  God really blessed me with this because it was very encouraging.  It reminded me that my life isn't over after my twenties. I can still meet someone and fall in love and get married and have babies and have a crazy wonderful family life.  I almost cried at my desk at work-but I didn't-can't let everyone know how silly crazy I am. : )   I can see that God is really working something out of me and into me.  My ungreatfulness has certainly caused me some frown wrinkles-I'm ready for the happy ones.    I just pray now-that God will remind me of this continually.  I pray Jesus for peace to know that you are planning a perfect will for me-and that I can not fathom all that you have for me. Thanks Jesus for your love and patience with me.  Thank you for all that you have given me, from material posessions to friends and family-you are gracious in all your ways.  Love-Faith 05-17-04

      At my dad's this weekend in Henderson.  I've had an okay time, but there seems to be a lot of tension between my dad and Lisa.  Not sure what is going on...maybe it's Matt living here-I don't know.  All I really do know is how it affects me-its very saddening.  I don't think I could really deal with another break up.  They all mean so much to me.  If someone was to have told me five years ago that my parents would be divorced, and I would love new people, I would have laughed at them and contritely waved them away.  Shit happens, things change, and life moves on.  I think I can say that though I'm not happy about the divorce, I am happy with how I have grown because of it.  Wouldn't it suck if I couldn't learn from bad situations?  Yup-I think so.  I told God three days ago, that I would pray every day for a husband, until he brought me.  I'm serious about this one. I'm fed up with waiting.  I am having a hell of a time managing my temptive urges-boys are all around me-and even the ugly ones are beginning to look quite attractive.  I'm not lonely-it's just once you've opened the forbidden box of sex-it's hard to not want to open it again.  I have been succesful thus far in praying for a husband...but it's only day three...we'll see in two or three months-heck a week :)  I'm getting along much better with David and Mom as a couple.  I love them both and have really come to respect each of them together and separately.  I am not sure why it took me so long to accept David.  Mostly because I thought he wasn't good enough for her, based on his looks. He's certainly not what I consider good looking-but his intelligence and compassion certainly make up for it.  Sure-he's heavey handed and loud mouthed-but then again-maybe I am too.   eXpedition: is okay-I'm a little disenchanted with it at this point-and having a hard time sticking in there.  I would love to move on to another church that is much more stable and established.  But it seems to be my pattern that I leave when it gets too tough-so I'm just asking God to help me through the hard time.  God-if you read this-which you are probably doing now-please help me.  I need you to move in my friendships at eXpedition and help me to better serve those in the church.  I want to bless those around me-but I can't if everyone hates me due to misconceptions presented by tainted opinions.  Help me to love Courtney. If I could beat her up in a dark alley somewhere, I would-but I know that's not right, and deep in my heart I do love her, it's just hard to show it when she insists on hurting me. But God is bigger than my feelings and my fleshly desires.  I'm missing Drew like crazy.  He hasn't written me any email-not called-no letter-nothing.  I feel like discarded trash-and it's hard to understand why he doesn't communicate in some manner.  If he does love me, even as a close friend, why doesn't he contact me? Doesn't he realize that, that is what friends do?  Guess not.  I did send him two emails-the first was really encouraging-the second relayed irritation and frustration.  I plan on sending him a letter to let him know how I really feel, but I need an address first.  I was watching Tombstone tonight, and there is a scene at the end where Jody looks in the mirror after a show.  She's not looking at herself, but instead looking into the future with regret, regret that she didn't tell Wyatt exactly how she felt, that she didn't care about any of his faults, and just wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.  I identified greatly with that look-and felt a twinge of pain in the pit of soul, that I too, would one day feel this.  God-please don't let this happen to me.  Well-guess that's enough for now.  I love my life God-I just want someone to share it with.  Love-Faith
