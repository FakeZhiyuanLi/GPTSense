      So, trying to plan my senior trip is more trouble than it's worth. My parents have made me a nice offer for the Ireland trip with my school, and I'm thinking about it.  But Ireland doesn't really mean anything to me. I'd be going to go with friends and to say I've been to Europe. But, then I'm half planning a trip to Tokyo, which is where I'd really love to go. It would be alone and in the big city, but I suppose I'd have to get used to it sometime.  But there are SO MANY CHOICES!!!!!!!!!!  Too many.  I have to decide whether I'd like a nice hotel and stay fewer days or a scary one and stay longer.  Or could I perhaps go to Okinawa cheaper?  I'm not sure, but I'll have to look it up now that I've thought of it. I should just go to Ireland, but I REALLY want this Japan thing and it would offer me a chance to sort of get in touch with my Asian roots.  I haven't ever really had any contact with that many other Asians.  But then again, Ireland is cheaper.  Oh well, I will go somewhere either way, so I suppose it shouldn't matter that much.  I have all my life to travel the world, and since that's what I plan on doing anyway, I think it could work out just fine any way I go.  So, anyway, my parakeet Sonny died today.  Or last night. I'm not sure.  It made me really sad, because I hadn't even looked at it the day before.  I felt bad that I didn't just glance at it. I remember hearing it moving its toys, but never looking at it, and now all I can remember is how it looked when I found it on the bottom of the cage this morning.  But I'm trying not to dwell on the sad things today. I'm not going to allow myself to do that.  It's abnormally cold out today.   I actually shivered just now.  It was 50 degrees this morning, and this is Cape Girardeau here!  We're ususally really hot out this time of year.  So I'm thinking about finding a sweatshirt or something to wear right about now, but I'm too lazy to get up and do it.  Curse these lazy whims of mine!  I need to be wrapped up in a blanket or something.  Oh well, I will write again today, probably several times. I'm one of those people who never run out of things to say.  'Til then. . . .    See you space cowboy. . . . @>---

      So, I had a klondike bar once and I realized that it's just a rather hefty ice cream bar. So, what would I do for a klondike bar? Nothing. There are cheaper ice cream bars out there. Why is everyone out there thrying to trick me?

      The time is not something I had the foresight to set on this thing. It's actually 12:46.

        So, this is my first post on this thing.  I better make it good. . . .Right. . . . Anyone who reads this will probably understand that I'm a cynic and I hate a lot of things. (But, if you're reading this, you're probably someone I know and, therefore, already know this fact and either embrace it or flee from it in terror.)      So, today. . . .What did I do today? I can't really remember. My memory has been pretty bad lately. It couldn't have been that exciting. Oh, yeah. I hung out with my friends. Sarah, Jonathan and Brian. We did the typical gaming/talking thing. Just because I don't seem excited, doesn't mean I didn't have fun. I did. In my own way.     In writing this, I have discovered how. . . .routine my life is.  I have friends, I go out and have fun with them, I come home, I feed my addiction to Final Fantasy and frozen Coke, I go to bed. Then I wake up and do the same thing again.  How will I ever find enough drama to post here? Maybe that's exactly what I need, more drama in my life.  Unfortunately, in order to do that, I'd have to find a boyfriend, break up with him (more likely, he would break up with me), and then do something really stupid like have his baby, go on Maury and find out it wasn't his after all, but in fact, it was the child of the 40 year old Mexican migrant worker I had been seeing behind his back for the past 4 years.  But unless someone knows how I'd go about initiating something like that, I think I'll just carry on as I have been the last 17 1/2 years of my life.     But who can deny it? I'm a drama queen! And if I'm given even the slightest amount of angst, I'll make that molehill into a mountain.  But I feel I'm very well adjusted, even with all of my failings.     I really want to say more in this post. . . .So, I'll shed some light on a few things everybody wants to know about me. I: A.) Am totally into playing games on the PS2. (Even though I suck.) B.) Am the owner of a rare type of dog that has the capability to teleport. C.) Am a girl who likes her men intelligent, not blonde, quirky, and above all, um, male. D.) Am someone who spells blonde with an "-e". E.) Go to Barnes and Noble at least 3 times a week. (Yet I'm still unsure as to how one goes about spelling this store's name.) F.) Strongly dislike large groups of people. (And by large I mean 6 and up.) G.) Don't stand out in a crowd. H.) Am a closet goth. I.) Love making lists. (I think this proves my case.) J.) Watch too much anime for my own good and now it is seeping into my reality. (Everything's this giant shojo in which the characters are either gay or straight, but regardless EVERYONE falls in love with one man.--Not really what happens in my life, but see previous comment about "drama queen".) K.) Harbor a love for Johnny Depp and poetry. (Together, mind you. If you know me very well, you know what I mean.) L.) Have no fashion sense. Call me "clothes clumsy". M.) Hate most people except the chosen few. N.) Am basically anti-social. O.) Hate poseurs. P.) Won't stop listing until I reach "z". So, if you want to move on, scroll down. Q.) Quit my job at Toys 'R Us after 2 weeks. R.) Am addicted to gummy bears of the Haribo variety. S.) Am not attracted to Asian men whatsoever. T.) Could possibly be the most accepting person in the world--even though I hate everyone. U.) Stand up for the rights of gays, though am not one myself. So, if you pick on one of them, you're picking a fight with me. V.) Love to write. My files of short stories and poetry are endless. W.) Plan on entering the movie business. On the production/direction/crew end, not acting. X.) Read vampire fiction rabidly. Y.) Cannot play any musical instruments worth shit. Z.) Am ending this horrible list.     So, love and kisses, and the so forth. I'm gonna leave this post as it stands. You can now breathe a sigh of relief. See you tomorrow. Same place.
