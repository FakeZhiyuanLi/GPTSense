      25 Reasons Some of Us Won't Mourn Reagan  (in no particular order, add your own)  1-Nicaraguan contras. Reagan called them the "moral  equivalent of our founding fathers." U.S. created  terror army in Nicaragua murdered tens of thousands of  people and destroyed a social revolution; today  majority of Nicaraguans live in poverty in the 2nd  poorest country in the hemisphere after Haiti.   2-PATCO. 11,000 union air traffic controllers fired by  Reagan, opened and encouraged a new era of union  busting by employers and anti-union policies.   3-Reganomics, as Papa Bush called it "voodoo  economics," how to carry out the biggest tax cut for  the rich and biggest military buildup in decades while  maintaining a balanced budget. It didn't work.   4-Afghanistan. CIA created, trained, funded, and armed  "freedom fighters" in Afghanistan, including Osama bin Laden,  to fight the Soviets.   5-"Trees Cause Pollution". Said Reagan, removing  thousands of acres of public land to hand them over to  timber, oil and mining corporations.   6-Star Wars, MX "peacekeeper" missile, B-1 bomber. And  other destabilizing weapons systems intended to foster a new  arms race with the Soviets and create a new U.S.-first  strike capability.   7-Bitburg. Reagan's pays homage to Hitler's most elite  military group while visiting an SS cemetery, calls  the SS victims of Nazism "just as surely as the  victims in the concentration camps."   8-Antonin Scalia. Appointed by Reagan to the Supreme  Court.   9-Angola. CIA funds and arms a terror guerilla army  that kills millions in a two-decade war, with an  ongoing legacy of the world's most land mines.   10- Civil Rights. Justice Department slashes funding  for civil rights enforcement.   11- "Aristocratic Movement". As one historian put it.  Ron and Nancy become patrons of aristocratic culture  in fashion, communications,etc. "Dynasty" and "Lives  of the Rich and Famous" become major TV shows.   12- Iran Contra Affair. Secret White House cabal sells  arms to Iran to fund contras, subverting the  Constitution and avoiding Congressional oversight.   13- Guatemala. Rightwing, evangelist dictatorship  funded and armed, with frequent massacres of the  indigenous population, and 1/8 of population  displaced. Dictator Rios Montt says on national TV he  had "declared a state of siege so we could kill  legally." Regan says Rios Montt had a "bum rap" on  human rights abuses.   14- "Ketchup is a vegetable." Dept. of Agriculture  says ketchup can be counted as a vegetable for  calculating nutritional value in school lunches to  facilitate major cuts in public school lunch funding.   15- William Rehnquist. Appointed Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court by Reagan.   16- Savings and Loan Scandal. Created by banking  industry deregulation,costs U.S. taxpayers billions to  bail out failed S&Ls.   17- Homelessness. Grows by the millions as  "Reaganville" homeless camps are created across U.S.  Regan says many are "homeless by choice."   18- Conspicuous consumption. "Yachting," "Gourmet,"  "Architectural Digest," and "Wine Spectator" are the  fastest growing U.S.magazines, with the aid of the  biggest tax cut for the rich in U.S.history.   19- Industrial wastelands. Mass shift of high-wage  industrial jobs overseas,creating ghost lands in the  industrial heartland.   20- South Africa. U.S. opposes divestiture and  continues to back white rule in Pretoria defying  growing worldwide anti-apartheid movement.   21- CIA drug running. CIA supports drug empires in  Latin America,including Manuel Noriega in Panama and  drug kingpins in Colombia to support U.S. policies in  region, fostering growth of crack and drug crisis in  U.S.   22- Ferdinand Marcos. VP George Bush salutes Marcos'  "commitment to democracy" as U.S. continues to prop up  his dictatorship in the Philippines.   23- James Watt, Earl Butz, Ed Meese. Reagan cabinet  members.   24- El Salvador. U.S. funded and trained death-squads  and their government sponsors kill tens of thousands  of Salvadorans, plus an archbishop and U.S.nuns.   25- Income gap. Richest 10% hold 73% of country's net  worth following the Reagan years. Ratio of executive  pay to factory worker pay goes from 42:1 in 1980 to 419:1.   26- Best friends of the Reagans,  Betsy & Edgar Bloomingdale  (yes, of the Bloomingdale stores).  Pedophile/Sadomasochist Edgar, also   a member of Ronnie's kitchen cabinet--kept a mistress since she was 14   years old.  When she was 28ish, Edgar dies leaving her nothing, even though   he had promised to remember her in his will.  Betsy says she will not honor any  written or verbal agreement they had---the girl threatens to go public   and winds up dead.  The murder was never investigated.   27-Because we know all this hoopla is just smoke and mirrors for the BUSH                administration.
