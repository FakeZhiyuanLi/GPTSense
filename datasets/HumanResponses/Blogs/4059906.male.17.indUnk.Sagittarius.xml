         [It starts with] One thing, I don’t know why It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know, time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It’s so unreal, didn’t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on but didn’t even know Wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when         I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn’t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end   It doesn’t even matter    One thing, I don’t know why Doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard Despite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I’m surprised it got so far Things aren’t the way they were before You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when    I   tried so hard   And got so far But in the end It doesn’t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn’t even matter    I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know    I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn’t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn’t even matter

      Story of a mans' schedule Once upon a time, there was a young man who goes to college at dlsu. Oh, what a awful schedule he has. 340-440pm on mwf, 8am-6pm on t th. He hated that schedule. Because before, He failed two subjects already,   urlLink !@#$  accounting and  urlLink !@#%  humanbiology. He was sad when he failed those two subject, but there is a special someone who cheered him up so he is still happy, and he also remembered the word rejoice from one of his teacher on 3rd year on his high school that he forgotten the name already. It does not mean that he forgets his teachers. His not just good at remembering names. He took up summer classes because of his failures. When it is time for online enrollment, for those who failed, they will be the last one to enroll. So,  That was the past. The present is that he is now taking his 1st sem on his 2nd year. He is often late on his classes on th, cause it so early for him. 8 o clock!! its so early, its so hard for him to wake up early in the morning. Wow! how time flies... its already time for online enrollment. But he is one of the last to enroll again and it will be always like that for his whole life. So sad... but his schedule is better than before. His happy but still sad, but he is still happy, but he never became sad at all because of the special loving and caring of the special someone He is still very Happy and never sad. His schedule now is 920-1020 am mwf and 8am-6pm tth. Wow!! His class on mwf is earlier, but not that early because the perfect tym for him is 9-3. he really wants that time for his schedule because it is not too early and it is not too late. For him it is a perfect sched. He still didnt want the schedule on his tth class. He was sad about the schedule but he never became sad at all because of the special loving and caring of the special someone He is still very Happy and never sad. And now he is hoping for a better schedule nxt tym. thats all about his schedule for now. THE END

       What a wonderful day it is today on the day of yesterdays' tomorrow    and I hope that the day of tomorrows' yesterday will be wonderful too    and also the day before tomorrow and also on the day after yesterday...    Im lucky that i woke up early on this day cause my alarm clock is dead,    I really need an alarm for me to wake up from bed.    if theres no alarm clock or someone to wake me up i'll just sleep all day long like im wasted...     once i woke up from my bed, i thought of choices of what i will do for the whole day from begining to end,      wake up or sleep again, be happy or be sad, be good or be bad, to do this or to do that, or to be thinking about what..     from those thinking, it gives me a sleepy feeling, that makes me want to go back sleeping..      Slap! no time for a nap, i need to get up, need to be ready in a zap..     must not be late from my subject cause i dont want to be drop...  i went to brush my teeth and take a bath.. when taking a bath i want my water to be hot, after that, i wear my cloths and go down to eat my breakfast.. after my feeding, i went upstairs for fixing my things that i need for schooling... i need to be going...   Wait! i realize something.. im english speaking, i feel sorry for my bad english speaking, i hope i'll be better cause i keep practicing, im doing all this for this is my early morning...
