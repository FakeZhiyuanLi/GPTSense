      I have been so busy this week.  I feel like I'm almost always at the pool, which in some ways is nice and someways in really anoying. And because most of the time I'm swimming it can get quite boring. But if you read my blog, which actually I haven't told anyone I have one yet, you don't want to hear about how boring my life is, but about the exciting parts.  On the 3, church is have a 4th of July get-together fellowship thingy at the Owens Farm. My family is camping out over night the 2nd, which I am so very not excited, because when ever my family goes camping.... it ends up not being so very fun. :( I think you get the point? And I need to go, Later, Ellie

      I read so many different peoples blogs: Allen's - http:// ali-babau.blogspot.com Charity's - http:// athleticallychallengedgurl.blogspot.com Anna's - http:// apulliam.blogspot.com Lukee's - http:// lukeee07.blogspot.com Becca's - http:// daughteroftheking.blogspot.com Shannon's - http:// shannonkoons.blogspot.com Jerimiah's - http:// jdragz.blogspot.com Ashley's - http:// gigglebox55.blogspot.com David's - http:// davidpulliam.blogspot.com Amber's - http:// amberwheeler.blogspot.com Josh Bright's - http:// swimming_upstream.blogspto.com Sarah's - http:// spulliam.blogspot.com Actually not as many as Daivid does, but still. This might not be all of them, but if I forgot someone I will remember and post them later. Anyway, Allen's party was soooooo much fun. :)I swam though it was freezing and Zachary and I were having somesort of weird conversation about dunking people, so then he dunked me and after that I got out. :) I rode with Alissa and I was going to ride back to her house and my mom would pick me up there, but when I called my mom to tell her that we were leaving the Blackwood's house she told me I was spending the night at Alissa's I looked at Alissa and said "I am" and then she said "You are" It was quite funny. :) So we ended up staying up till like 1:30 - 2:00.  Then last night I went to Conner prairie for the symphony on the prairie because Zachary and Allen were working and they got free tickets. Anyway Becca, Hayley and I kept messing with Allen's phone, by like taking tons of pictures with it of us. It was tons of fun and we ate tons of junk food and afterwards played on the playground which was really fun since all of us are way over 12 (especially Allen) and we were going to go to steak and shake but Laura who was my ride home, said no that we couldn't go so we didn't.  Anyway sorry this is so long, Later, Ellie

      I am really excited about Allen's party. It's on Friday night at his house from like 4 - 10:30. :)I think we are going to see the second ECHO trip come home, but I think it's all mixed up right now (like what we're doing) so I'm really not sure. I'm taking two side dishes... I'm not exactly sure what they'll be right now. And I hope to wear matching shirts with Bethany and Haley Fisher. :)  So I'm taking work off - actually just getting Jessica Young to take my hours - Thursday, Friday and Saturday since I hope be going with the Blackwood's (again) to the symphony on the prairie at Conner prairie. I need to stop hanging up the phone line.  Later, Ellie

      This has to be somewhat short.  Today I went to Gus swim team and there was a mother and her five baby ducks in the pool. We like, tried to get them out almost half of practice. There was even one life guard who got in and tried to catch them. Finally we caught all the babies and put them in this crate and let them go outside of the pool area. Then the mom flew out of the pool and they were reunited. :) It was quite cute.  I now have to go babysit my neighbors from 1 - 2:30 then swim from 3 - 4:30 then work from 5-8. On Friday we are having a ECHO get-together at the Blackwood's house and I am really excited.  Later,  Ellie

      I am so very happy. I have wanted to get a blog for a while, but my mom wasn't quite sure she wanted me to get one. But she finally said yes. And though I am very busy, I want to try to write at least 4 days a week if not more. Considering how much I'm on e-mail that won't be very hard.  Today I went to Gus swim team at 9:30 and taught the little swimmers till 10:30 then went and swam with the team from 10:30 to 11:15. I was planning on going to Rivi swim team this afternoon but we're not having it, due to the fact that most of the team just got back from an Ohio meet. I am going to work at 5 though. I work in the Rivi locker-room from 5-8, Monday through Saturday. It's not the most exciting job, basically I sit there and make sure people who are 21 don't go in the 21 and over showers and mop at the end. So I get to sit there, read and listen to music.  So that's about all I've done today and all I'm going to write, Later, Ellie

      Tomorrow I have to share for ECHO! And I am sooooooooooooo NOT excited. :( I really don't like public speaking, plus I'm not good at it! But I guess I am glad that everybody got moved to morning service, cause most of my group doesn't go to our church, so it would have been just Margaret, Me, my Dad and maybe Laura, but she shared last week, so I don't think so. But that would have been really bad, cause then we'd all have to speak for a really long time. :( But Mr. Filson and my dad edited ECHO trip #1's video, and now it is extremely boring. They took out all the good and funny parts, including all of us jumping in the pond. :) So tomarrow you all get to see ECHO at its boreingest!

      I am so very excited! I got a new swim-suit. It's the one I've wanted to get for a really, really long time, just my mom wouldn't buy it for me, cause it was to expensive and I didn't have enough money.  But today I got my pay check, cashed it and then went straight to Kast-a-way Swim Wear. It's a reversible, polyester suit with pictures of zebra's on one side and zebra stripes on the other side. And its purple! :)       I love it soooooooooo much! And it's mine, not my mom's. :)

       I am really annoyed at our computer, it takes like, forever to load anything. I've been loading this movie* for like 15 minutes and I still haven't gotten to the actual movie, all I've seen is like advertisements for like Target.  * Go to   urlLink  www.happytreefriends.com    : It's like violent cartoons&nbsp;characters who like, kill themselves in every episode. There's tons of blood and only sometimes do you feel sorry for the little guys, because they are soooooooooo stupid. :) We were at ECHO and Margaret showed some of us and we were all sitting there laughing because the guy was so stupid. :)  I have practice today and then I have to work, but by the way my coach said I'm allowed to bring friends&nbsp; to practice, so if any of you Gus swimmers want to come to practice with me, well please come. It's not all as bad as I sometimes say it is. :)  Song of the post: Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending  Quote of the post: I won't admit or deny anything... makes me more interesting." - Orlando Bloom

      Today my brothers are at the RCA championships till like 4 and my mom is there now till they come home, so I'm stuck at home with Andrew and Jessica till 4. Which means I have to miss Rivi swim team. :( We ( gus )won the last swim meet, though as I said before we knew we'd win. And even though almost all of our older swimmers weren't there, we still won by like 300 points. :)&nbsp;  Ellie  Quote:  "When it comes time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.

        Several experts* have their own theories; I’ve collected the best of them here!  One theory says that it has something to do with keeping an eye out for men. As we all know, men don’t exactly take baths every day... and if one of those things come up to you… they might- hug you! This unfortunate thing happened to Haldir of Lorien, and, as we saw, was killed by the after effects.  Another theory is that it’s to make sure that you can spot a human who wants you to fall in love with them, and make you give up your immortality! I mean, dude, you might grow a- a... beard... and then... start to smell like a human...  And yet another theory is The Watchdog Instinct: Maybe you’ve noticed, but elven men seen to be very keen on keeping their daughters away from men... they sleep outside their daughter’s rooms, with their eyes open, just in case. This becomes habit, and now they are doomed to sleep with their eyes open! They learned their lessons from Thingol and Elrond!  For some reason, all of these theories revolve around keeping men away... and we can only wonder why these experts think elves are paranoid about men. Well, I hate to break the news to you, but it very well might be true. I have this as evidence:  A can of Lysol spray sanitizer was found after the battle of Helm’s Deep, on the wall. My assumption (and this is based on eyewitnesses) is that the elves that Haldir brought took these along with them. According to an eyewitness, the elves were seen spraying the walls and ground wherever the men had been...  As for me, I only have one theory on why elves sleep with their eyes open...  They’re so anxious for ROTK to come out, they just can’t get to sleep!  &nbsp; * Disclaimer: In reality, No experts have come up with such theories, they’re just figments of my insanity!

      I found&nbsp;several cool quotes from George W. Bush.  Quote:   The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger...None of us will ever forget this day. Yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.   &nbsp;  Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.     America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no  one will keep that light from shining.      If I could vote, I would vote for him.  Ellie

      Gus has another swim meet tomarrow. The one problem is that most of our older swimmers are in a triathlon (sp) and so they can't come. :( Though I really don't think we'd loose without them, considering we have the bigest team and all of our swimmers are pretty good. And then when all the 2nd trip ECHO people were gone and we had a meet we still beat the team in 2nd by like 200 points. So you get the point.&nbsp;  Mrs. Edwards anounced that not everyone would be getting to swim 5 events. She said that before we were dominating all the other teams she would ask everyone to, but now it gets more confusing if everyone swims 5 events, and though I am perfectly fine with that. I have no idea what events she'll cut of mine.&nbsp;  And actually Mrs. Edwards won't even be there tomarrow. Solomon just got dropped off here to spend the night, cause I guess he really wanted to go to the swim meet or something. And Elijah has the triathlon so he has to stay but the rest of the family is going to Michigan.  And another thing, we have a church luncheon this Sunday. Which might totally ruin my plan to watch Olympic Swimming.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;know what's&nbsp;happening with that right now, but&nbsp;I'll figure&nbsp;it out&nbsp;before Sunday. :)  Later,  Ellie&nbsp;  Quote:  "When it doubt, faint" - Kiera Knightly

      Well, this morning we (gus) had a swim meet. It was our second for the summer and now we have two left. Anyway this one was sooooooooo much more fun then the last one, because everyone, or almost everyone was there. Last meet most of our older kids were at ECHO. :)  We kicked butt and got first. So on Monday we'll find out exactly how well we personally did. I'm always excited. Plus I beat at least 3 of my times. :) I need to go, Sorry this is so short, Ellie

      Dr. Dobson is going on CNBC to urge every Christian to get involved. I hope you will think about signing this and forwarding to all your family and friends. Dr. James Dobson, with Focus on the Family, pleads for our action. An organization has been granted a Federal Hearing on the same subject by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, DC. Their petition, Number 2493, would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of the gospel of our Lord and Savior, on the airwaves of America. They got 287,000 signatures  to back their stand! If this attempt is successful, all Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will be stopped. This group is also campaigning to remove all Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools! You as a Christian can help! We are praying for at least 1 million signatures. This would defeat their effort and show that there are many Christians alive, well and concerned about our country. As Christians we must unite on this. Please don't take this lightly. We ignored one lady once and lost prayer in our schools and in offices across the nation. Please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard. Together we can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity for the lost to know the Lord. Please press "forward," CLEAN UP THE MESSAGE, and forward this to everyone you think should read this. Now, please sign your name at the bottom (you can only add your name after you have pressed "Forward" or cut and paste the text). Don't delete any other names, just go to the next number and type your name. Please do not sign jointly, such as Mr. &Mrs. .. Each person should sign his/her own name. Please defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion. When you get to 1000 please e-mail back to: "Lisa Norman" electric_yello@hotmail.com > >  > > 1. Jimmy R.

        Everybody needs to read this article! Go to :  urlLink www.usaweekend.com .  And guess what my parents might let me have a party to celebrate the Olympics and everybody can come over and we can watch TV, play games and eat! If you think this is a good idea, please comment cause then my parents might be more likely to let me! :) Also, I am sooooooooooooooooo excited for school to start! (for once) Usually I'm not excited, but I'm taking Biology and we have the coolest class! :) Plus we have Alaina as our teacher which should make it even more cool! My only issue with Biology is that I won't be good with the dissections (sp), I've gotten sick and fainted before in that kind of situation, so I kinda need a lab partner who doesn't mind that kind of stuff! ATTENTION THURSDAY CLASS PEOPLE: the final word on the state fair is that we're meeting at 2:00 pm on Tuesday August 17th inside of Edy's Grand Hall! I hope all you guys can come! It should be tons of fun! :) And I only have one more thing to say : Josh's Concert is on Wednesday!

      I haven't posted in a while, but I've been quite busy! :) Yesterday was our last swim meet! We got first in the city and the whole thing was really exciting. After that our family and the Pulliam's went to the Edward's lake! First we went tubing. Anna and I did it at the same time and it was really fun! :) Then David and Anna tried to go water-skiing, and now that I'm home I wish I would have, cause I think I would have done better then I thought I would. Anyway it was fun, but today my arms and back hurt! :)
