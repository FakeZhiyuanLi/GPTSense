      Following up on the divorce report..  According to newspapers, the main reason for divorces to happen in Singapore, is unreasonable behaviour. I wonder... how do the courple define unreasonable behaviour?? For example, if your partner forget to put the toilet seat back up everytime she uses the toilet, it is unreasonable?? I really wonder... if the usage of unreasonable as an excuse is really just a convenient one.

      Hmmm... I was reading the newspapers today when I chanced upon the report that divorces in Singapore last year were at an all time high. Statistics also showed that the group between age 20-25 were the most vulnerable to divorces. Upon reading all these, I kind of feel quite sad that our so called modern Singaporean society has now set this new "record" Although we are progressing in our economy and technology, morally we are regressing. But beyond the regressing part, it is quite sad to read and hear that people no longer cherish the vows they had made, that "till death do us part". While certainly, in every divorce cases, every couple have their own reasons for splitting, that does not give any excuse to people for splitting.

      Hmmm... just saw this article form a book recently, and thought that it might be worth putting up. =) (It is less than 10% of the book... so I guess I have not broken any copyright laws yet....)   Let's Be Men.  First, I want to talk to the men. Men, we have our work cut out for us, and we need to take it very seriously. What business do we have persuing a relationship with a girl when we still haven't figured out what it means to be a man? We owe it to the women in our lives, our future wives, and to God to figure this out.   Elsabeth Elliot, a woman I deeply respect, wrote to her nephew Pete, "The world cries for men who are strong -- strong in conviction, strong to lead, to stand, to suffer. I pray that you will be that kind of man -- grad that God made you a man, grad to shoulder the burden of manliness in a time when to do so will often bring contempt."   I want to be that kind of man. I have a long way to go. I fail more often than I succeed. I let my sin, my fear, and my laziness get the best of me. But I want to change. I know that God has made me a man for a reason. No matter what culture says, or even what some women say, I want to gladly "shoulder the burden of manliness."   It's not the easiest path. Earlier I told you a book that encouraged men to be passive in relationships. According to the author, the only alternative to passivity is being aggressive and overbearing. Sadly, these are the two courses many men take. But God wants us to reject both of them. Biblical masculinity is neither passive nor rudely aggressive. God calls us to be servant initiators--firm, but gentle; masculine, yet caring; leaders, yet servants. We're called to be protectors, not seducters.   Here are four practical ways you can do these things in your relationships with women.    Assume the responsibility of leading and initiating in your relationships with women.  Leading is a form of serving.  When you provide direction, suggest ideas, and initiate conversation or activities, you're serving your sisters.   This does not mean that you treat women as if you were their husband and the one to lead them in important life decisions. Even during the season of courtship, this isn't your place. Until you're a woman's husband, she is under no obligation to submit to your leadership. If she has a Christian father, that protection and oversight should come from him. But while you shouldn't overstep your bounds, you can serve a woman (and win her trust for the future) by leading and initiating in small ways.   For example, you can serve your sisters by being the one to plan times together. This applies to a courtship as well as friendships with women. My single friends Jacob and Ryan frequently plan get-together at their apartment. They do the work of organizing activities and inviting other guys and girls to participate.   One woman told me what a burden it is when her male friends sit around waiting for women to plan everything. "I don't like it when a man sits there asking, 'So what do you want to do?'" she said, "I want them to make a decision!"   The same principle applies in your courtship (or friendships). Do you initiate conversations? Do you carefully plan your dates? Are you thinking ahead and directing the course of the courtship? It's your job to make sure that it's continuing to grow at a healthy rate. It's your responsibility to make sure you're both guarding your hearts.   As you can see, servant leadership requires work. It means sacrifice. It means going out on a limb and proposing ideas, setting direction, and inviting others to follow. It means listening, taking others' interests and needs into account, and adjusting as neccessary. It means deferring to others at times. Leadership isn't tyranny; it's service rendered. It's difficult, but it's a big part of what it means a man.    Be a spiritual leader in your relationships with women.  Men, we should set the spiritual pace in our relationships with women.   We should be the ones to make sure our relationships aren't merely, superficial and entertainment oriented, but deep, God focused, and characterized by biblical fellowship.   The first important step is to make your own personal growth in godliness a priority. Don't be content to be spiritually lukewarm-strive to set an example of passive for God.   Men, in marriage we'll be called to be spiritual leaders of our homes. Before marriage, let's practice leading in biblical fellowship with friends and during courtship. Then we'll be that much more prepared to do so with our wives and children.    Do Little Things In Your Relationships With Women That Communicate Your Care, Respect, and Desire to protect.   This doesn't have to be complicated. Simply be a gentleman to the women in your life. Your goal is to show through your actions that their status as a woman is a noble one.   Let them feel your concern and respect in as many ways as you possibly can. You can do this through small actions: open the door for them, pull out their chair, escort them to their car (or house) at the end of the night. If you need more guidance, ask a few Christian women for pointers. You'll be amazed how willing they'll help educate you!   In your courtship, remember that you're not doing these things merely to impress or to win a woman's heart. You are doing these things for God's glory. You do them to serve a sister in Christ and honor her as a woman.     Encourage Women to Embrace Godly Femininity.  Look for ways to encourage your sisters in godly femininity. When they make room for you to practice leadership, thank them. When they're humble and gentle, encourage them. Femininity is not weakness. It requires great strength of character for a women to be gentle in an age that screams for her to do otherwise.   When you see woman going against the grain of culture by culivating a skill that will serve her family someday, compliment her. When a girl is pursuing a demanding career, but it is still being feminine, let her know you notice. Let her know you respect her.   Men should be the biggest encouragers and prayer warriors for women who are seeking to glorify God by practicing godly femininity.       A Challenge to the Girls: Be Godly Ladies   I think I can understand how you feel. I'm sure that you can think of ways these biblical truths have been misused and misapplied by domineering and chauvinistic men. I'm sorry that has been the case. Please know that there are many men today who want to spend their lives proving that that's not what biblical masculininity is about.   Don't give up on us. We need your support. We need your prayers. We need you to fix your eyes on God-not on the men who have misrepresented His plan-and live your life in response to His commands for you as a woman.   Here are the four ways you can be sisters to the men in you life and practice mature femininity.    In Your Relationship with Godly Men, Encourage and Make Room for Them to Practice Servant Leadership.  If a man's biggest temptation is to be passive, a woman's biggest temptation is to take control. The man isn't setting a course, so the woman grabs the steering wheel. It might fix things in the short term, but in the long run it only discoutages men from playing their God-given role as initiators.   You can encourage men to be men by refusing to do the work of leading for them. What you want to avoid is developing a habit initiating your relationships with men. This doesn't mean you never do so, but that it's not the normal pattern in your life. Neither does this mean that when you're single, you're supposed to submit to every man you meet. God asks a woman to submit to her husband. But a single woman can, with men whose character warrants it, encourage servant leadership and respond to their initiative.   So if you're in a courtship, make room for him to lead. Step back and let him be one to take charge. How else will he learn to lead? How else can you practice for the time when you will follow a husband?     Be a Sister to the Man in Your Life.  What are the categories you have for Christian men in your life-potential boyfriend, potential husband, no potential whatsoever? I encourage you to drop these categories. The first way you should view a Christian guy is as a brother.   Be a sister to the men in your life. Pray for them. Be yourself. Don't put up a front. Be a friend.     Cultivate the Attitude that Motherhood is a Noble and Fulfilling Calling.  Today many people scorn motherhood and the skills associated with managing a home. In our culture children are viewed as a nuisance, and motherhood is considered a waste of a woman's talents. A college counselor once told me that majority of the female students she worked with secretly longed to get married and have kids, but they were too ashamed to admit it. What a tragedy!   Please don't believe our culture's lies about motherhood. If God has placed that desire in your heart, don't be embarrassed about it. The Bible encourages younger women to learn homemaking skills from older women. Learning to keep a home and love husband and children is part of God's plan for the complete training of younger women (see Titus 2:3). Don't hesitate to learn the practical skills that will one day allow you to serve a family. Search out godly mothers in your loval church from whom you can learn.   You can pocess biblical femininity without being married or having children. As a single woman, you can express your femininity by practicing hospitalty and by caring for and nurturing the people in your life. But you can also honor God's plan for womanhood by agreeing that motherhood is a high and noble calling.    Cultivate Godliness and Inward Beauty in Your Life  A girl once wrote to tell me how God had used Proverbs 7:5 to convict her of being like the wayward woman who led men astray. "I don't want to be a seductress like her," she wrote. "I don't want flirtatiousness or immodest clothing to keep guys from seeing me as a sister in Christ."   If you want godly men to respect and cherish you as a woman, refuse to buy in to our culture's obsession with being physically beautiful and sexually alluring. This is an attitude that springs from the motives of your heart and extends to the way you dress and act around men.     Extracted from   Boy Meets Girl, Joshua Harris

        Woah.... after much deliberation, I finally create my own blog!  I have been thinking of whether or not to set up my own blog over the last few months, especially after reading through some of my friends'blogs and entries. While most of them are pretty interesting and some do reflect certain aspects of their lives which I have never known, some are just erm.... more like reading their resume?? Well, I have now decided to take a step of faith and plunge myself into doing this blog and hopefully, talent scouts can see the entries (and buy the rights to my blog for a million bucks and used it as a script for a Hollywood movie). Hahaha....  Hmm.. it kind of feel weird to type all these things and allowing people to see what has been written. It is almost like I am standing in front of them and allowing them to scrutinise everything in me, such as my pimples, my fats, my shortcomings etc. However, it is also a time for me to really put my thoughts in a way that my friends can see without inhibitions. Hopefully, this blog will not just turn out to be just another self glorifying, self promoting kind of website, but really a chance for me to be brutally honest of my own life and the grace of God upon my life. Certainly, I believe in this, that I am just an ordinary guy being used by an extraordinary God.When I was in the army, there was this saying (by our seniors, not our officers) that we are the unfortunate, led by the unqualified, to do the unnecessary, for the ungrateful. Well.... in life, I believe that when we obey and serve our Creator God with our best, certainly, we will maximise our potential!

      Was just fellowshipping with a brother yesterday night... and we started to talk about this thing called gossip.. now trying to recall all the things we said.  Gossip is one of the vilest poison that the devil has in his arsenal. Many times, it comes disguised in the form of innocent questions, and perhaps, "CONCERN" is quoted as the pretext of its existence. But make no mistakes about it, it is really a form of poison that corrupt the innermost of a person over time, changing faith into cynicism and negativeness. More often than not, I have seen many friendships broken through gossip, even in church. Members have left because of hurts caused by gossip from other people. Many times, even if rumours about certain people were justified, gossip often prevent them from making a full recovery from whatever mistakes they have made. They simply give up.   There is no excuse for gossip to exist at all. In short, always remember, what one sow, one shall reap.  &nbsp;

      Oh... hahaha.. I just chose this heading for fun.... I ain't one to scream.... espcially that I have learnt that it encourages the growth of vocal nodules. Now still on the post recovery stage of flu and headache. It kinda sucks, especially since I had to miss the leaders meeting with Pst Kong last night. I was practically immobilized on my bed sniffing and coughing... Oh well, there are two very good news PstKong shared with the leaders, which I think is not open to the rest...yet. =) But it's kinda exciting.. and hmmm.... not knowing what to expect?? =)

      Humm...  today is the last day that I sang as a Backup Vocalist in Chinese Church. No fanfare, no sobbing or crying. Toward the end of the service, as we were singing the closing song for the service, I was trying to capture every moment in&nbsp;my heart. On looking back, it has been two wonderful years serving as a singer in church, and certainly, I have gained a lot as I serve, not just in terms of techniques or skills, but most of all, a revelation of what is it to be like as a&nbsp;worshipper of Jesus Christ. Over the endless hours of training, I got to know many new friends who provided me with a fresh outlook on life. &nbsp;  Well,&nbsp;certainly, as this door closes, hopefully, another door will open....&nbsp;

       A man was sleeping at night in his cabin when suddenly his room  filled with light, and God appeared. The Lord told the man he had work for him to do, and showed him a large rock in front of his cabin. The Lord explained that the man was to push against the rock with all his might.   So, this the man did, day after day.   For many years he toiled from sunup to sundown, his shoulders set squarely against the cold, massive surface of the unmoving rock, pushing with all of his might. Each night the man returned to his cabin sore and worn out, feeling that his whole day had been spent in vain.   Since the man was showing discouragement, the Adversary (Satan) decided to enter the picture by placing thoughts into the weary mind: "You have been pushing against that rock for a long time, and it hasn't moved."   Thus, he gave the man the impression that the task was impossible and that he was a failure. These thoughts discouraged and disheartened the man.   Satan said, "Why kill yourself over this? Just put in your time, giving just the minimum effort; and that will be good enough." That's   what the weary man planned to do, but decided to make it a matter of prayer and to take his troubled thoughts to the Lord.    "Lord," he said, "I have laboured long and hard in your service, putting all my strength to do that which you have asked. Yet, after all this time, I have not even budged that rock by half a millimetre. What is wrong? Why am I failing?   The Lord responded compassionately, "My friend, when I asked you to serve Me and you accepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all of your strength, which you have done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push. And now you come to Me with your strength spent, thinking that you have failed. But, is that really so? Look at yourself.   Your arms are strong and muscled, your back sinewy and brown; your hands are calloused and strong from constant pressure, your legs have become massive and hard. Through opposition you have grown much, and your abilities now surpass that which you used to have. True, you haven't moved the rock.   But your calling was to be obedient and to push and to exercise your faith and trust in My wisdom. That you have done. Now I, my friend, will move the rock."   At times, when we hear a word from God, we tend to use our own intellect to decipher what He wants, when actually what God wants is just a simple obedience and faith in Him. By all means, exercise the faith that moves mountains, but know that it is still God who moves mountains.   When everything seems to go wrong... just P.U.S.H.   When the job gets you down... just P.U.S.H.   When people don't react the way you think they should. just  P.U.S.H   When your money is gone and the bills are due... just P.U.S.H   When people just don't understand you... just P.U.S.H.   P. = Pray  U. = Until  S. = Something  H. = Happens

      Rejection.  How real the word must have sounded to some of us. Rejection from our peers. Rejection from someone whom we like or have a crush on. Rejection from our parents or siblings. Rejection from someone whom we respect and admire. Rejection is really something that attaches itself to us, and its ugly head will come out in times when we are feeling down or discouraged. It is like a poison that seeks to poison the innermost of our soul, leading us to doubt the value that is placed inside of us by our Father God.   People are not born with a low self inferiority complex. But perhaps, as we grew older in life, the various trials and tests that we faced rubbed off on our confidence. Sometimes, we would face people that reject us, subconsciously or directly. They may not tell us that they reject us directly, but from their words and indifference towards us. Sometimes, it would be better if they say so directly. But regardless of its intensity, it is never an easy pill to swallow. Sometimes, people around us will try to encourage us by saying certain "nice" lines, such as "Well, it's not your fault...", "if you lose a bit of weight, you would attract more attention from the opposite sex...", or even "if you work harder in your school work...", but all these seem to sound hollow in the face of rejection. Perhaps, no one knows about the word more than King David.  Many times, we think of King David as a popular man, a good looking man and a strong leader who never has to face rejection. But as you begin to read the bible, you would know that nothing is further than the truth. He has to deal with rejection all throughout his life. His father did not believe that he is leadership material when Samuel came to his household to seek out the new king of Israel. His elder brothers accused him of being wicked and conceited when he want to encourage them in a battle with the Philistines. His mentor and leader rejected him and sought to kill him. Even when he grew older, his own son rejected him as king and father and sought to kill him too. Yet throughout it all, he has never let the spirit of rejection stop him from reaching out to his destiny. He never allowed the thoughts of rejection to dwell in him and stop him from fulfilling the purposes of God in him. Most of all, he never allowed them to bring forth doubts in God and His goodness. He simply chose to submit to God and to thank God in all things and all circumstances. Most of all, he chose to believe that God loves him and accepts him. This is something, that all of us can choose to do.

      Hmm.. just came back from having cell group... this has really been one real busy week, and it seems as though my hols are now going faster and faster... in two weeks' time I will be going back to the normal life of a student... going to lectures and tutorials. Well, time really flies, especially when you don't keep track of it. Hmmm... I am in a semi melancholic mode again, and I think the last thing now I need is to have someone call and talk about their own lives.... sometimes, I just wish that people can just look beyond the facade and see into the heart. Just pondering over issues that I had faced over my walk with God... so many decisions to make and so many "ifs"...    If I had not made a decision at 17 I want to come to church, I will still not be saved...  If I had not made a decision that I will give up my Post of bring the president of my JC guitar club, I would never have become committed to my cell group and church...  If I had not decided to make a decision to go under Bro Chris, I would not have grown so much...  If I had not made a decision to take on a vow till 21, I would never have become emotionally stable.  If I had not decided to quit ushering on the advice of my CGL, I would never had had a chance to rise up in cg.   If I had not gave up someone I like deeply while rising up, I would never have made it as a CGL.   If I had not step out in faith to do what other won't do and reach out to two old walk-ins called Lawrence and Annie, N110 would never exist today.   If I had not decided to live out my life in the will of God and pursue what my peers are going for right now, E260 would never have multiply.   If I had not decided to learn how to sing in Chinese and preach in Chinese before Pst Kong talked about the missions to China, I would never have been able to reach out to the 5 China members currently in my cell group.    So many ifs.... today, I had just made a new decision in a certain area of my life, that I will seek the will of God first and nothing else, that I will obey Him, even to my own hurt and no matter what my emotions are telling me.  Just gotta pray that the next "if" I add in the next time I do an "If" entry into this blog, I can share a testimony of what God has done in my life, because I had chose to turn "ifs" into "Yes Lord".

      Well, just came back from the Church without walls conference and boy, it has really been a blessing to listen to the teachings of Pst Kong. It kind of bring back memories when I first got saved, due to the friendship of a brother and somehow or someway, I really came to God despite my previous prejudices about Christianity. God really uses people to reach out to us. =)  Hmmm... for those of you who have been reading my blog, you probably did not notice some changes to the poem that I had put up. This is due to the scrutiny of a friend who majored in literature and poems in her JC.... ahahhahaa.... well... but it seem to sound better. Anyway, I just discovered today that this good friend's brother is actually in the cg of the recipient of the poem when I was sending her back after the conference. Hahahhaa.... can see the incredulous looks on the face of my regular car khaki when I said I need to go somewhere else today... hehehe... actually, it was more of an excuse to send someone back... =p Well, gotta think of new excuses next week again....

       When I look into your eyes,  I can see the faith of a mustard seed,  that in its beginning seem small and insignificant, But over time, it grew and flourish  into a mighty tree of old,  that holds through the toughest storms.  When I look into your eyes,  I can see hopes and dreams, of stars in eternity, of the day when you step into your Father's court to receive the crown of glory.  When I look into your eyes, I can see a love so dear,  so gentle and yet so clear for your future Bridegroom and all His glory and for His pair of nail pierced hands.   May the day come that  When I look into your eyes, I see your tears of joy, that God has blessed you with someone, who will go with you to watch the stars, and to hold and cherish you in times both good and bad and may the day come, that you'll say "yes" to the one who's always looking into your eyes, and wishing that you know  you are so dear in his heart.

      I have just came back from a trip to Plaza Singapore to watch Spiderman 2 with my pal Terence and right now it is just one hour before dawn. Amazingly, at this hour I am still feeling awake and my mind is right now still whirling from the movie... certainly, it is a good movie with much food for thought. Peter Parker... the anti hero, for most of the movie, was trying to take away the part of himself which he think is taking away or sacrificing his other desires and dreams. After spending a huge proportion of the movie trying to find his own identity, at the end of it, he accepted his calling as Spiderman...  As I watched the show, I couldn't help but draw certain comparisons to my own Christian walk with God. Hmmm... how sometimes circumstances will put us in places where we never thought that God will take us to, and then, we need to make a choice whether to accept the destiny that God has placed upon us or to walk away from it all for our own dreams. It's amazing on how at the end of the show, that he get what he wants (Mary Jane) and also fulfill the destiny that he has been placed upon.   Certainly, as I was watching the movie, I coul;dn't help but remember a verse in the bible, that God has "made everything beautiful in its time". When we begin to yield ourselves to God for His purpose, He will certainly always brings the best into our lives. Nothing, can ever change that fact that God has made everything beautiful in its time, that in the right season, the blessings and desires that we want will always be given to us.

      Yoz... to all my faithful readers.... it's been 2 weeks since I last posted an article....  It have been 2 very busy weeks for me, and in every area of my life. Cg is growing tremendously, and it has been a time when a lot of things and inner emotions are dealt with and sorted out. I came to see that it is really very often that in time of pressure and stress that you will get to see the best (and worst) of people. Hummm... it has been a time of reflection..  Gotta add more onto this blog soon! My home computer is down, and that is why I have not been seen on icq and msn for some time already...
