      I know you're sitting there with that awful feeling right now of   "hmmm, something is wrong... I just dont feel right... I've forgotten something"  Its ok tho, you can be excused, its not your fault. Its mine. You're right...  There was no Haiku yesterday! You can be excused for feeling a little green around the gills after all, whats life without haiku (not really much diffferent when youre referring to my haikus i guess). Thats why today, im starting a call to action, im gonna get the people who opened my eyes to the wonderful world of haiku to start helping me out.  I bet they ignore me tho...

      Its not fair at all, i think i must be cursed...  Why is it that every time I buy something, within 2 or 3 weeks I see the same thing for sale at a hugely discounted price??  Its just not fair!  The current object of frustration is a Lego set of all things! They have the most amazing set available at the moment, a fully functional backhoe which uses pneumatics to run everything (using 2 air pumps, 7 switches and 10 air rams no less!), which I got for my birthday a couple of weeks ago (thanks Manda!).  3 weeks later, the same kit is now at 80% of the price we got it for!  (get to k-mart asap all you australian lego fans out there!! its well worth it. The most involved and invoving kit ive built from Lego!)  ah well..  just have to go buy another one!

      today is day 2.  of attempt 6.  for quitting smoking this year.  Yesterday was fine, didnt think about it. Today I fear I may be a little pre-occupied...  its 10 o'clock and all I can think of is smoking.  I just hope the poor car-crash victim who benefits from my body being disassembled for recycling appreciates this...

      its funny isnt it... when youre at work, all you can think of is going home, being on holidays, or just being elsewhere. I just took a holiday last week for my birthday (sometimes its nice to have some time to get over your birthday party weekend :) and by the end of the week, i was actually looking forward to coming back to work.  It's now monday, 11.30 am, im back at work. Geeze i wish i was somewhere else!  lucky i heard about blogger.com huh!?

      Sometimes i really just dont understand.  Sometimes people do strange things, with no obvious rhyme nor reason.  To these people i ask...  y 4 u do this 1??  its a simple question really.  just wish i knew the answer.
