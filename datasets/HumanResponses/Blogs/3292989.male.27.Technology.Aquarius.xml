      I am now using blogger instead of MoveableType to post a blog.  The main reason for the switch is so I won't wave to keep up with security problems.  Blogger will do it for me.  Anyway if you want to see the previous articles go  urlLink here .

      Went and saw the new Spiderman movie last night.  Was pretty good.  Had some cheesy lines, but that was expected, it's bbased off a comic book.  Any way go see it it in a theater.  If you enjoyed the first one you will like this one.

      Well, found out what the holes were in my brain.  They weren't holes! They were actually scar tissue from severe migranes.  Anyway, I go get tested for my memory on Monday.  Then they will decide on the kinds of medications I need.  He said if they could get the right meds that it might be possible to remember everything from now on... be kinda crazy.  Had a great biz idea, might start looking into it.  wouldn't cost that much to get up and going.  So I will see.

      The day kind of started off slow.  Just watched the discovery channel about time travel.  Really wierd stuff.  The faster you go, you go into the future.  As soon as you pass the speed of light, you start going back into time.  So one of my questions that they never answered is - So if I am picking up speed and all of the sudden I pass the speed of light, shouldn't I automatically go back to when I wasn't breaking the speed of light.  So really I could never break the speed of light.  Am I making any sense?  So after the discovery channel, went to the pool with the girls again, Tony and I went to Rockfish, hung out with my dad.  We had a talk, he finally listened to me I think.  Guess we will see.  Candice's engagement party was last night.  I took my camera, but didn't really know any one there.  So I did not take pics.     And for all ya'll out there that aren't sure which girl is right for you...   urlLink Mary-Kate or Ashley  that is, take this quiz so you'll know.

Today I was pretty productive, did a shit load of laundry, dishes, and kinda cleaned up.  Then went to Uncle Julio's... Went swimming.  Then tried sushi for the first and last time.  That had to be some of the worst shit ever.  Ended up over at the girls house watching movies.  Just got home.

      didn't do much.  Went to that interview.  I don't think I did well.  I was interviewed by a bunch of BIG guys with shaved heads.  The first thing they asked was "Do you work out?"  So after I realized that it was not going well, when it got to the point where they ask if I had any questions for them... I said "Yeah, do I have to shave my head to work here?"  They just kinda looked at each other for a min. and started to laugh.  It was pretty funny.  Probably one of those times you had to be there.  Later on I went and hung out with the girls for a while at the Goose.  Once we went upstairs I started to get one of my headaches.  I just can't take those flashing lights for to long.  So I left.  Make sure everyone looks at  urlLink Sunday the 13th on the calendar .  Kinda a big day.  Lots going on.  And is any one gonna own up to who put this comment on  urlLink my pic ?  I might want to meet ya :)  tis all

      Well lately I have just been looking around for jobs, mostley in Brazil and other latin american countries.  So if there is anyone out there who stumbles on my web page and knows of anything - grab my resume on the side please.  Went to Fort Worth Weekley music festival Sunday.  Flickerstick was awesome of course.  Also heard another cool band Spoonfed Tribe.  Monday went out to the golf course.  Today I have an interview for a management position... wish me luck.  It is supposed to rain all day today, i think

      Well for those of you who know me, you probably know that I am renowned for my horrible memory.  I went to get it checked out, because I think it is getting worse.  I had an MRI.  While the MRI did not show anything about my memory loss, it does show that I have 2 funny looking small holes in my frontal lobe.  They think it is one of two things.  Either brain bleeds, or early signs of multiple sclerosis.  I personally don't think it is the latter.  I was in a bad 4 wheeler accident when I was in the 8th grade.  I actually cracked the helmet in two.  So it is probably just some old scar tissue from that.  Any way the doc is setting up an appointment for a neurologist just to make sure.  I am not really worried... prob not a big deal.  I am hoping more so that the doctor can help with my memory.

      Being mosquito season again, I started to wonder why we have them... See my  urlLink previous article here .  Any way I was doing some reading over at  urlLink straightdope.com  and found this  urlLink article .  Basically if a mosquito lands on you let him bite you.  It's kinda hard to let him do it because everyone's reaction is to kill them.  Anyway, once he bites you stretch your skin.  Her needle will get stuck, and she can't stop the blood from coming in.  She will eventually rupture.    I know it's kinda a sick way for them to die.  But they are stealing your blood.  Once they bite you, you will still get a mosquito bump any way...  So you might as well kill them slowly :P

      If you want to have a high quality pic printed you can always save the file to a CD or what ever media and take it to a Walgreens and have them printed.  Personally I use Shutterfly.  When you are looking at a photo that you want to print, there will be a link in the upper right hand corner it says "print this photo with shutterfly".  The pictures are high quality, they don't fade, etc... 4x6's are 29 cents.  Cheaper than taking them in to get done.  Do what ever, it don't bother me...

      I know that I have not been posting much lately, but this past week has pretty much been hell.  I have just had a bad week.  Yesterday was just the iceing on the cake.  First a tree fell on my foot.  No, I am not talking about a potted tree.  I am talking about a 15-20 foot tree.  It got a hold of my big toe.  Then after work, I got into a wreck.  Some lady backed into me.  So Monday I have to take care of that....  Hope next week is better :(
