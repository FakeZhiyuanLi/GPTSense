       Wow!  I haven't been on here in like forever doode! Let's see ...My middle child turned 3 on Feb. 25th. My oldest will be 14 on April 27th. Her hair is so short now. She looks so much older. My lil one will be 1 on June 5th. Still a SAHM. God I wish all the Work from Home ads weren't scams. I'd love to have some extra money that is just mine. Sigh hehe well I'm off to  urlLink Neopets

       urlLink MTV.com - Onair - Realworld - Season14   Ok I'm a sucker for these reality shows and I read about the scoop on mtv.com...I was dissapointed Frankie left this season of the Real World San Diego but in a way maybe it was fate considering all the bad stuff that happened after she left. With all the publicity of the "rape" that happened in November. I'm wondering if they are going to have a reunion special like all the others have done before them. What the heck I'm nosey. LOL!

       Weee!  It's been a while since I've wrote on my bloggie. Well I got sick again and the Dr was like hey ya wanna get gastric bypass surgery? For what a virus? Woo!  Yes I am over weight but dang I'm not ready for that step! Ironically she didn't even weigh me this visit so she doesn't know how much I've lost. :P Can you say loopy? Anyway she wants blood work done. So I will be doing that on the weekend.  Joy!
