      Well, I got done with the third day of school.  I am sad cuz tonight was supposed to be our high school's first football game of the season, and it's been raining all day.  So chances are I'm not going.   On the bright side, I am uber proud of myself because I was soo smart and already figured out where to go for classes by the second day, so I only used the map and schedule for the first day of school.  Our school is super huge too, so that must be like a world record or something for figuring out your schedule.  LOL.   Something that makes me mad though is the fact that I already have, like, serious homework, and lots of it, on just the third day of school.  We're talking a paper for English, numbering measures on five songs for Orchestra, tons of Math homework, a poem thingy for Spanish, an article for Health, a test in English next Friday (so that means I have to study), and there are a few other things I can't think of right this moment.  This weekend my family MIGHT be going to the Indiana State Fair, though we're not sure.  I hope we do go, cuz I've never been, and we've been living here since I was in fifth grade. :(  Also, I am going to youth group with Anna Sunday night, so that should be fun.  I have to call Jaime cuz i haven't seen her in three months and I just saw her two times today and she told me to call her.  And Oprah today should be, how should I word this, interesting.  I don't know the word for it, but I want to watch it.  It's about this woman who was held captive in this millionaire's basement for a reeeeally long time, and how later when she tried to tell police about it, they wouldn't believe her.  And so I should get off now, cuz it's gonna start in 5 minutes.  I'll post later.

      Well.  The first day of school.  I was soooo nervous, let me tell ya.  I had butterflies in my stomach ever since the night before.  It was actually a fairly okay day, i found out one of my good friends is in my English class, which made me happy.  I did get lost twice tho :) which is kind of sad since one of those times the class i was looking for was fairly close to the one i left, lol.  I had to sit through many a lecture on classroom policies, got some fat books, and got a huge headache listening to my spanish teacher babble away saying things that i couldn't understand.  It was actually kind of funny, because she wouldn't talk to us in English so when we tried to ask her what she said she would try to explain in Spanish, which would just confuse us more.  We were all looking at each other with completely confused faces, and I could hardly believe she actually thought we could understand everything she said.  The irony here is that the period after Spanish is... drumroll please.... English!  So I'm having a hard time switching back and forth so fast, from Spanish 2 to British literature.  BORING, but i have to deal with it.  Well i don't know what else to talk about, so if i don't have much homework i'll post tomorrow.  I already have homework tonight!  Like, actual, homework!  Grrrr!  I better get to it, so ciao!
