      Wow, what a busy day. I have barely been at my desk. I bought some new fonts today, hooray! Of course I had to pick up stuff for other people too, like a Tungsten C and some canned air. I finally got my Quark 6.1 to install. I hate Quark. They make people jump through so many hoops just to use their product. Brian comes home tonight, yay!

      I'm having one of those days where all the little things are going wrong. Tore a contact lens, cut my thumb while feeding the cats. Running late. Blah!  I wonder if my crafty-ness will ever wear off. That's all I want to do. I go through phases I guess. This happens every now and again, and then it's back to books, or some other thing to occupy my time.  The season finale of 24 was pretty good last night. It's not everyday you get to see someone's arm chopped off on TV.  ===== Nine*Poems  urlLink www.ninepoems.com

      I spent most of my weekend designing a new web site. It's called Nine*Poems Creative Outlet,  urlLink www.ninepoems.com . It is just for fun, but hey if I make a couple of bucks, that's cool too.  I also spent time with my dad and sister yesterday. They drove me nuts. My sister took a nap on my couch and she wouldn't get up to go to dinner. So I had to spray her with the water bottle we use on the kitties when they are being bad.  This morning, got an oil change and a smoothie. Not at the same place.   Brian leaves for Bozeman tomorrow to help his brother move from Montana to San Jose. He's convinced they are going to be stranded in the Nevada desert with the U-Haul truck. Sucks to be him!

      I love that it's Friday. Hooray for that! My headache ceased and now I'm just having a relaxing day. Went to lunch, got the car washed at the Puddle and even got new floormats. Hooray, no more Land Cruiser mats!

      I feel horrible. I woke up with a headache this morning and it still hurts. In one of my dreams this morning, I actually became aware of my headache in the dream. That's a great way to start off the day. Then I made the mistake of eating half of a low-carb bagel and now I feel like yakking! So nasty.  In other news, Paul and Scottie both can go piss up a rope since I watched that car link this morning, with my horrible headache! Ouch.

      I hate Quark. If only QuarkXPress wasn't the frontrunner of desktop publishing.

      When I walk into work every morning I always have the feeling that people still perceive me as a student. Perhaps it is my "casual Friday is everyday!" attire or my young demeanor. I get stopped all the time on campus by people handing fliers out for summer jobs. If only! But today was really funny, because as I approached the building I work in, a person is headed for the door too. It appears that he wants to go to our Walk-In center for help. As he sees me approaching the door, he speeds up and goes in front of me, trying to beat me out to the help desk. Nothing gave me more pleasure than to turn right instead of left and head for my office where I unlocked the door while he stood at the desk looking at me. God people are rude.  In other campus news, we got a letter from Elizabeth Hoffman this morning. It included these phrases: "pave a new road," "As we map the course," and "No matter what course we chart."  Apparently the PR person who wrote this one digs transportation.

      As some of you know, I've been blogging since November 2001, because I'm a geek of course. However, that blog is all serious and heavy. Why not have a fun one to share with friends!

      The last time I made a post. This week has been long and I'm very happy it's Friday. Lunch was great today because we spent the entire time talking about Gym class. I had forgotten so many of the games we had to play. This of course was brought about by the movie Dodge Ball, which I hope to see to tonight.  Today, I decided to listen to classical. For some reason, listening to classical has made me crave a cup of coffee. Something about the sound must make me want to act differently. I feel as if I am working harder too.   Speaking of other sounds, I've become a total NPR freak. I don't remember the last time I listened to real music in the car. I've learned a lot of interesting things since I started listening to NPR everyday. Gotta keep learning!  This weekend is Amanda's birthday party which I'm really looking forward to. I just spoke with Brian and asked him again if he thinks he will be able to PTO tomorrow so he can come too. Truly he doesn't know, since it depends on the planes, but I just know it won't work out and I'll have to go alone.   Anyway, back to work!  Have a great weekend everybody!

      I had such a great weekend, and I'm so sad it's over. Saturday, Amanda came over and we did girly crafts and watched movies. Then, Bri and I went to Old C's. Yesterday, Brian called in sick and we went to the Rockies game and then had beers at Rock Bottom and then saw Harry Potter. When we got home, we went for a walk and then laid in a park near our apartment and just looked at the stars. After all that, we went to bed at 10:15. PERFECT!

      I've had a busy morning already, but I'm looking forward to an afternoon of fun errands and visiting the Fine Arts current exhibit. Mike is out today due to an irritated plantar muscle problem, so there was talk for awhile that I was going to attend this online meeting with someone in London. However, she didn't show, which was just fine with me. There is a hilarious new article in BUST called "what up, Wimpster?" It's totally about the emo boys. I desperately want to read it to my sister. That's about it for now.

      The people in my workplace are driving me nuts. I bust my butt to get things online or in print that they need out there by their ridiculous deadline. Now that I have my own deadline, which I have every year at the exact same time, they can't bring themselves to simply read a few pages of content and give me feedback. One person in particular is trying to give me more work to do for her TODAY, ha! I am so not doing it. I think it's because people just don't grasp what it is to make a publication, not to mention make two publications simultaneously. FUCKERS.

      "And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism."  - John Kerry  Well put.
