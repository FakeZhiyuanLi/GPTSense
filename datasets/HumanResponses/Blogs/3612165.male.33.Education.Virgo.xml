      Dialect Map of American English   Click on the map for a larger version  Not all people who speak a language speak it the same way. A language can be subdivided into any number of dialects which each vary in some way from the parent language. The term, accent, is often incorrectly used in its place, but an accent refers only to the way words are pronounced, while a dialect has its own grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and common expressions as well as pronunciation rules that make it unique from other dialects of the same language. Another term, idiolect, refers to the manner of speaking of an individual person. No two people's idiolects are exactly the same, but people who are part of the same group will have enough verbal elements in common to be said to be speaking the same dialect.   Three things are needed for a new dialect to develop: a group of people living in close proximity to each other; this group living in isolation (either geographically or socially) from other groups; and the passage of time. Given enough time, a dialect may evolve to the point that it becomes a different language from the one it started as. English began existence as a Germanic dialect called Anglo Saxon that was brought to England by invaders from Germany. The Anglo Saxon peoples in England were now geographically isolated from their cousins in Germany which allowed the dialects to evolve in different directions. Other invaders would also influence the development of English with their languages until the modern English we speak today has become so different from the modern German spoken in Germany that a speaker of one cannot understand a speaker of the other. Thus English and German are considered to be two different, though related, languages. The other modern languages in this family are Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Icelandic.   This issue of mutual understandability is what in theory is used to determine what is a dialect and what is a language, but in reality there are social and political issues involved too. The government of a country might declare that all the languages spoken in that country are actually dialects of one language in order to create the illusion of polital unity, while the government of another country might declare that the dialect spoken by its people is actually a unique language from other countries that speak dialects of the same language in order to create a sense of national pride. History is full of governments that have tried to impose a single language on all of its people with varying results: sometimes the minority languages go entirely extinct, sometimes they are reduced to surviving only as dialects of the majority language, and sometimes new languages are unintentionally created by a blending of the two languages.   This brings us to three other language terms that are worth mentioning here. When two or more groups of people who speak different languages need to communicate with each other on a regular basis and do not want to actually learn each others' language (such as when the European merchants started trading with other peoples around the world), they may develop what is called a pidgin language. This is a simplified language that usually has as few words as possible in its vocabulary (taking some from both languages) and has been stripped of any fancier grammatical rules like the use of multiple verb conjugations and tenses - a kind of "Me Tarzan, you Jane" way of talking. A pidgin is nobody's native language and is used only in business settings. In fact, the word "pidgin" may be derived from the way Chinese merchants mispronounced the English word "business." However, in some cases, the children in one of these areas might grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. When this happens, the pidgin can grow in complexity into a creole language with a larger set of grammatical rules and a much larger vocabulary that share elements of all the languages that went into creating it.   Finally, jargon is a specialized vocabulary used by people within a particular discipline such as medical jargon for doctors, legal jargon for lawyers, or academic jargon for college professors. While jargon words occasionally filter up into a mainstream dialect, they are usually used only by experts and only when they are discussing their particular field. Critics argue, with some justification, that jargon needlessly complicates a statement that could be expressed in a more clear manner. Users of it argue, also with justification, that it is a more precise manner of speaking, although many examples can be found (especially in politics and business) where it has been used intentionally to obscure the fact that the speaker is trying to avoid being precise.   The modern development of communications technology may possibly slow down the evolution of dialects and languages. For the first time in history, a single dialect (sometimes called Network Standard) can be broadcast over an entire country, so very few people are actually living in geographic isolation anymore. However, the existence of racism, poverty, and class distinctions cause some groups to remain socially isolated from the mainstream of a culture, giving rise to social dialects like Black English (Ebonics) spoken by some African Americans in urban areas. There was recently a great deal of political controversy (ignoring the linguistic facts) over whether Ebonics should be considered a unique language, a "legitimate" dialect of English, or "illegimate" gutterspeak. Also, teenagers enjoy creating their own dialects that they can use to quickly determine who is or is not part of the "in crowd" and as a "secret language" in front of their parents. These dialects tend to go in and out of fashion very quickly; by the time an expression has filtered up to the mainstream dialect adults understand, the teenagers have moved on to something else. Even the Internet has given birth to what might be called a new social dialect (derived from hacker jargon) containing words like IMHO, IIRC, and ROTFLMAO.   Contrary to what your teachers probably tried to tell you, there is no such thing as "correct English." Any manner of speaking that is following the rules of a dialect is equally "correct." Words like ain't are "real" words in some dialects and perfectly acceptable to use. However, people are judged by the way they speak, and dialects carry different levels of social prestige with them based on the prejudices within a society. Generally, the southern dialects of American English carry a lower prestige, at least among northerners who will assume that a person speaking a southern dialect is less intelligent and less educated than they are. Some educated southerners even feel this way and will "correct" their speech to meet northern standards. The New York City dialect carries the lowest prestige of all (Received Standard, a dialect of British English used by the BBC and the royal family, carries the highest prestige - even among Americans). For this reason, schools try to rid children of the local dialects they learned from their family and friends in favor of a more prestigious one. (Of course, some sentences like, "Me are a educated person," would be incorrect in every dialect.)   The map and list below show the major (and a few minor) geographic dialects and subdialects of English spoken in the United States. Many of these may be further subdivided into local subdialects that are not shown here. Obviously, the borders between dialect regions are not well defined lines as a map like this would imply, but a gradual transition extending on both sides of the line.       Click on the map for a larger version  General Northern (green, yellow, and blue)  This is sometimes also refered to as General American and is used in almost two-thirds of the country. It breaks down into the dialect regions below.  Northern  New England  Many of the Northern dialects can trace their roots to this dialect which was spread westward by the New England settlers as they migrated west. It carries a high prestige due to Boston's early economic and cultural importance and the presence of Harvard University. A famous speaker is Katherine Hepburn. They sometimes call doughnuts cymbals, simballs, and boil cakes.  New England, Eastern (1)  This is one of the most distinctive of all the American dialects. R's are often dropped, but an extra R is added to words that end with a vowel. A is pronounced AH so that we get "Pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd" and "Pepperidge Fahm remembuhs."  Boston Urban (2)  Like many big cities, Boston has its own dialects that are governed more by social factors like class and ethnicity than by geographic location. Greater Boston Area is the most widely spoken and is very similar to Eastern New England. Brahmin is spoken by the upper aristocratic class like Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island. Central City Area is what most of us think of as being the "Boston Accent." In the last few years, Saturday Night Live has featured this dialect among a group of rowdy teenagers who like to videotape themselves. Also think of Cliff on Cheers, the only character on this Boston-based show to actually speak a Boston dialect.  New England, Western (3)  Less distinctive than Eastern, but more influential on the other Northern dialects.  Hudson Valley (4)  New York was originally a Dutch colony, and that language influenced this dialect's development. Some original Hudson Valley words are stoop (small porch) and teeter-totter. They call doughnuts (which were invented by the Dutch) crullers and olycooks.  New York City (5)  Unlike Boston and other urban dialects, New York City stands by itself and bears little resemblence to the other dialects in this region. It is also the most disliked and parodied of any American dialect (even among New Yorkers), possibly because many Americans tend dislike large cities. When an R comes after a vowel, it is often dropped. IR becomes OI, but OI becomes IR, and TH becomes D as in "Dey sell tirlets on doity-doid street" and fugedaboudit (forget about it). This pronounciation is particularly associated with Brooklyn but exists to some extent throughout the city. The thickness of a speaker's dialect is directly related to their social class, but these features have been fading within all classes over recent decades. Famous speakers are Rosie Perez, Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinnie, Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, and (if you're old enough to remember) the Bowery Boys.  Bonac (6)  Named for Accabonac Creek in eastern Long Island, this dialect is rapidly dying out due to the influx of people from other areas. Back when New York City belonged to the Dutch, this area was part of New England, and Bonac shows elements of both dialects.  Inland Northern (7)  Combines elements of Western New England and Upper Midwestern. Marry, merry, and Mary are pronounced the same. They call doughnuts friedcakes.  San Francisco Urban (8)  Unlike the rest of California, which in the early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West, San Francisco continued to be settled by people from the Northeast and Northern Midwest, and elements of their dialects (North Midland, Upper Midwestern, Inland Northern) can be found. Mission dialect, spoken by Irish Catholics in a specific part of the city is very much like the New York City dialect.  Upper Midwestern (9)  Originally settled by people from New England and New York State who brought those dialects, this area was also influenced by Southerners coming up the Mississippi River as well as the speech patterns of the German and Scandinavian immigrants and the Canadian English dialects from over the border. It's sometimes referred to as a "Midwestern twang." They call jelly doughnuts bismarks. Minnewegian (Minnesota / Norwegian), a subdialect spoken in the northernmost part of this region was spoofed in the movies Fargo and Drop Dead Gorgeous.  Chicago Urban (10)  Influenced by the Midland and Southern dialects. Often spoken by the late John Belushi (Chicago's Second City comedy theater supplied many Saturday Night Live actors). SNL used to spoof it in the "Da Bears, Da Bulls" sketches. They call any sweet roll doughnuts.  North Midland (11)  Created as the people in Pennsylvania migrated westward and influenced by Scotch-Irish, German, and English Quaker settlers. This and the South Midland dialect can actually be considered a separate Midland Dialect region that serves as a transition zone between the north and south. They call doughnuts belly sinkers, doorknobs, dunkers, and fatcakes.  Pennsylvania German-English (12)  This was strongly influenced by Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German spoken by people in this area (in this context, "Dutch" is actually a mispronunciation of the German word, "Deutsch," which means "German"). Its grammar allows sentences like "Smear your sister with jam on a slice of bread" and "Throw your father out the window his hat." They call doughnuts fasnacht, and they also invented dunking - from the German "dunken" (to dip).  Western  Compared with the Eastern United States, the Western regions were settled too recently for very distinctive dialects to have time to develop or to be studied in detail. Many words originally came from Spanish, cowboy jargon, and even some from the languages of the Native Americans: adobe, beer bust, belly up, boneyard, bronco, buckaroo, bunkhouse, cahoots, corral, greenhorn, hightail, hoosegow, lasso, mustang, maverick, roundup, wingding.  Rocky Mountain (13)  Originally developed from the North Midland and Northern dialects, but was then influenced by the Mormon settlers in Utah and English coal miners who settled in Wyoming. Some words that came from this dialect are kick off (to die), cache (hiding place), and bushed (tired). They also call jelly doughnuts bismarks.  Pacific Northwest (14)  Influenced by settlers from the Midwest and New England as well as immigrants from England, Germany, Scandinavia, and Canada. Much earlier, a pidgin called Chinook Jargon was developed between the languages of the Native American tribes of this area. It would later also be used and influenced by the European settlers who wished to communicate with them. A few words from Chinook Jargon like high muckamuck (important person) are still used in this dialect today. (Note that, in this case, the word "jargon" has a different meaning from the one discussed above)  Alaska (not shown)  Developed out of the Northern, Midland, and Western dialects. Also influenced by the native languages of the Alutes, Innuit, and Chinook Jargon. Some words that originated here are: bush (remote area), cabin fever, mush (to travel by dog sled), parka, stateside.  Pacific Southwest (15)  The first English speakers arrived here from New York, Ohio, Missouri, New England, and other parts of the Northeast and Midwest in the 1840s, bringing the Northern and North Midland dialects with them. Words originally used by the gold miners of this period are still used today: pay dirt (valuable discovery), pan out (to succeed), and goner (doomed person). The early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West. The people here are particularly fond of creating new slang and expressions, and, since Hollywood is located here, these quickly get spread to the rest of the country and the world (the influence of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was examined in Verbatim : part one, part two). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, an extreme exaggeration of this dialect that came to be known as "Valley Girl" or "Surfer Dude" was popular among teenagers and much parodied in the media with phrases like "gag me with a spoon" and "barf me back to the stone age." Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Whoopie Goldberg in her one women show are two famous examples.  Southwestern (16)  By the time this area became part of the United States, there had already been as many as ten generations of Spanish speaking people living here, so the Mexican dialect of Spanish had an important influence on this area that became a melting pot for dialects from all over the USA. Some local words are: caballero, cantina, frijoles, madre, mesa, nana, padre, patio, plaza, ramada, tortilla.  Hawaii (not shown)  The original language of the Native Hawaiians is part of the Polynesian family. English speakers arrived in 1778, but many other settlers also came from China, Portugal, Japan, Korea, Spain, and the Philippines to influence the modern dialect. Hawaiian Creole developed from a pidgin English spoken on the sugar plantations with workers from Hawaii and many other countries. Some words are: look-see, no can, number one (the best), plenty (very). It isn't widely spoken anymore. Nonstandard Hawaiian English developed from Hawaiian Creole and is spoken mostly by teenagers. Standard Hawaiian English is part of the Western dialect family but shows less influence from the early New England dialect than any other American dialect. It has many words borowed from the original Hawaiian as well as some from the other Asian languages mentioned above: aloha, hula, kahuna, lei, luau, muumuu, poi, ukulele.    Click on the map for a larger version  General Southern (purple and red)  This dialect region matches the borders of the Confederate states that seceded during the "Confederate War" and is still a culturally distinct region of the United States. Since it was largely an agricultural area, people tended to move around less than they did in the north, and as a result, the subdialects are much less uniform than those of the General Northern regions and have much more clearly defined boundaries. Other languages that had an important influence on it are French (since the western region was originally French territory) and the African languages spoken by the people brought over as slaves. People tend to speak slower here than in the north creating the famous southern "drawl." I is pronounced AH, and OO is pronounced YOO, as in "Ah'm dyoo home at fahv o'clock." An OW in words like loud is pronounced with a slided double sound AOO (combining the vowel sounds in "hat" and "boot"). Some local words are: boogerman, funky (bad smelling), jump the broomstick (get married), kinfolks, mammy, muleheaded, overseer, tote, y'all.  South Midland (17)  This area, dominated by the Appalachian Mountains and the Ozark Mountains, was originally settled by the Pennsylvania Dutch moving south from the North Midland areas and the Scotch-Irish moving west from Virginia. A TH at the end of words or syllables is sometimes pronounced F, and the word ARE is often left out of sentences as they are in Black English. An A is usually placed at the beginning of verb that ends with ING, and the G is dropped; an O at the end of a word becomes ER. ("They a-celebratin' his birfday by a-goin' to see 'Old Yeller' in the theatah"). A T is frequently added to words that end with an S sound. Some words are: bodacious, heap, right smart (large amount), set a spell, and smidgin. American English has retained more elements of the Elizabethan English spoken in the time of Shakespeare than modern British English has, and this region has retained the most. Some Elizabethan words that are extinct in England are: bub, cross-purposes, fall (autumn), flapjack, greenhorn, guess (suppose), homely, homespun, jeans, loophole, molasses, peek, ragamuffin, reckon, sorry (inferior), trash, well (healthy).  Ozark (18)  Made famous by the Beverly Hillbillies, this isolated area was settled by people from the southern Appalachian region and developed a particularly colorful manner of speaking.  Southern Appalachian (19)  It is a popular myth that there are a few remote regions here that still speak an unchanged form of Elizabethan English, but it isn't true. Linguists are still studying the specific differences with South Midland.  Southern  As the northern dialects were originally dominated by Boston, the southern dialects were heavily influenced by Charleston, Richmond, and Savannah. They tend to drop Rs the way New Englanders do, but they don't add extra Rs. Some words are: big daddy (grandfather), big mamma (grandmother), Confederate War (Civil War), cooter (turtle), fixing to (going to), goober (peanut), hey (hello), mouth harp (harmonica), on account of (because).  Virginia Piedmont (20)  When an R comes after a vowel, it becomes UH, and AW becomes the slided sound, AH-AW. Thus, four dogs becomes fo-uh dahawgs. Some local words are: hoppergrass (grasshopper), old-field colt (illegitimate child), school breaks up (school lets out), weskit (vest).  Coastal Southern (21)  Very closely resembles Virginia Piedmont but has preserved more elements from the colonial era dialect than any other region of the United States outside Eastern New England. Some local words are: catty-corner (diagonal), dope (soda, Coca-Cola), fussbox (fussy person), kernal (pit), savannah (grassland), Sunday child (illegitimate child). They call doughnuts cookies.  Gullah (22)  Sometimes called Geechee, this creole language is spoken by some African Americans on the coastal areas and coastal islands of Georgia and South Carolina and was featured in the novel on which the musical, Porgy and Bess, was based. It combines English with several West African languages: Mende, Yoruba, Wolof, Kongo, Twi, Vai, Temne, Ibo, Ewe, Fula, Umbundu, Hausa, Bambara, Fante, and more. The name comes either from the Gola tribe in Liberia or the Ngola tribe in Angola. The grammar and pronunciation are too complicated to go into here, but some words are: bad mouth (curse), guba (peanut - from which we get the English word goober), gumbo (okra), juju (magic), juke (disorderly, wicked), peruse (to walk leisurely), samba (to dance), yam (sweet potato).  Gulf Southern (23)  This area was settled by English speakers moving west from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas, as well as French speaking settlers spreading out from Louisiana, especially the Acadians (see "Cajuns" below). Some words are: armoire (wardrobe), bayou (small stream), bisque (rich soup), civit cat (skunk), flitters (pancakes), gallery (porch), hydrant (faucet), neutral ground (median strip), pecan patty (praline).  Louisiana (24)  There's a lot going on down here. Many people in southern Louisiana will speak two or three of the dialects below. Cajun French (the Cajuns were originally French settlers in Acadia, Canada - now called Nova Scotia - who were kicked out when the British took over; in 1765, they arrived in New Orleans which was still French territory) carries the highest prestige of the French dialects here and has preserved a number of elements from the older French of the 1600s. It has also borrowed some words from the Spanish who once controlled this area. There are many local variations of it, but they would all be mutually understandable with each other as well as - with some effort - the standard French in France. Cajun English borrows vocabulary and grammar from French and gives us the famous pronunciations "un-YON" (onion) and "I ga-RON-tee" as well as the phrase "Let de good times role!", but movies about cajuns usually get the rest wrong. A famous authentic speaker is humorist Justin Wilson, who had a cooking show on PBS, with his catch phrase, "How y'all are? I'm glad for you to see me." New Orleans is pronounced with one syllable: "Nawlns." There is another dialect of English spoken in New Orleans that is informally, and some would say pejoratively, called Yat (from the greeting, "Where y'at"), that resembles the New York City (particularly Brooklyn) dialect (more info). Provincial French was the upper class dialect of the pre-Cajun French settlers and closely resembles Standard French but isn't widely spoken anymore since this group no longer exists as a separate social class. Louisiana French Creole blends French with the languages of the West Africans who were brought here as slaves. It is quite different from both the Louisiana and standard dialects of French but is very similar to the other creoles that developed between African and French on various Caribbean Islands. Married couples may speak Creole to each other, Cajun French with other people, and English to their children.

Northern  New England  Many of the Northern dialects can trace their roots to this dialect which was spread westward by the New England settlers as they migrated west. It carries a high prestige due to Boston's early economic and cultural importance and the presence of Harvard University. A famous speaker is Katherine Hepburn. They sometimes call doughnuts cymbals, simballs, and boil cakes.  New England, Eastern (1)  This is one of the most distinctive of all the American dialects. R's are often dropped, but an extra R is added to words that end with a vowel. A is pronounced AH so that we get "Pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd" and "Pepperidge Fahm remembuhs."  Boston Urban (2)  Like many big cities, Boston has its own dialects that are governed more by social factors like class and ethnicity than by geographic location. Greater Boston Area is the most widely spoken and is very similar to Eastern New England. Brahmin is spoken by the upper aristocratic class like Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island. Central City Area is what most of us think of as being the "Boston Accent." In the last few years, Saturday Night Live has featured this dialect among a group of rowdy teenagers who like to videotape themselves. Also think of Cliff on Cheers, the only character on this Boston-based show to actually speak a Boston dialect.  New England, Western (3)  Less distinctive than Eastern, but more influential on the other Northern dialects.  Hudson Valley (4)  New York was originally a Dutch colony, and that language influenced this dialect's development. Some original Hudson Valley words are stoop (small porch) and teeter-totter. They call doughnuts (which were invented by the Dutch) crullers and olycooks.  New York City (5)  Unlike Boston and other urban dialects, New York City stands by itself and bears little resemblence to the other dialects in this region. It is also the most disliked and parodied of any American dialect (even among New Yorkers), possibly because many Americans tend dislike large cities. When an R comes after a vowel, it is often dropped. IR becomes OI, but OI becomes IR, and TH becomes D as in "Dey sell tirlets on doity-doid street" and fugedaboudit (forget about it). This pronounciation is particularly associated with Brooklyn but exists to some extent throughout the city. The thickness of a speaker's dialect is directly related to their social class, but these features have been fading within all classes over recent decades. Famous speakers are Rosie Perez, Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinnie, Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, and (if you're old enough to remember) the Bowery Boys.  Bonac (6)  Named for Accabonac Creek in eastern Long Island, this dialect is rapidly dying out due to the influx of people from other areas. Back when New York City belonged to the Dutch, this area was part of New England, and Bonac shows elements of both dialects.  Inland Northern (7)  Combines elements of Western New England and Upper Midwestern. Marry, merry, and Mary are pronounced the same. They call doughnuts friedcakes.  San Francisco Urban (8)  Unlike the rest of California, which in the early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West, San Francisco continued to be settled by people from the Northeast and Northern Midwest, and elements of their dialects (North Midland, Upper Midwestern, Inland Northern) can be found. Mission dialect, spoken by Irish Catholics in a specific part of the city is very much like the New York City dialect.  Upper Midwestern (9)  Originally settled by people from New England and New York State who brought those dialects, this area was also influenced by Southerners coming up the Mississippi River as well as the speech patterns of the German and Scandinavian immigrants and the Canadian English dialects from over the border. It's sometimes referred to as a "Midwestern twang." They call jelly doughnuts bismarks. Minnewegian (Minnesota / Norwegian), a subdialect spoken in the northernmost part of this region was spoofed in the movies Fargo and Drop Dead Gorgeous.  Chicago Urban (10)  Influenced by the Midland and Southern dialects. Often spoken by the late John Belushi (Chicago's Second City comedy theater supplied many Saturday Night Live actors). SNL used to spoof it in the "Da Bears, Da Bulls" sketches. They call any sweet roll doughnuts.  North Midland (11)  Created as the people in Pennsylvania migrated westward and influenced by Scotch-Irish, German, and English Quaker settlers. This and the South Midland dialect can actually be considered a separate Midland Dialect region that serves as a transition zone between the north and south. They call doughnuts belly sinkers, doorknobs, dunkers, and fatcakes.  Pennsylvania German-English (12)  This was strongly influenced by Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German spoken by people in this area (in this context, "Dutch" is actually a mispronunciation of the German word, "Deutsch," which means "German"). Its grammar allows sentences like "Smear your sister with jam on a slice of bread" and "Throw your father out the window his hat." They call doughnuts fasnacht, and they also invented dunking - from the German "dunken" (to dip).  Western  Compared with the Eastern United States, the Western regions were settled too recently for very distinctive dialects to have time to develop or to be studied in detail. Many words originally came from Spanish, cowboy jargon, and even some from the languages of the Native Americans: adobe, beer bust, belly up, boneyard, bronco, buckaroo, bunkhouse, cahoots, corral, greenhorn, hightail, hoosegow, lasso, mustang, maverick, roundup, wingding.  Rocky Mountain (13)  Originally developed from the North Midland and Northern dialects, but was then influenced by the Mormon settlers in Utah and English coal miners who settled in Wyoming. Some words that came from this dialect are kick off (to die), cache (hiding place), and bushed (tired). They also call jelly doughnuts bismarks.  Pacific Northwest (14)  Influenced by settlers from the Midwest and New England as well as immigrants from England, Germany, Scandinavia, and Canada. Much earlier, a pidgin called Chinook Jargon was developed between the languages of the Native American tribes of this area. It would later also be used and influenced by the European settlers who wished to communicate with them. A few words from Chinook Jargon like high muckamuck (important person) are still used in this dialect today. (Note that, in this case, the word "jargon" has a different meaning from the one discussed above)  Alaska (not shown)  Developed out of the Northern, Midland, and Western dialects. Also influenced by the native languages of the Alutes, Innuit, and Chinook Jargon. Some words that originated here are: bush (remote area), cabin fever, mush (to travel by dog sled), parka, stateside.  Pacific Southwest (15)  The first English speakers arrived here from New York, Ohio, Missouri, New England, and other parts of the Northeast and Midwest in the 1840s, bringing the Northern and North Midland dialects with them. Words originally used by the gold miners of this period are still used today: pay dirt (valuable discovery), pan out (to succeed), and goner (doomed person). The early twentieth century saw an influx of people from the South and other parts of the West. The people here are particularly fond of creating new slang and expressions, and, since Hollywood is located here, these quickly get spread to the rest of the country and the world (the influence of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was examined in Verbatim : part one, part two). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, an extreme exaggeration of this dialect that came to be known as "Valley Girl" or "Surfer Dude" was popular among teenagers and much parodied in the media with phrases like "gag me with a spoon" and "barf me back to the stone age." Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Whoopie Goldberg in her one women show are two famous examples.  Southwestern (16)  By the time this area became part of the United States, there had already been as many as ten generations of Spanish speaking people living here, so the Mexican dialect of Spanish had an important influence on this area that became a melting pot for dialects from all over the USA. Some local words are: caballero, cantina, frijoles, madre, mesa, nana, padre, patio, plaza, ramada, tortilla.  Hawaii (not shown)  The original language of the Native Hawaiians is part of the Polynesian family. English speakers arrived in 1778, but many other settlers also came from China, Portugal, Japan, Korea, Spain, and the Philippines to influence the modern dialect. Hawaiian Creole developed from a pidgin English spoken on the sugar plantations with workers from Hawaii and many other countries. Some words are: look-see, no can, number one (the best), plenty (very). It isn't widely spoken anymore. Nonstandard Hawaiian English developed from Hawaiian Creole and is spoken mostly by teenagers. Standard Hawaiian English is part of the Western dialect family but shows less influence from the early New England dialect than any other American dialect. It has many words borowed from the original Hawaiian as well as some from the other Asian languages mentioned above: aloha, hula, kahuna, lei, luau, muumuu, poi, ukulele.    Click on the map for a larger version  General Southern (purple and red)  This dialect region matches the borders of the Confederate states that seceded during the "Confederate War" and is still a culturally distinct region of the United States. Since it was largely an agricultural area, people tended to move around less than they did in the north, and as a result, the subdialects are much less uniform than those of the General Northern regions and have much more clearly defined boundaries. Other languages that had an important influence on it are French (since the western region was originally French territory) and the African languages spoken by the people brought over as slaves. People tend to speak slower here than in the north creating the famous southern "drawl." I is pronounced AH, and OO is pronounced YOO, as in "Ah'm dyoo home at fahv o'clock." An OW in words like loud is pronounced with a slided double sound AOO (combining the vowel sounds in "hat" and "boot"). Some local words are: boogerman, funky (bad smelling), jump the broomstick (get married), kinfolks, mammy, muleheaded, overseer, tote, y'all.  South Midland (17)  This area, dominated by the Appalachian Mountains and the Ozark Mountains, was originally settled by the Pennsylvania Dutch moving south from the North Midland areas and the Scotch-Irish moving west from Virginia. A TH at the end of words or syllables is sometimes pronounced F, and the word ARE is often left out of sentences as they are in Black English. An A is usually placed at the beginning of verb that ends with ING, and the G is dropped; an O at the end of a word becomes ER. ("They a-celebratin' his birfday by a-goin' to see 'Old Yeller' in the theatah"). A T is frequently added to words that end with an S sound. Some words are: bodacious, heap, right smart (large amount), set a spell, and smidgin. American English has retained more elements of the Elizabethan English spoken in the time of Shakespeare than modern British English has, and this region has retained the most. Some Elizabethan words that are extinct in England are: bub, cross-purposes, fall (autumn), flapjack, greenhorn, guess (suppose), homely, homespun, jeans, loophole, molasses, peek, ragamuffin, reckon, sorry (inferior), trash, well (healthy).  Ozark (18)  Made famous by the Beverly Hillbillies, this isolated area was settled by people from the southern Appalachian region and developed a particularly colorful manner of speaking.  Southern Appalachian (19)  It is a popular myth that there are a few remote regions here that still speak an unchanged form of Elizabethan English, but it isn't true. Linguists are still studying the specific differences with South Midland.  Southern  As the northern dialects were originally dominated by Boston, the southern dialects were heavily influenced by Charleston, Richmond, and Savannah. They tend to drop Rs the way New Englanders do, but they don't add extra Rs. Some words are: big daddy (grandfather), big mamma (grandmother), Confederate War (Civil War), cooter (turtle), fixing to (going to), goober (peanut), hey (hello), mouth harp (harmonica), on account of (because).  Virginia Piedmont (20)  When an R comes after a vowel, it becomes UH, and AW becomes the slided sound, AH-AW. Thus, four dogs becomes fo-uh dahawgs. Some local words are: hoppergrass (grasshopper), old-field colt (illegitimate child), school breaks up (school lets out), weskit (vest).  Coastal Southern (21)  Very closely resembles Virginia Piedmont but has preserved more elements from the colonial era dialect than any other region of the United States outside Eastern New England. Some local words are: catty-corner (diagonal), dope (soda, Coca-Cola), fussbox (fussy person), kernal (pit), savannah (grassland), Sunday child (illegitimate child). They call doughnuts cookies.  Gullah (22)  Sometimes called Geechee, this creole language is spoken by some African Americans on the coastal areas and coastal islands of Georgia and South Carolina and was featured in the novel on which the musical, Porgy and Bess, was based. It combines English with several West African languages: Mende, Yoruba, Wolof, Kongo, Twi, Vai, Temne, Ibo, Ewe, Fula, Umbundu, Hausa, Bambara, Fante, and more. The name comes either from the Gola tribe in Liberia or the Ngola tribe in Angola. The grammar and pronunciation are too complicated to go into here, but some words are: bad mouth (curse), guba (peanut - from which we get the English word goober), gumbo (okra), juju (magic), juke (disorderly, wicked), peruse (to walk leisurely), samba (to dance), yam (sweet potato).  Gulf Southern (23)  This area was settled by English speakers moving west from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas, as well as French speaking settlers spreading out from Louisiana, especially the Acadians (see "Cajuns" below). Some words are: armoire (wardrobe), bayou (small stream), bisque (rich soup), civit cat (skunk), flitters (pancakes), gallery (porch), hydrant (faucet), neutral ground (median strip), pecan patty (praline).  Louisiana (24)  There's a lot going on down here. Many people in southern Louisiana will speak two or three of the dialects below. Cajun French (the Cajuns were originally French settlers in Acadia, Canada - now called Nova Scotia - who were kicked out when the British took over; in 1765, they arrived in New Orleans which was still French territory) carries the highest prestige of the French dialects here and has preserved a number of elements from the older French of the 1600s. It has also borrowed some words from the Spanish who once controlled this area. There are many local variations of it, but they would all be mutually understandable with each other as well as - with some effort - the standard French in France. Cajun English borrows vocabulary and grammar from French and gives us the famous pronunciations "un-YON" (onion) and "I ga-RON-tee" as well as the phrase "Let de good times role!", but movies about cajuns usually get the rest wrong. A famous authentic speaker is humorist Justin Wilson, who had a cooking show on PBS, with his catch phrase, "How y'all are? I'm glad for you to see me." New Orleans is pronounced with one syllable: "Nawlns." There is another dialect of English spoken in New Orleans that is informally, and some would say pejoratively, called Yat (from the greeting, "Where y'at"), that resembles the New York City (particularly Brooklyn) dialect (more info). Provincial French was the upper class dialect of the pre-Cajun French settlers and closely resembles Standard French but isn't widely spoken anymore since this group no longer exists as a separate social class. Louisiana French Creole blends French with the languages of the West Africans who were brought here as slaves. It is quite different from both the Louisiana and standard dialects of French but is very similar to the other creoles that developed between African and French on various Caribbean Islands. Married couples may speak Creole to each other, Cajun French with other people, and English to their children.

      h-dropping  h-dropping occurs initially in words like hit, hammer, happy, hedge (examples in this section are from Wells p.253 ff.). It can also (though less frequently) occur mediall in words such as Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Tatham.  In most accents of English underlying /h/ is realised phonetically as [h]. The underlying /h/ often contrasts with zero to produce morpheme alternation. Thus we find hall vs. all and heat vs. eat.  Note: [h] is a  voiceless glottal fricative - or, in other words, vowel without vocal cord vibration and with added frication. In most cases [h] is a voiceless frication-rich version of the immediately following vowel.  In some accents of English underlying /h/ is often realised as zero, or sometimes as a glottal stop. Wells (p.253) refers to this happening in 'most of the working-class accents' (p.253). He sets out two models:   there is an underlying /h/ (our model) which is deleted,   there is no underlying /h/.   For us, hall and all are phonologically distinct (hall has the underlying /h/, but all does not), whereas in the alternative model there is no underlying /h/ for hall - thus making it identical at all levels with all.  Word initial h-dropping occurs in RP (Received Pronunciation) and CE (Cockney English), though not in SE (Standard English) or EE (Estuary English) [the four accents this course concentrates on]. Most accents of English will regularly zero word medial  /h/ in examples such as Nottingham, though this is usually not obligatory.  Hypercorrection can often occur (when trying to 'talk posh'). Here a word with an underlying stressed vowel may well have a [h] 'mistakenly' inserted.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [ i ] becomes [ I ]  In almost all accents of English [ i ] has replaced [ I ] in final position in words such as happy or coffee. Another way of saying this is that in word-final position the vowel is realised phonetically as  more tense than it used to be. This has been a gradual shift since the Second World War (at least) and has been noted in particular in accents of North America and Britain.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  l-vocalisation  In English there is a single underlying /L/. That is, at the underlying level of the phonology (or at a phonemic level) there is only a single l-category entry. A phonological rule (note: not a phonetic one) substitutes a palatal /l/ (or clear /l/) before a vowel and a velar /l/ (or dark /l/) before a consonant or in word-final position. Phonetically these go on to be realised as phonetic clear or dark [l].  The process of l-vocalisation means that dark /l/ becomes phonetically a non-syllabic vowel rather like the one in SE book. In some speakers the process is so strong that, when heavily stressed, the vowel may take on the characteristics of a syllabic vowel (i.e. the nucleus of a separate syllable). In these cases a word like wall can become bi-syllabic for some speakers (especially CE speakers).  EE, SE and RP are all seeing the introduction of the trend toward l-vocalisation - with the degree of penetration greatest in EE and least in RP. Wells compares this trend with the earlier r-dropping in words like car or better (p.259) in terms of its impact on the pronunciation of the language.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  glottalisation  The voiceless plosives [p, t, k] are often preceded in some accents by a glottal stop. The phenomenon is referred to as 'pre-glottalisation' or 'glottal reinforcement', and according to Wells seems to be a 20th century phenomenon. The effect occurs  when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] come in syllable final position   when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] are preceded by a vowel, a liquid or a nasal.  [A list of example environments can be found in Wells, p.260.]  Although some speakers of RP, SE and EE sometimes use glottal reinforcement it is commonest in the north, around Newcastle. It seems to be a regional phenomenon, and accents of London (CE), Glasgow and Edinburgh as well, according to Wells, many rural accents of southern England (e.g. East Anglian accents) is gaining ground, particularly in reinforcing [t].  But it is important to distinguish between glottal reinforcement and glottal substitution. In some accents, particularly CE, glottal substitution takes place. Here there is a complete replacement of [p, t] with a glottal stop - with no residual of the oral stop articulation. The replacement of [t] is more likely than [p], and occurs only infrequently with [k]. Some researchers report glottal substitution in northern accents around Leeds and Manchester.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -ing variation  -ing variation refers to a surface variation quite commonly observed between [n] and [ng] in final position in words such as running, making.   [Note: [ng] is used here for the velar nasal to substitute for the usual IPA symbol which may not be available in some web browsers.]  It is also possible for the entire syllable to be reduced (when unstressed) to a syllabic [n] - the 'true' vowel disappearing altogether. As Wells points out (p.262) this can result in some pairs of otherwise phonetically distinct words becoming homophonous, e.g. eating and eaten. According to Wells  At the present day it seems that almost every English-speaking community exhibits a social or stylistic alternation between the two possibilities, the form with the velar nasal being 'high' and that with the alveolar being 'low'. But there is evidently geographical variation in respect of the point in social or stylistic stratification at which the changeover occurs. In Birmingham, England, it appears that the velar form extends well down into working-class speech, while in Birmingham, Alabama, the alveolar form extends well up into middle-class or educated speech. (p.262-263)  Note that as with h-dropping hypercorrection occurs with this phenomenon. It is not uncommon to hear the words chicken or garden pronounced with the velar nasal. This is often associated with CE in the minds of many English speakers  - partly because CE is automatically associated with working-class speech. Hypercorrection never occurs in RP, and seems to occur only rarely in SE or EE.

      Australian English is a very distinctive accent from American and British English. A general view in terms of linguistics and prosody is presented here by comparing with American and British.      Australia was first colonized by the English less than two centuries ago, Hence, it is without surprise that the Australia English accent is very much more similar to the accents of current England than those of Americans. If considering the enormous size of the territory over which it spoken, their accents are practically indistinguishable and tend to be a matter of urban versus rural.      Observations of Australian English vowels have given us detailed insight into variations that occur within the dialect and how Australian English (AusE) differs from British and American. The major characteristics of Australian are summarized as following.      The front vowels in Australian, as in the words / /, /e/, and /æ/ are all raised relative to the same vowels in British. This means that the vowel in the word / / is rather closer to the /i:/ vowel than in British. The vowel /e/ is closer to the / / vowel than in British and the vowel in the word /æ/ is closer to the /e/ vowel than in British. The vowels in the words /6:/ and /6/, which are back vowels in British, are more fronted in Australian and therefore closer to the /æ/ vowel. The high /U:/ and /U/ vowels are very similar to one another in British but these two are quite distinct in AusE. In section 3 we discuss these in more details.  The centering diphthongs / ə/ and /e:/ occurring in Australianare often pronounced with negligible offglide such that the production is rather like prolonged monophthongal realization  / / and /e/ vowels e.g. weary /w əri:/ /w :əi/.  The glides in the /æc/ and / U/ vowels have different orientations in British relative to Australian. The rising diphthongs such as /æI/, /ae/, /ɔI/, /æc/, and /əU/ occur. /əU/, /ae/, /ɔI/ vowels have undergone a process of shift such that in Australian /æI/ is similar to British /ae/. In some instances, these differences may lead to misunderstanding such as the unfortunate woman who believed she was being sent home from the hospital ‘to die’ after being informed that she was ‘going home today’  Australian English prefers the word-internal /ə/ and the word-final /i:/ to the unstressed / /, e.g. that sounds for an Englishman as if it were thet.  The Australian tend to merge all the unstressed vowels in /ə/ where British use / / and the ending – y, e.g., July /ʤəlai/,  Geelong, /ʤəlaŋ/. / / is produced as / / in most positions, in words like dance even /æ/.Like in the American South /æƱ/ occurs in words like pound (Bähr, 1974: 276.).  As for the consonants, there are no glottal stops (in spite of all the similarities of British to Cockney). Some Australians, maybe due to Irish influx, produce rhotic words     Mitchel & Delbridge (1965) distinguish three main types of Australian pronunciation: Broad, General, and Cultivated.      In the view of phonetic realization, the difference is minor when comparing British and Cultivated Australia English (CAusE) but considerable when we compare it with General English (GAusE) or Broad Australian English (BAusE).  The vowel system of BAusE is very similar to Cockney, the accent of working class in London while the counterpart of CAusE is close to that of British.  CAusE differs from GAusE and BAusE in terms of Diphthong Shifting, which is similar to that found in the southeast of England. BAusE is close to GAusE but with extra duration in the first element of the diphthongs. The mainly rural broad type has noticeably slow diphthongs.  Characteristics of BAusE constitute majority of "the Australian accent" which is most readily identified by the following six sounds (Table 3).  British         à     AusE (IPA)  Example            /ei/          à             /æi/  Day             à              die            /əu/         à             /ΛU/  Row            à           raow            /i:/           à             /iə/  Me              à           mere            /u:/          à             /əu/  Boot            à            boat            /au/         à             /æu/  Cow            à           caew            /ai/          à             /ɔi /  Nine            à             noy

      For those unfamiliar with them, a weather balloon looks like a balloon with a sheet of tin foil hanging from it. In 1947, any soldier would have no problem identifying one, especially in Roswell, NM. There, they were launched everyday by the army. One July, a high ranking army official investigated the site of one that had crashed and somehow had mistaken it for a weather balloon. --Of course, the rest is history. Why such a fuss over a weather balloon? Let's suppose for a moment that the army was testing a top secret weapon in the New Mexico desert and it crashed in the desert. That would explain the obvious cover-up. But surely anything that was top secret in 1947 would be obsolete technology today. It is policy to release government documents and files concerning such secret weapons of the past.  Then why hasn't the government come clean?  The Roswell Incident was the first step in a process of desensitization. Over the years, the world has been gradually desensitized to the idea of an alien presence through abductions, sightings, crop circles, etc. But still, many refuse to accept the reality. There are others who neither deny nor accept. They ask simply "Why?"  No, Virginia, Santa is a Big Fat Fake.   Scenario: It is a turbulent time in history. Fear of nuclear war has gripped the nation and at the same time a secret government agency is operating under it's own authority. These select few are the ones that have been chosen to "deal" with matter concerning an alien presence, whom they are in constant contact with, and to keep it a secret from the rest of the world until they determine when not to. The President at the time is a man who feels this is information the world deserves to know. He plans to tell the public of this. The secret government cannot have this. The President is assassinated.  It all happened. Almost everyone knows about it but few know the whole story. It is referred to as the Kennedy Assassination. It would have remained a mystery if it weren't for the work of Bill Cooper. Mr. Cooper worked for the military and had Top Secret MAJC security clearance (higher than Top Secret). He felt this was information people needed to know. It felt he was risking his life by talking about it. Today, he lectures on the subject of JFK and the government's involvement with alien intelligence.  So why did they have to kill Kennedy? To come on television one night and say, "Good evening, this is your President. I'm here tonight to tell you that we are not alone in the universe. Aliens form outer space are among us. Goodnight and God bless America" would have caused mass hysteria and collapse of social institutions. This was not in the best interest of the public, according to MJ-12. An equivalent bombshell would be telling a child, "Santa is dead, the immaculate conception was actually performed by aliens, and don't put money on the Easter Bunny being real, either."  Little Grey Men and a Cosmic Toilet Bowl  Ancient Chinese Curse - "May you live in interesting times." Boy, those ancient Chinese dudes were right about EVERYTHING! The twentieth century is by far the most interesting time period in all of history...and it's not over yet. In man's past, the coming of a new millennia has often caused great anxiety, and for good reason. But what happened in the past is of little importance when compared to what is about to happen in the next few years. The Earth and humanity is about to undergo a transformation. This will be both a physical and spiritual change brought about by a pole shift. Every 4,000 years, the Earth's rotation stops, the continents are shooken up, and the poles change location. This is caused by a 12th planet in our solar system on a ~4,000 year elliptical orbit around the sun. The planet is huge and is pulling with great force on the Earth as you read this, causing the great increase in earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. by heating the Earth's core. This may sound extremely farfetched to some. But the proof is out there, it only need be heard. Take for instance the puzzling crop circles (and sand circles, snow circles, and ice circles). Perfect geometric patterns in fields of wheat - hundreds of meters longs with wheat woven, not broken. What is more extraordinary is that there are magnetic differences in the regions where these circles are formed. And even more, a few inches beneath the ground, the earth is scorched.  The term "circle" isn't even accurate any more. For having started out as circles, the designs have now evolved into complex geometric patterns. Such designs would take a team of men a whole day to construct one. But in the dark of night? Without a sound? Without footprints? Without breaking a single shaft? But how would they fake identical patterns in snow without leaving footprints? Or on frozen lakes with ice less than an inch thick?  These are the questions that crop circles are meant to raise. Furthermore, they speak to our subconscious. In a recent circle, the solar system is depicted, with the Earth's orbit missing. There is so much that I could explain here, but I'd best leave that to the expert, Nancy. If you haven't already, visit her web page zetatalk and read more about it. But what is essential to know is that this impending catastrophe is part of the Earth's "plan". For in times of natural disasters, people are at their best. They do as much as possible to help others, thinking of others first and themselves last. Right now, humankind is at a crossroads. The problems of overpopulation, AIDS, pollution, etc. are out of the hands of man. There is little that can be done to solve these problems of the modern world. But soon, humanity will be "born again" into a new Earth, a new spiritual density - flushing the cosmic toilet, so to speak. This is part of the evolution of humankind. That is why the Zetas are here. They are helping us prepare for what is coming.  It would be easy to dismiss this as nonsense and go about our lives, laughing at such an idea. It would be convenient to say that the people saying these things and the people who claim to be abducted by aliens are crazy, looney. And that is what so many people have been doing. The first stage is denial. If one were to look at all the facts, it would be clear that what has been said is true. And when one does that, they become scared. Right now there's a whole generation of scared young people who see no hope for their future. What they do not know is that they will either perish in the pole shift or survive and live in the Aftertime - the new Earth. For those people who have had to deal with this issue of the pole shift, particularly the contactees, a common part of the process is depression. Anyone who has suffered from this "pre-distressed" state will tell you that they wish that - with all their hearts - all that they believed about the future was not true. They wish there was something out there to convince them "that everything was going to be OK". But that is not the case. If they find a way to deal with their depression (with therapy, antidepressants, etc) they come to the final stage - acceptance. They accept their future with an attitude that they can and will survive.  This is exactly what this page is about. And it's more than just a web page. Web pages are an excellent method of communication, as is the Internet as a whole. Aftertime Generation is a community of concerned, intelligent individuals. We are not wackos. No one should feel that they are crazy for believing in something they see to be true. You have two choices: you can either not believe it or believe it. For those that do believe, understand that you are not alone. There are thousands of people from all walks of life that have the same beliefs as yourself. For those who think that Aftertime Generation is a bunch of bullshit, I respect your opinions and your beliefs. And I appreciate you respecting mine. After all, you wouldn't harass or criticize someone who believed in God would you? I know I wouldn't. I understand what it means to believe in something without any substantial evidence. Many of my own beliefs are like that, it's just that I have evidence backing up one of them. Aftertime Generation is a web page specifically for young adults. It is here for the sole purpose of communicating a supportive atmosphere and creating a community of like-minded people through the bandwidth.  -M.G. aka Pioneer

      Start your day with a smile!     the son of a bitch    Little Johnny was heard by his mother reciting his homework: "Two plus two, the son of a bitch is four; four plus four, the son of a bitch is eight; eight plus eight, the son of a bitch...'"     "Johnny !" shouted his mother. "Watch your language! You're not allowed to use the swearwords."     "But, Mom," replied the boy, "that's what the teacher taught us, and she said to recite it out loud till we learned it."     Next day Johnny's mother went right into the classroom to complain. "Oh, heavens !" said the teacher. "That's not what I taught them. They're supposed to say, 'Two plus two, the sum of which is four.' " http://www.butlerwebs.com/jokes/littlejohnny.htm

      There are four main points where liaisons happen:   Consonant & Vowel   Consonant &  Consonant   Vowel & Vowel   T, D, S, or Z & the Y sound  In American English, words are not pronounced one by one. Usually, the end of one word attaches to the beginning of the next word. This is also true for initials, numbers, and spelling. Part of the glue that connects sentences is an underlying hum or drone that only breaks when you come to a period, and sometimes not even then. You have this underlying hum in your own language and it helps a great deal toward making you sound like a native speaker.   Once you have a strong intonation, you need to connect all those stairsteps together so that each sentence sounds like one long word.    The dime. The dime easier. They tell me the dime easier. They tell me the dime easier to understand. They tell me that I'm easier to understand.   The last two sentences above should be pronounced exactly the same, no matter how they are written. It is the sound that is important, not the spelling.      Consonant & Vowel  Words are connected when a words ends in a consonant sound and the next word starts with a vowel sound, including the semivowels W, Y and R. (You can check out the individual sounds as well: Pronunciation).  Spelling Pronunciation  My name is Ann. [my nay mi zæn]  American accent [amer'k' næksent]   You also use liaisons in spelling and numbers.   Spelling Pronunciation  LA [eh lay]  909-5068 [näi nou näin, fäi vo sick sate]     Consonant & Consonant    Words are connected when a word ends in a consonant sound and the next word starts with a consonant that is in a similar position.    Lips Behind Teeth Throat  Unvoiced P, F T, Ch, S, Sh K, H  Voiced B, V D, J, Z, Zh G, Ng, R    For example, if a word ends with a letter from the Behind Teeth category and the next word starts with a letter from that same category, these words are going to naturally join together. This is the same for Lips and Throat.  Spelling Pronunciation  I just didn't get the chance [I jussdidn't ge(t)the chance]  I've been late twice. [äivbin la(t)twice]      Vowel & Vowel   When a word ending in a vowel sound is next to one beginning with a vowel sound, they are connected with a glide between the two vowels.  Spelling Pronunciation  Go away. [go(w)away]  I also need the other one. [äi(y)älso need the(y)other one]    A glide is either a slight [y] sound or a slight [w] sound. How do you know which one to use? This will take care of itself--the position your lips are in will dictate either [y] or [w].  For example, if a word ends in [o], your lips are going to be in the forward position, so a [w] quite naturally leads into the next vowel sound: [Go(w)away].    After a long [e] sound, you lips will be pulled back far enough to create a [y] glide or liaison: [I(y)also need the(y)other one]. Don't force this sound too much, though. It's not a strong pushing sound.     T, D, S or Z + Y  When the letter or sound of T, D, S or Z is followed by a word that starts with Y, or its sound, both sounds are connected. These letters and sounds connect not only with Y, but they do so as well with the initial unwritten [y] sound of syllables and words. They form a combination that changes the pronunciation.    T + Y = CH Spelling Pronunciation  What's your name? [Whacher name?]  Can't you do it? [Canchoo do it?]  Don't you like it? [Donchoo like it?]  actually [achully]   D + Y = J  Spelling Pronunciation  What did you do? [Whajoo do?]  Would you help me? [Wüjoo help me?]  Did you like it? [Didja like it?]  graduation [graju(w)ation]   S + Y = SH  Spelling Pronunciation  insurance [inshurance]  sugar [shüg'r]   Z + Y = ZH Spelling Pronunciation  How's your family? [howzher family?]  Who's your friend? [hoozhier friend?]  casual [kazhyoow'l]  usual [yuzhoow'l]

      Once you have thoroughly studied intonation and word connections, you can begin to address pronunciation.  The three most important sounds are [æ], [ä], and [uh], also called the schwa.  æ  Let's start with the [æ] sound. Although it's not a common sound, [æ] is very distinctive to the ear, and is typically American. In the practice paragraph vowel chart, this sound occurs 5 times. As its phonetic symbol indicates, [æ] is a combination of [ä] + [e]. To pronounce it, drop your jaw down as if you were going to say [ä]; then from that position, try to say eh. The final sound is not two separate vowels, but rather the end result of the combination. It is very close to the sound that a goat makes: ma-a-a-ah!   If you find yourself getting too nasal with [æ], pinch your nose as you say it. Go to the practice paragraph and find the 5 [æ] sounds, including [æu] as in down or out.   ä  The [ä] sound is a more common sound than [æ]; you will find 10 such sounds in the practice paragraph. To pronounce [ä], relax your tongue and drop your jaw as far down as it will go. As a matter of fact, put your hand under your chin and say [mä], [pä], [tä], [sä]. Your hand should be pushed down by your jaw as it opens. Remember, it's the sound that you make when the doctor wants to see your throat.   uh Last is the schwa, the most common sound in American English. When you work on the practice paragraph, depending on how fast you speak, how smoothly you make liaisons, how strong your intonation is, how much you relax your sounds, you will find from 50 to 75 schwas. Spelling doesn't help identify it, because it can appear as any one of the vowels, or a combination of them. It is a neutral vowel sound, uh. It is usually in an unstressed syllable, though it can be stressed as well.   Whenever you find a vowel that can be crossed out and its absence wouldn't change the pronunciation of the word, you have probably found a schwa: photography [f'tägr'fee] (the two apostrophes show the location of the neutral vowel sounds).   Because it is so common, however, the wrong pronunciation of this one little sound can leave your speech strongly accented, even if you Americanize everything else.   Remember, some dictionaries use two different written characters, the upside down e & [^] for the neutral uh sound, but for simplicity, we are only going to use the first one.  Silent or Neutral?  A schwa is neutral, but it is not silent. By comparison, the silent E at the end of a word is a signal for pronunciation, but it is not pronounced itself: code is [kod]. The E tells you to say an [o]. If you leave the E off, you have cod, [käd]. The schwa, on the other hand, is neutral, but it is an actual sound, uh. For example, you could also write photography as phuh-tah-gruh-fee.   The schwa is a neutral sound, (no distinctive characteristics), but it is the most common sound in the English language. To make the uh sound, put your hand on your diaphragm and push until a grunt escapes. Don't move your jaw, tongue or lips, just allow the sound to flow past your vocal cords. It should sound like uh, not ah.   Once you master the two sounds [æ] and uh, you will have an easier time pronouncing 'can' and 'can't'. In a sentence, the simple positive 'can' sound like [k'n]. The simple negative 'can't' sounds like [kæn(t)].   Intention Spelling Pronunciation  Positive I can do it. [I k'n do it.  Negative I can't do it. I kæn(t) do it.  Extra Positive I can do it. I kææn do it.  Extra Negative I can't do it. I kænt do it.   Vowel Chart  In the vowel chart that follows, the four corners represent the four most extreme positions of the mouth. The center box represents the least extreme position -- the neutral schwa. For these four positions, only move your lips and jaw. Your tongue should stay in the same place -- with the tip resting behind the bottom teeth.

The American T  The American T is influenced very strongly by intonation and its position in a word or phrase. It can be a little tricky if you try to base your pronunciation on spelling alone.   There are, however, 4 basic rules: [T is T], [T is D], [T is Silent], [T is Held].  1 Top of the Staircase [T is T] If the T is at the beginning of a word (or the top of the staircase), it is a strong, clear T sound.  In the beginning of a word: table, take, tomorrow, teach, ten, turn Thomas tried two times. With a stressed T and ST, TS, TR, CT, LT and sometimes NT combinations: They control the contents. In the past tense, D sounds like T, after an unvoiced consonant sound — f, k, p, s, ch, sh, th (but not T). picked [pikt], hoped [houpt], raced [rast], watched [wächt], washed [wäsht] It took Tim ten times to try the telephone. 2 Middle of the Staircase [T is D]  If the T is in the middle of the word, intonation changes the sound to a soft D. Letter sounds like [ledder].  Water, daughter, bought a, caught a, lot of, got a, later, meeting, better   Practice these sentences:  What a good idea. [w'd' güdäi deey']  Put it in a bottle. [pü di di n' bäd'l]  Get a better water heater. [gedda bedder wäder heeder]  Put all the data in the computer. [püdall the dayd' in the k'mpyuder]  Patty ought to write a better letter. [pædy äd' ride a bedder ledder]    3 [T is Silent] T and N are so close in the mouth that the [t] can disappear.  interview [innerview] international [innernational] advantage [ædvæn'j] percentage [percen'j] If the T is at the end of a word, you almost don't hear it at all.  put, what, lot, set, hot, sit, shot, brought. That's quite right, isn't it? 4 Bottom of the Staircase [T is Held] With -tain, -tten and some TN combinations, the T is held. The "held T" is, strictly speaking, not really a T at all. Remember, [t] and [n] are very close in the mouth. If you have [n] immediately after [t], you don't pop the [t]—the tongue is in the [t] position, but your release the air for the [n] not the [t]. Make sure you don't put a schwa before the [n]. An important point to remember is that you need a sharp upward sliding intonation up to the "held T," then a quick drop for the N.  Written, certain, forgotten, sentence:  He's forgotten the carton of satin mittens. She's certain that he has written it. Martin has gotten a kitten.  The American R  The American R is like a vowel because it does not touch anywhere in the mouth. In Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, Greek and many other languages, the R is a consonant because it touches behind the teeth. The American R is produced deep in the throat. Like the French R and the German R, the American R is in the throat, but unlike those two consonant sounds, it doesn't touch. Let's contrast two similar sounds: [ä] and [r]. Hold your hand out in front of you, with your palm up, like you are holding a tray on it. Slightly drop your hand down, and say ah, like you want the doctor to see your throat. Now, curl your fingers up slightly, and say [r]. Your tongue should feel in about the same position as your hand.     The American L  The American L has two different pronunciations in English (of course, otherwise it would be too easy!). In the beginning or middle of a word, the tongue tip touches just behind the teeth — on those hard ridges. In this position, the L shouldn't give you much trouble. The difficulty begins when the L is at the end of a word. Because the letter L has a shorter, sharper pronunciation in other languages, this will carry over into English, where the whole word will just sound too short. At the end of a word, the L is especially noticeable if it is either missing (Chinese) or too short (Spanish). You need to put a little schwa sound before the final L. If you want to say the word ball, [bäl], it will sound too short if you don't say [bä-uhl]. You may even need to add a tiny schwa at the end to finish off the L, [bä-uh-luh].   One way to avoid the pronunciation difficulty of a final L, such as in call, is to make a liaison when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, if you want to say I have to call on my friend, let the liaison do your work for you; say, [I have to kä-län my friend].    Tee Aitch  The most common word in the English language is THE, so after the schwa, [th] would be the sound you would hear most often, which is why it is so important to master it. ([th] also exists in English, Greek and Castillian Spanish.) Besides 'the,' there are several other very common words that start with a voiced [th]:  this that these those they them their there then Just as with most of the other consonants, there are two types— voiced and unvoiced. The voiced TH is like a D, but instead of being in back of the teeth, it's 1/4 inch lower and forward, between the teeth. The unvoiced TH is like an S between the teeth. Most people tend to replace the unvoiced TH with S or T and the voiced one with Z or D. Instead of thing, they say sing, or ting. Instead of that, they say zat or dat.   To pronounce TH correctly, think of a snake's tongue. You don't want to take a big relaxed tongue and push it far between your teeth and just leave it out there. Make only a very quick, sharp little movement. Keep the tip of your tongue very tense. It darts out between your teeth and snaps back very quickly.   I and E  These two sounds probably give you a lot of trouble. One reason for this is that most languages don't make a distinction here. Another reason is that there are four ways of saying these two sounds, depending what the final consonant is.   This another place where intonation and pronunciation overlap. When you say the long [e], it is a tense vowel sound. You slightly draw your lips back and raise the back of your tongue. When you say the short [i], it is a lax vowel sound. Don't move your lips AT ALL and open your throat.   If the final consonant is unvoiced (whispered), [t, k, f, p, s, sh, ch], then the middle vowel sound is quick and sharp: [bit] or [beet] If the final consonant is voiced (spoken), [d, g, v, b, z, zh, j] or any vowel, then the middle vowel sound is doubled: [bi-id] or [bee-eed].    single double  tense beat bead  lax bit bid

      One of the best ways to sound like a foreigner to an American is to fully pronounce everything the way it's written (the formal, textbook pronunciations).  However, learning this list of contractions used in daily speech is an extremely good way to sound like a veteran (person with experience) in English, and is helpful when trying to understand other people.  When trying to blend in, it is absolutely indispensable.  If you have trouble remembering the things on this list, don't worry about it.  These are just general ideas.  They are speech patterns that people often use when speaking and you will hear them all the time.  No one will ever think that you're speaking incorrectly even if you don't read what I have here, but you will speak and understand better if you do read it.   Go to the Spoken American English forum (discussion area). Ask questions and have them answered by other people on the forum.           (The ^ sound is the "schwa" vowel as in given = giv^n.)          (The | sound is the "glottal stop ".  See note at bottom of page.)          (The ~n sound is what I call a "nasal stop".  I have not heard any other name for this sound.  See note at bottom of                page)             ****Click on any of the links below in order to play the sound file****        Sound  (Standard sound) Pronunciation  (Standard sound is replaced with this) Example  with Sound Sample Comments  1.  -t-  -d-  later = lad^r   better =  bedd^r   smarter =  smard^r   at a time = add^ time   a tomato = ^t^mado   mandatory =  mand^tory   the way to go =  th^ way d^ go Extremely common.  This is always used in the US except in very formal speaking, but never noted in written text.  Used when a "t" is between vowels and the "t" begins an unaccented syllable.  (vowel + r  is considered a vowel here).  Generally not used when a "t" begins a word or starts a (heavily or lightly) accented syllable.  An exception to this is the word "to".  2.  -ing   -^n I'm walking all the way back tonight. =   I'm walk^n all th^ way back t^nigh|. (see Rule 5) This is actually more casual, but still extremely common.  It is often not noted in writing, but if it is, it is spelled "-in'".  This is usually only used in verbs that end in "-ing".  It can also be found in words like "nothing" and "something", but not "everything" or "anything."  3.  -t^n, -nt  -|n, -n|  mountain = moun|^n   forgotten = f^rgo|^n   can't =can|   (different from "can")   paint = pain|   waiting = wait|n (See Rule 2) Extremely common.  This is always used in the US except when speaking formally or clearly.  Americans do this without even being aware of it, but to avoid this "glottal stop" sounds very stilted.  Used at ends of words.  4.  -nt-  -n-  twenty = twenny   center = cenn^r   printer = prinn^r   into = into   onto = onto This is used when "nt" is between vowels and the second vowel is unstressed.  It is always used except when speaking clearly.  The "t"-sound is actually pronounced very lightly, almost inaudibly (cannot be heard).  Not used for "into" nor "onto".  5.  -t  -| or -|t  sweet = swee|   late =lay|   lights = ligh|ts   output = ou|pu|   forget it = f^rgedd ^|          (See Rule 1)   recited =r^cid^d Extremely common and always used except when trying to speak clearly.  Never written.  Often the "t" may be also pronounced or lightly pronounced.  Not used before a vowel.  (See Rule 1:  "-t-" )  6.  -k  -|k  break = brea|k   strike = stri|ke   works = w^r|ks   break it = break ^t   awaken = ^wak^n Extremely common and often used except when speaking very clearly.  Never written.  The glottal stop is spoken right with the "k" with the "k" pronounced lightly.  This causes the works "light" and "like" to sound very similar in the US.  Generally only at the end of a word and never before a vowel.  7.  -b, -d,    -g, -p  -|b, -|d,   -|g, -|p  lab =la|b   red = re|d   bag = ba|g   wipe = wi|pe This is always done in American speech except when speaking clearly or emphatically.  The final consonant is pronounced lightly after a glottal stop.  The mouth ends in that position without pronouncing the consonant fully.  8.  -d^n    golden = gol~n   wouldn't = woul~n|   shouldn't = shoul~n|   reading = rea~n   ( I'm rea~n a book.)               (See Rule 2)  Note that combining Rule 8 with Rule 2 is used in more casual speech. This is the "nasal stop" described below.  It is always used except when speaking clearly.  If this sound is difficult, don't worry about it, but you will hear it used.   9.  them  ^m I heard ^m yesterday. Used in more casual speech but extremely common.  Either written " 'em" or "them".  Can be confused with "^m" (him).  (See Rule 10)  10.  him, her   his, he  ^m, ^r, ^z, ee I gave ^m the message.  I have ^r books.  I have ^z books.  Maybe ee forgot.  Her books. Extremely common but rarely written.  Never used at the beginning of a sentence or phrase.  11.  "of"  ^ or ^v  a bunch of stuff =  ^ bunch^ stuff.  ^ bunch ^v stuff More casual but extremely common.  Either written "o' " or "of".  12.  "and'  ^n fish ^n chips  I came ^n I left. More casual but extremely common.  Either written " 'n" or "and".  13.  "you",   "you'd"  y^, y^d How are y^?  I saw y^ the other day.  Y^d haft^ [have to] be crazy. This is rather casual but very common.  It is written "ya", "ya' ", or "you".  14.  -t + "you",    -t + "your"  -tchew or -tch^,   -tch^r  I got you a magazine. =   I gotchew a magazine. or  I gotch^ a magazine.  Get your book off the table = Getch^r book off the table. This is commonly heard in all levels (classes) of speech, but not all of the time.  Also see Rules 5 and 13 above.   15.  -d + "you",   -d + "your"  -djew or -dj^,   -dj^r  I made you a sandwich. =   I madejew a sandwich. or   I madej^ a sandwich.  I read your book. =   I redj^r book. This is commonly heard in all levels (classes) of speech, but not all of the time.  Also see Rules 7 and 13 above.  16.  "going to"  gunn^ or g^n^ I'm g^n^ leave.  He's g^n^ stay.   I'm going to the movies. =  I'm goin' to the movies. This is more casual but extremely common.  Usually written "gonna" or sometimes "going to."  Only used if "going to" + verb.  17.  "want to"  wann^ I wann^ leave.  They wann^ stay. This is more casual but extremely common.  Usually written "want to" or sometimes "wanna."  18.  "because"  "kuz" or "k^z"  "because it's important" =   "kuz it's impor|^n|"   "k^z it's impor|^n|"          (See Rules 3 and 5) This is used in more casual speech, but is very commonly heard.  19.  Omitting  pronouns  "You want to see a movie?" =  "Wann^ see a movie?"   "I hope you do well." =   "Hope you do well." This is done when the pronoun is already implied.  Only use this after gaining some experience in English.  20. The word "you" is often used used not to specifically mean "you" but to mean "someone",  "everyone", or "anyone" in a general sense.  "It is not necessary to be a genius to figure that out." = "You don't have to be a genius to figure that out."  "No one ever knows what can happen." = "You never know what can happen."  "Someone can find whatever he/she wants in New York."  You can find whatever you want in New York." This is used when the the word "you" is unstressed.  This is used in all types of conversations and often in writing.  However, it is discouraged in formal writing.  Rule 13 may also be used.   There are a lot of monosyllabic (one syllable) words whose vowels simply become "schwas" when they are not emphasized and used in more casual speech.  They include:    when, as, it, well, then, let's, at, to, in, if. . . .   The "glottal stop", represented here with a "|", is like a rapid stop in the throat, like rapidly turning your voice off and back on again.  It is similar to the hamza sound in Arabic represented with a " ' " as in mi'a (one hundred.)  It's also the sound you hear if you've ever heard an American say "uh-oh" or "uh-uh".   The "nasal stop" is something that is very rare in languages of the world.  I do not know of any language besides English that has this sound in it.  It is like the glottal stop, but this time the stop is in the nose.  Try to pronounce the "d" sound or the "g" sound completely inside the nose. Here is the sound pronounced slowly.   Also, check out (examine) this website here: Language Miniature No. 71.  This article is called "How we think we talk and how we really talk," and it provides a lot of information and observations about the spoken American language--similar to this website.  Highly recommended.  But note: even though the main title of the artice is "Jeet Jet?", it would be extremely unrealistic that anyone would ever say "Jeet jet?" instead of "Did you eat yet?".  On the other hand, using the rules on this website above (Numbers 5 and 15), it would be very realistic for someone to say, "Didj^ ee| ye|?"   Another great website I just discovered can be found here: Relaxed Pronunciation.  It has much of the information that this website has and a few other details about pronunciation.

      Once upon a time, in a land far, far away there was a little Anglo-Saxon boy named Beowulf. As he was walking down the stoney path, he encountered himself a young Jute girl named Olga. It was love at first sight. There was one minor problem, their love could not flower for they spoke not the same language. Fortunately, both their languages came from the Germanic line, so there were some similarities.  Beowulf said, "Oi luf u, u luf e?"  Olga responded, "Ya, I rove yo."  As they participated in a quadlabial fricative it assimilated their sounds into, "I love you." And so the English language was born. Along with their son Sven.

      On a rainy London night, the crowds are leaving the opera at Covent Garden. Freddy Eynsford-Hill runs into flower girl Eliza Doolittle, spilling her flowers onto the muddy ground. While she is dressing him down for his clumsiness, phonetics expert Professor Henry Higgins, takes notes regarding her thick, cockney accent. Higgins attracts the attention of another linguist, Colonel Pickering. Since each has been seeking an opportunity to meet the other, it is agreed that Pickering will come to stay with Higgins.  Eliza, having saved a bit of money, comes to Higgins’s home in hopes of engaging his services for speaking lessons. Her accent is so dreadful that Higgins sees a challenge and accepts a wager with Pickering that he can teach her sufficiently to pass her off as royalty. Higgins takes Eliza into his home and the arduous refinement begins.  Alfred Doolittle learns of his daughter’s good fortune and shows up at the Higgins residence. He is not an outraged father demanding that his daughter be brought to him, he wants only compensation of a five-pound note, no more, no less. Higgins is amused at his moral reasoning and pays him off.  Higgins grills Eliza mercilessly. Finally, progress can be seen and Higgins decides to give her a brief “trial run” at the Ascot races.   The now-beautiful Eliza immediately wins Freddy’s heart and does quite nicely with her slow, measured speech. That is, until the races begin. The more excited she gets, the more she slips back into her cockney argot and finally shocks several of the ladies into a graceful faint with some encouragement shouted at her horse: “Move yer arse!”  Six weeks later, despite the setback, Higgins decides that Eliza is ready for the Embassy Ball. Eliza charms everyone quite completely, including the queen and the nefarious linguist, Zoltan Karpathy. After the ball, Higgins and Pickering congratulate each other profusely, but not a word of compliment is spent on the heartbroken Eliza, who confronts Higgins about his lack of caring. He dismisses her with his usual coldness.  Upon leaving, Eliza finds Freddy seated on the front steps of Higgins’s house, and he professes his love for her. She tells him in no uncertain terms how tired she is of words. “If you’re in love,” she sings, “show me!”   Eliza returns to her familiar Covent Garden. There, she finds her father being treated as royalty by pub proprietor and friends alike. Higgins’s recommendation of Doolittle as the most original moralist in England has led to a fantastic monetary windfall. Since he is now “respectable,” his lady friend demands that he marry her.  Higgins learns that Eliza has left and becomes desperate to find her. Finally, he locates her at his mother’s home. Mrs. Higgins has taken a definite liking to Eliza and defends her to her insensitive son. Higgins importunes Eliza to return, asking her if she has ever known him to treat anyone any better than he has treated her. She agrees that he treats everyone equally badly, and, unconvinced that he can ever change, she leaves.  That same evening, Higgins realizes how much he misses Eliza. As he listens wistfully to the recording of their first meeting in his home, Eliza steps into the room, lifts the arm from the machine, and recites the next sentence in her former cockney accent. “I washed me face and hands before I came, I did.”   She has returned

      Features of Cockney English:  Some of the more characteristic features of the Cockney accent include the following:   Monophthongization  This affects the lexical set mouth vowel.   MOUTH vowel  Wells (1982b) believes that it is widely agreed that the "mouth" vowel is a "touchstone for distinguishing between "true Cockney" and popular London" and other more standard accents. Cockney usage would include monophthongization of the word mouth  Example:  mouth = mauf  rather than mouth   Glottal stop  Wells (1982b) describes the glottal stop as also particularly characteristic of Cockney and can be manifested in different ways such as "t" glottalling in final position. A 1970’s study of schoolchildren living in the East End found /p,t,k/ "almost invariably glottalized" in final position.   Examples:   cat =  up =  sock =   It can also manifest itself as a bare  as the realization of word internal intervocalic /t/  Examples:   Waterloo = Wa’erloo  City = Ci’y  A drink of water = A drin' a wa'er  A little bit of bread with a bit of butter on it = A li'le bi' of breab wiv a bi' of bu'er on i'.   As would be expected, an "Estuary English" speaker uses fewer glottal stops for t or d than a "London" speaker, but more than an RP speaker. However, there are some words where the omission of ‘t’ has become very accepted.  Examples:  Gatwick = Ga’wick Scotland = Sco'land statement = Sta'emen network = Ne’work  Dropped ‘h’ at beginning of words (Voiceless glottal fricative)  In the working-class ("common") accents throughout England, ‘h’ dropping at the beginning of certain words is heard often, but it’s certainly heard more in Cockney, and in accents closer to Cockney on the continuum between that and RP. The usage is strongly stigmatized by teachers and many other standard speakers.   Examples:  house = ‘ouse  hammer = ‘ammer  TH fronting  Another very well known characteristic of Cockney is th fronting which involves the replacement of the dental fricatives,  and  by labiodentals [f] and [v] respectively.   Examples:  thin = fin  brother = bruvver  three = free  bath = barf    Vowel lowering  Examples:  dinner = dinna  marrow= marra    Prosody  The voice quality of Cockney has been described as typically involving "chest tone" rather than "head tone" and being equated with "rough and harsh" sounds versus the velvety smoothness of the Kensington or Mayfair accents spoken by those in other more upscale areas of London.   Cockney Rhyming Slang  Cockney English is also characterized by its own special vocabulary and usage in the form of "cockney rhyming slang". The way it works is that you take a pair of associated words where the second word rhymes with the word you intend to say, then use the first word of the associated pair to indicate the word you originally intended to say. Some rhymes have been in use for years and are very well recognized, if not used, among speakers of other accents.  Examples:  "apples and pears" – stairs "plates of meat" – feet   There are others, however, that become established with the changing culture.  Example: "John Cleese" – cheese "John Major" - pager  Numerous examples and usage of rhyming slang can be found online. See Note 2 for information.

      http://www.derek.co.uk/cockney.htm FEATURES The six most striking features of Cockney are:  r is pronounced only when followed immediately by a vowel-sound. So, in the demonstration below, no r is pronounced in flowers. (Some New England accents and Southern U.S. accents have this same feature.)  h is usually omitted (home in the demonstration words); in self-conscious speech it's articulated very strongly.  l is pronounced only when a vowel-sound follows (so no l is pronounced in hole, etc.).  Voiceless th is often, but not always, pronounced as f (breath, etc.).  Voiced th is likewise often but not always pronounced as v (breathe, etc.) This feature is also found in Southern U.S. lower social class speech.  The long vowels are all diphthongs, as you can hear from the demonstration words. Notice especially the difference between force etc. (spelled with r followed by a consonant, though the r is not pronounced) and poor etc. (spelled with r not followed by a consonant, though again the r is not pronounced).

      Introduction  The local dialect of Philadelphia is not as well known as that of its neighbor to the north, New York City, but has nonetheless been fairly well studied. Linguists have been able to confirm through studies of Philadelphia and other urban centers that not only are dialects alive and well in America, but that in many places pronunciation is actually continuing to diverge from the national standard.  Americans commonly understand the two types of dialects as northern and southern, and they would certainly recognize Philadelphian as a dialect of the northern type. However, most linguists today recognize a third group, the Midland, which runs between the true Northern dialects and the true Southern dialects. Philadelphian is classified by these linguists as a North Midland dialect. Other researchers, notably Craig Carver, recognize only two major divisions of American English: Northern and Southern, and the Pennsylvania dialects as layers of the Northern group.  Included within the general area of the Philadelphia dialect, though naturally some differences can be expected, are the Pennsylvania suburbs as well as southern New Jersey and northern Delaware.    Pronunciation  One interesting feature of the dialect, in light of its geographic position, is its clear pronunciation in all positions of the 'r', including before consonants and at the end of words. Philadelphia and Baltimore are two of the only major port cities of the Atlantic coast to retain the 'r' in these positions, in contrast to New England, New York City, and the Coastal South, where they are dropped.  The dialect also has the following pronunciational characteristics:   words with "-er-" like "ferry" are pronounced "furry" with the short 'u' of "cut"  The "l" is very indistinct (dark or vocalized l), especially at the end of words, pronounced at the back of the mouth rather than the front, and the tip of the tongue does not touch the roof of the mouth.  the "-ow-" sound is pronounced as "al" with the type of indistinct, backed "l" described above.  words with "-ore" like "core" are pronounced "coor".  words with "-ar" like "car" are pronounced "caur" (non-locals may hear this as 'core')  words with "-ague" and "-eeg" are pronounced "-egg" and "-igg" respectively.  words with long "i" and an unvoiced consonant such as "ike" and "ite" are pronounced "uh-ee".  short 'a' in two forms - tense and lax - with complex distributions according to the following consonants.   The common local pronunciation of "Philadelphia" is "Fulladulfya," very often even in careful speech. It is spoken just like the separate words "full", "a", "dull", and then the monosyllabic ending "fya", in which the 'y' is consonantal.    Vocabulary   Naturally, Philadelphian has its own peculiar vocabulary. Some words are purely local, others are being used in other regions as well. Ten of the most commonly cited usages are as follows.  anymore, at the present time, currently. baby coach, baby carriage. bag school, skip school. hoagie, submarine sandwich. hotcake, pancake. scrapple, a local breakfast dish. square, city block. pavement, sidewalk. yo, hey there; hello. youse, you all, you plural.   For More Information   I have recently written two books dealing with Philadelphia speech, both of which go into much more detail than can be made available here on the web. Each of these titles is available through mail-order, or your local bookstore can order a copy for you.   A Grammar of the Philadelphia Dialect (1995)  The Philadelphia Dialect Dictionary (1996)  Pricing and other information for these titles is available from the Evolution Publishing page at Books in American Dialectology.   Bibliography  If you have a good library near you, these articles are worth checking out and are fairly easy to read for the non-linguist:  Quinn, Jim. 1975. "How to Talk Like a Philadelphian." Philadelphia Magazine, 66:11, pp. 136-154. Nov. 1975.  Quinn, Jim. 1976. "How to Talk Like a Philadelphian Part II." Philadelphia Magazine, 67:3, pp. 124-127. March 1976.  Tucker, R. Whitney. 1944. "Notes on the Philadelphia Dialect." American Speech 19:37-42  Tucker, R. Whitney, 1964. "More on the Philadelphia Dialect." American Speech 39:157-158.  If you can't get a hold of the journal American Speech, then consult the section on Pennsylvania in H.L. Mencken's American Language, Supplement II, which discusses Tucker's article. Hans Kurath's Word Geography has a few paragraphs on Philadelphia terms as well.  This next source is very difficult to track down, but it's well worth it for the serious student of the dialect, containing 300 local expressions, many of which are not found anywhere else, and their distributions among various age groups, ethnic groups, and neighborhoods:  Lebofsky, Dennis Stanley. 1970. The Lexicon of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. PhD. dissertation, Princeton University.   Web Links  Michael Ellis' Slanguages Page treats the speech of about 40 cities, but as a resident of the Delaware Valley, he has given special attention to the Philly area. He has also authored the first (that I know of) popular treatment of Philadelphia speech, which can be ordered from his page.  Also of interest is a glossary of Philly talk from native journalist Clark DeLeon, instructions on how to talk like a Philadelphian from another local journalist Stu Bykofsky, and finally a rather amusing rendition of Philly speak from a non-native Philadelphian struggling to learn our wierd and wonderful tongue.  And for those of you who want to see how people from other cities mangle the King's English, browse the links in the American Dialect Homepage.   Questions? Comments? Suggestions?  If you know of any localisms that might be of interest to the readers of our page, let me know, and I'll put them up on a feedback page.

      http://www.boston-online.com/glossary.html Pronunciation There I was, in the middle of the jungle in Guatemala, on the top of the tallest temple in Tikal. It was a beautiful sunset. Suddenly, from the other side of the temple, I heard "Renee, Renee, come around to the noahth side. That's wheah all the monkeys ah!" Sure enough, after we climbed down the temple I asked where they were from: Buhlington, of coahse."  -- Isobelw  Some comments about being a Bostoner abroad (further out than Worcester): People think I'm from New York. Once they hear I'm from Boston, they tell me some god-awful boring story of the time they went to Boston back in 1963 and how nice it was. When you say "aunt," people mock you by acting like you're some sort of blueblood. "Oh, Buffy, there's our AHNT." Puleeaase!  -- Christine Leccese  Yes, Bostonians really do drop their Rs after As, just like the Pepperidge Fahm Man.  But there's a lot more to the accent than that! It's not just after the A's that the R's go away. They disappear after other vowels as well, particularly "ee" sounds, so that one could properly argue that "Reveah is wicked wee-id" (translation: "Revere is unusual"). Christine Leccese explains the profound effect this can have on one's life: "I was 17 and reading a driver's ed. book before I realized that the mirror that hung from the windshield in the car was the REAR VIEW mirror. After hearing my family call it the 'reahview' my whole life, I thought it was REview mirror - so that you could review what you just passed, naturally."  Don't worry about poor lost New England R's, however. In typical Yankee fashion, we re-use 'em - by sticking them on the ends of certain other words ending with "uh" sounds: "Ah final ahs just disappeah, but wheah they go we've no idear."  But wait, it gets more complex. As seasoned Boston English speakah Alan Miles has gently tried to pound into a poor Nooyawka's thick head, that missing R only reappears when the word is followed by another word that starts with a vowel, for example: "I have no idear if the movie begins at nine or ten," but, "Does the movie begin at 9 or 10? I have no idea." Hey, just like French! Leccese, the Boston driver, also grew up wondering about the phrase "catchers catch can."  Jonathan E. Dyer notes this rule is nullified for certain words ending in "ure" such as "rapsha" (extreme joy) and "capsha" (what you do with a flag).   Also like French (and German), Boston English has an almost-R sound that is very difficult for most other Americans to reproduce. You'll hear it in words with an "er" sound. In Boston, the ordinal number after "second" is pronounced, roughly, "thihd." Try saying it as if you meant to pronounce the R but then thought better of it.  In Boston English, "ah" (the one without an R after it) sometimes becomes something closer to "aw", so that, for example, "tonic" comes out more like "tawnic" (former Mayor Kevin White would often express outrage by exclaiming "Motheragawd!"). In other cases, however, it assumes a British pronunciation, as in "ahnt and "bahthroom," says Carrie-Anne Dedeo, a native of B'rica (which is how you pronounce "Billerica" around here).  Bostonians, like Nooyawkas, often leave out consonants in their rush to get words out, in particular, d's and t's at the end of words. So "so don't I" is more properly pronounced "So doan I," real-estate brokers babble on about houses with plenny a chahm and we get such phrases as onna-conna. Also like Nooyawkas, Bostonians often change the "s" at the end of words to a a "z." "I toll you already, I can't go out on Tuesdiz, 'caz that's when I got practiz," as Don Hurter recalls.   However, Ds at the end of words ending in "id" sounds end up as Ts, so that, for example, "wicked" comes out as "wicket."  But sometimes, Bostonians add consonants, as well. Jeff W. recalls: "My father, who grew up in Brighton in the 1940s and 50s, adds the letter 'n' to the words 'out' and 'outside.' It's sort of a slum version of the Boston accent, as I've heard others from that time and place use it. Therefore, I grew up saying things like, 'Ya wanna go ountside in the yahd?' 'Let's find ount who's going.'   And one-syllable words with long-I sounds, such as "mine," often turn into two-syllable words: "Gimme back that curlin' eye-yen, it's MAYAN!" (as Douglas K. Lennan notes). Bostonians also sometimes add H's to the beginning of words that begin with a vowel, reports Jo: "We buy our hundaweah at Hames."  Finally, in certain blue-collar communities on the North Shore, speakers sometimes replace Rs with, of all things, Vs, reports John Lawler, who provides an example: "Tevesah doesn't have any bvains, she's from Veveah."

      http://www.aliensonearth.com/ Area 51, also known as Groom Lake, is a secret military facility about 90 miles north of Las Vegas. The number refers to a 6-by-10-mile block of land, at the center of which is a large air base the government will not discuss. The site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bed for landings. Groom Lake is America's traditional testing ground for "black budget" aircraft before they are publicly acknowledged. The facility and surrounding areas are also associated -- with varying levels of credibility -- with UFO and conspiracy stories. In 1989, Bob Lazar claimed on a Las Vegas television station that he had worked with alien spacecraft at Papoose Lake, south of Area 51. Since then, "Area 51" has become a popular symbol for the alleged U.S. Government UFO cover-up. [GC 8/96]   The page below is an entry point into the largest public database of information on the base and surrounding areas, assembled by the [old] Area 51 Research Center. Much about Area 51 remains a mystery, but here's what we do know.

      African-American  Background This linguistic variety is commonly refered to as Black English (BE), Black English Vernacular (BE), African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), and Inner City English (ICE).  There have been three primary theories regarding the source of African-American English. These three theories can be named the following:  Decreolized Creole  Variety of Southern States English  The "Unified" Theory  Proponents of the decreolized creole theory maintain that African-American English arose from a pidgin that was created among slaves from various linguistic backgrounds, primarily from West Africa. This pidgin included features of both the West African languages and English. Over time, this pidgin developed into a creole, and then more recently, became decreolized, and began to resemble English more closely.  Others state that African-American English is a variety of Southern States English, noting that the two varieties have many features in common, such as the Southern Vowel Shift, vowel lowering, and double modals.  Proponents of the unified theory state that African-American English arose from a number of sources, including West African languages and Southern States English, through a variety of evolutionary tracks.   Features of African-American English African-American English has a number of phonological features, including:  Consonant Cluster Reduction  Realization of /T/ and /D/ as /t,f/ and /d,v/  Vowel Lowering  /z/ -> [d] in Contractions  Monophthongization  R-lessness  Exercises Phonetics  Phonology  International Phonetic Alphabet  Linguistic and Social Variability  Accent Phonology  How Accents Differ  Why Accents Differ  Lexical Sets  Historical Issues  Discourse  http://www.ic.arizona.edu/~lsp/AAEnglish.html

      1. The -ough -augh problem:    Words that end with ought or aught will almost always end with the sound of -ot  as in not.    bought  sought   thought  ought  taught  caught  fought    The only other common way to spell that sound is with the letters  OT, as in the words  not, got, lot, plot, spot. Therefore, when you want to spell a word that ends with the -ot sound, you have but three choices, -ot , -aught, or -ought.  All you need to do is memorize the shorter list of words ending with -aught and -ought.  Then, when you want to spell a word ending with the -ot sound and that word is not on the list you memorized, you will know that it should be spelled with the letters -OT (unless it is an exception we have not thought of).  Words that end with -ough have no dependable pattern of pronunciation.   Rough, tough and enough rhyme with each other and end with the same sound as stuff.  Using the words in a rhyme might help you remember that they are spelled alike so if you know how to spell any one of them, you will know the others, also: I'm rough and tough and that's enough.   Bough, a tree limb, rhymes with cow,  a four-footed animal that gives milk. Bough also rhymes with bow, what a stage performer does after the show, bending at the waist toward the audience.  But then, how do you tell the difference between bow (rhymes with how) and  bow (rhymes with go), which is what one shoots an arrow with?  This is where the idea of CONTEXT comes in.  Context refers to the situation in which the word is used - what the other words in the sentence are referring to.  "After the archer shot an arrow into the bull's eye, he leaned his bow against the bough and gave a bow to the audience."  The words archer and arrow tell us that the first bow probably refers to the instrument with which an arrow is shot, which means it will rhyme with GO.  The second bow is used in a part of the sentence which includes the word audience, so this probably refers to the action of bending at one's waist as a sign of respect or appreciation and will rhyme with HOW or NOW.  Though rhymes with go or show.  In advertisements or informal writing it is often written as tho, which seems much more logical.  Through ends with a Long U sound and is pronounced the same as threw, what Sammy did with the baseball.  "Sammy threw the ball through the window."  How can you remember which is which?  Think about who threw something.  He threw ; She threw ; We threw ; They threw.  Notice the letter E in each of the words.  (What if I threw or You threw?  I guess you would still have to think of threw with he, she, we or they.)  Remember that the word that means "sent an object flying by releasing it from one's swinging hand"  has an E in it, thus must be threw.  Cough rhymes with off  Another odd word is  draught, which rhymes with shaft.  2. The -ight dilemma: There is a family of words in English that ends with the letters -ight and is pronounced kind of like "ah-ee-t", or like a long i + t. Hundreds of years ago, the gh was pronounced, but time and speech patterns changed; Now you just have to write the letters, not pronounce them. These words rhyme with  bite or kite.   -ight is a large family and when you hear that sound in a word, there is a better than 60% chance that you will be correct if you spell it with -ight.  The main branch of the family consists of: fight, light, night, might, right, tight, sight, insight, mighty, fighter, nightly, wight, fright, delight, bright.  2 1/2.  Eigh: A silly way to spell A.  All of the words in this family share the same spelling of the sound of Long A.    eight, freight, weight rhyme with gate. Since there are only a few members of this family, you should be able to remember them easily. Try this: "What is the weight of the freight on car number eight?"   If you are able to spell any of these words, then you will know the others because the endings are all the same.   Relatives of the -eight family are weigh and sleigh. These words keep the Long A sound, but without the T at the end. Weigh and sleigh rhyme with way and slay.   3.  Words with beginning letters that are silent. A method often  used when learning to spell such words is to pronounce the silent letter to yourself every time you write the word. If you do that all the time, every time, you will not forget. But how, you may ask, does one know which words begin with silent letters if you hear the words but do not see them? That is simple....you cannot. That is why it is important to read as much as possible so you become familiar with just about any word you are likely to hear.  Silent P - psychology, psychiatrist, psychoanalysis, pneumatic, pneumonia. As you are preparing to write the word, say to yourself, "p-sy-chol-ogy", not "sy-chol-ogy" or "p-neu-mon-ia", not "neu-mon-ia".  Silent k - knife, know, knew, knit, knapsack, knuckle, knock, knickers. The same trick works with these words. EVERY time you write the word, pronounce the silent K to yourself, so as you write you are thinking, "k-nife", not "nife", and "k-nap-sack", not "nap-sack"  Miscellaneous: gnat, gnaw. Use the same method as with the Silent P and the Silent K.  4.  Try different ways to study.  People learn new information in different ways.  These are called "Learning Styles".  Some people simply need to read new information and it seems to stick in their brains as if it were glued there, or as if they had a video recorder in their heads.  Other people learn new things better if they hear it explained or described.  Still others need to use the new information in some way, such as reading it aloud or discussing it with someone or by writing it on a chalkboard or in a notebook.  Many people like to use a combination of these methods.  Here is a good rule to follow:  The more difficult something is for you to learn, the more you need to use extra channels to get the information into your brain.  Learning Channels (How information gets into our brains):  sight hearing motion touch speech   SIGHT - Receiving information into your brain through your eyes.  This can be by reading, watching a movie or video, watching what happens around you.  Motion, larger size and bright colors make SIGHT information easier to remember.  HEARING - Receiving information into your brain through your ears.  This can be by listening to your teacher or other students in class; by listening to tapes, CD's, radio or other sources of sound information; by listening to yourself as you read or speak.  MOTION - Receiving information into your brain through movements that your body makes.  This can be whole body movements such as running, skating, playing tennis, or movements in small parts of your body as in writing, drawing, or building a model plane.  Speaking also involves moving parts of your body.  Your brain will remember movements that you make time after time in the same way a path will be worn across a field if people walk the same way day after day.  TOUCH - Receiving information into your brain through your sense of touch.  Nerve endings in your fingertips and all over your skin can sense heat and cold, rough and smooth, and a variety of other textures and conditions.  Ways to use TOUCH to help you learn or remember new information: write words with your fingertips in sand (or salt) spread over a large tray; use finger paints to write or draw new information; use textured letters (made of carpeting, plastic, wood, metal, etc.) to spell out words.   SPEECH - This actually combines most of the other channels in one activity: the motion of your lips, tongue, cheeks, jaw, vocal chords, lungs; hearing the sounds that your speech organs make; seeing words on a page if the speech involves reading aloud; touch if you follow along on the page or chalkboard with your finger while you read.      Assignment:  Write all the spelling words from this page in your notebook.  Allow 3 lines for each word.  On the first line, write the first two or three definitions of the word (if there are that many).  On the second line, use the word in a sentence that you make up.  On the third line, write the word one letter at a time as you say each letter aloud.  Look at the word carefully, then close your eyes and picture the word with each letter clearly visible.  Write the word with your eyes closed.  Repeat these steps until you are sure that you know the word completely.  When you have studied 10 words this way, get a friend ( or enemy or relative) to read each word to you as spell the word and use it in a sentence.    Note: Of course, there is no need to do this with words you already know, but be honest with yourself.  If you cannot spell the word correctly or use it in a sentence, then you need to study it.  For more frustration, meet the Word Families on the next page.

      Absolutely Ridiculous English Spelling    Why does the English language have so many words that are difficult to spell?  The main reason is that English has 1,100 different ways to spell its 44 separate sounds, more than any other language.  Some of the results of this are:   Words that have the same sounds but are spelled differently,    Words that contain letters that have nothing to do with the way the words are pronounced,    Words that contain silent letters; that is, letters that must be included when you write the words even though they are not pronounced,    Spelling rules that have lists of exceptions - words that do not follow the rules and thus must be memorized separately.     This situation exists because English has adopted words from many other languages, or at least has partially adopted them.  Very often, English has accepted the new words with their original spellings, but has not always adopted the original pronunciations, or pronunciations were changed by common habit or political expediency, but the original spellings were never changed to match the new pronunciations.    The reasons for the Ridiculous English Spelling do not matter, however, because  English is what it is; it has been this way for a long time.  If you want to learn to speak and write it, you must learn it as it is and not how it should be.  Our task is to make it a little easier for you.        To order Free "Absolutely Ridiculous English Spelling" lessons by e-mail, or to buy the lessons on a CD, floppy disk, printed on paper, or on Audio Cassette, go to our Order Page.    Some common inconsistencies:  Pattern Examples  How they are pronounced   words containing "ough" thought, bought, fought, brought  enough, rough, tough, slough  through   though, although, dough, thorough  cough  bough, doughty   end with sound of "ot" as in POT, NOT  end with sound of "uff" as in STUFF  ends with sound of Long U, as in the word THREW or SHOE  end with the sound of Long O, as in NO or GO  ends with the sound "OFF  contain the same sound as "COW" or "NOW"     Words that sound the same but are spelled differently. byte, bite, bight  seen, scene  hear, here  sense, cents, scents  their, there, they're  feet, feat  ate, eight  err, heir, air   Long i + t  Long e + n  Long e + r  all end with the sound of "-ENCE" or "-ENSE"  Long a + r  Long e + t  Long a + t  Long a + r    Words containing "ight" alight, bight, flight, light, night, might, right, sight, tight, plight, fright,    In all of these words, "ight" is pronounced like Long i + t.  Words with Silent Letters gnat, gnaw  know, knee, knife, knit, knickers, knuckle  psychology, psychiatrist, pneumonia  should, could, would  isle, aisle, island  wrap, wrinkle, write  debt, doubt  often, listen, soften, castle   All of these words are pronounced as if the red letters were not there, but when you write the words, you MUST include those letters.     Some more inconsistencies:  Ways to spell Long 'U' shoe, grew, through. do, doom, flue, two, who, brute, duty  Ways to spell Long 'O' go, show, though, sew, beau, float, bone,  Ways to spell Long 'A' may, weigh, late, pain, rein,  great  Ways to spell Long 'E' free, bean, magazine, gene, mete, be, mien, receive, believe  Ways to spell Long 'I' fine, rhyme, fight, align, isometric, bayou   The chart above is just a small sample of why Spelling Rules in English can be almost as much of a problem as spelling itself.  Notice the "i-e" Rule:  Use i before e, except after c, or when sounding like a as in neighbor and weigh.    This is a nice, neat little rule concerning words that have the letters i and e together, usually  to form the Long E sound in English: i before e, as in piece or relief.  Then the rule says "Except after C".  The ie becomes ei , as in receive and deceit.   Now you know that the Long E sound in English can be made by 'ie', unless the sound comes after 'c', in which case it is made by 'ei', (except for those times when the Long E sound is made by 'ee' or 'ea' or 'e' or 'i' or 'oe').  Then the Rule tells you about another exception - when the i and the e are together in a word and are pronounced like Long A, the e must come before the i.  Examples: neighbor, sleigh, weigh, freight, etc.  In this one short Rule, there are already  two exceptions to it covering dozens of other words, but that is not the end.  There are many words that do not follow the Rule or its exceptions: seize, weird, neither, either, foreign, sovereign, forfeit, counterfeit, leisure, heifer, protein, geiger (as in 'counter'), height, sleight, feisty, seismograph, poltergeist, kaleidoscope.   At this point you may ask, "What can I do about it? How can I figure out how to spell the words in this crazy language?" Believe it or not, there are a few things you can do that will help, but after you remember the rules and learn the 'tricks', you are left with this basic technique: Study, Memorize, Study, Memorize, Study, Memorize.  Exercise: For each of the words in the list below, write the definition (from a dictionary) and write a sentence using the word.  1. scene      2. seen      3. scent      4. sent      5. cent      6. err      7. air      8. heir      9. feet      10.feat      11. new      12. knew      13. hear      14. here

      Phonics Rules   The vowels are "a,e,i,o, and u"; also sometimes "y" & "w". This also includes the diphthongs "oi,oy,ou,ow,au,aw, oo" and many others.  The consonants are all the other letters which stop or limit the flow of air from the throat in speech. They are: "b,c,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,p,qu,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z,ch,sh,th,ph,wh, ng, and gh".   1. Sometimes the rules don't work.  There are many exceptions in English because of the vastness of the language and the many languages from which it has borrowed. The rules do work however, in the majority of the words.   2. Every syllable in every word must have a vowel.  English is a "vocal" language; Every word must have a vowel.   3. "C" followed by "e, i or y" usually has the soft sound of "s". Examples: "cyst", "central", and "city".   4. "G" followed by "e, i or y" usually has the soft sound of "j". Example: "gem", "gym", and "gist".   5. When 2 consonants a joined together and form one new sound, they are a consonant digraph. They count as one sound and one letter and are never separated. Examples: "ch,sh,th,ph and wh".   6. When a syllable ends in a consonant and has only one vowel, that vowel is short. Examples: "fat, bed, fish, spot, luck".   7. When a syllable ends in a silent "e", the silent "e" is a signal that the vowel in front of it is long. Examples: "make, fete, kite, rope, and use".   8. When a syllable has 2 vowels together, the first vowel is usually long and the second is silent. Examples: "pain, eat, boat, res/cue, say, grow". NOTE: Diphthongs don't follow this rule; In a diphthong, the vowels blend together to create a single new sound. The diphthongs are: "oi,oy,ou,ow,au,aw, oo" and many others.   9. When a syllable ends in any vowel and is the only vowel, that vowel is usually long. Examples: "pa/per, me, I, o/pen, u/nit, and my".   10. When a vowel is followed by an "r" in the same syllable, that vowel is "r-controlled". It is not long nor short. "R-controlled "er,ir,and ur" often sound the same (like "er"). Examples: "term, sir, fir, fur, far, for, su/gar, or/der".     Basic Syllable Rules  1. To find the number of syllables:  ---count the vowels in the word,  ---subtract any silent vowels, (like the silent "e" at the end of a word or the second vowel when two vowels a together in a syllable)  ---subtract one vowel from every dipthong, (diphthongs only count as one vowel sound.)  ---the number of vowels sounds left is the same as the number of syllables.  The number of syllables that you hear when you pronounce a word is the same as the number of vowels sounds heard. For example:  The word "came" has 2 vowels, but the "e" is silent, leaving one vowel sound andone syllable.  The word "outside" has 4 vowels, but the "e" is silent and the "ou" is a diphthong which counts as only one sound, so this word has only two vowels sounds and therefore, two syllables.   2. Divide between two middle consonants.  Split up words that have two middle consonants. For example:  hap/pen, bas/ket, let/ter, sup/per, din/ner, and Den/nis. The only exceptions are the consonant digraphs. Never split up consonant digraphs as they really represent only one sound. The exceptions are "th", "sh", "ph", "th", "ch", and "wh".   3. Usually divide before a single middle consonant.  When there is only one syllable, you usually divide in front of it, as in:  "o/pen", "i/tem", "e/vil", and "re/port". The only exceptions are those times when the first syllable has an obvious short sound, as in "cab/in".   4. Divide before the consonant before an "-le" syllable.  When you have a word that has the old-style spelling in which the "-le" sounds like "-el", divide before the consonant before the "-le". For example: "a/ble", "fum/ble", "rub/ble" "mum/ble" and "thi/stle". The only exception to this are "ckle" words like "tick/le".   5. Divide off any compound words, prefixes, suffixes and roots which have vowel sounds.  Split off the parts of compound words like "sports/car" and "house/boat". Divide off prefixes such at "un/happy", "pre/paid", or "re/write". Also divide off suffixes as in the words "farm/er", "teach/er", "hope/less" and "care/ful". In the word "stop/ping", the suffix is actually "-ping" because this word follows the rule that when you add "-ing" to a word with one syllable, you double the last consonant and add the "-ing".    Accent Rules  When a word has more than one syllable, one of the syllables is always a little louder than the others. The syllable with the louder stress is the accented syllable. It may seem that the placement of accents in words is often random or accidental, but these are some rules that usually work.   1. Accents are often on the first syllable. Examples: ba'/sic, pro'/gram.   2. In words that have suffixes or prefixes, the accent is usually on the main root word. Examples: box'/es, un/tie'.   3. If de-, re-, ex-, in-,po-, pro-, or a- is the first syllable in a word, it is usually not accented. Examples: de/lay', ex/plore'.   4. Two vowel letters together in the last syllable of a word often indicates an accented last syllable. Examples: com/plain', con/ceal'.   5. When there are two like consonant letters within a word, the syllable before the double consonants is usually accented. Examples: be/gin'/ner, let'/ter.   6. The accent is usually on the syllable before the suffixes -ion, ity, -ic, -ical, -ian, -ial, or -ious, and on the second syllable before the suffix -ate. Examples: af/fec/ta'/tion, dif/fer/en'/ti/ate.   7. In words of three or more syllables, one of the first two syllables is usually accented. Examples: ac'/ci/dent, de/ter'/mine.

      Writing (and therefore spelling) is a representation of the spoken word. The spoken word is not a representation of writing. Because accents and pronunciation can change easily and quite quickly, whereas what is written in books and dictionaries remains "fixed" for years, as well as for various historical reasons, there is often little correspondence between spoken English (pronunciation) and written English (spelling). English spelling therefore often appears to be totally illogical. The following rules can help you to decode the mysteries of English spelling. But remember, even the best rules have their exceptions.  Adding -er/-est quick, quicker, quickest, happy, happier, happiest, hot, hotter, hottest...   Adding -ing/-ed work, working, worked, stop, stopping, stopped...   Adding -ly loud, loudly, happy, happily, terrible, terribly...   Adding -s dog, dogs, church, churches, wife, wives...   -ible or -able accessible, visible, dependable, networkable...   -ie- or -ei- friend, fiend, feint, freight...   British and American English Spelling Differences colour, color, practise, practice, tyre, tire...

      Estuary English is a name given to the form(s) of English widely spoken in and around London and, more generally, in the southeast of England — along the river Thames and its estuary. On this website we hope to bring together as many documents as possible that relate to Estuary English, as a convenient resource for the many interested enquirers.  Transcribing Estuary English: a discussion document John Wells, University College London   Introduction  Many of our native-speaker undergraduates use a variety of English that I suppose we have to call Estuary English, following Rosewarne 1984, 1994, Coggle 1993, and many recent reports on press and television. So do many of the patients our BSc students will have to deal with.That is, they use the popular speech of the southeast of England (based on that of London, and thus supposedly centred on the Thames estuary). This means that their accent is located somewhere in the continuum between RP and broad Cockney (= the broadest London working-class variety).   I would really prefer to call this variety simply London English, although obviously its ambit is much wider than the GLC area, covering at least most of the urban south-east. Other names we could refer to it by might include General London (GL), McArthur's New London Voice, and Tebbitt-Livingstone-speak. (Note that Rosewarne seems to use the term 'London speech' to refer to what I call Cockney, since he refers to 'a continuum with RP and London speech at either end', with his Estuary English speakers 'grouped in the middle ground'.) Nevertheless, it has to be acknowledged that the term 'Estuary English' has already achieved some degree of public recognition. As with the equally unsatisfactory term 'Received Pronunciation', we are forced to go along.    Phonetics of Estuary English  Estuary English (EE) is like RP, but unlike Cockney, in being associated with standard grammar and usage; it is like Cockney, but unlike RP (as traditionally described), in being characterized by tendencies towards, for example,  vocalization of preconsonantal/final /l/, perhaps with various vowel mergers before it (miwk-bottoo 'milk-bottle')  striking allophony in GOAT (> [QU] before dark /l/ or its reflex), leading perhaps to a phonemic split (wholly holy)  use of [?] for traditional [t] in many non-initial positions (take i' off)  diphthong shift, particularly of the FACE, PRICE and GOAT vowels (wotshor nime?)  yod coalescence even before a stressed /u:/ (Chooseday) Phonetically EE differs from Cockney in usually not being characterized by, for example,  h-dropping ('and on 'eart)  TH fronting (I fink)  monophthongal realization of the MOUTH vowel (Sahfend).  It is not entirely clear whether EE is to be regarded as a variety (lect, dialect) in its own right, or whether it is simply the formal style/register for which Cockney is the informal one. A decision depends on two empirical issues:  Is there a casual style of EE that is unquestionably distinct from Cockney? Tentatively, yes: there may well be speakers who avoid stigmatized h-dropping even in their most casual style (as RP speakers do; NB we are not dealing here with /h/ in unstressed pronouns.).  Is there a formal style of Cockney that is distinct from EE? Tentatively, yes: Cockney is arguably the speech of the uneducated, who are unable to achieve standard grammar even where it might be called for; while EE speakers are those who can consistently use standard grammar with ease and fluency.  The boundary between EE and RP is also hard to establish. Presumably it rests on the degree of localizability: EE is localizable as belonging to the southeast of England (see Coggle's impressionistic sketch-map, 1993:28), whereas RP is not. (Many of Rosewarne's comments surely relate to style or to change over time, rather than to the decline of RP, to localizability or to the Thames estuary area. Things like cheers for thank you/goodbye are surely part of contemporary casual RP/StdEng -- at least I use them, and no-one has ever suggested that I am a speaker of EE! Some commentators seem not to appreciate that RP can be spoken in informal situations.)    Principles of transcribing EE  We need a standardized phonetic transcription for the EE accent. Although Rosewarne and Coggle have arguably done a public service by drawing attention to it, neither they nor anyone else (as far as I am aware) has attempted a serious phonetic description of it; nor indeed have they ever transcribed more than the odd sound in isolation. Once we have standardized and codified EE, we could teach it to students, ask them to do transcription exercises using it, and give phonetic dictation in it. Quite apart from its importance for EE's own native speakers and their imitators, it would furthermore attract great interest and attention among EFL teachers disenchanted with RP. Some might wish to teach it to their EFL pupils. ('Because it obscures sociolinguistic origins, "Estuary English" is attractive to many' - Rosewarne 1984.) The present document aims to highlight some of the decisions we would need to make in arriving at a standardized transcription.   One basic question we must face is: how comparative should the EE transcription system be? Should we use phonetically explicit symbols, often different from those we use for RP (with the resultant risk of confusing the beginner)? Or is it more sensible to use the same symbols as for RP wherever possible, but with different conventions of interpretation? E.g.,   Should we write EE face as fVIs or as feIs?  Should we write EE price as prAIs or as praIs?  Should we write EE loaf as lVUf or as l@Uf?  Should we write EE goose as g}:s or as gu:s?  My view is that for the time being, at any rate, we should take a minimalist position. We should aim to make the notation as similar as possible to that used for RP. So we would continue to transcribe the above words in the usual way. Just as the symbol /{/ in cat can already in RP cover a range of possibilities from around cardinal [E] to cardinal [a], so /eI/ in face can be permitted to cover a range of possible first elements for the diphthong, from conservative RP [e] to qualities in the area [E ~ 6 ~ V ~ {].   Exceptions to this principle might perhaps be made, though, for   the diphthongs of price and mouth (RP /praIs, maUT/), for which it seems most intuitive to write EE /prAIs, m{UT/ (for the latter, compare also Cockney [m{:f]);  explicit notation of the glottal stop as a realization of /t/.  Competing solutions  This means that the most important remaining decision is how to symbolize the product of l vocalization. For RP /l/ in non-prevocalic positions, EE uses a vocoid in the area [7, o, U, u]. This may be non-syllabic, typically forming the second element of a new diphthong in milk, shell etc.; or it may be syllabic, as in middle. Let us consider a selection of possible solutions, looking at the pros and cons of each.   first solution: write U, thus mIUk, SeU, "mIdU  pro: familiar symbol;  con: implies phonetic (and for the syllabic vocoid, phonemic) identity with the vowel of put, which is wrong. Articulatorily, the l-vocalization product is considerably further back than the /U/ of put, which can nowadays be very central. second solution: write w, thus mIwk, Sew, ("mIdw)  pro: reasonably intuitive for the non-syllabic vocoid; but we should need something else for the syllabic;  con: implies phonemic identification with prevocalic /w/, which is questionable; violates the general English phonotactic constraint against final semivowels. (To overcome the objection to syllabic w, John Maidment suggests using an omega, w. But I find this unacceptable on general transcriptional and typographic grounds.) third solution: write o, thus mIok, Seo, "mIdo  pro: phonetically reasonable, visually distinctive. On balance my preferred solution;  con: in various other accents (Scottish, GenAm) this symbol is associated with the vowel of goat.  I therefore suggest that we adopt o as the symbol for the vocalized-l vocoid, whether as the second element of a diphthong or as an independent weak vowel. Phonologically, a case can be made for regarding [o] as still a member of the /l/ phoneme; but clearly in this regard our standard notation must allowed to be allophonic. (In view of the phonological indeterminacy here, though, I think we should permit people to write "/o/", and for that matter "/?/".)    Vowel problems  The mimimalist assumption is that all vowel contrasts are preserved before /o/. So, unless there are reasons not to, we could expect to be able to write: field fi:od, build bIod, wealth weoT, canal k@"n{o, Charles tSA:oz, doll dQo, call *kO:o, pull pUo, school *sku:o, bulk bVok, world w3:od, sandals "s{ndoz, fail feIo, roll *r@Uo, mile mAIo, howl h{Uo, oil OIo, real *rI@o. (There seem to be no items with RP nonprevocalic /e@l, U@l/.) This assumption appears to be incorrect, though, with at least those items that are asterisked in the list: we must now explore them.   Words like roll. As we know, EE speakers (and many others) intuitively reject the identification of the vowel of goal, told with the phoneme /@U/. For some time we have been offering them the symbol QU. It is clear to them, furthermore, that goalie does not rhyme with slowly, nor roller with polar. By our minimalist principle, we keep @U for go g@U, slowly "sl@Uli and polar "p@Ul@. We can write QU in goalie "gQUli and roller "rQUl@. The question then arises with goal and told, do we write gQUo and tQUod (preserving the reflex of the lateral as o), or simply gQU and tQUd ? (I assume that -- in spite of what may happen in Cockney -- gQo is not correct for goal, since it does not rhyme with doll dQo.) In general, does the former lateral get fully absorbed after back vowels? Or does it leave o behind? The conservative inference is that it does leave some phonetic residue, or that we must at least allow for this possibility. Hence I recommend goal gQUo (although I would change this recommendation if gQU proves adequate).   Words like cool. The same question arises with cool, and perhaps with pull and call. The vowel of EE cool [kou, ku:] is phonetically very different from that of coo [k}:, k1}]. In cool the quality is back, in coo central; both vowels may be somewhat diphthongal. If we continue to write /u:/ in coo /ku:/ (rather than, say, the phonetically more explicit [}:]), we need something else for cool.   Some speakers may be happy with the notation ku:o, which implies the phonemic identification of this vowel with that of coo. Others will not be, but it may be the case that none of them preserve the distinction between fool and full, so that they would accept the notation kUo. Actually, for some EE speakers kO:o might be appropriate, namely those who have a cockney-style three-way homophony pool-pull-Paul.   Note, though, that EE pooling is distinct from pulling. So cooling would presumably have to be "ku:lIN. Does this give rise to a problem in the light of words such as truly "tru:li and clueless "klu:l@s ? (Compare the goalie-slowly contrast discussed above) If it does, we shall have to think of something else.   Words like call. Then there is the question of words with RP /O:l/. Is the product of l vocalization absorbed into a preceding /O:/? If it is absorbed, board and bald come out homophonous, as do pause and Paul's; if it is not fully absorbed, they remain distinct. We should be prepared to write bald as bO:d or bO:od respectively.   There is, however, another issue. Although Paul's and pause may be homophonous, Paul and paw are certainly not. Nor are board and bored, in spite of their homophony in RP. For which of these vowels should we reserve the familiar notation /O:/?   If we write /O:/ for paw-pour-pore /pO:/ and bored /bO:d/, we need some other symbol for pause and Paul's. A possibility would be /o:/ in pause, thought, board; Paul's would have the same notation if homophonous, otherwise /Oo/.  If on the other hand we reserve the notation /O:/ for pause, thought, board, we could recognize the tendency towards a centring-diphthong quality in paw-pour-pore by writing /O@/, thus paws /pO@z/, bored /bO@d/. The notation /Oo/ would still be available for Paul's if distinct from pause.  Thus in any case the best notation for the vowel of EE call may be /Oo/. Therefore some EE speakers can write cool, too, as /kOo/. Others will have call /kOo/ but cool /kUo/.   Words like real. EE real is a homophone of reel and should accordingly be written ri:o. (In Cockney real and reel are homophones of rill and can all be written rIo.) Presumably really can acceptably be written "ri:li, implying a rhyme with freely -- or should it perhaps be "ri:oli ?   There may other vowel neutralizations in the context of a following dark /l/ or its reflex. They are probably confined to Cockney and therefore irrelevant for the EE we are considering here. Examples of possible 'new' homophones include feel-fill, well-whirl, child's-Charles, veil-Val-vowel, doll-dole, pool-pull-Paul. However EE regularly makes rhymes of oil-royal ("OIo, "rOIo), owl-vowel ("{Uo, "v{Uo(?)).    The glottal stop  To revert to the question of the glottal stop: although it is surely no more than an allophone of /t/, I think we could well consider writing glottal stop for /t/ in certain positions. I would suggest that we prescribe "/?/" for traditional /t/ in the following environment:  when BOTH preceded by a vowel (including /o/ from /l/), or /n/;  AND followed by the end of a word or by a consonant other than /r/. t > ? / [+son] _ {C, ##} (ordered later than the rule making /tr/ an affricate!)   Examples:  bit  bI?  football  "fU?bOo   belt  beo?  Cheltenham  "tSeo?n@m   bent  ben?  Bentley  "ben?li    This applies particularly where the syllable in question is unstressed:   Examples: stop it  "stQp I?  bullet-proof  "bUlI?pru:f    With a preceding obstruent, however, [?] is not possible: compare best best (never *bes?). Glottal replacement does not happen in EE mattress "m{tr@s (cf. possible Cockney "m{?r@s). And glottalling word-internally before a vowel is well-known as a 'rough' pronunciation variant: thus EE water "wO:t@, but Cockney "wOU?@.    Other points  We have already decided to adopt the symbols /i, u/ for RP in happy, influence. They can be applied to EE, too, where they will tend definitely to imply tense vowels more similar to /i:, u:/ than to /I, U/. The relationship between EE /O:/ and /o/ (normal /"nO:mo/) is comparable to that between /i:/ and /i/ (weedy /"wi:di/), namely that the first in each pair belongs to the strong vowel system, the second to the weak.   If these ideas are accepted we end up with a standardized systematic transcription system for EE. (It is 'systematic' rather than 'phonemic', because of the use of /o, ?, i, u/.) Once we have agreed it, I intend to prepare some classroom materials using it. Before that, though, -- colleagues (particularly native speakers of EE), do let me know your views.

      The passive voice is used when focusing on the person or thing affected by an action.    The Passive is formed: Passive Subject + To Be + Past Particple  It is often used in business and in other areas where the object of the action is more important than those who perform the action. For Example: We have produced over 20 different models in the past two years. Changes to: Over 20 different models have been produced in the past two years.  If the agent (the performer of the action) is important, use "by" For Example: Tim Wilson wrote "The Flight to Brunnswick" in 1987. Changes to:"The Flight to Brunnswick" was written in 1987 by Tim Wilson.  Only verbs that take an object can be used in the passive.  The following chart includes sentences changed from the active to the passive in the principal tenses.   Active  Passive Time Reference   They make Fords in Cologne.  Fords are made in Cologne. Present Simple   Susan is cooking dinner.  Dinner is being cooked by Susan Present Continuous   James Joyce wrote "Dubliners".  "Dubliners" was written by James Joyces. Past Simple   They were painting the house when I arrived.  The house was being painted when I arrived. Past Continuous   They have produced over 20 models in the past two years.  Over 20 models have been produced in the past two years. Present Perfect   They are going to build a new factory in Portland.  A new factory is going to be built in Portland. Future Intention with Going to   I will finish it tomorrow.  It will be finished tomorrow. Future Simple

      http://teenwriting.about.com/library/weekly/aa100702a.htm Active Versus Passive Voice  When the subject of a sentence performs the action of the verb, the sentence is said to be in active voice.   The dog bit the mailman. If the subject is being acted on, then the sentence is said to be in passive voice.  The mailman was bitten by the dog. The mailman has become the subject of this sentence, but he isn't performing the action; the dog is the one doing the biting.  Here are some more examples of active and passive sentences. As you read them, think about where the emphasis falls in each one.   active: George ate the chocolate bar. passive: The chocolate bar was eaten by George.  active: The store clerk shouted at my mother. passive: My mother was shouted at by the store clerk.   active: John had eaten all the doughnuts by the time we got home. passive: All the doughnuts had been eaten by John by the time we got home. passive: All the doughnuts had been eaten by the time we got home.   Keep it Active  Notice how the active sentences are all a little shorter than the passive ones. This means you can keep your writing concise and snappy. Active sentences tend to be more dynamic and easier to read and understand. Though there will be times when passive voice is useful (see Part 3), it's almost always better to use active voice.

      TO SPELL YOU MUST: 1. Recognize letters and sounds. 2. Remember the correct sequence of letters and spell the word in your mind. 3. Recall the sequence.   MEMORY 1. We remember what we want to remember. 2. We tend to remember the most recently learned material. 3. Practice is essential for memory. 4. The easiest material to remember is that which we have discovered ourselves.   BUT HOW? 1. Make the spelling words relevant. Learn spelling within a context. (Write letters where spelling is important.)   2. Try to write a whole passage first, then edit. Don't struggle over each word as it comes up.   3. If the spelling of a word is asked for, give it, and circle it so that you can go back to it later in discussion. Don't interrupt the flow of meaning.   4. Don't ask your learner to copy words or passages unless you have explained the reason why. Do you know why? If they are rehearsing it as they copy it, it will make more sense.   5. Put a relevant spelling word on a card. Rehearse it. Turn the card over. Practice it.   6. Trace over a spelling word with your finger or pencil. This reinforces the visual memory task involved in spelling.   7. Break words into syllables. Long words tend to be threatening.   8. Mnemonics - a trick to remember a hard spelling word. (In February we say brr.)   9. Fill in gaps and have the learner learn each letter in a word. (--bruary, ---ruary, ----uary, etc.)   10. Play crossword and Scrabble games.   11. Don't begin by talking about consonants and vowels. Slowly introduce these concepts if you feel it is necessary.   12. After writing a story, tick all the words the learner feels sure he has spelled correctly. See if you can get the learner to identify the parts of the words he is not sure of.   13. Pay attention to the kinds of mistakes the learner makes.   SPELLING RULES 1. When a word has only one vowel between two consonants, the vowel usually says its short sound.   eg. rat, him   2. A silent e on the end of a word makes the vowel before it long. eg. not - short o becomes - note - long   3. Usually when two vowels come together, the first is long and the second is silent.   eg. rain - long a and silent i   4. When c comes before a, o or u it usually says its hard sound. The hard sound of c sounds like k. eg. cat, cot, cup When c comes before e, i or y it usually says its soft sound. The soft sound of c sounds like s.   eg. cent, city, dice   5. When g comes before a, o or u it usually says its hard sound.   eg. gate, gold, gum When g comes before e, i or y it usually says its soft sound.   eg. gem, giant, gym   6. Forming plurals:   A) Add s to most words.   eg. bird + s = birds   B) Add es if the word ends in sh, ch, ss, s, x or z.   eg. dish + es = dishes   C) If a word ends in a consonant followed by y, change y to i and add es.   eg. baby + i + es = babies   D) A number of nouns ending in long o add es for the plural. Learn this entire list.   buffaloes, embargoes, tomatoes, calicoes , heroes , torpedoes , cargoes,, mosquitoes , vetoes , desperadoes ,mottoes , viragoes , dominoes, Negroes, volcanoes, echoes , potatoes.   *NOTE: The following forms are also acceptable; mottos, Negros, torpedos and vetos. A few nouns ending in long o, add only an s. Remember them by groups.   Music - altos, sopranos, contraltos, pianos and solos.   Circular Appearance - dynamos, cameos and silos.   E) Compound nouns add s or es to only the principal word to form the plural.   eg. In the in-law series, the principal word is son, brother etc. brothers-in-law   F) Certain nouns ending in f or fe form the plural by changing f to v and adding s or es.   i) nouns changing final f or fe to v and adding s or es for plural:   Common Nouns   calf calves; elf elves;,knife knives; leaf leaves;life lives; loaf loaves;thief thieves;wife wives;wolf wolves   ii) Nouns ending in f and adding only s for plural:   -ief   belief beliefs; brief briefs;chief chiefs; grief griefs;  -oof   hoof hoofs (rarely hooves); proof proofs;roof roofs;  -rf   dwarf dwarfs; scarf scarfs (or scarves); turf turfs;wharf wharfs (or wharves)   7. The ie-ei Rule:   Write ei   (1) after c, as in ceiling   (2) when the letters sound like long a, as in neighbour   (3) before the letters gh, as in eight   (4) between the letters f and t, as in forfeit   Write ie   (1) in most other words   (2) even after c: :when c sounds like sh, as in efficient :in words with the long i sound after c, as in society and science   8. Adding suffixes:   A) When a one-syllable word ends in one vowel and one consonant, that consonant is doubled before a suffix beginning with a vowel.   eg. hit + er = hitter   hit + ing = hitting   B) A word of more than one syllable ending in a single vowel and a single consonant, which has the accent on the final syllable, doubles that consonant before a suffix beginning with a vowel. Remember the accent must be on the last syllable.   eg. occur + ing = occurring   If the final syllable has no accent, there will be no doubling of the consonant. Thus, benefit will not double the t because the accent is on the first syllable.   eg. benefit + ing = benefiting   C) When a word ends in e, drop the final e before a suffix beginning with a vowel.   eg. large + er = larger   love + able = lovable   come + ing = coming   (Suffixes beginning with a vowel: -able, -ed, -er, -est, -ity, -ence, -ance, -ing, -ous)   * Verbs ending in oe (canoe) retain the e to preserve the pronunciation.   eg. canoe + ing = canoeing   D) The final e is retained when the suffix begins with a consonant.   eg. amuse + ment = amusement   (Suffixes beginning with a consonant: -ness, -ment, -ful, -less)   E) Some words retain the final e regardless of the suffix in order to retain pronunciation.   i) When the word ends in double ee, the final e is not dropped.   eg. agree, agreeable, agreement.   ii) Words ending in -ce or -ge will retain the final e before a suffix beginning with a vowel.   eg. notice, noticeable change, changeable   iii) Words ending in -oe retain the final e.   eg. canoe, canoeing   F) Certain words would lose their hard pronunciation of certain consonants unless a k is added before a suffix beginning with e, i or y.   eg. panic + ing = panicking   G) The final y preceded by a vowel remains y when suffixes are added.   eg. annoy + ing = annoying buy + er = buyer   H) When a consonant precedes the final y, the y changes to i when suffixes are added.   eg. enemy + es = enemies beauty + ful = beautiful   *There is only one case in which the y is retained. This is before -ing.   eg. carry + ing = carrying   9. Syllabication:   A) The Vowel/Consonant - Consonant/Vowel Pattern: When two consonants come together between two vowels, the first syllable usually ends after the first consonant.   eg. car/ton yel/low   VC/CV VC/CV   * A consonant blend or a consonant digraph is considered as one consonant when dividing a word into syllables.   eg. pit/cher   VC/C V   B) The Long Vowel/Consonant - Vowel Pattern: When only one consonant separates two vowel sounds, and the first vowel sound is long, the first syllable ends after the long vowel sound.   eg. na/ture be/low   V/CV V/CV   * A vowel sound is not the same as a vowel. In the word doughnut for example, -ough is considered one vowel sound.   eg. dough/nut   V /CV   C) The Short Vowel - Consonant/Vowel Pattern: When only one consonant separates two vowel sounds, and the first vowel is short, the first syllable ends after the consonant.   eg. pan/ic hab/it   VC/V VC/V   D) When a root word has a prefix or a suffix, the word is divided after the prefix or before the suffix.   eg. un/lock hand/ful   E) If a word ends in -le and a consonant comes before -le, divide the word before the consonant.   e.g. cas/tle hand/ful  F) In a compound word, divide between the words that make up the compound word.   eg. flash/light   10. When using seed, ceed, sede and cede:   A) When to use seed - seed linseed   B) When to use ceed - proceed exceed succeed   C) When to use sede - supersede   D) All other words are spelled cede.   http://www.hpl.ca/local/literacy/spelling.shtml

      There was once a family of four skunks. A mother skunk, a father skunk and two identical twin skunks named Inskunk and Outskunk. their parents named them as such because the only way to tell one fom the other was to keep inskunk inside all the time and Outskunk outside continually except at meal time. When being fed, Inskunk would be inside to eat and when done inskunk would go outside and Outskunk would come in to eat. After eating Outskunk would go back outside and Inskunk would come back in. They followed this ritual daily to avoid confusion. One day mother skunk had to go into town and left father skunk to look after the twins. As she was leaving she reminded him not to mix up the two because the last time it took them a week to sort it out. Father skunk replied, "it is alright dear. I can tell them apart. So Off she went. When lunch time came father skunk let Outskunk in to eat without letting Inskunk outside. Mother came home to see this happen, I cannot believe you let this happen!" "They are mixed up!!" Father skunk replied, "the are not mixed up. This is Inskunk and over here is Outskunk, It is simple. Instincts!!

      Bad Example One day two very loving parents got into a huge fight, the man called the women a "bitch" and the women called the man a "bastard".  Their son walked in and said "What does bitch and bastard mean?" and the parents replied "ladies and gentlemen".  The next day the parents decided to have sex, the women said "feel my titties" and the man said "feel my dick".  Their son walked in and asked "What does titties and dick mean?" and the parents replied "hats and coats".  On Thanksgiving the dad was shaving and he cut himself, "Shit" he said, the kid came in and asked "What's that mean" and the man said it was the brand shaving cream he was using.  Down stairs the mom was preparing the turkey, and she cut herself, "Fuck" she said. Once again the kid asked "What's that mean" the mom said that is what she calls stuffing the turkey.  Then the door bell rang. The kid answered the door to his relatives and said "Alright you bitches and bastards, put your dicks and titties in the closet, my dad is upstairs wiping the shit off his face, and my mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey!? http://www.thebartend.com/
