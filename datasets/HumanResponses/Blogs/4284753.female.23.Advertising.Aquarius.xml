      I've now created a second blog for my own private thoughts.

      I am getting a massage today. Hopefully my neck will be fixed :)  I bought 3 books at Barnes and Noble yesterday.  I don't know why I do that when I still have 2 unfinished books sitting around, one at the office and one by my bed.  These ones are  different  though...  I'll read them from start to finish.  Actually I don't remember the last book I read cover-to-cover.   Hmmmm?  Even Moneyball, which was the last book I read and totally got into, I skimmed.  ADD is a bitch.  I think that's why I prefer reading magazines.  I was really surprised (in a good way) to hear from Sean again.   I have the house to myself for 4 days.  Love it.  I have been banned or screwed up my account on ebay.  This is probably a good thing.  Good for my credit card in any case.   I need to start looking for a new apartment.  Very excited to move to a new neighborhood.  :)

      I missed kickboxing for the third time because the Exotic Erotic Ball client would not get off the phone.  The man is on crack.  I know I say that about a lot of people, but he seriously is.   If I get fat.  I am blaming him.

      Rose and I at Fluid 7/31. Drunk enough that we don't remember being photographed (it was the Party Trolley night). Not the most flattering pic ever, but the place is kinda B&T so we'll be OK.  We're on the second page about two thirds of the way srolling down the page.  Kinda of a pain to find.   urlLink http://www.phatcatphoto.com/events/

      I feel better.  This weekend was actually pretty fun, other than my massive all-day hangover yesterday. Since when do I get hungover? I must be getting old. It was worth it though.  Friday night we went to dinner at Le Colonial.  I think the bill for 5 of us was around $600 with tip.  I dig the place, dig the food, unfortunately it reminds me of Rex Murphy and the Ruby Skye night.  At least now I can erase that memory with this new one.  Thanks Rose and Kyocera for picking up the tab.  :)  After a few bottles of wine, we made our way over to the 1yr Anniversary of Suite one8one.  Drank, danced, met some hot pro wakeboarders, got home at 6 am... All in all, it was a good night, but we payed the price the next day.  Last night we ordered takeout and then met up with some of Rose's friends from college at the triangle.  There were actually some pretty cute guys out.  Maybe Marina bars aren't so bad?  On a side note... I've done quite a bit of damage on the Visa card the past few days. I'm not sure if it's the 'breakup' mode setting in or the fact that Rose and I realized we've watched over 8 hours worth of Sex and the City in the past few days. The more I watch, the more I buy. I think those girls give me a wardrobe inferiority complex.  Anyway, I got two new pairs of great heels with a purse to match, a hot little red number from BCBG (seriously... it would be wrong to pass up 75% off a $200 "do me now" dress), 3 new Michael Stars shirts, some new makeup at Sephora, overpriced but smells ohsogood lotion from Bare Escentuals, some jewelery, and last but not least that cute little ethnic looking skirt form the boutique down the street that FINALLY went on sale. I still need to shop for fall clothes but that can wait until after labor day. Yay...more shopping :)

      I meant that on a few levels. I told Johnny yesterday that his blog was dangerous, that reading it had made me question our relationship, etc. It did. Not just what he wrote but what he didn't write. Or what he wrote and kept private on there. That was the worst. At the same time though, I didn't really want to know. After the first time we broke up and before we got back together (if we were ever really back together), he asked if I wanted the password to read all those entries. I decided I would prefer not to know...but damn, those entry titles can make you wonder.  I should really figure out how I can write some of the censored or 'private' entries. Mwahahhaha.  I still dont' know why I'm starting one of these. I'm not really the 'blog type'. My dorky friends will dig it because they know it's SO not me. Plus, it'll force me to be honest with myself about s**t. I currently prefer living in denial in my own little dillusional world that a few exboyfriends have referred to as LolaLand.  I'm trying though...  Oh, and it's a great reason to procrastinate at work. IM was starting to get a little stale.
