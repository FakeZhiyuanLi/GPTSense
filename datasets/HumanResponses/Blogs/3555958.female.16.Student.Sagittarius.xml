      pot is currently my new obsession, been saving money to buy the dvds gosh they're about $89 for part one and i thnik there are at least 5 parts for the anime , just saw the screen caps for the chibi episodes and hahahhahahaha they're sooooo cute and funny too, and come on how many anime out there specially have chibi episodes??? so far i onli noe one. fav characters in the anime are tezuka, fuji and kaido( i noe ppl dun really lyk kaido but hey i lyk characters with attitude problem, not that i have one though)actually i prefer ppl with attitude problem than ppl who act cute, those ppl are just way too annoying, they annoy the hell out of me. anyways back to the topic, many ppl told me to download the episodes than to buy them, but i'm just a coward, i'm afraid of getting caught coz pot has already been lisciensed so it becomes illegal to do so heheh i got a thing for not breaking the law, it was inbred in me, whats more is that having dvds are more acessable in a way , more enjoyable and i wouldnt get sore eyes from staring at the computer screen for too long. the only thing is that its so heart breaking to part with my money and sooner maybe after 3 years or so i would regret buying them. ha, i juz predicted my future. anyway i am now listening to diana degarmo version of i believe, hearing her sing that song makes me wanna tear up dunnoe y though and yeah i'm over the fact that she lost haiz, so sad for her, but i'm gonna get her single and album when it comes out. and yeah fantasia does not bug me anymore grown to like her.okay i havent eaten breakfast and lunch and its already 5.20, gotta grab some food so see ya

      hmmm,i'm a fanatic when it comes to anime and i've been havin big problems finding the type of anime i wanna watch, here the vcds shops are hopeless when it comes to anime, most of them sell onli kiddie anime, except for a couple of shops where they sell imported ones which are really expensive as they are available in dvds plus they tend to charge more than the region price. anyway if you're fairly new to  anime here are some titles you might wanna watch 1)gensoumaden saiyuki 2)fruits basket 3)vandread 4)samurai x 5)rave 6)ayashi no ceres 7)now and then, here and there 8)fushigi yuggi 9)ranma1/2 currently wanting to own 1)prince of tennis 2) wolf's rain 3) darker descendant

      crap, today was supposed to be a good day as i did manage to get prince of tennis vcd box 2 and reload saiyuki vcds, but i forgot all about my post test which i was supposed to take online and the due date was today by 5pm and by the time i realised it i was alreadi 12.30 am the next day. ohhhhh i am so gonna die coz that counts for 70% which they might use for my semestral exam, and i'm gonna get a freakin ZERO. so much so for having motivation to study, now i'm completely in depression mode, ate alot to make me feel better. today i watched the match btween seigaku and fudomine. and kamio looks alot like sangi frm one piece hehe.i aso watched reload which was sort of disappointing, esp the opening and ending song, wad crap are they playing, it doesnt even sound like their singing, more lyk screaming and having constipation at the same time, the story arc is about the same as gensoumaden saiyuki, so ya, its like a repition, but me being a saiyuki fan couldnt care less as long as i get to see hakkai and besides, their filler plots are highly amusing but the story does not seem to be getting anywhere though, oh well i shall end here and wallow up in my misery and thinking how to convert that ZERO into something
