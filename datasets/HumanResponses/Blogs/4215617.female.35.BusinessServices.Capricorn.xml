						   Lucid dreams are the best. I experience them frequently.  I set my alarm to go off at 6:15am, and I'm usually hitting the snooze until around 7:30am.  Those 9-minute intervals drop me from one lucid experience to the next. Although I have done some reading on lucid dreams, I don't specifically try do anything to bring them on.  The same goes for the out-of-body experiences that I have had.  They are not as common for me as the lucid dreams, but they still occasionally happen.  I had many of them as a child.  Finding myself out in the yard in the middle of the night or floaty/bouncing down the fire escape 6 steps at a time. What's so strange, is that I have been able to retain such vivid memories of both types of experiences for years and years.   As your typical 35 year old hetero/bi-curious woman, I have my share of famous people that I wouldn't mind, well, you know, "wink, wink, nudge, nudging and all that." What's really astounding to me is that these various people tend to pop up while I am lucid dreaming, and what happens in these dreams is often really strange.  It's never just a "wham, bam, thank you Ma'am" kind of thing, nor is it a romantic jaunt.  It's a deeper feeling of  knowing  the other person involved.  Like we're both plugged into the same virtual reality machine at the same time.  I don't know how else to describe it.  Like I  know  that I am never going to have a deep meaningful relationship with Ben Affleck, and chances are that I will never even meet him, but it's so odd to experience these weird dreams. There must be other people that have similar experiences. I could easily see if there was someone who didn't have all of their screws tightened, that they might even think that there IS some kind of real connection between the other unknown person and themselves.  Maybe that's how stalkers come to be. I don't know.

						   After my third recent trip to Los Angeles/So Cal I find it remarkable as to how much of that area is constantly being used for filming.  Everyone I know is so sick and tired of hearing me exclaim, "I've been there!" every time I see a familiar locale on TV.  Having grown up in Pennsylvania and having never ventured farther than the Jersey Shore for most of my life, my first trip to the left coast in 2001 has left an indelible stamp on my brain that I just can't seem to get enough of.   One of my favorite hobbies has always been watching movies and television.  I remember watching shows like Quincy & Columbo when I was growing up thinking how beautiful California looked and how I wished that I could live there.   When I was about 16, I had bought a book from the bargain bin called "The Hip Pocket Guide to Los Angeles."  I must have read that book from cover to cover about 900 times. I memorized all of the cool places that I wished that I could go to if I ever made it out there. Since I didn't actually make it out there until I was 32 and married, my trips to LA have been slightly different that I had initially imagined.
