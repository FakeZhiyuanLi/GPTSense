      ahaha.. thats how id describe today. imagine being late even when you woke up 1 1/2hours before the exam starts. :D   then came the auditions. they say laughter is  contagious, but no one ever told me about nervousness being as contagious as SARs. Sitting down fondling with the keyboard. Rhadji had to push everybody around and do something. anything. it was very obvious he was nervous. then came my turn. i swear i felt as if i needed to visit the toilet just 0.24125 seconds before we were up. but shafi beat me to the toilet.   oh i must say, spending bombs on a baby grand piano and not looking after it is as good as getting a digital piano/clavinova. the heater is not even swtiched on, this after spending "lots of money"(or so ive been told) to repair the once broken power chord. so what i got was a crapload from the piano. but. nevertheless, i swear we were good. haha. one might say thats because they didnt hear what i was playing. which is quite good actually, considering i made tons of double notes and mis-cue-ing haha. though i think mr NG heard..    ever heard of the stretch of road from tampines JC(A) all the way to the very 1st bus stop in pasir ris(B)? yea? id say its ard 1km?1.5? yea what ever. now imagine being stuck in a bus for 45mins from A to B. 45F**king mins. (when calculated, it'll be 2km/h.which is very very slow. a lame(lame as in legless. not lame as in heikal lame) person would obviously be so much faster) little mister gahmen(or so being known as the Government, then again, its the LTA for this instance) had to "straighten" the stretch of road just inside pasir ris, and slow down traffic.  i duly sympathise with whichever poor soul who was in a taxi at the same time and at the same place. imagine being stuck with a bill of $25 when a normal taxi ride would have cost no less than $4. and walking from one stop to the next was soooo much faster. but it was a very nice and pleasurable longest bus ride on the shortest road ive ever had. :D

      C5. thats what i got. and for me. its not really an achievement. but. i passed. so thats the main thing. i didnt really work for it. so i dont really have the feeling that i reaped what i sow/ed.  some of them got B4's and above were crying.not for joy. whats up with that? there were people who got F9 and D7 and they were holding it pretty strongly. they must be thinking the world is against them. haha.   enuff with that. the other day when i stepped into MPH. my eyes zeroed in on the latest Tony Parsons book. it was big. it was plush. i had to get it. next to it. some book with white cover. read the synopsis thingy at the back. i had to get it. total price for both? 60++. haha. now thats why i loove my parents. ATMs some of them are. bought over 70bloody$ worth of books. but with the disc and vouchers. it shrunk to 56$. wow to that. i spent in 4 days as much as i would have spent in 3 months. wow to that. now im hooked to Family Way(tony parsons) and SkinnyDip(nothing dirty about it.except for the storyline.get it?)  someone wrote on my SkinnyDip. im gonna hate whoever wrote it.

      tired myself silly today. good day nontheless. i'll have to start all over again here at blogspot/blogger since i cant be bothered to figure out what went wrong with the ebloggy/eblogger site i had.   anyway. the jam session today was. pretty fantabulous. i just need to remember when NOT to come in and sing off cue, irritates me even. but the preparation for the auditions on saturday went quite alright, though i think rhadji is trying a tad too hard to reach the hard notes. damn those high pitched rockers. wait. hoobastank. oh nvm.  haha. the gimmick of attracting and holding the audiences on SI was still there. but there was sooo much more positivities than the 1st episode. pretty interesting next episode shld be. oh heck. every episode will be interestingly haha.   coolness.   \\ photos of yest.   Look at those veins. they appear each time rhadji lands his hands on the bass.    Shuffy   Fuad   all together now.
