      "Well I know it wasn't you who held me down/Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free/So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains/And we never even know we have the key"

      Shakespeare  in his poem "Seven Ages of man" vividly expresses the changes in looks ,also beautifully shows the change of the mental makeup of a man over time .Read it and u Wonder, whats the transition which makes the "the lover ,.. with a woeful ballad Made  to his mistress' eyebrow" , in to a  ,"a soldier ,Full of strange oaths, ..,Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in  quarrel ". These after all are two different men here . A lover singing a ballad is not the person who would "Seek the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth" and definitely "a quick in quarrel soldier" could not become a man "With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws, and modern instances".   But we all know that it happens, men do take different roles in life and live on .We change.    Not just the individual transition but also the people around you. How many of u have met a long lost friend? And half way through the conversation u realize, you are different; they are different .How many of u would have gone to a class reunion with nostalgia and returned with amazement of how people change.  In all this change the most disturbing and the disconcerting one should be the transitions the ones very close to you go through right before your eyes .when a close friends ,spouse ,parent , sibling change  by the circumstances  , a  metamorphosis right in front of your  eyes ,taking a new role ;sometimes for better ;sometime for worse ,to cope up with their changes in life.   There u see in all clarity life taking its toll, a person u know, care and love becoming someone else, taking up a role, a new mind set with new props, acting their new part. Look at it and remember it my friend for, that; is growing old. see them  tossing away that silly stubborn belief , growing wiser and some times also loosing  what u saw as the very best in them,giving up their most deep rooted beliefs ,renouncing the most passionate of passions ,   just so that , well...life can go on .Makes u wonder how much of a prisoner we are of circumstances , choices and the people around you .how much are we loosing of what we were and what we wanna be ? To be what we are now ...    Its a joy when a old poem gives a  new meaning , it reminds me how much I have changed , ney aged ,while the words remained the same  .Here is one I reread after a long time ,which at one point talked of death to me  ,but now to me it talks of life and aging . Strange, cant wait to see what it would mean to me a few years down the lane.  Jeya Pradeep Sakkaravarthi    Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night    Do not go gentle into that good night.  Old age should burn and rave at close of day.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  Because their words had forked no lightning they  Do not go gentle into that good night.   Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  Do not go gentle into that good night.   Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   And you, my father, there on the sad height,  Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  Do not go gentle into that good night.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   Dylan Thomas
