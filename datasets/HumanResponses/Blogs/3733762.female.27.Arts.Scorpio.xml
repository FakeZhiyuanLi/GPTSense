						    Zaizai brings Xu Wei Lun back home to visit father    Source : SingTao   After Vic Zhou and Xu Wei Lun Vic Zhou and Xu Wei Lun worked together to flim Love Storm, they were good friends, and many rumours flying around of them being in love. Yesterday, someone said that they had secretly been together for a month. In fact, the both of them have been together for half a year, during the lunar chinese new year, she even accompanied Zaizai back to Yilan to visit his father.  Xu Wei Lun, who's the girlfriend of taiwan singer, Lee Wei, both of them have been together but never openly said about it. Each of them were playing around, Xu Wei Lun was being said as friendly, be with guys for leisure. Last year when fliming Love Storm, she automatically asked both lead male actors, Ken Chu and Vic Zhou out to sing karaok. However, whenever they went out together, the media would know. However, this makes people suspect whether is someone making all these up to pull themselves further up. Vivian Hsu who is in the show of Love Storm, hinted that someone was doing that and it pointed towards Xu Wei Lun.  After that, in order to prevent rumours, Ken furthered himself from Xu Wei Lun, it was only Zaizai who continued to go out with her, relationship getting more and more close. During the lunar new year, XWL requested to go back to Yilan with Zaizai, and they started dating. Management company did not stop them, but told them to keep it low-profiled.  Past few days, Xu Wei Lun released her pictorial book and she openly said, "I'm no longer together with Lee Wei." In the end, she became headlines, and her relationship with Zaizai deepened , no wonder she's mistaken for being the one who brings rumours.  Towards this rumour, Zaizai have been used to it, " It's not the first time, there isn't a need to reply to this, normal friends having dinner is normal." During the mid of the month, Zaizai would be going to Shanghai to be Jolin's concert guest. After which, he would be doing promo with Da S for their new show, Mars. Zaizai laughed and said he don't mind Jolin and Da S working with him, with no reason, they might be his next new girlfriend.   Thaaks to Xiujuan - http://onlyf4.proboards4.com  Makes you wonder which story is true, and which isn't... hehehe

						   Kahapon, binalitaan ako ng kaibigan ko na may nag post sa viczhoufamily ng isang radio interview ni Zaizai/Vic. Ang sabi daw nya na may non-showbiz girlfriend na daw si Zaizai at ayaw ata sabihin nung nag post kung sino yung babae kaya nagkandaugaga ang mga members ng vzf.  Ako, matagal ko nang nababalitaan yung kay Zaizai pero ano naman ba pakialam ko kung mag girlfriend nga sha o wala? Oo, crush ko sha, oo, gusting-gusto ko sha pero may magagawa ba ako? Wala. Taga hanga lang naman kasi ako. Hindi ko naman kasi inaasam na magpunta dito si Zaizai at sabihin nyang mahal nya ako, diba?  Hindi ko maintindihan bakit yung iba, umiyak, dahil nasaktan daw sila dahil may girlfriend si Zaizai. Hello?!? Ok lang ba sila? Reality check…Asian superstar sha, tayo, well, fans. What are the chances na maging girfriend ni Zaizai ang isang Filipino fan? Malabo. Malabo talaga. Ummm… kay Kristine Hermosa lang ata nangyari yun eh. Diba magpapakasal na sila ni Michael Buble sa Canada pagkatapos ng kanyang teleserya?   Anyway, balik sa usapan kay Zaizai. Ako, manghihinayang lang kung, una, si Zaizai ay may BOYFRIEND, ibig sabihin bading sha, o pangalawa kung ikakasal na sila ng kanyang girlfriend o kung mamatay sha (knock on wood), pero until walang prueba na may girlfriend nga sha ...wala lang, at kung meron nga talaga eh di maging happy na lang ako para sa kanya. Every person has a right to be happy. At bakit kelangan malaman pa ang panglan ng girl? Ano, pag nakilala ba nila, hu-huntingin nila at sasakalin? Namaaan, be realistic! At isa pa, tao si Zaizai, binata, shempre normal na ma-inlove sha kaya hayaan na lang natin sha lumigaya. Oks?  Pasensha na at karamihan ng enrty ko nasa ingles, mas kumportable kasi ako mag sulat sa ingles eh.  I am hApPy 4 zAizAi ü

He is one who would let the girl feel loved and he treats the girl with a lot of love. But Zaizai seems confused, and at the same time, he is curious about a lot of things. Because of being afraid to try, afraid to face failure, when making decisions, Zaizai seems to be having conflicts within himself, even his girlfriend is also one like that. He prefers girls who are intelligent, witty, but also at times act blur a sensitive girlfriend. She could look like any girl. But being soft towrds Zaizai is the most important!

      A hug is a wonderful gift to share, A way to show each other that we care; There is so much a hug is able to do, When you feel those arms holding you.  A hug is a place to feel safe and warm, A comfort for a sad heart that is torn; An expression of the love in our heart, For ones who we wish, never to be apart.  A hug is a greeting when we meet to say hello, Or to say goodbye when we have to go; It can hold us up when life gets us down, And makes us smile, instead of frown.  A hug can be given for no reason at all, And given to those, both big and small; We're never too old to feel the joy it brings, As it is one of life's most pleasing things.  And for all of this beauty, a hug is free! It costs nothing, yet means so much to me; We should all hug another to show we care, For to feel a warm hug, nothing can compare.  Here's Your Hug from ME to YOU Just because...  I am who I say I am and I am AfFecTiOnaTe ü

      one wonders what biatch (bee-ya-ch) means when you hear it for the first time. it's simple, really. just take out the "a" and you'll see what it means. see?   it's just like saying maniacal (man-i-ak-al) - "manyak". it sounds better but it has the same meaning and concept.   eveyone, man, woman, young, old, gay, straight or bi has some level of biatchness in them. some are good at handling that state of feeling but others can be downright rude.   honestly i wasn't one before. i actually was a very kind person. i was patient and very loving. but then without reason, life slapped me against everything i cherished and loved in my life, losing everything, rendering me lifeless, i became one.  (drama, you say? oh but you don't know me so just keep you comments to yourself and keep on reading, but if you don't feel like continuing, then read someone else's blog, i don't really care.)   being a teenager is tough. i know. been there, done that. but what's really hard is for young adults who think that they're ready to conquer the world, equipped with their knowledge, their experiences, their guts only to find out that they've been duped. no job availabe. no money. no love. nothing.   when reality bites, it bites back strong and hard. it kicks you so hard that you fall to the ground gasping for air leaving bruises on your already crushed ego. but hey, that's life. you learn to stand up and brush the dirt from your pants, take a deep breath and start all over. and everytime you fall and start over, you learn from your mistakes, you become smarter and stronger.   as for me, not only did i become stronger, i became a biatch who sees life as a blank page of a story book, my story book. i live life by the day as i try to fill the blank pages with new experiences, new stories, lessons, new beginnings and endings.   i say who i say i am ... i'm proud to be a BiaTch ü

      I’m not a big fan of junk food. As a child we were not allowed to eat them. In fact, I was already 10 years old when I first ate a bag Chippy and Cheese Curls on my own. We were told that it contained a lot of salt, fats, preservatives, coloring, etc… and was harmful to our health and that eating too much can lead to liver failure, diabetes and all sorts of illnesses.   But, of course, from time to I ate junk food. Among my favorites were Kirei, Oishi shrimp, Chippy (bbq), Cheese Curls and Granny Goose Tortillas (bbq). As I got older, the array of junk food grew, so did my favorites: V-cut (bbq flavor), Mr. Chips, Nova, and even the smelly Humpy Dumpy.   Just barely two weeks ago, my sister discovered a new junk food. It’s called “Pillows”. It’s chocolate wafer shaped like pillows, and inside each wafer was chocolate. If you’re a fan of Loakers (not sure of the spelling), this is the nearest imitation of it. But loakers is still the best. However, pillows cost only 5 pesos here in our sari-sari store and I’m sure it costs much less if you were to buy it in a grocery.   I have to admit, I’m addicted to “pillows”. I just can’t get enough of it. It’s not too sweet and not too “chocolaty”.  If it were really up to me I’d eat it ALL THE TIME, but I can’t because I’m trying to lose weight. Hehe.   If you have no problem with eating junk food and not really concerned if you gain a few extra pounds, I say, go eat a lot of pillows, it’s worth it.   I am who I say I am and I am CrazY aBouT PilLoWs

      What makes American Idol winner, Fantasia Barrino a better singer than runner-up, Diana de Garmo?  Fantasia: Though when she speaks , she sounds like Daffy Duck, when she sings, she tells the story of the song. Fantasia has a very soulful voice and even when she belches out her songs, she still keeps the emotion intact. I suppose that’s because when Fantasia sings, she sings with experience. What I mean is that in her 19 years of existence, she has moved mountains and crossed the seas of life. She has experienced life at its most difficult circumstances, while Diana’s life was served in a silver platter.   Quoting Simon Cowel on Diana’s earlier performance, “Diana, what have you experienced at 16?, what seas have you crossed? You’re too young.” Of course he was referring to Fantasia, who, at 19, is a single mother raising a 3 year old girl. She barely gets by because her family is underprivileged. Diana on the other hand is extremely rich, her house, almost a mansion and only two of them live there, her mom and Diana.   Diana: At 17, Diana has very strong vocals. She can sustain a high note for a very, very, very time and never have to catch her breath. It’s amazing, really. Diana, always smiling, very chipper and looks at life positively.  She has got some set of pipes. She reminds me of Christina Aguilera. But when Christina rose to stardom, she wasn’t only a 16 year old who can belch out a song, she was able put emotion in her songs. Again, that came with experience. Brought up by her mom, Christina, at the early age of 9, has experienced her fair share of defeat when she lost in Star Search and again when The Mickey Mouse Club was disbanded. Enough of Christina, let’s go back to Diana.   As I was saying, Diana still needs to grow up and learn how to control her voice, put some emotions in her songs and have her fair share of setbacks. In time, she will prove to be a better singer than she is today.     I am who I say I am and I am A CriTic ü

      Why worry?  There are only two things to worry about.  Either you are well or sick. If you are well, then there is nothing to worry about. But if you are sick, then there are only two things to worry about. Whether you will get well or die. If you get well, then there is nothing to worry about. But if you die, then there are only two things to worry about. Whether you go to heaven or hell. If you go to heaven, then there is nothing to worry about. And if you go to hell, you’ll be busy shaking hands with old friends you won’t have to worry. So, why worry?    I am who I say I am aNd i'M nOt wOrRiEd... nAh-aH ü

      Should women who had surgery performed on them be allowed to compete in beauty contests? Why do good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good ones? Why me? Should a girl ask a guy out if she likes him? Do you believe that there are no coincidences just fate and destiny? Have you lived a full life? Would you fall for a smart handicap or a dumb, sexy bombshell? What is it with men and breasts? Didn’t they feed on them when you were still babies? Why is it that more men have dimples than women?  Who invented the alphabet? Why are actors getting involved in politics? Will we ever find a cure for Alzheimer’s ? Have you fallen in love with the wrong person? How many times a day you wish you were somewhere else doing something else rather than being where you are and doing what you’re doing? Have you ever wondered why you’re reading this? How many misspelled words are there in this entry? Do you eat when you’re depressed or cry? Do you hate anybody? Would you love someone who doesn’t love you? Have you ever attempted suicide? Did you ever wish you could go back in time and mend your mistakes? Do you live in regret and guilt? Do you want special powers like freezing time, fly or move things with your mind? What would you do if you found $1,000,000? What’s your dream? Don’t you wish you could read other peoples mind? Are you genuinely happy? What other language would you like to learn? Who’s your hero? Are you  an angry person? What would you do today if you found out that you’d be dead tomorrow? Are you in love right now? Who do you always pray for?

      i have been having bad luck since the week started. i applied for a job as graphics artist in a big company. i was called for an exam. i almost didn't make it because my driver left without saying where he was going or when he was coming back or if he still intended to come back.  i just cried and cried until there were no more tears coming out of my eyes. although my sister offered to drive me, my spirits were crushed. i could not concentrate on my exam and i'm very sure i flunked it.  i really don't know why my drivers keep on leaving me. i mean, i'm kind, i talk to them, be-friend them, treat them as equals and  yet none of my 4 drivers ever stayed.  was i being too polite or kind that they can't stand being with me all day? should i treat them as subordinate, maybe they'll listen and fear me? But if i do that, it wouldn't e me. I’m not bossy nor bitchy because I only get bitchy when provoked and my drivers are all kind so there’s really no reason to get mad. Their salary is more than enough and they get bonuses from time to time. They even get packed lunch and snacks so they wouldn’t have to buy food.   They applied for the job description of DRIVER and that’s what they do literally. They drive for me when I go to therapy. In between my therapy sessions, they have free time to watch TV or sleep if they want in an air conditioned waiting room.  I really don’t see anything wrong with how my family and me treat them, we even say “thank you” everytime they drive for us.  Yes, I get it —I’m unlucky with drivers. :(  I say what I say I am ... right now I’m UpsEt.

      i used to be Proverbs when I first took the test. my friend said that Proverbs meant 'WISE". Nyarks! i'm anything but wise. honestly I wanted to be Lamentations,(my other friend got that book), anyway, because I really felt i'm Lamentations. I re-took the test and ended up being Psalms. it's close but not quite. it's closer than being Proverbs. I can be Psalms.

      Studio 23 showed the 5th season of The Amazing Race via satellite yesterday. The race was so exciting and the contestants were really a mix of contestants from previous seasons. Two seasons ago, there were Derek and Drew, models and twins. This time there’s also a pair of dumb blonde twins. As usual there are married couples like Chip and Kim, a father-daughter tandem (last time, a father-son tandem), there’s also a “Flo” character in this season.   Remember Flo, the biatch? The one who had a boyfriend named Zach but towards the middle of the show flirted and dumped Zach for the dumber twin, Drew? Flo won the million dollars and got herself a new boyfriend.    This time there’s a former Miss Teen USA and a fluent speaking spanish midget. Let’s see if they’ll make the show much more interesting to watch.  The Philippines is on the map of AR this time. I think on the 11th pit stop will be at t the Coconut Palace and the 12th pit stop will be in El Nido, Palawan. Home to our finest beaches.  	So far, the race has been very exciting. I’ve spotted teams who are bright and those who aren’t so bright, those who really work as a team and those who don’t, teams who’re competitive in a good way and those who aren’t, teams who’re arrogant and not.  	We’ll see…   I am who I say I am and I am eXciTed! ü

      "Two people who should never have married in the first place, or, at least, should never have married each other.  Most of you will build satisfactory marriages. Many of you will build very happy marriages. For the few of you who might not do either, the following warning signs might well indicate whether you should have second thoughts. We call them the fourteen "ifs".  1. You may be very deeply in love, but if you have known each other for less than 3 months, professionals say it is doubtful that you have been acquainted long enough to really know the person you plan to marry. Better give yourselves and the relationship more time.   2. If your fiancé has been really drunk or used drugs 3 times in the past 3 weeks or about 10 times in the past 3-4 months, he or she may have a problem that requires professional help. No marriage should begin if one partner is clearly unstable, troubled, and in need of professional help.   3. If your fiancé makes statements like, "I owe a great deal to mother. It's my duty to make her happy," and if such statements are coupled with behavior that makes it apparent that he or she will do almost anything to ensure parental approval ... you should consider how close a relationship with in-laws a healthy marriage can sustain.   4. If you fiancé says things like, "I can't live without you; my life has no meaning apart from you; if I ever lost you I would kill myself," and if such statements are joined to very obvious dependent behavior, this partner may bring nothing to the relationship beyond deep draining needs. Being needed so desperately may flatter the ego for a while, but if that's all there is, the relationship may become dull and draining. Counseling is indicated before considering marriage.   5.	If you have developed a pattern of quarreling with, disappointing, seriously irritating, or hurting each other during the majority of times that you have been together in the last 3 months, perhaps you are trying subconsciously to tell each other something. Think about it. Marriage will not erase this type of discontent.   6. If many of the significant, mature people in your life - parents, relatives, teachers and especially good friends who love you - indicate that you may be making a mistake, you should take pause. People rarely comment on another's decision in this day and age. If they muster the courage (in words or otherwise) to tell you that they are troubled, weigh their opinions or non-verbal reactions.   7. If some very serious problem has occurred in the past few weeks, and if it is definitely troubling you, and if you have not had an opportunity to work it through, then either confront the problem or think about postponing the wedding.   8. If your financial situation is uncertain and there appears to be no means of correcting it in the near future, don't pass it off because "we're in love". Statistics show that financial problems are a significant factor in the dissolution of at least 40% of all marriages. Although money does not buy happiness, lack of money can cause a great deal of stress and unhappiness.   9. If all your friends are marrying and you feel pressured to do the same, don't! You can sustain any amount of societal or peer pressure to avoid an unhappy life.   10. If you feel that having become sexually involved commits you to marrying each other despite serious problems in your relationship, don't! A good marriage is predicated on maturity and responsibility, not on sexual involvement which may not be founded on love.   11. If both of you are 18 years of age or under, your potential for divorce is 3.5 times greater than that of people who are 21 years of age and over.   12. If you are marrying because you just have to get out of the house, you will ultimately hurt only yourself if marriage is merely a means of asserting your freedom or "getting back" at your parents for past hurts. Moving out of the house might be very appropriate, but should marriage be the excuse or the way?   13.	If you are a pregnant couple (it does take two), then slow down, think, talk, ponder, and pray. Neither pregnancy itself nor the fear of any social stigma that pregnancy might cause are good reasons to marry. Ask yourselves whether you would really marry one another if there was no pregnancy.   14. If your backgrounds or cultures or religious beliefs differ so greatly that strong differences of opinion about important matters have already occurred, the difficulties will more than likely increase when you marry. Further, if one partner consistently compromises and the other never does, resentment might eventually build up on both sides. You should be able to meet one another at least half way.   NOTE: No one can predict that your marriage will fail or succeed, and none of these warning signs spells absolute disaster. The risk that you take is part of the adventure of marriage. But, if you decide to take that risk, you must first consider the odds. Are they in your favor? If not, you might be taking a far greater risk than you should.  Please do not panic, bury your head in the sand, or hit the road. But, do think it over and talk it over. Make certain that you are acting responsibly in that your decision to marry is made with good judgment. You might want to ask advice from a qualified, unbiased person, such as a priest, minister, or married person.  Although marriage is a wonderful state, it is also a life-long task that should be given careful consideration before a lasting decision is made or binding action taken. You owe it to one another to be honest about your feelings and intentions.  I am who I say I am and I am dOn't HaVe pLanS oF gEtTinG MaRriEd - yEt ü

      Julia Roberts celebrated her 1st year wedding last July 4 and for Julia Roberts, that’s a feat.   I love Julia, truly I do. She is one of my favorite actresses in Hollywood but her reputation of unable to keep relationship commitments precedes her when she first left Keifer Sutherland at the altar and her first marriage to Lyle Lovett, which lasted only a year long ended up in a divorce. So when she and hubby Danny Modor got married secretly in Julia’s home last year, July 4th, many eyebrows were raised.   But when Julia announced that she was pregnant with twins, many said that maybe she had overcome her fear of commitment. Having kids in a marriage usually sends the message that this is for keeps, after all, she had to undergo a series of tests so she could get pregnant. I guess she heard her biological clock ticking ever so loudly that she decided to settle down. Good for you, Julia, good for you.  Well, as a fan, I’m always happy for my icon’s happiness. I wish her well. I really hope that they grow old together. It would break my heart if they get divorced. Go Julia!   I am who I say I am and I am A fAn ü

              Kahapon, binalitaan ako ng kaibigan ko na may nag post sa viczhoufamily ng isang radio interview ni Zaizai/Vic. Ang sabi daw nya na may non-showbiz girlfriend na daw si Zaizai at  ayaw ata sabihin nung nag post kung sino yung babae kaya nagkandaugaga ang mga members ng vzf.     Ako, matagal ko nang nababalitaan yung kay Zaizai pero ano naman ba pakialam ko kung mag girlfriend nga sha o wala? Oo, crush ko sha, oo, gusting-gusto ko sha pero may magagawa ba ako? Wala. Taga hanga lang naman kasi ako. Hindi ko naman kasi inaasam na magpunta dito si Zaizai at sabihin nyang mahal nya ako, diba?      Hindi ko maintindihan bakit yung iba, umiyak, dahil nasaktan daw sila dahil may girlfriend si Zaizai. Hello?!? Ok lang ba sila? Reality check…Asian superstar sha, tayo, well, fans. What are the chances na maging girfriend ni Zaizai ang isang Filipino fan? Malabo. Malabo talaga. Ummm… kay Kristine Hermosa lang ata nangyari yun eh. Diba magpapakasal na sila ni Michael Buble sa Canada pagkatapos ng kanyang teleserya?      Anyway, balik sa usapan kay Zaizai. Ako, manghihinayang lang kung, una, si Zaizai ay may BOYFRIEND, ibig sabihin bading sha, o pangalawa kung ikakasal na sila ng kanyang girlfriend o kung mamatay sha (knock on wood), pero until walang prueba na may girlfriend nga sha ...wala lang, at kung meron nga talaga eh di maging happy na lang ako para sa kanya. Every person has a right to be happy. At bakit kelangan malaman pa ang panglan ng girl? Ano, pag nakilala ba nila, hu-huntingin nila at sasakalin? Namaaan, be realistic!  At isa pa, tao si Zaizai, binata, shempre normal na ma-inlove sha kaya hayaan na lang natin sha lumigaya. Oks?     Pasensha na at karamihan ng enrty ko nasa ingles, mas kumportable kasi ako mag sulat sa ingles eh.   I am who I say I am and I am hApPy 4 zAizAi ü

           I love Harry Potter ever since I read the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I’ve been a fan and at that time the only person I could talk to about Harry Potter was my friend Delle because no one else was familiar with the book. Every time we’d see each other, we discussed the book. We even thought that it would make a great movie with all the magic, platform and 3 quarters, quidditch…and so on. So when news broke out that Harry Potter was going to be made into a movie, we jumped with joy (no, not really), but we were pretty excited.  After a few weeks or so, Harry Potter became the talk of the town especially when everyone found out who was playing who. Daniel Radcliffe, a really cute boy was to play the part of Harry Potter. Emma Watson, would be Hermione Granger, the smartest witch her age and Rupert Grint, would be playing the red head, Ronald Weasly. I was awed when I found out who the other actors were. The late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as professor Snape and Robie Coltrane as Reubeus Hagrid. Such a heavy cast for such a juvenile movie. It was a great cast and they really matched the characters in the book.   I was impressed at how Chris Columbus, the director of the 1st two Harry Potter movies  and his staff was able to tell the story well. I was a little apprehensive on the 3rd movie, though because I knew how the book was. It was dark, complicated and expected nothing less than heavy drama and action. In book 3 there was Sirius Black, played by Gary Oldman, a wanted criminal on the lose. There were dementors, evil suckers of life, the patronus, a strong spell to fight off the dementors and a new Albus Dumbledore, not to mention, a new director, Alfonso Cuaron, whose movies includes Y Tu Mama Tambien. The book itself was very detailed and very long. I had no idea how the writers will fit every important detail in a 2-hour movie.   Finally when I saw the movie, I was confused. I wasn’t exactly happy how it turned out. Don’t get me wrong, I loved the new castle, the new hut of Hagrid, wardrobe, cinematography, the characters, but I found that the script lacked the important details. First of, they should’ve explained more about the dementors, how foul they really were and why people in the wizarding world was so afraid of them. Second, they should’ve shown more quidditch, particularly the one where Draco Malfoy were struck by Harry’s patronus. In connection with that, they should’ve shown how hard Harry had to practice to get his patronus perfected. They also should’ve explained how the Marauder’s map came to be, and who Wormtail, Prongs, Moony and Padfoot were. Why were James Potter, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew came to be animaguses. How Crookshanks helped stop the Whomping Willow stop whomping instead of the daring act Hermione and Harry had to do to get underground into the Whomping Willow. It obviously was impossible. Also, they should’ve explained why Harry’s patronus was in the figure of a stag. These were just some of the more important details that the writing crew included.   But I have to commend them for the wonderful cinematography. It’s the best among the 3 Harry Potter movies I’ve seen. Buckbeat, the hippogriff was nicely done, also the effect of the time turner. Moreover, I like the  new Albus Dumbledore. He is exactly like the Albus Dumbledore in the book. He knows when to be really serious but be funny at the same time.  Honestly, I don’t really mind sitting through a 3-hour movie if all the significant details were included in the movie. I watched Titanic 5 times and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Nonetheless, I think it’s a good movie kids and grown ups will enjoy, so go catch it.       I am who I say I am and I am A hArRy PoTteR fAn ü

      I’m a movie buff and I watch the movies that interest me whenever I get a chance. These are my top 10 must see movies for the first half of the year. I have listed them in no particular order.  1.	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of  Azkaban -	Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint -	Synopsis: book 3 of the series by J. K. Rowling, this movie appeals to children age 13 and up. It is not like the first 2 movies or books by Rowling. The story is darker and the characters much more grown up. The cinematography is amazing, the best I’ve seen so far if I compare it to the first 2 Harry Potter movies.   2.	Mona Lisa Smile -	Julia Roberts, Julia Stiles, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal -	Synopsis: for the first time, women were allowed in the workforce of America. A free-spirited and liberal teacher challenges the teachings of a traditional school with young women who would sacrifice their dreams for marriage. She dared them to either conform or be themselves. She  also tired to inspire her students face up to the status quo.  3.	50 First Dates -	Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore -	Synopsis: a woman loses her short-term memory because of a near death accident. A man who falls in love with her does all he can to make her remember. If this isn’t true love, I don’t know what is.  4.	Love Actually -	Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightly, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy, Rowan Atkinson and many more -	Everywhere you look, love is causing chaos. Love in different forms surpasses temptation,  social status, family tragedy, puppy love, and even language barrier. It’s love, in reality.  5.	Big Fish -	 Ewan Mc Gregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange -	A man tells the story of his life until he becomes the story. A story, which was passed on from one generation to another, making the man immortal.  6.	The Prince and Me -	Julia Stiles, Luke Embly -	If you believe in Prince Charming and happily ever after, this is the movie to watch.   7.	The Cat In The Hat -	Mike Myers, Dakota Fanning, Spencer Beslin, Alec Baldwin, Kelly Preston -	An adaptation of Dr. Seuss’ Cat in the Hat classic. Full of color and life and adventure that tickles the imagination and brings out your inner child.   8.	Something’s Gotta Give -	Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Amanda Peet -	Is it possible to find true love when  you’re already in your 50’s? Will he, a philandering man who goes out with women old enough to be his daughter? Wills she? A frigid, well-known play write who wears turtleneck in the middle of summer?  9.	Shrek 2 -	the voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Dame Julie Andrews, Nathan Lane -	Usually when movies have sequels, the sequel sucks, but not in this case. This is an exception to the rule. But it’s not really for kids because the anecdotes and punch lines are complex.  10.	Spiderman 2 -	Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst -	A great sequel. Better CGI, better story. Simply the best!  I am who I say I am and I am A mOvIe bUfF ü

                I’m a huge, huge fan of Charmed, so when they decided to kill Cole, I was really disappointed. I guess the writers did not know how they could turn the ex-demon to a good man suitable for Phoebe. At the same time they had to give way to the growing powers of the Charmed ones. So what now? What happens next?  Good thing I didn’t wait too long for Cole’s replacement. And I wasn’t let down.         Tall, brown hair, green eyes kaso mejo bopek (hehe), and much more good-looking than Cole. His name is Chris, the Charmed one’s new white lighter who came from the future (Leo was made an Elder). Why? What’s the deal? At first I didn’t know what plans he had for Piper, Phoebe and Paige because most of the time he gets them in trouble and he has a lot of demonic connections. Plus the fact that he’s so secretive about the future, he places the three in harms way. He ends up telling lies and going behind their backs, but there were quite a few times that he saved the three.         A lot has been revealed in Chris’ character. His agenda of keeping the three up and running, chasing demons all over town was discovered when his tongue slipped. Apparently he came from the future to protect Wyatt from turning evil. Then Phoebe discovered his identity as Piper’s second son. Eventually both Piper and Leo find out the truth about Chris’ identity and purpose.         Now we know who Chris is, let’s get to know the guy who plays him…        Born in Los Angeles, California on May 19, 1980, Drew Fuller was discovered by an agent when he was 12 years old after a family friend put him on the cover of UCLA magazine. After deciding to wait a few years, Fuller entered the modeling world at age 16 and quickly became a top model for such prestigious companies as Tommy Hilfiger, Prada and Club Med. His good looks helped him make the transition to commercials easily and he booked numerous commercials including J. Crew, Subway, Toyota and Pepsi opposite Britney Spears.         Fuller can be seen later this year playing real-life criminal Rod Farrell in Vampire Clan. He plays the drug-crazed killer who claimed he was a vampire and brutally murdered an innocent family in Florida in 1996. His next film, The One, just won the audience award at The Sundance Film Festival. Other film credits include Angels Don't Sleep Here and Close Call. Before joining the cast of "Charmed", Fuller was a cast member of the short-lived WB series "Black Sash".      In his spare time, Fuller enjoys playing basketball, surfing, rock climbing, snowboarding and tennis. He currently resides in Los Angeles with his cat "The Chad."    Charmed Life   Source: Teen Vogue Magazine Article By: Lauren Waterman Transcribed By: Drew Fuller Fan.com Date: December/January 2004  Introducing Drew Fuller: former model, future star, and now a beguiling new IT boy for the WB.     At 17, Drew Fuller thought he had it all figured out. "I decided I would be a model first," he explains, "get a feel for the industry, and then start acting." As the picture to the right attests, posing was no problem for the green-eyed--- and, let's face it, drop-dead gorgeous--- California boy. But when he left the runways of Paris and New York to head home to Hollywood, Drew quickly found that half of L.A. had the same big idea as he did. "Everyone here is an ex-model trying to become a model turned actor," he reports with a laugh. Not that the setback stopped him for long. After doing a few indie horror flicks and a short, accident-packed stint on the canceled WB action series Black Sash, Drew, now 23, has found a home on Charmed. As Chris, a puckish guardian angel from the future (don't ask--- even Drew's not quite sure how it works), he showcases his own considerable charm to great effect. "I don't know if it's my big break yet," he says humbly, but Drew does have at least a few fans as a result of his work. The first time he was stopped, outside a men's restroom at a San Francisco restaurant, it was by a guy who'd heard the actor singing happily to himself. "I thought I'd offend him", Drew says, "and when I realized he knew me, I was more nervous than he was. But it was really cool--- I was beaming."    Filmography as:   Actor   1.

           My Sassy Girl is a movie based on a series of real-life incidents published on the Internet.   Kyun Woo (Cha Tae Hyun) is a kind-hearted but at times naïve college student who seems to keep getting into trouble. On his way home one night, he encounters a beautiful but completely smashed young woman (Jeon Ji Hyun) who causes a scene in the subway, calls him "honey," and then passes out. With the eyes of the other subway passengers upon him, he has little choice but to take responsibility for her. Thus begins his relationship with the at-times charming, at-times violent damsel who steals his heart.    I am who I say I am and I am A SucKeR 4 tHis fLiCk ü

           Everyday I wake up at 6 and the first thing I do even before I wash my face is turn on the radio to Rx 93.1, where I listen to The Morning Rush, hosted by Chico and Delamar (CnD). Chico a.k.a. baby whale or Chicomar and Delle a.k.a Dellibear and the woman who likes the “hotter brother” and the fan of “mega”, the reluctant diva.   This dynamic duo started a phenomenon that changed FM radio permanently. Many tried to copy their tandem, their unique partnership but not one could even get close to being as interesting, funny and smart. I’ve learned so many things just by listening to them. Lessons in music, movies, love and life in general. I make it a point to really listen to what they have to say about anything. I hang on to their every word and try to apply them in my life.   Chico and Delle designed their radio format wherein listeners can actually take part in the show. They have the infamous Top 10. Everyday they give different topics and the listener’s text in their entries. The 10 most interesting, funny, sleazy, thought-provoking, entries make it to the list. Before they also had portions such as the “Out of Nowhere”, they play good songs that were not popularized. The “Like a Version”, wherein they play 2 different versions of 1 song. They also had the “What if” segment where the listeners can call in and answer the “What if” question. (Example: what if you were given $1,000,000, what would you do?) Something like that. They also used to watch a movie or 2 every weekend and critique the movie/s during the show. Listeners were allowed to have their say on the movies as well. Their radio show is the most interactive act in the history of FM.   Chico and Delle have 2 albums and a TV show “Rebyu” under their belts. Yes, they are not only DJ’s and TV hosts but recording artists as well. Their 1st album was “Talk about Love”, released in 1999. It’s not the typical music album because it has what we call “Talkies”, clips taken from previous shows where they talk about love and relationships. Their 2nd album aptly titled “Friends for life” was launched in 2000. Again, the “Talkies” include discussions about friends and friendship. (Check the links or Rushers Online and Chico and Delamar, to get info on the albums an TV show). Their TV show, however, did not last long. I’m sorry but I forgot how the show went.   Those who listen to CnD are called Rushers. Rushers come from all walks of life. We are single, married, separated, widowed, gay, straight, bi, young, old, students, employed, unemployed, rich, middle class, poor, sleazy, witty, funny, smart, and some known actors, actresses, singers, song-writers, producers, just about anybody. Most of us know each other by name or as friends.   Two rushers, Cherry and Cat created their own websites for Chico and Delle. If you want to check them out, just click on the links on the left side bar of my blog. Cherry also made a yahoo group for the rushers where every member can post just about anything they want say or just try to make friends with the others. Our oldest member, as far as I know, is V51. V51 started tuning in to the Morning Rush after his wife died. He was 45 years old then. V stands for viudo (widowed) and 45 is his age. He is the only rusher who changes codenames every year. He knows how to speak English but he refuses to do so on air. He always speaks in Filipino. I got to meet him once in a tea party, and he’s such a cool guy, especially at his age. This morning, he joined the call in top 10, since it’s a Saturday. The topic was if anybody could audition for radio idol, this was their chance to prove themselves worthy. V51 called and spoke in perfect English but admitted after that it was scripted. He’s so funny.  Their partnership started in 1995. I have been a listener since. I’ve watched them grow to the unique individuals they are today. What makes them formidable is their friendship. They’ve become the best of friends over the years even if they started out as enemies (Hard to believe). Several times envious persons tried to put them down but they always emerge victorious and more passionate with their work. I had the chance to actually meet and talk to them. They’re just 2 normal, shy beings who really love what they’re doing. They share their happiness, sadness, disappointments, and triumphs with their listeners, us Rushers, and by that our relationship intertwine with one another.   They are my early dose of laughter and source of enrichment. They always make my day complete.   I am who I say I am and I am PrOuD tO bE a rUshEr ü

               Jeon Ji-hyun is my favorite Korean actress to date. Born October 10, 1981, this young lady started her career as a commercial model. Soon after, she started acting in Korean TV series. Now, Ji-Hyun is concentrating in her acting career. She has the most angelic face I’ve ever seen. Flawless white skin, high-bridged nose, long brown hair, full lips, not so chinky eyes, tall-slim figure, long legs, long, slim fingers, beautiful – just stunning, almost perfect, and she CAN act.  Once, my friend, Meadow, brought over her DVD of the movie “My Sassy Girl”, which we watched and ended up in tears because of laughter. Even now that I am writing this, I can’t help grinning because I still remember how funny the movie was. Ji-Hyun’s acting is so natural that you can relate to her character easily.   “My Sassy Girl” is a romantic-comedy about destiny and fate. It’s written brilliantly and all the actors were very good in their performances. The movie was so exceptional that there was a rumor that it was going to be adapted in English and be made into a Hollywood movie, but the rumor died as quickly as it started. It’s alright because I think if it would be made into an English movie, the story and the characters may be butchered, the essence, ruined.   Anyway, going back, Ji-hyun has three movies under her belt. Actually, she only has three movies to date because she just started acting in movies back in 1999 where she did her first ever film, “White Valentine”, “Il Mare” in 2000 and “My Sassy Girl” in 2001.  Today, Meads and I watched “Il Mare”, a drama. The story is like the movie “Frequency” with Dennis Quaid and (I forgot the name of the lead actor), but the story is again about love, destiny and fate. I don’t want to give out the details because if any of you plan to watch “Il Mare”, it will take out the fun in watching it.   I’m searching for the DVD of “White Valentine”. I have no idea what the movie is about. I don’t know if it’s a drama or a romantic comedy or a tragedy, one thing’s for sure though, it will be about love, destiny and fate. Koreans seem to lean towards that angle.  I do know, though, that I will end up liking this film, as I am, like many Koreans, a sucker for destiny, love and fate.  By the way, “Il Mare” means Always.  A little piece of trivia, “Always” in Japanese is Itsumo, like the song.  I am who I say I am and I am A fAn oF Ji-hyün ü

                Si O’Relly nakilala ko nung lumipat kami dito sa Antipolo. Nagkasama kami for a while dahil sa ex ko, magka barkada kasi sila.Lagi yan nag pa-practice sa bahay nila at magaling na talaga shang tumugtog ng drums. Madalas pa nga’y ka-jamming pa niya ang ibang kaibigang marunong tumugtog ng kahit anong instrumento. Walang pinipiling tao, mabait, masiyahin, joker, magaling mag basketball, always smiling, madaling pakisamahan, super sweet, vertically challenged at kalbo. Ok sha kaya madami shang friends. ü        Si Reggie naman, ang mas nakababatang kapatid ni Relly, ay sobrang tahimik, hindi mashadong kumikibo kaya hindi mo akalaing sobrang galing mag gitara. Minsan sa simbahan, tumutugtog sha pag hindi nakakarating ang gitarista ng choir. Ngingiti-ngiti lang yan pag natutuwa, pero may angking talentong tinatago na ngayo’y maipagmamalaki sa lahat.         Sa pagkakaalam ko, ang magkapatid na Relly at Reggie ang bumuo ng Stonefree kasama ang mga kaibigan nilang si Benson at Miro (my-roh). Si Relly graduate ng conservatory of music sa UP diliman majoring in percussion, Regie ay isang ComSci graduate, si Benson, Economics at si Miro naman Mass Communications. Mga henyo! Kaya hindi kagulatgulat na maganda ang kanilang musika.    Alam niyo ba kung saan galing ang pangalan nila? Sa isang kanta ni Jimmy Hendrix na Stonefree ang title. Ganda noh? Ang galing. Akmang-akma sa apat na musikero.       Nung sumali sila sa band break out ng Monster radio Rx 93.1. nag runner-up lang sila pero malakas ang dating nila sa mga listeners. Yung kanilang 1st hit, Baka Naman, ay naging paborito ng madami, instant hit para sa Stonefree. Pero nung linabas nila ang kantang Listen, nabilang sila sa isa sa mga kilalang banda sa Pilipinas. Ang awit na Listen ang naging no. 1 OPM song nuong 2003 sa Rx.  Naalala ko pa nung una kong marinig ang Listen sa radyo, kinilabutan ako. Ang ganda ng lyrics, ang ganda ng music at ang ganda ng boses ni Miro. Grabe. Isa ito sa mga paborito kong kanta na galing sa isang OPM talent.         Nasali din sila sa SINGLE compilation album na nag feature ng mga rising local bands dito sa Pinas. Ang Baka Naman, Listen at acoustic version ng Listen ay nakasama sa SINGLE album. Pero bukas, July 23, 2004, I la-launch nila ang kanilang 1st EP sa Freedom bar. (at last!)         Bakit hindi ako nagulat na Stonefree made it this big? Siguro kasi dati pa man alam ko na they will make a mark in the music industry. Kasi they make good music, with beautiful lyrics. At alam ko, after tomorrow, their lives will forever be changed. Isa na silang certified Rockstar. But unlike other Rockstars, I know that they’ll still be the same persons I knew before they were even known as Stonefree.         Congrats to Stonefree! And a job well done to Soki, their manager, if it were not for your ingenious handling of the band, who knows where they could’ve ended.    Applause, applause! Job well done. I am truly happy for all of you and wish you guys all the best.       Sali na at makijoin sa stonefreaks@yahoogroups.com I am who I say I am and I am PsYcHed! ü

          CSI FIRES TWO INVESTIGATORS Actors Let Go Due to Salary Demand Dateline: Friday, July 16, 2004 By: Patrick Sauriol News Editor  Source: The Hollywood Reporter, Associated Press, Variety  CSI cast members Jorja Fox and George Eads have been axed from the  top rated television show due to higher salary.  Both were in the  fifth year of the seven contracts and were about to start filming  the first episode of the show's new season when they were dismissed  for breach of contract.  Different news sources are issuing  conflicting reports as to how the dismissal went down, and whether  it was a move by CBS and the show's production partner, Alliance  Atlantis, because letters from the actors weren't received on time  from the actors stating that they would report to the set on time.   Both actors were seeking to increase their paychecks from the show,  and it is known that Eads reported to the set late yesterday.  A  short time afterward Eads received a letter stating that his  services would no longer be required on CSI.  A similar situation happened last year involving cast members of  another hit CBS show, EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND. In the case of  RAYMOND's actors, the actors were given a raise; with the CSI  situation, Fox and Eads were fired.  The show is now looking to hire two new actors to fill the empty  slots, although it remains unclear whether the new blood will play  the same or different CSI characters.

         On three separate occasions, three of my friends made this remark… “Oh, bakit naka condom ang cell phone mo?”     I bought a plastic jacket for my phone to protect it from getting scratched, dirty and wet. We have kids at home and they play with my phone. My cousins also use it for games, so I decided to buy that protective jacket. Apparently my phone looks as if it was wrapped in a condom. Geez! The ideas people get. Anyway, I looked at it. It doesn’t look like as if my phone’s in a condom.     My brother agrees with me. He said it doesn’t look like my cel’s “wearing” a condom. Can you just imagine if it does? And to think the jacket has a zipper.   I am who I say I am and I HaVe nOthIng eLsE tO sAy ü

             "Il Mare," directed by Lee Hyun-seung, is an award-winning Korean melodrama about a very subtle yet tender love; at times it reminds you of the Japanese "Love Letter." Incidentally, the original Korean name of this movie, "Si Wall Ae," means "love across time."  One day, the Sung-hyon (Lee Jeong-Jae), living in 1997, receives a letter from the Un-ju (Jeong Ji-Hyeon) who lives in the world two years ahead. The two begin their communication across time and gradually, they fall for each other. Would the two meet at a point of time and be happy ever after? Or are they simply passers-by in each other's lives?   I am who I say I am and I am A kOreN mOviE fAnaTic ü

      Lahat na ata ng movies ngayon may trilogy eh. Either ang sequence nila may prequel or sequel basta tatlo. Nag umpisa to sa Star Wars tapos many, many years after George Lucas again made the prequel to Star Wars with Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones tapos meron pang isang on the works daw. Actually hindi ko alam kung sa Star Wars talaga nag umpisa kasi may The Godfather, Karate Kid, Terminator (hindi talaga sha mamatay matay kahit na hindi sha hi-tech at ang mga kalaban nya super advanced), tapos akala ko hindi na matatapos ang Rocky at Die Hard, Mission Imposssible,  alam ko madami pa pero hindi ko na maalala yung iba. Ngayon mayroon ng The Bourne Supremacy, which is the sequel to The Bourne Identity. Mayroon kayang The Bourne Trilogy? Then there’s Spiderman, The Matrix, The Ring, The Grudge, Asia’s set of trilogies. The Lord of The Rings which came from the three books of Tolkien, pero siguro ang maypinaka mahabang movie ay Harry Potter kasi seven books yun eh.   Hindi lang sa movies ang may trilogy, pati na rin sa TV commercials, katulad ng Max. at Talk n Text ni Heart. Counted ba yung different ads ng hit na hit na Coke commercial? “Ito ang beat sabay-sabay”…maniwala ka o hindi, everyone in our family knows how to do the beat kahit mali-mali. Minsan nga nag lunch kami sa tita ko, during dessert, nag laro kami ng Coke beat sa round table. Ang ganda tingnan kasi pabilog ang mesa tapos sabay-sabay.   Anyway, back to our main topic. Trilogies. This seems to be a fad that won’t quickly go away because, one, the audience asks for more, two, more movies means more sales and when there’s more ticket sales, it means more money for moviemakers, so why stop, right? Pero, do you think this fad will die down? I have no idea. Opinion ko lang, pag maganda ang pagkakagawa ng story, hindi na kailangan ng sequel or prequel.

        i read the book before i saw the movie. i loved the book although, for me, it lacked a certain, spark or imagination. fast paced kasi sha at hindi gaanong na describe yung ibang places like frell, the elf village, tapos kulang din ng explanation sa end ng book kung anong nangyari kay slannen and yung mga pottery na binigay nya kay ella and the relationship of ella and her father. do you get me?  anyway, sa movie naman, feeling ko nababoy yung book. sa umpisa pa lang ng movie, hindi na sha accurate. mandy, the fairy godmother was supposed to look like cinderella's fairy godmother, but nooo, she was sexy and pretty (minnie driver). mandy didn't use big magic in the house kasi it's a "fairy rule" pero sa movie, she used magic all the time. tapos may mga song and dance pa silang nalalaman.   supposed to be kasi, ella and her father, sir peter, don't get along kasi he married her mother for her wealth tapos lagi pa shang wala sa bahay kasi merchant sha, eh sa movie, lagi nag hu-hug yung mag ama tapos sa end nung nawala si ella, super worried sha kay ella. and prince charmont, char for short, as in, charming, wanted to be a great king, in the movie, it was the opposite.  the book told about centaurs, gnomes, elves, dwarves, giants, ogres and everything else enchanting. the movie delved a little on some but left out the key characters.   i could go on and on about the book and the movie but the more i discuss it, the more i get disappointed. it's such a good book but sadly Hollywood turned it into a circus. it wouldn't hurt to stick with the story like Harry Potter and LOTR. nawala kasi yung essence ng book.

        TALABA, ASPARAGUS AT IBA PA    hindi ko na maaalala kung saan ko unang namalayan ang salitang aphrodisiac. hula ko natutunan ko to sa aking kaibigan na si I. simula ng magka-boypren sya ng isang PMAer (na ngayon ay kanya ng asawa) bigla na lang lumawak ang kanyang bokabularyo.  minsan pa tinanong ako ni I kung ano daw ba at saan ang aking erogenous zone.   "ha! ano yon?," tanong ko pa kay I. naalala ko, hindi nya ako sinagot. sinabi na lang ni I sa akin na ang mga kamay daw nya ang kanyang erogenous zone. "more of my palms, actually." yon lang ang tanging paliwanag na ibinagay nya sa akin.   ---  aphrodisiac. erogenous. siguro hango ito sa mga pangalang aphrodite at eros. si aphrodite sa greek mythology ang goddess of love, beauty and sexual rapture. beauty? baka nga ang ibig sabihin ng salitang aphrodisiac ay pampaganda. baka lang ha. si eros naman greek god of love and desire. hmm. magka-tropa pala 'tong si eros at mighty aphrodite.   sabagay may dictionary naman at mataas ang aking pride kaya't hindi ko na tinanong si I ulit o ang kanyang hunky PMAer boypren kung ano nga ba talaga ang ibig sabihin ng aphrodisiac at erogenous. hindi ako sanay na humihingi ng tulong. tinutulungan ko ang aking sarili sa mga ganitong pagkakataon.   ---  minsan nong binisita ako ni I, biniro ko sya. "libidinal pala ang aphrodisiac at erogenous noh?" tanong ko sa kanya. "huh! saan galing yan?" sumbat nya. sabi pa nya, mahilig daw ako sa off-topic. yong dramang tipong, i don't know where you're coming from. ganon daw ako. bigla na lang may maiisip na out of the loop. paano di ko kasi makakalimutan na naisahan nya ako sa vocabulary game. aphrodisiac lang at erogenous zone, hindi ko pa alam!   sabi ko kay I, "wala lang. natanong mo kasi sa akin mga five years ago kung alam ko ba yon, eh. i remember i didn't have a clue." natatawa na lang si I, "five years ago? masama pa rin loob mo?" dagdag pa nya, "teka, ano ba sabi ko?" seryoso ako habang tinitingnan ang aking kaibigan. paalala ko, "parang sinabi mo sa akin na your hand is your erogenous zone." tumawa si I. (nasabi ko bang meron na nga pala syang isang anak ngayon?) sabi nya, "sira ka talaga! niloloko mo ako."   tawa naman sya ng tawa.  ---  kung bakit ko naalala si I? paano nong isang araw, sa loob ng 24 oras, tatlong aphrodisiacs ang aking nakain. for lunch, i had beef with asparagus, or asparagus with beef (hindi ko alam kung may pagkaka-iba ba ang dalawa). for dinner, i had fresh oysters and i had a decadent dessert: strawberries with whipped cream.  asparagus! aphrodisiac? could the myth be true? inubos ko ang stalks of asparagus. bawat isa sa kanila na laman ng aking plato. di masyado yong beef. hindi ako mahilig sa meat. pagkaraan ng isang oras, wala naman akong namalayang pagkaka-iba. wala pa naman akong pagnanais na sunggaban ang unang lalaki na humarang sa aking daan. gusto ko lang namang batukan ng sampung beses ang isa kong kaibigan kase nagseselos ako. yon ba ang epekto ng asparagus bilang isang aphrodisiac?  ---  natapos ang araw. walang pagliliyab. walang umaapoy na kakaibang init sa aking katawan. wala akong naramdaman. mali siguro ang reputasyon ng asparagus. o, kulang pa siguro yong nakain ko. pero hindi, eh. inubos ko yong buong plato.   nong gabing yon, we had oysters and fish. talaba. ayoko pa nga syang kainin kase gabi na at laging binabanggit ng nanay ko sa akin na hindi karapat-dapat ang mga bata na kumain ng seafood kapag gabi. wag daw damihan. masama ata sa sikmura ng mga bata. (bata pa daw ako, sabi din nya.) lagi kong sinasabi sa kanya, walang kinikilalang oras ang aking katawan. kung nasa pilipinas ako, gabi din naman sa amerika. kahit saang sulok ng mundo, iluklok pa nya ako sa antartika, sa isang bahagi ng mundo, somewhere-- may araw na sumisikat.  kaya inubos ko yong isang bandehado ng talaba. kahit kadiri kase wala naman kaming white wine. cauvignon ba tawag don? subukan mong pagsabayin ang oysters with red wine (chardonnay nga ba? basta.), masusuka ka. kase wala na akong mapagpipilian, i drowned those oysters with a sangria. ang sagwa ng lasa.  ---  asparagus for lunch. oysters for dinner. double whammy. two of the top aphrodisiacs known to man. hiniritan ko pa ng strawberries with whipped cream for dessert. (kung bakit ito aphrodisiac? marahil dahil sa salitang whip.)   wala. nada. wala akong kakaibang naramdaman. walang pagnanais. walang pagnanasa. buo pa naman ang aking isipan na alagaan ang aking kapurian at makipagpatayan para lang ipagtanggol ito. hindi humihiyaw ang aking laman. ang laman-loob ko pa siguro kase naghalo na ang oysters, asparagus, strawberries at cream. kahit kaninong sikmura siguro susuko na.  in the name of mighty aphrodite, hinintay kong magpakitang-gilas ang mga ito. nanood ako ng tv. mas pinili ko pang panoorin yong isang palabas kung saan may barilan at muntik na silang magpatayan kesa don sa isang channel kung saan  love, unrequited love at forgiveness ang drama. ang babaduy nila! tinitigan ko pa ulit yong palabas kung saan may bakbakan. do'n pa ako natuwa.  ---  at no'ng gabing yon, bago ako matulog, mas pinili ko pang pakinggan ang cowboys from hell album ng pantera kesa don kay frank sinatra. pinahiram lang sa akin ng pinsan ko ang pantera cd nya. payo nya, i must be aware of and in tune to the different textures of music. maingay ang pantera. ang kanilang mga kanta? shattered. art of shredding. primal concrete sledge. kumpara mo kay sinatra: i only have eyes for you. just the way you look tonight. the shadow of your smile. tse!  pagkatapos ng ilang oras, i therefore conclude na si eros at si aphrodite ay nababagay lamang don sa mundo ng mytholohiya. kung ano mang kanais-nais na reputasyon meron ang asparagus, oyster at strawberries o whipped cream, para sa akin, t'yak na sirang-sira na ito. ---  may nagsabi nga pala sa akin na aphrodisiac din daw ang artichokes. sumbat ko sa kanya, hindi ko nga alam kung paano kakainin ang artichoke, eh. at wala akong balak. tanong sa akin minsan ni I, "ba't ka ba interesado sa aphrodisiac na yan?" nasabi ko sa kanyang wala lang. gusto ko lang malaman kung meron nga bang psychology of food at isa sa pinaka-kontrobersyal na aspeto nito ay ang tinatawag na mga aphrodisiacs. pagkatapos ko nasabi yon, tinigilan na ako ni I.  isang araw nalaman ko na lang buntis na sya sa kanyang pangalawang anak. inisip ko tuloy, the artichokes must have done it.  for a good read visit http://kuracha.blogdrive.com  I am who I say I am and I am tHankFul tO dReD ü

Without people like you others would be flying over the edge because, whether you know it or not you keep a steady beat to your life and will end up where you want to in the end. There is a sureness about you that is hard to match that draws people to you.

        a few weeks ago i met up with a friend. she was 5 months pregnant. we were really excited because it's hard for her to concive without having a miscarriage. a few days after we met, she texted me. she was rushed to the hospital because she bled. she lost her baby girl. this was her 3rd miscarriage. i felt so sad for her because i know how much she longed for her own child.  another friend called me up out of the blue. first few calls she asked how i was. next call she was asking for help. i don't turn down friends, even acquaintances for help. but this friend, i really want to turn her down, not help her because what she's doing is wrong.   it all started when she told me she was pregnant. of course i was happy because babies for married couples are a blessing. when i started to congratulate her, that's when she dropped the bomb on me - it's not her husband's baby rather her boyfriend's. she has been having an affair with her husband's kabarkada. and that's not all, she wants an abortion because she failed to have her husband sleep with her when she first found out she was with child.  i'm getting a headache just thinking about it. shit   i am against abortion. it's murder. you kill an innocent child whose only crime was to be conceived to 2 dim-witted human beings who only thinks only of the "easy way out" when they cause a problem.  she's 6 months pregnant today but her belly's very small because she's been starving herself. she told me that she had an ultrasound yesterday and the baby's a boy & that he's small for his age. duh! poor baby. he's probably starving. feeling unloved way before he's even born.   before even considering abortion, she took a lot of pills and drugs so that she'll miscarry.  (stupid! stupid! stupid!)  it didn't work, hence the abortion.   she and her boyfriend how she can get out of the house to get her check ups and abortion without rousing suspisions. that's when i entered the picture. she needed an alibi so she said that she was going to see a movie with me because we haven't seen each other for a long time. of course the husband said yes.   of course. shit.  she volunteered me. i wasn't given the chance to react or say "no, i don't want to be a part of this". basta she filled me in with her plans. that i should text her at this time and text this certain message to the husband. that day, i coudn't concentrate on my therapy session. i was anxious and nervous. what if the husband called to check on us and found out i wasn't with her. thank God, the battery on my cel died. i had an excuse not to text or answer any call. that night, she called me up and told me she wasn't able to complete the task because their money wasn't enough and she was required to stay overnight, which was impossible.   the week after, she called me again, begging to make up an excuse that will allow her to "spend the night" at my house. ayoko nga! i didn't want to be a part of this so i said i was sick and i won't be  going to therapy the whole week, but i wasn't sick. when she called i pretended to cough a lot. convinced, she stopped asking me for an overnight.  but i could only be "sick" for a week. i started thinking of excuses because i knew she'd ask again. and everytime i think of ways to excuse myself, i felt sick in the stomach.  when we talked about her plans i always ask her to reconsider. i wopuld always tell her that there's always an alternative solution for every problem just so she wouldn't have an abortion. i suggested that she leave home for a while and when it's time to give birth, let her baby be put up for adoption. ayaw nya, she can't part with her 2 kids for 3 months. but her mind's made up.   true enough, after my fake illness, she tried to set a date. she gave me instructions again. but that week, there was a storm, thank you storm dindo, because they couldn't push through with the plan. in fact i was stranded going home from the hospital and had to spend the night at my tita's place. for the first time in weeks i was able to sleep soundly because i had no burden on my shoulders that night.   the next day, i started worrying again, so much for the peaceful sleep.  sigh! i hate being placed in a situation like this. depressed, i cry at night and feel nauseous during the day. as much as possible i try to avoid her calls and i don't text back.   she was really very desperate that day she called me after the storm because she was crying. my heart went out to her but i just couldn't get myself to say "go, do it.", she needed my support but i couldn't give it to her. she asked me if i was mad at her. it took me time to answer. of course i was angry. i mean, i was at her wedding. i witnessed the exchange of vows. i couldn't comprehend what made her do such a thing. but more than being mad, i was sad. i see this happen in movies but i never imagined that it would happen to my friend and that i would find myself in the middle of it. but then again, there are so many couples who want to get pregnant but can't, like the friend i mentioned at the start of this entry. she's had 3 miscarriages and all she wants is one, ONE healthy baby which she can never have because of complications and this other friend is trying to get rid of the one she has in her belly. yes, i am angry and sad that it has come to this.  what to do? what to do? let her be? let her be. she's old enough, she knows the consequence. i'll let her do what she wants to do but i still won't say it. i'll cover for one last time. if everything goes as planned in the next 2 days then she's free of her problem but everything will just be starting for me. i will keep this to myself. the guilt of lying to her husband, her children, her parents, my friends & my family. i will forever bear the guilt of the death of an unborn child. even if i say that i tried to talk her out of it, i have conceded to her plans. i am involved indirectly. i let a child be killed.   can i ever forgive myself to agreeing to this plan? i could've said no the first time she approached me. i thought i could convince her to do otherwise. was i an irrespomsible friend? i could've tried harder to convince her not to do this. i can't reason that i've done everything in my power because i didn't. but then again, my responsibilty as a friend is drawn as a fine line. i can only do so much. it's still no excuse. i just hope this doesn't happen again. if it does i will end our friendship. i should've turned my back and be a bad friend but it's too late now, huh? i suck at being a friend.   she asked for my prayers. i don't think she deservs my prayer but then again she's my friend.    I am who I say I am and I am DisTreSsed :(

           kahapon nag meet kame ng mga kabarkada ko for dinner. nang imbita kasi yung isa naming kabarkada dahil sa 12 birthday nya, eh gusto nya early celebration so kahapon ginawa. kulang nga kame ng isa kasi birthday din ng papa nya kahapon, sayang nga eh kasi ang say-saya.  sinundo ako sa bahay mga 3 pm tapos dumiretso na kame sa Rockwell kung saan imi-meet namin yung birthday celebrant at yung 2 ko pang kabarkada. nung nag meet na kame at wala pa yung birthday girl, namili muna kame ng gift sa marks & spencer. bumili kami ng cologne na pwede for the body and linen. cool nga kasi hindi gaanong mahal tsaka mabango. ok na sha sa presyo, tutal hati-hati naman kami sa bayad kaya hindi mabigat sa bulsa.   pagkatapos namin mamili, nag kape muna kami sa seattle's best. masarap yung mocha. yun kasi ang inorder ko. dun lang kami nagpalipas oras hanggang 630. nagkwentuhan lang kami at nag kodakan dahil yung isa may camera phone at yung dalawa may dala talaga na camera. isang may 20 shots at yung isa, inuubos lang, mga 10+ shots pa siguro yun, pero hindi namin inubos sa seattle's best.   mga kwento ng barkada as a whole at individual. may tawanan, may "thought-provoking", pero madalas ang nagkekwento ay amingaming residente na duktor sa kanyang "pseudo" love life. tuwing sha ang nagkukwento, nakakatuwa. hindi mo aakalaing duktor sha na gumradweyt na magna cum laude sa UP dil na .001 na lang sana eh suma cum laude na sha. very animated kasi sha magkwento at ma-aksyon kaya nakakatuwa.   nung magtagal, dumating na ang birthday girl. nag order din sha, kumain at natural, nagkwento. yung kasing sapatos nya na colehaan na araw-araw nyang ginagamit for the past 3 years ay bumigay na. "it died on me" ang kanyang sinabi. nabali kasi yung swelas nya sa gitna. nung pumunta sha sa colehaan, wala na shang nahanap na ganung sapatos so, naghanap sha sa ibang shop. buti na lang nakakita sha ng sapatos halos kaparehas ng kanyang nasawing colehaan at 800 pesos lang. tuwang-tuwa sha.   matapos ang asaran, alaskahan, tawanan at kwentuhan, pumunta na kami sa bahay ng birthday girl. mga 7  na ata yun nang magumpisa kame kumain. ang putahe, adobong baboy, ginataang puso ng saging at red wine. weird noh? pero ang sarap ng kombinasyon. nag ko-kontrast kasi yung lasa ng adobo sa ginataan tapos na eenhance pa yung lasa ng red wine. grabe, na bondat kame talaga. halos pumutok na ang pantalon ko sa pagka busog. at wala pa ang dessert. naglabas sha ng lemon torte na binili sa sugar house at matatamis na mangga. ang sarap ng torte, ibang klase. maasim-asim sha dahil sa lemon pero matamis at napaka nutty ng luob. merengue pa ata yung pinaka "icing" nya kaya iba-iba ang texture sa dila. ang sarap.  pinagusapan namin yung mga sineng napanuod namin. ang cast ng Harry Potter, na si Raphe Fiennes (tama ba spelling) ang gaganap na Voldemort. kilig, kilig naman kame. at laking pasasalamat na lang namin na hindi si heart evangelista ang nakuhang Cho Chang kasi, hindi talaga bagay. sorry sa mga may gusto kay heart. eniwei, napag-usapan din namin ang mga tao sa friendster, kung sino ang kinasal na, anong trabaho, etc. napag kwentuhan din namin na kung sino man yung unang nag imbento ng mga live journals tulad nito, blogspot, live journal, blogdrive, tabulas at iba pa, ay may malaking isyu sa buhay. kaya nila ginawa itong mga ito para may "outlet" sila at may makikiramay sa kanila kahit hindi nila kilala. psycho-therapy? pwede.  ganun lang naman kame mag celebrate ng mga kaarawan namin. madalas sa bahay hapunan o tanghalian o merienda o lahat. kwentuhan, tawanan, nagdadamayan sa problema, parang psyco-therapy na din. simple lang. basta magkakasama kame ayos.  maaga kame umuwi dahil yung maghahatid sa amin pauwi ay masama na ang pakiramdam. baka kasi matuloy na sa lagnat o flu. pero bago kame umuwi, shempre nag picture-picture muna kame. inubos namin lahat ng shots sa dalawang camera, mga 35+ shots a siguro yun. matapos maubos ang film, tsaka lang kame nag paalam sa isa't-isa.   pagsakay sa kotse tuloy ang kwentuhan, asaran at tawanan. una akong inihatid. nagulat ang mga tao sa bahay bakit ang aga kong nakauwi. naisip ko, kahit maikli nga ang pagsasama namin kahapon, puno naman ng saya. parang bale wala sa akin na maaga ako nakauwi dahil nabusog ako sa kumpanya ng mga kaibigan ko. sabi nga nila "quality not quantity" at punong-puno ng "quality" ang samahan namin kahapon.  marahil nagtataka kayo bakit "binge & purge" ang titulo ng aking entry eh wala naman akong binaggit tungkol dito, kasi kahapon, ito ang "word of the day". "i will binge, can't wait to purge", etc...  ps. yung naka green na t-shirt at peace sign yung absent kahapon sa salo-salo. :P  I am who I say I am and I am tIred fRom wRitIng iN fIliPinO, hIraP pAg d sAnay ü

        in the Palmolive commercial, the girl said "ang straight laging 'in'", not true! napaka politically incorrect! paano na yung mga kulot tulad ko? ibig ba sabihin hindi ako 'in'? eh karamihan ng pinoy, kulot.  it gives the impression that people, especially women, are more beautiful if they've got straight hair. eh what about us curly beauies? ibig ba sabihin hindi kame maganda? excuse me?! no, no, no, hindi ako papayag. natural, love your own. be grateful with what you have. beauty radiates from within. beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. (eh paano kung crossed-eyed? hehe).   but of course, i cannot hide the fact that having straight hair is really 'in' right now just like a few years back, everyone wanted lighter, fairer skin (buti na lang i didn't have  that problem :p).   i can't deny the fact that i have curly hair (naman noh!) i also can't say that i don't like straight hair, because i do and i always wish that i got my hair from my mom. okay naman kasi ang kulot at some point pero more often than not it's not okay. i want to grow my hair long because i've always had the boy's cut or apple cut. i'd like to put ribbons, clips, head bands on it or braid it, etc... but i can't because it goes off in different directions, and the few times i grew my hair, naging buhaghag naman, it won't stay put, nakakainis. hassle.  buti na lang may hair relaxing and rebonding. kahit na twice a year for one month almost straight ang buhok ko. it can't be totally straight kasi kulot talaga so i settle for wavy, which is better than curly. but don't get me wrong, i love my hair, i do, it's kmy crowning glory but sometimes i need the feel to change hairstyles. with curly hair it's almost impossible to change do's, with wavy, it's workable.  sana lang advertisers would stop saying that people who have straight hair, fair skin or pearly whites are better looking than those who don't because it's not true. it's cliché to say that true beauty lies within, some would even say it's  b.s.   but it's the truth and we just have to embrace it, be true and love ourselves.   kanina nagpa-relax ako. hehehe.   I am who I say I am and I aM uNat (4 nOw) ü

        Yesterday we went home to our province because my lolo fidel, mama’s uncle, passed away last Thursday. He was 85. He had a heart attack last Friday and he began deteriorating since then.  We left Manila 930 am and reached Pampanga at 12 noon. We ate lunch first at Max’s, Dau then we went to Susie’s to buy tibok-tibok, it’s like maja blanca without the corn and it’s made from pure carabao’s milk. Mama also bought a couple bags of butong pakwan, the best in Angeles. After buying the pasalubong’s at Nepo Mart, we went to the funeral home where my lolo was.   (Side track for a sec) my brother-in-law asked what Nepo was called “nepo”. My suggested the idea that it was probably the owner’s last name, because usually, they are. I disagreed. I have been thinking about it since and I think it means “Open market”. Nepo spelled backwards is open. If you take a look at the structure, it’s not a building. It’s composed of different stalls with a roof covering all the stalls. There are no walls, just divisions separating each store. Hence, the name open market or “Nepo”. But of course, that’s just my theory. I really don’t know why it’s called that.  Going back…after Nepo, we went to the funeral parlor where my lolo was. Almost everyone was there. My cousins, nieces, nephews, tita’s, tito’s, lolo’s and lola’s. Some I recognized and most I didn’t. It was there that I realized that I haven’t gone home for a very long time.   At exactly 3 pm, a mass was held for lolo Fidel. It was short but simple. After which, we all went to La Pieta, the cemetery and said our last goodbye to lolo.  It was a sad and bittersweet day for everyone in the family but we managed to laugh after all the tears that were shed. We were sad because lolo could not be with us anymore but relieved as well because we knew that his pain ceased to exist. At last he was at peace.   I was a little upset that the only time I really got together with my relatives in Angeles nowadays is when someone dies or gets sick or Christmas day. When I was young, I practically grew up there. I just moved to Manila to study but every summer, holy week, Christmas and New Year, my family and I would go home. I’d play with my cousins and go to events such as Fiestas and parades (the lantern parade’s my favorite) and many more occasions. Now that all of us are working, we don’t see each other anymore. We hardly keep in touch even if we all have cell phones because we are just so busy with our lives. I plan to change this. Starting today I will start communicating with my relatives thru text or phone calls before I lose another loved one. It’s ironic that I get to communicate with family outside the country but not keep in touch with those who are here. I can’t and I won’t allow distance to separate us even more. We are a tight knit family and I plan to keep it that way.   I am who I say I am and I am uPsEt
