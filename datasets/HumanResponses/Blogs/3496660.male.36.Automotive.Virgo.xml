      June 1, 2004 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR  The Great Escape By CRAIG UNGER 	   Americans who think the 9/11 commission is going to answer all the crucial questions about the terrorist attacks are likely to be sorely disappointed � especially if they're interested in the secret evacuation of Saudis by plane that began just after Sept. 11. We knew that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis. We knew that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi, was behind 9/11. Yet we did not conduct a police-style investigation of the departing Saudis, of whom two dozen were members. of the bin Laden family. That is not to say that they were complicit in the attacks. Unfortunately, though, we may never know the real story. The investigative panel has already concluded that there is "no credible evidence that any chartered flights of Saudi Arabian nationals departed the United States before the reopening of national airspace." But the real point is that there were still some restrictions on American airspace when the Saudi flights began.  In addition, new evidence shows that the evacuation involved more than the departure of 142 Saudis on six charter flights that the commission is investigating. According to newly released documents, 160 Saudis left the United States on 55 flights immediately after 9/11 � making a total of about 300 people who left with the apparent approval of the Bush administration, far more than has been reported before. The records were released by the Department of Homeland Security in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, a conservative, nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington. The vast majority of the newly disclosed flights were commercial airline flights, not charters, often carrying just two or three Saudi passengers. They originated from more than 20 cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit and Houston. One Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left Kennedy Airport on Sept. 13 with 46 Saudis. The next day, another Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left with 13 Saudis.  The panel has indicated that it has yet to find any evidence that the F.B.I. checked the manifests of departing flights against its terror watch list. The departures of additional Saudis raise more questions for the panel. Richard Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar, told The Hill newspaper recently that he took full responsibility for approving some flights. But we don't know if other Bush administration officials participated in the decision.  The passengers should have been questioned about any links to Osama bin Laden, or his financing. We have long known that some faction of the Saudi elite has helped funnel money to Islamist terrorists �inadvertently at least. Prince Ahmed bin Salman, who has been accused of being an intermediary between Al Qaeda and the House of Saud, boarded one of the evacuation planes in Kentucky. Was he interrogated by the F.B.I. before he left? If the commission dares to address these issues, it will undoubtedly be accused of politicizing one of the most important national security investigations in American history � in an election year, no less.  But if it does not, it risks something far worse � the betrayal of the thousands of people who lost their lives that day, not to mention millions of others who want the truth.

      June 8, 2004 SIDE EFFECTS  Summertime, When People and Parasites Head for the Water By JAMES GORMAN 	   The more you know about microbiology, the harder it is to go swimming. The ocean not only has the odd macrobiotic sting ray and shark but various sorts of bacteria, dinoflagellates and viruses. That's in a healthy ocean. As Dr. Michael Beach (his real name), an epidemiologist in the parasitic disease section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said, "A lot of these bugs just live in the wild and we get in their way."  Dr. Beach is involved in the healthy swimming campaign for the agency. The seashore and rivers, ponds and lakes are part of its concern, because they can certainly contain health hazards, even if they are not polluted. But the current focus is on pools and a parasite called cryptosporidium.  Discussing the way it is spread is a really unpleasant job. But, the agency has decided, somebody has to do it. Here is something from one of their warning brochures. "Think about it!" the big type blurts. "You share the water with everyone in the pool. If someone with diarrhea contaminates the water, swallowing the water can make you sick."  The fact is I love swimming. I swim in pools, in the ocean, in rivers, streams, ponds, oceans, mangrove swamps. I swim under water. I scuba dive. I swim where I know there are leeches in the water. I do not mind barracudas.  The only thing I do not do when I'm swimming is "think about it" - until now. After visiting the disease-control-in-swimming Web site (www.healthyswimming.org  ), I can think of nothing else. I visited the site to see what the healthiest place to swim would be. After spending some time there, I lowered my expectations. I called Dr. Beach to ask what the least unhealthy place to swim would be.  "Impossible for me to answer," he said. Swimming anywhere can result in ear, eye, skin and respiratory infections, as well as gastrointestinal disasters. The ocean has one major advantage - there's a lot of it. So the bad things are diluted, which does not help much if you're near a place where someone is dumping raw sewage. In the cleanest ocean water, there are still a lot of bacteria that love an open wound. Lakes, rivers and ponds have their own problems. After a heavy rain, runoff can carry all sorts of stuff into them, and not just from people. Dr. Emilia Mia Sordillo, head of the microbiology laboratory at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, said some parasites like cryptosporidium are spread in animal feces. "If you're in a farm country lake," she said, "you're more likely to have a problem."  And then there are pools. They have chlorine, which kills almost everything, but not immediately. It takes the chlorine in a pool six or seven days to kill cryptosporidium.  What the Centers for Disease Control suggests to combat the parasite is increased vigilance by pool staffs and swimmers. Thus the agency's brochure "Fecal Accident Response Recommendations for Pool Staff: What Do You Do When You Find Poop in the Pool?" and its poster that looks like an eye chart. It poses the question, "Can you read this?" The letters of the chart say: "Have diarrhea? Don't swim." The reason for the campaign, Dr. Beach said, is that diarrhea outbreaks caused by cryptosporidium - though still rare, considering the hundreds of millions of visits to pools each summer - are 10 times as common as they were 15 years ago.  That seems to be an actual increase rather than an artifact of more careful reporting. But that is hard to prove. Health officials started paying attention to cryptosporidium in the early 1980's, Dr. Beach said, when it emerged as a deadly pathogen in people with AIDS, whose immune systems were suppressed. There have been some outbreaks in drinking water, including a major one in Milwaukee in 1993. And now epidemiologists are seeing outbreaks in pools, Dr. Beach added, because of the parasite's resistance to chlorine. Ultraviolet light will kill it, but it's a one-time treatment. You can leave chlorine in the pool as a constant guardian. Any pool can become infected. And there have been outbreaks at big water parks, Dr. Beach said, although "some of the biggest offenders are the little kiddie pools." The reason, apart from how the pools are maintained, is that with children, those infamous accidents are not so uncommon.  I called my doctor, Michael Rendel, who practices in Manhattan and whose specialty is infectious diseases, to ask whether he saw many illnesses or infections that were a result of swimming. He said that he saw a patient or two each season, and that the problems were often "secondary to trauma," meaning that the patients had a cut or other injury that let bacteria in. I asked Dr. Sordillo how much people should really worry about swimming. She said, "I personally don't let my children swim in public pools." I should add that Dr. Beach did emphasize that swimming was very good exercise. "I hope,'' he said, "that we don't scare people off."  On the other hand, if they are not somewhat scared, they won't be careful - a difficult line to walk. For myself, I have always preferred beach, lake or river, whether in farm country or not, to the cleanest pool, so learning about cryptosporidium will just reinforce old habits. I have always been wary of other people, even when they are fully clothed and keeping their distance. If they are all crowded into a pool with me and I have to start thinking about their hygiene, that may be more than I can tolerate. Two things are certain. I'm not going anywhere near a kiddie pool. And I'm going to follow one recommendation scrupulously. Wherever I swim, I'm keeping my mouth closed. &nbsp; urlLink

          June 6, 2004 Supersizing Family Get-Togethers By KATE ZERNIKE	 	 MARY-ANN GALLAGHER visited Walt Disney World the week after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and in the emotion of the time, she looked up at Cinderella Castle in all its candy-colored glory and vowed she would return with all her children and grandchildren. It took more than two years to pull off what would come to be known as Grandma Gallagher's Great Adventure. Mother, son, daughter and in-laws traded e-mail messages to negotiate everyone's preferences on an ever-shifting itinerary. They bought walkie-talkies and assigned each day a different shirt color - Saturday, orange; Sunday, light blue - to make it easier to find their group of 10 among the hordes. They arranged for adjoining rooms with Grandma in the middle, so the adults could have somewhere to hang out without worrying about waking the kids after bedtime. "It went a lot smoother than we thought it would, especially considering we had four kids under 6," Mrs. Gallagher's son-in-law, Chas Burkhart, said on their last night at the resort near Orlando as the grandchildren mingled with Captain Hook and Mr. Smee and the adults sipped tropical drinks while they waited to board a fireworks cruise.  Of course, Disney was ready for them. The resort has always attracted families, but last fall it made a bid for larger family groups by starting Magical Gatherings, which rearranged restaurants, added personal travel planners and four attractions available only for groups of eight or more: a Peter Pan fireworks cruise, a private safari and dinner at the Animal Kingdom, an International Dinner at Epcot, and a breakfast with Disney characters.  Just as extended families like the Gallaghers have discovered the joy of traveling together, the travel industry has discovered extended families. Resorts, hotels and tour operators are courting them in ways that go far beyond "children stay free," with everything from baby-sitting and family yoga to reconfigured suites, free family portraits and personal concierges to plan events for large groups. Zagat, for example, is offering a new guide to family travel, with parent ratings and reviews on resorts, including categories like "tops for toddlers" and "strollers available." The Winnetu resort, with suites and cottages on South Beach in Martha's Vineyard, promotes its nonsmoking policy as family friendly, and offers grocery delivery to eliminate at least one headache that comes with renting a house with extended family.  The resorts say they are reacting to surveys showing greater interest in traveling in large family groups. According to the 2003 National Leisure Travel Monitor conducted by YPB&R, a travel marketing firm in Orlando, 69 percent of active travelers - those who had taken at least one overnight trip in the previous year - cited "spending time with family" as very important or extremely important, up from 57 percent in 2000, and 35 percent of adult leisure travelers took at least one vacation with children the year before, up from 26 percent in 2000. The survey was based on telephone interviews with 1,350 people nationwide.  In another survey of 1,655 active travelers in August, commissioned by Disney and AAA, the firm found that almost 80 percent of active leisure travelers took a vacation with extended family or friends in the past five years. Of those trips, 82 percent were taken with extended family, 68 percent with friends, and 46 percent with other families. The average number of people traveling was seven, but 26 percent of trips included eight people or more. The firm dubbed the trend "togethering," which has now become a watchword in the travel business. Peter C. Yesawich, the managing partner of YPB&R, traces much of it to Sept. 11. "Everybody withdrew for a significant number of months, then as a natural consequence of the turmoil in the world, the uncertainty, people turned for comfort to family," he said.  "I think all of these places discovered family in the late 90's," he added. "They dialed up in terms of promotional dollars post-9/11 because that's where the trend was." In New York City, the epicenter of the attacks, a large increase in family travelers in the year after Sept. 11 allowed the number of travelers to rebound well past 2001 levels, even as business and international travelers stayed away, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau. Recognizing the potential of the family market, the city produced a new children's book that includes a travel guide, to sell in bookstores nationwide. "I think people just are terrified of being separated from their families in the event something does happen," said Julian Harrison, the president of Premier Tours, based in Philadelphia, which runs safaris in East and Southern Africa. "And I think people have taken on a whole new perspective on life in general, to be more family-oriented. Family business for us has grown quite dramatically. I'm not saying 9/11 was the sole reason, but it seemed to be a turning point." Even the camps that Mr. Harrison contracts with in Africa are responding, he said, building bigger family tents with separate rooms. Others have started kids' camps with naturalists whose sole job is to watch children and teach them about the environment. Some companies are trying to appeal to larger groups with discounts. Lindblad Expeditions, which runs family eco-tours to the Galápagos and Alaska, provides a 5 percent discount for groups of eight or more, and $500 off for every child under 21. In the last year or so, the family trips have sold out faster than any other, said Carole Rogers, the company's marketing manager. Woodloch Pines, a 250-acre family owned lakeside golf and ski resort in eastern Pennsylvania, offers all-inclusive discounts for groups of 20 or more, and assigns a staff coordinator to send out invitations to group members and book reservations.  Others have designed new programs that try to provide something for everyone in the family, regardless of age. Elderhostel has a grandparent-grandchild "Lord of the Rings" trip to New Zealand this summer, tracing the filming of the Oscar-sweeping movie, which also appealed across the generations. At Nemacolin Woodlands Resort and Spa, on 2,500 acres in the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, kids can excavate replicas of dinosaur bones and learn about fossils in a new Dino Discoveries program while their parents visit the spa, or test drive Hummers at the resort's Off Road Driving Academy. (For guests who do not own a Hummer, the resort will provide one.) THE something-for-everyone idea extends to food, as well. The safari dinner at Animal Kingdom at Disney World generously defines "African cuisine" to include chicken fingers and macaroni and cheese as well as lamb stew and chicken with couscous. Glendorn, a Relais & Chateaux property on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest in northwestern Pennsylvania, serves Champagne as well as s'mores at its bonfires around Skipper Lake. Club Med, the original singles resort, went family-friendly with its first "family village" in Europe in 1967. This year, Club Med Sandpiper, the family village in Port St. Lucie, Fla., where the electrical outlets have plastic safety plugs and strollers line the pool and bar, began offering family suites - adjoining rooms that get special turndown service and a delivery of milk and cookies each night, as well as a fridge (there are no minibars at Club Med) with juice and soda, carefully sequestered in the parents' side of the suite. The suites cost about 30 percent more than regular rooms, but guests are greeted with crayons and coloring books, and a list of kids movies on DVD, as well as a baby bed and baby bath if needed (most villages do not have regular bathtubs). The package also includes a family portrait and a Siesta Club baby-sitting service. Parents drop off their children before dinner; the staff will put them in pajamas and coax them to sleep - or at least try - before parents return, by midnight, to carry them home. Lisa Tzur and her husband - and her next door neighbors and her parents - chose Club Med Sandpiper in Florida because of the suites, and in particular the Siesta Club. "For us, with three kids at $25 a night for baby-sitting, it makes sense to pay extra for the suite," said Ms. Tzur, a rabbi in Scottsdale, Ariz. They had planned the trip so that her parents, who live in Florida, could see the grandkids, and had considered a condo, but decided that a resort was better. "With these rooms we're not in each other's places," she said. "And to cook for seven people is a chore. The 5-year-old is not going to want to eat what my father's going to want to eat." Extended family often means at least a few friends thrown in; the Tzurs and their neighbors in Scottsdale, Lezli and Geoff Goodwin, have been on three vacations together. "Acquired family," Ms. Goodwin called it. "It's easier than traveling with siblings. With friends, the brattiness factor is neutralized. It's not formal like an organized group, but you're gentler than you are with family." There are challenges to traveling in big groups. It can be harder to agree on activities and, once there is a plan, to change it. "We're used to doing things in small groups where you can do things spur of the moment," said Susan Allen of Atlanta, who had chosen the private safari at Disney for her group of 23 siblings, aunts, cousins and her own children. "You definitely have to do more planning." Ginger Coffey, at Disney with her husband and two children and her brother's family - all from Oklahoma - was wilting on the fifth day of their trip. "You're parenting for four children instead of two," she said. "There have been moments." But the safari dinner - $59.99 for each adult and $19.99 for children ages 3 to 10 - allowed them to be in the Animal Kingdom after the day's guests had left, so they could enjoy it without the usual crowds. "We were here yesterday, it was like this," she said, pulling her arms tight to her sides. There are unexpected benefits, too, as the Gallaghers discovered. The two sets of grandchildren behaved better than they do on trips with their immediate families. "They won't have the meltdown for their aunt the way they will for their mother," said Claudia Gallagher, Mary-Ann's daughter-in-law, who lives in Pennsylvania. The three younger children rose to the level of the two older ones, whether the challenge was more sophisticated food or Splash Mountain. And having a bigger group made it easier to divide into smaller ones by age or interest; Claudia could go with the older boys to the big kids' part of the park while her youngest, age 3, went with his younger cousins to the baby side.  Of course, all that planning helped. Whether by T-shirt or walkie-talkie, no one got lost.  KATE ZERNIKE is a reporter for The New York Times.

Lindblad Expeditions, which runs family eco-tours to the Galápagos and Alaska, provides a 5 percent discount for groups of eight or more, and $500 off for every child under 21. In the last year or so, the family trips have sold out faster than any other, said Carole Rogers, the company's marketing manager. Woodloch Pines, a 250-acre family owned lakeside golf and ski resort in eastern Pennsylvania, offers all-inclusive discounts for groups of 20 or more, and assigns a staff coordinator to send out invitations to group members and book reservations.  Others have designed new programs that try to provide something for everyone in the family, regardless of age. Elderhostel has a grandparent-grandchild "Lord of the Rings" trip to New Zealand this summer, tracing the filming of the Oscar-sweeping movie, which also appealed across the generations. At Nemacolin Woodlands Resort and Spa, on 2,500 acres in the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, kids can excavate replicas of dinosaur bones and learn about fossils in a new Dino Discoveries program while their parents visit the spa, or test drive Hummers at the resort's Off Road Driving Academy. (For guests who do not own a Hummer, the resort will provide one.) THE something-for-everyone idea extends to food, as well. The safari dinner at Animal Kingdom at Disney World generously defines "African cuisine" to include chicken fingers and macaroni and cheese as well as lamb stew and chicken with couscous. Glendorn, a Relais & Chateaux property on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest in northwestern Pennsylvania, serves Champagne as well as s'mores at its bonfires around Skipper Lake. Club Med, the original singles resort, went family-friendly with its first "family village" in Europe in 1967. This year, Club Med Sandpiper, the family village in Port St. Lucie, Fla., where the electrical outlets have plastic safety plugs and strollers line the pool and bar, began offering family suites - adjoining rooms that get special turndown service and a delivery of milk and cookies each night, as well as a fridge (there are no minibars at Club Med) with juice and soda, carefully sequestered in the parents' side of the suite. The suites cost about 30 percent more than regular rooms, but guests are greeted with crayons and coloring books, and a list of kids movies on DVD, as well as a baby bed and baby bath if needed (most villages do not have regular bathtubs). The package also includes a family portrait and a Siesta Club baby-sitting service. Parents drop off their children before dinner; the staff will put them in pajamas and coax them to sleep - or at least try - before parents return, by midnight, to carry them home. Lisa Tzur and her husband - and her next door neighbors and her parents - chose Club Med Sandpiper in Florida because of the suites, and in particular the Siesta Club. "For us, with three kids at $25 a night for baby-sitting, it makes sense to pay extra for the suite," said Ms. Tzur, a rabbi in Scottsdale, Ariz. They had planned the trip so that her parents, who live in Florida, could see the grandkids, and had considered a condo, but decided that a resort was better. "With these rooms we're not in each other's places," she said. "And to cook for seven people is a chore. The 5-year-old is not going to want to eat what my father's going to want to eat." Extended family often means at least a few friends thrown in; the Tzurs and their neighbors in Scottsdale, Lezli and Geoff Goodwin, have been on three vacations together. "Acquired family," Ms. Goodwin called it. "It's easier than traveling with siblings. With friends, the brattiness factor is neutralized. It's not formal like an organized group, but you're gentler than you are with family." There are challenges to traveling in big groups. It can be harder to agree on activities and, once there is a plan, to change it. "We're used to doing things in small groups where you can do things spur of the moment," said Susan Allen of Atlanta, who had chosen the private safari at Disney for her group of 23 siblings, aunts, cousins and her own children. "You definitely have to do more planning." Ginger Coffey, at Disney with her husband and two children and her brother's family - all from Oklahoma - was wilting on the fifth day of their trip. "You're parenting for four children instead of two," she said. "There have been moments." But the safari dinner - $59.99 for each adult and $19.99 for children ages 3 to 10 - allowed them to be in the Animal Kingdom after the day's guests had left, so they could enjoy it without the usual crowds. "We were here yesterday, it was like this," she said, pulling her arms tight to her sides. There are unexpected benefits, too, as the Gallaghers discovered. The two sets of grandchildren behaved better than they do on trips with their immediate families. "They won't have the meltdown for their aunt the way they will for their mother," said Claudia Gallagher, Mary-Ann's daughter-in-law, who lives in Pennsylvania. The three younger children rose to the level of the two older ones, whether the challenge was more sophisticated food or Splash Mountain. And having a bigger group made it easier to divide into smaller ones by age or interest; Claudia could go with the older boys to the big kids' part of the park while her youngest, age 3, went with his younger cousins to the baby side.  Of course, all that planning helped. Whether by T-shirt or walkie-talkie, no one got lost.  KATE ZERNIKE is a reporter for The New York Times.

      Smooth Driving Remember the three C's, from Jackie Stewart.  by Peter D. duPre  According to racing great Jackie Stewart, you can accuse a person of just about anything and get away with it as long as you don't call them a lousy lover or bad driver. He says people are sensitive about two things because they go directly to the core of how we define ourselves. And while Stewart can't give much advice on the former, he is an expert at the latter.  Stewart, who won the Formula One World Driving Championship three times during his racing career, was famous for driving smoothly and with finesse. He says smooth driving is just as important on the highway as it is on the racecourse.  "The art of driving road cars and race cars is so similar," said Stewart. "In both motor sport and on the highway, there is a delicate balance between being in and out of control."  We've all seen cars being driven hard, on the edge of being out of control. It's what most new and inexperienced drivers (read teen-agers) do every time they get behind the wheel. Young drivers seem to be under the mistaken notion that driving gently and smoothly means driving slowly. They think that to show their skill, they have to drive hard and shift hard. The fact is, most new drivers would be amazed to learn that hard driving is actually slower driving and it is not as safe. Don't believe it? Well, go to a few road races and watch the cars whose tires squeal the most. These are the guys who are busy losing the race. Every tire squeal means that the driver is scrubbing speed off the car in every turn. He may sound fast and look fast, but in the end he won't be first across the finish line.  That's why his peers regard Stewart as such a master. In all the races that he won, Stewart's car never looked like it was working hard. Instead, he was so smooth that many people actually thought he was slower than the other racers  right up until he took that checkered flag.  "Driving hard throws your passengers around and is uncomfortable," said Stewart. "It is hard on the passengers and hard on the car. Smooth driving can actually be faster driving and at the end of the drive there's no carsickness, no abuse of the car, and the drive seems shorter."  Chauffeur, anyone? Limo drivers are an example of how smooth driving can actually be fast driving. That's why many chauffeured drives seem so short. There is no sense of being driven for the passengers. There is no neck-snapping or head-bobbing during acceleration and braking and no one has to grab onto the armrest during cornering. Limos are designed to provide soft, cushy rides for the passengers but to do this they must be driven gently and with finesse.  "Chauffeurs are the real professionals of driving, if they are good," said Stewart. "To be good they must be smooth and gentle on the gas and brake to keep the passengers comfortable. When done correctly, the car should be able to come to a complete stop with the passengers hardly noticing the vehicle has braked."  According to Stewart you don't have to be a racecar driver or a chauffeur to drive like a pro. He believes that anyone can improve his or her driving technique and ability simply by following what he calls the "three C's" - to be more conscientious and considerate and to concentrate.  Conscientious Try to be a better driver every time you get behind the wheel by practicing smooth driving techniques. Be gentle when braking and progressive when applying the throttle. Don't hit the brake pedal hard. Instead, modulate foot pressure so that you slow or stop the vehicle without the car nose-diving. When applying the throttle, roll gently and smoothly on/off the gas. Even when you are accelerating quickly, be progressive so that the back of the vehicle doesn't go into a squat and the passenger heads don't bob up and down from you getting on and off the throttle. Instead of hammering the throttle during driving, anticipate the need for more or less throttle and use your foot to smooth out the transition between accelerating and decelerating. Considerate Whether on the racetrack or the freeway, a good driver is considerate of both his passengers and other drivers. Passengers don't like being thrown around inside the vehicle. It's uncomfortable and you'll end up hearing about it. As for other drivers, they don't like being cut off or having you slam on the brakes. Give other drivers plenty of room and plenty of warning. Use your signals, change lanes smoothly and unless it is an emergency, avoid sudden maneuvers that could scare other drivers. Concentrate Pay attention to what you are doing. Keep the radio volume down, and avoid distractions such as newspapers, cell phones, or eating. Make sure the seat and wheel are adjusted properly and that everyone is wearing their seatbelt. Think about what is going on around you and what you can do to make your drive safer and more comfortable. "Be more conscientious about driving," said Stewart. "Few people in America are. Concentrate more  you'll be smoother. If you do this, chances are you'll also be more considerate  not just of you passengers, but of other drivers, the traffic around you, and general conditions."  &nbsp; urlLink

       what's up? -  it's been nuts. below i've posted pictures from 7/23 and 7/29-7/30. on 7/23, it was rainy and overcast so we just we to rye beach park and walked around. as the weather worsened we went to the westchester mall. alas, two pictures into our day and the batteries died.  on 7/29 and 7/30, i was in west palm beach to visit randy and catherine and go with randy to the rush concert. 7/29 was the exact 30th anniversary of neil peart joining the band and completing the greatest trio ever. it was also frontman and bassist Geddy Lee's birthday so the show was a significant one in terms of the bands and its fans.  but do not worry, i commisioned ashley to document her friday happenings without me. she went to jones beach with richie, fran and owen. pictures are forthcoming and will be posted here shortly.  coming up we have jenny's birthday on the 7th, rush concert on the 11th, i go to ameriquest ballbark in arlington, tx for two games the 12th and 13th, dd's birthday is the 14th (10 YEARS OLD!) and then we all go to hyannis, ma for a week. should be a bunch of interesting pictures in the weeks to come!  p.s. if anyone has pictures from kristin's shower on 8/1 i'd love to put them up here!   urlLink http://www.rush.com

       what's up kids?  below you have pictures from our 8/6 trip to robert moses state park on long island.  the weather was 75 and breezy and the waves were 3-5 feet.  pretty sweet.  also, you will see pictures from jenny's birthday on 8/7 when she went with richie, ashley and owen to the yankee game vs. toronto.  feel free to add comments to any of the pictures.  this may be my last post until after melissa's bbq for nicole.  i've got rush on the 11th, trip to tx on 12th and 13th, dd's birthday on 14th, cape cod 16th, rush 18th and 19th in nyc back from cape cod on 21st and nicole's farewell bbq on the 22nd.  whew!  in between, janet will be overseas so we may have some pics from her.  also, if there are any kristin shower pics floating around, email them to me so we can share :-)   urlLink http://www.rush.com   urlLink http://www.huskerpedia.com   urlLink http://www.2112.net/powerwindows
