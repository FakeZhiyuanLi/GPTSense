						   Hey there!  Thanks for coming to check out what in the world I may have to say.  I've never done this before so I guess I whould start out with telling you a little bit about myself.  But first I need to give mad props to one of my best friends in the world Courtney Helms.  She rocks pretty dang hard.  Okay, so about me.  I'm a 25 year old editor at a local news station (WVLT Channel 8 for all you k-town locals).  I'm egaged to a fine young woman named Allison Mullins who's life will forever be intertwined with mine on September 10th.  I've gotta go back to work but first I just want to say I'm pretty excited about this whole blogging thing because I've got nothing to say and I can't wait to spill it all over the internet!!  Peace and Love

						   Okay, I was driving home and I thought about a time when I accidentally hit a guy's golf ball that was playing in a tournament and he got so pissed.  And you know what I realized?  There is nothing in this world that is as funny as a pissed off "serious" golfer.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy going out to the course every now and then and hittin' the ball around, but when people take it a bit it seriously it's just so funny to piss them off.  My favorite is when people shout at Tiger and those guys when they hit and they get so mad.  Tiger whined "someone was screaming when I hit my ball" when that guy yelled "Noonan" and he got so pissed when someone clicked a camera...I SAID CLICKED A CAMERA when he was teeing off.  You don't hear quarterbacks crying "all of those people were screaming when I was trying to complete my pass".  Pro golfers are freaking wusses.  It's a sport that is for rich people and no one but rich people will ever excel in it.  Except for the super tallented.  But only people who can afford to play three or four times a week, and that's impossible if you can afford not to work and still pay for tee times and all that.  Like I said I like casual golfing and what not, but when people take it too seriously, it's time to get out the air horn and piss some people off.  HILARIOUS!!!

						   There are a multitude of subjects I want to talk about today.&nbsp; Let's start with news of the stupid James Banks.&nbsp; The idiot is driving drunk with an open container.&nbsp; When he gets pulled over and the officer asked him to turn the radio down...he turned it up!!! How stupid can you get.&nbsp; But I've decided that no UT fan can truly pass any judgement on the poor boy.&nbsp; It's your fault he thinks he can do this with impunity.&nbsp; All the screamin' idiots who would sell their wives and daughters for Florida and Alabama tickets have contributed to players thinking they are more than what they are (which is student athletes who play football so they can get an education, not go to school to play football).&nbsp;   Next we'll talk about the great jigsaw puzzle.&nbsp; No I'm not talking about the 5,000 piecer that your parents gave you 8 years ago and you just now finished.&nbsp; I'm talking about life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it seems like your life is all scattered about in a million different pieces and then, eventually, those pieces kind of come together.&nbsp; It's like, you kind of get the out line and then eventually you start to get a bit of the picture and so on.&nbsp; Well, this week a few of the pieces are coming together and I couldn't be happier.&nbsp; It's just so awesome seeing how God works.&nbsp;   Last but not least I want to leave you with some advice.&nbsp; Drink as much water as you can.&nbsp; You'll feel better, and it's just plain healthier.&nbsp; I'm dealing with kidney stones right now and it's just no fun believe me.&nbsp; The only cool thing is that the medicine I'm on turns my pee green.&nbsp; Yup, my pee is green.&nbsp; I feel like a freakin' leprechaun every time I go to the bathroom.&nbsp; Pretty cool, huh?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;I thought so.  Take care!

						   Really, think of one.  Go on, I'll wait....waiting...waiting...times up.  Now that every single song that says monday is in your head we'll move on.  Don't you love it when you can do something to help someone out.  I think it's that deep down need to feel like you're freakin' worth something that gets satisfied when you help someone out.  So I'm driving back to town after helping my friend Matt move, and Courtney is like "I'm going swimming."  That's exactly what I want to hear.  I'm like, "Oh yeah, well I'm going to work, don't you wish you were me?"  It's all good, they still pay me here...for some reason.  So, do you ever start thinking "What in the world am I good at?"  Like especially when you see someone else excelling in something?  I mean you're proud of them and happy for them...but it can also kinda make ya think about yourself and what tallents you possess (or is it just me?)  One more thing before I head back to the dungeon.  I just want to update anyone who reads this stuff (and you know who you are) about my housing situation.  I get to go with the inspector on thursday and look around at the ol' house and see what's goin' on with it.  Pretty excited about that.  Random thought of the day:  If oranges weren't orange what in the world would we call them??  The battle belongs to none other but the Lord!!

						   Not really.   Anyway, do you ever wish you could just point your finger at yourself and just say "Okay there little fella, simmer down now.  That's enough talking."  Or at the very least, "Shut up!!"  Here's the thing.  It might happen to normal people once or twice a month or something.  It happens to me all the time.  I don't mean on a regular basis.  I literally mean all the time.  If I were a mute, I would have the best personality ever.  I'm almost convinced of it.  But I think I ruin my coolness with talking and in the middle of talking I'm thinking in my head.  "What are you doing man?  Shut up!  Shut up now!  You are creating some kind of polution with your talking!!!" Okay enough of this I have to get back to work here.  Be good to yourselves...and each other.  P.S.  Don't you hate it when the title of a blog has nothing to do with what the blog is actually about?  No?  Me neither.  Peace!

						   Okay, so I'm really tired of looking for a house.  I mean really tired.  I'm almost convinced that 90% of the homeless people out there are homeless because they just got tired of looking for a house to live in.  Seriously!  It wouldn't be so bad if two houses we liked got sold before we could get offers in and stuff.  Oh well, patience is a virtue.  Anyhow, I'm really excited about this weekend because not only am I gonna participate in a day long marathon LOTR movie fest, but I also get to go register.  Even though it's not like I really get to have a say in what we register for I still think it will be really cool.  All right, I'm out!!

						   Okay kids, here's a nickel's worth of advice for free.  There are gonna be some people in this world who just don't like you.  Don't get me wrong...I like you just fine.  But for some reason you will run across at least somebody who does not like you.  Now here's the kicker, here's the thing that will absolutely kill you.  This person, or these people, that don't like you, will more than likely have no good reason.  That's right, they don't like you just because they don't like you.  Find the philosopher who can figure that one out (or maybe psychologist.)  And if you're like me and you don't like people not liking you (because let's face it, I'm a pretty likeable guy) you'll try to figure out why it is they don't like you.  Not that you're gonna change, because you shouldn't have to.  The thing is that it makes no sense just not to like someone.  If I say that someone is annoying, or wierd, or whatever, and that's why I don't like them, I think that's pretty arrogant because that's saying that I'm better than them and I'm not annoying, or wierd, or whatever.  Let's face it, everyone is annoying, wierd, or just plain dumb sometimes.  I guarantee it!  Now the only exception I can see is not liking someone because they are just plain mean.  We should still strive to love these people with Christ's love, but if someone is just plain mean and hateful to you it makes it pretty hard to be nice to them.  That's where Christians can show themselves different!  Talk to them with a smile on your face (if it's someone you work with that you have to see all the time), offer to help them out if they need it, do all the things you think Christ would do in your place.  And if you can't figure out what that would be, read about what Christ has done for all of God's enemies (that would include all of us before we were saved) while we were still rebelling against God!  Peace and Love

						   Well, another day in the books. I just got done with work and I thought I'd pause to share my thoughts.  I'll have to say that things are going rather well.  My lovely fiance and I went and drove by a few houses (have you ever tried to make drive-by plural??  Like "Yesterday they did a drive-by, but today they capped six suckas when they did two drive-bies...drive-byes...drive-bys???  I dunno)  Anyway, tomorow I get to go look at about 4 houses and I have a feeling that one of those four (or the one we already have in mind) is the one.  And it's pretty exciting to think about owning my own home.  If I could photo copy a weekend it would definately be last weekend.  I mean it just rocked so hard....well make that photo-copy and put into Photoshop and draw Rob Mcgee in somehow (I miss that guy)...but none the less this weekend was just freakin' awesome.  So saturday Allie and I hang out ALL DAY!!  It was great!!!!!  We went to the mall and she shopped for a suit (and she got a pretty nice one too) and we ate with her dad's fam, and saw Spider-man 2 (tied for best superhero flick ever with X-men 2 right now for me) and after the movie I hit the arcade (yes I am a massive dork) and Matt says "Allison and Courtney are gonna play hte dacing game."  Are you kidding me??  So they play and of course Matt and I have to play (and of course...not to brag...I'm better than everyone) and we had so much fun that I bought the home version and we played some more sunday night after church.  And sunday night was great...well, I would have liked to stand by dad when we sang, but that's okay, I know I'll have more opportunities.  Awesome weekend...Awesome friends...just...awesome!  Peace and Love!

						   Okay, I love fridays.  I mean, I have a freakin' shirt that I wear only on fridays!!  I  LOVE  FRIDAYS!!  But at the same time, why is it that they can be the worst day on the other hand?  I think part of it is you're so ready for the weekend that when stuff starts going wrong it's just kind of spirit crushing.  If something goes wrong on a wednesday on thursday it's just not as bad as something just totally screwin' up on a friday.  I've had a good week.  I've pretty much had flawless shows all week (I'm a news tape editor by the way) and then today for somereason I had a couple of mess ups.  Chalk it up to me not paying enough attention, or not having good communication with my producer or what, but a few things went wrong.  I'm so ready for the weekend.  Ready to see my fiance, ready to see Spider-Man 2 and ready to sing Sunday.  It's gonna be a GREAT weekend!!!

						   What's up y'all.  Well, I'm at work so this won't be long.  I just wanted to jot down some thoughts here really quick.  With all of the rain that the mighty K-town has been getting lately a thought entered my mind the other day.  Isn't it amazing that God knows exactly how many drops of rain fell those 4 or 5 days of having rain almost everyday?  I thought so.  Anywho, I'm having a good week (even though it's marred by the absence of the love of my life).  It's good to be catching up on all of the good times with Courtney, and hanging out with ol' Matt Bessom has been pretty cool too.  Last night after an IHOP encounter in which I was trying to entice Matt into spilling the beans on a number of personal matters (I like to pry..I'm not in journalism for nothing) We were all wondering what to do when I heard Courtney utter one of the best phrases a girl could utter (other than a few choice others...within the confines of marraige of course).  She looked at Matt and I and with a sparkle in her eye said "Let's play video games"  ARe you kidding????  Okay that ends this Blog.  Gotta go, boss is coming  Love for all the homies!!
