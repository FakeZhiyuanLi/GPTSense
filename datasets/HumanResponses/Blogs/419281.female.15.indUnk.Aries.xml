      God is very good. This year I had a sense that I wasn't even going to do daycamp. I had so much going on. I still didn't know if I would pass certain classes. But with the help of God and the studying time he taught me to use even if I did or didn't use it really paid off. In the end this summer looks great. It looks like daycamp will be great under the director Jerry. All the leaders are a fine bunch to work with. I think 6-8 will do just great. We have Nathan as head and I, and Janet Mel's friend, Jade, Melissa, Stan, and Eugene. I think we'll do just fine. Melanie's bunch is fine, Stephs group looks great...and Calvin you go!!! Heehee....  My favorite thing to do is go to the Lord in prayer....  To thank God for the opportunity that I get or will get to go be a leader for daycamp, to go on an exciting missions trip in Mexico, to be able to enjoy the kids and have fun...  But also to ask him for guidance, help, patience, strength, endurance, and etc...through out the 4 weeks that I'll be doing daycamp and for the 5 that the others will be doing.  Also that all leaders will be well prepared. That we'll be able to show the kids and even the leaders that we are really Christians. To see how people work and to see how we can be united as one daycamp and a church. That ideas will flow that we'll be open to the challenged God will be planting that we may learn and grow from them.  That the kids will be well behaved this year that they will hopefully make it a little easier for the leaders to maintain.  That we also during the 4/5 weeks will be prepared to be servants and serve and not act like the kids.

      Wow Summer Daycamp is almost on it's way. We will have our training meeting on Saturday from 9AM-5PM. Fun stuff! This year I am going to be leading with Nathan for 6-8.   For many of us leaders we have been worried, anxious, or like excited. My heart is all there and ready to serve. So for the worried ones out there PRAY about it!   Sis In Christ, Christina

      So today we started the 3rd week. It was kind of let's say disorgainized. Oh well, who knew that 6-8th graders would be so inactive. I think I really shouldn't have done that activity. It's also very hard to play Mafia with them too. Man oh well I have another 4 days and 1 week to endure. Can you please pray that I won't be to stressed out also that we'll get through. But that we get through through God and that God will lead us through the next few weeks. Thanks.

      Wow I got through the week. It was somewhat a sucess. I slept in today. I was kind of thinking isn't it rude to yell when someone is saying prayer? So also...This week is kind of a bust everyone complaining. I think I should go camping this week. I need to get away. And when the 6-8 is a bust they won't be complaining about me and Nathan anymore. Yup. We are trying our best and this is the group we didn't even want. So there you go complaining and getting us made. Why don't you go do it!

       The Letter of Finalization of my missons trip   We got all the forms notarized and stuff so good to go. 3 more meetings then were off!  Hey Guys! I have felt God calling me to serve throughout these last couple of months. He has opened up a great opportunity for me to go out and show His love to others that have not got a glimse of His beauty. We will be going to Ensenada Mexico and Baja. We will be doing ministry through sports, construction, dental and medical, VBS, and much more. I will be joining others around the BayArea and elsewhere for this trip from July 31-August 7th!  I am looking forward to the trip! I can't wait.  Please pray for this trip.  Sis In Christ, ChristinaGee

       "For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction." (1 Thess. 1:4-5)    Training Meetings   Wow our 2nd training meeting was on Sunday. It was awesome. I really got to know Stephanie and Sammie better. We were talking it out in the kitchen in Campbell.  I really can't wait til we get going on the trip. We now will be doing VBS in the morning and Construction in the afternoon.  I am having a little trouble sharing my testimony. But I think in time I'll be open freely.  Saying prayer(s) for me is pretty good so that's one of my strengths. If you ask I'll say yes. Because saying "YES!" is the thing in Mexicio! I've been wanting to volunteer when people ask me but that's when I'm shy, but asking is always a "YES!"

        Christina’s 2004   RAV Prayer Letter   “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” ~ Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)~    Hola hermanos!  That’s what I’ll be saying this summer. I’m excited yet at the same time nervous. I’ll be heading out with our team of 80+ from North California, Washington, and Oregon to Ensenada, Mexico from August 1st-6th. My portion of about 40 team members will be conducting a Vacation Bible School at Ojos Negros. The other part of our team will be showing God’s love to the Mexicans through other VBS programs, sports ministry, women’s ministry, construction, and a medical/dental ministry. I hope that you will partner with us as we do God’s work in Mexico!   Calling of The One and Only  I find myself standing firm on His solid foundation. On it I find myself with new challenges everyday. As I go on with life I realize it’s not for myself, but it’s all about Him. This summer I will be serving through my church daycamp, this mission trip, and everyday! This will be my first mission trip. This will also be my first time in Mexico. As, I read the e-mail about RAV I kind of thought, “Whatever!” The next couple of days I found myself challenged and asking God for help. He guided me to take another look. So, I took another peek at the letter. I felt urged to re-read and re-read. Then, I stood up and said, “Here I am Lord, use me! I offer my life, fully. Use it for Your glory!”  This song too played over and over in my head. It still does with the song Make Me A Servant.  Then I thought why not take that “leap of faith”? There’s no more hiding and no more going back. I’ve taken that big open challenge that was offered to me. At times it’s still hard to imagine me praying for large groups and sharing my testimony with others. I didn’t know exactly what I was getting myself into. I examined myself even further, I drew nearer to God. I told myself go and use that opportunity and live it out, and show His great love that He poured out for all.  Sharing maybe hard for me, but I know now what I got into. It’s His work and His will. Doing everything for Him always serves a greater purpose.  “God works through different men in different ways, but in the same God who achieves his purpose through them all.” 1 Corinthians 12:6 (Ph)   What’s Up?  Let’s just say this Freshman year has gone by quickly and well. I was on the varsity golf team at Campolindo. I also joined Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Crossbears. God has showed me so many things this year. When I’m about to fall He’s always there to pick me up. What a awesome God we have! He has taught me to be more content, humble, and patient with my life and the things that I do. He will meet my every need.   Join Me!  Many people have different situations in life, but there are people cheering and encouraging us to go on. Since we do have the summer Olympics this year, will you please team up with me? I would love it if you took time to support me in the days to come and in the fields. I would like it if you would pray that I can (1) trust and remember God is in control at all times, and that it’s His will, that He will put together all the details of the trip, that He may guide me through the challenges I face as I go, (2) that my heart will be prepared to serve and freely flowing for others, (3) that I can be a faithful servant in all my actions, words, and lifestyle, (3) that I would be willing and open to take “leaps of faith” when God calls me, even if I’m scared, and (4) that financially, God will provide for me, as this trip does have a high price. Please consider supporting me and returning the enclosed reply card by July 1st. Mahalo from the heart! (We will be teaching this Hawaiian phrase to the Mexicans, meaning “thank you”).   										Sister In Christ, 										Christina Gee  If you have any questions, please contact me! Christina Gee 3535 Brook Street #13 Lafayette, CA 94549 (925)348-4750 penguingolfer89@lycos.com  Or just come and talk to me about the trip!

         Daycamp and Mission Update      I can complain and complain. I guess sometimes you don't know little things until someone points it out to you. I'm stressed and mad. I think it's rubbing off. I am trying to get things settled. But leaders in my group are stressing me out more than ever. I think I'm just about to go bye bye. Sigh. I need to get through this. Bad part is it's only the 2nd week! Maybe it's just the long hours, the food, and the hours of sleep I get. It's hectic for me. I have to get up early and then my body is like no energy. Endurance. KEEP ON....    So I have 10 more days til the mission trip to Mexico! I am excited! I can't wait! I need the break. I think also I need to work with younger kids. I'm all stressed out by the 6-8 my head started hurting and stomich too. Also we went Ice Skating today that was fun stuff.    So the medical part of this trip is really bugging me. I don't get it. I already got my Hep A and now Kaiser wants to give me all these other meds. I think I can survive.    So also things are going to be much more different in Mexico. I need to remember to drink water. I'm on it now....2 things of Nalgene and I'm good. Also wearing sunscreen and hat and sunglasses.    Please pray that I won't be too stressed out on the missions trip. I feel like I'm really stressing. Also that daycamp is going to be a little more mellow these next couple of weeks.

      When the tough times come along. I need to endure. I really have been complaining a lot. I need to lighten up. It's not even about my missions trip. I've been thinking long and hard about daycamp more than my missions trip. Oh well. I was about to give up my missions trip...But you know what..I need a break. Whether it really is a break or not...I call it one. I mean yes more kids. But what other opportunities will I take. Many people think all summer is for me is another stress factor. I can agree with that some times. But is stress really a big deal...Well maybe in the long run for me emotionally...Will stress get in the way...? Every summer so far I've been stressed out. Many people think I need to take a lower key and not try to do so much...But is daycamp and a missions trip and summer school really too much? I don't think so...If I can't do it Christ will help me! Today when I woke up I felt really I mean really bad....And even through out the day I was about to call Kaiser.  God works in many ways. Whether I see it or not. I think for me...My relationship with God has gotten stronger. I think starting next year or after this summer I can start writing some of my sermons and stuff/lessons. I'm all about hitting it hard. So for this next week and the week to come I'm going to be hitting it hard....and harder than ever!   Please pray for me as I try to hit it up with his will and power that I will obey and follow and not get booted out of line. Thanks be to God! For He gives us the victory though JC! Daycamp is stressing me out...I think since last Thursday I've been crying. So I need to get back and seek and...ok tomorrow I need to wake up and endure long hours again. I hope everybody elses' summer is going ok. Of course mine is book being a servant. But being a servant is the only thing I want to do for you Lord! Well that with worshiping the Awesome God of Love and obeying and listening. Live it out and pumping up my faith at the same time!   Thanks to God for showing me new things everyday and giving me opportunities to live out my faith for others.  Xtina Is out being a servant

      So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! 1 Corinthians 10:12    I think this was one of my biggest mistakes in my prayer letter. If you think you are standing firm becareful. I think I am standing firm but that is one of my biggest mistakes I said or have said in awhile. Wow what does firm really mean? I guess sometimes I think I'm on the right track and trying to do all these things I don't realize what will or has happened to me.     It also saids: No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. 1 Cor 10:13    I guess I too can be tempted. I think right now it's a time of prayer and if I do reconsider in the next 2 weeks not to go then I will see. Please continue praying as I am stressed out and have no idea what to do...But the Lord will lead...and I will follow..

      I am really thinking and reconsidering. I am reconsidering if I should go or not to Mexico. I know it does sound pretty stupid. But I'm tired, and not really up to speed on sleep and other things. Ok I really don't know what to do anymore. HELP!!!!

      1 more month til the trip. I have almost all the music down. The language is coming long ok. I think I need to practice speaking more Spanish now.   Prayer Request: Right now that my heart will be ready to serve on the mission trip, and that next week that my heart will be ready to serve also for daycamp.   Also that God will lead me and that I really won't ditch Him. I feel alittle bit like falling so I need to really get closer. These last weeks I was even thinking of pulling out of the missions trip. So hopefully God will lead me to which direction to take. I mean I already started the process so hopefully I can finish it.  Also financally I'm doing ok for this trip. I've really thought long and hard about Retreat. It's the week before school starts and I don't think I'll have enough money to cover that so I guess all I can do is pray. Plus I don't like to ask people for financial help. So the prayer letter that I sent out it didn't talk about any financial aid, but if I get something meraculously, I would be thankful. I think I've been spending too much money on food and gifts for others. Does food add up or what!?
