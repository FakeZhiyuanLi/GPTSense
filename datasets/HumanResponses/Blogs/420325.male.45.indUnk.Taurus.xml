      Oh my God. Sometimes that's all I got to say when I get to this place. She's wearing a simple beige strapless dress with dangerous heels. That would be Savannah. She adjusts it as she walks away. Holy crap. Now I've got a crick in my neck.  So begins tonight's talent report. It's taking me a moment to scan the rest of the girls because I keep looking up and she's still walking around. It's like a tunnel vision. OK, she's behind the bar. Vision clears.  There's Luan. I've seen this dress before, and it was one that she wore one evening that was identical to Savannah's. It's clingy black with white lace on the shoulders and for little flaps on the bottom at the front and back. It draws the eye in all the right directions and there's that crick again. And now Savannah's back just standing in front of me, posing, hip jutting, teasing the fella's at the table across the way before she hands over the checker board, or whatever it is they play here. OK. She just went behind the bar again, so I should be able to refocus and find Tee.  I saw Tee out of the corner of my eye a minute ago, there. Tee, no glasses tonight, and dark eye makeup. A sultry look for her, as she's usually bouncy and bright. I can see the changes since she's been here, learning the ropes, picking it up in the outfit department. In the beginning you could see the struggle to find something to wear to fit in. The real difference between this place and the few others like it that I've occasioned, is that these girls dress like women, not girls. She's in black, and she's done something with her short hair, kinda wild. It's good. The dress has straps tied behind her neck, and there is a small v cut into the top in front. Some Spanish style frills at the back adding some appreciated volume to the back yard, a little flouncy something to follow around with the old eyeballs. I now spy Tina sitting behind the bar with Savannah. It looks like white from here. I'll have to wait a minute or two for full disclosure.  Minute's up. Tina can't wear a bad thing, and she's not. It's a white top with spaghetti straps paired with a light blue and white print skirt. Very feminine. Pretty. Ruffles in the same material on the bottom. Long thin stems stolen from a couple of champagne glasses. I'm hipmotyzed. But Savannah wins. Hands down. Tonight.  It's nice that tonight has been such a special effort for my entertainment, because, folks, this will be the last bulletin from the front lines for at least a week. I'm heading out of town, and though it will be a good trip, it will be that much less, because I can't take this place with me. No wireless. Not even broadband. No coffee banana shakes. No rocket fuel doped coffee. No big screen Laker games. And no insanely hot Vietnamese girls serving me tea. I'm bringing my own smokes so I won't go bankrupt buying them there, but I can smoke damn near anywhere, for the moment, which is the last redeeming value of the land called Jersey. I would weep, but I don't want my view distorted until I have to drive home.   It looks like the evil Sack-o-tomatoes Kings are losing to the Bucks. Yes! Time to check the standings. All right. If the Lakers can win tomorrow without Kobe, the Kings are beatable for first place. Not likely, but second place is for sure not out of reach. If the Lakers finish strong it should shake the Kings up just enough to make them easier to kill, especially if the whole wrecking crew is healthy, or at least out of jail for the showdown. Back when I first heard about the new lineup last year, I laughed out loud for days. This wasn't fair to the other teams. Who could have predicted the wacky meltdown that includes Kobe facing life in prison? I know, I know, anybody who's been watching for more than two seasons. But really, it's nutty, no?   Ciao for Niao.

      I have been pondering the wisdom of linking to my other blog. Yesterday I did it in a post. Now I'm going to put it on the blogroll. The two blogs are pretty different, this one being the more fun and silly of the two, at least that was the plan. But, what the fuck, sometimes things happen that I can't keep my mouth shut about. So just like Glenn Reynolds does, and that fellow Lileks, I'm linking to the other place that nobody reads and I don't get paid for.  Talent report: (Even though I'm actually waiting for Ed to get here so we can go get some chow). It's Tee working the glasses. It's white night and she's got the high collar blouse on as well as Farm Girl, who took my order tonight for the first time ever. I had to ask her to wipe the crap off the table though so it wouldn't get all over the laptop. Luan the sweet came over and made the same hand motion that I made to Farm Girl, smiled, and set me up. I heart Luan. Savannah, Miss Vietnam is in tonight looking smashing as is the no longer mysterious youngster. I found out the other night while sitting at the bar and eavesdropping that spring break is coming up, which means we get to see more of her. Um, more meaning more of the time. She's still a 'good girl,' and her family comes to pick her up after her shift, which ends long before the place closes.  The Lakers are playing the Bucks and the game is pretty close at the half. Savannah just told me that she wants pasta. It's all about the pasta. It looks like I'm going to squeeze Ed to go get Italian tonight. I don't know any good Italian places down here, I have to go to Eagle Rock (Pizza, hmm) or Burbank for pasta and veal. Anybody reading from the east coast knows that you can spit in any direction in NY/NJ and have it hit a decent pizza joint, and you can hit a decent Italian restaurant with a stone from the same spot. It doesn't work that way in L.A. I can count on one hand the decent places, (I have six fingers on my left hand) and two of them are mucho Lira. Euro.   I must have not seen the score well enough, the Lakers are up by ten at the beginning of the third. I'll post later if Ed scares up a nice plate of spaghetti and meat balls.

      Poor Courtney Love is being bandied about the  urlLink press  (courtesy of the charming Gail)[Ed. What, no link?-Hey, she won't get a damn blog, want her email?]. It's hard to be a rock and roller these days. Everyone stares if you whip a tit out. It used to be just good plain fun, like when whatsername did gigs wearing nothing but electrical tape (ouch-that must have hurt). Now, whether you are the sister of the king o pop or just a poor rock and roll widow, people talk.  I think though, that we've become jaded. The first thing I read about when JJ flopped her studded pancake onto the tube was, "They're not real," and then, "They are real, just look at them." In Courtney's case, they are so-not-real I would recommend a lawsuit. I know strippers that have sued for less, and they're not even porn stars. They did a reasonable job on her mug, but the boobs? Ugh. It's a mockery of the female form.  So kids, just lay off will ya? If you had to look at those things in the mirror every day, what would you do? She's sharing, and as the shrinky class would say, that's good. Go ahead Courtney, get it off your chest. Literally. Get a new Doctor.

      Boy, I just finished one of my devastating political pieces on the other blog. My brain gets sore when I take on the powerful special interests and political class and the major media and all the other guys that rule the world. I'm just lucky, I guess, that the only other blog that I know of that gets read less than that  urlLink one  is this one. Otherwise the keepers of the patriot act would find me despite the tin foil and sentence me to weeks of indoctrination reading the New York Times. Frightening.  But, as it were, I'm safe here at Lu's, slopping whipped cream and bananas into my mouth. It's crowded again on this lovely southern California evening. As you might have guessed if you've been paying attention, I'm enjoying another Coffee/Banana shake, courtesy of the lovely Savannah. I'm kind of stuffed in the middle of the crowd tonight, as both the corner and bar are occupado. It actually feels as cramped as a cross country Continental Airlines cattle flight. It's not, of course, being that I'm not burning someone's elbow with my cigarette. Speaking of which.  I get to fly the very satisfactory  urlLink Jet Blue  to the Motherland of New Jersey this coming Wednesday evening. The moment I touch down, the street price of a pack of righteous smokes doubles. And that's just New York. When I get to Jersey a carton of Muds runs a bargain minimum of 45 smackeroos. They must pay well there. So, it occurs to me to provide a public service to all the suffering smokers (no-not the ones suffering from lung cancer-the ones still breathing). Go  urlLink here . No, really, go  urlLink here  dummies.  I now smoke Pall Malls. Filters. Don't laugh until you've tried them. I smoked Muds (Marlboro) for 25 years, until I decided in a fit of pique to quit. When I inevitably recommenced puffing, I had the wacky idea to change brands, and hit upon the idea of Camel filters. I've always experimented with the occasional Dunhill, Winston or Parliament, and the Camels were pretty good, and young people stared and hip people turned me on to Chesterfields and, I must say, it was my wild years of smoking. That lasted about 5 years (the madness had to end) until a wild hair told me to ask the tobacconist what else was worthwhile. Bingo.  "Burns like a Marlboro, draws like a Camel." Or the other way around. That was the pitch, and a buck cheaper. "They're new, the filters." I bought a pack, and the rest is smoky blue history. If you click on the links above you will find that a carton costs $19.99. No shit. They'll even ship to the Motherland. They don't have all the brands. My buddy can't get non-filter Camels, and his friend can't get Tarytons, but if your purse is getting light, and you're in the land of no-fault insurance and the subsequent surcharges, click boy click!  I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming, and I'll return to my shake. And I mean that in the best way.

      One of the difficulties that occasionally arise when you hang out in a place where most people don't speak your language is that someone ultimately tries to do so anyway. I have a new pal James. He has one of those Handspring  urlLink phones  that he just got today and was showing it off with some of the thickest Engrish that I've heard in some time. The problem was that he actually knows the language, and speaks as fast as a teenage girl on a new cellphone. "What?" As I shake my head in incomprehension.  I did find out that he's going to take a class to learn how to use the dadblurn thing. He's also a photographer. I gave him Ed's phone number and email from his web site. James got all excited when I showed him Ed's custom racing steering wheel. Just for the halibut, here's Ed's  urlLink site  Go  urlLink here  to see his custom molded to your own damn grimy hands steering wheel. It's the round thing on the left.  It's after 11 PM and I've already burned through one battery and I'm now on the crappy one that can't make up its mind about when it's going to crap out. Usually it's at about 30%, but lately it's been disappearing my screen at around 40%. I'm at 70% now, so finishing this post should be no problem. I hope. The place is still half full, which is unusual, as after a Laker game it normally becomes a ghost town. Maybe it being Friday has something to do with it. Don't these people have lives?  My other new friend is the security guard. It's always good to be friends with the security guard. Just so's I can continue to be friends with him I'll stop blogging about him now cause he's sitting right next to me. Later.

      I sat at the bar tonight, Friday, as it's damn crowded in here. The mysterious youngster took my order, and, lo and behold, Savannah delivered it with, "There. That's what a drink is supposed to look like." I must agree, but, of course, I left the camera at home. Let me describe it to you-creamy chocolate mocha in color, swirl o whipped cream with sliced bananas arranged tastefully around one side, spoon and straw not quite opposite, cherry perched with authority, with the stem just off-set in my direction for easy plucking. Yummy! Coffee banana!  This is all topped off by being seated just above the rest of the crowd under one of the smaller TV's that nobody pays attention to, with a view into the kitchen where the gals works da liquid culinary magic of the far east meets west coast west. Baby coffee girl behind the counter has a rocking disposition, if you know what I mean, dressed all hostess-like with a mid calf length skirt and conservative, yet sleeveless top.  The big girls are all wearing some version of denim. Two have seriously abbreviated Daisy Dukes, two have eliminated all pretext of shorts by making micro minis out of what used to be shorts, and one has added a pleated bottom that moves all dizzy-like (wait, that's me that's getting dizzy). The pleated one is my girl Tee. She's sporting the eyewear again tonight, obviously opting to see, but hitting the repressed librarian note on pitch. Tina, superstar that she is, is wearing a thick pink studded belt about half the width of her micro.  It's 0-2 Lakers v Clippers, the game just started, all is right with the world. Later.  Immediate and Important Update: Savannah just bent over to reveal that she managed to fit shorts under her skirt to preserve her virtue just in case she slips and goes legs akimbo. Thank you Jesus.  Further Update: Dereck Fischer is off the hook!

      I must be lame. I'm home again with a gut full of pizza. The new kind from Pizza Hut with the four squares that you can have all different ways. It's kinda cool actually. For crap pizza, that is. I went to Lu's this morning with Ed. Ed is the white guy that goes to Lu's in the morning; I'm the white guy that goes to Lu's in the evening. That's how you can tell us apart. But we figured we could play a trick on the girls and see if they would mix us up.  It's different in the morning. I insisted that we sit outside in the sun, mostly to prove to myself that I am NOT turning into a vampire like my friend's wife has been claiming recently, but also because I felt slightly concerned about Ed's smoke inhalation factor. The last time we went together in the evening, Ed had to take a ten minute break outside to hack the little black lugies out. It was really crowded that night and I must have decided it was a chain smoking event, and as he went from pale to green he mumbled something about 'air' and stumbled toward the door. Problem is, this morning Ed almost strained a neck muscle turning and peering in the door at the girls. As I don't think he has medical insurance, I think he would rather die a slow death from asphyxiation than not be able to lick the candy with his eyes  Nice part of the day is I saw my mean little minx with the infinitely long legs, Jeannie. I had grown accustomed to seeing Jeannie in the evenings, and then she up and disappeared. Turns out she was only filling in on nights. As well as being one of the more gorgeous of the ladies, she has an on/off mean switch that has to be experienced. She does not suffer fools, nor feau-pax, and I have left there with flesh wounds from a violent glance after questioning one of her drinks. She was my favorite until she vanished.  My new favorite, Savannah, has pronounced that she will make my next drink, because the last one that I had, looked terrible. You can see a picture of it in a post below. Before I left the other night she had noticed my camera, and I showed her the picture I took. I promise that the moment I get her to pose for me, you will be, um, informed. May as well spell check this thing, and to post. Cheers.

      I've decided to take the night off and stay at home. I know. Slacker, loser, whatever. But I do plan to watch the second half of the Lakers game in a few minutes. Which brings me to your consolation prize.  urlLink Here  are the Minnesota Timberwolves dance team. They don't play the Lakers at home again this regular season, so you won't see them (the dance team, dummy) unless you're a local. Highly recommended.

      Sad day today. CHuck Niles, the  urlLink voice  of jazz in L.A. died last night. I heard it on the radio on the way home from Lu's last night. He died peacefully.     Here tonight I'm working on some embarassing pictures of my friend Mike's wife washing my car. It goes without saying that she'll never do it again, but it's fun to make fun. As proof of working my fingers to the bone I provide the following picture of my typical evening office scene, minus of course, the hard working girls that endeavor to serve me sustanence, as I don't want them to throw me out.    This is also an experiment in my html skills to see if I can actually get these pictures to post on the blog. For Ed, the evening talent report (to be a regular feature, as Ed needs to know) as follows: Tee, looking lovely in some dress of some color that I forget the name of. Mauve? Who knows? They add a drop of blue and discover a new color that I haven't a clue. This is from a sculptor, not a painter. 2D is still very confusing to me. Luan is in a black number with lace fringe on the shoulders and in two patches on the back and front of the bottom, very sexy. This is doubly nice because Savannah is wearing the exact same outfit. Bloody twins. There is also the dull one. I only call her that because she doesn't speak a lick of English, and doesn't appear that she wants to. She subsequently presents a blank look as she walks by. Ed and I think that she's a farmgirl from the old country. She gets along well enough with the locals. Well, back to work. I'm also going to work on the short story tonight. I'm kind of stuck, and I need to make some sort of breakthrough soon, or I'm going to junk it, or file it somewhere on the computer that it will turn up a year from now during one of my "what the fuck is this?" phases as I clear out the hard drive.  Update: wtf happened to the second picture? It looks like I applied some kind of artsy Photoshop filter to it. I didn't. I just made it smaller than it was so it would load on the site faster. Oh well, next time.

      The Lakers are losing in the second quarter, although they are only down by ten now instead of the twenty they were in the first. Tee is wearing glasses tonight, and has that sexy librarian vibe going on. It’s a decent crowd for a Monday, girls are here with their dates and Boss Lady looks happy. I made the mistake of sitting at a table away from the wall because it looked like a slow night when I got here, and now I have people sitting behind me and I have that eerie feeling of someone looking over my shoulder reading this crap.  I just posted to my other site some thoughts about the Spanish elections and the bombings a few days ago, and my brain hurts. I just want to fuzz out and not think about bug things, but the damn world intrudes. I’ve found the recipe for forcing myself to write, that is, spending my time here amidst a bunch of sexy girls drinking fruit shakes and tea, getting in about three hours a day until the battery runs down.  The Laker girls are wearing some kind of black and gold outfit that I don’t remember seeing before, and I approve. I wish the guys would get their act together as well. They look like this is the first quarter of a pickup game and they’ve never played together before. Malone looks awesome just being on the floor though, and I can’t wait to see this team in the playoffs.  I’m going to post this crap now, and take care of some email, and then watch the rest of the game. Aren’t you excited you stopped by? Come back tomorrow and you’ll see more of the same.

      Sunday night at Lu’s. This is the second installment of Hack Café, and it has a good sendoff, though you can’t see it. Boss Lady just came by and patted my shoulder and said again she likes my computer. I can still smell her perfume a full minute after she left. And that’s a good thing. Boss Lady is easily a beauty pageant winner, and she schmoozes like a pro. You fella’s out there that like Asian women would seriously be feeling good right now if Hua was just squeezing your shoulder.  There’s also new talent here tonight and I’ll have to find out her name. Luan just came by and smiled. Damn, I wish she spoke some English. My waitress for the evening will be Savannah, as she brought me my avocado shake and poured tea. She also reminded me not to spill it, as I happened to knock a full pot off the table last night. She’s a helper this one is. It’s her way of showing me she’s paying attention.  Tonight, maybe it’s because of my location, everybody seems to want to see what I’m writing. They will have to stop and stare though because I’ve got the type set small enough that a quick drive-by ain’t gonna cut it. Couple of white guys in here this evening. They all seem to look ex-military to me. That is, the guys that I see in the coffee bars. They’re all kind of big with short haircuts and serious expressions, intent on low conversations or studiously examining the Jazz game on the tube.  Ed says that most of the girls when they first see a white guy come in here that they think he’s a cop. I can see that. Nobody in their right mind would think of me as a cop, even though I work hard on my now diminished pot belly. I had it going there for a while to the point that I could fool small children into thinking that I was pregnant. No more. My few months of toil as a strike breaker at the local Ralph’s had me on my feet for more hours a day than I’ve seen since 1983. That and the fact that I worked in the produce department had me eating fresh fruit instead of cheezits has ruined me for the foreseeable future.  Now I live on a diet of coffee and the rocket fuel that they serve here at Lu’s, as well as the occasional fruit based concoction. Or this annoyingly good avocado shake. Another food item that I’d have never thought of stuffing into my face until I got to California, and then I couldn’t avoid it. And tea. I drink way too much of this Chinese tea that they serve here. Last night I nursed my rocket fuel all night and went through three pots of tea. Including most of one that went on the floor, but still. I also found out for sure that even if I nurse a single coffee all night here, if I don’t cut it with something thick, I ain’t going to sleep. At the tender age of forty-four, I still haven’t figured out that coffee keeps me awake.  I’m going to screw around with the template here on blogger and see if I can get the email address on the sidebar. The fuckers at Hotmail decided that Hack Café was out of bounds for an address, seemingly as Hack is a dirty word. So we’ve got Hak-café, as that was the only remedy I could come up with without timing out on the registration process. I expect that this will cause problems for some people interested enough to email me, thanks Microsoft.

      Welcome to my new blog that is totally irrelevant in the big scheme of things, and I'm comfortable with that. It's about my mostly daily visits to a Vietnamese style coffee bar in Southern California and my attempts to hack out some kind of writing project. I have another blog that I try to talk about important things like all the other grownups (one of my 'writing' projects), but this one is just for the hell of it.  I think that a lot of writers have visions of visiting foreign lands, soaking up the experience, and transforming that into the 'novel' or foreign dispatch for the local newspaper. There was a TV show a few years back that had a guy from New Jersey (Fisher Stevens) winning the lottery, quitting his job and going to Key West to follow in the footsteps of Hemmingway. He loses the money to the IRS or some such, and winds up hacking out crap for a pittance for the local Yammerer. It inspired me. This then, is my sad attempt to imitate a bad TV show about of a guy doing a bad imitation of Hemmingway, but without the exotic locale or crappy job. Or the hooker with the heart of gold-Jennifer Tilly.  I've been keeping a quasi-journal of sorts that I find amusing re-reading, as it is fresh (bad, but fresh) as it was not meant for anyone to read. I know I'm ruining it as now I'll have in the back of my mind that someone might stumble across it and actually read it. But at least for the first post, it's not edited, and I wrote it before I decided to post it. Here goes.  Relaxing Saturday night at Lu’s. Waiting for the red underline for that first sentence from the grammar watchers at Microsoft, and it doesn’t appear. Funny, it doesn’t look right. It’s quiet, my next door neighbors are watching college ball on the tube, the Lakers beat the Bulls today, and all is right with the world.  The music is poppy Vietnamese pap, not quite annoying, but close. We’re starting out with iced rocket fuel and hot tea tonight, and we’re early, as it’s only 9:18 PM and at 71% battery power, with midnight far away. I won’t last nearly that long. I’m already having a craving for a Wendy’s burger.  The girls are in their whites tonight, and looking as lovely as ever. It’s not so busy, and Tea asked if it’s normally like this on Saturdays. I forget that I’ve now been coming here as long as or longer than three of the girls have worked here. Looking back to the first thing I wrote it’s been….just over a month. Not long. Not long at all.  Staff tonight: Tina, Tea, Savannah (Bitchy, Witchy, Miss Vietnam, but really Vietnamese name Van [spelling] and Anglicized Savannah), Hua (Boss Lady), Luan and the ever mysterious youngster (drop dead) that lives behind the bar. I think she’ related to the Boss Lady, or maybe her partner, and is either training for a life as a coffee girl/coffee bar manager or watching the till.  I wish I could get pictures to show you, but that’s going to take a while. I’ve already had bad thoughts that I will someday have to move away from here, and I’ll have to give up my life as a coffee swilling girl gawking aspiring hack writer.

      This was just too much to resist: "Maybe they should just work it out so that the Lakers play every Sunday until the rest of the summer," said one network executive who didn't want to be identified.  Before the playoffs began, NBA commissioner David Stern said in half-jest on ESPN that the best matchup for the finals would be "the Lakers against the Lakers."  This, apparently, is Plan 1-B.   LA Daily News on the NBA  urlLink shifting games around  to squeeze the most broadcast money out of the Lakers.

      Still no Internet connection at Lu’s. I’m going to have to make one of my daylight excursions to see if I can find who the IT guru is. Some guys have staked out my usual corner area of operation tonight. I’m sitting right in the middle right in front of the Big big screen TV and facing the opposite way from normal. It feels funny. The big game on the tube is the Kings v. Mavericks. I don’t know where in the series they are, but it’s got to be getting close. At the half the Kings are down by three, but they look good. Dallas looks OK too and both teams are at a 100-point plus pace. The two teams have perhaps the most colorful owners in basketball, The cheerleading Malouf Brothers of the Kings, and Mark Cuban of the Mavericks, always flying the bird at the refs and b-ball establishment. He even has his own  urlLink blog!   The girls have the grownup garb going on tonight. Little black dresses and matching ensembles you may find at a cocktail party or a nightclub. Even Luan has the attitude going on in her black dress. Tina has a sparkly aqua hot-pants thing going on (say Hot Pants), and the new girl has it going on in soft beige that falls over her curves in a way that says “thank you for wearing me.” I’m looking the other way, as I said, so I can’t get a look at the bar unless I turn around in my chair. It puts a real cramp in my ogling style. I just craned my neck and came into direct eye contact with Savannah leaning on the bar, so I winked at her and set her off laughing. I’ll prefer to think that that was a good thing. When she comes around again on the guitar I’ll study her evening wear in a more measured manner. So far I can only tell that it’s a short dress with an interesting pattern, kind of modern art-ish and well fitted.  The place is crowded around the main TV areas tonight, and rather skimpy around the edges. I could probably now go stake a claim in the corner diagonal to my regular haunt, but it’s one of those corners that never get served. Bad Feng Shui over there. I would also have to look all the way across the room to see the tube, or sit with my head twisted up like the front row of the movie theater. It’s a corner for plans and conspiracy, properly used by nefarious types to dream up schemes of riches and world domination. I’ve learned though, the hard way, that conspiracy requires conspirators, and they are usually the downfall of any plan, no matter how well laid. There’s a damn book! Or at least a short story.   Which reminds me, I’ve got to get back to the story I started writing here a couple of months ago. It’s about a guy that gets involved with a coffee girl against his better judgment, and, well, I don’t know exactly yet. I haven’t finished it.  Update: 119-118 Sack-O-Tomatoes. It’s over. Kings take the first round.

      72-57. The Rockets scored only nine points in the third quarter. They were up by one after both the first quarter and at the half. Malone has fire running in his veins. After being charged with a foul that he didn’t think he deserved, Bruce Banner would have been proud. He damn near ripped off his own uniform and let out a scream at heaven itself. I’m blogging at home tonight so no talent report, sorry, I know you’re bummed.  Shaq isn’t laying down tonight either. He just passed Larry Bird on the all time playoff list for most points scored to take the number five position. He also has four blocked shots. Kobe started the day in court in Colorado, played three minutes and sat down. He has since put on a clinic and has 29 points and ten assists as well as 6 rebounds. Make that 31 points.  Now it’s just ugly.  Final, 97-78. Next stop San Antonio.  Watched all the post game stuff, and then caught the Channel 13 News at 11. I’ve always thought that Lauren Sanchez was smoking hot but, holy crap, it's a regular babe-fest. What have I been watching? Oh yeah, computer screen.

      I’m totally bummed. Second night in a row that I can’t get on the Internet at Lu’s. Full signal and all that, just no network connection. I’m even more bummed though, because my Director friend was here until just moments ago with his laptop, and he was surfing away. I haven’t seen him in months as he’s been working on a movie as Director of Photography using his new digital camera. I remember feeling vastly superior as he struggled to get connected with his Windows machine, dicking around with settings and jiggling is wireless card in the slot on the side, rebooting and looking frustrated. “Yeah, all I do is click, and I’m on.” Karma sucks I tell ya.  I asked him if the producers of the movie had put up a web site yet, and he said he didn’t know anything except all they were going to enter it in the gay and lesbian film festival. He said he spent a lot of time laying around in bed with a bunch of beautiful women, and that paid him a lot of attention, but only because he could make them look good. It didn’t appear that he suffered too much.  I don’t even remember at this point if I uploaded last night’s entry when I got home. When I got there my roommate was still awake and wanting to yak about school and a job that was open and wanted my opinion on his version of an email cover letter. He usually writes well enough, but this time it sucked, and I made the mistake of telling him so, minus the sugar. I was up until 2, and catching some real attitude. Having opened my mouth I had to see it through until we had a good version. By then I was exhausted. I’ve also been working on a post for the other site for three days that was just not coming together. I needed to look up urls for it, and not having Internet access last night didn’t help.  I’ve found that writing for the Internet really sucks if you’re not connected. Half of the fun is pointing out other sites, which means surfing and checking links. Being that I usually only work on this site when I’m here, I can’t even check what I wrote the day before or see what comments were posted until after I’ve already written today’s post and ready to upload. And you thought I didn’t repeat myself on purpose.  But enough about me, who is working tonight? Tee came over and asked, “You want a shake, right?” meaning do I want my coffee fuel straight with ice (it’s a hot day today) or blended? “I want coconut,” which is what I usually have on hot days. Wrinkled forehead, frown, slumped shoulders. She already had someone making it. Apologies, it’s all right, really? no really, it’s OK, sorry, no problem, etc. Tee is wearing a white summery halter dress tonight with peek-a-boo holes in the side above her waist. It has gold trim and has a big gold bow tied behind her neck. Needless to say it’s short and sexy, and well worth the material that had to die in order for her to wear it. I’m guessing that she’s shift supervisor tonight, which makes me realize that she’s pretty much got seniority over everyone else here except Luan, who is operating the cash register. They grow up so fast. I remember her first night. She’s sans glasses tonight and has done something special with her eye makeup, which is quite nice.  Luan is wearing one of my favorite dresses, for her. It’s a hound’s-tooth dark gray and white, and also is a halter. The notable feature is the deep plunging neckline that stops just above her belly button, and has black laces keeping the two sides from busting apart, pun very much intended. As she walks by or loiters at nearby tables, it’s hard to keep your eyes from trying to see the rest of what is almost there, but not quite. Kind of like looking at a 2D image and trying to crane your neck to see behind what you really know is flat, but don’t want it to be. Only more maddening. This kind of outfit only works with really young and taught bodies, or with enhanced breasts that have a tendency to stay put in the first place. Thank God for modern elective medicine.  Nice Jeannie is cute tonight. She brought me my coffee shake and we had a round of “I can make you a different one if you want,” “no that’s fine,” “no really” etc. It was actually a longer exchange than the one I had with Tee, and this time my Director friend actually chimed in once or twice. It was heading into Abbot and Costello territory by the time I grabbed the cherry off the top and settled the question, but it was a lot nicer to look at. She is wearing a white stretchy tube top thingy and a pink miniskirt with pleats and her hair straight down her back and has a tendency to sway around tables as she navigates the floor. She’s tall and thin and reminds one of a single sheaf of wheat swaying in a soft breeze. But with a sweet rack.  Rounding out our staff this evening is a relatively new girl whose name I haven’t gotten yet. I’ve seen her around a couple of times, but not all the time. She might come from the day crew or just be part time. She could be a big sister to Jeannie. There are tight outfits, and then there are tight outfits. The one that she is wearing is one of the latter. She’s got curves too. The most notable of which is a sweet round belly. Most all of the girls here have stomachs as opposed to bellies. They are tight, flat, defined; curving with the body into the hips and booty well enough, but typical of youth or an expensive gym membership. This one has personality and needs special attention. The rest of her isn’t skin and bones either, and if her burnt peach outfit had just a little bit more tan in it, she would be effectively naked. It’s one of those two-piece off the shoulder ensembles that have these little short sleeves attached to the side of her top, which you can picture if you take two even brush strokes across her body at the waist and bust. Now imagine that those two brush strokes are latex and then you take a heat gun to it until it shrinks and squeezes its contents until they want to bubble up out of it. I swear I don’t know how they do it. I don’t see any mirrors. She’s also wearing a pink chrysanthemum on her left hip that seems to be enjoying the ride.   Nope, still no Internet connection. I’m taping 24 right now, I hope. A couple of weeks ago, as I was coming out of my coma I realized that all of my clocks weren’t showing the same time. I had missed the changeover to daylight savings time. Some of them, had changed automatically, so for at least a couple of days things didn’t always make sense. I missed episodes from my two favorite TV shows that week in the confusion.  The Nuggets and T-Wolves are on the tube here at the café tonight. I’d tell you all about where they are in the playoff series, but I can’t fucking get to their web sites, or ESPN, or any damn other place. I’m guessing game five, but the TNT on-screen graphic isn’t giving me a clue. The T-Wolves were favored to win this series, but from what I’ve been seeing out of the corner of my eye, Denver isn’t playing according to script. At least not tonight. I take that back now, Minnesota just stole the ball and are up by eight points in the fourth quarter. Sprewell is sitting on the bench as I write this. When I first looked up I noticed him on the floor, and he looked like he was hanging around the schoolyard. I noticed because I’ve seen him play live before. My boss got tickets to a Lakers game at the Forum and we were only a couple of rows off the floor behind the away team’s bench, which was this evening the Golden State Warriors. A good year or two before he attempted to strangle his coach and was exiled to the NY Nick(erbocker)s I remember thinking of him as a big cat. He played close to the floor with long legs and long arms and seemed to run circles around some of the other players. His movement was fluid and he was the fastest player on the pine. Other than the big deal and excitement of going to a Laker game, the Laker girls, the massive quantity of flesh that is Shaq (this was pre-Kobe), Sprewell’s was the image that I came away with. He’s back on the court now, and I’m guessing that the coach had a word with him, and he noticed the score advance while he was lounging about, because he just exploded, even though he missed the shot. Problem is, he has to make the shot. It’s now a three point game.  We’re down to three girls and less than five minutes in the fourth, and this post is beyond long. I’m actually boring myself. I’ll post the final score before I upload.  Update: This is game 4. Minnesota leads the series 2-1. Update: 84-82. Minnesota leads the series 3-1. Update: I never did upload last night’s post. You’ll find it below.

      It’s weird. I have a full signal on the old wireless antenna, but I can’t connect to the Internet. So something is kerflooey in the back where they make the donuts, er, sausages, er, shakes. No matter, I can still write and post later. Yesterday started with a phone message from Zora. “Pete,” (please imagine thick Bulgarian accent) “Are you coming today? What is story? I don’t hear from you.” I forgot.  The night before, the last words from Savannah were, “Will you be here tomorrow?” I was kind of taken back. “Of course I’ll be here tomorrow.” I had planned to be here anyway, but during the day, to watch the Lakers. She works nights, so I had been mentally adjusting my schedule for the day to at least get an overlap of her shift in. A woman like Savannah asks if you’re going to be around, you answer yes. Or you’re a dork.  “Hi Zora, I just got up.” “What do you mean? You live like King! When are you coming, I have to make plans.” “I thought that you had no plans today, that’s why I’m coming over.” “I might have to go to the store, you know.” “Two o’clock, OK?” “OK.” It was noon. I forgot the Lakers were on in half an hour and got ready to drive over to San Pedro. It wasn’t until I was cursing the traffic in Long Beach that I remembered the game. Some radio announcer said we were going into half time up two points. Shit.  It had been so long since I’ve been to Zora’s that I got lost for a minute. Couple of extra turns got me to the compound entrance.     My guide Kai got a little ahead of me and had to wait.   Hi Zora!    After long lost greetings Zora showed me her current project, hand made tiles based on the Kama Sutra.    That’s all very nice Zora, would you excuse me for a moment? Fourth quarter, Lakers down by six. The TV stayed on. The only good thing I can say about dial up Internet is that it’s slow. We talked about setting up a web site to show her tiles, and while waiting for the pages to load, I went out to catch snatches of the game. That all changed when I was loading up an Amazon Z Shop page and I caught the Lakers walking off the floor after regulation with a tie score. Overtime. We watched the game after that.  Karl Malone’s jersey was ripped. Yao and Shaq each had 5 fouls, and a bunch of others had 4. It must have been a brutal game. Yao went first. Lakers lead the series 3-1.  We ordered pizza and cheesy bread and talked until 11. She never gave me my change. Driving home I realized it was too late to go to Lu’s. I thought about Savannah, and realized that it was a good thing that I didn’t show up. When she came over to my table tonight, I said I was sorry. She said, “That’s OK, as long as you’re here tomorrow.” God bless her pretty little heart.

      Stayed home and watched the Lakers lose last night. It’s OK, they were playing their first game of the series in Houston. Next one they need to win, so as not to give those guys that little glimmer of hope. What’s weird about watching the Lakers, is Shaq. You almost don’t notice him scoring. Shaq just does what he does, and the ball goes in the hoop. In yesterday’s game it seemed like he couldn’t sink a basket for his life. Along with his disturbingly low free throw percentage (5 for 14 for a whopping 35%) I wondered what was bugging him. Then I go to the box score for the game and find that he led the Lakers in scoring with 25, and only one Rocket scored higher. That would be Steve Francis, which during the game looked like an overactive dynamo on speed. Shaq had 11 total rebounds, more than anyone else except Karl Malone.  Tomorrow’s is a day game, so I’ll probably watch at home too, and you’ll probably hear about it here in the evening. Aren’t you thrilled? Tonight I managed to get to the cafe before eight o’clock, even if I am a little groggy from my nap. Nap!..you say? Yes, nap. God gave us naps, and even if you’re an atheist, you can still gain from the benefits thereof. Though you’re going to hell. Kidding. I think.  The girl who I will refer to from this point forward as grocery girl (because I think she may have been a customer of mine when I worked at the grocery store), is working tonight. She’s been hanging out, sitting at a table across the way, where a rare and smoking hot female customer is jawboning with a couple of the guys. Grocery girl kind of leans forward when she walks, which makes it appear that her boobs are losing the fight with the planetary pull of gravity. It does make her butt stick out nicely though. Luckily for her she is that rare Asian bird in that her booty provides plenty of ballast to keep her from doing perpetual somersaults. Watching her walk is a discourse not only in physics but also in psychological ping-pong, careening between fear for her safety in the altogether dangerous nature of her forward propulsion and comforting gratitude that God is good and that he cares enough to make the very best. Update on this part: Just talked to grocery girl, and she’s not the customer I thought she was. Until I find out her name though, she’ll still be grocery girl. I’ll keep you posted.  Tee is working too. She stopped by to say hi and squint at the screen to see what I was writing. It’s a futile gesture on her part, as this is a flat screen, she wears glasses, and quickly making the switch to reading English is not in the cards for her. She is as sweet as ever. Boss Lady Hua is a genius, because the girls are wearing the white classic uniforms tonight, which give the girls the illusion of being totally covered, until you spend a moment gawking and realize that you’re looking at a bra and g-string. Discovering, or remembering this when your nose is six inches from a belly button is one of the more pleasant experiences.  The amazing Tina is also here tonight, who is also one of those mad Newtonian scientific experiments in gravity. She defeats the law by walking with shoulders back, a perfectly straight spine, and long, long legs. Her face is perfectly composed until she unleashes one of her slow smiles and briefly turns her head your way as she walks by. It’s a pure art form passed down through the centuries from one devastatingly beautiful creature to another. This being the weekend, the youngster is here behind the bar. She needs to be an actress or model or something. Or a rocket scientist, or....something. The bald truth of this cruel world is that good-looking people can go farther faster than us mere mortals if they only get out of their own way. She could enter politics and rule the world by the time she’s thirty (unless she's a Republican, then add another ten years to round out her experience). You can tell she’s going to look good long into her life.  Luan is here too. It’s so weird to say this, but out of the group, she’s the plain one. She’s got the body, she’s got the face, but, there’s an unquantifiable attitude that let’s all the other girls draw the eye first, and then you notice her. While the other girls may give the occasional attitude that this is all a chore and nothing more than a job, it is fleeting and of a dramatic nature. Luan thinks of this as work, and she's a worker. She endures it without complaint as if she's raising a bunch of kids, and boys will be boys and it's nothing to get excited about. The day-to-day is a given. Like Shaq, she does her job almost too good, so that you don't notice how good she is, until she smiles and gives you a nudge in the ribs to let you know she gets it.  Saving the best for last, Savannah is my waitress for the evening. She hung out at my table for just that little bit longer than she needed to, and guessed my order, marking me as a regular. It ain't Cheers, and nobody but Ed knows my name, but it's still a good thing. “You want me to make it?” she asked. “No, I want to serve as your slave on an ancient Spanish Galleon laden with pieces of eight and lost at sea with all of the sails torn to ribbons and no chance of ever finding land.” I’ll tell her that next time.  When I first started coming here, Ed and I would discuss the various aspects of the employees, from attire to poise to attitude. We still do on occasion, although Ed is on a quest at the moment making his way through points in Arizona, Nevada and parts of Central California taking pictures of fast cars, motorcycles and women. Savannah, we thought was a bit stuck up, and stiff. Every step seemed measured, every hair was in place, emotion rarely flashed across her face, and dialogue was curt. She’s softened up in all of these aspects, especially in her walk, having incorporated all of her molecules in the locomotive process. The stiffness is gone from her shoulders, and her feet naturally follow one another instead of looking for imaginary footprints to place themselves in. It's a fluid, yet, purposeful movement that says, "I'll get there, but I'm enjoying the ride." It’s nice to ride along and watch someone grow.

      I'm late again, got caught up in a Twilight Zone fest. It was one I hadn't seen before, about Jesse Belle that was about to lose her love to marriage to a rival, and went to Granny the witch's house for a love potion to get him back. The usual bad thing happens. It was always the bad thing. They managed to stretch the skit out to an hour, which was also, a bad thing. The Twilight Zone was just a little cheezy at times, but it mostly pulled it off. By the time this turkey was over, I almost wished I had cut out earlier. The babes were hot though, which was not always the case with this show either. It was almost like they avoided the hotties, or dressed them down, or made fun of them to emphasize the artistic aspect. This one was about two women vying for a man's attentions though, so they pulled out the old dark-haired bad girl/blonde girl good shtick. The dark haired girl reminded me of Karen Black, which was pretty hot, and the blonde, although good looking, could have been any starlet off the street in Hollywood. The best part about the dark haired one, was that it was pretty obvious that she was wearing a wig. I like it when they pretend.  What is it with that? I know of lots of men who like their women to dress up and pretend. Is that why actresses are a popular commodity? Is it that men like to be lied to? Is it that it doesn't matter? Back in the day, I enjoyed getting my buzz at the local go-go bar. For a dollar a pop some sexy creature would dance provocatively for you, and sit down and have a drink and listen attentively to your (my) drunken drivel. Even without seeing my face in a mirror, I could tell by looking at the loopy smiling mugs of the other customers what mine looked like when I was so suffered. As soon as the next dancer caught my eye it wasn't a stretch to say that I completely dismissed the former from my mind as I waved a buck in her general direction. The fantasy that any of these working girls had any interest whatsoever in me beyond a quick buck or a snort of whatever was going around evaporated like a puff of smoke on the way out the door, and I rarely thought about them again until the next time I saw one in an otherwise embarrassing embrace of a brass pole.  On the flip side, women do seem to like dressing up. What is that all about? Some would put forth the notion that the urge extends from an intrinsic insecurity, or lack of self worth; that a lack of confidence inspires them to assert that they are something that they are not. But the seeming universality of the phenomenon would relegate womanhood wholesale to the backwoods of human endeavor were that the case, something that is easily refuted by simple observation. What then is the reason for this unexplainable complimentary behavior? Why do women like to dress up and pretend, and why do men enjoy it so much that they pay to experience it?  Speaking of dressing up and paying for it, we're down to three girls already and the security guard is turning off the lights as the girls make a little extra noise cleaning up the tables. I'm sucking my shake down just a bit faster now, being that Luan snatched it off the table last night before I was finished with it. I'll be keeping an eye on her if she comes too close before I'm finished. Who am I kidding? I'll be keeping a close eye on her any time she comes close to the table. Tina is the winner tonight in the outfit department, with nothing special on except that her top and bra combination have the privilege of displaying her assets in a most satifying way. Jeannie has the pleated skirt going on tonight hung low on her hips, but she has a goofy playboy logo on her baby T-shirt. That always gets points deducted. There are two groups of fellas looking like their going to tough it out tonight until official closing at eleven. There goes one group. There goes my money to close the bill. See you later,

      I didn’t recognize Savannah tonight. How do they do that? I see her damn near every night and she's still able to be a chameleon. She’s wearing a light pastel pink, something like soft thin terrycloth, more girly and feminine than I’ve ever seen her wear. She usually goes for da bomb sexy, and it changes everything. Her hair is falling, instead of having been teased into the wild child goddess distraction that it usually is. Wait. She just took an order from a table just across from me, and it’s not a skirt, it’s a pair of short-shorts with a see-through skirt kind of wrap thing. No…..it’s a g-string under there. No. She just came by the table and smiled. Actually, I can’t tell exactly what it is, which I’m guessing is the point. It’s just a confusing night at the Cafe, again, which is exactly the point.  Other ladies on hand tonight include Luan, who is wearing a tube top kind of contraption with clear plastic straps which you can only see close up. Yes, close up. She took my order. The top also has white striped trim, which matches her short skirt that suggests a nautical motif. It’s also one of those flouncy pleated things that moves when she moves, and her short baby steps make it twitch in a satisfying fashion.  Tina is here tonight too. It’s not one of her more bewitching outfits, which is OK. She’s got to let the other girls shine once in a while. Her skirt is so tight though, that the idea of her tripping and falling off of her high heels frightens me. That she has slim hips is an understatement, and the lack of padding is what puts me in this mind, but I’m comforted by the fact that the entire joint would break their own collective neck rushing to cushion her fall if the worst would ever happen.  Finally, Jeannie from the day crew is here as well. Not my ‘mean’ Jeannie, the other one. She’s actually taller than most of the other girls, but because she is also so thin it’s not that noticeable unless she’s standing right next to one of them. Of course everyone here is six to eight inches taller than they really are, it’s a group-balancing act. Jeannie’s long hair accentuates her length so that she looks more like a stylized fashion drawing than a real live woman. Until she talks to you. And then it’s good. Because she speaks English and you can get the fantasy going that you could talk to her, if you only had something interesting to say. But face it, unless the your first sentence includes a reference to your Mercedes, or at least a Lexus, you don’t really have anything to say. Trust me on this.  There’s no Laker Game tonight and the music isn’t so loud that your fillings rattle. A lot of guys are playing checkers or just talking, everything is low key. Some guys are just hanging out distractedly throwing glances at the tube. There are interviews with basketball players going on and Sir Charles Barkley is yukking it up with the other fellas on the TNT Inside Sports show that nobody can hear. T-Wolves, Heat, and Bucks won tonight it looks like from the NBA web site (no link, it's NBA dot com for Pete's sake). I didn’t even know the Heat were in the playoffs.  I got here late tonight, and I’m already watching the girls clean up tables as a bunch of guys have just left. I’m feeling a little guilty watching them wipe down the tables because of an email my friend Gail sent me today from a 1955 magazine called “Housekeeping Monthly.” Among its many suggestions to ‘good’ housewives is: “4. Clear away the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives.” I jokingly responded, “what’s wrong with that?” as well as with other worthy suggestions such as, “2.  Prepare yourself.  Take 15 minutes to rest so you'll be refreshed when he arrives.  Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh-looking.  He has just been with alot of work-weary people.”  Of course, Gail took me seriously, maybe because I’ve been spending my time at a place that puts an emphasis on pleasing an overwhelmingly male clientele. I may be spoiled, for the moment, but I have no illusions that were I to be cohabitating with one of these beautiful creatures, I would be the one taking care of the chores, if only to be paying the ‘help’ to take care of them for me. I had to set the record straight to Gail. She then wrote back that another male friend of ours had replied to her original email with the same response I had. The best part of her taking our friend seriously is that he’s married to a most liberal woman that is a professor at a college in New York City and is a historian of ‘overlooked’ women writers. If he were to exhibit any desire to coax his wife in the direction of Housekeeping Monthly’s helpful suggestions, his ass would be camping on the porch PDQ.  That’s all from the western front this evening, and all the best to you and yours.

      I’ve been practicing my typing on a new program called  urlLink Master Key . I suck. If you think writing is tough and you can type 60 words per minute, you ain’t shit. I’m topping out at 30 wpm, and I’m not even up to using the whole keyboard yet. In other words, my brain is two or three topics ahead and as I’m correcting mistakes, my flighty brain goes off in another direction. What sucks worse is that I have to use a spell checker, and just editing spelling mistakes takes up half the time it takes to post this crap. URL’s are another whole bag of tricks. MS Word uses ‘smart quotes,’ which don’t translate to either Blogger or MT, and I have to add links afterwards, when I post. Am I being too bitchy? I need some excuse now for not posting every day.  Anyway, I’m at Lu’s. Two girls that I recognize from the day shift are on tonight, plus a new girl, and I think the place has collectively lost 30 pounds. I can’t believe how skinny these girls are, I want to go out to  urlLink Wendy’s  and buy a big bag of hamburgers and force feed them until healthy. The new girl has hips, and she hasn’t figured the place out yet. She’s still walking self consciously, stiff, but like all the new girls, she smiles a lot. Not jaded yet, and still probably wondering what the hell is going on. She seems to get along with the other girls; nobody is ignoring her, as I’ve seen more than once. Women can be vicious, and when they ignore the new girl, it’s not a pretty sight.  I’m early tonight, got here about 6:30, and the place is filling up for the  urlLink Lakers  game. San Antonio seems to be beating the crap out of the  urlLink Grizzlies , but it’s a low scoring game. The last Laker game was a similarly low scoring game, and it was ugly. Nobody could make a basket, and it was only won by one point. If they don’t come out and play tonight I’m rooting for the  urlLink Rockets . The team that was put together last year should have chased all the other teams home by the All Star game. On paper, they should be able to wake up in the morning having had dreamed a win the night before, without ever having showed up in the physical plane. In reality, they look like ghosts on the floor, which is a pretty good trick for a bunch of black guys (sorry Slava, Luke).  The final table has filled up here, surrounding your hack reporter, and the Spurs just finished off the Grizzlies, which means the Lakers are up in a few minutes. My position here is almost directly under one of the better big screens, as this is where the electrical outlet is, and I’m going to have to shut down now. What’s interesting tonight is that they’ve turned the Viet Pop off, and the sound on the tube is up. Must be the playoffs.   Update:  It looks like both teams showed up. Malone and Payton are starting to earn their keep. 23-22 Lakers.  Update: 74-64 Lakers, third quarter. The Rockets are playing pretty well, but the looks on the faces of the Lakers are begining to look like those of the Harlem Globetrotters. They're having fun. This could be the beginning of the L.A. crowd getting into it.  Final Update: 98-84 Lakers/final, with 1:40 of garbage time. There were a couple of attempted Globetrotter moments, Kobe with a backward mid-air collision basket, and Malone backing off of Yao sending him ass-over-teakettle. Nice touch, Fischer getting into the playoff groove, and Kareem Rush with some confident three ponters that bode well for the rest of the series.

      It's getting late here at Lu's, 11:30 or so, and I'm about ready to leave. I spent most of the evening editing pictures for the othe site and I've just run out of time, so here is the link. It's just a little photo essay about my trip back east, but mostly about the time I spent underground in NYC dodging the trains.  urlLink Enjoy!

      I’m out on the patio, around 1:30 PM on Thursday, tax day, and I’m still just a little shaky. The wi-fi signal isn’t that strong, and in order to post this I’m gonna have to go inside. The mean temp has got to be 72 degrees and the slight breeze keeps blowing my smoke off the table, which means that I’m just dangling it from my mouth now as I type. It was a struggle to talk myself into coming here, which should let you know, considering my quasi-poetic waxing in previous posts of the inimitable Lu’s, how sick I’ve been.  My Jeannie is here, showing her tattoo on the small of her back, and I’m reminded of the beach, as her outfit doesn’t contain much more material than a swimsuit. My waitress professed confusion when I asked her for a coffee/banana shake, so I told her to make me a shake identical to the last one she made. It is a sweet, pink lemonade-ice concoction dosed up with more than enough sugar to keep me vibrating into the evening.  I spent a week on my back, shivering and sweating alternately, eating virtually nothing, and wondering, what the fuck? After a week of this I got some strength back, and started to eat. At the same time I obtained a dozen or so 500 mg antibiotics and started a regimen of three a day, just in case. I figured if they’re good enough for anthrax, they’re good enough for whatever bug had a hold of me. It’s been about a week since I started that, and though I don’t feel sick, you probably couldn’t convince the neighbors of that with my periodic coughing fits.  I ventured outside the other day to wash my car to get the jet crud off of it from sitting a week at the airport. Like today it was one of those “Southern California days” that begs you to write home and tell everyone back east what suckers they are. My trip was nice enough, and there was one day that was passable for civilization, but the rest were cold rainy and overcast, one night dropping down below 32. Within two days of my return I was floored. The only good thing that came out of my ‘down time’ was that I read the first book of Neal Stephenson’s new Baroque series,  urlLink Quicksilver . As I was finishing that one up, Amazon sent me the news that the second of the series, the  urlLink Confusion , was on its way, and I’m now knee deep in that. I can’t recommend these books enough, but they’re long (944 and 834 pages) and you have to be a bit of a geek when it comes to history, computers, and old-fashioned adventure stories. Throw in some Alchemy, Sir Isaac Newton, Ben Franklin as a young boy, and ancestral characters from another Stephenson book Cryptonomicon, and you get a strange brew that will, well, keep you guessing anyway.  That’s all for today, I’ve got to catch up on other things, email among them, and thank you for your patience. See you tomorrow.

      Hot green tea, mmm. Some kind of slow pop song in Vietnamese. Tee asked me where I was. I'm home now, that's what matters. Waiting for my shake. The trip was a trip. Got to see Granny, the bro, and the crew at the old folks home. There was one good day that was just like the beginning of autumn, the rest were cold, overcast, rainy, or all three. I got back a couple of days ago but had to go to L.A. to cat and house sit. Yesterday morning I reached up into the cupboard for more sugar for my coffee, and pulled the entire right side of my back out. I was laughing at myself between bouts of searing pain because of the little noises I was making when I tried to move. Right now I'm pretty sure the whole episode made me sick. I'm bundled up in t-shirt, pocket-t, and long sleeved Dickie's shirt and it feels like wintertime with my stuffy nose even though it's 70 degrees at twenty after eight in the PM. Mmm, coffee banana.  I actually did write a bunch of stuff starting when I was on the plane headed east, but it's pretty obvious that this stuff doesn't stand too much scrutiny, so I trashed it. To complicate things, it cost a fortune to dial up net zero at the hotel. Worse, at check out time it turns out that because I dialed a 1 in front of the number, (you have to dial the area code, so I thought?) it turned the call to the next town into long distance. They wound up taking about $150 off the bill after they saw what happened. Next casualty, the laptop battery. As I took the red eye flight I thought maybe, just maybe, I could sleep. Nada. At around 4AM eastern time I put the head phones on and cranked up the i-tunes with the funky hippy psychedelic screen that moves to the music. I stayed that way, staring wide-eyed at the wavy colors, hands clamped over the head phones holding them as close to my cranium as physics would allow, bobbing my head in a Queens of the Stone Age stupor, until the tap came on the shoulder that we were going to land. When I got to Clifton, the battery was dead, and it won't hold a charge to this day. I'm on the backup battery which holds about a 65% charge, and drops dead with no warning.  Now that we've got that out of the way, back to our regularly scheduled talent report. Tee, Savannah, Luan, and two new girls. I can't do justice to these girls in writing tonight, mostly because I'm under the weather and have no idea what I'm writing, and because they drop right into the top five category-no problem. I've seen one of these new girls twice before, (well not exactly new, is she?-ed. No, but I don't know her name and only said 'hi' to her for the first time tonight) the other I'm seeing tonight for the first time. OK. Why the top five? You could say that these girls are, uh, supercharged. Think short supermodel, Playboy Bunny types. It's amazing that they don't fall over forward as they balance on their minimum six-inch heels. They are taller than I am, with the shoes. The new girl is almost sculpted; soft curves, long legs, long black hair pulled back from her eyes with one hand while she pours tea with the other. The natural shape, and the fact that she actually balances well without surgery. I've got nothing against enhancements. I got off that criticism years ago. I appreciate that a woman wants to put her best, er, foot forward. But when it all comes together naturally, it's a beautiful thing.  The other girl had been staying away, not hard to do as I am buried behind three rows of tables up against the wall looking around for a wall outlet. Not gonna happen here. Later, if the power lasts long enough, I'll reconnoiter the walls for juice for the next time. She's perched behind the bar now, scanning the crowd. She looks like a lively one. She's tall and thin and seems to have a personality. While the curvy one is soft and flowing, sloe-eyed and apple cheeks, this one is younger, thinner, taller, more gazelle-like, more model like. She is likely enhanced, as I was just distracted by her hair falling around her breasts and trying to find the best place to rest. Tough job.  As for the regular girls, Tee has her hair up and it's showing off her long neck, at least the part that's not covered by the high open throat collar. Savannah is working a full, curly ponytail, hair pulled back from her face that shows she doesn't need the hair to frame it. Luan is Luan. Serious as she does her job, all smiles when she looks you in the eyes. What else could you ask for?  Oh yes. The Clippers are losing to the Jazz, and I just checked the Lakers team page and was briefly saddened that they lost to the Spurs earlier today (I must have been sick to have missed that one), until I checked the standings. They are now first in the Pacific Division and the Western Conference. How did they do that? What happened to the Kings? Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

      I think I like it. This black thing with the white-ish writing. It almost looks like I meant it to look this way, instead of just the old cookie cutter thing-o-bloggie.  I went for the coconut shake tonight, which was a nice change. So nice that I ordered another. Except I Monique delivered my usual coffee shake instead. No matter, it was piled high with strawberries and whipped cream just like the first one and I can really feel my waist expanding as we speak, er, write, er, read, whatever.  Tonight is the first road test of my new battery, and I must say I’m impressed. It’s just about 10PM and I got here at 7, and we’re looking at 40% juice left. What the hell have I been doing in the meantime? Well, just surfing, watching Detroit beat up the Pacers with a funny ending like the Lakers yesterday. In both games the losing team, which had scant chance of recovering, tried either fouling (T-Wolves) or to draw a foul (Pacers) in what has become a time honored fashion in the NBA to extend the games for that lucky snowballs chance. In both games the refs shook their collective heads and by inference said, “Play fucking basketball!” I didn’t hear Shaq’s angry looking response to the no-call of Madsen’s impression of a pale flapping drape hanging on the Big Aristotle, but I think once he sees the tape and talks to the Zenmaster he’ll agree it was the right thing to do. Reggie Miller’s response to his non-call was to kick the ball into the stands after the buzzer.  I have to agree with the refs on this one, as do my compatriots at DV who also had a good laugh. There is a time for strategic fouling and the old haq-a-shaq, but not every fucking time the ball passes the 8-second line. Other than this minor quibble, admirably taken care of by the officials, these conference finals have been most enjoyable. The Lakers have started to be the team they are supposed to be, and the Wolves aren’t giving up. They have brought the battle. In the Eastern Conference Detroit is striving to recall the bad boy image of the past that Dennis Rodman was a part of and Indiana isn’t going anywhere without a fight. I expect that Detroit and L.A. will face off in the finals, and it will be a brutal match. Should be loud here at DV.  I feel a little dirtier than usual tonight. After the game here they put a Brittney Spears concert up on the big screens. The last part that just finished started with a little girl sitting on the floor listening to what I guess was her Dad (trust me, he looked creepy). She got up on his lap. Scene switch to little girl sitting alone in her dark room with a wooden box on her lap: As they were mercifully fast-forwarding through the ‘Daddy’ scene, I didn’t hear the dialog and imagined the worst, When the box opened I expected it throw wide the gates of hell, but it was actually a music box. Switch to Brittney rising up out of a big music box onstage with a semi-ballerina outfit on, which a thoughtful apprentice then had the good sense to remove the frilly part to reveal satin hot pants, then a lame song. Now she’s in black shiny pants doing a Janet Jackson rip-off talking about nasty boys. At least they’re not showing an Olsen Twins movie.  I have to leave now. Brittney’s singing about not being a girl but not yet a woman or some crap and I’m about to either lose my mind or my lunch.

       urlLink This  is what you'll have to settle for tonight as I just accidentally deleted a few hundred words. Shit. It was the last thing I copied onto the clipboard. Needless to say I pithily explained my lack of posting, talked about the Lakers, talked about who I want to see play them in the finals, informed you about the girls on staff tonight, introduced you to two new people I met at DV the other day, and waxed poetic about my excellent shake. The title of the post (if you can call that bold crap at the beginning a title, I need a new template) refers to how I've just bought a new battery for my laptop.  I'm home now because I pulled said boner as they put the lights on and sat there slack jawed until they put the cane around my neck and pulled me off stage right. Now I'm too wound up to go to bed. So here are two links to follow without explanation to go along with the other unexplained link above.  urlLink This  and  urlLink this .  That's all because I've used up all my brain.   Update:  OK, I've changed the template and got the comments to work but I can't get the picture to load in the comments window. I'm really done now. Nite.

      Dime Magazine has an  urlLink interview  with Latrell Sprewell called 'You Can Hate Me Now," that's worth a read for Spree fans. My only question is, how do you hate a guy who owns a "Motor Sports dealership in San Bernadino[...] where jet-black SUVs and Lamborghinis rule the showroom floor," and has actually choked his boss? He  is  going to have to do a better job in the fourth quarter in New Jersey to make it back to Detroit for game seven.  Sacramento has had the good grace to win today and give the Lakers and extra two days of rest. Watching the game for a bit I've come to the conclusion that as much as I would like Kevin Garnett to have a chance at the title (and be crushed, of course), it would be much more entertaining to watch the Kings play the Lakers. Watch for the 'goose neck' defense.

       urlLink Howard Beck , Staff Writer for the L.A. Daily News (l.a.'s other white meat) follows up on my Saturday post: [puleeze! -ed.]  Still, there were anxious moments down the stretch. Horry had three chances to hit momentum-changing 3-pointers the kind that defined his career on this very court but he missed all three. And 18,997 former Horry fans sighed with relief each time.  Hack-a-Shaq defense made its series debut with 3:39 left in the game when Horry wrapped up O'Neal in the lane.   After the final buzzer, as the teams met on the court to exchange congratulations, Robert Horry walked straight to the tunnel the only member of this rivalry to lose this series two consecutive years.

      Yes, I saw the glorious finish of game 5, just barely. As Duncan threw up his prayer, I had to admit that he could not have been defended any better. Yeah we blew a sixteen-point lead, but we’re in San Antonio. Ed said, “let’s go,” and we got up to leave. But we didn’t. We stood by the door for what seemed like an hour. Lakers lore came back to me. In the world of sports only one other team invites such hatred from their opposing team’s fans, and that’s the Yankees. Robert Horry knows why. He came home to San Antonio knowing he would probably be in this position, and from his play, he knew well the tragedy in store. Hurtling headlong to his fate he blew the ‘shot.’ He molested Karl Malone. I could see the anger in him sprung from the foreknowledge of his fate, and that of the men who would share it with him.  Point-oh-four-seconds. Phil Jackson didn’t blink. Crossing his hands one over the other in the T for time out, he rose and grasped the clipboard. Another time out. A commercial. Circles and Xs. I looked in at the guys glued to their seats in Da Vang. Nobody was moving. Ed and I were the only ones standing. Ed was finally getting the picture. These are the heartbreakers these Lakers. The ones that toy with you through three quarters, and then remember that they’re there to play hoops. Time to put on the show for Jack and Penny and Denzel. These are the guys who have every newspaper in the country counting them out, calling them selfish, not really a dynasty, and by the way, who is the best team ever? Certainly not this motley collection of has-beens and second stringers.  I’m going to paraphrase here because I’m too lazy to look it up, but afterwards Jackson said of the inbound play planned, “I’ve seen thousands of these plays, drawn up hundreds myself, and out of all that maybe twelve worked. I knew this one would work.” Teams have mystiques, some good, some bad. The Red Sox have the curse of the Babe. This group brings bad news with them. The season that should have gone down in history has been wrought with injury to players who don’t get injured, criminal indictments, a starting squad together for less than half the season, and players used to being heroes in the playoffs sitting on the bench as back-ups.  I figure Malone for the shot. I know that Kobe and Shaq will be doubled, and Malone’s the biggest target. Fisher, at six-one, in less than four-tenths of a second, fulfills the destiny of Robert Horry, crushes him under his heel, and for another game brings Doom to the team that moments ago was thought to be the best team in basketball. I stand in the doorway, held breath from bursting lungs funnels into my space buffeting my ears and lifting the false ceiling tiles from their frames. It doesn’t get any better than this.

      Welcome back me! To my new home at Café Di Vang. It’s a regular blogging delight to actually blog from a café again, instead of writing there without the benefit of being online and then uploading from home. It really cramped my style, if in fact it is stylish. There is also another reason. I wuz dissed! I know, I know, what else is new? But really, on top of being summarily booted from the network with nary an IT person in sight, I showed up for game 3 of the Laker series and treated like a bum. A common thief. A stranger. An interloper. And asked for a tip to boot!  Being a culturally sensitive sort, I try to bone up on the local traditions. As a matter of fact, my whole sojourn to Vietnamese coffee establishment society has been an experiment in, if you will, cross cultural pollination. You just don’t find this particular phenomenon in western society. There are many things for a western devil to learn about Southeast Asian culture, for instance, when and when not to drool at (or on) your server. Considering the lack of alcohol involved, this is much easier to pick up than in your standard run of the mill dancing establishment.  There is smoking etiquette, which is fast becoming a lost art in America, as no matter what you do with a cigarette, it is considered bad form. There are also subtle differences between establishments, and the proper use of gossip. Alas, there is also the photographic prohibition endemic to Viet Café society. Exceptions include but are not limited to talking one of the girls into believing you are a photographer, which can be difficult even if you are a real photographer. Just ask Ed. But of course I will have a treat if you wait till the end.  So having mastered the basics of polite intercultural intercourse I was slack-jawed yesterday when I showed up at Lu’s for an afternoon of Laker basketball, and asked to pay for my drink in advance. What!? “Oh, it’s very busy today, I don’t want to lose track.” I was taken by surprise and dazedly handed over my fin. “Can you tip me now too?” Last all muscle control of jaw as lips and tongue tried to speak without breath moving over voice box. I was conscious enough to only give up a buck.  As mean Jeannie walked away little vignettes replayed in my mind of a small huddle of girls jabbering away not three feet from me with furtive glances. Ed came by moment later, and the only thing I could say was, “They made me pay up front.” We looked around at the receipt slips on the other tables. Mean Jeannie came back and took Ed’s order. I still don’t know if it hit him until she came back and asked  him  for money. Dark clouds shadowed the game happening seemingly a mile away on the big screens. Ed said that he would pay after, and that if he paid now he wouldn’t have an excuse to talk to Theresa, the de facto boss that day. This was both an assertion of a customer that dropped money there virtually every day for seven years, and also a salve to deflect any blame from Jeannie to the boss.  Theresa came by. She insisted on payment. Ed didn’t tip her. We left without finishing our drinks, which is a pretty big insult to an Asian food business (I found this out back in 1980 when I stubbed a cigarette out in my plate of cold greasy eggs and rubber steak that I waited an hour for in Chinese restaurant at a San Francisco Hotel. The headwaiter and chef chased my girlfriend and me to the cashier and yelled until I explained the bad service. No, I didn’t have to pay).  We immediately amscrayed to Café Da Vang for the remainder of the walloping the Lakers served up the Spurs. The bloom came off the Café Lu rose as the waitresses ministered to our bruised and battered egos. But the best revenge is served, uh, however you can get it. On the way in the door to Da Vang, we synchronistically ran into Miss Tina, Superstar from Café Lu. She was shocked and embarrassed at our rough treatment at the hands of the day crew. Vindication was had by all as we realized, “Hey, this place is air conditioned.”  It also has a serviceable Internet connection, and the girls are muchas guapa. Trust me on this. Lu’s has a certain old world charm, but sometimes having modern conveniences outweigh the romance of sweating whilst enjoying the scenery.  I’ve been here before, and have enjoyed polite discourse with the long, lean, and sexy Monique, and this evening I made the acquaintance of the lovely Tricia. Already the conversation level has increased and Tricia will be reading this post as soon as I post it. Yes, I am insane, but maybe it will also raise the level of prose here at the ‘Hack’ past the usual repetition of the talent report. The Laker report will continue as long as they continue to actually play basketball.  Now, as promised, here is your treat for trudging through this far. In my last entry (geez has it been that long?) I mentioned I was going to assist Ed for a photo shoot at Irwindale Raceway (I blogged that on the other site  urlLink here .) That morning we stopped for coffee at Lu’s and a couple of the girls agreed that I could take photos. I only had my Elph with me but I clicked away until Ed nudged me to stop. Actually he said stop stupid before we get thrown out. They aren’t the best pics I’ve ever taken, and I had to do major repair in Photoshop, but it should prove that not all of this is a figment of my imagination.  As the sun streaks in to play its warm rays on our intrepid hack-reporter he witnesses a ritual rarely seen by mere mortals. Two sleepy coffee girls preparing for a day of charm and grace amidst the wilds of Harbor Boulevard.

      Tonight they wear the white. Ao Dai is what they call the costumes, traditional Vietnamese. Long sleeveless high collar tops that fall down to the calf, but are slit up the side to the waist. Long loose pants that sweep the floor. It’s a great equalizer in that there’s not the one-ups-manship of wearing the sexiest outfit. They’re all sexy, and the costumes seem to fit all of the different body types. Tina’s long jet-black hair is the most striking contrast tonight, even though all the other girls except Tee have long black hair. It’s a full shade darker and at the same time brighter.  The youngster is here tonight too, except that her outfit is embroidered and opaque. The shape of her body isn’t in doubt, but it allows your attention to be drawn to her perfect face. There’s no hint of skin to make you refocus your eyes to see the delineating line of an inconsequential G-string. As they walk through the differing light the transformation between formal attire and the beach at Rio de Janeiro is what makes this such a special place.  Savannah’s hair is relaxed tonight and she must be wearing eight-inch heels. The outfits with their long flowing lines elongate her figure naturally, and the heels lengthen her legs into dangerous territory. Speaking of dangerous territory, Luan just swept her top around her and perched on a chair right in front of me with her leg under her. The happy smiley shape of her toosh grinning at me froze my stare for a moment until I could force my way back to the keyboard.  Nice Jeannie looks perfect the first time I’m seeing her in the official weekend uniform of the Superb Café Lu. It must be brand new and hasn’t a wrinkle or crease in it. It’s tailored perfectly for her and only the youngster’s outfit paints a prettier picture. Tee, god love her, wears hers as if it’s a T-shirt and jeans. She seems to be so comfortable in it that instead of the outfit wearing her, she’s made it her own.     I’m drinking hot tea tonight which I’m realizing now is a mistake. It should be a no-brainer, right? 95 degrees in the daytime, maybe 80 degrees now, figure ice tea. Nope. Somebody buy me a clue. There’s a rap song on the radio, hip-hop actually. There’s a real tune, rhythm and beat to it. I guess it’s a universal nowadays that you’ll find this stuff everywhere you find young women. I’m not really a fan, although I do like some of it, and I have a root-for-the-home-team tendency to play the Beastie Boys really loud when they come on the radio. I’ve even been caught tapping a toe to Eminem. But the hardcore gangsta’ stuff gets right by me without a listen. Last night I happened to hear a magnum opus with the pithy lyrical repetition of, “I smell pussy!”  I looked around, and nobody was singing along, no one was tapping their feet, swinging to the rhythm. It was as if this olfactory celebration wasn’t really happening, yet there it was. I sniffed the air myself and detected only smoke. Now, I spend way too much time here yakking about the girls, hopefully avoiding the point of obsession (but not really trying), but even to me that’s juvenile. I didn’t really listen to the rest of the song(?) but I didn’t hear them rhyming about Kobe’s jump shot or how much they love an April shower. Do women really like this tripe? Maybe I am just getting old.  Speaking of Kobe’s jump shot, the Lakers will be on tape delay for me tomorrow as I have a real live working gig during the game. Ed is coming back home from his grail quest/road trip and has thrown caution to the wind to hire me as his assistant at Irwindale Raceway. I haven’t been to a drag strip in over a decade, and I love the noise of the dragsters and funny cars. I spent a few nights at Englishtown Raceway in my youth watching the fire breathing jet cars scar the local eardrums and corneas. That may as well be on tape delay also as my task will be to feed the machines that make the money. I do expect a spectacular show of skin though if the weather is anything like today’s. Pray for me.

      I haven't done this in awhile, but the talent is amazing tonight. The big blonde American girl served me and is wearing what I think is called a peignoir. It's black and goes with her tan well. I told her she looks good and she then started to demonstrate by adjusting herself why it doesn't fit. Nonsense. That was what I said when I picked my jaw up off the floor. Monique is wearing something that may as well not be there, and Tricia is wearing a G-string and pasties with some pink see through thing tossed over. Michelle is wearing what arguably could be called a dress, except that it is lace see-through and she's not wearing a bra.  Monique stopped by and chatted briefly and I complemented her on her outstanding wardrobe choice.  She said she doesn't have much lingerie. I asked her what her size is: 34c, x-small, white, pink, blue, or lavender. OK. Those aren't exactly sizes, at least all of them, but it's now on record. Now I ask you, what could be more fun than buying some hot lingerie and having a hot girl model it while serving exotic drinks.

      It goes without saying that it was beyond depressing that the Lakers self-destructed. It also goes without saying that the Pistons were awesome, and they deserve their title. It also proves the old saw that "there's no such thing as a free lunch." Getting Malone and Payton to take drastic cuts in pay didn't work out as planned. As Malone found out also, there is such a thing as destiny. He's the guy I feel for, if anyone, and I hope he comes back to a  urlLink reconstituted  Laker squad ready to kick ass, even if they don't manage to get the trophy next year. I don't see Payton and Kobe on the same squad, but then I was dead wrong before.  Congrats to Detroit not only on their win, but also on keeping the city  urlLink mostly in one piece  after the game.

      This evening I will do my duty and force myself to watch the Lakers. Watching this team can be excruciating, as it was for game three. They were manhandled. Ed said that Kobe looked like a guy facing twenty years behind bars. We left DV at the half because we were late and got the worst seats in the house. The main drag to the bathroom and kitchen was right in front of our table, of which the goings on blocked the TV for most of the time and the "DJ" was more concerned with filling the commercial breaks with bad music instead of switching back to the game when it came back on. We went back to Ed's studio to watch and cringe in private.

      I saw Matt’s car in front of the place but I didn’t see him on the way to my seat. The girl with the long torso and natural breasts (a rarity) got me a coffee shake (Ed and me had made up a mnemonic device to remember her name but we can’t remember what it is). “How’s it all going?” Blank stare. “In other words, how are you?” “OK. What do you want?” Not the most talkative of the crew. No fruit stuffed in the whipped cream either but she did drizzle chocolate syrup over it.  Monique hasn’t been by yet but Michelle poked at me when she went by. Last night I met Ed for eats at the local Acapulco. I had eaten a big fat bowl of white rice and some chicken that Aurora made, but I went for this desert they make with a gooey chocolate cake with ice cream and whipped cream (yes, I think that I will adopt Marlon Brando as my new role model). Our waitress was incredibly cute and Ed asked her what was her extraction. Vietnamese it turns out, although she could have been anything from Polynesian to Mexican to any number of South American nationalities and beyond.  After chow we retired to the outdoor patio to drink coffee and so I could smoke. It’s good to remember which places provide a place for smoking here in So Cal. I’m pretty sure that I’ll see a real prohibition in my lifetime. I don’t care who’s in office, which way the politicos drag us, whether or not we have legal and safe abortion or the right to watch disorganized religion on TV; the minute they take away the cigs I’m moving. It may be to the middle of Montana or Wyoming surrounded by right wing wacko militia or in the Arizona desert in the midst of yoga-twisting vegans worshipping rocks. It might be mangling the French language in some gutter in Paris. The minute they take away the smokes the terrorists will have won anyway, so begging forgiveness from the frogs will be officially warranted.  Anyway, back to our racially indeterminate but incredibly cute (she says “I know” when we tell her she’s good looking) waitress. She blanched when we said she could make more money as a coffee-girl instead of slopping hash at a Mexican chain restaurant. She’d rather pick dingle-berries for a living (not exactly her words, but combined with the look on her face it's closer to what she meant). We get the feeling that she has less than respect for our favorite servers. Her grand plan is to get her medical degree and open a free clinic. God bless the beasts and the children, but I’m pretty sure she hasn’t a clue as to whom she’d have to blow the get the money to run the joint. And unless she’s genius enough to qualify for some kind of scholarship (not likely), coffee-girl money will get her farther toward her degree than what she’s doing now. You wonder (at least I do sometimes) whether it’s a merciful act to tell the young’uns how reality really is, or to hope for divine intervention or plain dumb luck so they may realize their dreams. Sometimes it’s fun to watch them crash and burn.  Long-girl came by again to pour tea and noticed that the type on the laptop was very small. What this meant is that she couldn’t read it as she walked behind me. I explained that that was the purpose, and she thought that it was amusing. I made the type larger and watched as she tried to read it. I could have made it poster-size. Monique finally came by and asked how was my day. I actually told what it was like, in that I was supposed to do something that I blew off. That thing was to make a phone call to some Nigerian scam artist in Africa that I’m writing about  urlLink elsewhere . I want to set it up just right, and today wasn’t the day. Part of my story to this guy is that my situation includes me being married to a 14 year-old girl. Monique has one of those little girl voices that she uses and I had the blinding insight that it would be hilarious if Monique was around when I made the call. That idea lasted a non-second or two.  Back to my version of reality, this post is long enough and I don’t want to spoil you.   Incidental Ambiance:  The jukebox tonight includes Sublime. Buy it from here because it is required listening and I get a cut if you do so.  urlLink

      King Kaufman is becoming my favorite sports writer, and I've only read two of his columns. Kaufman writes his  urlLink Sports  Daily column for  urlLink Salon  and you either have to subscribe or watch some lame 10 panel commercial (today's was for Sprint) to read him. I breezed through the advert in under a minute (an eternity in Internet time, I know) and was rewarded with a most pithy analysis of the coming NBA Championship series.  I'm writing this through tears.   That's because I just finished watching the Pistons eliminate the Pacers, and the thought of either of these teams beating the Lakers in the NBA Finals sent me into fits of laughter.   The Pistons will get the chance after beating the Pacers 4-2 Tuesday night. And that was the score of the game, not just the series.   No, I'm being silly. The actual final score Monday was 11-8. I've seen more scoring at a "Star Trek" convention, more good shots in the first five minutes of happy hour. In two of my college classes, I made more baskets than the two teams combined to make Monday, and one of those classes was held underwater.  Of course I'm going to watch the finals, and like it, especially when the Lakers pull one of those weird "maybe they can lose it" moments. It's all in the script. Everyone knows it, everyone gives out the same gasp every time.  I had only glimpsed part of this universal knowledge before. I thought maybe, maybe I'm imagining this. Then I began watching the games at the coffee bar, where even the local expat Vietnamese know the drill. But the Lakers don't only frustrate their own fans, they are brutal on opposing teams and their fans.  Phil Jackson was quoted after game five about how he had heard laughter coming from the locker room before the game. He went in there and told the fellas to be more serious, and then they lost the game. One wonders how badly they would have beaten the Wolves had he let them go out and have fun. And that was part of the Master's stategy also. He let the other side know how much the rank and file thought of their opponents.

      So it's over for the Pacers. On to the finals and Detroit is bringing the 'fro to la.   Ed called from the Dirty Dog or some such juke joint giving the play by play for the last minute forty-five or so. I think he had a couple of beers in him because he was excited beyond what was warranted for a mere eastern conference final game. I had just gotten my hair cut by my favorite Vietnamese barber girl, "You ever been here before?" "Um, yeah." "Who cut your hair?" "Uhh, you did." "How you want me to cut it?" "Try the scissors." She proceeded to use the clippers for the entire hair cut. I hate when she does that. "You coming down to DV?"  Ed asks. "Nah, I had my afternoon shake already." Solo. I can read the blogs and maybe post. Cool. I went home to pick up the ibook.  I had used the laptop on the battery today hiding in my room from a bad Disney movie on the big screen, (the Lion King One and a Half straight to video disaster), and was charging the battery. My roommate was now screening Return of the King with enough volume to amuse the neighbors. I must have pissed him off wandering back and forth in front of the tube checking on the charge. Finally it hit about 96% and I headed south. The exhaust is getting louder by the day and the brakes are starting to squeak. I need to get the other two speakers to fix that. When it gets to the point of having to get a louder radio I'll probably have to fix the other things too.  Monique keeps poking me in the back when she walks by. She didn't notice me when I came in so Michelle got me my drink. It's my fault of course, I got a haircut and she didn't recognize me. Re: said haircut, I'm now scratching my itchy neck. That's the worst part of a brand new haircut. No matter how tight they wrap you up, recently sheared hairs wend their way down the back of your neck and nestle in your collar for the moment when it's the most inconvenient to scratch. I have a problem that a lot of guys have when I'm sitting in the barber chair; I can't see a fucking thing when they ask me if the cut is OK. It's all a big blur. They never seem to remember that I have a pair of glasses sitting on the counter right in front of them. The whole motion of reaching for my glasses and putting them on, dislodges the tiny little hairs that have collected behind my ears from the clippers down into the paper tucked into my collar. It's a conspiracy. I wonder where I'm going to get my 'fro wig for the finals.  Matt and Alexis have come and gone and the place is just starting to clear out. I'm boring the piss out of myself with this post, and I've already erased half of what I wrote, so you can imagine how bad that was. If I don't get some kind of creative jolt soon I'm going to go back to the nightly talent report.

      Well I never got around to posting the Anime convention pics on the other site as I promised, as I was busy writing an article for a national magazine's web site. Woo Hoo! No shit. I had queried them on covering an event in Hollywood and instead of turning me down flat they invited me to write it up. They didn't assign me the job, which means I may not get paid if they decide not to use it, but they might rabbit, they might. Anyway, it turned out pretty good and it's right where they are editorially, so wish me luck. Now I have to get back to putting something together for the local rag.  But as contrition for not posting, I've resized the convention pictures to make them fit here on this old blog. Not for the bandwidth shy, and until Blogger gets one of those fancy extended entry things, it's all on the front page.  First up is the lovely Anaheim Convention Center right across the street from Disneyland, the happiest, etc.      Lots of peeps came to look at the cartoons (that's engrish for anime).          Some peeps came dressed like cartoons.       Some peeps came dressed like their favorite movie heroes.       This girl is president of the Chico Hills College anime club (that's Japanese for cartoons).       This girl may be too short for the NBA, but here, she's just right.       This is Peter. He runs a web site that sells really neat things from Japan. You can click on the link over on the sidebar that says 'yellow fever.' Or, you can just click  urlLink here . Arigato.       This guy works for Peter. He is holding up a Hello Kitty item for sale. It is a, um, back massager, yeah, that's it, a  back  massager. They're very popular.       I don't know if you can see it real well, but this is a poster for the new Zatoichi movie. Zatoichi is a blind traveling masseur, who is also a Samurai. Back in the days of the Ronin (that's a fancy word for samurai with no master) masseurs were like doctors in Japan, just like in Europe barbers were like doctors (betcha' didn't know that). I missed the American release of Zatoichi because I wasn't paying attention, now I have to wait for the damn DVD.       Here is another poster that I thought was pretty cool. I forget what it was for except that the movie is going to be released in Japan real soon, which means it will get here next year.       They had a booth that sold nothing but toys and stuff from the 'Nightmare Before Christmas' movie. I guess they really like it over there. But wait, they're selling it here. I guess we must like it pretty much too.       The most amusing thing I saw was this nice lady from Dreamworks Pictures. She works in the marketing department and was getting in a little overtime to sit at the booth. She had no idea what she was getting into with all the strange people in costumes and stuff. I'm guessing she'll be looking into the anime end of the business soon. Dreamworks is going to help distribute Millennium Actress, a big deal Japanese anime movie here in the new world. I got a cool poster but it's all rolled up until I get it framed, so no picture. Sorry.       As you may have gathered, some people like their anime very much. These beach towels are for those persons that would feel naked going for a dip without a cartoon girl by their side. No. I did not buy one. But I wanted too.       These are Japanese style hanging posters that just need a thumbtack or a nail or something. The one on the right has characters from my favorite Japanese TV cartoon, Cowboy BeBop. They're all bounty hunters that live on Mars in the future and drive spaceships and stuff. Did I mention that it's a cool show? No? OK, I just did.       I love a girl in a uniform.       The rest of the pictures are signs and projections and stuff that were advertising sundry new anime TV shows and movies. There is going to be a 24-hour anime channel coming to America sometime in the near future, which should be pretty cool.

      Went to the Anime Expo yesterday in Anaheim and took some pics of the funsters in another reality right here on good old planet Ganymede, uh, Earth. I met Peter from J-list, linkage over there on the sidebar under  urlLink Yellow Fever , and various and sundry not so readily identifiable peoples. If you're interested this will be the subject of a little review with more pics on my  urlLink other  blog , the one that I'm sending my potential employers to as examples of my writing. Don't feel obliged though, a few people that read this thing can't stand the other one, and those readers tend to find this one a bit juvenile. They should see the xanga one.     Met a new white guy in Di Vang tonight, Mickey. Ed and I always joke about meeting other white guys at the cafes, threatening to throw them out so we can keep the numbers down. The idea, of course is that we should try to make contact with the Vietnamese customers to expand our 'simplistic American' horizons. Of course mostly we just talk to the girls. At least I do. I've only met one creepy white guy so far, the rest have been OK. Mickey is pretty cool, a graphic designer and writer, and the girls seem to like him too. He's young, he's committed no crime, he can stay.  I went to meet the publisher of the local paper today, missed him, and wound up talking to the publisher of a local Vietnamese weekly in the same building. They have four pages out of about seventy in English, and they're looking for stories from 'Merckens from the outside looking in on the Viet community. I've given a copy to the lovely Monique to peruse and fill me in on what the locals are yabbering about so I can tailor something to the demographic.  Post Lakers (arghh!) the TVs are tuned to soccer, or as we say here, funny euro-football, interspersed tonight with Christina Aguilera videos. I was thinking about this today, and the reason why soccer (or euro-f-ball) is so popular is testament to the success of Empire. You know, the Spanish, French, Belgian, Dutch, and British ones. Here in the land of the free, we reject empire, and funny football, and rightly so. We've conquered Japan with baseball, but only after, you know, the bomb and all that. And we are slowly conquering Europe with basketball because of how much money we pay these guys, and we only take half their money in taxes (unless they manage to get good accountants, in which case they can write off the bling-bling as a business expense). We tried to do it with McDonalds' and Disney but the wackos still manage to complain while munching Royales avec fromage. Then they send their best guys here, their local TV stations get to fly here and cover the games, expense accounts are padded and everyone's happy.
