      i spent the morning kickboxing at Amore. it was very, very fun! that is about the only exercise that can keep me focused. i am recovering.  while watching tv in the dining room, dad told me that to venture into the overseas market if i can find a job there. i asked him whether it is mission impossible for me to find a job again. he didn't answer.  i am upset and i can't help feeling worried. at least, the medicine is taking a hold on me. even if i got a job, can i assure myself that i won't get into trouble with the boss? the colleagues? and the work? i hope at least probation is for 3 months' period.  ok, i got to stop here. dad is here again.

      There are no highlights. The 2 job applications I had required qualifications higher than a degree. But I sent in anyway. Besides, ever since I had to prepare for 5 interviews the other time, I didn't send enough applications to grant me other interviews.  I have been reading the papers diligently. I hope I will end up with one of the organisations which are mentioned frequently in them.   Saturday is 2 days away. I hope there are enough job vacancies out there. I want to get into a People Developer company. Hey, Mediacorp is not one, right?  I have been reading the magazines I bought last time when I had money. I have skipped several sections featuring clothes, accessories and the like. Now, upon reading them, I wish I have the money to buy them. Giordana is value-for-money and nice clothes, they sell but I feel like I am an ubiquitous object on the street. Besides, I am getting older. I wish to doll myself up often. I can't believe the illness I had caused me to balloon so badly. I wonder when I will be 52kg again.  Will somebody leave a comment to let me know you are reading my journal, please? It is just a click away.

      All the 4 jobs that I have gone interview for the last 2 months did not get through.  I am faced with incessant naggings at home. I wished I have prepared more for the interview. Coping or rather struggling with the stresses being a young adult, I can’t help feeling depressed/lousy/upset with my current state. I am already 24. When I was in EI, a 24 year old adult can be promoted to the position of assistant manager.  This week’s Recruit is divided into 2 sections, making it look like there are more jobs available. I am adopting a new strategy of sending in applications one day before the deadline because I notice I will get an interview if I send it this way. At least, including the 2 interviews I had after I graduated, 3 out of 6 of them had applications sent in this manner.  Yesterday, a temporary instructor conducted the Amore class I attended because the original lad was on medical leave. It was a terrible class. I did the steps correctly but the rest of the class, including the instructor was on the wrong track. My sister suggested complaining to the management but took back her words for fear that I would be blacklisted if the instructor was on good terms to other instructors that I may come across later.  Life has never been this horrible.  [July 20 11.35am]

      I really hope the agent will call me up today for the OE job. I have already bought pants for my new job. Is she going to call me up for interview? I hope so badly.  2 weeks’ grace is up for IP job offer. The 3 deities are not accurate in their communication with me.   I am quite scared that I won’t have a job offer at all for the next 2 months. The papers said people usually found jobs within 3 months. I am into my 2nd month.   My head is spinning. Good morning everyone! I hope Andrew and BK died in their sleep last night.  [July 16 8.58am]  I received a mail from IP HR personnel informing me that they “regret not offering a position at this juncture”. How beautifully phrased.  The OE temp job is not successful either.   I am worried sick. My headache is getting worse.  [July 16 2.25pm]

      the deity communicated to me that i will get the job at IP, that i will get it almost instantaneously. my mum's heartbeat skipped whenever she heard my handphone ringing.  i hope i have answered the CEO "correctly".  i met up with some employment agents yesterday. one behaved like an babaric bitch. the other was as sweet as an angel. both told me that they will source jobs for me. i hope so.  my chest hurts recently. i wonder whether my sickness will go away soon.

      my parents are into praying deities with paganistic practises. to me, it is not so much of a bad thing since my parents remain as very good and kind people. that's why i say that nice people are not necessarily good and kind people.  anyway, due to the recent uneventful job interviews that i had, i am into this kind of praying. i have gone to 2 deities and they communicated to me that i will get the job with IP.  however, i am reaching the 2 weeks' deadline after the second interview. my chances are getting slimmed and my hopes seem to be getting dashed!  my mum is bringing me to another deity with aunt chua. i wonder what will this deity tell me about my IP job?? haha.  i still hate andrew lau for ruining my career. does anybody know how to curse? i really hope i will get a job now. a permanent job which will enable me to pay my medical bills, house bills and get some pretty clothes and shoes.   my headache is acting up again....does anyone bother to comment? i wish to communicate with real human beings! *flash a charming smile*

      I considered myself lucky for having granted 5 interviews within a period of 2 months. There was one where there were 2 rounds of interview and I got in. All except two belong to government jobs.   Staying at home remains a torture. I wonder whether gran is having Parkinson or Alzheimer because she kept "reminding" me to study hard when I was in the 2nd year after graduation. My mother kept comparing me to all my friends who have found work and who are working happily with/for their bosses.  If not for those medicine, I would have lapsed into depression. It is a cold, cruel, competitive and heartless society out there. A place dominated by males whose lives revolve sex, competition and money.   How are you doing out there?

      uncle paco,  cousin ling came today and she reminded me not to quit my current job because no employer will want someone who can't stay long in their jobs. they will not know why because they will deny my opportunities being granted an interview.  i am feeling queasy.  i know that if the next interview comes along and i get the job, i have to hang on no matter what happens. i hope MOE will call me up soon.  By the way, my previous boss Andrew from Mediacorp is being classified by my cousin as someone not having correct work ethics because he tells lies about me when we had a confrontation. i bet he told lies about me to my GM who has a foul mouth.  do you have anything to tell me? i am on suicide pangs.

      I am officially out of job for 2 months. Coming to the mid-August, the count will become 3.   I will be enlisting my service as a social escort because that's the only way I know will let me earn at least 2000 dollars per month. But I am not a wild person at heart so I won't charge as high as 500 dollars for 3 hours. However, all these provided if any high-flyer executive gets to read my profile on the left.  I am going to put my last company as the LAST COMPANY I work with in my resume because I don't want to jeopardise my chances being even shortlisted. I will have to take a 50-50 chance of the new company not calling up my last company. But in all honesty, I was shabbily treated by the Senior Manager and the Business Director. But I know there is no justice because there are a lot of bird-brained bosses who get influenced easily by their subordinates. So I am saying I am taking a 50-50.  This is the Lamb speaking. I wish I am like Mary who earns 3000-4000 a month. I will if anyone out there enlists my services as a social escort.
