      Back to Ohio in.....1 week, 2 days and 12 1/2 hours. Urgh..do I have to go. New York is a special little place, it does something freaky to you. It's nice though. With the frickin wonderful events of the summer..I love coming up here to be near my mom and get away from all the immature shite you can't help but getting involved in. I must be getting my period bc I am about ready to rant. I think the other reason I am dreading going back to Ohio, other then leaving my mom and family....is going back to my friends. lol....and earlier I out a nice post in about them. But I'm not saying that I am dreading going back to them bc thye are horrible people, bc they certinly aren't...it's just that I hate not having the feeling that they support and believe in what I am and want to be. They all know each other and know the things that make them "them"..but with me I feel fake, like I am the stupid friend..and I know that is mainly my fault bc I am kind of stupid sometimes...but really now, how much am I going to know about America, if not having lived here for that long. I really am not that stupid...it's just I am not the best person with words, and so sometimes I try and say something that comes out wrong and sounds like it makes no sense..but oh thats ok...bc it's just silly Jacuqe   LOL PITY PARTY RIGHT HERE *points to self*   wow thats really what it sounds like isn't it? Well maybe I will take up a good idea of my dear knows me friend nicole, who looks at her horiscope every day...maybe that will tell me something interesting that I can look at for...to take my mind off crazy teen girl hormones..hmmm sounds juicy

      Oh my garwsh...I woke up at 11am today...and AM rather then a PM...go freakin me. I also went to bed at a reasonable hour...midnight to be exact..but here is good reasoning for this. Yesterday I decided that I have a real problem..and to a stop it must come. WELL not really a stop bc there is no fun in that...but maybe we can just cut it down a little? Yes that will work Well heres the problem..I bought 5 pairs of shoes yesterday..taking my grand shoe total for the past 5 weeks up to ..hmmmm...10 pairs of shoes.. You know what..I think that evens out nicely..that is only 2 pairs a week..but still with the whole object of car insurance and drivers ed coming up I really must start saving my dough..and I think I have enough shoes to last me a nice while.  So sad as I am to say, but no more shoes for Jacque, for this holiday anyways.

       Mwah, hah ha ha...It is 3.47am and I am writing a post...I don't want to go home :(  I know I still have 2 weeks left here in my little NY paradise..But still, I'm gone miss it. Guys, whoever is picking me up for the airport better have hersheys bars and Ben and jerrys waiting somewhere in the vicinity.  I can't sleep anymore. I have decided, that's all there is too it, I have become a semi-insomniac..It's actually quite a fun little thing. Wondering around the house, being the only one awake....Staying up till the birds start to sing again...And the sun rises...And then of course finally falling asleep.  But it is so strange. I have found that I can sleep so easily back in Ohio. But up here I think so much, it's like life up here isn't real. Like any second now I am going to step out into the street..And my life will be taken..And I will have wasted it in this dream...Yes that is how life is for me here..So sweet that you don't expect it to last.  I think that is why it is so hard getting adjusted back in Ohio...Because down there problems are real..And I have to stick out and face them on my own, up here I have my mom, my real mom, not someone separated by a step. I love my mommy..And yes I still call her moma. But I just can't wait I think..To go back and live my down there..And then next year be up here for real..To live.  I must be bipolar..I keep having these mixed feelings. Ok short and sweet I love it here I love it there, I love life so much right now thatit scares me..But in an exciting way, like I  have  to live tomorrow like its my last..Even though it may not be, life is just more fun that way....I love it..I can't wait for so&nbsp;much...I really need some patience..And sleep

      Oh God, I love Music There really is no other way to out it, other then 'Oh God'. It's just freakin awesome isn't it. You can be in any mood and music can either take&nbsp;you out of it, or just heighten it. For ex. The Killers - "  Andy Your&nbsp;a&nbsp;Star  ". Such an awesome song...you have to hear it. So as of now everyone reading this is required to either&nbsp;illegally download it (which I don't suggest) *wink wink* mister officer......OR just go buy it. Plain&nbsp;and simple. Get it? S off to work tonight...and depressed I will be without my music...but instead I will take   Dirty Dancing 2   and watch it like I do every night I work. That is the joy of working in the video store....you can watch videos! Wow...yea its fun. So I willl be at work, shakin my god given bon bons to "  Represent Cuba  "....and it will be bloody fantastic...that's all I have to say about that

        Arghhh...I wish my brain would work to at least a third of its potential. It really sucks not knowing that Boston is in Massachutas....Ok just to make up for this silly, idiotic thing to do.....I am British or at least lived there for most of my life (and I didn't study America while doing so)...so leave me alone with you crazy American geographical questions.      Anyways, went into NYC today....God I love just being there...It either increases my dream...Or slightly breaks it down, depending on the mood I am in, but one day I will safely own an apartment there and an Art Gallery...So there...Just letting you know...For future reference.      But the city is a fun place...But I was thinking on the way back, it must be a real pain in the ass to go grocery shopping if you live like right in the midtown or uptown areas, bc its not like you have a krogers near by...Or a Target. Now the latter would be more important then the first but still...How do they get groceries? Shirley they can't all be crazy health, vegan, organic people and shop only at special stores. I really should get clued up on this before I make my home there.      Well I suppose that's all for the day..Unless later I think of something really quirky to say which will look very stupid in the morning..Or around 3pm...When I should wake up

      Wow..it has been quite a while for me...havent written in here for quite a number of days...ok a week. It is a beautiful day outside, and there is that smell in the air. The one where everything is peaceful and no matter how down you  feel, you feel amazing, because its an "everything is going to work out" smell. You know, the spring clean smell, or the beginnings of fall, end of summer smell. The happy start over because its a new season smell.  I like that. I am attempting to organize my room, so it is senior year acceptable. Right now it is a cluster of little girl ornaments and sweet 16 artifacts. I am not going to be sweet 16 as of saturday. I am going to be 17, and older and ready to tackle my school year with full force. Frankly that is something I have never done, and it is time I started taking action, inseatd of being all talk, which I have been pretty much my whole life. The worst thing is, about this all talk thing, is that I talk myself out of things, before they have even begun. Now that is just pathetic. So I am kind of stuck in this moment, I want to go back to school , but I am a little afraid of the upcoming changes. I have to get a job, which is something I havent had here since last year, and its scary, because if I do things, I like to be good at them. I take alot of pride in doing a good job, and getting good feedback. And I never have really been in a good job down here, well considering my only job down here was at IGA and that wasnt the best of places. Working in New York was awesome because people are so nice, so its not hard to get along. But here....well quite frankly its intimidating! Also starting college, even if it is just PSEO...and getting my license, and balancing them all nicley, urgh....so much. lol, its really not that big a deal, its just coming to realise that life isnn't going to be as easy as it was junior year. It is going to be harder, but it will def. all be worth it...SO BRING IT ON

      Urghh...I leave in 5 hours..I really can't take this, I'm feeling a breakdown coming on. If I go back to Ohio..and Laura and Halie and such are still the same..I am talking to dad, bc that will drive me insane..lol or maybe I am just being mean bc I am sad. I am going to miss my mom so much, but its not like I am never going to see her again..I think its just that fear from the times that I had to leave and never knew when I would see her again. Thats a real sucky feeling. But I will be back before I know it..and then next year it will be for sure, and no more of this back and forth stuff.

      I just have this great urge to write something. And I want it to be good, a nice little rant. I did in my AIM profile, and it was nice. I liked it..Felt good. I am currently trying to look at colleges, and assessing the way things will be when I go back to Ohio. I am actually kind of scared. I'm not trying to go all Dirty Dancing here but I am scared of leaving New York and not feeling the way I do when I am here. That is the huge thing I hate about Ohio. I wish that I could say I am strong enough to do what I want, say what I want, wear what I want, but I can't. Not down there. Nobody is really. So why should I break the chain. Why should I step out and test the waters before everyone else. I am sick of that. I remember a trip that I went on with my school. We went to Germany and stayed in this really nice lodge, out in nature, which we all hated of course. The first day there it was sweltering hot so we decided to go to the pool. Of course no one would jump in, afraid that it was to cold, and not willing to take the first initial shock. So I did. I just ran and it was the best feeling. But of course that feeling lasted for about two seconds, when my head came above the water and the look of admiration from my young peers faces disappeared and they all forgot. Forgot that I had tested the waters for them. Now it may not seem like a big deal, but it was to me. I am sick of testing the waters for others, I want to start testing my own waters. My private beach, not the public one. If that doesn't make sense to anyone reading this I don't care. It's not supposed to make sense to you. Just like those poems you read of mine. And then laughed at, and proceeded to quote like they were a joke. It wasn't to me. What you didn't realize, and apparently didn't even think to realize, is that those poems were written in really hard times. And not just hard times, but times when I had to question what makes my life worth living. So I wrote those things down, the things so important to me that they made me want to live. Like New York, and Art, and Time. But you laughed, because they mend nothing to you, and in a way I ment nothing in that time. So thank you...To those who laughed, I forgive you, but think next time. And thanks most to the one person who didn't laugh, a sincere thanks, to Nicole. I guess admist this rant of utter randomness I am paying homage to her, BC she is awesomely nice, and in something that was supposed to explain her realizing herself, with a little help from me, I actually realized myself. So its kind of like a you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours, we both get a lot out of our friendship and that's awesome, I love her. I don't think I have ever had a friendship were I actually feel like more then a friend. Not in a sexual sense of course but in a sense where I am also like a mentor, and she is to me. We help each other realize things we hadn't before. I think that is a lot from us both having extremely different backgrounds...We help each other see the things we missed BC our pasts were different..If you catch my drift. But if you don't that's ok, BC the one person who is supposed to, Nicole, she will...She even knows what I am saying with my mouth full....LOL that's when you have a keeper. Ha so rant away again....I wasn't finished...I tend to get distracted by words that sounds great and just start on another path. So I am also scared about college...argh it is a year away. Well this is the basics...I know I want to be well known for something...Art or acting. Or Fashion Design. They all are great prospects and things I know I could do good in. But I don't know why I want to be well known. It's just something I want. It's certainly not BC I sit watching "The Fabulous life of....." On VH1 or BC I regularly read all the gossip celebrity magazines. I am guessing that it is BC I want to change things. Now I am not naive and I now there is no way I can change the world, But I want to get my voice out there, and I love acting by far, and I love being able to transform into a different person. But I think really the real reason I want to be known, is so I can help. Yes that sounds extremely "Miss pageant" material, but I really do. I love helping people, and I figure, hey kill two birds with one stone, do something I love and get my voice out there. I would love to be a role model, all though I fear I won't be too successful at it..But it's just such a respectable thing, I really respect those who are seen as role models. I don't know, I think this blog just shows so much is on my mind, and it really sucks, BC I want to enjoy the rest of my time here, and then go back to Ohio and just get into school..And do good so I can make these colleges..And not have to worry anymore..And be back here..My real home..New York My hands are growing tired and so is my head..So I think it's time to sleep..Before I think to more and begin another 12 page rant...So goodnight to whoever...God I guess..Or anything watching over me..All though I have full belief it is God..He really is my homeboy...Gods cool..Not as strict as you would think, and he has a bloody awesome sense of humor.

      Thats a good line....from an even better book....I can't remember the title though. What  I do remember is my little group of friends sitting around the lunch table reading parts of it and giggling like little school girls. Good times for all. Well I am back from NY in 6 days. Nicole is picking me up being the good friend that she is. The rest of my week consists of going to see "Raising Helen" and "The Village", ; a trip to either Alantic City, The Reneissence Festival or Dorney Park. Also work and shopping of course....maybe I could get a new pair of shoes. So I am trying to make the best of this week...bc it will be a couple of months till I am up again...and then nxt year I shall LIVE HERE mwah hahahaha lol But Exciting news...I got an art internship for next year. Right here in New York...and I get pay aswell. It is a very exciting for me bc I have been thinking about my future recently and I have this big fear that I am going to be stuck in an office and do nothing with my life. Its a scary prospect and then this popped up and I'm like hey I have something to work for thats pretty much settled ya know...so its a good thing...I'm excited
