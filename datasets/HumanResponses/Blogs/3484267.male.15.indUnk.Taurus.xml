      First of all, I am not really as stupid as I make myself sound.  It is just my way of being funny.  If you don't like it, tuf.  Anyway, I enjoy doing lots of things.  I am on the Marchingband Team and I wish I still had a soccer team.  Unfortunitly, they no longer have a team for my age group.  I am medium hight, blue eye's, and blond.  I have a ferternal twin brother named Andrew.  He can be just as stupid as me sometime but he is not so bad.  It is a little wierd having a twin brother.  Not many people get to enjoy such a quality amount of time with the only person you will ever tell a secret with.  I am 15 years old and I am in the 9th grade.  My favorite subjects in school are gym and art.  In my free time I enjoy playing video games, reading an interesting book (if i can find one) and hanging out with my friend.  I know for a fact that one of my friends has a web site here to.  His name is Goron.  The main gist of his web site is called, "America's slice of Boznian Pie."  In case you missed it, he is Boznian (I hoped I spelled that right).  I also have a lot of trouble spelling.  If I ever I.M. you or if you read more of my typings you will see that i often say what I did two lines up.  Other than that I hope I would be called average.  Not including the fact that I am a twin.  Hopefully my next post will be about that (that is what I am intending it to be).  Keep reading (if there is anything left to read) and enjoy my web site.

      I don't get it, why are you still reading this.  What kind of a person wants to get lost reading a web page.  What is wrong with you.  What is your problem.  If you Want something serious, go to someone elses web page.  Not mine!!!!!!!

      This is a story that I have known for a little while and it meant a lot to me at the time and is now starting to mean more to me with my Grandmother losing ground.  The story goes like this.     There was once a little child that was constantly making trouble between his friends at school and his family.  So his father took him into the backyard and told him this.  "Every time you do something that you know is not right, I want you to put a nail in that fence post."  The boy agreed and he started right away nailing into the fence post.  When the post was filled up completely, his father said, "Now I want you to find as many of the people that you did something to and say you are sorry for the acts that you committed.  And when you do, I want you to take the nail you put in the fence out.  The boy did as his father had told him.  It took him about a week and when he was done he ran up to his father and exclaimed, "Look father,  all of the nails have been pulled out."  "Yes, your right," His father said, "now look at the post and tell me what you see."  The boy was puzzled and said, "All I see is a fence post with a lot of holes in it."  "That's right," his father told him, "Every time you hurt someone you put a hole in there heart.  When you said you were sorry for that particular act, you took the nail out.  Even though you did the right thing and apologized, you will still leave a hole from were you hurt them.
