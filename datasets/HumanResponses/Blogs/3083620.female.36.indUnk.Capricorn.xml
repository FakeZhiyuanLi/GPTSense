      I have about 6 blogs going right now.  I think I need a couple more personalities to keep them all going!  Most of them are private because I am coming out of a cocoon stage in my life.    My grasp of the tech aspects of the blog are lacking, but it’s been an amazing release and medium of expression for me.  I feel like it gives the people in my life some deeper access to what I am thinking, feeling or manifesting in my life.    Welcome to my blog and thanks for being a part of this one.  ~leela  urlLink  http://leelajade.blogspot.com/

       urlLink     Dedication to God is developed by commitment to one's spiritual practices for God's sake. Service to others is the outgoing movement of the heart prompted by compassion. It neutralizes the deep-rooted tendency to become preoccupied with our own spiritual journey and how we are doing. The habit of service to others is developed by trying to please God in what we do and by exercising compassion for others, beginning with those with whom we live.  -  urlLink Open Mind, Open Heart  by  urlLink Father Thomas Keating

      good to see some action here...   What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves? This is the most important of all voyages of discovery, and without it, all the rest are not only useless, but disastrous.  -  urlLink Thomas Merton

      Hello ITH!  I have been reading this book that should help me get ready for an exam to obtain permanent certification as a teacher in Texas, since I have an "out-of-the-country certification" and need to get acquainted with the American education system. A few things have called for my attention and resonated with my “ urlLink Integral  Philosophy” so I thought about sharing with you all:  DOMAIN I: Designing Instruction and Assessment to Promote Student Learning . Competency 001:  The teacher understands human development processes and applies this knowledge to plan instruction and ongoing assessment that motivate students and are responsive to their developmental characteristics and needs. “This competency relates to the importance of teachers having basic understanding of the principles of human development in its many dimensions: physically, mentally or cognitively, emotionally, and socially. It is also important that teachers appreciate a dynamic and interactive view of human development. Thus, effective teachers must be sensitive to and knowledgeable of both personal characteristics of students and characteristics of their environment.”  So, first domain, first competency… wow, all teachers at  urlLink yellow ? That would be awesome! …Wait, “physically, mentally or cognitively, emotionally and socially” …What about  urlLink SPIRITUALLY ???

      I don't want to sound like a bitch, but is there enough connection between all of us to warrant at blog for ITH?  I don't want to betray anyone's confidences but most of us seem to have some spoken or unspoken issues between us (including me)that might need attention before we take this step.  I am just putting it out there.  I have no expectation that we blog or not blog.  Of course I would love to see unity in the IN community for all of our benefits, but there is timing and reality to take into consideration.  For me aside from being really busy in my day to day, like I know we all are, I need to have some assurance that this is a safe and functional space before I can commit my energy to this blog.  I have a deep respect for each of you regardless of an unresolved or even non-existent issues between us.  If this blog can facilitate growth then I am here, if not then I think for me I need some personal healing and or clarification between myself and others on the ITH staff before I get "naked"  ~leela

      Take a piece of paper as large and/or thin as you want. This is your world.   Fold it in half any way you’d like; Buddha teaches that this fold is  Samma Ditthi , the “Right Understanding,” the first step on the Path to Enlightenment.   Fold it in half again; accept this as  Samma Sankappa , the “Right Attitude of Mind.”   Fold it in half a third time; this is called  Samma Vacha , the “Right Speech.”  Again, fold it in half; it is  Samma Kammanta , the “Right Action.”   Your fifth equal fold is  Samma Ajiva , the “Right Livelihood.”   Know the sixth equal fold you make as  Samma Vayama , the “Right Effort.”   Remember your seventh equal fold as  Samma Sati , the “Right Recollection.”   And the Eighth Fold is  Samma Samadhi , the “Right Meditation” at the threshold of Nirvana.   You will not fold it eight times. You probably will have difficulty folding it the seventh time with just your bare hands. With the seventh fold, you have changed your flat “world” into the beginnings of a sphere, and no one can fold a sphere. How you achieve the Eight Fold [and the seven Sammas before it] is your concern.   Since nothing can be folded in half more than seven times, then nothing can be equally unfolded more than seven times. All mysteries contain no more than seven equal “folds” waiting to be undone.
