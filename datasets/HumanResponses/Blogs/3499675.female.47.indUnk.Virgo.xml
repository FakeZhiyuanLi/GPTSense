      Happy Memorial Day. ( = I haven’t done ca-ca all day except play on the computer and listen to music. It’s truly a beautiful day outside but because I am the size of a small whale, I am taking cover inside where I am sweating my ass off. Hard to believe I was once able to wear a two piece bathing suit seeing as now I wouldn’t be caught outside in shorts and a tee. I remember wondering how obese people allowed themselves to get to such a vastness, now I one of those who other people wonder about. It’s a lot easier to become one of those fat people than most realize. The diet always starts tomorrow or even on Monday and this is always the last time you’ll eat like this. Behavior like that goes on for a few years then one day you wake up and you’re a blimp. Too bad losing it isn’t as easy or as pleasant as gaining it was. ( =  I want to start walking again but somehow I hurt my knee a couple weeks ago. I was walking twice a day, one short morning walk (about 15 to 20 minutes) and one longer evening walk (around 30 minutes). I have no idea why I stopped, one day I didn’t feel like doing it and that became 2 days and then 3 and so on. Now I have to begin again. Sad thing is it took me weeks to be able to walk as far as I was walking. When I started I was so completely out of shape I could only walk for about 10 or 15 minutes. Getting to 30 minutes was quite an accomplishment. I have been watching my food and cutting back on my Diet Pepsi intake for about 3 weeks now and I do notice a slight difference in not only how I feel but also in my body. My tummy seems to have gone down a tad. It feels like it’s going to take forever to return to a normal size.  So, what dirty little secret should I confess to tonight? I have been married for 25 years on May 11. Most people get less time for murder. At one time I suppose our marriage was okay, but that was ages ago. We married when we were 22 years old because I was pregnant. I truly believe if I had not been with child, we would never have married. We are two totally different people. Our personalities are absolute opposites, I’ve always been more outgoing, louder, more opinionated, less likely to allow someone to push me around. I like to deal with issues right away. I get visibly angry. He, on the other hand, is much more withdrawn, has difficulty communicating with people and rarely speaks up against anyone. He is passive/aggressive, deals with his anger by kicking the dog. I tried to be a good mom and wife, got up at 5 am, made breakfast, packed lunches, cleaned house, did laundry, cooked dinner, baked cookies all while I worked, went to school and dealt with the kids. Now that I think about it, I had been unhappily married for a very long time before I finally realized it. I tried to discuss this with him, I told him what I needed, wanted, and all my wishes simply fell on deaf ears. I was unhappy but he was content. One day, I got tired of being the only one who seemed to be attempting to make this marriage work so, I quit. I quit cooking, quit cleaning and I moved out of the bedroom. Two weeks later he wanted to “talk”. I was no longer interested in “talking” or anything else. I figured eventually we’d go see a marriage councilor or something, but after awhile I realized I just do not want to spend the rest of my life with him. It’s not as if he is a bad man, he just isn’t a good husband for ME. The only reason we are still together is lack of money. If I had any, I would have been long gone, and I am sure he feels the same. We simply exist in the same living space. I have no idea what he thinks is going to become of us in the future. Our youngest child leaves for college in the fall, leaving the oldest one (that’s a whole other story) still at home. We haven’t been a couple for six years. I haven’t had sex in 6 years!! No wonder I’m so depressed. So much for my declaration, I’m sorry it’s not all that dramatic. I’m sure sooner or later I’ll own up a few more sordid stories. Bad marriages are pretty much run of the mill now a day.   Tomorrow is my “Staring Over” day. I promise myself to call a few pharmacists to ask their advice on this “distance” college.  ::keeping my fingers crossed:: I am trying to keep myself from getting too hopeful, I’ve always been told if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and this sounds perfect. It would be wonderful if this works out. I sooooooooooooo want this to be good.  In addition to the calls, I want to put a sizeable dent in the mess around here. It is disgusting. It’s so horrible I actually have no idea where to start. Wish me luck. ( =

      I am fat, unemployed, uneducated and unhappy. I hate this subsistence I have allowed myself to fall into. Nearly 100 pounds overweight, old, unattractive, broke, and useless. I hate what I have allowed to happen to me. I didn’t used to be so pathetic. I once had promise, possibility, a future. Now, I am simply a large blob taking up space on an already over-populated planet. I need to get my huge ass in gear. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to have purpose. I want my life to have a meaning. I want a reason to get out of bed every morning that has nothing to do with who is on Dr. Phil or Oprah. So, this is my beginning, a commencement of sorts. I am going to figure out a way to lose weight, get a job, finish my education and be a successful, healthy, happy me again. It’s quite an overwhelming undertaking.  How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Perhaps that was not the best analogy for one is about to embark on a serious weight loss journey, although I found it pitifully appropriate. I somehow need to devise a plan to improve my life and I’m going to document it right here. You’re welcome to watch and offer advice.  I am a nearly 48 year old mother of 3, (son 24, daughter 22, son 18), who spent the bulk of my adult life being a “mom”. I did it all, I sewed their clothes, I was room mom, head room mom, PTA president, team mom, soccer coach, high school soccer and even Special Events Coordinator for our local soccer region. I took a girl’s soccer team to Hawaii, which took excessive fund-raising as well as battling uninvited parents and bitter superiors. I coached several of my daughter’s teams to tri-section finals. I was, and still am, the only girl’s coach in our area to win back to back regional championships. I returned to college when I was 36 years old earning my AA degree in Liberal Arts (with a 3.95 GPA) while working full time as a waitress and coaching my daughter’s team. My dream was to be a high school English teacher. I received a large scholarship to continue my education at a university but, because of the economy, and extremely bad business judgments, my father lost his business, leaving my husband unemployed. At that time I had to concentrate on making money therefore my further schooling was placed on the back burner. Seems that’s where my decline into despair begun. I have yet to return to school, I keep getting fatter and fatter, my house (we actually live in a 2 bedroom, rundown trailer) is always a mess, my marriage is a façade and I am borderline depressed. Somehow, somewhere I lost all my desire and aspiration. Now, I simply exist from one day to the next, sleep walking through the years. I was extremely lethargic with my life until my daughter’s graduation (she graduated from a 4 year private university, Go Her!!) two weekends back. One of the guest speakers was a woman who was graduating at the mature age of 67. Listening to her tell her story truly inspired me. If she can go back and graduate at her age, I could definitely do it as well at my age. Why not? Somehow watching another accomplish her goal reassured me I could also attain mine.   First things first though. I am so mortified at my enormous girth; the idea of going to school at this point is humiliating. I MUST lose these extra pounds I am allowing to hold me back. I am an embarrassment not only to myself but to my children as well. I absolutely loathe going out in public for fear of being spotted by someone who knows me or my children. A quick trek to 7/11 practically ignites a stress attack. I weigh close to 250 pounds and on a medium 4’ 11” frame I often resemble Jaba the Hut. My wardrobe consists of sweat pants, oversized tee shirts and a worn out pair of tennis shoes. Even if I wanted to return to school in the fall, I don’t even have the clothes to do so.   That brings me to objective number 2, getting a job. I have worked in food service for years, excluding the past 2. I have always been a server and made good money, (I am horrible when it comes to saving money, but I’ll go into that at another time). I can’t wait on tables any longer; restaurant work is more geared to the cuter, skinner, younger babes. I need to find a vocation in which age isn’t such a determined factor in employment. I found an online Pharmaceutical Technician program from Education Direct which definitely appears too good to be true. I could study at home in my spare time, take exams online and not have to sit in a classroom. The information in the pamphlet suggests I could complete the course in as little as 12 months. Small down payment of $10 and a monthly fee of $32 which I can handle. Tuesday I am going to call a couple pharmacists to see if this program is legit. If so, I will enroll right away. If anyone has any information concerning pharmacy tech school, please, enlighten me. ( =  I don’t want to wear out my welcome so I will close for now. Thank you for your patience and curiosity, I’ll be back tomorrow.

      Another day has almost come and gone Can't imagine what else could wrong Sometimes I'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door A single battle lost but not the war ('cause)  Tomorrow's another day And I'm thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  It's almost like the hard times circle 'round A couple drops and they all start coming down Yeah, I might feel defeated, I might hang my head I might be barely breathing - but I'm not dead  Tomorrow's another day And I'm thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  I'm not gonna let it get me down I'm not gonna cry And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight
