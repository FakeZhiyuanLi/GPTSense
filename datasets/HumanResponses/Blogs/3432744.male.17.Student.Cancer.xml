       Hey!  It's been a while since I last posted, I know.  I was gone all weekend up to a summer camp for staff orientation (Going to be working up there from July 3-July 30 so not much updating will happen then, if any).  It's a Christian camp and the first day was devoted to the spiritual side of our job and the second was the standard "If A Kid Goes Missing, Do This" kind of day.  The first day though, we had 40 minutes to go anywhere in the camp and be alone (because the theme of the summer is "Be still, and know that I am God." Psalm 46:10) because in the silence, God speaks to you.  I don't know about everyone else, but my 40 minutes was spent figuring out my social life and when it was all done, a lot was sorted out.  1 - Hates      This one I had before I went up.  There had been a lot of people I've hated the past two months and at one point or another, every one of my friends had something negative/cruel said about them in one way or another.  I had narrowed my list down to one simple hate: The New Boyfriend (and technically the entity he and my ex form when they're together.  It's like watching Voltron when they're together :D) 2 - Why?      This was what needed sorting out.  I thought I hated him because of his "fondling her + looking me in the eyes" crap that he pulled on me, but I knew it had to run deeper than that.  And I realized something.  Although she'll NEVER admit to it, whether she's afraid to hurt my feelings or she doesn't conciously believe it herself, she dumped me to be with him.  There's no other logical reasoning that can explain why she hooked up with him after one week.  And when I look at him, I know that he's better than me.  There's something about him that makes him better than me.  There's something more dateable/likeable/boyfriendable in him that I never had or don't have.  I can be with him because of this feeling that he is better.  I see how happy she is with him and that just shows there's something he has that I never can have and actually makes her start to like him while dating me.  So that's why I hate him and that's why I want to see him suffer. 3 - Her      I don't hate her.  One of the things we learned up at the orientation was to act like brothers towards your girl friends (not romance, friends who are girls :D).  Whether or not this meant in the spiritual/metaphysical "Sisters in Christ" ideal or just in general, I'm not sure.  All I know is that I want to be there for all of my girls who are friends.  And this sounds like a spiritual contradiction (not forgiving him and being caring towards others) but its very difficult, right now, for me to say I can forgive him.  There are hurt and then there's deeply scarring hurt and right now, my bag of forgiveness towards him is close to none.  There's my rambling.  My life is starting to sort itself out and I'm closer to 100% than I had been before.  I'm afraid to say I'm all OK because the last time I did that, I only fell harder.  'Later Andy

       Okay, the secret was personalized t-shirts for everyone in the group.  I'm sure you all were just DYING to know :D.  There was a chemistry test today *dies*.  I think I did OK, some of the stuff was plain gibberish though.  Oh well...  I'm too tired and preoccupied to fill you in on the sad details of my meaningless existence, so I'll say good night for now :D.  'Later Andy

       It's Tuesday!  What can I bitch about today :).  Just in general, school was, at best, "meh".  I'm on edge with a few people and tommorow is supposed to be a huge thing for our large group.  I frankly don't like, nor want to be with, the group.  I have maybe four-six friends in there out of fifteen+ kids and the rest of them just have started to annoy me to death.  They've got a big secret planned for tommorow (which I know but am not at liberty to say :D) but I really don't feel like going.  A friend, and also another ex-girlfriend (that's a topic for later on tonight or tommorow though :D), is saying that I'll get shunned if I don't go.  I'm already shunning the majority of them so that's no big deal.   I hate all this inner conflict and confusion.  Just messes me up in the end.  ah well, I'll post about whether or not I participate in it tommorow :D.  On a personal note: It's dawned on me.  Jenn, I know you'll see this :D.  Why can't I get my thing after 2nd period or something?  Why do I  NEED  to be there after school?  I'll explain more online.  Anywho, personal issues over.  The Internet now knows I have a friend named Jenn :D.  'Later Andy

       Okay.  I left off with a week between boyfriends...  One week, almost exactly one week, after we broke up, she started going out with another guy.  Personally, I knew him, but wasn't really friends with him, so not much was destroyed between the two of us.  If anything, I just hate him more.  Why?  Well, his own hypocrisy for one.  Apparently, he was afraid that I would hate him, so he did what anyone would do, he'd try to make conversation.  I can understand that.  If someone might potentially hate me, I know I'd try and make small talk.  See, he failed at that though because he's saying something, such as, "So what's new?" while either... a) Holding hands with my now ex-girlfriend b) Embracing, in some way, my ex-girlfriend c) All of the above.  In general,  A WHOLE LOT OF PDA . Here's a word to the wise: Don't try to get on the good side of your girlfriend's ex (assuming you have logical reason to try, such as in my case) by shoving his face in it.  You'll only end up with another enemy.  So I've avoided the two of them.  Frankly, I doubt they'll last.  Call me biased if you want to, but I'm not the only one who thinks it too.  People who know him better definitely think it too.  Plus, I guess he liked her the entire time we'd been going out (from our school's homecoming dance until the breakup) and "it hurt him to see us and our PDA."  That just sounds like a whole pile of bull to put it frankly.  Sounds like he's trying to milk physical affection out of her by amplifying a small ping of pain in his heart.  Then again, I do hate his guts and want to see the both of them emotionally suffer forever, so maybe my interpretation isn't the best one :D.  Certainly looks that way though...  Anyway, it feels like only two people (if any at all) read this, so right now I feel  reeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllly  stupid posting all of this :D.  Maybe someone will randomly find it, I know I'll try and advertise it a little better.  Oh well, I'll post again tonight if I feel like it or tommorow for sure.  Welcome to my sad, little world.  Enjoy your stay :D.  'Later Andy

       It's Monday.  Suprisingly today was a day that went by very quickly...hmm...I've got a project group for French class coming over soon so I figured why not post a new message with my free time! :D  So...personal life time.  What should you know?  Hmm...maybe my reasons for starting this page...  Aside from keeping just a journal and such, this lets me say what's on my mind and that I hopefully get feedback on it.  A couple of months ago, I got dumped...for the first time (insert cliche saying here).  We'd gone out for four months (almost) and then she kinda broke it off for no reason, at least not for any reason at the time.  We'd been friends since 7th grade or so and we agreeded that we should still try and be friends afterwards.  The first week was, what I guess is normal after a breakup.  Depression, anxiety, all those negative feelings that I never really expirienced for a long time.  After one week though, she started dating another guy...  Ahh, such drama!  Group is here so I'll post again later tonight!  'Later Andy

       It's sunday evening.  You know what this means for every teenager, HOMEWORK!  I've got a huge  A Raisin In The Sun  paper due Tuesday and I need a rough draft made for tommorow.  Maybe I should be writing that instead of doing this...nah...  I've been trying to  figure out what I want to do with this blog, so I've kinda decided to have it serve as a couple of main functions... -To keep track of what I do every day, similar to a diary or journal. -To display any poetry I write -To express my emotions or to let off any pressure by just shouting it into the vastness of cyberspace :D. This is what I want my page to be about.  A personal web page thats easier to manage and enjoy than anything Geocities, Angelfire, Tripod, etc... can offer.  In the next week or so, I'll fill anyone who cares in on more about my life and more personal reasons as to why this is here as well.  But for now, I should get back to my essay!

       This is my absolute first post.  I'm very interested in this endeavor and I just feel like recording my thoughts/feelings/emotions with the knowledge that someone out there has the ability to stumble onto it and see how odd of a person I am :D.  Until I figure out how to create a nicer looking profile, I'll tell you about myself.  My name's Andy.  I'm 16 (17 on July 13th) and I'm a junior in high school.  I'm tall, about 6'1, with red hair.  I love computers, bike riding, video games, and just being all around lazy!  My current status is unemployed (which means total income = $0) and I hope you all enjoy a look inside my mind.

       The one thing that made my day was  urlLink here .  It was on MSN's homepage and caught my attention (Readers get three guesses as to who in my life this is about :D.  Heehee...)  Anyway, bios.  I think it'd be easier and a lot less confusing if I gave bios and codenames to call them by, instead of just saying "my ex" or "the new boyfriend" etc... so here they are.  Tree: A best friend out of four, she's helped me a lot these past few months and our friendship has gotten stronger as a result of the breakup.  She's also best friends with my ex (We're all friends in a circle kind of deal here).  Ex: The ex.  I still consider her a friend but she's done some stuff lately that's taken our friendship back a ways (She said something that upset me greatly and she proved I can't tell her anything).  Still, we try to be friends but its definitely difficult.  Gollum: My bestest friend.  We've known each other since 5th grade or so and he and I have always hung out.  My relationship with Ex weakend this relationship (I spent more time with her than him) but we're working it out.  It's taken about six or seven years but now we're talking more about feelings instead of Magic cards or TV :D.  Gollum you ask?  Well, he loves the character (so much as to the point that he imitates him...quite well.)  Lz: Sorry, I couldn't think of a nickname for you!  Come to think of it, I can't think of one you might have...anyway, Lz and I dated after the breakup for three weeks and, well, broke up (this story is for another time though).  Wasn't entirely saddening (we only dated for three weeks and we agreed that there wasn't a whole lot to be sad over) so we've been better friends afterwards than I was with Ex.  With her bio ends the people who I can trust (Gollum, Tree, Lz, and Ex, although Ex is on the fringe of trust)  SC: Standing for Swahili Chipmunk (don't ask.  I'm not entirely sure I understand it myself), SC and I have slowly become better friends just over time.  I've slowly come to trust her with my innermost feelings, but some I keep inside just because (even though she reads them on this blog :D)  PB: PB stands for Pretty-Boy, which is the name we've given this Japaneese pop star guy who dresses like a girl.  PB is a girl though and has a mad obsession with the Japaneese guy (claims he looks like a guy.  I've seen the photos and I'm inclined to disagree though :D).  Friends and not much more.  As much as I'd love to, it's difficult for me to trust her for no particular reason.  Additionally, she has enough issues to deal with that I don't feel the need to burden her with mine.  Stalker: Not a friend and not an enemy.  I thought I'd hate him with an undying passion and balmed all my problems on him when I had only blamed him because I didn't see other places the blame could go (myself, Ex, etc...).  We're not that great of acquaintences and I'd never trust him with anything said here.  The best word I can come up with for our relationship is: tolerance.  I'm willing to set aside my ideas and talk with him than I am with, say, the new boyfriend.  That's all.  NB: Standing for new boyfriend (I'd have used BT but decided against it.  Ten points if you can guess why ;) ), he's the only person I hate and everyone knows why.  I'm not gonna go into it myself, you can read the other posts here for that.   That's all the people that will be reffered to as the story of my sad life goes on.  I know I left out a few of you, so don't IM me about it :D.  These are the people for whom I might need to refer to for storytelling about the events of the past few months.  Don't think I don't consider you friends, these guys are the ones for whom there could be confusion and I'm just trying to clarify.  My sad little world has expanded into a universe now!

       I had my last counselor meeting today (for the school year at least).  I told her about the new revised "hate list" and she said that it isn't a personality trait he has that I don't, his personality is more compatible with her than mine is/was (I'll withhold my comments on THAT subject though :D).  I feel like I won't find the right person for me, but that's just because this has happened so recently and certainly hasn't helped me feel that great about myself.  Doesn't make me hate him any less.  The more I watch of him, the more about him I hate.  Example: Today, we had a fire drill.  I watched him "sneak" (by sneak, I mean crouched low to the ground and moving quickly) up to the group of people he (and whom I used to) hangs out with, pops up, obviously says "Where is she?", "sneaks" off, and finds her.  I honestly don't believe he can go longer than five minutes without seeing/touching/talking with her.  I'm amazed he can get through an entire class period...  We'll leave his life, to which I'd love to see burn and razed onto the ground :D, and say that eventually, this site will change.  For now, I just need to rant and rave.  Shouting into the vastness of the internet is nice.  When I get the time to, I'll post bios of my friends (names?  maybe "nicknames").  For now, I've got a presentation to make for English.
