      People always say that you should never look back, that you shouldn't dwell on past mistakes but rather look ahead and focus on future goals.  But what if the problem isn't you letting go of the past but rather the past letting go of you.  I like most people have made some mistakes in my life, some of them big ones, and until recently I would sit and dwell on them for hours.   What could I have done differently?  How would my life be different if I hadn't made the choices I'd made?  etc...etc...  It's only been in the past few months that I have learned to let go of what's been done and really learn from those experiences.  I applied to graduate school in Chicago, when I didn't have the money to go I set my sights on a more practical city, because one of the most valuable lessons I have learned recently is that you have to make sacrificies if you want to achieve higher goals (Previously I'd always thought statements like that were invented solely for high school valedictorians to have something bland and meaningless to say after they remarked on how we were all entering a new chapter in our lives).  So I began making plans to move to Dallas.  I set up interviews, I got an apartment, I was even offered a job.  Everything was moving along swimmingly because I was putting in the energy, I was staying on top everything, I was finally doing it.   In fact this was going to be the big break that thrust me into the jetstream of life.  I would be making my own money, which I could save to send myself on trips or go to graduate school.  Finally it was all coming together...and then... the bomb dropped.  The apartment I applied for and put a deposit down on called and in one request changed everything.  "Heather, this is Annie.  I received your application and everything looks good.  I'm just missing one piece of information.  Do you have a number for this Andra Williams?"  My heart stopped. The room seemed to start spinning and I could feel little beads of perspiration beginning to roll down my face.  "I...I don't think so."  I meakly replied.  Andra Williams was the one name I hoped to never hear again in my life.  She was my previous landlord and things did not end well.  You know that age old landlord/tenant struggle; I wanted to move out early, she wanted to sue me, your basic stuff.  But that was a year ago I had painted her apartment and paid her almost all of the money I owed her.  Was that enough?  Or was this one, albeit huge, mistake going to follow me for the rest of my life?  It wasn't just that I didn't like her it was that the mention of her name reminded me of every mistake I'd ever made in my life.  So I have spent the rest of my day today drowning slowly.

      Here is a copy of an email I recently sent to some white supremist friends of mine, if you too would like to contact them you can reach them at  urlLink unite@natfhe.org.uk   A. Hanckock,  I don't understand how any literate person with access to information on genetics and history can still believe that black people are genetically predispossed to laziness, especially when they attempt to use the continent of Africa as a frame of reference. It's most likely that who attempt such an argument do not have the intellectual capacity to understand science. They seem to have subjective fundamental beliefs formed either throught the influence of a parent or some event in their own lives; a fundamental belief which seems to be so imbedded in their perception of reality that any scientific evidence to the contrary is tossed out as "liberal propaganda". While at the same time any psuedo-science found among the crackpots of the scientific community is desperately grasped onto as "evidence" of their theories. The human race, which by the way is the only type of "race" accepted in science today, started in Africa. Africa is three times the size of the United States. There are more languages and cultures on that continent than any of the other. Anybody that attempts to refer to the entire continent of Africa in an argument about the "genetics" of people with black skin is obviously uneducated or simply doesn't have the intellect to decipher between good and bad science. You mention that you know that the ability to work is genetic. How? You also talk about Africans living in a welfare state. Which country in Africa are you talking about? Although, it makes me sad to know that some of my fellow man are so hate-filled I do take assurance in knowing that small interbreeding populations, such as you all are no doubt a part of, ultimately die out due to weakened immune systems. My advice would be to take a class but I have no doubt that whatever scientific studies you read about you would simply mold to fit your own preconceived notions. Just like you should never read history with the intent of "proving" an idea that you already have, you should never sift through scientific studies until you find something that kind of, sort of, supports your theories. But being the underappreciated geniuses of your time I'm sure that you know all of this.  -Heather Toronjo

      Will: "Heather can you get me that water rocket like Power Rangers like Trey has?" Heather: "Will, what do you want to say to my friends?" Will: (unfazed by question) "You know the Green Power Ranger is a cowboy!" Heather:"Okay cool, but would you like to tell my friends anything?" Will: "Can any of them get me a water rocket like Trey had like the Power Rangers?" (Looking up with hope-filled eyes, but suddenly realizes there are funner things to do then talk to older sister. Runs out of room before getting answer to question)  Macy:(Enters in agitation) "Will you please come jump on the trampoline with me before it rains! It's about to rain! Let's go! (said in octives unreachable by most humans) Heather: "Macy do you want to say anything to my friends?" Macy: "Are we going to go jump on the trampoline or not! Come on it's getting dark!" Heather: "Why don't you make up a little story to tell my friends." Macy:"There once was a magical place where it never rained! The End."(Walks out of the room visibly annoyed. Squeel from brother heard shortly thereafter. Can only guess as to cause. Agitated little girl most likely suspect.  When I go to find the children I find them in seperate rooms watching different cartoon shows. Lesson of the day: neither the mind blowing ability to access information on any subject in the world in less than a minute nor magic and adventure of creating your own story can compete with Jimmy Neutron or Sponge Bob.

      I can't believe I am so computer savvy.  To all of my friends who will read this all I have to say is that I told you a person could exist with only limited knowledge of any technology created after 1985 and still survive.  And even though I still shop in the VHS aisle and I have to stop at a pay phone to make a call I would like you all to know that I am trying to really hard to educate myself.  Before you know it I will be trading in my mix tapes for an ipod and talking on my cell phone in line at the grocery store.
