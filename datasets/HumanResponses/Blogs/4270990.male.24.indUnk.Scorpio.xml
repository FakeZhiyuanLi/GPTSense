      Who would of thought that just having started doing this blog thing that I would keep up with it so well. I'm still hoping to figure out how to manipulate the code of this thing to make some more personal touches to it, to make it more my own. But I guess that will come in due time.  Today was nothing out of the ordinary. Created a letterhead for my friend's Law Fraternity, watched a DVD (the new "Predator" Special Edition), and then went to Andrea's apartment to work out, and do laundry (I have no laundry room at my apartment). For my work out I simply did a ten minute mile on the treadmill, and then did ten minutes on an exercise bike. Boy, do I remember (and miss) the days when I could run a 6 1/2 minute mile (to track standards that's still really slow), and I miss even more the speed I once had (my junior year of high school made it to the state finals of the 100m, 200m, and was the anchor for the silver medal winning 400X100m relay team)...But enough bragging, that was almost 7 years ago, and it'll never happen again, but one can reminisce can't he?  Got my laundry done pretty quickly, and afterwards, Andrea, being the great girl she is treated me to a fantastic dinner at Applebee's, and then we came back to my apartment, and we ordered the parts for Andrea's new computer that I'm going to build for her, and watched the Olympics...I took her home at about 9, and I came back and I've been watching the Olympics ever since...By mistake, thinking that I've missed the 100m Dash, I looked up the results on  urlLink www.nbcolympics.com  , not realizing that the semi-finals were just aired (10:02 p.m.), and I now know who wins the gold silver and bronze...That's what I get for being impatient.  Hopefully sometime this week I'll be able to figure out the darn code to these pages, and make this place a little more personalized, and hopefully I'll start posting "discussion-ish" (I know that's not a word) posts rather than just cataloguing the days events...I hope everybody had a good weekend, and I know we're all dreading tomorrow what with it being Monday and all!

      Being able to sleep in, in my own bed and not an air mattress on the floor of my old bedroom at my mother's house is excellent. I still visit the Cincinnati area quite regularly to see old friends, to spend time with my fiancee' since she lifeguards at a pool there during the summer, so in which case I just sleep on the air mattress usually on the weekends. But this weekend I decided to stay at my apartment for a change, and being able to just roll over and go back to sleep at the time when it's usually wake up and get ready for work time was just awesome.  I finally got out of bed when Andrea called to wake me up at 9:30 to start getting ready for one of my least favorite things ever-grocery shopping. I hate shopping of any kind, but Grocery shopping ranks up there pretty high. ESPECIALLY when it's at Wal-Mart...Boy do I hates me some Wal-Mart...Grocery shopping at Wal-Mart on a Saturday morning is a lot like being a shark-if you stop moving for an extended period of time-YOU DIE...If you're fortunate enough to make it through the battle that is the parking lot (it took us almost ten minutes to find a spot), you then have to make it across the street and into the store...Once you're inside the store you get every breed of grocery shopper there is-AND THEY'RE ALL ANGRY AND WANT YOU TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THEIR WAY...Their prices are great, though I dislike their policy on selling media-all their media is edited to make everything "suitable for families"...Which is fine-but they don't advertise it! A few years back I purchased a CD from them at a price I thought was great until I got it home to listen to it and discovered half the CD was just dead air from taking out the "bad words." Upon trying to return it they told me I could only return it for the same item, which is what I wanted-just UNedited...Which is when they told me that "Wal-Mart's a family store, we don't carry that."  But putting that aside, after we finished collecting all the groceries that we needed, and it was time to check out...And I was excited to see that they too have the self scan lanes...That made me happy, because it's been my experience that the cashiers at Wal-Mart are not the happy old men who talk to cookies their commercials would have me to be believe are there...In fact, they're quite the opposite, and are very mean, or very apathetic most of the time...But upon realizing that the section built for the self scan wasn't made for the amount of groceries Andrea and I had, it quickly became a race to scan everything and get the HELL out of there since a line of impatient people formed quickly behind us...It's probably the only grocery store where I sweat as I'm trying check out, and receive as much stress as I do on a hectic day in the office when we're short-staffed...So once again I say: I hate you Wal-Mart...Though your prices are great...But I think paying the extra cash is worth not getting an ulcer while trying to pay for my food.  And after Andrea and I dropped off our groceries at our respective apartments, we headed to Burger King (my favorite fast-food burger) for lunch, and it took it back to her apartment and had lunch and watched the end of Disney's Tarzan (which is probably the epitome of what 2D animation SHOULD be), and played some cards. Andrea currently has two roommates, one of which I know, and the other I've only met once. And being there today with both of them home just reminded me that I really enjoy not having roommates. The one roommate's parents came to visit, and I haven't met them, so Andrea and I hung back in her room hoping that they would all go somewhere so I wouldn't have to do the introduction thing. Over hearing some of their conversations was a bit irritating, as they were talking bad about certain situations that I happen to be experiencing. Such as marriage at a certain age. I will be 25 this November, and Andrea will be 24 in December, and their conversation was along the lines of "24 is way too young for marriage and it'll never work." I shouldn't be surprised at that, though, because last year in their previous apartment, I overheard other marriage conversations that went along the lines of "If I don't get a huge rock, I'm sending the guy back to the store." That kind of struck a nerve with me too, that people would care more about a tangible THING rather than the thought and love put into something so big.  When I proposed to Andrea I was a laborer who earned less than $200 a week, so was unable to purchase a "huge rock," but was (and still am) deeply in love, and felt that the time was right. So I gathered what I could, purchased a ring that I thought was pretty and what Andrea would like (not "huge") and that I could afford on my modest salary, and put the most effort into the setting and presentation of the proposal. My proposal was done on a vacation we took with 8 of our friends last year to Florida (the 10 of us rented a beach house for a week). The entire week had been raining pretty heavily, and tensions of packing ten people into a small house without being able to leave were rising, and I didn't want to take part in drinking games that were going on. So I took a walk out to the beach (secretly), and while sitting there on the waters edge I noticed the clouds starting to part, and over the ocean was a giant full moon. Immediately I knew that I had to do it then, so I went and pulled Andrea from the game, and rushed her to beach, while having one of my best friends (and also one of my best men) decorate our room with candles and things of that sort while I was proposing on the beach. Now, honestly, wouldn't you rather have energy poured into thought and love, rather than them pouring out their wallet on something that is just a thing on your finger? I guess for certain people love is measured by how much money the other person spends on "stuff" rather than how much thought is put into other aspects of life. Perhaps I'm just naive.  Well, now that I've gone WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY off topic, the rest of my day went like this...After sucking it up I walked out to the living room to pick up my sunglasses and wallet and went home. Called Mr. Matt McDonald (linked as McBlogg over there to the right) to hang out. Drove to his place, withOUT getting lost, and our outing began. We first hit up his bank so he could make a deposit-which he actually trusted ME to work the drive-thru machine...So, I got to learn his 4 digit pin and everything (insert evil laugh here)...Of course I forgot what that pin was within a matter of minutes...After that, we hit up some dinner at Joe Bologna's (spelling?) for some cheese sticks and pizza...Which wasn't bad...The cheese sticks had some weird spice in it that I wasn't used to in cheese sticks..The pizza was good, but the crust tasted a little burnt.  After dinner we went to CD City, a used CD store on UK's campus where I found a couple CD's I used to own (on New Year's Eve this past year my old car was destroyed, and all my personal belongings stolen, which included my CD collection of over 10 years) for some very good prices...Which of course I bought...So I'm now only missing about 40 albums of the 115 that were stolen from me...From there we went to a bar by Matt's house (I think was called Grand? I can't remember now), and we each had a beer, and played 3 games of pool...And I must say, Matt and I both suck a great deal at pool. But it was fun to just shoot pool without worrying about any rules or how we're gonna make a shot, and just hang out and talk. Once we were done with that, it was just about time for Matt to go to work at Common Grounds-the coffee shop right across the street from his apartment...Which when he said right across the street, I didn't realize how literally it was "right across the street." I had never been in a coffee shop before, so it was a new experience for me. Though I love the smell of coffee, and would enjoy smelling it brew all day, I absolutely hate the taste. When we got there, and after much debate on what I would actually be able to try, Matt made up some kind of honey coffee drink (I forget what it actually was) for me to try....I wasn't a really big fan of it at first, but the more I drank, and the more I realized that if you don't stir the drink, all the good non-coffee flavors sink to the bottom and the coffee taste comes back, the more I enjoyed it. And actually I ended up drinking just about the whole thing. I hung out there for about an hour and half and met probably one of the most diverse group of people that I've met since I was in college (remember people-I went to ART school)...And on top of the atmosphere being so diverse, every person that I met was incredibly nice...I'm sure that most of them were regulars and was wondering who the hell this new guy was sitting on the bar stool at the end...Though I did have fun, and was enjoying the place, I still had that "out of my element" feeling, you know, as if I were a new employee....I didn't really know anybody, but had several very pleasant conversations with new people,but still didn't totally feel like I actually belonged there...Which I'm sure would eventually get better if I were to visit more, and get to know people better.  So when the night grew on, and the crowd's got bigger, I figured it was time for me to get going, and let Matt actually get to work to serve the paying clientele (though I did have two drinks while there, and tipped as well!)...So, at around 10:15 decided to go home...To most people going home at 10:15 is kind of loser-ish, but I had a very full day, and was ready to just relax at my apartment, and watch the Olympics (I LOVE track &amp; field-I ran track in high school), and apparently write a novel for a post on my new blog! So I imagine I'll play around the internet for a little while longer, and read a little of a book I've been reading for part of mine and Andrea's pre-cana before going to bed...I'm hoping to start discussing this book on here eventually, but only time will tell...For now, I should probably stop talking, and go do something else...Have a good night everybody!

      I've been mainly trying to figure out the "administrative" works of this thing versus posting anything of any substance..As you can see I now have a pretty extensive link list over to the right there for my hobbies....Marvel Comics which is where I get all my book news (I have about 15 years worth of Wolverine and X-Men titles)....The Hunger which I've been a major fan of since I was 16 is an EXCELLENT industrial rock band from Texas-I strongly suggest you check them out...The Dreaming-MORE EXCELLENT industrial rock...The Dreaming was formed by the frontman of my all time favorite band ever, Stabbing Westward, after Stabbing Westward disbanded a couple years ago...I also suggest you check them out as well.   urlLink www.Comingsoon.net  is an awesome place to go for every kind of movie news you can think of...From Studio interviews to DVD release dates...I just recently discovered this place, but I'm glad I finally did...Because I'm tired of buying a DVD and then 3 months later, a special edition comes out (why do studios do that?! I HATE that!)....Blizzard Entertainment is a gaming company that makes some of my favorite PC games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, and Diablo II...Jeff Styers is an instructor that I had in college, he's a great teacher with some excellent work up there...He was my instructor for such programs as TOONZ, and 3DSMAX...MY work may not show it, but I learned a lot from him...The Art Institute of Pittsburgh is where I earned my degree in Media Arts &amp; Animation...An excellent institution, and I miss it a lot (mostly because I wasted the first couple years of attending, and I do believe if I could do it again-RIGHT this time-I could really create some excellent work).  H.R. Giger is my favorite artist...He's the Swiss surrealist who created the design for the Original Alien creature in Ridley Scott's "Alien." If you're not familiar with his work, and are used to landscaping art, or just portraits, or nice happy stuff, he may not be for you...He's quite dark, and can be sexually explicit...But his imagery is amazing...And last, but certainly not least on my hobby page is HomeStar Runner...Absolutely HYSTERICAL flash cartoons that a couple of guys (Matt, and Kenneth-who are both linked under "people I know") at work and I have become quite addicted to...If you need a bright spot in your rainy week-go there, and you'll be entertained and laughing for hours..  So all that should entertain you until I have time (or the discipline) to post something up here of substance. :-) ...Have a great weekend everybody!!!

      Like my sub-title says at the top of the page, I grew up in the Greater-Cincinnati Area (Northern Kentucky) until I graduated high school. I was a kid who after high school had "to get the hell away from my hometown," and at the time Pittsburgh seemed to be far enough away. After college I moved back home for about a year and a half, and in December, 2003 I moved to Lexington.  I am engaged to my girlfriend of 3 years, and 8 months, Andrea. We are to be married May 21st, 2005 at the Church that I grew up in, Holy Cross in Northern Kentucky. My parents have been divorced since I was seven or 8, but I still keep in touch with both of them, and see both of them regularly. I have one older brother who has been married since 1997. They have one child, with another to arrive anyday now. My neice, Ainsleigh Rose will be 4 years old this Christmas. She is a total riot, and I absolutely love visiting her. She refers to Andrea and I as "Uncle an' Eea"..When she was first learning to talk, she couldn't pronounce anything over two syllables, so that's what we taught her to call us. My nephew (who I think they're going to name Kade) is supposed to be due next month, but the doctor said he could arrive anyday now...And when he begins speaking, I'm sure he too will know Andrea and I as "Uncle an' Eea".  So, why do I refer to myself as a "Social Nomad"??? Well, that's a long, but easy story. About every 2 - 4 years my group of close friends seem to change, and I don't seem to stay in the same group of friends for more than that...I do, however, have a few friends that I've had since I was 16, and one friend that I've known since first grade...Even when I was going to college in Pittsburgh, my "clique" of friends changed every few months or so...I mean, hell, I went through 6 roommates in 4 years...Maybe there's something wrong with me, I dunno....Well, I guess that's more than enough for one posting, and if you happen to drop by and read anything, thanks for stoppin' by!
