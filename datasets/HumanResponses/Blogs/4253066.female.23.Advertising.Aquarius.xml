      "The first reason is fairly obvious. Returning hate for hate multiples hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction."   "Another reason why we must love our enemies is that hate scars the soul and distorts the personality. Mindful that hate is an evil and dangerous force, we too often think of what it does to the person hated. This is understandable, for hate brings irreparable damage to its victims."  "But there is another side which we must never overlook. Hate is just as injurious to the person who hates. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true"  "A third reason why we should love our enemies is that love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend. We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate with hate; we get rid of an enemy be getting rid of enmity. By its very nature, hate destroys and tears down; by its very nature, love creates and builds up. Love transforms with redemptive power"

      My time's come to an end for now and I must be on my way Please don't forget I love you and think of you everyday  There's so much I want to give you If I could I would do anything but for now I hope you will accept these two plain and simple rings  At first glance, they're nothing special but in a minute you'll understand Just close your eyes and look with your soul at my love...now in your hand  I said a prayer for you my love With both rings close to my heart and now I pass this on to you To keep you, while we're apart  The first ring's for you protection May God keep you safe and warm and when I come back home, my love May he return you to me unharmed  For the second ring, I said a simple prayer I hope he heard me up above For the second ring, I got on my knees and prayed, "May God bless our love"  I know these rings are nothing fancy nothing expensive, nothing rare but my love resides within them So please treat them with care  My love for you is like these rings At first glance, so simple, but as time goes Beyond the surface there's so much more and my love is only for you to know  God has promised to look after you he heard the sincerity in my voice So when tempted or when things go wrong You are presented with this choice  You can try to fight through on your own or take the rings I have given you just close your eyes and hold them to your heart and my love will see you through.

       I dream of us and we fly away when I can't be with you today. Reality doesn't complete my need to be by your side. We touch and our bodies glow from love and the sun below us, as our passion thrusts us towards heaven.  I dream of us and we sail on  the waters of forever, when tomorrow's reality keep us sailing apart again. The time we share on our vessel is precious, I want every delicious wave of our emotion to last always.  I dream of us and we heat the coldness of night, when tonight's reality is much more cold without you. I wish I could exchange one  for the other, but my then dreams would be incomplete, lonely and cold...  I dream of us in my dreams and  our reality.

      Though I love you so much, I want you to know, though you mean everything to me, I'm learning to let go.  My feelings for you will never change, they just won't always seem as strong. But things stopped working out long ago, that's when everything went wrong.  How could I let this happen, knowing what we shared couldn't last? Please don't let me become part of your unremembered past.  I remember how happy we were, when we were boyfriend and girlfriend, but it was so long ago when those days came to an end. I can't even remember how it felt, being so far apart.  This separates us even more, the distance tormenting my broken heart. I've decided that I'll try, try to find another.  But the feelings I had for you, I'll never feel for any other. There will always be a place in my heart, holding on to memories of this- the sweetest days I'll know, the ones I'll always miss.  These broken-hearted feelings, are something I wished never to know, but I'm feeling them now, cause I love you and I'm letting you go.
