      Regeneration Music is still going through some construction, but it is available to listen to. Just download Mercora then search for Regeneration_Music. It should be broadcasting. If it isn't that just means I am hard at work on it.

      haha today was boring. Tomorrow I will have (hopefully) alot more pics on the moblog, since it will be tear down night at the convention center. I am going to shoot to get there around lunch or after. I just started listening to  urlLink Dashboard Confessional , thanks to sam u.  Also on my agenda is to see the movie  urlLink Collateral  starring Tom Cruise and Jaimie Foxx. I do not know why but this movie seems very interesting to me. Oh yes and lets see here, here is your funny video of the day. Just open it with windows media. The way the hosts reacted was the best part.  -Down? no. Out?  yea.  UPDATE:  I found the video on a site that must have linked it from that site.  I will try and find another site that hosts that video because its SO funny!

      Well I just made a small step in an advance toward getting involved in the technical arts department at our church. I stated that I was very interested and active in the video editing arena. I requested to know what programs they use in their creations at our church, ie Gateway TV. I am kind of edgy about the whole thing, but in the end I really should get involved while Im younger. Experience is a very good thing to have, and thats what I am seeking. The only problem is that I am a little nervous that I would not display my "skillz" as well as I would want. Thats probably just me though, so Im not going to worry about it.  I think it is a good idea to try and get a volunteer position.  I guess some people would want to  urlLink apply to get paid  for doing this, but I just dont see the logic in that.

      The title has nothing to do with what I am writing about. Today I worked again from 9am-5pm. I enjoyed work today, and we all had alot of fun. On another subject, I would like to recommend a cd that I am really enjoying right now. It is called  urlLink Masterpiece by David Moore . David Moore is Gateway Youth's worship leader and he plays acoustic guitar/vocals at  urlLink Gateway Church . This cd is great. I have listened to it, at least, 10 times through. Believe me when I say there is not one bad/unenjoyable (aka Filler) song on the entire cd. If you would like a copy just click on the Masterpiece by David Moore link. I would also like to recommend a show that is only accesible through the internet. Unofficially entitled "The Tim Show," is revealing itself to be one of the best pre-shows on the internet. Hosted by the very qualified talent of  urlLink Tim Fox  (only rivaled by  urlLink Barbara Walters ). This is show is a must-see for all who like quality enternainment with a christian atmosphere. You can see the "Tim Show" everyday this week (8/2-8/6) at 8:45am or 6:45pm on  urlLink this website .  -running boldy

      Doom 3 finally came out.  So I went over to my friend John's house to watch him play it.  I must say that the graphics are the best I have ever seen.  I dont know much about the story though.  It seemed that everything looked the same in the levels we got to play.  The story is basically that you are stationed in Mars when all hell brakes loose, literally.  The stationed was then plagued with all sorts of monsters and zombies.  So you go through the game, obviously, killing every last one of these monsters/zombies.  One thing is for sure though, even if Half-Life 2 doesn't match up with Doom 3 in the graphics department, it will definately beat it in the overall gameplay and story.  -vs

      well I had a good day today.  Worked from 9am-8pm.  Long day, but it was ok.  Heres your  urlLink funny video of the day  Oh and I just found a very cool band named  urlLink Further Seems Forever . They are a band under the label Tooth &amp; Nail (Toby Mac's company) meaning that they are most likely a christian band. They play them on christianrock.net so its safe to say they are christian, which rocks.  -The statement below is true. -The statement above is false.

      AAAAAAARRRGHHHHHHHHHHH.  I just returned from a full day (9-5) of work at BCS.  I am getting paid minimum wage ($5) per hour, but with tax, so I wont be receiving as much as I think I will.  I am very tired.

       urlLink    This is a SS by a player in CAL.  You have to send a SS to your division admin after each match.  As you can see, this person was using hacks.  The player on the right side has a box on him, which will show through walls.  HAHHAHAHAH THE FOOL!

      Well I had a LAN party last thursday.  It was very cool.  There are some pics on my  urlLink moblog . I also just helped set up for the Southwest Believers Convention today. We had to wake up at 5 am and we finished around 5:30pm. It was a very long day, but to finish off the day I once again defeated evil and was a hero in  urlLink Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne .   This is the 2nd time I have completed the game on the most difficult mode, Dead On Arrival. So boo yea, I rule. I am also playing  urlLink FarCry . This is by far one of the most difficult games I have ever encountered. The AI is very, well, intelligent, and this makes it much harder to sneak around. I am still waiting for the release of  urlLink Half-Life 2 .  Will this game ever come out?!?  -A guy that is cooler than you.
