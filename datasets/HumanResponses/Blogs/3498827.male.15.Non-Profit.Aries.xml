      Guess what? Never, On the first time you have rollerbladed, go down a really steep driveway. Especially If theres a car at the end of it. It hurts, trust me. Just for the record- I will be keeping this blog up until i get my own website.

      When a really hot girl thinks you're cute, dont tell your mother that she is cute. Your mother will make a big deal out of it and tell absolutely EVERYONE about it. The girl will most likely not lke you any more. I learned that the hard way. Also- never dress a 17 year old guy in makeup with huge persian eyes and a green dress. Its just plain wrong. Especially when He stands up on stage and goes "I'm the RopeHolder! HUH-DUH-DUH! Take my word for it. Its Disturbing. I will put a picture up if I can find one (and figure out how to post it) Ok, I gotta go. I'll post again later. Now- to catch gummi fish with a gummi Worm!

      I have recently decided that one must not play with a lighter in ones pocket. My Jacket now has a bit of a burn in it. Also- dont try to light a sugarcube when you are holding it. It hurts. A Lot.

      I can create a bomb that will let me take over the world. The process is quite simple, and you can use objects you find around he house. Ingredients: 10 pickles 10 "C" batteries 20 6 inch pieces of copper wire 1 globe of the earth 10 gallons of bleach 1 rather large microwave a spool of string  1. Tie the string onto the pickles and dip in bleach, let sit for 1 hour 2. Take bleached pickles and Insert wires onto both sides of all them. 3 attach other end of the wires to batteries creating 10 electronated pickles 4.open globe and place jumble of electronated pickles into it. 5. fill the rest of the globe with the remaining bleach 6. close globe and place into the microwave. 7. microwave on high for 56 minutes, no more, no less  This will create an explosion that will destroy all of canada and most of japan. Alaska will be left floating on the ocean and will become its own continent (like australia) The fumes left over from the blast will brainwash the rest of the world, causing them to do what i want. However, the only way to control the masses is to take a Nintendo 64 controller, attach it to another bleached pickle bomb, and use it like you would any Nintendo game. The A button is jump and the B is attack. you can assign different actions to the C buttons.  That is my ultimate plan.

      Yeah- i was grounded from the computer. I learned never to punch a closet door, as they are rather thin. Needless to say, as soon as you walk into my house, there is a hole in the closest door to you. I had to pick splinters out of my bloody hand. It hurt. Also- never do the curtains on a theatre presentation if you dont know how. People will get mad at you. Very mad. I AM THE PROPMASTER 3000!!! along with my sidekick PROPBITCH 1500!!!! who is andrew.   So until next time Prop-fans! Tune in later to the exciting continuation of PROPMASTER!!!!, same prop time, same prop channel!

      I learned that if one makes a big change in their appearance, just by wearing a different style of clothes, and a different kind of AXE, one will get attention from really good looking girls. Namely- Alex and Nicole. I also learned that when one doesnt pay attention in class, one will not understand what is going on.  NOW- for some more poems! YAYY!! POEMS!! and you probably dont even care!! yay!!!   Anger  Utter seething anger not just at you but at myself too i hate how i act i hate what i do I hate that you said nothing About what was going on you could have told me why you could have me why no you said nothing you did nothing whatever i did however the hell i fucked up i apologize for. all these thoughts keep crossing through my head but mostly  anger yet through the anger some remnants of the false feeling called love   Again i lie in bed a single tear rolls down my cheek i always want to be there make you cheer up  make you happy i wish i could still be there even as a friend but yet you dont trust me for one reason or another  i would never lie to you no matter how little the thing you have no idea how i feel  if i told you it would seem  like im pathetic and confused all i ever did is care and thats all i'll ever do I want to be there you dont want me to  i can help you when you are weak i can straighten your mind when youre confused but mostly i want to be there even as a friend just to see you smile  i feel the pain rising, trying to envelop me, i try to escape this prison,  built for you and me this is not my place this is not my place stay the hell away form me we call this place a free land but noones really free this place is just a prison built for you and me so while you try to be free theres some of us who never seem to escape this prison built for you and me   if you feel any need to speak with me on AIM my SN is "leashoohatoo"  If you need to email me- my address is "darkwolverine56@yahoo.com"

      Around, all around, the mourners gather.  My dread grows as the dagger of your words falls against my heart.  It crushes me, and darkly my lifes blood drips to the thirsty earth.  In horror I call your name while my doom follows.  Now alone, my love falls upon uncaring eyes.   This is because of you
