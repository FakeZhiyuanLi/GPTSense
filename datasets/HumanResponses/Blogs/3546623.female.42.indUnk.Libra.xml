Here is the key Breathe in and deep Refresh the life within An instant, forever Be the morning dew. Birth of the morning As the foliage is feed Colors and songs Waltz through my head I hear the whispers Feel the calling Forever I live Kissed by the morning dew. dlt © june 26 2004

						   Essence of a Soul Inglorious erstwhile, Struggles forth, In darkness is met.  Essence of a Soul, Mute and Deaf, Screaming and shouting, Pain forever left.  Essence of a Soul  Once barren, forlorn, Gasps, pleads! Sunrise innate!  Flaming hope. Cherished faith. Willingness fresh. Love stark!  Two dance as one; Heart and mind, Nascence pure and light Essence of a Soul… Anew!  Lady Lorraine du Lac © June 17 2004

						   Yellling, Screaming Dancing, Sweating Women divided, United! Fighting it seems, The union of two, lost halves, now found. Sacred Marriage  The calm and the strong. Dark and the Light. Embracing with love, Divine is the time, The torch held as one!   Lady Lorraine June 17 2004

						   Walking across dew kissed grass Serene heart gently sighs  Moments seconds minutes trapped in glass Lyrical soul aspiration flies.   A blizzard of separation Discovery of distance Time to uncover Our truth to reveal.  Breathing deep as the stars shine and sing Moonbeams dance as we grow more distant Our paths growing away  Limbs reaching stretching away from the core  Experience screams LISTEN Enraptured, enchanted the breathe of the muse A gift so rare and difficult to render Fate as you leave, her truth  your heart transfused!  I smile to myself as slowly you become Listening to the muse You glow and you shun The past and the future for us there is none  DLT © June 2004

						   He skitters and he scatters, He zips and he zaps, It is you he flatters, He knows we are a couple of saps!   The music plays happily, Dancing to the beat he performs never a slip! High in the sky, he dives so craftily Floating and soaring he ends with a flip!  We laugh and we giggle!  To the front of the bee, I saw your finger wiggle! "Sit" you shouted with glee!  Seducing you, the bee has his fun Tears run freely as we jest, For your love he has won! A perfect moment held dear in my breast!   For Tim My teacher My student  Of living in the moment!

						   December 28 2003  Sunday  Quabbin      I sat upon the shores of the Quabbin today, my inside quivering as I faced a truth of my future. The death of a dream, a hope, another life. I wander now, start a pot of coffee, take the dog out, put on music, smoke a cigarette and another cigarette. Anything but sit here and write. I know once I put this on paper it will be gone, maybe not totally but it will be real and I will have to move on. I close my eyes listening to the harmonic melody playing, drums, crickets, wind instruments, a deep pulse moving through me. I pray, help me God to write and move on.  So again I take you to the shore of the Quabbin with me. A man made reservoir that for me holds the secret of man and God’s unity. You can not see the man made elements… although you know that they lie there towns deserted beneath the waters surface, all you can see is the creative beauty of God’s wonder, trees, water, sky, rocks…life. I come here often. I find balance at the waters edge. I can hear the children’s lost laughter from the sunken towns echoing amongst God’s trees. The lost laughter of children, this is why I am here.   As I make my way to the water’s edge I pass fellow travelers, saying Good Day! How are you? Wishing them well, moving on. It is a pleasure to share a moment with another human being, extending a genuine smile and nod that you acknowledge their existence . Many others come to this water’s edge to ponder their past, present and future. The energy is strong, healing it draws me forward but still I question am I ready?  As I make my way to God’s chosen spot for me, I take pictures of the water, rocks and dead lifeless trees. I am always drawn to these gray ghosts standing silently, drooping by the waters edge. I see myself as one of them. Dried up, dead, a vessel where no life will spring from, no buds leaves, fruit or children.   I walk towards the waters edge, I know that the man I love is right. I must face and deal with this. If I do not there is no hope for us. I do not know if I am ready. There is a lulling comfort in the pain of holding on. I brood over this truth, but my love for him is stronger than the comfort and I know I must travel on. My steps move me forward to the balance of the water’s edge, silently praying for the strength and courage to face the dark fear that bars me from my future.  I sit now on a cold flat stone balanced on the edge of land and water. I face the winter sun, a small river of ice runs toward the water beneath my right foot. My back is against the water, I know when I turn to face the serene calmness that holds the healing power of the water, I will have to face the laughter of the children. My cigarette is done, put out now in my back pack, do not want to leave any evidence of my being here. What am I waiting for?  I hear an airplane in the background its motors beckon to me to turn face the water and look, see and know. I pray:  I ask you God for strength and courage                                                I ask you God to stand by me                                               In order to move closer to you                                               I ask you God                                                To help me                                                 Help me  I turn and face the water….  I see my shadow on the water’s surface dark against the warm brown of the sandy beach. Gentle ripples move across the water towards my shadow, beyond me God’s love in those ripples radiating around, across and through me. It is time.  I will never have any children. I always thought I would make time. Reality is I did not I made choices and now my time is past. It is too late. There it is said. The sad truth is that I still want them, but now I know that this is not to be. This is so hard to deal with, especially when you are a woman who always gets what she wants. I must face this truth. There is no other way, if I do not I will be a prisoner to the past and forever be the gray ghost of a lifeless, drooping tree at the water’s edge.  So now I sit here, the cold from the stone running up my spine and I cry for the mother I will never be. I cry for the children laughter I will never hear. It is so hard to let go of this, I do not know if I can do this by myself. Do I have to?  For the first time in my life I heard from a man’s lips the words "It is not your problem Denise, It is ours." This is more than I could dream of. Can I trust you with this precious secret that lies within me. Will you help me?  I look down the gentle waves of the water reach the edge of the thin ice that bridges the water to the land. The waters gentle movement creates a pulse living within the thin ice. A beating heart strong steady giving life to hope.  The tears stop, I stand and balance upon the rock. Thanking God and Mother Earth for the healing wisdom they have bestowed on me. The winter sun’s rays grow stronger as if they say to me, "You are welcome!" I gather my things and move towards the woods, a short cut to the road and home.     The Woods  Death of Desire….  Wouldn’t it be so easy if all I did then was gather my things, walk to the woods, get in my car drive home and all is well in the world. Sadly that is not the way towards enlightenment or reality of the world. I hate to tell you but suffering, pain, anguish are the bedfellows of the death of a dream ,our desires.   I made my way through the woods, not a wise choice. Safety and comfort lies at the water’s edge. I am not one for safety and comfort, my life has its foundation on the rocks of pain. Moving through the pain a place I know so well is the only way towards my future. Only then may I may find the truth of safety and comfort.   The death of a dream can not be communicated through words, paintings, sculpture, music, aromas, taste… nothing can describe… it is all hope and all death rolled into one.   I walked through the woods, the gray finger of lifeless trees grabbing at me…other barren women pulling me towards them telling me to stay. I will not. Colors of yellow, blues, greens, orange and blood red swirling around me creating a tangle or rusted barbed wire that ripped at my skin peeling off layers of my true self. Ever breath deeper as the barbed wire wound itself around my insides my heart, blood pouring out from me…   The music started… loud drums, chaotic rhythms, pounding my skin split with screams that only I can hear. I can not breath I shake but pull myself forward .. for I know that this too shall pass. Everything hurts… the colors are swirling black now… the music and screams have no beat just a high pitch whine… my heart beats so fast my breathing is rapid. I am at the roads edge. It is done.   I scream out loud just to hear that I am still alive. I do not care if anyone hears me. Slowly I hear the gentle rush of a small stream nearby, the winter sun comes out and I begin to breathe. A single tear caresses my cheek. I know this will not be the last one I will shed for this dead desire. There are no words, no art, no poetry or music that can make one understand the power that lies between the hope and death of a dream. It is a spiritual connection with the light and dark that lies within all of us. In order to learn we must draw our swords and battle our way through our own dark woods, releasing ourselves from the pain of precious dreams of our past in order to gain perspective our what grand dreams God has for our future. I know what I must do…

						     Alone now wandering room to room, Echoes of liquid laugher floating down the hall Embracing me with honey warm joy.  What I ask made this so special? Moments of shared quietude Simple safety of contentment reigned.  Drenched in music  Time flew As our souls stood still.  Silent smiles Speaking grander than any words Our inner selves slowly emerge.  Childhood memories  Danced through our night Sweet sharing revealing racing hearts young .  Alone I sit  This serenity so new A blessing I know all because of you.  Denise Tetro © May 2004

						   You hide in the bushes and lurk from the trees, silent you think as you creep through the weeds. Stalking the prey now wise to your needs;  I sense your presence,  forever I see.  You listen and contrive, from the outside you watch silently. The saunter of the walker as her faith  thrives, her steps strong and steady as she glides defiantly.   Oh dear muse!  You stand in the shadows of fallen oaks, like a torrent rain your empty words, drenching your soul, denial forever to soak!  Courage brings you to my front, to know the secret of the walk. But lies, doubt and broken trust, are walls that cause you to balk.   I see you now, without your daystar glitter, only a man, lost and bitter.  A raggedy man,  who runs and retreats. Just a man, who has wornout the soles of his feet.  Lost in the mind, dead of the heart, you exhaust me! I no longer play my part!   Denial is a snake charmer...  that will whisper sweet lies in your ears,  blind your eyes,  harden your heart,  deaden your soul...   So dear muse, I live to feel the blood in my heart, the singing of my soul, I close my ears for I now have control.  I pray someday, for the return of your daystar glitter.  Once who knew he way, a man so brave. Desire bright that burns, living within the oak,      and a life lead no longer bitter.  March 30 2004 ©  dlt

						   The  Priestess of the Fallen Oaks    I fell into the moon And lived in the land of the midnight sun the gate swings open and I am greeted by a muse  gently he whispered love laced riddles in my ear speaking to my heart, my soul opened each willing to hear  my mind runs to the darkness... Taking the muses hand  we walked through the garden in silent seperation the light shines on Alone with the muse  Sadly our hands slip out from the tender embrace surrounded by a lush green of a dream the riddles danced through me the answers sleep upon the muses lips I yearn to know the answers but still I am not told there will be no kiss  so I may breathe in the answers.. anger flares...  why? I look at the muse  no words..silent sadness the riddles flying like hummingbirds in the air The muse slowly fades in front of me bursting into star dust  surrounding me like a tornado of Divine light Soaking through my skin the garment of my soul I am a day star in the land of the midnight sun...  Without my muse I am lost. my starlight fades in and out traveling the overgrown paths finally lost in the wilderness I forge my own ...   searching  for the answers My shining garment is soiled and torn  My soul exposed and vulnerable I am trailed by the hummingbird riddles the whirl of their wings throbs noisly in my mind lost in the darkness still memories of my muse glisten upon my skin a  torture of the lessons learned Hope struggles with each dying breathe Desire and longing  I firmly clasp at my breast my heart beats for the muse to look within the all knowing eyes and to see my granduer as he once did   I awaken in a meadow bees busy at work floating from stem to stem bringing new life into the center of the moon I gaze upon a mighty oak tall and strong My hands long to roam across the rough bark and hear the whispers of the years A lonely oak who longs for companionship I see the changing of many seasons a hawk flies above and watches  my progress A voice I hear with wise words that draw me beware for what you seek It will both amaze and bring you great sorrow The seed of the old oak  dropped from the sky the struggle for the roots to receive the life's water Clutching at the earth its mother each morsel of soil clings to the roots  painfully they spread and gain strength Feeding from the full breasts of the Goddess I feel the years of the oak passing through time standing tall young and proud Alone he is not living among a forest of friends slowly the disease of man took away their lives Only shadows of fallen oaks grace the meadow Towering alone now waiting to be called forth  ripping it' s roots from the mother earth The goddess lives within the pulp She cries for the shadows of lost souls  The the dance of the leaves of her fallen soldiers  that once stood proudly in the meadow I call... softly, gently a lullaby yearning to see the miracle To feel the earth beneath my feet  rumbling  ripping itself from the mother The oak struggles for freedom as the hummingbirds take refuge within the branches I hear the earth give way   thunder and screams... groaning ...  straining for release I stand aside... my tears  now the life source for the exposed roots  I reach forward  crystal teardrops drip from the tips of my outstreched fingers.. like rain in the desert falling to the roots mingling with the milk of the Goddess each splashing into a thousand stars that sail towards the sky   swimming with the hawk Alone I stand waiting for when the oak will be ready to live in my star shine and I in the center of the rings One with the Goddess her Priestess of the Fallen Oaks...   Love Light and Peace  Lady Lorraine du  Lac

						   Outsiders      I remember coming home one day when I was 14 years old crying…my mother opened the door with a worried look upon her face. This was an unusual site for her… you see I never cried, at least not in the open where others could see me. My mother was used to a little warrior marching into the house, smile on, books in hand and always a new tale to tell from the day. This young girl who walked in with red eyes brimming with endless tears was a new fragile person to her. She looked at me asking what could be wrong. There are times in life when even the strong break.   Earlier that day at gymnastics I had introduced my new floor exercise routine. I worked hard and long for many hours down in the small judo room putting this 1 minute and 30 second debut together. I had played the music Exodus over and over at times breaking it down to 2 or 3 seconds in order to perfect the right movement with the notes from the piano music. At night when I laid in bed I replayed the music in my head and each movement until I visualized my body in perfect unison with the music. I loved this routine. I was proud of it knowing that it reflected me... what lived with in my spirit. It was mine.. not a routine made up by a coach for me to mimic but me dancing, leaping, flipping and spinning one with the music. I choreographed it to reflect how I felt and wanted to communicate to the judges. It was me.  That day Eileen my coach asked if she could see the new routine. I usually did not perform my new optional floor ex until the meet. Always one for the dramatic entrance! But that day her smile was large and I knew she really wanted to see my work. Nodding okay, I handed her the album (yes album! Vinyl!) walked out to the middle of the carpeted mat centering myself and struck a pose. The music started slowly a building force and as usual I got lost … a point where there is only my spirit, the music and my body. I worked my way through leaping with precision each arm movement joined with a beat. As the tempo built I performed back handsprings ending with a perfect full twisting somersault. (I was the only one who could do this trick so ego was involved!) Slowing again as I worked my way onto the ground now one with the mat as I gracefully lowered myself onto the carpet for the final dramatic pose. Done!   I remember coming back to the gym from the music center that lived within me. Eileen standing there no words… but slowly the laughter began…all my teammates… the girls who I shared hours of my life with in this gym laughing at me. I remember Dayna who was my closest friend on the team saying, " You think you will win with that????"  They began to mimic some of my moves with clumsy gestures and laughed harder. I recall hearing Eileen telling them to stop as I ran out of the gym. Tears rolling down my face I gathered my things and ran home. I was never one to run before so why now?  There I was then standing in the door my mother asking me what could be wrong? How can a 14 year old girl explain to her mother the exhaustion caused by living outside the world of the norm? I could not explain it to myself so how could I voice this torture to my mother who loved me so much? It was not just my gymnastics that classified me as an outsider, rather it was everything about me. The way I danced, thought, dressed and what I believed in. It was the boys I fell in love with, the fact that I loved school and rather be there then anywhere else! It was how I sat in the back yard for hours staring at the sky filled with clouds, the birds and trees. The fact that I would rather read a book than talk on the phone. It was the friends I picked and teachers I loved. It was everything about me and for the first time I realized that I was an outsider different than others and I did not fit in! This was the reason for running and the tears. I sat on the couch and told my mother my tale of humiliating laughter from the girls I believed to be friends. To this day I remember my mother smiling, shaking her head and grabbing my hand. She took me into my bedroom where the walls were lined with trophies, ribbons, plaques and medals. She looked at me with pride and said "Denise, Do they have all of these?" I miserably shook my head No, She replied "This is what being different.. unique (nice way of putting it) will always get you..." as she ran her hand across the hundreds of awards I had received through the years. She finished "So why would you want to be like them?" My mother sat me on my bed facing those ribbons and medals telling me about artists whom had been laughed at the same way and now where considered to be masters. She told me of great scientists and leaders who had the same ridicule laced through out their lives and now are looked upon with awe. My mother told me that those who are willing to stand tall and be different change this world and she believed that this power lived within me. She wiped the tears away and told me to be strong. She gave me that day a gift I will carry to my grave. I performed that routine with more passion then I thought possible. I won over and over again. Slowly my fellow teammates laughter faded from my head.  This 30 minutes spent with my mother at the age of 14 has returned to me numerous times in my life…. always giving me strength to be different...return to school at the age of 33 and graduate with honors. To search in areas of life that others find "crazy" or repulsive. When I was told at the age of 21 I could not possibly dive from 113 feet for a world record… I climbed that ladder and proved them wrong. Have I always made the right choices? Who knows…I dance to a different beat and that is just fine with me today. Call me crazy, insane, whacked or just plain nuts! I will always hold my head up high... remember the words my mother told me and open the next door in my life with hope, joy and insane anticipation of the next adventure!   Lady  Lorraine

						   With in and With out  Dark and  gloomy, Once  no light; Lost and lonely Each day a fight.  Moment by moment, Day by day, Time stood still, A soul to pay.  Slowly emerging, Pushing and straining, The light up ahead, The cure for the ailing.  Manifested of pain, Balance unknow, Light from within, All to atone.  Power achieved, Freedom lives, Down on the knees, Surrender gives!  Within and without, There is no difference, Divine love sprouts, Living in his presence.  Two become one, Spirit and heart, True to the shaman, All have a part.  The river runs deep, No longer a struggle, Minds need not sleep, The spirit immortal.  Be oh so silent, Live in the present, A past violent, Tomorrow repent.  Within is the light, Love is the key, Yours to ignite, Answer the  plea.  Time is the essence, Forgive and forget, Living  luminescence, Paid is the debt.  Pain so bold, Forever to hold, Surrender my dear, Banish the fear!  Blessed am I, Who lives in the sky, Fruits of  ones labor, Grace! Divine Favor!  Lady Lorraine May 28 2004

						   The Spiral   I sit here in my house in the country, Barney my dog curled up tightly in his little bed sleeping away so peacefully. The sun has just risen and streaks of pink reach across the new days sky slowly searching for the hope that lives just beyond it’s touch. It is a new day, another chance for peace. Sitting in my study sipping the first cup of hot coffee of the day, I sit and wait for the calm. My cat, Obi leaps against the glass sliding doors struggling to play with a little bird outside the window. The bird does not move… it just sits there and stares at the crazy little black priestess. She sits there perplexed at why that bird is so unattainable. It looks at her and flies away I can hear it snickering with every wing flap. It leaves behind a confused female wondering why she can never break through that glass wall.   The calm is not easily achieved this morning. I look around my little home. The floors need to be vacuumed, books need to be placed on shelves, clothes washed and dishes done. Hundreds of CD cases lay empty… with a stack of discarded music along the wall… music I can not listen to. My keyboard stares at me…no words fly from my fingertips…WHY CAN’T I DANCE? What happened to my precious music vibrating through my very essence? Music my blood, running through my soul bursting into a white light so immense I can only believe it is God. Where is it? My energy dissipated, I am lost in the darkness. A tear runs down my face as I mourn the loss of my music and the dance. A stack of art books lay discarded… nothing speaks to me. All my loves, my distractions, my drugs stripped from me. Now my house cluttered and littered with my disenchantment of this life is a work of art that reflects my mind. Even the coffee is flat. Normally I take a deep whiff of the warm embracing aroma… just before I sip with delight. Gulping today, I smell nothing. Cigarette after cigarette smoked and put out, my ashtrays overflow. Food tastes bland I numbly place each bite in my mouth chewing without taste.. a function only, sadly I continue to chew even when I am not hungry. Finally, I reach down to that sleeping bundle of love Barney, stroke his tiny head….my heart breaks! I can not feel the love.   My senses are dying…for a sensual woman so soak in the warm summer breezes, rich silk of chocolate laced across my tongue or the tears released from viewing a shooting star… this is worst than death! My heart sunk to the bottom of the sea lost with the city of Atlantis as the thought of living like this forever drenched my being. No more lost moments in union with a Mozart symphony, heart racing with the reading of Shakespeare’s sonnet 18, flying to God as I dance through hours of music or the sharing of a soul holding my love’s hand. This is too much to take. He is gone and I am alone with the pain. It is all about my love for him and nothing about my love for him.   When and how did this happen? More important why? How did I get here this desolate tormenting moment in my life? I close my eyes, breathing slowly knowing where I have to go….not to last night or even 2 weeks ago when the pain started, no it began years ago! That is the road I must travel now or forever live a false life.   I had believed that the spiral down was finished, it had started June 9,1999. Newly graduated from college with honors I was living in the middle of the universe. Happy, proud and ready to start again at 38 years of age, the world had laid a red carpet before me…many in fact which way should I go? I laughed regularly with the excited joy of new adventures. I opened an email thinking it must be joke or a riddle from my Uncle Jack… the replacement father I loved dearly. What I found there was one of those moments when time stands still. My grandmother on my father’s side had died. I had not seen her in years but still the ache of loss echoed through my heart. I was determined at that moment to go to the wake! SO WHAT if my father would be there. He can’t hurt me now… I can do anything, I thought to myself. Did I not just accomplish more than anyone dreamed I would in this lifetime? Strong with emotion I read on……there was no mention of any of us. No Denise, Frank or Patti when they listed grandchildren. Time stood still and the darkness came dragging me out of the center of my universe to a catacomb of my mind. We did not exist. I was nothing… as if I had never been born. It was at this moment that the black spiral down to my core began…. I thought.  The next four years I threw myself into the material world producing money and power. Funny I did not become joyful, in fact I sunk deeper the harder and more powerful I became. Until after a disastrous love affair with a man whom only thought I loved and just realized that the pain came from the fact that I could not save him from the death living in his eyes. This realization had me driving towards a bridge at 90 miles an hour praying for the courage to close my eyes and just aim. It was then I heard my voice again. It had been silent for so very long I almost did not recognize it! The voice screamed STOP THIS NOW! And I woke up from the dark catacomb swerved away and pulled over to the side of the turnpike and cried for the first time in years. I choose to live at that moment, to crawl out and learn to love. My walk towards the light began right then and there at 41 years of age, sitting in a dark car on the side of a lonely highway.  So I ask myself how could I be here now? No more tears to cry….dehydrated from the racking sobs of the last week. I gave this man all of me! The first time I was honest, open and loved unconditionally. Why did he abandon me? A sob crawled to the base of my throat, I pushed it down and screamed Not Now! I am so close. In my deep state I walked past this man who I blamed for this pain, pushed aside the anger and need to have him love me…. for as I said it is all about my love for him and nothing about my love for him. I so want to reach out and touch him feel his hand in mine one last time but I know it is not him that holds the key… I gave it away along time ago…that is where I have to go.   My mind holds many locked doors from my childhood. Slowly through the years I have found the courage to open each buried memory and face the past. Always the most painful times of my life both then and now. Each time it is like the lifting of a veil that covers a dead child. As I lift the veil I watch the child breathe again….resurrected in order to take my hand down the meadow of pain I will walk.   I am 9 years old. It is my brother Frank’s birthday and we are all at my Grandmother Rena’s house. My father’s mother did not tell us he would be here… but there he is, my mother is not allowed with us and he wants us to sit in the room with him. I sit on the couch alone and fearful….my brother and sister are on his lap gleeful to see him. He calls to me but I do not want to go…and I want to go with all my heart. Tears run down his face as he pleads for me to come to him. My mother is divorcing him and now is professing his love for us. I stay strong, fueled by fear and biting memories of the past tortures he has placed on me. At the same time I want to believe him, I am dying to believe the words I have never heard from him before….."I love you Denise." The desperation for my father’s love wins…..I go to him.  His tears run freely, I believe he loves me… my sister and brother hug me as we all sit on his lap. I let the walls down, those strong thick walls built through years of beatings and torture! Amazingly, they fly down within seconds with his words and tears. It is then he hugs me close, it is more than I ever thought I would know from him my father, the man with the belt and a rage so bright it burned in the sky. He loves me! I relax and fall into the hug….he whispers oh so softly then ….so only I can hear…. I don’t love you…. never will…. No one can and ever will….I fly back through time, straight past the man I love to the cluttered study and the silent keyboard…. The sobs rack my soul. You see it was all about love ….  My eyes open when I am finally done…there is nothing left….but the music and the keyboard. I look around my house…a home I was so willing to throw away …just to seek love….Love lives here! My walls painted in soothing yellows, pinks, desert sands and vibrant reds hold hours of my mothers and my laughter and love as we splattered paint and sweat poured down our backs. My rows of bookshelves lining the walls in front of me, laugh back.. holding joyful memories of our adventures in carpentry, as I struggled to hand twist each and every screw that now holds up the hundreds of books lining my walls. Wonder and amazement vibrate under my kitchen floor … I think back to my mother’s laughter as I was covered with glue and struggling to get the Armstrong linoleum in place. When we were done, we sat for an hour staring like children at the job we thought we could not do. The tiles of the small bathroom hold my tears of the dark time before the bridge…my birthday… when I felt no light in my soul and my sister and mother came to force me to live. With each and every tile… my darkness and pain left my being and were buried deep with in the tiles grout. Love lives here. I do not have to leave. It breathes within the walls of this house and the garment of skin that holds my soul. I never have to go back to that couch living in fear and desperate to hear the words "I love you!!" It lives here. The pain lifts and I realize this man who I blamed earlier for the death of my dream has given a gift far greater than roses, candy or diamonds for Valentines Day! I am free…the music is playing! I have broken through that glass wall and have played with the bird! I know now I can live and love, the calm has come….realizing this I get up to make the bed, my voice is humming and Barney bounces at my side! I sigh thinking, it was all about my love for him and nothing about my love for him!   Thank you all....  Love + Light  Lady Lorraine du Lac

						   A dance, new we learn today The steps are foreign and strange Slowly we go as the music takes us away We question now are we ready for the change?   We hesitate with doubt Still the song is too strong We wonder does our power hold any clout  A new dance that will not be rushed along Far too profound This waltz in our dreams Gingerly we follow the rhythm of new ground  Cautious not to go to extremes Clumsy we are A first, I let you lead Trust is our grace that leaves no scar Unselfish in the heart our dance is not one of greed   So dear friend My spirit does not fear Joy laughter and smiles we need not pretend Let us dance and learn for the hand offered is sincere.

						        Once upon a time there was a land without fairy tales. Glass slippers and a perfect fit, magic wands, fairy dust and godmothers who save the day never danced in the minds of little girls who existed in this realm. Wise trees speaking their peace, tiny dwarfs with hearts bigger than the universe and prince charming with all his undying love were banished from the hearts of all tiny maids. This was a land where chivalry was a foreign language in which little boys lacked the message and comprehension. A tragedy for not one little boy knew how to rescue a damsel in distress, rather they walked on by thinking it was not their problem! Slaying a dragon was a laugh, who knew what a dragon was, they were too busy trying to live through the day. The excited and bonding chant of one for all and all for one never was uttered. Trust and depending on another were signs of weakness. Kindness did not exist! Shadow dancing children living in a colorless world where sarcastic laughter echoed through their dead hearts.        The children of this world grew up isolated, solitary entities in a cold world without hope, dreams, faith, imagination and self-confidence. Fear was their only friend and hero. A dark world with no light and sadly they never came to understand the power of a smile or safety of a gentle caresses. Faith was a mystery, while respect was dead and honor was a rumor.        From the start these fledglings had a strong understanding of the position they held in this life. Love was impracticable, an extravagance for the totally insane or those few individuals of wealth and power. Sex was a function, a diversion from the pains and frustrations of this lifetime. A physical act to release the silent angry screams that built up over the years. Violent and passionless with no notion of sharing or bonding with a soul mate, leaving them always empty and ashamed. Often an act that only produced more children vacant of the wonders of childbirth only an endless cycle of populating a dead world.        A world barren of simplicity, grace of an pure moment of joy, no giggles or laughter that released purity and light into the universe. Insane notions of creativity, imagination, comradeship and freedom were locked away in dusty catacombs that no one ventured into. Life’s simple pleasures denied, the children of this world grew to be black souls that walked grasping on to the hand of FEAR ignorant of life’s abundance. Suffering was their comfort and without suffering they had lost all meaning in life.        In this fruitless world, the children’s lives were void of hope and dreams, there was no other way of life. Envy, jealousy, hatred and betrayal thrived in this atmosphere. Life was bitter, gray and depressing in which they could only grow into adults that lived lives of quiet desperation. A world slowly becoming our own….. Hold your breathe, close your eyes, listen quietly….. you can hear their silent screams roaring through the universe.

						   If I had only known. Forever had it’s limits. Forever is not infinity. Only a concept of man’s mental abyss! Forever mere seconds, Forever was now,                   no future                          no tomorrow                              Just now.... If I had only known. My lips would have stayed on yours a second longer. Let the warmth of our hands joined linger for one more breath. I would have felt one more beat of your heart. Swam a second longer in your eyes. Inhaled your soul a little deeper. Cherished all these things for a split moment more. If I had only known...  Forever was only now...then...  dlt © March 16 2004  Lady  Lorraine du Lac

						      The day slowly wanes, Our camp is all set, Stacking the wood, Pressure we forget.        The first flame flickers, A tiny little dance, Growing and burning, Luring us into a trance.        Slowly we open, Our pasts float free, Stories and laughter, No where to flee.        The fire burns brightly, Calming our doubts, Smoke swirls around, Contentment sprouts.        I see who you are, Simple and complex, Outside so calm, Harmony&nbsp;inside perplex!        Next to the fire, I see your ease, The man before me, I love to tease!        This something that grows, A fire within, Open to me, release the flow, Here we begin!

						      The tears slide from inside to out, This pain unbearable no doubt, Torn and bleeding, The time is coming, Decide I must, Forcing me to be, Which one is he?        A crime is this? Love of two at once, Separate, sacred each love strong. Lurking in front, The decision I can’t prolong. I toss and I turn sleep I hunt, By my side which one belongs?        Two loves so diverse! One breathe held, patient is he, The second in trust yet to immerse. Safety is there in both that I share, Different in form leaves not a clue. My choice unclear, burden I bear. Tormented soul whispers adieu.        A crime I commit, To whom I submit? From one I must part, Matters of love a fine art, Emotions unsound, Ecstasy in one is found. Two men loved, one a future bound.        Dlt July 24 2004 all rights reserved

						      Exhausted and wary,  She parts through the trees,  Fingers clinging to her,  Crying and longing,  For a minute to rest,  The priestess stands staring,  Little hope in her breast.  The valley so stunning,  Mesmerizing and cold,  Crystal mountains, rivers of ice,  Siren sounds echoes,  Harmony of a Valley of Glass,  Seducing songs glide,  Gently her hand does one grasp,  Come now, dear one,  Your time to rest is near,  One step forward,  No more to bear.  Her blood answers the source,  A call she must heed,  It is deep within her,  Born of his seed.  Her first step slices,  Straight through to her soul,  Rich blood gushes,  River so deep,  Rushing from her,  Soaking her feet.  Drenched and swooning,  Stop she cannot,  Voice to answer,  Rhythm, so strong,  Flows through her veins,  Pouring forth freely,  She is grateful for pain.  The moon beams dance,  On rain soaked glass,  Blood flows freely feeding the grass.  The Goddess drinks deeply,  Grateful and parched.  Gushing forth,  Ancient thirst,  Only blood can quench,  Knowledge so forbidden,  On the knees,  A heart tells the truth,  Torture is sweet,  Sensation relieves,  Pain is a gift in order to heal.  A mind so sharp,  Tumbles and shatters,  She fears her faith,  Ego she flatters.  Help me she pleads,  Inhaling thick mists,  Swirling around her,  Bats and spiders snicker,  She calls to them slowly,  Please end this I plead!  As the web grows thicker,  Wet and sticky like jam,  Childhood joys fade and flicker,  Silence is held,  Burying the screams,  Her life floats away,  Frozen and bleeding,  Her muse emerges from dreams,  His face is in front,  Changing and gone.  Frigid and glacial,  Crimson and clear,  The calling pours forth,  The essence a tear.  Beating heart shatters,  Solid from fear,  Gasping for breath,  Liquid air does she breathe,  Drowning slowly,  No time to atone!  The past is in front,  Future behind,  For neither do matter,  A moment at hand,  Floats in her mind.  Sinking like quicksand,  A soul pulling away,  Looking down upon her,  Nothing to say.  Suddenly from nowhere,  Arms around her embrace,  Life of the oaks circles,  Her life,  A moment,  Her soul to grace.  Flying to the branches,  Hummingbird whispers,  Life so fragile,  Alone no more,  The oak will not fail,  Strength so pale,  Lean on another,  Message to send,  Learn now she must,  Or her life will end.

						   You snuck up behind me,  Sliding out of the blue.  I did not want nor seek,  This love I feel for you.  &nbsp;  A butterfly I desired,  With dew kissed wings.  To fly carelessly,  Never to dream.   Laughing and carefree,  Forever I seek,  Fast moments of pleasure,  Never "Forever" did I speak.   Denial is lost,  This feeling will last,  The door you opened,  I must deal with the past.   Alone you leave me,  This I must do.  I pray I might see,  The one&nbsp;is it&nbsp;you?   dlt july 2004 all rights reserved.

						   A life so full, One of grace, Daily I strive, To balance the pace.  From the heart, Truth so bold, Desires denied, Trust in the old.  Beliefs are soon shattered, Confusion exists. Faith so shallow, Praying for bliss.  The mists of the path, Foggy and dense, Lessons of suffering, Joy sings from the fence.  Slowly I learn, Why must I suffer? To give so easy, To receive is tougher.  Open the heart, Risk to be taken, Balance of two, Not be forsaken.  Alone I now sit, Life scattered and tattered. Of my own making, Does it really matter?  Strength from within, Now I must find. Depend on one self, God in due time.  DLT © July 11 2004

						   The flame burns bright Moths circle and chant Around and around they go Back off they cant  Drawn to the motion The shadows and heat Moths dive deeply Their ends do they meet  The men dance around her They are the moths to the flame Circling and diving Screaming her name  The muse knows not  A flaming heart she holds Hope she clutches close Love opening the folds  She seeks for the one Dancing around the flame Courage he has  Regardless of his shame  The  moths dance around her The wings singed black Her flame is a song Sanity they lack  She cries for each one They  know not what they have done Life snuffed out quickly Her flame is the sun  Tears of a muse Lost and depressed. Life has no meaning She prays for a  rest  Tears of a river Deeper and fast Her flame extinguished  She prays for the last  The moth that circled So far and so slow Her heart flickers Trust does he sow  Forever so strong Her weakness revealed A muse so human Her fate once sealed.  Forever alone Past to atone The muse cries freely Afraid to believe  Falling to her knees She begs and she pleads Patience and kindness Love to fill her needs  The moth dances to and fro Uncertain of where to go To her and away Now  he can’t say  Patience and balance she must learn So long has she lived Her flame forever to burn Trust the key to a heart that will never flee.

						   I smile to  myself as slowly you become Listening to the muse You glow and you shun The past and the future for us there is none  Fly high dear friend Live with glory Understand the gifts  Content moments writing your story  Tears travel slowly mixing with the dew Forever a solitary walk Comfort alone in memories for few who knew.. Fate of a muse  The dance of the sacred A muse who enchants Young men to question Whispers of their souls chants  Her fate she embraces like a warm  summer breeze Loneliness banished with a waltz of a bee Poets, carpenters, lovers and dreamers They come to her lost and forlorn  Her laughter is rapture Challenging to open rusted hearts Dusty minds that rarely were used Marriage of the two left many confused..  Be on your way, skipping across lava Gently she whispers forever tomorrow Learn and be happy for one day you will say… Mountains or Oceans hold neither at bay.  A word so kind Confession of truth Departing fears  Edifying muses.  A hint A guess Thinking deep Time unfolds  Expectations dashed Life a wonder Only a moment,  Now to be lived.  I did not know Pleasure so bold Appreciation shows Honesty richly told.  Joys of life Thankful today Rich and rife Spirits  play!  Swirling snow waltzing around us Creeping dark flees towards the light Endless hope infinitely blooms Dawn forever dances on the horizon.  Thankful the muse Grateful to know No longer unique Alone no more to go.  The  muse is tired She hears the call Captured by laughter Her men of life’s ball!  DLT July 2004

						     I thought it was done, I believed it was over, That door was closed, Hope for the future!  I whispered, No… As the story was told. Lies, Deceit, Hatred, Dishonor, Betrayal….  What had I done? I am no villainess, Reception of the vile, Truth a horror to behold, How can this be? Your hatred is so bold!  You call me the darkness, You say that I lie, You label me insane, As Anavian slides through your brain.  No more will I take, The wounds still to fresh, Enlighten all other, I go now to rest.

						   Truth  It knocks on my gate, Recognizing the fate, I turn to run, Truth soon to come.  A heart so hollow, Pain to follow, Your character I label, I see now a fable.  Creaking and straining, Truth stands reigning, Deaf are the ears, Eyes filled with tears.  Fault is my own, The seeds I had sown, Closing my eyes, Your lies seemed so wise.  Truth is the tower, It holds all the power, Shallow you be, Never to see.  The path I chose, Never to lose, Light from within, Love never a sin.  DLT © july 9 2004

Changes You Me Both Neither Ringing laughter Glides through my heart Knocking on the wall Erect between us Slowly your soul Leaks forth your nectar A smile  Dancing laughter Soulful eyes That can not look in mine Lento sun rising Strong and warm Potent and pure Opening doors Closing doors No longer one We crest  on our shores Leaving pebbles  and foam  Scattered Along our beaches A memento or a pearl in the making?

Friends do surround me, Our language few know, In the sea we do dance, Come live in the glow!        Come to me dear one, In waves we do fly, Living in peace, Pure moments that cry.

My song I do sing, To your ears it does flee, Listen and hear, The message I bring.        Come to us now, Love on the wing, Forever, my vow. A queen and her king.        Soon you will hear, The whispers of few, Songs of the dolphins, Deep in the blue.        Come to us now, Listen and be, My partner, my love, Living at the edge of the sea.

						        The weather forecast called for thunderstorms today. Hot and sticky slowly the gray skies are sliding into the past. The sun is reaching back from the future demanding to live in the now. I watch the shadows of the leaves dance on my deck and think to myself what is the   MORE  ? I am lost. No purpose in life, empty shallow at 42 I sit here and wonder what is life about? The shadows dance on the deck…gray, one dimensional, and dim. These shadows are my life. The winds of change tickles the edges, I ask when will I no longer be a shadow, but a full living leaf that is rooted to the tree?      When did my life become so empty? Many say this is depression but it is not, it is something so much more. A form of spiritual death a precious gift dying that I know I must release or forever be lost. So I sit on the deck watch the dancing grays and pray for the green. I have always been one to say I live without regrets. That I hold all that has been an experience of my past as a gift be it good or bad. Did Parsifal feel this emptiness on his search for the holy grail? So alone, desperate and dying? Was his world gray and meaningless before he found the secret? Did he witness the gray to green miracle? Can I find the strength to witness my own color guard change?       At this moment I regret that I have not lived a more normal life. This truth stares me in the face and shouts from the tips of the leaves…edgings of green coming into focus. Yes I have some fabulous tales to spin around a campfire and laughter comes easily as the drama queen pulls out her crown in the telling. The life of a seeker is lonely. We have many experiences to share to teach and to learn from. I can’t help thinking though at the end of the day that these experiences are the gray shadows on the deck compared to the gentle smile of a child that calls you mother. The passion of climbing a mountain face pales in comparison to listening to the steady breathing of your partner as you fall asleep at the end of the day. The comfort of writing is empty when mirrored to the sharing of your soul face to face with one you love, all the while knowing the risk of loss you take but, taking the chance anyway. My passion for this single isolated life is dying, I miss the touch of a lover, the quiet silences and the shoulder to lean on. I miss them? I laugh, how can I miss something I never have had? Again it is the knowing that lives deep in my essence that haunts me, telling me let go and believe. Has time tainted me? For at this moment I have little faith in what I have yet to experience, rather the knowledge of my past haunts me and calls from the dim grays that the MORE is a myth to forget and not strive for. Parsifal did you feel this? Where is the green?      I fight hard now to grasp onto anything that will make me feel. A woman so passionate about life I am now but a whisp of a ghost floating through life. Maybe I have it all wrong…. Always have! This is a devastating reality to come face to face with. The quest for inner peace, pushing forward courageously, always to do good for others while seeing the best of this world in all, is this a fable? I sit in reflection as the sun hides behind a huge black edged cloud. I ask, is there no silver lining for the seeker? I have always maintained that the religions that stated that Jesus never had a life companion were wrong. The belief that in having only himself and God was enough was a myth. I believed wholeheartedly that Jesus and Mary Magdala were two parts of one. This is union of soul, mind and body was the way to the divine. Trust, love, honor and respect shared between two people an experience that we all must strive for to reach ecstatic union with God. Not just sex people! Rather so much MORE. Now I doubt this, maybe the religions are correct. There are those of us whom are to be alone, as Christ is in the Bible to share the experiences of life and God, but never to share with another the total marriage of two souls that create passion for living. Am I giving up hope or living in reality? This thought saddens me for if I accept this as the role of my life what else will I settle for?      The sun hides still as the passion of these question fades. Where did this all come from one might ask. The truth is the answer. When one is faced with a truth about themselves we have options to take but, only one leads to a greater freedom. That option is surrender and acceptance of our responsibility. I must now speak the truth one so painful that I, like the sun, have hidden for years behind the clouds of a false reality. No longer may I hide this secret that I myself must face. The reasoning for the death of my passionate life. I must go there again.      Many have heard the story of my life, the trials and tribulations that I have survived. I have been compared to by others as having the power and essence of the Mary Magdala. I have spent months now reading of her, trying to see the resemblance. For you see, I do not see this at all. Mary Magdala was a woman of divine courage and faith. I am anything but. If I reflect on my beliefs that Mary and Jesus had a sacred marriage and that she gave birth, I see no comparison to me. This woman faced the decision, accepted the help of others and brought life into this world. I did no such thing.      Ten years ago, I made a decision in my life that lacked courage or the strength of one who holds the essence of Mary Magdala. A decision that will forever haunt me and that I believe I am being punished for. A wound that never heals. When asked what age was your favorite, I always quickly comment back 33! I go on to explain that is was the year that I changed my life. Returning to school, leaving my comfortable restaurant job, in great physical shape, facing truths and helping others. I never mention though that the age of 33 also held the worst day of my life. All these simple reasons that I state for being the best year of my life hinged on a decision that also made it the worst day of my life, a day of the coward and not accepting the gift that was given to me.      That day I sat alone on my couch crying tears that I hope I never have to shed again in this life. Then again, if presented with the same decision, I would not even consider the choice I made that day. I was pregnant, alone and afraid. The shadows on the deck are no longer visible, blocked from the sun the gray reigns as I go back to that day. A day I hid away, a choice I made that put me on a different path, one of my own free will, one that I regret.      I sat alone that day of the decision due to my own fear. This pregancy was not planned, we took precautions, I was careful and still this happens. I did what I thought was right in this relationship. I had previously had a year of celibacy and slowly dated this man. We did not sleep together until we were long into the relationship and then it was only once. I did not tell him of the child. I did not trust that he would not leave me where I was already, that of being alone. I thought to myself why take that risk? Why add fuel to the pain I was already experiencing? Why think that he would be any different than all the other men in my life? That he would actually stand by me, help and be a support. I did not even allow him the opportunity to try, I denied him the truth and myself the lesson of trust.      Alone I sat that day, on the couch speaking to a child that I did not have the heart to bring into this world. I loved this child, I wanted this child, but I lacked the courage, faith and respect for myself and God that I could do this. So instead on that day that the gray began to edge into my life, I cried and begged for forgiveness to a child that lived within me. I convinced myself that this was for the best, as I tried to convince this force I felt alive within me that same fact. I knew the child was fighting for its life, I felt it within me and the tears came harder and faster. I hated myself for lacking the faith in myself and God. I hated myself for believing that this was the right decision. Sadly, I still hate myself.     The childs voice left me that afternoon and with it my true passion in life. I chose my path. I saw the pregancy and this child as a cage, something I feared all my life. Reality was and is, that decision to deny myself the gift of that child was the true cage. One that there is no release from, one that I live in to this day.      Slowly, I come back to the present. The sun has slipped behind the hills and dusk will soon be upon me. The cage and the bars are still there, formed by the desire of the green of a leaf. Maybe tomorrow it will be sunny and I may heal some from opening this wound. Or maybe tomorrow the sky will cry a million tears for the path I chose. I only know now, the truth is told. Before this truth was faced, I was living a lie, a mask placed before all to see. I am raw now, naked and vulnerable. Who do you see? In front of me, stands Mary Magdala smiling.
