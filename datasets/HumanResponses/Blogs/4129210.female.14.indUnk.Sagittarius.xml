      8-15-04  Today i just got back from my friends house ** i stayed the nite **... but anyways, my name is Casey but my nickname is Kitty.. i am in the 9th grade and I live in Flordia... i play the gutiar and i love metal and rock... and i like pop *when i feel like singing*.. i have three younger brothers **annoying as hell, but what can i do**...and i live with both my parents = dads in afganastan for now.. he'll be back soon.. i only have a couple best friends... i used to have more but, best friends are so hard to find these days... to many people talk shit.... but enough about people.. now back to me... lol.. i like to draw, write poems, sing, talk on the phone & internet, watch movies and read...  i dont know what i want to be when i grow up > but some ideas are ... a marine bioligist, animator, something to do with animals, i used to want to be a boxer, a gutarist or an actress... lol, so many dreams = i live in a fantasy world.. not really in touch with reality.... anyways i love school.. highschool is so much diffrent than middle school... and every morning that i wake up i look forward to going to school... lol.. i'm such a dork... but it doesnt take a super genius to figure that out... well i'm gonna go.. g2g figure something else to do....  Later ~~KITTY~~  8-16-04 Just got back from school.. i had fun.. but it didnt feel the same.. i guess it didnt feel the same becuase i dont feel like me... i'm not happy, but really there's nothing i can do... it's been happening since Dec and i've tried my best so stop it, but i just ended up not hanging out with my friends ** i dont want them to have to put up with my problems ** there are only a couple people i can really talk to now... Brandon,**Tinkerbell**( kelsey ) and Steel... they are the only ones that kind of know whats going on in my life **THANKYOU, YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST** well i g2g... have some homework to do... Later ~~Kitty~~   8-17-04 Another day has passed by... It really feels wierd to know that life is going by very  quick... So here's one piece of adivice you can take... You only live once, So don't ruin it or let the right person make the wrong turn your life... you'll regret it... But anyways... school was fun today > expecially my art class ** but i love drawing ** so really i should love it... but the bad thing is i only have it for half a semester.. next semester i have P.E... and i really dont want that... moving on... you know when you have a best friend and you guys stop hanging out?... but then you guys start hanging out agian and you realize oyu odnt know anything about that person anymore?... well that is what happened to me in the last week... i started hanging out with one of my best friends agian **we have known eachother since third grade... but then she ditched me for her boyfriend**... anyways i really am having trouble seeing why she thought that everything would be the same.... we stopped hanging out for eight months becuase of her boyfriend and she expected me to come right back to her and be buddy buddy when her boyfriend left.. if you ask me i think thats bullshit of course i forgive her and all but it won't be the same... anyways i had a very odd day so i'm gonna go draw or write some notes..  Later ~~Kitty~~

      GoodBye: She turns off the phone Shuts her eyes Drops it Can't believe it's goodbye She knows she loves him He loves her too But the hell with the game She says thier through No more waiting  For him to return Still very sore From where she was burned She knows she'll have to try  Not to give in She'll make herself believe That she doesn't love him She knows it's hard Almost impossible But she'll have to believe  That the pain is stoppable She has to get rid of him As fast as she can  To erase him completely  For that is her plan And if he were to come near She'll have to turn her back With a thousand of her tears    Every Moment: Every moment my heart races mind lost and confused in many cases anything could happen  on the dangerous path that lie ahead cuaght between the heart and mind bad news is what i dread  chained to my depression thats imprisioned me for years every second of everyday is a thousand of my tears running through my nightmares like a horror movie scene Knowing that your nervous just makes my heart bleed i lay there at night i dream that your okay i close my shaking eyes whisper to myself and pray i pray that you will stay safe  and that you will always know that i love you more than air... and i'm waiting here at home By: Me

      Whats up?.... If your bored here are some questions you can ponder over...Are children who act in rated 'R' movies allowed to see them?  Can you make a candle out of your earwax? When French people swear do they say pardon my English? Aren't the 'good things that come to those who wait' just the leftovers from the people that got there first? If the swat team breaks down your door do they have to replace it later? Can a fire truck park in the fire lane? Can it be cloudy and foggy at the same time? "Cute as a button" Is that supposed to be a compliment? Since when are buttons cute? Can you breathe out of your nose and mouth at the same time? Are marbles made of marble?  Why does the last piece of ice always stick to the bottom of the cup? If you pay for a vacation and your plane crashes on the way there, do you get you money back? (Granted you lived) Why did Yankee Doodle name the feather in his hat Macaroni? Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these dangly things here and drink what comes out"? Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken over there ... I'm gonna eat the first thing that comes out if its butt"?
