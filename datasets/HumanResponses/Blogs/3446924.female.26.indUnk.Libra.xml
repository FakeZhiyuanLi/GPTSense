      Cinta adalah.... Berbahagia untuk orang lain saat mereka bahagia Bersedih untuk orang lain dikala mereka sedih Bersama di kala suka dan duka Cinta adalah SUMBER KEKUATAN.... Cinta adalah.... Bersikap jujur pada diri sendiri sepanjang waktu Bersikap jujur kepada dia sepanjang waktu Bercerita, mendengar dan tak pernah berpura-pura.... Cinta adalah.... Pemahaman yang begitu lengkap sehingga kita  merasa bagian dirinya Menerima dia apa adanya dia  Dan tak mencoba mengubahnya menjadi orang lain Cinta adalah.... Kebebasan mengikuti hasratmu sendiri Sekaligus berbagi pengalaman dengannya Cinta adalah.... Amukan badai Ketenangan pelangi Cinta adalah.... Memberi dan menerima dalam kehidupan sehari-hari Bersikap sabar dengan kebutuhan dan hasrat  pasangannya Cinta adalah.... Mengetahui bahwa dia akan selalu bersamamu  apapun yang akan terjadi Merindukan dia saat dia pergi tetapi tetap dekat di  hati sepanjang waktu
