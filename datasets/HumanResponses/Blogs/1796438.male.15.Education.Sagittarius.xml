        DIFFERENTIATING f(x) ± g(x)   If f(x) = 4x and g(x) = x² find dy/dx of 4x + x².  Write down your guess. Check by differentiating from first principles. _______________________________  lim  f(x+h) - f(x)  h→0 h  f(x) = 4x + x² f(x+h) = 4(x+h) + (x+h)² f(x+h) = 4x + 4h + x² + 2xh + h²  lim  4x + 4h + x² + 2xh + h² - (4x + x²)  h→0 h  lim  4h + 2xh + h²  h→0 h  lim  h(4 + 2x + h)  h→0 h  lim 4h + 2x + h h→0  4 + 2x _______________________________  Therefore, for y = f(x) ± g(x) we can say:   dy  = f'(x) ± g'(x) dx _______________________________  EXAMPLES  y = x^3 + 3x + 6 y' = 3 * x^2 + 1 * 3x^0 + 0 y' = 3x^2 + 3  y = x^4 + x^(1/2) + 10 y' = 4 * x^3 + 1/2 * x^(-1/2) + 0 y' = 4x^3 + 1 / (2 x^(1/2) )

       I'd have to say that I am the most unorganised person on the history of this planet. I've created this site so I can re-write all my notes from Chem, Geography and Intro Calc and stick them on here. That way when I lose all my sheets I can just log on and find them again. (yay!)

      Oh my.  Geography test on Wednesday...  Intro Calc investigation on Wenddnesday...  Geometry and Trigoneometry investigation on Wednesday...  Physics Prac test on Wednesday...  Okay, so the prac test is actaully on Friday, but still. Three things I have to study for. I keep running out of free time. If it wern't for the Google Toolbar and the BlogThis! button I probably wouldn't be posting at all.

      Tonight I was just sitting here, having a discussion about My Restaurant Rules at www.tvaus.com when suddenly, out of the blue, I am caught up in a whirlwind about relativity. Belladonna said some comments about Nick and Emily, two people on the reality tv show. Sam, who is Nick's brother in real life, got angry and the two started arguing. Here's a bit of transcript.  ______________________________________________________________  Belladonna wrote:   Again, we are from *different worlds*   You don't have to like my opinion, you just have to respect it    ______________________________________________________________  Smiffyjo wrote:  Alright perhaps I'm being belligerent but I'm sick of this word 'opinion' being chucked around like it vindicates everything.  I don't get this 'just giving opinion' thing. Just because someone is just giving opinion doesnt mean it is justified or given nicely. Opinions can be wrong factually and morally. And so no I don't even have to respect your opinion and if you don't believe me think of Hitler. Does anyone really think his opinions deserved respect? His opinions were wrong factually speaking and morally speaking. And if you really want to be tripped out.. do you respect my opinion that not all opinions deserve respect?  ______________________________________________________________  tntnnbltn wrote:   You certaintely do like to use Hitler as an example often.   But the only reason we see Hitler's opinions as being wrong factually and morally is becaue ours are different. If you had the same opinions then you would think the opinions of everyone else are wrong morally and factually. Society has deided that what we believe to be right is right and whatever we believe to be wrong is wrong. I'm not saing that Hitler should be right. I'm just saying that in some alternate universe someone might be saying how wrong morally and factually Abraham Lincoln's ideas were, and that Hitler was the true pioneer of the world. It all depends on a combination of past history and present society.   ______________________________________________________________  smiffyjo wrote:   HAHHAHAAHHA  You are right I do use the example a lot   Alright this is fun... I use the Hitler example a lot cause it is an example where people usually cant help but concede that there is something to some opinions being wrong. You however have stuck to relativism (cheers on consistency  )  Alright where to begin?  mmm dont want to bore people. I'll start here: If Hitler has won the war and managed to convince everyone that the Jews and Gypsies werent real people would the world (objectively and factually speaking) be a different place? Would for instance the Jews and Gypsies BECOME less then human?   ______________________________________________________________  I did that? Is that a good thing? Oh well, better play along with it now.    If that scenario was true then it would be believed that they were indeed less human, although there would be some who would disagree, I'll grant you that. In our current world however they are considered equal, although there are some who do disagree. I guess that your question can't be answered to any degree of certainty, especially seeming you did not specify wether they are less human from our perspective or their perspective. They way you worded it sounds [in my opinion  ] that you were asking whether they were less human in our eyes just because they are less human in the eyes of those in the proposed scenario. Alternatively, you could've been asking whether in the eyes of the people in that world whether gypsies and jews were less human. Each answer would be different because of the different beliefs of right and wrong.   To think of this in a different way were African Americans less human in the past? Today we would say no, they were always human, always equal. In the past we [implying the dominant 'white' people] would've said no, they're not as human. Then in the middle it would've been all blurred as opinions (there's that word again) change. Then you have the opinions of the African American's themselves, which I'm not even going to attempt predicting (seeming how I'm neither African American nor in timeframe I'm talking about).  ______________________________________________________________  I never realised I was so insightful. I wonder if it happens in real life too? I'm readily waiting for a reply...

      I've recently been hanging out in the  Recently Updated  section of www.blogger.com looking for some sites, and to my surprise I found many. Fine, lots of them were boring... And most of the rest were in a different language...  Still, I have found myself around 5 sites which now reside in the Blogs section of my Favorites.  Hmm... I just noticed it's spelt Favorites rather than Favourites. I wonder if there's an Australian version of IE6...  Anyway, I'll keep an eye on them. Some I mater later decide are boring and shall once more return to the pit of Recently Updated blogs. The others may even find themselves placed on here to share with all you people reading this. Then again, the only people reading this are probably the people who's blogs are in my favourites list anyway.

      How was today? I'm asking myself that question as I type. I'd say somewhere between crap and semi-crap. Not very productive, that's for sure. I fell asleep during the movie in geography, probably not a good thing considering the stuff on there is certain to be in the test on Wednesday, Week 5. Still, I had seen the movie before (Turning the Tides) and it was spoken by this irritating British guy. And I literally didn't do anything during English Lit either. I have to type up all the quotes from Oedipus that relate to conscience, but I can only find one and I can't be bothered reading it again to pick out all of the other forms of the word. I'll do it Sunday night I guess.  Is it just me or are the days getting longer and longer? For the second day in a row I thought school had finished when there was still one lesson to go. at least I realised I had another class left today, unlike yesterday when I had walked 20 metres home before realising there was no one else with me.  I had a weird dream last night. I dreamt that I was doing the Geometry and Trigonometry test again, but I was really tired. The next day I got an absolute shit score. I ooked back and on the essay where my conclusion should have been there was a message involving some or all of the words "work", "ban", "night time", "sleep". The gist of it was that I was so tired I fell asleep during the test. I also missed out on writing the answer to a really easy question two pages back because I was going to do that after the essay. While this may seem strange (essays in a G&T test?!?!) it's freakishly true. Today I did fall asleep during something I'll need for a test, and I got my Physics assignment back, losing the most marks in my conclusion. Maybe I'm psychic in my deams? Freaky.

      I have no idea why I am doing this. I already have one blog to post at. You'd think that would be enough. No, apparently not. It's strange. My other blog (http://loudcrowd.blogspot.com)is hidden from the public but open to my friends. This blog though is the exact opposite. I havn't told my friends about it but every time I post it will appear on the main page.  Loudcrowd.blogspot.com is a good site I guess. Hardly anyone posts there. My friend Morgan moved from the little town of Esperance where I reside in Western Australia all the way to Perth (the city, 8 hours away). In fear of falling out of contact with her I decided to re-create my dreams of a community blog with all of my friends posting. WE as a group are called the Loud Crowd by the librarian whose library we hang out in front of in the morning. She doesn't mind one bit though cause we always leave the area absolutely spotless. So that's how the name came about.  To whomever is reading this: Do you watch My Restaurant Rules? If not, you really should. For overseas people (i.e. not in Australia) you can get the episodes from http://tvt.milfclan.com. I'm voting for Perth. I'm been talking to Ash, and he's sending down some flyers so I can hand them around town and get people to vote.  Oh well, that's it for now. Bye.

      Its 3:22 am. And I'm cold. And I'm tired.  I've completed 1,469 words of my English Lit essay that is due in about 5 hours from now.  I've completed 0 words of my Physics report that was due in 67 hours ago.  I hate my life right now. Why do things always get left to the last minute? Everyone else in my classes seems to be able to get things done on time.  To ake things even better (Ha!) exams start Wednesday, now less than 48 hours away.  I'll come back when I'm less tired & grumpy.  Why am I even on here? I should be working.

       Merry Christmas  Sorry, but I don't really have anything to talk about right now. It's the beggining of the holidays, and I havn't seen anyone. Don't worry, this will be updated by someone else as soon as I can actually find soemone else. Biggest news now is the talk of a possible group metting on the 6th of January. Finsh and Chips, drinks, movies, etc. More information as soon as it becomes avaliable.

       Movie Day  This Tuesday was movie day. The two options were either School of Rock or Looney Tunes. In the morning it was pretty much average. Hera was absent, leading to speculation that she only attends school for the work. The siren went and everyone headed off to the form rooms. Period 1 saw the group slitting off into the smaller groups: those in the English room, those in the  and those who wern't. In the English room was myself, along with Morgan, Tonya, Kyla, Mandy, Teagan... (I think that's everyone. Forgive me if I'm wrong). well, everyone else. In the English room we were working on the laptops trying to organise the class poetry book, "Cicadas in a Pond". The work was very hectic, and demanded a stop for lunch before everyone else had theirs. Morgan and Lily walked down to the shop to get fish and chips, but unfortunately it was closed. The came back with chips, and we managed to have a decent meal anyway (after hiding the poster that said "No Eating In Room 3 Or Else". We got lots done on the poetry book, including ordering it and everything. Trust me, this was a big breakthrough for us.  Meanwhile other talents were being put to use in the Art room between recess and lunch. Hawkins, Cartledge and Jordan were in there finishing their respective portraits. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, there were no large scale paint wars. However Jordan did miscalculate the amount of paint neededfor his painting and ended up with a result that could be improved. Both of the Brad's however came to the decision that their pieces of art were perfect. Everyone else spent their time wandering around... talking, sitting, avoiding the possibility of playing sport and other everyday tasks.  After lunch we traversed over to Fenwick 3 Cinemas. We lined up in 2 lnes, one for each movie. The School of Rock line stretched at least twice as long as the Looney Tunes line. In cinema 2 (L.T.) was myself, Cartledge, Hawkins, Jordan, Cody and Mandy. In cinema 1 (S.o.R.) was the remainder of the group going to the movies. As Looney Tunes was shorter than School of Rock by approximately half an hour we were able to watch the beginning of another Lonney Tunes cartoon, but the sound was horrendous, and it would've been better just to sit and talk. After the movies everyone was forced to return to the school via the busses, and then we went home.   Assembly  Lots of people got prizes at the assembly on Wednesday. Here's a list of winner of the prizes: Art            :   Lily Business  :   Hayden Computer :   Jordan Drama      :   Morgan                 :   Tonya   English     :   Hayden French      :   Lily Japanese :   Hawkins Horse       :   Mandy Media       :   Morgan S & E        :   Morgan  Challenge Bank endeavor award : Lily  Remember, those are only the prizes. Many people also got merit certificates. Congratulations to all.    Farewell  Thursday was the last day of school for Morgan, who we will all miss. She is moving up to Perth, but she is still as much of a member of the Loud Crowd as anyone else. We hope to be hearing from her via this website in the near future. That way she can read up on our news and we can read up on hers. If you want to contact her then email her at coyote_ugly14788@hotmail.com and say hello.   Site Update  Tonya and Morgan now have posting abilities. We hope to hear interesting tales from them soon...

       Reward Camp   Thursday was the day of the Reward Camp. The library was quite a sight with around 8 sleeping bags, pillows and other assorted items lined up. The siren went and those going on reward camp parted with those who... Weren't. Then it was a wait at the bus stop... a long anxious wait. Finally the hostel bus drove around the corner. The trailer was bigger than the bus! Yes, the trailer was big, but it was mostly because the bus was so small. We packed our bags and hopped on. First we went to Dewsons to pick up the food, then headed back to the high school to collect the first aid kit which was forgotten. Then it was a 1 hour drive up to the Duke of Orleans.   1 very long hour later we checked out the accommodation. In room 22 was Morgan, Lily, Mandy, Tonya and Heather. In room 24 was Hawkins, Cartledge, Jordan and myself. Of course, separating us was the teachers. The houses themselves had two rooms: on with tables, chairs, sink, cupboards and two bunk beds, the other with cupboards and a large double bed. After the food was sorted out we headed down to Wharton's Beach. Brad (x2), Mandy and Lily entered the water while the rest of us preferred to stay "dry" on land. Jordan and I (later joined by Brad) started digging a hole. It kept caving it, and was rather muddy very quickly. It wasn't helped by the fact that we hit a layer of black sand which was impossible to dig through. Cartledge was buried, but later decided that the ordeal was too painful after the sand was being thrown at him. A particular highlight was leaving the beach. We waited for the group of students on the rocks to go back to the bus. Nothing happened. We blew whistles. Nothing happened. We waved Brad's shirt around. Nothing happened. We honked the bus horn. Nothing happened. We drove off. They started to walk. We went half way up the hill (and reversed) before the guys arrived. It was another 5 minutes before the girls got there. At least the guys raced to the bus...   After lunch we headed back out to Wharton's to play Survivor. Both Brads, Morgan, Tonya and Jacqui bore the green flag of the snake. Lily, Jordan, Heather, Mandy and myself carried the red flag of the fish. This will be told from the red teams perspective purely for the fact that I couldn't be in two places at once. While Mandy ran up the stairs to retrieve a key Lily and I had to dig under a post 5cm off of the ground. When Mandy returned she helped us dig until the hole was large enough for all 3 of us to crawl under. Mandy then unlock the handcuffs on Jordan and all four of us dug under yet another post to reach Heather. From there I ran up to the end of a field covered in cones while everyone else blindfolded themselves. By this point we were coming last. I then had to instruct everyone where to walk to stand on cones until everyone had three each. Then we were up to the part of the challenge called Monster. All five of us had to be touching while getting across a set distance with only three body parts touching the ground. It took 2 tries before Mr.. Snow pointed out that it doesn't necessarily have to be the same body part always touching the ground. Then it was a matter of picking up two people while the others walked (making sure not to have two feet on the ground at once).   By this stage the game was pretty much even. We ran for the marker and read the text. "20 paces south". We halved this and walked 10 steps towards the stairs. We scrambled through the dirt and almost immediately found our first playing card/ It said "20 paces west". We took ten steps towards the water and dug with yellow team. They found our card (we had the clubs suit) and left them to their own work. It said "20 paces north east". We ran back up to where our marker was and look around with the blue team. After 3 minutes the blue team left (apparently they had read their card wrong) and after 5 minutes we were still empty handed. We asked Mr. Snow and he said that because it was diagonal the card may not have been placed in the circle he marked out. Sure enough when we went 10 paces north east from our starting point it was one metres away from the circle he placed. We found our third card which said 30 paces north. I knew that the yellow team had already found their fourth and final card. We continued on pacing. Lily was the one who found it. It was encased in a large block of ice. It was then that I realised what the yellow team was doing. They were defrosting the card in the water. Lily took care of that by throwing the rock at the ground, smashing the ice into many pieces. We ran to the finish line with our four cards and won. The green team came fourth (out of four). (Still, they managed to take a share out of our chocolates...)   Spotlight was great. Aim: Find a miraculous way to avoid the torches of Mr. Snow and Ms. Handley to make it to the top of the play ground equipment. Very fun, had it not been for the fact that the only way someone won was because the teachers left their torches off for 20 seconds because no one would ever win. Especially not with Brad's super bright torch. Especially not with the playground area enclosed by a fence. Especially not with Mr. Snow inside the fence and Ms. Handley patrolling around outside. Especially not with some of the less responsible people wandering off. The following day was tiring. I dug a metre deep hole all by myself which I was quite comfortable in. Meanwhile everyone else decided to play cricket around me and then complained that my hole was getting in the way of their pitch. The nerve of some people. Then we filled in the hole, returned to camp and packed up. The bus ride back was possibly more boring then the way over. Mr Snow's insistence of cricket being played over the radio did not help. Just out of Esperance the trailer door feel down and we drove down the road while everything collected dust. Fortunately someone pointed this out to us before our belongings were strewn down the road.    Surprise Party   On Sunday between 4pm and 9pm was Morgan's farewell/fancy dress/surprise party. I was there dressed up as the Property Man (from The Stolen Prince), with Mike, Brad, other Brad, David, Lily, Shelli, Tonya, Zoe, Rose, Paul, and of course, Morgan. Costumes included Tinkerbell, Trinity and a very convincing Ugly. After Rose returned from choir we played spotlight. Some people didn't seem to grasp the point of the game and before it was really started it was finished. The playground was sort of ruined by the fact that it was mostly open ground and there was a street light placed right next to it.

       The Final Week  School is only 1 week away... I honestly don't know whether to be excited or not about it. Just when you think the holidays are boring and there's nothing left to do, then thought of another 10 weeks only with new (and probably horrible) teachers grabs you from behind. Still, some good things will come out of school. Ie, my new calculator. The only problem is that with school on I won't be able to program. I've finally learnt how to make games, except I have to write the code on the computer then send the game over to the calc. That means that I can't sit around in class like I usully do working on some unrelated program (with the exception of maths where I sat making program for maths).   Henriette Arrives  The Danish girl,  Henriette, arrived in Esperance two days ago. She will be living with David. Various people (such as myself) do not believe that David is the wisest choice of person to be staying with. In fact it may promote the myth that Australia is a dangerous and hostile place. Oh well, there's a soccer game at 1pm tomorrow. A number of people are invited, and it will be an opportunity to meet her and inform her that not all people are as deadly as David.

       Double Update  I can't be bothered writing a big update. Right now I'm half asleep and currently it doesn't look like I'm going to wake up. Still, I didn't get time to update last week, so right now it's essential that I post anything, especially considering how busy the last two weeks have been.   Movies  On Tuesday everyone went to the movies. By everyone I mean myself, as well as Hawkins, Cartledge, Matt, Lily, Tonya, Kyla, Zoe, Ash, Mike, Candice and quite possibly someone else who I have forgotten. We met at Top End at 5:00 and ate food and talked, wasting time until the movies. Ash and I watched Spy Kids 3D. Everyone else watched Master and Commander. I would've gone with the majority of the group had it not been for their horrible taste in film. I doubt I would've had the guts to stand watching 138 minutes of Russell Crowe on some boat in some ocean in some war some time ago. Spy Kids 3D was much better. Not only was I quite possibly the tallest person in the entire cinema, and not only did we get to witness some children attempting to sneak into the cinema before getting chucked out, but we got to keep the 3D glasses! How cool is that? After the movie I waited with Ash 1 hour for the other movie to finish, eating very munchy popcorn and memorising the patterns of the lights on the roof. Fianlly the other movie finished and everyone went home.   Sleepovers  On Friday I headed up to Salmon Gums with Hawkins to spend an entire 4 days in the same house as David. It is a miracle I survived that long. The first day was one of boredom and badminton. Both involved a lack of computers. I don't fully know how many hours of badminton was played in the first day, but it felt like it was bordering on four. The next day was only slightly better. The was even more badminton, this time with punishments for screwing up serves. That night we watched Bubblegum Crisis an awful lot. It was the following day that we got the Nintendo 64 games working. We spent the rest of the day was spent gathered around the computer playing Super Smash Bros. (I love that game! I once again kicked butt with Yoshi).  The same applied for the day after. Some of the major highlights were going home, hiding David's slingshot (I really should remember to tell him where that is), and covering David with 7 cushions, 1 pillow and a mattress while he was helplessly asleep on the couch. Oh, I am evil! On Wednesday (well at least I think it was Wednesday. As I said before I am rther tired) Brad, Brad and Sam slept over my place. I can't be bothered remembering anything interesting, and I doubt anything interesting did happen at all, but we did watch some DVD's and play some board games. Despite the sleepover being named "Card Night" only two games of cards actually occured. The surprise game of the day was Wario Ware for GBA. Specifically Skate Boarding, which Cartledge scorwd 143 in. I have since beaten the high score, which now stands at 171.

       HAPPY NEW YEAR!  Yes, 2004 has rolled around, as we look forwards to yet another year of school. Oh... goodie (sarcasm). Nah, just kidding. It will be fun. Trust me. There'll be new classes, new seating plans, new timetables. Most importantly, school will be 10 minutes shorter. Yay!   Visitors  Yeah, Jan 1 2004 might only happen once every... ever but there's only so much one can say about the joy of going to school. So here's something much more exciting: I saw three people this week! Yes, 3. Not one, not two, not four, but three. On the 31st Zoe came over to my house. This was because I rang her up the day before. We talked about what's been happening (it turns out that nothing much has been happening at all), Christmas presents (hers are significantly better), and stuff like that. I suffered the unfortunate experience of talking to her sister. Yet another reason why I like talking to people face to face. If Zoe's sister had come within a five meter radius of me I could've got a water gun, claimed that it was holy water, and hope that she'd show her true demonic self and disappear into a puff of smoke. If not that then at least I would be able to get her significantly wet, which in my opinion is just as good, if not better than making her return to the fiery hell from which she came. Anyway, Zoe came over the next day atop the great motorcycle. We headed straight for the bedroom. To be more specific, I headed straight for the laptop which was coincidentally in the bedroom and Zoe followed me. There we played fun games, such as Donkey Kong Country 3 for SNES. We played in team mode; I was Dixie, she was Kiddy. This was all possible because of my new Wingman Precision USB Game Controller. I played keyboard while Zoe used the controller. In the end she gave up because I was winning to much. Dixie just wouldn't die. I think she was disadvantaged from word go using Kiddy because... well... Kiddy sucks. Anyway, after that we headed down to the Fish and Chip Shop (closed) and the Deli, where I bought a pie and Zoe purchased Salt and Vinegar pringles AND Salt and Vinegar chips. After eating (and reading the back of the Pringles packet and trying to identify which countries the abbreviations stood for (eg, Ch was either China or Chechnya)) we headed back to the computer and played Super Smash Bros. for N64 (obviously). Zoe played the entire 1 player game with Kirby and unlocked Jigglypuff, who we didn't really want, but got anyway. Then we played two player games. She always went either Kirby of Yoshi. I always went either went Yoshi or (having guts) went someone totally random. I do believe that I won nearly every match (except for when I played Captain Falcon and one where we both went Yoshi). We were just in the middle of a great game of Yoshi vs. Kirby when Zoe had to leave.   Return of the King  Wowee! I saw Return of the King and it is the best movie in existence. There I was, sitting at home when there's a knock on the door. It's Brad and Brad. They show me the RotK tickets and I was sort of like...  Hmm... should I go? It might be long and boring. Oh well, I have nothing to do...  so I went. Let me now apologise for ever having second thoughts about going to the movie. It was honestly brilliant. Captivating. Very, very good. Let me set the scene in your mind. There are three on a journey. Hordes of hideous beasts march past, oblivious to the small trio journeying towards their destination. The road is long and treacherous. Already food and drink are dwindling in the crowded environment. The reason for them going is an item. So small, yet so powerful. Anyone would crave to get their hands on it... and it's power. After the journey is complete the item will be destroyed forever, gone for good.  They reached the end of the trial and the ticket man tore up my ticket. Then it was finally time to watch the movie.   120 minutes later  Wow. I love it! It's just so... wow. If you haven't seen it already, then what are you? Stupid? Go see it!

Since the photo is of Aragorn, I think it is time for another beautiful quote that he has said. It's the one that I love, and Tonya hatessss, so here it is:   Aragorn: Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.  Gandalf: How do we know Frodo is alive?

Okay! Love you all babes and Tonya (who is the coolest) and Haydy-Poo!  Love Morgan  P.S: I have decided that I will put quotes after everthing I write...first quote for the loud crowd is a message that Aragorn (he is so cool!) says to the men of Middle-Earth outside the Black Gates to lift their spirits for a battle that they can't win...A battle to give Frodo time...(on the Movie):   "A day may come when the courage of men fails. When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. This day we fight!"

I am VERY bored...I think I write that every time now...  Got some homework...don't want to do it but hey...  The two people next to me are busying doing "stuff". Jordan's (to my left) is writting an autobiography on some ball that hurt his foot and Amanda (to my right) is on typequick. Yes, the world has come to that depresrate stage were we, teenager on the present, are forced to do work...  I'm sore from dancing...  Looks like rain...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............*wakes up*  My quote for the day: "Something stirs in the East...A sleepless malice." said by the gorgeous elf, Legolas. A quote from Merry: " "Don't you understand?! The enemy thinks you have the Ring!" And Gandalf: "Run, Shadofax. Show us the meaning of haste." And Elrond: ""Take her by the safest road. A ship lays anchored in the Grey Havens; it waits to carry her across the Sea." And some elf call Figwit: "Lady Arwen, we cannot delay." And Arwen: "If I leave him now, I will regret it forever." AND Pippin:  "It's the tree! Gandalf! Gandalf!" AND the one and only Aragorn: "For Frodo  I think hte library is going to shut...hopefully that's enough quotes to make you sick for one day.

       I'm at school  I'm sitting in the library and I am sooooooooooooooooooooo bored. I just finished my Drama. I had to write something about a program so I did "The Mask of Zorro". You guys have to watch that! It is really cool!  Anyway...I'm at the top of my Chemistry Class (yay!) or should I saw that I'm sharing the top (*sad*). We're doing that worksheet that we got when Mr Smith was away (Advanced Chemisty). I've already done it cause, well, I did it last year.   I don't think I could say the same for Maths...I don't want to go into that.  I've got Drama next. The Drama teacher's okay and he talks to me...not sure if that's good or not but hey.  Media is A Grade BORING. We are doing BORING stuff.  In English we're reading the diary of Anne Frank...not bad but a bit depressing.  And last but not least...Geography...just don't get me started on that subject...(teacher treats females as dumb bum's but of course, that was before he met his match *evil giggles*)  Well, got to run to Drama because I'm nearly late...  ...I might catch the train home...  Anyway, I'll be talking alot because I have crap all to do here...BYE GUYS!!!  Wuv Morgan  P.S: My quote today is...not sure if I've done it so I will do two...okay!   "This is your test. Every path you have trod through wilderness through war has led to this road. The enemy will never let Aragorn come to the throne of Gondor.     AND   "It is time"   and it's time for me to go!

Let me sum it up...school, loner. there. Well I'm sure as hell you guys would of had a better week (dude I rock my Chemistry class!) Totally missing the people stated below:  Tonya, Rose, Lily, Hayden, Tonya, Brad C, Brad H, Tonya, Candy, Mike (so what), Tonya, David (not really), Paul (STOP SENDING ME SMS's WITH NO QUESTIONS LIKE "Hi, how was your day. I wish you'd come back and beat the crap out of David...etc), Tonya, Rose, Zoe (sort of...more than David but less than Mike), Tonya, Cody (YEAH RIGHT!),Bec B, Bec O, Shandi, Tonya, Tonya  (can you guess who I'm missing the most?)

       Year 11 makes you feel old  It's kind of depressing thinking that we as year 11 are getting older. All I have to say is that you guys in Esperance are so lucky because you get boss around year 8, 9 and 10. Me, I get to boss around any poor soul who peeves me off.  On a happier note, this song below is the was sung by Billy Crystal at the Oscars on March 1 (Australia time). You have to sing it to the tune of the sound of music. here goes...  Hobbits with feet big and hairy and smelly More horrific battles than Gest and Minelli  Ian and Viggo are Queen and some Kings this is the gang in the Lord of the Rings  Frodo and Sam on a mythical planet then Smeagol pops out like the right boob of Janet  Britney and JLo broke both of their flings They thought it was called "The Return of the Rings"  Lithium social pills and peyote Moonshine and brittan from Truman Capote JRR Tolkien was taking these things when he contrived the Lord of the Rings  Peter Jackson made it THREE though. He sure got it right. I loved every frame of The Lord of the Rings. So I downloaded it Last Night. All Night All Night Long!   bye!  (the song is my quote)

       Must...Update...Eventually...  Finally, I have gotten myself to update this stupid thing. School has just been going so fast that I havn't had time. Two weeks ago I was going to update. Then last Sunday. Then last Tuesday. WEll now I'm going to update no matter what! (evil laugh)  Hmm... Where to start... I guess the first day of school will be satisfactory. We met up in the usual spot outside the library. Every one was there, except for Morgan of course. Brad H had left the ordering of his books too long so he had the lightest bag. Jordan however had a bag weighing in at 11 kilos, and he had to carry... or should I say *drag* his bag with both arms. It was rather funny I must say. The siren went and we all trudged off to the quad. I'm starting to get the hang of the routine. Still, I followed Teagan and Candice around pretty closely. That way if I lost my form teacher I wouldn't be the only one who's lost. I got Ms. Taylor for form again. Still pissed off that I missed Mr. Hopkins. He's teaching F03 this year, just one away. Oh well, still one year left. We also kept the PAC room, but those little year 8's have kicked us off of our usual sitting spot, which is... very, very annoying. Now we have to sit on the wooden stage thingy over by the music rooms. Oh well, Candice and I are planning a series of run-to-form-to-get-the-good-seats attacks to reclaim our territory.    Chemistry       - Mr Smith  After the first form (and period one, wh00t!) I had Chemisty. Hawkins took the front desk like we planned, but because I bought my books and Cartledge was irrisponsible and didn't he was able to STEAL my seat while I was still zipping up my bag. The Chem book is too big IMHO. Why couldn't they just make seperate one's for year 11 and 12 and sell them cheaper? It would've been much better. Anyway, I'm right behind Hawkins, next to Paul and behind Pat W. Could be worse... (could be Gabe). WE've been learing all sorts of boring stuff all over again, like the essential differences in the arrangement of particles in solids, liquids and gases. Yeah, like we havn't learnt that before! I got 27/28 on the first assignment. It was the second top score, with Leiper and Hawkins both scoring lower than me. I think it was Rebecca who got the top score of 27.5, but I'm not 100% sure. In the mini test I did badly though. How the hell was I supposed to know what Sulphurous Acid was? I guessed... wrongly. I screwed up on Oxygen Peroxide and Cyanide, and I think I made a mistake forgetting to put a 3 on the end of my formula. In the end I got 44/48. Good thing that it only counted for a minute weighting. Oh well, that was like the only test that doesn't allow calculators. Next time I'll be ready for them.   G&T       - Mr. Litherland  I find it very coincidental that Mr Litherland is teaching G&T, the class that consists of 12 guys, don't you? Oh well, theories aside G&T is so far releativly easy. We've been doing stuff on right angled triangles, followed by SIN and COS rules, which my calculator has made a breeze. I just love it how the programs even show the correct working out ;). We then moved onto 3D shapes which I must admit was a little daunting. However it turned out to be fine. As long as the test isn't obsurdly hard *cough* (see Intro Calc) everything should be fine. We havn't had anything markable yet, so I don't know how much Leiper's beating me by, although I assume that it'll be very little. I'm convinced that this year I'll put up a good fight for dux. Anyway, we're stuck in the little stingy room 40 for this, which just sucks. The air conditioning is nonexistant, but he occasionally move on days when it is over 40 degrees to room 39, approx 10 degrees.   Intro Calc       - Mrs Boyland  Hehe, on the first day there was this little yr 8 kid who was in our class instead of room 40 something. he sat there for half the lesson while Mrs Boyland explained the differences between different types of number without even saying anything. Then she was going on about the importance of Graphics Calcs and he had the little tiny thing, probably not even scientific. You'd think he'd realise he was in the wrong class after seeing "YEAR 11 INTRODUCTORY CALCULUS" written on the top of the handout. Halfway through the lesson Mrs Boyland ask to see his timetable and Cartledge took him to the appropriate class. Oh my, it was funny. Anyway, same old classroom for Intro Calc, even if I had to move seats. With Morgan gone there was a huge population vacuum, so Paul and I jumped back a couple seats. I've got a good enough seat I guess. I'm in communication range with Hawkins, Cartledge, Jordan, Paul, Shelli P (and Matt Scoble who arrived a week late due to the Leeuwin). If I need to I mouth things to Rose, Kyla and Tonya, but I'm pretty content with my current seating. The work we've been doing? Easy stuff such as functions, sequences and gradients. The test however... Mr Durdan is EVIL I tell you. E-V-I-L! He amde all of those things so difficult. Given to us in a single period it was 4 A4 sheets long with every problem past the 1st page being extremely difficult. (Strangley enough, all of my errors were on the first page. I got everything else right.) Many people didn't even get time to finish the test. It was a shocking experience for all. I scored top of the class with 31/34, which was scaled up to 94%. Henriette and Leiper scored better than me though with 96% and 98% respectively.  That's enough talk about subjects for now. After all, I have to have something to guiltily draw me back into posting next Sunday. Damn, it's not even Sunday anymore. It's like 12:17am. Oh well, public holiday today :). Anyway, it would be a tragedy for me to post without at least telling you some stories of him. On the third day of school Mr. Boyland interupted the Physics class to speak with me. Next to him was this... abnormality dressed in a fluro green Hawaiian shirt (no joking!). He was the new kid I had to show around. Honestly, I didn't know whether to feel sick or to burst out laughing. He had the circumference on a small sun, and the gigantic shirt he bore was brighter than one. e was in EVERY ONE OF MY CLASSES (except for the Intro). I was told I'd have to show him around tomorrow, and to turn up at the office before form. So anyway, the following day Tonya practically dragged me to the office around 15 minutes before I was meant to be there. Mr. Boyland practically accused Tonya of having a crush on him, and I went along with it because I was a) grumpy I had to show him around, b) right about being to early and c) no seriously,  really really grumpy . He was already being referred to as "Hayden's Best Friend". Anyway, Tonya then refused to return to the office so Cartledge vouched to go. We walked into the office, and we saw Gabe sitting on the closest 3 seats. Then Cartledge turned around and sprinted just as Gabe spotted me. I then had to show him around the room as he kept saying "Top Stuff" to me. Anyway, the siren went after about a lifetime or two and I escaped to form, followed by Intro Calc (the best 150 minutes of the day). And what he said in class? Well, you'll just have to wait until next week.   Coming Up  - Physics, Geography and English Lit - Clubs - Henriette - Gabe's English Room Story Evaluation - Another Paragraph Entitled  Coming Up   P.S. Morgan, I deleted one of your posts. You must've clicked the button twice because there's two of them. And of course no one else has posted. Only you, me and Tonya know about the site. I've still gotta find a way to let everyone else find out. Also, could either you or Tonya post about this weekend's not-happening trip to Perth? Someone has to post it, but I don't know what happened. Your story will be much better. Thanks.

       And it wasn't that 'Babe'  I assume you mean bad. Geography was good I guess. I hesitated for a second when I had to write a definition of eutrophication. Fortunately my brain kicked in and remembered it from year 9. There was an extended answer on how humans make an impact on the water cycle, which I forgot to do diagrams for. D'oh! After that was G&T, which I found very easy. I know I got one question wrong though. I didn't notice that the race had already been going for like 10 minutes, so my time for when the yachts passed closest was off by like 10 minutes. It was only worth one mark, but the whole thing was only like out 15, so percentage wise it's a bit annoying.   Finally, Intro Calc. Damn that thing was harder than I expected. I finished it though, and after school Mrs Boyland came up to us with the things all marked. I got 100% (yay!). Cartledge got the very first question wrong and lost a mark. I feel good after him mocking me for getting half a mark wrong on the Chem assignment. Ha! Jordan got 17 I think, Hawkins got 16. When Jordan got his score Hawkins looked at him evilly and said "I hate you..." It was funny. I'm amazed at the speed of Mrs Boyland's marking though. Mr Durdan walked past with a shocked look on his face. I wonder when he'll finish marking the other classes EPW's.

       For all those who can't wait to pick out the mistakes  Here they are, some of the numerous amount of mistakes from Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  Continuity: Spoiler: In the scene of Theoden's death, a black line appears and disappears between shots on the right side of Eowyn's forehead, over her eyebrow.   Revealing mistakes: Near the beginning of the film as the camera flies towards Rohan you can see the smoke pouring back into the chimneys rather than out of them.   Continuity: When Sam first picks up Frodo, Frodo's head is on Sam's left shoulder, but in the next shot Frodo's head is on Sam's right shoulder.   Continuity: Nearing the end of the film where we see Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry having a drink at the Green Dragon, Frodo places four mugs on the table. The first sequence has two green mugs on the right and two brown mugs on the left. The second shot shows the mugs with a brown and green mug on each side of the table.   Continuity: When Sam is holding Frodo on his lap during the climb up Mt. Doom, the wound on Frodo's face has moved from his right cheek to his left. The footage for the entire scene has been flipped.   Continuity: When Sam and Frodo are climbing Mt. Doom, Sam's sword switches from his left side to his right.   Continuity: When Sam cuts Shelob's silk from around Frodo's face, it is completely cleared of silk in the close-up shots but remains covered with silk from the nose down in the long shots.   Continuity: When Frodo and Sam are on the rock at the foot of the exploding Mount Doom, there is a shot of Frodo's left hand where the hand is completely clean and the finger is still there.   Revealing mistakes: In a quick shot of Gandalf holding Pippin while riding Shadowfax in front of the Black Gate you can see Billy Boyd's double's face.   Continuity: When Aragorn is running back to join his fellow men, when the black gate is open, we can see the CGI flag of the rider that goes with him is going from left to right, but in the next shot, the wind is in the opposite direction.   Continuity: During the fight with Shelob, Sam is holding Frodo's sword which switches between Sam's right and left hand in between shots at least once.   Continuity: While Smeagol and Deagol are fighting over the Ring, Deagol loses his grip on it and the Ring goes flying. Deagol finds it and picks it up off the grass with his right hand. After Smeagol has killed him, he takes the Ring out of his left hand. There was no indication that the Ring had switched hands.   Continuity: When Arwen is reading the book after she sees the vision, there is a picture on the right-hand page. When she drops the book there is no picture there.   Continuity: When Aragorn's party rides to the Black Gate, Eomer is shown as riding with them (he can be identified by the white plume on his helmet). When they reach the gate, Eomer is missing from most of the wide shots, although he's shown in at least one close-up.   Continuity: When Frodo finishes writing the book, he reaches for the stab wound on his shoulder with the writing quill in hand. Then Sam walks in and in the next shot, Frodo's hand is still by his shoulder, but the quill is gone.   Continuity: While Denethor is eating in the citadel hall and is asking Pippen if he knows how to sing, he has a smear of red wine/sauce/blood on his chin. In a subsequent shot, Denethor turns to the camera and the smear is gone. It then reappears as he looks back to Pippin.   Continuity: When Gandalf is speaking with "the steward" the end of his cloak alternates between clean and mud soaked.   Continuity: After the battle at Minas Tirith the clasp holding Pippin's cape together changes direction between shots.   Continuity: When Pippin finds Merry after the battle his leaf-brooch is pointing to the left, in the following shot is pointing to the right.   Revealing mistakes: When the black ships have landed, Legolas shoots twice with his bow - The digitally animated arrows appear and disappear several times.   Continuity: When Sam stabs Shelob in the eye with Sting, the blade is covered with blood, but when it is knocked out of his hand in the next shot, it's perfectly clean.   Continuity: The elf standing behind Elrond, Galadriel and Celeborn at the Grey Havens changes position several times between shots.   Continuity: When Frodo first sees Shelob, he falls backwards to the ground. As he lands a boot can be seen behind him. We see a quick shot of Shelob, then cut back to Frodo and the boot has now disappeared.   Continuity: When the Army of the Dead enters Minas Tirith, one of the battlements on the city's outer wall (near the bottom of the frame) changes its shape and position, losing a portion of its tower.   Continuity: When Aragorn and Gandalf are talking about Frodo and marching on the Black Gate in the throne room of Minas Tirith, Gandalf's hair changes from mostly behind his ears to mostly in front at one point.   Continuity: Gollum sprinkles crumbs of the Lembas bread on Sam to incriminate him. When Sam gets up, the crumbs are gone. Then, they reappear when Gollum points them out.   Continuity: After defeating Shelob, Sam runs to Frodo. He lays Sting down next to him, on an area of dirt with a couple rocks sticking up. But later, when we see Sting glow blue, it's on perfectly level dirt ground.   Continuity: When Sam stabs the Orc with Sting, you can see blood on both the Orc and the sword. After he pulls it out, there is no blood.   Revealing mistakes: When Frodo boards the ship the Grey havens harbor and turns for his last smile, you can see the boarding rail is actually a bungee cord

       It's your turn to be a contestant on the Price is Right!  Fine, it may not be The Price is Right but this is still a damn good website. Teagan hasn't checked her emails yet (or so she tells me) so she isn't a member yet. But dear Hera is. Here's some of the conversation for all you people who wanna know how it really went down.  Hayden: do you want me to make you an account so you can post there too? Hera: no thanks Hayden: are you sure? Hera: yeah Hayden: it's easy Hera: no really thanks anyways Hayden: i really want to make an account for you Hayden: (its already half done) Hera: noooooooooooo Hera: im a boring person Hayden: you dont have to post Hayden: it just might come in handy one day Hera: ok ok  In other news Christy is now renting a house in Glendalough. It's like $200 a week. I'm still secretly hoping she buys a house in or around Cannington.

       Here we go... again  Amazing. I don't post in something like 2 months, and here I am posting twice in two days. I never thought I'd see the day.  I'm in the process of inviting Teagan to join the website. I don't know why though... I don't want everyone to find out about the website because no one will bother posting. If I just invite some people then maybe we can get a little community going and get everyone interested first.  My sister's moving to Perth. Christy is in the process of selling the house in Grenough. Her, Dan, Allira and Isabella will temporarily be staying in Cannington (yes Morgan, I know how close they are to you) but plan to move to Leederville. I frankly don't approve. I think that Cannington is a perfect spot to stay. It's close to Curtin Uni and Morgan's house (well a lot closer than Leederville!), which means there's always the possibility of moving in with them when I go up to Perth, at least until I find a place of my own.  I was attacked with sillystring downtown today. Long story...  Speaking of stories, Mr Sharpe was telling us another educational story.   "There was this guy I knew in year 10 who was a few tim tams short of a pack. Anyway, this guy was starting to get interested in girls, but they wanted nothing to do with him. So this guy went downt he road to the house of this kid named Joe Vernon. Joe Vernon is now a dentist, so if you ever go to the dentist and he's there then leave because he's the cruelest man you could possibly imagine. Anyway, he told this guy thart the only way to make girls attracted to you is to make faces at them. So this poor kid went running up to all the girls he could see and made faces at them. *insert Mr Sharpe stupid making faces noises* The girls of course screamed and ran away from him. Poor guy. He kept making faces at them. He was a full-on Ed Support kid."

       Ta-da!  I'm back from the non-posting place where I was (I call it school!). No Morgan, exams are not good. I havn't even started studying yet. Oh well, I guess I can do it the night before.  In English Lit we are ringing King Oedipus. It's a really messed up story. The run down: king and queen have a baby who is destined to kill his father and marry his mother. The king and queen are so afraid they send the baby away. He grows up, gets in a fight with his father (who he doesn't know) and kills him, the returns to the city of his birth (which he doesn't know). They're lacking a king and he answers a riddle, so he becomes king and marries his own mum. Disturbing.  My Restaurant Rules is sooo cool right now. Ash and Amanda rock! They won against Sydney. They beat Brisbane. Now it's them vs everyone else. I've been talking to Ash via the internet (my friend, the net). I've asked him to send down some flyers so I can hand them out around town. I'll get Candice to come with me (she's already agreed) and I'll work my way up from there. I also mentioned that I really like Room Nineteen's hats (hint, hint). I hope Ash reads his messages tonight so he can send them tomorrow, delivered overnight, here Thursday, delivered Thursday and Friday afternoon.  (I like new makeover on www.blogger.com. Very nifty)

      Were you that bored that you had to resort to finding us on google Hayden? Oh, by the way, we're on page 10 last time I looked.  Oh my god! I am so fucking bored. *deep breathe in, complains all and once* I’m in media and the teacher is sick and I can’t do my work because he’s got the music that I need so that means I will be sitting here for 2 hours without anything to do and I’m sooooooo fucking bored it’s not funny because I’ve run out of sites to look at and *inhales* I AM SO BORED!   Oh! But I did win a prize in a quiz we had at the school. I was one of 12. Oh so exciting. Don't know what I won but I'm sure it will be good and if not...I still won something.  Oh my fucking boredom, I'm bored...  I know! I'll talk to myself.  lalala!  You'll all be proud that I had a civilised conversation with David. *shocking*...And at the end of this working week, I find out if I got a job...coming first in my Drama class. Not hard considering there is only like *starts counting* 3 of us that ever turn up, 5 in total, 7 that sat the exam...Tonya, he's not here today so didn't have to avoid him :) that made my life easy...Gollum's (Andy Serkis) wife went into labour, so there is going to be a lil gollum very soon (the third little Gollum might I add)...  I'm going to add in a picture cause I felt like it...lets see *scans internet sites* this ones good.    urlLink    Lord of the Rings: The Return of the king   Here is me, playing my LOTR:ROTK game. I'm Gandalf, kicking the little Orcs butt. And I call it an orc because this is the third level on the path of the wizard and I'm on top of Minas Tirth wall and Nazgul are stealing my men so I can't shoot the capapult and then I'm screwed but then Linds and I were playing co-op level and we killed the Nazgul and OMG it was so funny, we like...shoot it! and we both did and we killed it...I could never do that in single mode...you don't have to kill them which is strange because I really think there is a reason for them in the game apart from blocking my road once dead, eating my men when they're alive and scaring the shit out of me every time I play!   Ha! Screw you all! I got the picture in all by myself! HAHA! Sorry, very proud of myself...  Another pic...   urlLink     I see you too but you don't here me bragging about it!

The two options were either School of Rock or Looney Tunes. In the morning it was pretty much average.

It was a pity not to see the wolves chasing the little people then getting frozen, but you can't have everything I guess. Harry Potter, also very good (but very packed).

       BIG MOUTH   Well looks like I've really done it this time. I've gone and said something I shouldn't have and now Tonya (and friends) are pissed off at me.  Well I'd just like to say no one told me it was a big secret. No one told me that this was to stay behind closed doors. No one told me it was on a need to know basis.  Yes, I did not think before I spoke, but come on! This was like 20 minutes after I had found out. I never expected anything like this to occur. Even then I was still in doubt. I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, but it's over now.  Anyway, I've learnt my lesson. Ash asked me about it twice (once joking, then later seriously) and I didn't tell her either time. I'm like a pet: at first I piddle on the carpet but if you just give me a chance I'll learn to use the kitty-litter tray.  What's done is done, let's just hope we can move on from here.  (Chem test was crap, 92% for Thursday's Intro Calc test bringing overall to 91.6%)

Otherwise, you'll have to find out from everyone else. I never saw this coming.  In other news, I'm too tired to do anything tonight. I tried to do my physics report, I honestly did, but I'm so tired I think I give up. I'll just hand it in Monday. I have to study for the Chem test yet. I don't know how I'll survive exams. Nah, no need to worry. I'll rest in the day between them. Hehe. This weekend I'll still have to do my English Lit essay and Physics report. Oh... yay... ZzZzZz  5 Sleeps Until Exams

      I am so bored. Once again, my boring life tale comes from school. An update of my life  1) Finished exams: So far 77.5/100 in Geography (82% overall semster) and 66% in Maths...I'm happy  2) Getting crap from people who claim to be friends because I'm going to the movies with Joel and some of his friends. No he is not my fucking boyfriend nor will he be my fucking boyfriend because I've been doing fine without one. Going to see Harry Potter so don't give a crap.  3) Everyone with a neopets account has to vote for my ixi legoIas_GreenIeaf (han_mathon_ne_chae account)  4) Life is treating me crap.  5) Nice to know that when one of you come to Perth I've got to drop everything so I can see you. Not going to happen.  That's my whinge of the week. Come back next time for "What is screwing with my mind!" hosted by me.  My final words are a quote of a radio ad in Esperance that is always played on Friday's.  "Friday's just another day"

       Another Assignment  Good to see everyone posting. Right now its 1:13 am and I'm all alone. Everyone else has toddled off to bed after complaining about the English Lit Tutorial. We each have different topics so we can't help each other without full-on stopping ours, learning the others persons topic and starting from scratch. Trust me, it isn't easy. I think I've got one of the easier topics (and to think I picked it cause it was the one left over!). I'm finished the introduction, the 2nd and the 3rd body paragraphs, and it already goes for 8 minutes. It has to be 9 minimum. All I have to do is finish up the first body paragraph, whack on a conclusion and I'm done. I'm considering adding a fourth body paragraph... Depends how I'm doing for time I guess (meant in both ways. Time as in how late it is, time as in how long it will take to say tomorrow).  Good luck

       Just In Time For School  Attention all people who read this and are in English Lit (Tonya, Hera, Teagan: this means  you! ). ABC will be airing Pride and Prejudice over the next month and a half. This could turn out very beneficial for those of us who fall asleep reading the book, and for those of you who actaully like the story: you get to see it on tv! It starts Sunday, August 1. Watch it.   urlLink http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/highlights/s1153108.htm     "Gorgeously filmed, wonderfully acted, beautifully costumed and staged, smartlyedited and extremely amusing – Andrew Davies’ multi-award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic Regency romance is one of the most definitive and successful TV period dramas ever.    Returning to ABC TV on Sunday, August 1st at 8.30pm over six exhilarating episodes, Pride and Prejudice pulsates with energy as lively, witty Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) charms smouldering, haughty Mr Darcy (Colin Frith) against a backdrop of picture-postcard countryside, small-town assembly rooms and English stately homes.  Every single performance sparkles, the sets and locations are beautiful, the music keeps perfect pace with the action, and the sexual tension between the leads keeps viewers glued to their TV sets.  Pride and Prejudice is a television masterpiece that has to be simply enjoyed, if not surrendered to. You won’t want to miss a moment. Lavish and piquant as a TV series should be, Pride and Prejudice never misses a note of Austen’s arch comic tone.  Colin Firth plays Mr Darcy superbly – all haughty and unapproachable but only just hiding his vulnerability. Jennifer Ehle is a fascinating Elizabeth as the sexual tension between her and Darcy turns white hot!  ABC TV has long been the home of period drama and with Pride and Prejudice it has the best of them all."

       We've Been Discovered  It turns out our little private blog isn't so private any more. "Shayne Power" left a comment on one of Morgan's post, to our surprise. A little research (eg, the phone book) revealed that he lives not too far away. So if you want, drop around to his blog  urlLink View from the POWERstation . On a side note Hawkins has also been dropping around and reading posts. I guess I better make him a member, lol. So here's to being discovered.

       ...And Car and Gun and Spotlight...  Hehe, shooting was fun last night. We left at 9:30 (right when the final of Alias was about to start. Hope the VCR worked). Bevan, Travis, Mandy (not  the  Mandy) and myself went out last night. There were heaps of them, and a couple foxes. The first one we (meaning they) tried to shoot was a really energestic one. He was jumping all over the place. In the end Bevan (driving/shooting) passed the gun to Travis (holding spotlight) so they could try and get the roo on the move. It was like on of those highspeed chase cop shows you see on tv. However, Travis missed too and the kangaroo jumped right over the fence.   On a side note, we were listening to ABC radio and there was this quiz thing on. The 23rd question was "What is the most poisonous fish in the world, with spikes that become erect?" I guessed Stonefish right away. Some idiot rang up and guessed Box Jellyfish. Do Jellyfish have erect spines? No, duh! I was right, woohoo. (Note, out of 25 questions this was the only one I thought of an answer for.)  We got like 5 kangaroos that night. One of them dropped its joey and Travis went out and picked it up. It was sooo cute! So I said "It's sooo cute!". He brought it over for me to hawve a closer look. It has big dark brown eyes and cute little paws. I patted it on the head. Then Travis gently lifted it out of the window and bashed its head against the ute and it died instantly.  It's been raining today so I've had lunch onwards off. There's nothing much really to be done, so there's no use getting even wetter. We had to move a couple sows close to giving birth, and move some stys and fill them with hay. Stys are actually rather clean, by the way.  Travis fell over in the mud... twice... Hehehe  Damn karma. I had to shut one of the gates but couldn't. He ground was turning into liquid under my feet. Not matter how hard I pushed the metal post didn't go forwards; I just went backwards. The gates by the way are nots swinging shut gates, more like metal pole with wite a wire fence attached, and you have to pull the metal pole over, tensing up the fence wire stuff, and hook a wire loop attached to the pole onto the post thats part of the fence. Getting it off is easy. Getting it back on when you have no friction with the ground is slightly more difficult.  Something happened yesterday that I was going to write about, but I've totally forgotten it.  I don't like the ute. Two seats, three people. Hmm... Go figure. I prefer the station wagon. At least it's not cramped.  Another bad thing about rain: the mud. My boots accumulated about 5 cm of slippery mud. Even walking on normal non-muddy ground resulted in me sliding.  Brr... it's cold. I had pancakes for lunch. Yummy!  Hey Morgan, what's brought around this anger towards trend setting. Can't wait to hear from you. As for everyone else who knows about this website, come read and post! I know it's pointless saying that if you don't check it. Oh well.  This is Hayden signing off.  (There's nothing like being isolated for making big blog posts)

       Where the hell does it all come from?  What is with it? I mean, no matter where you go there is always the latest craze hanging over your head. For example, "meh", a monosyllabic word giving the indication of "Oh well". And also "My bad". What moron came up with that. Sure it was your fault but the world doesn't have to know. Anyway, I've had my whinge for the day, come back tomorrow for "OMG! What the-" starring ME!  (no quote, don't feel like it)

       Oh the Joy  Congrats on the job Morgan. I'm busy doing some work of my own. I'm writing to you all the way from Salmon Gums. I kinda left my work experience thingo to the last minute, and ended up not being able to find anywhere to go. So I decided to come up to the farm. Stupid work experience. I'd rather go to school than attend a week of work for free.  I shouldn't be complaining. It has been all that bad. There are a number of very good things about this week. Firstly, the food. Mum spent like the entire weekend cooking food to take up here. Secondly, driving is fun, weehee! I was allowed to drive the station wagon around (and for the record I did not crash, stall or do anything else bad to it. I even changed the gears. I feel so special! ^_^). Thirdly, is ISDN!! Kylie has ISDN which is internet at 128k. Last night I was downloading files at a whopping 15 KB/s. I was able to download some things I've been meaning to get in 3 minutes (they were ofcourse not illegal music files, that's just naughty...)  Badt things... hmmm... gate opening. I'm sorry, but I jsut can't stand it. It's so tedious going in and out of the car. Oh yeah, and the sows are all muddy. But the piglets are cute, so that makes up for it. Today there were three piglets that had been attacked by another sow.  Let me tell you one things: it gets bloody cold in a vehicle when there are no windows, no roof and doors. Yes, I am talking aobut the tractor. you would not believe you cold I got riding on the tractor feeding the pigs. It's a pity I left my jacket at the house when having lunch.  Ooh, I just remembered another good thing. As well as the standawrd lunch breaks we also stopped twice to go down the the roadhouse and get ice coffees, etc. Hurray.  As I am typing this Adelle is jumping on me playing "The Hickory Dickory Dock Game" on the ABC Kids site. This Blogger window has been resized so I can just see what words I'm typing and Adelle doesn't notice it. She's bloody good at computers and stuff. She knows how to navigate and use the entire ABC Kids site, even the jigsaw puzzles.  I'm tired. I had to wake up early. Meh. I stayed up till midnight playing with the ISDN, and still managed to wake up at like 7. Hell, I doubt I could do that at home even if I wqent to sleep at 7am the previous morning.  Uh oh, I have to go now. Adelles sticking in a Finding Nemo CD, and it's gonna play full screen. Seeya, I'll try and post tomorrow.  P.S. We went "Shoo Rooting" last night. It was rather uneventful. They only saw one fox, and they didn't even hit it.  Oh, by the way I have some photos to post on here as soon as I get home. They are my tips to room cleaning. Yes, I managed to clean my entire room... in a way.  Catchya later.

      I swear, if for every time I said (or whinged) that I was bore, I got $1, I would be a fucking millionaire (or however the hell you spell it).   I'm tried because I went to a sleepover on the weekend...got to bed at 1:00am and then woke up and 7:30am...zzzzzzzzzzz...*wakes up* what? Oh yeah. We watched "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Underworld" (of which got a teddy thrown at the TV twice care of me because the scientific data was wrong and the ending), "Big Fish" and nearly all of "Welcome to the Jungle"...anyway, overall good night.  Update on work status: I am currently an employee of two companies now. Woolworths (zzz)and HOYTS! (YAYAYAYAYAYAY!). As you can tell, very happy that I got the Hoyts postition. I sat down for 5 hours on Saturday for Woolworths training and another 3 hours tonight...get paid $6.50 (approx) an hour. Hoyts on the other hand, I will get $10.something an hour. So yes, if they clash, I know which one I will be sticking with.  Haven't got a boyfriend...which is such a shame (not)  Got one more level on LOTR to complete before I can play with the secret characters (one of which is Faramir)  Got Drama performance night this Wednesday, followed by a Chem test on Thrusday, followed by my sister's birthday and dancing concert on Friday, followed by Hoyts training on Saturday...and I won't be tried (who the hell am I kidding. I'll have to learn to sleep with my eyes open)  I think I'm getting a cold...*cough cough* I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE SICK!  Anyway, better do some work hey. I'm media and bored out of my mind, but wait! this is what I was talking about in the first place.  Anyway, love ya all (though sometimes one or more of you need a kick up the bum).  BYE!

      I am ashamed of you Hayden! You of all people should know what it's liked to be picked on. Since when did you become the "Oh so mighty" and know what everyone thinks! "We"? "We" is a term used to summarise EVERYONE and EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN OPINION!  I think the punch wasn't deserved! What f***ing right do you have to do that to a person! I'm so f***ing p***ed at you Hayden! You've stooped down to a level that I thought you'd never go to!  You're not a popular person Hayden, f***, not even I'm a popular person in "the group" (yes, still claim you guys as mine but only just) but nobody f*** punched me. Sure I was called names and sh*t but nobody deserves that.   You are a pompous prick!  I hate to say it but you are. It's not just you, it's all the guys in "the group". Just just build a f***ing bridge and get over it! Grow up! Get a life! Learn what is it to have fun AWAY from a computer.  I'm going to get negative replies to this but I don't care. Each person is entitled to their own opinion and this is mine.  I say this on behalf of me. Nobody else. If you get angry, it is at me but you do not offend, hit or threaten ANY of my friends or you'll be asking for it...not because you hit him (which is f***ing wrong!) but you pushed the wrong buttons so prepare to get pushed back.  (P.S: Wow! I must be mad! Look how many f*** words there are...)

       You know the Type I'm Talking About  I'm in a shitty mood, mostly because of Matt Hartwig. For all of those not in the know, we hate him. We all hate him. We meaning the group, all meaning everyone except possibly Tonya and Henri, and him meaning Matt. You'd think after being  punched  and being told  "F*** off, nobody likes you!"  you'd get the slightest feeling that you're not the most popular person. It kind of worked. He stopped walkin home with us, but get this: he still hangs out with us every morning! And now, today, he walked home with us!!! I can not stand it. Anyway, after he turned around and started walking back towards the high school I waited until he wouldn't be able to hear me then I made my opinion about him increasingly vocal. Tonya said, "He's behind us..." to which I thought to myself, "Duh. If he were with us then I wouldn't be talking about him." It was only when I turned around that I realised he was  very  behind us. As in three metres. I thought he'd continued walking away, but obviously he'd turned back again and caught up with us. The worst part is I don't really feel bad about it, I was actually half in shock / half in hysteria when I saw him. And now... I just hope he'll go away.  Then to finish off the perfect day, I get this SMS from Lily's phone at 8:53:49 saying:  "I love you write back"  Now look, she's a good friend and all, but... that was the alst thing I ever expected (let alone wanted) to find on my phone. Then to top it off I ran out of credit when I was just in the middle of explaining a whole lot of stuff to her. So I had to get Matt Larner to SMS her and tell her that I'm out credit. Five minutes I got a reply saying it was her sister saying all that stuff. I don't know whether it's true or not, but either way I'm going to live like it never happened. That's one door I want to stay closed.

       Yippee!  After money long, long, loooong days my laptop is fixed. I have been on a downloading frenzy, clocking up about 200 MB of downloads in 2 nights. The hard drive broke, and I had to get a new one so I have to re-download all of my stuff which I didn't bother backing up (which constituted pretty much  everything  I downloaded).  I borrowed David's collection of "Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040" episodes and watched all 26 non-stop. It was fun, but I don't think I'll be doing it again. Instead, I want to watch all 26 episodes of "Fruits Basket" (yes, that is how you spell it) non-stop. Fruits Basket is:  "A charming and touching comedy/drama that tells the story of a young girl, Tohru Honda and her friendships with the Sohma family. The Sohma's are a wealthy family with a dark secret; a curse that causes the young members to change into the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac when hugged by a member of the opposite sex." (or so say the note on my download)  So far I've downloaded 17.5 MB of Fruits Basket... out of 5.88 GB (yes, GIGAbytes). The estimated time remaining is 22 days, and that's non-stop computer downloading, constant phone line use, etc. This may take a while. Hopefully I can get it to focus its downloading on the first episode, then the second, etc because the download is all 26 episodes combined in a folder, not 26 seperate ones as you would think.  At school today we had to fill in some forms with a 2B pencil, then sign it. For the record, I  am  an Australian citizen, I  am not  an overseas student on a visa thingy, I  am not  of Aboriginal or Torres Straight Islander descent, and all of the above details  are  correct.  Lily's back from France. She's been showing everyone photos, and posters, and her phone, and what not. I had a big SMS convo with her on... Thursday? night which left me with less than $2 credit on my phone.  Did I mention I've missed my laptop?  Hawkin's had hish birthday party yesterday. I got him a 'birthday' card that said "Get Well Soon" and inside I wrote "Happy 15th Birthday". And his present was an elegantly wrapped set of  FIVE CHARRED TOOTHPICKS  (and fifteen bucks). He was over the moon. Paul got him this gay little car with L plates on it, then proceeded to play with the car for 5 minutes while we all looked at him. His birthday card for Hawkins had a picture of a dog on the front and it said "You are BIGGER than ANYTHING." I pointed out how wrong that sounded coming from Paul of all people. Paul was also the only person invited who did not give Hawkins $15, instead giving him $10. Jordan nearly showed up late to the party so he could do his homework. Cartledge was there too.  As of now I've downloaded 0.2% of Fruits Basket - Dual Audio Dvd Rip. (The Dual Audio cool! When you play it you can choose between the original Japanese audio and the dubbed English audio. There's also subtitles available, so if you wanted you could put it on in Japanese, turn on the subtitles, and watch the original! People have said though that the quality of the dubbing is excellent, with great voice actors who really work well together. And the DVD Rip, that just means they got it from the Fruits Basket DVD's as opposed to say a TV Rip.)  Intro Calc test this week I think, and it's one of Mr Durdan's ones (eg, 50% of the class will FAIL it...) English Lit inclass essay was to be this Friday, but was postponed until next Friday because Ms Merrey's not going to be there, so it's rather convenient to have something easy set up.  Shelli had a hangover on Monday. She had to leave during Drama because she was so sick. Today Mr Sharpe asked what night "the poisoning" occured. Now she's trying to figure out who told him that she had a hangover. Frankly he could've heard it from anywhere. He probably knew before Geography (period 8) anyway. I won't say Shelli's last name in case someone does a Google search on her in 5 years time and the only thing that comes up is the hangover she got in 2004, though I'm not particularly worried as it isn't exactly a big secret.  I have not done any work in Physics for two days now, due to the phenomenon of Relief Teachers. Not that I do enourmous amounts of work in Physics anyway. In G&T I actually did some work today, but that was only cause another class had to use our room, so we went into Room 1, where the tables are (still) in groups of 3 along the right hand side. Jordan, Hawkins and Cartledge sat down together and I was all alone, and therefore could not pawn answers off of Hawkins. However, I ended up in front of all of them (except Jordan, who always does his homework plus an extra 5 to 10 questions) and they were asking me for help, so ha!  On the day before exams my calculator broke (smashed screen, totally shattered, of absolutley no use or value, and no warranty coverage). So I sent it back and they gave me another one! The little post-it said "Replaced: Faulty". And on the piece of paper attached to the post-it it said "Remember, your warrantly  DOES NOT COVER BROKEN SCREENS . Someone supernatural deity must like me. But my new HP 39G+ is different to everyone elses. It has an orange shift button, which is REALLY crappy because they also wrote what happens when you use shift on a button (eg, the pi above the number 3) in orange too, and you cannot read it at all. Stupid, stupid designers.  Night everyone.
