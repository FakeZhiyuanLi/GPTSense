      Hello there, my dear Students!  I was thinking about our classes and I thought it would be a nice idea to have a blog so we could use it to start or continue the discussions we may have in class.  I think it is a wonderful resource for sharing ideas, and, what the heck, that's what we'll be doing throughout the semester! I thought we might use this to post something interesting, such as a text, an article, or maybe just a picture. Plus, we can use it to talk about our class, taking notes of the things we have learned (nem vocabulary, expressions) or a grammar revision. Anyway, I hope we can make this part of our lessons as well!  This is the picture I took of you! You all look really nice, so don't worry about it!  Cheers,  Rick  urlLink     urlLink

      Hello there, dear Students!  As I've told you, we could have a blog this semester so you can exchange ideas and keep track of our classes. Topics may vary, but it would be interesting if we used it to write down the nice and not so nice things that happened in our classes. What do you think?  This is the first picture I took of you a couple of weeks ago. Of course not all of you are present, as many of you only decided to show up three classes after the semester had started. Don't worry! I'll most definitely take the camera to class again and take more pictures of you!  Hope to see you all posting and writing comments.  Cheers,  Rick  urlLink     urlLink

      I know I've talked to all of you about it, but few people have actually been to the website. There you go, a link to one exercise which deals with word formation. Check it out!!   urlLink http://www.flo-joe.co.uk/fce/students/wordbank/wform.htm

      Hello my dear FCE students!  This is our blog. I think it is a nice place for you to practice writing and reading in English, plus exchanging tips and websites that deal with the exam!  If you're not in this first picture, don't worry! I'll make sure to take the cameara again and take a picture of the whole class!!  Hope you make the best of this space!  Cheers,  Rick  urlLink     urlLink

       Hello there, my dear students!  This is the first post of our blog! I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you all and say that I really hope you make use of this as a means of practicing your English, gossip (of course), talk about movies, upcoming events, and, last but definitely not least, our classes (things you've learned, things you liked, things you hated, etc). I guess this is pretty much it!  This is the photo I took in our first class, if I'm not mistaken. If you're not here, don't worry! We may take more pictures throughout the semester...  Cheers, you guys!!  Rick  urlLink     urlLink
