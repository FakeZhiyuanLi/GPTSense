       Yes Im also going to post games that I find on a day to day basis. I'm leaving them separate to the normal "sites" post because I've simply got a lot of them. The "sites" post however is still postponed.    This games difficultly setting is said to be higher than a hippie in an airplane....I agree.     urlLink http://www2.abc.net.au/fly/flysui/flysui.html      Ahh the curve ball this game never gets old.  urlLink http://rebarb.homeip.net:8081/flashgames/curveball.html   Perfect parking...Nice one bruda.  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pparkgame.html   Paper throw 1. It has cool little nintendoesque tunes aswell as being completely useless  urlLink http://www.sticky.tv/game/cyrkam_airtos/   Paper throw 2.This is in the bbc learning section?! And its promoting the show "the office" which is pretty good.  urlLink http://game.panlogic.net/   Prince of Persia. One of my childhood favourites. Not exactly the same but it'll do.  urlLink http://www.gamespot.com/promos/princeofpersia-game/flash/index.html    A simple but fiendishly addictive game. Build your Tower with high numbers at the bottom and small numbers at the top. Dont let the Vikings win  urlLink http://www.gamerival.com/index.cfm?Play=C8496A22&amp;fromint=1   Table tennis. Great game , you can do spins quite effectively and smashes.  urlLink http://www.miniclip.com/tabletennis.htm   Zookeeper is like a lot of other puzzle games, But its cute so im putting it in.  urlLink http://www.bobpitch.com/zookeeper/zk.html   I thinks this is a port from Sonic Advance 2 well the graphics are the same so to the manerisms of the characters but the levels are different. Its not as fluid either. Kinda cool i guess.  urlLink http://www.flashplayer.com/games/ultimateflashsonic.html

      10. The overbearing fabrication on every aspect of the channel 9. Adds on average are longer than any other commercial channel and are more frequent. 8. The way they regard Australian competitors as the rest of the nation when medals in the Olympics are scored or when commenting on performance. 7. The "playing it straight program" involving some chick looking for a partner in a group of 5 men. But wait, ones gay and we have to work out who. 6. Changing Mums. Some ridiculous show about mums switching houses, don't know were this one will go. 5. Home and Away. The lesser of the two major Australian soaps. Oh the pain 4. Se7ens vision to win viewers by shipping new news readers from other networks and then claiming "everyone's making the change" 3. The news is blatantly crap. 2. They hire that annoying lady from hot auctions to be the sport compare. And hot auctions Sheesh 1. I never watched it before anyway. I mean what a load of shit.

                 After the previous bombout of the first edition of sonic launching out on to the handheld, The second one, although old now and hard to find is definitely "a sonic like they should and used to be". What the game is themed on primarily this time, (different from the previous style of a Mario copy) is speed based mayhem which is much more traditonaly sonic like. From the start where the character gets on the starting blocks for a "race" to the end where bonus points are added according to how fast you were going across the finish line. Even the bosses are speed based, with robotnics car thingy continuosly running away from you, with you having to catch up and bounce him. The annoying pop up spikes at the end of every glorious run heavily featured in the first game are no were to be seen. Tedious jumping is also absent and best of all the stupid character Amy Rose isn't featured (well she's unlockable but who cares). Amy is replaced by a much more worthy rabbit called cream who like Tails can fly. She has a chao flollowing her (the little baby things from sonic adventure) allowing for unique fun tricks and skills, like sending "cheese" the chao homing in on enemies in mid flight. In most levels its possible to hold the right d-pad down and get through the level, although you may not get the spec. Rings and experience the level it exemplifies the fluidity of this new rendition. Tricks added to jumps allow for secret areas to be reached and lightning fast runs, especially with the new speed mechanics pushing the character off the screen all create a true classic. If looking for a new game to pass the time I recommend this game totally. Its a much better game than the last one for gba and worth my money.  If you cant find it in the store use  urlLink eBay . Internet trading is the future and you should support it. Its also quite cheap and if you're not buying the game for release purposes you should buy it on eBay.

       Tell me what you think of this. Took me quite the time especially when i was sick and with a strained neck. Feeel free to post what you think. Eh tis not finished    Macbeths’ journey through the self destructive trail of death and murder in order to succeed and achieve power is driven by the sole ambition that Macbeth, is exhumed unto due to the prospect of the highest position of the land, the position of king. However to achieve this God appointed position Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth (who is driven more so by her ambition.) have to hide their true ambitions in order to deceive the rest of the aristocracy that they are truly legitimate and represent the innocent. Macbeth retains his guilt and self afflicted suffering after all the murders he has committed. He masks this hindrance in order to look to the rest of the royal family as if nothing is wrong. The masking which is evident throughout the play is necessary for the couples plan for the assent to the throne and this deception is evident throughout their trail of destruction. All through Act 3 Scene 4 Macbeth and Lady Macbeth both mask their real intentions while hosting a royal party; however Macbeth upon seeing the ghost of Banquo slips with the on going charade, by protesting his innocence “Thou canst not say I did it: never shake    Thy gory locks at me   ” on the murder of his best friend giving the attendants of the party suspicion towards him. Lady Macbeth hides Macbeths’ splurge of guilt trying to keep the crimes under rap, exemplifying the masking of reality and its importance that is exhibited throughout the play and how, many other characters in the play use this to get their agenda fulfilled without a major hindrance. Masking appearances and secret inhibitions are not only displayed by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth but by many of the other characters who have suspicions about Macbeth and the murders, but hide it in order to survive, as questioning the king would amount to treason. For example Macduff hides his reason for leaving his family in order to recruit an army to save them and Scotland from the tyranny of Macbeth. His family tells Macbeth that he is a deserter which sadly but conveniently helps Macduff gather the troops without disruption. Another perspective of the play is in the focus on crime, on how in the end if you have committed something sinister or evil it will always catch up to you and you will be served equal or creator in return. Throughout the play Macbeth becomes a killing machine in order to keep his throne and allow it to stay in the blood line. However, karma catches up to him   , “It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood   .” confesses Macbeth knowing his own fate, in which in the final act he is invaded by the right hearted Macduff and slain in his own castle. So to with Lady Macbeth the guilt and self inflicted pain of the murders becomes too much for her, it fronts up and engulfs her mind resulting in suicide. Again in Act 3 Scene 4 the murder of Banquo comes back to haunt Macbeth during the royal banquet. Macbeth who is already a neurotic mess due to previous murders and now Fleance escaping the ghostly apparition of Banquo pushes him over the edge as his own doings catch up to him, he then lets out a splurge of homicidal denial. Signifying the key moment in the play when the tides of his life begin to change, his rise to power becomes a decent into madness and deterioration. The Marxist reading agues that the play Macbeth is a prime example of how the ideological capitalism of today is a system that will always amount in someone wanting power creating struggles, violence and conflict resulting in evil. By rattling the cage of the stability that society has, as Macbeth did, it amounts in violence and evil exhibited in and throughout the play Macbeth. If the Marxist thinking was applied to the way of life, the case of Macbeth’s tyranny would not have happened and the destruction caused would have been non existent. With all people living as equal pursuit for a throne or fights over power cannot exist and the example of Macbeth wouldn’t have occured. Having little amounts of people at the top of the hierarchy is agued by the Marxist reading to have negative effects on society as a whole. In the case of Macbeth with little numbers of people at the top of the pyramid they keep the poorer people effectively “in their place”. With little amounts people in command making serious decisions mistakes can be made which greatly affects the poor people like with Macbeths tyrannical rule over the people and Scotland. Macbeth is a prime example of a tragic hero with so many great qualities but has an incredibly strong ambition which is his Achilles heal bringing him down and becoming a self consuming tyrant that stops only at death.

      Well this dosent come as a suprise to me but my school is full of adolecants seeming with ignorance , the new upper class. But they've jumped on the popular micheal moore band wagon. "im left wing" they say. "Im socialist" "swann (who is me) are you a facist oh yeah you a facist, your a nazi, communist facist dictator" I mean i dont even have a clue what that means. A rich religious indepentent school sitting on the Sydney Harbour bank breeds stupidity, people like this shouldn't be given the chance for education. idiocy and ignorance they display everyday biols my blood like a well tuned skillet. Racism, homophobia and religion its all there. If only someone thought about religion and god, actually thought about it, challenged the actual existence of a concept shoved down their throught since the've existed. I hate people.
