      God I love that place. Where else could I buy so much felt, embroidery thread, crimps, raffia, etc etc etc for only $30?! My house looks like a crafting disaster site, there are long cotton threads everywhere and Basil is having great fun playing with the little grey felt mousie I made for him.   Counting down the days...

      Feeling quite sad tonight. A bit lost, or something.  After waking up sometime in the afternoon (well, it is Sunday) I arose to a miserable day outside. Rain pouring and a squally wind made me want to stay inside all day but instead I braved the cold with my favourite scarf, the big jacket she sent me from overseas and my new llama cap and met a friend in Fremantle (a gorgeous port city just south of where I live - the place to go for markets and cafes) for lunch. Feasted on hot gourmet pizza, and drank coffee after coffee.   Came home to find that (shock horror) Max had actually resisted digging in holes in the newly mowed lawn -  the little saint - so that we should pass the house inspection tomorrow with flying colours. Her usual preference is to dig one particular hole (about a metre square in size), smack bang in the middle of the lawn. Not today.   As I type Basil is running around the house as if he's possessed - must be the weather outside. Remember in school there was something about wintery weather that made everyone act a bit crazy.  Spotlight has a one day only sale tomorrow! Maybe that will bring me out of my bad mood. Crafty projects ahoy. I will be shopping with bells on...

       urlLink    Maxine (blue heeler x border collie) and Basil (russian blue) enjoying a cuddle on the couch. They are becoming the best of friends. Max will be 3 in a few months and Basil will be 1 on the 11th of October. Max enjoys digging, playing, walkies, retrieving the ball, and general naughtiness. Basil likes smooches, cuddles and sleeping. &nbsp; urlLink

      Had a fairly uneventful night of tv and knitting (as promised!). My current projects are: -A knitted throw consisting of 20cm x 20cm squares knitted in different stitches in shades of rose, purple, chocolates and creams (mostly 8ply  urlLink Jo Sharp  yarn with a bit of mohair thrown in) -A crocheted 'Jessica Simpson' daisy-pattern shawl, from a pattern I bought off E-bay which was concocted by  urlLink Stitch Diva  -And finally a scarf made of purple mohair and Heirloom's  urlLink Monique   I have an amazing skein of Colinette's  urlLink wigwam  cotton tape in 'Summer Berries' (a gorgeous array of earthy browns, pinks and purples) that I have managed to get into a huge tangled knot. Pretty annoying considering it's $25/skein. I'm too impatient for that kind of thing so I've stashed it in a plastic bag in a cupboard. It will return when she gets home to sort it out for me!

      Collected my final assignments from uni today, was very happy with my grades and I now feel as though I can  do  Honours with enough courage to attempt a First Class.  Have given myself the last week off from thinking about issues of queer theory, what with four weeks of mid-year holidays remaining there is more than enough time left to start reading the heavy stuff.  For this weekend at least, my life will consist of much tv, dvds, and knitting pleasures...  Only four weeks and 3 days til she comes home (who's counting?) and my mind is already flurrying about, thinking of everything I want to have done before she is home. I want the house to be  perfect , the food shopping done, etc, so that I can bring her home from the airport and begin the celebrations.

      Wednesday night we drove all the way out to some dodgy pub in the eastern 'burbs to witness one of my favourite local bands  urlLink Little Birdy &nbsp;- a tad disappointing considering they only played for an hour. But, they played well and belted out their well-known singles ( This is a love song, Baby blue etc) &nbsp; that made it into the JJJ Hot 100 last year, as well as some of their newer tracks. Rumour has it they are about to release an album in August, which I can't wait for! The singer, Katy Steele, has this sexy Chrissie Amphlett thing going on with  that  hair. And any girl that wears a mini-skirt with red patent high heels while playing guitar gets a gold star in my books!  Have spent today reading and taking notes from  urlLink The Good, The Bad and The Gorgeous: Popular Culture's Romance With Lesbianism . It has a particularly interesting chapter on Madonna - interesting to me because I've never liked her and think she has been over-analysed as a 'dyke icon'. I think she's given way too much credit and particularly disagreed with the statement "Nothing can be said about the image of women in the last decade without reference to her" (the book was written in 1994).&nbsp; I can think of many, many women the world 0ver whose lives owe nothing to Madonna whatsoever!   I also believe she is given way too much credit for the whole 'liberation of female sexuality' thing.&nbsp; The writer of this chapter, obviously a blinded Madonna fan with tunnel vision, writes: "Adopting a masculine style here, a feminine pose there, substituting sexual object choices as the fancy takes her, she is simultaneously butch and femme, gay and straight. The term 'gender fuck' could have been coined especially for her". Well excuse me, but I disagree. There is never any doubt, in any of Madsy's vid-clips, promo pics or lyrics etc as to both her sexuality and her gender. She is clearly a woman who is aware of the commercial gain to be had from playing at being a lesbian, or a slut, or an androgyne figure.&nbsp;   Enough ranting.

      Ever since seeing the  urlLink Blythe  dolls on another blog I can't help but spend hours searching for them on E-bay.&nbsp; They are just so mod and I have already composed many mini-hats, scarves and accessories I could knit/sew them.&nbsp; I really want one! But I'm afraid that if I actually forked out the $100+ to get one, I'd be wracked with guilt over such an unnecessary&nbsp;purchase that is only a doll, at the end of the day.&nbsp; And something tells me Ange wouldn't be too happy with it. When I explained Blythe to her yesterday on the phone she replied "Have you ever heard the saying... [long pause]...  you have way too much time on your hands? " I'm sure she's right. Especially considering that today is the first official day of the semester and although I have no actual class time, I promised myself last night that I would get up and make a 'work day' of it - ie 8 hours of studying. It's 2pm, and this hasn't happened yet. I just can't work to a normal schedule! But I have written a list of things I want to achieve this week so as long as they are completed it doesn't matter what time of the day or night I do them, right?  I've also noticed myself becoming increasingly bored with my knitting. I have been making up reasons to avoid it. This is  bad . I thought perhaps I'd buy myself the  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch  book to re-inspire me. Once again I'm scared of forking out yet more hard-earned cash on something I may not actually need. I shudder when I think how much money I've already spent on knitting supplies. Does anyone have any tips on how someone with a short attention span can get back into a much-loved hobby?

      A particular moment of clarity came today when it suddenly dawned on me how much television I watched yesterday. I had one of those shitty-can't be assed doing anything-stay in your pj's all day- kind of days. And today I recalled that I had watched television from 4.30pm ( Bold and The Beautiful  - this isn't regular viewing, believe me) until around 2am ( Big Brother Uplate  - ditto. You know you are having motivational issues when you watch this programme). As I type this, I see how shocking and above all  sad  this may look. I took breaks, of course, to have&nbsp;a bath and make cups of tea, but for some reason I had an absolute television marathon. I suspect that the reason I unconsciously did this was probably due to the fact that the semester is about to start (this Monday, to be precise).&nbsp; Knowing this has somehow kickstarted my brain into slacker mode. Which is why, tonight, I have deliberately left the tv alone and instead taken up the task of organising my desk, and sorting all of the jumbled journal articles I've printed out over time into neat, sorted manilla folders. One is entitled 'General Honours info', another 'Femme/Butch', and another 'Queer visibility in pop. culture'. I figure there will be many more manilla folders and many more swanky titles to come, but these are a pretty good start I think.   And I've pledged to myself that I will do my stationery shopping for the semester at officewords tomorrow, breathing in the clean crisp smell of ink cartridges, unused reams of Reflex A4 and unlimited colour combinations of post-it note cubes. (I'm a stationery junkie - what a confession to make!) There is something about officeworks that makes  me  feel clean and crisp. It gives me hope that I can fill that unused paper with meaningful combinations of words and sentences, forming an award-winning thesis.  Today's post makes me sound like a big nerd. I'm okay with that.   If you're into horoscope predictions, which I am,  urlLink here  is my favourite site of all time. It's always surprisingly accurate, and, as with much of the internet, makes for good procrastination activity.

      I've been enjoying just lazing around the house lately, doing nothing in particular. Even my knitting and mosaic have taken a backseat, as has entertaining any possibility of beginning my thesis a week early. I'm not sure why this is - I just seem to enjoy being lost in my own thoughts and I've also been doing lots of reminiscing. It has definitely been a retrospective and an introspective week for me. Perhaps because I've spent so much time on my own while Ange has been away, and this solitary period is soon drawing to a close with her pending arrival home - which, of course, is only a good thing. I guess a birthday always does that to me as well.&nbsp;I am no longer bored in my own company, or lonely, or afraid - well, I do get a little lonely now and then, mostly when I'm climbing into bed on my own at night.&nbsp;   I'm listening to two amazing records at the moment - starsailor's 'Silence is Easy' and the best of Sinead O'connor. I keep playing 'Nothing Compares 2 U' over and over again. Not because it's a sad song, but I just like singing along to it. It sounds real. Last month it was Neil Young's 'Harvest'.&nbsp; I definitely go through stages with my music - something will be on replay for a while, only to be replaced by something else a few weeks later.&nbsp;   I've also lost 7 kg's over the last 12 weeks, only 2kg short of my goal. All my pants are too big, which is a great feeling, but it also means I'm a bit short of clothing. Still, those new jeans I bought with my birthday cash make me feel decidedly perky every time I wear them.&nbsp; I love being a size 12!&nbsp; Everything fits so much better.&nbsp;Cheers to healthy eating.   P.S. - Can anyone tell me why the L Word hasn't been on for 3 weeks in a row?

      Ugh... I have what is possible the grossest case of the flu I've ever had. I feel positively awful, and this is the FOURTH day. So, nothing positive on my mind I'm afraid. Uni starts in a week, and I'm definitely not feeling motivated at all. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that it's 16 sleeps til my girl gets home.

      Why, oh why, do I repeatedly do this to myself? It's not all that often anymore, granted, but when I'm out and having a good time I seem to forget just how much that extras dacquairi will make me hurt the next morning. As well as the three shooters, numerous vinos, and vodka red bull drinks. Left the bar at 3, when it closed, after a great night of dancing, laughing, and enjoying the company of my friends as well as that of some random strangers. This morning I woke up feeling dizzy and sick, and I'm quite sure I shouldn't have driven this morning - but alas! I had to come to work. Yes, work, on a Saturday, but I'm only here til lunch time so can't complain too much. I am craving orange juice (bought a big bottle of it to work with me) as well as scrambled eggs and bacon - I can smell them cooking as I type, and  taste  them in my mouth. The salty, crispy, fatty, warm goodness. Oh the happiness that meal would bring me. Preferably in a cafe so I don't have to do the dishes myself.   A philosophical question for you - what is the appeal of women's magazines? Why do I keep buying them when my brain  knows  they are full of crap?

      Ugh. I guess the time is arriving when I must stop doing the above and start actually thinking about and planning my thesis. No more airy fairy ideas floating around - I need to get things  on paper , in time for my meeting with my supervisor next week. I am technically still on holidays, yes, but must get organised so that I can have a few weeks off at the beginning of semester when  she  gets home on 3 August. We've booked a week holiday in a luxury spa apartment on the south coast of WA, in a place called Yallingup. Gorgeous beaches, bush, cafes and wineries. Mmmm. Heaven.  But back to the - ahem - thesis. 12 months. Many words. Much reading. Goal: First Class.

      Last night was a  Friday night  - that night you're meant to get all glitzed with pointy killer shoes and shiny eyeshadow to paint the town pink - but instead I relished spending the night in bed with the electric blanket and Basil, watching Oprah's Birthday Special - I had to have an official 'goodbye' to the SaTC girls... Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Sam - I'll miss you! (Although a friend did buy me the entire final season on DVD recently - thank you muchly Meegan.)  I had a conversation with a friend over dinner the other night about growing older - seeing as it's my birthday next week I am feeling quite thoughtful about issues of age - and we came to the conclusion that going out all the time is something you soon grow sick of. At 18, it seemed so amazing to go out 3 or 4 nights a week, to the same places, enjoying the same old stuff. Give me a warm cup of peppermint tea and good conversation anyday...   She also gave me a blow by blow account of the birth of her daughter, Lily, and I have decided I would love to have a child in about 5-7 years time - depending on so many other circumstances of course. I am happy to say I've never been one of those women who who spends a lifetime dreaming about a white wedding and popping out the kids - but I would love to have one, maximum two, children. I think we would make fantastic mums. My friends seem to think I'd look cute if I was pregnant... would be nice to have that glowing look, but apparently that doesn't happen to all, as some have told me they spent the nine months throwing up. Not very desirable, after all.  My birthday wish list:  1. To have her home early. 2. A second hand sewing machine. 3. The L Word on DVD (so not going to happen!) 4. Shoes 5. Bag  That's honestly all I can think of - see, I am low maintenance after all.  I was given an early birthday present last night - an amazing pair of square princess cut, diamond stud earrings... absolutely gorgeous. You know who you are. Thank you x

      This had me totally shaken up last night... oh the delicious drama. I think the saddest part was when Tina found out Bette had been cheating on her with Candice. But the kiss between Dana and Alice made me smile, and I'm getting more and more confused about the storyline involving Jenny - just what am I meant to think of someone that feels comfortable going on a date with both the straight male she's been sleeping with as well as the lesbian she's been bonking? I can't say I can relate.  I WISH this was out on DVD - if anyone hears of it please let me know. It would be a huge help with my thesis. I've decided that since this show is the first of its kind (ie exclusively about lesbians - whether it is in fact  for  lesbians is another story) it's a pretty significant milestone in pop culture and it's therefore worth using as one of my primary texts for analysis.   urlLink The L Word Online

      So sorry it's been ages since I posted. How very slack of me. To be honest, the computer was the last thing on my mind after my girl got back from 4 months in hell, and we just returned from a week down at WA's beautiful south coast. It was amazing - cool fine days, rainy windy nights spent in the spa or in front of the pot belly stove. And I did my best to maintain my post weight-loss will power by resisting all of the incredible cheeses. We did get one block of fruit and nut chocolate from the wonderful Margaret River Chocolate Factory as well as 8 bottles of wine from Lenton Brae, Vasse Felix, Amberley, Madfish, Gralyn and Brookland Valley. Mmmmm... into the wine rack they go. We are going to try to let the Cab Merlots age for a few years but are doubtful that that will actually happen, given our penchant for gorgeous reds.   My points counting starts again today! (Still want to lose about 3 more kilos, and am terrified that my new $260 jeans will no longer fit if I allow myself to put on any weight! If that's not motivation, I don't know what is.)  I've been really slack with anything in my life that doesn't involve Ange -namely uni and crafting. I guess that's quite understandable but everytime I think about the roughly $200 worth of Jo Sharp yarn I am yet to knit into squares for my throw I feel guilty. As for the thesis - don't even mention that! Have many articles to read through and really need to get started on it. I think I will make myself get back into it this week. It's just going to be really hard while Ange is still on holidays and at my beck and call.
