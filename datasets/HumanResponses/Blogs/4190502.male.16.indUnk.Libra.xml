      Oh dear me... I managed to pull the stupidest stunt ever!!! And it was painful... So I was bussing a tray back to the kitchen and I moved over so Duron could move something heavy... When I moved over, I bashed into the door and a mug of hot coffee spilled all over me. I wanted to scream but I could not since it was in the middle of dinner... I went back to the kitchen after emptying the tray and started to scoop some coffee yogurt when Mike of all people asked what happened... When I told him he actually cared, he told me to go to out patient because we did not want anything to get worse and wanted to make sure it wasn't a bad burn. So I went to out patient and they said that they could not treat it they could only look at it because of work man comp or something like that. I said that was okay seeing I was not gonna go anyway, she said it was red and it would prolly be a blister, and to have my mom look at it right away because we might have to go to the e.r. When I got back Mike was waiting for me, I was totally stunned, I was like!?!?!? He asked me how everything worked out and I told him the exact same thing.... That I had to show my mom and such... And all the work mans comp...So he walked me back to the kitchen and we chatted and then we had to fill out the workman comp papers and the Beaumont incident report....All in All I am ok but totally baffled, that Mike totally changed... it is so weird... I've been praying and all but I did not know that It would happen that quick!!!! God really does answer prayer... So now that Mike and me are buddies as he says... I think I will be fine working in the kitchen with him....Maybe...

      Ok, whoever came up with the stupid night in the orient idea at work, should be fired! Or at least talked to. I had to wear a hat! One of those stupid looking ones....AHHH.... I should have throne it into Rocko's deep fryer along with the french fries and the stupid umbrella we had. GRRR... Not to mention the fact that the sushi smells sooo bad (gag gag) and the fans, those little paper ones, yeah you know. And then all the residents saying how cute we all looked, this thing was a fiasco and a half. ERR... LOL...TTYL

      Hello my fellow bloggers. We are getting new carpet tomorrow...O Phooy! I don't like this, we are getting all new stuff, the only new stuff I like is new computers/technology. I had work today, Mike was back :( but he was nice to me suprisingly, he actually asked how I was!!! Maybe he's just getting used to me. I had pepper steak for dinner, my mom made it, it was very good. She brought Arlene and Luke, the security guards some into Beaumont, they liked it too. Well good night!

      I am really tired today. I fell asleep at 8:30 last night and woke up at 4:30, 5:00 this morning. I could not get back to sleep, so I figured I would do something, so I watched the TV. I saw the Olympics live, instead of the junky re-run stuff at 9:00 at night. It has been a very long day too, with no nap in between. I had to go to church at 6:30. Then I had to run the second service computer stuff, after the first service, so it was like non-stop power-point. AHHH! And then I went to Uncle Mikes surprise party, he turned 50. YAY! It was the first get together without me-mom though :( ... I had coke, and sprite, and hot fudge sundays, and pasta and roast beef...mmm it was good. Well I'm gonna go...TTYL

      This is my first Saturday off in a very long time. Right now I wish I am at work, because I am very bored and want the money, but at the same time I like being bored because it is so relaxing. :) tomorrow is church and I am gonna have to run the computer for second service, but that means I am gonna have to miss Sunday school, and I don't want to. Well I am getting very sleepy, and its only 8:10, I had to take some Benadril because my allergies were bothering me so much! I hate allergies. Where is all this rain that we are supposed to be getting. Some hurricane.... The nerve of those weathermen, I can stand outside and stay completely dry... Oh well.... TTYL....

      Me and my brother went to Applebees with Deidra and my cousin Brian. It was a lot of fun. I love doing stuff like that and getting to hang out with people I haven't seen in awhile. It was weird my brother actually asked me to go! I had a bacon cheeseburger (plain) and a Pepsi witch was not a good idea now I am gonna be up all night. Arg! It was so funny, Brian ordered potato skins and a side of mashed potatoes LOL.  When he sat down at the table the entire booth fell a part too, that was one of the highlights of the night ROFL (truffle). It embarrassed Deidra and TJ though, but not me it was just too funny to be embarrassed. I am laughing now just typing it. HAHA.  Well I better get to bed. I am very mad...Jay leno and conan O'Brien were canceled for this Olympic news update and re-run. O' Bark!

      Okay, I am listening to my brother and madam truffle play the organ and the piano, very lovely. Madam Truffle got me thinking about treating others the way you would want to be treated, even when you aren't around them.  **I found some verses in the Bible that prove madam Truffle's point**     Leviticus 19:18 :     "Don't seek revenge or carry a grudge against any of your people."Love your neighbor as yourself. I am GOD. (MSG)           Matthew 7:1 : "    Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."(MSG)       Matthew 7:12  :  "    Do in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."     (MSG)    You see Maddam Truffle is a very wise women, and that one very wise women gets you to think. You gotta love her! :)  Anyway earlier tonight was praise team dinner...I always look forward to them. I love to see everyone and talk, every tiime I am there I feel as if I am growing closer with them...They are much like a second family to me! (Oh dear TJ is switching over to the synthesizer- rofl (truffle)) so that about sums up my night time to see if this thing actually publishes to the server :)

      Today was rather boreing. Alexa came over and we played on the computer and watched a movie. Big Momma's house. It was a very funny movie. It had Marin Lawrence in it. We tried to watch some other movies but they skipped because the dvd's never get put back correctly so they skipped. So we ended up watching that.  Right now I am inhailing th fumes of my sister nail polish and I hope I am not getting high but my head it throbbing. My hip hurts so bad. For some reason it keeps popping out of place. Oh dear Koby just bit my dad. I am taking motrin for it but it will come back. It must just be from my old age.  Well I better be getting off to bed so I can wake up tommorrow morning and do nothing...again.. TTYL

      Well today was a very busy day. I woke up at 7:00 and went to church. The praise team sounded great considering the amount of people we had missing. After church I had to go to work.  Suprisingly we were very busy unlike most Sunday Lunches, we had 123 meals, luckly all the residents came early so I could get out of there by 2:45 or so. When I got home I was very tired, and I fell asleep, and I slept through our company, but woke up in time to spend at good hour or two with them, it was fun.  Then I went to youth group. We played Alien, one of Meade's favorite games. It was my first time playing, it was great. The church is actually very scary with no lights on at all, especially when there is only 12 people or so in it. It was really quiet, I got to be the weapon once and the alien once the rest of the times I got to be the asrtonut with the rest of the gang. It was fun. Thats all TTYL

      I always wondered how to talk to people about God. For some reason to me it is frightning. I was listning to a song by Audio Adrenaline, called Hands and feet. While I was listning I just thought, that you dont have to go to another country to spread the word, people in your own country need to hear, we dont even have travel out of our own state or even zip code to find people who need to hear about God. That still did not answer my question on how I could influence someone. I am always to scared, and when the chance is there, I blow it because I get embarresed. I am not really embarred about what I beleive, but embarresed on what people will think of me.   Audio Adrenaline - Hands and Feet Lyrics   An image flashed across my TV screen Another broken heart comes into view I saw the pain, and I turned my back Why can't I do the things I want to? I am willing yet I'm so afraid You give me strength When I say  I wanna be Your hands I wanna be Your feet I'll go where You send me I'll go where You send me I'll be Your hands I'll be Your feet I'll go where You send me I'll go where You send me And I try, yeah I try To touch the world like You touched my life An I'll find my way To be Your hands  I've abandoned every selfish thought I've surrender everything I've got You can have everything I am And perfect everything I'm not I am willing, I'm not afraid You give me strength When I say...  This is the last time I turn my back on You From now on I'll go out Send me where You want me to I finally have a mission I promise I'll complete I don't need excuses When I am Your hands and feet I am Your hands and feet  Anyway tonight was work....again....blah. I went it at 4:00 because my mom and I had to pick up Kerriann. O' what fun. T.J. was already there playing the organ with MT (maddam truffle). Tonight was buffet and they had Macaroni and Cheese. Oh I could just here the hallelujah chorus. So when all the residents were done I got me some mac and cheese and roasted chicken (dark meat incase you are wondering), and for dessert I had mocha chip icecream with hot fude (I created a hot fudge explosion in the beaumont kitchen woops!, but i cleaned it up...hehe... Well I am gonna go... TTY guys later

      Today me and my brother cleaned out his room yet again, or what he calls his newly refinished lair. It looked as if a bomb had exploded in it. At 4:00 we had to go to work but i got to see maddam truffle and thats always fun **truffle**. I brought her an egg! and a pad of butter.  It always annoys me when people think they are incharge, even though they arnt. Well anyway my brother was playing the piano and Andre said he was not allowed to. It makes me mad why should he always tell people what to do? But then again we always have to remember that even though certain people in our life annoy us God loves them too!
