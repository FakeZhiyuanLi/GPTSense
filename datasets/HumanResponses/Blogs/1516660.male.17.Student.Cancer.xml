      yoz! i'm back! after one whole week of absence, i'm finally back! man, i miss bloggin....... *starts kissing key board and screen...haha, kidding. i've been kinda busy lately...namely because i've finally started working and bcause of my jie jie's upcoming wedding...wah, u really wun believe wad kinda shit a wedding couple goes through man! though their wedding is like next feb, they're already getting all edgy with the preparations. i'm just the bride's maid man, but i can feel the tension too...woah...its tense i tell you.......the plus point of the whole occasion, for me that is, is that i get to wear this really adorable whole dress...lolx! someone should kick my ass man!   sometimes i really dun get it, weddings are such a big hassle why do people still so eagerly go thru it? i mean, not to say that i'm a big critic or wad but its the truth isn't it? when 2 people love each other, they get married, then they are fufilling God's words but what if they dun? oh, i forgot there is this thingy called divorce nowadays but wun that be breaking God's holy matrimony policy?    "LET NO MAN BREAK WHAT GOD HAS PUT TOGETHER"   in that case, why bother putting it together when u know u might just run the chance of breaking it? if man and woman are made to co-exist, then why do we hear abuse cases every now and then?  *haiz* so many things i dun understand but no one to explain it to me.........maybe i'll jux have to learn it myself.    dear Father in heaven, i pray that as i grow older each day, i will grow wiser too. i pray that i'll grow to be more and more like Jesus, to love and give unconditionally. i pray for the knowledge to understand the ways of this world yet not forget the ways of the kingdom of heaven. i pray for faith and patience to follow in Your ways and not be discouraged and let not my faith in You be waived by the slightest storm.  for all this i pray in Jesus's name, Amen!

       People killing People dying Children hurting And women crying Do you practice what you preach  Or do you turn the other check?  From "Where is the love"  yeah, i'm back. i was reading the morning paper a while ago and once again, i was confronted by the ugly truth and yeah, trust me, its ugly. its like, everyday other day i flip the pages of the papers, there is bound to be some bombing or killing somewhere, wassup with people nowadays?? what the hell do you get from killing off fellow beings? don't they feel any pang of guilt or remorse whenever they gun down someone?? its a person for God's sake! don't they feel anything when they see the relatives and close ones cry about their lost?    hey, why dun u put urself in their shoes and think about it??   oh wait, i forgot, sometimes kill for revenge and for their beliefs. what the heck...... i thought Man were all made to be equal, no one's greater than the other. why is it that if even a monker like me can understand that logic, these self proclaimed "Religious Avengers" can't?? what's so difficult to understand? why can't people just be nice to each other for a while?    why can't people just stop and listen to each other? why dun they listen??    wun life be made a lot easier if people listened to each other and talked about their feelings?? its not easy to completely understnad another person's feelings and emotions but if we at least tried then at least it would help right? what's the point in killing and hurtung others just to prove your point or to proclaim urself superior or just hurt others to get revenge?? what's the point in it all?

      the biggest event of the year just took place this afternoon in the very hall of Riverside Secondary School's holding site in sembawang. students taking this year's GCE O level exams, namely and in particular, ME, Amanda Ang, actually found the a maths paper 2 easy!! Woah.........totally spacey man! *LOLx* well, that was the plus point for the whole day's exam, downside is that the chemistry paper really sucked! yeah........dun tink i gonna score very well for my combine science... feel so stupid suddenly. its like the pure science students have to do the subjects pure wor....and not many of them are complaining about plus, they are like scoring A's for it while me, i'm just doing it as a combine subject, its like half of their toughness man! and i'm already struggling like crazy.........boy, i feel stupid.   sometimes i really dun get it, how is intelligence determined? by a certificate telling the world how well u can memorise the textbook? or how well u can pull math questions apart and solve it? haiz..........i dun get anything! hrm.........maybe i'm like thinking too much and too deeply about too many stuff........its making my life really complicated and stuffy! i mean i'm a well feed, well breed kid, i should just be enjoying my life and youth man! why the heck am i getting all worked up about work starvation and the education system for?? maybe i should just learn to accept things the way they are like everyone else has............maybe that would like really make things a lot easier and simpler, maybe it'll make my day a lot brighter and a lot happier... what do you think?

      alright, forget my previous entry. i was rambling along, i mean hey, i jux woke up man............doubt my mind is even working right...anyhow, i'm like really bored right now that's why i'm like rambling again...:P   know i shld be studying now, but i jux can't bring myself to do it...ARGH !! wish i could kick my own butt. its raining now, i can see the raindrops falling outside my window, beautiful. i can smell rain too, cherie would say its the smell of soil but still i call it the rain smell, its my favourite smell...i'd make it into a fragrance if i could have my way, i'd name it ' Rain' (what else??). i bet it'll smell millions... LOLx   jay chou's 'An Jing' makes a really good accompaniment for the weather now. melancholy with a lil' sense of bittersweet, i kinda like it though. not that this spells me, its just that i like it, its like, i dunno how to put this, but its like someone is like trying to tell me his story, and its a really touching tale. almost worthy of television. despite that, it seems real. almost like he is whispering it in my ear now...     promises made but none held true forever is a wait, an unseen torment for the heart, for the soul  darkness seeps as tears start to fall, faith flutters as the heart struggles to hold   on to the promise, to the dream  such pain, such agony only one would know; one who is waiting, one who is holding on, to the promise made  so long so long ago  such pain and agony,  only one who have lost before they learned to cherish would know such pain and agony, only one in love would know    i'm telling you, i'm not crazy.....serious.

      today's sunday already??? oh dear....that means i'm taking the rest of my papers this week!! yessss.............!!!! finally, the exams are ending, after all the hard work, its all gonna end this week.....woah, cool man!   though the exams are like gonna end soon, i can't help but worry bout the results.... much as i would love to deny it, but results mean a lot to me....its gonna determine the way people look at me and my folks, its gonna determine my future! what the ****... haiz....i guess this life.   when i was younger, i wanted to be a lawyer really bad, i wanted to be an avenger of the victims, i wanted to uphold the law (and join the justice league if i could). but as i grew older, lawyers became distasteful. most lawyers fought for money and not because of the truth. plus, you can never be sure if you are fighting for the right guy or not, and because of that, i gave up on the dream.   now, i wanted to become a doctor instead! lolx! my reasons for the choice was about the same, because i wanted to help people. i still wanna be a doctor now, but it jux seems that being a doctor is no easy job. people look up to you and sometimes expect you to be God. one wrong move or diagnose would mean your whole career is over. all the years in medical school gone to waste........... haiz, no job is an easy job........  till now, i still haven't got a really clear idea of where i wanna be going. i love performing arts and i really wanted to mess around in it, but andi's right. performing arts is tough business, especially in singapore. the arts scene maybe growing but its growing way too slow...! its no help that most singaporeans haven't been exposed to performing arts long enuf for them to realize the emerging protential in it... somehow, people still have this concept that to become a full time artiste means this person's full time dead meat. being an artiste is tough, you would have to be the best to really stand out from the rest of the wannabes out there, and make a name for yourself. arts can be cruel sometimes, it selects the cream of the crop and condemns the rest as sour cream. its a tough business.   have i told you that i'm really into music?? and that i had actually wanted to become a conductor or full time musician when i get my butt out of school? i doubt so, and i'm seriously starting to banish that thot...though i haven't been playing music for a very long time, but wad i'd been through these years, is starting to disillustionise me...... music is dirty business, most of it is politics and more politics. you gotta know all the right people and right connections to get somewhere, otherwise, you might just have to spend the rest of your life proving yourself to people, proving that you are capable. music maybe beautiful, it may mean the world to me but it can never be taken as a core occupation.   music didn't start out this way. it started as an avenue of expresson for people, a form of praise but as humans evolved, music evolved as well. true that no two music can evoke the same kind of emotion in a person as another can, or like shakespear said " if music is love, let music play...". music has played on but it has evolved to become a form of business too. a business that seldom holds much truth and full of cruelty.   whatever.................

      hehe...i'm back, nah, jux for a while only..... i was going through my mailbox and i came across this msg, which i found really touching....i know christmas ain't here yet but no time is too early for christmas, everyday can be a day of giving and sharing, of peace and joy. i hope anyone who comes across this entry will like this christmas story.  remember, all it takes is one small touch to change a person's life forever.....   A Touching Christmas Story On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the gifts I didn't manage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself:  'It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go...'  Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year. How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it. Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I started to curse the prices, wondering if kids really play with such expensive toys. While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for.  Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny, are you sure I don't have enough money?' The old lady replied: 'You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.' Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I started to walk towards him and asked who he wanted to give this doll to. 'It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.' I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa  Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this.  'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister'.   My heart nearly stopped.  The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the supermarket' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me: 'I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me.'  I love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.  I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy. 'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?'  'Ok' he said. 'I hope that I have enough.' I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money. The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money' then he looked at me and added: 'I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose.'  'You know, my mummy loves white rose'  A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally different state from whenI started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state.The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?  Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.  I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial. She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had been  changedforever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a  second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.

      Tears of laughter tears of pain tears of terror tears of shock tears of mine flow so free  now why do you?  drops of pearls  and of diamonds  caressing my face   as i bear witness  to birth and to death to joy and to sorrow to love and to heartbreak  tears of mine now why do you fall? i fall for love i fall for sadness i fall for pain i fall for joy more importantly, i fall because of life; i fall for you   you are love, you are joy, you are pain, as well as sadness all rolled into one you live for love and learned pain in return you live for joy  and learned sadness too  when things get in your way you never say no and turn to find shelter when the toughest situations  ascend upon your shoulders you took it in your stride  and made the best of it some where along the way, you've learned to be stronger, smarter you've learned to live, you've learned to just be you; I've learned to just be me and i guess that's all i need to know

      i declare me NUTS ! Y?? Simple, coz I'm like so bored I'm sprouting nonsense online.........muhahaha ! My dad juz said I've grown fat........Man! Maybe its about time i go on a diet?? That would mean I'm gonna be missing out on my favourite foods...! Oh no! To not be able to eat is like the ultimate torture for me.........Especially since I'm a big food fan.  *haiz* wait a minute.....i see a really big irony here. i live in a very comfortable country with plenty to eat, a place where food wastage is like so darn high, and I'm actually complaining about growing fat and going on a diet! geez...! okie, I'm no saint, that i have to admit, but its like...HELLO!  there people starving out there and I'm declining my body of food for vanities sake! Wad on earth is happening here? People refuse food because they wanna look good (model skinny, in other words), not because they wanna be healthy. woah.......wad's going on here? people are starving out there for goodness sake! Some are so poor that they can't afford to feed themselves but fast food restaurants throw away burgers and fries that are perfectly okie to consume just because they have been outside for more than 5 minutes with no one ordering them!   HELLO!?!?! NEED I REMIND U THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE STARVING OUT THERE?? PEOPLE WHO WOULD DOWN EVEN THE MOULDEST BREAD THEY CAN FIND??   wassup with you people? Dun destroy food like that, its worth something to others even if u dun wan it. Kids are suffering from malnutrition and dying slowly and the disease consumes them day by day, poor folks who live on the streets can hardly afford to feed themselves 2 meals a day are also dying from starvation.  true, there are charity food houses around but lookie here! They need money to pull through too! Most people, not all, people i see, would rather spend their money on products to beautify themselves than to contribute it to a better cause....i mean izzit worth it? i believe there are more user-friendly ways to spend money, dun get me wrong, I'm not against pampering our bodies once in a while but to be spending hundreds of dollars on GUCCI and PRADA every other day is way off! I'd rather be giving it to charity.............It'd serve more purpose.   I'm not anti rich or anti pampering, I'm guilty of it myself sometimes. Wad i mean is to know your limits and well, think about the other haf of the world too! i dun expect everyone to be super saints and give everything away in search of the ultimate truth, i doubt I'll be that selfless myself.....Wad really irks me is the fact that there are people out there who believe that anyone who dun own as much or more than them should be condemned and that only they deserve to live in this world coz they are well-to-do............  WHAT THE HELL MAN ?!!

      yoz! Sorry I forgot to update yesterday....Can't really do so too coz of the major headache I've got...haiz. It always happens when I study too much... But well, I dun mind the headache coz I think it was worth it! Yeah! The biology paper was kinda ez today.. WAIT ! I can't say that coz everytime I do, I wan score for that particular paper... :P I'm jinx man......... Anyhow, I'm really in a good mood today cox of bio...haha! Never thot this day would come. Went for lunch for yi chun , Janet and Wendy jux now, oh yah, we saw wen qiang, kel and chin quan too... HI GUYS ! Weird huh ? Its like we're all classmates lor and we're eatin the same stuff but still we chose to sit apart from each other.... Girls one group and guys the other... Weird sia!   back to lunch, pas we were having lunch, Wendy made a comment saying about the exams ending soon, i thot she would like jump at that thot but she didn't....She actually felt sad about it. i thot otherwise at that moment but now, i can feel wad she feels.   its like, wow, we're gonna finish our exams the next week and i dun think we'll be seeing each other as much as we do now and i think I'm gonna miss everyone, even the ones i dun tok to...Its like, I'm already to seeing this faces around me and the thot that i wun be seeing the same faces anymore pretty soon got me both excited and scared. Excited coz i know I've moved on, to meet new people and go new places but I'm also scared coz I'd be all alone.........i wun have my friends to turn to for assurance and courage. I'm gonna have to face all this new stuff myself....The future seems so near yet so far.....Its kinda like having to venture into the Amazon forest alone and finding your own way out again...i welcome the challenge but I'm afraid along the way i might lose myself and my friends...The people who grew up with me this 4 years...i guess one will never know to appreciate until they've lost it, thank God I'm not one of them....  even now, i can still remember the first time i stepped into school as a newbie... lolx i look so standoffish! Man! Like a huge contrast to now,i mean i still look like that when i dun smile lah, but at least now, I'm more sure of myself and I'm like a lot friendlier lor! Dun you guys agree??? lolx :D can still remember the competition between the classes back in lower sec....The cheering competitions, robotics, class presentations and the syf competitions...haiz...All the memories, i believe I'm gonna remember even 10 years down the road! They're jux too good to forget, especially the people i met along the way, good or bad, all made an impact and taught me a lesson. More importantly, are the friends that I've made along the way....I've grown up because of them. I've grown happier and stronger because of them too...  for some reason, i can't help imagining seeing them 10 years later, at a class gathering.........Wad would they have become? Would they still remember me? or each other, how would they have changed?  really, i jux can't help but imagine......................

      Guess wad? I guess to a certain extend all my worries last nite had been to waste! *lolx*  I mean the paper wasn't as hard as I had expected it to be lor, but still I doubt I'll pass. I didn't do the last question plus along the way I had a lot of faults....Hopefully it'll turn out better than I expected. Gonna be taking bio on the 13th, another scary paper... Haven't been very good at bio all along....praying like siao that I wun do too badly for it....need at least a B3 .... *shrugs*  guess this means I wun be sleeping for the next few nights....call me paranoid if you want to but I'm like this only when my results are concerned ok........They mean a lot to me, much as I hate to say this but in this world, what defines you (especially when it comes to job hunting), is still what is written on your report slip. Sad ain't it?? You can be the world's nicest person but without good grades to show, people would still be looking at you with disdain.  *sighzzz........* our reputation lies in the hands of others, much as we hate it but how people look at us matters. Reputation is really something that no one can afford to be fooling around with...........  can you imagine? If one day( dun get offended, it's jux a hypothesis...) someone discovered that Mother Theresa used to work in a carbaret, (forgive me...) as a can can girl, would people still have looked up to her as they had before? Maybe after witnessing her miracles, yes, but before?? No, people would probably be trampling on her and label her a sinner! Yes, such is life, cruel but true.  *sighzz*  wonder why people are more impressed by a Harvard degree than another of  equal standing local university degree? Cause' Harvard is famous for producing good students though not all who come out from there are equally good. When you enter Harvard, you are just paying to graduate with its letterhead, employers are impressed even if your results are mediocre, while another graduate from a local university would have to work doubly hard, score doubly well just to get the same kind of recognition a Harvard graduate have.  *shrugs and shakes head* nothing in this world is fair, guess we'll just have to accept. Only on Judgement Day, will everyone be judged for our deeds and faith. only then, will it really be fair.

      oh my GOd! it has been so long since i last updated my blog!! Argh.....can't blame me though... imagine this, a rather skinny girl having to wrestle her brother, who is roughly 2x her size, every night just to update her blog, by the time she gets it she is like too tired to write ~~lolx   wad ever it is, i'm back and that is all that matters rite?? anywayz, during the period of my absence online, i got my writing mojo back. wrote quite a lot of lame poems but misplaced them ....most of them are really sad though.......... dunno y but i've been kinda down lately. very melancholy, very sombre, very unlike me. its all about dead and lonliness....very sad. that's one of the reason y i refuse to publish them, life is beautiful and bright, ppl have their own problems to handle, shouldn't make life even darker by letting em read my stuff ....  for some reason, i think i'm a very dark person. i can't seem to write about anything happy. i read so of the stuff i wrote some yrs ago....they are so dark they scare me. i think i've got an identity crisis and split personality....haven't been reading the newspaper since i started work. actually haven't been reading anything since i started work... my brain is deterioating... not reading oso has its plus points, at least i wun think so much...lolx contradicting myself...i wanna think or i'll go crazy and become senile but i dun wanna think too much in the process lest' i trouble myself too much over things that aren't to be

      wow! i'm really lagging back on my blogs man...think i really gotta make it a point to come online more often...  anywayz, today is world AIDS day, i've kinda got a thousand and one things going on in my head now. i watched the movie   last night. its actually about the start ad spread of the AIDS virus. i almost cried. the courage that AIDS victims have is incredible, their will to live surpasses many healthy living people. the radio had something on about the story of bobby white too and its really getting me to start thinking about my life. i should be happy, i'm healthy and living well. i've got friends all around me and yet, i complain over the smallest things. i forgot that there are people out there who are more unfortunate than i am.   surprising isn't it? we will never know to appreciate what we have until we lose it. its the same with life, its often when u are about to lose it then will u start to really live it. i pray i'll never make this mistake. darts, i really can't write anymore, i've got so many words swimming around in my head, waiting to be written down but i can't do it. i guess it'll have to wait till tmr, when i'm feeling less sad i guess.     hey, this is to anyone who comes across this blog. pls dun treat AIDS victims like outcasts, some of them are just as innocent as you and me, they deserve as much respect as any other living person. in fact i think they deserve much more respect than what some people are giving them. they have the courage to live on and they believe in life, they never looked down on themselves, it really takes a great deal of courage to do this, give them credit for it.in the main time, pls practice safe sex and keep to one sexual partner only, you are not only doing yourself a big favour, you are also making our world a safer place for children to play and grow up in. AIDS is only spread through sexual intercourse and by blood, its not air borne and its not passed through saliva. today is world AIDS day, do show your support for these victims regardless of colour or race.

      hrm........nothing much on today, or should i say this week. something just entered my mind yesterday, would anyone like another to forget the first? hrm....if so, den wun it be kinda unfair to the later?? in this case y would anyone want to do so? is it better to love or be loved in return? hrm...wad is considered better? it all depends on the person loving u and the one u're loving in return doesn't it?   it differs one from another. if one is to say that loving one is more fortunate then let me put across then. what if the person that u have given u're heart to isn't one who'll reciprocrate ur feelings? then in this case is it still more fortunate to love than to be loved? is all the pain worth it? isn't it better to be placing ur heart into someone else who will appreciate wad u have offered? silly as it may sound, i'd rather love than to be loved. to love another would mean i'm given the choice of whom to choose to love. i'd find it harder to be facing, yes, someone who loves me but isn't someone i love at all. it'll make my life miserable and his, a dillusion. this way, it hurts both parties. if it muz be den i'd rather i be the one to be hurting, hey, at least onli one person needs to suffer rite?    love is best given and received best shared and presented  but alas, love makes us fools too blind to perceive  too blind to judge  love binds but it also breaks one once said love is about sacrifices never about being sorry perhaps its true  a mixture of letting go and holding on a mixture of remembering and forgiving a mixture of laughter and tears a wait, a simple wish, a hope upon a falling star, waiting to come true

      ok, i know i haven't been a good blogger lately. especially with all my missed out entries. i'm kinda sick today so i dun think i have much to write about either, jux wanna post my favourite song up here for all to know, that's all i have in mind i guess.... urgh..........i'm feeling pukey again....        Lover's Concerto     * How gentle is the rain, that falls softly  on the meadow. Birds high up on the trees,  serenade the clouds with their melodies.*   Repeat *   Oh... See there beyond the hills,  the bright colors of the rainbow.  Some magic from above.  Made this day for us, just to fall in love.  You'll hold me in your arms,  and say once again you'll love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.   Now, I belong to you,  from this day until forever.  Just love me tenderly and I'll give to you  every part of me.  Oh! Don't ever make me cry,  through long lonely nights without us.  Be always true to me, keep this day  in your heart eternally.  You'll hold me in your arms, and say  once again you love me.  And that your love is true,  everything will be just as wonderful.

        oh yeah! a brand new year, brand new beginnings for all!     while the clock struck 12 midnight, i was talking on the phone with my friend and it was then that i realize how unexcited i am about the upcoming new year. sad case isn't it? it's a brand new year and i'm sulking away about it. didn't even wanna watch the count down show, it seemed like a facade. everyday can be a new year if u want it to be, why bother making this one day so different from the rest? wun it be better if we took everyday to be a brand new year, brand new beginnings for all??   forgive me, that was the sour me talking. new year day came and passed just like that. so quickly and so swiftly...dunno what to make of it too. forget it....  anyway, back to last nite. i was just sitting around doing nothing after i hung up so i decided to do a  'NEW YEAR DAY REFLECTION' , to which i found really surprising coming from me. i hate doing reflections, it makes me look bad and reminds me of the bad stuff that happened and my failures. nevertheless, i still did it and i'm glad i did. it gave me time to think about my life, where i wanna be heading in future and what i wanna do in future. although it was a lil' sour going through my mistakes and faults, i had fun poking fun at myself and i've decided that i'll start off my new year on a fun and happy note rather than a sour one. so here goes, my new year reflection....  year 2003 had been a rather frightful year, especially with the O levels and all but i muz say i had fun and enjoyed it too. first up, 2003 taught me the value of time and the value of friends and that it was alright to be vulnerable sometimes. throughout the whole of last year, there were a lot of times where i couldn't possibly have gone on if i hadn't got my friends with me. to lend me their shoulders when i get too burdened by my surroundings and an out reached hand, ready to pull me up wheni fall. i also learnt the meaning of value for money, or in this case, value for time. after all the freaking effort i've put into my band, we finally managed to get a medal. it wasn't wad i had wanted but it was wad i had expected. we could have done better most definately, but i guess to a certain extend it was good enuf that we got a medal. mayb i should learnt o be less demanding and less of a perfectionist...haha, i'm pretty sure many people will agree with this statement. i'm a very demanding perfectionist, not a total perfectionist but yeah, still one. i'm pretty sure it'll make a lot of people's lives easier. didn't spend enough time studying last year, so i dun think i'm gonna do very well for my Os...promise that i'll work like shit next year once i get into the sch of my choice, which is most probably gonna be a poly. i'm gonna do mass communications or business. i so promise to work my butt off to make it to the top and get into the uni.   the 2nd saddest thing about 2003 is that i still failed to get a boyfriend...*sobz..* yeah, sad rite?! haiz...think its got something to do with the way i look...especially when i dun smile. the feedback i get is that i look too proud and stand offish...! *sobz* not my fault, really. i just happen to not like smiling a lot, that's all. never mind, resolution no.4, smile more for this year! =) i've got to learn to be more open and friendly lah....otherwise i doubt i'll ever get a boyfriend..(wahahahaha!!) =) ok, i'm smiling more this year... not onli so, i gotta learn to be more open with my thoughts and feelings too!! andi is right, i built a wall around myself to keep myself from being hurt by people, but its also preventing people from knowing me and me from knowing them. so yeah, its time for the wall to go...can't break it down all at once, but i can try slowly...hey, they didn't break the Berlin Wall down in one night you know? ok, mayb they did but it was also after much struggle and much lost that the wall finally came down,so yeah...i'm picking it up soon. its not gonna be easy but i'm sure i'll make it. hey girl! have confidence in urself! another thing that i wanna do is to fulfill my wish to tour!! yeah! talked to kim hock last night, we gonna go tour malaysia next june...before poly starts...! wahahaha....mayb go look for more people to go also, more fun mah. although touring malaysia is like no biggie but it is already a big step for me...gotta take things easy remember? relax a lil' and be less demanding. i'll start with malaysia then then next year thailand, then china, then taiwan, then the world!! haha...nah, my no. XX resolution for the year, travel more. yeah, gonna try and save as much as i can then go travel every year... haha! yeah, travel every year. not the package tours that like cost a bomb lah, i'll go free and easy, go back packing... ;) sounds like fun right?? yeah, it has been a long tern dream of mine already, but i was too young before so i couldn't fulfill it, but now, i'm 16 going on 17, i think my folks trust me well enough to travel on my own... resolution no. XX+1, get a digital camera before i go travelling, one with all the works and stuff. i wanna go take pictures of the places i've visited, enlarge my photo collection. most the shots i've taken so far are all centralised in singapore. i call them the  'Images Of Singapore Through My Lens'   next up, gonna enlarge the collection and call it,  'The World Through My Eyes'  haha...i know the name is a lil' cliche but i like it, too bad.   Resolution no. (XX+1)+1, i'll be less stubborn and be a lil' more tactful... lolx =D kinda hard la, but i can always try can't i? hrm, think its about time i curb my stubbornness...it can cause quite a lot of trouble sometimes...and being a lil' more tactful would most definately help in everyday life too. hiya, in short, i wish to be a better person for this year la! i'll learn to appreciate the lil' things in life and learnt to love life more with each passing day. people come and people go, instead of feeling bitter, i'll learn to be thankful for the things that they have brought into my life and the lessons that they have taught me so well. for this new year, i'll learn to love the Arts more, any aspect of it. =) a few black sheeps aren't worth sacrificing my love for the Arts. let it be music, dance or stage, they are all different people's ways of expressing themselves. i guess the Arts is the freedom of expression of the individual. i'll learn to appreciate that expression and love that freedom.   ok, think i'll just stop here...my reflection is getting to be really long. lolx  =D think this is gonna be a pretty good year ahead so,  HAPPY NEW YEAR blog!

       Love,  a word of trust and hope that binds two souls as one  Love, a word misused, misplaced tears apart a person from within  It turns you inside out with the rawest emotions  of the soul within   It twists and turns  and blows you away  and out of sight  But yet, nothing pleases more than a lover's smile on you or the other   Ironies of life yet truth of love makes one happy to see the other so

      haven't blogged for so long, i almost forgot the address for the homepage......how lame is that?? anywayz, i just found out not too long ago that actually ky shares my sexual identity (woah!!) but he's in a much worse predicament than i'm in. i'm happily attached to a guy who loves me and whom i love very much dearly too but in ky's case, this might neva happen to him. i have no idea how i would handle it if i were him. it'll probably kill me....( it might, i've already had a hard time hiding my feelings for my dear...) imagine his agony!!   for some reason, i can't help but feel like splitting the truth to XX but i know if i do that its a betrayal of trust between two friends....it wun be fair to ky either. think i shld juz let things take shape themselves.....its not within my control neither shld it be........he's probably going thru wad i went thru except its 2x worse. feel like kicking myself in the butt. it feels like i'm not really doing enuf to help him. wish i could share his agony and pain so that it'll be less horrible on him.... Hey, if u're reading this blog, i just wanna tell u that my phone is on 24/7, just drop me a msg or line whenever u feel like u need someone to scream out to alright?? love ya, and dun think too much ok?

      hrm...I'm bored. Yup,you got that right, I'm bored. I jux realize I've got a very passionate boyfriend, passionate about music that is. Once he starts playing he practically forgets the whole world except his music. Sometimes  I really can't help but wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, no matter wad, I love him still. I guess this was why I was attracted to him on the first place, his passion for much and the way he interprets it is really beautiful, he's got a beautiful mind although it gets a little crowd at times and I can't read into it but still I think its beautiful... =)oh man, I miss him........  anyway, enough of him. I was reading this book on Chinese history just a while ago before I came online(the translated and shortened version that is...)and sad as this is gonna sound. I found it rather absurd, the Confucius part that is. I mean I'm a history student by choice and I love reading up about it. I haven't studied history in depth (well, they dun offer it to poly students...)but I did do it for 4 years and I'm a pretty good history student(I think...). I've read about historical events of the world since I'm in primary school man! History is the story about dead people but it is also a lesson learned and trialed by time. Well, I'm moving away from wad I wanted to start tying about about in the first place so, uh hrm, I'm back.   as I was saying, I was reading up about the history of china from the beginning to the three kingdoms. I gotta say, I found it very interesting except for the part that Confucius had in the place of Chinese history. China's history is the history of the world. Its dynasty rises and falls and it has gone through more battles and treachery than most of the western countries have gone through or encountered, I can proudly say, I'm proud of the rich history I have as a Chinese but the part where Confucius came in really sucked man! He set up some rules and protocols governing the way of life of the people that (I believe anyway...) totally made life unbearable. What Confucius had in china was what Stalin had created for Lenin, a cult culture. Thankfully he didn't do it on purpose or for his own gain or the consequences would have been unthinkable...But still, oh gosh! Emperors followed his ideas blindly and so fervently that the absurdity and stupidity of the whole idea simply astonished me. A lot of Confucius ideas were on the individual's role and responsibility in society. Men are suppose to work and support the family while the wives stay at home and have no life of their own. Their whole life is dedicated to their parents, siblings, husband then children. She had no life of her own, her whole life revolved around others. Their male counterparts role is about the same except that he had to provide for the family as well and more emphasis was placed on filial piety. There was an incident cited in the book that really struck me. a soldier deserted his camp 3 times so that he could go home to look after his father was praised by his officials for his filial piety while the others that died in his place received none of that. Now, imagine this, what if half of the active serving troops decide to desert camp for the same reason? Who the hell would be left to fight the ongoing war? If there aren't enough people serving in the frontlines, everyone else back home would probably get slaughtered after the invasion and life of a thousand would be lost because of these 'filial' sons, what good is filial piety if you're probably gonna die for it? And need I remind you, this happened during the Spring and Autumn period. It was a time of war and turbulence. Can u imagine if that is to be applied into today's life? =S   sadly, I can't totally disagree with Confucius. His ideas formed the very basis of the Chinese lifestyle and beliefs. Without him, I(we) probably won't be what we are today. His ideas suited the people and leaders then. It was something different and most importantly, it gave them a sense of direction and purpose. When war has ended, soldiers had have nothing more to look out for, families have nothing to fear or worry about anymore, not that people especially loved war and unrest, everybody looks forward to peace and prosperity but when one suddenly has nothing to think or worry about, life suddenly becomes aimless. Confucius ideas were the basic building blocks of many dynasties. It gave the rulers and the people something to work on and believe in rather than have to start everything right from scratch. Its not that easy. One's culture and beliefs takes time to form, like civilisations but dynasties some and go, they fall and they rise again. They get replaced by something else more sophisticated each time before time catches up and modernisation takes place, replacing dynasties with communism, socialism, capitalism so on and so forth. But if u'd look back carefully, maybe you'd realize what we have today was built on what was lost yesterday. The very basis of our ways of governing, yes is more up to date and more humane but if you take away the modern terms and facades, one might find himself/herself face to face with a method or way of government that has existed way before the word democracy even came about.   I guess what I'm trying to put across here is that to some people, history is just the study of events and people(mostly dead) of the past. It holds no link or reference to the modern world we live in, therefore a useless subject(as some of my friends and relatives have said..." might as well study geography! More use !") but don't forget, if not for yesterday, there might be no tomorrow, don't take your own history for granted, you are what you are today because of what happened yesterday.

      i'm worried about wendy. she's entering depression again and its not good... feels like me all over again and i feel so helpless because i can't help her. i know myself, i know i've got a slight case of depression but i have Mun to be there for me, i can tell him anything and i'm stronger, i can mentally convince myself that things are gonna be ok but she can't. she's really not as strong as everybody thinks. people tend to make wendy out to be some kinda wonderwoman, the kind that nothing can get her down. its onli when u see her in her weakest moments that u'll know she's not that strong, she's actually pretty fragile. i promised her mom to look after her, make sure she eats and dun do anything silly but right now at this moment i dunno wad to do! ARGH !!!! its frustrating u know? i want so DARN MUCH to help her but its almost like the more i reach out the more she runs back into her shelter, worse still, this shelter isn't a very strong one lo.... how?? can anyone tell me how? i'm really worried lei...she smiles but inside its killing her to do so but she puts up this front so that people won't worry what she don't know is that is makes us worry more........not that alot of people know abt though. how?????

      Yes! I'm here to fufill my vow of updating my blog more frequently... Dunno how long I can keep this up though...Ha. Anyway, nothing much happened today. In fact, it was so boring I thought I could die! Argh...I simply surprised myself by not going out today (a first in many days...) this came about really, as an incredible feat especially if you know me. I'm the kinda person who can hardly keep still and yet I managed to force myself to sit infront of the computer rather than pick up my bag and go out. Yes, my day was simply spent in front of the computer, at home. WOW! Oh man, one more day like this and I think I'm gonna die! ArGh....  But I guess its worth it, provided my videos finish downloading by tmr that is. Otherwise I think I just might go nuts. Yes, I spent the whole day downloading songs that I thought of using for my auditions for the Singapore Idol thingy...Ha! Yup, I signed up for the competition. Hey, I know that there is this terribly high chance that I might jux be the next William Hung but WHO CARES! I mean look at it this way, its a once in a lifetime thingy man! I know I'm never gonna get the chance to do it again if I missed this chance. Who the heck would want an 80 year old granny as their Singapore Idol?? Yeah, its that kinda thing u know. To do it once and get over it, so that you wun have any regrets later on in life. Who knows? Maybe there ARE people who are totally tone deaf but are having the Idol dream? As pit against them I'm pretty sure I'll fare well lo...I'm actually a pretty good singer depending on my mood that is. Who knows? There are a thousand and one possibilities to a single situation, so y not just give it a try? Even if I do end up in the blobbers segment, I would rest in peace knowing that I've done my best AMEN! I guess I'll survive just fine, I mean what's there to fear? I know I'm gonna have Wendy there to support me (oh yeah, she's taking part too!! YEAH!!) and a whole bunch of pals at home waving their pom-poms, drumming up a song of victory and courage for the both of us so yeah, I think we're gonna do just fine if u know what I mean...  My Simpson fever has just reached a new height upon the discovery of the Simpson video online and as I'm typing this entry, my computer is busily trying to cope with the amount of Simpson video I've lined up to be downloaded. Its really quite scary judging by the number of remotely queued videos I've got but hey, how often is it that I would actually sit down and do this? Once in a blue moon lo...Its not that often that my boyfriend falls sick and I've got no one to hang out with...OOPS! Did I let the cat of the bag?? Hehe....Ok ok, maybe I had an ulterior motive for staying at home but the thing that really matters here is still that I stayed at home rite? I'm not the bad girl that everyone makes me out to be, I can be homely and stay at home too wad....hehe I'm starting to get bored, none of the videos wish to finish downloading...which translate to mean I'm probably not gonna get to watch them tonite. Oh yeah, did i mention i'm also downloading some episodes of the Charmed series? Yeah, so Kel? If u want them jux let me know and i'll send it over... Oh ya, i finally found The Nightmare Before Christmas too! But i'm not too sure if its gonna be the full movie or not. if its the full movie, i'm so gonna ask wendy to burn it for me man! i've looked all over Singapore for a copy of it but yes, to no avail. They've onli got it on DVD(i dun have a player at home tat supposrts it) but its all sold out lor! Or i would have bought it and dropped by my friend's place to watch it... ArGh.... Hrm...i think that's enuf grumbling for a day besides, i wanna go watch Jurassic Park le. So here's to u blog, GOOD NITE AND GOOD BYE!

      alot of stuff happened since i last entered my blog entry. well, one thing that i'm most happy about is that my boyfriend's back!! haha...i'm like 10 thousand times happier now than before. one thing that i've learnt from all this is that i'm not good at communicating and that i'm too insecure. i keep too many things to myself and in process i make the life of those who care pretty hard. and more than often, its because of the failure to communicate that relationships fall apart. mine was slightly different though. mine was a combination of both i guess. i keep alot of things to myself, its not that i dun wanna tell people about it, its jux that i dunno how to say it. everytime something happens the first person i think of is Mun, there are so many things i wanna say and do with him but it seems that when i see him, i dunno where to start and in the end i just give up. i'll just forget about it. no, forgetting isn't the word to use, i'm just putting them aside for the time being before it resurfaces. it seems that it hurts to not be able to share the problems and happiness of the ones u love. i realize how much i've hurt the very people who love me the most.

      3 days has passed since my break up. i guess somehow i'm slowly starting to come out of the self denial mode and into accepting reality. its not easy i guess....but i'll survive..=) somehow i know i will. i juz finished writing him a 3 page long letter...dunno if i'll have the courage to send it out even as i'm blogging now, i'm thinking about the letter. do you think he'll reply?? i really can't bring myself to think anymore, i'm so tired...i imagine it'll be worse for him. i betrayed him in the first place sia...but it was a moment of impluse thingy...i did regret it after it happened. nah, i'm not gonna go there again...finally got out of it, i dun wanna go back again. i've decided to write him a letter everyday juz to fill him in on my life, you may say its useless of that i'm being extremely selfish here but i have to. its the onli way i think i'll ever recover.... i know this is gonna sound evil but i imagined that his pig would be most happy bout this...she might feel for him la, but she'd probably be glad i'm out of his life den she can come in...ha! evil thot right?? i thot so too....but i can't help it. i'm in the evil mode right now.... know wad??? after all that happened, i realized how much i love him actually. i mean, he's told me about wanting to leave to further his learning overseas so i guessed as much that mayb one day he'll leave me but all this came too soon....reality is starting to sink in but i'm really not mentally prepared for it yet... i love him, i always thot that if one day he shld leave me, i'll be able to let hi go graciously but now i know i can't....i really can't.

      I haven't been the mood to write anything for days already, I lost my love again. =) I guess after 1 whole week of mourning, I'll be fine la...I'll cry a lil' while more but after the crying, I'm sure I'll recover. I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much ever again, no matter how hard I try. I'll always love Mun. He's the first pity he couldn't be the last...But he'll be the last person to ever make me cry this much ever again.... =) I'll be fine!  well, let's see...Orientation ended last nite with a bang man! There was a lot of dancing, especially in my part. haha. I was on the  dane floor almost all the time and yeah, I was wild man! haha... I guess I was dancing to get Mun off my mind...It really helps u know? To get ur body in this really super hyper and tired state then things seem to become so much simpler. so i did, i got myself totally soaked and tired out, actually all 3 days of orientation had been totally tiring but i guess it was fun la...i got tot know my class mates lo..haha. not all of them i like though...i don't like nicole and desmond for starters. they both got attitude sia! nicole has this unbearable air around her that really makes her irritating. her refusal to participate in the activities din help either, she's always so bz clicking away on her mobile and well, just irritating lo! =S desmond wasn't any better, he's very rude and totally no respect for the rest of the class. he doesn't help out during activities either and well, like nicole just plain attitude and irritating!! well, whatever lo. dun step on my toes or i'll make sure u regret ever knowing me lo. when i bitch, i'll go all out one so dun start me.

      He...Just realize I haven't been updating my blog again lately... So I guess I'm back!   well, a lot of things happened this few weeks that I was away from my blog, so much that I dun really know where to start blogging about. First up, to everyone who have been messaging me but not receiving a reply, I'm really sorry guys, my phoneline got cut. Guess my dad failed to pay his part of the bill again...Well, wad to do? Anyway, where did I stop the last time? The Singapore idol part rite? Yeah, I think so. Well, lets see...I finally got in touch with this primary school friend of mine after a really long time. She's currently in India, waiting to do her A' levels. Her birthday's on the 4th of July(I almost forgot about that..) and yeah, I received her email last night and I managed to pull my fingers to work and typed her a pretty long mail updating her on my current happenings for the past 3 months?? hahaha...Not an easy task I tell you... I haven't seen mum in a week already and I miss him so badly but no matter how bad I know its probably never gonna be as bad as how much wendy's missing kailun.     I HATE tHAT GUY!!!    he went to cathay when Wendy was working with this dumb bitch lor and I guess it really got on wendy's nerves. She broke down and called me(I was sleeping at that moment...)and started sobbing. I mean, fuck him la! I really didn't have a bloody clue as in to what she wants me to do lor. He's a fucking asshole and she knows that, we(kel and I) warned her about him and giving him another chance again but she didn't quite register our words and now this. What do you want me to do? No, put it this way, what the fucking hell can I do? I wanna kick his ass lor but I'm not there and he's probably not worth the effort. Who would be happy to hear something like that happen? Especially when you've already predicted the ending but no one gave a damn about it. So fine, I let you go ahead and do what you think is right and best for you. Hey, its your life man! I'm in no control of it, I dun want to be. So yeah, I let her go do what she wants and when she got hurt she came back to me, I didn't mind that part seriously, I dun mind that at all. She's almost like a sister to me, I'll die for her if I had to but what can I do? I'm at home, she's at work, crying for some asshole that nobody really likes. Worse still, why is she crying? cause'he went to the movies with a pretty girl. Well, told you it was gonna happen. Been there, done that. Then what happen, she said she tink she called the wrong person, I got admit, I didn't sound like I cared but you know what? You needed to talk so I let you, what am I to do? I can feel this thing boiling inside of me, if I actually spoke more than what I did that day I'd probably end up scolding her and when I say scold I really mean it. Its probably gonna make her feel 10x worse lor, so why bother? Lets just say I'm not exactly the best kinda friend you'd wanna have lo. In fact, I think I'm a lousy person altogether. I believe in letting people do what they wanna do and hopefully they'll learn their lesson from there.    give a man a fish, it'll feed him for a day.  teach a man to fish, it'll feed him a lifetime.   so yeah, that's what I did but more than often I get blamed for allowing things to happen although I knew it was gonna happen. I get blamed for leaving people in the lurch and not being the sympathic friend. Well, guess what? Its ok, I'm used to it! Blame me for all the fucking problems you have, for not being understanding, for not knowing sympathy etc etc etc...I'm used to it. I'm fine with it. I live my whole darn fucking life for others. I've lived my whole life trying to be what others want me to be but know what? I never quite make the cut. I love my friends, I'd make myself look bad if it makes them look or feel good but you know what? Its still not quite good enough. I dunno what else to do...or maybe I should just stop doing anything, I should just stop trying, I know its definitely gonna make my life a lot easier...

        i haven't felt so betrayed in my whole life before!&nbsp; i swear, i'm never gonna trust guys again. i really never expected him to say something like tat lo. i mean, why do u even bother to put up such a front? why r u so fake? i know i'm a flirt sometimes but i know i'm not that desperate. it is my life motto, the absolute commandment in my life, to never flirt with someone who is attached, they r like the no. 1 turn off list lor...why? how can someone do that? i'm like so hurt and put off by it now that i dun really know how to react or think anymore. i guess i was right all along. guys are onli good enuf to be friends and nothing more than that. i made that mistake before and i can't believe i'm doing it again....am i dumb or what? i told myself before that guys; especially cute guys; are onli good for looking and being friends with but it seems that i've eaten my words and commited that mistake....dumb bimbo.&nbsp; thankfully, i didn't fall for him yet...i'll still be able to salvage myself...        &nbsp;   i'm gonna declare my latest life philosophy here and now:        &nbsp;   love is only a game meant for fools. its a game actually, a game that you will lose more than you win. to avoid getting hurt is to not attach yourself emotionally to anything or anyone, take things as they come and if it is to go, look else where. in this little game called love, to me that is, is all about winning ang pulling out when u know that u're about to lose so that even if you lose, you won't lose too badly. guys are onli good for looking and being friends. flirt with them if you want but never,NEVER TRUST THEM WITH UR HEART  ESPECIALLY CUTE GUYS...

      ihaven't felt so tired in a very long time already. i dunno why i'm feeling this way though, guess its because i didn't sleep last night. yeah, i only slept at 5 in the morning, spent the whole night thinking about Mun. i kept thinking about him these few days, everytime i think of him i'll cry. i'll feel so exhausted everytime i cry but i can't help it though, they just flow. i'm tired lei...really tired but somehow i dun wanna give him up. it seems that everything reminds me so much of him. the streets, the people, the places...everything. i'm tired...really tired.

CQ smsed at choir, and said he regretted not coming along with us. It turned out that Joyce they all stood him up. They decided at the last minute that they don't want to play basketball after all. He was quite angry lor. Sigh. Oh well. Looks like he learnt a lesson. Go Choir, instead of playing basketball.  I am perverting. I completed Chem TYS on the bus to school and back. So fun to do...especially drawing the alkanes. Like diboroethane.  That's why I say I am perverting.   I completed the 3 Paper 2s today. Woah! Took such a long time to do...and so difficult some more. Darn. but tomorrow more easier. Only shen ti the 30 qns and write out the ti gang for the paper 1. Can complete within at most 3 hours.

      Ergh! Today was a very bad day, in terms of getting back my results!  English:   HORRENDOUS  ! With a captial  H . My all time low! A C5! So.....dissappointing! I merely passed both papers. Bah. I   hate   myself. However, on a lighter note, I felt really happy for CQ, WQ they all. They passed English. Imagine the look on their faces, epecially WQ when they passed their English! Sheer joy and happiness!  Really happy for them!  I am so  proud  of them!  I really regret saying "Why should you be happy over such measly marks? Even I am not.". Really selfish of me!  I am feeling unhappy, and shouldn't vent my anger on them. Really sorry, guys!  Physics: Well, I passed. Yeah! And I got A2 for Combined Science. I got a distinction, something to be proud of! And I hope I  can get top.  I really do! I want to!  SS/History: Well, a major surprise for me for my SS. Didn't expect her to give me 6 for the lousy SEQ (not really that lousy la! she said it was a good argument, but I wrote out of point). This is what we call "sympathy marks". I should have gotten 0 for that question. But hey! Who should complain? Certainly not me. For both History and SS, I got distinction. Not too bad. I ended up getting an A1 for Combined Humantities. I also got  top  for History! Wee!! (Okay, CQ they all will say: bu yao nian!)  Today's basketball game was fabulous! Well, we kinda tied for the first few minutes (okay...make that 5...no 10)....until 3/6 shot in the first ball. But later on, as the game progresses, 4/5 clearly emerges top! And we won! Weee!!! Congrats!! Tomorrow is the finals! So exciting! I hope we can win!!   Suwawa! Go clean the toilets now!   Cannot, sir! So dirty!

      Today I tripped...AGAIN. Not really my fault. Stupid puddle of water. Pah!   Okay, today was not so bad! Our class won against 3/8 (ayiah! pushovers la!)! We are competing against 3/6 tomorrow! Best of luck to the basketball team!  Alright! Since I am in a cherry mood today, let me sing you a song:   a b c d  osmosis  h i j k  phagocytosis  q r s  thrombosis  w x  photosynthesis . Now I know my   Biology  , what comes next is   Chemistry  . a b c d  cation  h i j k  anion  q r s  covalent  wx  ionic . Now I know my   Chemistry  , what comes next is   Physics  . a b c d  excuse me  h i j k  tan chong hui  (dunnoe!! haven't made up yet...will update once the song is done)   Is it nice? I think so!!

      Okay...as I promised, I shall give review of today's performance.  Today was very  okay . Not  THAT  great, but still, very okay, given our choir's standard during shcool performances. We went a bit too fast during "cheng ji si han..." that part during Ba Jun Zhan. And Mr Low correctly pronounced Ba Jun Zhan!!! Finally! After pronouncing it as "Bah Jung Zhang" for yesterday's performances, he finally got it correct this time. I wonder who told him. Ayiah!!   I also tripped while walking down the stage!   I was too busy looking at the teachers (and wondering why Tsung did not clap) that I didn't notice the mike wire. I entangled myself and suffered a few seconds of embarrassment. How  embarrassing ! WQ later told me the people up there shouted "Kelvin Yip!!" when I tripped. Now the whole school knows my name!  Today we stayed back to watch the netball inter-class competition. Our class "cheng ba"ed and ended up in the finals with 4/6. This is so reptitive! we are always competing against 4/6 and   losing  . This time was not li wai. We lost by 2 marks. We orignally were tied but then we started losing lor. However, we were given second place. Which was not too bad. It is at least better than 3rd or 4th isn't it? Well done team!!

      Hmm...I want to give comments on today's performances.   First performance:   Sucks  terribly! The audience can't hear us! At first, we were doing quite well. But when we realised that the Sops started too soft and the audience can't hear. our confidence level fell. From not-so-weak to  pathetic ! I wonder why the audience even clapped that loud. Sheez.   Second performance:  Some improvements there. We are not soft this time. I think the audience can hear, given the loud appluase. But the for the Ba Jun Zhan arh!!! The timing was terribly wrong! There is one part where Alto 2 and Alto 1s were supposed to go: ting-di li. No pause between ting and the ti li. But we sang until there was about one to two notes pause between the two sounds. And the Alto 2s' voices were weak. We were getting tired and fustrated. More improvments can be done at tomorrow performance (only to two classes....mine and another class)!!!  Yeah.....that's about all.   I go so much angst to express.

      I am back.  I joined a new guild. A X-Men guild. I hope this is the right guild for me. The members are mostly Singaporeans, and I can't understand their chatspeak. Seriously! Can they type properly? Or it is already part of Singaporean students' life? If this is so, then that's really bad. I really wonder how they are going to pass EL.  Today, the person I mentioned at my first post talked to me. Big deal. Except he screamed and accursed me! I hate being accursed! Spoilt my mood for the whole day.  I am gonna watch the new Channel 8 show later, about kids having diseases and doctors and nurses caring about them. I wanna go watch. I hope they don't place the main focus on the doctor and nurses and their romantic romps. That would have been sucky.   For your information, I am eating currypuff later. Yeah.   Just for fun, let me give you something to laugh about:    Once upon a time, there lived a man who loved everything about the colour green.   He dyed his hair green, wore green clothes, green underwear and green shoes. He kept a green cat and green fish as pets in his green apartment with green hi-fi set and green television.   His favourite pastime is playing games on his green computer with green mouse and green keyboard.   One day, the green man was in the green bathtub taking a bath when someone rang the green doorbell. The green man hurriedly wrapped his green towel around his waist and rushed down the green stairs to open the green door.  A female salesperson was standing outside. Before the green man could say anything, the salesperson immediately began her sales pitch. On and on...until a breeze blew by. The green man's green towel got blown away. At this moment, the salesperson looked down at the green man and noticed he was naked and at the sight of his wang which was tatooed green, she was so shocked that she turned around and dashed across the street and was promptly knocked down by a car.  What's the moral of the story? - - - - - - - - - - - - Are you ready for this? - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Never cross the street when the green man is flashing.

      Today, an interesting event happened. My calculator with the off button was  kidnapped . It is very rare, for everyone have calculators without the off button. My calculator is   RARE SPECIES ! And it was kidnapped, as mentioned in the first sentence. By who, you ask. By...... WEN QIANG !  And I WAS SO WRONGLY ACCURSED! AND SLAPPED! PAH! BAH!  I left my calculator on the table, apparently forgotten about it (What a  heinous  crime!). Wen Qiang took it, and secretly hid it in my bag. He placed it in somewhere which I don't normally place my calculator. And, because of this, I was sent back and fro 4/5 and 4/6 upteen times, asking who took my calculator with the precious off button. At the end of the day, WQ took my calculator out, and  SLAPPED  me for being stupid. I was so wrongly slapped for something I am innocent of.  BAH!  WQ...you listen and you listen good. I am never trusting you again.  Until I cool off la.    I dunnoe why, but I also expect a birthday present from WQ. I don't care whatever it is! I want something from him. No present, write me a letter.  WHATEVER.  I knew Shuet Ling brought a present for me already. Was kinda surprised. Didn't expect a present from her. Well, I am certainly gonna buy something for her birthday. Wendy's preparing for my present, but she dunnoe what 'original' present to get me. Ayiah, relax la, Wendy! Give me something can liao lor. The Artemis Fowl book can already la!! Don't stress yourself out so much.  I am not worth that!  Meanwhile, dunnoe about CQ they all. I am waiting to be " surprised ". I am kinda buay hao bai right, talking about presents? But I am so excited! 7 more days!!   Today, I was watching TV. I saw a commercial for Titanic. They are showing the movie this Sunday. And I heard  Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On . I remembered it, and downloaded the mp3 later. So, the lyrics for the day is this particular song. Immerse yourself into this beautiful love song!    Celine Dion - My Heart Will Go On   Every night in my dreams I see you. I feel you. That is how I know you go on.  Far across the distance And spaces between us You have come to show you go on.  Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door  And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on    Love can touch us one time And last for a lifetime And never go till we're one    Love was when I loved you One true time I hold to In my life we'll always go on   Near, far, wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on Once more you open the door  And you're here in my heart And my heart will go on and on   There is some love that will not go away  You're here, there's nothing I fear, And I know that my heart will go on We'll stay forever this way You are safe in my heart  And my heart will go on and on      Ahh. That's about all for the day. Goodnight!

      Ahhh! What a meowing today!  I am left all alone, again, with my brother for the night. It's gonna be like a every Sunday thing (except when my mother's not working). Suddenly, I became the head of the family(for the night). I have to buy dinner for me and my brother. I have to look after the whole house, and him. The leadership position got thrown to me. I feel....I dunnnoe. I don't know how to describe my feeling. I have to be more responsible. I have to make sure nothing goes wrong. O.o o.O  I surfed the Internet today, for most of the days. Yeah. Today's kinda boring.  Tomorrow's back to school! Wee....for the Chem, Bio and Humanities lessons. Yeah! Kinda excited about it! Get to go to school again! Strangely enough, I miss school. I am weird. But who cares?   Oh well, I shall end this with  Eyes On Me , an ending theme for Final Fantasy VIII. Enjoy!     Eyes On Me - Faye Wong   Whenever sang my songs On the stage, on my own Whenever said my words Wishing they would be heard  I saw you smiling at me Was it real or just my fantasy  You'd always be there in the corner Of this tiny little bar  My last night here for you Same old songs, just once more My last night here with you?  Maybe yes, maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you shyly placed your eyes on me    Oh, did you ever know? That I had mine on you   *Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down  Shall I be the one for you  Who pinches you softly but sure If frown is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer   So let me come to you Close as I wanted to be Close enough for me To feel your heart beating fast And stay there as I whisper    How I loved your peaceful eyes on me did you ever know That I had mine on you   Darling, so share with me Your love if you have enough Your tears if your're holding back Or pain if that's what it is How can I let you know I'm more than the dress and the voice  Just reach me out then You will know that you're not dreaming   [Repeat *]   Goodnight to all of you!

      Hmm. Got lots to talk about today.  Today, Wendy borrowed me her FF Movies CD. I watched some of the movies at her house. I was instantly captivated! The scenes were so real, the characters were so real. Their poise, their movement was so romantic. I felt attracted, captivated, enchanted and charmed by them! From then on, I became addicted to the FMVs. Oh my! And I thought they were just some "ordinary cartoons" once. Ahh!! What a atrocious thought then!  Today, I found out that children, little children, are very pure. Very innocent. I tell you why. I was coming back from Wendy's house. I was at the void deck, waiting for the lift. Besides me was a small boy with a bicycle. I was strolling around, waiting for the lift to come down. Then, the little boy motioned towards me, said "ehh" and pointed to the lift. He was telling me the lift arrived (even though I knew because I saw from the corner of my eye). So nice of him. Then, after getting down from his floor (2nd floor), he turned towards me and said, "Bye Bye". It made me smile. Hardly anyone these days are so friendly towards their neighbours, especially adults. This little kid is an exception. It made me realised that kids are so innocent, so pure, not tainted at all. After being exposed to society and its' rules, they began to lose all their innocence. Such a cruel fate. It is un-escapable. But hey, I am still smiling. The little boy brightened up my day.   Ahh. Yesterday you learnt an interesting fact about me. Today you learn another. Everynight, before turning into bed, I must listen to "Time To Say Goodbye" (please refer to June 24th's entry for lyrics and website). I must! The music is so alluring, so drawing. Ahhh!  For today's song, I shall dedicate "I'll Be There For You" by The Rembrandts to all my friends out there. Remember, I'll Be There For You. Oh yes, this song is the Friends' Theme Song.     The Rembrandts - I'll Be There for You    So no one told you life was gonna be this way Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA It's like you're always stuck in second gear, When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but...   I'll be there for you... When the rain starts to pour I'll be there for you... Like I've been there before I'll be there for you... 'Cause you're there for me too.   You're still in bed at ten, though work begins at eight, You burned your breakfast, so far things are going great, Your mother warned you there'd be days like these, But she didn't tell you when the world was brought down to your knees that...   I'll be there for you... When the rain starts to pour I'll be there for you... Like I've been there before I'll be there for you... 'Cause you're there for me too.   No one could ever know me. No one could ever see me. Seems your the only one who knows what it's like to be me  Someone to face the day with. Make it through all the mess with. Someone I'll always laugh with. Even at my worst, I'm best with.... you - yeah   It's like you're always stuck in second gear, When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but...   I'll be there for you... When the rain starts to pour I'll be there for you... Like I've been there before I'll be there for you... 'Cause you're there for me too...    Goodnight all! See ya tomorrow!

      Today, I found out, why I hate cigarettes and smokers.  It all happened in a crowed pasar malam in Ang Mo Kio. I was walking besides my mother (at her left) when I felt a burning pain on my arm. I screamed, of course. Then I realized that someone besides me was holding a cigarette by his side, and that freaking cigarette burned me. I cried, the guy apologized, and I cried some more and stared at him. From then on, I developed an immense hatred towards cigarettes and the smokers.   I thought of that during my morning bath. It is very strange to note that thoughts/memories/great ideas always seem to come to me during bath-times. I think a lot during bathing. I even forgot whether I applied soap or not. Seriously. It happens all too frequently.   Oh well. That's one rather interesting fact about KY you all learnt today.   I shall now present you with  Destiny's Child 's  Survivor . Enjoy!    Destiny's Child - Survivor    Now that you're out of my life  I'm so much better  You thought that I'd be weak without you  But I'm stronger  You thought that I'd be broke without you  But I'm richer  You thought that I'd be sad without you  I laugh harder  You thought I wouldn't grow without you  Now I'm wiser  Though that I'd be helpless without you  But I'm smarter  You thought that I'd be stressed without you  But I'm chillin'  You thought I wouldn't sell without you  Sold 9 million    I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon give up (What?) I'm not gon stop (What?) I'm gon work harder (What?) I'm a survivor (What?) I'm gonna make it (What?) I will survive (What?) Keep on survivin' (What?)    I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon give up (What?) I'm not gon stop (What?) I'm gon work harder (What?) I'm a survivor (What?) I'm gonna make it (What?) I will survive (What?) Keep on survivin' (What?)   Thought I couldn't breathe without you  I'm inhaling  You thought I couldn't see without you  Perfect vision  You thought I couldn't last without you  But I'm lastin'  You thought that I would die without you  But I'm livin'  Thought that I would fail without you  But I'm on top  Thought it would be over by now  But it won't stop  Thought that I would self-destruct  But I'm still here   Even in my years to come I'm still gon be here    I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon give up (What?) I'm not gon stop (What?) I'm gon work harder (What?) I'm a survivor (What?) I'm gonna make it (What?) I will survive (What?) Keep on survivin' (What?)

      YaY! Today was Mother Tongue Orals (or aurals, according to XC). I dare say, this is my best MT oral for all the 4 years.  First, Mdm Oh praised my reading aloud skills. She said I should continue doing this. HaHa. So pleased with myself.  The conversation part was easy. I have a lot of interesting ideas. I even made her laugh. I felt so relaxed! Meow meow!  Neopets revamped the Cybunny. It looked horrendous! It looks like some badly drawn cartoon. In fact, is is hideously resemble those cartoon rabbits I used to watch....produced by some producers (Acme?). I bet those Cybunnies will be abandoned into the pound once the make-over takes place. I pity their innocent souls.   LOL! Wendy suddenly thought of my meowing skills being influential. She thought that when I become famous and get interviewed, I would pass my meowing skills to the world, and I would be the first meowing person! LOL! Such a great imagination, Wendy! Love it! Meow Meow!   Oh well. That's all I think. Goodnight.

      Actually, not that tired now. Was too lazy to type just now.  HaHa. Wendy told me she come to my blog everyday to read. Felt so happy for her dedication. HaHa. Like my blog is THAT interesting. Okay, after thinking, maybe it is. :) My blog is meowing. Yeah.  You know, I just realized something. In my first entry (go to the May archive to check it), I said I "probably won't update it anyway". But hey! Look at it now! I am writing at least something everyday. HaHa! Amazed at myself. Ayiah, I am weird (okay okay,  special ) one la. Say something now, do another later.   Hmmm...I heard of a story. Wendy's friend's girlfriend passed away one month ago due to cancer. They broke up before she died. The heart-wrenching part is that the girlfriend never gave up hope. She wrote in her diary everyday "I miss him".  She never gave up, never. Such commedable spirits! Her never-lasting love should be respected. This is a sad story. I feel pity, yet respect in awe for her.   Bouncing off from sadness, we now come to education. I read a good article in the Neopian times, stating how educational Neopets can be. Check out  urlLink ember188's  article. It's worth a read.  Today, I want to introduce a new song. It's an Italian song, sung by Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli. The title is: Time To Say Goodbye. I am posting the translated English lyrics. If you want the original one, go  urlLink here .     Time to say goodbye       --     I'll go with you   Sarah  When I'm alone I dream of the horizon and words fail; yes, I know there is no light in a room where the sun is absent, if you are not here with me. At the windows show everyone my heart which you set alight; enclose within me the light you encountered on the street.   Time to say goodbye.     --     I'll go with you to countries I never saw and shared with you, now, yes, I shall experience them. I'll go with you on ships across seas which, I know, no, no, exist no longer; it's time to say goodbye.     --     with you I shall experience them.    Andrea  When you are far away I dream of the horizon and words fail, and, yes, I know that you are with me; you, my moon, are here with me, my sun, you are here with me with me, with me, with me.   Time to say goodbye.     --     I'll go with you to countries I never saw and shared with you, now, yes, I shall experience them. I'll go with you on ships across seas which, I know, no, no, exist no longer,    Both  with you I shall experience them again. I'll go with you on ships across seas which, I know, no, no, exist no longer, with you I shall experience them again. I'll go with you.   You and me.   Goodnight all.

       Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix  Reviews (Part 2)   *Note: Same old warning yeah. This contains spoilers...yada yada yada...close window  Ahh! Ahhh! The truth is out! The reason to the rentless and murderous attacks of Voldemort towards Harry. He was scared by a prophecy, made by Sybil Trelawny.  She prophesized that  Voldemort's demise will in the hands of a child born in the death of July, to whom has defied Voldemort thrice. Voldemort will make him an equal. Neither will survive as long as the other is alive.  Ahh yes! The foolishness of Voldemort. He was actually scared of being defeated! He came after Harry.   Everybody is spectaculating who's dying in the fifth book. Oh well. The mystery's solved. The answer is:  kcalb suiris  (read it backwards). Such a horror! I always liked him! But nevertheless, he died for Harry. Such a noble cause! Ahh!  Among these things, the funniest was that the whole school is revolting against the reign of Umbridge the old cow. Terribly funny, I tell ya. The teacher's actions were rather surprising, but I must appluad them on their "courage". Try reading McGonagall's actions/views against the cow. You will get a kick out of it.   The ending. Everything was resolved. Umbridge was driven off. The mystery's solved. Harry can have a happier, and possibly, safer summer. But the war still continues, as the enemy has not fell.

       Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix  Reviews (Part 1)  *Note: These may be considered spoilers. Read them at your own risks. Close this window if you don't want to be spoilt.  This book has grown a lot more darker. And I do mean darker. There is less funny moments. Things have changed. Very much.  One of them is Harry. He became more angrier. He became more rebellious. He became more mature.   In the story, new characters were introduced.   I like Tongs the best. She's funny, she's quirky and she's nice. She's an Auror, sent to protect Harry.   I  ABSOLUTELY DESTEST , or rather,  HATE ,  LOATHE  (and many other acronyms for "dislike") Professor Umbridge. She's the new DADA teacher. She was sent by the Ministry to keep a close watch on Dumbledore. She is there to keep things in check. She is a absolutely, horrible  BITCH . And i never detest a woman more. Except Rita Skeeter, but Umbridge is worse. I hate her! She's cow manure. She's wasting our oxygen supply. She would be better off for Demontor's food supply (the Kiss).   Er-hmm....Okay. New things are in store.  One of them, which I giggled to, is that Harry got a kiss. From Cho Chang.   I am not telling others. Read the book yourself.  I am not at page 458. Will review the rest tomorrow.

      Tomorrow! 21st June, 7.01am. The arrival of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ! And I am gonna get it!  Woah! I am so excited. Finally! Finally! After 3 long years of waiting! It's gonna end up in my hands! The wonderous, fabulous book! Imagine my excitement, my frantic anticipation! Finally! The book!   I am gonna get the adult version. The metal pheonix is so cool, and the entire design attracted me. I wanted the children's cover at first, but a close look at it put me off. No offense, but it is kinda ugly. The metal phoenix is cooler, and seems so powerful. The children's phoenix pales in comparison.  Ahh!! Can't wait to read the book!  Countdown:  1  Day To Order of Phoenix

      Today's Poem Day, and I found a great poem on  urlLink www.poems.com . Enjoy!    Poem Beginning with a Line from Frost    as if regret were in it and were sacred      as if regret itself were a river and want  which was the source of that river flowed      through the river, more and more the more  the river thickened towards the boring lake      where what stirred once went terribly quiet.  This is indistinguishable from happiness.      This standing water was a mindful current once.  Once was a mindful current: now leaden, still:      it is ourselves we most resemble now; now  the maples that had been nowhere gather. When      we look down we look down on our own.

      YaY! Today was fun!!  We went to Pasir Ris Park, after many trials and tribulations, which I shall not go into detail with. First of all, we rented bicycles and rode them all around Pasir Ris Park, from one end to the next. My bum was sore. Seriously.....  Then, we went down to the sea. Okay, I didn't really go down, but i only wetted my feet. That meow meow Wen Qiang ar. Throw water at me! LoL! I shrieked, but I kinda enjoy it la. WQ ar, next time, I am gonna 'revenge' liao. :P to you if you are reading this.  After that, they changed clothes. My towel that wasn't supposed to be a towel was used by WQ as a towel. Okay, that was my extra shirt. Biege in colour. Ayiah, lend him la. See him all wet and didn't bring towel. And I made him wash it for me. And there goes my one of my outing clothes. Now I am only left with blue and grey. Hmm...what should I wear to the movie tomorrow?  One of the most interesting thing was that Wendy's kite got stuck up there....and we tried to roll back the strong It was horrendously long. I marvelled at the height of the sky......Wow!  We took some pictures. So fun! I am gonna have them!  We went home at 6.50 (which WQ reminded us again and again)..rode the bus and the MRT and reached home at 9! Ahh!  Ayiah, one note for a particular someone: It's not that I don't want to tell, I can't. Get it? And you asked if you were the one being hated. I was thinking of saying "No la! Who would hate such a loveable (tian zheng ke ai) person?" to drive you away from the topic, but I find it too er xin and gan ga to say it out. :P Ayiah......you will know it soon enough. On the other hand, I don't think you will too. HaHa. My advice to you: Try to be more observant. Yeah.   So tired le....meow meow. Goodnight.  Countdown:  3  Days to Order of Phoenix

      HaHa! Today choir was fun!   We were grouped into groups of 6 (for us, 7). We are supposed to select one song and present it to the whole choir. Since I have very limited music knowledge, I know nothing of almost every songs. They decided on "Qing Fei De Yi" by Harlem Yu. Since I only know the chorus, for the rest of the songs, I was supposed to do actions.   It was really funny man! I can't really describe it, but it made the whole choir crack up laughing! And we got thunderous applause! Okay, I kua zhang a bit. Colin told me that my acting skills were very good, and I am very brave, since "few boys would do what I did". I did those actions that Yit Hann would only do...those sao huo kind la!   LOL! Really enjoyed myself down there! HaHa! I would  DEFINITELY  do it next time. Provided there is a next time.  Countdown:  4  Days to Order of the Phoenix

      Hey hey!  Guess what? I am  selfish . Yep. Why? Because I belong to blodd group AB+. Which is a selfish breed of people, because they can't donate blood, but can recieve blood from any, and I mean  ANY  blood group. Which means, therefore, I have a higher chance of surviving when there is a need for blood  (touch wood! choi!!) . Just found that out in Bio today.  YaY!

      Today's Father's Day. And he is not at home.  Poor Dad. He's working the whole night. Didn't even get to celebrate Father's Day, while the relief is happily spending Father's Day with his family. Luckly bloke.   Mom's not home too, working as a cashier.  So, this is the first time me and my brother are left home alone for the night. Kinda scary.....But never mind. Mom will be back later....  Sigh. Goodnight.

      Sigh. Dunnoe why people these day want to commit suicide.  It would be very silly lor. To commit suicide at such a young age. You got a very beautiful life right in front of you, waiting for you to discover. Thje joys of going through adulthood. You haven't even lived half of your life, and you want to commit suicide? Siow!  Life isn't exactly a bed of roses. There are bound to be portholes along the journey. No matter how deep the porthole, we would come out of it. And when we do, we become a totally new person. Along with portholes, we are also bound to come across with joys and celebrations. We can play, party and enjoy ourselves. We look forward to these little joyful oscassions while walking life's journrey.   Killing ourselves because of relationship problems, family problems, studies, friends, etc etc isn't worth it! Totally not worth it at all! Why let these worry us? Why let these weigh us down? Why let this make us face life with a cold, hard heart? Yes, although we have become weak, but does that mean we have to stay that way forever?  NO!  Whatever for? Let people pity us? Let those who abandon us come back to us? We should   MOVE ON  . Move on with life.   Besides, we would be letting our loved ones down. At this point in time, we might not believe anyone would love us. But there are! Look at our friends! They are there when we need them! They are there to lend a shoulder for us to cry on! Look at our family! Our parents love us dearly. They love us unconditionally. If we die, wouldn't it be a big let-down to our loved ones? Abandoning them just like that. Is that reponsibility? We are making our loved ones grieve by dying, for goodness sake!   No amtter how useless we feel, we still must live on. For the sake of our loved ones, for the sake of ourselves, our glorious future.   Life is beautiful. Treasure it.

      Today's topic of discussion:  Storm   Storm. A famous X-Men. She has the ability to manipulate the weather. Storm is just but her codename. Her real name is Ororo Munroe. She came from Africa, her mother's tribe. She was called "Beautiful Windrider" in her tribe.  Let me just give you a brief history of her.  Ororo Munroe, born in New York City, USA, was the daughter of David Munroe (a reporter) and N'Dare Munroe (a princess of a tribe). When she was six, while en route to her mohter's village in Kenya, the plane crashed. Her parents were killed, but she survived. Being stuck under a pile of rubble for a long time traumatized Ororo so badly, that she suffers from claustrophobia, a fear of closed spaces. She was picked up by a master thief, and became a thief until she was eight. Then, her powers started developing, and she went back to her mother's village and settled there. She was worhsipped as a "Weather Goddess". When she was 18+, Professor X came by the village. He had sensed her using Cerebro, and has intention to pick her up to join his team of X-Men.  She accepted and became an important player of the team.  What's her mutant powers, you ask?  She can manipulate the weather, via her mind. She can sense shifts in the atmosphere, air changes. She can manipulate the air pattern so that it can bring about the desired effect, like adding more water vapour to make it rain. Basically, she manipulates particles in the air to do her bidding.   There is one interesting thing to note about her. She can prevent psychic from entering her mind. How so? Firstly, due to her manipulation of electricty, she creates static around her mind, giving any psychic who tries to enter her mind a hell of a headache. Secondly, when she is in full control of her powers, her mind is impoosible to be read. The pattern changes causes a psychic disturbance and trying to read her mind would be like trying to grab hold of a lightning bolt. Ouch for both intances. Major ouches.  Why am I so fascinated with her?   She got this elegant carriage. She is wise, she isn't rushful. She makes good decisions, a valuable team member. She looks great too, especially with the white hair of her. Totally stunning. She got these cool mutant powers. I want them!! Actually, the main factor is mainly her wise and elegant carriage. I got this thing for "wise" people. It is not so often in a superheroes comic do you spot someone so mature in her thinking and doesn't rush things, like many heroes does. She actually uses her mind to think, to analyze about the situation. A feat worthy to be praised, admired for! A very good learning role-model for us.  My concluding statement:   STORM FOREVER!

      Sigh. Listen up people. I am   CURIOUS  . With a captial  C .   That's why I ask so many questions. I have this thirst for knowledge.  I  WANT  to know. I  DIE  not knowing.   And I am picky about the answers I want. I don't go for general term. I go for specifics. General answers never statisfy me. I am  THAT  fussy, and kaypoh.  I don't know. I feel like it is like me being shut out from the rest of the world, because I don't know anything. I hate being isolated.   I HATE IT  .   Okay. That was agressive. I am sorry. You know, with this noisiness, I could become an excellent reporter. Buay hao bai. I know.  I know many of you have taken in offense, one time or another, with my constant 'want to know'. I am sorry, but that's who I am. I can't change part of me, especially when I love this quality of mine so much. I do hope you understand. Sorry once again for the offense.

      Today was Poem Day. I searched the Internet site for a poem I like. I found one. Although it pales in comparison with other beautifully-written poems, I chose it. I felt an attraction to that poem. It is so meaningful. The everlasting quest for love. The hope. The wish. Ahh...the beginning stages of love. This is written by an anonymous author. Enjoy.     Imagine Love...Wish For It.     I could only imagine, The love between us. I can only wish, For the love between us.  Every time I close my eyes, I see the two of us. We make such a perfect couple. Alas, I could only imagine.  I can only dream, Of touching your face.  Smooth, thin, papery. Your eyes emitting love.  I can only wish, That you can respond, To every of my intimate moves, And fall in love with me.  Your strong, willful character, Leaves marks of awe within me. Your care and concern, Gives me boundless of joys.  Even though I know, That I can’t have you, I would like to try, And try, and try.  I could only imagine,  That you know what I am saying. I wish you could, I hope you can.   -Anonymous

      Okay. Today's Jokes Day. I got nothing to write la, except: GOOD LUCK TO ME IN MY O LEVEL CHINESE!!!  -----  Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself 'She'll never go for me carrying on like that,' so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans, and shortly after that they got married.  A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings of baked beans. All the way home he farted. He 'putted' down one hill and 'putt-putted' up the next. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.   His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, 'Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!' She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to answer the phone.   While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but *ripe* as a rotten egg.   He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and 'rrriiiipppp!' It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming. He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real blue ribbon winner; the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin.   When he heard the 'phone farewells' (indicating the end of his loneliness and freedom) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. After assuring her he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled, 'Surprise!'   To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.   --------  The Camping Trip  Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson went on a camping trip.   After a good meal and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night and went to sleep.  Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend. "Watson, look up and tell me what you see."  Watson replied, "I see millions and millions of stars."   "What does that tell you?"  Watson pondered for a minute. "Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Why, what does it tell YOU?"  Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke.   "Watson, you idiot. Some jerk has stolen our tent."   -------  A Shaggy Dog Story  A young man goes off to college, but about a third the way through the semester, he has foolishly squandered what money his parents gave him. "Hmmmm," he wonders, "How am I gonna get more dough?" Then he gets an idea.  He calls his father. "Dad," he says, "You won't believe the wonders that modern education are coming up with! Why, they actually have a program here that will teach Fido how to talk!"   "That's absolutely amazing!" his father says. "How do I get him in that program?"   "Just send him down here with $1000," the boy says, "I'll get him into the course."  So, his father sends the dog and the $1000. About two thirds the way through the semester, the money runs out. So the boy calls his father again. "So how's Fido doing, son?" his father asks.  "Awesome, dad, he's talking up a storm," he says. "But you just won't believe this--now they have a program here that will teach Fido to READ!"  "READ!?" says his father, "That's amazing! What do I have to do to get him in that program?"   "Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class." So his father sends the money.   At the end of the semester, the boy has a problem. When he gets home, his father will  find out that the dog can neither talk nor read. So he shoots the dog. When he gets  home, his father is all excited. "Where's Fido? I just can't wait to hear him talk and listen  to him read something!"   "Dad," the boy says, "I have some grim news. This morning when I got out of the  shower, Fido was in the living room kicking back in the recliner and reading the morning paper, like he usually does. Then he turned to me and asked 'So, is your daddy still  messin' around with that little redhead that lives down on Oak Street?' "  The father says, "I hope you SHOT that lyin' son-of-a-*****!"   --------  A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar. After an  hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively, "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?"  She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, "No, I won't sleep with you tonight!" Everyone in the bar is now staring at them.  Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his  table.  After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and  I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations."  To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean $200?"  -------  A woman was out golfing one day when she hit her ball into the woods. She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.  The frog said to her, "If you release me from this trap, I will grant you 3 wishes."  The woman freed the frog and the frog said, "Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes (naturally) -that whatever you wish for, your husband will get 10 times more or better!"  The woman said, "That would be okay," and for her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world.  The frog warned her, "You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis, that women will flock to."  The woman replied, "That will be okay because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes for me."  So, KAZAM - she's the most beautiful woman in the world!  For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world. The frog said, "That will make your husband the richest man in the world and he will be ten times richer than you. " The woman said, "That will be okay because what is mine is his and what is his is mine."  So, KAZAM she's the richest woman in the world! The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, "I'd like a mild heart attack."  --------  One Smart Blonde  A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY. The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game? The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."  Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep.  The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."  This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.  The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"  The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "Okay, " says the lawyer, "your turn".  She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"  The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.  The blonde says, "Thank you, " and turns back to get some more sleep.  The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?"  Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.  ------    That's all folks!

      Okay....Blogger's down...until NOW. Darn pissed off.  Anyway, I want to discuss: Unconditional Love.  Unconditional love is the most purest love there is. It means that you don't expect love back when you give love to the other party. You love the other party because you do, not because you want him to love you back.  More often than not, only few romances/friendships are 'uncondtional relationship'. Everybody wants something out of the other party. Seriously. I observed. A lot lor. They say, mother's love is unconditional. I agree. This is the most purest form of love. Great mother's love.  Me? I give both. I am guilty of committing 'conditional love' on some of my friends. I realised that now. If they don't love me, fine. As long as I do. Unconditional love, yeah, I do that. Only those those I trust perfectly. People like my  VERY EXTREMELY CLOSE  friends. But now, I am trying my best to change all my 'conditional love' to 'unconditional love'.  Hmm..yeah. That's about all. Quite chim right? Actually, this two day's thoughts are the weakest....I still think the one about LOVE is my best written work in this blog (I treat this blog as one of my writing exercises....and mind-clearing....HaHa!).  See ya tomorrow, blog old friend.

      Second topic of discussion: Friendship   I got this email from Wendy, which I want to share.  Friendship is a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust  Friendship is when they gaze into your eyes and you know they care  Friendship is being close even when you are far apart  Friendship is hoping that they experience the very best  Friendship occupies your mind  Friendship is knowing that you will always try to be there when in need  Friendship is a warm smile in the winter   My personal view on friendship is:  Friendship is very beautiful. Indeed it is. Friendship, just like love, can make the world go round. Friendships mean everything to me. Everything. Without all those wonderful friends of mine, I would go crazy. Seriously. I was very lonely in my primary shcool life, and sec 1. I used to frequent the library, and I used to walk home alone. It was so lonely. Nobody besides me. I don't ever want to go though that again.  Friends. A very important necessity for life. I can't stress on how much it is. It is very. I will treasure my friends. I know I always will.  I also found out that: There is no place for "yourself" in a friendship. Absolutely. I always kick my interests for myself aside, for my friends. If you only think about the benefits of yourself, then you are not much of a friend.   I also try to help my friends whenever I could. Seriously. Sometimes, they mistook that for "kaypoh". I am sadly depressed. I am not kaypoh. I am sincerely wanting to help them. But what to do? Seeing my friends so depressed, I also feel so depressed. Sigh. What to do? They don't want to tell me.  But overall, I love my friends. I will treasure our friendships together.  Thank you. Every single one of my friends.

      First topic of discussion: Mrs Chew  I liked Mrs Chew. She is always very nice to me. Why leh? I give you a few examples.  -->She priased me in my report book. She didn't say anything bad about me to my mother. She even said I was "likable". I am so happy!  -->In today's "lucky draw", I was unfortunately chosen (I wished I could be this lucky when it comes to the Harry Potter contest), but what made me happy was: She gave me a look of sympathy, which she didn't to the other winners. Felt so sympathised and happy. YaY!  -->She is always nice towards me....kinda in a biased way. Enjoyed that la...HeHeHe  She is a very nice Chemistry teacher. She motivated me to study well in Chemistry...and I did and I got excellent results to prove it. She inspired me to become a Chemistry teacher. I want to return to Riverside as a Chem teacher and be her collegue. So fun. I have dep admiration for Mrs Chew. Maybe I should tell her that. During graduation la.  Thank you, Mrs Chew.

      From today's experiences (which I cannot narrate due to confidentiality issues), I came to realise one thing:    Love Is Joyful, Yet Painful    Love makes a person happy.  VERY  happy. Love makes the world go round. Love is the driving force in most of the things we do. We love love. We depend on love. Many want to love. Singles envy those in love. Loving couples love each other, and will do boundless thngs just for their loved ones. Such is the power of love.    However, love is also painful. Whenever one feels depressed, the other party will feel the same. Jealousy is a sign of love, even though it is depressing and ugly. Whenever complications arise between both parties, both will feel terribly upset, depressed, painful. Both will begin to wonder what wrong lies in them. Both begin to wonder if they should end their relationship. But in their hearts, they really don't want to. Sometimes, a couple breaks up, because one thinks it is best for the other. This is the power of love. A painful form of love. They still love each other.  Still loving.    Whatever the situation, we can infer: Both   LOVE   each other deeply. They really do.

      Felt terribly upset today. Didn't get invited to a BBQ. And my friends all around me were invited. And I was left out. I felt so lonely, so dejected. I am in such a lousy mood. BAH! PAH! I feel so much like crying. In fact, I already did.

      Heya. It's me again.  Okay, I want to share a link. It is:  urlLink http://www.mugglenet.com/facts.shtml   Yep! Facts about Book 5!! So cool!! Let me discuss some of the facts:  --> The choice between what's right and what's easy will be a pillar of the plot in Harry's last 3 years.  Easily the most difficult choice. And rather cliche. We can already know Harry would choose the "right" choice. However, I do hope she will throw us a trick or two, and let Harry choose the "easy" choice.  --> Harry will have to deal with a venemous, disgruntled house-elf.   Oo!! A disgruntled elf. This gotta be exciting.  --> There will be a female Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey.   I can imagine guys falling in love with her....and finds out, much to their horror and at the last minute, she is not whom that they think. "Poisoned Honey" gave that away....But still, it is interesting to read.  --> One of the main characters, one of Harry's "fans" will die (not Ron or Hermione). The death will be "horrible to write."  Thank god it is not Ron or Hermione. Harry's fan? Pah! Colin Creevey springs to mind. And so does Dennis Creevey. Horrble to write? Oh my! I am imagining multilation at its worst. Ooopff!   Oh well. There ends my commentary. Read the rest yourself. Goodnight.

      Ha! You heard it, you saw it! Yes! My father didn't pay 4 months worth of bill, therfore, i was cut off from the internet world. How torturous! How heart-wrenching. How embarrassing. But why is this blog appearing? Because!!! Because my mother paid the bill for me! Thanks Mom! Thank you Thank you!  You know, these days, when I am not online, all I did was sleep. Yea! People thought I would study...but no! I sleep instead! I am turning into a lazy cat! Ahh!  I didn't beg for my parents to help me re-activate my account. I figured they didn't need the extra burden. And I figured that if they re-activate, they would tell me. Ahh.... I matured in that sense. I am proud of myself.  My friends leh.....they keep teasing me about not beign able to come online. Ha! I am online now! YaY! Anyway, they keep giving me advice on saving my parent's expenses, like sharing with my brother internet! There is NO WAY I can do that! I don't like to share. I want my own privacy, for goodness sake! Anyway, whatever la.   Today, something happened. I took a look at Hann's EL file. I saw the Spanish thingy about facial features and all that ("She got a sharp nose", "high cheekbones" and all that). Hann saw me, came over, and made a big hell of a fuss. He was saying something like me invading his privacy. Hello!!! And he prevented me from writing down the website address. Like must hide these things from me. What the heck! He wants to protect his own privacy, and his good EL marks. Damn the EL thingy! I have been unhappy about this since the banding. At first not so bad you know...he just hide stuff from me...and say something about Band 3 secret. I thought that time "what the heck? crazy!" But as the year progresses, he got more bitchy about hiding secrets, right until the point where he won't let me find out where he found his resources. I am damn angry about this. Isn't education supposed to be fair for all? Why it is reduced to such a pathetic stage, where everyone competes with each other, and almost lost their friendship because of silly competition? So what if you withdraw info from me? So what if you win me using this method? Isn't this what we call "unorthordox and unfair?" If you want to win me, win my by your own talent, your own hardwork, and not by withdrawing some silly Spanish phrases.  I hate it when silly competition does this! This is all what it does, doesn't it? Spoiling friendships and all that. Now, I don't want to point fingers, but I find this secret-keeping rather silly and pointless. If you got good things, why hide it? Why not share it? Based on "keeping originality"? If I am in-charge, I wouldn't allow this silly crap to happen. I can't stand it, frankly speaking. I know. I am making lots of people angry due to my comments. It can't be helped. I am venting my fustrations. I can't please everyone (I am getting sick right now of pleasing everyone! Control yourself, KY!). This is my blog! My personal diary! I have every right to write my own feelings in here! If you get angry, that's your problem. Take note that I didn't blow up in your face. That's another thing altogether. I hope this nonsensical secret-hiding-from-other-bands thing will stop! It's getting too out of hand!  Deep breath. Okay, I stopped venting my fustrations. That doesn't mean my anger has been dissipated. It's still there, alright. Okay....besdies that, nothing much happeend. Oh yeah, Wendy wrote 2 real nice poems! They are thought-provoking proses, and they make me smile everytime I read them. Hmm! Keep up the good work, Wendy!   Today's lyrics of the day shall be...nothing. Nah...not really in the mood to add lyrics. I was originally wanting to add "Back Here", but since it doesn't apply to this current situation, I discarded the idea. I am signing off le. Goodnight!

      So many things happened!  I read Hann's diary again! This time, he added his view about my hand being burnt. He said I planned this all along! I planned to burn the peg, and make sure Mrs Chew is watching, then reach over the flame to get another peg! I planned to get Mrs Chew's sympathy (Oh! Speaking of that! Mrs Chew asked me this morning, across 4/4, if I had developed any blister! Such a caring teacher!). The way he wrote his entry hor, makes me think that he is jealous. He is jealous Mrs Chew isn't giving him attention! Ahhh! Saw your motive already ar! Think I don't know! Anyway, he called me a sly old rat (he don't know how to spell crafty) and blacklisted me. Yeah. So I am getting cursed every night. Oh well! HeHe!  Then, at Physics, a terrible thing happened! Me, along with several others, were forced to stand up because we didn't bring Physics file. Sigh...stand at the back. But I stood next to Wendy's desk...so not so bad la. Can talk to her. Ha! Shr caught me several times talking to her, and glared at me. HeHe. Oh well! I feel like video-taping this cruel act leh... HaHa!   At CME, we did a election thingy, where we organise an election campaign for a MP. Our group used PVP (People's Voices Party) as the party name, and the nominated candidate is Tian Da Yip (crafted after Tian Da Hua of Holland V). So, in other words, I am gonna be the MP. YaY! Anyway, we had fun creating the particulars of the MP. However, there were some disagreements here and there. Yeah. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A PhD in ECONOMICS! I hate studying the economy. By the way, being an MP doesn't mean you have to know the economy lor! I rather study fun things. Like socialogy. Yeah. Even Tian Da Yip got a Masters Degree in English, and a Doctorate in Science (That's so fun! I think I am quoting chem facts at the election speech! Crazy KY cat!). And the goals for Woodlands, some of them are ridiculous! Like who will build a skyscraper in Woodlands? It should belong in the CBD for goodness sake! It would look odd, especially in Woodlands, a residential district. Sticking out like a sore thumb, I tell ya. The land should be used to build an animal's shelter for stray cats, dogs, hamsters, rabbits and all sorts of stray animals. I am gonna be the first MP to care about the animals. What a caring MP Tian Da Yip is! Ahh yes!  After that, basically is another boring day. Oh yeah! A-Maths! So easy! Especially so because we done it before. We shouldn't get anything less than 16 (Well, the second qns virtually nobody knows. So, oh well!). Anyway, went straight home in father's taxi after school.   Saw the doctor and everything (Completed Chem rememdial worksheet there and did those Phy qns that I know). After that, went to collect the flowers. Wendy and Yi Chun accompanied me, and they end up having to carry 10 roses back home each (Yeah, 10 roses for each of us. I am carrying the white ones, Wendy the blue ones, and Yi Chun the pink ones). Hmm...gonna put in the class early in the morning tomorrow, and cannot let the juniors spot us! Absolutely not! Anyway, the roses are in a bucket of ice-water for the night.   Hmm....I think I stop here liao la. Sorry if I sound very heated in the MP thingy. Guess I was kinda angry about having to "complete economics studies" and promise residents of Woodlands to build a skyscraper. Anger gets the better of me most of the times. Guess I should learn how to cool down a bit, huh? Okay...presenting today's song! It's from the Disney movie, MuLan. Yeah! Sing along! Come on!    Reflection - Christina Aguilera   Look at me You may think you see Who I really am But you'll never know me Every day It's as if I play a part Now I see If I wear a mask  I can fool the world But I cannot fool my heart   Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me?  When will my reflection show Who I am inside?   I am now In a world where I  Have to hide my heart   And what I believe in  But somehow I will show the world What's inside my heart  And be loved for who I am   Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection Someone I don't know? Must I pretend that I'm Someone else for all time?  When will my reflection show Who I am inside?    There's a heart that must be Free to fly  That burns with a need to know The reason why     Why must we all conceal What we think, how we feel?   Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?  I won't pretend that I'm Someone else for all time  When will my reflection show Who I am inside? When will my reflection show Who I am inside?     Ahh! Yes! What a nice song! Goodnight all!

However, it's raining now! How to buy dinner like that? So meowful! Sigh...see if the rain stops lor.  Ayioh! I got two ulcers in my mouth. So painful! Everytime I eat, drink, or speak...it will hurt me in a way or another. One ulcer is at the lower lips (probably bit it when i was sneezing. Another is at the base of the tongue. Don't even know how it got there. AHH! So painful!  Ahh!! I got paraffin poisoning! From burning a paraffin candle! I hate paraffin!

      Ahh! Sweet Saturday, or not.  Woke up early in the morning...Why wake up so early, on a Saturday some more? Well, because I have to get to Wendy's house to do homework! HaHa! Now habit liao. Every Sat go her house to do homework. Anyway, in case you are wondering, I ate some noodles (forgot name le) for breakfast.   Went to her house at 9.20, reaching there at 9.30+. Completed EL...my one and only homework there. HaHa. After that, watched MTV with her. Went home at 2+, after making a few trips back to her house to borrow a candle from her and return her the FF CDs. HaHa!   Basically, did nothing at home. Okay okay...I cleaned my room. Then, surfed the Net and chatted in MSN Messenger.  Today, while watching the Channel 8 news, I saw a shot of the Combined Schools Choir singing. Ahh! Still the same old vest, except different colours! I was reminded of my first (and maybe last?) NDP performance. That was being part of the Combined School's Choir. Yeah! That was such a fun event! I still remember!   Riverside Sec was selected as one of the schools for Combined Choir, along with other 10+ schools. I was Sec 1 then (Woah! Sec 1 so involved already ar!!). I remember we have our first rehearsal at Ah Moy Quee Camp. It was inside the hall, and boy, it was very crowded. We met our conductor, Angelin Manvoanjthan Paul (How I know? Because last time, I went to the NDP website, checked out her name, and found her address and telephone number using the phone directory! HaHa!) and our choreographer (dunnoe her name le!! But she's quite famous!). We sang songs and practised the dance steps of the first song there. Subsequent rehearsals were held at the SAFRA (dunnoe where) camp. We got our props and costume around June (was so excited!), and by then, we moved our practice venues to under some bridge near the Padang. In the evenings, we would go to the erected stands built on the Padang to practise. We have to memorise the dance moves, when to use the props and how, and the song lyrics. Our first performance was during the NE shows, where the P5 kids went (My primary school was there! Mr former form teacher, Mr Shah, was there too! Woo-hoo!). Then, we moved performed in the Preview shows, and finally, moved on to the actual NDP itself! Did I tell you they provide sucky dinners? Yes they did. Their dinner not nice one! Once, I saw the vegetarian one nicer, so I picked the vegetarian one the next rehearsal. But!! But!!! It turned out to be disgusting, and the non-vegetarian one turns out to be nicer! Purposely do that to me one, those people!   HaHa! did I forget to tell you that I was yearning to go on TV? But in front of me were two VERY tall guys. Ergh! Darn!! Hate them, because I overheard them saying that they join choir because they were forced to. How sucky. Anyway, the final day (8th august) arrived! Woah! So exciting! So nervous! I felt proud, to participate in the NDP. Yeah. We sang songs for the pre-parade segment. PCK and his family came (they were the hosts for that day)..blah blah. Then, at 6, the camera started rolling! Oh my!! It turns out that it mananged to capture Shuet Ling! Oh my!!! And when I played the recorded tape back, I can see CQ, and the two boys in front of me, and somebody waving the scarf behind the two boys. Ahh! So embarrassing! I was hidden! Ahhh! Anyway, sang finished le...sit back and watch the show. Woah! Well, not really woah la! See so many times le...so boring already. Chatted with CQ, Alan and my senior (Forgot name le!! Ahh! But I know he wanted to be a psychiatrist. I even gave him problems to solve on the bus trips to the Padang! HaHa! Okay! Update: His name is Jian Chong.). We held up the cardboxes, forming a picture of a keyboard and the mouse. At the end, we sang our last and final piece, Singapore Medley. After the NDP, the choir went wild! We began dancing around, and some of us even went down to get the signatures of the artistes down there (like the who Wendi Koh, PCK, Sharon Au they all). I could never forget this day. Everytime I see the Combined School Choir performing, I would feel extrmemely jealous. In 2001 and subsequent years, they sat on velvet cloth, while we sat on wooden benches, Last year, their props were fabulous, and the guys get to welcome Sun Yan Zi. Me and CQ felt so jealous! HaHa! They even got a cool fan. Okay KY..stop it! In conclusion, I must say, the whole thing, from rehearsals to performances, is a totally fun, enjoyable and memorable!  Anyway, today's lyrics shall feature one of the songs featured in NDP 2000. It's an oldie, but hey! Who cares, right? Sit back and sing along!    Cartoon Heroes - Aqua   We are what we're supposed to be Illusions of your fantasy All dots and lines that speak and say  What we do is what you wish to do   We are the color symphony We do the things you wanna see Frame by frame, to the extreme  Our friends are so unreasonable They do the unpredictable All dots lines that speak and say What we do is what you wish to do  It's all an orchestra of strings Doin' unbelievable things Frame by frame, to the extreme One by one, we're makin' it fun  We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh - oh - oh We are the ones who're gonna last forever We came out of a crazy mind - oh - oh - oh And walked out on a piece of paper  Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian Welcome to the toon town party Here comes Superman, from never - neverland Welcome to the toon town party  We learned to run at speed of light And to fall down from any height It's true, but just remember that  What we do is what you just can't do   And all the worlds of craziness A bunch of stars that's chasing us Frame by frame, to the extreme One by one, we're makin' it fun  We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh - oh - oh We are the ones who're gonna last forever We came out of a crazy mind - oh - oh - oh And walked out on a piece of paper  Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian Welcome to the toon town party Here comes Superman, from never - neverland Welcome to the toon town party  You think we're so mysterious Don't take us all too serious Be original, and remember that  What we do is what you just can't do   What we do is what you just can't do What we do is what you just can't do What we do is what you just can't do What we do is what you just can't do  We are the Cartoon Heroes - oh - oh - oh We are the ones who're gonna last forever We came out of a crazy mind - oh - oh - oh And walked out on a piece of paper  There's still more to come And everyone will be Welcomed at the Toon - Toon Town - Town Party    HaHa! Yep! So fun, that song! People who loves cartoons will like this song (I think!). Goodnight all!

      Back to school le! Loads of interesting things happened. Okay, not really loads, but definitely interesting.   First of all, I smiled, real big, when I was walking towards the study area. Long time no see my close friends le. CQ, WQ...not forgetting SL, Gloria they all! Was so happy to see them. HaHa. I siow one. That's what 2 days of MC made you become. A friend-sick lonely cat.   Later, Hann came up to the hall. HaHa! Long time no see him le! He smiled at me lor.... (are you imagining things, KY?), obviously happy to see me.....Knew from some sources that he got lonely sitting next to an empty chair for 2 days. Ayiah...he siow siow cat one. Later in the day, he would say something about sitting next to me is annoying. Zhui Ying Xin Ruan! A fun cat all the same!   Oh...let's fast forward to recess. Didn't eat there. Why? Because I am afraid of vomitting out my food. They all say I am lsoing weight (jian fei).....Ayiah! I do feel hungry lor...especially if I didn't even get to digest my lunch and dinner yesterday! Look at the previous entry for a very detailed narration on my vomitting process (HeHe! Quite proud of that leh!). But also kinda true la, if you come to think about it. Not eating is "jian fei"ing indirectly. Why indirectly? Because it is never my intended reason for not eating. Ha!  Then, got E-Maths test! I tell you ar! I sucks at that topic (Trigo and Bearings).  There's a question on Repanzel, her length of the hair, her prince, her tower, some dragons and line AB. Try to fit these together and see how you can come up with a Trigo/Bearing question! I only knew the first part (Ha! Dunnoe correct or not also!)...then I drew a Repanzel cartoon on the foolscap. HaHa! Found out Hann did the same thing also, because he sucks at that topic too, and dunnoe the question. No wonder Radha told me, "You are very strange lately. But you are under the influence of this boy (Hann)..I know!". HaHa!   I read Hann's journal! Ayioh...found out a lot of his inner feelings. I really depise THOSE kind of people. Come one lor! There's nothing wrong with Hann. I find him funny, cute, homorous, and a very good friend. If people thinks otherwise, then there must be something terribly wrong with them. Especially THOSE people.   Okay...chem practical. One major accident happened! I burned myself while reaching out for that test-tube holder. I didn't know the flame is there....and my arm came into contact with the flame. Mrs Chew was there. She quickly stopped me and made me wash my arm under running water. Yeah..she was so concerned with my arm. HaHa! Yeah......was touched la. She sent Hann down to get ice.....In the end, only suffered just a burn in the surface. Not serious one....because I got my hand away in time. Mrs Chew said she heard my arm burning and was so scared. I saw some black dots on my skin, but washed off easily. Actually, I don't know my skin came into contact with the fire lor, until Mrs Chew yelled then I realised that my arm hurts. I very strange one. Mrs Chew said that a girl was also like me....reach out for something but was burned by the flame. She wants to move the test tube rack to the side, but forgot. I think she'll remember next time. Or I go remind her la. For the safety of everyobdy. HaHa.  I was so being teased at after the burning incident. Don't know why also, but they say I 'shu ma' (born in the horse year). Hann made a hilarious statement by saying that I knew it beforehand that I was going to get burned, becuase I plotted the incident before practical. The reason why I didn't eat was because I can scream more painfully when being burned. HaHa! So funny man! Then, in the Lab, while preparing the ice for my injured hands (Thank you, Hann!), eh said, "Don't think you can get into my diary by doing this ar!" HaHa! Later he said, "Okay, i am going to write about you!". :) Such a crazy funny cat!  After that, went to the Causeway Point to order the flowers, which I am gonna pick up on Monday. O.o O.o The florist says there is a big bunch of flowers. HaHa! Imagine that! Anyway, we brought sweets (my beloved $4 ar!! And I can't even get to eat them....HaHa! No la! Sure will have extras one. So can eat after they wrap up. HaHa!). I put them in the fridge back home, and labelled it "For Choir. Don't Not Open!"!! HaHa!   Anyway, at the Value Shop, i have a sudden urge to buy sour plums. Then CQ said "ni you le" (I got le! Got what? Ayiah! Pregnant la!)!  HaHa! Then I pretended for the rest of today, I am a "yun fu" (pregnant woman) whose husband abandoned her after he got wind of her pregnancy (which is just a few days...how she know she's pregnant? Because she missed her period yesterday! I am so meow meow!), so now the "yun fu" have to work as a waitress to support herself and the children. When walking past a clothes shop, we saw a maternity dress displayed! CQ said I should wear that, but I flatly refused and said, "No! I look fat in it! And I am only a few days pregnant!" Then, I made CQ say what sex chromosome is the male sperm carrying (X or Y. Read up on your Bio lar, if you dunnoe!). He chose my baby to be female. So female it shall be! HaHa! Maybe I will carry on the act. Or maybe sometime later, when I got tired of acting preganant, I will "miscarriage" (opps! there goes the baby!) or I will say it is a false alarm, because my period came back. HaHa! See! I am so pervertic!  Hmm! Dunnoe what to say le. So funny ar, today! Me-ow Meow! Goodnight all!   **Current update: The zygote-that-is-undergoing-mitosis (okay okay...the un-developed foetus) wants to eat instant noodles. The mother can't, because it contains chicken essence. Anything to do with chicken is a big no-no, uinless the mother wants to cough for eternity. Sigh...when a woman gets pregnant, she will have sudden weird cravings for food. Or it is just a figment of the imagination....maybe there's no baby. Who cares! Right now, the zygote-undergoing-mitosis wants instant noodles!

      You might find this over-whelming, when you get to read 3 entries of the same day, especially when I don't normally post 3 entries under the same day. But hey...what can you do when you tkane leave from school due to sickness and at that particular moment, disaster choose to strike. Maybve this is arranged, pre-destined. That I stay at home and help out manage the crisis (by typing the letter in my computer...nono...my brother don't know how to type letters, and his command of EL is too poor to edit mistakes. And no...I am not insulting him. This is the fact. Get used to it.). Universe does have a way to work things out.   Speaking of illness, I just suffered the consequences of violent coughing, which I have experienced too many times for my comfort. Besides my stomach aching when I cough, now I can't even get to digest my food. Yes. Due to my violent coughing, my food can't reach my stomach. The force keeps propelling the food upwards. So, they stayed in the oesopghagus. And sometime later, you will have to expel it out.  Yes. Major Eww....That's what happened to me. I vomitted out my food. And let me tell you. Vomitting is no fun thing! First, some signs will appear telling you that you are about to vomit. One of them is like vomitting air out when you are coughing. That's when you know. Yes. Major discomfort. Then you proceed to the toilet to vomit. Your throat burns horribly as you churn out the food. Your mouth feels horrible as you taste your chewed food, and sometimes, the acidity of the HCl in the stomach. Your stomach will fold inwards, causing much discomfort. The rush of food and liquid coming out of your mouth is over-whelming. After you force all your food out (and flush the toilet), your throat feels stuck and burning. And when you try to take in food, it burns you. It pains you. Every muscle around your chest captivity hurts. And no, I am not exaggerating all these. I experience all these just now. So don't roll your eyes. It could happen to you. Now, I feel like vomitting out my dinner, trying to control. Now I seriously disgust you, haven't I? Now go on...go to the toilet and vomit. I will be waiting here, don't worry. Oh! In case you are wondering, why am I being so disgusting today? Because something compells me to. Don't ask why.  After the major barf session, I am back. And there's where I am gonna end off. See you guys around. You people better hope I get well soon, or I am going to come back with more disgusting tales to tell. HaHa. Goodnight.

      Damn CityCab! How dare they! They are not re-newing my father's license. Yes! You heard it! They are firing my father? Why? Because "of your adverse accidents/serive records"! What the fuck! Accidents? Services? For 14 years! My father has only received one complaint, and that was ruled in my father's favor. How dare they bring that up again! And the accidents! My father was clear of all charges too (the current one is still pending)! How dare they use it against my father! They are biting the hand that feeds them! Everyday, my father pays $40 of rental (sometimes $80 when the relief is not working!)! $40 goes into their pocket everyday....That's $14,600 every year! Those ignorant fools! Those ungrateful idiots!   We are, of course, not going to sit here and hurl abuses at them. We have already written a letter of appeal of the Ken Tan, chief operating officer (This is one time in my life where learning how to write formal letter comes in handy). My father is going there to hand the letter in. Okay, current update: The Ken Tan told my father "Don't worry. I speak to the head about it. We will try our best to get a new taxi for you. We will let you know latest by next Monday." Phew! That's at least something. My anger has been dissipated..sort of. At least the appeal letter is working on Ken Tan. I wonder if it works on the head cat. Or I wonder if Ken Tan is saying that to console my father. CityCab is known be to "slow".   But whatever! If they reject the appeal, me and my father are going to the "Meet The Residents Session" on 1st August, asking our MP to do something about it! This is unfair action against my father! We have been treated with injustice! I must see something done! Or else...the Yip family is going back to the Stone Age. Yes! It's that worse!   They better let my father have a new taxi! They better! They had to!

      Oh look! I am still at home!   I decided, along with my mother's and friends' advice, to stay at home and rest for another day. I am missing a lot of things, like ting xie, chem practical (how did it go ar?) and the audition thingy. Well, I regret NOT going to the audition thingy..but oh well. Now, 4/5 should be having EL...haha..I wonder what Thong is saying now (right..your oral marks ar..I promise you on Monday, right?). And I realized that I missed my friends. Oh my!! I am forgetting how they look like! Don't exaggerate, KY!   Today, I woke up at 8.35. Wee! I felt so much better, except my throat still hurts. Bathed and my mother went to the market to buy household needs (and our breakfast). Stupid new cordless phone almost drove me back to illness. Stupid phone won't show the timing. How lousy! Came online, attended GypsyMoon's meeting (which is a rare chance to!), had fun.   Ate  siew kueh  at 10 something, after that, read the third installment of Silver RavenWolf's books (To Light A Sacred Flame).   Ayioh! My father is supposed to change his 7-year-old-taxi next month, but the company won't let him now. Why? Because they said my father is involved in too many accidents! WHAT? Only 3! And two of them are not his fault (CityCab verified so)...the third is still "not ascertain". Phooey. My mother have to submit the accidents thingy printed from the CityCab website to the MP for dunnoe what reasons. I hope our MP (Dr Tony Tan) have fair judgement! Which includes ruling in favor of my father, because the accidents are not his fault (He was banged into, for goodness sake!). If we don't get a new taxi, I will personally wage a war against our current govt and WILL not elect for them...when I get the chance to vote, that is (Sembawang GRC is always a walkover! Darn those scaredy-cat opposition! I remember when I was staying in Ang Mo Kio, my parents went to election once. And I was playing in the exercise stations outside the secondary school while waiting for my parents to vote. HaHa.).  Or I will not. That's too immature. Ayiah..whatever la!!! I wish my father gets a new taxi though. The old one is sucky. Every month, at least once, he would have to send the taxi to repair. Always. Lousy old taxi.   Anyway, I am writing until here le..Tata!

      I am beginning to feel that eating is a terrible waste of time. I hate eating when I have a blocked nose. What good is eating when you can't even taste the food? Well, this might be the best time to put all those disgusting stuff inside my food....since I can't taste them, I won't vomit it out. Of course, I wouldn't eat it because I don't want that stuff to enter my digestive system. I am going way off point here.  Oh yeah, back to the topic. After writing my earlier entry...I surfed around aimlessly. Then I did the things Tsung asked me to....blah blah blah....printer no ink...A Drive something wrong. Switched off computer to eat my tasteless lunch. After that, came back, printed (brought new ink tank), saved and switched off the computer.  I fell alsleep the whole afternoon. Was rudely waken up by my idiotic brother to drink my medicine. Put me in a damn bad mood. Then, I found out my father redeemed another cordless phone from Shell. Ate yet antohet tasteless dinner. Read finished the second RavenWolf book and watched Holland V. Now online.  Tomorrow got ting xie. And Chem practical. But I am still feeling sick. If i go, I might avargrate (dunnoe how to spell la!) my illness, and I certainly don't want that. Also don't wanna go because I am still feeling weak (heck! all this typing already made me weak), but tomorrow got chem practical and ting xie. I don't want to take ting xie outside the classroom, and also miss a valuable chem practical. Sigh..Wendy and WQ told me to rest at home to re-cuperate. Don't know la. See tomorrow first lor...if I am still feeling weak or not.  Sigh..I ending off here le...Goodnight.

      Ergh. You noitced that, of course, yesterday there was no entry. Why? Because I am down with a serious bout of flu.  I kept sneezing and sneezing in class today. More than 32 times...yeah. WQ stopped counting after 32. I am so horrible. During Chem remedial, I felt so weak. My brain hurts. My body's on fire and I got a runninmg nose, to top that. Ergh!  Once I reached home, I took a bath. Then, I laid my history homework in front of me. I felt so sick. I don't wanna do, but if I don't do, I have to do it today. And I don't wanna do homework today, so I tried to do it. After defining 2a's topic, I fell alsleep. Father came home...blah blah....said a lot of unpleasant thngs..blah blah blah...went on sleeping.  Woke up to eat dinner. After that, I tried to do history...can't think straight...so fell alsleep. I was woken up on a number of times, from SMSes and phone calls. I took a look at my homework, and fell back alseep, no mood to do. At 9 something, was woken up by Ben's call, asking me about computer sutff (Norton this and that affecting messenger...). Now, I felt determined to complete my history. The thought of doing it today scared me. And besides, SL and CQ wants to copy (okay, not really CQ..dunnoe la!!). Completed it within half and hour...anyhow scribble something that makes sense. After that, waited for mom to get home so I can ask to stay home today. SMSed Wendy...blah blah blah...Mom came home, and said I can rest today.  Can't sleep that night. Thorat hurts like hell. I can't be exposed to cold (cause I will feel terribly cold), but I can't do without the fan ('ll feel terribly hot). Managed to sleep la.   Woke up at 7+ with an even worse sore throat. My body hurts and I feel terribly hot. That's what happens when my immune system is waging a war against some stupid virus. Bathed, ate breakfast.  Went to the doctor. He said my flu is terribly severe. I am supposed to rest, but here I am, typing this. Don't want to rest la....can't fall alseep. Now I got a blocked nose, which makes eating a terrible chore. I cna't even enjoy my food! I guess I shall stop here...nothing much to write liao. Hopefully will write another entry tonight. See ya.

      Ah! Today's SFY! Wee!!! Let me narrate the day in detail!  Woke at at 4.45! After a whole night of turning and tossing around! Oh my!! Woke up, bathed, ate. Then I geled my hair and applied deodarant....HaHa. I went down at 6.15....and surprisingly, reached school at 6.35.   Woah! The choir room is bustling with activity! Girls are everywhere...being applied make-up, applying make-up, everybody is running here and there. We finally settled down at around 6.45. We warmed up, sang Irama. Before setting off, Miss Choo gathered us in a circle, holding everybody's hands. She said we worked this hard. We should be proud of ourselves no matter the result. We did a cheer of some sort. It boosted my spirits!   We got onto the bus, and there,. the journey to NGHS started. I sat with CQ, and with my friends around. We gossiped here and there. Finally, I recongized the neighbourhood! NGHS is near! Everyone began feeling pretty nervous! We stopped in front of the school (thank god the driver knows how to go there!) and got down. We walked towards the school, and saw a choir gathered around in front of the Xiu Mei Da Hui Tang. Hmm....then we went inside the holding area, but before we did, I went to the toilet.  I tell you ar!! Thos horrible girls were laughing at us! Laughing at our costume! I felt so embarrassed! Such a lousy behavior! They should be ashamed of themselves!   Anyway, I went back to the holding room. Practice just started. We sang the songs a few more times. I felt happy. After we concluided practice, all of us started fretting about. Wendy was very very nervous, and so was I. I meditated..what a strange thing to do there...haha. After that, we chatted.   In came a choir! Their costume was terribly transparent. Ha! We finally found one school with lousier costume! Anyway, while they are filing past us, I commented loudly, "Why are there no boys? Is this a all girls schools?" and was shushed by so many people. What?! Cannot ask meh? We noticed a girl waering a different cosume. We thought she was the soloist. Anyway, we moved on the final holding room!   Ahhh!! Suddenly, my throat became terribly constricted! I think it is the nerves! I drank some water.....and felt better! Very very nervous at that time....! Then,Mr Low announced it's our turn! OMG! It finally arrived! The moment I have been waiting for. We filed into single rows, and moved towards the Xiu Mei Da Hui Tang. Ayioh! So nervous and exciting! I lead my row into the stage. I walked pretty fast..HaHa. But we settled down. Then came Miss Choo. The announcer's voice said, "On the stage is the choir from Riverside Secondary. Their choice pieces are: 'Three Ways To Vacuum Your House' and 'Ba Jun Zhan'." And, we began singing.  The set piece was kinda okay. Yeah, not much error made. But I made a terrible error! I was breathing, very obviously, after each line. My shoulders were heaving up and down! Oh no!!!! My feet is uncomfortable...very!  The Three Ways arr!! Was kinda fast in a way, but I still find it okay. My breathing nervousness subsided. Yeah, that's a good thing. I was smiling.  Ba Jun Zhan is a total dissappointment. I thought that this song is our best, but it turned out to be the worse. The speed became terribly fast, and Miss Choo have difficulty slowing us down. She told us that during the main part, the Sops slowed down, and she had two different speeds to control. The Sop 1 ended slower two notes than us, which is very obvious. And Bright didn't come in for the second part. He lost timing, and Miss Choo didn't cue him in. Miss Choo was glaring at him at that time, but he sang well for his last part, so that's a good relief.   We ended..just like that! So fast! The NG's choir was applausing rather politely for us (I bet their are laughing their heads off! Hui Min overhead them saying they can't hear the lyrics of Ba Jun Zhan clearly.). We sat down to watch the next 3 choirs.  Woah!! The choir after us, CHIJ (forgot what comes after next le) choir was like totally damn expressive. They had becautiful smiles on their faces, and they were moving. Their conductor was funny too. He kept kneeling down and conducting! So funny. We noticed a Chitra-lookalike. She was very tall, and also damn expreesive. She kept moving about! Oh my!! And the girl we thought who was a soloist? Well, she turned out to be a page-turner for the pianist! Oh!!! We thought they would get gold for sure.   The second school, Tanjong Katong Secondary, was terribly brilliant! They have so many boys! And oh my! Their bass voices added so much depth into the set piece! Oh my! They used an SATB score, I bet! Their choice peices were wonderous as well. What suprised me most is that the boys held up silvery sticks and struct them together in the middle of a song. Woah! Way way cool! (If only we can bring a real live vacuum cleaner to perform during Three Ways!) Another gold recipient, I bet. After hearing these two choirs, we felt really inferior.  However, the last choir is a seabreeze machine itself! From dunnoe what secondary school, they manages to produce a hell lot of seabreeze. Their voices were very airy. The boy's voices sounded very constricrting! Ha! Even I don't sound like that! We felt confident again!! YaY! (Kelvin Yip! Cannot like that ar!)  After that, we came out of the Xiu Mei Da Hui Tang and took a lot of photos. After waiting for some time, the bus arrived! We are on our way home. We felt quite dejected la, frankly speaking. Oh well.  We reached school at 11.30 and after taking our belongings from the Music room, went down to eat. We ate till 12.30, where we went back to class. Wendy started crying, because she missed choir. I think the juniors felt really appreicated.    Lessons went on......blah blah blah...I learnt I got highest for Chem (YaY!) and there's another Chem test on Alcohols, Organic Acids and Esters next Thursday. Oh well! History remedial went on as usual And YaY! My article was selected for the book thingy! YaY!   After History, we stayed back to know the results for SYF! What a long wait! We waited from 3.30 to 5.30. Miss Mala told us at one point that the award doesn't matter, as long as we learnt something from it and became a better person. I felt really appreciated! At 5 something, Mdm Harn called Mr Low, but he swtiched off the handphone. At 5.30 or so, Wendy called Low and was able to get through! We found out that....we got.... BRONZE ! I was momentraily happy. Then, PeiYu mentioned that Miss Choo is gonna get sacked, and we became quite sad. We went to the HOD door and knocked on it. Miss Mala came out, and we shouted that we got Bronze. She congratulated us and after hearing from Wendy that a lot of schools got COP, she congratulated us further! Then Harn came out and we again, screamed at her that we got Bronze! Mr Low then called and told her that the competition was quite stiff! A few lucky schools got Bronze, Silver and Gold. Surpirsingly, CHIJ got silver. Woah! So, getting Bronze shows us something about our standard. Mdm Harn reassured us that Miss Choo is NOT gonna get fired (good! Because the choir would be protesting if she did!), because the school is very happy with her performance and want to continue with her! YaY! We went home from then on. I felt happy la. We got Bronze, better than a losuy COP, and we get to keep Miss choo. Suddenly, I felt Bronze is a very good result. Who cares about the school's expectations? they are silly and impossible anyway. As long as we did our very best.....  Wendy and PeiYu massed smsed everyone. One of the things that came to mind was that people were more concerned about the sacking of Miss Choo when they learnt we got Bronze. This shows that Miss Choo is very important to us, and is a very very good teacher! Thanks Miss Choo, for being the best conductor and teaching us lots of wonderful things!  Ahh..write until here la. This blog is very very long! Don't wanna paste lyrics today. Ahh!! Goodnight all! Bronzy Bronzy Bronze!

      Woah! A lot go things happened today!  Firstly, I went to Wendy's house to complete my homework. Her brother was there, and so was her kao fu. Hmm, I did complete my homework. I found out that I played "su-ka-aaa-ha-ti" wrongly on the keyboard. HaHa! Her electronic keyboard got the "Birds" tune, so when I played that, Lassie began barking. So funny and cute! After that, Wendy watched her brother play FF8. HaHa! They have a 'fight'...kinda interesting! Was finding it very funny. Lassie barked at them (Wendy told me Lassie don't like violence! HaHa! Me too!!). Wendy later told me that I am the first outsider to witness them fight, so I should feel kinda honored. HeHe. Ayioh! I tell you hor! My block's lifts is very sucky, compared to Wendy's block lift. Woah...We live on the same floor ma. Her lift can reach there much much faster than my lift...the speed is very fast leh! And the lift's voice is nicer. It is much sweeter than my lift's one. So serious that voice. Ayioh! I am actually jealous of lifts! Oh my god! Okay, next we went to 888 to eat with her mother. Ate chicken rice and drank tea there. I was considering to buy the can of deodarant, almost want to buy, but changed mind in the end, making Wendy kinda exsperated! HaHa! Shopping with me can be very exsperating! Anyway, listened to Wendy's mom talk about life's lessons. Quite an interesting experience. HaHa!   After that, when I came home, I received CQ's sms, asking to wear costume there. I found out that he's borrowing one from Arman. Called Arman...he's checking for my size. Then, I made plans with Hann and Ji to go to Arman's house together. Arman told me he doesn't have my size, but his brother got, so I am going there to try on. Went to Arman's home and tried on several outfits before finally selecting a yellow baju kurong. HaHa. Came back home at around 9, and bathed, and here I am, writing this entry.   I am so excited and nervous! Oh my! Don't think I can sleep, but I need to sleep to make sure I won't yawn tomorrow! I can't yawn in the middle of a performance!! Ahh!!! So nervous!  I am continuing Part II here....it may be short la...ayiah! Who cares? Here it is! I give my warm wishes to our Riverside Choir! Good luck to all of you! May we win a award back, one that we are proud of. But no matter what award, as long as we give our best and more, we should be proud of it!     SYF (Part II) - Kelvin Yip   Dadang dari, Oh my god! Ting ting ting ting, Honorable awards we sought.  What to do? Except sleep early. Wake up with positve thinking, And don't look so surly.  First row, Second row,  Third row.  To applause we bow.  With grim determination, We can do it! With our effort, We can be the lead!  To our choir, Blessed Be. May good luck and success, Ensure thee.   So once again, good luck to all! Bye! Goodnight!   Countdown to SYF: 10 hours and 45 minutes!

      Ayiah....didn't complete homework today as planned! Spent like 4+ hours in Wendy's house, only managed to complete MT, Chem and one of the SS. I have only the SS and history source-based left. Gonna go to her house again tomorrow to do....haha! Her house is quite fun la! And there's Lassie! Cute girl, hor Lassie? HeHe! Today, we discussed a lot of topics...like seeing past the facade emotion of someone. I learnt that when ppl shows anger, they are not angry...it is just to cover up their true feelings. I am gullible, so that's why I suppose I get 'tricked' easily. Ha!! Tomorrow leh, both of her brothers are at home. Can get to meet her third brother at last....HaHa! Hasn't seen him at all.....Ha! I am very freakish, aren't I?  YaY! Everything is finalized! I am officialy in the SYF! Hurray! Hurrah! YaY! And hor...I will be leading the first row up the stage.....and my row is the last row to come up...so feel kinda nervous, like in the spotlight like that. Later I misjudge the position how? Then I end up looking like a silly cat. HaHa! And Miss Choo praised me today! Two times ar!!! One about my smiles and expression, the other about me showing my teeth during singing, which is compulsory to. YaY! I felt like I did an major accomplishment. When I sing the "tinggggg tingggg" part, along the first few lines of Alto 2...I felt myself resonating so wonderfully! I felt so pleased with myself that I smiled extra big, and made the notes go higher. Whopps!! HeHe! And I finally know how to play "la-gu-la-gu-su-ka-ha-ti....su-ka-aaa-ha-ti" (the last part of the altos!) on the piano! YaY! So excited! And nerve-wrecking. HaHa!  Ha! Today only 2 big paras. Too lazy to type everything le! Will type a long blog tomorrow.....yep yep! Right now, presenting another poem! This is dedicated to our choir! Good luck to you on Monday!     SYF (Part I) - Kelvin Yip   Oh great god (or goddess if you like)! SYF is drawing near!  I got in (hurray!)! And there's so much to fear!  Will we get a silver, or a coveted gold? Or just a low COP, that will just turn into mold?  Worrying for myself, And not to mention our soloist, Miss Choo's worried alright, If he got Ba Jun Zhan's gist.  Ohh look at me! Screams Miss Choo. Open your mouth and show your teeth, She hopes we do well too!  Don't be nervous,  Don't forget to smile. Just enjoy the music, And we will win by a mile.   Irama Belia; Empat penjuru. Three Ways; Cu cu ru cu cu.  Ba Jun Zhan; Li Xiang De Jun Ma Yo! If we sing them correctly, Our marks won't be low!   I will continue with Part II tomorrow! See ya all! Goodnight!

      Finally! Finally! This whole mess...this whole thing....has been resolved. All thanks to a particular someone. :D! I owe you big time!  Everything has concluded properly. It ended quickly. I basically told X why......I don't know whether he gets the idea across or not. Who cares?! Right?  I just realized, that this is the first time, I cried because of a broken frienship. Yes.....probably because this is one of the most treasured friendships I had. And silly old me was crying while singing Sarah Brightman. Can you imagine it? Crying and singing at the same time? I am a siao cat.   I am glad this whole thing turned out very well. Can you imagine? 5 days of not talking to X? Sounds pretty torturous if you ask me. Ahhh.....I can get a good night's sleep le. A good good good night sleep. Goodnight.

      I feel like a useless fucked up asshole. I can't even handle simple things!  I messed up this time. Really darn messed up. I started this whole stupid mess. If I hadn't been so angry about it....  I dunnoe......I simply don't know lor! I am to be blamed, but X is not faultless either.   What the fuck. Listening to Sarah over and over again.....trying to soothe myself, I guess.

I completed Bio TYS, but there's an addition of homework. We now have Chinese workbook to do! Oh my!!! Oh well, I got 5 peices homework to complete at Wendy's house. Oh well....luckily Wendy. She doesn't have History and she completed her SS worksheet. So, she only got 3 homework to do. Meow Meow! Whatever it is (oh my! the RJC Miss Phua!  Whatever it is, where are my articles ?), we will be playing PS games there...and hopefully not fall alsleep there agian...so pai seh! :P And Yay! I can meet Lassie again! Cute dog!  Me-ow meow!  Hmm..today, I flew into a rage, because of X's idiotic curses. I don't care! I am going to SYF; living, healthy, sick or dead.   Today's EL oral was...erm...dunnoe what to say la. I saw the significance of the coffin...kai guan fa cai (open the coffin and you will get rich). HaHa.....dunnoe la!! I sae Tsung wrote "too tense" in his comments. Ha! Oh well...

      Hmm...I am so worried. There's a lot of homework to do! SS and History source-based, Chemistry, Biology TYS and who knows what else tomorrow. Luckily, those that arn due on Monday need not be passed up on Monday, becuase I got SYF (If i look at Miss Choo in the eye on Sat. Wendy says she's only barking (she doesn't bite), but I rather take Choo's words seriously. I care too much about SYF! I don't want to lose it just because of silly non-eye-contact!). Die la!!! Cannot! Must finish by Sunday! Everything....I think I am gonna do my Bio later. Meow Meow!  Been kinda worried for Wendy. She didn't come to school, most probably due to swollen eye or something. I messaged her, but didn't get her message back. Wonder if the M1 has sucky connections again. I do hope she's doing alright. Sigh...and I can't reach her at home....probably she's sleeping, or don't wanna talk or something. Ayiah! Dunnoe la......hope she's coming tomorrow!   Zhang moved on to another chapter today. Woah! So fast! And learnt new vocab.....I find this method quite useful, as I usually sucks at vocab, I can really learn the words this time. Hmm, and he said my reading skill was good (hao! hao!)! YaY! I am beginning to enjoy his lesson, haha! Friendly teacher, he is! Now I know why his students like him so much.  Ayioh! My left palm hurts. Probably sprained or something. Dunnoe why also. Hurts lor. Ayiah.....hopefully it wouldn't be hurtful enough on Monday. And oh yeah ar!! I found a way to counter high-fever! HA! Don't think you can curse me! I just place the thermometer at the tip of my mouth on Monday during temp taking. This way, the temperature would be much much more lower! I found out accidentally when Hann was saying I didn't place my thermometer deep into my mouth enough, so that's why I got readings of 36.1-36.4 for so many days! YAY! HA! Don'[t want me to go to SYF right? Curse me with fever right?! HAHA! I found a counter-curse! And I am going to SYF, like it or not! Lalalalala!   Oh yeah! I remembered today! My neighbour, whom I am quite friendly with, scolded me today! THAT AUNTIE AR!!!! I was singing while walking along the corridor, when she said, "Bu yao chao ke yi ma?! (Don't be so noisy can!)" WOAH! I hate people telling me what to do, and scolding me some more! I sang LOUDER and I kept saying "YAO MING OR! Everybody went out!!!" loudly. And I slammed the door shut 3 times! HA! Don't want me to be noisy right?! Then I will be more noisy! HA! You will learn that nobody ever dictates me to do things, and stop me from doing things I like to do. And those who does shall incur my wrath. Okay...you are probably thinking that I am a spoilt brat. I don't care what you think lor. I am like this one! Take it or leave it!   Oh well. I am posting the lyrics of the theme song for Digimon Tamers. However, although it is sang in Japanese, I am posting the English translation. You can go  urlLink here  to see the Jap lyrics.     The Biggest Dreamer - Wada Kouji   Wanna be the biggest dreamer  Running full speed through the both the future and the present   That's right, I've realized it, I forgot to do my homework  That's one puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, "Who am I?"    Even if I slide and skin my knees  I've gotta stand right back up, I know my chance will run away     Big and bigger, biggest dreamer!  Dreaming is the start of everything, that's the answer   I'll fly farther than anyone, through all the tomorrows   Fly to the horizon, our courage has gained wings  In order to grow big and strong, I'll run too   For a long time I've heard the count down  I'm prepared, let's start now, change into zero!    Big and bigger, biggest dreamer!   We've gotta believe, disappear into the twinkling instand   I'll run, not turning away from my heart's target, with all my strength     Big and bigger, biggest dreamer!

      If you are looking for X's news, I still don't know. Seriously. I am a useless arse. Can't even do well in basic friendship.  Today, I attended Zhang's class. He's a nice teacher...very nice lor. His students (the boys la) like to throw their temper a lot, so today, there was a "show"...with insults flying everywhere. Luckily, Zhang said, "If you don't want to study, then don't. Don't create trouble for those who want (obviously, us)." Oh! I feel so glad that I am at least looked after! He's a nice teacher, but gets angry when he doesn't get the respect from his students. His teaching method is almost like Du's, but place less emphasis on reading the text. We did the vocab today. Hmm, not bad la.  Today, I rushed to study Chem. Seriously lor. Later I have tution, and I don't have time. Let me see...Few People Prefer David Lee's Brain (Fuel, Petroleum, Paraffin, Diesel, Lubricating oil and Bitumen)! Okay...alkenes undergoes hydrogenation (adding of hydrogen to form alkanes), adding of reactive halogens and hydration (add water to form alcohols). And lots lots more. Why does the Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame when airhole is closed? Because it undergoes an incomplete conbustion due to the lack of oxygen. Soot is produced, which burns with a yellow flame. STOP KY! There is no such thing as methene, because there are no 2 carbon atoms to even have a covalent bond with. So, mathane comes form natural gas, which comes from the decay of vegetation. AYIAH! STOP LA! Isomers are different organic compounds with the same molecular formula. Okay Okay, I stop now. But I must tell you that the general formules are CnH2n+2 and CnH2n for alkanes and alkenes respectively. Okay Okay! Stop throwing rotten eggs!  Okay, due to time constraint, I cnanot post lyrics for the song. Even the cats meow. Goodnight! And good luck for the Chem test ar, Kelvin Yip, and so does the rest of you la hor.

      Today, I am not gonna talk about X. I am still confused. Very confused. Me and my confusion!  Ayioh!!! I am so scared!

Competition in Chem is very very intensive! I MUST ABSOLUTELY MAINTAIN MY TOP! and I will try to get 100% this time! I must!  Ayioh.....I just learnt that Hu's students go to Zhang's class, and Du's students go to Huang's class. I felt kinda terrible la. I don't know lor! I saw how much respect (okay, friendly) Zhang's students treated him on the bus today. I was kinda glad, becuase this shows Zhang is a very good teacher, so I need not worry. But what I am worried about is his students (excluding some la! of course!)! I am not very used to them la.....I don't know la! And who can I sit with? AYIOH! Don't know la! See tomorrow's situation la!  Ayioh! Today's an ayioh day! So many ayiohs! AYIOH!  Presenting now a song, much describing X's feelings.....Ha!    Are You Happy Now? - Michelle Branch    Now, don’t just walk away  Pretending everything’s ok And you don’t care about me And I know there’s just no use When all your lies become your truths and I don’t care... yeah, yeah, yeah   Could you look me in the eye  And tell me that you’re happy now,  ohhh, ohhh  Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased,  Are you happy now?

      Sigh. Well, I did do what I planned. And I didn't enjoy it one bit. I feel like the ultimate scumbag. I hate myself, but what really drives me on is my anger. Yes.... Many times, X talked to me, but I ignored X. Dunnoe what I am doing is right or wrong. Wendy said know when to stop. Many a times, I wanted to stop so badly, but again, my anger held me back. I just want X to realise that what X did was wrong. I deserve more than be treated as shit. I deserve much more! I don't know what I will do tomorrow. Stop or Give Up. I have no idea lor. How I wish X can read this, so X will know. Will X? Or will X not?   Moving on to happier topics, Wendy confirmed that the flowers are cheap...$6 for 10 roses! YaY! We have a new plan...that is sticking to our old pan, but each of us gives 4 roses to 4 juniors. HaHa. And hor! The meddling teachers! We cannot go down the water, cannot rent bikes, and must do all their planned activities. I dont' mind the last one, but the first and second one sucks! I want to rent roller-blades there! I want to go into the water! So terribly unfair. I say, we seniors stay back after the party to do what we like! HA! I am terribly rebellious.  HaHa! While walking home today, thunder roared and lightning flashed. We three (Me, Janet and Gloria) decided to do an experiement. After the lightning flashed, we count the time between the lightning and the thunder, and multiplied it by the speed of sound in air to find out how far the storm is away from us (distance=speedXtime). After that, we saw a lightning flashed across us. I counted till 2, then the thunder came. And it started pouring. Gloria said I am crazy, since the lightning is so near to us, count what distance. However, I found out that the storm is 660m away from us (330X2). HaHa! After that, Janet and I saw the lightning while walking back home, and counted again, this time, lasting till 9. So, the storm is now 2970m away from us. Ohh!! We are so crazy! But we recomend you to try it next time. HaHa.  Oh my! I feel a fever coming on! I must go to choir tomorrow, fever or no fever! I want to get into the SYF! I must! I shall! I want!   Today's song fitted my mood. I shall paste the lyrics here. Enjoy!    End Of The Line - Honeyz     All alone I wait for you As darkness fills this room I don't know why you ain't called Little things you used to do They're no longer part of you Seems you left them all behind  Well I can't believe what I'm going through This thing it just ain't right Your selfish ways How you carry on Somethings you just can't hide   [Chorus]:  If you want me to go Then say it Want me to stay Then show it Don't be afraid Oh don't break this heart of mine Now's the time if I'm right Then we've come to the end of the line     Seems like I can't do you right All I do or say is wrong All the smallest things critisize I deserve some damn respect Nothing more and nothing less  Don't pretend everything's fine Don't hold it back If it's in your heart Stand up and be a man Can't read your mind So I'll just say it loud I'm trying to understand   [Chorus]   Even though you've been doing me wrong I still care  Do you think that by treating me cruel That somehow I'd disappear  Baby I love you to much just to walk away Don't make me hate you  Baby you've got to be straight   [Chorus]    You have seen I highlighted the whole song. I feel every part of it is meaninful....the ones which I made italic are the real message I am trying to convey.....See ya tomorrow then.

      Today, I didn't publish "this" (refer to yesterday's entry). You are probably thinking  wimp  right? Nope. I was about to, determined to. Somehow, Wendy managed to convince me not to, stating it would show that I lack of a certain maturity doing things if I had done that. HaHa. Frankly speaking, I am very tired of all this! Extremely damn sick and tired of all this! I want it to end! I don't want to suffer anymore. Don't want to. I think, it all depends on X now. What X does will determine the outcome of this whole thing. I am washing my hands off. I am not going to change things anymore. I got sick and tired of doing that already. It's up to X now.   Today was pretty boring. Did the usual of watching TV in the morning, and I have been online since 11am.    Benjamin wants to borrow my Harry potter books. He said he would be coming over, and until now, he hasn't called. I am not gonna bother actually. If he wants my books, he has to come over and get it himself.   If you noticed, I didn't put my usual lyrics for the day. Well, I don't know lor......I should probably go expand my music industry first. Then I know what lyrics to put according to my mood and so on. And one good way to do that is download all the songs Wendy has put in her blog (as lyrics). And I should probably do that now. Meow Meow!

      Today morning, I felt murderous, VERY murderous! Me and Siva have the misfortune of living near Vincent, so we met him on the same bus. Now, he's a terribly annoying little idiot. He kept asking Siva really useless and insulting questions, like "Why is your name Siva?. Okay, he hasn't done anything...YET. But in the interchange, when the BUS arrives, I said, "Oh look! That's the long bus!" He go and tell me, "No! It's a vehicle! It has more than 4 wheels (I wonder who ingrained that idiotic fact into him!)"! I said angrily, "It's a bus! And don't you argue with a Sec 4!" and stomped up the bus. But's that's not all. After coming down from the B-U-S (BUS! People! It's a bus!), he continued bugging Siva about her name. Siva actuaully said in a pissed-off voice, "You stop bugging me and go away!" He actually didn't take the hint and continued annoying us, and almost made us get hit by a car. OHH!!! I feel like strangling him!  Oh yes! Today, I sang rather confidently. HaHa! And I felt I sang the correct notes, I think. Yeah...probably too much singing too much Sarah Brightman boosts my confidence. How strangely special. And today, Bright attempted to try the solo for Ba Jun Zhan....he's quite nice! Yeah, his deep voice really sounds nice. Okay, the best news so far is: They let us deicide where we want to go for graduation party! YaY! Finally!! YaY! Yesh! Now, must work hard to convince the big sheep to go.   I went to Wendy's house to do my homework (and to avoid a particular someone). Finished my SS and EL there, and then played there. I actually slept there, while watching SailorMoon halfway! Oh my!!! LOL! Can't believe myself man! After that, we played DDR...I sucks at the game la.....HaHa! Even with a controller! I am not a DDR-material, noperino! Anyway, her mother brought me a bread from BreadTalk. So nice of her! Thanks auntie! Oh yeah, I felt closer to Lassie....she's a cute dog.....what a cute dog! Good girl, Lassie! :)  Me-ow meow! I dunnoe whether I want to do this or not. Never mind what "this" is. I will see tomorrow's situation with X.....and if tomorrow there's no improvement,  then I will do "this". I am so crazy. Just ignore this para if you don't understand.  Gotta go le. See ya soon guys! Goodnight and sweet dreams!

      Hmm....today's quite a boring day la. Not really boring. Today, we only have to attend EL lessons, for us 4/5ers. Radha didn't come today, so we have 4 periods free. All the 4/5 have finished their orals, so we relaxed in MT lesson. So, technically, we only have to attend EL lesson. I did my EL homework in 2 of Radha's lesson and MT lesson, and played Dai Dee during MT lesson. HaHa. Speaking of MT, I am gonna miss Hu. She's so nice...kinda....but she's a good teacher! Yeah.....I dunnoe where I would end up in whose class....Let's just pray for the best. Anyway, back to the topic. In the last two periods, I went around collecting money for the Pasir Ris Park thingy...for the food lor. Most of them is paying on Monday...sigh.....I hope they pay up...or else it would be hard to explain to the auntie.   Later on, I went to the library to do my homework. I managed to complete A-Maths, and got started on SS. I hope to finish my SS and EL newspaper report by tomorrow. Yeah.   Okay, you know I told you before about me listening to "Time To Say Goodbye" before sleeping right? Well, now, I have a slightly modified habit. I only listened to Sarah Brightman's voice....why? Because I can sing her part. Yeah...very strange one. I can't reach Andrea's low notes. I keep singing along with her....but of course la...dunnoe whether sang correctly or not, but I feel I did. Who cares, really.  As long as I feel I am correct, I am correct.    HaHa...to get a clearer concept of what I am singing, or rather, crooning, to, I pasted Sarah's lyrics here. Meow Meow!    Time To Say Goodbye - Sarah Brightman's Part    Quando sono sola sogno all'orizzonte e mancan le parole, si lo so che non c'Ã¨ luce in una stanza quando manca il sole, se non ci sei tu con me, con me. Su le finestre mostra a tutti il mio cuore che hai accesso, chiudi dentro me la luce che hai incontrato per strada.  Time to say goodbye.     Paesi che non ho mai veduto e vissuto con te, adesso si li vivrÃ². Con te partirÃ² su navi per mari che, io lo so, no, no, non esistono piÃ¹, it's time to say goodbye.     Meow meow! Goodnight!

      Hmm! The photos were out....To tell the truth, I don't really like them. Too many spoilt pictures...oh, some were very okay la.....And i noticed that my legs aren't exactly the desirable leg-shapes...ayioh.....There's nothing like photos to bring out the worst in you. Hmm...tomorrow showing CQ they all.....meow meow!  Ayiah..I don't know what to do after this. Probably read my book. I am always reading. And I love to read.  Me-ow Meow!

      Weee! So exciting! Father's gone to collect my photos! Meow meow!  Okay okay...today's oral topic was quite on the easy side. The newspaper report was on eating too much slimming pills, thus the girl died due to kidney failure. I was very flustered on that topic...didn't really bring out the points I wanted to. But the second topic was much more easier...about how you deal with the failures in life. I was rambling on and on until the examiner said stop. Oh well....I didn't have too much confidence....oh well.   Me-ow meow! I don't know what to say le.....I will update this blog once my father comes back from getting the pics. See ya.

      Hmm......Die la die la!!! Not really, but I am kinda worried for my oral tomorrow! Thes two days' topics are so easy! I am so fearful they are gonna change it for Day 5. Hmm...I spotted an interesting trend. The news topic for both days...Hu Lau Shi mentioned them casually during her lessons..and they actually came up! Oh my! I am so gonna listen to her tomorrow! Well, it may be silly, but there's always a glimmer of hope, right? And yeah...Hu isn't teaching us anymore! Ayioh...now only two classes left...Huang's and Zhang's. I really wish to enter Huang's class. Not that I am insulting Zhang's standard...but I don't want to be in his class because of the students. I am very uncomfortable with them....have some bad experience with them....and they and mine personalities and attitudes doesn't match well. At least there is XC in Huang's class. Can sit near him. Yeah....And I hope me and Hann get in together...so can sit with him.  Of course Wendy....I would love to contribute to the idea of buying white flowers for the entire Alto 2 section. Sounds great...I ask Siva tomorrow during EL lesson. And ask CQ also...wait ar..I call him. Okay, he agreed to. YaY.   Ayioh...the Band 3 people got ice-cream today. That leaves us Band 2 and Band 1 4/5 students ice-creamless (except Arman, the traitor...Just kidding ar...). Well, I was saying the ice-cream is sour and fattening...because to tease Hann with. And also because I am jealous la.......Yeah..Call me jealous. It's just not fair!  Wendy, I owe you a huge apology...I shouldn't have pressed on, reminding you. I felt kinda guilty. But what has happened has happened. I dunnoe what to say....just sorry.  Dunnoe what song to end with today, so I shall present you with XC's poem for CME project. We know what inspired him to create such a beautiful poem, XC hor?    Passion - Ong Xiao Chuan   What is passion? Is it a seven-letter word? Or is it the fire that keeps us going?  What is passion? Is it nothing but a word in the dictionary? Or is it something that cannot be described By one word, phrase or language?  What is passion? Is it something material? Or is it something that cannot be seen?  Passion is like an internal flame Raging within each and everyone of us It is fuelled by interest, just like  Fire is fuelled by wood  Passion burns for eternity Never ceasing, never ending Sometimes weak, sometimes strong, Keeping us going  Lets fuel that fire, With interest and commitment. Lets make that fire rage, And let it burn strong.  Lets sparkle our lives, With fireworks of passion. Let us grow as the  Passion burns within us.   Meowing cats! Wish me luck for my orals! Goodnight!

      Meow Meow! Got 3 new prezzies today!   The first one is a big red Slyvester cushion from Hui Min, Amanda, Chin Quan, Wen Qiang and Xiao Chuan! Many thanks to you guys! So big and comfy! Mrs Jalil kept talkignt o me about the cushion. :) I brought it to History class, and she commented, "Afraid of the theft of Slyvester the Cat ar?" I sheepishly said, "No la!". HaHa. And Yit Hann commented that I like red things. My bag is red, the cushion is red, my specs are red! HaHa! Meow Meow!  The second one is a mug with "Happy Birthday" on it, given by Xue Lin, Xue Li and Su Ping! Thanks! I love it! So cute!   The third one is a yellow duck with a bracelet on it. On the bracelet were the words "KEL". This was given by Siva. Thanks a lot! I love the originality of it!   What a big disappointment today. Because the teachers complained of ECP being too far, they decided to move it to Sembawang park! WHAT A LOUSY PARK, compared to EC! Ayioh! What can we do there? There are no bicycles to rent, no nothing! Well, there's water...but it pales in comparison to EC! Why must the teachers come along?!! Ayioh!!! And they better BBQ there ar! Ayiah...I shouldn't be so complaining! At least they are celebrating for us. We should thank them at least, right?  Latest news - I lost my thermometer in the AVA room! Oh my!! I was like about to put it back, then Hui Min and Xiao Xi (Mui Cho) came in. Anxious to collect the Chem worksheets, I rushed out and forgot all about my thermometer. In the end, CQ's sister's friend found it. CQ's sister, Yan Ting, recongized it's mine and gave it to CQ. A million thanks to the three of you! Luckily ar!!!   Not so latest news - The Iranian sisters died due to excessive blood lost just after they have been separated. I don't feel sorry for them, instead, I felt happy for them. They said they want to go under the knife, just to have a chance to be separated, no matter the consequences. But, I believe they must be very happy now. They were finally separated at last. Rest in peace!   Okay, since I am feeling quite party-ish, I am gonna end this entry with one of Pink's songs. Start dancing!    Get The Party Started - Pink   I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started   Get this party started on a Saturday night  Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive  Sendin' out the message to all of my friends  We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz  I got lotsa style, got my gold diamond rings  I can go for miles if you know what I mean I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started   Pumpin up the volume, breakin down' to the beat  Cruisin' through the west side  We'll be checkin' the scene  Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast  I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my a** Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car  License plate says Stunner #1 Superstar   I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  Get this party started  Makin' my connection as I enter the room  Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove  Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat  Everybody's dancin' and their dancin' for me  I'm your operator, you can call anytime  I'll be your connection to the party line   I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started  Get this party started Get this party started right now Get this party started Get this party started Get this party started right now   Ooo! Goodnight all!

      YaY! Today's my birthday! I am gonna give a very detailed account!  I woke up at 7.30..because my parents want to bring my brother to the doctors to get his left foot checked. Anyhow, I ate chee cheong fun for breakfast. They left at 8.15. That means, I am alone for 2 hours. I went online. After checking mail and stuff, it was about 9 to 9.15. I was freakingly bored. I smsed Wendy (hehe..woke her up). Then WQ came online. At 9.30, she hasn't smsed back, so I smsed again...I was worried she couldn't get up on time. At 9.45, I still hasn't received any reply, so I called her. She was awake (phew!) and at 888. Hmm...obviously planning for my surprise but not telling me what. After that, I began searching for gel! Oh my! I can't find the thing! However, while searching for gel, I found a can of deodarant (which I suspect was my father's but I never seen him use it). Being adventurous today. I decided to try it later. Anyway, it took me 15 minutes before I found the bottle of gel.   Okay, at 10.15, I started preparing myself. I dressed up in my polo shirt (free gift from Shell) and jeans. I took a comb and went to the bathroom. First, I wet my hair and combed it the styl I want...I believe it was a right parting....more like center la. Don't care, but it looks nice. I applied gel for 10 minutes or so. Applied once...then came back and applied again and again, fearing the gel wasn't strong enough (HaHa! The bootle said used the gel sparingly!). Then, I used deodarant on myself . I applied it on my neck, face and hands. I am so crazy. The end product was my hairstyle looked totally different and nice, and I smell good. Okay, after fretting about, I finished at 10.30. I then waited for 10.45 to come. I kepy smsing and calling Wendy. I got no replies, so I called her house. HaHa! Reched her at last...she said "yi da qing zhao bei ni fan shi" (in the early morning being annoyed by you)! :P! Okay, at 10.45, I set off.  I reached Admiralty MRT at 10.55. Wendy came later, but when she saw me, she laughed herself crazy. She said my hairstyle looks nice and I actually look good in this hairstyle (blush blush). HeHe! We went to top up her IguanaMobile credits via AXS machine. I tried calling the NewAgeCircle to see whether they are open. We boarded the train at 11.00, and after a few minutes, I was able to confirm that they are open for business (yay!).  En route to Dhoby Ghuat, 11:22 came! Yes! The magic moment! My birthtime! I was officially 16 on 11:22am! I began frantically smsing everyone that I was born! HaHa! Received a flurry of smses....some asked the meaning behind my message....and almost everybody responded. CQ sent me a picture message! So cute! Wendy said I am crazy. HaHa.  Arrived at Dhoby Ghuat Interchange at about 11.35. The NEL part of the station is so cool! Got the sliding thingy...weee! It reminds me of Carrefour's elevators. We took the train towards Harbour Front (I told wendy H.F. was named becuase the place was in front of a habour...I anyhow create one! :P). We alighted at Chinatown station and walked a long way to Exit E. The elevators scenery reminds me of Toa Payoh, but Wendy said it resembles Raffles Place. We came out and there it was! Chinatown Point right in front of us! YaY!   We walked inside and went to New Age Circle. Renee was suprised to see us...and wished me a happy birthday! She mentioned that me and Wendy looked like siblings. Look like meh? No la where got! She said Wendy was the "Sunshine Girl" type and I was the "Bookworm" type! HaHa! Wendy is tanned la, bit like "Sunshine Girl". We shopped around, and I found out that what I wanted (not gonna tell you! Wendy knows though) was out of stock, but I placed an order on it. However, I brought a box for my tarot. YaY! And Wendy placed a reserve on something, using my 20% birthday priveleges dicsount. Yeah, you are welcome, Wendy! After buying our stuff, we went down to MacDonald's to eat a shared (and upsized) meal of Chicken McNuggets meals. HaHa! At the end, we had a competition to see who gobbled the last fries. Ayioh! I slipped and took 2 at the same time, violating the rules, so Wendy claimed victory! We then brought Hamtaro mashmarrows to eat. We set out on our journey back at 1+.  On the train journey back, we discussed a lot of things. Mainly were husband qualities she wanted....I found out she likes being independant from her husband...and her husband must be more successful than her. HaHa! Hope you find your ideal Mr Husband-who-hopefully-hates-kids-and-si-more-successful-than-you! :P :P!   We reached Causeway Point at around 1.35 or so...and went up the library to collect my presents from Shuet Ling. I was feeling damn nervous...probably because I dunnoe what they would say about my hairstyle. HaHa! They didn't say anything at first, but under Wendy's prompt, they said it was nice and different. SL gave me her present (shared by Joyce!) Thanks to both of you! And we left the library to go to Tom And Stephanie to buy Wendy's clothes. I was caught by Wendy, adjusting my hair in the mirror...Been doing that a lot! I feel kinda self-concious all of a sudden. Brought her clothes (she stuffed them in her pouch...woah!) and started making our way to Wendy's house. Yes yes Wendy...your beret looks nice on you...and I am saying the truth.  We reached Wendy's house at 2 something (I brought film!)...and was welcomed by her mother by wishing me a happy birthday! Then, cmae the surprise! Weee! It was a coffee cake! It costs $16 (what a link! $16 cake for a 16th birthday celebration!) What a surprise (even though I suspected all along, it was still a surprise!)! I loved it! Thanks Wendy and Wendy's mom! I loved the cake! We did the usual cake ceremony. I made a wish...cannot tell you, or else it cannot come true! I cut the cake. Wendy divided it into 4 parts...one for me, Wendy, Wendy's mom and Lassie (Wendy's dog). We ate the cake. I get to feed Lassie the cake. I have to make it into small pieces and let Lassie lick from my hands. HaHa! Quite disgusting actually..but fun la and ticklish. Lassie really licks my fingers clean. HaHa! And because I feed her...she keeps following me around! Good girl!  Okay...then we went to Wendy's house. I played the piano and read her books. I took one out to read--The Complete Adventures of Charlie and Mr Wonka. Then we went out to see her mother playing MahJong on PS. HaHa! I don't understand the game...about chi..peng..and all that stuff.   After her mother went out to pay the bills, Wendy switched on the Internet and I went on reading my book. But I found out ar..WQ came online ar! Say what study oral! :P Wendy let me watched two of her FF FMVs. So beautiful, and so nice! I ad-libbed to the Jap words..Wendy laughed and said "I can't believe you do all these!". Later, she improvised along with me! HaHa!

      YaY! I got my first prezzie today! It's a white cat plushie! Given by Janet, Gloria and Hui Ling. Thanks guys! I love the cat! So cute!!! I am naming it Glenda. The name just came to me while I was waiting for the LC to start. It reminds me of Glenda the good witch. Yeah. Meow Meow! And Hann says he's buying me another cat plushie to accompany Glenda. Oooo!  Oh yeah, speaking of LC ~glares darkly at whoever sets the paper~. It was horrible. It was sucky. It was idiotic. I am angry at myself actually. I didn't listen and comprehend clearly. I failed as a candidate. 'Nuff said.   Today, I rushed trhough my homework. I completed Bio TYS while accompanying Janet teaching Fong Wee (I even taught him about alcohols, carboxylic acids and metals for Chem). Coming back home, I did the MP thingy for CME. Then, I finished Chem TYS. After that, I completed History and SS worksheets (lukcily only worksheets!). Now, the only thing left is the CME project on RSS values. I have two choices....poem or journal. I'll have to decide and complete it tomorrow. Oh well.   Sigh. Oh well. I think I shall end this with a Jap song. It's the theme for the Jap Drama H.E.R.O. Enjoy.    Can You Keep A Secret? - Utada Hikaru   Chikazukitai yo kimi no risou ni Otonashiku narenai can you keep a secret?  * Hit it off like this, hit if off like this, oh baby  [Repeat * , * , *]  Koko kara zutto okutteru angou wo Kimi wa mada kaidoku dekitenai  Tsutaeyou yameyou Konomama kakusou Nigekirenakunaru made Shinjiyou dame da yo Mada utagaesou da mono  ** Chikazukitai yo kimi no risou ni Otonashiku narenai can you keep a secret?

      HaHa! Meow Meow!  I shall start on the update on the "Xiao Xi-Mui Cho" episode. Yit Hann came up with several theories. But I loved his last theory. It's the funniest. His theory was: Xiao Xi did not remember her past because Mui Cho fell down the stairs and damaged her cerebrum while trying to escape from prison. HAHAHA! So funny!   Okay. For the main topic of today, I shall elaborate on my weirdness. not really my freakiness. Just something which I discovered of myself. I tend to see things which I am not supposed to see. No No! Not ghosts....Let me explain. It started off with one incident. I was at a bus stop, waiting for 913 to come. That bus-stop have several buses stopping there. Anyway, one bus came. I clearly saw the numbers 913 on it. I boarded that bus. Then, the bus DID not go the usual 913 way. I got scared. I alighted at the next stop. Then, I saw the bus number. It was 954! Can you believe it? I saw 954 as 913? Another freaky thring. It happened on Wednesday afternoon, while I was eating my lunch. I looked up to take a breather and glanced towards the Indian drink stall. The plastic case was full of soya bean drink. I went back to eat. A few minutes later, I looked up. The plastic case became less than 1/3 full! I was surpirsed and shocked! They couldn't sell out so fast, not within the space of 1-2 minutes! I was quite scared of myself, frankly speaking. Siva said I am imaginging things. Wendy said that was my special ability. I dunnoe. Is this thingy good for me? I don't even know why I am seeing things. What exactly is the purpose of my "ability"? I dunnoe. But...I am quite excited la, to tell the truth. Call me a weirdo. I was initially scared la, (and still is) but I think this "ability" is cool. At least...not many people have that right? HeHeHe.   Okay, moving on. It happened recently. WQ asked me to  GUESS  again! I merely asked him how he can squeeze 84MB worth of songs into a 15MB storage space. And you know what he said?  GUESS!   I loathe, hate, dislike the word GUESS. HELLO! IF I AM SO GOOD AT GUESSING, WHY AM I EVEN ASKING QUESTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE? BECAUSE I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE ABOUT THE ANSWER! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GUESS?! USE YOUR BRAIN!  Okay, releasing anger over. And he keeps insulting my intelligence, comparing to his. I know, some people have very good GK. Some people knows  EXACTLY  where each and every one shpping center is located. Some people knows a lot about internet. Please remember that somebody doesn't. What I don't know doesn't make me stupid. I don't know because I haven't read about it, or is interested in it (Why should I be interested in the location of shopping centers which I don't even go to?). Remember that when you start to insult people on their lack of GK, and other things as well. Teach them, not insult them.   I do hope WQ gets the message loud and clear. Anyway, to conclude today, I shall now present you the theme song from Smallville!    Remy Zero - Save Me    I feel my wings have broken in your hands I feel the words unspoken inside And they pull you under... And I would give you anything you want, but no.  You were all I wanted  And all my dreams are falling down... Crawlin' around, and around...   Somebody save me! Let your warm hands break right through Somebody save me! I don't care how you do it Just stay! Stay, c'mon, I've been waiting for you   I see the world has folded in your heart I feel the waves crash down inside And they pull me under... And I would give you anything you want, but no  You were all I wanted...  And all my dreams are falling down Crawlin' around, and around...   Somebody save me! Let your warm hands break right through Somebody save me! I don't care how you do it... Just stay... Stay, c'mon, I've been waiting for you   And all my dreams are on the ground Crawlin' around, and around...  Somebody save me! Let your warm hands break right through me Somebody save me! I don't care how you do it Just stay... with me... I made this whole world shine for you Just stay! Just stay, c'mon... I'm still waiting for you       Goodnight!

      Today was funny!  Yit Hann brought his book along. It was about a local murder that took places years ago, involving a charlatan bomoh murdering kids for sacrifices. Anyway, they showed us the pictures of the guilty ones. One of them is the bomoh's wife, Tan Mui Cho. Yit Hann pointed to us she looks like Xiao Xi. And for the whole day, YH keeps calling XX "Mui Cho!". AFter recess. YH showed XX the photo. We all were laughing. YH said, "You are Tan Mui Cho right?! You changed your name right? I am going to tell the teachers, the principals. Call the police to come and catch you!" By then, I was laughing very hard. Then, he went to XX';s table, peered down and said, "You still dare to call yourself Baby Melon!" When he said that, I was doubling over with laughter. I was laughing so hard! And I saw Wendy doing the same thing too. Soon, I laughed until I actually cried. Oh my god! Yeah! Can you believe it? Yit Hann has that kind of effect on people. He's so naturally funny! He can make you laugh until you cry (Wendy also! She laughed until she cried!)! Boy, I am gonna miss him and his jokes next year! He's such a funny cat!  Meow Meow! Oh yes! We were informed that for our choir graduation, the choir is celebrating for us at East Coast Park. They are gonna organise a BBQ there! YaY! Now, I can do things I never did last time. Like renting roller blades. Like swimming in the sea. I am like so totally excited about it! YaY! And BBQ too! I never been to a BBQ before. Seriously! I am so totally gonna stay there till nighttime! Wee-hee! But, do you know? They were planning to give the Sec 4s jewelry! Apparently, they didn't know that there are 2 Sec 4 male members! Until CQ's sister told them. CQ were like laughing about this. I ar...was shocked lor! 3 years! They really have no clue about our existence? ~shakes head~ tsk tsk tsk. But whatever! They are planning this BBQ for us! That's real nice of them!  Me-ow Meow! I think I better end this le. Nothing to write le. So, I shall end this with a song from FFIX. Enjoy!    Melodies of Life - Emiko Shiratori   Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark, For traces of the the love you left inside my lonely heart. To weave while picking up The pieces that remain -  Melodies of Life, Love's lost refrain.  Our paths they did cross, though I cannot says just why. We met we laughed, we held on fast and then we said goodbye. And who'll hear the echoes Of stories never told? Let them ring out loud 'Till they unfold   In my dearest memories I see you reaching out to me Though you're gone -  I still believe that you can call Out my name;   A voice from the past - Joining yours and mine, Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes on and on Melodies of Life To the sky beyond the flying birds -  Forever and beyond.   So far and away, see the bird as it flies by Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my memories And dreams upon those wings, Leave them now, and see what Tomorrow brings.   In your dearest memories Do you remember loving me? Was it fate.. That brought us close and now leaves Me behind?   A voice from the past - Joining yours and mine, Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes on and on Melodies of Life To the sky beyond the flying birds - Forever and on  If I should leave This lonely world behind, Your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on Melodies of Life Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts  As long as we remember    Goodnight all! Meow Meow!

      Okay, this is gonna be another quickie. I just got off from tuition and I need to go watch Bao Zi Dan later!   I shall comment on the possibility of Mrs Tan, our principal, teaching us Biology. She is certified to, according to Mrs Chua, she posesses a Honors in Biology. Woah! I am quite excited about this thingy! It's a rare chance a principal is teaching us. I hope she does. That way, we can get to know her more and see her 'teacher' side. It would be exciting. But I can imagine, everyone would be too scared to answer questions. After all, she's the principal. But I think Yit Hann wouldn't la. And neither would I. We love answering questions (if we know the answer, of course!). Oooo! I hope she does teach us! That would be so ultra cool!  Ayioh! For these two days, I am rushing to blog (and it is 9.40..I better hurry up). I can't don't blog...not even for a day! Seriously! I'll suffer from blog-withdrawal. I hope the next few days I would not be so rushing to blog. I hope I can be more relaxed when blogging tomorrow (9.42 le!!!).   Okay, because of the lack of time (9.43!!), I will not be doing lyrics for today. I give you all a short hiatus from reading lyrics. But rest assured. Tomorrow I shall post lyrics again, provided I do not rush, which means hopefully there will be no homework given that would require us to pass up on Friday.   Okay, bye bye all! (Oh yes! Remind me to talk about Choir's graduation party for us At East Coast Park in tomorrow's blog! Got loads to talk about! Die Die! 9.46 le!)

      I came online for a quickie. Holland Vilalge is showing, and I have to make this fast.  I brought presents for HuiMin and Wan Xin today. Both of them are bears. Yeah. But what's more surprising is that I brought a present for WX. We are not really that close, we used to be "enemies". But, Wendy told me WX has changed her attitude towards me. I was happy la. So, I think that's why I brought her a gift, together with HuiMin and Xiao Chuan. HuiMin received a present from me and XC too. HaHa!   Today, on Wendy's MD player, I heard a song. I heard this from Smallville, and liked it very much. So, I am posting  Graduation  from  Vitamin C  as lyrics today. I dedicate this to all my friends! I will remember you always!    Graduation Song - Vitamin C   And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track  And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day  Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of the night in June I Didn't know much of love, but it came too soon And There was me and you, and then it got real blue Stay at home talkin' on the telephone and We would get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at our selves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  Chorus:  As we go on, we remember All the times we had together And as our lives change, from whatever We will still be, friends forever   So if we get the big jobs and we make the big money When we look back now, will that joke still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  *Repeat chorus*  La, la, la, la; yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la,  we will still be friends forever   Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town  I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye  Keep on thinking it's a time to fly  *Repeat chorus 3x*   Goodnight everyone! Off to watch Holland Village and do Bio homework!

      Oh hey! I just came back from typing out my testimonial. I was planning to write it, but decided to type it because I am able to write longer if I type it out. Yeah! Haha!  I woke up at 8.35 today...and bathed. I watched some cartoons in the morning  and went online after 11. I ate lunch at 12 and went to Wendy's house at 1.  I managed to complete my EL compre there. We talked quite a lot of topics, like friendship, graduation, life after O Levels. HaHa! I am quite excited about life after Os. What will I do? Hmm....Ha! We also discussed Prom Nite(a little). It was always interesting to go to Wendy's house and chat with her. Sometimes, I learnt quite a number of life lessons just by talking to her. HaHa! Oh yes...Lassie stinks badly. And Wendy had just bathed Lassie.   Went to eat dinner at 5.30. I ate some chicken rice and brought back chicken rice for my brother. I conversed with Wendy's mom in Cantonese today. It was quite weird...hahaha! Talking to your friend's mother in Cantonese, a language where your friend don't even understand. I asked Wendy if she felt weird or anything. Surprisingly, she said no. She just minded her own business. Hmmm.   Came back home, bathed and started on my testimonial writing. Oh boy! It was hard work. I have to refer here and there for dates and activities and helping words. Ah! But finally! I did it! A 800+ words long essay! I am proud of it! HaHa! I printed it out.  Okay, today's entry might be short. I am kinda tired from all those typing. So, see ya tomorrow! Bye bye blog! Goodnight!

      Hey hey! Today we have Physics class, starting at 9.45. so, me and CQ decided to meet at 9.45. I woek up at 8, bathed, ate breakfast and ran out of the house to meet CQ.  CQ and I talked a lot of things. One of the things he told me was that WQ said that it's better we are not talking, otherwise we would not quarrel. He's tired of querrelling with me. I was like...numb lor. I don't know what to say, or think. I don't even want to think. Wendy says it's good this way. At least he isn't angry anymore. It's good if you look at it that way. Hmmm...I dunnoe lor. I don't want to comment liao la.  Today's Physics was quite fun. HaHa! At least the experiments were easy. After Physics, we did the choosing of the mortals. Okay...at first I got X, a mortal whom I am pleased to have. Then, we chose again after everyone called for a re-choosing. I got Y. Then, there's another round of rechoosing. I got X back. Okay..I can reveal Y now. Y is Clarissa. YaY! I know what to give X.....I already thought of the Grand Finale (the 4th prezzie). HaHa!   We went to MacDonald's to do our homework (me and Wendy). We met up with Venjamin and his friend, WeiJian. I completed Bio TYS there, and decided to complete EL compre at Wendy's tomorrow. I didn't talk much to those two, but I find them quite nice and funny.   Anyway, a very perculiar thing happened. These things happen to me everytime one leh!! You see ar, Wendy's phone ran out of batt, so I lent her my phone to place her SIM card inside (so her mom could call). I transferred my SIM card out of the phone. After a while, I decided to put it inot Wendy's phone. And I can't find it!! Oh my god! I lost my SIM card! I am gonna get trashed by mom! I began searching for it....everywhere! Soon, everyone searched with me. HaHa! And oh...I also found a $1 coin (Ven said the sim card got turned into the coin!!). I want nothing to do with it, it reminds me of painful memeories, so I gave it to Wendy. I searched Wendy's bio book (since it was near me when I took my SIM card out), the table, every inch of the surrounding floor of our table. I even crawled down to search closely. Ha! After 30 minutes, I began panicking. I still couldn't find it! Then, I had an idea. I took Wendy's SIM card and began experimenting how far the card can fly. I flicked it to my right....I dropped it down from both ends of the chair. I even banged my head of the table while reaching for the card. Oww! Wendy told me later I am an embarassment. Hoei! Where got?! I left the place dejectedly...I am so gonna get killed.   Wendy and I walked around Causeway Point. I badly wanted to spend my $7 on a book. Wendy said she would not allow me to do such things. In the end, I didn't buy, because she don't like me buying it. I don't want to buy something which my friend will not gonna like. Hey! After all, I respect my friend's wishes. Ha! We walked around...and decided it was time to go home.  On the bus, I decided to search my bag again for a final ditch effort. And I found it!! It was in my bag all the time! Oh boy! I felt so silly for making such a fuss! I said, "Oh! Ohhh!!!" loudly when I found the card. The people in front stopped talking (in dialect) and looked at me.. I put back the SIM card into the phone...and it worked! I shouted "YaY!" They turned back again! I don't care! I called Wendy's mom to tell her the news. She asked me questions about Ven and WeiJian. I think I got Wendy into trouble. This whole episode made me realise how important my phone is. It acts as a form of communication between my friends and I, as an important alarm clock and as a reminder thingy! I will be totally lost with it. I won't be able to remind myself of show times (Friends, Charmed, Sabrina....), I won't be able to wake myself out (why....I used it to wake me up on the bus today...), I won't be able to sms my friends! Ahh! The important use of my phone! I appreciate it more!  I went home, bathed, ate, watched Simpsons and recorded Yu-Gi-Oh and came online! Ahh! I think I am logging off right now! See ya tomorrow! Bye bye! Goodnight blog!

      Hey hey! Today tons of stuff happened! Today is Teachers' Day!! Woo-hoo!  Firstly, we started off today with busy preparation of gifts for the teachers in the morning. They were rushing here and there, writing notes, wrapping them. Then, we went up to prepare for the run. There, we did our big confession of who's who angel and mortal! My angel is Hann! My guess was correct! HaHa! Then, came the uber lame run. Actually, it's not a run. It's a big walk around the 2.4km route. We cheered our teachers and friends as they ran past us That's all. We walked and walked. Boring. Okay la....we had some fun here and there, but mainly it was Hann who made jokes (like calling SL "XiaoWan! XiaoWan!").   We went back at around 8.45, where CQ and I changed out of the PE attire and into the class t. Then, we lined out and went into the hall to watch the performance. Most of it sucks. Some awful singers, some awful dancing. I only like the music. I fell alsleep at the band performing. The only exciting thing is the percussionist using ordinary objects to play music, the teachers' skit and the awards. Yeah....   After the performance, we became very busy giving out our gifts to the teachers. I became real fustrated when few of them are out. so, I decided to storm the teachers' office and give out cards manually. It worked! HaHa! Mrs Chew had a crowd gathered around her, everybody was very friendly.   After giving out gifts, I went to the canteen to attend a celebration for our Chinese teachers. We invited Mr Du and Mr Zhang for celebrate with us...they cut the cake and everything. We posed photos with them and stuff like that! How cool! Then, XC persuaded me to go watch Spy Kids 3 with him. Huimin and Amanda came along too! Coolies!  We decided to go eat at KFC first. I only ate mashed potatoes....because that's the only thing I can eat. However, Michelle's "Are You Happy Now" came up in the radio playing in KFC! Woo-hoo! Me and Manda went crazy...because we love that song! We sang along! After that, we (Me, XC, HuiMin and Amanda) went around to kill time. Amanda decided to buy blue roses for Wendy in Causeway, but the blue roses were too unevely dyed and ugly. We went to the MRT at around 1.40+, where we met MeiLeng, Jessica and Kenny.   Upon reaching Yishun, we went into NTUC Fairprice. then we went out and went into Northpoint. Me and Amanda decide to buy roses for Wendy, who's coming. We can't find blue roses at Cold Storage, and decided to venture out into the shophouses. After walking a long stretch of road, we can't find any florists. How sucky! We ran back to get a bouquet of roses from Cold Storage. And ran to the GV to give the flowers to Wendy. Her eyes brightened up a little, and she tried to smile. I guess she's too tired. And sad too....yeah. I got a fleeting feeling it's about someone. Yeah. Later, Wendy told me she appreciated the flowers a lot. That's great! :)  Anyway, we watched the Spy Kids3. The plot was terribly dissappointing. You see, there was this big buildup about the characters fighting Toymkaer in Level 5 of the game. BUT! In the end, they exited the game without any final showdown (oh...it came later...but it's was rahter lame).. How dissappointing! The 3D effects was okay....it felt 3D and all. But my glasses were blurry. Overall, I rated the move at 2.5/5 for dissappointing me.  Something miraculous happened. While watching the movie, my handphone rang because of messages coming in. That's weird. My hp died out of low battery long long ago! I couldn't switch it on. and there it was! All switched on and ringing! Very weird. I switched it off. And I can't on it later! No matter how much I tried. All 4 of us think it's weird.....I think radiation from the movie switched it on. Or something from above did it. ~Shrug~ Who knows?  After that, we went back to Causeway Point. We watched XC eat duck rice, while i completed the June Paper in my Bio TYS. Then, we went to take Neoprints. We chose a machine that showed us pictures. We were taking pcitures normally when a pictures of a horrible ghost appeared. We were shocked and the machine captured our faces! Then, we went out to decorate the pictures. We spent too much time on the first 2 photos, and neglected the last two. In the end, the last pic has only a flower and 4 of us with grey walls behind us! HaHa! Quite ugly! You should see it.  I reached home, bathed, ate dinner, watched Holland V and taped Sabrina and came online. Okay...today, WQ logged into his EastCiti account. I panicked and asked Wendy what I should do. Is WQ hinting me something? Is he giving me the chance to talk to him? I don't know whether I should talk or not. I don't know, actually. I wanted to, but I can't. I think it's because I feared rejection. Yeah. And I feared of the same situation happening later on. I don't want a repeat! While I am deciding, he went offline. Oh well. Can't blame him though. You know, he's actually became friendlier towards me. Can really tell lor. Except he always ask CQ to ask me questions, even though I am standing right in front of him. Hmmm....I wish he can ask me directly. It would make my day, it really would. I always answer before CQ gets a chance to ask. HaHa. I changed me MSN nick to "Could you look me in the eye? And tell me are you happy now?". It's a line from "Are you Happy Now". That song has always been a special significance to me. That's why I love it so much. You can say I am hinting. Maybe.   My eyes are getting damn tired. It's watery. I think it's a sign that I should stop. Yeah. Goodnight bog! See ya tomorrow!

      Heya! Such a late blog. Yeah! I was working on the Teachers' Day gifts for the teachers. Wanna know what it is? I tell ya. It's cards. Personalized cards.  Basically, the front and the back is the same thing, but in between is personalized. The right flap has pictures pertaining to the teacher's subject. Okay, that's not so petrsonalized if there are more than one teacher for a subject. What's even more personalized is the message on the left. Yep! Each and every one is different. Lets see. I gave cards to: Mrs Chew, Chrs Chua, Mrs Jalil, Miss Tan, Mr Sani, Mdm Oh, Mr Zhang, Mr Du, Mr Radha, Mrs Thong and Mr Tsung.   Ahhh....I did rather badly for the SS mock exam! Not really badly, but not up to my usual standards. I freaked out while looking at the SEQ questions and went on to the SBQ first. I took a very long time for the SBQ...namely more than 40 minutes. It was quite well-done...'cept for the last qns. Ha! Rushed through that one. Then, I looked over at thw SEQ, and kicked myself. Why? Turns out that I know the question after all. I did the Japan Industrial slowdown questions. I rushed through everything, not sure if I explained properly or not. It was quite terrible. I felt I would have done better if give more time. However, I am quite prooud of my answer. At least I made a balance in the (b) question. Ha. I think I will do well, but not quite well. I am expecting 35-40. Worst case having 30. Yeah....  At EL lesson, I almost slept. I keep nodding off, then waking up with a start. And the whole cycle repeats. We got a list of spelling words. Whoppee! Spelling. Haven't had that for a very long time. I am weird, huh. Wishing for spelling. Ha!  Oh guess what? I got my present from my Angel today! Ahh! It was slipped into the compartment where I placed my hole-puncher. I didn't noticed until in the bus, where I felt something weird. I pulled it out...and there I go. A prezzie! And everyone was surprised! There's a note attrached, saying, "Heaven told me you have a fever. Get well soon!". And inside it is a carribeana. Attached to it is a message that said "I love my cat". The present is so cute! I love it! I must thank the angel tomorrow. Oh...they are revealing angels tomorrow! Can't wait!   Okay, know what? I think I am stopping. I got a big big headache....I think I am gonna go sleep. See ya! Bye bye!

      Hey! Why I haven't been online? Okay okay. You have heard it so many times. I am sick...AGAIN! I hate it!!  Yesterday morning (dunnoe-what-time am), I woke up, I felt terribly cold. That's not a good sign. I only get this cold when I am running a fever. And my head feels warm. I ignored it. Later, my mother woke me up and mademe take my temperature. The thermometer shows: 39.9! OH MY GOD! That's very very high! I almost felt like fainting.  Then, mom did all sorts of things to cool my body down, like washing face constantly with ice-water. Then, they considered sending me to hospital. I am stuck. Okay, hospital is more efficient, and I have been whining about sending me to the hospital somedays ago. But! I watched the Good Morning Singapore show, and the acting Minister of Health said, "I don't care whether it is Vancouver ducks or Canadian ducks, we are treating the flu virus in Canada as SARS", which means that anyone who has high fever and is coughing is most likely treated as "potential SARS victim" and be isolated and denied of any visitors. I DO NOT HAVE SARS! I hate NOT having visitors. I smsed Wendy, she advised me to go "You want your brain damaged? I think you better G". My mom later said that we visit our doctor first, before deciding to go hospital or not.  Slept for a while, then woke up to eat breakfast. Father came back to fetch me to the doctor. At the clinic, I was basically being shunned. Not really. I keep coughing and coughing (that means I have something to vomit, but I don't want to vomit. I hate squat toilets and I don't want to vomit in a grass patch where everyone can see me). The back row seats were empty, except for me and mom. The front row were filled. HaHa! Good. I can stretch out my legs and sleep. After a prolonged period of waiting, it's my turn. The doctor told me becuase I ate porridge yesterday, the virus striked back. I am not supposed to eat rice-based food. And he didn't send me to the hospital. Good. When I came out, I had a fit. My coughing turned violent. This time, everyone looked at me. I ran towards the grass patch behind my father's taxi (far from everyone's prying eyes) and vomited my phelgm out. Ahhh. Felt so much better.   After the visit, we went to Ang Mo Kio. Mom wants to replace some parts of an appliance. After failing at different locations of AMK, we decided to go back home. In the end, I did. The parents went to Woodlands Central to get a new appliance instead. I ate, watched TV, and slept.  At 5.15, my alarm woke me up. It's time to watch Sabrina! Yeah. See. I told you I am a Sabrina freak. I watch it whether I am sick or not. XC called, and told me a lot of stuff. O.o Then I called Wendy. She told me about a lot of things, like everybody knew I was about to go to the hospital and all. And she called after SS exam, to see whether I am in hospital or not. I was sleeping. Quite a number of people said a lot of things. They were discussing it would be funny if I would to go to the hospital and all that. Ha! I wonder what would happen to me in the hospital. Then, I went to bath, and ate macroni and talked to Wendy some more. After that, we hanged up to watch Holland V.   Then, I watched the Jack Neo show (where they talked about maids...haha....so funny) and came online while printing stuff for brtoher. Wendy screamed at me "CQ just left. Anyway...WHAT ARE YOU DOING ONLINE? YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESTING!". HaHaHa! Yeah la, I know ni wei wo hao la. After printing, I went offline to watch the Channel 8 show, then Friends. Then, I heard Chistopher Reeve (the one who snaped his back while playing Superman in the movie) guest appears, so I watched. Then, I went to sleep on the floor of my parents' bedroom again.   And here I am. Feverless. I hope. I said I am gonna discuss the WQ issue right? Yeah. You see ar. I thought of giving up, leaving it to fate. I already had enough of this cycle of "fighting-patching up". I thought it was fate that we were umcompatible. Besides, when I learnt he canceled me out of his "close friends" list and blocked me in his MSN, I felt kinda numb about it already. I don't really care that much. Wendy, however, would have none of it. She said that I cannot leave it to fate. I must fight for that hope. I told her "Isn't that pointless? It is clear that the other party would have nothing to do with me anymore...so why hang onto him. That prevents me from moving on." She said, "You can choose to ignore it. But you mustn't lose that hope" and she gave a well-proven example. Yeah. She also said if I leave this to fate, I would dissappoint her, like someone did. I mustn't leave this to fate. And you know what? I won't. I may or may not take action, but I will still hope. And hope. And hope. Yeah.   I gotta go eat lunch le. See ya later. Bye!

      Well well well. I thought I won't be blogging tonight, but since there's time after "What Women Want", I guess I come online and blog for a while. Okay, regulars first. FFIX update. I completed Disc 2! Whoo-hoo! I got Armarant in my team, saw the cut-offed FMVs (which I am downloading for my viewing pleasure), the death of Brahne... Yeah. Disc 2 completed. Moving on to Disc 3!!   Okay. I originally planned to discuss about the WQ issue today, but due to time constraints and serious headaches, I decided to push it to tomorrow.   So therefore, I am blogging off now. Yes yes, I know. A very short and dissappointing blog. But remember, I am having a major headache. So there. Bye blog! Night!

      Okay. You would have noticed my 2-days leave from my blog. Why is that so? Is KY away? Is KY's internet been cut off again? Well. No. The truth is: KY's been sick. When i say sick, I mean major sick. As in 39 degrees fever sick.  Yeah. For 2 long days, I have been running a constantly high fever. It started on Thursday morning. During SR, I felt a very serious headache. I felt my forehead and realised that I am running a fever. I excused myself from PE. At Chem, I did Practical with Hann (why doesn't people listen to me until they see for themselves how wrong they are? sheez! Advised him to do this, he ignored me and said I don't know what I am doing. And then, after his experiment failed, he finally heed my advice. Stubborn people! And made me so annoyed and increased my headache level!), then fell asleep at the Chem Theory lesson. Surprisingly, Mrs Chew let me sleep and didn't bother me. She knew I am sick and advised me to go home.  I finally heed her advice and called my mom. Slept at the Sick Bay till Mom arrived. By then, I was feeling very weak. At home, when I took my temperature, the reading showed 39.1. Oh my! We went to a private clinic (my family doctor is not available on Thursday), and I became very very cranky due to the need of sleep (Sick patients get cranky easily). My head hurts so much too. Coming back home, I fell asleep immediately.   I woke up at 5.15 for another round of medicine drinking. After that, watched Sabrina (called Wendy to watch, because the episode features Daniel Bedingfield), then ate dinner. After that, watched Holland V and went to sleep.  In the morning, I woke up with a terrible headache. When I tried to walk, I can't walk straight. Everything's very blurish. I felt very weak and lethargic and my body feels so heavy. I took my temperature and found out that it is 39.5 degrees! Oh my god! After breakfast, parents brought me to the family doctor, who informed me that my body's burning (also smsed Wendy teling her how scared I was and all that stuff about enzymes denaturing and me dying. She replied back with "Don't be stupid. You'll be fine. That's a relief, sort of). After that, ate kueh chap for lunch and went back home.   Let me sidetrack a little. I can't believe how cool my father's new taxi is! It's very yellow and bright, being a new taxi and all. It's much bigger than before! The driver has many more controls. For example, he can lock/open the door with a simple push of a button. And whenever he locks/opens his front door with his keys, the other 3 doors will follow suit. How convenient. The front passenger seat is bigger and has more space. YaY! Anyway, there's one stupid feature which I hate. There is this "lighter" to light cigarettes. Just push a button, take out something, put the cigarette onto some glowing metal spiral and viola, cigarette is lit. I hate this new feature! Citycab is balantly encouraging drivers to smoke! Why, I never! I thought our government is strongly discouraging smoking, and there CityCab is! Telling drivers it is okay to smoke and providing convenient tools for them to smoke too! What atrocity! How atrocious! When I have a car (don't sneer. I am gonna have a car), I will not allow such features in my car!  Okay, back to the topic. I went back home, slept for an hour and started on my homework, while watching Twins Effect. I managed to complete my homework...yippee! However, I recieved a very idiotic call. Hann called. At first, he asked me how I am doing. I said I am not fine and is still having a fever. He said, "That's your problem". You asked how I am and later tell me it's my problem? Hello?! Then, he told me about how much I missed out that day and how much he learnt in class. I became quite angry. There I am. Barely recovering from a fever (37degrees that time), feeling very headachy, and you are boasting about how much you are clever than me because you learnt something more. Hello! Like I care! Stupid words. I told him, "Learn then learn la! Like I care how much you learn!". He then got all huffy-puffy and hang up. Later, I smsed him, saying that what he said just now is really inapporpriate and he went overboard. "If you want to boast, go find someone who cares". He then said something about "You are too much...assuming everything". I forgot what I replied with, but apparently, it made him real mad. He got very angry and started shouting (in his words, I infered that he is my Angel. About "not gonna bother to....nevermind". That shows secrecy! A-ha!). I finally ignored his smsed and switched off the phone. At that time, I felt really weak again. My temperature has rose to 39 again! It's very demoralizing! I never had such a serious fever before! High fever for 2 straight days! I can't stand it anymore! I fell asleep, this time, on the floor in my parent's bedroom. They gave me the "cold treatment", hoping the cold floor and the direct fan blowing in my face would cool me down. Anyway, felt very umcomfortable.  The next morning, which is today, I woke up and felt so much better! The "cold treatment" worked! My temperature is now 38.5 and everytime I take my temperature, it is slowly, but surely, decreasing! Whoo-hoo! But the only idiotic thing is: My throat hurts like hell! Whenever I try to swallow anything (even water), I would feel extremely uncomfortable and painful. Ergh. However, it felt better when I drink the sour plum drink my mom made. Ah! It's much better now. I got smses from Wendy and Ah Ji, and a call from Janet last night, asking and wishing for my well-being. Thanks guys! I appreciate it so much!  Alright! Enough about my sickness. I heard that on Friday, a lot of mortals have recieved their gifts. HaHa! So much fun! Wish I was there to see their joys. They spectaculated that whoever did not recieve their gift yet has me as their angel. Oh my, that makes it very obvious! But it doesn't make a difference, really, whether I am there or not. Okay. SHOOSH KY! Too much clues! Heard Ah Ji got a box of chocolate, WQ a letter. Congrats to both of them! Enjoy your gifts ar.   I think I am ending here le. I am getting a headache. See ya tomorrow! Bye!

      Heya! Today, I didn't play FFIX at all, so there won't be any FF updates whatsoever. Decided to take a break from playing FFIX. Yeah.  Today, something interesting in school happened. We decided to play a game, called Angels and Mortals. It's played like this. We, a group of us, are all Angels and Mortals. Angels will select a mortal (from lucky draw) and for 4 weeks, once a week, give his/her mortal a gift. It could be anything....words of encouragement, all that stuff that Angels do to make their charges feel better (reminds me of Leo, the Charmed Ones' Whitelighter, an angel). The mortal is not supposed to know who his/her angel is, so the angel must somehow give the gift to his/her mortal secretly. About 14+ people signed up for the game! Whee-hoo! Me and CQ were talking about the possibilities of getting so-and-so.....At the end of the school, we drew lots to see who got who. I was telling myself that if I chose myself, I am not going to send a letter secretly to myself saying, "Good job being a cat!". Anyway, Clarissa got herself...have to repick...kinda funny. I got my mortal and it's a surprise for me (okay...it's a surprise no matter who i picked). I got .......... HaHa! I can't say (and the number of dots does not mean the number of letters in a word. Give up your counting.), because the angel who divulges his/her mortal have to treat 10+ other angels Yakult. Oh my!! I better keep my mouth shut. I had my suspicions who my angel is, due to overhearing snatchets of conversation. Only suspicions though. If those two (one of them) is really my angels, I am very happy le! :)   today, I did something damaging. While climbing up the stais, I grabbed hold of Hann's bag. Actually, I grabbed one of his ornaments. A chicken. And it came off from the keyring! Can you imagine that? I was like so shocked. Wendy, walking besdie me, saw everything. She started laughing and it grew harder and harder. Hann turned around and I quickly hid the chicken behind my back. Then, after threatnening me and stuff, he turned back. Then. me and Wendy started laughing real hard! Oh my god! I was so laughing that I can't stand up! HAHAHA! The whole thing is so funny.....the chicken suddenly went "pop" and was detached from the bag and ended up in my hand. And my expression too! I was so shocked! Then, Hann saw his bag and knew what happened. I gave him back the chicken..and he became devastated. He informed me I owed him a lot of things. Oh my!   Today...I think thatr's about all for today la...I gotta go now! Goodnight blog! And oh yes, good job being a cat!

      Heya! Firstly, FFIX updates. I got out of Black Mage Village (brought a lot of Hi-Potions), went back into Conde Petit to see the holy union of Zidane and Garnet, and also ViVi and Quina. Funny la, that scene! HaHa, especially when Zidane failed to kiss Garnet. Okay, anyway....we walked the bridge thingy and finally, we ended up in Iifa Tree, the source of all mist. Skipping the bopring stuff, we got to fight Soulcage, the Undead boss of Iifa tree. The guide advises me to use Life......BUT BUT! It misses! And the stupid peabrain monster used Lvl5-Death, which killed off Eiko, Dagger and Vivi! I keep using Phoenix Down on Garnet, but before I can even use Life, the monster killed her. Finally, I remembered an old advice, and proceeded to use Phoenix Down then attack the monster. It finally worked! It's a miracle Zidane survived! HaHa!Now, I am on my way back to Madain Sari to help Eiko in a theft incident!  Today leh...nothing much happened lor. Well, today Wendy asked me to buy food for her. I brought her chicken rice plain. And she was dissappointed and said, "I thought you know me well". I was like "Woah?" and was quite hurt by that remark. Firstly, I didn't see any extra ingredients she wanted. Secondly, I have no money to pay for extras lor. I told her the former reason. She said later on, "You lied! I saw mashed potatoes!" I went on to tell her I didn't see and also the second reason.  She said, "You say so earlier ma" ... Don't know what to say la. I shut up and eat my laksa. Sigh.  And oh! The class committee is badged....Well done, majority of the class comm! You put in real effort and committment into your work! Your value and hardwork does need to be recongized. Notice I use thw word "majority". Get the implication? You infer yourself and tell me! Then, we went to vote for the Teachers Awards. Oo! I do hope some of our favourite teacher would get in! Okay...then after the quick Chem remedial, we went to choir for a quick refresh. The choir has fallen into a state of depression. The Sec 1s totally sucks  and Miss Choo gave up all hopes on them. Ahh....oh well. Oh yes, her comment to PeiYu's article is that PeiYu seemed to think she is dead, for everything is written in past tense. Ahhh.....I don't know whether she felt insulted or she's joking. I hope it's the latter.  We left home at 4.15. I noticed that Wendy became quite depressed. She became depressed like after stepping into the Choir room. Not only I noticed lor, the rest of us did. And we were pretty worried for her. CQ and Janet keep asking me what's wrong with Wendy, and I told them I don't know much, just that she became depressed after entering the choir door. I had my suspicions that it has something to do with a particular someone, but I didn't voice that out la. Hmm... But whatever it is, I do hope she will feel better soon.   Uncle Steven came to fix my brother's computer. It's working now, but all the files has been erased. Ahh! Whatever la! He says he'll be bringing over an anti-virus CD for us next time, to protect ourselves against viruses. HaHa! Thanks Uncle Steven!   I think I gotta stop writing le. So late le...these days I feel very lethargic and sleepy. Probably still hasn't gotten used to waking up at 5, half and hour earlier. How would I give for Friday to come!! Sit in a new car and wake up at 5.30! How blissful life is! Friday Firday come come soon! Okay okay...enough crap. Goodnight!

      Ahh yes! FFIX updates first! It was a treacherous walk to Conde Petit, where we met many many monsters, and devoured them. One useful monster Quina ate is Cactuar, where Quina learnt 1000 Needles, an attack inflicting 1000HP everytime. So useful that one. It nearly wiped out my party...stupid thing. Anyway, I finally made it to Conde Petit, where so many strange-looking cats were around. Then, we found a black mage, and therefore, everyone decided to chase after it. I got lost...but luckily I found some Chocco's footprints and rode Chooco towards the Black Mage Village. We arrived there. ViVi learnt about "stopping", when mages die. Zidane talked about his childhood. Both stories leave a sense of melancholy in my heart. Then, they began to find Kuja and his silver dragon. Ahh...that will be next time.  Today nothing interesting really did happen. I ordered some photos from Yvonne. There is no SS remedial, so we went out to eat and do homework together. Oh yes! Something did happen. You see ar, Mrs Jalil was doing patrol duty in the canteen and XC didn't wear his badge. So, XC wanted me to "cover" for him. Jalil came over..and XC said something about "quickly hide". So, I said loudly, "XC! Give me one piece!" and proceeded to take one piece of XC's food. How embarassing. Right in front of Jalil some more leh! She came over and asked why I take hsi food. I told her about the father not working for one week and I have minimal amount of money. She said, "Don't starve yourself yourself ar!". Such a caring teacher. Then she went on saying, "You should help Kelvin in times like this ma...how can you all say him? (Hann said loudly, "He got a motive!")" HaHa! I don't know why, from trying to cover for XC to this embarrassing incident. Then, Hann and CQ went on exclaiming loudly to the whole wide world I got a motive in whatever I do. So, finally, I said sarcastically, "Ayioh! My motive is revealed!". Hann then said, "You got a motive in saying that your motive is revealed!" Oh my! -.-"    After school, we went to the AVA room to hear Mrs Tan's speech. Only those who were exempted from taking MT had to hear this speech. We were told to behave in the library, if we break any rules, we have to do MT Nov Paper. And therw will be no appeal whatosever, since we lost our privileges. Whatever. Like I would misbehave. Or like my friends would either.  Then, we went to Admiralty's KFC to eat and do homework. By "we", I mean CQ, Me, XC, SL, HuiLing, Gloria, Janet and WQ. XC and I shared some bombo meal together. I was remarked upon my chicken eating skills to be too gentle. I slowly peel off the skin and the meat, then eat the pieces slowly. Someone even commented I "don't know how to eat a chicken". I respectfully did not retort. Obviously, the person is blind. If I don't know how to eat a chicken, none of the meat would be in my stomach being digested. At least I don't waste chicken. I eat every single meat my teeth can bite into, and the skin too, and also the bones. Chickens gave their lives for us, to fill our stomach with energy, not to be thrown away half-eaten. Anyway, back to the topic. After eating, we moved to the foodcourt upstairs for homework-doing. I didn't complete my SS (but I did complete it in Popular while waiting for Janet and Gloria to buy what they want), but me, CQ and SL discussed about forming a study group for SS/History. I am very okay with the idea. I wonder what topics they assigned me to do. Ahh!   There will be two tests tomorrow. Bio and Trig functions/equations/whatever-it-is-named. Bio one I dunnoe whether can pass or not. I hope the paper would be easy. The Trig oen is so simple! Even Mr Radha commented today that I "can do it!". HaHa! Boosted my confidence man! :)  I think I gotta go now...see ya tomorrow! Goodnight!

      Heya! I completed my homeworl! Woo-hoo! Finally!   Today, I woke up at 8, where I spent 30 minutes in bath. I was thinking about the WQ issue and what points to include in my EL compo later (came with with several good phrases..like "ensure that the fmaily is stable-economically, emtionally and physically"). Then, me and brother watch Digimon and Yu-Gi-Oh while both parents went to buy breakfast and stuff. They came back with my breakfast (fried carrot cake. the size has grown smaller! ayioh!). I ate till 10, then I proceeded to Wendy's house for a day of homework-completion.  Ah! I managed to write my arugmentative essay...and go for lunch with Wendy and her brother. We ate at Macdonald's, and since I only brought 4 bucks, I ate the Chicken McCrispy only.  Wendy and her brother ate fries, spicy Chicken McCrispy and some hamburger. The eldest brother brought back some food for the third brother.   After that, I completed my EL compre and History notesd while she completed her Bio TYS. I found an eyebrow plucker at her cabinet, and proceeded to pluck my eyebrows. It ended up that my right eyebrow is finer than my left eyebrow. Oh my!! After that, we went to Causeway Point. Wendy wanted to buy C21's CD, and I accompany her.  She didn't get the CD after all. Stocks hasn't arrived yet. We toured Causeway Point. Okay, not really the whole of Causeway, but the fourth and fifth floor. We went to the Hallmark shop, Music Junction, the gift shop in the fourth floor, and the snack shop in fifth floor. I brought (and owed Wendy $1) Vanilla Coke there. We then went up to the cinema to see what new movies there are. "How To Deal" was not showing there (probably at Eng Wah or Golden village). We saw a new cartoon movie, "Sinbad and the Seven Seas". Brad Pitt voiced Sinbad. There were also voices from Michelle Phieffer. HaHa! Along the way ar, CQ smsed to my reply. His reply is very the what leh! So embarrassing! I say often already, NO, but they don't listen one!   After that, we went to the library to pick up her mother. After that, I find myself walking towards a Jap restuarant. I was too busy smsing CQ to tell her brother I am eating at home. Wendy said, "You lucky" and said that I never treated her before. Feel so embarrassed. Her family treated me so many times, whilst mine didn't. Sigh...I make it up to Wendy some day la hor. Me and her brother ate the chicken one, while Wendy and her mom ate the salmon one. Me and Wendy don't eat beef. I don't because I hate eating other meat that is not part of my daily regime (chicken, ducks, pigs, fishes, cuttlefish, shells, sotongs...the likes). I dunnoe why Wendy don't eat beef. Must ask her later. And CQ smsed Wendy a cute picture sms. I was so jealous and actually smsed CQ back, saying "you bias ah ji". HaHa! He sent me another cute pic sms! Thanks CQ! :)  After that, we went to Metro, to wait for her brother buying 4D there. Wendy was shopping for a wallet...and she was so tempted to buy one. I drag her to another section (she asked me to "Kel! Pull me away!"), which contain wallets again. So, I pulled her towards the handbags section. HaHa! Soon, it was time to leave. We met JunZhong and ChinChuan outside Metro. After that, I went back home, ate dinner, and here I am. Oh Yit Hann said to record his call down, and he's still talking to me.  I gotta go off le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight!

      Today's a rather interesting day. But first, I want to talk about FFIX. I have managed to go through the Evacation Site, reaching the Outer Continent. I gots loads of interesting items in the mine. and experience too. When I fought Lani, one of Queen Brahne's assasin, Zidane Tranced. I used the new Dyne skills he learnt, and the most powerful, Solution 9, which deducted 4000+ HP from the enemy. Woah! We won the battle easily! Woo-hoo! Now the Outer Continent awaits me!  Hey! As you know, today's the school Flag Day. Our class is assembling at Wisma Atria, along with the other Sec 4 classes. First, me, Janet, Gloria and HuiLing decided to meet and go to Marsiling MRT to meet the rest. Me and Janet meet at 6.05, then we proceed to Gloria's house, reaching there at 6.15 (along with few screams here and there! All the chicken's fault! Crowing and scaring me like that!). Then, we three walked to Admiralty MRT, where we met a very late HuiLing at 6.35 (who is ruimored to pencil her eyebrows before stepping out of the house).   We reached Marsiling at 6.45...just nice. On the way down, it seems that we just missed Mrs Jalil. HaHa! We were too busy peering to our right for CQ they all that we missed Jalil waving to us on our left. I hope she doesn't feel insulted. And I was commenting rather loudly when we walked down the stairs that we Admiralty people is so much earlier than those who lived near Marsiling. HaHa! And our theory is proved right when WQ, being the nearest to Marsiling, is the latest to arrive! Tsk tsk tsk! We boarded the train and off we go!  On the train, I did my Physics TYS (copied...and also to the delight of SL, because she can copy from me afterwards) and listened to my Discman. It's rather jumpy.....oh well! I must get it serviced someday. I managed to complete the first chapter and halfway through the second chapter when we arrived at Orchard. Ahh. Do later la.  We took a rather long way to the back Wisma Atria. We reached there in the end...and waited for the subsitute teacher for sick Mrs Chew (get weel soon, Mrs Chew!). It turned out to be Mrs Chua (another of my theory was proven right! I was telling that to Janet and Gloria on the way to Admiralty MRT)! We registered our names and stuff and waited for the whole class to assemble. Mrs Chua insisted that she take the whole class to Raffles. The whole class finally did assemble at 8.30. We then proceed on to Raffles MRT, where Mrs Chua would station herself there to watch the MRT exits.   Our group - Me, Quan, SL, Janet, Hann, WQ, Gao Luan and Kim Hock - went towards the Singapore River direction. Here, we aplit up inot 2 groups of 4. My group consist of me, Janet, Hann and CQ. Not so strangely and coincidentally enough, we four are Kim Hock-haters. HaHa! We went towards the direction of the Esplanade (okay...proounced as Es-plant-nad, NOT es-plan-naid! We should prounce it the French way, since Esplanade is a French word!), where we spot lots of toruists from China. Most of them don't want to donate though. Hmm. We got to the Esplanade, and was effectively chased out by a security guard, who said something about cannot solict donations in front of a government building (oh! they are afraid of tourist complaining! that's what we think), so we went back. Then, we seeked out Mrs Chua because of sheer boredom (she was sitting at the grass-thingy reading a Bio book..something to do with O Levels). She told us to go to Golden Shoe Carpark building to ask for donations. There're lots of people walking in and out ...great for donations.   We went there...and woah! Mrs Chua's recomendation was excellent! That place is a cross-road, so people were walking in from all 4 directions. So many donors! Woah! Soon, our bag was jingling with coins and some notes. After a while, we went to eat in the coffeeshop. Me and Hann shared kueh chap, Janet and Quan drank Pepsi. After that, those two left early after dirnking...and we continued eating. Meanwhile, it started to rain.   What a surpise we recieved when we came out! The other group came and snatched our ti pan! Now, we cannot return to our own home (wu jia ke gui)...and they all blamed me, becuase i told SL where we are when she called. We left that place...(me still under beration) and when we came back...they were gone! I think they took the hint. After that, we decided to returnto Raffles to accompany Mrs Chua. What we ended up with is a mindless hour of waiting and getting wet. Finally! At 11.30, Mrs Chua came out of a shopping centre! Then, she started taking attendance...and still isnisted that all of 4/5 assemble before we can leave. Then, after some time, we can leave...phew!  After handing up the bag, and queueing a long queue and suffered stickers attacks, we headed into Wisma. Our group decided to eat at KFC. WQ made me sit outside the table, blocking everyone's way. I told him, "If I block anyone, then it's your fault!". One lady tried to pass, and I told her, "Sorry for blocking you!" while glaring at WQ. Then, all of them left without me, HuiMin and XC! How could they! but luckily, we met them in the train platform. After that, all of us proceeded to Bugis.  Oh! We had so much fun in Bugis. We spotted Adarian Pang and walked the Bugis Junction. After that, we went to Bugis Village. XC told us there a "pervertic shop" there, selling all kinds of pervertic things. XC reckoned that it might also be a prositute house. Oh! We decided to go to Bugis Village. We did spot that shop there...and XC commented those people outside the shop looking at the display, "Those pervertic people! Want to go there ar!". After touring bugis Village, we went to OG, near the Fu Lu Shou building.  OG's huge. We shopped around for ornaments and toys....haha! We even meowed at the Monopoly game board! After having fun in OG, we decided to go back to Parco Bugis Junction to eat lunch. After eating 2 times (KFC and kuey chap), I decided to do my Physics homework there. Yeah! :P There, Gloria encountered a nasty. Gloria accidentally pushed a chair with a handbag on it. That lady cat, stared at Gloria and angrily pushed the chair towards her. Tsk Tsk.   Ater eating, we left for home. On the MRT, lots of things happened. First, we took lots of pictures and that XC controled my actions everytime! You will see soon enough. It's terribly funny! Then, I completed my TYS (except for Section Bs, because I have no foolscap) when the train reached Kahtib. The last interesting thing is, mine and Wq's fight, which ultimately, he became the losing party.  you see ar. He wanted to go up to take my zhuo ye. Fine with me. Then, later he said I take my zhuo ye and go down to give it to him while he wait for me downstairs. Not so fine this time! If he's too lazy to even come up(well...he's even too lazy to walk properly....he walks and he nevers lifts up his feet! Produce all those stupid sound! Tsk Tsk! Well, if his leg becomes a problem for him, then he jolly well deserved it. Don't lift up feet some more la!), then why should he get my zhuo ye? After all, he wanted it for himself to copy. I told him no...then he wanted me to give back his CD. He is a very cruel person, and violent too. He tried to cause bodily harm to me and my earpiece. I told him I would scream if he did that again. He went on to squeeze my earpiece in his hands! Ahh! I really screamed out loud! And gave him back the CD, when I realized that he isn't embarrassed of his violent and meancing actions. I tolf him loudly, "If my earpiece spoilt, I am suing you for damages!" (I thought a lot about it at home, when I am bathing. I should also sue him for causing intentional harm to my ear and my posessions and harassment. And suggest that he be locked up indefinitely. He's a danger to the scoiety, such violent and revegeful person!). Then, I was telling XC I am going off le. He piped up and said, "Go la! Don't cause more embarrassment to yourself!". I then retorted while telling XC, "XC. I going liao. And I also heard go fei (dog bark. I should have said more about unwanted dogs in MRTs!)!". He was staring at me when I leave the train. He later told XC that I am mad, crazy, and asked everybody whether I was loud. Of course I was loud! Screaming is meant to be loud. If I am soft, then it's a insult to my screaming skills! What a stupid question to ask! Ha! Feeling the embarrassment now, aren't you?! And he always use the same words! Change words la! Such limited vocabulary! Tsk Tsk. Even I was praised by the examiners for having and using good vocabulary! Okay...stop being so bitchy ar, KY! One last thing, never mess with a person who knows how to scream and is not afraid to do it! Stop it KY! End of anger release (and this is the longest paragraph so far!)!  Oh! Tomorrow going to Wendy's for homework completion. I still have EL compo, compre and history notes. I hope I can complete by tomorrow!   I gotta go le. And I just realize I am a very evil, vile and horrible person when I bitch. Ahh! The dark side of KY! Goodnight!

      Heya! First thing first. FFIX updates. I completed the rescue mission of Garnet from Alexandaria Castle, got out of Alexandaria, got Ramuh the Endolion, fought the stupid snake (and keep healing myself and stole Oak Staff from) which frightened the Gargant, got into Lindblum and brought new weapon (including Exploda for Zidane) and here I am, out in the world, making my way towards Qu Marsh. Ahh!  Today, in EL class, Mrs Thong told the whole class what the examiners said about me. HaHa! She added that the examiners won't minus mark for my nervousness...phew..a very very good thing and also, the examiners told her I kept self-correcting. Ha! Silly habit of mine! Nervousness again! Ahh! I feel even more relaxed! Wee-hoo! and today leh...Hann keep suaning me because I keep talking about my orals and how well I did. I think hor, he's being jealous. There he is, worrying about his own orals, and I am there 'flaunting' my good grades. Ahh! I think I made him even more uneasy, and worried, and jealous. Ah!  Yesterday, Hu Lau Shi mentioned me in her Sec 2 class. She said I was so happy that I held her hand and jumped up and down. HaHa! Hey...how you know, you ask. Well, that class is CQ's sister's class, and she has her suspicions that "Xiang Wei" is me. She confirmed with CQ. CQ thinks that Hu likes to boast about her O Level students. I think I am a very good example (for people to boast about). Yeah! For all my fours years at Riverside, I am a very lousy MT student, never getting any A in any MT exams before. And there I am, getting an A for my O Levels, exceeding Hu's expectations (a B3)! See! No wonder she would talk about me. HaHa! I feel so honored! Stop it ar, KY. Don't hao lian ar!   What else to say ar.....oh yes! I decided to dig my Discman out of the cupboard and bring tomorrow and on every MT lessons. I see so many people bring...and CQ/Hann don't want to lend me. Feel so left out everytime...so decided to bring lor. Must ask XC, WQ they all to burn CDs for me. Ahh! Getting desperate now ar! No la where got!   Today, a miraclous event happened to Wendy. Now now...I won't say...it infringes upon her privacy right, but this something is what she has been wishing for, has been wanting for ages. She is so happy about it! I feel happy for her too! :) (~thumbs up for Wendy!~) I personally feel that she's very brave. It takes a lot of courage to do this sort of things, yeah! I admire her for that! And once again, great job Wendy! I am very happy for ya!  I think I am logging off le! See ya tomorrow blog, when I return from the Flag Day! Goodnights!

      Heya! Today's my EL Oral! Woo-hoo! Let me narrate what happened.  I wasn't worried at first...I was very calm and everything. But! But! Once I stepped into the waiting room, I started feeling really nervous! Yeah! Oh my god! Yep! We, 12 of us, decided to "cheat" a bit. See ar...the first few people are our indicators. We make them use hand patterns and gestures to tell us what they think about the passage and the picture. Becky was the first one. She used the "difficult" gesture. Oh my! Becky was the best scorer among us...and if she thinks the picture is hard, we die liao. The next one, XiaoXi confirmed that with us. Then, Johan went to peep at the picture. According to him, it was a river. That set all of us in a frantic. We started researching on the conversation topics for nature, conservation, protection of envrionment and stuff. Oh my! The time-keeper keep peeking in on us...probably becuase we are sitting way too near the window and she thinks we are cheating (well, her suspicions were right! Ha!) Soon, slowly, the numbers started to dwindle......Until 4.15, when it's my turn to go out to read.   Ahh! The picture was NOT about a river. It was about an Indian man making teh tarik. Dman that Chin Kang! how did he see a river when it is a coffeeshop?! The passage is quite easy, except that it is unusually long. I spent equal time on both components...although the time-keeper stopped me before I can think up of a conclusion.  After Jason came out, it's my turn! Oh no! I went inside...but was chased out because they hasn't finished discussing Jason's marks (Jason said Mrs Thong and the time-keeper giggled at me! HaHa!). Then, I was too busy looking at Jason talking to Mrs Thong that I didn't notice the examiner calling my name. HaHa! I finally realised she's calling me...  I stepped into the examination room, greeted them and took a seat. I started reading. I made quite a number of pronunciation mistakes. I think I did rather well in the expression department. Ha!   Moving on to picture description! I did rather well, I must say. I could have been more detailed in the description of characters, but I did rather well. After describing and interpreting most of the picture components, I went on to talk about my experience with drinking teh tarik. Then, due to the need to conclude, I had to say "In conclusion". Then  I paused. I don't know what to conclude! The male examiner prompted me and said, "In conclusion?". I said, "Er. In clonclusion...I love tea!" and gave a broad smile. That set both examiners off laughing. HaHa! Nothing to say ma! Don't what to say ma!  Moving on to conversation. That's the most interesting part. I was asked "In the passage, the writer talks about herbal drinks. What do you think of herbal medicines?" Oh my! What a dream question! I have so much experience in drinking herbal medicines (because i visit a Chinese practicioner when I am sick), I got a lot to talk about! However, one rather amusing thing was that the examiners keep laughing at me. I have to stop more than twice to ask them why (and to let them recollect themselves). My points funny meh? They said I was too nervous, and therefore, making the way I speak turns out to be funny. HaHa! Anyway, I felt that I did rather good too. I looked at both of them in the eye and I didn't require much prompting. A improvment, yeah!  At the end of the oral session, they apologised for laughing and disturbing my oral. I took the opportunity to ask them how I fare (yes! I did that!). They said I did rather well and I had good vocabulary, and I could be less nervous. I asked them if my nervousness would result in a loss any marks. They replied, "Not really. We would take into consideration that you are nervous, that's all" (which XC said they would minus about 1-2 marks...oh well). I felt immesnely relieved and left the room, thanking them.   After that, a group of us met Mrs Thong and enquired about the examiners' comments. They told her that we did well (and told Thong about me...which they repeated I got good vocab and I did well) on the whole. The people (even numbers) who did on the herbal medicines generally scored lower than those (odd numbers) who did "what's your special place for relaxation?". Ahh...oh well! After chatting with Thong for quite a while, we went back. We discussed a lot more on the bus journey. We stared at Tsung when he got on the bus, hopefully making him to ask us what we said. He noitced our staring and said, "Why? Your oral just finished?" and moved towards the back. HaHa!  On the whole, I felt statisfied with my oral results. :) And rather confident too. I think I am ending here. Goodnight!

      Ohh! Today is the day we are are waiting (and fearful) for! Today is the day where it decides our destinies as Mother Tongue students. Today is the the release of MT results! Ahh! Wanna know my results? Read the following paragraph(s) then!   I already had an inkling of today's release day, due to some unconfirmed rumors in the GameFaqs message board. HaHa. And I was calling everybody up (so many sleepyheads!)! HaHa! By today, I was feeling quite nervous lor. This is a matter of life and death. Okay, not really. But it is pretty important! I want to skip MT! I want to! Even though I know I can't really achieve A, there's a part in me that hopes. :) During MT lesson, Zhang came in...with a bundle of papers! AHH! It's the results! All of us felt pretty tense up....the moment arrived! Zhang read out Wendy's name.....but to Wendy's chargin, he refused to tell her her marks, but he made a comment, "Woah! Never knew that our Bao Yu.." which basically meant that she got A already. Then, I requested for my name to be read out. I crossed my fingers.....Zhang said ,"Xiang Wei Kao De Bu Chuo! Na Yi Ge Er Gui Lai (Kelvin did pretty well. He got an A2!)!" I was estactic! I was overjoyed! I was extremely happy! I clapped loudly and yayed (which, according to WQ, said he can hear me in the next door!)! From the rest of the moment onwards, I wore a huge grin on my face! There were few others who got the prestigous A (Jesmine, Mun Peng, ChinChuan). Finally, when it came to Wendy's name. Mr Zhang asked her, "What marks do you wish to get?" She said, "As long as I got a B3, I am happy le". Zhang replied with a smile, "Well...you got better than a 3, (to which everybody clapped and she started crying out of joy!), but not better than a 1". Congrats to everyone who got an A!! Our hard work finally paid off! Wendy was crying out of happiness. We are so happy. Then, Hann, Manda and some 4/5ers came back. Hann and Amanda got As (1 and 2 respectively!)! We were so happy for each other! We kept jumping around, shaking each other's hands!   Then, we were told to enter 4/6...the sacred classroom! Ahh! The first time stepping in there, and knowing that you are gonna stay there forever.....the feeling's so great! I beamed at CQ and WQ and expressed my joys and happiness! They were preparing for oral. I kept grinning and beaming, like a stupid idiot. Hann too! I almost came close to tears. I can't believe I got A! At last! For my 4 years at Riverside, I never gotten an A in my chinese before...until now! And this is the Os some more! Ahh! Then, XC walked in! He got an A2 too! YaY! Then...Huang came in! She asked XC to read out the results. CQ got an A1 (we 'yes!' him) and so did Janet (we high-fived!)! Woo-hoo! Suprisingly, WQ and Gao Luan got B3. Not really that surprising for WQ...but definitely for Gao Luan. He's an A1 student. WQ looked dejected. Ah.....WQ! I believe you can do better for the next round! Keep improving! After that, all of us chatted there.  After that, we flew down to talk to Mr Du! Ahh! Hann was so happy he kept prancing around! :) Mr Du said a lot of encouraging words and gve us some useful advices. We went down to the board..got even happier when we saw our As..and went to the canteen to eat. WQ is gonna appeal, but I don't know leh. Hmm....me and Amanda talked a lot about our As and what happened in Zhang's class (what he did to Wendy). Later, Hann told us we were insensitive towards WQ. Opps! Our bad! Then, I accompanied the Band 3 to go up to look for Mala...I wanted to look for Hu.  I saw Hu Lau Shi and montioned her forwards! I told her joyfully that I finally got an A! And while shaking her hand, I was jumping up and down! She was very amused and congratulated me for a job well done! I took a picture with Hu (along with WQ)! I am gonna put this pic inside Hu's present this year! I keep thanking her for teaching me! Yeah! :) I wandered around while waiting for them to talk to Mala. I saw Bright....and told him I got an A! He was happy for me! :)...then I met Mrs Thong! I gleefully ran up to her and told her I got an A! She congratulated me again! :) I am like so crazy...telling everyone I got an A! HaHa! I got confidence for my orals le...I feel I can do it! Yeah! Go Kelvin!  Ehh....today nothing interesting happened in Maths remedial. Me and KS chatted...only doing 2 problems! HaHa! Then, Me, XC, Gloria and HuiLing went down to the canteen...where we met our oral friends! Found out that today's topic is quite difficult (Most boring event and scary experiences). O.o!! I hope tomorrow's topic is easy!   Hmm...today Dad's taxi did not start again! So maddening! I think it is throwing a tantrum before it's being scrapped! Ahh! I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to the taxi! Bye bye front passenger seat! I sit on you so many times! I amg onna miss my dear friend. Goodbye belt! Although you sometimes tangle yourself and annoyed me to death, I still miss you! Bye bye back passenger seats! Thanks for being so comfy and making a nice bed to lie on! Bye bye taxi! I miss you! And I got a part of you sticking to my cabinet door!   Ahh! That's about all! I think I am going off soon! Charmed's showing! Can't wait! Wee-hoo! Goodnight all! :)

      Heya! I just came back from watching "Singapore's Brainist Kid". What a cool show. So easy question. I definitely know the answer to "Which creature guards the wizard prison in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"!! It is....Dementors (smirks). Ha! Many easy questions too. I will definitely be tuning in next week!  Ahh! I played FFIX. And I realised I have been extremely short-changed. The FMVs are terribly short...like cut off halfway. I didn't even get to see Odin attacking Cleyra! How unfair. Wendy informed me that this is typical of pirated games and XC said that my disk is spoilt. Ahh! Oh. Update: I downloaded the FMV. The scene is spectacular! Well, I pity the Cleyra people.....the shrine and everything was destroyed... And I only rescued 4 Cleyra cats! The two Burmecians kids and 2 oracles. Ahh! I believe we are going to Alexandaria next. Yeah.   Today, Hann brought a tape recorder, which they used to record their own voices. Some people needs more practice (when I mean more, I mean REALLY REALLY MORE), while others can keep up the good work (Well done!). Hmm....I don't know about you, but they keep using "Our EL is much worse than yours". This is a totally  PATHETIC  excuse. Spinless, useless. Like I got more marks than them in the Oral. Must be Mala's influence. Hann told me yesterday (or was it today?) not to come too close, or once Mala sees me getting too near, they would be in big trouble (She glared at me last time, when I was hanging around them while they are practising oral! Hmp!). Why would she want to do that to her students? Stress her students up so much. Prevents contact with other bands. What is this? This is call "taking our friends away from us!"  AND. IT. IS. TERRIBLY. UNFAIR.  They make oral until like so stressful. Studying should be  FUN . We should not study for the sake of studying/getting good marks. Ergh! I am totally disgusted.  Ahh! I am so gonna miss the old taxi tomorrow. Must treat it extra well tomorrow. Yep! Dad told me that he has to get the car to the factory at 5.30am, for removal of essential items (the MDT, the cashcard machine) then drive over to the compact factory in Woodlands (just a short drive away from home...good. He can go home easily.). Ahh! He will be getting his new taxi next Thursday, 1pm. YaY! So excited. Dad also gave me one of the number plates in this taxi (SHA 9304P). I will be pasting it somewhere in my room! :)  This inspired me to tell you about funny incidents that happened during the taxi-rides. I shall narrate one today. You see ar, everytime I go off right, I would say "Bye PaPa". And my usual practise is to sleep during the car ride. So, last week, instead of saying "Bye PaPa" after waking up, I said "Goodnight Mummy". And started guaffaws between the girls. so embarrassing. Must be my sleepiness. :P   Ehh! Gotta go offline le! Wishing everyone the best for their orals tomorrow! Goodnight!

      Ahh! What an interesting experience! I just came back from honoring our dearly departed. No, there wasn't any sarcasm if you are wondering. I treat the whole thing quite seriously, because this is the time where the Yip family bond together, and ask for new hopes, dreams and wishes to be fulfiled. I thought of adding Wicca elements into the thing (mainly, asking our ancestors to join in), but my mom told me it is for every ghosts in this planet (Actually, this 7-Month Festival is a Chinese version of Halloween! Wee! I get to celebrate the same festival twice!), so I abandoned my plan and just blessed the incense for luck, prosperity and success. Well, what we did downstairs was light some candles and incense, threw food around (for the hungry ghosts...this isn't called the Hungry Ghost Festival for nothing!) and burned the blessed incense papers. I had fun, actually. Now here I am, whole body smelling of ash. HaHa! This iis a great spiritual experience, for it allows me to mix Taoism (or rather, Buddhism...or a mixture of both) with Wiican elements. I had fun doing it. And now I already have a plan to celebrate Halloween (Samhian, pronounced as sow-en). :)  Today, I received news that the conversation topic is very easy. It is on hobbies! Awww! Oh well......I hope I can have another easy topic.  Ah! Today, during recess, a very interesting thing happened. A chicken drumstick was dropped on the table by someone, and he refuse to eat it. Woah! Me and Hann scolded him for blatant wastage of food. The chicken gives it life (or rahter, leg) to fill our stomach. Now, its purpose is not fulfiled. It gave its life away for nothing. And come on lor, the table is clean. He is indirectly insulting our cleaning staff for not doing a good job! Amanda joined in later, bringing up the part about straving children in Third-World countries. Woah! You know what he did?! In a fit of anger, he threw the druimstick onto my plate. Wnhy am I making such a fuss? One, because it is rude. Two, because it is a vegetarian plate he threw into! He contaminated the vegetarian plate...poor vegetarians who is gonna eat out of the contaminated plate. Involuntarily ate something (or the oil of) which they adhor. It doesn't really matter if the plate is from another store. It is just plain rude that he threw it into a vegetarian plate. I must make this known that this is an incosiderate action. Please don't do that in the future. And eat any dropped chicken drumstick. It won't kill you. The table does not carry AIDS virus.  Oh yes! I ordered photos from SL. :)...looks like I gotta spend more money ordering photos! HaHa! I am ordering any phtos which shows my face....okay, the one which I posed in. Sigh...no money....Father not working for a week, don't know how to get pocket money. So, it is back to daily mashed potatoes and 50cents drinks for me. Only. For the entire day. Sigh.I hope the new taxi (WQ ar! Hear it properly. NEW taxi! NEW NEW NEW!) comes sooner! Oh weel. Dad's staying home for a week starting this Thursday. At least he can give Mom some company. HaHa!   Ahh! My FFIX....I reached Cleyra....blah blah blah....saw the evil clowns extracting Endiolions from Garnet....defeated the Antlion, which is very tyco, because every one of my party members died except for Freya (she jumped), then killed the monster. HaHa!  Ahh...waiting for CQ's call, so we can do History homework together. Ahh...that's all, I think. Goodnight!

      Hey Hey! It's a Sunday! A weekend! That's so hard to come by.   Today woke up at 8.15. Bathed for 30 freaking minutes...that's what I usually do on weekend mornings. I take long slow baths. Nice one. Actually, I spend most of my time thinking.  Watched Digimon, then Yu-Gi-Oh, then Beyblade and then Jackie Chan Adventures. After that, surfed the net for more FF info. I upgraded my website to tables form. Congrats to moi! Now, working on the colour scheme. Ahh! Even the colour scheme meowed.   After eating lunch, went to play FFIX. I goy my first Chocograph and my first treasure chest. Ahh! Good job ar, KY! I beat the Gizamuluke dragon. Finally! I moved on Burmecia, where I am effectively lost. Sigh! I hate fightinf the lizards thingy. They keep gradually petrifying me! I hope to learn Jelly soon for all my characters! Oh. That will prevent petrify/gradual petrify! That will! Ahh!  Hmm...after that went to Wendy's to do Physics TYS. Well, let's just say we did nothing. Yeah! HaHa! I go there to look at her brothers playing FFIX and Wendy scanning photos. I must tell you one incident. You see ar, at Friday, when riding the MRT to Jurong East, Hann took a photo of XL sleeping. And all of them said that the soul will be captured in the camera. YH commented "Sekali at night the camera will go 'oooh ooh' (sound XL makes..according to Hann)". I was thinking about it at Wendy's house, and I suddenly laughed. And laughed and laughed. I laughed till I cried. I am freaking out! LOL! Hann has that effect on people! HaHa! After that, went to 888 to eat dinner with Wendy. Chatted with her and her mother about MT results. So nervous and exciting. I think I can do well, but there is this side of me that fears that I have to retake the MT Os. And the most freaking thing is that the "fear" always win the "hope". I am so scared. I am scaring myself. KY, Stop it ar!  Ahh! I can't believe I forgot to tell you that Miss Choo gave the seniors a card with a personalized message on it. I type out for you ar. "Dear Kelvin, Thank u for being part of the daily blessings in life. A consistent and committed student, who has developed and grown not only musically, but also as a young adult. Your batch and you will be greatly missed. All the best to you! From: Miss Choo" Ahh! So nice to read, and touching too! Thanks Miss Choo! Hope you will continuing having a blessed life! :)  I think I end here le...see ya blog! Goodnight!

      Woop! Today's National Day, where Singapore celebrates it's 38th birthday! Happy Birthday, Singapore!   Woke up at 8++ today. such rare moments, for Saturdays are usually spent waking up real early to go to choir. Sigh. Graduate liao, so many free time! Plyed FFIX there. Didn't make much progress. I got Chooco to ride on! Coolies! Continuing tomorrow. Yeah!  After that, ate breakfast (carrot cake) and watched cartoons till 11.30. Then, I went online for a brief period. Chatted, find FFIX info and ate lunch (instant noodles!).  I went to Wendy's house in the afternoon to do my MT and Physics homework. Well, I managed to complete my MT homework. I lent Wendy my zhuo ye (Major update: I took Wendy's zhuo ye back home! HaHa! Now she has nothing to copy with!  "You idiot!" ). After that, she taught me how to use the FTP program and showed me how to make tables. I am gonna make a temporary page that says something about my site being in construction. Yeah, do that later lor. And Wendy sold me her blog file. YaY! Got a much nicer one. I am decorating it tomorrow! Yep yep!  Came home and bathed just in time for NDP. HaHa! The choir has the fan (the traditional chinese fan) again! So beautiful! I want, and I bet CQ wants too! So jealous of them. Oh! I found out the choereographer is Slyvia McCully again! Yep! She has been choreographing the choir for 9 years! Wow! She's a cool teacher, funny at times, yeah! HaHa! The shows are wonderful. Just don't ask me how the main performance went. I fell alsleep halfway. Yes. What a pig! I woke up just in time to catch Stephanie Sun singing the National Day song for 2003, One United People.   After the NDP, I went to pack my bag for Monday's lesson and came online. Ahh! I think I go work on my website and print out the blog entries le. See ya tomorrow! goodnight all!

      HaHa! FFIX update first. I went into Gizamaluke Grotto and got to the part where I have to fight the crazy Gizamaluke, a big big big dragon. And I lost terribly. Ahh! I hate losing! I must win that giant dragon cat! And get Ice Staff from him. And I read from the guide I am completing Disc 1 soon, after I fought Beatrix. O.o!!  Okay...today's National Day celebration was okay. We all grouped together during singing of the songs...haha! At the end, we even ran around the parade square! So fun! HaHa! The class performaces wasn't so bad...some bored me, some didn't. By the time it ended, my legs were terribly numb. And we didn't win the Photo Essay competition. Ahh.....that's okay. Hmm...We tried our best (okay...Amanda did!). We are proud of her.  After that, we recieved news that there was no E-Maths lesson! Whoppeee! We took a lot a lot of photos! Posed a lot of wacky pose! HaHa! Have to spend a lot of money liao, to get the copies of the photos. HaHa! After that, set off with YiChun, Clar, SuPing, Xue Lin, Amanda, Wendy and Hann towards IMM for a whole afternoon of shopping!  While waiting for the IMM bus to fetch us, they started reminsing about the Penang trip they took. Yit Hann was telling (or rather, complaining) about his horrid experience there. He was sleeping, and he was annoyed everybody did not look hard enough for him. Clar told us something about WQ! Arr WQ arh! Never knew he's so  hot  with the girls (smirks)! Finally, the yellow bus arrived and we squeezed into it. Me and YiChun turned out to be one of the last to get on bus, after giving way to many people (especially old folks). Bus journey took quite long, as we have to stop a many many traffic lights. We arrived there about 10+ minutes later.  We went inside, and after walking a few steps, we saw a totally cool car! It was a F1 racing car! And driven by Micheal Schumacher some more (and powered by Helix Shell). There was his driver's suit hanging there too. Ahh! WQ missed out! Don't go some more! Then, we decided to shop at (name to be edited later), where everything sells for $2. Yeah! Everything! But alas! I had no money...after paying Wendy the $2.50 I owed her, and I still have to eat lunch. I was eyeing some owl statues (representing Athena). Shopped there for about an hour, where SuPing and Hann brought things. Then, hunger overtook us and we went to eat.  We ate a lot of stuff. I ate yong tau fu, Hann and Amanda ate lasksa, YiChun ate curry chicken , Wendy ate Western crusine, SuPing ate some herbal rice and soup, XueLin ate some Ipoh noodles and Clar ate (Ipoh hor fun. I was eyeing Chun's, Manda' and Hann's laksa/curry! I want to eat laksa (I drank some of Chun's curry whenh she went out! You are so bad ar, KY!)! Long time never eat le! So jealous! Later, Chun and Manda ate apple pies.  After that, we went back to the $2 shop again. This time, we played with the toys there! HaHa! So funny! We played with guns, masks and toys! The children side in all of us! Ahh! I love the tiara the best! So fun that one! I have been longing to wear a tiara! Yeah yeah. I know I am freaky! :P  After shopping there, we went into some bookstore. Woah! They have quite a number of New Age books and evena  whole section full of tarot decks! Ahh! Stayed there for so long, they even asked Wendy to ask me out. HaHa! She knew where to find me (in the New Age section) and even spent time there looking at the books and decks too! We left there quite happily and a bit unwillingly.   All of us decided to rest at tthe "stage" before going home. The stage has a ramp, great for walking catwlalk. I catwalked around a lot of times (at one point, a couple was laughing at me. Or so Hann informed me! Ha!). so fun to catwalk. Manda joined me at one point. HaHa! She wanted to take photos of me, but was afraid she can't, becuase it is a shopping centre and all that privacy stuff. sigh! Great opportunity wasted! Oh no! I am starting to sound like Hann, with the the celebrity thingy! HaHa! Decided to go back at 3.50+ (Hann sang the "Zha!" on the way down. I hope nobody knows which school we are from! HaHa!).  One ironic thing was that the message on the bus that takes us back to the Jurong West MRT station. It has a message saying "Hop on this bus for a fun-filed experience", to which Wendy and I said "Yeah right!". Going home is not exacty fun-filled. Ha! How inapporiately named.   On the MRT back home, Hanm slept while I am engrossed in my Reader's Digest. While both of us were busy doing our own things, something interesting happened. Apparently, someone dare his friends to approach our girls and ask for their phone numbers (oh my!). Their laughs and saying Hann's names attracted our attention. It turned out that they wanted to give Hann's number to the person, if he ever did ask. HaHa! Hann then said loudly his handphone number! HaHa! So meowingly funny.  Reached back home at 5+. Took a bath, watched Sabrina, ate dinner, went to Benjamin's house to fix his modem and came online. HaHa! Today was a fun day!   Gotta go le! Goodnight all! And Happy pre-National Day.

      Ahh! Sabrina The Teenage Witch is showing! YaY! The new season! Whoo-hoo! Finally! After more than a year! Sabrina returns! And it is gonna be a weekdaily affair! Yippee! ~Sings: Things are going way too fast, I wanna make it last!~  Didn't get to play FFIX today. I came home really later after EL Practice Session. Had fun during the practice session, even though I was too nervous. HaHa! But I was lucky! Mrs Thong asked me the question me and Joyce was practicing moments before (What school do you study in? It is a mixed school or a single sex school?). HaHa! Came up with the points. Mrs Thong said good, and after I told her I practised that question before the Oral session, she said I should continue to do this for my orals! :) I will, Mrs Thong! HaHa!  Today, CQ decided that he doesn't want to sing with the choir tomorrow! WHAT IS THIS?!!! CQ said before he don't care if none of the sec 4 are joining us, he will still sing! Now now! Look at what happened! Ayioh! I want to sing with the choir, and I insist CQ and Wendy come along too! They promised!! Never mind! Tomorrow is not too late! Can still persuade CQ to sing during the morning! Ahh! I want to sing with the choir!   Oh, in case you are wondering, the one who scored 16 in the bio test along with me is Eugene. Oh. What a surprise. Oh well.  Oh oh! My ordered NDP t-shirt is extremely big! I ordered 2 sizes too big! HaHa! I thought I wear M....so I ordered L, for furture use. But! But! My mother told me I wear S! I should have ordered M! Ah! Oh well.   Hmm! I log off le la! See ya tomorrow! Me-ow Meow!

      Okay! First thing first! FFIX Updates. I went to Qu's Marsh and got Quina to join my party. Yeah! She's kinda like useless lor.....only can Eat the enemies when they are weak. And by the time they are weak, they will be killed off by ViVi, Zidane or Freya. Now, I am outside the something Grutto. Must pass that to get to Burmuceia. Yeah. I like ViVi the most! Magic users appeal to me best! Heh! I think I am putting a page for FFIX in my website, which is soon gonna be built.  I can't believe I forgot to mention a very important news. My father won the appeal! YaY! I am so happy! He's getting a new taxi! Whoppee! No more monthly breakdowns (This month's breakdown happened on the 2nd)! New taxi and everything! I am so gonna miss my regular seat (the front passenger seat). Hmm! Ahh! I hope they will have a working radio! The radio spoilt ages ago! Finally can listen to music in the car! And of course, this means that we won't be facing a finanacial difficulty soon. :) And that also means that my father will be home for a week, because we have to wait a week to get his new car! Tell you hor....every morning I wait for my father downstairs right? Well, this morning, a Citycab taxi drove down and parked next to me. I was like very puzzled and ignored the taxi. Then, the taxi-driver opened the door! It was Pa! How come I didn't recongise? Because the sign-board has been removed! I thought it was another taxi! HaHa! Come to think of it, it was embarrassing! My mother laughed! HaHa! She saw everything!  Hm...what to say today? Oh yeah! I got 16 for my Bio test! YaY! I am the highest (along with one other mystery person!! I wonder who!)! Hann says that I have reached my peak and dropping soon. Let me declare again! I  DO NOT  believe in this stupid curve whatsoever! I am not dropping! I shall not drop! Ha!   Oh yes! Me, CQ and Wendy are gonna sing along with the choir! And we may end up being the only seniors there! HaHa! Well! Low invited us, and hey! This is our last chance performing! We want to enjoy ourselves! Besdies, for 3 years, we perform wih the choir every National Day. This year, if we are not perorming along, we would feel very uncomfortable. HaHa! Looking at the choir sing when we are not singing....very weird lor!  Today, after tutition, I am in an extra-jovial mood! I think it would be because I learnt loads at tutition today. Besdies mastering the concepts of straight line graphs, I also understoood what magnetic induction is, thanks to my tutor! He majored in Physics in his University...haha! Wendy said I am too perky for my own good today. She also said that sometimes I am happy because to keep other people happy. Ha...I don't know that. When I am feeling sad or angry, I will show one lor. Even if it means irritating Hann and CQ to death. Ha!   I think I log off le. See ya tomorrow! Bye bye!

      HaHa! I think I shall start a FFIX Updates whenver I play FFIX. Such an exciting game! I completed the Festival of the Hunt just now. I didn't get first, Freya did. According to my brother, she always got first, so no suprise here! Well, I am proud of my 141 score (she scored 151! HaHa!). Luckily I Synthesized The Orge (2 Mage Masher needed!)...so I got a powerful weapon for Zidane now. Now, I am about to start on my jounrey to Burmuceia. Yep!  I brought the things needed for my Blog File....so I will be doing that later, after I printed out the August entries. Yeah! I hope it goes well!  Today, Wendy looked very down. It started with her refusing to go into the Choir room. I don't know what's going on. I guess she doesn't want to meet a particular somebody there. She looks depressed. I do hope she will feel better soon. Yeah. Feel better SOON. Oh yes! Save money for wallet ar, KY!  Today, during remedial, Mrs Chew told us we have to write our own tesimony. HaHa! It's like CV (resume) lor....cannot be bashful about yourself! Come to think of it, this is kinda funny. I "testify" that KY is a good person. HaHa! And future employers would think that this is written by teachers. Ha! So fun! I advise those who are writing your own testimony that you cannot be shy...this is NOT the time to be saying, "Ayioh! So buay hao bai!". It's the time to recongise your talents, your values, your good points. If you are gonna be shy and humble, then I would say that your testimony would be very short. And too modest. Praise your own talent! Recongise you! Yeah!!  Think I write until here le. See ya next time! Byes!

      Ah! I tried printing this blog, and you know what? I never wasted more paper in my whole life! My 38 entries is much thicker than Wendy's 50+ entries combined....and her entries are LONG too. I felt so disgraceful! So ashamed of myself! I could have used a smaller font. I should have. But never mind. There's still time to "repair" my damage! I shall, starting from July's entries, print in a smaller font. Yes! Here comes tree-saving Kelvin!  Hmm...I didn't get the highest this time in Chem. Hann and CQ broke my record. How miraculous. I think determination made them won. But of course, I left out a simple question that I know how to do. That made me lose my 1st place position. This is the most yue wang mistakes of all yue wang mistakes. Doing and getting it wrong because you don't know is much better than not doing and getting it wrong not because you don't know, but you overlook the question! However, I am glad because I got FULL marks in the Fermentation question. Yes yes. I know. Self-pitying is so pathetic. I also said I would gladly lose to CQ, Hann, Janet or Wendy! And I shall take up my word! Why! I am so happy for both of them! Congrats (Are you being fake? I dunnoe this time!)! I think I need time to cool down. What's the big deal right? Just a test only ma.....  Sigh! Hm...today there was no remedial whatsoever, so we stayed back to chat...then went to Causeway Point. A most embarrassing incident happened! As we (Me, CQ, XC, Janet, SL) came out of Popular, we saw a most disturbing image! Few police officers were leading a handcuffed boy in front of them. What is so disturbing and embarrassing? Because! Because the boy is wearing a Riverside uniform! Yes!! How disgraceful! A lower sec Indian boy. We, being ever so inquisitive, trailed the group to the front of Chamelon shop (selling beauty products!). The police took picutres there! Ahh! We infered that the boy stole something from Chamelon, probably for his girlfriend, and got arrested! Such a dishonorable act! Disgrace to Riverside! And we were disgraced along with him too! By a couple! Yes!! We went down the escalators. A couple was discussing the acts of the stupid critter, suddenly saw us and pointed at us (in my direction some more!) and said, "Isn't that boy from their school? This is how they taught them?". All of us heard it and were very embarassed! We were dragged into this mess along! Stupid boy! Steal steal steal! See la! All your fault!   Okay...I think I end here liao (YaY! I got into Lindbum! After defeating all 3 idiotic Black Waltzs, which I was nearly killed by the second one! Ergh!). See ya tomorrow!

      Today was eventful. Yep it was.   I had a very weird dream last night. It was about my mother. She was gonna die the next day, so for that whole day, we spent time together as a whole family, enjoying each other's company while it lasted. It was touching, if you can ignore the death part. Yeah. I woke up when Mother was about to go to sleep. Anyway, Wendy checked out my dream interpretation in her dream book. It turned out my dream means that me and my property is in danger. Hmm..   In the morning, did the usual cartoons-watching. Then, at 11, Mother asked me to fold those incense paper to be burnt on 11th August. I love folding those things! So fun. Folding incense paper reminds me of the incident at my godfather's funeral. On Wednesday night, the whole family went there to pay our respect. We soon settled down round a table, joining my grandmother (maternal side) and my aunt. They were folding those incense, so we just took some and folded along with them. Then, my aunt commented that my way of folding and how the paper turned out looked like my mother's. Gradmom agreed too. This is like such a weird comment. I still remembered it. Anyway, we folded and folded. We noticed that the number of paper provided seem to have decreased, compared to past years. Mother became disgusted and said that the production people are slacking. HaHa! After that went online and then ate lunch (chee cheong fun).   After that, Mother and I went to the library to collect my reserved book (Book of Shadows: The Unofficial Guide To Charmed)! I waited so long for that book! Anyway, I was thinking of finding Wendy's mom there (who work as a cleaner in the library). After I collected my book, I went around looking for her. It's so hard to find her! So many cats, and such a large space! At the first floor, I spotted a cleaner collecting rubbish, so I followed her, hoping she would lead me to Wendy's mom. Yes! I am serious! I really did it! But she went into the "Staff" room....so I thought Wendy's mom could have been inside the Staff room after all. I abandoned my search and went back to my mother. HaHa! Wendy saw me following the cleaner (she thought I was going to the toilet, since the Staff room is near the toilet! HaHa!). She was doing homework with WanXin and LeYu in the cafe. Later, I told Wendy what really happened, and she laughed. She said I am crazy! Don't you guys think so too? HaHa!   After that, came back and surfed the Internet till 5+. Then, I played FFIX. YaY! I finally got out of Ice Cavern! YaY! After that, went into the Dali Village and saved the game. Ate dinner, bathed and then studied Bio. Here I am now, writing in my blog. I might print this out...hmm!   Today not putting any lyrics. HaHa! Too lazy too. Maybe you will see one tomorrow? Depends on my mood la! Ha! Goodnight!

      Heya! I finished homework le! Okay, not really. I have Physics TYS (but that's due 3 weeks later...so can take time) and A-Maths worksheet (don't plan on starting anytime soon!). Oh well. Homework completed.  AHHH!! QI SHI WO! I cancelled the file transfer in Kazaa! That Charmed video file! 400+MB you know!!!  I been downloading it last week! I thought can complete by this weekend one you know! But! But!!! My stupid fingers pressed "Cancel Download" instead of "Find More Sources"! I hate myself! I hate SLOW Kazaa Users, who made me press wrong button! I hate it!!! AHH! I lost all my mood of downloading le. PAH! Whatever la!!  Hmm! Today, at Wendy's house, Lassie was being bathed. And later she went into a very bad mood, which I was being ignored. Hmp! After doing homework (okay, and also while doing History homework), I watched Wendy and her brother playing FFIX. HaHa! So fun to watch. Wendy tried to teach me the card game. I don't really know how to play lor...but I can grasp the simple idea. Yeah. HaHa! And I let Lassie licked me all over my leg. So ticklish! I enjoyed it very much, even though it's a bit disgusting.   Oh yes! I can't believe I forgot to mention yesterday. Clarissa told us yerterday that Mrs Jalil was a policewoman before being a teacher! Coolies! No wonder she is so disciplined and strict. HaHa! I would like to see her in her police uniform. That would be cool! I wonder which district did she serve.....Hmm...  Ayiah! I still can't grasp the Lady Marmalade song yet! Must learn it hard!!   Hmm...for today's lyrics of the day, I shall have one of my old-time favourite song. I listened to it today in Wendy's house. Here it is:    Lucky - Britney Spears   This is a story about a girl named Lucky…   Early morning, she wakes up Knock, knock, knock on the door It's time for makeup, perfect smile It's you they're all waiting for They go… "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?" And they say…  [CHORUS:] She's so lucky, she's a star But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking If there's nothing missing in my life Then why do these tears come at night  Lost in an image, in a dream But there's no one there to wake her up And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning But tell me what happens when it stops? They go… "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?" And they say…  [Repeat CHORUS]  "Best actress, and the winner is…Lucky!" "I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky" "Oh my god…here she comes!"  Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl? She is so lucky, but why does she cry? If there's nothing missing in her life Why do tears come at night?     Cool right! I like Britney's songs! HaHa! That's all for today! Goodnight folks!

      Oh look! I went to the Meet-The-People Session, where ordinary residents get to meet MPs and pour out their grievences. Yeah, it's regarding my father's case.   Ayioh! A word of advice. Be there EARLY. Yes! We got number 32. I tell you ar! It's a tortuous wait of 2 hours, where we watch numbers 1-31 file past us. There is the waiting room 1, where everyone waits. Then, we proceed on to waiting room 2, where some cats will key in your info. Then, you go on to waiting room 3, where you wait to see the next available MP. I was shivering in there....so cold! And it is in Block 730, inside a PAP kindergarten (it figures. PAP MPs meet us in PAP school).   The MP was kinda nice la. He said he would help us write the letter, which is good. Hmm....and he got a cup of hot, steaming Milo in front of him. Makes me so thirsty. We left at about 9.10+.   Hmm...today afternoon was spent doing homework at the 768 MacDonalds with Wendy, SuPing, Clarissa, Amanda and Yi Chun. Completed EL Compre (yay!) and completed 1/4 of the SS homework. So, got another 3/4 SS source-based and an History SEQ to go (and Physics, if I want to do, that is). So, tomorrow doing at Wendy's again. Yeah. HaHa! Speaking of Wendy's, her mother keep encouraging me to take Lassie back home. Wendy said her mother's only joking la, her mom won't bear to part with Lassie. But her mother wishes Wendy to take care of Lassie more lor (Have you bathed Lassie yet ar, Wendy?). HaHa! I wouldn't mind taking Lassie back home, but Wendy will, and so will my mom. If Wendy ever lets Lassie breed with another Shetlet, I want the puppy! Wee!   These days, I keep singing Lady Marmalade ( Strutting her stuff in the streets  ! ). Sang it with Siva during EL lessons. Sang it while waiting for MP. Sang it everywhere. HaHa! Dunnoe why leh...find that song very catchy. Ahh!   Ahh..now for the song of the day. This one I like very much. The tune is very catchy. Yep! There you go! I shall present:     My Only Wish This Year - Britney Spears    Last night I took a walk in the snow.  Couples holding hands, places to go  Seems like everyone but me is in love.   Santa can you hear me  I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss  I sent it off  It just said this  I know exactly what I want this year.  Santa can you hear me.

      Heya. Today's the end of exams. Frankly speaking, today was kinda tiring. I think I am having a fever.  Okay. today's the last day of the Prelims. Biology Paper 1. I think, in lieu of my sickeness, I shan't discuss this paper. A depressing topic. Sigh. but let me tell you what happened. After the finishing the paper, I was so damn tired. I cna't sleep, or else I would get scolded. So I drew pics on my paper. After the paper, when I walked home with Janet, I felt realyl lethargic. My legs were weak, I feel like sleeping and my stomach hurts. I think a fever may be befalling upon me. I know these symptoms too well.   I planned to meet Wendy they all to eat Swensen together. I was so tired...I even slept while bathing. Then, I slept for about 15 minutes before going out.   I met Wendy on the 913 bus. Then we met YiChun and they decided to shop while waiting for the rest to arrive. I don't know anything, They went to Popular...but I was so tired, I could sleep. Then, we went outside Swensen to wait for the rest. I even sat down and slept. (Okay, KY! Stop talking about sleeping all the time!) MeiYing said that she would come late, so she told us to go eat first. We finally went in, after saying that nobody else would come.  Well, we went in, participated in a lucky draw. I won crap, but oh well. I didn't use the coupon anyway. We took a long time to decide. I decided on the Swensen Banana Spilt, I forgot what the two ate le. My order came last...hahaha...they took a long time to prepare. While eating ice-creams, we talked about our future. Wendy shared with YiChun what we discussed in her house that day. HaHa. Very silly ideas. But definitely funny.   Hann called and wanted to bring Jackelyn over. We were so excited. In the end leh, only Hann came in. Sigh. Jackelyn too paiseh. Anyway, Amanda and MeiYing came. HaHa! We all shared Earthquake together. I was too fulll at first, but I forced myself to eat lor. Taste nice. We all even promised to meet together next year. HaHa! That's a promise I am looking forward to. And we each have to pay $1.80 more, because of Service Charge. Sigh.   After that, we went to Cold Storage to buy our baking needs. Me and Wendy is gonna try baking  a cake today! HaHa! We brought Chocolate Milk, margarine, flour and cake mix.   After buying all that, they decided to shop at Metro. HaHa! At Metro, I saw a halte! It's almost the same one as what Paige wore last time. Oh god! It looked so damn beautiful! It's black and nice! I tried to make one of them try on the dress, but nobody wanted. Amanda said she's bet with me "Sicssors-Paper-Stone", if she lose, she would try on the halter. And she lost!! HaHa! And it turned out it looked very nice on manda. Seriously. She have the figure to pull it off lor. They said I am pervertic...but hey! I only wanted to see how people looked in it! After that, they went to choose clothes for moi. HaHa! Wendy even picked the wrong clothes....a female one. So paiseh! Well, the clothes were too big, but they said it kinda looked good on me. Hmm.  At 2, Wendy and I went back to her house to bake cake. A very large problem oppped out. The microwave spoilt. The "Start" button is spoilt. Sigh!! We churned out many ideas, but none of them worked. Wendy's mother finally said she will call the neighbours for us. In the end, she found a neighbour on the 12th floor who was willing to help out. We started to make the mix and everything. We can't make it even, we don't have the electric mixer. But we made do with it la.  After doing the mix and everything, Wendy went to fry luncheon meat. I slept in Wendy's room. Then, after frying luncheon, she called me up to fry eggs. She finally learnt how to crack eggs and open them. Good for her! We then continued to fry eggs. It turned out nice, yeah! Wendy offered to make instant noodles for me and told em to go sleep again. Actually hor, I felt guilty. I sleep in her bed while she do all the washing and cooking. She said she don't mind..I was sick after all.  After the mee is cooked and all, we ate and watched Sabrina at the same time. Star World was showing Sabrina Season 1. YaY! The mee taste good, and also the ham and egg. Then, after eating, we watched a bit of Final Fantasy movie. We have to switch it off, because we forgot to buy pork. We delievered the cake mix to Auntie Linda's house for her to bake.   We went down to NTUC buy pork. I can't stand the air-con there. Sigh! And my legs felt weak. I can't stand up for long. We got home quickly and watched the movie. It was very nice and exciting. But, again, we have to stop it halfway to get our baked cake. I hope we can see finish seeing it some other day.  The cake cracked in the middle, but it smells heavenly. We brought it back to Wendy's house. I tried some parts of the cake. The flavour is nice, tasty, but a little too soft. Auntie Linda said we have to add more margarine. Took note of that. I did't enjoy the cake fully, because I got no appetite. I just wanted to get back home to rest. I went home at 6.10 and took 913 bus (felt to tired to walk...) back home.  I took my temperature and found out that I am having a fever of 38.6. Sigh. Expected. I took the bath quite long. And I didn't eat my dinner fully. No appetite.My head hurts and I want to sleep. I managed to watch through 2 hours of TV. Holland V, First Touch and Living With Lydia.   After that, miraculously, my fever disaappeared. Not really a miracle. I took some Panadol. But I wanted to have my fever back. hen I was sick, I have no mood to go to school. Now, I still don't have mood to go school tomorrow. I must make myself sick. I really don't feel like going to school la.   I think I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.

      Heya! It's a beautiful beautiful Monday! And I updated my MSN nick to: "Eggs: Fried Eggs, Steamed Eggs, Boiled Eggs, Half-Boiled Eggs. I Love Eggs!" Isn't it egg-cellent?   Okay okay. No more egg puns. Today, we were tested on A-Maths. But I will go there later. First, I wanna talk about me giving prezzie to my "mo-te-er" (okay okay ...mortal). My Grand Finale. This is actually plan 5 you know! The first plan failed, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th plans were abandoned. I only made up Plan 5 while on the bus to Admiralty Popular. Plan 5 is: giving Wendy "The Official Hamtaro Guide" (or something like that la). HaHa! She was so happy you know! She's so pleased with her prezzie! I feel so happy giving it to her. Finally! :D  Today's A-Maths was the easiest man! Or so everyone thinks. Even Wendy was so happy doing it. I think I cna get quite good marks la. I think. I hope. Meow meow!!  After that, CQ and me stayed back to wait for Gloria and XC to eat with us. What an agonizing 2-hour wait! At first, we were so bored. So, we decided to create Bio MCQ questions to do la. But we only came up with two..hahaha! Then, we borrowed Hann's TYS to test ourselves MCQ till 11 something. Hann, Clar, MeiYing and Sonia then joined us and we gossiped. About teachers marking our scripts ar, about this and that. Hann even wanted to throw his bottle down to hit the Cheung Cheng High kids when they came in the school (we were sitting on the benches outside teacher's offices). HaHa!   Then, at 12, we (along with XC, HL, Gloria and KeYun), gathered around the hungry Mrs Chua to ask her Bio questions to clarify our doubts. She then told us we did okay, and not to worry la, because she has confidence in our Paper 1. Yep! :)  We, the original bunch, plus Hann, went to Causeway Point to eat. On the bus hor, they keep teasing me you know! I was so paiseh until I said "qi shi wo! bao xue guan" like WanWan! HaHa! Everyobdy laughed. :D We went to Causeway to eat. But hor. In order NOT to be the one to ba wei and wait for everybody, I rushed off first. And they decided to punish me by shifting to another table. Woah! Find so xin ku you know!  After we finished eating, we went to Value Shop to buy sweets for Ji and went to the library to help Sonia return book.  I came home at around 2.10 or so. took a bath. I originally decided to study Bio one, but got sian after reading the first page. I went online, then played the Sims (which I haven't for a long long time!). After that, I went online to chat with Wendy! YaY!! Tomorrow can bake cake at Wendy's house le! YaY!! I am so excited! I wanna bake nice tasty cakes! And fry eggs too. I am teaching Wendy how to crack open eggs. HaHa! So excited!  After dinner, I slept a while during Holland V. Too tired, I guess. Then, UI decided to study my Bio. I am quite weak in certain subjects! I must take note of my weakness. Then Uncle Steven came to look at my computer, so he can buy the correct equipment. YaY! I am getting a CD-RW, a new scanner and new RAM. YaY!   After that, I went online lor. Ayiah. I tuoed this blog until very long le. Keep getting distracted and all. I am gonna end here le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!

      Heya! What a beautiful Sunday. With weathers flactuating here and there (thunder...clear skies...thunder...clear skies...you get the picture). But oh well. No rain though!  I woke up at 8.30, and bathed for 30 minutes! I finished just as about Pokemon finished. I read the New Sunday Times. It's quite cool! The designs and everything. More sections too. Coolies! Alright alright. Yes yes! I ate chee cheong fun! Then, I watched cartoons till 11.   I went online. And XC! He added me to his convo with WQ. WQ asking XC to go genting. XC said "ask KY la". I was so embarrassed, and I left the room quickly, because I don't want to see his answer. XC (the idiiot :P) added me back, and I saw "help me ask him". I was like so damn embarrassed that I didn't look at the chatroom for the rest of the time I was online (even though I stayed inside the conversation). I read the Neopian Times, then went off to eat lunch.  After eating lunch and watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge (~sings: wo shi yi ge gu nian!~), I went to Wendy's house to study for A-Maths. But alas! I never really did what I intended.  The first thing Wendy asked me to do is write in her autograph book, NEATLY. I am the first one to sign her book, so I fell honored. I wrote a bit about my bio, then carried on to write 3.5 pages of messages for her. I wrote about how much I appreciate her, about our friendship (and how it is more than that...don't get me wrong....how it is more than close friends, like becoming sisters and brothers.) and a lot of things. I even wrote her a poem. HaHa! Then, she went on to "decorate" my autograph, making smudges beautiful and all that stuff ar. HaHa!   After that, I studied A-Maths until Chapter 5. HaHa! We were distracted and all. We keep talking. About friends. About our past. About our future. Yeah. In the end, we gave up studying altogether.  We went out to boil hot dogs to eat. HaHa! We took out one before water boiled. We found out that it was too hard. So, we boiled the hotdogs till the water boiled. Wendy then came up with this idea of baking cake together. We are so excited about it, and want to do it tomorrow one. But on Monday her father is off from work. Darn. so, we are seeing if Tuesday can bake cake or not! I am so excited! I wanna bake a cake! And oh, if you are wondering, the hot dogs taste nice!  We then went out to eat dinner. Three of us ate chicken rice. I brought back Chicken Chop for brother to eat. $4.50! Oh god! So darn ex! There goes the $7 Mom gave me! I everytime return her change one leh. Like the least $1 she gets back. Now, no change. So...don't know what to say la.  After I came home and bathed, I went off somewhere. Then, coming back, WQ messaged me! He asked me whether to go Genting or not! My heart skipped a beat! Oh god! I can't believe it! I can't believe he's talking to me. I asked Wendy for advice, but she said "You cannot depend on me all the time you know!. I told WQ I haven't made up my mind yet, I need more details. He gave everything to me.....and soon, talking leads to normal conversation. I am glad we finally talked. After so many months. Hm.  Okay. XC read my blog and found out that I am a witch. At first, he was like saying I joined a cult or something. He doesn't know what if witchcraft ma. I pointed him to a Wicca website, and answered a lot of his questions. I think he's basically okay with Wicca la (Are you, XC? HAHA). I am so glad I handled the situation quite well, and it didn't lead to major finger-pointing about Wiccans (which XC called Wiccist at first! haha!) being evil and all (I read people's stories about friends turning nasty on them when found out about their religion....quite scary you know). Hm. I was quite scared and nervous you know, when he asked about Wicca. I thought it would turn out ugly. Luckily, it didn't lor.   HaHa! Okay, I gotta go now. Waiting for Wendy to send something over so I can print it for her. Okay. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.

      Heya! This is wonderful free Saturday! No studying at all! Woo-hoo!  I woke up at 8.30 and bathed for 30 minutes! Woo-hoo! But I can't bath for 30 minutes tomorrow, or else I will miss Digimon and I want to read the New Sunday Times before Digimon. I watched TV while waiting for breakfast. I ate fried carrot cake. This is becoming a ritual. Saturday eat carrot cake, sunday eat chee cheong fun. But nothing else to eat ma! After eating, watched more cartoons.  At 11.30, came online and chatted with XC, Wendy and Ben. I have to clear my SingNet inbox. All full of spam mail! I must unsubcribe to every one, just like what I did to my 60 junk mails from my hotmail account last time. It worked and I only get about like 5 per day. And I noticed a couple of SoBigF virus coming back to my inbox. I thought all erased already? I hope it doesn't escalate into the horrendous 80-100+ SoBigF mails I recieve! Horrible!!  I went to eat lunch at 12.4 and came back online at 1.30. Me and Wendy chatted about Prom Night (I was rather distracted, because I was reading articles on Wicca, and she thought Prom Night bore me). I was like having no idea whether to go or not. If I am going, my friends must go too. Wendy's very enthusiatic about Prom Night. She tried to persuade me to go, saying it wouldn't be fun for her if her close friends weren't there with her. Of course, I felt happy hearing that, but I still have reservations. I think....most probably, I would go lor. The way Wendy describe it, it sounds fun. I haven't decided yet ar! Then, I went off at 3.30 to play FFIX.  Alright! FFIX Updates! With 4 hours of efforts spent, I managed to upgrade my Chocobo to a golden Chocobo (being able to fly) and got all the Chocographs Pieces. I also found the Chocobo Air Garden. YaY! I am trying to find all the Chocograph Pieces I am having a bit of a difficult finding some. But I will look harder!   After FFIX, I ate dinner. While eating, I watched "8 Simple Rules To Date My Daughter" and "The Simpsons". After that, I bathed and came online.   I find myself listening to "Honey's End Of The Line", "Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now" and "Hilary Duff's So Yesterday". I somehow feeel drawn to them. Maybe because of its strong content about moving on from broken relationships. I can really relate! Yeah!  I am eating instant noodles cooked by my father while writing this. I love the way he cooks the noodles. So spicy at the right amounts and so delicious! Yum! I can't bear to eat the last few strands, which are currently sitting on the plate! Ahh! I don't want good food to end!  Okay, I gotta be going now (to painfully, and not so painfully, devour the noodles). See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!

      Hello there! Long time never write in this blog le. 4 days to be exact! Why, you ask? Well, I got examinations. Our prelims to be exact. This is where it determines if we get into the JC for the 1st 3 months or not. I am hoping to score well in this exam.  Alright, lets start from Monday. On Monday, I had E-Maths 1 and SS. I spent too much time on two questions during E-Maths, thus, I have no time to do the last question. And I know some more. Sigh!! Basically, this is an okay paper.  But SS was easy!! Very very easy! HaHaHa! I did the question on conflict and diplomacy with ease. Source-based very easy too. Ahh!! After the exams, I went home with Janet.  In the afternoon, after lunch, I began to study for my Chemistry. Actually, there are two papers on Tues. Chem and A-Maths. But Chem comes first. I studied along with Wendy. My strategy for studying is read textbook first, then notes. Sometimes, I just referred to the notes, as for those chapters, Mrs Chew did not use the textbook. I also taught Wendy all about the chapter in Organic Chem. I hoped she understood what I taught her. I went to bed without even studying for A-Maths.  Tuesday - Ahh! It was a very easy paper for Chem. As usual, it was set by Mdm Rekha. And as usual, she was very protective of her Sec 5s, so she set an easy paper. Why should I be complaining? HaHa! I would like a challenge every now and then, you know. Mrs Chew set challenging papers. I did all 3 Structured Essays. Actually, I chose the first 2. But seeing I got about 30 minutes left, I did qns 3 on the question paper itself. And it turned out my question 3 seemed to score much more for me than 2 (I don't know how to explain "unsaturated" in question 2). So, I asked for another paper and copied down what I wrote in the question paper. And I managed to smuggle out question 2, which I will be correcting when Mrs Chew goes through the answer (see how well I can do for the topic ma!!). And ayiah! A-Maths was horrible. And while doing, a horrible feeling came to me. I got very scared. I realized that I am gonna flunk my A-Maths, and I don't want! I need A-Maths for JC!! Sigh. This tells me that I am gonna put in a lot of work on Sunday for A-Maths. Oh well.  After that, I rushed down to meet my parents, who will be driving me to Woodlands Central to eat. We met SL outside and we gave her a free ride to her uncle's funeral. I ate the hor fun my mom recommended. Ahh! It was very nice! I am gonna try the ti meen some other time. Then, my mother shopped for a wallet for brother. My mother said "My son only likes a particular type of wallet" and the uncle thought I was the "son". He said "Young children don't be so fussy hor. Try this wallet". I looked at him and said, "I am not the one who's buying....". He said "oh!". Then, we went home. I studied History for about an hour. Only 4 chapters to study....so easy. Then, I went online to relax. At night, I watched Brainiest Kid. Perry Lam won. I thought Jose would win (He screwed because he didn't guess the keypad game's answer fast enough). But Perry's smart. Good good! After that, called Wendy to teach her Vectors. We chatted for a while. Then my mother called Uncle Steven! She asked him to buy A CD-Writer for me (of course we will pay him later,. We asked him to buy because he's a computer expert ma!)!! YaY!! Can finally burn CDs le! I am starting with my Charmed movies! YaY!! Uncle's coming after he brought the burner! Can't wait. And I am upgrading my memory card and my disk space after he come over to look at my computer's specs. Possibly the video card too, because I want to play Sims 2 when it comes out. I don't think I am changing to Windows XP. Very unstable, always getting virus here and there. After that, called Wendy and chatted. We went to sleep later.  Wednesday- E-Maths 2 was kinda easy too. I only lost about 15 marks. Not bad. I might get a B3 this time. Or if I am lucky, an A2. Meow!! History's next! And oh boy! Was it another easy paper! I was set on doing communism, but they asked to explain how "competition with USA" made Gorbachev come up with Perestoika and Glasnot. I didn't do because I am afraid I would get the explanation for given factor wrong. And that's not good. So I did the question on Germany instead. Quite easy la, that one. Source-based's fine too. On the easy side. I am confident of getting at least an A2 for Combined Humanities. Of course, I shouldn't set such high expectations. Later I get dissappointed how?   After that, we (me, CQ, XC, HuiMin, Amanda, SL, HL, Gloria, Janet and YC) went to Causeway Point to eat. Luckily I ate the chicken noodle thingy. This week would be the last week they are selling chicken noodle, because the popularity for this noodle is not good. Sigh!! Good food wasted. Then, we went home to study Bio. It took me all day (between an unexpected nap lasting for an hour) to finished Bio. I read the last chapter in-between commercials of Charmed (oh my!! Barbas is sooo evil!!). I also made Wendy angry that day. I was complaining about using other bottles, because Mom brought me one . I was saying that I am gonna be embrassed and all, because I believe using drink bottle is NOT harmful. And now, I am doing something which is against my will. I also said something about my annoyance with ultra-hygienic freaks and how they offended me. Somehow, Wendy got angry. And didn't talk to me for about 2-3 hours. I think she cooled down already, because she said "bye" to me. Oh well. I feel so guilty.   Thursday- Bio Paper 2! Oh my my! It was a moderately easy paper. Yeah. I am so proud of my first long essay question. I wrote so neatly and everything! I did the "OR" question, about artificial and natural selection. Quite an easy paper la. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat. I ate porridge, century egg and chicken porridge to be exact. Without ginger, onions, or spring onions to be even more exact. After that, I shopped for Angel present. CQ came online, and so did WQ. WQ tagged along, more like. Supposed to me and CQ one. Sigh. Cannot talk freely le. I took a big gamble and brought a CD I hoped my mortal don't have. After that, we went home to study for Physics.   I went to Wendy's house to study for Physics. HaHa! We cooked, no no, fried, luncheon meat. First time man! We had difficulty using the can opener, but I found out how to use it, after a long while of fitting the opener here and there. At first, we put int oo much oil and used the wrong pan. We settled for a wok and some oil. I must say, the luncheon meat was nice! :) After eating, we studied for Physics. After a while, I got very very tired. We decided to sleep for 30 minutes. I slept on her bed, while she slept on her mother's bed. After the short nap (went pass so soon! so tired leh!!), we continued studying Physics. We also talked quite a big. About the Angel-Mortal game. About what we are gonna do for celebration after Tuesday's paper. We are planning to eat at Swensen's. The Earthquake ice-cream! I finished at 5.50 something. At 6, I went home.   On the way home, Wendy called. She found out who's her angel is. It's....me! Opps! I made a slip-up by putting the CD in her bag after she checked. But that's not the problem. I brought her a CD she had already. Linkin Park's Meteora. I thought it was quite new you know. That goes to show my knowledge on music industry. Sigh! She was sad. I mean, her surprise's spoilt. I felt so guilty. Sigh! I should have asked for another 10 cent coin from Ji. I should have brought the Angel cards at New Age Circle instead. Sigh. We aare gonna exhange it for Hotel Paper today. I wonder if Popular allows that. She volunterred that she exchange, since I was afraid of embarrassment ("That idiot say it's embarrassing, which I dun have a clue what's so paiseh about"). I felt so guilty about letting my mortal do my dirty job. I said I would try doing it instead.   Today- Ah! Science Paper 1 is such a failure. I got so many wrong for Chem! I felt like I am such a big failure. Sigh!! Physics I was like going "oh die liao!". I mean, the short answers were quite okay la. Not very easy, but not that difficult either. The structured essays is such a killer! A lot I don't know! I finally had to make a choice of doing the 1st two questions. I have no clue about magnetic induction, so I didn't choose the last qns.   Just now, we went to exchange the CD. I freaked out at the last minute and let Wendy change for me. So si bai, KY. Spineless idiot. But luckily, she managed to exchange it for Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper, which I am listening to right now. So nice the CD! :D Thanks Wendy!   I think after this, I am playing FFIX. I am gonna get all the Chocobo's Treasures first, then levelling up to 99, before advancing the story. Yep! So, gotta get going now. See ya tomorrow blog!

      Heya ! It's a Sunday!   I woke up at 8.30, and guess what?! I bathed for more than 30 minutes! YaY! I finally reached my aim! I ate chee cheong fun for breakfast. After that, watched Digimon Frontier and many other cartoons. After that went online and chatted with XC and Wendy.   Lunch Mom cooked the Japanese Udon! Hmm! Long time no eat le! I oplayed FFIX while eating. I completed Mount Gulag and found my 2nd Chocograph Treasure. I am gonna play more later.   After lunch, I went to 768 to buy Seventeen for Wendy. Luckily, G Value has it, so I brought one for $3.90 (which she returned me later). Took 913 to her house.  We studied E-Maths there. I completed my revision for Maths! YaY!! I felt kinda confident. But only the results will tell everything! Let's hope tomorrow will be an easy paper! Then, I listened to Wendy's MDs. I sang End Of The Line. While singing that, I envisioned myself singing, and also WQ. Then, I realised that I was wrong. For all those things I did. It's good. I realized my own mistake! Hmmm. Wendy said "Finally!". HaHa! Oh yeah, I also didn't take the Primrose Eveing Oil. I am scared her brother will catch me swallowing the pill. HaHa!   Then Hann called and asked me SS questions. After that, we went outside to see her brother play Harvest Moon.  At 5.45, we went out to eat. Me and Wendy ate Chicken Chop rice and her mother Half Chicken Rice Set. It was delicious! Yum! I brought back BBQ Wings Rice for brother.  I reached home and took a bath. You know, or may not know, today's Mabon. Mabon is a Sabbath, a festival! This day is some sort like the witches' version of Thanksgiving. I joined in the celebration by arranging 10 of my votive candles into a TY shape, representing Thank You. As I lighted each candle, which signifies my sincere thanks and appreciation, I said my thanks to the God and the Goddess and my ancestors (I expeically mentioned my great-grandmother and godfather). I felt so special...as this is my first Sabbath celebration. :)  Then, I wrote this blog. Here. I think I am gonna stop now. Goodnight blog! See ya!

      Hey hey! Today's Saturday!  I woke up at 8.30 and bathed for 20 mins (too short too short! Must bath for 30 tomorrow!)! I went online while waiting for Mother to come back with breakfast. I chatted with Ben and surfed Neopets.  Mom came back at 9.45. I ate fried carrot cake. Spicy cpicy...but nice! After that, I watched cartoons till 11.30. Then, I came online. I chatted with Wendy and XC. Wendy introed me to the wonderful art of grabbing shcool supplies! You can spend hundred plus buying stuff and selling them for thousands! Woah! Can earn loads man! If not for the inflation. Yeah! Now prices of goods dropped very horredously! So terrible that I only earned 2k of profits! Oh well.   Later in the afternoon, I went to Wendy's house to study SS. We got a bit distracted by her brother playing Chocobo Racing, but we managed to finish revising at 5. At one point in time, I did something rather silly. You see ar. There was this box and bottle labelled "Evening Primrose Oil" on the table. I asked Wendy what it is about. She said it was for skincare. Then I read the box. It said something about helping women with their periods. HAHAHA! And I said "Okay...i go eat it". I treid cutting open the plastic capsule and poruing it into a cup of water. Oil flowed out. Eww! Then, I took another pill and broke it apart. This time I decided to drink it. And so I did. And it was horrible!!! I washed my mouth with water. Wendy kept laughing and laughing away. I actually drank oil meant for women! HaHaHa! Later, XC told me that men can take it too, and I am supposed to take it with the plastic. Oh good. Tomorrow I am taking one with the capsule intact! Muhahahaha!  Hmm...after that leh, something happened. The kids were outside playing and created a whole hell of a noise. Lassie started barking at them. One of them said "Shut up!" and another one said "Bark lor! I am not afraid of dogs!". Those insolent maniacs! How dare they insult Lassie?! Lassie have every right to bark! Wendy screamed at them. Wendy's brother let Lassie out to chase them and Wendy's mom glared at them through the window! Coolies! Everybody's defending Lassie! Good dog!  Upon reaching home, I bathed, ate and watched TV. Then I came online. Here I am, writing blog. I think I better go print out my August entries le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!

      Hey! Today's the start of Prelim exams! English papers too!  Before we start being examined, I recieved a present from an extra angel. It's a small cute little mini dog, accompanied by a note! The angel wished me luck in my exams. It also turned out that XiaoXi got the same thing too! Hmm! I guess the angel wants both of the presentless mortals to feel comforted! Such a nice angel! I placed the dog in my pencil box to accomapny me throughout the exam.  Of course, naturally, Paper 1 comes first. I did the Part 2 report first. It's about Principal asking me to write about the explosion happened that happened in the Chem lab. I wrote about CQ accidentally pouring the whole packet of potassium into a beaker of water, cuasing an explosion. I wrote Mrs Chew into the story too! Mrs Chew commented "So terrible the question! A lot of you wrote me into the story! Did you say that I fainted? (Well, we were suipposed to describe the teacher's expression!" HaHa! Mrs Chew is in the limelight! I was quite pleased with what I wrote. However, my compo took quite a long time to complete.....aI had only 2 minutes left you know! This is so unlike me! I wrote about a smoker friend of mine (his name's Benjamin by the way) breaking his promise to me about not gonna smoke again. I wrote a very long compo...4 full pages (almost) consisting of almost 860+ words. That's the longest I written! I hope I can score good marks!  After Paper 1, I recieved another Angel's present! This time is from my actual angel! He/she sent me 3 packets of chocolates! Coolies! They were very tasty! Thank you angel, whoever you are!   Paper 2, compre, is not so tough after all. Cheh! Mrs thong ar, she said she will give us a tough paper! Cheh! This paper is quite okay ma. I think I can pass. do well? Let's hope, okay?  After Paper 2, we went all around school looking for people. First, we looked for Miss Mala. HL wanted to hand in some worksheet. Miss Mala asked CQ and HL for their opinions on the compre. They said it was tough. Miss Mala then said "Told you all already. Watch more Discovery Channel! And you wnated to watch Zoe Tay!". She then turned her attention to us. She asked us if we were from Bnad 1. Gloria said she's not and pointed to me and Joyce. She then asked for our opinions on the paper. I said it was okay. She said, "Bands 1 and 2 have no excuse to find it tough!". I am horrified! She's indirectly insutling CQ and HL in their faces that they suck in compre! How can?!! Oh my! I really wonder why CQ and HL suffered this humilation in silence!   Anyway, then we ate lunch. After lunch, we went up to look for SL. We listened to Mrs Chew explaining some concepts. Quite informative. I then decided to buy a couple of TYS for O Levels. One is the Combined Science TYS, the other is for SS Sec 4's Longman guide. Yeah. After that, we accompanied SL to eat in the canteen.  Then, after eating, we went home. Met XC on the bus. He's gonna eat sushi later. Later, me, Gloria and Benjamin alrighted.First we went to Popular to see some assessment books and after that, we went home.  Reaching home, I went to bath. I went online, chatted with Wendy, brought a Pen from her and surfed the Net. At 4 something, I went offline to play FFIX. Alright. FFIX updates! I completed Desert Palace at last! Then, I went to Esto Gaza. Brought some new weapons and stuff. Then, went inside Mount Gulag. I saved before I defeat the boss. I had to go eat ma.   I just ate and watched Holland V (all about JingJing today! She's such a nice person!). Now I am online and typing blog. Oh yes! I also came up with a poem while bathing. No. It is not about bathing. If you read yesterday's entry, you know what I am talking about le. Presenting my poem!   Dual Denial  Stupid Idiot Useless Denial  Why i call it "Dual Denial"? Because tthis poem can be interpreted it in two ways. And I don't wanna explain to you now. Survivor's showing later and it is the season premiere! I am NOT gonna miss it for the world! If you want a explanation, ask me anytime. So, with this, i am ending this entry! Goodnight blog! See ya tomorrow!

      So, continuing from yesterday's blog. Siorry for the interruption ar. It's always like that on Wed.  Oh yes. The recital. Ah. It was fun and nice. Yes XC. It was very good! Stop asking already. I orignally went there under XC's invitation. The Music Students are reciting their pieces. XC is playing his Pathetique peice. The recital started at 2.45pm. Most of them did well. Well done! XC keep critisizing the person who played Sweet Bye And Bye, because the person was using his piece for his Mid-Year 2002. HaHa! Yes yes XC. She sounded not as good as you. We keep talking and talking. I think Mr Low, who was sitting at the back, was very annoyed at our constant talking. Finally, the 21st person to perform was XC! And I was his page-turner for the day. What I did was basically turn the page whenever the XC says "turn". I was quite nervous then. I was waiting patiently for XC to play the first part so I can turn the page. And that part is so slow!! The second part he moved very fast. YaY! I love that part most. And all the while, I have to doge XC's hand when he reaches for the right side of the piano. HaHa! We finally ended. XC did well. Yeah. Everybody's praising him. So no worries la hor, XC! Good luck for your practical tomorrow!  Okay. Coming back home, I bathed and ate dinner. During which, I called Wendy to talk. She was having some problems of her own. I just listened to her and gave some helpful advices here and there. Well, I believe in the end, Wendy will be alright from this mess! I believe in her. After which, I told her about my own problems. It seemed that I have been very bitchy towards WQ. Why? I think, I wanted him to block me back. I was so confused. He said he would only talk to me after Os. Now he unblocked me. What is he trying to do? Talk to me again? And if he is, he isn't doing that lor. I don't want to recieve mixed signals anymore la! Wendy said instead of me waiting for him to talk, why not talk first? I was like....dunnoe. Obviously, I still can't bring myself to be ready to talk. I am just not lor. And I also kinda figured out why he's been negative towards me. He came online yesterday. I was so plerpexed why didn't he block me. I kept asking myself why....why... I finally figured out. I think he's experiencing the same thing. We are using our bitchiness to hide our true feelings. What is his? I do not know. Mine? I am starting for forgive and forget, but I can't still accept me forgiving and forgetting, in a sense. So I used anger and bitchiness to cover it up. Sigh. Now I look like a desperate cat right? I am not lor. I am NOT desperate.  Denial.    HaHa! We talked till 8pm pkus. I recorded Holland V. And my tutition teacher forgot that there's tutition today. Ha! Soi I got one free Wed night. After watching Charmed (about gyspy and Phoebe's powers), I went to sleep.  Today, I got back my Chem practical test. I got 11/15! YaY!!! I was so happy! I thought I would get 8-10 or something like that. Mrs Chew told us most scored around 8-9 ma....I just misread the theory question and did not include one point for observation and one wrong conclusion. Also, a yue wang mark was minused from me. In M1 test, blue litmus remaining blue is correct. But that stupid Rekha...go put "blue litmus turns red" in answer sheet, and lost the mark. Mrs Chew said remaining blue is correct, because H2CO3 is too weak an acid. Sigh! But oh well. I got 11. I should be happy. Some of my friends are worse off. Good luck next time, people! Pick yourself up and try and try again! You can do it!  Then, today nothing much happened. Just that at the end of school, I felt really pissed off at Hann. He's becoming more and more dangerous each day. Look what he did to CQ and me. It's atrocious! I felt really annoyed lor. Whatever la! Whatever!  I came home at 3 something. Took a bath, ate some eggs and went to watched the recorded Holland V. After tha, I played FFIX. Instead of revising. What for revise? I don't go around memorising essays and then finding out the next day that none of my memorised essay fits any theme. Rather silly if you ask me. Mrs Thong gave us a guide on compre essay. I'll just look over that tomorrow. Alright Alright. FFIX updates. I completed the Oeilvert le! YaY! Now I am running around the Magical Palace finding bloodstones to take away. And it's very hard fighting enemies if you onkly had one phyiscal fighter (which is not really reliable) and 3 magic users who use up their MPs very fast! Oh my!! Will continue playing some other time. Yeah!  After playing, ate dinner and watched Holland V. Then, came online and printed lots of stuff. Like Wendy's blogs, poem from her angel (such a nice poem!) and my prelim timetable. Then wrote blog! Ahh!! I am tried from typing le. So see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey! Such a eventful day today!  Okay okay. Today's normal school day. Nothing really interesting happened. I mean, during the first 4 periods. Now, MT lessons is where the fun start yeah! At MT lesson, 3 people got their prezzies! They are namely CQ, Wendy and Clar. Hm. CQ got a picture frame with a photo inside. Wendy got a crystal ball inside a a beautifully decorated box. Clar got a bookmark. Clar finally got something! Ahh! And I don't! Jealous jealous KY! Anyway, you are wondering. Have I given my prezzie yet? ~Shrug~ I don't know. I like CQ's and Wendy's prezzies! So nice! And during recess, everybody was looking at me weirdly one leh! I think they suspect I am Wendy's angel (since Wendy also like that look at me)!! Oh my my!  Okay. due to the lack of time (Charmed's showing and I hate doing this to my blog every Wed), I gotta end le. I will fill in tomorrow about today's recital. It was very intereresting! Alrighty then! See ya! Byes! Goodnight!

      Oh my! Today's our Bio Prac! Oh my my!!  Today, we got the extra privelege of arriving at school at 9!! Because the 4/5 cats are in the second shift! Wee-hoo! So, I woke up at 7, intending to rush off at 8 to meet with CQ. Ayioh! I cannot eat things properly now you know! My left gum surrounding the wisdom tooth (imagine yourself!) is swoolen. And I feel pain anything touches the gum! Ouch! Hurts!  Okay, managed to rush to Woodlands in time. I brought a pack of battery for my discman! And I was so shocked you know! So many people were late for school (the non 4/5ers of course). Oh my!! But I felt shuang when walking into school with them. I have a valid reason to be "late", they don't. Ha!! Anyway, met CQ and WQ. I listened to my Discman on the bus, but gave up after so many idiotic crackling sounds. We reached school at 8.45+.  We sat on the same table as Wendy and SuPing. All of us began to talk. Just relax. I didn't study Bio lor. Don't feel like studying last minute. We just talk and talk and talk. Then Mrs Chew came and marked attendance. And it turned out that Gao Luan and Shawn cheated!! GL looked at Shawn's paper. This is like so desperate. Cheating is BAD (okay, we often joked about cheating during prac, but we would never do it one lor!). At 9.50+, Mrs Chew called for us to assemble and go to Bio Lab! The moment!!  We assembled outside. It turns out that Mrs Jalil would be our invigilator. That's cool. But she's kinda strict. No talking and everything. When I went in, I started searching for Bunsen burner. Mrs Chua said she will put me in the teacher's bench if there's heating. Otherwise, I would end up in the side bench. I saw no Bunsen burner! Then I looked at the 2 side benches. Nothing on them!! I then saw that the teacher's bench got equipments set up for me! YaY! Woah! Sit up there feel so special. But hor, Faiz's facing moi. And I was like "Ayiah! Want to copy also cannot!" I looked at everybody, who seemed to be all looking at me.   soon, the experiments started. The first one seemed so complicated! It's about Vitamin C decolourising some inicator. We are supposed to find out how many drops of Vitamin C in diferent concentrations take to decolourise indicator and draw graph and the likes. I tell ya, it's kinda hard diluting solutions to half. But I solved everything by logic... and a bit of borrowing of measuring cylinder from the other side of the bench (sitting at teacher's bench have lots of advantage. Can take things whenever you like! Ha!!). Woah!! I don't feel consident about first experiment. However!! Second experiment is a life-saver for me! Mainly because I knew where to cut. I was wondering whether to cut fruit T.S. or L.S. I read the questions at the back, and then knew that cutting T.S. is the right one. And then staining cut surface with iodine and drawing it. Worth 9 marks! If I cut L.S., my 9 marks would be gone! Luckily! And I answered pretty well on that experiment, so I felt good. I even had 10-15 minutes left. SL said that watching me sit there and stare blankly into space is horrifying. Because at the last 10 minutes, when I was staring into blank space feeling bored, everyone was frantically starting on the 2nd experiment. Cutting seeds and everything. I washed everything out of boredom (Mrs Chua stopped me from washing test tubes in the end...hahaha!).   At the end, everyone was so worried because they lost 9 marks for cutting L.S. Ah. But I am sure they will pass! Jia you! In History lesson, me, CQ and Jason can't stop talking about Bio Prac. HaHa! During Maths, I wrote some poems out of boredom. I will be sharing one with you later on. Assembly's boring. Doesn't concern us. So I talked to XC.  We had SS extra lesson after assembly. Which is basically the same thing she went through with us during History lesson. After that, the choir members went to choir to get our graduating presents! So exciting!! We were given our own personalized scrapebook and tuners! The tuners were presented to us like we were given a medal to wear around the neck! So cool! The tuner is in A note. ~bangs tuner and hums~. The scrapbooks were very personalized! So many people wrote so many things! I was so happy with what they wrote! Thanks guys and gals. Oh yeah, speaking of gals. Me and CQ became "her". HaHa! In our graduation cert, it was written for both of us as "This is to certify that Kelvin Yip/Low Chin Quan has participated successfully in the school choir (2000-2003) and has shown determination and passion in HER work."!! I think they too lazy to make the extra changes for the two boys in this batch! HAHA!! So funny now if you come to think about it! We enjoyed our presents very much!  After that, we met XC and Ben (who left soon after) outisde the AVA room and went to eat. Ayioh! All of them teasing about me and XC as a "couple"! HaHaHa! Crazy cats yi ge liang ge! After that, me and XC went to Causeway Popular to buy stationary. Then, we discussed Bio on the walk out.   Came back home, called Wendy and talked a bit. Then, went to bath and watch a bit of Chun Dao Ren Jian. then, played FFIX. I levelled up a bit using Epitah (7k-9k experience and lotssa money too!). After that, watched Holland V, First Touch and Brainiest Kids. Then, came online! Ta-da!  Okay. My poem before I leave.   Isomaniac   Eyes tired, Heavily closing. Stomach growling, Awake.   Here it is! I hope you enjoyed my poem! See ya tomorrow. Or maybe not (due to Charmed and all). Goodnight blog!

      Meow! Today's Combined Science Prac!  Oh my! Let's start with the beginning of the day. I was feeling pretty nervous and everything. I forgot about my protractor and my CD-R, so had to spend money at the bookshop. After that, we, the very nervous bunch, went down to assembly. Oh my!! After assembly, Mrs Chua segregated us off to our respective labs (Bio Lab 2 for me!). The invigilator is Mrs Ong Lay Hoon for me.   Oh my! I dare say, the practical is quite easy. Easier than expected! The Chem one only test for gases (which I was wrong for M2 because I can't test the presence of ammonia. Darn!!). For Physics, the circuit (yes, electricity) has been set up for us, and we are supposed to find voltage and current of the lamp then plot graph. And I drew a best straight line, which turned out to be wrong! Hey! I can't even plot a curve with the points I have! Anyway, I expected much worse. Chem can be accounted for, because Rekha (oh oh! she keep looking at me you know. Why ar? HeHe! Because I was looking around ma. Finished both experiments liao, so bored.) is very protective of her Sec 5s. I expected something like the exercises in the Chem Prac workbook. For Physics, dunnoe why so easy leh. Miss Tan even said that most of the time we have to set up circuit ourselves! Or the exam is not set by Miss Tan! Hmmm! Very strange!   Okay, after the test, we went up to class and be quarantined. Oh meow! We have like 3 hours to spend there. Teachers keep coming in to invigilate us. I didn't study bio that much. Maybe study during dinner or something. I chatted with CQ and YH. YH drew blue eyeshadow on my eyelids. Oh my!! Then, all of them contributed to drawing me. The face, drawn by Ah Ji, not bad la! But hor!! WQ draw a very fat body and labelled it as "KY 10 years later". I think that was really uncalled for. And moreever, he put on the t-shirt "I Love Miss W" (I said in annoyance, "Might as well put XC there". Now they are convinced that I like XC. HaHa!). At first, I really wanted to tear up the drawing. But I thought: If I did that, then I would be "entertaining" them (maybe 'them' is bit too harsh. 'Him', more likely) by breaking down in anger (I learnt it from harry Potter! Such an educational book). And I certainly don't want to be doing that. So, I controlled myself and just raised an eyebrow at everything. I am so darn proud of myself now! Wendy said that I finally managed to control my anger. YaY!!   After that, we stayed back to eat. Hmmm.....the people today were talking about how wrong it is to take food from people's plate, even if the owner have given you permission and don't mind. Frnakly speaking, I think it's crap. Come on lor. People gave you permission le. Sometimes, they don't even want to eat. Instead of wasting, might as well give me and let it serve its purpose by being eaten. When people give you permission, I don't think it's rude lor. I know Hann and Manda don't mind all these one. They just take food directly. I can understand ma. I grew up doing that! HaHa!! Meow! Even taking other's food is fun!  Okay. I brought my prezzie for my mortal cat today. Wendy and I was supposed to buy ours today. She didn't, because of various undisclosed reasons. I am gonna doll my prezzie up nicely and give it to my mortal. When? Not telling. :P You know, SL told Wendy that thjis game is kinda pointless. Because it's mainly concentrates on giving presents, but not motivating them. Hmm. I don't know lor. Wendy hopes her presents are motivating, and I hope mine are too. I did make the effort to motivate my mortal cat. I hope the cat is motivated!! Espeically during this time of the year! I am not motivated. Why? My angel didn't give me anything and neither did Clar's, Ping's and XiaoXi's. Well, I think they are too busy, or don't know us well enough to give what we like. But at least something in the fourth week is good enough liao la. Even a note suffices. And I got this stinking feeling who my Angel is. Let's see if my feelings are right in the end of this round.  Alright! I shall be ending about now. Dad's gonna holler any moment to tell us to come eat dinner. See ya tomorrow blog! Best of luck to me in my Bio Prac. See ya!

      Hey hey! It's Sunday! Oh yeah! I am gonna burn my CDs! I am gonna burn my CDs! Burn!!  I woke up at 8.20 and bathed for about 25 minutes (wahahaha!). After that, I watched cartoons while eating breakfast (chee cheong fun and the grass jelly drink). After watching shows, I went online.  I chatted with XC cat and Wendy. XC recommends us a burning software to burn our music on. Thanks XC! Then, at 12, lunch arrived (dried spicy instant noodles with fishball and cuttlefish! mmmm!). Then, Wendy's brother said I have to help him buy lunch in exchange for the burning of my CDs (well, he  borrowed  it from the office after all). Alright, I agreed lor.   I left home at 1.40. And oh my! The sky sure was dark! Thunder was rumbling ever-so-frequently, the sky threatening to pour it's heavy load of water on the poor mortal souls down below! I quickly boarded the 913 bus to Wendy's house. Upon alighting, drizzles of rain started to drop down. Ahh! The sky has finally let out! I thought of a poem while walking to Wendy's house, which I will write at the end of this entry.  Finally reached her house. Wendy was burning CDs for herself when I went in. Then, Arman called. Wendy and Arman talked for some minutes. After that, both of us went off to buy lunch (and hopefully a new CD for me).   What cruel fate has befell upon us! It was raining, and there's no form of shelter whatsoever! We have to dash here and there, getting out of the rain as soon as possible. We finally arrived at 888. I brought the lunch for her brother and her (he insisted that I buy), while Wendy checked out the CD-R. Well, it turned out that I need another 50 cents to buy the CD, and Wendy brother gave us 50cents less. Sigh!! After buying lunch, we dashed back to her house.  There, we started burning. I made the CD covers for both of us using MeiYing's as a guide. While waiting for the CDs to burn, we read magazines (Teenage) and played Chocobo Racing. Finally, at 6pm, 89 songs were burnt into 5 discs! Finally! I missed some songs (like Britney's My Only Wish This Year), but oh well. After watching Wendy complete Storybook Mode, we went down to eat.   Wendy and I ate chicken rice while her mom ate fried kueh teow. I brought back fishball noodles for my brother. While crossing the road, Wendy's mom said that my brother, being Sec 2, is too lazy to buy his own food and bullies me. Younger brother bullying elder brother! HaHa! My brother had a violent reaction to her words. Oh my!!  After coming back, I took a bathed, studied Chem and Physics for a while and came online. There! Oh yes yes. The poem!    Rain   Drops of rain, Slowly intensify. Anger of the sky, Erupted.  Isn't this a good poem? I used short sentences (singular words even) to emphasize the rain-fall into somethhing more than just mere water dropping from the sky. I am quite proud of this work! I am gonna save it later! I already have a collection of haikus. Now I am having collection of short poems too. I just love poems!  Alright! That's the end! Wish me luck in the Practical tomorrow! See ya tomorrow, blog! Goodnight!

      Okay testing testing one two three. YaY! Can made this into a draft, which means that if I closed the window accidentally, this whole post can be saved. And I can change the date of posting. Oh...cool features!   Ahh...yes. Coming to today's events. I woke up at 8.30 in the morning and took a bath. After the 20-minute bath (oh! improvement....or not?), I went online while waiting for Mom to buy breakfast (fried carrot cake. I ate that 2 days in a row!). While online, someone went online. Why I want to tell you leh? Everyone comes online. But ehh....this person is KWQ, who had blocked and deleted me from his contact list. Why did he add me back on again? Now I am utterly confused. Does he want to talk or what? Why, oh why, did he add me back? I was doing fine you know....until he came online and threw me into utter confusion. I don't know whether this is good, or bad. There are some good (obviously.....), but there are some bad too. Er. I am "one confused cat".  Okay, after breakfast, I watched cartoons. So many cartoons on Saturday! After cartoon-watching I went to cut my hair. Oh! I was so hoping for a nice barber. Nice defines into "not rough, not crude and not insulting". I have enough of barbers saying something about my height! The boss ar, recongized my mother and me! BUT! BUT! He thinks I am the youngest and asked where "my older brother" is! And Mom didn't straighten that misbelief! The barber I had was okay, but he was very meticulous. Very zi xi...go through every detail. And the way he uses the cutting thingy, like so scared like that. I think he's a newbie la. But it was boring watching him being so careful. HaHa!   After that, I came home, washed my hair twice (it's been a habit to shampoo my hair twice after a haircut....yeah!) and ate lunch. After eating lunch, I went for Wendy's house to study for Sci Prac and tuiton her. But first, we are meeting in Popular to buy our CD-R to burn songs.   I went out at 1.30 and took 913 to Admiralty Station. Met Wendy in Popular where we brought the 10 CDs. My mother lent me her Popular card to use, so we got 10% discount ($1). We used that $1 to buy two ice-cream cones from Macdonalds. We then walked back to Wendy's house.   We completed our studies for Science practicals. Well, actually, I did. Wendy seems quite unsure of her work, so I am teaching her tomorrow. After that, we are burning our CDs. YaY! Can finally have more CDs to listen to, instead of listening to Jay all the time. No no...not saying that Jay is lousy...but it does get boring after a while. Okay, after studying, we spent time reading books. She read her Condor Heroes book while I read the Teen Witch book. Then, we went out to watch her eldest brother play FFIX. He tuaght me a few tricks....ahh! Must remember ar!  We went down to buy food and drinks back for her brother. She wanted to get the Sour Cream and Onion Pringles, but I don't want. She insisted, and I let her buy. Hey! It's her brother's money after all! We then brought Roller-Coasters, some chips and Vanilla Coke.   Back there, I ate the Pringles. Can you believe it? I tred into "forbidden" terriotry! It's not so bad after all! I almost ate half of the chips there! I watched her brother level up his characters (he's trying so hard to find the turtle monsters to level up - we call it "wu gui wang ba"! HAHA!). Wendy called WanXin because WX smsed her. No no...cannot disclose what they are talking about. Privacy rights being invoked here! But I do realised that Wendy really makes a good psychologist! So expert in this kind of stuff...giving advice ar and all that. Woah! Her advices were practical and straightforward, and it is the best policy for everyone. Right Wendy? HaHa!  After her call, Wendy wanted to Chocobo Race with me! HaHa! You can say that this master lost every race to his student! She used the Bahamut wor! So expert sia! White Mage is naturally slow against Bahamut, but hey! At least I come in 2nd/3rd! Once, i used Bahamut, but I still lost! Sigh! But never mind lor! See the student I taught! So good at her games! This means that the teacher is REALLY SOMETHING to begin with! A-ha! Good teacher naturally produces good students ma! HaHaHa! So, no losses for me la! I am proud of my student ar!   Okay, after that came back, bathed and ate dinner while watching Simpsons. Then, came online and gave Wendy my mp3s that I wanted to burn tomorrow. Wendy recieved her present from her angel also ar! Her angel really creative, creating another email add to send her a poem. That's cool! She thought it was me, becuase the poem sound like me. HaHa! I find that hor, everytime she reads a poem. she thinks it's my work. I think she read too much of my work! HaHa! She says she's decorating the poem and printing it out (okay, I print for her).   Okay, I think i am ending this le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!

      Oh look! Two days I haven't blogged and there're new features. Oh yes, you must be wondering why I haven't blogged for two days. No no. I am not sick. I actually wrote a blog one lor, on Wednesday night. But, I accidentally closed the window. Morever, Charmed's about to start. Actually, it was't much of a lost that time la. I wrote in point form...hahaha. Yesterday leh, went out to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival with friends. More details later.  Okay, starting with Wednesday. I forgotten most of the stuff le. We had Bio and Physics, with Physics lasting till 4-something-pm that day. I made an important descision during Physics, that is to join Shuet Ling's group in celebrating the Zhong Qiu. Why? You thought I originally joined Wendy's right? Well, there are some other people joining Wendy's group which I am not familiar/comfortable with. And I bet the shy me is not gonna have fun and be KY that night. Whereas for SL's group, I know everybody there, so I can enjoy myself. So therefore, I am joining them. I told Wendy, she doens't seem to mind. I am so afraid of making her dissappointed or something. Well, I kinda promised, and it is bad to break promises. Hmm. Miss Tan was very upset that day, because the soccer boys came in late for her class playing soccer. I noticed Miss Tan was almost close to tears. And yet Eugene and Yean Seng was scolding her for naggging. I pity Miss Tan actually. Yeah. so, I tried to do the experiments seriously. Yeah. And Charmed was nice that day. It's always nice! It was so funny when the demon realises he's gonna be blown by up by Piper. "NO!!" Piper thrusts her hands and "AHH!!". HAHA!   Moving on to Thursday! It's Mid-Autumn Festival, otherwise known as Lantern Festival, or also known as Zhong Qiu Jie. It's when the Chinese celebrate the full moon with mooncakes, lanterns and candles. Well, actually, it's more on the candles part lor. This is the time when we can play candles until shuang! HaHa! We (meaning I, XC, CQ, Joyce, PeiYing, SL, Gloria and HL) planned to go Woodlands Town Garden to celebrate. Yep.  That day, there's only 2-hours of Bio. The practial is damn easy man! I managed to get 34/40 (We self-marked)! It's such a confidence booster! After Bio, me, CQ and SL went to 4/5 class to wait for XC they all. SL beat my Snake high score by achieving a 700+. Oh my!! They came out at 1.30 (XC disappeared for a while!! He went to the toilet with Benjamin!!!). After all that hoo-haa, we went to Causeway Point to eat and buy things.  At Causeway Point, we went to eat at KFC. Ayioh! I should have gone up to eat at the foodcourt you know!! Ayioh! We, a big group of us, were standing near a table to wait for the occupants to finish eating. Then, a cleaning auntie came along. She scolded us for blocking her way while she's sweeping. Whatever. Then, the occupants left. We rushed to grab the seats. Then, the auntie came and nagged and nagged at us for blocking her way and all that crap. We were like staring at each other, rolling our eyes and staring at her. Actually, she was talking in some dialect which I don't understand. I keep asking CQ what she said (and loud too). We pused some tables to join as a group...but leh, she go and push back. And keep on nagging. Okay...I got really flared up. I don't care lor. I pushed the table back. CQ stopped me and said "don't". I was very the bu shuang! I tried to push there, CQ stopped me again. She then come and nag and said something about students should not be making her life hard, she earns so little. I was like very the qi! There're no rules saying we cannot push the tables, so why can't we? I can't stand people nagging at me, at how poor my behavior is, and in some dialect which I don't understand. Total insult to me! Everybody also feels very annoyed. This, is a sure-fire method to get rid of potential customers. Ergh!  After that, we shopped around Causeway Point for water-bottles (so idiotic! listen to stupid news....kiasi!) and ham. There, at Cold Storage, I blurted out that SHE is useless (because Gloria said...there! SHE poster!, then I blurted out). Ayioh!!!! CQ was so mad at me you know! He said, "Don't talk to you for one week". What!!! Ayioh...for goodness sake! And I was quite saddened by the fact that he placed SHE on top of our friendship. Gloria told me that I should not think that everybody follow my mindset. Maybe I was wrong by insulting SHE in his face, but I say, CQ can also learn a thing or two from Gloria. Not everybody likes SHE lor and can voice their opinions one lor, and CQ have to respect that.   After the shopping, we went back to our respective homes. I am bringing XC back home. Me, XC and Gloria decided to meet at 5.15, then meeting HuiLing at 5.30. XC and I went back home. He played my computer while I bathed and made instant noodles for both of us. HaHa! That XC ar! Put all three full packets of chilli oil, chilli powder and black soy sauce. He was so hot that he gave up halfway. I forced him to finish the plate, because I hate cleaning after a dirty plate. After that, I offered him drinks. Then, we went to Gloria's flat.  Woah! By the time Gloria came down, it was pouring heavily! Me and XC shared an unbrella, but that XC ar! The wind was blowing to the West, but he held the unbrella up high. And because I was on his right side, I got the full blast of the rain! My right side of the clothes were drenched heavily! XC!!!! We went to Admiralty to meet HL and her two sisters. We then called SL. The venue was changed to SL's block's void deck. Okay with me. Joyce and PeiYing did not want to come, because it was too troublesome for them. We then travelled to Woodlands Station via MRT and took 903 to SL's house.  We met SL down her block and we waited for CQ to arrive. HL and XC started on their Physics homework while SL and Gloria went to Sheng Shiong to buy drinks, foods, candles and lanterns. I played with some candles. Then, CQ arrived. After waiting for SL for so long, we decided to go up her house to watch Holland V. Actually, HuiLing wanted to watch the part when JingJing awakes. We went up, and watched DaHua boasting about his abilities to lead. Oh please! Then, we saw the BMI commercial and decided to calculate our BMI. I was 21, CQ 25 and XC 18!! Oh my! What's more surprising is that WQ is 15! So low! Then, we found out from SL's parents that the JingJing parted has shown (we missed the ending by a mere second!). So, it means like watching the show equals to not watching the show. SL then called us down to play.  We played with candles (melted a whole lot) and firecrackers. HaHa! We set up lanterns around the bushes outside. Then, we decided to play The number game. I don't know how to explain. Just ask me in person la. I lost about 3 times. And become the person who makes out the number. I decided to use 77 (rep 7th July...me birthday!). Everybody spotted that, and tried as hard as they could not to guess the number. Second time round, I used 43, instead of 42 (my class register). Then, third time, I used 77 again! And SL managed to trick HL's sister to say 78, so HL zhonged. HaHa! We then played another game, something about police and thieves. Me and Gloria became the police....and woah! That XC very crafty! Tried to burn me ar, XC!!! So hard to catch, he is!   After playing that, we decided to clean up and go home. It was hard cleaning up. I cleared out the food and drinks, while they tried to scrape off the wax. Woah! Clean clean scarpe scrape for dunnoe how many minutes till 9.50, when all of us started going back home. Ahh...SL just go up the lift can already ar! XC go take bus to Checkpoint, CQ rushed off to meet his mother, while the rest of us take 903 back to Woodlands Interchange. Reaching the interchange, HL and her sisters take the train back home, while me and Gloria took 913 back. I reached home at around 10.20.   Today leh....I met CQ at Woodlands Interchange. He didn't talk to me. I stood besides Chun while waiting for 962 and said chirpily "YiChun zhao!". I busied myself with Streats, Discman (playing Ye Hui Mei) and Charmed book, so didn't talk also like never mind to me one. After that, while walking up to Bio Lab, I was walking in front of CQ and WQ. WQ was asking CQ something about me. CQ then called for me. I stopped. He caught up to me and said "Hello", smiled and waved. Oh good. He stopped his silly game. I asked why he want to talk to me, he said "See you so pitiful". Oh well.   Today's A-Maths and Bio went quite well. HaHa! But I must say something leh. That WQ...say don't want to talk to me....really don't want to talk leh! Not even for basic nescessities. Today, he tapped my shoulders during Maths class, pointed at some worksheets and pointed towards XiaoXi's row. He repeated that. I was so confused. I took one whole stack and gave it to Hann. He then said panickingly, "My worksheets! My worksheets!". Ha! Don't wanna talk some more lor! Then, at Causeway Point, me and CQ were talking about Practical. He was like interupting, giving CQ sweets. I raised my voice louder and louder "study practical...StudY practical...STUDY PRACTICAL!". Then, CQ said Ayiah...give KY la!". In order for me not to hear his excuses for not giving me, I said shrilled, "WO CAI BU YAO!" CQ then laughed and laughed! Ha!  Okay6....I goota go eat chilli crab le! See ya tomorrow, blog! Bye bye!

      Hey! Today is a free day for us 4/5ers! Woo-hoo! Today, so many things happened. Today, basically I went to Wendy's house to play PS. Actually, CQ asked me out to the library to study today. But as Wendy's tutor, I asked Wendy if she needed me for tuition. She said no. But I go library also do nothing one. Wendy said "might as well come over play PS". So I took her word for it. HaHa!   Okies, I woke up at 8.30 (I think...I never looked at the clock like I usually did). I bathed and went online to wait for my mom to get breakfast (chee cheong fun....the store didn't open, so I ate roti prata instead). After that, Mom came back and I ate breakfast.  After breakfast, I went on to rename all my mp3s. The Artist/Title is so inapporpriately named sometimes! Ergh! It took me about 1.5hours of hard work and opening of every single file to name all my mp3s! YaY! I am so proud of myself! Meo-ow! After that, I went to eat lunch (instant noodles).  In the middle of eating lunch, Wendy smsed. She had no money to buy a new keyboard and speakers. Her keyboard spoilt. Okay, not really. The space bar won't work. So, whatevershetypesturnsoutlikethis (okay.not.really.she.found.a.way.to.space). The speakers are spoiling. Yeah. I offered to pay her back what I owed her ($6.75...rounding up to $6.80). I am going over, so I can pay ma. I arranged to meet at Admiralty, so she can go change her foreign money (US notes) to get some money to buy her stuff.   On the way, I realized that I didn't do the Physics June Paper! I was aghast! I was shocked! I can't believed I forgot! I called my friends to check. Ah Ji and Wendy confirmed got, but they are not doing. Oh my!! I am so dead!  We met at Admiralty, but our efforts proved furtile. The person refused to change US$1 notes, so Wendy have to go back to her $20 note. However, we brought Wendy's keyboard (some girls were complaining, because we snatched the last one of its kind, i.e., the cheapest one. HaHaHa!) at Popular. We walked back to her house. She installed the keyboard and it worked. She's going to Admiralty to exchange her notes and buy speakers. I am gonna be left alone at her house to do my Physics homework (which I lent her to copy later, since I copied her MCQs). Well, I managed to complete majority of the questions by the time she came back with speakers, notebook, foolscap and forgot what else.  After that, I played my FFIX game. Oh yeah. I reached Oeilvert...but after a tiresome walk. The monsters there are so powerful, and I am like, so 25-ish+ levels. Oh my! I hate Armstrong, and also the Cactuars, even though they give plenty of experience and money. At Oeilvert, i spent all my money on weapons!!! Oh my! I am such a qiong guang dan! I saved the game, and then played Chocobo Racing.  Wendy and I first practised racing. HaHaHa! She was quite pathetic. Ayiah, it's okay to be pathetic for your first game. She don't know how to use the "X" for braking, and don't even know she have stones to throw (and abilities to activate too). She was too concentrated on racing! HaHa! The real strat for this game is to use the apporpirate ability, character. You also have to pay close attention to the stones you recieved and use them wisely with any given opportunity (and also match them with your ability). And of course, pay attention to the race course and how to manovere around it. So many things to do. It trains your multi-tasking skills. Ha! No wonder Wendy can't get the hang of it. But she is slowly getting it. We played Grand Prix twice. I got 4th on the 1st race (big drop in skills wor!), but I got a perfect score of 36 in the second race (YaY!). Wendy improved from 5th to 4th. That's an improvement. Then, she played Story Mode. She got stuck in the Black Manor, racing against Black Mage. Oh my! Even I couldn't win either! So many twists and turns! Cannot blame me ma! I left at 6, leaving Wendy to play the Story Mode. Ha! She's real determined to win Black Manor! Pei fu, pei fu!  Okay, reached home, ate, watched TV (Holland V, First Touch and Brainest Kid) and came online. I gotta end le this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog!

      Heya! Today, so many things happened! Ahh! Let me begin from the start!  Okies...i woke up at 8 and went to bathed. Then, at 8.30, I called Wendy to wake her up. I called once, and nobody picked up. Fine. People are usually too sleepy to pick up phones. So, I decided to call 2 phones instead (house and her handphone). Ha! It took me about like 5 minutes of calling two phones to wake her up. And, she's already woken up lor, by my SMS I sent earlier. She's just too lazy to pick up the phone. I was like "Woah! I can't believe you can tolerate two phones ringing for 5 minutes!". Super man!  After that, went to 883 to eat breakfast with Mom (I ate laksa, she ate mee siam). Then, upon coming back, I decided to play FFIX for awhile. Oh yes! I long time never do FFIX Updates hor!!! I basically went to the Black Mage Village, then procedded on to the Desert Palace. I have to select Freya, Steiner and Armarant to go to Oleivert with me, a non-magical place. Sigh! There goes my black magic and white magic characters! Darn! Then, the next door neighbour came and talked to me about O Levels and the importance of choosing the correct path. I appreciate her opnions and I know she meant well, but she made me almost late for meeting with manda. I ended the convo, then get dressed hurriedly and went off.  I met Amanda there. She had brought some milk, butter and chocolate flakes. We then waited for Andi and went down to meet him. The three of us went to Chun's house together.   We met Wendy and Chun downstairs, and we went up. We were soon joined by MeiYing. We started fixing the puzzle! Oh my! I originally decided to fix Piglet, but don't know how to due to the little number of Piglet pieces. I decided to fix Christopher's head instead. After doing that, I went to fix some minor pieces here and there. We finally completed after an hour! Woah! 3 hours ahead of what we originally planned! We wrote our messages to Arman on the back of the board. HaHa! I hopes he likes it! Then, we ate some yam cake there (oh good! got mushroom inside! nice!) and listened to some songs (Disney and BackStreet Boys).   After that, we went to Arman's house. Me and manda detoured back to Chun's house to collect our ingredients! e left it behind...hahaha! At Arman's house, we just relaxed there lor. We played with his cat, rid on his exersing bike machine (for 5 mins maintaing a constant rate of 70 rates per minute), and gossipped. We gossipped about butts. HaHaHa! Just because I noticed butts and compared them doesn't mean I have a fetish hor! Ha! Well, we discussed CQ's and WQ's butt. Ha!!! And Amanda and I pretended to discuss Wendy's butt and lead her to misbelieve that we gossipped about her butt. HAHA! Wendy, if you are reading this, :P!  Then, leh, we left and went to Woodlands MRT to wait for our friends so we can go to Yvonne's house. We waited for Ah Ji, WQ and Clar. When Ah Ji saw Andi, his expression changed lor. I knew it from the start (I got this feeling when we are taking the bus to Woodlands Interchange lor....as his friend, I know these things!) that Ah Ji would become like that lor. But I don't blame him. He hasn't seen Andi without Faiz yet. Andi is basically very nice and funny. Yeah! And I think Ah Ji realized that as time goes by. I saw him chuckling at Andi's jokes quite a number of times. That's good. Yeah!  Once everyone got together, we proceeded to Yvonne's house. I talked to Ah Ji about what I told you yesterday. Yeah. He said in the end "You are crazy". I don't know what he meant by that comment lor. Perhaps he meant what I am doing about this situation. I must go ask him next time.   We assembled all ingredients to make the cake. And they found out that they don't have enough flour. So, they decided to play open number to send an unlucky soul down to 888 to buy flour. And it was me. If I had known, I should have shown a 3 (and made Amanda buy) or a 1 (and saboed CQ). I made the trehcerous walk (okay...not really that long la, but under the sun leh! and i sweat easily!) to and fro 888. I brought a packet of plain flour costing $1.40. I finally made it back. Later leh, I found out that they found out they have enough flour. but it was too late, they sent me out le (ever heard of calling? i can always walk back). But in order not to waste my efforts, they used the flour I brought instead. Thanks guys! HaHa! We freased and floured the pan and poured the cake mix (I missed the exciting part!) into the pan. We put the pan into the pre-heated oven and waited for 45 minutes. We played Murderer there. HaHa! I keep being the vicitm! I been the police once (and i sucked at it! I got all my suspects wrong!) and a murderer once too (I only managed to kill XiaoXi! I tried to kill Manda, but she was the police! HAHA!). The cake was finally done! It was cute, in a way. We decorated it with whipped cream and flakes. We then decided to send it over to SuPing personally.   First, we went to 888 to buy a box to contain the cake. Then, we walked to the bus-stop to take the bus there. We took 913 and walked a bit (We were shown an "attraction", Faiz's house. Bastard.) to get to her house. We rang her doorbell and there she comes! We sang SuPing the birthday song first, then showed her the cake. She was very happy and invited us in to eat. We finally got to taste our own creation! I gotta admit, it was nice! Our first time baking a cake, and it turned out nice! Wee! SuPing was elated and kept thanking us! Then, I rushed down to meet my family at 768 to eat.  After eating, we came back home and watched Holland V and Comedy Nite. Then came online. SuPing thanked me again, I chatted with Wendy, XC and Shin Han! And then I wrote this blog! Such an eventful day! Oh well. Gotta go liao. See ya tomorrow!

      You know what? WQ says he wants nothing to do with me lor. He don't want to talk to me, neither does he want me to talk to him. He says it's better not talking lor. Looks like CQ is right. And Ah Ji is always right. But the good thing is, he's not angry lor. And he said he will try to talk to me after the Os. When we are not seeing each other frequently, and not as close. I don't have to talk to him lor. He will. Me? What I feel? Well, I respect his decision lor. I won't try to talk to him, neither will I open any opportunity to him lor, I mean, before he's ready. Since he makes this firm decision, and I can't do anything about it, I might as well respect this. And I felt so dejected, rejected. One side is like wanting to talk, the other is not wanting to talk. This is like so opposite. So contrasting. So different. I feel sad lor. I am now feeling like crying, but something tells me not to. It's not worth it. Why cry, when something good awaits me at the end of the year? But right now, I don't want to get my hopes up high le. Just lie low. And wait. Yeah. Now, I don't know how to face him tomorrow. I think it would be awkward. I think I need Wendy's and CQ's support. I really do.

      Heya! I just came back from bathng. Meow!!  Okay, I went to Wendy's house, as you all know. Firstly, I read the NT. I found out I have to buy a pen and a notebook for Grammar class! Oh my! I spent about 20k buying a Faerie Pen and Faerie Notebook. Then, I tutored her A-Maths. We went throught Sets and Functions, and I gave her homework (5 questions on each topic). I am quite hesistant about giving her homework, because I never do the homework my tuition teacher gave me. She insisted that I give her some questions, so oh well.   After the tuition, we went online. Now, we met WQ there (his nick is: "Shout. Scream. Do what you want!" Oh! We inferred what that meant....). Now, I pretened to be Wendy and talked to him (oh my! i broke my own rules...but never mind. I am talking as "Wendy"). I wonder if he knew the difference. Probably he forgot how KY talks like le....so long never chatted with me le. And he sent Wendy an email, the one which I tried so hard to fill for Ben. Just for fun, I wrote a lot of sarcarstic answers in the boxes (oh my! I am becoming more and more sarcarstic these days!). Then, I seriously considered sending to him. But Wendy made me send to myself instead. Ha! Meow!  After that, watched some funny cartoons. My Little Ponies and Rainbow Brite. So cute! Then, we went to 888 to eat dinner. Wendy's mom ate mixed rice, Wendy ate chicken chop rice and I ate fried carrot cake plus sotong. I brought BBQ Chicken Wings Rice for brother. Yeah.  Oh my! I have diarrhea! I think it is the lontong I ate this morning for breakfast. So idiotic you know! Rushing to the toilet every hour or so. I hope I don't have diarrhea tomorrow. I certainly don't want to be rushing to the toilet every few hours!!   Okay, I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow blog! It's gonna be an exciting day. Fixing puzzles and baking cakes! HaHa! Goodnight!

      Heya! Ayiah, yesterday, BlogSpot went offline. So I have no chance whatsoever to create a blog. Now I do.  Yesterday a lot of things happened. Firstly, while waiting for CQ in Woodlands Interchange,I met SL. Now, SL asked me "Why haven't you made up with WQ?". Everybody's asking me this question you know! I really wonder why. Not really. I think WQ told everybody he's no longer angry at me or something.......and now everybody's asking me why I aren't friends with him. I am really confused lor. CQ told me WQ said he preferred we aren't talking, but everybody thinks otherwise. Who is right? Should I get my hopes up high? But one thing for sure, I am not gonna talk. Seriously. Yes, even though i am wrong in screaming at him, he used violence on me, and humilated me in public. That, I cannot tolerate. I hate people using violence on me (then why do you think I am actively against WWF and violent scenes?). It's his fault if you use violence you know. He could have asked nicely, without resorting to violent means. He used violence, then I screamed. Even though I could have not screamed, but I was provoked by violence. See the full story? Sigh! Not that I don't want to be friends, but I refuse to be the one to speak first. Ayiah, see things as they progress along la.   After Phy (ayioh...feel like sleeping, and she assigned us homework) and Bio (I always fail my osmosis experiment!!), we went to Causeway Point to see the cost of ingredients for making SuPing's cake. But first, me and Amanda went to shop for mooncake. So little shops selling snowskin mooncake! We finally went to Bengawan Solo to buy our mini mooncakes. I brought a mini durian snowskin mooncake, while she brought a mini baked lian yong mooncake. We ate a bite of each other's mooncake (and gave Wendy some bites too). We still preferred out own snowskin and baked versions. HaHa!   We brought the cake mix and the Hundreds and Thousands sprinkling thingy there. I paid fully for my part, and so has Wendy. So many people are paying. We are cooking in Yvonne's house on Monday, after our jigsaw fixing! HaHa!I am supposed to bring back the cake mix and spinking thingy. After buying, I went to Wendy's house to do homework (oh! Tuition tomorrow, I mean, today).   There, I completed my Physics and English homework. While doing so, I started reminicising about my friendship with Siva. I think we grew further apart these years. And I am like, very sad about this. These years, I did not interact with her very often. I always leave her for my friends.....and I feel so guilty about it. I really miss the days we walked home together from school. After choir every Sat, we would like go to Shop and Save in 883 and buy bars of chocolates. Then walked around 883. I really miss those days man! Me and Siva were like very close back then. Talk about almost everything in the world! Yep! Hmm... maybe, this is a sign of moving on? No! I certainly don't want to. Me and Siva would always be friends forever. :)  After that, we started talking about our good old days, our primary school days. I learnt quite a lot of things about Wendy...very hilarous! I feel very much like visiting Mr Shah, but I don't know where he's posted to. Hmm...must inquire from friends. Ahhh...the good old days. So much memories.  And hahaha! I keep laughing throughout the day! You see ar, while walking to her block, she was telling me that she's very disheartened, because she didn't recieve a prezzie from her angel. She said it seems like the angel doesn't care about her. Then, at her desk, I rummaged through a file! And guess what? I saw her prezzie from her Angel! I started smiling funnily. There she is, complaining about not receiving a present, and her prezzie is in her file all along! She asked me what I am smiling so crazily about. I told her "your stupidity" and refused to say more. Later on, while walking to 88 with her, I told her why I called her stupid. She was like "Really? HAHA", and she said she never checked her file. that made me wonder how long was the prezzie inside file. HaHa! The present was cute...and original! Never thought of that! Ha!  Okay, I gotta go to her house le.....see ya later tonight, blog! Bye!

      Okay...heya! Even the cats meowed. I got lots to tell ya today.   Firstly, I lost my excellent grade you know!! I tell you what happened. While I was walking up the stiars, I met Mrs Chew. She told me, "Kelvin Yip! No chance for you! You lost your chance already. Your choir teachers talked to me. So, you can't get excellent. Never mind la. Very good is good already!" When she told me this, three thoughts came to my mind. First, when she said "No chance for you", I was like thinking "What? What? What did I do?". then she said "Your choir teachers talked to me", I was like "Oh my! Did they tell Chew what i said in my testimonial is wrong?" Then she said "A very good is good already", I knew it was my conduct grade lor. Oh well. I was kinda dissappointed for a while, and went on blaming the choir teachers. But then i realized something. Mrs Chew worked hard to get me an excellent grade. I should be very grateful and thankful to her. And being nominated for excellent is a reconginition. I am very happy liao lor. At least I am being nominated and Mrs Chew is trying to get me get excellent. Yeah! :)  After that, there is this photo-taking thingy for the whole class. Two major events happened. One is the omission of "Kelvin" in my name! Now, that is an insult, to me, to my memory and to my exsistence. I hastened to write my real name down there. But! However! I was stopped by Janet and Shuet Ling (with a few glares and threatens). I didn't get to write my name down. I got damned pissed off. The more I think about it, the more angry I got. They told me to tell the person in charge. I don't want to bother him. What if he glares at me? What if he dismiss me off? Then I will get nothing accomplished. Besides, I got too used to the inefficient administration regarding my name (the only time when it was effective was when Mrs Chua and Mrs Chew helped me to put "kelvin" there in my name for O Level. Thank you, both of you!). I rather do it myself. So, I asked Mrs Chew, who was standing nearby, for a pen. She knew right away I wanted to add "Kelvin". HaHa! And Arman also made changes to his name (or rather. his father's). After I wrote my name, I felt immensely statisfied with myself. For adding Kelvin there, and for "defying Janet's and SL's wishes". Woah! I felt so shuang and happy. The other major event is that during the informal shoot, I rushed down in front of Mrs Chew's and kneeled there. The class was like shouting for KY to go down there in front of Mrs Chew and I thought it sounded like fun! So I rushed down there. And the 4/4 ppl watching applauded and whistled. HaHa! Crazy! I ordered both photos (formal and informal).   Another major event is the history mock exam. That exam took us by surprise! None of our predicted topics came up. Ah Ji and me were like studying the fall of communism topic, but it didn't come up. Neither did Germany. It was a "worst-case scenario" paper. And Jalil said it's a possibility. Ahh! I did the source-based first. It was quite easy la. The topic was the fall of ciommunism. That chapter we studied upon. At least I had lots of background info. For the SEQ, i did the topic on "World War 2 in the Pacific". HaHa! That was quite easy. I studied that yesterday, using the notes and worksheets ( a pathetic few....). Actually, it was only the marking scheme for Mid-Year paper 2003. Mrs Jalil was quite right after all. Study her marking scheme only. Ha! I think I can do well. Definitely above 30. Yeah.   Today is Sabrina's last episode. And in my opinion, it was simply the best! Sabrina was supposedly to be marrying Aaron tofay. She got cold feet, and have a lot of doubts in her. Whether Aaron is her soulmate or not. Their soulstones don't match. Really. While she was making her vows, she said, "I, Sabrina Spellman, agree to marry Aaron, my.....my...my..." She can't say the word "soulmate" out. Both of them had a talk. They agreed to cancel off the wedding, because Sab isn't gonna be happy. She ran out of the church, and met Harvey. Harvey was waiting for her, to get some answers on his soulstone. She ran towards him, and both of them kissed. Their soulstones fell out, and it was a perfect match. Sabrin and Harvey. Everyone came out, and appluaded them. Sabrina went away with Harvey in his bike. This is such a perfect ending (therefore, we doubt there would be further episodes of Sabrina). I always wanted to see Harvey and Sabrina together. This is so sweet, so romantic, and so right! You know, Sabrina has taught me a lot of life lessons. A lot lor. I am really attrached to Sabrina. I will really miss Sab. I really will!    We brought Arman's prezzie today. What a cute jigsaw! I can't wait to assemble it!  And oh yes. I am going to Wendy's tomorrow to teach her A-Maths. I hope I make a good tutor. And I hope she understands. Yeah. That's the most important. Yeah. I am tired now. I gotta go le.....see ya tomrrow, blog! Goodnight!

      Continuing from yesterday's blog entry.....The second major event is that there's a major accusation of me liking Wendy. You see ar. Everytime during recess, I would play a silly game with CQ. I would try to spot Bright in the crowd of street-bandy players (I call him Bright Bright! HAHA! I got this from Amanda, who claled him Bright Bright a lot). Okay, so today, we four were walking in the parade square. I was saying, "Where's he?" CQ spotted him. Yit Hann was going "Where Who?!". WQ was going "That bastard ar?" three times. (Hello lor! As if you are any better!) Anywhere, YH found out who "he" is. Then, they went on talking about the "affair" between me and Wendy. Like I am the third-party. And that I am stupid to be encouraging them all the time. Come on lor! There's nothing between us!! We are just close friends. Why must people always like that one?! Last time happened to me and Siva. Then now it is me and Wendy. Spread rumours everywhere, and making us feel so uncomfortable. Not really uncomfortable, we usually heck care lor. But this is getting so annoying lor. And I am not stupid to be siding them (Wendy and Bright). they are my friends. I side my friends. If you noticed, I sided you too. Even if you may not remember.   Today, I did a "bad" deed. I refused to give up my seat to a woman with a baby on her arms. Why leh? I was like talking about my argumentative compo I did for my mock exam ("Girls are less capable than boys". I naturally disagree. What a nonsense statement! Crazy conventional thinking! Girls are not lousier than boys, okay?!), then they (CQ, WQ and XC) stared at me and said in a low voice, asking me to give up my seat. I panicked lor. I became very flustered. Three pairs of eyes staring at me (possibly 4, the woman standing near me), expecting me to give up my seat. I refused to give up my seat lor. I just don't know why. I just don't want to live up to sudden expectations, just like that lor. So much pressure is placed on me. Not that I am inconsiderate you know. I would give up my seat, provided I know beforehand lor and no pressure is put on me to give up my seat. Seriously ma. I think you would rather do a kind deed when it is up to you to do it lor, and not your friends there expecting and pressurizing you to do it.   Tomorrow, there's A-Maths lesson after History mock exam (which I only studied the worksheets and notes). Ayioh! This is atrocious! After History mock some more leh! One later! That means what? 3.15? And he's gonna end at 4.45. Or later! HOW CAN I WATCH SABRINA IF IT ENDS AT 4.45? And somemore, tomorrw's Sabrina episode is the last episode!! Last eiposde leh! I cannot afford to miss you know! Therefore, I am skipping A-Maths lesson.With Wendy and Amanda. We are buying Arman's present. Yeah! Arman's present come first. And besides, I get to go home early. I do realise, of course, that my friends have a lot to say about this. But this time, I am putting my foot down lor. Friends and Sabrina comes first! Most definitely they do! And I don't think Radha's teaching new things lor. I can afford to skip la. Even cats skip lessons. Me-ow Meow!   I want to discuss something one. But I forgot what it is. Oh well. That's a sign that I am going. Yeah. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight!

      Okaty. I better type quick, cause Charmed is showing later. Cannot tun tun tu tu (dawdle) ar!  Okay. Basically. Two major events happened. One is CQ and Amanda getting their prezzies. Amanda got a cool necklace. :)CQ got a bottle of Ice Lemon Tea along with a card of note! That note is of particular interest!! It says something about choir instructor giving us that card (the card accompanied by the note is similar to the one miss choo gave us) , about treasuring friendship. The note's so sweet! Ahh! We guessed it is either a non-choir member, or a choir member pretending to be a non-choir member. With makes the guess useless, since it includes everybody. HaHa! CQ keep guessing it's me, and keeps asking Hann when I was ever out of his sight today (I was with him throughout the day today!). I think it's XX and YY, due to the fact that both of them knows he likes ILT, especially YY. But!! The colour of the words makes it XX. Me and Amanda made a bet. She guessed XX, I guessed YY. We treat each other drinks. If none of our guesses are correct, then we treat CQ drinks. And no, I am not gonna reveal XX and YY. You try asking Amanda lor.   The second major event is that there's a major accusation of me liking Wendy. You see ar. Everytime during recess, I would play a silly game with CQ. I would try to spot Bright in the crowd of street-bandy players (I call him Bright Bright! HAHA!). Okay, so today, we four were walking in the parade square. I was saying, "Where's he?" CQ spotted him. Yit Hann was going "Where Who?!". WQ was going "That bastard ar?" three times. (Hello lor! As if you are any better!) Anywhere, YH found out who "he" is. Then, they went on talking about the "affair" between me and Wendy. Come on lor! There's nothing between us!! AYIOH! I gotta go now! I know that this is a major anti-climax. But I gotta go no!! Charmed's about to show! Bye bye!

      Hey hey! It's a meowing day! Okay okay...not really meowing. Let me narrate the day in detail, since I am wasting time waiting for Wendy to call. Or not.  I just realized something. I HAVEN'T PREPARED MY GIFT FOR THE MORTAL YET! You say how!!!! It's very atrocious you know! XC suggested something. I think I am gonna take his advice. Even though it is not my original idea...but hey! I am gonna make it very nice!  Today, YH finally talked to me. Like he became friendly to me and everything lor. I am so glad everything's worked out fine! HaHa! Yeah....kinda. I hope the WQ crisis would end up "happily ever after" (Hey! I learnt it in Sabrina today!).  I got my Bio Practical back. Honestly, it sucks. The only thing that saved me from failing is the theory questions at the back. I almost got full marks (saved for one). And it is ironic that Mrs Chua says the theory questions are the ones that separates the A1 material. Because the theory questions saved my skin. Looks like Jason is right, after all. What good if you are good in theory, but not good in practical? Sigh!!!!   Today, we stayed back to do homework. Actually, I am the only one doing homework. The rest is either revising or being taught. "We" refers to me, XC, CQ, Janet, MeiYing, SL and PeiYing. HaHa! I didn't complete History homework after all. Mainly because Ah Ji persuaded me to do Maths, and do History with him tomorrow dueing MT lesson. But!! He said that he will do tonight! I panicked! I don't wanna do History alone! So, what I did was I completed history just now. Yeah. Feel so guilty now! Ha!! Dunnoe what to do tomorrow la!  Hey! Wendy left me a message in her blog. And here's my reply. Oh look! I have full confidence in you! Don't worry about it, okay? I will try to teach you to the best of my ability. Ayiah....Don't worry lor. What else can I say besides "don't worry lor"? Oh yeah. Good luck to your Prelims? Okay! I stop stressing you out. And I won't get stressed out one la!  Oh yes. My neighbour, the sister of Edmund, wants me to help her print. I refused flat, even though she has to pass up tomorrow. She is always doing this me you know. And she keep saying "Ladt time"! When it is ever gonna be the last time? Why can't she ask her friends to print for her? Why must always depend on me? And she is doing this last minute lor! I hate last minute work lor! So, this actually gives you a lesson not to do last minute work, and don't always depend on your neighbour for help. They are extremely unreliable.  Okay, my eyes are getting blurry. I realize that this is a sucky entry. But oh well. I gotta go sleep now. Goodnight blog!

      Hey hey! I just came back from watching Comedy Nite. Yeah. Gao Xiao Xing Dong! So long never play already! The programme is still as funny as ever! Especially the Liang Xi Mei sketch! HaHa!   Alright! First thing first! FFIX updates! So long never update le! Guess I am too busy, huh? Okay....I won the Tetra Master tournament! Surprise Surprise! I sucks at Tetra Mster...didn't expect to win. Okay...I drew the first round, so I get to go again. I won. Pure luck. Then, second round, I won again! Oh my!! I think I am getting the hang of this game. Then, I won the third round, against Erin the Oglop Master. She's easy! HaHa! Anyway, I went to get the Burman Coffee thingy. After that, witnessed few amazing FMVs (like Alexandar protecting the castle...cool!). I get to use Beatrix again! Cool! Now, I am at Lindblum. Yep!  Okay, I downloaded most of the songs in Wendy's notebook. Took about an hour or so! HaHa! They were very nice...very very nice! :) Some of the songs I couldn't download, and Wendy doesn't have....so wait till next time lor.   Okay...what is really interesting is that me and Ben decided to throw away all our Chinese materials. We were originally deciding to throw them into a recycling bin, down at Siva's block. BUT! BUT! It's gone! We have no choice....but to throw parts of them into various rubbish bins scattered around the area (we don't want to congest the bin ma). We were a funny sight. We chose to throw each worksheet by each worksheet, and saying out the names of the worksheet before throwing. We were quite a sight. Two kids were staring at us and laughing. Lots of peopled looked at us. HaHa! We finally completed our work at the rubbish bin down my block (where I threw away my 4B workbook). I gotta admit, it felt...shuang! Great! throwing away signifies the riddance of Chinese in our lives (at least, until A Levels)! YaY!   Okay, then later, I went down to MacDonalds in 768 to get Wendy's ViVi drawing. You gotta admit...her drawing is so nice! ViVi looks so real! Woah! I taped it to my closet doors (where other posters are). Even my brother and Edmund said Wendy's a great artist! Thanks Wendy!  Speaking of that idiotic neighbour! He is so damn qian bian! He comes to our house uninvited (why...he practically flew here after spotting my brother return from movie-seeing!!) and he demands the use of the playstation! Now!! I was playing FFIX that time and I wanted to watch Sabrina. I originally wanted to let him use at 6, after Sabrina. But! he insulted the way I played FFIX (I ran away from 2 and more monsters in a party....For goodness sake! I only had Zidane, and don't have that much patience to wait for the ATB guage to fill up to kill two or more monsters!)! I was so angry at him disrupting my game...so I decided to play FFIX at 6. I told him so when I was watching Sabrina....and he complained and became noisy. NOW! I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TALK IN LOUD VOICES WHEN I AM WATCHING TV! I became more determined to use the PS at 6. After all, I live here. He doesn't. He has no rights to use the TV when I want to use. He then told me, "You are as selfish as your mother!" Now!! I am so gonna tell Mom about this! He's afraid of Mom...he never comes when she's home, mainly because she doesn't allow him to play the PS. Dad doesn't mind him at all. Mom is so right in not allowing him! Oh! He is so gonna pay, for disrupting my Sabrina-watching and insulting me and mother!  Okay...I gotta go now. Friends is about to start! See ya tomorrow, blog! Goodnight!

      Meowing Friday! Meow meow meow!!  Today leh, only studied Physics (Completed unit on Thermal Physics) and SS (completed Governance). The morning was spent outtta home.  Meow meow!! Haha! Father woke me up today. Ha! It turned out that Mum, who was supposed to wake me, fell asleep. Father said, "If I never woke you all up, when are you gonna sleep until?". Ha! I then bathed, and the three of us went out lor.  Firstly, we went to the market in Marsiling to eat breakfast. Me and Mom ate kueh chap (again!), while Dad ate praqn noodles. Meow meow!! After eating, Mom went to the market to get some things while Dad went to buy 4D. Meow!! They wanted to buy some shorts for brother, but they didn't in the end. All the shorts my brother hates, according to them.  Next, we went to Sheng Shiong in Woodlands Central. Woah!! The reception there is so lousy!! Because I am "chatting" with XC and WQ via SMS, it was very vexing to see most of my messages cna't be sent, and I have to run outside to send SMS. Ergh!!! I am 'perpetually vexed'!Anyway, we brought a lot of household goods. Me-ow meow!! After Sheng Shiong, we set off towards Guan Xiang Chye in Geylang. Mother wants to get some vinegar and cooking supplies.   En route, I looked at Sheng Shiong's reciept. I noticed hor, they liked to charge things to some weird figures (like $1.44). Why they want to charge in $0.01 prices? 1 cent coins are no longer in circulation le ma. Mother told me, if the cent is below $0.05, the shops will round down to nearest 10 cent. If it is above $0.05, shops would round down to nearest $0.05, instead of rounding up to $0.10. Mother shoudl know. She works as a cashier Strange leh! Either way, the shop lose money. Mother say if they round up, the customer pays for extra. Meow!! This reminds me of the time shops used to charge things $1.99, and call them cheap. Hello! This is practially $2!! Cheap meh? I think they deliberately do that to make the product look cheapter, becuase the '1' figure looks smaller than '2'. Stupid really! You might as well be paying $2 for a $1.99 goods. I would always scoff at the $1.99 prices. Meow!!   Okay...we arrived at Guan Xiang Chye. Mother brought vinegar, some flour and dunnoe what items there. Meow meow!! We left the place at 12. We then arrived home at 12.30.   That brother ar! Came home so late! I was so hungry you know!! Meow meow!! Went back to Woodlands Central to eat lunch. So nice, the yi mee! Okay okay....came back and called WQ over. He's studying SS with me today.  Yeah...he came at 3!! So late that idiot!! He came here and studied Substainable Development. He asked me questions on how to explain and link factors to the topic. I tried my best to make him understand. I also studied my SS and Physics while he's there. Meow meow!! He's very kaypoh. And I wonder what will he think today about my house? Very noisy? HaHa! The door keep banging when I close it. And it was so loud he had to close his ear everytime I shut the door. Meow meow! After studying, he came online lor. Meow!!  Okay....after that, surfed more internet while parents buy dinner back. Ate dinner and watched TV, then came online. I think I stop writing le la. Survivor's almost showing, don't wanna miss it. See ya tomorrow! Bye blog!

      Oh meow meow!! Thursday. A day full of exciting, adrenaline-filled events.  Okay...Revision Update. I completed an E-Maths chapter (Geometry), a SS chatper (People: Our Only Resource) and completed the Physics Unit of Electricty (Magnetism and Electromagnet). I found that hor, I am very early in my revision. Later hor, I will have nothing to revise come the days before the subject's exam! Woah!!   Okay...the main attraction of the day lies in the afternoon. I am meeting XC, Mel, HuiMin and Ben in the library to study together. I said I won't come until I studied my SS and E-Maths. I did them in the morning, so I went there lor.  I went to the library to try to find HuiMin first. Woah!! I cannot find her. Searched everywhere. Later, at 2nd floor, she spotted me. Meow meow!! We then called Melvin, who said will be coming. So, we went to the chair and started first. I was looking at the problems in my A-Maths TYS when Melvin messaged, asking us to go down to BK to eat. We go down lor.  At BK, we chatted a bit. We are trying to spot XC. After a while, he came and we all came running outside telling him to go BK. Meow meow!! Today's Chem Prac was easy. His titration was very accurate and he got full marks for QA. Ayiah! Overall full marks lor! Meow meow!! After that, we ate lor. I brought a drink (using XC's money).  After that, we chatted, then started doing revision. Ben then joined us. We then studied and studied. I studied the Physic chatpers lor. All thanks to Wendy's Longman book. I finally understood magnetism!! Before long, Ben wanted to move up to the cinema. There are tables there.   We moved up there lor. Thern, we brought popcorn so we won't get chased out. I owed XC money again. I completed the Physics chapters!! Then, HuiMin said she wanted to watch The Park, a scary movie. I was very reluctant, because today got tutition ma. I called home to lie about doing homework and returning at 7. XC said I lie without batting my eyelids. Meow!! Then, Father called. He said to cancel if I am to come home that late. So I cancelled my tutition lor. Besides, I feel confident already. Alright. Once that is done, we go buy tiks. They also gave us 3D glasses. Oh. A 3D movie.  Woah!! I was quite nervous you know! My first time watching horror movies. Meow meow!! First scene already so scary le. I felt like going out and don't watch le. My heart kept thumping away. Adrenaline keep rushing through my body (ahh! Niow I know what to write for the effects of adrenaline....if that qns ever does come out!). Woah lao!! Every scary scene is so darn scary. I could have a heart attack any minute you know! My fingers were constantly in my ear, and it went deeper as scary scenes come out. Meow meow!! The scenes are still stuck in my memory!! Ayiah!! How!!!! But the ending is nice. It's touching!  Came back at 7.15, bathed, ate and came online. Better end this. WQ!! I finished writing le ha!! Gimme the address now!! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

Okie...today I went out to eat breakfast with Mother. I ate laksa. We then went to the Shop N Save (after buying Eight Days). I read Eight Days while follwing her walk around Shop N Save checking out new prices and codes for fruits and veggies. Meow meow! We came back at 9.30. Then, I got distracted! I started reading the Charmed book (Gypsy Enchantment) and read and read nons-top for 1 hour until the end of the book. So enchanting! Woah!! I wanna find out is Ivan really terrible. Gypsy magick galore!  Ayiah...I got study la...Study study study until 12. Me and Mother went to 768 to eat kuay chap. Then, we met my brother, who went to MacDonald's to eat.  Came back. Yada yada Yada. Studied Studied Studied, with minor interruptions here and there as the family is asking me advice for which course to choose (my brother's going to Sec 3 next year).   I stopped studying at 4.45. I came online and relaxed la. Meow meow meow until now lor. And today wor! Ying TianCheng died!! He finally died! Hurray! YaY!!! Meow meow meow!!

      Meow!! Tuesday befalls on us like raining cats and ducks.  Okay. I studied an E-Maths chapter (Geometry), a Bio chapter (Plant Nutrition) and two Physics chapters (Radioactivity). Meow!!! Hmm...good work!  Okay...after studying these chapters in the morning, I went online to wait for the return of Father. We are going out today afternoon ma. Meow meow meow!! I mainly checked my mail and read forums.  Father came back at 11, and we went off. First, my mom went to Ang Mo Kio to buy incense and other peripherals for praying. Stocking up, supplies were low. Then, we went to Balestier Road to eat the chicken rice from some famous store.  Woah! The rice taste super! Oh! The chicken meat too!! Sumptous! So tender and smooth! The chicken parts...hmm!! The fish head in some sauce is nice too! And you know what? While eating, we saw some celebrities walked past. Jack Neo, Mark Lee and the Chen Jianbing. The actors from the Comedy Night lor. Woah! Everyone was staring at them as they walked past. Me-ow meow!   After the fulling lunch, we went to the Popular in Toa Payoh. I wanted to buy a SS assessment guide. Ayiah! They don't stock it there. But, I found a great find! Charmed story books! Lots and lots of them! YaY!! I got three books! Date With Death, Gypsy Enchantment and Between Worlds (the one which I wanted yesterday! YaY!!). Meow meow meow!  Then, my parents fetched my brother home. We (the three of us) went to Causeway Point to check out the Popular for my book. The parents went to deal with their CPF whatsoever, and I went to Popular.  As again, nothing. Sigh! My luck! While waiting for my parents to come up after their CPF business, I read the SAT and PSAT guide book. Woah! The English section is damn easy man! All primary school stuff! Meow meow meow! I had so much fun doing the exercises.   Okay..after a while parents came. We went to Courts to pay bills. I brought a CD-holder there! So cute and innovative! We then went to Shell to pump diesel, then returned home. I played a couple of games before going to eat dinner.  We ate dinner at 768. Then, I went home to watch Holland V. Woah! Today Su Hao told LingLing his feelings towards her. So sweet! LingLing rejected...because she's not ready. Please be ready!! Everybody wants them together! And hor, hahaha!! Good for LingLing! She kicked TianCheng in the face! YaY!! And tomorrow, Ying TianCheng is gonna die by being struck by lightning. I thought he's gonna drown. Whatever. He dies! YaY! AFter that, watch TV lor.

      Meow meow!! Today's Monday. Yeah. How...deary.  Today leh, I only managed to study one a-maths chapter (Indices and Surds) and a Physics chapter (Energy and Power). Meow meow meow!! Feel so guilty...and tomorrow morning going out with family. HaHa!  Okay...today, me, Hann and Wendy are supposed to go Guan Ying Temple to pray for O Level Success lor. But first, let me narrate the day's happenings. Okay, I woke up at 9 (i was woken by by the sounds of the vacuum, but I fell asleep after that). Then, I took a bath and ate breakfast.  After that, I watched Friday's Holland V episode. HaHaHa!! The JingJing got a very accurate mouth "He (Ying TianCheng) will drown in sea!" !!! HaHaHA!! I wan to see how JingJing and the family will react when they heard the news man! I also ate my lunch (noodles).  Then, I studied the Physics chapter, then went online. At 12, I prepared myself to go outside lor. I went out of the house at 12.25.  I met Wendy at Admiralty MRT. We milled around Popular for a while, then hopped onto the train towards Sembawang. We waited for the late Yit Hann till 1.15 or so. Haiz. So late. We saw a lot of interesting couples riding up the escalators. People nowadays are getting more daring while riding escalators. I saw a woman rubbing her boyfriend's butt. She caught me looking and immediately stopped! HAHAHA! Then, I saw another couple. The male was biting (lovebites?) his girl's shoulders. People are really getting more daring. Wendy said I am very kaypoh. Ha!  Okay, after Hann arrived, we hopped into the south-bound train towards City Hall. I mainly read my book I brought along (Charlotte's Web). It's a very good book! I admire Charlotte's loyalty for a friend and her selflessness. Meow meow!! Wendy and Hann asked each other SS questions. They said hor, I am very abosrbed into my book. Yeah what. Reading should be absorbing ma. After reaching City Hall, we board the east-bound train towards Bugis, which is only a stop away.  At bugis, I showed them the "prostitute house" I saw last time. They even have sign saying "If you want 2 do that, please call 9------". See!! Prostitute house indeed! Okay...the main attraction was not the brothel. We went to GuanYin Temple. Okay, we took incense and prayed lor. We first prayed to the skies, then to the GuanYin in the temple, then put our incense. We then went in, prayed some more and donated money. I took sweets for us (blessef by the goddess). I prayed for blessigns and success at O Levels, and also peace for everybody. That's it, yeah. I felt happy. Meow meow!!  We went back at around 2.30. Hann slept on the journey back. I read my book and Wendy studied SS. We and Wendy alighted at Admiratly and shopped around Popular! Woah lao! I am so heartbroken! I don't have enough money to buy the latest Charmed book!!!! Wendy refused to lend me money! You say how! I say hor, by tomorrow, the books will be sold out. Only 2 of them you know!!! I am so heartbroken!  Okay....reached home at 4. I bathed and then studied Maths lor. After studying, I rewarded myself with playing a GunBound game. Meow meow! I went to eat dinner at 6, reaching home at 6.45 to watch Holland V. Father brought durians! Yum!!!  Today's Holland V episode was nice! Family reunion! So heartwarming. YanYan finally forgave her family! That's so cool! After that, I watch Comedy Nite and came online.  I giotta go le. I wanna watch 'Are You Hot'. Ooh boy! I love seeing contestants getting critisized. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! I am back again, with today's news.  I went to the Evergreen Sec's meeting with the parents of Sec 2 pupils. I wanted to go there to ask why isn't History offered as a subject combination along with SS. I can't wait to see what pathetique excuses they can come up with. So, I woke up at 6.30, in order to reach there by 7.45.  Okay, we reached there at around 7.35. So early. We sat around (I was being insulted by my brother's friends. Meow!!) and then, at 7.45, the parents went up. Okay. You know what? My stuipid brother told us to come at 7.45, but parents are to be seated at 8.15. What a waste of time. I am gonna kill him. We sat a friend of my mom, who is also the mother of my brother's friends. They made small talk while I listened. And hor, I see no mikes being set up near the audience? Does that mean we cannot ask question? How could they!  At 8.15, the kids came in. Then, they played useless promotional videos for us to see. Stupid, really. Play for us for what? The prinicpal, Mrs Mary Koh, came to talk to us at 8.35.  She's a terrible speaker. She speaks so slow and she seems so unsure of what's she speaking. Oh god! I could have died of boredom from listening to her! Firstly, while introducing the Humanities subjects, she said the school does not offer History. Okay..... Then, next, when introducing the class list, she said again, "We do not have SS/History". DUHZ! We already established that fact long ago! A big mistake she made when introducing SS "It's about the history of Singapore" NONSENSE!!! Ayioh! She doesn't even know what she's saying! Oh god! I critisized her every speech. I think the people in front got sick of my complaints. HaHaHa!  Then, it's time for an external speaker to come talk about improving communications with parents and children. He got some points about parents only see the bad sides of their kids and focussing on them isntead of the good sides. Quite true! Then, i fell asleep for the rest of the speech. Ergh! After the speech, everybody was releashed. The dunnoe-who Mr Tan kept encouraging people to go to the PCCG corner to look at JCs and Polys and ITE courses. So annoying. Repeat that to every class!   Well, we went to the PCCG corner. So little people! And I was being recorded down you know...for reading the stupid leaflet the school gave my brother. So embarrassing! After that, me and mom went to the canteen to eat some refrehsments. We ate the what ar...chicken drumsticks, satay, pineapple tart and drank some drinks la. Hmmm! Not bad, the chicken wings. Taste nice too!  We returned home at 10.15. I watched some cartoons and came online lor. As you know, I went offline at 12 something to eat lunch. Then, I went to Wendy's house.  HaHa! I managed to complete two SS chatpers. The Singapore industrial restructuring one....sucks! Don't understand at all! Sigh!! I introed Wendy to the divination game we played. HaHa! She refused to tell me who it is, but she told Lassie. So, what I did was to tell Lassie "I give you a list of names. If it's the person, you bark, okay?". I gave a few names, and Lassie didn't bark. But!! HAHAHA! I tried another peron's name (whom I suspected of course). I shouted the name while jumping around the living room. Lassie barked (she don't like loud noises and people moving fast!). HAHAHA!! Good dog, Lassie! Qi shi Wendy! HaHa!! Then, we discussed about more issues. HaHa! I fell alsleep at the living room watching Wendy and her mom play a PS game. So embarassing! When I woke up, her mother said "Good morning!". HaHa!!   I left at 5.50 and went home. Reaching home at 6, I bathed and watched shows. Speaking of bathing, yesterday and today, I suffered soap attacks on my eye! Yesterday, a spurt of soap hit my right eye. Woah! So painful! Then today morning, another spray of soap hit my left eye! Now, I don't believe in coincidences. I believe I am being sent a message. To clear my vision? To clean my vision? Of what? I must dwell on this further!   I think I shall end here le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Heya! Woah woah woah! Sorry for not blogging yesterday. There's no time, really. So, in this blog, I will write what happened yesterday.  Yesterday, I, along with the other music students, went out for enjoyment. HaHa! Actually, I was very apprehensive on going, but due to Ben's and XC's invitation, I went lor. Ayiah....last day to relax le ma. Who went ar? Me, Mel, XC, Ben, EeChuang, JiaHui and HuiMin. Yeah.  First, we met at Woodlands MRT Station at 12.  Me and Ben went there and met XC, then we went to Burger King to eat la. I drank Pepsi there lor. After that, we met the rest at Woodlands MRT. Then, we proceeded towards Mel's house.  EC and Mel are gonna practise there, then Ben is gonna depart to Mr Low's house for practicals. After that, we are going to bowl. Okay...Mel has a lot of birds!! He even got a peahen (who kept squawking all day long). Oh oh! Let's not forget the fishes! He got so many fishes...3 luohans and so many more. HaHa! One of the luohan and another white fish were fighting. At first hor, we thought they were kissing (lip to lip ma)...then we realized that the luohan is biting the lip of the white fish. HaHaHa!! The two fishes keep fighting each other. After watching fishes and hearing performances, it's time for lunch! They brought two cans of chicken soup and we heated it....woah! Quite nice leh!   After eating, we decided to play daidee. HaHa! That Benjamin got 'cursed' by Mel! He lost the game and I entered. I didn't win la. I got so good cards you know! I can't bear to use them!! But nobody wants to use 5-cards combinations!! Or else, I can easily win the meow meow game! After watching a few games, Ben and HuiMin left for Mr Low's house. We played another game. It's a kinda-divination game, where it tells you in what placing are you in in your lover's hearts. Only the girls and Mel played. Me and XC just watched. HaHa!!! After that, we played Cheat. I ended up taking one big pile of cards, just because I dunnoe how to cheat. HaHa!! But I got almost every card in my hands. A-ha! They can't cheat so easily. EC got out firist, leaving me, Mel and XC. We were like neever ending, keep pushing cards towards one another. After 15 minutes of that, we decided to give up le. Then, Mel and EC practised one more time, and Mel went to bath. I tell you ar! I dunne what happened you know! My nose suddenly bled! Oh meow meow!! Did I mention my nose bled on Thursday too? Ergh! What's wrong with me?  We went out of Mel's house to meet with HM and Ben in Marsiling MRT. We went to buy bubble tea when waiting for the two late-comers (who were watching WanXin's video in Mr Low's house. HaHa! XC they all said it was a striptease and mentioned something about LB). We met with Ben and HM n Marsiling later on, and took the train to CCK station. Woah! While waiting for the train, my nose bled again! I tried to control the blood from running out......Ha! We took the train to CCK, then took the LRT to Bukit Panjang. My frist time riding the LRT leh. So cool. They even fogged up the windows when the LRT came near HDB blocks (to protect the privacy of the residents la). Coolies!  We alighted at BP station and walked towards the shopping complex. On the way, we discussed XC's 9 concubines and a porcupine. Even the bigot cat practises bigamy!! Meow!! When we arrived at the bowling centre, guess what? It was full! They wrote my name down on the waiting list, then we went down to eat at KFC. Due to the lack of cash, I only ate fries there (to conserve money for games). Ben even called his god-brother to come sponsor him money. Woah!! We discussed so many issues there. Like Charmed. Mel and I are Charmed fans! Meow meow!!   We went up again, but then, the bowling alley is booked for tounament. Sigh!! No bowling today! Ben's godbrother arrived and gave him $50. Woah!! The whole gang made him pay for a NeoPrint. We then left BP Complex and went to Causeway Point to take NeoPrints. On the bus leh, everybody discussed American Idol. About Simon Conwell, Kelly Clarkson and so many cats!   Oh yeah! We took Neoprints there. The first pic was sponsored by Benjamin. Woah!! Meow meow!! We decided to take another pic. This time, we made the girls wear costume. HuiMin wore a kimono, EC a sailor's costume and JiaHui a Santa outfit. Me-ow meow! We took pics again! Meow!! Before returning home, we went down to Basement 1 to drink bubble tea. I drank Honeydew Milk Tea. After that, me and Ben took 913 back home.  I watched Survivor! There was actually talk of voting Rupert out (Drake lost agian! Sigh sigh Sigh!). Oh my god! This cnanot be. The who ar, Trish and Jon wanted to vote for Rupert. Luckily, Sandra and Chista, being loyal to Rupert, told him about the secret plan. He then went on to planned to vote Trish out. At the Tribal Council, it was quite touching. Rupert felt betrayed by his own tribe (the idiot half of it). When Sandra described who's she gonna vote, I thought it was Jon! And this time, they showed us everybody's votes. Woah!! But they didn't show Shawn's. He the deciding vote between voting Trish out or creating a tie between Rupert and Trish. Woah! In the end, Trish got voted out! Meow meow!! Plot against Rupert some more la! And the bastard Jon better watch out! Who I think should be Sole Survivor? Either Rupert or Andrew Savage. Yeperino! :)  AlrighT! I gotta go eat lunch. See ya tonight, blog! Byes!!

      Hey hey! Oh yeah! Charmed was great last night! Demon-vanquishing cats!  Today leh, we had English. I am quite sick of doing compre and compos, if you ask me. HaHa! The Part 2 must include interviews. I wrote about Takeshi Kanashiro lost a 1-billion-yen in the earthquake. HaHaHa!! Lame KY... Then, Mrs Thong told us lots of stories the students wrote. One particularly funny one is that one student wrote himself as a horse (under the title "disappointment"). He fell in love with a female horse and "can't wait for the mating season!" Then, when the mating season came, he went into the female stable and saw his horsey-friend doing "it" to her! He felt dissappointed that he cna't mate with the female horse. OH MY GOD!! Such a story also can!! No wonder Mrs Thong failed him. Meow meow!!   After English, I had SS and History. Meow meow! I did okay for both papers, totalling a total of 76 points! Me-ow meow! My essay for SS was printed you know!! So proud of myself! Mrs Jaili said I explained and evaluated the factors very well! O.O!! Meow meow!   I didn't study anything you know! I came back today too tired. I did some exercises on excretion, but that's not really studying, because I studied the chapter already. Felt so suilty you know. And tomorrow I am having my final day of relaxation with Ben, XC they all. See la. No studying. Meow!!!  Hmm...I promised you I would continue my yesterday's blog hor? WQ came over to my house today. Took a hell of a time for him to get here. Meow!! We then studied lor. I studied 5 chapters of Physics. Woo-hoo! WQ later told CQ that he thought about food all the time while in my house. He saw that my kitchen was well-stocked with food (instant noodles, ice-cream, snacks). Like we are preparing for some war. No la where got! Parents always buy in bulk one ma. And you don't know the horrible consumption of my family towards instant noodles. We finish them fast. HaHa! And hor, he told me he ate le. Around 4 something, he then come and tell me he wants to eat, because he hasn't eaten anything yet. I don't want to cook for him because it;s too late le. Father's gonna be back soon and later have ot go out to eat dinner. See la. Lie some more. :P Next time ar, don't lie to me about things like that hor. Crazy cat! I think he's just scared of my mother la. Crazy cat!!! Meow meow! He left at 5.30 la.   While eating at 768, I met 510 ex-owners. Lararine and her family. Meow meow!! Long time no see le!   Woah! I tell you ar! I felt so happy when I read 8 Days. Ying TianCheng is gonna die!! YaY!!!!!! He drowned while trying to look at naked women swimming! Retribution! YaY!! Meow meow! So happy man!  I am logging off le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Hey hey! Surprised to see moi? HaHa! There's no tuition today, so I can come online and write blog. Meow meow!  Today we had English (and tomorrow too!). I was very pissed in the morning. These two days are actually quite a wastage of time (no offense to Mrs Thong.....but seriously!). I could have used the morning time to study you know! I find that I am seriously lacking of time!! I only study in the morning and afternoon. That's all. Give up night to study? No way man! I already made a lot of sacrifices!! Thereore, I am irked by the fact that I have to come back in school in the morning for both days. Meow!!  Hmm..English today is not bad la. I scored a surprising 31 marks in the compre. I think I let my guard down too much when it comes to easy papers. HaHa! Okay....meow meow! I went back home at around 2pm. I want to rush home to start revison!   Chan le la! I got stomach cramps...why do they always do this to me now? Gtg le...see ya tomorrow. Night!

      Meow meow!! So many interesting things happened today!   Today's my Bio Prac O level exam la. Woah! I am in 3rd shift man! Which means I can wake up at 8....HaHa! At 8 leh, my friends are preparing to go school le (for some, started their prac!). And I just woke up only! Muahahahaha! So shuang ar!! I want to take taxi one...but in the end, I decided to take bus (what a sorry decision! I shoulda took a taxi! tell ya why later!). So, before going, I studied another 2 chapters of Bio (and another chapter on the bus. I fianlly understood ultrafiltration!). I stepped out of the house at 10.10am.  Woah! I walked to the 913 busstop. See quite a number of people holding Bio textbooks. Ahh! Their surname must have started along the letters of W, X, Y or Z. We are always the last ones! I see them holding notes to study. I didn't see any practical workbook. I think our school is one the rare ones to order prac workbook fro students! Okay okay....took 913 bus and arrived at the interhchange at around 10.25. Woah! Wait for the 962 bus for 15 minutes! So horrible! I thought I am gonna end up late! A very unfortunate event happened on the bus (which makes me regret NOT taking a taxi). You see ar, a large group of people came up the bus in the bustop opposite Sembawang MRT. Two seconda later, I detected a very pungent smell. A smell of faeces, actually. Woah! The smell grew by the seconds. And my stop is a torturous 3-stops away! I felt like gagging...but I decided to tolerate and just hold my nose. I suspect it's coming from an elderly man, who is standing quite near me. When my stop is coming, I decided to move to the rear door. The smell weakened, but it's still there (which proves my guess correct!). Woah! Everybody on the bus was holding their noses...buay tahan! When it's my stop, everybody rushed down man! Woah lao! I shoulda taken a taxi to school!  I arrived at school and went into the art room. All my three friends were there already. Woah! There were notes on the board, so we went through lor. Mdm Ho came in and explained everything on the board to us. She then sat down with the 4 of us and discussed la. Not about bio though! HaHa! We talked about Prom Night (ahh!! Wendy die le...MdmdHo say got. No la Wendy! No need tio fulfil your promise la! Just joking with you only la!), about JCs and so many things. Me-ow meow!   At 11.50, she led us up to the Bio Lab. Woah! I see the lab tables quite empty one leh. So little specimens! When the exam started, I flipped through the exam paper. It's very unexpected lor! So little experiments and so many theory questions! Such a dissappointment. Under strict regulations, I am not supposed to moan about my maths skill. So, I won't. There are a lot of maths calculation. Yeah. There's an expeiment we've done before. The holding leaf under water one. Woah! I just recorded what I remembered from Chua. HaHa! In the end, everybody said it was easy. Ha! I just felt dissappointed lor. Dunnoe from what. Being too easy that I made a lot of mistakes? Or tough maths questions? I am such a crazy cat.  I went up to class to take some worksheets and meet my friends. In the end, me, WQ, Janet, Gloria and Chun went to KFC. Me and WQ shared a meal. Chun kindly offered to change my coleshaw. So good! Must smile at her more often!   Eat eat until 3. Arrived home at around 3.30. Then, I bathed until 3.55. I then hem-hawed for a while, dunnoe whether to do a-maths or SS. I decided on A-Maths in the end (I am quite confident of SS....Last Friday I didn't study...but I found the test quite easy....or issit because I've done the test already?). I studied the chapter on Co-ordinate Geometry. I did problems that covered almost the entire syllabus. Meow!! I did problems until what? 5.45? Then, I called WQ and chatted with him till 6.30. Chat chat chat.   I ate dinner (yummy yummy frog legs!), watched Holland V, PCK and Lydia and came online. Ah!! I am very short of time revising. Going back to school on Wed and Thurs and wasting time doesn't help. Sigh!! I wonder if I can finish revising Physics, E-Maths and SS by 3rd Nov. I hope so!   I think I stop blogging le. See ya tomorrow (or not...since tomorrow's Charmed day).Night blog!

      KY: Me, duhz! C: Conscience (mine conscience of course!)   KY: Ayioh! What an eventful day today is!  S: Of course you would say that! What did you do today, huh?  KY: Study lor......went out lor.....  C: And? Not all study and going out or!   KY: Ayiah...play a bit of games lor!  C: Kelvin Yip! As an O Level cat, you must NOT get distracted! Study is very imp--  KY: Yes yes, I know I know! But the advice in Straits Times said to take breaks ma...so I took breaks in between studying lor.  C: That's no excuse, KY! Alright, what did you study today?  KY: Er, well. I studied 2 chapters of Bio (2nd and 3rd la). Then leh, I completed the theme of Conflict and Co-operation in SS lor. I made notes and everything. Mostly, I copied from notes and added a bit of my own from the SEQ essays I wrote. Then, I did half of Deyi Sec's Maths Paper 1 lor.  C: What? So little? Like that call study ar?  KY: Well, it's very miraculous okay. Normally, I don't even study. In fact, I don't even know how to lor. I never studied before lor. All mostly last-minute revision. So this time, being able to really study gives me a sense of satisfaction. Besides, I completed one theme. Two more themes to go! I think I do this everyday la. Study at least few chapters from diff subjects, so I can cover all bases before the Os.   C: Hmm.....at least you are planning well. But remember, less time on games. In fact, try not to play them at all. Later you get distracted and waste time playing games. Take breaks can la. Go walk around, take something to eat la....    just try not to play games. Leave relaxation at night, okay? I am your conscience after all. I am rebuking you (or    rather, you are rebuking yourself). Must wake up!! Cannot lose valuable time!  KY: Yes yes, I know! So addictive, the games. Oh yeah... lets not talk about studying. So sian that topic! So many people went to school you know! I am like very extra like that. What to do? Parents want to bring me see doctor. And I said yesterday, don't like being tied down.  C: Oh! You know, you had your conversation with CQ just know hor. I know you feel very angry now.  KY: HA! I detest Lai Yit Hann!   C: Detest? Surely it's not that serious. You are just tired of the 'bullying' and wish it would stop, right?  KY: Yeah...which normal cat won't feel angry you tell me? He keeps telling everyone I am gay you know! Spread to the world world every opportunity he got. I really want Piper's power and blow him right there and then. It's getting really old now, that joke. He wants to rest of the world to see I am a gay then he would stop right? I am NOT a gay lor! How many times must I put that idea across? I wish it would stop! I WISH IT WOULD STOP!  C: You know it won't. Bullying never stops. Wendy's right you know. It's hard to stop bullying people once you get started. It can stop, but not unless one party is hurt majorly.  KY: Ya know, I feel like blowing up in his face. I know it won't work, but I really want to do that. How can I let him see that he is being very overboard? It's not my fault if I sit the way I sit, or place my hands the way I place. It's me...I have been doing this for god-knows-when. I don't even do it deliberately! Just natural....ya know. How can he be so superficial and judge people by their cover?   C: Of course I do. I am your conscience. Being your conscience, you know I will huant you if you actually do anything to Hann. You still treat him as your friend, you know, despite the constant 'bullying' and your threatenings to vanquish him.   KY: I am very tired of this lor. I wish it would stop....So depressing the topic!  C: Then don't talk about it now la. Okay...I wanna hear your views on Bio Prac.   KY: Me? I didn't really revise la. Just you know, flip through and tried drawing. All I did yesterday at Wendy's house are revision to me. Hmm...I somehow feel it's not enough to let me pass....just have this insecurity in me.  However, I do feel confident...I am such a strange person.  C: you are just one confused cat. I know you can do it, KY! Just revise again tomorrow. You will be fine la. Go for it!  KY: Thanks! Okay, you know what? I think I stop talking to myself le. So...weird! Ha! I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow meow!! It's Sun-meow-day!  Hmmm..I woke up at 8.30. After bathing, I watched TV lor. Yeah. I always find it very rushing on Sunday. I always read the Sunday Times...read almost the whole paper (except classified), after which read The New Paper on Sunday. I have to complete reading before 11. HaHa!   Then, at 11, I did the same old thing of alternating between watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge and surfing the Net. Ha! I finally settled down to watch Huan Zhu Ge Ge at 12.45, whenh I eat my lunch. Ji called and ask about SS. Me-ow meow!  I went to Wendy's house to study for my Bio Prac. I wore a new shirt there....those sports shirt with extra long sleeve until the elbow. Mother brought for Brother some time back when she brought bed-sheets in John Little. He didn't want, so I took it. Wendy said I looked quite nice. She also thought that shirt was a hand-me-down. No la where got! We studied for about two hours or so, then we chatted. Chatted about chalet ar, about so many other things (which means confidential info). After that, me and Wendy made instant noodles for ourselves. Woah! I sweated so much. HaHa! Then, I watched Rainbow Brite the movie with Wendy. What a cute cartoon! Loved the story. HaHa!! After that, went back into the room to talk some more la.  I ate dinner (chicken rice) with them in 888. Yvonne reportedly saw me with Wendy whilst walking out of the food court! HaHa! Cool! After that went home and came online lor.   Ayiah! Tomorrow a lot of people go back to shcool you know! I am the only one that's not going. Ayiah. I feel very happy you know. Finally leh. can get break from school. From attending school lessons. I felt free. And now by going back, I am being tied back down again. So...restrictive. I hate it. HMM!  Okay! I am very vexed at messenger! Darn them! I think I go liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! What an eventful day!   Today, we went to Pioneer Junior College to tour their Open House. Meow meow! I met Gloria and HuiLing at 8.30+ and we went to meet SL, CQ, ChaoJian, ChinKang, Hann, PeiYing, WQ and Joyce. Meow meow!! We took the MRT to CCK station. Oh yes, I read Today's newspaper in the train.  We took some bus there. We alighted at some stop, and while approaching the school, we were like very scared. We see that we are the only ones that arrived this early (9.45am). Then, we saw the reception. We just stood around there looking like dummies. Then, someone called us over, and offered us goodie bags. Nobody dared to take, and they push me towards the tables lor. so, I took the goodie bag and everyone followed suit. Meow meow!! We then walked and walked....we went into a tutorial classroom...quite cool. It was a GP classroom. I spotted some worksheets and stole them to let everyone see. They were very shocked at the difficulty of it. HaHa!   We went up to the hall (The Althing). There were various CCA booths there. There, we met many Riversidians. HaHa! Woah! Riverside in full-force ar! Then, a council member took us around to tour PJC. His name was Sheng Qiang. We toured the hall, then the canteen booths. Many booths were quite fun, actually. I don't agree with the rugby booth. So violent, the game! And the players actually enjoy being violent. Oh my. Most of the booths were nice. Yep! After touring, SQ persuaded us to take part in thw quiz. We can win a moutain bike if our ticket was chosen. And hahaha. The photographer keep shooting us. PeiYing tried to avoid him, but was "caught" in the end. HaHa!! I will look out for our photos in the website, I think.   After filling in our forms, we went to the art society to go into the "Huanted Room". Ticket entrance was 50 cents. Ayiah...never mind la. After that, we walked around to wait for the queue. Then, we came back again. Me, Amanda, PY, Clar and Ping joined went in first. Woah! The room was not so scary. HaHa!! Seriously. We kept laughing and laughing. The entire room was dark. There were people lining up along the sides, touching us, giving the "creepy" feeling. So meowful! Then, I saw a female posting like a sadako thingy. Quite realistic wor! Long long hair in a white robe, sitting behind incense and stuff, with red crepe paper hanging down from the ceiling. Quite real leh! HaHa! After that, we came out. Amanda said it was so funny. Then, we waited for the rest to finish their tour and go for their turn (they didn't spot us...sigh!! lousy la! We were at the study area....they looked in our direction, but didn't see us. HaHA!). After everyone completed the huanted house thingy, they were laughing away. Hann even wanted to go back again to throw coins at the people. We are so bad! HAHA!   After that, we waited for about an hour to see the lucky draw. Meow meow!! At the lucky draw, woah!! Everybody was waiting to see the prize. The consolation prize was a football signed by the principal. Give me also dun wnat....no interest in football whatsoever! HaHA! Then, the number was mountain bike was drawn. It was 087. Ay-err! Mine was 256. BUT BUT!! WQ won the bike! Oh my god! I can't believe he's so lucky! HaHa!! How meowful! Woah!! And SQ was so happy about it. After all, he persuaded us to join! :) WQ had to call his Dad to bring him and his bike home. HaHa! Then, we went to Lot 1 to have lunch (I ate mian fen guo). Then, I went to Wendy's house with intention to study Bio.  HaHa! I found that I have no mood to study after all. I was too excited about PJC after all. Woah! HaHa! Tomorrow study lor. I bathed Lassie today! Wee! So fun! HaHa! I got wet...and it's so ticklish when Lassie shaked her body and sprayed droplets all over me. HaHa! We then blow dry her and combed her hair. Such a cute Lassie dog! And oh, Wendy said it's up to me and my father to pay money for the chalet. Sh'll be giving me the $300+ plus tomorrow! Woah! Such a big responsibility. HaHa! Wendy's mother hinted that the beach near the chalet is huanted. Hmmm....how interesting. AFter bathing Lassie, me and Wendy played the PS. Then she went out to eat lunch and I went home.  Yep! I think that's all for today. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Today's graduation day! How meowful!  Firstly, we attened our last E-Maths class. An enriching one, I must say. We learnt stem-and-leaf diagrams and interests (simple and compound). After that eventful lesson, we went to the hall to celebrate our graduation.  Wee! It's quite fun you know! The teachers are really caring...they planned all these for us! Meow meow! I loved it most when Janet read out the thanks to teachers. It's touching. Uhm-hmm! The teachers from YJC came too. You can say I am quite tempted to join YJC. They offer flexible subject combinations. YaY! I need not be tied down by C-Maths. Meow meow! I am so considering. Note that this is so different from PSLE  After the celebration, we went to eat buffet. Buffet was okay...but everything was so spicy...so hot hot hot! After that, we rushed up to take the SS Mock Exam. Can see that Mrs Jail was dissappointed at the low attendance. I was there. I didn't dissappoint her. The mock exam was quite easy.....yep!! Meow meow! After that, went down to meet Ah Ji...he waited for us! How meowful! Then, I went home with Gloria and CQ.   Hmmm....today leh, Wendy gave me my graduation present from her. She told me that she gave me the last, coz she knew I would open it when I get it. However, surprisingly, I didn't. HaHa! Maybe because this is a very private letter and I don't want people at the back looking at what shouldn't be looked at (:P! I value my privacy, ya know). So, I waited till reaching home to open. Then, upon reaching home, I did NOT open the present. Surpirsing, isn't it? The curious cat supressed his curiosity. HaHa....I want to read the letter in front of Wendy tomorrow ma. Want her to see my reaction. But leh, she insisted on me NOT doing it that way. So, respecting her wishes (ayiah...she feels embarassed ma... :P), I read the letter. And you know what? The letter is the sweetest thing a friend ever did to me. :) Seriously! I appreciate your letter a lot, Wendy! Rest assured that I would treasure it forever (you know...would like to keep your card in my treasure box...but it's too small! haha!). I am NOT gonna lose the letter. Noperino! :) And you know what, Wendy? Friends forever too. :D  Alright! I gotta go sleep le. Gotta wake up quite early. We are going to PJC's Open House tomorrow. Meow meow!! See ya tomorrow, blog!

      Heya! Sorry for not writing ya! Charmed and all. By the way, Y Tu Mummy Tabien was great. Sisterly love. I still don't understand the part on how Piper can expel out Isis's soul (oh wait...now I do...I read the script).   Yesterday was the Combined Science Practical. Meow meow! Overall, it was quite easy. Yeah ha. I was so worrying I don't have enough time. But in the end, I do la. I remembered to bring my I/C and Entry Proof, so lucky no troubles. I was posted to Bio Lab 1, same seating arrangement ask before. The Physics paper was quite easy, testing for density of the liquid. Meow meow! I completed that within 30 minutes. I moved on to Chemistry. Woah! Kinda easy man! I tested everything correctly. Ammonium Sulphate's the compound I tested for. Wee-hee! I felt good in the end. Woo-hoo!  After Prac, we were quarantined in class till 1.30. Mrs Chua gave us some biscuit, but it got lost along the way (I suspect the boys' greediness have something to do with this). So, we stayed hungry till 1.30, where all of us rushed down to eat something! Woah! Today Hann very funny leh. He pretened to be a spy catching thieves (oh! the school was robbed today...canteen and bookshop...poor things!). so basically, he tried to hide behind the door and scare anyone who walks in. HaHaHa!! Everybody saw him through the window and just like look at him. So funny man!! HAHAHA! I laughed really hard when he was 'caught'. Everybody did too! He fianlly 'caught' someone...AiLian. HaHa! He shouted at AiLian! So meow meow funny. The E-Maths mock was very okay. Felt so happy doing the paper.   Moving onto today. Woah! Today was fun-filled with activities! First, the school gave us a talk on graduation day. Gonna look forward to it tomorrow! Then. Miss Govind gave us a talk on the carnival next year. I am so gonna return to have fun and play along! Then, we went for PE and all. Good game of b-ball, I must say. Last PE lesson le. Then, we went up for Chem. Mrs Tan came to visit us. She talked about going to JC and our L1R5. Me-ow meow!   After recess, we have English. The Band 1 did their English mock exam first. Thong is on course, and she's having lessons during the afternoon. Me and Siva just discussed along our writing. I wrote on "What artistic talent would you like to possess and why?". I wrote about the talent to play piano pieces wonderfully. HeHe! In the library, Yit Hann snatched my Paper 1 away from me. Talk about integrity! Who used to chide me for having no integrity? And what lame excuses! Temptation my foot! If you have integrity, you won't give in to your temptations. This is an obvious case of qi ren tai sheng. Sigh.....now he has an unfair advantage. I don't really care about the advantage part la (Anyone can easily win him! HA!). It's just the inegrity bit. What right does he have to say that I have no integrity, when he himself has none in the first place? Sigh....  Today, I was given the opportunity to write in Sonia'a autograph book. Wee! I wrote my message to her. I decorated quite a fair bit too (don't laugh ar! I can decorate, hor?). WQ is so negative. He keeps critisizing my entry (when all I did was point out his mistake. Writing "Anyway" as "Anywhere"!), saying things like "Oh! You smudged the ink. Serves your right!" Hey! This reminds me of Honeyz's End Of The Line.   Seems like I can't do you right. All I do or say is wrong. All the smallest thing critisised. I deserve some damn respect. Nothing more and nothing less.   He's like the Tian DaHua. Keep yakking and yakking, complaining and complaining and blaming and blaming, and none of his words are nice to listen to. Sheez. Some people. Oh! Speaking of Tian DaHua! He got divorced by LingLing! YaY!! Good for LingLing! I whole-heartedly support her decision! This is a warning to all those "Tian DaHua"s out there. Better keep your mouth shut when you want to say something negative. Better be more open-hearted and accept criticism. Better STOP critisizing now, or else it's too late to eat your words.  Well, we went through guided writing types during EL lesson today. After that, we did the Part 2 (after grumbles..sheez!). We ended at 4 something. I stayed back with XC to wait for him to go music room to meet Low for awhile.   Today leh, Wendy kinda experienced a breakdown. It's too tiring to organize a big event like chalet, I guess.Well, I made her happy over nothing, over a misunderstanding of my father's NTUC Link Card. Sigh....She gave up planning for chalet! That's...not good! She's been having this dream since this year....she can't give up like this! Yes, Wendy! I know it's tiring. It's damn tiring. But do you really want to give it up just like that? Only after experiencing a minor setback? We can always pay the non-discounted rates. Your dream, Wendy! Your friends' dreams too. I want to go to chalet to enjoy myself with my friends around me. Like you, Amanda, Hann...Pick yourself up. Try again. And again. Never say die, alright?  Alright. I think I end here liao la. Very very tired le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! What a meowing day!   Today leh, nothing much happened la. HaHa! I always say nothing much, ends up got a lot of things to say. But really. Today is just so-and-so. Just feeling a tweensy-bit of nervousness for my Science Practical.  Ayiah...I know what to talk about le. Plain laziness. I hate people who are plain lazy! Like getting up to put your own plates or taking your own calculator will kill you. Yes. Those kind of lazy people. And it's even worse when they don't even want to help you back. Yeah. You've been helping them carry plates, calcuate stuff, throw rubbish...but they refuse to help you throw a single wad of tissue (come on! How many wads of tissue have I thrown for them?). Those people are bai lei (incorrigible?). I can predict that they are not gonna be good bosses (ordering secretaries around....making use of them...how despicable) or colleagues. Alright...I don't know why I am using "then". It should be "him". He doesn't want to waste calculator batteries, so he used CQ's or anyone else. He's too lazy to copy out emals adds on his own, so he made me type for him. He's too lazy to even get his useless butt up the seat and put back plates/throw rubbish/just about anything. He's using everyone to convinient himself. He doesn't care about people's feelings. Why should they be even doing this for him, you tell me? If he is too lazy to do things, then it's his problem. Why should we qian jiu him? We are spoiling him! We are doing him harm! And frankly speaking, I don't know how much I can stand anymore. Yes! Maybe I am still sore at his refusal to help me throw that tissue. I am finding it very un-worthwhile to do things for him. You may chide me for expecting things in return (unconditional love and all), but I find it plain disgusting of being made used at. I can't bear to see my friends being made used of. I am so afraid I am gonna blow someday. But I can't blow. I just repaired this friendship. Ain't gonna be so silly to end this. Must tolerate. ...   Hmm...what else to say ar? Ahh...Mrs Tan didn't come again. Sigh... wonder when's she's really coming. It's making me and Hann nervous. HaHa! I alos dunnoe what am I nervous about. Sigh....Oh yeah! Mrs Chua gave us small little cards wishing us good luck for our Os. That's really sweet of her! Thanks Mrs Chua!   Oh yes! I remembered something! I am going to chalet after all. Yesterday night, me and Wendy have our heart-to-heart talk (hmm....) about chalet. I fully understands how she felt about chalet and how important it is for her to have her friends there. She knew the reaons why I choose not to go chalet, and the guilt I went through because I dissappointed her. In the end, I decided to do. For the sake of our friendship. For the sake of making her happy. For the sake of having fun with my friends before we move on to the next chapter with our lives. I couldn't possibly deny myself of this chance of going just because of two idiots. Hm.So, confirmed le. I am going! Wee!  Alright, you know what? I gotta log off le. Sleep early and all. So, see ya tomorrow with news (or not...tomorrow's Wednesday). Night blog.

      Heya! Sorry for not updating yesterrday. I went out thw whole day lor...so no time! HaHa!  Hmmm....before we went shopping, we went to my grandmom's place to visit her. You know, those visits to see how grandmum is doing. Yeah. She's doing okay. Great! But my eldest uncle...sigh. Suffering from throat and lung cancer. Smoked cigarettes and drank beer too much la. See him like this also dunnoe what to say. See his X-rays...the lungs all blackened out. Sigh...  Alright, we went to Chinatown in the afternoon. Hmm? Wbhat we do there? We ate lunch lor. I ate the yong tau foo ar. Very famous one, that stall. The whole family ate that lor. Not bad la. After that leh, we went to shop at various shops lor. Like OG, some shop (which I forgot it's name) and various small shops around Chinatown. I brought two t-shirts and a shirts. Yay! Wardrobe expanded le. HaHa! Anyway, we ate again (sigh! brother la! want to eat the chicken noodles). Then, we went home to take a rest before going to eat dinner.   I played games until like 7. HaHa! We originally planned to eat seafood at restuarants near East Coast, but due to the late time, we decided to go to the restuarant at Toa Payoh. But sigh!! It was booked for a wedding dinner! I grumbled on the way out "I told you to go East Coast you don't want...see la...come here nothing to eat!". The people outside the restuarant (the parents lor) all looked at me with distaste. In the end, we ended up eating at KFC (Family Combo Meal). Mom and Dad promised another outing to eat at seafood restuarant....so yay (see WQ! What no money! YOU then no money!)! AFter that, we walked around Toa Payoh.  After that leh, we went to Causeway Point to buy water-bottles. Ayaih...no use one la, trying to protest about it. So,I chose a nice one. Hey! If I have to drink from a bottle, it has to be nice! Meow meow meow!  Today leh...nothing much happened la. The History test is somewhat difficult. Sigh!!Don't even know whether my highest levels correct or not. Sigh. Oh yeah. Today, Andi came to talk to me about going to chalet. He feels guilty about inviting Faiz along, which caused me and CQ not to go to chalet. So, he persuaded me to go to chalet. I didn't in the end. It's not Andi's fault lor. If that leech Faiz wants to tag along Andi, then it's not within Andi's control. So, Andi should not reproach himself for the presence of Faiz. I can see that he's a very loyal friend of Wendy. That's very good you know!   Okay. I gotta end this le. So late. Will update tomorrow. See ya tomorrow, blog. Nite!

      Hey hey! It's a meow meow Saturday!  Hmm. Today not much happened. I decided not to bore you with boring details about my morning, so let's just skip to afternoon.  Today afternoon, I went to Wendy's house to complete my English homework. I took about 5 hours to complete my Paper 1. HaHa! Keep getting distracted. I talked to Wendy lor. Talk talk talk. Even I scolded Lassie today for licking my legs. Aww...Poor Lassie dog. But don't lick my legs ar! After completing my compo, I watched them (she and her mother) eat noodle soup. Then, I watched her mom play a PS game. Puzzle Bubble or something. I went home at 6.  Uncle Steven came yet again. He upgraded my RAM (to 228) and changed my mouse to an optical wheel mouse! YaY! No more rollers-cleaning. I bathed and watched TV (No need to tell you what they are...you should know by now, hor?) while eating. Then, I came online lor.  So today nothing much la. Tomorrow is wheen the fun begins. We (the whole family) is going to Chinatown to shop. And possibly eat at a seafood restuarant. So exciting. Hmmm....shark's fin! Alright! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Heya! I am back.  You see ar. I said I would elaborate on something. Well. I was terribly upset yesterday that I cannot get into the JC Science Stream. You see, all Science Stream classes needs C-Maths. And the requirements for C-Maths is either a pass for A-Maths, or a distinction in E-Maths and B3 or above for Combined Science. I fulfil neither requirements. Sigh. I was so upset my dreams are dashed. I really hate myself that time. I even thought of suicide, but quickly dahsed the idea from my mind and chiding myself for being crazy. Hann today told me we can take AO-Maths with Chem and Bio! I hope so.....  Erm...today not much happened la. We had about 3 hours of A-Maths with Radha today (6 periods!). He organized extra a-maths class after school for those who need help. We stayed back of course. PeiYing came ('new admission'..Radha called her that...and keep asking if she know how to do problems). I kinda had fun solving the problems. Quite easy ma.....hahaha. Yeah. I am confident about my surds, log and indices le. Meow!!  After that, WQ, me, CQ, Hann and SL went to Civic Centre to study. Well, let me share something with you first. We were teasing WQ about his tendency to cover his ears whenever someone gets too loud. So funny you know. Who would do that one? We were tasing him with things like "protect your ears for what? want to hear yan lor wan's (king of hades) judegement properly ar?" and Hann keep imitating him....hahaha!! Me and CQ keep laughing and laughing. After that, we went to Civic's Centre MacDonalds to study. All fo them did Maths, while I tried to complete my Compre homework. The summary stumped me. I am thinking more abou it tomorrow la.   You know. Wendy made me realize that I have to study to fight for what I want. I want great results at Os, so I can go to the courses I want at JC. I need to plan. I need to start revision now. I think I am planning tomorrow at Wendy's house. Yep. I seriously need to study lor.  I am logging off le. Survivor's gonna show soon. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow, blog! Night.

      Heya! Sorry for not writing yesterday, but here was limited time because of Charmed. oh by the way, a very good episode yesterday. Paige reunited with her Dad! Woo-hoo!  Okay...yesterday was quite a boring day la. Nothing much happened. We stayed back to wait for SL, Janet and all for Bio. After that, we talked to Mrs Chua lor. She told us about O Level papers (how it is much easier than prelim's. The teachers set a more difficult paper for prelims...about 1-2 grade higher. Espeically so for Miss Tan, who sets about 3-4 grades higher). She also told us about JCs (She's from St Andrews JC. Cool!) and all. Meow!!  Well. Today's exciting. Kinda. But first, I wanna narrate something. You see, there's this whole list being passed around. This list is asking us whether we want to go chalet or not. I put not sure at first. Everybody did. And I talked to CQ you know. About how upset Wendy's gonna feel if she sees the whole list being ticked with "Not Sure"s. I almost wanted to put "Yes", but I have to see circumstances. Then, the list came back. The "Not Sure" column has been erased and everyone have to make a choice. I saw the list. CQ is not going. Okay...... Then, I saw the two most unfavourable people in the whole wide world ticking "yes" (namely, Faiz and Kim Hock.) I decided not to go in the end. Why? CQ and most of my friends are not going. And what adds salt to injury is that those two are. I got totally no one to hang around with (well, I got Wendy and Amanda....but KH is friendly with them....pah). I would rather coop myself at home then be insulted/bullied there (I got PLENTY of experiences, thank you very much). But also, I felt very guilty. I am letting Wendy down. After all, she shared her excitement and plans with me, and I was like very happy along with her. Then suddenly, I decided not to go. I owed Wendy a lot, in that sense. That expains my guiltiness. Wendy said she don't cared if I don't go. That stroke a chord in my heart. Don't care....that kinda hurts, you know. Yes. I would go to chalet, provided the two doesn't go. Being idiotic, aren't I? ...  Hm. I got back my EL grades!! It's a B4 overall! I improved in my Paper 1, scoring about 40 out 60! Woo-hoo! So, my total L1R5 would be 16! Ah Ji passed his EL! YaY!! Congrats to him! So, he got a socre of 16 too! YaY!! Good for us! Meow meow. Something idiotic happened today. It has something to do with YitHann. Yeah. You guessed it. He's being totally sucky today. Probably from getting C6 for his EL. As usual, I was the punching bag (not only that, a kicking bag too). I can't stand him! So what if he got a C6? Does it mean he have to chu qi on a person who got B4 (he was blaming XC for getting A2! HELLO! XC has every rights to get an A. So does Siva, for that matter!)? No! There's no use blaming others for being cleverer. He have only himself to blame for his own results. Such people!  Okay...I think that's it la. I don't want to say anymore things. I will elaborate further tomorrow. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.

      Hmmm...Even today was meowingly average-y.  Okay. Today nothing much happened la. We got lessons and all. I enjoyed myself during PE, yeah. Meow meow! My b-ball skills improved. I am not THAT much of a kultz anymore. Meow!!  Okay. The exciting thing happened duiring History. Now THAT exciting if you come to think about it. First, we found out that LiangSiang/LiPeng got 93 overall for Combined Humanities. Me and CQ realised that there;s no way of winning them liao. Sigh!! Okay. I was utterly shcoked you know. I got....35 for History! Just  barely got an A2. I am not happy lor. My source-based got 14...luckily my structured essay saved moi! But!! But!! Overall, I got 80! YaY!!! I am so glad I improved! And CQ got an A1! Good for him! YaY!!!    CQ and I decided to pull a little trick on those friends of mine ar. You see ar. They would rather much prefer I get a low mark for History (very evil leh!).So, even if I tell them I got A1 for my Humane, I will be treated indifferently. So, I suggested that CQ tell them I got 29, missing my A1 by 1 mark. I know they will most readily believe that anyway.  So, when returning to class, I tried to act as angry and as sad as possible. I shouted at SH and put that chou nian. Acutally hor, I was trying SO hard not to laugh you know. Woah! YH and WQ was so happy. So evil!! I see their true colours liao ar! I couldn't take it anymore. I ran to Wendy and started laughing and laughing and telling her what I was doing. HaHaHa! In order to keep up with my crankiness, I told WQ "What la! worry about EL? Sure fail one la you! I cna't even get an A1 for Humane, you surely won't pass EL one!". Being as revengeful as always, he started insulting me to CQ (must accept the truth ma! :P). CQ, who cannot stand the nagging and the backstabbing, decided to tell them the truth. Ai-yer. Not fun one (No la where got, CQ hor?). Meow meow!  Hm. Ayiah. Nothing much went on la. I got no mood to write now, due to me exchaging sarcasm with the  SUPER, BEGIGN, BENEVOLENT, ALL-POWERFUL GOD-LIKE  class administrator. Hm. If you can't comprehend what the italics tell you, you can always ask me for explanations. So, see ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.

      Today's Monday Monday. Both bad and good things happened today.  Alright. Let's talk about the bad thing first and get it over with. I GOT B3 FOR COMBINED SCIENCE! B3! WHAT THE *TOOT* *TOOT* *TOOT*! I never gotten such a low grade for Combined Science! And I am getting this at Prelims. Mid-year getting this, fine, not so bad! BUT THIS IS THE PRELIMS! Now, how am I supposed to got to the Chemistry course, you tell me? JCs (biasness! how could the education system! lousy!) absolutely despise Combined Science students! I can never stand a chance against Pure Science students if I only get a B3. My whole life is ruined. THERE GOES JC! And it's all my fault. I am angry at myself. For not studying Physics fully. For thinking that with Chem, I can ace Combined Science. Obviously, this is not the case. For being complacent. For being such a worthless *toot* (Actually, I shouldn't be degrading myself. But I want to get everything off my chest, okay?). Right now, I should focus on building up my Physics skills. And I brought a Science TYS too. You know, I am tempted to scold the teachers responsible for placing me in Combined Science (I can fare better in Pure Chem). But one of them may be Mrs Chua or any of my favourite teachers....so I shan't say anything. But all I know is that I am gonna work hard for the grades I DESERVE to have. Not this lousy worthless B3. A2 is so little. I DESERVE an A1! A1!!!! You hear me? A1!  Another bad news: I got 25/50 for my EL paper 2. Sigh. I shan't talk about it much. I just want to make a note that Miss Mala is totally contradicting Mrs Thong. Mrs Thong taught us that "explain fully" question is a inferential question. So, almost all of us Band 1 inferred. And was marked wrong by Mala. Not to say her leh, but Mala should consult with Mrs Thong! After all, Mrs Thong set this paper. And Miss Mala scolded us Band 1. Hello! She have no rights to tell us (no no...not tell. SCREAMED!) not to be complacent. How would she know we are being complacent?! Only Mrs Thong, who know us well, can tell us that! Well, we cannot say Mala is biased, because she screamed at her class also. But we felt so wrongfully accursed. Me, XC, Siva and probably lots more. Anti-Mala feelings are high in Band 1. What a *toot* (no offense to my band 3 friends. But I need to get this off my chest. And this is my personal thinking. I have my rights to think what I want to think, and not to like some teacher because you do. So, don't you ever start condemning me for what I said).  Al;right. Moving on from bad news. I got two pieces of good news to share. And they brighten up me day. :D. First stop. I got an A2 for Bio! YaY! I maintained my standard (or what Mrs Chua said...remained staus quo). Hmm! I believe I can get a distinction for Bio too.  The second piece of good news! I got....45/50 for SS! WOO-HOO! I am so proud of myself! Never in my life...have I reached so high! I am so proud of my work! My structured-essays! My source-based! Ahh! I love my work! That means, I already passed Ciombined Humanities (hello...so easy to get 5 marks). The matter now is to get A1 or not. To get A1, I need a minimum of 30. My usual standard for Histopry is around 37 and above. And Hist is almost similar to SS. If I can get 45 for SS, I am sure to get A1 for History. Well, not really sure. Let's see how things turn out, okay? Cannot be too complacent (this word makes me think of some  person  here!) ar.  Alright. I went home at 3.30. Took a bath. Went down to buy assessment books. Then, I played FFIX. FFIX Update: I leveled my characters roughly to about 2-3 levels. Fighting Grand Dragons all the time is boring. Yep! Meow meow!   At 7, Holland V started. 2 years have passed. The starting 'movie' changed. I saw XiaoXin coming back, and XX and JJ got intimate. Such a plot twist! I saw TianYang and RouRou being more intimate too. Maybe they will get together? Who knows? One of the most noticeable changes is that LingLing matured and became more refined. I like that change, actually. Being the head of the family (replacing WanWan, who is coming back 3 months later) actually matured her. That's very good. Yang Xiong became closer to the Mo family. Good thing also. I can't wait for more surprises!   Okay...then watched Comedy Nite...and came online. Tomorrow's gonna be exciting, for I am anticipating my History results. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Sunday! A day to laze around in boredom.  I woke up at 8.30 and bathed till 8.50. I read the New Sunday Times. Got a lot of insight on a number of things, like teenagers suiciding and the conclusion for the Andrea suit (oh...she won 900k, but the case against TaiMing was dismissed! YaY!). Mother came back with breakfast (chee cheong fun). We watched TV and read newspaper till 11.  At 11, I alternated between watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge and chatting online with XC and WQ. So meowingly confusing. At 12.30, I went offline to eat lunch and watch Huan Zhu. And yaY! Good news! Courts approved us to buy the copier! YaY!! Meow meow! We will be picking it up tomorrow.   After that, wendt online a little and did a thourogh sweep of my system using McAfee virus scan. Then, I went offline to play FFIX. Alright! FFIX update! I managed to beat the Grand Dragon. Just user Flare a couple of times and some Blizzaraga here and there should do the trick. It sucks to have him use Thundaga on the whole party...but oh well. I managed to level up 5 levels, then I off to surdf the net.  Oh god! I slept from 5 to 6.30. I slept and slept...gosh! I was really tired. I woke up at 6.30 with a horrifying feeling. I didn't buy dinner for me and brother!! Darn you know!! I walked to the 768 feeling so tired. And I decided not to buy any dinner for myself. Go eat the bowl noodles at home. Too lazy to eat a "fulling" dinner. I even brought the wrong dinner for brother. HaHa.   Came back home, bathed, cooked noodles and ate them while surfing internet. Ayiah...pretty common stuff la.I think I end this le. Too tired to type le. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.

      Heya! Today's a meowing day!  Okasy, I woek up at 8.30 and bathed. Then, I went online. Yadda Yadda Yadda. At 9.30 opr so, Mom came back with breakfast. No, it's not chai tao kueh if you asked. It's the carrot caske in blocks. HaHa!   At 10, I read the newspaper out of boredom. And I saw this Court sale. Woah! $5 for a portable radio! YaY! I finally can get a small radio, for a cheap price too! I called WQ to come over accompany me. Later I accompany him lor to wait for his friend Alan. Meow meow!  By the time I got there, the queue was very very long! Snaking from Courts right up to the place where Evergreen bokshop is. Oh my! I got worried le. Because that radio is only available for 50 customers. Seeing such long queues gave me no hope le. But I queued anyway. WQ came later. He keep telling me to stop queueing, because there's no hope. I told him I won't give up. Then, at 11.06, I started having doubts. We only moved 10ms or so. Sigh. I think my radio sold out le. Then, I broke away from the queue! I gave up! So embarrassing you know! Everyone staring at me!!!   WQ and I went to wait outside the library. We plonked down on the floor and started talking. Talking about wu liao things like SL la, Kim Hock la....blah blah blah. XC smsed me, I message back. Woah! Wasted so many messages. Meow!   At 12, the library opened its big doors. And everybody rushed in man! Woah! Like wild animals stampeding. Seriously. Got noise (Chong!!) some more. I think the lbirarians are mortified. I quickly rushed up to get a table for us.   At the library, I borrowed Chicken Soup For The Teenage Souls III. It's back for more heat-warming stories! I love Chicken Soup! Between 12.30 to 1.45, whatI did was read the book, chatted with WQ and helped him with some Intergration problems. At 1.45, Alan came (He looked quite good ma....dunnoe why WQ said he's not good-looking! HaHa!) and I left for Wendy's house.  When I came in, Wendy was frying eggs. Meow meow! Later, somehow, I got her to cook Maggie for me (I didn't have lunch ma). Felt kinda guilty, but.....sigh! After that, we ate noodles and eggs while watching Final Fantasy the movie. So exciting that movie! I loved it you know. So touching, the story. Neal died, and the woman gave up shooting and died along with him. I think she likes him. Then, another guy died. In the end, Gray sacrifice himself to spread the "cure". So touching! So brave! The ending's kinda sad, but beautiful. Sunshine and warmth return to the Earth again. Ahh......  I managed to complete my EL homework while watching the movie. After watching the touching movie, both of us played Chocobo Racing. We kept beign disruptyed by Wendy's mother walking here and there. HaHa. She's fixing the curtains. We play 2 rounds, I think. The last one we are tied and have to play the tie-breaker game. I won I won! Meow!  Okay. Coming back home, I immediately switched on the computer. YaY! So many things updated. New virus software, new scanner and a new CD-RW drive! So many meowing things! After that, I bathed and ate dinner while watching 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Daughter and Simpsons.   Then, I came online. I used 2 discs to write my Charmed vids. Meow!! Then, I chatted with XC, WQ and Wendy. Then somehow, in oue chat, Wendy and I started to duet using poems. HaHaHa! So funny!  Alright. I shall present you our poem!     Duet    Head spinning as words of your letter flow out,   Go take a rest, I gently shout.   No thanks, I have work to do, for graduation draws nearer and I have work unfinished,   I warn cautiously: Your headache's not going to be diminished.   I will, for I'll take a rest after I finish one last letter, address to the person whose name I fear of hearing,   Oh my! That's terrible for your well-being!   Though this is terrible, I have no choice, I can hardly fall asleep with work undone,   Doing work like this won't be fun.   It will, with a positive attitude, with a motive in mind,   If you say so, with this I am fine.   Thanks my friend, for showing your concern to a sick being like me,   You are welcome, very blessed be.   So what are you doing now, my friend? What's occupying the friend of mine currently?   Oh, just blogging and chatting and the dilly-dallies.   Then it's time for me to take my leave, for I wouldn't want to distract you in whatever you are doing,   Nonsensical ramblings you give, so I return to my busying.    Fine, my concern for you falls on deaf ears. I'll leave you alone as you wish,   Would you like a fish?   HaHa! I love it! I hope we cna do more of this in the future! Alirght. Time for me to go. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog!

      Friday Friday Friday. Disappointing Friday.  Firstly, I failed my Maths. WITH A PATHETIC 6 MARKS TO PASS! Even PeiYing can squeeze 6 marks out of her paper! WHY CAN'T I? This is a mockery made out of me! I feel so disgraced! How am I gonna face my tuition teacher, you tell me? Sigh.  One good thing though. I passed my English. Confirmed le, by Mrs Thong! Good good. She scared me today by saying "Only 1 person in Band 1 failed". I thought I am doomed. Not really. I dunnoe lor. I feel I wouldn't fail, because my English ain't weak. But I got scared la. Siva said I should pass, because I am not lousy. I am hoping I would improve to a B. Mrs Thong said everyone improved...so I wished I would get a B4. B3 is the most ideal of coursze. And yes, Siva got the top, again! Whoo-hoo! Way to go girl!  Then, after school, CQ and I stayed back to wait for Gloria. Ayiah, in the end, she went to the library. Sigh. Me, CQ and WQ walked back home. Yes yes CQ. I am gonna talk about it now, okay? Happy? I felt happy la. Well, we are talking and chit-chatting away happily. Hmm. CQ (you!) told me just now that I must cherish this friendship. Well, I definitely will! Don't worry. I won't get heated up again. I will try to control my temper.....(ren yi shi feng ping lang qing, tui yi pu hai lang tian kong) I feel too happy even to quarrel with him anyway. So, thanks CQ! For sticking by my side these days.  After I came back, I bathed and then watched the District. Child-abuse case is being shown. Oh my!! Horrible horrible parents. After watching District, I played FFIX. Okay, FFIX update. I found out where Quan's Dwelling is. I got most of the cracks and bubbles treasure (except for the on in Disc 4) and tried to complete the Stellazizzo colelction. Well, only left certain things (which I can only get if I advance the story).   Today's Holland V is rather sad. XiaoHui got killed (I screamed out loud!!) by the idiot and YanYan was caught, but was not repentant. And most horrifying of all, RouRou got raped by damned despicable TianCheng. Oh!! I hate him! He should be better off locked up in a mental hospital indefinitely.   I am now very angry. Very very agnry. At my damn modem. Stupid leh! Now, it refusesd to connect to the internet. But this can be solved by rebooting the computer. AND THAT'S A WASTE OF MY TIME! Do you know how many minutes is wasted? 2 FREAKING MINUTES! Everytime I try to go online! 2 MINUTES OF MY LIFE IS WASTED! This used to be a rare moment thingy, but it became a daily affair.   I am so darn pissed. Okay. I ending here liao. See ya later. Night blog!

      Today we got back our Chem results! Woo-hoo!  A-ha! By my 'Woo-hoo', you must have inferred something! And if you inferred that I got good marks, you got one point. If you inferred that I got great marks, you get two. If you inferred that I got highest in class, you get the full ten marks!   Yep! That's right, ladies and gents! I got 84/100 for Chem! I am so darn happy with my results (of course, there's room for improvement, like the particle theory...but hey hey!)! An A1. And I maintained my top position for Chem too! YaY!! A good, happy, nice result, something to be proud of.  I hope Physics won't pull it down so much. :)  Yes! I am happy with my results. but somebody ain't. Who leh? Well, ni xin li you su! Who else would complain the whole day about me getting top and keep on cursing meI would fail other subjects? Guess lor. I got a sympathy mark from Mrs Chew (I wrote -2 instead of 2-...but she gave me correct anyway), and he demanded me that I return the mark. So full of integrity and all. And keep on griping about it all day long. Come on lor. If she wants to be sympathic and give me marks, let her give la. Rejecting it would be like rejecting hongbaos. Which is NOT a very nice thing to do.  Then, he complained about me boasting my marks. I happy ma. Cannot tell meh? And keep complaining and complaining and using su yus like "something something qian shou yi" I retorted , "Well, somebody mei you zhi ge to hao lian lor! Want to hao lian also cannot!". Sigh. Then he started being mean towards me. I think, ultimately, he's jealous that I won him yet again. Jeslousy brings you nowhere, my boy.   Today, Yit Hann was being pervertic. He drew pictures of sexual organs (both sexes included) and asked everybody to tell him what he drew. Ew! Then, XC improvised. He drew different pics for the letters of the female sex organ (clue: 6 words). HaHa! But what's funny is that WQ tried to decipher the message, but couldn't get what it is. We thought he don't know how to spell, so we spelt out the word for him. But he still doens't know! Oh my god! He went around asking everybody in the bus what is it. Oh my god! Such embarrassment! Finally, SL told him. He remembered....oh my!!!   Today, I got my quiz prize back. There are three things given to me: a black file, a blue pen and a pad of the school's fool-scap paper. I used the black files for my blog (the old one is full and I printed out September's entries) and the blue pen for use on my computer table. I am giving XC the fool-scap pad. I have no use for it, and he wants it. After all, he helped me confirm some answers. I also got my Bio Practical back. I got 26/40. Not bad ar. Meow meow!  I think I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Bye blog!

      Heya! You know what? I didn't go to school today. Meow!  I was sick. Actually, I recovered in the morning. Looks like the fever is only minor (unlike last two times! thank god!). I didn't go to school because I am too lazy to, and Mother don't want fever to come back today, so no school for moi.  I woke up at 8+. I bathed and then ate bread for breakfast. I went down to buy 8-Days to read. Meow! I read 8-Days till about 9+, then  read the newspaper. I discovered that Wednesdays have good shows to watch. For example, the repeat telecast of "Everybody Wins: Homerun Special", the new season of The District (yaY! I missed the show!) and tonight's Charmed.   After reading Straits Times, I went on to read "Bridal Bedlam", a Sabrina book. Then, I went online to check my mail and stuff. I read FAQs on FFIX, the Sims and this and that.  Mom went out at 11+ with Dad to go shoppping. It's a weekly thing. She always go shopping when it's her off-day as a cashier. I went offline at 12 to watch Everybody Wins.  For lunch, I ate two Sunshine Vanilla Bread. How meowful. After watching Everybody Wins, I went online again, to wait for The District to show. At 1.30, Mom and Dad came back. They brought two new computer chairs. Oh! They are so big.I am sitting in one of them right now. They got arm-rest one. So cool. It's a lil too big, cannot squeeze under the keyboard thingy...but cool!   At 2, I watched The District while parents went out to Sheng Shiong for grocery shopping. I missed good old Jack Mannion, Temple Page and so many more. Ahh!! How meowful is that!   After the wonderful episode of District, I played FFIX. Alright. FFIX updates. I managed to get all the Chocograpgh treasures, except for a crack in the Forgotten Contitnent and a bubble in the Quan's Dwelling. Sigh!! I don't even know where Quan's Dwelling is. And I tried to level up my cats by fighting Grand Dragon. But it's too strong for us! Sigh!  Then, CQ called. First, he gave me the good news. I won a prize for the GK quiz the Humanities Bioard held last term. But I wasn't there to recieve it! sigh! An opportunity wasted. I am gonna get it from Jalil tomorrow, I think. Then, he told me the bad news. I got B4 for E-Maths. No improvement there. Sigh!! No other papers have been given out. Tomorrow we are recieving our Chem and EL paper. I don't think I wanna get my EL paper back. Sigh!  After playiong FFIX, I went online again to chat with XC and WQ. At 6.30, I went out to eat.  After eating and walking around GValue, I came back, bathed and watched 15 mins of Holland V. And I came online. I think I am stopping now. Alright. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Heya! Sunday marks the end of the fateful week. Ahh. Sundays are so significant.  Today was an averagy day. The good part of today only happened in the afternoon and night.   In the afternoon, I watched X-Men II, the VCD which I brought at Carrefour last time. Ayioh, to tell you the truth, it was dissappointing. They cut away quite a number of scenes. For example, the one where they showed the effects of Cerebro on the mutants and humans. I was expecting these scences you know. Darn!!   After movie watching, I went online for a bit. At 5.30, I went down to buy dinner for brother , then rushed to CauseWay Point to have dinner with Wendy and Manda. I am going thete to give money to Wendy for my domain (WQ!! My $1.70! You owe me for two months! You better pay up ar! Or else, drastic actions may follow...) and eat dinner with her also.   I met them at LJS. Their colleague, Gavin, also came. Hmm...he's quite okay la. All of us brought Combo 1 (I didn't get cheated. The person said "regular drinks?" I said "small please". There!) During our dinner, so many things happened. For example, I scratched my face and it bleed. Gavin hates the sight of blood. We also discussed about stocks and money exchange. We also talked about WanWan's choice. Me, manda and Gavin supported WanWan's decision to marry YX, Wendy went against it. AFter eating, me and Amanda went to Popular to find Janet while the two went home.  We brought two packets of M&Ms and I said my farewells to Janet. After that, we walked around CauseWay Point. We went into Kiddy Palace to look around. We went into Courts and Computer ETC to look at her notebooks. We went into EMF before Courts, but we saw Govind and I panicked and ran away. However, when we returned, she wans't there. We looked around here and there. Lastly, we went into Metro and Wendy introed her boss and colleagues. I saw the Merlee, the cashier whom Wendy can't get along well with. Heh. At 8, we started going back.  Sigh. I am kinda worried for tomorrow! I mean, I am going to to Malaysia. What if I am robbed? I die le la! Moo meow meow! I must take precautions! Yes!! Ayioh! I must plan to record my programs! Only 6 hours! Charmed must be recorded! Survivor too! Oh my my! So ruan!  Okay. I gotta go le. See ya on Tuesday (Monday can't blog...maybe can la. I see in the afternoon). Night blog!

      Oh heya! Today's weekend Saturday. Moo meow meow!  Hmm...today nothing really major happened. In the afternoon, I met with XC, CQ, WQ and Hann to discuss about our Malaysia trip.   Ayioh!! That XC ar! Made me wait for him for so long!! An hour you know. Just standing there and waiting and waiting. 30 minutes passed and I can't see him. I started getting fed up and stormed here and there. I was thinking of doing something drastic, but it was against my better judgement to embarrass myself. Sigh....so I just cursed and scolded him till he arrived. So late!!  Hmm...we sat down in the foodcourt in CauseWay Point and discussed la. We discussed what to do, what to eat and the checklist. Ayiah. So much disagreements. Me and CQ saw the maximum amount we can spend there, we got kinda scared le. Our parents only giving us S$200, which is around RM4220. Yeah. Sigh. I think we have to scrimp and save and not waste money. Meow!!!  Hmm...after all the discussing and photocopying, we went down to go home. We stopped by Wendy's workplace to exchange pleasantries. The male colleage who is standing besides Wendy looked at us weirdly when we called for her. She told me that he think it's funny stupid that we would do that. O.o! She was kinda tired, after handling so many customers. Poor thing.  Hmm...after that, nothing really interesting happened. Heh. I am kinda excited about the trip, but also a bit worried. I am worried I would be homesick. Last year, just barely two days outta home, I got very homesick already. What about you, dear blog! I cannot update you le. Oh wait. There's a computer with internet connection at YH's aunt's place. Maybe I can go online to update you after all. Meow!!  Hm. I think I end this le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey hey!!! I am so darn happy!  Holland V just showed! Oh my god! I loved this episode! First thing, JingJing is divorcing Ah Ming!! Finally! I have been waiting for this day for so long! Oh god! JingJing can finally be with XiaoXin! Second piece of good news, SiTing finally ackowledged WanWan as "Mum"! So touching!! The most exciting part is, who WanWan chooses! The lucky cat is....Yang Xiong!! YAY!!! I always wanted them to be together! My predictions came true! YaY. Ya know, ever since NuoWen left for Australia, I pretty much ruled him out off the picture. YX contributed so much to the family...He deserves to be recongized for his efforts.  Oh...today I went to watch a movie. Rugrats Go Wild to be exact. It was an okay movie, quite humourous too! I watched it with XC and HuiMin. Hmm, the rest of the time, we went around Causeway Point shopping for Christmas presents. We paid a little visit to Amanda in the ladies' department in Metro. I gave her quite a scare, hehehe. We also visited Wendy in the Christmas decor department. Heh. I never knew they have to carry around batteries. Coolies! I got a few ideas what to buy le for who le.  Hmm....what else happened today ar? Ahh...yes. I chose my JCs. My top 3 choices are: AJ Science, PJ Science and YJ Science. Hmm.... Excellent choices. Yeah. No regrets la. Cannot regret anymore. Form sent in.  Hmm...you know what? I am going off le. Gonna watch Survivor later. So, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Yesterday was Charmed day, so ya know the story. Charmed was cool yesterday! "I am the MOTHER" and blowing up of demons. O.o! I love the Crone!  Yesterday, I went to Escape Theme Park. Me and Ben met up first and went to Woodlands Interchange to meet up with the rest. Finally the whole group of 7 (me, Ben, XC, HM, EC, JiaHui and Melvin) gathered and we took the train towards Pasir Ris.    Opps, we took the wrong train. Instead of taking the train to Marina Bay, we took the Jurong East-bound train. Opps. On the train, we were talking and reading my 8 Days. Mostly, they were talking about the Star Awards Popular Artiste nominees (who will win and who will not).   After taking two trains and bus 354, we reached Escape Theme Park at around 1030. Hmm....we brought tickets and went in. Surprisingly, they did not give us arm bands to wear. That means cannot go out le. Darn.  Our first activity was the Go-Kart. HaHa! I was driving real slowly, not really that slow, but I was adjusting ma. HaHa. So scaredy-cat me. After that, we played this 3 other times. I sped really fast during these 3 times. HaHa! I even accelerated when going down the slope. I like car 19. XC and most people have trouble steering it (they crashed), but this car feels perfect to me. This got the "Most Exciting Award" from us.     After that, we played Pirate Ship. My first ride was real scary. Subsequent rides later, I felt very okay and enjoyed the rides. Wee!! During some of these rides, we would sing songs. We sang Riverside's and FuChun's school songs. Then, we moved on to nursery rhymes like "BaBa Black Sheep" and "London Bridge Is Faling Down". HeHe! After that, there was once we spilted, 4 ride one side of the ship, 3 the other. Then, we kept "You"ing each other. HaHa!! We gave this the "Ride That Brought The Children Our Of Us".   After the Pirate ship, we went to play the Panasonic Roller Coaster. It was kinda disappointing. I expected a much longer drop. Opf! We named this "Most Disappointing Award".   Then, they went onto the Cadbury Inverter. Only me, Mel and XC did not go sit that ride. Me and Mel were too afraid to go up that ride, but XC wanted to play it the last. Too bad he didn't get to play it, because that was the only time the group played the Inverter.  After that, we went on Wet And Wild, except for Mel. Me and XC were on a boat together. Woah! I was kinda soaked. XC decided to splash water on me, so I splashed back. HaHaHa! In the end, both of us were thoroughly soaked!  After that, it was more Pirate ship and Go-Kart rides to dry ourselves.  Then, lunch came. I spent about $6.40 ordering a Large Sprite and some bacon hamburger. Hmm! The drink turned out to be contaminated with a strand of hair, but i already gulped down a big portion of it. XC and Mel went to change it for me (I refused to change....drink so much already want me to change) and took the drink for themselves. HaHa.  Then, we played some slot games. XC won himself a soft toy (BumbleBear). Lucky him. The whole afternoon was spent playing Go-Kart and Pirate Ship rides. Haha! We left the Theme Park at around 5.50+. We went to Causeway Point to eat our dinner. I ate the sheng mian CQ likes to eat so much. So garlicky. As I was having a cold, I sneezed and some food was choked. My nose felt terribly blocked. Then, I sneezed multiple times and out came a stick of vegetable. How gross!   I came back feeling quite terrible. Ergh. Even with a cold, I watched Charmed. I will watch Charmed no matter what!  Today morning, I woke with a feeling much more better. Today was my Mother's off day, so the whole family is going out to Carrefour in Plaza Singapura. Except me, because WQ was coming to play.  Hm. I watched yesterday's recorded tapes in the morning. Oh god! Yesterday's episode of Holland V was so touching! I cried when SiTing and WanWan reconcilled. So touching! You know, Holland V's ending tomorrow. I can't bear to say goodbye to them! For 25 weeks, I have been watching this great show! This show provoked a lot of emotions from me, ranging from anger to love. Yeah! Can't bear to leave! I wonder who will WanWan choose. I hope they won't leave us a cliffhanger and said "To Be Continued". I hate that!!  This afternoon, WQ came lor. We played the Need For Speed, X-Men and Street Fighters. I won him in X-Men (duhz. Who can win my Phoenix?) and at Street Fighters at first. He mastered Chun Li's move (Kaikosen? Forgot the name) and kept using it. O.o! Hmm...no need to say in racing who won la. I sucks at the game.  After that, he ate noodles and played GunBound. Oh god! He was a team suicide player! He moved while he's firing weapons, causing several team members to be severly hit. Sigh!! After that leh, HE MESSED UP WITH MY RADIO! DO YOU KNOW HOW FREAKING HARD IT IS TO ADJUST BACK TO THE CORRECT STATION? F**K! I hate people playing with my radio. My perfect position. It stays where it is. NO ADJUSTMENTS UNLESS DONE BY ME! Guests coming to my home please take note of this important fact.  After that, I stayed home while the rest of the family ate dinner, due to nature calls. Sigh. WQ invited me to play 'badmintion'. However, I already promised XC to do the PAE thingy with him. Therefore, in the end, I am NOT playing 'badmintion'. Sigh. Got into yet another argment with WQ. He's so petty (must this be over-emphasized? I think the whole world knows. Or at least, those who reads my blog). He went on to blame me for something that is totally not connected to his issue. Sheez. Then, while I was typing my rebuttal, he went offline. HOW PETTY! He's so afraid of losing. I hate people cutting me off, and especially those who don't rebutt. Cowards!   Sorry for that crabby attitude. I am just too annoyed about the messing up of my radio.   I gotta be going liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.

      Heya! Slow Tuesday. Changing Tuesday.  Heya! It's officially, my first day off. Yeah. I don't even get to rest after 3 days of going outs and having fun. Today, I can finally rest at home and complete my To-Do list.  First thing. I have to spring clean my table (okay. winter-clean would be more apporpriate. Spring hasn't come yet, and it's winter now). Yeah. You can't believe how much junk I removed from my table. I kept working pens, ornaments (presents), stationery and letters from friends (I collected so many over the years. Like letters from Joanne Ye, YingYing, SL and Wendy). Ohters like useless things with I haven't touched for years and is gathering dust is thrown away. After that, I gave my table a good wipe and re-arranged my stuff. It looks much more better now! So neat and organized.  I also spent today watching my taped programs. Oh god! Rupert got kicked out. WQ is gonna be so dead!!! SPOILERS DO NOT DESERVE TO WALK THIS PLANET! Idiots (the ones who kicked Rupert out, with the exception of Lil, and spoilers and wanna-be spoilers)! So meowful! X-Men Revolution is so suspenseful! Apocalypse is now releashed! What is gonna happen?!  Hm. One interesting thing happened. Me and WQ got into an argument, about the 'lousiness' of Escape Theme Park. He asked me to present my points why I think Escape is not sucky. So I did (I am not gonna present them here. I found it tiring narrating the same thing over and over again.). He tried to counter my argument, but his counter has a lopphole, so I countered his counter and won. However, knowing WQ, he's not gonna let it slide easily. The sore loser went to a local message board and asked for people's opinions on Escape. He's proving to me that Escape is sucky. I laugh at his futile attempts to 'win'. Oh come on! This is a really stupid way to win. I wrote a message, listing my previous arguements and counter-arguements. Heh. Let's see who's gonna have the final laugh. This should be interesting.   Hmm....I made further additions and subtractions to my To-Do list. Here are the changes:  Things to do:  -Winter clean my entire room. Slowly. -Print out my blog entires.  -Decide on who to buy Xmas presents and what to give them   Okay. That's all I think. Gotta go now. Tomorrow's going to Escape. Very excited about it. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Monday the mooing day!  Hmm, today I went to school to get the PAE (Provisional something something) application form. We are supposed to meet at 9am in the AVA room. So, at 8, we are supposed to meet (me, CQ, WQ, XC and HM). XC was very late, but oh well.  HaHa! We arrived there at 8.45, but the meeting doesn't start till 9.30. Oh my! We were given a form with our PIN and some booklet regarding the PAE exercise. I can only choose like....five or so JCs lor. I am choosing Pioneer JC....hm. I hope I am making the right choice.   After the exercise, we stayed in school (don't know whatever for). After that, me, XC, HM and EeChuang left lor. We were originally going to bowl, but WQ the organiser backed out at the last minute, and we were left with no choices.  First, we went to eat at LJS. We had to wait a while after breakfast hours, and for the fishes and fries to be fried. This time, I was careful enough not to get tricked. And I didn't. HaHa! We discussed a lot of things, like the reason why Mrs Chew is leaving RSS. She said she needed a change of environment. According to my analysis, I think it's because of Mrs Singh. It's a well-known fact among our class that Mrs Chew can't tolerate Mrs Singh's attitude. If not, it's either a relationship with colleague gone sour, or she feels she was being ostrasized. Meow!! My analysis can be correct you know!  After that, we went up to buy tickets to a movie. We are watching Uptown Girls. Finally!! Get to watch that movie! But the movie starts at 1.20, and we got 1 hour ++ to shop. so, we went around Causeway Point looking for Christmas presents.   Me, HM and XC went up at 1.10 (EC gone home). We brought popcorns, drinks, then went inside the cinema. Woah! Uptown Girls is such a cool movie! Funny and it got a touching storyline at the end. I pitied both the main actresses as they faced through life's difficulties. Hm!   After the movie, we went more shopping. The last thing we did was print NeoPrint pics. HaHa! My hair was so cut! So ugly...hehe. The overall effect ws nice la. So moo meow.   I went back home, took a bath and watched taped Holland V. I am gonna watch the rest of the taped tapes tomorrow. O.o!! After that, it's a night of TV watching and online surfing. I am goning to go to Escape Theme Park on Wed with the rest of the music students. Moo meow!  Okay. I gotta be going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! What a beautiful Sunday!  Today leh, me and family went out. Today's my mother day off ma, so the family go out to enjoy a bit lor.  Hmm...first, we went out to eat. We went to Admiralty Place to eat lor. What did I eat? Oh yeah. Chicken rice. The tenpanyaki bencurd is real nice. Must eat it next time. I went to Popular and saw this must buy Charmed Book. Seasons of the Witch, Volume 1. So I brought it and read it during the car journeys.  We went to Carrefour. My father wants to buy some new trousers. Hmm....What did I buy there? X-Men 2 the VCD and Clay Aiken's debut album, Measure of a Man. There was this Top 10 CDs section. I went over, and saw Measure of a Man. I listened to his CD and actually found his songs very nice. So, I brought it lor. I suggested to my mother to buy a CD-radio for me. I always wanted a radio to listen to and to play my CDS. My mother says the radio there is lousy, so we are going to buy at Courts.  Therefore, our next stop is Courts. We went to the Ang Mo Kio branch. I got three choices avilable for me. A Sony, Phillips and Thompson. After much deliberation, I chose the Thompson model, due to its good stereo system and its ability to play CD-Rs/CD-RWs. Hmm! YaY!! Finally had a radio in my room le!! :)  Okay. For dinner, we went to the Zheng Fa Huo Hai Xian. Yep, I know. Same place I went on Friday. This time, I can choose what to put in the soups and don't have to face possible disasters/insults when i splashed the soup all over looking for my hams. Hmm...this time, we ate more meat, more harms, more seafood. Heh heh. I felt more full than Friday. HeHe!!  After that leh, came back home. I finished my book already. Great Charmed book. I took a bath and connected the radio. Moo meow! I was so freaked out at first. The radio has no static when I was in front of it. But when I moved away, static came. This reminds me of one of the Mr Bean episodes (if any of you have seen, you know what I am talking bout, right? Where Mr Bean have to strip to watch his TV? HaHa!). So, I moved the position of the radio, facing me. Now, it has no static. HaHa! So freaky!!  Alright, I felt like composing a To-Do and a To-Nuy list. So here goes:   Things to buy:  -Galadriel Water's Harry Potter books -Charmed books -Chirstmas presents    Things to do:  -Spring clean my table (too cluttered...especially with the addition of the radio) -Decide on who to buy Xmas presents and what to give them -Decide on whether to follow WQ to queue overnight or not -Watch all my taped programmes for Fri and Sat. 3.5 hours of shows to catch up!  Alright. I gotta be going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Oh my god!! The Os are finally over! Woo-hoo! Sorry for not blogging yesterday! I was simply TOO tired!  Okay okay. Let's talk about The MCQ questions. They were generall okay lor. I found most of them easy. Physics was kinda tricky with SI units and call. But oh well!! I can manage. And oh my meow!!! Mrs Chew is leaving for Evergreen Secondary!! I heard she chose to leave on her own. I wonder if it is because of bad collegeas? OOO!! That means she could be my brother's Chem teacher! I wonder if she's gonna play the "bonus points" game with them!! If she's gonna be his Chem teacher, I can pass letters to her via my brother! O.o!!!!  Okay....went back, bathed, went online and ate lunch till 1pm. I went o Wendy's to play MahJong. Woah! Hands so itchy to play. Woah! Howver, the game became quite stale after playing for many many rounds. I stopped playing when the controller went bersek and I discarded one of my wanted tiles! Darn! After that, I joined Wendy to sleep in her room. Ha! She slept on the bed, I slept on the mattress on the floor. Ha! Slept till her mom came back, then she went to bath and this and that. We left her house at 3.15.   All of us met at Woodlands Control Station at around 3.30. Our group went up first, while the other is waiting for MeiYing's sister. Me, CQ, WQ sit at one side, while Wendy, Ping, Chun, Amanda and Janet sat the opposite seats. We chatted and talked and mooed and meowed. Heh. We alrighted at Marina Bay, then took a bus 400 to the restuarant.   Woah! We were there VERY early! Woah! We were joined by Hann later on. After some minutes of waiting around, we went into the restuarant and found that it was open.So, we decided to eat then. Each of us pays $12.   Everyone was like....woah. In a flurry to get things. I was very confused, so I didn't get anything. Hmm... meat was brought back first, so we fried meat to eat. Quite nice actually! They brought back crabs and prawns! Woah! They were really live (No wonder they call the restuarant Zheng Fa Huo Hai Xian (Cheng Fa Live Seafood) )!! Oh god! The prawns are alive and kicking! They struggled when we try to put them into the water!! HaHa!! So cute!   Woah! I find that hor, people don't like a lot of things i like, except for Hann. At my table, WQ and some cats don't like seafood. They took a lot a lot of french fries and chicken wings! Such a waste of money. Only Hann and me like sotong ar, cuttlefish ar, harms ar, vessels ar.... Hann even stole my sotong!!! My beautiful sotong!! Eating steamboat without these hor, is not called eating steamboat. Only cuttlefishes, sotongs, harms and other things complete "steamboat"! Even the boiled harms are nice to eat! The steam from the stock soup fogged up my glasses. My glasses are so oily!!   After that, me, Hann and CQ went to the arcade to play. Hann played the Para Para! Woah! He's so good at dancing Para Para wor! Moo meow! Ayiah....we flitted here and there, between the arcade and the restuarant. HaHaHa! We started to leave around 8, but in the end, we left at 8.30. Hm...we went to Orchard to see the Chistmas decos.  Woah! So spectacular! Never been to Orchard to see Christmas decos before leh! So cute the decorations! I love the hanging lights! We walked around and saw many buskers! Woah!! They then decided to go to Heeren to take NeoPrints. Woah! Took such a long time! Most of us were rushing back home. But we don't have the heart to tell them that we are going. Nobody does. So we waited like fools. Till Wendy and Clar came running out and we went back home. You shoulda seen WQ. He was madly rushing for the train. I foresaw that he couldn't catch the arriving train. And I was right. Stupid guy. What's the difference between catching a train then and catching a train 4 mins later? Anyway, we went back at, reached home at 11. It was pouring real heavily when I was going home. Oh god!  Okay....today hor, I went to East Coast Park for celebration. The choir is celebrating for us  We took bus 966 there. What a long journey! Then, we had to walk quite a fair bit to get to our shelter. Heh heh. Firstly, some of us went to the beach to play, while some rented bikes and skates. Those who went to the beach are those playing bikes/skates later. Oh...I treated Wendy today. HaHa! She spent about $12 off moi. Heh! Me, CQ were walking on the beach..getting our feet soaked. HaHa. We found stones and threw them into the water. Heh. After a while, we stopped and rest. Me, Ji and his sister went to the shelter to rest and wait for lunch. Then, HF and YJ joined us and we played daidee. After that, we played Cheat. HaHa. I almost ended up being the loser.   For lunch, we ate YiJuia's noodles. woah! So nice! JiJia is really good at cooking wor! After lunch, we went to rent bikes and skates. Me, SL and Joyce rented skates, while CQ, YT and SP rented bikes. Woah! This was my first time on skates! So fun and exciting. We made SP teach us to skate. I mastered it first, then Joyce. SL gave up after bout 50 minutes of trying. We were practising along a fence. I was supporting SL and helping Joyce. I got a cut there from a rusted nail, which made me ultra paranoid about getting tenatus. HaHa! We had difficulty walking up and down ramps. Heh. Joyce and I kept holding on to CQ & YT's bike. HeHe! I had fun skating!   After doing that, we went back to the shelter to play some games. Woah! First game was running and getting sweets from a pile of flour. We were kinda unwilling, but we gave in to their pleads in the end. Our group (Me, CQ, YT, SL and Joyce) won! Yay!! After that leh, we took photos. Then, it started to rain! Heavily! Oh my meow!! Mine and CQ's backs were wet, because our back is facing the direction of where the rain pours in. Oo my! First, we played truth or dare. For this, we played it kinda differently. We held hands, and if we wanted to kill people, we squeeze our partner's hand the number of the people the vicitim is sitting from us. I got Joyce and CQ as partners. When Joyce was murderer, she kept squeezing my hand. HaHa! Once, I was murderer, and I squeezed CQ's and Joyce's hands two times, killing HM and TW. Heh. So fun! After that leh, we played the game Zhong Ji Mi Ma. The loswer has to play Truth Or Dare. Joyce lost during once, but she refused to tell the truth, so she had to do a dare. The dare is to shout from far away: "I like XC!". She gave me a murderous stare when I suggested that. Heh heh heh!!   Hmm....we stopped the game after the rain let down. We ate some more food, then went home. We met Wendy and EC after thir bathing, and CQ they all went to change clothes. Me and Joyce took some seashells EC don't want and threw the rest away into the sea. HaHa! So fun!   After changing clothes and throwing away seashells, we went home lor. We took the bus at 5++. The rest stopped at a MRT station, while me and Wendy stayed on the bus till it reaches Woolands. We chatted about a lot of stuff. HeHe.   I reached home at about7.15, bathed and ate dinner (instant noodles). Ayiah. That's all lor. HeHe. Sorry for sounding rushed. I am kinda tired now. So, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! I am back.  Hmmm...nothing much to report on. I played the computer the whole afternoon. Chatted online, played games online.   Oo oo!! You know what? I went to a Charmed site, and they got this signs to tell you that you are an obsessive fan. I will post my 'obsessive fan' habits. Okayy...here goes.   You are watching too much Charmed when:  -->When you walk up to an automatic door at the grocery store,you wave your hand like Prue used to do and pretend you used Telekinesis to open it. (I do that to the lifts often! HaHa!)  -->You hold out your hand and call for things that are across the room (I always like to do that!)  -->If you get angry at someone, you wave your hands about, trying to blow them up (Ha!)  -->Whenever a charmed ad comes on tv or radio, you yell at the whole room to shush and listen intently to the ad. Then when its over, you get all excited about it and everyone rolls their eyes. (Yep yep yep! I even hush up my family whenever Charmed is on! I want to hear properly!!)  -->Dream about Charmed (Oh boy!)  -->You own all the Charmed books that you are aware are on sale ( have about 14 now!)  -->You obsess for hours about a certain character and wonder how cool it would be to have their power (Oh yeah! I sure do!)  Guilty as charged! Heh heh heh! Alright...gotta end this liao. See! You learnt something interesting about me today. Night blog!

      Heh heh! Sorry for not blogging yesterday. I am running out of time. Heh.  Okie...yesterday's my History paper. Before the paper, I studied in the morning lor. Then, met Ji at 12 and went to school. At school, me, Ji, Manda and SL discussed aboutHistory lor. I taught them the War In The Pacific. Hmm...I have been doing this question all year, so if it comes out in the exam, I think I would do it.  Hmm...the History exam...sigh. It ended up being the same as the SS paper. Yes, Japan did came out. But they asked about attacking Pearl Harbor, which I didn't even learn. Sigh! I anyhow came out with explanations. I hope they can get through. One question, asking about reasons why Japan attacked China, I know how to answer. Ha! I had been answering that for ages. SBQ was a shocker. 3 pictorial sources! Oh my my. But it was kinda easy la. Come one lor. No motives to be inferred (they don't even provide you with provenanance), so the highest level is not the motive level. Kinda worrying, but the questions were easy. Sigh...everybody thinks we are gonna be toasted by this paper. There goes my A!!  Hmmm....me, Ji, SL and HuiMin went to Causeway Point to buy present for YiChun. First, we went to eat at the foodcourt. Hmmmmm.....very shocking. VERY VERY shocking. After that, we went to buy a prezzie lor. We brought a DIY photo frame, where she can mould and paint. I think she would like it, being an artistic person.  After that, came back and watched TV lor. Heh heh! The Holland V millionaire special is so fun to watch! So funny the cast! Heh!! After that, came online and chatted lor.  Charmed is so cool!! Piper delivered her baby ("If you are referring to Mr Winkie between the legs, yeah, it's a boy" Phoebe). O.o!! So cool! They used unicorn magic to vanquish the evil cats. What a cute baby boy!  Sigh. I am being forced to cut my hair after blogging. Why can't I lead my life the way I want?! WHY MUST THE SCHOOL/GOVERNMENT IMPOSE SUCH TERRIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON MY LIFE? When I am going to school, I am going there to be taught knowledge, NOT to have my life controlled by conservative idiots. Why can't males have long hair? What kind of rubbish-convention is this? Even in dynastic China, males have extremely long hair. Even in medievel ages, males have long hair too! Why and how did China men evolve from having long hair to keeping them short now? This is the new age, people! We are being controlled by the tight-rules of our supposedly-modern society. It pains me to be adhering to these idiotic, life-controlling 'rules'. Sigh..... I wish convention can be done away! Gone!! Then, we can live in a modern socirty, unbound by conservative laws. Sigh! If you think I am letting my hair cut without presenting a fight, then I say, you are sadly mistaken.  See ya tonight, blog! Bye!

      Heya! Today's meowing Tuesday. Rainy rainy Tuesday.  Hmm...today I was kinda tired in the morning. You see ar, my mother is working extra early tomorrow (Shop N Save is stock-taking). So, she asked my father to fetch her and her friend (Pei Pei) to work. To get a free ride to school, I decided to take my father's car. They are leaving at 5.40, so that means I have to wake up at 4.45. Sigh!! I reached the Inerchange at 5.45. So early. And so sleepy.  Hmmm...first hor, I got A-Maths 2. Woah!! I tell you hor!! It's so damn easy! I felt happy doing the paper, especially the Straight-Line graph! That question I know man! This is the topic which worried me the most, but I was able to solve it quite efficiently. Heh heh. The rest okay la. Some easy, some challenging. But hey! Very easy on the whole.  After A-Maths (finally over!), we studied Chem lor. Actually, I spent most of my time teaching Wendy Chemistry. Especially Organic Chem and techinques on Salt-Making. I feel that salt-making will come out, and Organic Chem has a high possibility. I didn't really revise much. Too much confidence in myself ba.  HaHa! The Chem paper was easy! Although it was harder than Prelims, on the whole, it was considered an easy paper. This time, there was more "memory work", asking us to state uses of so-many-things. Surprise surprise. Organic Chem only had one question appearing, and that was extremely easy for words. They asked for names of processes. Whoever got them wrong is really....go jump down the building la. No suprise that in essay, a salt-making technique was asked (titration). Hmm.....the only question that stumped me was something about measuing volume of methane/products formed in temperatures below and above 100 degrees. Other than that, the paper was easy.  Hmm...I was planning to watch Matrix Revolutions today. But never did I expect that the next avialable show is at 7. I told my Mother beforehand that I would be back at 6something. You can't expect me to go back on my promises. I have responsibilities you know. Sigh... Now these people are on a mission to ignore me. Well, everybody's speaking to me. Except for petty old WQ. Oh. Well.  Due to threats from my mother to switch off the main power (darn! Should have broke my promise...hate it when she do that!), I gotta be going now. Bad ending for blogs? Very. But we can't win under unfair dictorial maternal rule. So oh well. See ya tomorrow after History. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Monday...the start of the week. The beginning of the end!  Ayiah...today hor, was quite boring la. It turned out that my plan to sleep late failed utterly. I woke up even before they left. I was planning to wake up real late, after my family leave for the Yishun doctor. But hor, I woke up so early. But of course, I pretended to be sleeping till they left the door. Woah! I walked around, calling friends out of boredom. After bathing, Mom claled to buy ask what breakfast I wanted. It turned out that the doctor didn't come today. Sigh.  Hmm...I mostly surfed the Net in the morning. Hmm....I wanted to study in the afternoon la.  Ha! In the end hor, I almost sudied nothing. HeHe. What did I do ar? I went through A-Maths, then studied Germany lor. After that, I fell asleep. Heh heh. Sleep sleep sleep till 4 something. Heh. I called my gego friends. They said Geog was easy..or at least, average for them. That's good.  Oh my! I just got wind that the choir SYF photos are out. Ahh! I have to pay $5 you know. Hmm! Have to come up with $5 meow meow tomorrow.  Oh well. Gotta keep this short. I am teaching Wendy Organic Chem lor. Hmm....I hope she can understand the chapter. At least, you know...till tomorrow Chem. Yeah. All the best to those taking A-Maths and Chem. Se ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Sunday! The last day of the wee k ! The day so free...so warm..er-hm.  Ehhh...today I went to Wendy's house to study. I helped her buy stamps along the w a y. The girl ar. Still sleeping when I came. Haha! I had to wait for her outside while she wakes up and get ready. Meow!!  Hmm...I completed everything in Chem until Organic Chem. I am leaving Organic Chem till tomorrow, 'cause I am teaching Wendy. Study at the same  t ime lor. Wendy studied her Geog, something about arigicultural plantation. Moo meow!  Ermm...we chatted quite a fair bit today. Like we always do. This time, Wendy wanted to "enter" herself in the Teenage Magazine Penpal. HeHe. She did that last time, and some people sent in boring letters. Heh heh. I was thinking it would be fun to answer them, so I suggested to Wendy that she give me all her boring letters that she's gonna receive. She don't want to reply ma, so I do it for her lor! Heh heh! I am thinking of different styles of reply in. Diplomatic, sarcastic, airhead...so fun!  I am so awaiting the lett e rs!   After studying, we played MahJong again. I swear that I have the worst luck ever. I kept having the game of waiting-for-one-tile-to-hu, but that one tile never came. Instead, I everytime discard tiles, my discarded tile will be picked up by the other players and I make them hu. Err!!! Wendy, on the other hand, same situation as me, but hor, she keeps winning. She ji mou or pick up tiles from other people. So good! I will never gamble on MahJong. I will lose till very chan.  Today, me and Wendy ate with her Third Brother. Her mother is painting the wall. O.o It's a new experience. Heh. Seriously. Uhmm....the chicken stall changed owners. Now, the rice and soup and chilli flavour is not aqs good compared to the previous one. Sigh!! I brought duck noodles back for my brother.  Hmm..I end le ba...Heh. Oh...wishing the Geog students good luck for their exam tomorrow! May the exam be as easy as meowing! See ya tomorrow.

      Oh hey! Saturday...the first weekend day. O.o  You know what? I am still singing the trailer song...(MacBeth spell). HaHa! It's so easy to sing and memorise. I sang myself to sleep last night. I sang in while bathing. I sang it practically everywhere. HaHa! I am so obsessed with the movie, which is ONLY coming out June 4th next year. Darn!   Alright...today I studied about...let's see....4 chapters. HeHe! Well, I was pretty distracted over there, but oh well. I am gonna make it up on Sunday (tomorrow...duhz!). Hmm...I am okay with the fundamentals of Chem. However, I need to know more than the fundamentals to score an A. Hmm!! Ah Ji said that I know my Chem work, and all I made is careless mistakes, and I can't save them by studying even harder. He's got a point you know...but Chem's my forte. My best forte so to speak. Cannot let Chem grades drop AT ALL!  Today leh, I learnt the sacred art of MahJong!! :) HaHaHa! I learnt by the help of PS and Wendy's mom's game. Heh Heh! So fun the game! So addictive some more! Woah! I won twice! HaHa! Pung! Chi! Gang! Hu!!! Bwahahaha! I can't wait to play it in real life!  HaHa! I think I shall end here le ba....so see ya tomorrow.  Double double toil and trouble.....

      Hey hey! Today's Freakin Friday. TGIF!  Ahh yes. Today, I revised about 9 chapters of Chem. It's very easy...basics and all, so I just breezed through them. HaHaHa! WQ came to study...and I had fun talking. Yep. The silly ramblings of a deluded lonely cat. After studying, we played the PS2 and I cooked mee for him again. Hmm...this time round, I made a comeback using Phoenix. HeHe! I mainly won by using my throws. Solar Flare ar...and I knew how to take opportunities and also built up my "trance" meter. Yeah. Special moves can be done using the blue bars up there. I don't think WQ knows. His specials were mainly done by luck. My strat was to keep him as far away as possible using throws, build up my meter, and attack using my special moves. Hehe! Opps, WQ might read this. Oh well! WQ!! Pretend you didn't read ar! Heh.  Oh my my!! I download the PoA movie trailer! Oh my god! It's so exciting! Ahh!!! I love the Hogwarts choir. They are singing a song from MacBeth, one of the Weird Sister's spell. I will post the lyrics later, courtesy of  urlLink MuggleNet . Everybody matured a lot! The most obvious is Malfoy! Boy, he sure grew! Hermione grew more beautiful. Lupin and Black (the actors who play them) are so handsome! The actress who plays Trelawney is so beautiful too! Of all the teachers, I love Trelawney the best! :) I am so excited about this movie!! Oh oh oh!!   I just returned from Survivor. Oh my! That was a close shave! Rupert's not eliminated! Good good good! He can continue winning Immunity. But oh well. These are the people I would like to get into the Final Four: Rupert, Christa, Sandra, Lil. I feel that they play the game real well. And they have the potential to outwit, outplay and outlast the rest. Uhm-hmm!   Alright...I think I end liao. Okay....lyrics first.  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Double, double toil and trouble--  Something wicked this way comes  Eye of newt, and toe of frog,  Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,  Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,  Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing,â€”  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn and cauldron bubble.  Something wicked this way comes.  Heh heh! I love this song. Currently memorising it and singing it! Alright...see ya later.

      Hey hey! Today's Thursday!  Wait! Before I delve into what Thursday holds for me, I want to tell you something about Charmed. You see ar, the Charmed ones are having a series of dreams (problematic ones to be exact). And guess what? I was able to diagnose, very accurately, the significance of their dreams. I am so proud of myself! My Charmed knowledge has not been wasted learning! :)  Alright. Today we had Bio, both papers. On the whole, it was easy. Only had some problems with a few questions, but I found myself enoying both papers. HaHa! Easy ma....even everybody said it was easy. :) You know, I was utterly bored throughout thw whole 2 papers.I finished about half an hour early for both papers, and I was stuck with nothing to do. So, I turned to observing the teachers in front of me. The Chief Examiner in particular. He has no rings on his finger. Is he single? I see many teachers with rings...except him. HaHa!! I am so pervertic...but hey! I am bored. I also wrote a poem, which I will post later. It's a LONG one.  After exams, we went to LJS to eat! I was cheated!! The guy spoke so fast...I only heard "salad or fries" in the end. Of course I chose fries. But!! The total turned out to be $4.90! Wayyyyy more than what I originally planned! I was so cheated! How could they cheat customers?!!! CQ also didn't understand, but he learnt from me and said "no no no" to everything. And he didn't get cheated! This is so unfair. Next time, if they dare to mumble again, I say loudly "No to everything! Normal meal that cost $3.60!!". Ayioh!! And hor, I met Wendy, YiChun, Amanda and Wendy. I stayed for a while to wait for Net to finish eating. After that, we went home lor.  Okay...I basically relaxed today. I played games ar, surfed the Net ar. Yeah la. I will only start revision tomorrow, starting with Chem. I am invitng WQ over to study lor. So afraid he won't study...and also I want accompaniment! Hehe! Must socre well in Chem, KY!  Okie....I think I should end le! Ehh! Not without posting my poem first! Presenting....    Choir   Tee Tee Tee Tuka Ton. Do you rememeber? Or from your memories gone?  The old choir days, Full of excitement and fun. We sing anything, (okay not all) Under the sun.  Mr Low, Mr Sharill, Lastly Miss Choo. Second one I like to kill.  Ba Jun Zhang, Beauty and the Beast. Miss Choo's songs, Are fun to say the least.  I miss choir, Darn! I graduated! But hey, come back I can! For my memories hasn't faded!   Tada! Here;s my ode to choir! :) Alright see ya tomorrow.

      Heya! Wednesday is always exciting!   Today, I completed Bio revision liao! HaHaHa! I spent about 2 hours studying 6 chapters. YaY! I am doing some last-minute revision tomorrow.Hmm.... Wish me all the best for Bio? HaHa!  Okay...today I went with Mother to buy my brother's remaining school textbooks. As expected, I was mistaken for an Evgian by the bookshop vendor. You know, I was expecting myself to be 'caught' by the principal for not wearing school u. I prepared a speech you know "With all due respect, I am not from Evergreen. Not everyone who steps into the front gate is an EVGian you know." Too bad I don't have to the chance to use it. Such a pity.  Hmm...I went to eat lunch at Woodlands Central. Sigh! Today was so dissappointing. the stall which makes fabulous laksa moved away, and today the dessert stall didn't open. Sigh!!!!   Oh yes. They brought the PS2 to be 'fixed'. It cannot play PS1 games (which was supposed to). The uncle told us that we need some special procedure, like swtich off and switch on, press reset button twice. Something like that la. And they brought a driving wheel, complete with pedals back. It was for racing purposes la. O.O!! I tried it....it's better in some ways. Ha! I make a lousy driver.   Hmm...ya know. I've been playing Makin Magic for quite some time now. I must say...it's quite fun! I learnt like 3-4 spells? Oh yeah! HaHa! I've been having fun. I need to improve a lot on my Sim's skills to earn MagiCoins ar, to become a superstar ar. Woah! So taxing wor! But so fun! I like it! And the music too! Wooooooo.......  Oh! You wanna know the result of Wendy's choice yesterday? It was a tough call, but due to a bit of luck here and there, Aaron Carter won! What a close shave!  Hmm...I gotta be going to watch Charmed. Sand Francsico's Dreaming tonight! Arlighty then. See ya tomorrow after the Bio exam. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Sorry for not writing. Yesterday was terribly rushed. Yes it was. I'll explain later. Just read.  Let's start with Monday first. Monday was the dreaded A-Maths paper. Hmm. I didn't think it was dreaded on Sunday. I was kinda confident that I can do well. Or at elast, pass. But, seeing this paper....sigh. Everybody thinks it's easy. I think it's not easy, but not difficult either. I have not much confident. A-Maths is a borderline subject for me. Either pass or fail. And mistakes can easily cause me to fail. I CANNOT fail A-Maths. If so, there goes my dream of majoring Chem in university. Or Bio for that matter. Sigh!! Must work hard for A-Maths 2! Darn darn darn.  Hm. I ddin't study on Monday. I went out the whole afternoon with parents to Ang Mo Kio and Whampoa. Hmmm...go AMK to shop and eat lor. First, we ate lunch.Iate the yong tau foo my brother keeps complimenting about. I hate it. For the simple fact that spring onions and fried onions were added into my mian! I HATE SPING ONIONS AND FRIED ONIONS! Nice to eat meh? So er xin the taste! I can't believe people would willingly pop them into their mouth. When seeing these things floating in my soup, I screamed. And trasferred them into my brother's soup. I said I would scream (at the stall, loudly too) if er xin objects were added. Er! Can't stand those people. Anyhow add garnishes without even asking. HELLO! People have different taste, thank you very much. That's why. I must bring my own stuff and not ask vendors to bring them themselves. This is one sure-fire way of preventing THOSE things into entering my soup.   Er-hmm. Enough about disgusting garnishes and automatic vendors. After eating, we went to Popular to buy textbooks for my brother. Woah!! The booklist is full of mistakes! Mostly mistakes on author's names. Wah! It caused some confusion when we are buying texts, but we solved the problem by comparing the publisher and price list with the list they displayed in Popular. Ha! I won by saying "Your booklist is completely biased! Why buy from there instead of Popular, where you can even get discount? 5% is a lot you know!" I think there's a conspiracy by the school bookshops around Singapore. They would deliberately change some things here and there to confuse parents from buying outside (and getting a discount). Sheesh. Only want to make money. How I know? This year hor, my parents brought my books from Popular (which is a few...the rest were brought in sec 3). The auntie was complaining non-stop about us buying from Popular. Sheesh. And below the booklist (my brother's) were the words "Please buy from school bookshops to ensure accuracy...". A-HA! This means that they are admitting that they deliberately changed booklist accuracy. In some words or so. Anyway, whatever. So long as there are people like me to spot "mistakes", the world would be a better place.  After that, we went to the library to borrow books. I borrowed some books on styles of writing and journalism. :) After that, we went to Whampoa to eat duck porridge. Wah lao! While my father is trying to park his car, some idiot driver hor....moved in front....then decide to move back. And caused a crash! It's only a minor fender-bender on my father's taxi, but the guy said it's not his fault! It's common courtesy to wait for a driver to park his car, then rush forward. Sheesh! These people are the ones causing road accidents everywhere! Okayy...we ate the delicious duck porridge! Heavenly! After that, we went to 933 in Balestier to buy back chicken (their chicken is heavenly too! Ditto for the sauce!).   Okay! After dinner, I watched TV then came online for a little while. Then, it's off to eat chilli crabs! The chilli taste great!! And the crab meat have much more taste than last time's (so bland!). Actually, I ate more chilli than I ate crab meat. HaHa! I always do! After that, watched Are You Hot, then Friends.  Wole up to a bright early Tuesday morning! I studied lets say...till chapter 16...I studied 8 chapters lor. Ha!! I am studying the last 6 tomorrow. I can cope la. 3 in the morning. 3 in the afternoon. Or whatever.   I invited WQ to come over to study in the afternoon. I am afraid he cannot concentrate. We studied from 1+ till 4. At 4, we cooked Mi Goreng (hate that favor). Hmm! Then, after that, we played PS2 lor. We played Need For Speed, which needless to say, I lost. How can I win against a racing talent? Okay, then we played X-Men. You know what? I lost most of the games...to a beginner. sigh! I keep depending on my powers....he keep using brute force. O.o! I lost uterrly using Storm. I won some using Phoenix. HaHa!! Both of them are so cool!   CQ smsed me. He's having a fever and he feels bad about not being able to study! Oh my! I called over immediately! I told him it would be okay! Must rest well and tomorrow study! Ah Ji! I have confidence in you, okay! Don't stress yourself out too much! Get well soon!  Alright....today Holland V a lot of developments! YanYan first don't like TianXiang, then agree to marry him even he says she don't need to. Then, she sad that she's marrying him, and flirts with XiaoXin. Today, JingJing met up with XiaoXin! Oh! How I wish both of them would be together!   Okay...I am currently playing a game with Wendy. It's something like we ask each other who we prefer (insert someone's name) or (another peron's name). Mostly are people in the entertainment industry. HaHa! She finished mine with Jewel. HaHa! I am still asking her! She's currently deciding between Aaron Carter or Westlife. Oh...Aaron won again. I must ask her more! Wahahaha!!   Alright! Gotta go now! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Heya! Sunday befalls on us like a day like no other.  Hmm...today morning was like other Sunday mornings, so I won't elaborate much. Today ws quite okay-ey type of morning.  I went to Wendy's house to study in the afternoon, as usual. I completed the chapters of differentiation and integration there. Two major important chapters completed! Woo-hoo! We cooked hot dogs and instant noodles too. Always eat there one. Ha!! Today, Wendy fell sick, so I made her sleep. I helped her to boil the water and pour into containers. HaHa! Hmmm...she seems pretty sick. Get lotsa rest hor. Get well soon for Bio exam, Wendy! After that leh, we went down to eat. This is one of my most fun times eating together. We laughed and talked a lot. HaHa!! :D   Came back, bathed and came online. I had to make this short...later no time to write le. I had to go watch Singapore Brainiest Teacher. See ya tomorrow!

      Hey hey!  Sorry for not updating yesterday. I was busy. With what? Ahh..tell ya later.  Hmm...overall for both days, I actually revised 4 A-maths chapter. And these 4 are done yesterday. Yeah yeah. I know. Screw me. But heck! I will sutdy hard tomorrow. And it's not gonna be an empty promise!  Okay...yesterday, my father did not work. Instead, he brought us out to breakfast. After that, we came back and laze around till lunch-time. You know, I like listening to my mother talk on the phone. She always curse her boss (lao-yao-guai) for being bitchy/unreasonable, or gossip about her colleagues with another colleaque (Yong Kee, I believe. She and my mom are the only part-time cashiers, and almost the same working hours.). So funny...hahaha!!   Okay, we had lunch at Admiralty Place, where I met Su Ping, Xue Lin and Clar. Waved hello and bye bye. HaHa! Oh oh! I brought my Makin Magic!! Oh my god! So cute! So cool! But I can't install it, cuase I need Superstar. However, I ain't getting one till Monday...so I placed my MM on top of my computer table. It looks nice like that. :) Oh oh! And guess what? My mom brought a PS2 for my brother! Can you believe it? I na't...she said she won't buy it. Ahh...but she still did. I wonder why. I think they struck lottery or something, but didn't tell us. Hmm!! And I picked up quite a few games too (free ones of course). Like X-Men, Harvest Moon. No FFX though. Awww. The X-Men game is cool! I love Storm! So beautiful. I learnt a move le...hmm! I wish there are more X-Men, like Jublilee or something. The Street Fighter game is cool too! I used the female fighters (Chun-Li) especially. And I was able to win! Woo-hoo! When I mentioned it to my friends (actually, only Wendy, XC and WQ), both Wendy and WQ exclaimed their jealousy. Thay's why leh, I didn't want to mention it at first one. In fact, I only mentioed I got a PS2 when I said I "gotta go play with brother". Meow!   Hmm...Survivor was a shocker. Andrew Savage got voted out. That's because Lil joined the Drake team to vote him off! Yeah. Lil and Burton joined the game! Woo-hoo! Predicted. Hmmm, can someone please vote Jon off?! I hate him. Ergh!   Okie...today, I went to Wendy's house to celebrate CQ's birthday! Yep! I arrived there at 12.53 (after lunch at 768 with family. Yep...Father didn't work today. I really wonder if they won lottery!). I was like talking with Wendy when WQ suddenly appeared in the doorway. Wah lao. Just stand there without helloing. HaHa! After that leh, we talk talk a bit, then I go down to buy cake with Wendy. I brought Lassie down too. She's so inquistive. Keep sniffing here and there. HaHa! I brought the same cake as we did for Arman. Then, we returned and we talk talk some more. Until Wendy remembered we didn't buy any drink. So, I went down to buy a large bottle of Ice Lemon Tea (CQ's fav). I have to walk all the way to 888's NTUC coz the shop downstairs has no ILT stocks. Then, I walked back, and just when I was about to press the lift button, guess who messaged? Ah Ji. He arrrived. Woah!! I groaned loudly (to the stares of the people near me).I had to walk back and from twice!! HaHa!! I met him, and guided him to Wendy's house.  Yep! The celebration begins! We began by presenting the cake and drinks. While doing so, WQ actually whipped out his digital camera and started taking pictures/videos! Cool! I put in the candles, and lit some of them. The rest Wendy lit. We sang the birthday song (in Chinese) for Ah Ji. He then made a wish and blew out the candles. Wee!! We then cut the cake into 4 separate parts and ate them lor. We attempted to shoot Ah Ji while eating. We did it after some success! HaHa! I washed the dishes after everyone's done.  After that, we played Chocobo Racing till 5. HaHa! That's the reason why I didn't revise today. And I told Wendy "I got my priorities right and would squeeze time to study a-maths tomorrow." Ha! And hor, I cannot win today leh! Why!! Why!! I lost to WQ, a very newbie you know. HaHa! It sounds like I am very revengeful and a sore loser. These 3 people ganged up against me you know. So unfair. Hmp! I am so jinxed today. Ha!   After returning home, guess what I saw on my desk?!! SUPERSTAR!! Oh god!!! I can install the Sims now!! Woo-hoo! After a very quick bath, I set to install my game. I tried defraging the disk and cleaning it, but I gave up after it failed thousands of time. I went ahead the installation without doing anything. And guess what? I was able to install properly! The patching system of Makin Magic, which supposedly takes 40 minutes, took me about 15 minutes! Woo! And you know what? No bugs at all! Woo-hoo! I never encountered any bugs. I think that's because Singapore makes the Sim games themselves. :) So cool! My Sims can finally make magic!   Alright! Gotta be going to play Sims! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Heya! Me-ow meow!!   Today's my E-Maths paper 2. Hmm.... it was quite easy to some extent. Yeah. It was an easy paper on the whole.I didn't know like 2 questions? And I skipped question 7, because I spent too much time on question 6. I sdidn't really skip la. I tried to do 7 last...I knew the question So easy. I managed to complete the first 2 questions of 7 only...wasted sia. How meowful!  Hmm...after that, I stayed back to get my O Level papers. Meow meow! It was a mad rush of paper grabbing, but somehow, (thank my lucky stars meow meow) I got my papers back! I even managed to get Siva's. Gonna give it back to her! Meow!!   After that leh, a whole big bunch of us went to shop for prezzies. For SL and Ji lor. First, Ji went with us to buy SL's present. Meow meow! After much arguments and opinions (and invitations to one's home to play games), we finally decided on Jenja (the building blocks). Now, we must get rid of CQ. And got rid of him we did. Hmm...you know...I originally wanted to buy some something special for CQ alone one...but due to the lack of monetary funds, I have to share. Meow meow! In the end, we brought him a ***** (cannot reveal...later he read how?! Will revel the ans on sat!). I am passing it to him on Sat, along with a cake, I think. Meow!  Woah!! I can't wait for Makin Magic! And Superstar!! Oh my god! Popular has a lot of stocks you know! But I am so afraid they will get sold out! I want them!! Ohh!! Makin Magic!!! I want you!  Meow meow! Coming back home, I went online, played some Sims and watched the news. Oh! Our school was featured in both the Channel 8 and U news! The Channel 8 reported a talk by secondary schools to prepare primary school kids seondary school life. Miss Govind was seen giving a talk to the Northland Primary kids. In the Channel U news, a crane fell at our Rioverside construction site, injuring and killing an Indian man respectively. Meow meow! My codolences.   After that, watched TV lor. Yay! I finally planned CQ's party! Meow!! That shy little duck! Too embarrassed to celebrate in his house! In the end, have to celebrate at Wendy's house lor. Ha! I always feel guilty, becuase I invite people to her house without consulting her first. I am afraid she will be pissed off ma, but she said no. And she's bathing Lassie, so she can be clean for the Low cats to play with. Meow!! Gonna be fun, yeah!   Hmm...I gotta end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

That makes 3 out of 4 family members working. And 1 freeloading cat (me!). Meow!! After thinking about the notion of getting a job, I do realise that I want to hold a job too.... I wonder if anyone would want to hire a short 16-year-old boy for a month only. Ha! Most probably not many. Meow? I think if I am applying, I am gonna go for a cashier job. Always wanted to be a cashier.    Hmm...I basically just studied a few E-Maths chapter, get tutored by the tutition teacher Maths. I also surfed the Net the whole day, then slept in the afternoon.

      Heya! Tuesday!  Okie...today we have English and Social Studies papers. Hmmm....meow.  English was easy, yeah. But hor, everytime I say English papers easy, I ended up getting a lousy mark. The composition ar, I was stuck between two choices. One is asking you to imagine how you and your friends lives would have changed 10 years down the road. The other was asking you to describe what happened when you cannot find the passport for your journey to overseas. I did considered both questions. I can't make up my mind to do which. Therefore, I turned to the trusty earser for help. Passport story was chosen. Hmm... I wonder if I did well. Hmm, you know. I could probably write the compo for the friends one next time. I wanna write that! The compre leh...was quite average-gy. The summary points were quite easy to pick up, but was quite hard to fit into a 160-word summary. Meow.  Woah!! The SS paper ar. Took me by surpirse! So difficult the questions. All the topics I learnt you know! But their phrasing of the questions took me by surprise I never seen these bfore lor. I kinda panicked...and wasted 10 minutes choosing questions. Oh god. Meow meow! In th end, I chose good governance. Yeah...came up with crap la. SBQ was quite easy. Yeah. I seen the techinques before, so I cna answer lor. Woah lao! I am really hoping for History to save my Humane! Meow meow!  Okie...it's getting kinda late. I am ending this blog le. See ya tomorrow.

      Meow!! I aqm here! Ahh!!! The first day of the Os. How meowful!  Hm! Today we are tested on E-Maths and Physics. Woah!! Both papers leh, can be said easy on the general side. Yeah. Both of them have something in common: extremely easy for the first 2/3 of the paper, but the last 1/3 is very very tough. Woah!!   E-Maths was okay...I don't know the only about 3 questions ba. Kinda easy the paper. I never saw one question before, the other question got me muddled (similar triangles! They aren't similar at all! How to find, you tell me?). Meow meow!!  Physics was very easy compared to Prelims. Miss Tan sets papers 2-3 grades higher than O Level standard. That's a good thing, if you ask me. When we see the O Level paper, we won't get scared easily, because we been through a lot of Miss Tan's papers. Yeah. As again, the Section A's questions were extremely straight-forward. Mostly calculations, with few (and simple) theory questions. Section B was a killer. Not really, but the difficulty level can be compared to Miss Tan's. However, all are theory questions. Just apply what you learn can liao. Meow!! I felt happier you know. It gave me optimism to do the Chem Paper! Must maintain high Chem marks, and get more Physics marks. Then 'A' will be mine!! Meow meow!!  Hmm...today leh, I got a bit scared you know. Mrs Thong lor! Tell us so many consequences. What if I fail English? Actually, I don't think I'll fail. The least is a C6. The best mark I can get is B3, if I am lucky, A2. I certainly don't want a 6! Must at least get a B you know. I must be extra carfeul with tenses and the answering of questions. Must be stringent in my checking!!   SS ma, I have confidence I can do well. Hmm...it really have to depend on the questions that are coming out. I think I can at least secure a distinction lor. I just want an A1 for Combined Humane! Must you know! M-U-S-T!!   Hmm...tomorrow's gonna be a killing day on my finger, espeically the fourth finger on my right hand. That's where the pen lies, and it will hurt badly. I have to write 3 freaking papers tomorrow, each invloving at least an essay (summary for compre...and 2 drafts too!). I pity my finger. I am borrowing a finger band from Wendy. Meow!  Ayiah. I think I stop writing liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

Hmm...I studied all the remaining E-Maths chapters, and revised Physics. Meow meow! I think Physics is okay le ba...I am atill unsure about my E-Maths though...I revise some more tomorrow morning lor.  After revision, I lazed around lor, waiting for Wendy's mother to come back so we can go down to eat. I slept halfway, but woke up after hearing myself snore. So embarrassing. Meow meow. Both of us then lazed around lor. Wendy had a terrible stomach ache. I told her to go rest, she don't want. Meow!! Get well soon hor.   Her mother came back, and after a while, took us down fof dinner. HaHa! Her mother treated me Vanilla Coke today, but she refused to let Wendy drink becuase of her stomach. Ooo! Wendy always felt her mom always treats me better than her ("You are like a spoilt brother that I never had"). Meow!! Not my fault! She should discuss this with her mother. Meow! Anyway, I brought back Wanton Mee for brother.   When I came back, Uncle Steven was there. He came to repair my brother's computer. Meow!! I took a bath and came online.   Aiyah. I am kinda scared and nervous. Tomorrow's O Levels leh. We have been waiting for this moment for 4 years! 4 freaking years! And it finally arrived! Oh my! Best of luck to me tomorrow! :)  Alright..I think I stop blogging. To those who are reading this: Good luck for your Os! May you socred grades that you are proud of! :) See ya tomorrow!

      Ohh!!! 1st November. First day of the meowing month! Forgot to mention yesterday: Happy Halloween!  Yesterday hor, the Survivor episode was cool!! The 'ghost tribe' of castaways Survivor came back to vie for positions back into the game! They called themselves the Outcasts! I fully supported the OutCasts man! In the end, they won you know!! Coolies! The Drake had to kick Shawn out, becuase they saw him less of a threat than Jon. Morgan...surprise surprise! No voting! First time in Survivor History, did a Survivor surrendered and got his torch extinguished without a vote! Oh my my!!    Yes yes! Topday's a meowing Sat. Woke up at 8 something, took a bath, went online, ate breakfast and watched cartoons. Meow!! I ate lunch at 12.30.  You know what?!! The Sims: Making Magic is out!!! Oh my god!! The Sims can make magic!!! I have been waiting for this moment!!! Meow meow meow!!! However, I need Superstar to install Making Magic. I want all the expansion packs ma....must install in order you know. Parents say they would buy for me next week! Wee....or not. Cannot play!!! Must study!! Cannot install!! So torturous.  Okay...I went to Wendy's house to study SS and Physics. WQ went along too. I told him to meet at the busstop when he arrives. I went up to Wendy's house first. We chit-chatted, then WQ smsed me to go down.  The idiot!! Called me when he's still in the bus! Made me so mad. I thought of letting Lassie bite him. Meow meow! And he's so apprehensive. Walked so slow behind. When he heard Lassir barking at us as we approach Wendy's house, he got scared. Silly cat!! He made Wendy hold Lassie when he comes in, and refused to go near Lassie. Ayiah! Must let the dog familiarise your smell ma! Cute dog!   We studied today! I completed my Physics and Social Studies revision! Finally!! Meow meow!! I noticed that me and Wendy talked less often today. Felt weird. Actually, I expected that. A 'stranger' venutring into 'our terrority'. I felt that WQ felt left out lor, coz me and Wendy were like trying to talk about topics that are kinda sensitive. Meow meow!!  After studying, Wendy cooked instant noodles for us. As usual, I sweated a lot. Meow!! They said I am not like any normal human being! Meow meow!! Wendy's mother said "good what!". HaHa!! After eating, we studied further. After studying leh, I went on to write a letter to Bright. Yeah la. Write to him, say my last words.  At 5.45, I went off. The sky is extremely dark! And I am very stupid. I shoulda walked. I could get home in 10 minutes. But no!! I took the bus. And ended up waiting for 15 minutes for the bus. I am so kicking myself for this!  I came back to an empty house. It looks like my father went with my brtoher to redeem his 8250 handphone my brother won in the arcade. Anyway, took a bath, watched TV and ate dinner. After that, came online lor.  I gotta be going le. See you tomorrow. Night blog!

      HaHaHa!  The last entry for the year 2003. Thuis year sure came quick. Very quick. I remember us in January, saying things like "Ayiah...O Levels 11 months away...long long time la!". Ha! Now we are in December, the Os has past us. What an eventuful year. There are sure a lot of surprises.   I am listening to Perfect 10's Top 100 Countdown. HaHa. Now I listened till number 91 (1pm). Coolies. HaHa. There's a lot of 'tops' features, like Top 10 News Headlines of 2003. The top headline is SARS in Singapore. O.o How newsworthy.  HaHa. This paragraph is gonna get ugly, 'cause there's someone I want to critisize bad. Ha. You would have gussed by now that someone must be WQ. Yes. What a sore loser. Sore with a capital S. That idiot tried to tell me the songs that were coming up next, which I did not appreciate at all la. Therefore, I threatened that wuss with a secret of his (it was that shocking thing I noticed. yes, it was HIS. Now. There you know). Refusing to tell him what was it about and who else knew, he immediately blocked me on his Messenger. (Ayiah, he threatened me with "tell me or else.." I replied back with "or else what? I am not scared by your threats". I expected a blockage, so it came as no surprise.) Worthless arse. Sigh.... Such pettiness. Such idiocry. Such attitude. I doubt he can make it far in life (or even in JC or Poly. Seriously. Neither type of instituition suits him. Come to think of it, neither does ITE. He'll get beaten up within the first second. Forget about CIs. If he can't fit into JC, what makes you think he can fit into CIs?). Tsk tsk tsk. Shape up! Lose your loser attitude! (I doubt he's gonna listen. He's too thick-skinned to.) See la. 2003 ends on a sour note. How sour. (Whoever pisses me off with definitely incur my wrath. A lot of people has learnt that, especially WQ, who has learnt it multiple times. And WQ, forget about rebutting. Your rebuttals are lame. You don't even know how to rebutt properly. I'd love to see ya try though. It's always fun arguing.)  Hmm...oh yes. You must be wondering why I am blogging so early. HaHa. I dunnoe. I just felt like it lor. Tonight have no mood to blog ba. HeHe. (Psst...the above para...I think it's the longest para of this entry. O.o!)  Hmm...dunnoe what to write le la. I guess I'll just end off la. See ya next year! Byes!!

      Hey hey! Tuesdays! Oh my moo moo!  Yesterday, we had champagne. HaHa. Not actually champagne la. Sparkling juice. It was what....a blue cocktail. Yeah. HaHa. It was sweet. It gets too sweet after a few gulps. HaHa. What a wonderful experience.   Hmm...today morning was spent in boredom again. Eat, go online....HaHa.   In the afternoon, I went to play bball with the usual gang again. HaHa. The weather is so strange. The sun is so shiny...yet there's rain. Rain for a few minutes, then stop. Strange weather cats! Our Earth is self-destructing!! (Stop jumping to mad conclusions, KY!!) We waited for XC...then went to another court. The court we were eyeing is full of chao Ah Lians (and Bengs) and idiotic cats who everytime ask people to match against them (like we are so free!!) and later siam people out of the court (terrible! they must be murdered!).  HaHa. I noticed something shocking. (Cannot say ar!!! Or else, I would incur the wrath of this cat) HaHa! I can tell you ar, it's very the shocking lor! HaHa. I told Ah Ji what I noticed, he don't believe me at first. After witnessing it, he was also very surprised! HaHa! Such a surprise...I refused to believe my eyes at first, but after making multiple checks, the truth was confirmed. Xiao shu lin wor!! HAHA!  HaHa. we played at the court where there's absolutely no shade. HaHa. The sun was so overbearing. HaHa. We took two breaks. HuiMin, Joyce and Gao Luan joined us later in the game. HAHA. During the game, I caused delibearte annoyance towards WQ (thwarting his scheme, hitting him, taking his ball..muhahaha). He tried to annoy me using the same way (what else? caused me bodily damage la). Ha! Revengeful fool. Like I am gonna stop 'annoying'. You know me better than that. Ha!  HaHa. Two girls joined us, wanting to make a 6vs6 game. They were quite small la. HaHa. Gloria said don't underestimate them because of their size. She's right. The smallest girl ended up on my team, and boy, she sure is powerful. Cool moves man! Like a pro. I wondered from whom did she learn from. Her old brother? Her father? (Such curiosity). We played till 5 something.  HaHa. I came back and sorted through my presents. I left them all lying around. HaHa. My mom said she would throw everything away tomorrow if I don't sort out my presents. HaHa. I put them all in their rightful place. O.o!   HaHa. Hmm.....tomorrow I must tune in to Perfect 10's Top 100 Countdown. From 12 noon to 10pm. Ahh! I must listen to which song got top! This should be interesting! HaHa...  Ah well. I think I am stopping here le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow meow meow! Sunday meows!  Hmm...today morning the same old same old lor. Watch cartoons, programmes and went online. We ate macoroni for lunch. O.o!!  Later in the afternoon, me and WQ went to Changi Airpot. We had this crazy idea yesterday. HaHa. We are going there to walk around lor. For fun. You say we bo liao right? HeHe. We took bus 858 there, a journey totalling 57 minutes (WQ timed the trip. HaHa!).    We arrived in Terminal 1 and started walking around lor. Quite empty...until I saw a group of people (mainly Chinese) sitting around the Departure Hall. Obviously, they are waiting for their plane, and given their looks, they are going to China. HaHa. Inference inference!  We took the skytrain towards Terminal 2. That's way way bigger than Terminal 1 and more cats. We explored that place, walking from the basement till the top floor. At the Viewing Mall, I saw the planes taking off. I was awed by their majesty. Such a whole load of metal parts can actually glide through the air. I am such a suagu right?  HaHa...the thought really awed me lor.  After that, we went to Burger King to eat. I can't afford a meal, so I brought a single burger, BBQ Bacon something something. Wah...so hot, and sticky. HaHa. We set off home lor, taking the same bus.  I dopped off near 768 to buy dinner back for me and brother. I brought zhap fan, he brought yu pian mi fen. I ate dinner, watched TV, bathed and came online lor.   Sigh....yesterday and today so much things happened. I cannot write here....I badly want to tell you lor, but can't. I write in my diary book instead la.... Sigh lor...  I remembered a song in the shower. It's from The Truth About Jane and Sam, Zhen Xin Hua. It goes like this: Xi Huan Ni, Xiang Ai Ni, Xiang Shuo Zhen Xin Hua (Like you, Love you, Wanna Tell The Truth). I just thought of it lor....haha.... ~goes singing that line~  I think I am going le.

      Heya! Saturday moo meows!  Today leh, I accompanied WQ to PJC ask for his appeal results. HaHa. They said they haven't process the appeals yet. This was what I predicted. HaHa. So kan cheong.   After that, we went to LJS's to eat. As usual, the cashiers tried to qiao zha me. I said "small drink" in a tight voice. HaHa.   Me and WQ were late for meeting with Hann. Me, Hann, WQ and XC were going to Tampines to buy YH's bag. HaHa. We took 969 to Tampines Central. Yao shu lor!! On the bus, Hann acuused me of liking Ji. He said the signs were obvious. I suddenly said "Where got obvious signs?"! Oh my god! They took it to mean that I admitted I like Ji! I originally meant to ask what were the signs. Die la die la! It will spread to Ah Ji one!! Si le la!  We went to Tampines to buy bag. Tampines Mall, I think. Hann went into this shop called The Wallet Shop. After a fair bit of choosing, XC and Hann chose the same bag. But alas! The store has only 1 stock of the colour they wanted (black and white). However, at the Heeren, they did have stock. Therefore, YH and XC wanted to go Heeren. Me anmd WQ don't want. After eating at a food court, we went our separate ways.  Me and WQ went to shop for his wallet. Shop till 4.15, then WQ went to eat some more. Rou chuo mian, that's what it's called. We took 969 bus home at 4.30. I read my book and also slept there. HaHa. All of the passengers, save for a few, were sleeping. HaHa. Such a funny sight.   I came back home, watched TV and ate dinner. Tada. Here I am. I think I gotta go liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night!

      Oh my my my!!! 4 days of no blogging!!! O.o! Miss ya so much! Let me start from Monday, in choronoligcal order.   MONDAY   HaHa. I didn't blog because I was very lazy. HeHe. Okay, the morning was pretty boring. In the afternoon, I went swimming with Ben. Ahh...long long long time never go swimming le. HaHa. Feel kinda awkward for awhile...even forgotten the strokes for awhile. HaHa!   After swimming, I went to Cuaseway Point to buy the remaining presents (Amanda's, exchange's and EC's). I brought every single of them at Metro, the Trim shop where Wendy works. HaHa. Go and bother her. Her colleague said I am like a primary school kid. HeH.  When I came back, I recieved a shocking news. Tina, along with the chalet food, is taking my father's taxi to the chalet tomorrow. I was like, wtf.... I thought I told them I am not bringing the food, and MeiYing said they will bring there themselves. I am also quite pissed off lor....but in the end, agreed to fetch Tina and the food la.   After that, went to watch Friends and went to sleep (it was the longest sleep I had in two days. Tell ya why later.)   TUESDAY   Chalet day! HaHaHa! Yeah...I met Ben and HuiMin at 10 (they came to my house), Fathe fetched us, the whole lot of group to chalet (we picked Tina and food up along the way). We reached there at about 10.30++ la.   Hm...the chalet was a bit cramped. A short while later, they went to rent bikes/skates. Manda, Wendy, Ben, HM and LeYu all rented something. Me, Hann and KeYun didn't rent anything.   We went to eat lunch at a nearby foodcourt. We shared a herbal chicken and some noodles. HaHa. Eat eat there, and then talk. After eating, the three of us went to the beach to look at the sea, talk and relaxed. I forgotten what we talked about le, but it was very relaxing. HaHa. I felt like a kinda a bond between us. Possibly from us going to church together ba... HaHa. I like that kind of feeling.   After lazing around, we went back and saw a Channel U filming in progress. I don't know for what show la. Just watched them filmed lor. After that, just played things here and there. Talk with Amanda, HM and Ben in the pool (Amanda tried to splash water at me several times, and I was hit. HAHA!), watched people played pool.  XiaoXi and SuPing came to chalet! After a fair bit of milling around, we had a bright idea to rent a MahJong set to play with. There are some stores that rent MahJong for us to play. With that in mind, we excitedly went out to rent MahJong set. After renting, we picked up CQ and WQ, who just came.   Soon, the MahJong set delievered. Me, XiaoXi, SuPing, Hann and Wendy started playing MahJong. We took turns to play la. Ohter people joined in too, like KaiLun, JinHong and WeiLin. (That WQ critisized my playing techniques! Excuse me! As a MahJong player, I know what I am doing. I got my unique set of strategies! Ha! These helped me hu a lot of times okay!!) We played until 10+ (from 4+pm). I hardly had anything to eat. I only ate noodles and chicken wings (thanks Ah Ji again). I hued quite a little. HaHa.  We present exchanged. I got John's present (a monkey). Ah Ji and WQ had to go back first, so I collected their prezzies for them. I got a book from Wendy and Amanda, a box full of foods and goodies from Ke Yun, a Harry Potter owl from Chun. Thanks gals!!   After a short while, all of us went to the beach. We looked at the stars shining in the sky. We pointed to our stars and wish something on it. :D We looked out to the sea and feel it's calmness. We sang songs. HaHa. I was smsing Benjamin how to come here when everyone shouted! It turned out that they saw a shooting star. Darn!! I missed it! O.o!! I felt so ke xi. Sigh.... At 11++, we went back to the chalet.   WEDNESDAY   Ahh...Wednesday came so fast. We went back to chalet. We were supposed to pack the Christmas tree and go to sleep. Alas, we were distracted by the MahJong tiles. So, we played MahJong lor. HaHa. Wendy mentioned that when I hu right, I got a tone of cockiness. HaHaHa. I am like just happy that I hu lor. Huing is very hard you know. HaHa. I sure never notce....so O.O!   Around 3+, people started to get drunk. Andi was drunk first. Then Faiz. Oh my god. That was the start of the horror that would huant us until the end of the chalet. Okay....Hann was in danger. KeYun saw drunk Faiz coming and told Hann to go up the room and lock himself in. Luckily he managed to do so, or else he would have been beaten up. Sensing danger, Wendy told us all to go up. I practically ran up to the room. I am in danger. Hello! I am always being bullied by him. I am in mortal danger.  After Wendy pulling in JunZhong (he was being punched by Faiz), she locked the main doors. All of us were in the room lor, being safe and protected. I called XiaoXi they all (they were at the beach), telling them not to come back becaase of Faiz. Wei Lin in there was blaming himself, because he encouraged them to drink. He wants to apologize all of us and we forgiving him before he can go to sleep (he was drunk, but not really drunk). We never blamed him for this lor, yet he felt very guilty. I gained a whole new understanding and respect for Wei Lin. All of us said that we forgive him and encouraged him to rest. Meanwhile, that drunkard started hitting things at the door, wanting to break up the door. After some commotions, more door hitting, security guards came. They stopped the commotion.  Oh my god. The porch was in a mess. He threw noodles, mahjong tiles, even charcoal at the door. Terrible! We were ordered by the person-in-charge to clean up la. He even threw MahJong tiles everywhere, including the pool. Idiot. It took quite a while but everything was cleaned. We finished at about 6+am lor. One MahJong tile went missing, and not found.   Ya know...all of us felt pretty angry lor. He has to drink and spoil everyone's mood. Such an irresponsible idiot. He even cracked Amanda's phone, destroying it. Ergh! A lot of us hates him lor.   At 7, we went out. Me, Wendy and Ben were waiting for my father to fetch us. Ergh. We went out to the lobby to wait for my father (idiot person said cannot sleep there. toot!). At 8+, he arrived. There's a jam at the highway or something. As the car drives out, Madonna's Profusion is playing. It's so coincidential that the same song was playing when we are entering the chalet. HaHa.   I slept on the journey. We dropped Wendy off at Causeway Point and Ben at his house. Dad took me to eat breakfast at 768 (fried carrot cake) and fetched me home. HaHa. He didn't want to work anymore. After a nice long bath, I went to sleep.   I slept for 3 hours, from 10 to 1. HaHa. I woke up, still tired, but had to wake up. Parents brought back chicken rice, so I ate that for lunch. I went online for awhile, then set off le. I went to Wendy's house first to put the christmas tree back, then onwards to Cuaseway Point to meet XC.   He's like 55 minutes late. I am so glad I brought my Reader's Digest along, so I read about half the book while waiting for him. When he arrived, we went to buy presents. We then met Huimin, where she shopped for my present (for Melvin). Later, Mel arrived, then followed by EC and Ben. Me and EC exchanged prezzies. All of us travelled to Orchard, where we are gonna eat Seoul Garden.   We had to wait quite a while before we gets seats, but never mind la. As long as we got seats. We ate from 7 till 9.30. HaHa. We grilled meat, ate some soup thingys, and keep refilling our cups. Wah...I fell so bloated. HaHa. I owe XC $15, because he helped me pay for the meal. HaHa.   After coming out of Seoul Garden, we found a seculded spot and began our presents exchange. HaHa. I got a cup from EC, a photo frame from HM, some acessories from XC (whihc includes a bag, some handphone chains), a cat mug from Ben and a cat plushie from Melvin. HaHa.   After that leh, we squeezed through Orchard. Oh my god. It was sure damn crowded. Squeeze squeeze until the MRT. Me, Ben, XC and Mel took the train to City Hall, where Ben met his mother. He went to the hotel with his mom, while the three of us milled around waiting for him. When he finally did arrived, it was midnight. YaY! Merry Christmas!   THURSDAY   We went to Mel's place to play MahJong. Tong xiao MahJong. HaHa. We played with money. Darn. I cannot object. I have no money whatsoever. HaHa. One of my biggest win is the hand with 7 pairs. Everyone gives me $3.20. HaHa. but darn, I lost most of it when I hu wrongly. Darn darn darn!!! I lost all interest in playing then. I was bankrupt le la.  I left Mel's place at 7.30. Me and XC took 913. I went back to my house, took a bath and went to sleep. I hardly even have energy to eat breakfast. HaHa. Again, I slept for 3 hours, from 10 to 1. So, in total, I slept for 6+ hours in 2 days. That's an record! HaHa!   After waking up, I watched my recorded tapes. I only managed to complete watching the Ben Yue episodes and Charmed. I'll watch the rest later la.   After tape watching, I went online and surfed the Net. I then went for dinner, watched TV, and tada. I am here blogging.  I apologize if everything sounds very rushed, espeically at the end. I am very darn tired. I even got some anger to vent, but I guess I'll have to do it tomorrow. Ayiah, what else would anger me so greatly other than WQ's foul mouth and his stupid words? Don't even use his brain to think for a slightest bit before saying out inappopiriate things.   Alright, I think I am going le. See ya tomorrow. A very good night, blog!

      Heya! Sunday!  I just came back from watching Brainest Teen. HaHa. One of the final contestant chose Billboard Top 100 as a specialist subject. That's quite a tough subject, unless you are very very informed of the music industry. Another contestant had a poor memory and did not remembered where his boards were. Oh meow!   Hmm... I didn't have much problems with my specs. I got comfortable with the vision thingy, no giddiness or anything. However, the two support-thingys that rests on my bridge of the nose actually made two marks on my nose. I think my specs are too tightly pressed to my nose le. Ergh.  Hmm...today I made 4 pages of my web! Weee.... at least I did something. HaHa. I am such a lazy cat.   Okay, today I was supposed to help MeiYing they all carry goods to Wendy's house. Take note of supposed. I did not help in the end. I can't leave the house and leave my brother all alone at home. Sigh...I can only offer directions to Wendy's house. They also said I will be delivering the food there too. I said I can't. My father is very annoyed that he has to scarifice his working hours (money-making time, to be exact) to fetch me there. I am not even sure he's fetching me back (How to take Wendy's christmas tree back? Never mind. I carry it on the train.). I can't demand more by telling him to pick up food at Wendy's house. Sigh... And hor, I don't know how I can manage to carry so MANY things down from my house to the cab. Have to make lotsa trips. Ben is helping, so is HuiMin (I think...). I think I am selfish by complaining. Just suddenly felt guilty for complaining so much. After all, I promised to help. I just never expected there're so many things lor. HaHa.  Hmm....I think that's all I have to say la. Darn. I haven't watched my recorded 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Daughter yet. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey. I know, I said just now that I am not posting. I can't resist not telling you what happened.  Okay...I got my new pair of specs. (I hear "Cheh! So surprising meh?"s) I felt so giddy. The lens this time were made to fit my new degrees (which increased 200 degrees), therefore, my eyes/brain were not used to it. Ergh...and you think I shouldn't blog and strain my eyes. Ha.   Oh my god. I am having stomach upsets these days. I visit the toilet at least 3 times a day just to clear my bowels you know!! I don't know what caused it lor. The things I ate are those I ate often, and nothing happened in the past. Ergh....  I have so many medical ailements. My chest hurts so much now. Specifically, my left chest. Last time, it hurts only about once or twice a month. Today, the strains happened throughout the entire day. Initially, I thought it was my heart. I could be having a blocked coronary artery. However, WQ told me his brother experienced the same symptoms too (and thought it was heart problems), but he found out that one of his lungs collapsed! Oh my god! Thankfully, the doctor said it coould be recovered. Now, WQ's brother had recovered lor. On the plus side, no strenous work, i.e. PE, can't be performed during the period of recovery. I don't know lor. I must go to see a doctor about this. Take a x-ray too.  However, complications arose. You see ar, my parents intend to do it on Monday. Monday I had chalet. I cannot delay the checkup. The strains are getting worse. However, I promised Wendy I would go to the chalet. This is like breaking a promise. I made Wendy happy for nothing. Sigh. A very difficult choice. I must discuss with Wendy later on. I am not gonna like the discussion. Neither is she.   I think I am ending le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Oh hey!   Thousands apologies for no blogs yesterday. I hardly had enough time and energy left. *YAWNS* See what I mean?  HaHa. As I said in my Thursday blog, I went to CHC. That's for later. Let me narrate what happened in the afternoon first.  Okie...in the afternoon (morning? No need to narrate la...so boring and typical. Oh yes. I completed a page of my web. Wee!), I went out to shop for christmas prezzies. I only had enough moolah to spend for the music students and Wendy. Hmm... I shan't reveal what I brought, cause some of them do read my blog. In total, I brought about $27 worth of prezzies. Oh, WQ came along also. He even lied about the time, making it one hour later. Qi shu lin! I was so darn angry... I thought his legs were tired and just wanna go home early. How irresponsible! Later, he said he saw the time wrongly. Hmm..... How can see the number "2" for "4"? And on 1something, he said it was 3something. I smell something fishy!!!!  Hm..I went home surfed the net, ate some noodles. Then, I set my way towards Causeway Point, meeting my friends at 6pm. It looks like Ke Yun came along also. Coolies! Another non-Christian cat!  We met there and went down to the Interchange to wait for the bus. HaHa! After waiting for so so long, it was announced that the bus was upstairs instead. Thereofre, we trudged up and towards the bus.   In the bus, YH sat with KY, XX sat with moi. XiaoXi introed me to this guy, Zi Wei ar. ZW supposedly knew me from primary school, but I don't recongize him at all leh! I can't place him....probably from 4/1 ba. I must ask Esther who he is. On the bus, I just read my book (Oh! Today, I brought Truths and Consequences, yet another Charmed book).   We finally arrived there. We first had to go up to 3rd floor (Hann pressed the 'down' button and was scolded by an idiot. He didn't know okay!!). Then, we had to queue up and get sorted here and there. HaHa. We finally got seats. Only me, Hann and KY though. The rests have to seat on the aisle. Felt kinda guilty.   I didn't realize how close we are to the speakers until they started singing worship songs. Woah!! So loud sia. Of course we didn't sing la. We just clapped along to the rhythm (must at least respect them...). After songs, they talked a little about their programs and introed HYS.   Her songs were okay la. We three bopped along to her songs HaHa. She sang about 6 songs, sghe told us her story. As a teenager experiencing depression and how she accepted Christ into her life. It was quite touching lor. I conveniently left out the part about asking us to try to accept Christ. HaHa. After that le, it was another priase song. This time hor, i can only see me, KY and Hann waving our lightsticks. The rest were just hlding their hands up in the air and prasing him. The cameraman focused on us. We are really too obvious. HaHa. Somemore, during prayer, we did not close our eyes. That Pastor Kong lied. He said "If you are sinners, backsliders, please raise your hand to accept Christ". We did no such thing, of course. However, when hands were raised, he said "I see hundreds! thousands! lots!". However, we three say very litttle hands raised. Not even amounting to half a hundred. Ha.  After service ended, we milled around and went out to wait for the chartered bus. Me, KY and Hann discussed what we experienced la. KY told us some ghosts stories, some Buddhist stories (we have to keep our voices low...we don't want to offend the whole busload of Christians). We took the chartered bus towards Woodlands Interchange, where I went off first.   Overall, the concert thingy was fun. I enjoyed myself. HeHe. Hann smsed me and thanked me for accompanying him. :)  Okay....Sat now. Hmm...Just now nothing happened lor. Just ate and watched TV. WQ wrote a very touching testimony for my Friendster. O.o!! Go check it out. Tonight, we are drinking sparkling champagne. HaHa. Mother brought 4 bottles. HaHaHa.  I think that's today's blog la. Quite short for today, I know. Almost nothing to say ma. So see ya tomorrow! Bye blog!

      Heya blog! Today's Thursday meow meow!  Hmm...today left my aching all over. HaHa. I played basketball with the usual gang from Tuesdy, minus PY and add in Sheng Qiang and SuPing. HaHaHa.   We met at 10am.... ha ha ha! Only me, SuPing, Gloria and CQ came there early. The rest were all late. We waited till 10.30 or so before we can finally go play bball.   We played and played till about 12.30 lor. Some interesting things happened. My toenail got chipped after i smashed my toe into XC's sandals. A girl from Marsiling Secondary joined us, presumably after getting her N Level results. SuPing left mid-game to go to her job interview.   Hm...me, SQ, Hann, CQ and XC went to a nearby foodcourt to eat. WQ went back to his house and Gloria followed Joyce to her house to eat. I ate the what, main fen guo. Ha. Not as good at 768's. HaHa. (Even though they added stupid garnishes once. Idiots!)  AFter lunch, we went back to the bball court to wait for everycat to gather. We started playign ABC. HaHa! All I can say is: I made major impovements. I graduated till the middle of the court le. Last time, the furtherest I can go is the 'B' line. HaHa! Soon, everybody gathered and we played bball lor. WE played till there's a downpour and we had to shelter.  WE suggested going to WQ's house to play. HaHa. Everybody went up to his house, despiste the reluctance of WQ's. We went there, cleaned our hands and feet and played la. We mainly played poker cards. We played BlackJack, Heart Attack and Murderer. Murderer is so fun! At the last round, I pretended to be the Medic and 'save' CQ. It turns out that he's the medic! HaHa! So fun to confuse cats.   Me, Gloria and Joyce went back first. Me and Gloria walked all the way to Causeway Point to take the 913 bus home. HaHa. The ground was so dirty...my feet were stuck with sand particles. Eee...so uncomfortable.   I came back, bathed, ate dinner and watched TV. I felt kinda feverish also. HaHa. I watched "Everybody Wins". HaHa. Quite funny la. Ehh! Next week's episode got Bao Mei Li. Must watch ar!!  HMm....I am going to CHC tomorrow for the HYS concert. Ah...it would be an enriching experience, cause I haven't been there for about 1++ years. Ha...see what's changed lor. I am also going there to have fun with Hann and XiaoXi. HaHa.  Hmm...sigh. It looks like I am always getting an arugment with WQ. My blog is biased, by the way. Because it contains what I thinks. Duhz. It's MY blog. It is supposed to be biased. Some people need to think more before saying a statement. Sigh.....moo meow meow.   Okay.I think I go liao la. Gotta go le. See ya tomorrow.

      Heya!!  Oh my god! Today the results of our PAE posting came out!! Guess where I when to? Clue: Happy news. You guess AJC Sci? Nah...no la. HAHA! The correct answeris: PJC Science!! Woo-hoo! I am so so so happy! My wish came through! HAHAHA!! CQ, YH and PY are going to PJ too! Woo-hoo! Yao shu lor!! HeHe!!   WQ, however, did not get into PJ. He got into YJ. He's so totally upset aobut it. Hmm...so I suggested to him to go appeal to get into PJC. If he failed, at least he tried, right? It was I who persuaded him too. HaHa. So, therefore, I am accompanying him to PJ to appeal.   After lunch, I met WQ at Woodlands MRT at 1pm. We travelled Choa Chu Kang MRT Station, where we took a bus to some bus stop near PJ. HaHa. I was feeling so darn nervous, more nervous than the applicant. I was imaginging we had to speak to the principal ma, and as WQ don't have much of eloquence, I had to do the talking. I was so nervous.  Crazy old me. I even called CQ to try to soothe myself. We had to sign ourselves in, and then go into the General Office. We stood around for awhile, then one of the staff came to us to help. You know what? All WQ had to do is fill up some forms and wait for the approval to results! Made me worried for nothing. Ohn yeah WQ: Good luck for your approval! :)  After that, we went to Lot 1 to eat LJS. Mainly WQ eat la. I ate some fries and read my Harry Potter book. After that, he came to my house to play PS. HaHa. He left at 5 something.  Ya know, I was watching Ben Yue as usual. There's this short little animation about Hou Yi shooting down 9 suns. HaHa! That reminded me of the performance that I participated in while in Primary 5. That year, my school was holding a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration. There was this performance about Hup Yi shooting down the 9 suns. i signed up as a performer and got the part of one of the 9 suns. I can still remember the actions! The suns had to stand up on chairs. Once a sun was shot down, the respective actor/ess had to turn back, twirl around and land on the floor. HaHa! So fun man! Ahh...the gold ole days! :D  Hm...today, I started eating gua zi. So fun man! Biting the melon seeds, hearing the crack sounds and eating the white thingy. So fun! That's the whole idea of eating gua zi ma. WQ said he's too lazy to open up the shells, and hope in the future all the seeds will be opened (using a machine) already for sale. I say, that idea is one of the most silliest things I heard. Part of the fun of eating gua zi is opening them yourself by biting. Ayioh...if anybody dares to sell opened gua zi, I'll bet they will have low sales. Seriously. Would you buy an already opened gua zi? I wouldn't, for sure!  Hm...later got Charmed, Naughty Nymphs. I think I am ending this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya!   Oh my god!! Sandra won!! HaHaHa! I predicted either Sandra, Christa, Rupert or Lillian to win earlier on. Hmm..what happened was that Lillian won Immunity and had to choose between Jon and Sandra. Now, if she chose Jon, she would have won easily(it was proven correct when during the Reunion, the Jury said they would vote Lil to win if she took Jon along). But no. She chose Sandra, because Sandra, like Lil, is a wife who has to support her family. That's a choice of integirty, but however, it costs Lil US900k. Hmm...Sandra won by 6-1 vote (the extra vote was Tijuana's). Hmm...actually. I don't mind who won who lost. As long as my predicted cat won can liao. HeHe. I am so looking out for All-Stars Survivor! Woo-hoo! Rupert and Shii Ann is appearing again! Yay! Can't wait!!  Hmm...today leh, I carried a whole hell of a lot of things into my house. First, me and Wendy carried her Christmas tree to my house at 1something. That tree was to be tansported into the chalet, with courtesy of my father.   After tree transportation, me and Wendy went to meet Gloria at the 911 busstop. Wendy is going to Causeway Point, while me and Gloria are going to play basketball.      Hmm, we went there and met CQ, Joyce, PY and Hann. Soon, XC and WQ joined us at the basketball court. We travelled long and far to search for a empty (or at least, half-empty) basketball court to play in. We found one near the Woodgrove thingy (and where Amanda stays) and started playing.  HaHa. We played only for a short while until we complained it was too hot. Me and XC went to Woodgrove's NTUC to buy drinks for everybody. HaHa! We walked back, took some gulps of drinks and continued playing. This time, we played full court. Run here, run there and soon, after 6 minutes, everybody is tired and we rested. After that, we continued playing until it rains.   We ran to Choy Kee in Woodgrove. Hann and XC ate chicken rice there. Then, we went to NTUC for a short while. We took the 912 to Woodlands Interchange. Hmm...in the end, only me, XC and WQ went to Causeway Point.   We went to the library first to return WQ's books. Then, we walked around Causeway Point, shopping for clothes and handphones. All for XC la. HaHa. At 5 something, endy smsed, saying she arrived. We hurried down to the bus interchange to meet Wendy and gang.  They went to Sheng Shiong and brought chalet stuff. Wendy, Sonia and MeiYing. HaHa. I am helping them to trasnport ma, so they brought to my house. Only Wendy and Sonia followed me to my house. Woah! Got so many things wor. Charcoals ar, grill mesh, drinks bottles (we are talking about giant size here..haha), the works. HaHa. I had a real tough time carrying the items wor! HaHa. We made it...and I heard there are more coming on Sunday.  Hmm...what else today? I ate dinner with grapes, watched TV shows till 9pm and came online lor.  Wha!! I am so scared leh! Tomorrow is the posting results of the PAE. I got this dreadful feeling that I will end up in Arts Stream, since I don't exactly qualify for Science stream (I failed A-Maths ma). That's why. My dreadful feelings always come true one, that's why it is so dreadful. I think I am gonna appeal if I get into Arts Stream. Yeah. I think can appeal one la. I only failed by 6 marks, not like I failed so terribly like that. I made careless mistakes, not like I don't know my work. Besides, my Chem and Bio results are great. I am kinda worried about my B3 for Combined Science, but I think I can scrape through if I present my wonderful Chem results. All Physics' fault! HaHa. Sigh...worried worried worried la.  Okay. I think I end le. See ya tomorrow, with hopefully good news. Night blog!

      Hey hey!! Monday!!  Woah!! Later showing Survivor wor! Woah!!   Okay, today what happened leh? I started on my webbie. Heh heh. It's coming out...slowly slowly. Nice? I dunnoe. I hope so. HeHe.  Today leh, our whole family went to some 'temple' to pray la. Give our thanks for blessing us. It's what we call a home-made temple lor, so I have no idea whether it is legal or not. Okay, so I was supposed to be blessed la. The lady had to throw two cresent-shape stone thingys to see whether the blessing successful or not la. HAHA! She had to throw 5 times, because the first 4 times the god 'rejected' the blessing! She have to keep muttering more and more blessings. I find it quite hilarious. Oh... what I said meant no offense to Buddhist, but I really find it funny lor. I wonder what the lady thinks about me....  Okay, after eating at AMK Central, I came back to sleep. Yeah. Sleep. Need to conserve and recharge energies for tonight. Hmm...today's dinner is instant noodles. So nice!  Okay...I end liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

So, I finally caught it! Great show! I like Queen Amidala. She's so cool, so regal. So Queen-ish! Heh heh.  Hmm....what else what else? Oh yes. Tomorrow is Survivor Finale!

      Oh hey! Saturday! Sat Sat Saturday!   First, tell you about yesterday's Survivor! Yay!! The girls banded together to vote our Burton.   Hmm...today morning was the same old same old for Saturday. Eat breakfast then watch cartoons. Moo meow!!  Hm, WQ invited me to go shopping. Well, window-shopping at least. I invited YH to join us la. We met at 2 at Woodlands Interchange and took the South-bound train to Dhoby Ghaut Station. Along the way, I read my book (B Movies, Blue Love. Nice book leh! I wanna go borrow another book of the author's, All About Men).   We arrived at Dhoby Ghuat and made our way towards Plaza Singapura. Oh my!! It was a freaking nightmarish walk. People are giving away leaflets right and left. I am not taking any, because I don't want to contribute to world litter. I have to keep rejecting. Ergh!   The first thing we went into Plaza was go to Carrefour. YH brought sushi and a a bottle of coke. We went out to let him eat first. HaHa. That silly YH says he will only drink 5 cups (a very little cup he got from eating free food in Carrefour) of Coke per hour. HaHa. I helped him pour out the coke. (Once, I accidentally tipped the bottle and quite a lot spiled out. YH brought Coke Light, so he said "See la! Now the coke is really light after you spilled!" HAHA!) After that, we went into Carrefour to look at other sutff. Oh god! There are so many CDs I wanna buy!   After that, we walked around Plaza. Hann wants to buy bag and wallet. Plaza has no shops to his liking, so we decided to go Orchard to shop for his stuff. On the MRT, we saw this advertisement for Navy: "Stories For Your Grandchildren. Start Collecting Now". Ha! Me and Hann commented that joining the Navy, you MAY NOT survive to have grandchildren in the first place! HA!!! Navy/Armed Forces = Violent/Dangerous = Loss of Precious Life.   We went down at Orchard, and went to Isetan. We saw this Billabong wallet YH wanted, but he said he wanted to do survey first, shop around. We went out and saw Kym Ng!! She was there filming for Quan Xing Zhou Dong Yuan (forgot the English name le). O.o!! While walking towards the Heeren, I decided to go home.

      Heya! It's a Friday. End of the weekdays. Meow!  Today morning, I went to the doctor for another dose of medicines to treat my sores-infested legs. Oh...the sores are getting better. OOoo...  After that, we came home. Then, I rushed off to meet CQ, Gloria, YH and Joyce at Woodlands Stadium to play some basketball and badminton. Yeah. I arrived there and they were still waiting for XC. HaHa. We played some football (where I was the goalkeeper and all 4 of them were trying to shoot in the ball, which was provided by Joyce). Meow meow!!  After that, we went to the Woodlands Stadium. Joyce, Gloria and YH went out to run on the track (or rather, walk), while me and Ji went out to wait for XC. Hm...after waiting and walking till 12pm, we buay tahan le. We were so hungry, so we left for lunch. I called my brother to give XC my HP number, in case XC calls my home (he likes to do that one la).  We went to the coffeshop far beyond, and each step was killing. I was so so so hungry. I ordered chicken rice and root beer. Ah Ji passed me Janet's present, asking me to give it to her when I am going home.   Then, after lunch, it was 1. We walked back to the badminton stadium and booked 2 courts for an hour.  We played badminton and called WQ to come down (he refused to return me $1. I pay for the courts ma...everybody owed me $1. He said "I never said I am coming down to play!!" and hanged up on me! Excuseeee me! Never said? Oh my my!! tsk tsk!). CQ had to go back to oversee some fixing of his SCV cable. We played till 2 lor.  We were about to go back, until XC called and say he just arrived. So late! He proposed playing basketball, so we all agreed lor. He arrived soon after, followed by CQ and his brother. We went to a basketball court near WQ's house and started playing. WQ also came down to play. We played and played (have some rest in between) and stop at around 4.  Me, Gloria, YH and XC took the 911 bus towards Causeway Point. YH went home in the MRT, the rest of us walekd towards CWP. Then, in a throng of people, we lost XC. Can't find him, so me and Gloria went up to Popular to give Janet her gift. We even had to queue to give Janet CQ's gift (makes Janet look like a very important person. HaHa!!). Then, we went home by the 913 bus.  I came back home, took a bath, went online, then went for dinner and came back to watch TV. Oh my god!! OK No Problem is showing its last episode!! Why so many good shows end during this time de? Ayioh!! So good that show! I will miss the episodes. ~Starts hoping for another season~   Okay. Gotta go le. Watch Survivor and all. So exciting! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya. I am gonna make this blog short and simple. There's gonna be 4 crabs (Eeny, Minny, Miney, Mor), cooked in chlli, waiting for me. Hmm!  Okay..basically, today, we went out. In the morning, we went to Marsiling to eat breakfast and buy flowers for the goddess (I ate laksa). Yeah. After that, we (brother and I) came back while the parents went to Ang Mo Kio to buy some incense.   For lunch, we went to Woodlands Central. I ate fried carrot cake. Ha. After that, I brought a new bag. Same colour (not really...ayiah! Red la...darker only). Then, we went to Sheng Shiong to buy foodstuff and household items. HaHa. We brought 4 crabs to eat. So many crabs are missing limbs. So er xin. (HaHa. Eeny's left pincer fell off when we put it in our 'crab box'!)  After going to Woodlands Central, we came back to put goods and went to the library/Causeway Point. First, we went to Causeway Point to eat (KFC) and buy HansVision, a chinese software. Mine stupidly expired somehow. Then, we went to the library to borrow books. Along the way, we also brought new windows. Nah...we didn't really buy. We just signed up to buy. It's one of those rotational 180degrees window thingy. It has a lifetime garuntee that it won't fall off. HaHa.   After we came back, I installed HansVision. YaY!! The MahJong game worked properly!! Got real chinese characters and everything! Finally! I can figure out what the characters are saying, instead of looking at boxes and squiggly lines. HaHa.  At 6, I went out to eat dinner. Then, at 7.30 came back, bathed and wtched some TV. Viola. I am here.  Alright. I gotta be ending. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! I am posting early...again. Heh. What to do? Today got Charmed. Don't wanna rush. Now, I have all the time to slowly type (like I would slowly type. The boredom is gonna kill me).   Ahh. I have finished the two books I brought. I am gonna review them.  Firstly, The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom. Wow! The book is fantastic. It keep me hooked throughout the end. The book teaches us 5 important live lessons. The first one is that  there is a balance to everything. Like our friend falls ill, but we don't. It not a coincidence. One withers, another grows.  The second one is that  sacrifice is part of life. When you sacrifice smething, you are not losing it, You are just passing it onto someone else.   The third lesson is that  holding anger is a poison. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. The harm we do, we do to ourselves.   The fourth and five lesson I neer really quite knew. I gathered that  love and memories don't die . I also inferred that  our place on Earth has a meaning. Our jobs, what we do, is a special contribution to everything.  This bvook is so enriching. I even thought about it during a show, when one of the characters asked "Why him? Why not me?" (forgot which show le...I think Ben Yue). The most important life lesson covered by this book was that  all lives intersect, in one way or another. All our actions affects some other people in a special way, even simple mudane things like picking up the rubbish. The each affects the other as the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.   (Note: italicised texts are excerpts from the book and some of my own inferences from reading this book.) I find it a very beautiful book that I would turn to again and again. I recomend everybody to buy this and discover yourself and the world. I rate this book 4.5 out of 5 stars.   The other book is The Wish List by Eoin Colfer (author of the Artemis Fowl books). This is a story about Meg redeeming herself brownie points to go up to heaven. She died due to a gas explosion, and surpirse surprise. She was dead even on the good and bad points, meaning going neither to Heaven (the Pearlies, they call that) or to Hell (the pits). Saint Peter and Brezelbub was featured. Heh heh. In order to accumulate brownie points, she had to help an old man fulfill his wish list before he dies. On that list were some outrageous things like kissing his old flame (whom he never got to kiss) and kicking a football way above the goal post. HaHa. This story is humorously funny as the two incompatible pair fulfill the tasks on the list, with some obstacles from Hades (he wants the girl in Hell). There are funny scenes about Heaven and Hell (Saint Peter was grumbling about being stuck as the gatekeeper "If he was such a big shot holy saint, how come he has to sit outside the gates all the time while the rest of them enjoyed the fruits of heaven?Why couldn't James ever take a turn? Or John? Or Judas?"). Heh heh. Wish List is a great book if you want to brighten up your day. I recomend it for anyone, really. I rate this book 3.5 out of 5 stars.   Ehh... hmm. Today also another boring day la. Doing nothing also. I found out that the Survivor Finale is gonna be aired on next Monday, from 10pm to 1am tuesday. Oh my!! I must sleep in the afternoon to conserve and charge up my energies. Therefore, I must sleep late on Sunday and do a lot of strenous work on Monday (a-ha! clean the whole house!). What a hassle. However, I'll do anything for my Survivor.   Okay. Gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Bye blog!

      Heya. I am back.  First off the press. Important news. Big news. I RECEIVED THE LETTER (Bursary one...duhz)! It's such a double-edged sword! Ergh! The good side that it has arrived. I cna apply. The bad side of it...sucks! Firstly, I am worried that the application might be rejected. Some idiotic people will stick rule-by-rule and will reject your application even though it's NOT your fault that you can't submit on time (some worse ones will think I had forgotten and is making up excuses). I should either scream at them, or refer them to MOE. Or both. Second bad news is that I might not be confirmed. You see ar, the letter said that confirmations letter are given out by December. This is already late LATE December (don't try to argue and say it's early. 1/3 of a month has passed, and it's late!). They might have already printed the confirmation letters and in the process of sending them out. Or worse!!! They could hace printed out the cheques already!! OH MY GOD!! THERE GOES MY $250!! All the MOE's fault! All the post office's fault!!! If either one of the two bad things I predicted happened, I will call the New Paper and give them a story (I can imagine the headline.  No Administration Loses Student $250 ). Or write to Straits Time to complain. Or both. Whatever!! I want my $250!!!!  Okay. Darn, I am not gonna relax until I get my confirmation letter. ... Okay. Let me fill in what happened today.   Today, we (Me, Ben, EC and HM) met at 1015 to buy present for Melvin. I am meeting Ben at 1000. Well, it turned out that he was sleeping till I called. I had to wait for him to finish bathing. Sigh!! It ended up us being late for eight minutes. Oh boy. The girls were pissed. It was not my fault anyway. HaHa.  We went around Causeway looking for Mel's present. We found it at Metro, at the toy's section. It was c ehss board, with the pieces made out of crystal-plastic thingy. Whatever. Heh heh. We chose that after much deliberation. Hmm....a sales assistant came over to us (more like ran) and pasted a label there, saying it was the price tag. Ha! I know different. That was her own personal tag!! She's earning commission for something which she didn't help the customer to choose. I peered at the label and saw the name Chan Hse May. Maybe Wendy knows her (Do you? Same department right?). That's not a good sales assistant, to earn something that she didn't even work for. I guess she needs the money for her family or something. So, sigh. Let it go la.  After that, we made our way to Melvin's house. We were amazed by the amound of food he prepared. He told us to eat first, and his friends will eat after we do (he's also inviting his school friends ma). We ate his macroroni with pasta. It was nice, if it wasn't for the sore underside my tongue (that sore is so painful! ergh!). It was sensitive to sauces, so I can't eat much. We ate other finger foods too, like fishball and fish nuggets.   After that, we watched and sang to Karaoke. Heh Heh. We watched his friends slowly filter in. After watching Karaoke (and some sleep on my part), they turned to watched a horror movie. I took out my book to read. I hate horror movies....eeee.... However, it was not as scary as The Park. That's good, to some extent.  After that, we milled around waiting for the cake-cutting ceremony. HM and EC played a few piano pieces. Wonderfully done! The cake-cutting ceremony was crowded. HaHaHa. We ate some cake. Heh Heh. After that, at 5, we left. Getting kinda late le.  We walked from his house to Woodlands MRT. Me and Ben took the 913 bus back. sigh...I was in shock when I receieved the 'sword'. Sigh...I needa stop worrying. Cannot don't worry.... Sigh...  Hmm...I think I should stop le la. See ya later. Night blog!

      Heya! I am back!   Hmm. I didn't get Tuesdays With Morrie and Artermis Fowl books as originally intended. Let me tell you what I got in a moment.  First hor, we went to the Lot 1's popular. It's the biggest in Singapore, so we can get something. My mother told us not judge the size of the store, the goods it carries makes a huge difference. Yeah. You can guess what happened. The store was kinda pathetic...even more so than Causeway's Popular.  Therefore, we went to the Popular in Causeway Point. In the end, I brought 'The Five People You Meet In Heaven', 'The Wish List' and Ma Jiang Wang, a Chinese game of MahJong. :)  I came back and started playing MahJong. Well, to my dismay, the Chinese characters came out as garbage. All squares squares lines lines dash dash. Ayioh! My HansWare also cropped out. I need to buy the latest version of HansWare (which will only be brought during my Mother's next off day. Today is her off day ma).   After playing MahJong with lousy Chinese words,  I went to eat dinner and make a new pair of specs. We ate chicken rice. Okay. Specs. I finally got a metal frame spectacls. I took great care in choosing the lens shape. I want a thin oval-ish kindan shape to complement my small eyes. Then, it's time for the color. I got two smiliar versions of a pair of spectacles, uin two different color. One was black, the other was metallic blue. I had a hard time choosing the color. I called Wendy, she said black. My mother said black too. However, I made a coin toss again. 2/3 wins. The first two times, it was one blue, one black. The last toss said that I should choose blue, so I did. Then, it was time to measure my degrees. Goodness! My degrees has gone into a thousand each eye. Oh my god! I must take care of my eyes more. In the end, we brought the two frames. The black one is a 'spare', just in case something went wrong to the blue one.  Oh.... today hor, the chinese newspapers were having a field day with the report of Huang Yi Liang 'suaning' his wife during his thank-you speech. He meant it as a joke I guess. MeiJiao accepted it as a joke. That's good. HaHa! Today Bao Mei Li was funny. HAHAHA!! Qi shu lin!  Hm...what else ar? Ayiah... I know I wanted to say something one. Oh yes! Tomorrow, Melvin invited me and his friends to his house to celebrate his birthday. :) Me, Ben and HM are buying his prezzie tomorrow. We are meeting at 1015. I wonder if Causeway Point opens by then. Oh, Wendy confirmed it opens at 10. Okay.   Hm...nothing else to report on liao. Okay...gotta go write Wendy's testimonial. Mad woman (:P joking ar joking ar) is rushing for it. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! I am back to report on yesterday's happenings.  Oh my! Star Awards was so cool! Holland V won in all the categories it was nominated in. It won Best Drama, Best Song. Wang Yu (who plays Zoe) won the Green Apple Award. Huang YiLiang (Tian DaHua) won Best Supporting Actor. Mo Xiao Ling (Mo LingLing) won the Best Supporting Actress (Yay!! Yay!!). Chen Li Ping (Mo WanWan) won Best Actress (horray!). Xie Shao Guang (Yang Xiong) won Best Actor. Woah!! So 'Holland V'-ish! I am so happy. One shocking thing was that LiPing didn't get into Top 10. Oh my god! How could she not? I bet she's crying now. Oh my!! I pity her man...how could she not win?  Oh. I forgot to add that yesterday's HZGG was the most touching story ever! Tears kept flowing down my eyes... HaHa! Seriously. The reconcillation, the forgiving, the pleas, the family warmness, all so touching! I love this episode, for it's the most touching and one where I cried the most. :)  Hey blog, you know what? Everything was back to normal between me and them. :) I am sure glad it did. I didn't know what made them to apologize. I am curious to know. Anway, I apologized too. After all, I did spark off some of the 'bullying'. YH even said that he would think before he says anything. That's good. This experience helped both parties to grow. Both parties learnt that 'bullying' is the worse thing you can do to a friend, intentionally or otherwise. I am glad both parties got out of this storm as better people.  Later, my parents are gonna buy me story books in Popular (using their 20% discount coupon). YaY! I got a list planned. I wanted to get  Five People You Meet In Heaven  and  Tuesdays With Morrie , both by Mitch Albom. I heard lots of good reviews from both books, and I am excited to read them. Don't worry, I'll be posting my reviews once I finish both books. I am also buying the three  Artemis Fowl  books by Eoin Colfer. I read a few chapters online and I am excited to read these books. :) I am such a bookworm. Heh heh!  Hmm..I think I go liao. It's 12 something, and my parents are not back from their shopping yet. I am hungry, and having a splitting headache. Ow! See ya later!

      Hey! As you can see, this is an early blog. Probably the only entry for the day. Yeah.   Oh yes, I forgot to add my feelings about Survivor on last Friday. Christa was voted off! Darn! Why couldn't they vote off Burton/Jon?! Those two opportunities were the best time to vote those idiots off. Howeverr, hope is revivied next episode, where the commercial said that the girls were discussing to vote off the pair of cocky males. Heh. Lets hope they act on their decision!!  I am so excited! Tonight's Star Awards! Who will win? Who will lose? I am so hoping for Mo XiaoLing to win Best Supporting Actress. This is her best year. This is when her career leaps off! She played Mo LingLing very well. I am so crossing my fingers! Who would I like to see win too? Chen LiPing as Best Actress, Xie Shao Guang as Best ACtor, and Huang Wen Yong as Best Supporting Actor. Oh!!!  Hm. I think I end this le. See ya later! Bye bye!

      Heya.  You know what? In the morning, when I logged on to my computer, I received a very surprising surprise. I received a mail from CQ, which told me to visit a site recomended. This was not the surprising bit. The surprise was the site itself.  The site is a blog of their KL trip. They talked about their visit to Mid Valley. However, the main focus was not about their trip. It was to dispel what I have wrriten here a few days ago about them.   Actually, if I come to think about it, it was hardly a surprise. I was very calm when reading that. I predicted that when they see my blog, they would come to that kind of reaction. In a way, I was mentally prepared.   Wendy talked to them this morning, when I was sleeping. They came online and showed Wendy the site. Wendy said that only XC/Hann talked to her, the rest didn't. I won't post what she said, but she did say if i wanted to clear this misunderstanding, I should apologize for the wrong I did.  Yes. i am indeed in the wrong for few oscassions. Being a sleeping conductor, running into MPH without informing them, insulting WQ. Yes. I do admit I was wrong. I apologize for my misdoings.   However, some of the things they written in their blog (countering what I wrote) is twisted beyond the truth. I will give an example. On Wendnesday morning, I picked the spring onions out of my yee mee. The vendor saw it and then said in Cantonese, "Next time, if you don't want yee mee, you ccan tell us and we won't put". I replied with, "Oh. I didn't know that you got put spring onions in yee mee" in Cantonese. They wrote in the blog that I was trying to show off my Cantonese skill. I supposedly had a smug look on my face. I feel that they misinterpreted my actions. When someone speaks to me in Cantonese, I would naturally reply back with Cantonese. It's like a reflex action. I just did it.... I never thought about showing off my Cantonese skills (which was pretty average compared to the expert Cantonese, like my parents). Maybe the smug look was there because I tried to defend my actions. I certainly did not try to show off my Cantonese-speaking skills. If you actually observed me in some food situations, I picked out disgusting spring onions from my food and had a discussion with the vendors. This is me. The garnish hater.   Also, they claimed that I tried to break up Hann's family in my blog (refer to Wednesday's post). I had no such intention of doing so. I merely recorded my observations and my thoughts. How can posting my thoughts break up a family? I didn't even tell the Lais about what I thought. How can the blog "made the family drift away"? I am quite puzzled. Only Hann saw it.   One more thing. I did not go around telling everyone about the incident. I only told Wendy, and she already knew right from Day One. Benjamin pressed answers from me. I was only going to let him know after I posted my entries. I did not know whether it was Benjamin confronted them, or they confronted Benjamin. I was too busy talking to Wendy at that time to care. From what I could see (being invited into conversations), I observed that Benjamin confronted them. Perhaps I only saw a small portion of it and made a wrong judgement. I apologize if I did.   I observed that they convienently left out some things which I wrote, which were the most crucial. Things like "too much jokes hurt", "I was being treated like an extra". They said that I took their jokes too seriously, and I was too emotional, for they were only joking around. I think that they cannot counter these statements. That's not the point. When will they ever get it into their heads that jokes are never meant to be be overused. Yes, one or two jokes are fine. They are funny. The humor stops when the jokes are being used past their limit. The jokes became critcism to the receiver. They became "bullying words". I seriously think they would realize that when their jokes killed somebody. There are records of people committing suicide because their friends "joked" too much. There are stories of such cases. If I stayed on and listened to their jokes, I would have blown up, or become depressed. I am not joking.   Sigh. What really is the use of posting all these in my blog? Why am I trying to clear up all these misunderstandings in my blog - publicly? As long as I know that I am in the clear for most of the things, that's enough. Right? This blog is somewhat considered my private journal. Having found that someone picked my thoughts and feelings and critsized them, I was quite hurt.  Right. Enough about the unhappiness. Let them out, and I would be fine. Today leh, nothing much happened. I brought a Yu-Gi-Oh card deck for myself. I am planning to collect cards, more than playing. :) Crazy cat me.  Hmm...nothing else happened le la. Just surfing of sites here and there. Heh.  I think I end this blog le. Oh yes, I would like to mention that I have complete faith in CQ. Okay, see ya tomorrow. Oh yeah hor! Tomorrow's Star Awards! I might be blogging in the afternoon! Night blog! ~Hums Star Awards Tune~

      Hey blog! Friday conquers the fearless, the.... What the heck am I saying?  Today nothing interesting happened. Heh. I went to the doctor's today to check out my legs. It's covered in sores. The doctor said too much heat and poison. Yeah. Heh. I have been eating heaty stuff too much I guess.   Oh my! I was worried about my Bursary Award! It hasn't arrived yet you know. I called CK, and the mother told me that he had received and the deadline was yesterday. I was so mortified! I called the school, which was useless. I then searched the Internet, found the department (Finance) of MOE and called. The lady confirmed that I am receiving a Bursary Award. She was surprised that I did not receive a letter. She said she would print one out and send it to me. I can register late, due to postal error. That's what she told me. I am so worried!! My $250!!!  In the afternoon, I printed out my blog entries till yesterday's. YaY! Major accomplishment. Major enough to send my black ink into low levels. Heh heh.   Now I got a radio, I became more aware of the latest music happenings. Yeah. I found myself singing songs from the radio. The latest songs I like are:  Kelis - Milkshake ,  Jamelia - Superstar ,   Blue - Guilty  and  Dido - White Flag . That's all I cam remember. Hey! I did an experiment. I logged on to the online webcast of Perfect 10. I found out that it lagged behind the actual broadcast for about 2-3 minutes. O.o!! How surprising.  HaHa! I think I end liao la. I got almost nothing to say..... so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! I am back.  Today morning was spent coming online and watching my taped Comedy Night. After that, I wrote in my blog entries for the days in my KL trip.   I ate noodles at 12 something, and ate while blogging. After blogging and lunch, I set out to print my blog's October entries. It took me about an hour till 3 something. I am printing November and December's entries tomorrow. Yeah.   After surfing the net for an hour, I soon fell asleep. I just dozed off like that. Oh boy...I was sure tired. I slept and slept till 6 something, when Father woke me up to go to eat. I asked him to buy back dinner, and I continued sleeping till he came home.    I ate char siew rice watched TV and bathed. Here I am, online blogging.  Sigh. I forgot to mention that during the car trip back and today, there are several moments when I suddenly went into a shock. Ya. I was shocked that I am coming back to/back in Singapore. I should be in Malaysia. You are saying that I am regretting my decision? No, I am not regretting. I stick to my desicion, I believe in it. I did not regret coming back home.  I also forgot to add that CQ was a really great friend. He defended me a lot when the others bullied me, he made me feel part of the group when they didn't. I value CQ as a great friend. I am gonna treasure him.  Ya know. All I wanted was to be accepted. To be part of a group. To have fun with my friends. However, I just failed miserably in every attempt. Why? Am I such a detestable person that no-one wants to accept me? I am such a failure.   Wendy said I am a "bully-magnet". I can be bullied easily, that's why the jokes can't seem to stop. Bullied easily? Yeah...I rarely does strike back, I just tolerated and bear with it. I just hope for these 'jokes' to stop sometime after, but they never do. What to do?   God... I think I better stop now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey! I bet you are surprised that I am writing this early. Wednesday is Day Finale of my KL trip. Yes, you heard it right. Finale. Final. The end.  I am now travelling back home with Hann's family in their car. Why, you ask. Listen.  First, let me narrate today morning.  We woke up at 9+. HaHa. I was kinda suprised that no-one woke us up. At night, I was kinda scared. Yeah. The living room was so dark, and sounds from the outside could be heard. Very natural. I can't even hear that kind of sounds if I open my windows in my home at night. The vast difference between surbudan and city environements. Anyway, me and XC woke up first, followed by the rest.  We brushed our teeth and went for breakfast at the same food center we went to yesterday for brunch. I ate yi mee. Nice.  After that, we moved our luggage and went to YH's eldest aunt's place. I took quite a while, about 30 minutes, before reaching there. Malaysia is sure spaced out.  (Oh my. My noce bled just now. I wonder why that happened. I nose bled so frequently this year.)  At the aunt's place, we watched some TV and played card games.  YH's parents mentioned that they are going back to Singapore today. YH then told me "Wanna go back, KY?" That set me in deep thought. Should I go or should I stay? I used a coin to help me made my decision (just like WanWan. Using a coin is not a stupid thing to do.....). In the end, I decided to go.  The relatives tried to persuade me to stay. I held my foot and refused to. They suspect Hann bullying me. Hann and XC said "No" loudly. I don't want to blow up the situation, and save them some face, I said they were not to be blamed.   Why? AsI said last night, I was feeling quite unhappy. The situation did not improve this morning. If I stayed, I would haave made myself felt more terrible. Knowing me, I would burst out sometime later. I rather leave now than lose my friends later. Yea. Besides, when WQ arrived, I would vent my fustrations on him. That would be very unfair to him.  Besides, there's this worry about the money factor. I am so afraid I would spend it all on Genting/Theme parks. Lame reason....  I just realized that this is my retribution. Retribution for bullying WQ. Now, I was being punished. I fully understood how bad WQ felt. My karma finally caught up to me. From this experience, I learn that bullying/ostrasizing is a terrible thing to do. I'll not do that to others in the future.  I hope they would treat WQ better than they treated me. I know they are planning to ostrasize WQ. Trust me. Being ostrasized is not fun. I've been there.   I can't wait to go back. There's about 3 more hours to go before we reach JB. See ya later.   HOURS LATER   Heya! I am back from Malaysia! What a trip! Let me continue from where I left off.  After blogging, I fell alsleep. Yit Kai and the mother slept too. Yit Kai was so cute, the way he sleeps. HeHe. I slept till about 4.50+. We stopped at a rest stop. For the next 10 minutes, I stared at the surroundings and did some calculations on when we would reach JB. I figured we would reach there at aound 6. I took out my Reader's Digest and started reading.   At 6, we went to YH's grandmum's house (maternal side). We would be staying there till 7.30, then we would set off. They said going off at 7.30 would avoid the jam at Causeway.   Me, YK and the mother went to Pizza Hut to eat pizza (Heh. They were organizing Pizzas today). I got to choose the pizza. I chose the Hawaiian Chicken. Nice! I also got to drink the musroom soup and the pepsi can. I ate two slices, the mother ate one. YK is so good at eating! He can finish two chicken wings, a cup of coup, a glass of Pepsi and three slices of pizza. Woah! Oh yeah, Auntie brought me snacks to bring back. Thanks!   We went back to give food to Grandmum and Uncle. We watched the Ben Yue till about 7.40, then we made our way back to Singapore.  It was quite a jam. Yeah. Something horrifying happened. My passport didn't get stamped by the Malaysian customs. The lady asked for my train ticket, but I left it with XC. That got me into a fix. Luckily, Auntie and Uncle helped me out, and I was cleared. Phew.... after the encounter at the Malaysia custom, we queued up to get through the Singapore cusoms. It wasn't too long before we are cleared. After that, Uncle and Auntie fetched me back to my block. I thanked them and went up.  Phew! Home Sweet home! The sofa changed. It became shorter and more cute. Heh heh. I took a bath, went online, then watched Charmed. O.o!! Charmed was nice.   I went online, and saw them online too. They interrogated me. I didn't answer much, because I have no mood to be interrogated. Wendy called and we talked lor. I told her what I went through. She listened and gave me advice. Ben soon knew what happened and went to confront them about it. I am thankful for his efforts.  Wendy told me that they were only 'joking' and also said  that she felt guilty for "bullying" me. She often joked with me and all. However, i don't feel angry. You know why? There's this huge difference between how Wendy jokes and how they jokes. The tone for example. Wendy's jokes are just for fun, but their tone makes it seem that they are not joking and is intentionally hurting me. Another thing is that Wendy knows when to stop, but they don't. Jokes stop being funny once it goes beyond more than few. It starts to hurt.   I observed the Lai family during my trip back. They seem very close-knit. Uncle kept having fun with YK and being a great father. Auntie too. However, I saw the vast difference betweeen how YH treats his parents. He seemed to regard them as aliens. He pushed his father away today when Uncle tried to play with him, and rejected Uncle's offer to fetch him back, rudely. He didn't really treat his mother that well either. Very unlike YK lor. I felt that YH was missing a whole lot on family warmness, but hey! Who am I to judge? These are just my observations and thoughts, as a stranger.   HaHa. I better go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Today was an eventful day. Welcome to Day 1 of our KL stay. I am now at Hann's KL home, sitting on the swinging char. Heh.  Yesterday, I couldn't sleep well. I felt like puking most of the time. I was sleeping on the lower bunk, and everytime the train moves, the empty upper bunk would rattle like crazy. When I tried sleeping on the upper bunk, the man opposite me was snoring like hell. Therefore, I got very little sleep.  What I did was self appoint myself as the "sleeping conductor-cum-door keeper". I kept mkaing sure my friends were all asleep ('cept for KS, he couldn't sleep and we talked). We were sleeping near the door entrace to our carriage. People walk past often and always didn't close the door. When that happens, the loud wind would be blowing into our cabin. Sheez. I made sure doors were closed each time they were opened.  In the end, I got about 3 hours of sleep. Yeah. That's how bad it was. The others, who got way way MORE sleep time, blamed me for their little amount of sleep and making them lose a potenial hour of sleep. Well, except for CQ and KS. Sheez. I was reminded of it throughout the entire day. Basically, I was being ostrasized. The unfairness of things. I can't sleep, they slept more. Yet, I was blamed for their "little" sleep time. Sigh.  The train made seceral stops and we had to get down at Woodlands checkpoint to get our passports scanned.  The trian arived at KL at 7am. We were met by Hann's 2nd aunt and his grandmother. Hann's father and youngest aunt arrived to fetch us from the treacherous rain.  We went to Hann's place, rest for a bit and went out for brunch.  Brunch, ban mian, was spoilt by Hann, who added chilli to my noodles. I DETEST PEOPLE MESSING WITH MY FOOD! 2 things surprised me. One, almost all the Chinese in KL speaks Cantonese. Great for me, no languade barriers and all. It's wasn't so good for the others, who can't speak Cantonese. Hmm. Two, the things there are half the price in Singapore. In Singapore, ban mian costs S$2.50, but in KL, it costs RM2.50 (S$1.25). Wow...  After that, we went shopping in Mines City. XC brought a shirt and Hann came up with this idea to wear the same shirt to Genting (to ostrasize WQ la....).  We went to this mall, which is totally boring. I even forgot the name. How insignificant.   After that, we went into Mid Valley to shop.  I spotted MPH bookshop! Oh my god! I cna buy my books! Charmed books were in abundance!! So were Artermis Fowl! They were even cheaper than in Singapore, about $1-2 lesser. O.o!!  The rest came in and they were pretty angry at me. XC grabbed my neck and shook me hard. I almost fell. He's so....violent. They went out after I dismissed them.  I felt kinda hurt by their actions, especially XC. I never knew he's that cruel. Yeah. I even dismissed the idea of buying Mirror Image to go look for them. While walking the huge huge mall, I was kinda angry and so much wanted to burst out at them ('cept CQ and KS...they did nothing wrong. See ar, whenever I refer to "them", the term usually excludes CQ and KS). I managed to calm down and keep my temper in check. Ha! Anger management lesson from Wendy is helping. Heh.  I found them at Tropicana Life. They were buying clothes and I was forced to buy one too. (Given future circumstances, I should have brought my book instead. It was way more useful. At least the book is not meant to ostrasize.) Therefore, I ended up paying RM31.90.  For dinner, we ate stingray plus sotong plus clams. I tried to buy drinks, but the Malay lady couldn't understand English. I had to ask KS to translate for me (and was ridiculed once again for sucking at basic conversational Malay. HELLO! I never learnt Malay. I am not going to either. I don't see a use for it in Singapore.) Sigh....why can't English be used? It is, after all, a global language.  I realized that the malls don't carry superglue. I need it to fix my loose soles. I finally found one at Jusco in Mid Valley. What a severe lack of superglue.   I knew I said this earlier, but I am really upset that I was being treated as an extra. I was reminded of that fact constantly too (Then, why bother inviting an extra to the KL trip?). I was being ostrasized. It's not a good feeling AT ALL. Everything I say is wrong, everything I do is wrong. Everything about me is wrong. I should have turned back at Tanjong Pagar and take a taxi back home. You know how horribly I was treated? How terrible I felt? I wanted to break down more than once, but I controlled.I began to sympathize with Yit Kai, Hann's brother, who was hated by Hann. I know how it feels lor. I wish I can have someone to pour out my feelings to. I tried telling Wendy, but I can't, due to the presence of my friends. You, my blog, are me bestest friend. Thanks for listening.  I think I better turn in now, or else I can't sleep. I already had a secere lack of sleep today morning. I need ample rest. So, yeah, see ya tomorrow. Night blog.

      Heya! I am now writing this while sitting on the bed of my train. Number 36 bed to be exact.  I met CQ at 4.45. I went into Causeway to find Wendy to say goodbyes, but she was nowhere to be found. We met XC and then went to meet Hann at Yishun MRT.  We met Hann and went to his house. It was quite crampyed, but spacious at the same time. Contraidctory, I know. After a while, the rest went down to eat while I stayed at YH's home.  They came back after a while and we set off towards Tanjong Pagar Railway Station.      After a tumultonous journey wrecked with ridicule and insults, we finally reached the station.  At 9.30 or so, we were allowed into the departure hall. We had to go through the customs first. I was scolded for putting "Kelvin" in front og my name in the declaration card. "Kelvin" was at the back of my passport. What a shrew.  Ya know, before entering the departure hall, I had second thoughts. Sigh....being the butt of everybody's jokes is not funny at all. Sigh...just tolerate with it la.   This train is kinda bumpy. Heh. It's not THAT bad. I gotta go know. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya. I am back. To write some feelings here and there about my trip and all. You can call it the "Prologue" of KY's Trip.  Heh. Today morning, I packed my suitcase. Oh god. I never realized how many clothes and little space I have. Have to roll and squeeze my clothes. My!   I learnt another cruel fact of life. Custom officers are very corrupt. My mother told me to bribe them if nesscary. Even XC says so. Moreover, you will have to pay taxes if you brought more than 5 sets of clothes You have to pay taxes if you brought in a lot of money. Even your pen could be taxed. What the *toot*! I was scared you know. Either pay taxes or pay bribes. I am NOT bribing anyone, esepcially idiotic corrupt officers. It's against my conscience to do so. However, Wendy said she would bribe if she were me. Sigh. I don't want to bribe. I am having second thoughts of going to Malaysia....if I have to bribe.  I got another worry. What if the train crashes? Then how?! Oh god! I am such a worrywart. What if I meet  things ? Sigh....  Wendy said to enjoy and have fun. Don't be worried so much. She's right you know. I shouldn't be worrying about this and that. I shoulda be going to Malaysia with a happy mood. I'll try.  I gotta be going le. Cook some noodles for myself, then prepare and meet CQ later. Yeah. That's it. See ya around, blog. Byes!!

      Hey Hey! Friday meows!  Hmm. Today is...a Friday. HaHa. Dad calledme up again, and I spent lotsa time in the bathroom. I was thinking about lotsa stuff. Like what I am gonna do today ar, things like that la. Ha. Today, we are not gonna go out to eat breakfast. I ate the cake thingy. Fak kou in Cantonese. Hmm... Nice.  Anyway, I went online as usual. Hmm. No replies to my posts. The author did not come online to prod me more about my theories. :( Anyway, after some random surfing, I went to play my PT until lunch time. YaY! I got a new staff. Heh Heh!   We wait for Edwin to come back then we went out to 768 to eat lunch. All of us ate chicken rice. Halfway, Courts called and reminded Dad to pay the bills. Sigh! So kiasu them.   After lunch, me and Dad went to Causeway Point. HaHa. Actually, I am going thwere also because Dad wants me to pay the TV license while he go pay the installments. Moo meow! My first time paying for the bills. HaHa. I was quite lost which counter to go to. It is "all Transactions except SpeedPost" or "Bills Here". I went into the transaction queue and I was right. Heh. It's a no-brainer actually. Meow! After bills paying, we went home lor.   Hmm. I went online and surfed. WQ was online! HaHa! Finally a cat to talk to! Moo meow moo! I chatted with him until he went to bath. After that, I play PT until dinner. Heh.  Hmm. Dinner was very delicious. We had the small lil pig for dinner today. Oink Oink! Okay, after that, we had shark fin!! YaY! My mother cooked it herself! Nice!! Nice!! I loved the shark fin soup!! Meow!! Pepper galore! Heh Heh! Very very nice! There's crab meat inside. So sumptous! Meow meow meow!   After bathing, I came online lor. Hmm. Tomorrow I am eating laksa. Ahh. Not because I miss laksa! No no no! I want to get back at that idiot! For two times!! Two times she offended me! One: She put spring onions in my fishball noodles (even though my Mother say not to), she said in her defense "It won't kill you" and laughed! Two: The laksa leaves incident. TWO TIMES ARE TOO MANY TIMES! I cannot tolerate this! I am making my mother buy laksa tomorrow for breakfast. Knowing her, the vendor will msot probably put laksa leaves! So, I told Mother NOT to pay if she put laksa leaves! Ah ha! That will make her lose a business, and if no-one comes to buy laksa, she would have wasted making a bowl of laksa!! Serve her right then! She will learn her lesson! LISTEN TO THE CUSTOMERS! THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT! Meow! Revenge is sweet! Well, if she didn't put, then good for her.  Okay. I feel so good after letting this all out (even though I said this during dinner). Meow!! Okay, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Thursday meows at the fools.  Hmm. I woke up at 8.20 today. Father called me up again. They went to the market without me, as I have no mood to walk in this idiotic weather (rainy....for 4 straight days!! qi shu lin!). After bathing, I went online and surfed to wait for my breakfast.  Breakfast (duck porridge) was brought back. I ate and continued with my MNI. More theories and mysteries to solve. I hate time differences. When I post my theories, I have to wait for one whole day to see the author's reply (she's living in the US, and when I am awake, she's not). Ergh! Anyway, I continued surfing until lunch.  For lunch, we went to 768 to eat. I ate ban mian. Eat something hot, the weather is so cold outside. After lunch, we came back. I surfed the Net till about 2.30.  Me and Dad went out to collect the pig. Heh Heh. I brought my book along (The Tangle Box). We took the MRT towards AMK Station, then from there, take bus 130 towards Balestier. I read my book during the long journey.   Arriving at Balestier, we went to the bank. It looks like I have to take out $110 from my account to pay for the TV license. HaHa. Now the TV is in my control! Paying for the license means authority over the main TV. Woo!! Heh Heh. No la.   After that, we went to the 933 Duck to get our roasted pig. So cute one! It was about half an umbrella long. HaHa. The eyes were closed, and I can see very little teeth (because the mouth's closed). So cute!!! HaHa. We waited for Uncle to fetch us lor. He came after long periods of waiting. The two men talked and talked (in Hokkien) whole I read my book. When we are coming back, we saw PuiPui (Mom's colleague) walking on the way home. Uncle thought we were stopping there because I shouted to my Father "Look! PeiPei!". Heh Heh.   After that, I played my PT until dinner time lor. I ate dinner, read my book (Now Witches' Brew. I finished Tangle Box). I bathed and came online lor.  HaHa! YaY!! I got an Outstanding for my Charms essay!! YaY!! YaY!! 7 Galleons to moi! HaHa. I thought the ending was crappy, because I was rushing to complete it before American Idol. Actually, I was running about 10 minutes late into AI. HaHa.   Well, I gotta go now. Gotta watch the fabulous AI. Oh Simon! I love his caustic comments! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya moo meow!   Today, Dad woke me up. It looks like he's staying for quite a while, as his car crash is quite serious. Moo meow! I took quite a long time to bath, and went I came out, it was 9.20. Heh heh.  We went to 883 to eat breakfast. I ate chee cheong fun. Again. Yep! :) We met 510 (the orginal resident of my neighbour) Auntie. HaHa. She sat with us and we ate together lor. We chatted and chatted. Laraine's in P4! Oh my god! How time flies! I wonder if Laraine still recongise me. Hmm...  After that, I brought 8 Days and we went to Shop N Save to shop. Shop ar shop ar. Mother brought a lot of things and chatted with her colleages. Staff favoritism! The packer opened a new box og grapes for Mother. HaHa! We brought more stuff la. I forgot what. I was busy reading my 8 Days. Then, we brought more stuff and we went home.  Woah! We reached home at 11. I went online lor. HaHa. Yesterday I posted some theories of my own to solve a mystery. The creator said I am good at this. Even though a lot of people knows the answer, I am still gonna solve it on my own (with some prodding by the creator la). HaHa. I posted more theories of my own. :) I am so excited!! I wanna solve it!  After that, we went to 768 to eat lunch. There was a intense discussion on where to buy yu sheng. 883 or 768? They are still deciding. Today's Ren Ri. In Chinese tradition, it means today is everyone's birthday. HaHa. We everytime eat yu sheng today one. Actually, within these 15 days, we would at least eat yu sheng about 4 times. HaHa. We are yu sheng freaks.  Coming back from lunch, I went to play my PT. HaHa. This time, I played for about 4 hours. I levelled about 3 levels to level 10! Woo-hoo! I finally learnt how to Heal myself. Moo meow meow! After playing, I went online for more theories guessing. In a discussion, one guy slammed Singapore by saying "at least it is not like some poor countries like Singapore where people work for 12 hours and get 15 cents". I was so totally pissed off! Even the 'lowest' jobs (cardboard collectors) earn enough to feed themselves for the day. I told him off lor. You must find it totally unKY-ish. After all, I am not much of a patriotic citizen. Come on lor. He makes it sound like EVERYONE is earning 15 cents a day. Singapore is a modern and cosmopolitarian city. I wonder where he gets his facts from. He is such an idiot!   I had my dinner next. It looks like Dad is going to Balestier to get the roasted pig (whole pig) for tomorrow's praying. I am going with him. :) We are taking the MRT and bus first, then Dad's taxi friend (9293) is fetching us. HaHa. I read my book (The Tangle Box) until 7.30 when I came online.  Oh my! It looks like there's Charms essay. Hmm...I must do it. For more galleons! Meow moo!   Alright, I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Tuesday! Meowing moo meow!  Heya! I woke up at 8.30. HaHa. Today I am not going to 883. Mother don't let me go because it was raining outside. HaHa. I went online and waited for Mother to come back with breakfast. She came back with chee choeng fun! I cna simply die! The rich flavour of chee cheong fun! I miss it! For weeks (okay...6 days), my life has been "chee cheong fun'-less! Today, I can finally eat the simple, yet superb dish! Ahhh! The taste leaves me wanting more and more..and more! Meow meow meow!  After breakfast, I went online. These days hor, I spent most of my time in MuggleNet Interactive. HaHa. Meowing moo. Then, I went to eat lunch (nasi lemak).   After lunch, it was gaming time. I played Priston Tale and managed to gain 2 levels. HaHa. Not easy you know. I finally got a new wand. YaY!! HaHa. At 2 something, I quit gaming and surfed online.  At 6, I bathed, and bathed till 6.40. By then, my father has not yet returned. This is sow unlike him. I called him and found out - GASP - that he's involved in another accident. This is so worrying. Second time within 4 days! The rain is really stupid. My father skidded and hit the metal barrier again. I HATE THE RAIN! I thought spring's here and there shouldn't be any more rain. Stupid global weather. It looks like we have to pay $1500+ for the damages. Sigh... I don't know how we can cough out that much man!  Dinner was a sordid affair. Okay, not really sordid, but it was strange without Dad around. Sigh! He came home around 8. So late! Meow moo! Sigh!! After watching TV, I came online lor.  Haiz. I think I end this entry le la. Got nothing to say le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Monday meows the start of the week.   HaHa. I woke up at 7.14 by my Mother. HaHa. One minute before my alarm rings. I took a bath. Surprise surprise. I took 30 minutes. My timing is so off today. I wonder why.   O.o! The 8-9 part is the Red Carpet Event, where lotsa stars are being interviewed. I only recongized Reba, Tom Cruise, Sarah Jessica Parker and some select few. Heh Heh. The other stars are so foreign to me. Heh Heh.   After the RCE, it was the main event. O.o There are so many categories. Frankly speaking, I was kinda bored. All the flims either I didn't watch, or not yet in Singapore yet. At 10, I decided to read my borrowed books and didn't pay attention to the award show. However, I know Angels In America and ROTK are both big winners, securing many awards.   At 11+, I abandoned the award show and went to watch my tapes. I taped "CardCaptor Sakura: The Movie 2" and "The Simpsons" on Sat. The CCS Movie is so nice! Sakura finally biao bai to XiaoLang! So romantic! :D Oh yes, there's a new card, but of course, Sakura managed to feng ying! So cool! Meow moo! The incompetent brother missed out 10 minutes of my Simpsons, because he was playing his game. Ergh!!  After that (and lunch), I went online lor. Surfed around, played some games. MuggleNet Interactive is so open leh, makes me feel so much like home. It made me more open, more willing to discuss my ideas. Yeah. Heh heh. Moo meow!   At 6, I went offline and bathed. After that I ate dinner and watched the TV. Comedy Nite last episode le! Ayierr!! Come back soon leh!! Meow moo!  Ahh well. I gotta get going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey heya (Weird combi right? Hey and heya. Heh heh)! Welcome to Sunday's edition of mah blog. Meow! HaHa. This blog entry would be appearing on a Monday, since I just came back from watching a movie (starring Stephen Chow. I forgot the title). However, I am too lazy to type it tomorrow (along with tomorrow's entry), so I decided to do it today then. (Woah! This must be the longest intro I ever made! HAHAHA!)  Okie. Today morning I woke up real early. And thankfully I did. It's 8 and the rest of the family is still sleeping (with the exception of my Dad of course). I woke them all up and I went to bath. After that, I watched TV, read the papers and ate breakfast.  At 11+, Dad came back. Me, Dad and Mom went to my godmum's house to bai nian la. Brother did not tag along, as he's too busy playing his computer games. Yao shu wor! Godmum's house was lively too. Lotsa aunties were there (actually, two), Auntie Irene and Auntie Veron. Kelly was there, and so was Uncle Steven (or issit Chris? So many uncles one! Okay. It is Steven). Me and Dad munched on the goodies and watched HZGG while Mother talked with the aunties, Steven and godmum. Mother tried to get inside info on the takeover of Shop N Save by Cold Storage (Uncle Steven is an IT specialist at CS. He's changing all the price codes too). Ooo... he didn't reveal much (coz he, like Mother, don't know much. HaHa!), just that those shops which are doing badly are gonna be closed down lor (My mother suspected 883's branch. Its sales was doing quite badly). Ooo. Anyway, we left at 1. KaiMa (Godma in Cantonese) gave me $10. Increasement wor! HAHA! Thanks!  After that, we went to AMK Central. I ate mian fen guo while the two parents ate hor fun. After that, the parents brought some VCDs (Chinese period dramas). Then, they went to Causeway Point. I met WQ in Popular. He was with his brother (who looked totally different! O.o! I thought it was WQ's Dad, but upon a closer observation, it was his brother. HaHa!). We brought some highlighters (for brother) and bedsheet sets. We went to the library afterwards. I borrowed a lot of "old" books, ones which I read a lot of times le. I want to read the classics again! HeHe! Even my mother called me crazy (she remembered a book and said I read it for so many times le). Oh well.   We came home at about 4, and I spent some time reading my book and going online till 6. We went to AMK (Lorong 1, not Central) to eat some seafood. There's this seafood stall (those kinda grand one and always chop tables for themselves one ar.... 883 got one) my Father says it's good. We ordered a lot of things la. The main attraction was this yu sheng. Yeah. So nice! HaHa! The grand total came to be $57.80. Ooo! After that, we went home.  After days of hongbao collecting, the total money I collected is an auspicious number! Woo! (More than my brother's by about $12. Who ask him don't go visit people? Heh heh!) My parents don't allow me to buy MahJong (shucks! Idiots!), so I have two options. I can save this auspicious figure into the bank, or I can use some of this money to buy Dido's CD and save the rest (and spoiling the auspicious figure). After much contemplation (and Wendy's input), I decided to put $88 into my bank. I can always save up for the CD. Heh Heh! Moo meow!  I must wake up at 7.20 tomorrow. According to many of my experiements, I take 40 minutes to bath. When I come out, it would be showing the gloden Globe Awards. Oh god...cannot. I don't want to miss the opening. Okay, 7.15 then. Moo meow!   I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey. Sorry for not blogging yesterday. I was too tired to. Well, here I am. Heh.   FRIDAY   Well well well. The second day of CNY. The morning was kinda boring. In the afternoon, I am going to Wendy's house to play MahJong. My mother wants me to bring kum over, but I don't want. It would be kinda embarrassing, a child giving kum. Heh. It was raining and raining, but the rain stopped at 1 something. I then met Su Ping and we went to Wendy's house together.  When we arrived, Wendy was already playing with her colleagues and Kai Lun. HaHa. I saw lots of kum (brought by her colleagues) on the table. Even Ping brought kum. I was so like, paiseh for not bringing kum. Even auntie asked me (jokingly? I think so) why I didn't bring kum. So paiseh.  We then play MahJong (after her colleagues stopped playing). Woah. We play and play and playu. I won quite a number of times. Heh heh. Wen play ar play ar, until 4+. Kelvin, John, Jin Hong and Fong Wee came. The first time FW did was to interfere with my game. I was playing my own style one leh, until he came and arranged my tiles for me. He teach me like I am a complete idiot at MahJong like that leh. I feel so vexed. I want to play using my own style, and I know how to play lor. I got so flustered until I forgot to 'pong'. Ergh! Even Wendy's mother told them "You leave Kekvin alone la. The more you teach him, the more confused he becomes". Thanks Auntie! I think Su Ping also understands la. She don't really like playing with them around.   Me and Su Ping left at 6 something and we walked back. (Oh yes, thanks Wendy for letting me come your house and play! I enjoyed myself, expeically when playing with your mother. Heh Heh. :D Oh yes, I got $4 from Auntie. Xie xie!) I got home to a very angry Mother (because I said I would be back by 6 and I came home at 7). I met my Dad at the lift. His car was in an accident, because he knocked into a metal barrier. Something like that la. I only got sketchy details, because he won't tell me much.   It looks like Mom and brother waited for me and Dad to get home. We ate dinner and watched One Leg Kicking. I spotted Siva Choy (Oh, he's a very funny bi-weekly columnist of TNP on Sunday. There's a photo of him everytime. Some of my favorite columnists are Raymond Goh, Jason Hahn and Edwin Yeo. Heh Heh.), but I wasn't sure it was him until I saw the credits. Heh Heh. The movie's nice. :D Although I don't like football much, I love the storyline. Moo meow!!   After that, I went online, but did not blog, because I was too tired to. HeHe. Well, I went offline at 11+ (after recharging my handphone).    TODAY   HaHa. Today leh, we went to Mrs Chua's house. All of us met at 9.30, but as usual, a lot of cats came late. e set off at about 10, I think. We are taking 965 till the end of TPE. Me and Ji sat together. Gloria sat opposite us and we talked about a lot of things la (me and Ji listened to his Superstar). We got off at the end of TPE and took bus 83 at the opposite. We stopped about 3 stops later, and we were lost. HaHa. After some searching we located her house.  As usual, I didn't bring kum. A lot brought, but some didn't. Heng ar, I am not the extra. Woah! Her house was spacious! Hers was an Executive flat. so many rooms. There's even a green room, which we all suspected was the room for the baby (future baby anyway). Her husband, Chriz, was quite cute. He's very quiet though. Initially, we were quite shy one. We milled about and don't dare to walk about. Mrs Chua brought her wedding photos out. Woah! She looks very beautiful leh! I especially love her in the blue gown! So elegant! She can have different kinds of facial expression de. Sad, love, happy and funny. All kinds! (Hann hear le hor will feel very jealous!) Her husband was also very handsome in his suit(s). One of their symbols of love was a pair plushie of Mickey and Minnie. It signifies them being born in the year of the rat (they are 32 this year). So special. The plushies are sitting on a bench somewhere in the house.   After a while, they decided to play BlackJack (with money of course). At first, Mrs Chua don't allow one, but when she saw, she dont' really cared. I didn't play though. HeHe, partly due to me having no money (I even forgot to ask for lunch money from my Mother. I have to borrow from CQ), and partly due to me having bad experience with gambling (for details, refer to the blog on 1st January, or somewhere around there). I watched Ji play. He lost $16 in total. Only Kelvin Lim won. Heh Heh.   After playing, we decided to go eat lunch, Mrs Chua joined us for lunch. She took us to Compass Point to eat KFC. Me, Ji, WQ and Gloria shared a family meal. O.o We all ate and talked lor. At the end, Hann called. I let him talk to Mrs Chua. Heh Heh. At least he still can talk to her ma. Not so bad right? Heh Heh. We bade farewell to Mrs Chua. It has been an enjoyable experience at her house and with her company. HeHe. (She gave $4 hongbao money. Thanks!).   We took a double-decker bus to Woodlands Interchange. We are going to Jacintha's house to play MahJong/cards. We refers to me, WQ, CQ, Joyce, PY, GaoLuan, JunJie, Gloria and SuPing. HaHa. Now Joyce 'lent' me her orangers to bai nian. HeHe. After some milling about, we started to play. Me, JJ, GL, PY and SP played MahJong. I only won twice. HeHe. I also gambled with the rest for BlackJack. I initially won some (I played 10 cents), but lost all my coins (50 cents) in the end. Heh. Some people are coming back to Jacintha's house for more MahJong tomorrow. (And yes, Auntie gave us $4 also. Thanks!)  Me and Gloria went home at 6.30+ because of the heavy rain. I have to record Simpsons. I also recorded CardCaptor Sakura Movie 2. YaY! I am planning to watch them on Monday, after watching Gloden Globe Awards. :D I ate my dinner and watched a movie on Channel U, Her Fatal Ways 4, starring Carol Cheng. Actually, I didn't know it was her, until Dad told me so. The movie's so nice! I want to see the other 3!! Meow meow meow!   Ar, here I am online.  Hmm, today's a very nice day (save for the rain). Well, I gotta get going now. A busy day is ahead (not really) of me tomorrow. Well, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Xin nian kuai le!! Gong xi fa cai (or in Cantonese, Gong Hei Fak Choi)!!  HaHa. I slept at 2, after playing with my neighbours and surfing the net. When I woke up, I felt terribly terrible. My throat is all clammed up and inflammed. Ergh!!! So horrible! After I forced myself to vomit, I found out that it was phlegm stuck in my throat. My throat felt better, but not really that better. I got a bad bad cold though....Ergh!!!  Dad came home at 10+, and we set off. My brother did not come with us though, he's down with the flu. Poor thing. First place we went to is my paternal grandmother's place. I hate going there lor. Not because of my grandmum. Things are always quiet there lor. No real conversations one. Hate it. I got two hongbaos there. $6 each from Dai Ku Ma (eldest aunt) and grandma.   After that, we went to Bak Liong's house. She's my auntie (paternal side). There is much more livelier, and got my favorite cousin, Felicia. HaHa. There's more talk there and I enjoy it lor. HaHa. Bak Liong gave me $8. O.o!!!   We went to Whampoa to eat lunch. I ate vegetarian hor fun. I just had the luck to sit behind a group of smokers. The smoke avaggrated my runny nose! Idiots! A whole bunch of idiots! I had a very unpleasant time there.  After that, we went to Chun Dao He Pan. We always go there during CNY. It's a tradition. We took pictures, as usual. I posed with the 12 animals of the zodiac and the attractions of the park. This time, the wishing well's bell got bigger and easier to hit. Heh heh. Sure had a lot of fun 'wishing'. This year, there are more shops than usual. There's lesser attractions too. So meowful!  After that, we went to my maternal grandmother's house. O.o She got a DVD recorder and a LCD TV. Mother was so fascinated over them. HaHa. We chatted and ate. I ate a lot of things leh, after visitng 3 homes. Heh heh. Oh yes, Grandmother gave me $12, as usual.   I came back le...oh god. I don't wanna go on le lar...I feel so weak all over. Let me say that total I got from today (plus parents) is $66. I am getting more, of course. Now, Wendy placed a order on me to go rest, or else cannot go her house play mahjong. HaHa.   Okay okay. I end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! CNY Eve!!   We (Me, SL, CQ, WQ, PY and WeeTeng) are going back to RSS today. Before that, we went to MacDonalds to eat breakfast. The girls backed out all of a sudden, and only left me, Ji and WQ to eat breakfast. WQ woke up at 7 (when I called), that lazy pig. Me and Ji finished our breakfast and he didn't get to eat at all, because we have to rush off to meet SL.  SL, WT and PY turned out to be 15 minutes late. HaHa. We waited outside the Hall for them, but we met them outside the school lor. We went to the gallery to watch (and was joined by lotsa Sec5s and 4s. They were terribly rude!) the performance. They was this dragon dance that went on for ages, but exciting too. The choir sang two songs. The first song was relatively unknown, but it was well-sung. The second song, Da Di Hui Chun, was very fast. I think they were too nervous liao. Cannot blame them la. After watching a few more dances, we went down to meet our teachers.  We first met Mrs Chua. HaHa. She invited us to her house to bai nian (actually, we siggested first, but she welcomed us all the same. HeHe). We are going this Sat. We then listened to the teachers singing. Mdm Huang was too high-pitched, and loud. She spoilt the songs. HaHa. Seriously!! Oh oh!! The Mr Kok was dressed up as the God Of Fortune and distributing (throwing, more like) chocolate coins around. HaHa. He came right to us and gave us the chocolate frogs. The juniors were all looking at us jealously. HaHaHa!   After that, we went to look for Mrs Jalil. Did you know she's pregnant? I sure don't. Ji told me she's about a month of so. No wonder la, can't tell ma. She was as friendly as ever. Mrs Tan and Mrs Chua joined us. HaHa. Mrs Tan kept telling us to come back for the Fiesta. Gurmit Singh is coming you know! Coolies! I said that we will sure come back one--to dunk the teachers! Muhahaha! We stayed on to chat more, then we left le. We (with the exception of SL and WT) walked towards Sembawang MRT and took the train towards Causeway.  We ate lunch there. I ate the mian fen guo. soon, HM and Gloria joined us for lunch, coming back from YJ. They then went to play pool, which I totally not intrested in (and have no money either). I went to look for Amanda and Wendy to wish them a happe new year and went back home.  I surfed the Net and played some games until Mother came back from work. HaHa. Some customers tried to come in after 7, but Mother refuse to let them come in ("They complain la, but we heck care! If they come in like that, how can we go back to eat dinner?"). Good job! We finally started on our reunion dinner, steamboat! It was a hearty dinner! Delicious!! Good good! Long time never eat le! The feast ended off with the drinking of sparkling cocktail.   We watched the movie on Channel 8, I went to bath and here I am (see...no tada today!)...online. Tada! (HaHa...I can't resist! :P) I found a new HP Interactive Site, MuggleNet Interactive. The site is so welcoming...and this time, I am actually using myself as the character (not a female one like Storm....hmmmmm). It looks real fun, and I bet I am gonna have fun. :)  Alright, I gotta end this le. I got a lot of things to do (mainly games playing) before going to to play with my neighbors. See ya tomorrow! Gong Xi Fa Cai, blog!

      Oh moo meow!! Tuesday meows at the duck!  Hmm..today leh, I went to the 883 with Mother. HaHa. True, I ate roti prata as planned. HaHa. Woah, today the market and Shop N Save was terribly crowded. I guess everybody's buying their last minute goodies. I guess they won't want to buy too early because it won't be fresh. Yeah. That's why everyone buys now la. Heh. We brought some kuehs and buns (for tomorrow's praying) and flowers. O.o! The thorns are terribly pricky (duhz).   We came back at 10, and at 11, Dad called. We are going to Woodgrove's NTUC to buy some kum (mandarin oranges). HaHa. We also brought a lot of fruits and more buns. O.o The kums turn out to be not suitable to pai nian, ahhh, whatever la. HaHaHa.  After that leh, we went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. I ate the hotplate beancurd rice thingy. Nice sia! After that, we went to market again We brought more kueh (again? HaHa...look at the hassle of CNY. I enjoy it though. Heh.). Then, we went back lor.  HaHa. I tell you hor, I slept for 5 hours (from 1-6). I just laid down on my mother's bed, closed my eyes, and just slept lor. Pig right? I think I was very tired. Or extra sleepy. Meow moo! I dreamt a lot of dreams. The most interesting on is that me and my 8 siblings (fictional) were jailed for 9 years for stealing a secret formula of a scientist (must be that report I saw in TNP!! There's a report on someone drugging a scientist today)!!  HaHa. I was like hugging my eldest sister and the police officer (I said "you were a great officer". She replied with "you have a great would-be-prisoner". Crazy dream!) before I went into the jail. I remember it being very spacious, and before I know it, a year passed and me and my siblings celebrated. HaHa!! I forgot the rest le la...I got so many dreams.   After waking (and stopped dreaming silly dreams), me and Dad went to 768 to eat dinner. I ate fried rice, he ate pork ribs noodles. We also brought some plates (for the altar thingy) and some vegetarian thingy for praying. Woah. So many things!   We came back, I bathed and watched some TV. SL asked us to go back to RSS tomorrow to look at the celebrations and pay visits to our teachers. HaHa. I want to visit Mrs Chew leh. See what the others say first la. Hmm....  Okay, I gotta get going le. See ya tomorrow! CNY is gonna be here soon! So exciting!! Night blog!

      Hey hey! Moo meow meow!  Woah, I woke up early today. We are going out to eat breakfast and buy last minute new year goodies. HaHa. Father picked us up at 8.20+ to go out.  First, we went to Marsiling market to eat breakfast and buy a few groceries. I ate fried carrot cake, siew kueh and tau hua. HaHa. Whenever I go Marsiling, I would always eat a lot of things one. My pig la. Heh! After that leh, Mother went to market and brought some lotus stem (lian ou), apparently to boil lian ou soup (dunnoe when). She also brought some CNY decorations.  My mother's back started aching. She decided to go to the Yishun doctor. Guess what? There's a long long queue. I stayed inside my father's car, eating Mentos (I asked my parents to buy a packetful for me. I ate about 10 Mentos, I think) while listening to the radio on my father's car. Somehow, the radio spoilt and I can hardly hear the lyrics. Why, it took me until the chorus for me to realize that the song is "Ode To My Girl" by Sheik Haikal. The static is driving me nuts. I guess I waited about 1.5-2 hours in the air-conless car before they are done. I was so sweaty by then. Ayioh!   After the insufferable agony, we went to Woodlands Central to eat lunch and go shop at Sheng Shiong. Ha. We couldn't find a parking space, so crowded! Okay, that was an exxaggeration. We did find one, very far awasy from Sheng Shiong though. Meow! Me and Mom ate hokkien prawn mee, Dad queued up to deposit money in his account. He ate a lot during breakfast, so he don't want to eat lunch. After lunch, we went to Sheng Shiong. We brought  hams  ! Finally! YaY! It did not run out of stocks after all. They were all in bags, already packed. HaHa. We also brought more CNY decorations and veggies. After that, we went home lor.  I went to Wendy's house shortly. Father drove me directly to Wendy's block. It was raining real heavily. Yeah Wendy, now you know why I didn't get wet. Ha. I watched her pack her wardrobe. She has a lot of clothes man! Ha. Soon, we opened the box of mahjong Wendy brought. Woah lao! That Wilson (Wendy's colleague) go and wrap the MahJong all in scotch-tapes. So difficult to open, and there were remants of the tape on the tiles, making them sticky. We had to wash them, which is very very difficult. Ergh!  Halfway, Wendy's father came back. I was like O.o, because I don't really have a good impression of her Dad ma. We continued washing and washing, until her Dad volunteered to help us wash. So good of him. HaHa.   At 4 something, KL came over lor. Actually, Wendy went to fetch him form 888. It was pouring man! He brought chicken rice for me and Wendy (I paid him back of course!). HaHa.  After washing and wiping the tiles, we were ready to play. Me, KaiLun, Wendy and Wendy's mom played MahJong. Woah lao. Wendy's mother and KaiLun so good at the game. They even know what tile each other wants to win. HaHa. Wendy's mother even know I got a pong when I picked up a tile. I only said "Ohh..." softly. She's an expert man! According to her, she hasn't played for 10 years. Woah. Oh yes, we played in the corridor. HaHa. What an odd place to play MahJong. We took a sort break to eat dinner, then resumed playing. In total, I only won 2 times. Auntie won the majority of the games, and everyone won at least once. HaHa. We stopped at 7, when I have to go back. What a good game. I am looking forward to Thursday's game, when we can play longer! HaHa!!  I came back, bathed (so wet!! It was raining. Rain rain rain! Ergh!) and watched some TV. Tada. I am online. (I use tada a lot nowadays. HaHa!) Tomorrow I am eating roti prata for breakfast, and probably on Wednesday too. See, I already planned out my breakfast. Tomorrow Mother and I are buying the mandarian oranges from Shop N Save. Looks like their oranges are the cheapest after all. Ha!   alright, looks like I better go now. See, this entry is longer than Sat's and Sun's. HaHaHa! Told ya so. Alright, stopping le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Sun-meow-day!  Hmm..today morning was the same lor. Except hor, one idiotic thing spoilt my mood. I ate laksa. However, the laska contains those idiotic leaves. Spoil the whole flavour of the laksa!! ERGH!! Worse of all is hor, my mother told her not to put the leaves inside, but she ignored my mother. Even when my mother complained about it hor, she still ignored my mom. WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS? Idiot leh! I told my mother hor, don't pay until the food is ready. If that idiot adds leaves, I told my mother to just walk off and don't pay. Come on lor. I wanted a specific kind of laka, and I am paying for it. If the vendor is not going to give me that, then I am not paying for it. Spoil the morning!!! After eating breakfast, I watched TV lor.   After lunch and HZGG, I slept a little. Lazy pig. HaHa. After waking up, I decided to play this new online game called Priston Tale. HaHa. As usual, I became a magician. In any game, I would not become anything except something in the magic line. HaHa. :D I played for some 3 hours, until I levelled up to level 3. HaHa. Oh well.  I came online for an hour, then went down to buy dinner for me and brother. We ate dinner and watched TV at the same time. Then I bathed and tada, I am here.   HaHa. I am like, so nothing to write one. HaHa. But rest assured, tomorrow will be filled with lotsa things. Oh, I cna't promise that, but it would be longer lor. HaHa. Tomorrow I am going out ma. HaHa.  Therefore, I am ending this liao. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey blog. Today has been terribly boring. Yeah. HaHa.   Hmm..today morning was a bore. Yeah. I woek up at 8.30, bathed, ate breakfast and watched TV. I came online at 11 after Pokemon. I bascially surfed around and chatted with XC lor. Yeah.                                                                         Mother cooked lunch at 12+. Instant noodles la, nothing much. Moo meow meow. I also downloaded Wendy's mp3s. Ayioh...so idiotic. I can only download like, 4? The rest are either unavilable, corrupt or the stupid people changed the file names. Darn those idiots!  HaHa. I can tell you I slept from 1 till about 2.50+. I just lie down on my bed and slept, waking up about like 15-30 mins in between. HaHa. I am such a lazy cat. I am so sleepy! *Yawn*  After that, I helped Janet burn a CD containing installation for Dreamweaver. HaHa. It cna't work though....hmmm. Then, I surfed the Net, play Neopets, this and that la.   I went to bath at 6, came out, ate dinner while watching my Sat shows. Then, tada, I am here. HaHa. I don't know what to say liao...  I think I stop here liao lor. Such a short (and boring? or sweet?) blog. Ha! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Today's been super busy. Ha. Not really la. Just the morning and early afternoon.   Hmm...today morning I woke up quite early to go to the doctor. HaHa. So early moo meow! Father picked us up at 8am. We managed to get to be the head of the queue.      We went to eat at the coffeeshop near the clinic. We three ate kueh chap. Moo meow!! After that, we went back to wait for my turn. I read my book (Clues to Harry Potter), I still haven't finished it yet. Oh moo meow!   The doctor diagnosed my chest pains as eating too much ice. Something like the coldness constrict blood flow/artieries/veins. Something like that la. Due to bulk ordering of medicines, the total fees came up to $125. O.O!  Oh yes, Mother brought taufu back to cook. You see ar, the person packaged it in a incorrect way. He just put the taufu into a small read plastic bags. The edges could cut into the taufu and split them apart!!! The correct way should put the taufu into clear plastic bags full of water (like how you put small fishes). Therefore, we have to hold the taufu in our palms, and cannot hold it like how you hold a plastic bag normally. Yeah... and I have to guard the taufu in the backseat, to prevent it from being squashed/cut/damaged. Yes.   After the visit to the doctor's we went to some plant greenhouse in Jalan Kayu. They wanted to buy some kak (those orange thingys) plants, which are going on an offer, $18 instead of $48. Well, one glance can tell why they placed them on offer. The plants were so small and puny...some dead, some very young. Not very ideal. Yeah..We managed to get two plants that don't look so bad. The first one we picked was of excellent quality (we found out that it was placed accidentally in that section, and should be sold for $48. HaHa! We got lucky!). We also brought this bamboo thingys. Those got tiers one. It's supposed to be very lucky. We brought one three-tiered for $5. It's the ONLY one that none of the bambboos died (and you wonder the cheapness of the price).   We have to load it into the taxi. We placed it on the space between the front seats and the back seat (where u put your feet). During the jounrney back home, I had to put my feet on the two pots, pressing them down so they won't fall onto the back seat. I am also trying to read my book and look after the taufu. I am so busy!         After that, we went back, relax a bit, and went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. I ate chicken rice. After that, Dad went to the bank to exchange new notes (for hongbaos la). Mother was angry at him for some reason (I know but I don't wanna tell).   I came back and started to clean the floor lor. I vaccumed first, then mopped the floor. HaHa. My first time vaccuming and mopping. So tiring! I was sweating like shit. Ha! I didn't vacuum properly, because of the stupid rotating thingy la. HaHa. :P anyway. HaHa.   After that, I went online surfing. Most qi shu lin things happened. MSN Messenger and Neopets decided to go on maintence, leaving me nothing to play with (more of Neopets.... MSN no cats online) . HaHa. I ate dinner, and the taufu taste a bit strange (probably left in the car for so long). Hmm...  I was almost being chased by a bisexual that XC got to knew. Let's just said he fled upon seeing my pic. HAHA! I dunnoe why he wants to chase after me in the first place? The way I speak is nice meh? O.O How intriguing.  Okay le. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya blog!  Hmm...I woke up at the same time too. Hmm...today we are going to AMK Central to eat breakfast. Parents want to do shopping there. At 9.20, my father picked us up (so late! My stomach is growling from hunger!).  I ate cuttlefish with fish slices porridge. O.o My parents ate prawn mee and curry noodles. We shared a plate of carrot cake between us. After eating, we went to the market behind. We brought some  kak , those small little orranges. A pair of them for 80 cents. We brought 5 pairs, so that's $4. Next, we went to AMK Ave 5. There's supposed to be this wet market, but 9it was under renovation, so the vendors moved to this empty space near the building to set up stalls. Yeah. We brought some incense and altar thingys for the family altar. Yeah. Moo meow meow.  After that, we went to Woodlands Central (O.o We are going 'Central' today). They want to go Sheng Shiong to buy stuff. They said they aren't gonna buy much, but hor, they always buy a lot de. Today was no exception. Hmm....we brought more prawns and cuttlefish for steamboat, and crabs for tonight! YaY. We also brought 2 bowls of sharksfin soup (made out of shark cartillage) for me. Ha. After the shopping, we went to eat lunch at the nearby food center.   We came back at 1+. I read the New Paper and watched Dad clean the altar for awhile. After that, I ate sharkfin and came online. Frankly speaking, after eating so much sharkfin, I am getting sick of them. Surprise surprise. HaHa. No way man! I am not gonna eat sharkfin until CNY, when Mom is gonna cook it herself (with REAL sharkfin). HaHa. I went online till dinnetime. There was a short power trip, caused by a fused bulb. Hmp!   Hmm...dinner was some steamed century eggs. Then, I bathed and came out to watch TV (and read my book). Then, tada. I am here. HaHa.  Auntie Linda always sends us a CNY greeting card every year, and we always send them back one. Auntie Linda always spell my brother, Edwin, as Alvin. This year, she managed to get it right. HaHa. For so many years, she actually thought my brother was Alvin, until Mother corrected her last year. HAHA! Well, interesting tidbit for ya.   I am analyzing WQ and his lack of interest in romantic stuff (like appreciating love quotes). Hmm..Due to privacy issues, i cna't post my analysis here. However, friends of his can easily guess la. Yes. It's THAT easy.   I gotta end blogging le. Chilli crabs are waiting for moi (I can smell the rich chilli frangance!! Meow moo!)!! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Oh meow meow!   Today leh, I woke up at 8.30. After bathing, I followed Mom to 883, to eat breakfast, to buy groceries. I think I would be doing that everyday. HaHa. I ate the what ar, fishball noodles. We brought 8-Days then I walked around, while reading that mag, Shop And Save trailing my mother while she records price changes. One idiotic old lady poked me in my back, and gestured rudely that I am blocking her path. EXCUSE ME! THERE ARE POLITER WAYS TO TELL SOMEONE TO MOVE! I glared at her when I made way. Idiot. After that, we went to the market to buy some ingredients for steamboat (reunion dinner). Okay, we did not. We almost brought prawns, but we forgot. Tomorrow buy lor. Mother brought some big pieces of ginger, saying that such big pieces are hard to come by. The world can do without ginger.  I came back, went online. Oh,. Kinokuniya called me while I was away. I had a feeling they would call this morning, but I didn't bring my phone. i shoulda listened to my instinct. They said the book I wanted, New Clues to Harry Potter Book 5, came. YaY! I yesterday placed an online order on two books, the New Clues and The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter. I am anxiously waiting for the online receipt to come, so I can collect it. Me and manda chatted. I encouraged her to join Singapore Idol. Wendy and SuPing also. They got great voices man! I would like to see them join, and win! :D They have the ability to lor. Yep!  YaY! The email order came in! I immediately rushed to Kinokuniya to get it. Yay!! These books are about exposing hints/clues in the Harry Potter series. The first one tells us the hints already revealed. The second book in the series (Book 5 Clues) makes the readers think for themselves. How smart of the author. I came home at 1.30+.  I ate my lunch (nasi lemak) while reading the first book. Woah! The book really broaden the HP world. I can see very clearly that JK had already hidden clues for what's coming in the later books (even up to book 5. This shows that she already had all of it planned. HaHa!) in the first book. I never noticed these clues until they were pointed out. How wodnerous! I began to appreciate the HP series more and more. It's a series full of mysteries, suspense right till the end. :) What a fun clues-unravelling book!  Hmm...after a few chapters and lunch, I went online lor. Play Gunbound, chat...then onto dinner. After dinner, came back, bathed and watched TV. The new series is nice. I like the character ShuiXi. Yes Yes. I read a few chapters too. Okay, after that, I came online and here I am, blogging.  I think hor, only after CNY then I would start looking for a job. Yeah...I lazy la. HaHa. Moo meow meow! I am so excited about buying ingredients for reunion dinner! HaHa!

      Heya!   Moo meow meow! Today leh, I woke up early to go to YJ. I met Gloria at 6.45 and we walked to Admiralty Station lor. We meet up with everybody (surprise surprise. That idiot arse was not really late, but was late all the same. can't he get up early? i bet that vainpot is styling himself in front of the mirror every morning. Anyone who knows him can basically tell already. What a narcissist.). We got to school.  Yeah. They went to their own class, while I sat in the canteen reading my book. Soon, i was approached by a teacher. She told me to go up to the office to appeal lor. Luckily I was not scolded or anything la. I was told by the clerk to wait for Mrs Kwang, the one in-charge for appeals.  That teacher looked at my report book and commented that my grades were not that good. Bitch. HELLO! My grades were good hor! Darn you. Then, I said that I come to YJ because PJ don't offer me the subject combination I wanted. That Kwang said that "So if PJ offer you Chem Bio, you would choose PJ right?". Yeah, I admit. She got it lor. I have no loyalty whatsoever towards YJ. Fianlly, she said the transfers were closed and it would be a real hassle to get me inside, besides, I am not loyal to YJ and I got bad grades. I was really polite and said "I am sorry for bothering you". Ayioh!! Idiot. Their bad for losing me then. Hello lor. People are quitting YJ right and left, and you are being picky on someone who wants to come in? Please la. Consider yourself lucky someone actually wanted to come inside lor.   I asked my parents to fetch me. We are going to Marsiling market to eat and buy some groceries. I ate black carrot cake. After that, I went back to bath, while parents went to Sheng Shiong to buy more groceries and two bowls of shark fins for me. YaY!     Hmm....shark fins taste as nice as ever. After some web surfing, I cooked noodles for myself. Ended up overcooking them, taste so soft. At 2, me and Dad left for the bank to withdraw my money.  Oh my god. The queue's so long. Extend from the inside to the outside lor. I was like very very sian. I learnt at the end that I have been queueing for 2 hours! Oh my! 2 hours of inching along. The queues can kill (it rhymes). I got my $70, which I am gonna use it to buy my two books (Harry Potter hint/clue books) from Kinokuniya . Yeah.   After that, I went to Metro to return Wendy her comic book. It looks like she reserved a MahJong set! YaY! Can play with her le! Moo meow!! We are planning to play on the second day of CNY. Anycat is welcome!  I came online, went online for awhile and went to eat dinner at 768. I came back, bathed, watched some TV and then came online again. Ha.   Seriously hor, I don't know what I am gonna do now lor. Probably stay home and rot. ACtually, not. I am gonna self-study at home. I can also go find a job. Sigh. I am confused liao. Moo meow meow!  I think I log off le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya moo meow!  Ayiah...today hor, I am thrown into a fix la. Early in the morning, Chun called Metro. Well, they are not hiring us after all. They only want temp workers, and we have to go work in Marina. ...  I was like...jobless lor. I can either stay at home until release of O Level results or go to YJ to study. Yeah...I was contemplating these options lor.  Hmm... I ate bread for breakfast, while mother went to 883 to get a haircut and buy groceries. I did nothing except to surf the net and chat with WQ. For lunch, me and Mother went to 768 to eat Pig Organ Soup (with rice). Yeah...  In the afternoon also lazed around lor. Hmm... after giving it lotsa thoughts, I decided to go to YJ. Me lazing around the house and rotting away is not a viable option. I'll go mental! Actually hor, it was WQ who made me make this decision. He's doing his GP homework, and I realized so much that I craved for homework. Esepcially GP, Chem and Bio! I wanna do homework! (I know this is atypical for a student.... but I really miss school! I can really feel Manda's and Wendy's longing for school... Once a student, always a student!) Yeah, I am appealing tomorrow. Meow.....  Hmm...we ate dinner, watched TV, and tada. I am here. I think I end here liao la. Yet another of my short blogs. Oh well. Wish me luck tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey!   Hmm...nothing much happened today. Watched TV and came online in the morning lor. I ate instant noodles for lunch.  I came online, played Gunbound with CQ. I lost so terribly. HaHa. CQ's a newbie too. Oh well. I haven't been playing for so long! After that, someone mysteriously messaged me. It's one of YingYing's friend, asking me for help on locus. Yeah, so helped him a bit lor. After that, I played my Sims. Woah! Long time never play that le. After finishing, I went online la.  At 6 something, I went to eat dinner. Today, Mother cooked, due to my special request. I don't wanna buy food outside again la. Eat eat eat, watched some tV then went to bath.  Hmm. Chun just called. She wanted to find out Metro's number. It looks like she wanna go interview for sales associate too. I asked if she wanna go together. She agreed lor. We are meeting after she called me tomorrow. She's calling HQ first, to find out if there are vacancies (sure got one la...). If there's only one place, may the best person win then (got more than one de la. The receptionist told me there's some, and I don't think anyone went to interview on Friday lor. Weekends no interviews). It would be cool though, me and Chun going into Metro together. HeHe. I also cut my fingernails (surpirse surprise! I am not an advocate of nail-cutting, as you all know). Good impression counts, and good impression includes neatness. Yeah.  Well, yeah. So ends my blog for today. See ya tomorrow with news! Good luck to me!! Night blog!

      Heya!   Today leh, the whole lot of us went back to RSS for the CCA Open House. HaHa. Before that, we went to eat at Mac's for breakfast. Me, Gloria and HuiLinh met first, then proceeded to Woodlands.   We met CQ, HM and SL. SL's colleagues came too. HaHa. Joyce and PY joined us later. I ate the Egg MacMuffin Meal. O.o! Quite okay lar. Me, CQ, Joyce, PY and Gloria first went to Joyce's house to get her donation cards, while the rest walked to school. Then, we took the train to Sembawang and walked to school. They discusssed a lot about JCs. HaHa.   We met up with Wendy and Chun in school. We went to the choir room first. Woah.... that idioitc Vincent became terribly crazy. He knocked his head against the wall repeatedly. Everyone said he's seeking attention, but he said he's punishing himself. Kinda stupid lar....Everybody don't like him. I can see why though...HaHa. Oh yes, Mdm Harn is on maternity leave (she's gonna be in a foul mood once her leave's over), so Mrs Tan temporary took over. O.o!!   We seniors went up to the gallery to watch the show. I was reading this comic of Wendy's. W.I.T.C.H. It's a nice comic! I love it! Of course, I love everything about magic... I'll be buying it and subsequent volumes! :D   After a long long speech by Mr Kok, the performance started. I wanna skip straight to the last segment, the choir performance. The first song, Under The Sea, honestly sucked. Lots of out-of-pitches....too high. Oh my... The second and last song, a medley of Madonna' songs, were better than the first one. Thank god! I noticed the choir bcame more relaxed...started swaying their bodies and all. Yeah. Good good. Did I mention that the compere (the male one) sucks? Oh god!!!  We watched some performances by the UGs. Ayiah...every year the same one la. Got a Kok Mun solo some more. HaHa! Sucks la.... :P After that, it was choir promotion time. Actually hor, we didn't much promotion la. We seniors stood around and chatted with each other. O.O!! After milling here and there, and some promotional attempts, we left at 12+.   All of us (the original grp who met earlier minus Sl's colleagues) went to Woodlands Central to eat. I ate laksa and a desert (dunnoe what name). After that, we walked around lor. At a shop right, me and  PY saw these really beautiful zodiac jigsaw puzzles that were selling really cheap ($5 for 1000 pieces, $3 for 500 pieces). However, Causeway's Jigsaw World sell these for $20+ you know. The cheap cheap ones are obviously fakes! O.o Can even tell from the box liao.   We went to Sheng Shiong and walked around. SL brought some sweets. After that, me, Gloria and HL went home together. I bathed, ate sharkfin (fake one la...$2 a bowl...but nice if you put lotsa pepper) and came online. after that, went out to eat dinner and rushed back to watch my Sat shows.   Here I am online, listening to my CDs again. Club Beats now ma. I now talking to XC. woah! His Taylor Collegue so good! I envy him you know. I wanted to go one....but I have no money. Sigh! Moo moo meow!  Before I go, I wanna express my well-wishes to WQ, who is sick in bed with the flu! I know it's hard on you...but you must cheng zhe! You can do it one!! Okay...gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Friday is a meowing day!!  Early in the morning, me and Mom had to go to the Yishun doctor. Something about sores on my legs la. HaHa. We had to walk great distances (actually, a same long road 4 times. Quite hard to explain here...). We also brought 1kg of melon seeds. Eee...kinda mouldy, some of them. Most are quite okay though.  HaHa. I came back at 10 and I immediately went off to the Metro interview. It wasn't quite hard to locate Tower B. The receptionist didn't believe that I am 16. she said "Why aren't you in school?" I said I graduated le, took my Os last year and all. She then told me that the staff is not here today. Wasted my time man. HaHa.  I came home just in time to eat my lunch (fried rice) and go to the ICA (last time used to be the SIR building) to make IC. My brother's. I just brought my OotP along and read and read and read. After IC-making, we went to Whampoa to eat the heavenly duck porridge. Hmmmm!  I came back, read more OotP and fell asleep promptly at 3.30 on the sofa. I was so damn tired. What did I dream? Yeah. I dreamt that 2 thieves (which include a heavyset woman....almost Hagrid-like, actually) came into our house brazenly. They came to steal my brother's computer. Something about valuable info in ther (they input the info in....something like that la). Before I know it, hours passed, they left. The house was in a mess. I called the police, they refuse to come ("Put down the phone!! They are gonna kill you if they know you are calling us!"). Then, my brother woke me up at 5. He's informing me that he's going to his friend's house. HaHa. I continued sleeping some more until the sound of vaccum woke me up (father's vaccum). I also fell back asleep (see how tired I was?) then miraculously woke up just before 7 to watch Ben Yue. I slept for about 3.5 hours ba...ha!  Ben Yue was great. I loved the part where XiHe was killed by the Emperor and FuXi. So good! So sad the sotry between Chang'e and Huo Yi... star-crossed lovers, they are. Moo meow! I also ate my dinner while watching.  Hmm... nothing to say le hor? Okaylor...I gotta go le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya!   I went to YJ today. Sneaky little cat me! At the main gate, I nearly exposed myself...I was talking about sneaking in at the walkway, when a teacher was behind me.   I had to hide in the toilet for morning assembly. HaHa. I read my Order of the Phoenix. At 8 something, I came out to check...and a man was looking at me. I was like so damn  scared. I thought he was a teacher or something. It turned out that he was a cleaner! Oh! Thank my lucky stars! WQ came to fetch me later. What a long long wait. And a sweaty one too.                              The first lecture was Maths C. Woah! The teacher is not bad wor. He's funny, he's good. We did indices rule la. Quite easy wor... He got a girlfriend, by the way. That's what he told us. Oo....  There's this short little break. I ate some cup noodles, a Tom Yam flavour one. woah! I missed this brand man! I love it!   After that, I went to WQ's classroom for GP lesson. HaHa! When I told his classmates I sneaked in, all of them went "woah!". HAHA! This GP teacher hor, she marked attendance. I was so damn worried of getting caught. She never asked for my name and all that....either she's idiotic or she closed one eye. Anyway, she's such a vile bitch. She's exactly like Professor Umbridge. Behind all her sweet, innocent rules are seeds of discord, to be sowed within the class. Rules like "If one cat don't pass up homework, tha cat won't get punished. Instead, the whole class." are exactly creating disharmony of relations between classmates! So Umbridge-gy. Idiotic. She's a Mrs. Who is so unlucky and stupid to marry her? Blind. I almost got caught to attend a class of rules and regulations. Stupid right?   After that leh, I attened Physics lecture. The Physics teacher, Mr Leong, is such a goofball. HaHa. He likes The Matrix and LOTR series. He hates the army too. Yeah. These are observations made by me. I so wu liao right? HaHa. Physics lecture not bad laos la. Quite enjoyable. :)  After that, I went to the canteen to wait for Gloria coming down for her lunch (one hour later). I cannot go to WQ's CT and MT class, because both lessons are taught by his form teacher. I cannot appear there one. I read my OotP there. Ha.  Gloria they all came down, I ate chicken rice for lunch. HaHa. I revealed that I sneaked in again, not realizing that a pair of teachers were sitting next to me. Oh well! I slept for a while, and taught Huimin some AO-Maths. Sets theory ar. Yeah. HaHa.  Soon, Janet and WQ came down. Four of us went to some coffeeshop to eat lunch. Only WQ ate there, as three of us had already eaten. After that, we went back lor.  Hmm....I called the Metro. They said no positions left for temps in Woodlands. I can try being a permanent staff la. Tomorrow I am going to the walk-in interview. HaHa. I consulted Amanda on what to say. Bascially hor, give politcally correct answers (which do not apply to real life). Yeah. HaHa. I must look good you know! So meowing one!  Okay, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Moo meow meow!  Okay... before I start narrating bout today, let me tell you a dream I had last night (actually, this early morning). I dreamt that me and Hann lost our appeals. Yeah...HaHa.     Okay...today leh, I was kinda in a wreck. About the posting of results lor. Hann also. He's so scared.  I was like feeling scared for the wrong reasons lor. I was kinda scared that my appeal is successful.  Okay, later on, the Mr Whoever (in-charge of planning of classes) said that 70% of the appeals are successful. I was like "What?" and I prayed that I am in the 30%. Oh my god...i am getting so desperate.   We had this mass dance first. HaHa. We danced lotsa lotsa times. After mass dance, we began making costume for our mascot. Me, Mingyao and two others worked on our knight's cape. HaHa.  After that, we went to the telematch. Yay!! We Zulu won all the 4 matches in a row (last 4 matches...we got second for the first match)! YAY!!!! We did Zenith proud man! Go Zenith!! Yes, you cna guess. I had fun. :)  Okay...at the end right..me and Hann found out that our appeals are unsuccessful. (Oh my god! My prophetic dream came true! I am a Seer!! O.o) Hann wanna go appeal, but I don't want to stay onto PJ le. I already made up my mind from the start. The v.p told us that Bio is full le. Bullshit la. If our A-maths passed, I think Bio can still have us lor.   At the end right, Zenith got champion!!! WEEE!!!! Zenith Zenith! Waah lang zee Zenith phua bey ton! SONG BO (In Hokkien means that Zenith is unbeatable! It's part of our cheer)!! WEEE!! Zenith Zenith Zenith....Zenith!!  Okay....me and Hann went to Causeway Point lor. I wanted to find Wendy to talk, and to eat there also. Me and Hann go eat first, finding Wendy later. I ate the what, Claypot Chicken Rice. Eeee... the rice so chao ta one...not nice. I am so hungry now!  We went to find Wendy at the Metro storeroom. I was caught by two supervisors, and almost got Wendy into trouble. Luckily, her supervisors were like "closed one eye" lor...At first they were angry la...but they very lenient de... We moved to the open to talk. Me, Wendy and Hann talked. About our choices. About working in Metro (I went to the counter and got address for HQ). About this and that.  Yeah...I went away at 7, when my father called and told me to go home.  Actually hor, I already made plans. On Friday, I will go to Metro HQ to interview. Sat I go to Open House. Tomrrow, I have a choice of going to YJ or staying at home. See what my mother say first. HaHa. WQ they all can help me sneak in. HeHe. I just wanna experience how lecture is like lor. If I never experience, I will be doing an injustice to myself. HaHa.   I gotta go now. Ya know...watch Charmed. That's why my blog is so rushed. Okay? See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya. After some dilly-dallying, I am now blogging. Yeah.  Today leh, I was very hesistant about going to orientation. Haiyah....no mood liao lor. I always go early one leh. They all come so late some more...  HaHa! During the attendance taking, the teacher always leave me and MingYao out lor!! For two staight days, she marked us absense. Luckily we managed to correct her in the end. Haiyo. Actually hor, we can leave right away, since ya know, she marked us absent and all. Might as well be really absent. HaHa.   In the assembly, an announcement was made that all former choir and Chinese Ochestra members were to meet. I was like...ooh. It looks like they wanted the choir members into the PJ Choir. There's this rule or some sort, about it being obligatory to go back to your old CCA. Of course, there's this audition, which I can fail easily (my pitching sucks. I asked the teacher about audition failing, she said "I don't thinka ynone would fail the audition, given you all have been in choir for 4 years.". There are some special cases lor, like those who can't pitch!! O.o!). PY was so angry at this system, because she hates choir. Never seen her this angry before. O.o!  After the thingy, I went over to the CO group (wait for my friend Ming Yao). HAHa. The teacher mistook me as a CO member. I don't wanna sign the list ma, so I said "Don't gimme". The teacher said "You can run but you can't hide". Hello!! I am only an accompaniment. Meow meow meow!   After the fiacso, we went for games. Woah. This time not bad ar... Even though we only won once. HaHa. I was running along the track to the other end when my group suddenly shouted "Go Kelvin Go!" Woah! That's such a huge morale booster. I ran much faster. HaHa! This is the first time I felt so happy too. HeHe.   After games, we went for breaks. Then, we went up the hall to complete the mass dance. Ayioh...not like i wanna say leh. My dance partners for today and yesterday not fun one....so shy....and clumsy. My luck! Meow!  Then, we went down for break again. I ate chicken rice. We went up to the hall, and sat down to discuss our mascot. Yeah, this and that. We were given a lunch break, but since we alreadt ate, we remained in the hall for games. HaHa. All require some embrassing forfeit ones. HaHa! Heng ar...I never forfeitted. HaHa.  The rest of the time until school ends was spent learning cheers and saying them. Moo meow! I had to stay back for quite a while ro wait for CQ and Hann, whose group are dicussing/doing the costume for mascot. Yeah...wait till 5+ something, then we set off lor.  I dropped at Woodlands, and went to Metro to find Manda and Wendy. I caught Amanda just before leaving work (she was hanging back clothes). both of us went up to the linen (it was pronounced as li-nen. I always pronounce it as lie-nen.) department to look for Wendy, who is working in the afternoon shift.  We chatted for quite a bit, then me and Amanda went home. Moo meow!  Sigh... you say how. After visiting Metro, I have such a powerful urge to go work there. Sigh.... see la.... I dunnoe what decision to make you know. I don't think I am informing the principal le la. I just don't turn up for lessons lor.  Moo meow!  Sigh! I don't know I don't know I DON'T KNOW!! SIGH!!!!!  I gotta go le... See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya...   Ya know (actually, you don't), I can't get to read the my blog pages. Every blog Im treid to access redirected me to Blogger's main page. Thankfully, it is not only me. All the Singnet Broadband users are affected. I sent a letter to the help people, they haven't replied yet....Sigh.   That problem is why I didn't blog yesterday. I don't feel like blogging la..... perfectionist me. Anyhoo, I decided to blog today. So yeah.   SUNDAY   Morning nothing much happened la. Ywah...only afternoon is exciting enough to worth mentioning.  In the afternoon, we went out to Chinatown. Mainly to buy Chinese New Year goodies. Family tradition. HaHa. Woah.. by the time we reached Chinatown (12.30), the carparks and all were so full man! We managed to find a parking space up the high levels of a carpark oppopsite People Park Centre. HaHa. (Oh yes, I saw a gay couple holding hands. Such a rare sight. Gay couples rarely hold hands in public one...hahaha!)  We walked all the way to Maxwell Food Centre to eat our lunch. So fun! We brought some appetizers, like rojak and popiah. I ate century eggs porridge, while the rest ate some claypot chicken rice (got big bowl for 3 cats). HaHa. Porridge was kinda hot...but nice. The claypot chicken's rice was nice too. HaHa!   After lunch, we went to walk around Chinatown lor. My parents looked at plants (they always buy plants for CNY one...and the fruits will end up dropping all over the corridor. HaHa!) and after that, we moved on to the main streets of Chinatown. Ogh boy...it sure was crowded. We stopped to buy peanuts from a 'famous' stall. There was even a Channel U guy filming as we brought peanuts. I wondered if he caught me tasting the melon seeds and peanuts and giving my comments (rather loudly) to my parents about them. HaHa!   Next, we went to Mei Zhen Xiang (forgot the English name le, so I used the pinyin name) to buy bakgua. My brother saw 3 Caucasians buying 5g of bagua. That's equivalent to 1 piece. HaHa. That costs 25 cents. I think they wanted to try how bakgua taste like. HaHa!!   Hm...after that nothing much happened le la. We went back home to rest lor. My parents went out to Sheng Shiong, while me and brother stayed at home to play the computer. We saw a bush fire (extinguished) along our way back. It's in Woodlands area (monday's TNP got report).  For dinner, we went to Thompson Road's Kampong Chicken stall to eat kampong chicken. HaHa. It was okay...unlike normal chicken. The skin is less oily (well, kampong chicken has less fat and cholestrol) and the meat is a bit tight. Overall, okay.   We then went to the nearby Thompson Plaza to buy new sport shoes for me. HaHa. I need a new pair of sport shoes to wear to JC. There's no designs there I like, so I didn't go there. I went to Causeway Point instead. I found a shoe I like in the sporting goods store on the second floor (near where the restuarant is...I forgot the name...). My mother also brought me a pair of sandals, because my is getting very worn out. Moo meow!  I came back, took a bath and went online. At 10+, we opened two bottles of sparkling juice (grape juice), because today is my brother's birthday. Happy birthday to you!! Moo meow meow!    MONDAY   Ayiah, I don't think I shall elaborate too much on getting to school, just that it takes 16 minutes to reach CCK station from my house by my father's taxi.  At the flag raising, I was kinda surprised. It was very automatic lor. Just stand around, and the anthem starts immediately one. Not like RSS, where the principal/v. principle/teachers-in-hcarge have to repeatedly call students to settle down). Woah!      After that, our group went for the school tour. We toured around the school  recongise the blocks and special rooms. After the tour, our clan (consisting of 5 groups) came together and learnt cheers. We even learnt a counter-cheer for another group. HaHa. Then, we went for a break. Lunch break right? Yeah... Ji and Hann was not there, so I sticked around with Ming Yao and his friends.   After that, we went up to the hall to learn how to dance to the song of "Let's Get Loud" by J Lo. HaHa. It's mass dance...and we have to partner a person of an opposite sex. HaHa. I got kinda messed up in most of my dance steps. Too fast for moi. HaHa!  After that, it is time for clans cheering, booing, and cheers/songs learning. Kinda boring at the songs learning, almost wanted to fall asleep le (sorry le, Jonathon. Jonathon led the song-singing ma...haha). We ended at 4. Woo! Half an hour earlier! HaHa!  I reached home at 5+, bathed, ate, watched TV. Bao Mei Li's segment is so funny! HAHA! I even got a nighmare on Sunday that she was cancelled in Comedy Nite! HaHa!   Sigh...I was very very vexed leh... I think more and more of working you know. On Sunday in Causeway Point, I was kinda shopping for work shoes. I became scared that I'll feel sad if my appeal is successful (ayiah...my family also needs the money. My broadband is 3 months overdue...). Yeah. The more I plan, the more excited I become about work....and the less happy I'll become with school. Wendy kinda correctly predicted that I lost all interest in schooling le. HaHa. I also don't want to go to orientation tomorrow. I, again, was not really accepted in my group, even though I didn't do anything. One guy said "I don't want to stand near Kelvin"....... Sigh... I lost all mood in Orientation because of this lor. Sigh... I am very vexed la!   I think I gotta go le lor...so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Saturday!  Today leh, I did nothing other than watching TV and aimlessly surfing the Net (and chat too). HaHa...Pretty boring yah. Sigh...I wanted to play The Sims de...but somehow, I didn't. Ergh....  Today sure was bad luck. I have severe diarrhea! Hurts so much! For the past 7 hours, I went to the toilet 6 times! That's roughly about once per hour. It's so like annoying.... and hurtful. The pain around the stomach. The number of times I have to rush to the toilet. Why, I could even make the toilet my permanent home. Ergh! What could have ignited this terrible fire? I think it's the fried carrot cake I ate this morning for breakfast.... How idiotic!  Today, the poor YJCians have to go for Orientation till 9pm. Poor things! They have to suffer so many hours of ultimate boredom. I pity them! (However, I do not pity a particular Ah Ji-insulting duck there. Serve you right, left and center!) I must find out what they did. HaHa!  I am now playing one the CDs I burnt at Wendy's house. HaHa. At Saturdays from 8-10, there's this program on Perfect 10, Club Beats. I don't like it, as they mainly play club music, and I don't like club music. Therefore, I played my CDs lor. It's now playing Bon Jovi's It's My Life. HaHa!  I think I end le la.... See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya. Sorry for not blogging yesterday. I accidentally deleted the post, and is too pissed off to write. Yeah. So I am writing from Wed night onwards.   WEDNESDAY   HaHa. I listened the Top 100 Countdown straight. You see, there's this contest la. Send in your prediction for the top song, and you may win cash and CDs. I sent in 3 predictions: Dido's White Flag, Black Eyed Peas's Where Is The Love and Clay aiken's Invisible. HaHa. When it was counting down from number 5 onwards, the moment is so exciting and tense! Me, Mel, XC and HM were furiously discussing the songs. HaHa. Soon, number 1 and none of my predictions appeared yet. So nervous! HaHa....then, suddenly, Where's The Love got number 1! YAY!! I have a chance! Now, I started getting real nervous. HaHa. They anniounced the winner. It was a guy. Oh my god....hope! They announced the IC number. S--8(oh god!!)--7(oh my god!!  heart was really thumping!)--4..... WHAT?!!! Oh my god! I nearly won!! I nearly won!! HaHa....I still haven't got over the shock of nearly winning.  After that, I watched Charmed (Necromancing The Stone. Nice episode! I love the wiccanning at the end!). Then, I went out to play with my neighboutrs, counting down till 1st January 2004. HaHa. We played cards and firecrackers. We long timed never played le. I miss the good old days. Yeah. We are playing again this coming CNY's Eve. Wee!   THURSDAY   Okay, I came back and looked at the chat transcript. Boy,I was so damn pissed off at Benjamin. Firstly, he called CQ *toot*. Then,. he expressed his displeasure at me not coming back on time (apparently, they needed me to discuss soemthing) by saying things about me and used an ugly emoticon to depict me. I wasn't really that angry with him for that, but the fact is that he insulted CQ right before he insulted me made me real pissed off. No one, I repeat no one, insults/hurts CQ. I simply won't take it lying down. That fucker. I sent a really spiteful email to that scumbag (actually, not really that spiteful. I was very tired le. It was kinda mild lor...). He actually dared to deny these! Excuse me, even XC also saw lor. That r-a-t. Stinko rat. Nobody insults me and CQ and gets away with it. I made sure they don't. He thinks he's so clever and noble. Phooey! If he's that clever, he wouldn't have lost to me for 2 years. Scoring low pathetic marks. He dissed me for going to sub science too....hao lian. Think you go into Pure Science so good issit? (The teachers who let you go Pure Science is either stupid or pity you so much or like you (ha! pai ma pi jing!)) Even XC is more humble. He did not suan Sub Science and think he's so much better than us. Ha! Loser!  Okay. I went to sleep and woke up about 6 hours later. HaHa. The morning was not so bad la...it's my last morning as a free person, so gotta enjoy it much. I watched yesterday's Ben Yue. HaHa. I even have it taped, because I wanna listen to the countdown.  In the afternoon, I watched the VCD How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.  The VCD had some cracks...so hyad to fast forward some scenes. HaHa. Overall, it's a good movie. Nice plot and all....HeHe. :D "Bullshit!"  At night, I came online lor.HaHa. Had this argument with Ben, and I didn't blog. Yeah....moo meow! I downloaded Dido's White Flag into my handphone. Ha.   THURSDAY   I woke up at 5.30. Woah! So bu xi guan....after many days of waking up late. HaHa. Hmm....took my father's cab to CCK MRT to meet my friends. Me, CQ, Hann, PeiYing,  Tina, LeYu, Kelvin, Johan and WeeKiat met there to go PJ together. We took a crowded 190 bus there.  Woah...there are so many students going to PJ. We Riverisidians were like such a small group. O.o!!! We were all in different Orientation groups. I am in Group 3....Woo!   We had to register ourselves and get the Subject Combi form. I was like quite annoyed. There were two particulars wrong. My religion is not Taoism. I want to strike it out and put "Wicca", but nahh....after all, you can incorporate Taosim into Wicca..... The next one is the most qi shu lin part! Due to me failing A-Maths, I have only two subjects combinations offered: Maths C, Chem/Phy and Econs. Stupid!! I detest Econs lor...I am appealing for Bio. I can't see why I can't take Bio lor. Stupid school.  Woah lao. The two hours of talk is so toturous, and boring! My legs were all numb, especially the right leg. It lost all feelings at the end of the two-hour talk...I can't barely even stand straight... how toturous. I only listened at the appeal part....that's the only thing that interest me and that I care about.  Groups 1-15 go down to break after the talk. Me, Hann and CQ were in these groups, so we met up la. Hann is also in the same predicatament as me. We decided that if our appeal turns out unsuccessful, we would rather quit school. I mean, we hate Econs and see no point in studying if we cna't get to study Bio. I decided to find a job, either at Metro, Shop and Save or Popular. HaHa. So fun! I was kinda secretly hoping to lose the appeal la....working seems so fun...but choy!  I wanna study also! Ha!  After that, it's ice breaker games. I found out that Ming Yao is in the same group as me! I totally can't recongize him lor. HeHe. He's so much more taller and slimer now. HaHa! Finally! I have somebody to talk to! HaHa!! We played ice breaker games, including the wacko. HaHa. They everytime call me one. Maybe Kelvin the name is too easy to remember ba! HaHa! We played games till12 lor...  After dismissal, I went to get an appeal form and appealed lor. I wrote a lot la. I forgot to write that I only lack 6 points to pass A-maths. However, I did suan Econs very badly lor ("I am sure PJC would prefer a student scoring well in Bio than a student scoring badly in Econs" and "I hate Econs from the get-go. I have totally no interest in it")  I expressed my great interest in Bio ("Bio is my life. It will be. It is so." corny, I know. But I am desperate!). HaHa!   We all go back lor. CQ went back. Hann and PY went to Sembawang, go back to school. I went to Causeway Point to look for Wendy. HaHa. Find her to talk la. I found her after few minutes of searching.   We went to eat lunch together. She eat something noodles, and I ate kuay chap. HaHa. We caught uip with each other lor. We can talk face to face...after all, these day we are talking through MSN chat. Not very personal. HaHa. We talk and talk and talk and continue talking while she work. HaHa. We made several trips up to the third floor linen department to get some stocks. (The escalator in Metro leading from the first floor to the second floor has a strong fried chicken smell. Wendy said it always has been there. Creepy wor! I think hor, the smell is there because a guy eating chicken slipped from the escalator and fell to his death...hahaha!! silly theory!).   I went home at 4+, because Wendy had to take stocks from the storeroom and be very busy.HaHa. Had a good time chatting with her. :)  Hmm...went home le, bathed and came online. Oh yes, Mrs Chew is not my brother's chem teacher. Damn!! I even slept for awhile. So sleepy. *Yawn*  Hmm...that's all lor.I think I end le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya meow moo!   Hmmm. Today morning was a bit rushed, because we have to go out by 11 to visit grandmother. Meow moo. We ate breakfast very fast, I even have to run here to time-record HZGG. How busy!!  At 11, Father came back and we went there lor. My parents want to bring my brother there to see her, in case there are no other chances. Meow moo. Woah! The carpark spaces during Sunday is abundant. Such a shocker. I thought on Sunday everybody is resting and would come to visit their relatives. When we went up, there were a lot of cats registering. Looks like they came by public transport instead. Heh. I was delgeted by some nurse to register for my whole family. O.O Meow meow. I noticed that their temperature sticker change color. I've got green, purple and white. I wonder what else do they have.  Anyway, we saw MaMa. Bak Liong and Yee Pak Pak were there too. MaMa refused to eat again...she is refusing to eat these few days. I think she is trying to avoid the amputation. She rejected to it in the first place ma, who would want to lose a leg? She's protesting, not eating, so the operation wouldn't go on. Either that, or she's tired of living (I know, harsh. That's the most diplomatic I can go...). That's what I analyzed anyway. Hmmm. Do you know that 5551 came out 3rd in 4D yesterday? MaMa's ward is 5A (51), in the 5th floor and is resting on bed 5. Some relatives brought and struck. Numbers associating from people's misfortune always strike. Meow!! Hmmmm. I found out that Yee Pak Pak knows a lot about the other patients and their visitors around MaMa. HaHa. MaMa only drank Milo lor. I found out (from a bit of peeking at files) that MaMa was fed glucerina as medicine. Sigh...she's not eating. How can that be good for her? Sigh.   We left at 1 and went towards AMK Ave 5. The big market-cum-hawker center is open! YAY!! I wanna see got my favorite black chicken rice and gu meen (mushroom soup, dong gu mian). Black chicken rice didn't open, but gu meen did! Gu meen is spendidly delicious (even though it was a tad too peppery). Meow mooo! The delicious dong gu is to die for! After that, we went to AMK Central to get my brothers some shoes.   I went home to bath and meow online, while the rest of the family went to buy new sporting equipment for my brother. They brought back chicken for dinner. After some meowing surfing, I ate my dinner and came back online lor.   Hmm. I think I go le la. I want to play FFX. Heh Heh. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya meow! Today's a meowing meow day.  Okay. Where do I start? Okie. I woek up at 8.30 and bathed, surpirsingly for 30 minutes, then came online. Hmmm..Mother came back with chee cheong fun, we ate, I watched TV and at 11, I went offline to prepare to go meet the cats to play basketball.   Hmm. There were me, HL, Gloria, CQ, WQ, PY, Joyce, HM, ThongZhen, Eugene and Jason. Meow moo meow. We waited around for XC, KS, CK and Janet to come lor. Okay, we didn't actually wait. We played first. Meow moo. They came later lor. We played and played. I was like kinda not very sporty, I ain't used to playing with TZ they all ma. Heh. We played till about 2+pm. I was terribly hungry. We walked towards Causeway Point to eat, and I could faint from the hunger.   The place was full. KFC, LJS....so idiotic! I want to eat something! They all want XC to pay, but XC is very unwilling lor, why force him. Want to go where, Seoul Garden ar. Stupid. We (Me, Ji, Gloria and HL) found ourself space in McDonalds...they say want to go Seoul Garden. I burst out lor. I am terribly hungry. All 4 of us want to stay at Mc, they say go Seoul Garden. We don't have the moolah! I shouted at CK lor...I am very extremely hungry. I just wanna eat. Can I even eat in peace? We then brought something to eat, the rest found spaces. Meow.   After that, the peeps went pooling. I initially didn't want to play, because I have no money. XC said he's treating, so why not. Yeah. HaHa. I feel like I am "qiao zha"ing him, but he was the one who suggested it first and he even asked me to play. So, ayiah, play lor. HaHa. I am in the same team as CQ, Janet and Joyce the "Jinx". We won all, but one, rounds. HAHA! Even ducks are jinxful. At 6, we went home lor.   Hmm. I ate chicken rice for dinner. Hmm.. I didn't do much of MNI essays homework this time, owing to the going outs and the release of O Levels results.  Yeah. I only managed to do Potions, and I am attempting DADA later. I think only these two la. Heh. I am a meowing cat.  Okie. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

ALL MY HAPPINESS IS GONE!  Anyway. Lets skip the morning and the whole hell of waiting crap and get onto the real results. I feel like crying. ALL MY TEXT! Fuck la. If I ever feel like it again, I'll come back and rewrite. I wanted to scold my friend real bad, but ergh. Don't want to do it. Besides, she got really poor grades. Don't wanna upset her.   Well, it was time for the people with 5As to be announced, No suprise here, I was on that list. Anyway, I was like dreaming, hoping for it yesterday night and today morning, but I always told myself I am a bit silly. Well, it looks like I am not silly aqnymore (ths line is supposed to be funny when I first typed this, but the effects this time is NOT right! I WANT TO CRY!). I was like very freaked out! Then, I found out that Ah Ji and Hann are also on that list! YAY! We were asked to stand up to let people appluad us. Oh meow.   Anyhoo, we were asked to go out for a photo shoot. What a meowingly meow meow photo shoot. How fun! YaY! I heard that people getting 5As and above are gonna come back during Speech Day to get a prize or something. Oh meow! My first Speech Day. Good what! Anyway, I received my results (with so many fucking kaypohs non-4/5 people crowding around...so irritating!). I got a major surprise. I passed A-Maths with B3! Woah! I was like praying for C6, and I got a B3 instead. Unbelievable (of course not. It already happened)! I will be posting my results below so you cats can take a look.  Okay. We decided to go out to celebrate. Go Pizza Hut and eat la. I don't want to talk about the milling about and deliberation....just that we arrived at Causeway Point at 5+. We ate until we were very full. Very. The rest went pooling. Me, WQ and XC didn't.     I took bus 911 to 883 to meet my mother. Meow moo meow! I walked back, took a bath, came online. Sigh. I am so sorry I sounded ultra-bitchy, but that's what I am feeling right now. I am feeling happy for my reesults la, but over this blog entry, nah. Stupid site music made this! IDIOT!  I gotta go.

      Hey hey! Moo meow moo!  Meow meow meow! Today is a real happening day. Yep Yep. Hmm..I went with Mother to 883, because she needs my help in carrying things (ie, tissue boxes). Hmm. I ate roti prata, Mother ate Mee Soto. Anyhoo, at Shop N Save, a Cold Storage supervisor came to inspect the cashier. She chose to inspect Lao Yao Guai's register, check the account and everything. HaHa. Anyhoo, we brought things.   We came back at 10.30, I went online for a while. Dad called and we went down to go to the hospital. We are going early because of parking space. Even so, it was 11.35 when we reached there and it was kind hard to find a parking space.   Hmm. After going through the registration and stuff, we met MaMa's (no, it doens't mean Mother. It means Grandma. My way of calling her) friends in the lobby. Dai Gu Ma and Yee Pak Pak joined us later. Hmm..We sat around till 12, when we went in to look at MaMa.   Hmm. She's looking pretty frail. She hasn't had her operation yet. The doctor's checking her blood, see whether it will be suitable or not. Her blood pressure is mild lor. Anyway, she refused to eat her lunch. I can see why. It smells horrible! The greens are mashed till very watery, the rice is very runny...very horrible smell. Anyway, she drank some Milo lor. It's kinda depressing, really.   Anyhoo, we and DGM are going to the Loyang first. They want to go there to pray for some 4D number. Yeah. We went to eat lunch first. DGM ate already, so all of us ate kueh chap. They were discussing about MaMa, her health, Dai Pak Pak and his stupidity (for calling DGM unfilial...long story, don't wanna say). Aynhoo, we went to the temple lor. We prayed for good luck, Mother brought some good-luick amulet, which I am not brining with me.   After that, Father drove me to the beach, which is very near Loyang. I found them. Okie. They were playing cards/games, then, they decided to rent bikes. The shop-owner very lame leh. Tell us lotsa lame jokes and riddles before letting us rent bikes. We rode around and around. We rested a bit. We went to play at the playground (had so much fun! :D), and even sat down to watch the sea. After that, I went alone to ride bike (and catch up with WQ, KS and Gloria, which I never did). It was a very cool expeience.Just riding and riding. I circled Pasir Ris Park twice. Heh Heh. I thought a lot of crazy thoughts....and I let myself go wild with the wind. Shuang! After giving back the bikes, we milled around, taking photos and playing games till 6+.  We then went to eat at White Sands' McDonalds. HaHa. XC copied nearly all of my contacts into his phone. Meow moo meow! I ate Chicken McNuggets Meal, XC too. I ordered for him ma. :P After that, we started on our journey home. XC and KS alighted at Yishun to find Hann, who is letting KS and XC stay over. Me, Gloria and KK walked home together.  Okay. Sorry if it all sounded very short and simplified. Tomorrow's the release of Os results. I am very very nervous (I am somewhat more calmed down then when I've started). What if I do badly? I don't even want to think. I just know that I am very very nervous. Very jing zhang. God. I can't wait for tomorrow, so I can meet my friends. Being with them makes me more calm and serene. When I'm alone, I tend to hu shi ruan xiang. Think wild thoughts. Stupid. I shouldn't think more. AHHHHHH!  Okay...calm down. I think I go liao la...see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Meowing moo cats!  Hmm. Today morning I changed my routine. I went to the market with Mother today, so I woke up at 8. HaHa. I went there to eat mian fen guo, while Mother ate nasi something, forgot le la. Heh. After that, we brought 8 Days and I was reading while Mother went to Shop N Save.   HaHaHa! That mother go and chat with Yvonne Phua, and made Yvonne key in 61 quantity of some veggie. HAHAHA! The customer looked so shocked when $60+ came up in the register and Yvonne said "You la! Come and talk to me! I must go find Pek Chu!" and laughed. We laughed too. HAHA! Hmm...Mother walked around to check price while I was walking around and reading. At the end, Lao Ma Zi tried to make Mother buy coffee for her. HaHa. My mother refused. Meow meow meow! We returned home at 10.  Hmm. I went online, chatted with Professor Snapeluva, and went on MNI. I am getting so pek chek at the slow loading times. I found out that it was due to IE's functions. I am now thinking of upgrading to Mozilla Firefox. WQ said I should (Oh my my! Savage Garden's Truly Madly Deeply is playing on the radio?! I love the song!!). Hmm. Maybe I'll do it. See first. After chatting and fustrated refreshing, I went to play FFX.  Hmm. I played FFX until 3, when I went down to play bball with my friends,. I met Janet first and we saw KentKent at the court. Gloria and HL came soon after, followed by Chin Quan. Hmm...we played and played. We took a short break, I went up to fill CQ's water bottle and I took my water bottle down. Hmm...when I came down, some ducks occupied our court. So we let them play for awhile. We sat down and chatted. Janet's brother joined us and when the court's clear, we played lor. Play play play till 5.50+, when I have a huge stomachache and had to rush back home.  Meow meow. After clearing my bowels, I bathed and had to eat dinner. Meow moo meow! After that, I came online.  How meowful. Tomorrow we are going to visit my paternal grandmother, who had her leg amputated. It seems like it died or something. Yeah. After that, I am going to Pasir Ris beach to play with my friends. I think i will fully update you tomorrow, if I have the chance to come online, that is.   Well, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow.

      Meow meow moo! Tuesday's a meowing day.  Okie. Today morning was boring, boring and BORING. Totally boring. I ate duck porridge for breakfast. Okay. I was so totally bored that I was meowing for attention. Apparently, when WQ came online, I was so estatic! Finally! A cat to talk to! My happiness fell short when he announced that he's gonna play games. Meow moo!! Luckily, at that time, Charms class started, and I kept myself busy. HaHa. I even got Prof Snapeluva's MSN add. Too bad she's working, we can't chat much.  Hmmm. At 2, I went on to play my FFX. Oh, it was kinda good. I managed to get LuLu learn the second level elemental magics (Fira, Thundara, etc) and oh boy! They consumed so much MPs. I need to use Fira to deal with the Orchu and my Mps have depleted a lot!! Luckily, I made it to the Save Sphere in time. How meowful. I need to level up more! How meowful!  Yes Yes. After playing, I came online, bathed, ate dinner and meow back online. I found out that Sundays (I did not sleep on Saturday...so Saturday does not apply) generally means success, which means that my dreams usually means success in my actions. How revealing! Yes!! Meowful too.  You know what? WQ called me "bo liao" for believing in dreams. He also told me to stop being so kaypoh. I felt so affronted! I felt so insulted! I believe that dreams reveal a lot about the person, and also a small premonition to the future. What would you have felt if I called your belief "rubbish"? Me being kaypoh is part of being KY. I CANNOT not be kaypoh! If you ask me not to be kaypoh, you are telling me "Don't be yourself. Be someone else instead". Yes! That's how serious it is! I hope WQ consider what is he gonna tell people in the future, because his words might unintenionally hurt people's feeling (and make them angry too). Meow!!  Alright. I am going off to watch my sitcoms. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow!  Okay. What should I start off with today? "I was almost woken up by my mother cleaning the floor, but I slept on and didn't wake up in the end?". Nah. I shall start with "Today is a meowing day." Better. I woke up at 8.30, bathed, came online, ate breakfast and went online some more. HaHa. I figured that I didn't do badly after all. My miscalculations. I got Os for Transfiguration, Potions (even named the ever first Student Of The Week! YAY!), History of Magic and one unknown subject (which I suspect is Divination). YaY!!   After that, I watched my recorded shows in Sat, namely Pokemon and 8 Simple Rules. Meow moo! The ending of 8 Simple Rules is so terribly funny! HAHAHAHAHA! Meow moo. Er hm.. I don't think most of you know what I am talking about, so meow.  Okie. I went on to play my FFX (and eat lunch). Woah! I have such a hard time on the route towards the beach. I got killed by the freaking sleep-inducing, fire breathing idiotic plant-like monster 4 times! 4 TIMES!!! I got so pek chek with walking all over again that I decided to use Tidus's Flee ability to flee every battle with that idiot plant. Well, I had a big boss battle with Sinspawn Gui. At first, I only wanted to test the waters, but as I fight and pummelled that idiotic monster, the more I wanted to stay on. Stayed on I did, and slained the monster I did, with little HP to go. Heh. How meowful! I felt very tired in the end. O.o!  After that, I went online till 6+, when I went to bath, ate dinner and came back online.    Hmmm. Ayiah. What I want to say again? I forgot le la...so much distractions! I think I end liao le. Oh yes oh yes! I always dream of very good dreams during Saturday night-Sunday morning. Very very good, and powerful too. Yes Yes. I must find out the influence of Saturdays have on cats dreaming. Meow moo meow!  Okay. See ya tonmorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow!! Today's Sunday!  Okay. Morning is meowing, meaning it's the same old same old. I ate laksa for breakfast. How meowful. I had a really nice dream yesterday. How mooful is that? Very! Quack Quack Quack.  After HZGG and lunch, I had plans to play my FFX. However, I was quite held up donwloading songs and replying to forums, so meow for me. HaHa. I finally got Sugababes' Too Lost In You from Kent Kent! After so many meows at downloading, I finally got it! Thanks Kent Kent. She gave me other mp3s too, all of them very nice! :)          Around 3, I switched off my computer to go play my FFX. Alas, my mother was busy with the taxes, so I laid on my mother's bed. Yeah. You should know the story. I fell asleep! Heh Heh. I slept and slept till 5, when I almost rolled down the bed. That meowing brother didn't wake me up!   Hmm..I watched a bit of Unbeatables, then reluctantly (and tiredly) went down to buy dinner. As usual, my brother ate the yu pian tang and I ate fried rice. Even ducks meow! After eating, watching TV and bathing, I came online.   MNI is kinda crazy today. When it can go fast, the pages load quick. When it goes slow (it does on a whim), it can go REALLY slow. Geez. Anyway, on the Mature Discussion (Politics/Philosophy) forum, there's a certain immature idiot running around. She's a young girl, a Christian Republican. I have never seen such a stupid, narrow-minded person such as herself. First of all, she, like over-zealous Xians, think that Christianity is the best religion all around, and bash people for not being Christian (she said to a wiccan: "you better rethink your life, your afterlife isn't gonna be pretty", which means the wiccan will rot in hell. Being a Wiccan, I was personally offended. I did not butt in, because that's not my place to). Secondly, she is the sterotypical Republican. She agrees with Bush, whatever he said, simply because she agrees with him. She sticks to the Bible, for which she believes that is the true word of God. Honestly! She reminds me of Bush, that fat idiot. Whenever someone agrees with her, she goes all happy. When someone disagrees and puts a well-said argument, she will whine about being attacked. Everyone has been telling her that, but she still goes on attacking all the same. Sigh. I wanted to contribute my two cents, but I'm afraid it would come out heated, and have galleosn docked off me. So nah. Let Cindel deal with her.  Oh well. I think I end this blog le. Meow meow meow, meow meow. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Meow moo meow.  Okay. Today we went out celebrating Gloria's birthday (well, it is tomorrow, but we celebrate early all the same). Meow moo.   Okay. We met at 11 (of course me, HL and Gloria met earlier) with KS, WQ, CQ and PY. Hmm. At Woodlands hor, they said they wanted to go K Box to sing songs. We were like already decided to go Pasir Ris Beach, but they all sian too troublesome. Made me do all those work for nothing. Meow!  We have to wait for Joyce, so we went to play Pool. HaHa. WQ didn't play. We met SL there and she's joining us for K-Box later. We played some pool where my team won some. Hmm. Janet came by, and we stood around chatting. Joyce came, and we chatted some more lor.  It was like until 1 when we decided to move on. HaHa. We went to CCK's Lot 1. We decided to go eat lunch first. HaHa. I am buying Gloria's share, because she said she'll follow what I eat. We ate chicken rice, where I drank the big bowl of soup (she said she don't drink soup). I also owed CQ $2.50. HaHa.  After lunch, we went into K-Box to sing lor. Sing until 7pm ar. Janet and KentKent got join us for awhile. SL and the two of them left first lor. Hmm. There weren't much (okay, that's an understatement. It is very little) EL songs. There weren't ANY current ones...sigh! I have to sing the Chinese songs I know (most of them oldies, and the new ones are the SHE songs I often listened with CQ). I had fun singing them. My first song sang was Lian Ren Wei Man by SHE. I like that song a lot a lot. Hmm. WQ did not sing at all, even though he picked songs. Meow!! So shy for what? My singing sucks, but I still sang (although reluctantly at first, but I grew used to the mic). Meow moo meow. We went out at 7.  Oh my meowing god. The basic charge is $16, whcih I paid la. There's this +++, which means extra $5.80 lor. We were like kinda worried at first, because we thought we haven't have enough. Luckily, some of us brought a lot of moolah, so can pay first. Woah!! HaHa. Later, we went to Macs to slowly calculate. I have to pay CQ back. In the end, I owed him $6 (I paid him back some moolah). We aklso ate some ice-cream and then went back la.  I went to Metro to talk to Wendy. WQ accompany me, because he's meeting his parents there too. HaHa. As usual, me and Wendy talked la. Chatted and chatted. Her colleague, Ayu, knows me le. I come a lot of times when she's here ma. Heh Heh. I even "helped" her do her homework, which is somesort like a test on Wendy's saleperson's skills. Meow moo. I went home at 9 something.  Hmm, went home, bathed and went online. Oh my god...I did badly at one of my essays, I think it is DADA. Shit. I am so worried. My Straight Os record is tarnished!! Oh meow.  Oh yes, before I go: I feel so stupid! I am so stupid. I know....I shouldn't say that, but I feel so. Sigh... I think too much la. Hmph.  Okay. I managed to beat the time, by ending before 12am. Okay. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Meow moo meow!  Meow moo meow! Hmmm. Today morning was nothing really special. I ate duck porridge for breakfast. HaHa. I came online for a while, then went to help my mother mop the floor. I realized that the kitchen floor gets so dirty easily. just now, Father asked if I mopped the floor. I went to look at the kitchen floor. OH MY GOD! There were dark patches here and there!!! I mopped of ALL dark patches! It is like not mopping like that leh. Ergh!  Anyway, I finished at 12, so I went to play FFX while eating my lunch. I only played a short segment, where Tidus, LuLu and Kimahri rescued Yuna from the Al Bheds. That took me about 40 minutes. I was running very late! HaHaHa.  At 1, when I was supposed to meet them, I wasn't even on the bus! They suddenly called and told me that they are meeting me on the MRT. Well, I finally did meet them, SL, Joyce and WQ. We took the train towards Boon Lay, going to Jurong Point.  HaHa. You can say that we spent a lot of time in there before buying Gloria's prezzie. HaHa. We walked and walked and look at a lot of cute stuff. We finally decided on our prezzie. Me, Joyce and SL paid for it. HeHe. I cannot reveal, because Gloria might be reading. After prezzie buying, we went to eat at KFC, walk around and went home.  HaHa. After bathing, I played FFX. I lost in my first BlitzBall tournament. HaHa. My brother says I am stupid. Well, I let him win for me lor. See if he can or not. I am also detecting a close relationship between Wakka and LuLu. O.o!!   Hmmm..after that I ate dinner and came online. I was greeted by a disturbing sign. WQ ar.... don't let these comments get to you, okay? I did not regret my decision in any bit. It was worth every single tries I went through. You are worth that. Don't let these comments affect you at all. Okay?   I end this le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo moo! Hey Hey!  Morning was almost identical to yesterday. However, I was more stressed. Heh Heh. Majority of the classes have homework today! HaHa. Actually, yesterday, I completed my Transfgiuration homework. Today leh, I done Divination, Potions and History of Magic (which I have to trim to 3 paras...my wonderful essay!). Tomorrow I am doing COMC (which is to write a story. Coolies!) and DADA (which I am considering doing if I have time later).      Meow moo! WQ came online too. In the afternoon, I played my FFX. O.O! How meowful! Even ducks meow! Such a fun game! I stopped at the part when I am finding Auron.  After that, I went online. Then, I bathed at 6+, ate dinner and came online. Hmm. Later, the Group 2 results will reveal. This group is very sucky compared to the other group. Very lacking in star quality. Oh well.    I think I end le. Do my DADA homework. See ya tomorrow.

      Hey! Meow moo meow!  Okay. Hmm. Today morning was meowful, that is to say, boring. I got up, bathed and went down to buy 8 Days (must read every Wed). I went online (and read) while waiting for Mother to come back. She returned at 10 with chee cheong fun. After eating, it was more online surfing. Meow moo!  Okay. At 11 something, I switched off my Internet connection and went to play my PS2 games brought yesterday. I know. A shocker. Kelvin stopped online surfing for the afternoon? Meow! Heh.   Anyway, I played Sonic Heroes first. Well, it was a very very difficult game. Seriously.Haiz. After an hour of non-stop dying, I don't wanna play anymore. I hope WQ has better luck with it. Heh.   At 1, I started playing my FFX. Woah! Woah! I love the game! It's so addictive! The storyline's great so far! There are much more FMVs then before, which is good. I noticed the bosses have gone harder, but oh well. The new Sphere Gird system is cool, but I haven't start customizing yet. Meow moo moo! The characters are so great! Wakka and Tidus are cute and nice. Rikku and Yuna are cute too, not to mention beautiful. Auron and LuLu are cool. Right now, my favorite character so far is LuLu. She's looks very very cool, got a beautiful face and her personality is so damn mature. Of course, my favorites in RPGs being mages contribute to LuLu being my favorite. I even changed my desktop picture from ViVi to LuLu. Heh heh! :)  Hmm. After that was not much. I went online at 5, then went to bath and ate dinner at 6 (went out to eat fried rice). When I came back, I went online. HaHa. I was kinda distracted, because I was reading debates in the MNI forums. Just now, my computer even froze on me, but luckily, I only written two paras, so it didn't really matter when I rewrote this blog.   Meow moo! I think I end here le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Meow moo moo!!  Okay. Today's been a real busy day. Busy with a captial B. Yeah. Meow moo meow!   I woke up at 7, because we are going out to eat breakfast! Heh Heh. Yeah, my father picked us up at 8. Meowing moo.   We went to AMK to eat. I want to go back to AMK Ave 5's to eat, but it is STILL under rennovation. Sheesh. We then went to Central to eat lor. I ate the meatballs with century eggs porridge. It was a bit bland, but oh meow. My mother ate the cuttlefish porridge and Father the dried fishball noodles. Yeah.  Today, my Mother wanted to cook curry fish-head. However, all the markets doesn't seem to be carrying fish heads!! We tried the NTUC nearby, but it was to no avail. We were about to go back home. However, Mother tried one last attempt to buy fish heads. She suggested Takka Market at Little India. Why not? We set forth on our journey there.  I was so bored that I started SMSing WQ using my Mother's handphone. Sigh. When I asked what he was doing, he didn't reply. Then I lammented about his slow reply. After he still didn't reply, I SMSed him telling him that I didn't dare to call him in case I annoyed him further (and I probably did la). After a while, he smsed back with something like "Charging! Silent mode!" Oppsie. Sigh. I think I am very very possessive. When people don't reply me, I get very very paranoid and possessive. I think I am annoying. Heh.  Well, Takka Market was Block 665 (Incidentally, Wendy's block is the same number). We finally found a stall with fish heads. HaH. My mother as usual tried to bargain, but the stall owner was very put-off. He said "I don't have time to bargain with you! My fish is very fresh!" HAHAHA! So funnily stupid. My mother rolled her eyes (heh! so funny to see her do that!). After that, we also brought crabs. Meow moo! Anyway, on the way home, I was checking on the crabs to see if they are alive. I touched one on the underside, and my thumb has a speck of shit on it! AHHHHH!!! Stupid idiotic crabs! Meow moo meow!! I have to air the cab too. The fishy smell is terribly stinky.   We went back home. Hmm. WQ came online! Meow moo. He then asked me to go out to AMK Central with him to buy some PS2 toy. Hmm. Okay with me. I had to go eat my lunch first. Lunch was chicken rice at Admiralty Place. How meowful.  I met WQ at 1 something. I brought along 10 bucks. It was to be used for buying games. Hmm. WQ announced that he's going to Funan the IT Mall instead. Okay. Anyway, my parents were able to get FFX and FFX-2, so I can use my $10 to buy books. Anyway, we chatted a lot on the train. Remincised a lot too. Heh.   He went to buy the Eye Toy at Funan. It was this motion sensor thing that lets you play the games intoa totally new perspective. Thing something along the lines of Para Para. Yeah. I brought a Sabrina Special Edition,"Ten Little Witches" at a bookstore! Meow meow! After that, we decided to take 960 bus home. We walked all the way to the Esplanade. HaHa. We even went to the library@Esplanade. It was kinda cosy, but really nothing for me. As I said, we took the bus back.  On the bus, I read my blog. What a fantastic book! I love mystery thrillers! The ending is surprising too! WQ and I alighted at the stop after Marsiling MRT. He wants to go home, so I accompany him to his block and later take 911 back. I sent him off, and I walked towards Causeway Point. I didn't want to take bus after all.   I got a feeling to go find Wendy, so I went to find her lor. She was having her dinner break, but she accompanied me lor. We walked round and round Causeway Point, chatting. I even treated her a drink. Heh. It was great talking to her. It always is. I finally told her my dream I had on Sat (which I wanted to on Sunday, but she went offline while I was watching Moulin Rouge). Heh Heh. She told me lotsa things too. Meow moo. I went home at around 5.40, when her break ends.   Hmm. After bathing, I played a little FFX. Wee! It was kinda fun. The Battle System was kinda confusing at first because it was different from FF9's, but i adapted to it la. I am now at the first save point. Anyway, I ate my dinner, read my book and watched TV. Oh yes, I had a bit of chilli crab just now. Meow meow meow.  Oh well. WQ got his PS2. I don't think he will be online that often. I always hate it when he got games to play. He is always never online de. So hard to talk to him. ~pouts~  Okay. I end this blog le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey. Well. What did ya know. I decided to blog early again. Why? I don't know. Just wanna blog I guess.  Hmm. This morning, I woke up real early. We are going to the Yishun doctor (I am not seeing him. My mother is. I am only accompnaying). Father's fetching us at 8, so I gotta bath quick. I bathed and came online for awhile. Heh.   Yeah. Dad called at 8. I brought mah book, Witch Week, along to read. Yeah. We ate kueh chap for breakfast, then we went to the doctor lor. I sat in the car (air-conditioned. And yes, I did open the windows. I am not gonna CO myself to death) to read while waiting for Mother to be done with the doctor. Meow moo. Mother brought Mentos, so I was reading and eating and listening to the radio.   After the visit to the doctors, I went back while parents went to Sheng Shiong. There, I spent my time snapping up questions for DADA. Heh Heh. Wendy called and asked if she can come over. I was like "sure". However, soon after, Mother called and told me that Grandmother is in the Tan Tock Seng hospital and we have to go see her after they come back from Sheng Shiong. I tried to call Wendy, but she can't listen. I only managed to call her when she's in the lift up... So paiseh. Sorry leh Wendy (I know you said "it's okay" lotsa times, but yeah...).  Hmm. Finding a parking spot during visiting hour is a trouble, especially at the beginning of the visiting hours. Nobody's gonna come down to drive out. After several rounds of driving round and round, we found a spot. Meow! When we entered the lift lobby, our temperatures were taken and we were given a green sticker. Then, we have to go up to Level 1 to register ourselves (we have to bring our ICs).   After all that trouble, we went up to Level 5, Ward 5A. In the lobby were Dai Gu Ma, another auntie (forgot name le) and Felicia. Felicia came to visit Grandmother during her lunch break (she is working in the UOB bank, which is very near TTSH). It looks like Grandmum got diabetes and is unable to walk. Anyway, she was out having an x-ray done, so we were like waiting for ages. They talked about a lot of things, like how Grandmother don't want her house cleanse. She said to have seen a shadow of a female ghost. Everybody's asking her to clean the room, but she is having none of it. Oh well. Cleaning a room is very easy, by the way.   It was 1 and she's still not back yet. Felicia has to go back to work (lunch break's over. Poor thing. I don't think she has lunch yet), but she said she will be coming at night. Well, the nursing staff said we could visit her past visitng hours (because we were waiting for an hour for nothing). A short while later, she came back, but we aren't allowed to see her yet. The nurses are cleaning her, and I think, diluting her blood. Her blood became so thick that it won't run smoothly. It stretched for about 45 minutes. We had to go back (Mother's gotta work), so we went in to have a look at her lor. She was quite pale. Sigh. I hope she gets well soon.  Hmm. We went to AMK Central to have lunch, then came back lor. Father didn't want to work anymore, so he's cleaning the floor (we clean the floor every Mon and Fri). I wanna clean the kitchen later. Heh. Now I blog.   Hmm. When I was out, I was busy smsing Amanda, Wendy and WQ. Me and Amanda were chatting perfectly la. Somehow, WQ and Wendy stopped replying to my sms and din't even take my calls. I was like "oh shit". What if they ignored me because I sent too many SMSes and pissed them off? If they do that, I will be terribly lonely. I am just plain crazy today, so paranoid! It turns out that WQ didn't hear my calls and SMSes. Okay, phew. I think Wendy just wants to be alone (or is talking to another cat), so yeah. I stopped calling le lor. Meow moo.   Okay. I've been wanting to talk about beer ads for ages, but I forgot to mention them. See ar. These are misleading! There are a lot of beer ads that have pictures of successful men or brave men, with words like "you can be the same". THESE ARE TERRIBLY MISLEADING! How can you be successful if you drink beer? How can you be brave/strong if you drink beer? It doesn't make sense! The ads give people FALSE HOPES! Stupid right? I remember it was a Wedesday (the Wed when Dad collects his taxi), when we are eating breakfast. The posters were besides me. I got so terribly irked by the false messages that I commented about them throughout the whole breakfast. My parents, of course, did not say anything, because they were used to me doing that. BEER ADS ARE MISLEADING!   EDIT: Yesterday night I watched Moulin Rouge! OH MY GOD! It's such a wonderful show! It's romantic, it's touching, it feels so real! The love story of Christian and Satine, spoilt by the evil, unscruplous Duke! I felt so touched! Satine suffered a terrible fate! So sad! I wanna buy the VCD!! The soundtrack too! So many nice songs! Especially 'Roxanne' and 'Come What May'! Meow!!  Er hm. I think I end le la. It's my turn to mop the kitchen floor soon. See ya tomorrow. TaTa.

      MEOW MOO!!! MEOW MOO!!   Saturday - At The MAA   Yeah, as you guys know, WQ was late. However, I ain't no fool to wait for him all alone. I went up to find Wendy and chat with her. HaHa. We chatted till WQ came. Me and WQ then took the MRT towards Kallang MRT. How meowful. We listened to his discman on most of the journey.   Hm. We went to buy some drinks, then went to wait for bus 11 (I assure you, it is not a joke. There's really a bus 11. I thought WQ was joking when he said we are taking bus 11, which means we walk la. HaHa!), which didn't came for a long long time. Hmm... We finally arrived at Indoors Stadium at 3.  Woah! The queue is considerably short ma. We queued up at the "With Bags" queue (we shoulda queued up at the "No Bags" queue, they moved faster when going in). Hmm. WQ left to look for more drinks and food to buy.  What a surprise. I saw Sonia there. She was with Max. She was in the No Bags queue. So good! She informed me that MeiYing and WeiLin is at the Red Carpet. Woah!! HaHa. So many Riversidians there. Meow moo! Oh my...the wait was terrible though. It was like until 5 then they started letting people in. We were very bored waiting. I mainly eavesdropped on the group of people (the only male there is a CHC member, he was defending HYS) in front of us. Bo liao ma. I also eavesdropped on the people behind me too. Talk so loud. HaHa! Sonia came a few times to talk and borrow WQ's camera. HaHa!  By 5, we started to go in. It was as smooth as I wished. There were major stops here and there. It was around 5.45 when we finally went inside the gates for our bags to be checked. Meow moo. When we were admitted into the stadium, it was 6. Meow moo meow!   We were herded into the West section. Hmm.. it was not too crowded. We have space to move around. We got quite a good view la. The cameraman was the only one blocking our view. HaHa. Everybody was quite irrtated at him at one point and shouted at him to siam. Not me though. Heh.   In came my nightmare. 3 Vanness fans suddenly appeared! They started shouting for Vanness. I was like nearly deafened by them (coz one stood to my right). Meow moo. I really hates it whenever Vanness comes on stage, which is every so often because he's the host, because those girls will start screaming. Meow moo!  At 7+, the show started. HaHa! Vanness looked quite cute. His English is very accented though. I wonder who taught him. Michelle Branch was in a really revealing halter (she said in TNP interview that she had lotsa tapes). Of course, they changed costumes a lot of time, but Michelle always wore a halter. Meow moo.  Hmm. The awards show is not bad la! Quite enjoyable too. I really like the performances! Heh Heh! Of course, the favorite is Black Eyed Peas' finale performance of Where Is The Love and Shut Up. I also liked the performance by Simple Plan and Gareth Gates (with Siti Nurhaliza). Meow moo!   Lets talk about the awards. Hmm. Most of them I am quite okay la. I don't like the cats who won the Best Video and Favorite Female awards. For Best Vid, Linkin Park won, but I was hoping for Justin or Christina. For Favorite Female, it went to Christina. I was hoping either Beyonce, Dido or Michelle Branch to clinch that award. Hmm. Meow moo meow! Stephanie won Favorite Artiste Singapore! Go Steph! HaHa. She said it hoped it would be going to Tanya next year (poor Tanya the underdog). Meow moo! Sun Ho (such a stupid name. HYS is good enough) will never win de la! When her names come out, there are a few applauses and even boos. Heh!  After the MAA ended, me and WQ wanted to take taxis back home de. Idiotic taxis!! No taxis!! Lousy! We had to take the MRT and bus home lor. HaHa. MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW!! After coming back home, I ate and drank supper (SO HUNGRY AND THRISTY!), then went to bath and then to sleep lor.    Sunday   Hmm. Today morning don't narrate la. Same old thing de. I shouldn't eat the carrot cake. Woah liao! I got diarrhea. Always get diarrhea when I eat that de. Hmmmp!!   OMG! I found out that ny Neofriend was one of the 3 crazy Vanness cats. She came online with the nick about Vanness rocks during MAA. I asked if she was in my sector. She said yes. HaHa! So qiao hor! Even ducks meow!!   Hmm. Later hor, I will be online, but won't be blogging. That's why I am blogging now la. Channel 5 and Channel 8 is so conflicting! At 7, 5 is showing Moulin Rouge. I wanna watch!! However, at the same time, 8 is showing Unbeatables! I wanna watch Zoe Tay fighting against the Tay Ping Hui!! How to watch like that!! So meowingly meow meow moo!! Never mind, swtich on two TVs and keep running to and fro between them.  Well. I think I end le la. I got lotsa things to do. See ya tomorrow! Bye bye!

      Hey Hey! Oppsie! I haven't blogged yet, and I am rushing late to meet WQ. Blog important.  Lets skip morning. Basically, it's the same la. I went to write my Transfiguration essay, which is to write a story about Metamorphmagus. I didn't plan to do it de, but this morning in the bath, a great story idea came into my head. I thought "Why not?" and then wrote a story. I think it is a well-written story. What grade would I get? O? HaHa. Meow moo.  Okay okay. Later, I am going to go to MAA with WQ! WEEE!! How meowful! I am so looking forward towards MAA! I'll come back with my experience there, so wait for me, okay? Meow moo meow!! (My fingers are flying all over the keyboard now...cannot slow slow type).   Update. Okay. Don't have to type so fast anymore. That idiotic WQ is waiting for his lunch to be cooked. Why didn't he use his brain and ask his grandmother to cook EARLIER? He said he was online. What a twit!   Meow meow meow!! Okay. I go liao la. See ya!! Bye bye! Oh yes, Happy Valentine's Day!

      I just wanna add to today's entry.   Hm. I enjoyed myself at pool today. HaHa. Me, CQ, Joyce, Gloria and HL played together. At first hor, I was quite clumsy. As time goes by, I got into the game quickly. HaHa! Me and HL was in a group together, the rest another. HaHa! In the end, our group won! We played 3 games total ma. We won once by skills and the other by default (they shoot the cue ball in after the black ball, which is not allowed). Heh! We enjoyed ourselves today. I then rushed back to watch Survivor.  I did not rush back for nothing. At first, I was afraid for Rupert being voted out, because the whole tribe seemed to dislike him or something. However, things changed dramatically. Jenna announced at the Immunity Challenge that she wanted out. Her cancer-stricken mother is in a very bad shape, and Jenna is really regretting her decision to come to All-Stars. She wants to be there by her mother. "I got a gut feeling my mother needs me, my father needs me, everyone needs me". She left the game. She did the right thing. Her mother died 8 days after she returned. She did the right thing man! This goes to show the strong bond (her gut feelings) between family members. My respect for Jenna went up several notches. Go Jenna! She's a true Survivor.   As you can se, I felt very touched, that's why I chose to write about this now. :)  Alright, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! I am blogging this early because I am going out later. Most probably. Meow!               Okie. YaY!! Yesterday, Fantasia Barino and Diana Degarmo got into the finals!! WEEE! I expected Fantasia to win, but I didn't really expect Diana. She got a great voice nonetheless! Incidentally, the two of them were what all 3 judges predict could be in the finals! Woot! The next group is sucky though. I only like the Briana Ramirez-Rial. Meow moo!   Hmm. Today has almost been boring. The only interesting thing that happened is that I mopped the floor lor. I don't really like mopping the floor of the rooms and the hall. I can't really spot any difference. The kitchen however, is so dirty with all the stains (oil, food, this and that) that when you mopped, you can see the dirt being cleaned off. That gives me a lot of statisfaction. HaHa. Weird meow meow.   Hmm. I also spent the whole day planning and calling cats for the pool thing tonight. WQ got very annoyed at my constant calling. Sorry la. Even ducks meow. Hmmm. Meow moo! I must come back in time for Survivor. I hope Sabago wins this time! Hmm! Rupert's in danger! Meow moo!!  Okay. I end le la. See ya tomorrow (before I go to the MAA. WEE!!)! Bye bye!

The pants keep slipping down. Meow!! The ducks moo!  Hmm. I met Gloria and we walked towards Admiralty MRT to meet up with HuiLing. We then went to Woodlands, where we met WQ and KS at Long John Silver. We ate lunch lor. LJS, as usual, tried to cheat me, but I am not stupid. Meow moo!! After eating, I went to return Wendy money. She don't need mah help anymore. Meow moo! After that, we met CQ, Hann and ChinKang at Woodlands. We went to NYP (and Shin Han met us on the way).   Hmm. NYP was meowful. We gotta register and all. Even the cats meows! Hmm. We only attended two talks, on Life Sciences and IT. Meow moo. They then went to eat, walk around and went to enjoy themselves elsewhere. HaHa. That's all lor.  We first went to the Grassroot (Chao Gen) Country Club to play bowling, but it was full, so we went to AMK Central instead. Gossip Gossip Gossip. Meow moo! HaHa. We tried going to the Cathay Bowling somehwhere in AMKI Cnetral, but it was shut down for business a month ago. Meow!! We then went to MacDonalds to chat and gossip more. I ate the Ice Cream Cone. After talking and talking, we went home lor.  Meow moo! I reached home at 6.30, bathed and then ate while watching TV. I came online lor. HaHa. Today, TaTa Young and Blue is coming to Perfect 10!

When I see Glenn hor, it reminds me of someone. HaHa. Whatever. Mother brought brakfast back, and after eating, I went online lor.  At 10+, I went down to Metro to take money from her to help her buy gifts. HaHa. I see the weather being almost raining, I hurriedly made my way down lor. HaHa. In the end, I stayed for an hour to chat with Wendy. HaHa. Chat Chat Chat.  I arrived home at 12+. After lunch, I went to play my game, then came online and went to watch TV/bath/eat.   Sigh. After all these are done, I came online again. A lot a lot of things happened. I don't wanna disclose, but after all these, I felt that life sucks. Within a short span on 2 hours, I experienced anger, fustration, annoyance, stupidity and guilt. I feel that life sucks after what happened. LIFE SUCKS.  Wanna know what I am doing now? I am singing songs out loud. Freak. Gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.

      Meow moo meow!!  Today morning can be summed up in a word: maddening. Really! Okay...I met WQ at 9.30 la. I don't have to elaborate on that too much. The stupid thing started when we went to YJ to get done with the withdrawal process. The trouble is with the stupid process itself. WQ has to go find his teachers to meow (okay okay, SIGN) on the withdrawal form. We had toruble locating some teachers. We met Janet and Gloria on his quest to get signatures. Sigh. I was so totally complaining (yeah, I was bitchy. Sorry WQ....but I was terribly irrtated). We met a girl la, who is also quitting. Fine. They went searching together lor. In the end, they have to meet the vice principal's signature. I waited outside the office and saw HuiLing and Julia. Oh yes, I was reading my Book 5 Clues book, so meow. In the end hor, the v.p. refused to sign, saying that they lost too many pupils (HAHA! Huo gai!). Both of them then handed in their withdrawal form, and left the school. The office called them to come back, but they heck care and just walked off. HaHa! Steady sia! Anyhoo, that's what I have been telling WQ to do. Just pon. Why bother going through all these idiotic processes? Wastage of time. In the end, he ended up taking my advice. Sigh! Seee, don't listen to me some more la.   After that, me and WQ shared a meal together in KFC. HaHa. Eat and eat and eat chickens. Meow moo!!   Hm, after that we took 855 towards Lornie Road. HaHa. I didn't really know where to get down, I only know that it is after Macritchie. Yeah....we got off at the right stop la. Meow moo. The way to Mediacorp Studios wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Quite short actually. Meow moo! I collected my tiks!! YAY!!! Hmm...have to be there latest 5.30. We have to be there earlier!! EARLIER!! Or else no place to stand le!! Meow!!   After getting the tiks, we took the bus 852 to Khatib MRT. Meow. We then took the MRT towards Woodlands lor. WQ went to tighten his watch while I went to visit Wendy and show her the tiks. Meow moo!! After that, we went back.   Hmm...I went to bath, then went online la. Oh oh! Thursday must do something for Wendy. Cannot tell. Secret. After that, we ate dinner la. I came online, then went to watch shows and came back.  AHHHHHHH! AGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE! Stupid static!!!!! I ADJUSTED THAT STUPID ANTENNA LOADS AND LOADS AND LOADS AND LOADS OF TIMES! AND WHAT?

      Meow moo!! Monday rocks your socks!  Hmm. The Grammys!! Heh Heh! Yes, I did come out of the bathroom with plenty of time to catch the Grammys. HaHa. It was a great show (although I fell asleep at some point of time for a short while). They said Beyonce won 5 awards (YAY!! Way to go, Beyonce!), but I only saw one!! (I only fell alsleep for a very short segment!) How could it be possible?!! Very very strange! Evanescence won New Artistes and another award. YaY!! Even ducks meow at the Grammys! Hmm... I loved Justin's performance (of Senorita) and Beyonce's (performed Dangerously In Love)! Meow meow!!  Hmm... after the Grammys it was almost boring. I went online and played games lor. Oh yes yes. I vomitted out a large piece of cuttlefish. HaHa. I didn't chew it up properly and it got stuck in my oesophagus. I have to vomit it out. Meow moo!! Also, Wendy invited me over to play MahJong! Alas! How I wish I can join her! I can't, due to dinner obligations. Sigh!!  I went to back, ate dinner and came online. HaHa. Ayioh meow!! Okay. I stop here le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Sun-meow-day!!  Hmm. Today's morning is a typical Sunday lor. Woke up early, bathed, ate breakfast and watched TV till 1. Of course, I went online at 11 to meow at XC.   Hmm. In the afternoon, I went to play bball with so many cats (Huiling and her two sisters, Gloria, KimSeng, CQ, Joyce and PY). We met at Marsiling, and proceeded to Woodlands Indoor Stadium to rent courts lor. We rented a court for 2 hours, 3-5.  We played and played. At 4, WQ called and said he's coming down. YaY! Okay, I then helped HL, Gloria and Ji write their excuse letter from school on Friday (they went to SP). I spent a good 15 minutes writing. HaHa. After that, it was more badminton playing till 5.  At 5, WQ invited us to his house (Woah!! First time wor!! Haha! He never invites us to his house de!) to eat some dinner. I don't know why la, I think his parents cooked extra and need people to finish it. While waiting for dinner, we played BlackJack. HaHa. We played with money, 10 cents 20 cents only la. I think I lost in the end ar. HaHa. I only won once. That Joyce is really so lucky...such a good dealer. HaHa!   After the gambling, we ate dinner at 6. Actually, me and Gloria are the only ones who really ate. We ate one bowl of rice (the others shared) each and the veggies. I even ate another bowl. Heh heh. Like that, I don't have to waste money buying dinner le ma. HaHa. We talked about a lot of things, until WQ's grandmum chased us off (indriectly). Meow moo!  After that, me, CQ, Gloria and KS went to MacDonalds while the rest went home. KS and CQ brought food and we continued talking lor. We talked until about 7.30, where I brought the MacWings meal back for my brother.  HaHa. While walking back from Gloria's house, I held my racket in my other hand. I always feel very unsafe when carrying food without a protection (like umbrella or racket or long thingy that can beat the crap out of a potential thief). I always fear people would snatch my food away (crazy despos will). Besides, there are always gangsters in that area lurking about. So scary.   I came back at 8. I have to bribe my brother ($2) to tell my mother that I came back at 6. My mother will scold me like shit if she knew I came home at 8(and left my brother starving for his dinner). Meow moo!! I then went to bath, and came online lor.    I never seen Wendy come online for so long. HaHa. I knew she must be busy playing with her PS2. Woah! FFX ba. Meow moo! She's having so much fun with her PS2. Meow meow!! Oei, Wendy ar, if you are seeing this, come online once in a while leh. So long never talk to you le!! Meow moo meow!! (Duhz...if she reads this, she's already online. Meow!!)  Okay. I think I end le liao. See ya tomorrow (Grammys tomorrow! WEEE!!)! Bye bye!!Night blog!

      Hey hey! "Could you look me in the eye and tell me that you are happy now, ooh ooh ooh ooh" I am listening to Michelle Branch's CD (Hotel Paper) on my radio. HAHA!Groove to the music!  Oh yes, before I talk about today, I wanna share my views with yesterday's Survivor. Rudy was voted off (I thought Ethan). Poor thing. Everyone were stuck with a choice (not Rupert, he didn't vote off his ally). Either Rudy goes, or Ethan goes. Rudy, even though he was liked by everyone, was weak and frail, setting the team back in challenges. Ethan, even though everyone wanted him to get out because he won before, is strong and useful in challenges. I guess the team's survival is more crucial at this point of time. Oh well....a pity.  It's a brand new Saturday! So meowingly meowful. Okay...got up at the same time, and this time, I only bathed for 30 minutes. Tomorrow too. I gotta rush to watch Digimon. Meow moo. After some online surfing, I went to watch TV and eat breakfast (chee cheong fun).   At 11, I came online again. I chatted with XC, WQ (for a brief period of time), then ate lunch. After that, I went to play my PT. I played that until 4, then continued surfing till time to bath (6).  After bathing, it was eating dinner while watching TV. Heh Heh. After the Simpsons, I came back just in time to listen to Rick Dees' Number 1 song. It's Hey Ya by Outkast (for 8 weeks). "Hey ya....hey ya....hey ya!"  Well, today seems kinda boring. Wendy reminded me that I owed her $13.50 for the Internet service. Oh well. I wonder how I am going to pay her back, when I don't have moolah right now (I am not going to school, Mother stopped giving me my allowances. Damn...). Meow! Find a way!! Yes, WQ owes me money. YES YES! KS owes me money! I have enough (plus some ltitle bit from me) to repay Wendy le. Meow!!!  Hmm... I gotta go le la. What an early blog, you say. Oh well. How meowful! See ya tomorrow!

      Oh my Friday meowing day!  Hmmm..I woke up at the usual time (8.30), then went to bath while Mom went to buy breakfast. Oh my meow! I spent a record time of an hour in the bathroom! Oooo! I was thinking...and thinking....and thinking...and just letting the water flow all over me. Heh heh.   Anyhoo, I went surfing then ate breakfast when Mother came back. After breakfast, I was assigned to clean the floors of our wonderful home. HaHa. So tiring! I hate using the vacuum cleaner, so troublesome de. I prefer moping the floor, so I let my mother vacuum, while I mop. Heh. Meow moo!  Hmmm. After that, I went online, surfed the Net then ate lunch (instant noodles). As sudden as a flying cat, CQ and WQ called to invite me to play bowling with them. It didn't take me long to hesistate. I left my handphone home, so my Mother can take it to Causeway Point's Nokia Care Centre to service it (the vibrations were spoilt).  Oh my meow. I came earlier (as usual). For the entire time waiting for WQ, I was so worried. I didn't bring my phone with me. I can't contact him to know where he is, and vice versa. I became real panicky. I have a whole new appreciation for my mobile phone. I can't do without it! Meow moo! I even have to spend 40 cents (the first twenty went into a spoilt phone in which WQ couldn't hear my voice) to call WQ. Meowing moo. We took the 960 bus towards Bukit Panjang.  We met CQ, Gloria and HuiLing at Superbowl (they went to see SP Open House together). We played three games in total. Today, my bowling skills downgraded to the point of being sucky. Most of my balls end up in the gutter. Xi long guo! HaHa! So lousy!! Everyone else played a good game. Good job people!   We came out at 4.50+, it was drizzzling. We took 960 back, with CQ and WQ dropping off at Marsiling. Me and Gloria went home by the 913 bus, as usual.   Hmmm..I came back, bathed, ate dinner and came online Oh meow! Even Survivor is meowing later! Meow moo!!!  I think I ened le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Today was such a meowingly meow meow day.  Okay. Today leh, we went to NP and SP. Okay okay. I woke up at 6.30 (becuase I take 30 mins to bath). After that, I called everyone to make sure they are up. I ate my breakfast then went out to meet my friends. Oh yes, I got a feeling WQ will bring a small bag, not big enough to contain my Sims CDs. HaHa. Surprise surprise. I met Wendy on the bus to Woodlands. So "suey". :D  Hmmm....Me and Wendy were the first to arrive. WQ then arrived, followed shortly by Eugene and Yean Seng. Oh my...they are here! ...! Amanda was kinda late (hey, I even mistook a lady for Amanda. I call her "oei!" So embarrassing!!). We went to MacDonalds to eat first (Me, WQ, Amanda and Wendy...the two went to Yishun) while waiting for Cherie and ShinHan. SH joined us in Mac, and after finishing breakfast, we went to the MRT. We took the JE-bound train and changed trains to get to Clementi, a stop away. We have to wait for the two boys, who lagged behind.  HaHa. We took a bus to Ngee Ann. Heh Heh. Hmm, soon we spilt up lor. I went with Amanda, Wendy and Cherie, while the rest of the boys stayed in their own group. We were like kinda lost, but we found our way to the Main Hall. The boys went to Engineering, while we went to the Media, Sciences, Early Childhood and Business. I like the Business lecturer. So cool! :D I like the school, kinda. Meow moo!  After that, we went to the Atrium. We brought some rice to eat, while the boys went to tour the CCA booths. We finished eating then we went to the busstop, where they came just in time to catch the shuttle bus. Oh! Tsz Hin was with them! We took the bus to Clementi Interchange, where we took 147 towards Dover MRT, interlinked to Singapore Poly.   SP was also confusing. We got lost again. Oh my meow! Moo Meow! After some long long walking, we finally found our way to the Concourse. Wendy and Amanda went to the courses they wanted. After touring, we went down to the canteen to meet the boys. After some time, we started on our way home.  Cherie and Amanda are going to Bugis, while the rest of us are going towards Woodlands. Me, Wendy and WQ are going to Wendy's house to play MahJong. :D We arrived at her house at around 2 something. HeHe. First, it was we three and Auntie playing MahJong. Can I mention again that I like playing MahJong with Auntie? I always enjoy myself! So fun one! We played till KL came, who took over Auntie and played till 6 something. HaHa. Such a fun game. Me and WQ left for home first. Moo meow!   I arrived back home at 6 something, bathed, ate dinner while watching TV and came online. Aspiring Author replied! She thanked me for my reply and says her friend agreed with her. Heh. Hmm..YAY! WQ is quitting YJ! YAY!!! A meowing cat to talk to all the time! A duck to identify with! YAY!!! I am so happy for him! He can be free, free from the pathetic excuse they call a school! Meow meow meow meow!!  Okay. I already decided who I am going to take to the MTV Asia Awards. Oh yes! It's...Koo Wen Qiang! Meow! :)  Okay. I am kinda late for my AI. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Meowing moo meow!! Wednesday conquers all!  Okie. Today I woke up at 8.30, bathed and went to 883 with my parents. I got this feeling that today is the last time Dad is going to 883 with me and Mother. Meow moo! Hmm...I ate duck porridge. I brought 8 Days and Lime (Wendy recommends the Poly section. Might as well check it out). As usual, I read 8 Days while walking around la. We met my grandmother. Meowing moo! We came back at 10.30.  When I logged into MuggleNet Interactive, there's a new message for me. It looks like I has just gotten my first piece of assignment. I signed up as a beta reader for aspiring authors, and one of them owled me her story.   Well, it seems like we haven't gotten off to a good start. The story, basically, sucks. Grammar errors were abundant! She claimed to have spell-checked her work, but what she doesn't know is that the computer spell-checker wouldn't catch offending words like "hare" (she means hair) and "new" (knew). I think Mr Tsung will vomit blood all over his desk after reading the original story. Yes, it was that bad. If you say the grammar is the worst, wait till you read the plot. Hermione tuned punk and vain to the point of ugliness, Draco fell in love with Hermione, and the worst is that Harry and Herimone had sex while Hermione was consoling Harry about Sirus's death. Harry even greeted Hermione by kissing her on the cheek. Oh my god...such deformation of our beloved characters. This story is a disaster!  Of course, in my reply, I didn't tell her that. Although I felt like doing a Simon Cowell on her, I gently pointed her to her mistakes. I showed her where she went wrong and how she could improve. I even said "I look forward to reading your work again". HaHa! Okay, I don't really look forward to that, but I do look forward to reading her reply. How meowful!   Okay...I ate nasi lemak for lunch, chatted with XC, then went to play my game. Oh my. It looks like my father got his taxi back today. Ooooo! My feeling was right! :D How meowful.   Hmm...bascially, after that, was more Internet surfing, bathing and eating dinner. Oh my meow. It looks like WQ is joining me, Amanda and Wendy to visit NP and SP for their Open Houses tomorrow. How mooing.   Okay. i end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey HEY HEY!!!!  OH MY GOD! i WON TWO TICKETS TO MTV ASIA AWARDS!!! I CALLED THROUGH!!!! WOO-HOO!!!!! Okay okay. Calm down, KY. It all happened during all Request Live (Jean's show). Alright. I was playing my game as usual when Jean announced that a pair of tickets was to be won. I decided to try my luck, ya know. I called and called...about 5-6 times. Then, I finally dialled through. Oh my.... Should I hang up? I decided to call through...  "Hello! Perfect 10! This is Jean here! Congratulations! Can you leave me your particulars?" OH MY GOD!!!!!!  After giving her my particulars, she asked "Can you sing us a song?"  "Perfect by Simple Plan?"I rehearsed a lot a lot of times, but today, I just cna't seem to sing it right! "Oh god...I am too nervous"  "Don't worry...breathe in....You want to try another song? Michelle Branch, Liberty X, Black Eyed Pea..."  "I think I wanna sing Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now. Er... Could you look me in the eye, and tell me that you are happy now, woah woah woah...." My song sucks...I was shaking all over.  "Great! You need to be louder, okay? You are too soft! Alright, wait a while.... (Say something about the previous song) Alright! We have our lucky 10th caller! Hello Kelvin!"  "Heya!"  "How are you now?"  "Oh...I am a bit sick, down with a minor fever, but I am quite alright, I guess." Why am I reporting my sickness?  "Are you ready to sing us a song, Kelvin?"  "Sure...I am singing Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now. Er... (breathe in) Could you look me in the eye, and tell me you are happy now, woah woah woah... Heh. It kinda lousy, my pitching is very lousy" I was so so so nervous!  "You did well! You got the tone and words, well done! You won yourself a pair of tickets to the MAA! Who would you like to dedicate this next song to?"  "Er...Manda, Wendy, WQ...I am too nervous to remember my friends name (laughter from Jean)...Those of you tuning in right now, you know who you are!" Oh my...I am quite blushing.   "Alright, enjoy this next song from (forgot le)... Kelvin! Congrats! You can pick up your tickets at the Mediacorp TV reception. Please bring along your IC, yeah? (some okays from me). Bye bye!!"  OH MY GOD! After days of calling and trying, I finally got through!!! I WON THE TICKETS!!! I jumped around and around!! I am so happy! I called Wendy, who shared the excitement with me. After that, I called WQ! He was so happy! He wanted to go to the MAA. Hmmm.... This begins a exciting audition process. I am offering my ticket to Wendy, Amanda, Arman, Hann and WQ. O.O  I continued playinig my game, but of course, I quit soon after because I am too happy to kill little creatures. Heh Heh. Hmm....I began to devise my audition process. Amanda quit because she got work on Sat night (such a pity...). There's the elimination round, the semi-finals and the finals. The elimination round is basically  those who has a significant other cannot go due to committments with their partner (MAA is on Valentine Day). The semi-finals consists of several questions set by yours truly, which will determine who goes into the finals. The procedures finals has not been decided yet though. Right now, only WQ got into the finals. Right now, there are three places in the finals (including WQ). If anyone quits, I am gonna limit the finals to two (because the rest will get in by default). Complicated process, I know. Oh meow! I am gonna have fun auditioning.   Oh meow. Now, what do I have to say? Ehh...my fever's gone? HaHa. Actually, I don't know what to say le. I am still overwhelmed by my lucky win! Meow moo!!  I think I am going off le la...Heh Heh. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Meow moo! I am very tired now, for I'm down wth the fever. Meow.  Hmm. Today we were supposed go bowling, me, Joyce, CQ and WQ. That Joyce suddenly cancelled, saying that she's the only girl. CQ cancelled after that, and WQ has no mood to go bowling. I was so mad...my happiness was being deprived. MEOW!   Sigh! I then watched my Cardcaptor Sakura movie, the Chingay Parade and my taped Sat's shows. Meow. After that, I went online lor. Play games, surfed the Net. At 5, I took a short afternoon nap. When I woke up, I felt really weak and hot. When I took my temperautre, my body temperature measured 37.9 degrees. Oh my meow....I am wearing a jacket now because when I am feverish, I feel very cold when coming into contact with fans. Meow.   Hmm... I am very troubled. I put on more weight! OH MY GOD! I LOOK SO FAT! I visited a website on fet reducing. Horrors of horrors! I gotta eat right, do regular aerobic exercises... Oh my god....I want to go for liposuction! MEOW!!  Okay, I think I end le...

      Heya! Sorry for not blogging yesterday, but I was unavailable for comment. Heh Heh. I gotta rush this blog though, because I wanna watch Spy Kids at 10.   SATURDAY   Heya! Well, let's skip the morning, as nothing really interesting happened. Oh yes...the plan failed. Not really. She didn't put the leaves. Darn. Heh. Okay. I played my game until WQ smsed. He basically said that he's alone at Orchard now, and would like me to go down there to see the Chingay Parade with him. After much thinking, I agreed lor. So, I wolfed down my dinner and rushed out to meet him.  Hm. Hann and Ke Yun is coming also, but they are meeting us later. I accompanied WQ to eat, then we went out to find a spot. HaHa. It was getting crowded, but we got a nice view, up a parapet, between Taka and Wisma. Heh Heh. Soon, Hann and KY came. They went to look for seats at the performing area (we are the area where the contingents just walk past without performing. the performance area needs tickets to get in), but there are no seats. After standing around, we decide to scout for a better place to watch the performance (and I think people on the parapet were so happy because we left. Heh).   Okay. Lets try to make things short. We finally found a place at Performance Sector 4. After so many searching, climbing on fences and using lamposts and trees as support (and being chased down by the idioitc police...grr!) and walking to find places, we found some space at the road in front of the stands in Sector 4. YH said "nobody said we cannot sit there, so why not?".   HaHa! We got such a clear view of everything because the performers were very close to us. However, when we arrived, the parade just started (and it ended in Sector 1. Heh Heh). The first contigent was the Opening Parade. OMG! Got lotsa stars there! Cynthia Koh, Jacelyn Tay, The President, Terrence Cao. The biggest attraction is Jackie Chan! WE SAW JACKIE CHAN!!! OMG! All of us waved at him like mad sia! HAHA!   I don't have time to list every parade (and my memory is not that good anyway), so I will just describe my favorites. RSS participated!! When we saw a banner being proudly carried out by our RSS boys, four of us started cheering madly. HaHa! The Chinese and Modern Dance particiapted in this dance segment. YH was trying to attract their attention and make them laugh. Heh Heh! After that, got the Japanese contigent, the Sakura one. They spew out lotsa sakura (fake ones of course). HaHa! The last one which I throughly enjoyed is the American International School's performance. They grooved to Me Against The Music. Coolies! I love that song, and the performance too! Meow!  The last contigent arrived and we followed it till Dhoby Ghuat. We then took the MRT back. I accompanied WQ to eat at BK lor. My feelings? I really enjoyed myself lor. I felt very very happy, something which I didn't feel for so long. :D After reaching home, I ate a chicken bun, bathed and went to sleep.    TODAY   Heya. Okay. Today, in the morning, Mother cooked laksa for lunch! YAY! So yummy! I encouraged her to do it AGAIN! Heh Heh.  In the afternoon, me, Ji, Ji's brother, Joyce, KimSeng and Gloria  went to play badminton. Originally, we planned to play in the badminon court, but all the courts are fully booked. After walking for ages, we finally found somewhere in Marsiling. We played and played until 6. They went to the MacDonalds nearby to drink and talk. We went off at 7. I reached home at 7.30, bathed and ate my dinner.  ayiah. So rushing. HaHa. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Meow moo meow!  Hmm. Even today is meowing! I woke up at 8. Wah...I had a very interesting dream today. I wonder... Anyhoo, I woke up, took a bath and watched TV. Yes! No time to come online to check on MNI. Mother brought back breakfast (duck porridge) and I meowed at it. Hmm. At 10.30, I came online. After that, I went away to watch HZGG and eat lunch (marcoroni). What another touching HZGG! Ayioh!! When is that stupid emperor coming to find them? SLOW!   Hmm. At 1,  was online lor. I went to play GunBound for awhile, then went off to surf the Net. Oh yes. I did my Pupil's Profile form. Ayioh!! The spaces were too little!! How am I supposed to write a lot! Haiyoh! Lousy! After writing the form, it was more internet surfing and chatting. Ayioh. So many cats to talk to!   Hmm. At 5, I went off to buy dinner for me and brother. It was Hokkien Prawn Mee again. Ayioh! I lost in the "4D People Counting" game!! Hokkien Prawn Mee is SLOW!      Hmm. I went back and ate while watching Unbeatables. Yao shu!! The mee is so spicy! I want to die le! After TV watching and dinner, I went to throw away the rubbish. Before I did, I took the strings attached to my pen and burnt them. The strings were from the Prelims and Os. Burning them sybolizes the end of one chapter of my life, and the start of the next. The plastic bag almost burnt. :P  After that, I went to bath, and tada, I am online. Right now, Wendy's at my house. Talking to me lor. That idiotic brother. I have to make him swear not to tell my parents. Ayier. I must also leave the door open ("gu nan kua nu" nonsense!).   Yay! I learnt how to tie a tie. HaHa. Finally! CQ told me tomorrow must bring PJ tie (the design is so horrendous!), so I must learn how to tie. Hmm. I went to a website and learnt lor. I did 4 different ties before settling down with the Half-Windsor Knot. O.O!! And AR!!! PE tomorrow! Eeee!   Okay. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.

      Heya meow moo! Even ducks are meowing!  Today, I woke up at 8.30. It'a nice to wake up late for a change. Oh my my! Even ducks are meowing. I went to bath, after which, I went online. Hmm. Breakfast came. Even the chee cheong fun looks so inviting. Yes! After that, I watched TV, then went out to play basketball with CQ and cats.  Hmm. I reached there around 11.30. HaHa. I played with the cats for about 30 minutes. WQ is extremely dazed. I wonder what's up with him. I only played for 30 minutes, because we stopped playing when WQ's glasses are knocked down and is bent. O.O Yes. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat. WQ and PY had to go out, so they didn't come along.   Okie. We went up to the foodcourt to eat. Hmm. I ate black carrot cake. Yes! Or else, I have no moolah left to drink! Even carrot cakes tastes nice. Joyce gave me her chicken wings because she don't like to eat the wings (Seee WQ! People are so generous! Yes, I haven't forgotten the Fiesta incident! You threw away the wings, refusing to give me!! Oh yes, I still remember, and I will keep on remembering! My wings!!). She's eating the sambal chicken and the sambal sauce is absolutely fantastic! I must eat sambal chicken rice next time! HM joined us. Hello!   After that, we went around shopping. We went up to Metro 3rd level, to shop for bags. I saw Wendy there, but she was busy serving a customer, so I didn't get to talk to her in the end. Hmm. We went down to Guardian, because HM wants to buy things. We played with the Nivea Deodarant (testing can). The smell kinda reminds me of someone. Yes!! After that, we went around lor. Joyce wanted to buy a computer and she asked for my help lor. Hmm. I gave her some advice. After that, we went to take NeoPrints. We took 2 times. O.O In one of the pics, they put a crown over my head and the words "Emperor". Meow moo moo!  Hmm. Me and Gloria went home. Me, CQ and Gloria were very worried for the height and weight taking. We were scared we will end up in the Health and Fitness Club (those who are 130% overweight and above MUST enter that as an CCA)! We don't want! Choir is our ONLY choice!! You know what? Our worries are unfounded. I checked with my Health Booklet. If the info's accurate now (CQ said it is...height-for-weight tables don't change over the years), then all of us are very safe. We are in the 120% region! YAY!! Choir!!   Okie. I came back, bathed and went online. Yes! At 6.30, I went to eat dinner and watch my show. Even ducks are meowing! After eating and watching the TV, I came back online.  Hmm. What else to add? Yes, must do the Student Profile form! The cats are gonna see some pretty interesting answers! I gotta go, so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Meow moo meow!!  Quackity meow! Today was meowful! Yes, very! Hmmm. I slept again, meow moo. Hmmm. I was kinda late, because I fell asleep while eating breakfast. Yes!  Today is the first day of the mass lecture. The 1st hour is Assembly with Mr Tham. O.O What a weird Thamy Tham Tham cat. Yes! After that is a long long peiod of break. We orignally planned to play games, but in the end, did not. I spent the time studying Mole Concept. Hmmm. Quite easy la, but I need time to understand.   After that were 2 lectures. Chem, followed by Maths. Hmmm. I learnt something new in Maths. AP, that chapter. Hmm. Quite easy, actually. Chem lecture was just intro to the subject and all.  After the two lectures, we decided to go to Bukit Panjang Plaza to eat. Me, Janet, WQ, Gloria, CQ, Josephine and her two friends. Hmm. I was damn hungry man. I wanted to eat at the food court, settle it there and then. That WQ don't want, and we ended up eating at KFC. Sigh. Hmm. When we are going back to attend make-up Maths lecture, it rained. Rainy rainy rain. I have to shelter WQ. Yes.  Hmm. Make-up lecture for Maths (Partial Fractions) is quite easy. Yep. So is Chem, because I read up on CQ's notes before. Hmm. I think I've got the basics spot on. Yep. That's good.  Hmmm. After that was campfire. We have to wait for awhile. I mean, a long while. It was raining outside, so in the end, they decided to carry out the cmapfire in the hall. Hmmm. They mostly did song-singing and some games. O.O! Even the songs are nice. Yes! Me and CQ had fun.HaHa. We danced the PJ song at the end. CQ refused to let me be the 'girl'! Hmp! :P   After that, me, CQ, WQ, Gloria, Janet and TZ went to Lot 1 to eat lor. I didn't have money, so I have to borrow some for Gloria. I brought Ice Kacang to eat. So damn hungry. After that, we took the MRT home. This time, me, Gloria and Janet took the bus home instead of walking.   Hmm. I reached back at 10+. Survivor Recap is showing. EE. I don't really like recap, so after bathing, I went online lor. Wah...I just came back from watching First Cut: The New Home. A ghost movie lor. So scary! I don't dare to go to sleep now...or even go out later. Never mind, don't go out lor. :P  Ahh well. I gotta go now. It's actually 1.10am when I am finished. Due to continuity issues, I am changing the time. Yes! Ahh yes. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow! What a busy busy day!  Hmmm. Today is a meowing day. Yes. I slept on the journey again. O.O Anyway, we have to wait a bit. Gloria got news that CQ will be in the same class as Kelvin. Which one? I don't know. Oh yes, I met ShengQiang at the MRT Station while waiting for the rest to meowingly come. We chatted for quite a bit.  Hmmm. Well well well. I landed up in 04S22, along with CQ and Kelvin Lim! Two Kelvins in the same class again! HaHa! Even ducks ended up in the same class! O.O When we lined up, we saw there were fewer girls than boys. Hmmm. Behind us were three Malay guys. I don't like them. I don't know why. Their attitude leaves much to be desired, I guess. Like, just don't like their attitude lor. Reminds me too much of Faiz.   Hmmm. We went to the LT 4 for our Study Skills workshop. I feel was discriminated against when I was labelled incompetent because I put "prefers studying with radio/TV on" and "i have short concentration span...gets bored easily". Hello!! Baised! After the speech, we went down for break.  Hmm. Break was kinda short, but oh meow. We went up to the hall for some PE/CCA speech. Hmmm. How meowful! Mr Kwok (or Kok?) was kinda sacarstic to the late-comers. "Dignitaries". Heh. After that, was our Contact Time with our CT.  Hmmm. Our CT is Mr Tham. He's very very weird, yet funny at the same time. I don't whether to like him or not. Heh. CQ and Kelvin doesn't. He was their CT last time round. O.O Hmmm. He gave us our timetable and Pupil Profile Form. Ooo! What a fun form to fill up! Yes! Hmmm. He dismissed us for lunch.  Well, I found a dong gu meen in the canteen, and I am never eating that again. The mian and all is alright (the chicken is not shredded), but the dong gu is so toasted! Not soft de! Eeee! My dong gu!! Hmm. I was kinda worried for WQ (meow at Ji), because he didn't meet us for lunch. I thought he was robbed while in the toilet (well, it could happen), because his phone is off. Hmm. It turned out that he was chatting with his OGL and his phone's battery is low.   Well, after lunch, is our CIP. We are supposed to go to some blocks to clean up. Ayioh! the bus carrying our class, S25 and A05 was late!! Oh my god. Me and CQ met someone new, Jeric. Meow moo! Soon, after a long long wait, the bus came! Meow moo!   At the blocks, the clases were given assignements on how to clean up. S22 were told to clean up the dustbins. Wipe them clean, empty the trash and put in a new bag. Ayioh!! Me and CQ paired up with Jeric and another cat (I forgot his name, must ask tomorrow). We went around cleaning la. Wah! Our group was even taken photos of cleaning the dustbin. O.O I wonder if that will be published in the Hong Kah newsletter meow! We have to get back to take more bags several times. Mr Tham said "More bags means more marks for maths!" -.-" Ayioh!! We encountered two very smelly bins! We wanted to puke! Oh my meowing god! Our eyes were watery and I really wanted to vomit lor. That put us off cleaning bins. We returned to the checkpoint proclaiming duty's done. Hmm. We have to wait a while longer to be dismissed.  Darn! No free buses back to school. I wanted to go back to meet my OG to eat dinner together (actually, I called Lit Ping to see if he's going. If he is, it means the otgher two cats are going too, which means I am going too). Wah lao. My card like no more money le lor. Sigh! Me and CQ dropped off at CCK Interchange and I took 190 back to school while he waited for Gloria and Janet.   Hmmm. I met up with my OG at the canteen. We waited for about 30 minutes, till 4.30 for the rest to gather. Hmm. Steve was playing his guitar and some other OGL was singing. O.O Anyway, we took some photos before setting off to Bukit Timah Plaza's Pizza Hut, via 985.   HaHaHa! We are so engrossed chatting with each other that we completely missed our stop! The bus have to drive through a long expressway (BKE? I think). Wah lao. We went down and walked to the opposide side of the road (Joy's scared of heights) to the bus-stop in front of CJC. The irony! HaHa! Some cats in my OG met friends coming out of CJC. LP met a Hong Kong friend and they started chatting in Cantonese. How smooth they sound. HaHa. My Cantonese standard sucks, compared to these natives (I sometimes talk in Canto, then switch to EL/Chinese when I don't know how to express in Canto...Janet and Gloria noticed that on Tuesday). Soon, 985 came and we are on our journey back.  Hmm. We all finally met at the Pizza Hut. Hmm. We guys were sitting at a table, and the girls at another. All the guys talk about are girls lor. Everytime they see a pretty woman walking past (we are sitting next to the full-sized window), they go crazy. I was like very de sian. I didn't eat much, because I don't eat a lot of things there, except Hawaiian Pizza and drumsticks. Hmm. We ate from 6.30 till around 8.  HaHa. I have to go back early, so LP offered to send me to the bus-stop (because I don't know where it is and he lives round here). Woah! The whole OG (what remains of it anyway) tagged along. HaHa. so Paiseh. I need sending off. Thank guys!   I got onto bus 173, which took me to Clementi. From there, I took the MRT towards Admiralty. I have abolsutely no moolah left in my card, so I have to walk back. Due to experimentation, I've found out that walking home via 768 takes a shorter time than walking home via Gloria's route. Shorter by around 3 minutes la. I take around 2 minutes to walk from 768 to my home (WQ that time found it long and slow because he is walking very slowly, shuffle feet somemore. Even normal cats take 2 minutes!!). I came back home at around 9.07.  Hmm. I bathed, then came online. O.O Matt Rogers was voted out. Oh well. I thought Camille would be voted out, since she was second last last week. She's still is this week. Her future ain't looking bright if she doesn't pull her socks up.   Yes yes. Now CQ is waiting for this blog entry. Wait ar, I must mention something. Today, I was SMSing Amanda. I cannot tell what we said due to privacy issues, but we have a good talk. Yep. Hmm. Today Wendy sent me an SMS, saying she appreciates our friendship a lot ("I love you Kel" It brightened up my day. :D). Yes! Friends are always the best.  Okay. I ending le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo! Heya!!  Today was yet another great day! HaHaHa! Hmmm. Today I slept on the whole car journey to the MRT, so I don't know what happened. I guess we were quite slow, because I noticed we took a longer time to reach the MRT. Maybe we were travelling behind buses again.   Hmmm. Even ducks enjoyed Orientation today, even though the cats got dirty when crawling on mud. Ergh ergh ergh! Okie. Hmm. The first thing we do is the Telematch. O.O! Hmmmm. The games were quite fun overall, although we ended up dirtier than yesterday. Heh Heh. Hmm. I noticed that Yao Long looks very much like Lionel, with and without specs. A very creepy resemblance, if you ask me. Hmm.  After that, we were given a small break. The girls went off to bath. O.O After the break was the Mass Dance. Ayiah....again. So sian le leh. Hmm. Me and my partner dance quite wekll, but we always fumble during the Tango & Cha-Cha. Heh Heh. OH my goodness! WQ is totally funny! He was dancing with Hidayah (or Yu...dunnoe which twin came into PJ). Oh my god! he so sitff! He only moved here and there, without even clapping hands (when we are supposed to). His movement is very woody and stiffy....I really wanted to laugh out loud (okay, I did when I was recounting what I saw to the other cats at the choir audition). HAHAHAHA!  Hmmm. We went for lunch. O.O I ate the rice with many many dishes. Ayierr. I ate fried food! I am not supposed to do that. I chatted with the guys and Joy on my table lor. HaHa. Yao Long joked that we four are the 'gay clan'. Heh. We chatted lor. Woah! That Joy (our OGL, if you cats remember) very de suspicious leh. We just moved her plate (while she was away) to make room for Auntie to clean. She came back and ket insisting we did something to her plate. "Five guys all telling me the same thing and my plate is moved elsewhere! I am not stupid!" Heh Heh. :P What a suspicious Joy.  After that, the tribes of Olympus gathered together to bond lor. We have to play with other cats from other tribes. Hmmm. It was quite fun. I knew quite a lot of cats now. Heh Heh. After that, we proceeded to LT1 to make our mascots.   Hmm. I didn't contribute to mascot-making. I was mainly chatting with Yong Joo and the Indian girl (I still don't remember her name) who was from choir. Hmmm. Our OG went to take a group pic together. Hmm. At 3, we went to the Hall. At 3, it was time for choir audition. Me, Janet (who was from the same clan) and the Indian Girl went together la.  Hmm. We met Ji and Gloria there. Hmm. The conductor hasn't arrived yet. The TIC is Miss Elieen Toh (right?) and she's an ex-Riverside teacher. O.O Soon, a repeat senior named Astro came to talk to us for awhile. Hmmm.  Soon, the conductor, Mr Francis Liew (right? I think so), came in. O.O He's very motivational. Hmm. He reminds me of Miss Choo, if you ask me. His attitude lor, espeically with the one about competing in SYF, even the principal said there is not a need to ("I want to see how well we do against other colleges and we will work from that standing". That's what Miss Choo said to us last time). Hmm. He went around asking everyone. I was the first to be asked. He recongized Miss Choo, I think. I replied "Of course" to his question of me wanting to be in choir, and he said "Thank You!". I am beginning to like him. After a long motivational speech, he started auditioning. Actually, it wasn't really auditioning. He is just testing our voices and see where he would put us. Hmm. Meanwhile, the four of us were chatting with Miss Eileen. We were among the last to be tested.   Hmmm. He tested CQ first. Hmm. After CQ, it was me. I first informed him that I wasn't exactly pitch-perfect. He said "Okay. Now I know. Thank you!" and hit four low notes. I sang them la. Guess what he said? He said "Who says you sucks at pitching? You pitched perfectly ma! Go bash that person up!" I was like "Really?!!" Oh my god! He just made my day! Nobody told me I pitched perfectly before!! Although I fumbled on the other notes (because I was too happy and excited and kept laughing, my high voice came out). He said me and CQ needs to use our low voices, not our falsettos we normally use in RSS choir. YaY!! I got in! Hmm. He said only tested Gloria once and immediately accepted her. Good man! Janet got in too, but she doesn't want to be in choir. Hmmm.  After that we went back to the hall. The Orientation has ended! OO! I found out that Olympus is the Champion Clan! Yay!! Meow moo Championship! Hmmm. We met with our OG first, then we went off together. YH came to PJ to appeal! Good luck to him! Hmm. We went back together lor.  Midway,l Wendy smsed, said she has no moolah to eat. Since I got enough, I went down at Causeway Point and treated her to a MacDonalds Meal. Hmmm. We chatted and chatted. I also went up to look at that Gavin, her new manager. Hmm. I caught him. Wendy says I was lucky to catch sight of him. Hmm. He is somewhere between handsome and cute, I'd say. He scares me lor. I was helping Wendy tear strings ma, and he said something about me wanting to work here or what. I thought he was being sarcarstic, Wendy says he tries too hard to fit in. Her colleague, Su, later come and tell us that he cried today. O.O Wild rumors are spectaculating that he broke off the engagement with his China bride. I thought he was one of the cats who took a China bride through an agency and said "Woah? He so desperate ar?" and that sent Wendy and Su to laughter. Ohhh...Wendy said he knew the girlfriend for a long time, so OOO. I went down to buy TNP for Wend, then I returned home lor. Woah...it was almost 8 when I came back.  After bathing, I ate my dinner while being online. Hmmm. Now I am watching AI. Hmmm. Tomorrow the class list's gonna come out, and I am very nervous bout that.   Ahh well. I think I better end this blog. Woah, so long ar! Okay, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Meow moo meow!!  Ahhh! Today was meowingly fun! Okie...lemme start from the beginning. Hmm. Today, we travelled behind a bus...again. So SLOW! Ayioh! Anyhoo, I reached there early. Maybe that's because I went out early today.  Hmm. Today in my OG, I made new friends. Heh Heh. If Lit Ping hasn't talked to me first (ask to see my form), I wouldn't have hanged out with him, Yong Joo and Yao Long. Heh Heh. I really liked this group more. Maybe because last time I was forever hanging out with MingYao only, I didn't enjoy myself with the group. This time, I bonded with mah group. O.O What a meowing time.  Hmm. The first activity for our clan (Olympus) is mass dance. O.O Hmm. This time my partner is great. I mean, as in not as worse as the pervious cats. HaHa. We laughed a lot at each other's mistakes. Heh Heh. Anyhoo, we were given a break.  Heh Heh. The four of us stuck together each time. Heh. Anyhoo, we brought uniforms during our break and resulted in us being late to the tribe meeting. HeH HeH.   OO! The games were played next. Hmm. Our tribe lost in every game sia! So sway! Anyway, I had a great time. Yeah. Heh Heh. Unexpected wor. I usually don't like Orientation games. O.O Hmm. After games, we went for lunch.   HaHa. A lot of cats went off leh, and only left we four guys and some girls. After lunch, we measured height and weight. Wel, I grew by 1am and 0.6kg. That's horrible! After measurements were done, we went for Clan Time.   Clan Time was meowing. Hmmm. We played more games. Ayioh!! I lost in a game you know! As a forfeit, I have to belly-dance. So embarassing!!! HaHaHa!! Even ducks meowed. After games, there was the school tour. O.O Even the shcool tour is meowing!   Hmm. After touring the school, we went back to the hall to sing some songs. Ayioh...sor boring. Hmmm. When we left, I forgot to say goodbye to mah group. Oh well.   Hmm. Lit Ping is from HK. Hmm. I couldn't tell at first, until Joy asked. Hmm. I wonder if he knows how to speak Cantonese. Must ask tomorrow. Hmm. Yes. I went home with WQ, CQ, Janet and Gloria. Me and the two girls got off at Admiralty and walked to 768. I met my Dad there and ate dinner.   Hmm. I came back, bathed and came online. Oh! I went off to watch TV. Oh Carol is aboslutely tuching today! Oh my god...Allan is so sweet! He proposed to Carol! Oh my god...the perfect ending! So touching!  Hmm. I think I am ending this. Sorry for sounding really rushed, but I am getting distracted by a really good Snape fic. O.O Yes! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Ooo! Meow mooo!!  Hmm. Today is the start of the schooling year! Oh my god! I am so dman beat! Wake up so early...ergh!! Even ducks feel sleepy. Hmm. I ate my breakfast and Dad took me there. Woah..I hate driving behind buses. They are so freaking slow! The cars on the other lanes are zomming by us. So meowful! I reached CCK station just nice. Okay. Maybe 1-2 minutes late. Oh well.  Hmm. A large group of Riversidians were there. Hmmm. Soon, we set off towards PJ lor. Hmm. When reaching school, PY came to tell us our group. Ayiah! Her information is WRONG! I went into OG18, not 21. Heh Heh.  Ahh well. My OGLs are Steve and Joy, both graduated cats. Anyhoo, there are a lot of girls in my OG, quite a few guys wor. Hmm. Ayioh. Today was kinda boring. There are much more options on me form, so that's good. That principal, Mr Quek, is terribly funny. Actually, funny as in lame. He was saying that there are more girls than boys in PJ, so not every girl will get a boyfriend. -.-" Anyway, this is just like the first day of the Orientation 1. Utterly boring.  Hmm. At 11, we were releashed. I went with my OG, then met up with CQ and gang at the uniform stall. Yeah. I brought 2 sets of shirt+pants, plus a mandatory tie. It costs $77 total. Woah...I only brought $80, just nice wor. Heh Heh. I tried to escape from my OG, but decided not to. Hmmm. The clan got together to ice-break (quite unsuccessfully. Hmmm. My group is quite nice... heh heh. Yes. Good good.   Hmm. The guys left for Lot 1 first, so I went there alone. I met them at Mac, then I ate my lunch lor. Hmmm. Yes. When we were about to take the MRT, we saw CK and gang. Hmm. They suggested going to Causeway Point's 6-floor to chat. O.O  Ayioh! CQ now wants to go Chem/Phy! Oh my lord! So many cats want to go Chem/Phy now! Yes! After giving it serious thoughts, I decided on choosing Phy/Chem too. Hmm. Well, I am thinking of majoring in Psychology, and that doens't need any requirements. I need to get a good pass to enter university. Well, they said Phy was easier to score than Bio. Meow moo. So meow moo!!   Hmm. We stayed there for awhile, then while we went down, we met SL and WT. O.O! HaHa. We all accompanied her to eat BK. Yes! We chatted more! Hmmmmm. After that, they went to walk around Causeway. Hmm. My parents came to fetch moi back, so I left early.  Coming home, I bathed, came online, then went to eat dinner. Ayioh!!!

      Heya! Quack meow!  Heh Heh Heh. Today, something meowingly funny happened. Okay. I have to backtrack a little. Hmm. See. A few days ago, CQ owed me $1.50. I really need the moolah to save up, so I keep pressing him to return ( some  people still owe me $3 for MONTHS!). He said he can't spare me moolah. That time, I was feeling particularly bored and bo liao, I put myself up for a dare. I said he won't return me the $1.50 if I tell WQ I liked him. Well, I know I wouldn't want to, because I don't like him and he might take the joke seriously and cut off our friendship. Then, today early morning after GB, CQ dared me la. I refused profusely, but he said WQ could reveal who he likes. Now, since he put it that way, I am up for the challenge. $1.50 is so worth it for knowing who is WQ's crush. Therefore, I made up this cock-and-bull story about me having feelings for him since last year...blah blah blah. HaHa. He is so slow! He asked "who is 'you'?"! Ayioh! "You" means him lor! Then, he refused to believe it, saying it is lame, unbelievable and is a joke. Hmm. Me and CQ decided to own up and say it is indeed a joke. Well, I didn't get the info I wanted. Wasted my efforts! Heh Heh Heh!   Hmmm. After that, me and Wendy SMSed each other for an hour (it was 1am). HaHa. We chatted about her problem at work. Heh. I gave some creative suggestions. O.O! I wonder how it went. Must sms her later. Yes! After that, I fell asleep lor.  Hmm. I woke up at 8 and took a 45-minute bath. Uhm hmm. After that, I went to watch the TV while reading newspapers. Mother came back at 9.30, bringing back breakfast (duck porridge). Hmm, at 10, I went online and chatted with a few cats. Hmm. At 11, I went away to watch HZGG and eat lunch. HZGG is terribly touching... I teared at a few scenes. Yes!   After HZGG, I went online for awhile, then was off to watch a Channel 8 documentary (Shu Li Shu Qu) and my recorded Pokemon show yesterday. Even Larvitar meowed!! So cute! After that, I went back to chat with cats like CQ, XC and Snapeluva. Hmm. We chatted till 4.30, when Unbeatables is showing. At 5, my brother's friend came here.   I went down to buy dinner. Oh my god. I am so lucky! I came home early. After some more minutes, it started pouring heavily. Phew! I ate my dinner while watching Unbeatables. At 6.30, I went to bath and here I am online. Hmm. I fell asleep just now. So tired now. *Yawns*  Oh well. Tomorrow is the start of the school. Today ends my 4-months holidays. Oh well. TaTa to freedom!  Ahh well. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow.

      Heya! Meow moo!  Hmmm. Today morning was kinda rushing. Yeah. Hmm. I woke up at 8.30 and bathed for about an hour. O.O I came online and the first thing CQ told me is that the results are out. Guess what? I got into PJ! YAY!! HaHa! A lot of cats also! CQ for one. Hmm. WQ came online, and deliberately delayed his checking. Ergh! Even CQ washed his hands off WQ!  After that and breakfast, we went down to cut hair. Sigh. My hair is badly multilated. Even ducks are appalled at hairs being sniped by catty cats-ducks! Hmm. After that, I went back home to wash mah hair. You can't expect me to go out with bits of hairs stuck in my head! I need to shampoo twice to get rid of the itsy-bitsy hairlets. After washing, I went out to meet mah friends at the basketball court near WQ's house. Well, I was late. I told them I am gonna be late anyway, so meow moo.  Hmmm. That WQ lied to me, said he's going to NYP's Business course. Of course, I didn't really believe him in the first place. I got a gut feeling he's lying. How? I dunnoe. Probably by the others' reaction, and his eyes. I can see it. Anyways, we played some game. KS, TZ, ChiYuan and ChenHui came. Hmm. We played some game, stopping to rest at 12.15 and played some more lor.  We stopped at 1. Hmm. We sat down to talk for awhile. CQ, Joyce and Gloria went home. She said "I go home and eat la. Everytime stay back to wait for Kelvin, but always in the end, didn't go home with him". I was like "What?". I never expected her to to go home with me. I never wanted her to anyway. She's free to go home anytime. I never forced her to stay with me anyway. Sigh. This is getting dangerous! Anyway, the rest of us took the bus to Causeway Point to eat lunch.  Yeah. Me, WQ, PY, HM, TZ, KS, CY and CH went to eat lor. I paid WQ back 1 moolah. Heh Heh. Anyway, I ended up telling PY and HM things. That WQ la. Go and bring up that topic. Nothing better to talk. Hm. WQ's observations were really that accurate lor. I wonder why others didn't see it, they were obvious. I don't mean  all  his observations. Most of them anyway.   After lunch, we went to play pool. Yes. Thrice in a row. HaHa. TZ treated us all, so thankies to him. Hmmm. Me and WQ played against PY and HM. Hmmm. Soon, we changed partners la. Ayiah. HM left early lor. We stopped playing at 4:30.  I walked to Marsiling with TX, KS, WQ and PY. We sent WQ off first, after that I took the MRT and 913 bus back. I came home, bathed, ate dinner and watched TV and was online ever since I finished bathing. HaHa. I am now listening to my playlist. Back Here by BBMak is playing. "There's a feeling I want you to know, you are the one that I can't let you go" Very romantic!  Even ducks must meow! I think I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

I think my boils are caused by plugged sweat glands. Yeah. Ayiah. Dad fetched us at 8.  Hmm. We went to eat kueh chap as breakfast. After eating breakfast, we went to the doctor's. Hmm. Said the same old things, nhothing new. Must not eat seafood, must not eat peanuts, must not eat deep-fried foods. Sigh!! Hmmm. After getting the medicine, Father drove us to the nearest POSBank. Yeah. I have to withdraw moolah from mah account to eat Seoul Garden later. I also took money out to return KS and TZ. Yeah lor. After that, Father drove us home. Hmm. I ended up taking the 913 bus there.  Hmm.I met CQ and KS there. We were early, so we went to walk around. We really walked around aimlessly, killing time. At 10.50+, WQ met us and we went tout to wait for the others. Gloria came, followed by SL, Joyce and PY. Hmmm. We waited for the Seoul Garden to open. Hmm.   Soon, it opened. Each of us have to pay 13 bucks. Hmmm. Yes. Oh well. What can I say about Seoul Garden? We ate our fill? HM joined us later. Anyway, I ate mostly seafood. Which is clams (harms). Heh Heh. Disease/cancer my foot! I am eating harms and nobody's ain't stopping moi. Anyway, I stopped eating after I find them too salty. Yeah. It happens. Oh well. I also ate some meat. I find the chicken Bou-something very spicy. Hot hot!!   Hmm. After Seoul Garden, we decided to go play pool. O.O I got lotsa moolah, so can play all we want. HaHa. I even treated CQ, because he don't have money left. Even the ducks meowed at pool for 2 hours! Yes! We played from 2.30 to 4something. Meow moo meow!!  After that, the ducks are going home. I wanted to walk to Marsiling, actually, take 911 bus to meet Mother. AHHHHHH!!! MY PLANS ARE SPOILT!! Gloria tagged along..... ergh!!!!! We (me, CQ, WQ, Gloria, Joyce and PY) went to a park and started chatting. Hmm. We mostly reminised about olde times. After that, we walked home. Hmm. I sent WQ off home. Heh. There are several reaons for me doing so, but I ain't gonna explain here. Hmmm. On the way back home, me and Wendy chatted. Heh. A funny incident happened, but I can't and wouldn't elaborate. So embarassing!! Even ducks meow!  Hmm. I came home, bathed and ate dinner (noodles). Hmm. Tada! I am here. Tomorrow's the results of my posting. Ergh. I am so worried. Meow mooo mooo moooo!!! I want to get into Pioneer Junior College! MEOW MOO!!  Okay. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Meow moo meow!  Hmm. Today I woke up at 8.25 and took a 55 minutes bath. You must be wondering why I know the precise time. Well, I always look at the kitchen clock when going in and out of the bathroom. Heh. After bathing, I came online for awhile, then went to eat chee cheong fun. After eating breakfast, I went out to take the 911 bus to the basketball court.  I met CQ there, then followed by KS. After a while, WQ came down. Hmm. YC and her cousin came, then Gloria and HL. As the court was full, we decided to go to the 350+ court to play. Hmm. I was reading my book when walking. Gloria and YC was terribly naggy. Hello lor! I have mastered the art of reading while walking. I have not and will not meet any accidents. Okay. Enough bitching. We reached the court after a long walk and me being safe and sound.   Hmm. We meowed at the game lor. Joyce and PY came and we meowed some more. What am I supposed to say about the game? After playing for some time, we are dead tired. Yeah. Oh well. At 1, YC and her cousin went back. We went to Causeway Point. Walk there lor, what else? Me and CQ talked some more lor. Yes. Meowingly meow meowed us. We walked all the way to Causeway Point.   Hmm. We went to McDonalds to eat lunch. Hmm. During some point, they suggested going to my house to watch VCDs. Ayioh...I don't want so many cats coming. No space!! Gloria got terribly annoying by repeating and repeating "Go your house leh!". I almost lost my appetite for lunch. Okay. I shouldn't be so evil. I am just terribly annoyed, that's all.   After that, we went to play pool. Joyce didn't bring her EZ-Link Card, so she has to go home and take. We met TZ there too. We decided to play two 9-ft tables. Hmmm. We played. I teamed with WQ for most of the time. Even though we didn't win everytime, we still won some games. Hmm. WQ is terribly jue. Yes. Oh well. Hmmm. We played for a long time. Sigh. In the end, each table have to pay $20, amounting to $5 each cat. Sigh. I have no moolah. That WQ, even though he has a lot of money, wouldn't help me pay first. He said "I need to buy the FM Tuner". Ohh...... So the FM Tuner is more important than me la. Okay. Next time, I won't ask him for financial help le. Obviously, gadgets are much more sought-after and valuable than friends. Sigh. I think I am terribly selfish. I need to think in his stance. He really need that FM Tuner and I can't go running to him for help everytime! In the end, TZ said I don't have to pay. Nonsense! I will pay him back (or at least, via KS) tomorrow. Yeah. Meow moo.  After that, we went home lor. 964 bus came first, so I left without Gloria. Hmm. I reached home, bathed and went online. Yeah. I ate my dinner while chatting with CQ. Hmmm. Sigh. I am at a mess, frankly speaking. Even ducks finished dinner at 7.  Hmmm. Right now I am chatting with XC and WQ, who are not really online. Later I am watching AI and waiting for Wendy to come online. Yeah.   So, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Okay! Meow moo meow!! Even ducks are meowing today!  Hmm. Today I woke up as usual. Hmmm. After bathing, I went down to buy 8 Days. Great as usual, the ducks were meowing. Mother brought back chee cheong fun and after eating, I went online to play for awhile, then went out.  HaHa. I am meeting WQ and CQ today. WQ wants to buy mp3 player, so me and CQ accompanied him. Hmm. We went to eat lunch at LJS. Yeah. I have to buy for WQ again. Even CQ meowed at the silliness. Oh yes. Hmm. The counter person tried to trick us again, but I know!! YES!! I know! I didn't get tricked!   After eating lunch, we took the train towards City Hall. I am still reading Rice Bowl. Hmm. I found out I didn't really like Marie after all. She is too rebellious for my taste. Well, kinda. Yeah, too Christian too. (I know, as a Witch/Wiccan, I am not supposed to discriminate other religions. I am just uncomfortable with the story being based on Christianity...) Her plans' synopsis goes like this: "It will provide a framework for meaningful Christian involvement in the context of economic oppression in Singapore". Yes. I am very uncomfortable with that. I strongly believe in the separation of church and state (that came from Thomas Jefferson...or is it? I heard it in the MNI board). Ao meow moo!  Okay. We arrived there and while walking to Funan, was bombarded with a girl selling sme ice-cream vouchers. HaHa. I said I have no moolah, so I was left alone. In the end, WQ brought one. Wow.   Hmm. WQ went around surveying Mp3 Players. He wasn't really statisfied with the mp3s players. We soon came to Challenger. Wow!! I saw the AI game and I want it!! HaHa! I have absolutely no moolah at all, so I have to lend from KWQ the cat. Heh Heh. I owe him $18 bucks now. Meow moo meow! After that, he went to buy a Nomad MuVo (having 4GB storage) costing $400+. He actually asked the salesman the disadvantages of the MuVo player! The salesman was left in a fluster and me and CQ were laughing. Oh my god! I don't think any salesman would know the disadvantage of their product. At least must compare with another product ma! Heh Heh!  Hmm. After that, WQ suggested to go Suntec City. Okay, sure. We rushed to take the shuttle service to Suntec. Hmm. That girl stopped us again. I pointed out that she sold a ticket to WQ and she said "Oh! No wonder I found you guys so familiar!" What a silly cat. Heh Heh. Okie. We took the bus there.  Hmm. We went to Carrefour again. HaHa. Nothing much to see, so we went to shop around lor. After a while of shopping (mainly, going into a video store and looking at VCDs, or for me, looking at the current VCD playing in Cantonese), we wanted to go back home. WQ wanted to come to my house, but in the end didn't. Okay. We walked all the way to the Esplanade (nad!!! es-pla-nad, not nade! We must follow the French pronunciation! This is a French word after all!) to take the 960 bus.  I read Rice Bowl, but it got too boring for me. I wanna sleep for awhile. Heh Heh. CQ alighted at Marsiling and WQ and I alighted at the next stop. I sent him back home and I walked to Woodlands Interchange, taking 964 back.  Hmm. I went back, bathed and played my AI game. O.O! HaHaHa! What a fun game! I somehow won the game! YaY! Even the ducks sang and danced to "I Will Survive"! Heh Heh. After playing, I went to GunBound with XC, WQ and CQ for awhile, before going off to dinner.  Yeah, I went to 768 to eat fried rice, then returned home and tada, I am here. Hmmm. I think my day can be summarized as fun. Yeah. I think. Heh.   Anyhoo, Professor Sun's TTM is giving me a major headache! HaHaHa! Seriously, it is so darn difficult. I will scour the text again to get sense out of it. Hmm. Yes!! Meow meow!!  Okay. I gotta end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Heya! Today was meowfully meowing! Meow meow!  Okie. I woke up at 8.15 to a deary cloudy morning. After bathing for an hour, I went online for awhile. Yeah. After that, I went offline to eat chee cheong fun. Hmm. After that, I went to the basketball court near WQ's house early.  I want to spend some quality time reading mah book.    Yeah. I reached there around 10.30. I brought along Rice Bowl, by Christine Lim. I love the protangonist. She reminds me of me. Her great attitude, her thinking. Almost like mine. Non-conventional, controlversial. Yeah. Her boyfriend is the people I don't really like. Those people who accept everything the government tell them, who is so prim and proper. I quote you one thing he said "Singapore is a small nation. We can't afford defiance, rebellion and constant questioning of government policies." NONSENSE!! You mean to tell me to accept what the government said blindly and unquestioning like obedient little dogs? Pui! Never in my life! Of course, Marie is very wise to break up with him. Meow moo!!  Okay. Moo meow! KS, CQ and WQ came, followed shortly by Gloria. Okay. The court was full at first, but after waiting, it was emptied of players. We meowed at the court. The team formation of me, CQ and KS proved too formidable, so we decided to play ABC till Joyce came. Hmm. I made great improverments in ABC! Woo hoo! I can "cross the river" le! Such a miracle! Joyce came and we played ABC again! Meow moo meow!! After that, we played and played till 1.  Yeah. At 1, we went to Causeway Point to eat lunch. Hmm. We went to McDonalds to eat. Yes! Even ducks meow! Even the cat ate the McNuggets Meal. Yes! After that, they wanted to go watch movie. Hmm. WQ suggested After School, I suggested Butterfly Effect and Joyce wanted Big Fish. Hmm. After a lot of deliberation and some compromising, we agreed on Butterfly Effect.  It was not long waiting, as we brought the tiks to a show 15 minutes later. Not many cats are watching it, so we meowed a lot of tiks. Yes! We went in and sat down. Oh yes!! They are showing Harry Potter's trailer!! POA's trailer is so nice, even though I have it in my computer. Heh Heh! Okay. Onto the movie. The Chaos Theory is so true. Every little actions can affect the future dramatically. I didn't catch onto the story until like the middle of the show, when I finally understood how he use his power to change his life. Wow! A great movie! At the end, WQ said he wanted Ashton's power (Ashton Kutcher plays Evan...great actor!). Hmmm. It would be cool yeah, but like what Evan's father said, it is too dangerous. Yes!!   After that, we walked down. Hmmm. I wanna accompany WQ wait for his brother, so Gloria walked back with CQ and Joyce. Yes, me, KS, WQ and TZ (who joined KS to accompany WQ)n walked around till WQ's brother came. Hmm. I saw Wendy walking with KL. I waved hello. However, my eyebrows were raised high and eyes wide open. Yeah. After his brother and father came, I went home lor.  I went home, bathed, came online (left computer on) and ate dinner. HaHa. I was quite slow today, because I was reading Rice Bowl. After dinner, I surfed some Internet and went to watch my show. I am online now, tada!  Okay. What was I about to write? Oh yes. HAHAHA! Today, Ji messaged "Am I good to you? HaHa!" When I was reading that, I laughed out real loud, and WQ called me siao. It placed a big smile on my face. I can't say why CQ messaged that, but meow moo! CQ one of my most treasured friends. He is always there for me...and I appreciate that a lot. Hmm. He has very different perspective on the issue, unlike Amanda and Wendy. What he said made a lot of sense too. Yeah...so there I am. Stuck in a knot of what to do next. Heh Heh. His words gave me something to think about. HaHa! :D  Hmmm. Oh yes. Today, I heard something I thought would never be played out in radio. Jamie read a message from a guy to another guy "I love you". She commented "I know you will find it strange that a guy telling another guy 'I love you', but I don't think I am supposed to comment on that, so I won't." The song dedication is "Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)" by Eamon. Yeah, I find it very strange. Why would someone dedicate Fuck It to someone they love? I would dedicate songs like "Truly Madly Deeply" or "One Love" or "You Make Me Wanna". Hmmm!!   Okay. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

If I wasn't infringing copyright laws, I would post some of the text here. Oh well. (Oh my my. I completely digressed. Did I? Maybe.... Hmm!)  After lunch, I went online to play GunBound with WQ. We played from 1 something till 3. I was quite sian by of playing so many meowing games. Yes! I went online to chat with XC and WQ came to chat too.

Meow meow meow. Actually, as I am writing this, all of them are away. Sigh. They Online=Not Being Online. Even the lonely cat cries of boredom. Yes!!   Okay. Yay! Mother made han yang tao fu. I dunnoe the English translation, but it's a very nice desert!! Yes!! Hmmm! Even ducks meow!  Okay. I gotta end this blog entry le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! What a meowing day! Meow moo!  Hmmm. Today was rushing, at least in the morning. I woek up at 8, bathed till 8.45 and came online for a bit, because I won't be able to later on. I logged off at 9 to watch Digimon and meow at my breakfast. Hmmm. At 10, I came online, because they are showing the Pokemon Special, which I watched already.  Anyway, what a surprise! Janet called and told me all the cats are at RSS already (except Janet, me, WQ and CQ). AHHH! CQ said he will go with his family...so I am meeting WQ at 11.30. Very extremely rushing!  At the 913 busstop, I saw KentKent and we decided to go to meet WQ. Okie...we met WQ, who was rushing to catch the 962 bus. Heh Heh. I read my book in the bus. How meowful! When we are approaching the school, we can see it's very busy! Surprise surprise! (OH OH!! Parent Trap is showing! My favorite movie of all times!!)  Hmmm. It was quite crowded, yes. Very. We went to find SL and gang in the canteen. Hmm. Me and WQ went to walk around. Honestly speaking, I wasn't really awed by what I saw. Nothing really excites me. Well, 'cept for the Huanted House. Nobody wants to go in there, so didn't go in the end lor.   Janet and YC came, and all of us decided to walk around to spend our coupons. Hmm. There wasn't much to spend on. Hmm. Me and WQ went to the canteen. We brought drinks (watermelon juice, which is very little) for $3. Then, WQ brought two chicken wings and we found a table to eat. They were so piping hot WQ couldn't hold them for long. OOO!   SL and PY joined us after a short while. Hmm. I brought fries to share with the three cats. Even ducks ate fries! Yes!! Hmmm. More cats joined us. One of them is KH. I am not exactly KH-tolerant. Hmmmm..  We went to walk around some more lor. HaHa. We brought fishballs from Hildir's stall. Yes yes. Hmmm. After which, we all decided to go play pool. Hmm. With KH around. Hmp. We took 962 to Causeway Point. Yes. Even ducks are meowing when I read my book. I was squished to meowing death by a woman who refused to move even when there's space!!! MEOW MOO MEOW!!  Okay. They played pool. Me and WQ didn't. I read my book. Yes! Even books are fantastic. Meow moo meow. They played for about 2 hours there. Brrr! I feel so cold! Ducks are meowing out of lousy music! Yes yes.  After that, we went to Mac to eat dinner. Luckily KH didn't follow us. Anyway, something terrible happened. You see ar....I got to order 3 sets of McNuggets Meal and HL ordered a regular Coke. Okay. Somehow, the counter staff didn't compute my order for another Coke. HL drank my share of Coke... I got kinda annoyed. However, I was just about to buy another one when THAT Gloria snatched away the $2 note forcefully from me and said "I go buy...gimme!". I was fuming mad and I glared after her. I HATE it when people does that to me. I CAN buy for myself de lor. It's like her saying I am very incompetent at doing these sort of things. Come on lor. I was only mildly annoyed at HL. She doesn't have to show that she's very good at solving problems. I HATE people doing that. ! I sat down and growled. HL thought I was angry at her. WQ knew otherwise. (Heh Heh) HL, nope, I am not angry at you. Word of advice: DON'T EVER DO THAT TO ME. Finally. I let my anger out. I feel so shuang. I am sick of being nice. Releashing your anger is a very good thing after all.  Okay. After that, we went home. Me, KK, Janet and Gloria walked home. We passed through blocks. Hm. I came home to find my brother eating and his friend using his computer to play games. Oh i meow! Mother has gone to work, even though today was supposed to be her off day. Hmm. Must ask what happened later. Meowing moo!     I bathed, then came online. I was majorly distracted by The Parents Trap showing on Channel 5!! My favorite movie of all times! How meowful! Even after watching a lot of times (I got the VCD), it still manage to touch me! The storyline's beautiful! Meow moo meow!!  Okay. I think I end this blog le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow!!   Okie. Today morning was mooful. Hmm. I woke up at 8.30 to a deary morning. I bathed, and came online lor. I chatted with WQ the ducky cat. I ate duck porridge for breakfast, then watched meowing cartoons to meow. Yes. Even Pokemons meowed at Unown! At 11, I went offline and started preparing to go out.  Hmm. I met Gloria and HL at 11.15 at the bus-meowing-stop and we took the bus to the basketball court near WQ's place. Hmm. I saw CQ, KS, PY and GaoLuan there (GL was there? O.O). HaHa. I brought the gas pump to pump CQ's basketball. Hmmm. By the way, I didn't say I need people to carry. It was heavy, but I can deal with it. Hmp. Oh yes, WQ visited us before going to the IT Show. Hmmm. Coolies.  We started playing lor. Hmm. GL was counting the score. We were kinda uneasy with that, because we don't even play that seriously. Hmm. Whatever lor. After a while, we took a break. The rest went to buy water, while me and CQ stayed behind to meow. We meowed and meowed and meowed. Ergh. Things were left untold. Yes!! Even ducks mooed. They came back and we played some more. We played till 2 something lor. Yes yes.  Okay. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat lor. KS changed clothes, Joyce brought some medicine thingy, KS brought newspaper. We met GL and went up to the foodcourt to eat. We chose the long table thingy and I sat at the head, so I appointed myself zhu xi (CEO). Yes! Even the zhu xi meowed. I ate mian feng guo. Even the zhu xi was impreched at the end of the day because he didn't treat his staff to lunch and pool. How meowful is that? Very!  Yep. We went pooling. We met ThongZhen, John and Kenny there. Hmm. We played pool!! O.O! WQ joined us later. Apparently, he has a bad experience at the IT Show. I think it has something to do with not subscribing to StarHub's broadband service. Oh well. He refused to tell me anything though. Meow moo meow! We played and meowed till 4 something.  Hmmm. After that, the rest went home while me, Joyce, WQ and KS went to the library. Joyce wanted to borrow book, and since I am bookless at the moment, I might as well borrow some. Even ducks borrowed three books. I hope to own the "Meet Me On The QE2" someday! A classic!  After that, we went to the pasar malam, only for a short while though. We decided to go back. Hmm. I accompanied WQ, Joyce and KS to take 911. HaHa. I got slapped for telling WQ it is bad luck to walk besides a funeral. HAHAHAHA! You!! I got down at the next stop with Joyce and walked to her house. We meowed a lot of things. Anyway, I took the train home and then took 913 home. HaHa. Wastage of moolah. :P I like wasting moolah! :D  Coming back, I bathed, went online for awhile, then went off to eat and meowed at my show. Even the show is meowful!!! Yes! After eating, I came back online. Meow moo!! Where are the cats!! We are supposed to discuss the time of meeting tomorrow! As meowing ducks, they should be punctual!  Okay. I think I end off this blog. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! Ya, I am blogging early. Later at night, I will be busy watching TV with only a 30-minute break, so no time to meow at blogs.  Oh yes, today....  Fuck. Consider today's blog entry non-existant. I have totally NO mood to blog. I feel terribly lousy at the moment. I can't convey my emotions properly.....  Actually, I wanna pour out what's inside me.... I just...can't find the right words. Okay okay...I say what's troubling me. You see ar...on the train back to Woodlands, I suffered incessant teasing from WQ.   HA! You all think I let that get to my head. Yeah...I am weak. I can't take insults... Words do hurt. A lot. I don't really blame WQ. You see, I was the one who started this lor. I called him names first, and his need to "shoot back" caused all that insulting. Yeah....can say I am huogai la. Stil...the words do hurt a lot. I've let all that get into my head.... I think I know what will be Amanda's and Wendy's reaction. They will shake their heads and go "you are hopeless". Or something along that line. Oh well.   See ya tomorrow. Bye blog.

      Hey hey! Meow moo meow!  Hmm. You might have noticed that the past two days, I had weird dreams. Hmm. I had no weird dreams today. Even if I did, I didn't remember. Hmm. I woke up at 8.30, bathed and meowed online. Mother went to buy breakfast. Oh yes, I called WQ up. If I never called him up, I would be stuck there for hours! Hmm. I ate chee cheong fun, and then meowed online. At 10+, I went off to prepare to go out.  Yeah. I reached Woodlands Interchange, followed by WQ. We are going to this IT Fair at Suntec City. We ate lunch at LJS first. Even ducks meowed at LJS! Okay okay. After meowing and mooing at Combo 1, we took the train to City Hall. HaHa. This time, we didn't listen to the Discman. We talked and talked. I forgot what we talked about, but we meowed. :P  Okay. We alighted at City Hall and walked the long long walkway towards Suntec. Hmm. We have to ride up lotsa escalators to go up there. There were a lot of cats trying to give us pampleths and brochures. Ayioh...meowingly meow meow!  That IT Fair was kinda crowded, but walkable. Hmm. WQ's friend is working there, s we are paying him a visit later. WQ's coming there to look at new PC models. Hmmm. We walked round and round, WQ grabbed pamphlets off counters. HaHa. Hmm. When we were about to leave, we were watching cats play Need For Speed Underground (winner wins something big). HaHa. All the players are so lousy. Even we can win them! As XC would say: "Disgrace to human beings!". HaHa. Actually, WQ can win them better than I do. He's expert at this game man! Even ducks meow!   Okay. We left the thing and went to Carrefour lor. Hmm. I listened to Britney's CD and meowed at it. We walked around...walk walk walk. Then, we decided to go back to the MRT le. My legs were super tired.   On the way to the MRT, we went into MPH. HaHa. We were kinda engrossed into the books. Actually, WQ was reading the magazines while I was reading New Age books. After meowing and mooing at MPH, we went home lor. HaHa. Hmmm. On the way home, I learned lotsa things. If you count them reliable, that is. Heh. Even ducks meowed. I wanted to visit Wendy, but she's stock-taking, so cannot go disturb her. For the last time, Koo Wen Qiang, I don't like Wendy. Neither CQ, Amanda or Joyce. So there.   I came home, bathed and meowed online. Professor Snapeluva gave us a word puzzle! It is bascially find words out of "Shrivelfig". HaHa. I found 56 words, which means I can get 5 Galleons. YaY!   We went for dinner at 6+. Ayioh. At my kueh chap, they put those onions thingys!! ERGH!!! They said "Ayiah...make the soup more nice". I made a face. Next time, I should say "I am allegric to onions". See if they dare to put or not. Meow moo meow!!     I came back and meowingly came online. Tomorrow, me and WQ are going to the Creative Warehouse Sale. Hmm. The cats say they are going to the SHE show tomorrow. Frankly speaking, I don't really feel like going. It's up to WQ tomorrow lor, see if he wanna go after the sale. Hmm. Yeah. Up to WQ meowing cat. Yes.   Okay. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow meow meow.  Hmmm. I dreamt another weird dream today. Well. Joyce was turned into a monster, and there was me, WQ and XC fighting her, FFX-style. Yeah. HaHa. Anopter weird dream. In that dream, I received a very loud message. It was very clear, deepa dn set. It seems like I have been told the truth. I could have been wrong, but this message is much more clearer than the dream itself. I even found myself muttering it.... Then I woke up la. Even ducks meowed.  Okay. I bathed then went downstairs to buy 8 Days. I was supposed to go 883 with Mother today, because I woke up late, my Mother went herself. Meow! Even 8 Days are meowing and mooing at the cats and ducks of the Meowing Land. I ate chee cheong fun, then went online somemore. I also went down (again) to buy a bowl noodle for myself. Long time never eat that le.   Hmm. Amanda came online, followed by WQ. Amanda's so sweet and touching. Thanks so much for caring! Lova ya too! Wendy too, you are a dear. No no people. Don't get mistaken. They are my very very dear close friends. Meow! :P Okie. Meow mooo. I ate my lunch, and stayed online till 2+. I prepared to go play badminton.  Ayioh!! How meowful!! CQ called me and tell me that the rest are gonna be meowingly late! Meow moo! I was there waiting for ducks and cats to come. I called WQ, buit he ain't coming. Soon, CQ came at 3.20+. How meowful!  We booked the court first. Hmm. At 3.45, we started playing lor. Play play play. The rest (Joyce, HL and Gloira) joined us later. We meowed more. HL's hand turned black from using my racket and I developed a blister on my middle finger. Ergh! We then sat down and meowed. I told Ji about my dream about me and him. I find Gloria very chao. No offense to her, but she interrupts my account with her own comments, which I don't find very nice. As a Wiccan, I was offended being called a "demon"! Destroyed the momentum! We talked some more, and at 6, we went home.   Hmm. We walked towards Marsiling MRT, where we met WQ's mother. We exchanged a few greetings and went on our way. Hmm. I took the train and alighted at Woodlands. I have no mood to walk back home. So tired and hungry! Meow moo!  I reached home, bathed, ate and came online meowingly. Hmmm. Meow meow!   Okay. I think I end le. Sorry for rushing so much, but AI is showing. I wanna root for Matthew Metzger and Katie Webber! Even ducks are meowing!! Meow meow moo!

      Meow moo meow...  Well. What did ya know? Lotsa things happened. I was chatting with Amanda and WQ, when WQ sent me the questionaire email thingy. Hmmm. I replied. I was feeling terribly crappy, idiotic and stupid when I was answering that thing. I slept at 1.  Well. I didn't exactly have a nice sleep. I keep waking up in between, ya know. The stupid feelings of mine. I quickly went back to sleep lor. I remembered a very weird and scary dream. Okay. Me and Ah Ji was at AMK Ave 5. The hawker centre. It was in the very very early morning. I was introducing Ah Ji to the black chicken and ku meen stalls (they were close to each other) when suddenly, we were pulled into the Underworld. We came out after a while, then we remembered we lost something there and wanted to go back in. We were about to, when a gui chai (ghost police) came and warned us, tell us not to go back or we will end up like him. After he left, 5 ghosts appeared, holding the 5 things we lost! I remembered a businessman and an middleage lady. They said they will return them to us if we save them from hell. We ran and shouted "HELP! GUI CHAI!!!". The ghosts ran away upon hearing the name, but soon found us. It was almost dawn. A yellow ghost appeared. Ji said that it was the gui chai, and if we found out its three elements, he would appear to save us. A gold coin appeared and we found out that two of the elements are "gold" and "metal". The businessman suddenly attacked me, and I was like suddenly holding a sword. We were fighting (I remind mysel fo Auron), then Mother woke me up. Meow moo! I must ask Wendy to check the significance of "ghosts" in dreams. I bet it is nothing good. Meow moo!  Hmmm. I was bathing then this Shop N Save cat called. Ayiah. It was Lao Ma Zi wanting my mother to buy coffee for her. Meow! HMmm. I ate roti prata for breakfast. Anyway, I finally managed to download Bo Si Mao's MTV!! YAY! Even ducks meowed at the MTV!!! Meow meow meow!   Hmmm. In the afternoon, I meowed at the mian. Okay. WQ came online, so did a whole bunch of cats including CQ. We were planning to go out, but in the end, due to severe lack of participation and enthusiam, we didn't. Hmm. We (me, WQ, KS and KK) played GunBound. Hmm. We keep switching partners, so each of us played with the each other once. I stopped playing at 4..got sian le. I meowed online...meow meow meow, then went off to bath.  After that,I played FFX, much to the chagrin of my father, who shouted at 7.30 that I shouldn't play FFX and should eat. Hmp. I don't appreciate being shouted at. Meow!!! After that, I went online, watched the sitcoms and meowed online again.  Frankly, for the whole of today, I was feeling quite lousy. Very very lousy. Butterflies keep fluttering in my stomach for some unknown reason. I hardly cheered up at all (oh..I did smile when I win at GB). Sigh. If I go on like this, I will most likely get depressed. ....  Sigh. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey Hey! What a rainy rainy rainy day! Brrr!  Hmmm. Today, I was meowing in the morning. HaHa. I went out to eat breakfast with Wendy. Hmmm. It turns out she woke up at 2.30 (such ungodly hours! and she said I was lazy! Heh! You siow zha bo! :P) HaHa. We went to 768's MacDonalds to meow at the Big Breakfast. Wendy treated me, meow moo. We sat there and talked and talked. I don't wanna go back till 11.30, when my parents are out. HaHa. We talked lor. Talk talk talk. Even Wendy's analysis made sense (oh my god, I forgot what analysis that was! I only remembered it was good. I was thinking about it during bathing. Hmmm!). Meow moo!  Hmmm. I came back at 11.30. Shucks. I didn't avoid my mother after all. Hmmm. She cooked noodles and she went out. I meowed with WQ online. I asked him to come Wendy's house to play MahJong (I am going there at 1). He at first agreed, then he said he don't want to come because it is raining. Meow!!! Qi shu lin!  I got over there earlier than Wendy. I meowed at Lassie and watched Oprah till Wendy and KL came back. Me and Auntie set up the table and tiles first. We mooed and meowed at the mahjong. HaHa. I only managed to Hu twice!! Even ducks meow at me! At one time, I was super super blur. I was smsing WQ announcing my first win, then I think that my handphone was not vibrating, so I sent an SMS to myself. HaHa. I didn't caught on to a lot of happenings. I think I pissed KaiLun off. He kinda snapped at me once. Meow moo!  At 4, KL left to go sleep. Hmm. I read Wendy's W.I.T.C.H. comic book. Oh my my! Their powers developed! So jealous! I want elemental powers to meow and moo! Actually, nah. I may end up abusing them. It is nice to have them, however. Wendy played her FFX. She's inside Sin. Hmm. The enemies are quite tough. Oh well. They are like bosses to me.at this stage of my game la. Even ducks are meowing. Hmm.. I played some too. I tried to fight Dark Bahamut, but I ended up getting killed! Meow moo! One swipe of Energy Ray and...bam! All the cats are killed! Meow moo moo!  Hmm..at 6, I went home while Wendy and her mom went to 888 to eat dinner. I went back, bathed and meowed at the roasted duck. Hmm..I came online and just finished supper.   Quack moo meow! Okay. I dunnoe what to add le, so I think I stop blogging. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey meow moo! Today is a special day!! Before I start offically meowing, I would like wish Wen Qiang, Yit Hann and XiaoXi a very happy birthday!   Okay. Now to the meowing part. Hmm. Today early early morning, I was chatting with Manda. Long time never chat with her le. I can say I really enjoyed myself. HaHa. I am quite amazed with Amanda's analysis. It makes a whole lot of sense, really. I could have NEVER thought out of that. Heh Heh Heh. Meow meow!  I woke up at 8+, took a very quick bath and watched my TV. I ate chee cheong fun. At 11, I didn't come online as usual because I want to watch HZGG. Such anxiety! Such a daring escape! Even ducks were meowing! After lunch and HZGG, I came online at 1.  Hmm. What did I do? I spent he whole day downloading a MTV, Beyonce's Me, Myself and I. Darn! I can't find Bo Si Mao's MTV. So hard to find de. XC told me it was because the MTV is not releashed yet. So meow! I can't even get into Kazaa, some error (again!). Sigh. I meowed online till 5, when I go out to bvuy dinner.  Well, I brought dinner. Fried rice for me brother, chicken rice for moi. Ywah. I came back, ate while watching Unbeatables III. After that, I went to bath and came online lor. How meowful!!   Ayiah. I dunnoe what to write. I am going to Ikea with Wendy tomorrow, but it all depends on her mood, I guess. She just now told me maybe she's not in the mood to go. Hmm...have to see first. I don't think I wanna go PJ. The thought of  it  drives me crazy. So, nah-ah to going PJ.   Oh well. I am going to end this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow moo meow!!  Hey Hey! Even the mornings meowed at ya. Hmm.  woke up at 8.30, bathed, came online for awhile. Mother brought back breakfast (duck porridge) and I watched TV till 11. Meow moo meow!  At 11, I started preparing to go out to celebrate WQ's birthday (which is a day early). How meowful! I was kinda late, because I forgot to bring out WQ's prezzie out of the house and have to rush back. Heh Heh. I met KK in the busstop and we went there together. CQ, KS, HL and Gloria all got on the same bus at Woodlands Interchange.   We met WQ there. He went up to put the cake in his fridge and I also went up to put his prezzie. We went down and finds lots more cats have arrived, like PY and YC. Hmmm. Janet arrived later. We played and played basketball till 1+. HaHa. I had so many accidents. Meow moo! Now PY is my ke xin. :P I had fun. Meow moo meow!!  After that, we went up to WQ's house to eat cake and meow. WQ don't get offended ar, but the way his grandmother 'scolds' him is really really funny. Nah, don't quote her la, don't wanna embarass WQ. I laughed and laughed, and we laughed and laughed. It must be real embarassing for him. Anyway, that's not the focal point. Heh Heh.   WQ ordered pizza for us. Of course, I had it as Hawaiian. No way I am eating other types. :P While waiting for the pizza to arrive, we meowed and listened to songs on WQ's computer. When it arrived, WQ's mother and grandma cooked fried beehoon and fries for us. OOO! After some pushing, everyone starts eating. How meowful. Hmm...after eating, we rest for awhile before doing the b-dae celebrations. Oh yes, PY left earlier.  Well, after some while, we finally get to eat the meowing mango cake. HaHa. I wonder what wish WQ made. I wanna know. :P Anyways, we ate the meowing cat. Gloria cut the cake and presented it to WQ. Hmm. She gave me a slice and put it on a tissue paper. I said i don't want (I already said I don't want any cake on a tissue paper, i can't stand it). Meow meow meow. After meowing at the cake, WQ opened his prezzie. He was surprised and shocked. He didn't expect to get the present. He even forgot he told me he liked it. HAHA! He likes it, so I am very happy. We are happy. :D  Hmm. We played his PS2. Janet, KK, Gloria and HL left, leaving only me, CQ and KS. We played Sonic Heroes and Street Fighters. HaHa. We have to wait for a while to go off, because I want to use the toiet, but WQ's mother is bathing. HaHa. I get to use the toilet at 5.40+. Meow moo!   We left soon after. CQ walked back home, and ME and KS took 911E to Woodlands Interchange. I took 913 (very crowded) back home. I went back, bathed, watched TV and ate dinner.   I then came online. Just now, I mopped the kitchen floor and my father is "supervising". Honestly! I will never mop the kitchen floor as long as he is there again! All he does was critisize how I mop the floor. My way works just fine! Hmmmpp! I downloaded two SHE songs from WQ and is now downloading the Bo Shi Mao MTV. I wanna learn how to dance the chorus. Anyways, I was playing back all the SHE songs I have and the one which struck out is Lian Ren Wei Man. Such a beautiful song. I love it very much! :)  Hmm. I think I end this blog le. I enjoyed today. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Hey hey! Even ducks meow at you!  Hmm. Today morning was a bit of a drag. What did I do? Honestly, I forgot. I woke up at 7 today, because Mother's going out and all. XC smsed me at 8, with intentions to wake me up. XC must realize that I only switch on my handphone after I bathed, which by then, would be useless to send me wake up SMSes. :P I chatted and meowed online lor. I got so many things to do! Oh yes. Even ducks must come up with a list of ranks for their own Departments.   Anyhoo, I cooked instant noodles for lunch and meowed at it. Hmm, I was chatting wtih Prof Snapeluva when she said there's a chat transcript of JK's chat. Oh my my. She revealed a lot, didn't she? HaHa. Harry's not gonna die and there's no such thing as Hermione and Draco being together. How meowful!! Meow moo meow!  Hmmm. At 1, I met CQ. We are going to buy WQ's present. Hmm. I orignally lied to WQ that I was playing FFX. Oh well. I can't say where did we go, or else it would be too obvious what the present is. We brought the prezzie. I paid for the prezzie first, so the rest owe me some meowing money. Hmm. I am also bringing the present back home. It's such a mooing view. After prezzie buying, CQ went to eat at LJS. Ahh, WQ, if you are really curious, you can check out all the LJS stores' location. You will get your answer somehow. :P   Hmm. After that, we met Gloria and discusedd the plans for tomorrow. It was decided we are going to play basketball and/or badmintion. Yes. How meowful! After that, we went home lor.  Hmmm. Nothing to write. I reached home, bathed, came online and waiting for dinner to be cooked. Oh yes. You must be wondering why I am blogging so early. Well, I got nothing to do ma, so blog lor. Anyway, later at night, I am trying to do my MNI work. A lot to meow at!   Okay. I go liao. See ya tomorrow. Night blog (or rather, evening. Whatever la.)!

Mother came back with chee cheong fun and I meowed at them. After that, I went to watch HZGG (taped from Sunday). Even Xiang Fei came back from the dead! How reviving! Meow moo meow!   After watching the touching HZGG, I went online, ate my lunch and went to play FFX. Can you believe that WQ was still sleeping until 12+? Meow.  Oh. I defeated that idiotic Seymour!! YAY!! I finally won him! That idiot double-casting freaky mage! Luckily Nuled every magic just in time! Even ducks can win him. I also defeated the Wendigo. How meowful. That was today early morning, when I played till 2am. HaHa. Today I just walked here and there to the Home of Al Bhed. I saved. Heh Heh. Even ducks used Fira on plants.  Okie.

      Meow meow moo meow!  Hmm. Today early morning, I was still up, chatting with that WQ. Okay, maybe I shouldn't say 'that'. Oh meow. Anyway, I was so  bored  that I decided to write a poem. I'll post it down below later, yeah?   Hmm. I woke up quite early (8) today morning to go to 883 with Mother. I ate the fried mian with guo tiao. I just reminded myself why I hate that type of food. Garlic, big pieces, are abound! Horrors! After eating, we brought 8 Days and went to Shop N Save. Oh. A slight mistake in my report yesterday. The thief is a female. Heh. They meowed and meowed. After meowing a lot and buying some snacks, we went home and reached home by 10.   Moo meow moo. Hmm.I am supposed to print the verification slips for Ji and WQ. I'll do it later. This hour is to meow at the cats online and wait for Father to return so we can visit MaMa. HaHa. I forgot to switch on my phone, and when I did, I got a surprise. One from KS, one from CQ and four from XC the very bored. Meow moo meow!!!   Hmm. Dad returned at 11 and we went there lor. HaHa. Today's sticker color is brown. I must organize a color sticker competition! We've got Green, Purple, White and Brown so far. Calling out to all the cats and ducks and whatnot who read my blog, please cast your vote NOW! Fantastic prizes could be won! Okay, who am I kidding? At least ducks will meow! We are joined by Dai Gu Ma and Yee Pak Pak (Fei Chui's father).  Anyhoo, on to MaMa. Hmm. Her leg's been cut. What can I say? She's more fiesty and lively. Before the operation, when she rejects food, she goes "hmmm moi (don't want) hmmm moi" wearily. Now, she goes "Hmm Moi!" with a sharp crisp tone. She complained more. Last time, she barely mutters a thing. That's good I suppose. Fei Chui came to visit. I was beginning to fell that I like MaMa better when she's not complaining when MaMa became funny. She said she dreamt of her dying and being cremated being wrapped up (like what the ducks did to SARS patient), to which we laughed. She then asked me and Felicia (who is also Fei Chui, by the way) if we are dating ("yao mou pak tour?"), to which everyone laughed (except me and Felicia. Ergh). She at first mistook me for some Ah Meng, which I felt totally insulted. Meow moo meow! Anyhoo, we left at 1.   Hmm. We went to AMK Ave 5 to eat the black chicken rice. YAY! It opened. Ahhh! The heavenly mouth-watering, saliva-inducing chicken and the rice! Meow moo meow!! After that, we went to the NTUC nearby to buy oranges. Meow moo meow!   Okie. Returning home, I made plans to meet WQ they all in Woodlands Stadium to play badminton. Father brought me there. Heh Heh. There's only WQ, CQ, KS and HM. After a while, SL, YC, HL, Gloria, KentKent and Joyce came. Meow meow!! We played till 4. By then, me, KS, WQ, CQ, Gloria, HM, KK, KS and HL decided to go to the McDonalds at Marsiling. We went there and chat. I looked at HL's Bio notes. Wow. That's all I can say. Wow.   Okie opkie. That being done, we decided to go back. KK and I walked back from from Woodlands. Long time never walk that road le. Heh Heh. Hmm. I reached home, bathed and went online to wait for mah dinner. Fried rice was here, nice.   O.O! The new Shell catalogue is brimming with goodies! I want that Panasonic Discman (that can play MP3s, have remote...blah blah. That's worth 4800 points though. How meowful! Oh. DGM called. I always have a bad feeling whenever she calls. It's like she is a bringer of bad news or something. No offense ot her, but that's what I always felt. Anyway, MaMa has been transferred to Ward 9, in the 9th floor. Hmm. Dunnoe which bed though. Meow.  Oh well. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog! Oh yes yes. My poem. Enjoy!      As a duck, I should meow. Should I really? The puzzle lies, Confusingly.  Meowingly, You tell me. Should I, Or should I not?  In a turmoil, My head spinning, My heart beating, Utter pandemonium!  Closing my eye, I hardly care more. Fate decides, My fate.

      Hey Hey! Meow moo meow!!  Hmm. Today morning is quite unexciting, so I will not meow too much on that. I ate roti prata for breakfast. How meowful! Hmmmm. I went online to meow at my friends.  Hmmm. At 11.30, we met to go to Orchard. HaHa. They want to walk around. Joyce, PY and KS were at PJ consulting teacher cats, so me, WQ, CQ and HM went ahead to Orchard first. So meowful. We went into Popular to wait for them to come. How meow meow.   They came after some time (I don't know how much time elapsed. I am too busy reading Sabrina. Heh). Some cats wanted to go eat Sakae Sushi in Orchard, but majority of us want to eat that in Causeway Point. Dinner hour is at 3, so we got lotsa time to spend in Orchard. We went to HMV at the Heeren to look at some CDS. I listened to Beyonce's Dangerously In Love, and I absolutely fell in love with it! I want her CD, along with Dido's and Evanescence's. Meow!! They went to the arcade to play some meowing games, then we went back to Causeway Point.  Hmmm. Sakae was meowing. So much Jap food. I hate the Miso Soup, but I like the egg-thingy. So sumptous! Hmm. I ate until quite full le. Hoyce's brother, James, joined ua halfway. Meow moo. It was a real tight squeeze. Squeezy squeze. Even the watermelons and the sushi meowed at the ducks.   After that, we walked down. We met that KH halfway. I then rushed off to meet Wendy, just muttering a hasty "bye". Actually, I didn't go to talk with Wendy just to avoid him. I originally made plans with her already ma. I went there to talk, sometimes with Ayu. Meow moo meow! We chatted till 7+, when I have to go back home to watch TV.   Hmmm. I came back home, bathed, watched TV and came online. I registered my JAE le. I put PJ Sci, YJ Sci, YJ Arts and PJ Arts, in that order. Yeah. Only these 4. With my 12 points, I am sure to get into PJ de lor. If not PJ, then YJ. Meow moo! Even ducks will agree.   HaHa. My mother just helped catch a thief at Shop N Save. She saw him taking a plastic bag off Counter 4 (empty tonight) and going towards the bird nest section. She alerted Pek Chu, who alerted Vincent. They saw him taking 2 boxes of bird nest, then jia jia look at the batteries, then went out. Woah. PC and Vincent chased after him. HaHa. They managed to catch him (and lotsa cats were watching). They let him go in the end (bird nest taken back of course). Hmm. Mother reckons that PC is gonna get scolding for letting that guy go. Hmm.   Oh well. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow.

HAHAHA! Hmmm...The LOTR: ROTK dominated the whole Oscars awards. I mean, winning all 11 nominations! By the 5th win, I got so bored at ROTK's monopoly of the award show. Heh. Even Billy Crystal was meowing at Oprah! Heh Heh Heh. Of course, I was online too. I keep running here and there during commercials. :)  Hmm. Mother brought lunch back home (she went cousin-visitng). Hmm. Such delicious BBQ chicken from Admiralty Place. Moo! After the Academy Awards, I went online and then went out lor. Actually, I was kinda late because I was choosing my t-shirt. So little selection!! Anyway, HM was there only.  HaHa. Did I mentioned that Mrs Chew called me in the morning? She accidentally called mah father and she said "wrong number" when she realized that it was not me on the line. HAHA! She told me she's only free on 2.30. Heh. We waited till 2.30 for all the cats (quite a whole lot) to arrive. Meow moo.  Hmm. HaHa. A teacher came and bring Mrs Chew down. HaHa! Chew!! The first thing she asked is our science grades. She was rather pleased with us, most of us got As. :D Hmm. She treated us all to drinks. Coolies! We chatted a lot, about her school (EVG is kinda hard...she had to shout at the lower sec...oh my. Naughty kidlets), about us. HaHa. I passed XC's message to her "tell her meow and say thank you". HAHA! She said "oh! I got so many meows!". What a fun teacher! We chatted till about 3+, when she has to do her work. Me and KentKent went home.  Hmm. I went home, bathed and came online. Ayiah..I was deciding whether or not to put Poly courses in my choices, ya know, to be my safety net. XC told me to just put PJ and YJ. 12 points sure get into PJ de. HaHa. Yeah. Only these choices. Tomorrow register. Heh Heh. Wendy invited me to play MahJong, but I didn't go in the end. Father don't allow. Sigh.   At 6, we went for dinner. Dad wanted to tell me MaMa's leg was amputated today. He used the Cantonese for cut, "Kort". I heard it as "kquack", which means died in Cantonese. I was like "Oh my god! Oh my god!" My father was like "Why are you freaking out over the leg being cut?" I felt so embarassed I misheard a word. Heh. Anyway, I meowed at my dinner.  I came back and went online lor. Hmm. What do I have to add? Er...nothing? Then I go off le. Heh. I am rewatching the Oscars, mainly see Billy Crystal's hosting. Heh Heh. Funny guy. Okie. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Ahhh. Well. See. Didn't blog again. HaHa. Yesterday I got home real late lor. Ayioh...just too much work to do0.  Okay okay. Who am I kidding? I didn't do any work. I just am too tired to come online. In fact, I am very tired today also..even more tired than yesterday. I just wanna blog lor. Ayiah..my Tutorial 4 still haven't do yet...idiot! Must do tomorrow, along with possiblity of Chinese Compo. Shit. AHH! I forgot also got the chinese book review thingy!   Okay whatever la. Yesterday was okay lor. Oh yes. At GP, I defended my views on caning is a torture. Almost everyone don't agree. I don't care. Caning is toturous all the same. Two wrongs don't make a right after all.   Today is even more exciting. Okay. Today is Janet's birthday, so happy birthday to ya! :D  Hmmm. Today was so-and-so. We have to do the idiotic canal run lor! I was, once again, slow. I have to do 480 jumping jacks. Idiot la. I felt so tired, run-down and worn out. I was actually 'shaking' on the bus...and I never shook so hard since witnessing my Godfather's cremation. I don't think anyone noticed...(that crap WQ...I was so tired le and he still continus making fun of me. Fuck him la)..Oh my god...I feel so tired! If I have to do this again and again, I rather cripple my leg and not run again, since running only bring me so much torture. Why can't the idiot teachers understand that some people just CAN'T run? What? If they can run, fine. Good for them. Some just can't. There's no use punishing us lor. So what if I do 480 jumping jacks? It's not gonna improve my score. I will deliberately fail NAPTA test! Okay..not sit-and-reach, because I can really stretch and I want to do well in that. It's the only thing I can pass anyway.   Okay. After a whole deal of rambling on and on, I will describe Janet's birthday. We brought her a bag for her brithday. HaHa. We kinda ignored her in the morning, because we want to give her a surprise in the evening ma. Okay. In the evening, we led Janet to Causeway Ploint, where MeiYing and ThongZhen 'ambushed' her with a cake. HaHa! We all celebrated for her. HaHa! Okay. I kinda had fun, despite the tiredness. :)  Tomorrow in PJ, we have a "smart-casual day", where we can wear our home clothes. HaHa. I am wearing the zipper shirt with my black (which is turning greyer and greyer..ayioh!) pants. HaHa! Even cats are wearing home clothes tomorrow.   Okay. I realize that this is very late. Okay. I end the blog le. See ya next time! Night blog!

      Heya! HaHa. Yeah. Yesterday no blog. More details to follow.  Okay. Yesterday I went to Physics Make-up. Only little people attended. Meow moo! Okay. After that was meowful. Hmm. I wanted to buy Beyonce's CD "Dangerously In Love", but the shops ain't open so early. Just then, Wendy smsed, asking for company. I happily agreed!  I joined her at Sata at Civics Center. I thought she was sick or something, going to see the doctor. It turned out that she has to go for a medical check-up for Poly. Hmm. There were lotsa Poly students. Her queue number was 214. wah lao! We waited for approximately 45 minutes for that freaky number to show up. Hmm. I was listening to the radio on Wendy's handphone while waiting for her. Wah lao! It took until 1+ for the whole checkup to end. 3 hours! HaHa! Can die man! Never mind la. Her brother came looking for us, because he has to apply for some CPF thingy to pay for Wendy's poly fees.  After settling the CPF thingy, me and Wendy went to eat. We ate at Yoshinoya. How meowful! Okay. After eating, we went back to Civics for Wendy to take a passport-sized photo. We went to Tom&Stephanie first, and Wendy brought a pair of shorts. O.O After picture taking, we went back to Causeway Point. She photocopied her brother's birth cert, and we finally went to buy my Beyonce's CD! YaY! What a wonderful CD! Really good songs in there!   We then went back. I did my Chem homework. Wah! A lot man. Besides Redox, I did Mole Concept's 2 tutorials. It took me till 7+ to finish. Even ducks are meowing!   Hmm. Okay. The main reason why I didn't blog yesterday was that I was hooked up reading "Something More", a Harry/Draco slash. A really good Harry Potter fan fic! In total from Friday's and yesterday's, I spent more than 5 hours reading the 34 chapters. I do hope the next chapter would come up soon. It's such a captivating story. Oh god...the whole while I was reading it, powerful emotions evoked from me. The constant 'butterly-fluttering-in-my-stomach" effect whilst reading the story....the courtship, the love..kept me on constant edge. Oh man! It was great! Fantabulous! I will post a paragraph below, which I feel is the whole point of this story. I like this para very much also. Oh yes. A sentence too.  "As they both rushed towards their release, an overwhelming sense of connectedness flowed through them. All that existed was the exquisite feeling of being buried inside of someone, of being filled, of skin on skin, of heated kisses. All these sensations blended together and Draco realised with a jolt that he couldn’t tell where his feelings ended and Harry’s began. Draco suddenly became aware of the power flowing around them; a fine golden haze swirling around them; a pure and simple connection on the deepest level possible."  "Their lips met in a tender kiss. It spoke of desire and need, but most of all, it spoke of love and in the end, words weren’t needed."  Oh okay. So sue me if I had picked out the sex scenes. Sheesh. They do really describe the whole essence of this wonderful story. After all, this is a Harry/Draco slash. What is a slash if you don't have an essence to it? Okay. I am waiting with bated breath for the next chapter!  Okay. Today I mainly watched TV and did my GP homework. HaHa. I finally watched my Moulin Rouge VCD. Today, in the Unbeatables, XiaoTong was raped. Now, I've seen that scene (duhz) and I felt appalled. Now, I still continued to feel shocked. Imagine the pain she went through...it's horrible to think of! Being robbed of her virginity...that's very devastating. Gone, just like that. All because of a guy's lust. Really stupid things rapists do. Try getting raped and see how you feel, you idiot rapists out there! XiaoXing is horrible!   Okay. Here I am. Online. HaHa. Oh well. There's gonna be a gas law quiz tomorrow! Must study later. See ya then. TaTa. Night blog!

      Heya! Heh Heh. Woah...reall didn't blog yesterday wor. I am supposed to be doing the Physics tutorial for tomorrow's make-up lecture. HaHa. CQ seems like not wanting to do it, Kelvin dunnoe whether to do it or not. So, I think I am doing it at 9.  Yes. Okay. What happened yesterday? I honestly have no mood to recap. Oh yes!!! The most SHOCKING episode on AI yesterday! Can you believe it? Fantasia, LaToya and Jennifer are in the Bottom Three! Oh my god! What on earth was America thinking? Me and Amanda was aghast and shocked! The three best singers in the competition, and they are in Bottom 3? The judges and Ryan chastised America, telling them that AI is NOT a popularity contest! They have to vote for the best singer! What the heck? The one who went was Jennifer... Oh boy! Stupid decision America! You let a talent slipped through, you dorks! I heard quite a number of people dislike Fantasia because of her cockiness. Honestly! She has a great voice, and she has the right to be cocky lor! Me and Amanda honestly envisioned Fantasia and Jennifer in the Top 2, but now, it is impossible man! I do hope Fantasia makes it, becasue honestly, if she doesn't, there whole point of the show is gone. Fantasia should be at least in the top 2 (she can easily pull out a "Clay Aiken" if she doesn't win...seriously)! Go Fantasia! We are behind you!! Jia you!  Okay. Today was mooing. Ayioh!! I have no mood to blog le!! I am ultra distracted by a great Harry Potter fic!  OH NO!!! TaTa!   Okay. Obviously, I am back. Heh Heh. I came back from Survivor. Wow! Shii Ann did it! She won her first ever Immunity! She has beaten all odds and perservere! Shii Ann knew clearly she was about to go, but she's ain't going without a fight! When there is a will to stay, you can achieve anything! Shii ann proves that saying true today! Her strong determination to survive for another 3 days has granted her first-ever Immunity! Great! Bravo! Of course, I wouldn't be too sure of her departure status next week. If she loses Immunity, she's going. So, let's hope she wins! Okay...Alicia was voted out. Bad choice people! I like her frankness and her eloquence. She's a strong player. Stupid people! (Quoted from Shii Ann) You should have voted out Rob Mariano instead! Ayierr!! Useless!!  Okay. I go liao. See ya. TaTa!

      Heya! Well, it seems like I am blogging every other day. Heh Heh. Sorry la. I was distracted...very distracted.  Okay. About yesterday. I didn't go to school yet again. HaHa. I had diarrhea. Stupid right? Again. Heh Heh. I was actually going to school, but halfway on the journey, my stomach act up and I have to rushed back home (luckily we just left Woodlands, can U-Turn back easily). Ah well. I missed a lot of things. Hmm. what did I do at home? Certainly not homework. Heh Heh. I surfed the Net all day. Yeah la..lazy me, and still don't want to blog right? Bad KY!!  Okay. So today I went back to school. I noticed that CQ and YF has gotten closer. It must be due to my absence. Oh yes. Remind me to tell you what happened later when I walk home with Gloria. Damn funny. Anyway, seee! My absence has let CQ made more friends. Beneficial right? :P  Hmmm. I have to take a Maths test, along with 3 other absentees. Well, the first question is peanuts, until the last one, where I cannot solve for 'x'! Ayioh! It turns out that all of us that are taking cannot find 'x' either! Heh heh! Not only me wor.   Hmmm.... During PW, thanks to Tham, we made our project better. He let us understand things better and to specify our scope. Good! Even Mdm Shafrah, who was "PW (Pronounced as POW by Tham) Dictionary" came over and complimented on our project. YAY! We've gotten the green light by both teachers! :D  Hmmm. Today the SAF Choir came to perform for us! Woah! Enriching performance man! All of us want to buy tickets to watch their performance! We like them man! Great voice! Finally! Me and CQ found a place in the amry unit where we belong! CQ wants to go to the choir. If I can't, then I will apply for the drama unit lor! At least this beats running around the field and getting yourself killed!   I finsihed my homework. The MI tutorial, Chinese compo's corrections and I have to do PW later. Must come up with analysis of our topic (nightlife in Singapore). Yes!   Opps. I forgot to write the story of what happened on our way back. Yes. Well, me and Gloria were walking from Admiralty MRT. She was telling me that CQ and YF got closer and CQ told Gloria "I made new friends, and I don't have to depend on KY." That CQ ar! HaHa! In idgination, I said "What? Now I am like trash! Can throw away liao lor!" Then, this guy was walking past us in the opposite direction and he said "No lor! You are not anything at all lor! (Ni she me duo bu shi lor!)" loudly. I was shocked and when I turned back to look at him, he was talking on the phone. Me and Gloria burst out laughing. HAHAHA! Oh my god! Such a huge coincidence! HAHAHA!! For a while, I thought the guy was actually talking to me man. HAHA! So funny sia! LOL!  Oh well. I gotta go now. See ya! Night blog!

      Heya! Sorry for not blogging yesterday. I was too busy to.  Now. You might be wondering why I am blogging so early on a Monday! Ain't I suppsoed to be at school. Heh. As you can see (very obviously), no I am not. Well, I've got diarrhea, from eating fried carrot cake yesterday. I asked the stall vendor to put chilli, but I never expected he would put so much that you can see a pool of chilli around the carrot cake. Well, yeah. I got diarrhea.   Ayioh. I left CQ all alone. Well, he told me he's hanging out with Yih Fei and all, so that's good. For a bit, I was worried how he's gonna survive being alone, until I remembered he can hang out with YF. Yeah..  Hmmm. Sunday ar? Yeah. I completed my Chem and Physics homework. Hmm.. I don't know how to do most problems...and today I didn't attend Chem lecture somemore. Sigh!! Yeah. I didn't really watch NKF, 'cept at the last for Zoe's performance! So exciting! So heart-pounding! Go Zoe!!  Okay. Er-hm. Proper decroum people. Yes yes. Today, I woke up with a terrible stomachache. After visiting the loo, the cramp in my stomach still won't go away. Now, past experience has taught me that this should be a cause for concern.   My intuition was right! I do have diarrhea! I decided not to go to school on the last minute. Hmm. Mother went to the Polyclinic for her own check-up, so I stayed at home and cleaned the floor. Meow meow! So long never clean the floor le. I did a rather sloppy job, because I felt terribly tired and my stomach is aching. Yeah.  At 10 something, Mother came back. Well, the doctor said I could develop a fever. Now, for the sake of skipping Mass PE, I hope I do. I know, stupid silly me. I really HATE Mass PE with a passion. It damn torturous! Why would the education ministry incorporate that into our education system, I don't know. They must be raving mad. Sigh! Anyhoo, I have to photocopy 6 copies of my MC, for the various teachers that need them. Oh well. So mah fan.  I came back and all I did was endless Internet Surfing. Ayioh...I am damn tired la. I wanna go sleep, but later got Friends. How?!! Sigh!  See ya romorrow. Nignt blog!

      Sigh. Sorry for not blogging. On Thursday I was busy with homework (dang, I have my Physics tutorial placed in front of me, and i have absolutely no intention of doing it...sigh). On Friday, I was prevented from coming online by infexible idiots. You can guess who le la. No need for names.  Okay. I am only covering what happened yesterday. Yesterday was our school's Sports Day. HaHa. We went back to watch. Me, CQ, Joyce, HM, Gloria, KS and XC. WQ, KentKent and Hann joined us later. Hmmm. This time, I feel that we were able to concentrate on the runs more. All those times I've been to Sports Day, all I did was incessant cheering. I didn't even concetrate on who's running and whatnot. Yeah. We were seated at the VIP seats wor. So shuang. HaHa. Anyhoo, we also went to visit our teachers. Mrs Chua, Mrs Jalil, Miss Tan....meow meow! We chatted with them for quite a bit. Hmmm. During the Inter-Department relays, we went down to cheer for the teachers. HaHa. We shouted ourselves crazy! Hmmm. After Sports Day, we went to Causeway Point. I am forbidden to out eatside, so I was about to go home when I smsed Wendy out of curiosity and asked where she is. It turns out that she and Manda are at Causeway, so I went to find them to chat. I had such a great time with them. Miss the old days of chatting with Manda and Wendy. After some walking around, we went back home lor.  Okay. Today. Today morning I was supposed to meet CQ and gang at 8, but because I have to eat breakfast, I can only make it at 8.30. Oh well. When I reached there, CQ, Gloria, Joyce and HM were there le. SL came later. Hmm. We played some basketball. Yeah, the court was full and all, but we 'chap' our way in and got ourself half-a-court. Heh Heh. I dunnoe why leh, but I fumbled with the ball quite a lot of times. I mananged to goal twice, so that's good. Shoryly after, KS arrived. We went down to sit at the fitness corner and talk lor, until XC arrives.  Sigh. What happened next was a series of unfortunate incidents. That idiot hit me with his plastic bag containing his pants. That bag broke (Huo gai, says me and Wendy. Bags are not meant to be used to hit people anyway, so huo gai that his bag broke). It was, of course, deemed as my fault. Yeah right. Like I caused the bag to break. If he didn't hit me with that, it wouldn't have broken in the first place, right? He then made me put the bag into my bag, but my bag was too full of library books to squeeze in useless items. I didn't want to take it, so what he did was grab the hook of my bag and refused to let go. He tried to push me down a cliff, get me knocked down by a car and crash me into a wall. That's not the worst part. The worst part is he inflicted deep wounds onto my arms. He pinched me real hard, causing a moonacle mark on my elbow (I discovered a deep scratch on my wrist, during when I was bathing when I felt that pain... I can sue him for assualt, but I don't have the money to hire a lawyer..Oh well). The scary part was that when he did it, he glared at me with eyes full of mavolence and hatred. I didn't know any human being could possess such frightening emotions, and use them to cause harm to others. The others don't dare to interfere, seeing that XC went totally ballistic (quoted from CQ...frightening creatures, once humans get really mad. XC should be branded as dangerous and locked up indefinitely). It was after some incessant pleading on Gloria's part and me shredding a few tears (dunnoe whether he knew or not la) that he decided to let go.      I kept a huge distance from him for the rest of the day. On the way towards Causeway Point, I was trying my hardest not to cry. Call me weak-willed. Whatever. I don't care. I couldn't control myself when we reached the food court. I was (forcefully) escorted to the toilet to clean up. I calmed down for a bit. Yeah. CQ, Gloria and KS are great friends. They cared for me. :D I had a huge temptation to message Wendy, but afriad of upsetting myself, I didn't. (I did tell her just now though) I suffered all that, to put it basically, due to bullying. Plain and simple. Bullying. I am very prone to bullying, seeing how I couldn't retaliate. CQ asked why I didn't retaliate, and let myself get bullied. How I wish I can. If I retaliate, I am sure to get bullied more. Experience taught me that. Sigh...  Hmm. We had lunch. Actually, I didn't really have a proper lunch. I was too upset and is in no mood to eat something. I only ate ice kacang. Yeah. Anyway, after all, we went up to take NeoPrints. Oh boy. Was I glad that XC and HM (no offense on HM's part, don't take it in the wrong way hor) left to meet Mr Low. I can't stand being with that animal while playing pool.   We went u to play pool wor. Well, I began to relax and enjoy myself. HaHa. TZ joined us later, followed by WQ. HM and XC came later after WQ. My ball skills improved, quite. I started to hit hardly and paying extra attention to my angles. Hmm. Good.   After pooling for 5 hours, me and Gloria left first to go to the library (to return my books), then we went to top-up our cards, then we went home.   I went back, bathed, watched my Sat show, ate dinner then came online. Homework still not touched yet. Heh. I have to do that, plus Chem tutorial, before I come online tomorrow, or else, I'll never have the time to complete them! Yes!   Okay. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow, most probably. Night blog!

      Oh my meow! OH MY MEOW!!! It has been what? 17 days?? Almost 3 weeks man!   Heh Heh. I need to explain my mysterious dissaperance. On Monday, March 19, I discovered that my computer became terribly screwed up. Ads started appearing here and there, and I have a corrupted file, preventing me from accessing a hell lot of my programs. I can't even go to Messenger and IE keeps closing down on me. That's why I didn't blog. IE could shut down on me any second.   Guess what? I got Windows XP. HaHa! Uncle Steven came to fix for me (on the Sunday when Miss Congenality was showing. Such a nice show!). He couldn't fix the problem, so he suggested cleaning up the hard drive. Oh well. He also suggested a change of OS, so I wanted XP. Yep. Here I am, using XP! Weee! Even XP cats are meowing at the new Operating System. This computer is so darn empty. I must fill it up with my files (I saved my files on CD-Rs). Yes. I am now downloading MSN Messenger. So slow, the download! Ayioh!!  Well well well. A whole lotsa things happened. Hmmm. Let me start with the academic aspect first.   Hmmm. What can I say? These days are pretty hectic. Yep. I got my time-table le. Hmm. The odd-days are good, because we are let off early. The even-days are long. Yep. I have to attend make-up lectures (I think tomorrow's Chem lecture is the last make-up lecture), so I am returning late these days. On Mondays, I got Choir till 7:30. I will be discussing my views on the different subjects later. Anyhoo, because I can't go online, two adverse (okay, not really adverse. Only one is.) effects happened. One, I have lotsa time to do my homework. Heh. Now, my Chinese homework is in front of me and I don't even have the heart to do it. Two, I've lost touch with the music world. Seriously. I haven't been listening to the radio!! I don't know what new songs there are! Oh my! I must recover from the 'disconnection'!  Hmmm. Lemme talk about GP first. Well, it is/was (can't decide which) my favorite subject. Mr Jeremy (an ABC) is our tutor. Well, he's effeminate. Yeah. HaHa. I don't care about that de la. He too soft, easily bullied. Hmm. I got into a GP group, SU(Slackers United). Okay. Whatever la. I have a neutral view on GP, as of now.  Okay. Moving onto Chinese. Well, we got this Mr Yeo (Yang Lao Shi). Hmmm. He's okay. He has high expectations of us though, seeing that our class is the 'best'. Yeah. S22 was split up into 3 Chinese classes (I think Gabriel and JiaHao switched places. JH was supposed to go into our class, and Gabriel into the "weaker" class. Gabriel got around D7-C5 for Chinese... Ayiah, JH came into our class anyway.). The As went into my class lor. Hmmm. Sometimes, Mr Yeo is quite funny, but sometimes, he is not. He really expects high standards from us. Ergh. My Chinese is not that good. It is just luck that I got an A. Sheesh. Ayiah, Chinese class is meowing.  Okie. Chem next. Well, I am kinda struggling. Well, not really. I am just currently struggling with Redox. It's very complicated, and worse off, it is the foundation of many topics. Sigh. Well, we got this really good Practical teacher, Mrs Jasima. Our Tutorial tutor is a complete opposite of Mrs Jasima. Boy, does she really has a short fuse. She even said so herself. She said "I am not here to become a celebrity and make friends. This is my job, this is my career and I am here to teach!". Oh my.   Okay. Physics. Hmm. Physics was okay. I mean, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would. I understand Kinematics and can apply the 4 equations. Yep. Our Tutor is Miss Yee. Hmm. She has a very soft voice, so she uses microphone to speak all the time. She's kinda weak though, I mean, as in can be bullied quite easily. She doesn't raise her voice with us. Hmm. Physics was okay for me.  Maths C. HaHa. Our tutor is Mr Tham, who is also our form teacher. He hor, don't know how to say him la. He's a bit crazy. "This rascal minus this rascal gives you this rascal here....okay, jokes aside" -.-" He's a good CT though. He calls me "the small K"...O.O What a meowing meow meow.   Propject Work. Yep. We are gonna do PW for our first-year. Hmmm. I got into the same group as Kelvin (groups arranged by Tham Tham. he commented "2Ks! Luck of the draw!"). Hmm. I am also with GekLing (our class manager, or monitoress), FengXiang (I keep mistakenly calling her Xiang Fei. Too much HZGG! HaHa! Speaking of HZGG, CQ informs me that we still need to see a lot more episodes before Huang Ah Ma comes to fetch them back! Haiyoh...!!) and WeeTiong. Hmmm. I like my group. Good good. I am a bit worried about our topic, after seeing the sample proposal forms presented in lecture today. Hmm. See how the meeting tomorrow goes.   Haiz. What else haven't I covered? I think that's all for the academic side. Now, I shall move on.  Hmmm. I really felt myself changing (in thoughts) as the time passes by. Like, a new me emerges lor. Hmm. I shan't reveal too much. Yeah. I am so itching to tell Manda and Wendy. Maybe I'll sms them later. Hmmm. (Haiyoh...my Chinese homework is still staring at me from the table. I only completed 2 questions, 3 more to go. Sigh! Never mind, hand up on Friday. Can do tomorrow!)  Not being able to come online at all (okay, not at all. My brother only allows me to use for meagre amounts of time, for he has Counter-Strike to play...sigh), I really miss chatting with mah friends. Wendy. Amanda. CQ. XC. Yeah. You say how!!  Well, not that me and CQ are so anti-social that we didn't hang out with other cats. We hang out with Yih Fei, Jeric and JunSheng. Most of the break times, me and CQ will always go alone anyway. Okay, we are kinda anti-social. :P Hmmm....  Hmm. What else to write? I don't think there's anything more I would like to add, except that I have to complete my Chinese homework real soon. Heh. The worry-wort. Okay. Gotta go sleep now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!

      Meow meow!  What a meowful day full of surprises! Okay. Starting from the morning. I woke up real early (ungodly, I tell ya!) at 7.15 to bath. I ate breakfast, after that switching on my phone.  Boy oh boy! I was in for a shock! CQ doesn't want to go for MT Oral anymore! First he messaged to meet at 10, then after that he said he wanted to study maths instead. Grr! HaHaHa! That CQ ar!  I studied Trigo lor. I didn't really study as in really study. I memorised the formulas. After that I went online to relax la. HaHa! Even the relaxing cats are meowing.  Okay. I ate lunch, then after that at 12.30, I went out to meet CQ lor.  I met him on the train. We went to CCK together, then board bus 175 to PJ.  We made it to school with lotsa time to spare. HaHa. We met JiaYan. We went into Lt2, instead of the bridge due to too many cats.   The test started. O.O! There were 9 questions! They came in the order of increasing difficulty. Me and CQ can't do the last two questions. Sigh! Well, we feel that we can pass. Barely. Heh.  Putting that test aside. CQ went to play badminton with his sister and cousin and I went home.  HaHa. Went home, bathed, came online, went for dinner, watched TV, came online and watched TV again. Heh.   HaHa! Friends is so funny! Phoebe is so terribly laughable! Little wonder why she is my favorite character! HaHaHa!   The judges for the Singapore Idol is announced. They are Dick Lee, Ken Lim, Florence Tan and the surprise guest whose name I forgot. Heh. TNP got the three supposed judges correct. HaHa! Oh well. I don't know everyone except Dick Lee. Honestly, who don't know him? Meow!  Okay. I gotta end liao. See ya next time! Night blog!

      Heya! Oh my my! What a whole lotsa things happened!    Saturday   Ze all-important day! The award ceremony!! YaY! I met Siva at the usual bus stop and we went to school together. HaHa! Siva ate some bread, then we walked around the school. Mainly we went to our classroom. Oh my! How things changed! Ha! 4/5 left a bit of ourselves on the walls. Those double-sided tapes still remained there! HaHa! After that, we went down to the hall.  HaHa! I met Wendy and Hann and Ping! So happy to see them! HaHa! We were soon joined by the rest of the cats. Miss Tan came and took our attendance, and showed us where we are supposed to seat.   We have to wait for a while though. Waiting for the guest-of-honor, Mr Something (Ayiah...I forgot his name le. Oh yes! Richard Soh? Is it Soh? Ayiah..never mind la) to arrive at 8.25.  Hmm. Yeah. He arrived quite punctually, then the school song was played. Ayioh..they removed the lyrics. They are making the pupils sing. HaHa! Only the Riversidians in front sang. Meow!  After that was the introductory speech by Mrs Singh. Blah blah blah. Ayioh...so boring.   After the speech were the prizes being given away. YaY! The prizes for top Sec 1-3 last year were awarded. After that...it's us!  Miss Tan told us to collect the prizes then leave. Hann insist on staying there for bask in the limelight. HaHa. He did that, but they were shooed off stage. I collected my trophy, and left. What a beautiful cup-trophy thingy award! I was given the "Passion In Learning" award for scoring 5 distinctions!   HaHa! After the ceremony, the school took some pics of us. Hmm, after that was the reception. We mingled around to talk to the teachers. We mingled, we ate and we talked.   At 10+, we went off lor. HaHa. No la. Hann wanted to go kaypoh at the parent-teacher meeting, so me, Hann, XC, Amanda, Wendy and Ping went around to tour the classroom blocks. We first went into Mr Du's classroom. That Hann ar! We left soon after. Then, we went into Mr Tsung's classroom. Ayioh! HaHa! We also left..then continued touring until the end lor.  HaHa. All of us then took the bus to Woodlands. Hmm. I went home first. I am joining them later for steamboat. I don't wanna go out.   I went back home, ate lunch (instant noodles), watched taped Pokemon then come online. HaHa. I left at 3.25 to meet Gloria lor. We then travelled to Woodlands to meet the rest.  PY, me, Gloira, Joyce and ShuQiang went to Marina Bay first. We are supposed to meet the rest at the restaurants. Oh well. Ha. When reaching Marina Bay, we decided not to take the bus there, instead, walking. I prophesized that Hann they all will pass us in the bus. Well, they did. But they weren't early. We are earlier! :P  We didn't go to Zheng Fa to eat. We went to this other restuarant that is cheaper ($10) and we can use other plates. HaHa! They have less variety though. Oh well. Got hams can le. :P  Yeah. I gorged myself silly! That PY is partly at fault! Take so much food! Nobody wanted to eat, so I gorbled the rice and noodles down. Adding to that, my hams were tad uncooked. Ayioh! I also ate down two bowls of fake shark fins. Now, I am helpless in the face of shark fin, real or fake. Oh my my!   At the end...my stomach hurts...a lot! Oh my god! Me and Gloria took a walk...and my stomach was hurting! It felt like it's gonna burst! I think I know how pregnant women felt! Oh god.. I can't walk at all! I felt so breathless. Gloria went to seek help. Joyce they all came and told me the toilet is in the pool place.  I went in in there and vommitted all my dinner out. Yeah. I could 'taste' the dinner. Heh Heh. Yeah...my stomach immediately felt so much better. I also felt hungier. HaHa!  Heh. I ate some fruits and talked for a while. After that, we left lor. The rest went to play pool at Causeway Point, while me and Gloria. Joyce, PY and Hann did some  interesting  stuff. Ayioh! You cats ar!! Zhen si de!   Oh yes. I reached home at 9+, to the surprise of my parents. Woah! HaHa! Yeah...first time I returned from a steamboat outing so early. Heh Heh. Anyway, after bathing, I watched Miss USA. I didn't actually watch, as I fell asleep halfway. I woke up to catch Miss Missouri win that title. Oh I meow!    TODAY   Oh! Today was nothing la. Heh HEh. Waking up, eating black carrot cake for breakfast. Heh.   For lunch, we went to Admiralty Place. I ate xiao wan mian. Mother went there to collect her Tupperware and Father's driving us there. Yeah. He drove us back too. Meow!  Hmm. I am online ever since. I am meeting Ben later to eat dinner. Meow meow!   Okay. I am supposed to study for Maths test tomorrow. I don't have the drive to leh. How? Sigh... Study tomorrow lor.  Tonight ar? I think I am gonna surf the net, then go to sleep. Heh Heh. Meeting CQ tomorrow to go to MT Oral test. Meow!  Okay. I gotta go liao! See ya next time!

      Heya!!  Oooo! Ooooo! The results are out!! Lemme give you a little hint. The results ain't surprising.  Big big hint, rather! YES! It's   FANTASIA BARRINO  !! Fantasia!! Fantasia!! After a long long long 2 hours full of songs and nonsensical fillers, the winner was announced!! YAY!!! Fantasia!! Fantasia!! Fantasia!!   I was feeling very estatic, of course, but it hardly came as a surprise. Of course Fantasia will win. She should. HaHa! YaY! Lets hope Fantasta career would be fantastic one! :D   TODAY   Today is the last day of the term, and our GP exam. Well, it is a mixed paper of sorts. Why do I say so?  Paper 1, the essay component. I can say I find it quite easy. When I saw the questions, I was like "oh my lord...all I don't know". Then I spotted the last question, which is "'It's still a man's world' Do you agree?" YaY! I know how to do that one! I've done it for essay before (well, the female version..but the points are still the same). :D So happy. Of course. You cats should know what is my response. Disagree, strongly to boot, of course!   Paper 2, the comprehension component. The letdown! Oh my lord! The passages were all Greek to me! The questions are so crappy! Oh my my my my! Doomed le la!   Sigh! After that, we went out to eat lor. What did we eat? Long John Silver. Yeah. After that, we went to the library to study Maths.  Heh. I didn't really do any studying. I completed the TYS section for Log and Exponential Functions. Well, there were only 14 questions. After that, I was utterly bored. I was in no mood to do any maths. So I fell asleep. HaHa! Lazy moi! After waking up at 4+, I went down to borrow a book. Jackie by Josie. Such an intriguing book. CQ left first, then we left at 5+.  Hmm. Yeah. The usual lor. Now I am feeling sleepy, and I gotta wake up at 5.15 tomorrow. Remember tomorrow is the 29th? RS Award Ceremony!! YAY! Yeah. I have to leave the computer on for a couple of hours while I download the Friends episode from Amanda. The One About Phoebe's Rats. I think I go sleep, then let the alarm wake me up.   HaHa! Yeah. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!

      Heya! Ayiah..I wanna skip skip skip till yesterday night!  Okay! Yesterday was the finale performance of Fantasia and Diana! Yes!  Okay. Diana first. Wow! She's improved by leaps and bounds. Her first two songs are great...having that 'wow' factor. Yes. Not bad. Worthy a competitor to Fantasia! Her third song was plain. It didn't wow me. Noperino.  Oh yes. Me and Manda was messaging each other, commenting on the show. We are both big big Fantasia fans!'  Yes! Fantasia Barino! Her first song, which I don't know the name, wasn't made for her. We can tell. It just ain't Fantasia. However, she sang it well. Great! At least she saved herself.   Her second song was Summertime. When we heard Ryan announcing the song name, we felt very apprehensive. Fantasia did that song last time and it wowed everyone. What if she can't do as well as last time? The judges are so gonna critisize. Luckily, our worries were very unfounded. She performed the song very well, as good as she did last time, if not better. YaY!  Her final song was Tamayra Gray's song (I forgot the title, and I don't want to go to the AI webbie to check it out. The winner has already been announced...I don't wanna spoil myself). Both finalists have to sing that song. Oh my lord!!! Fantasia did the song loads and loads of justice! She sang it wonderfully great! WOW! She sang it with such a powerful voice, filled with rich emotions! She's just like what the song described. Successful. She cried at the end of her song. I was crying too. Amanda too. We were so so so touched by her song. Oh my god! What a fantastic singer! She holds the honor of being the FIRST singer to make me cry. The best man! I am so buying her album once it hit the shelves!  I went to bed with a smile and watery eyes.  Hmm. Today is rather boring, so I will not talk about today.  Oh my!! The results are gonna show later! Who will win!! Who will win!! Oh my lord!! I am so excited!  Alright..I gotta go. See ya next time with the results!! Night blog! TaTa!

First, I was interviewed by the Exco for being in the committee. Hmm. I did suckily. Not my usual standards, I am afraid. Oh well.  Hmm. There wasn't any real practice session. They spilt up into 4 groups of 10. These are the groups for the choir camp. I rather like my group. Yeah. Got Faizal, David, Boon Chai, Dorothy, Serene, BiXia, Alicia, YunYi and Yvonne. HaHa!

Ayiah...I no mood to write about today la! I am very excited. In Professor Sun's class, I am participating in this Time Race. Prof Sun will post questions every Tuesday, America's time. I would aways see the questions in Wed night my time, and our group are always not as early to send in our answers, thus we are denied of any galleons. Today, I finally saw the questions first!! FIRST! I quickly did the quiz and sent it to our captain, who hopefully woke up already, would log on and send the answers over to Prof. Quick Quick! We have to win some galleons this week!! She hasn't woken up yet!! QUICK!!!  Er-hmm! I am too excited le la...and too tired. HaHa! I think I go sleep le. See ya next time. Night blog. TaTa!

      Heya! The funeral's over...  Hmm. Lets start with  Saturday .  Yes. After that blog, we went for lunch, then went on down to the funeral.   Wow! The first thing I noticed is that there's a big house for MaMa, even got two servants. I gave all the servants figureines names, like MingYue, CaiXia, XiaoDengZi. :P The adults are, again, looking for numbers to buy for 4D. Meow moo.  Hmm. They were preparing the 'treasure chests' thingy. While digging stuff (documents) to put inside the chests to burn, we found a lot of interesting documents like TaiMa's (MaMa's mother) birth cert, MaMa's children birth info (the respective pieces was given to the children) and even photos of YeYe (GrandDad, aka MaMa's husband). He looked so smart. His name is Yip Ya Bin (written behind the passport-sized photo). Even FeiChui hasn't seen him before. They say that his favorite grandson is Ah Meng. Heh.   After preparing the chests, we had nothing else to do le. Luckily, I brought my Discman and listened to music all afternoon. Oh yes. Reading my HZGG too.   Hmm. This time they offered to buy dinner for us. Ah Meng went to buy all our orders. I got chicken rice. We are eating at 5+, because the priest is supposed to come at 6 and start the rites.   Noticed I said supposed. He came later, and rites have to start at 7. Well, the rite wasn't special or anything. Wait till you hear about the next rite, which is due to start at 10. Sigh. We are bored again. I listened to my Discman while Father entertained his friend (whom according to Mother, introed Father to taxi-driving). Brother and I burnt some incense during a prayer.   At 10, the rite was touching. The priesta were talking about the hardhips of life, about rearing up children who are now kneeling in front of her (I didn't know most of the words, except the children part. They spoke too fast!) Their voices were carrying sad emotions, they can even cry on the spot. I think they have trained real hard. That made DaiGuMa and GuJie cry. SuZhen was tearing, and so was FeiChui. Me? I was pretty touched, but my leg hurts so much. Imagine sitting there for 30 minutes...my left leg was terribly numb.   After the rite, it was time to burn all the incense and the house and the nucais for MaMa. Yeah. YiGuMa was in shock, because she keep repeating monotonously "MaMa come get your things..MaMa come get your things.." The head priest said the burning was good, everything was dispersed. Whatever that meant. Heh.   After that, we took taxi back home. Yeah. After bathing at 11+, I went to sleep.    SUNDAY - TODAY   The chu bin. The cremation day.   We woke up at 5. I was feeling very crabby all morning, because goddmanit, this's a Sunday! I guess Friday's long rest was to sacrifice for today. Sigh. We went to Whampoa to eat breakfas.t I ate chee cheong fun.   Heh. Talk about being there puntually at 7. We were the only punctual cats there! The rest began to come at 7.30+. Yeah.   The rites began at 8. Lets skip that until the rite at 9. The final rite for MaMa. We walked around the coffin. We said our goodbyes. She looked so peaceful. (I just realized that MaMa and DaiGuMa looked alike. I couldn't picture MaMa's face without DGM's face in my mind.) The grandchildren kneel at one side, the children and spouses at the other. Then, people begane to cry. Father was one of them. All these days of pent-up grief was let out today...he cried real pitifully. I wanna go over and hug him...but this is a proper rite after all.   The coffin was then loaded into the hearse and off it goes. Dad, DaiPakPak and YiPakPak put their hands on the hearse and walked with it. Looking at PaPa, I saw him as MaMa's son. A real filial son. Yeah. After walking for awhile, we took the bus to Mount Vernon Crematorium.  Yeah. After waiting for awhile, we went into the hall. We prayed, offer incense..then it was off to the burning. The process was terribly quick. I don't even have time to react before the coffin was pushed into the burning thingy. Just...like woosh. After that, we went back lor.  We offered some incense to her plaque, then the grandchildren went down while the children and their spouses stay for prayer. I was picking rubbish around the funeral area, then I went up lor.  Sigh. The prayer was over, and he was giving instructions. Anyway, we stayed for a long while. I learnt that YiGuJiu (husband for Yi Gu Ma) is very formidable. He controlled DaiPakPak with the money (ayiah...that DPP is a big gambler..we have to control how much he takes every month, or else he will spend all the money and have to depend on us for moolah. Who wants to provide for him wor!) collected from the donations ($6000+ in total...woah!). He is very strict lor. I see him very powerful and formidable. I bet he is a strict father. He even told his wife to "diam diam" when she was making too much noise. ~Eyebrow raised~  Anyway, after that, we stayed for awhile, then went off for lunch lor. Lunch is at AMK Central. Yeah.   Coming back, I bathed then do my homework. After that, I watched my recorded tapes and then came online lor. Yeah. I ate dinner just now (duck brought at NTUC FairPrice). Here I am.  Well. My thoughts about the whole thing? There are 2 main ones.   One, this whole thing happened too fast and sudden for me to register her death. It's like...one minute I was in lecture, then the next minute I recieved news that MaMa died. Then, the days just swooped past real quick ..and barely a blink of an eye, she was cremated. I am like still in shock lor...I couldn't cry at all.... I don't know why. Am I heartless? Nah.. I still feel sad...but...I can't cry.   Two, this whole funeral affairs let me know more about my family from the father's side. I initally don't know a lot of people...which cousins belong to which aunty/uncle. I know them all, even the cousins which I never remembered meeting before. I even knew the proper names of the uncles and aunties. Heh.   Yeah. I think that's all. Woah! Such a long blog wor! Heh Heh. I think I go le. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!

      Heya! Even the funeral cats are meowing away.  Okie. Back to the topic. Yesterday morning was shuang. I slept until 10! That was shiok! Finally! I got my 11 hours of well-deserved rest!   Okay. After that, waking up, eating breakfast, coming online, er..we went to lunch? Then we picked up PoPo and went to the funeral lor.  Yeah. It was quite boring, actually. We folded the incense all afternoon. The gold ingot. The tube-thingy. HaHa. I had fun. I discovered that our family is closest with FeiChui's family. Heh Heh. Oh well.  Edwin and Father went home to bath at 4+, leaving me and Mother there. Then, at 5.55, we went out to eat lor. I ate fish noodles. Yeah. When we came back, we found out that they brought food for us. We didn't tell them we are going out to eat. Sigh.   Yeah. After, I folded some more ingots till Father and Edwin came back. Then we went to burn some incense for MaMa. We were soon joined by Cousin SuFen and SuZheng. Wah...All of us burned a lot of stuff, and even the adults have to tell us to stop burning. Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, in goes the incense. The fire was big.   Yeah. After that was terrible boredom. Father's friends came, then Mother's friends. I was left at the table with BakLiong (Felicia's mother) and Edwin. I started to read my HZGG. Yeah.   Soon, BL's friend came. I was reading XiaoYanZi's really funny line (she was pondering about zi san ma huai) and started laughing out loud. Heh.  At 10 something, we left by taxi. We were all so tired to take the bus back. Yeah. We reached home at 11 something, bathed, and I went to sleep.   That's all blog. See ya next time. TaTa!

      Heya. Sorry. I got major news. Okay. What happened on Wendesday? Oh yes. Sports Day. It was okay. Bellini is in third placem, horray hooray.   Okay. Today today today. This whole even started with a call from Dad during Physics lecture. I knew something went terribly wrong with Grandmother (MaMa, for short), because Dad would never call unless it was an emergency. I began to get tensed up, lost my concentration.   When I called my father, he confirmed my worst fear. She passed away. Oh my lord...she didn't even get the chance to meet us. She has been wanting to meet me and my brother...   I began to sign out. That admin idiot said something along the lines of "did you tell your parents school is more important?" HELLO! School more important than my grandmother? Fuck you! Anyway, she gave me the form in the end. I have to wait til 1 to get Mr Tham's signature to sign out. He agreed immediately when he heard that my grandmother passed away. What a good teacher!   Yeah. Parents were there le. We went to Grandma's place la. It was full of other relatives. MaMa...she looked so frail... I just said I've come to see her...everyone was sad.   We were waiting for the coroner to pronounce her death. He came, and he concluded that she died due to hypertensive heart attack. Oh my... Funeral arrangements were quickly made. Here's the lowdown. We are holding the funeral till Sunday morning 9.30, when her body leaves for the crematorium. Yeah.   Everyone was crying. Okay. Not everyone. Dai Gu Ma and Dai Pak Pak cried the loudest, and sadest too. They keep mentioning that mu brother and I have came to see her (she wants to see us ma)...and like neglecting the other cousins like that. I kinda felt guilty. Yeh...I was like just stoning...dunnoe what to react. Or how.   We went out to eat lunch at Whampoa. Oh god! My hunger was killing me!! I ate fantasic duck rice. How meowful! I got a stomachache due to over-eating, but oh well.   When we went back, MaMa's body was taken to some parlour to beautify. Yeah. We stayed around waiting for the funeral tent to be set up. Sigh.. Lets skip the boring hours till the tent was set up.  Okay...Her body arrived at 6+. It was really decorated nicely with a pearl in her mouth. I have to wear the white t-shirt. Zhang shun ma. It looks like only me, my brother and Fei Chui were the only children of MaMa's sons. We get the black cloth thingy to paste on our sleeves. The rest of the cousins are blue.   Anyway, there were rites. Yeah. Very long ones. Sigh. I don't even know what we were supposed to do half of the time. Anyway, after the rites, we milled around lor. I helped fold some yingbo (incense?).   Ya know, I am only open to two cousins. Fei Chui and Ah Ling. The rest ma, I don't talk to them de lor. HaHa!   We went home at 7.30+. We first went to eat at AMK Central, chicken rice. Then we went home. The rest, they say, is history. Tomorrow we are going back in the afternoon. Yeah. No school for me for tomorrow and Sat. I get to wake up REAL late! YaY!  YAY!! Fantasia and Diana are in the Top 2!! I am so happy!!  Okay. I go off le. See ya next time. TaTa. Night blog!

      Heya! HaHa! This is very de late le!  Okay. I will start from  MONDAY .  Monday ar? What happened? Oh yes. I was really really bored while waiting for CQ and Gloria. I wished I've brought a book or my Discman!   Okay. Choir came! YaY! We got this really good new instructor. Her name? I forgot le. She gave us the impression that she's similar to Miss Choo. Really leh. She's just like Miss Choo! So nice and friendly! Okay. She's the Chinese version of Miss Choo. HaHa!   Yeah. She tested our voices. To see where she would put us. Hmm. I was put in tenor leh. When she heard my voice, she guessed I would be in tenor. I said Liew put me in bass. Oh weel. She tested me. I was made to sing loudly. HaHa! She said I can reach the tenor notes, and higher, but I don't dare (the last part I said it myself. HaHa). Yeah. YaY! CQ's in tenor too. After that, we waited for a whole hell of a time for Gloria. Yeah. We went back together lor.   Oh yes! I forgot to tell you that Siva finally managed to talk to Gerald Law. HaHa. After one big wild goose chase (chasing someone named Gerald Ng), I finally located Siva's classmate. HaHa! Siva's real happy, and I am glad I can make her happy! :)  Ayiah...that Gloria and CQ. Here is the hint la: Things are not what they seem. Only the observant knows. Yeah! See! You guys are lucky.   Okay. What else? Err...moving onto  TUESDAY  then.   Okay. Today, I got back two tests. Well, the other one is not exactly a test. Yesterday, I did a GP Compre test! Guess what? I passed!! WEEE! I am so happy with myself and my paraphrasing skills! YaY! Mr Jeremy said my summary was good! YaY!   The second good news was that my group's proposal was finally approved!! YaY!! Poor thing CQ though, his topic was rejected terribly. Yeah.   Today hor, during mass PE, I re-ran 2.4km. Ayioh. I ran 17.08mins, just like yesterday. I actually ran faster, because I took time off to chat and didn't run towards finishing line. Yeah. Meow meow!   HaHa! CQ is getting isomnia! You ar! Go sleep la! Not good for your body de. Heh Heh.   kay. What else to talk about? Ayioh...I dunnoe what to say le. My mind is feeling ultra-tired right now. I think I go off le la. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!

      Oh my meowing meow cat! I almost forgot to blog today! HaHaHa!   Okay. Yesterday we went to bowl la. Well, before that I went to the doctors. Guess what's on my banned list now. Ice Lemon Tea! AHHH! My ILT!   Okay. We went to bowl. There're me, CQ, Joyce, Gloria, SL, KS, ChiYuan and TZ. Yeah. HM, Janet, ShinHan and Kent Kent came later. Yeah.  Okay. We played three rounds. I got real tired after that, not to mention my hand was aching. Okay. The first round was terrible, as my balls keep cleaning the gutter. Towards the end, I striked! YaY! The second game I did quite well, though I started to stumble at the end. The last one leh, I was pretty average. I was getting real tired and sian le. Yeah. You can actually plot a graph. The graph slowly goes up..then with a very steep slope, it shoots to the top, then stables for a while (but rising). When it reaches the peak, it started falling, but not too drastically. Yeah. I am so bo liao right?  SL and Joyce went off first. We went to the foodcourt to eat. Ayioh....Gloria go and tell everyone I cannot eat this, cannot eat that. I must talk to her about this. Everyone went to the foodcourt because of me la. I ate chicken with centuary egg porridge. Firstly, it is HORRIBLE! Ginger slices were added, and you won't believe the horrendous amount! I thought they only add ginger in fish porridges to get rid of the yu xin wei (well, for me right, the yu xin wei is normal to me lor. There is no 'smell' people are prone to complain about. Ginger in porridges spoil the entire porridge due to its disgusting taste...I prefer fish and FISH ONLY). How dare they add that in my meat porridge!! I have to take the drastic route. It made me seem like a crass little cat, but I have to do it for the sake of my sanity! Whenever I chance upon a slice, I would pick it up. Long fingernails really come in handy! Heh Heh!   Okay. After that, we went down to look for SL and Joyce, fitting SL's glasses. We waityed for awhile, then went off! My wallet broke!! Ahhh!! How!!   We took 960 back. Me, Janet, Gloria and KentKent orignally planned to walkback home, but alas! It was raining! We decided to go to Causeway Point to escape the rain, while the guys are shopping. (Actually, me and CQ are not very socialable with the guys. We prefer to hang out with the girls. Like when hanging around with the guys I feel very awkward. All they talk about does not interest me at all. I am not the typical male lor. I feel more natural with the girls. Yeah... meow!) We saw the guys when coming down from Level 2, and we hid ourselves. HaHa!   Yeah. After some drinks-buying, we went back home lor. Once reaching home, I immediately went out to eat, in order to watch 8 Simple Rules. After watching that, I went to bath and came online.  Yeah. At 8, me and Father went to Woodlands Central to buy my wallet! Alas! The shop was closed, and the other shops didn't sell any wallet that I like. We went back home, and I suffered two mosquito bites! Ahhh! What nasty creatures!    Sunday : The Next Day   Hmm! What a touching Huan Zhu Ge Ge episode again! I am crying and crying, and is forever crying at HZGG! I did my chinese book review on them. Really! I went to borrow the books! I finished with one today, and is currently reading another! What a nice book!  Hmm. I also did my Maths homework. That uncute Tham is such a killer.   YaY! My parents brought me a new wallet (same brand and design, Polo Genuine) and a Discman! YaY! A Discman with remote contorl, can play MP3s.. Cheh, you all think. I love my Discman! Meow!! What a slim, sleek, black Discman!   Eee! I have to cut my fingernails for that Discman de leh! My fingernail have been left alone for 4+ months! Espeically my  left thumb! Such a beautiful long nail! Of course I saved it la. JiaHao will gloat over it! Ahh! My nail!  YaY! I will have my ATM Card! There's a little thief in my house! That stupid brother. Think I dunnoe issit? My safe's position was shifted, my parents said they didn't touch it. My money pile seems to be lower. It was lower! I didn't have so little money left! He stole from me because he can't steal from my parents anymore, when they found out their money was dissappearing and he was the top suspect. We even found concrete evidence, but he kept denying. Now, I am recording every deposit and withdrawal I made to my safe! For extra safety precaution, I am depositing every $20 I saved in my bank, and applying for an ATM Card, so I can deposit and withdrawl at my whim. Heh! I really hate thieves! My money!!! Don't ever let me catch him stealing..or else he will shi te bu hao kan!  Okay. I go sleep liao. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog! (2 minutes to spare till midnight! HaHa!)

      Heya! I am now listening to Can You Keep You A Secret by Utada Hikaru. Nice sia! Long time never listened to it le. "Can you a keep a secret? Can you keep a secret? Oh kokomana, secret!" :P  Hmm. What happened today? Yeah. Today's bascially quite slack la. Like all Fridays. HaHa!   Okay. Morning quite boring, except that we were almost late for morning assembly. Luckily we just got there at the command (whatever is that spelt). Hmm. Chem lecture was okay.  Yay! No GP! Well, technically not. He just came in 30 minutes to revise with us comprehension skills, then went off to take the drama cats to their SYF. We just have to finish one worksheet, then can go off le. Me and CQ walked past WQ's and Janet's classroom (do you know their GP class is side-by-side? coolies!). HaHa!   Hmm. For MT hor. He found out that CQ 'copied' me la, for book review. Hmm. He got sharp eyes. I didn't say anything la, but oh well. I don't wanna say anything like "I am innocent" because I would get CQ into trouble. So, qing qing lor. Hmm. Got what also? Nothing else le.  After that, CQ went for his weekly exercise and I went to find Janet. Hmm. The teachers next to us were making jokes about Mr Quek. Yeah. So bad one...we decided to leave. CQ was soon done, so was Gloria.  We went to Causeway Point to eat (oh my lord! So itchy! Itch Itch Itch!). I ate duck porridge, following Gloria. HaHa. I got three ulcers in my mouth leh, and close to each other some more. So painful! I can only eat those non-spicy, plain food. Chillies are killers on ulcers. Yeah. The duck porridge there is damn nice man! Okay..after eating, we all went home.   Okay. Bascially what I did at home? I immediately plonked down on mah bed and started sleeping. HaHa. Pig! After that, it is terribly boring la.   YaY! Rupert won the second million dollar prize! YaY for him! Go Rupert! Oh yes! I forgot to mention about yesterdaty's AI results! America has done it again! They've voted off LaToya London, and putting Fantasia in the second-last placings! Oh my lord! I thought Jasmine was going (and she should...Diana, Fantasia and LaToya are too good!). Stupid right? Well, no surprise who's going next week. The two finalists I am predicting: Fantasia and Diana. Fun fact: They are both from Group 1, who entered the finalists together. Hopefully, they are ending together too! :)  Ahh! I am so tired le. I think I go sleep le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Ergh! Just now the stupid computer go and delete my IE window! Qi shu wor!  Anyway, Wendy said she miss me. Heh. Yeah..we are leading two very busy lives, and hardly even have time to chat with each other. The only lnk between us is our blogs. HaHa. Yeah.. I miss her too what. I also feel quite guilty leh..like I am the last to know everything that happened to her. Yeah. Like not really being there for her (like I got help like that! HAHA! I always don't know how to say the rights things de la). Yeah...Ayiah, I am crapping la. So, yeah... I miss Wendy too, just so you know.  Yeah. That Tham ar! I don't find him cute anymore. He hor! He's dissappointed with our class la. For this week, he suddenly did a 360-degrees change! He became totally cold towards our class..and our class only lor. This is like ergh. I hate maths lessons this week. They are so cold! Brr! He hor, also very guo fen leh. Dissappointment is one thing. Targetting our group is another. He got mad at us and shouted lor. Like, what the heck! We all figured that he's mad because GekLing and her group isn't performing up to his standard..the same thing goes for the class. He isn't being professional like that leh...wearing his emotions on his sleeves when he teach. Ergh!   Er...what to comment? I dunnoe what to say le. Ayiah...mainly I am blogging so late. I think I end this blog with these two big events la. Yeah. So see ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!

      Okay. Wow! I came into Blogger, and I was blown away. It has a totally new look, and totally new way of blogging. Well, not new way. Not to Wendy at least. (Ha! I don't know why I suddenly mention her! :P to Wendy) Her format was almost smiliar to this thingy. For me, I needa get used to it.  Okie. Yesterday was Monday. Got new things? I did NAFA. Cheh. Disappointing in the sit-and-reach section. Oh well. The rest I hardly care.   During GP, that disgusting idiot (who else? MCP Meng Hau la) accused me of copying his group's answer for the Vocab Quiz. Oh please lor. Like they spelt correctly. I didn't even told Ben (the one writing the answer) anything, and we got it right somemore. Shoosh. They also know how to spell "coup de grace" (coo-de-gras)! They must have heard it while I was telling Ben the spelling! Fang si! Our group are the only groups that got it right, and they were sitting in front of us! Idiots! How dare they copy! Accusing me of copying somemore! Hypocrite!  Okay. During Choir, we recieved the news officially that Mr Liew is not gonna be our conductor anymore. Yeah. We were approached by Jeryl this morning, but we didn't sign anything. Yeah. Basically it is due to differences that built up over time. They even invited Mr Quek and Mr Tay to come explain. Mr Quek was funny..and so long-winded! I wanna watch my Survivor la! Yeah... After that, Jeryl and his friend wanted to quit choir, citing wanting to join Sports (train up for NS...ergh). Obviously, they are escaping. Lame reason if you ask me. Yeah.   Okay. Amber won Survivor! YaY! She was in the Final 2 with Rob. Rob even proposed on the revealing of results itself. Yeah. Ayiah..no matter the outcome, both of them will get the 1 million lor. Cheh. Heh heh! Amber even gave a car to Shii Ann! YaY! I am happy with the results, but I wished some other cats would be in the Final 2 instead. Like Kathy, Rupert, or even Shii Ann. Yeah.  Okie. Today. During GP, that MH irritated us again. We discussed on university entry and the class feels that JC students should get into U auto (unrealistic dreams...but ahh well...we can dream right). Yeah, tat idiot even butt in and said that poly students should not go to the university. WHAT THE FUCK! I got lotsa friends there lor! Are you saying every one of my friends is not good enough for Uni? So what if you got into JC? Does it gives you the authority to lord that pathetic fact over others? Please la...you are even a repeat student. My friends can do thousands time better than you, idiot! I didn't actually hear that statement (I heard it from CQ), I was too busy elsewhere, but there were cries of "That's unfair" in CQ's group (they all are anti-MH...I wanna join them!). He even made some stupid statement later, and Diana said loudly "You are narrow-minded" Wow! Coolies! I have been wanting to tell him that face to face! I admire her man! Next time, I should do that! Go on, you idiot MCP. Open your big mouth, sprout some nonsense, and I will make sure you will regret the moment you talked! Make my day!  Ergh. Qi xiao, qi xiao. There are better things to write than that idiot. Okay. One very very good piece of news. I GOT THE LETTER FROM RSS! Did I tell you anything? I dunnoe. I don't think so. Basically right, a few weeks ago, my friends received an invitation from RSS to go to RSS Award Ceremony to receieve some prize. I didn't get any...so I lost hope about 2-3 days of waiting. Yeah. I thought they were rewarding those who top their respective subjects in the Prelims. Well, apprently, they are also rewarding the 5As cats! YaY!! I was so happy when Father told me I got a letter from Riverside! YaY! I called almost everyone. CQ and WQ were indifferent (hmp!) and Siva, Joyce, Hann and Gloria were glad for moi! YaY! I get to skip Maths Lecture test too! HaHa! Tomorrow must ask CK if he got or not. He should get it one de la. So should Ping. We got 5As. If I got, why shouldn't they? Yep! :D I am so darn happy!   Yay! Okay, stop it KY. Yeah. I gotta go now. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!  EDIT: Ahh! I changed my layout and everything! There's this little function called "Comments". You can click on the link "comment" after every post (starting from this) and choose to add your comments about me post. Heh.

      HaHa! I graduated from writing every two days to every three days! HaHa!   Okay. Friday. Friday morning we had Chem Lecture Test! Oh my lord! I spent most of my time on the 20 MCQ qns, leaving me with no time to do the 10-marks worth structured questions! Ergh!! Stupid la! Hmm...in the afternoon, we were spent doing PW proposal. HaHa! I made CQ and Gloria wait for me...heh heh. Actually, I told them not to wait when I realized that I am not gonna go off early. Yeah. We actually scanned in the proposal form and then typed words in there. Crazy us! But we loved our final result a lot! HaHa! Great job to us all!  Okay. Sat morning we had a Maths Lecture tests. Things were not looking good here, sweetie. After the test, we went to so many places, including Ten Mile Junction. HaHa. We found a $5 note in the rubbish bin, and WQ actually picked it up. Okay. I got hold of the note eventually. HaHa. We pledged to donate that to some organization we happen to chance upon later. They went to Woodlands Stadium to train their running. I was the Timer. HaHa. After the training, we went to eat at Causeway Point. Hmm. I donated that note to a person collecting donations for the Children's Society. According to Gloria, the guy's expression was really shocked (I didn't see, coz i was too busy slotting in that note, and he is so tall). HaHa!   We went back home. I went back with an additional item. CQ's EZ-Link Card. HaHa! Yeah. We are supposed to go for the class BBQ. We are meeting GekLing at Clementi  to get to Debra's condo. Yeah. I was so tired that I slept that afternoon. For an hour though. Then I went online and after that, watched my taped Pokemon.   Yeah. I met CQ at the Marsiling station, then we went to Clementi lor. I was reading my newly-brought Charmed book, Inherit A Witch. Yeah. We saw Meng Hau and gang at the platform. What luck. That MH is a laughing stock! He has absolutely no fashion sense at all! His skin-tight pants doesn't suit him, neither does his tiny little bag. A big-sized person like him with such a small bag? Ergh...wrong picture people! He saw my book and asked if I watched Charmed. I replied yes tersely and expected some misogynist-remarks coming out of his mouth. Well, he said something like "they go around blowing people up like this (mimicks Piper)" He got the facts wrong. Not THEY. Only Piper. What an insult to Charmed! Whatever la. Crap. We met GekLing, Zahiah and Jul and got onto bus 154.  We arrived at the condo soon after. We saw Kelvin, JiaHao and Debra. The two guys were half-naked, and I thought they went swimming. It turns out that they have been feeling hot and took off their shirts. Anyhoo, we started to grill chicken wings. It's really hard work grilling them! HaHa. MCP commented "I really hand it to you guys (me adn CQ)! So good cooks! I never stepped into the kitchen, so I don't know anything about cooking". I replied sarcarstically (with low breath, but the people surrounding me can hear), "Yeah, because you didn't want to step into one. Shoosh". Kelvin laughed and said "That's why you don't support house-husbands right?"   It was sure hard work girlling chicken wings, but it is harder grilling hot dogs and crab meats. Damn. They take a long time to grill, and you can't place them on the girll itself, or else they will blackened. Yeah. It was around 7.30+ then I got to eat. John joined us then. After eating, me and CQ were like loitering around, playing card games and such. We wanted to book the pool table, but someone else have booked it liao. No pool for us. Hmm. They were also trying to dunk people into the pool. HaHa! After that, to clear the food, we played Zhong Ji Mi Ma. I kena once, and have to eat some of the really spicy stingray! Oh my lord! Hot hot hot hot!! After all the food has been gobbled, we cleaned up. Hmm. We went off at 11.   Me and CQ waited for bus 963, while the others took a different bus home. Hmmm. That MH was very naggy, saying something like "Be careful hor! Must xiao xin" and all that crap. I repled back sarcarstically "Don't worry. I won't fall down!" Such a nag. We waited quite a while for the bus to come, then even a longer while to reach Woodlands Interhchange. By that time, I've finished with my book. I reached home at 12am+. HaHa. Yah. I had fun there! :)  Okay. Today was quite okay. Huang Ah Ma finally came to persuade them to come! Oh my god! It was to touching! I was bascially tearing away for the entire episode! So touching! Okay Okay. I completed my GP essay and my Phys tutorial and my Maths homework. Hmm. Good for moi!   Die le la. Tomorrow's NAPTA. I dun think I can pass Standing Broad Jump and chin ups. Mian qiang I can pass Shuttle Run and Sit-Ups. I am so passing Sit-And-Reach. Yeah. Ayiah...why say die le la. I don't even care anyway. Shoosh.   HaHa. I just chatted with Ben. I felt it was so silly to even have fights now. So childish. So I decided to talk to him lor. Say hi. Actually, I have been considering that long ago, but only today I got so sick of my cowardice that I IMed him lor. HaHa. He was very surprised that I was talking to him. It turns out that he has been planning to resolve our differences, but like me, he don't have the guts to do anything about it. Oh well. Sometimes in life, you have to take the initiative and say hi. You will never get anything done if you keep deliberating. So yeah. HaHa. Glad to be talking to him again. Meow!  So yep. I gotta go sleep liao. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!

      Heya! Hmm. 2 days le. 2 very busy days. HaHa. I am forever busy de la, you say. Yeah, correct lor.   Wed what was I doing? Basically nothing lor. We went to this Habits course. It's a good course, the lecturer is real nice and all. Yeah. I was doing my Chinese homework at night, then rushed online at 9 to check stuff for project work. Yeah. Do you know? For reading an article at NewsLink, the school have to pay $2? 2 bucks per article viewed. Wow!   Today, Mr Tham said that by signing your 2 years at a JC, you are signing out your free time. Yeah. He's damn right. I have hardly a time for leisure at weekends now, provided, of course, I have no homework for the next day. I just came online after doing my Chem titration calculations. Ergh! Anyway, he's funny today. Yeah. He calls our homework "ta pao" and he really went to label the maths problems "T.P. 1 and T.P. 2"! Oh my god! He's so funny and cute! We laughed when we saw the labels lor. What a funny teacher! HAHAHA! :D  Ayioh! Die le la. Tomorrow got Chem test. I didn't really study. Wait. Let me rejurigate the hydrocrarbon combustion equation [CxHy + (x + y/4)O2 --> xCO2 + (y/2)H2O]. Okay. That one done. Yeah. Redox. Must know the equations de leh. Ayiah...so idioitc. I never memorized, and I think I will do it tomorrow la. Ayiah..the test is actually during our lecture, and that's the first period of the day. How to study? Meow la!  Today I went home after Chem tutorial with Zahiah (correct spelling? Dunnoe..too lazy to take out class list and check) and Aisha. HaHa. Zahiah and me take the same bus back (964/913) and she stops at the stop before Admiralty. HaHa. Yay! Finally someone in our class living near moi. Heh Heh!   Damn it. I feel so tired. I still got unfinished businesses! Darn! Okay...I gotta get going. See ya later! Night blog!

      Heya! Okay....I really haven't been blogging. Ayioh...I got a perfectly good reason for this ar.  You see, there is this Sasser worm that was spreading now right? Well, it started on 1st May..and I was very unlucky enough to get hit on the very day it started. Yeah..basically right, whenever I switched on my computer, 15 minutes later, the virus will strike and command an auto-shutdown of the computer within a minute. This is such a vicious never-ending cycle. Sigh! Anyway, on Sunday, Uncle Steven came and installed XP Pro for me, which is supposedly better la. Yeah. On Monday, Microsoft releashed a patch, which I downloaded and cure the problems. So yay!  Sat what happened? Oh yeah. I went down to play badminton with the cats la. Got lotsa people there. Hmm. That Joyce ar! Go and announce that I like WQ. Ayioh! I said times and times again, it was a joke. Made me so embarassed some more. That WQ exclaimed "KY liked me ar?" Anyway, after that was lunch, which was pretty spicy. HaHa. Okay...after that me, KS, WQ went to Hann's house to watch Miss Congeniality. What a nice show! "If only I have a brain!" HAHAHA! After that, we went to take a NeoCard. What a nice NeoCard! HaHa! I am keeping it in one of my photoframes. HaHa.  Okay. Sunday. Nothing much to report on. My computer was basically much cleaned. Well, the downloaded installations are there, but I have to reinstall the files all over again. Hmm. Will do  that when I am ultra-free. Most prob on a weekend. Yep.  Okay. Monday's PE was surprisingly moderate. I am glad it was not heavy. Yeah. Monday's choir was cancelled due to the absence of Mr Liew, so yay. Oh yes. Remind me to tell Gerald Ng Siva said hi. Yes. When we were walking home, we have very interesting conversations. Now now, I wouldn't reveal what it is. It has been a real eye-opener for some, laughs for everyone. Yeah. That basically sums it up. :)  Today hor...the mass PE was a horror again. Well, I managed to skip doing jumping jacks, which was real crafty of me. Yay to me! Okay. Today was not so bad. We got a Physics lecture test, and I am fairly confident that I can pass. Yeah. What else? I hate Meng Hau. Okay. Check. Oh yes. I completed me homework before coming online. Yay for me as well.   Okay. I am tired le. Yeah. I will end this blog. See ya next time! Night blog!

      Sigh. Okay. Here goes today.  Heh. Okay. Today Gloria-scaring has taken on new heights! Yes! Janet has proudly joined the team! Now there are two scarers! HaHaHa! I originally planned to change it to Thursday instead, to drop her guards and do a proper scare on Thursday. However, the fates (8 Days Horoscope) informed me that Thursday is a bad choice, because Piceans will fall out will their friends areound end of the week. So there are no changes. Hmm! Me and Janet planned another strategy for tomorrow use! Heh Heh!  Right. Okay. We were almost late for Physics. Luckily we were not. Sigh. Paper 1 sucks. Tricky questions. 1/3 of the questions were done by guessing. Rather, logical guessing. Oh well. Sigh.  Paper 2 ain't that much better. Short questions kinda sucks. The long questions ain't better either. Sigh. Fail le la. I only know the forces question. That I am confident of scoring. Only. Pathetic.   Okay. Went home. I am planning to study Gas Law later. Then tomorrow I would have only Chem Bonding to study. Yeah. And there's another fic waiting for me. Sigh. Not slash this time though. Yeah.  I think I go study Gas Law. See ya next time! Oh yes! There's cause for celebration tomorrow! YAY! Even ducks and cats are meowing and celebrating the end of exams! Wee-woo! Right. TaTa! Night blog!

      O.O! My my my! What a day!  Okay. In the morning, regrettably (not), I did not study for Maths. Ayiah! I find it hard to study during the morning de! Or the night. Sigh! I memorized the R-Formula though. YaY! Good job to me!  Hmm. Today I tried to scare Gloria again. Heh. I gave myself away because I was laughing and laughing. Heh Heh! I got a new plan tomorrow! I cannot reveal, in case Gloria reads it tomorrow! Yes! I got a devious plan!!   Okay. We are meeting CQ and WQ at CCK. We met CQ on the train. That terrible WQ idiot! Don't know how to ling huo ying bian! Don't even think analytically! Planned carefully when he arrives. But please! Like he knows the scheldule of the trains! He still dares blame the train being late somemore! HELLO! Trains don't have fixed schedules! Don't even know how to think out of the box one leh! Yesterday's comprehension taught us to set some time for emergency (that's why I find it easy. I am already doing that everytime. I know perfectly well what's the passage's saying!). He obviously did not follow its advice! Ayioh!!!! That freaking guy! He complains everyone being late leh! However, he is, most often than not, the one who is late! HAIYOH! How can he complain about others when he himself is late? Totally immoral, I tell ya! If he's doing it tomorrow, we will set off without him! He will not make it big with that kind of stuck-in-the-box mindset! Think everyone/thing is supposed to work for him, go with his wishes, want the train come then they will come. Ha! What does he think he is? 'Yoh! I am terribly pissed!  Okay. Enough about him. I did not eat a proper lunch. A dessert. Chinchow with longan. I find the one at the Woodlands Central nicer. Meow. Janet joined us. After lunch, we have to rush up to buy eraser for Gloria. Then rush down to catch buses. We were almost late.   Okay. Onto the maths paper. Sigh. Fail le la. Okay. I spent too much time on the front questions, totally neglected the last few questions. I did not do the last two ones, so 13 marks gone. For the third last, I know how to do, but I have no time! Qi shi wor! Sigh. Then the earlier questions. One or two I dunnoe. The rest I only know how to do the first part. Sigh. Fail le la!  Okay. We meowed around. Got our 'new' timetable. Nothing's changed, except they added a 0.5h of CT/Assembly between Maths and Mass PE on Tuesday. Sigh. No more break le. Tis okay la. At least all of our scheldule's intact and fine. YaY!   Okay. We got back. Well, I didn't really intensive Physics studying. Just read through the Physics notes. Heh. I even fell asleep once. Oh I meow! HeHe.   Woah! Just now we got blackout wor! The official report is that there was a disruption in the gas supply from Indonesia! O.O Anyhoo, it scared me leh. I was writing the first line (luckily wor!) when the power got cut off.   Okay. The whole house was terribly pitch-black! I can't even see! I later used my phone's light to shin. Woah lao..I need to feel my way through to make it to parents room. I opened the window and see the other blocks were pitch-black too. It's quite serene and quiet. Like very calm. No lights...the sky looked grey. Nice. Torchlights were found. I called CQ they all. O.O! Looks like everyone, except Gloria, were affected. Heh. Lucky girl!  Without the fans, I was sweating all over! All over!! So hot! I quickly went outside to chui feng. We met Edmund and Cara outside. After about 30 minutes (they were the longest 30 minutes of my life! It felt like an hour! Or more), the lights were restored. Everyone cheered! YaY! I quickly came online lor.  Heh Heh. What a night! Meow moo meow! I gotta go now. See ya next time with reports on how scaring Gloria goes! TaTa! Night blog!

      Okay. Today is Chinese exam. Heh. I did no studying for it. Oh meow.  Right. Our exam's in the hall. Well, I am even sitting on the front row. How meowful. Okay. For Paper 1, I did the conversation thingy. Ha! It's about Da Sao not wanting anymore kids due to stress. I had fun writing about the topic. I somehow made my essay funny. Heh. Even CQ commented, "How come all your essays got add some funny bits one?". Ayioh. I figured that if the examiner don't laugh when reading essays, most likely I would get a lousy mark. Might as well make them laugh right? Actually, that's not true. I am not a boot-licker. I just want to be funny. Heh.   Okay. Paper Two's quite ayioh... The first section about filling in the words...Sigh. I only know one word, 'fu' in 'chong dao fu zhe'. Heh Heh. At least it is better than nothing. The rest I found was relatively easy. The comprehension, thankfully, was not a killer. I can actually coherently answer the questions! Usually I would blunder through the passage. Ain't that something? The summary was a killer. I wrote rubbish. Heh. 20 marks ma. Might as well write something.   Okay. After MT's done and over with, we (me, Janet, WQ, CQ and Gloria) went to McDonalds. Somehow, I got an upsized McNuggets EVM for just $4.75! The others were so shocked! I was too. Oh well. I da shen te shen wor! After that, Janet went home and the rest of us went to the library to study Maths.  Stupid ole me forgot to bring the writing pad. I have to go all the way to Popular to buy a pad. Then I helped WQ photocopy some notes, then I went back.   Heh. Am I productive today? Nah-ah. I only did one chapter. ONE chapter on APGP. Heh. Sigh. I die le la, tomorrow. Hann came. I gave him the tape I helped him record. Hmmm. I even helped him buy a Cashcard to photocopy notes from CQ. Oh my meow.   We ended at 4.50+. Oh well. That's all the studying we can take, I guess. Me and Gloria met Esther on the 913 bus. Heh Heh. We chatted and chatted. Oh! Looks like she's in NYJC choir too. Which means our conductor is the same. Heh Heh!   Coming home, I came online. Blah blah. MNI's still not done yet! More than a week of maintenance! BAH! I can't stand it anymore! Meow moo meow moo!!  I recently got this Shareware Image Editor, GIMP. Well, TNP said it works as well as Adobe. Actually not. You can't import backgrounds, can't change the fonts and their colors. Ergh. Is it so hard to make a decent banner?!! Sigh!   Okay. Oh my! I realized that this is the first of many Monday entries that ended before Friends started. YaY! What a wonder!  Oh yes. I just heard this Fact of the Day from Jamie's Say It With Music. It turns out that the state of Michigan in USA has more varieties of trees than the continent of Europe. O.O Interesting! You really learn something new everyday from Say It With Music! Now I sound like Jamie Yeo plugging her own show. Heh Heh.   Okay. I gotta get going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      FUCK!!! My diary entry!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!! FUCK!!!!!!!! Stupid thing!!!!!! AHHHH!   Yesterday   Okay. I am only gonna talk about the concert. My mood's totally destroyed. Right. Me, CQ, Gloria and HuiMin planned to eat dinner. Yes, we did eat dinner. SL joined us. How surprising.  After dinner, we met Janet, PY and Joyce and we proceeded towards YJ. FUCK. Okay. Enough swearing! Okay. En route, I noticed that some twigs resembled a dead rat's tail. So I pointed out "Si Lao Shu!". It made everyone looked and gasp. Heh. A few simple words can cause such a huge pandemonium.   Right. The concert. The first and last song, "Sing and Rejoice" and "One Song Many Voices" respectively, are what our choir is practising. Yes. It sounded quite nice, but the maturity ain't there.   I enjoyed each and every school's performances. They did a good job.  Yes. I have to comment on YJ Chorale. They are the reason (Actually HL is) why I was at the concert yesterday. YJ did well, although I almost fell asleep at some songs. Or maybe I was daydreaming. ;) (That didn't feel right (the typing) the second time round. FUCK! There goes the candidness of this entry!) Anyhoo, I felt the Bass section did especially well. Their voices were clear and good. I didn't hear much of the other sections, SAT, being so distinct. Yeah. Anyhoo, well done YJ Chorale!  Okay. When we came out, we were greeted by the fucking rain. Only three of us (all from Admiralty) and CQ brought umbrellas and there were 8 of us. That rounds up to an umbrella for every two of us. I ended up sharing with CQ, while I lent mine to SL and Joyce. We took the train and went home.    Today   Okay. We went out in the afternoon. We watched Tou Long Zhuan Feng. HAHA! (I feel so fake for putting HAHA! I am NOT in a laughing mood right now. Stupid hangs! Spoil everything...) Her quirkiness and fiesty attitude reminds me of XiaoYan Zi (Ooo! Her initals is XYZ! How funny!). Yes.   Anyhoo, I was also reading this HD slash-mpreg fic,  urlLink (Crying Over) Spilt Potions . MPreg means male pregnancy. Guess who got pregnant? Read and find out! Such a lovely story!  Okay. We went to AMK Central to eat lunch. Then we went to Jubliee Entertainment Centre to make my Popular Discount Card (Fuck again! It seems like my I/C number is written wrongly. The person wrote '7' in my temporary card, but put '9' in the register. Sigh. Have to correct the mistake. Okay. It looks like the cashier typed wrongly. See! Look at the efficiency of Admin people!! I am so never trusting them!) . YaY! I got the 20% Discount thingy.  I used that to buy two books, A Tale of Two Pipers (the last book!! Luckily!) and Artemis Fowl (finally!). That Mother! I placed the 20% discount thingy on the counter and the cashier saw it. My mother felt the need to remind her the existance of the big blatant discount voucher on the counter top. I am sure the cashier got annoyed. I can see it in her eyes. MOTHER!! I hate it when she does that. People have eyes to see! I am sure she will get terribly annoyed when a customer does that to her. I hope someone does (like put a $10 bill on the table and say "There's a $10 bill"). Then she won't do that to others again. Besides, I am the one making the transaction. NOT her. I can make transaction perfectly FINE, without annoying cashiers too, on MY own. Terrible embarassment! I am a firm believer of not offending other people and putting them down. At least not to strangers. If we don't co-exist peacefully, what will the world become?  Right. We went home, I watched Simpson, blah blah blah.  Right. I did no revision. Sigh. Whatever la. Crap.   I gotta get going. Tomorrow's MT. I am sure flunking it. Sucks la. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Oh right. This window has been open since like forever! Actually, I was reading  urlLink The Depths of Winter . Heh Heh. Yeah. Yet another slash. Oh well.  Yes! In the morning, I went to the polyclinic to look at me leg again. Sigh. I knew waiting time's gonna be long. I am almost finish with book 1 of HZGG, so I decided to bring the second book along!   Aha! I was right! I even have time to read 70 pages of book 2. I don't know how much time elapsed. Definitely more than an hour. Yeah.  Well, the doctor was friendly. He's such a nice guy! Oh my my! After that, I went out and was passing by some chairs when I saw Mdm Matthews. She apparently turned her head at that moment and saw me. He exchanged greetings and I went on my way.   Hmm. CQ and I met later. His house was on the way ma, and we are going to the library. Just so coincidentially, we met Gloria while going down the escalators. Heh.   It was a mad rush to the library! The food takes so long to be cooked!! Sigh. Luckily, we managed to grab a table on the 1st floor. We studied Chem. Heh. I was the tutor. I felt so proud of myself. :P Nah, all of us are equally good.   Okay. My cheng qie act still continued. And today, CQ informed me that if I was to call myself cheng qie again, he would be forced to call me *ahem*. Right. That shut my mouth up. *Shudders at the thought* Well, not for long. I became nu pi. Servant. :P Okay. My nonsense still carries on, with pleasure. Heh.  Right. I am also teaching a class on "Overcoming Your Shyness!" for CQ, Gloria and WQ. They are terribly shy! Aiyoyo! I am up to  Chapter 1: Bring Out The Confidence! . Then all of them went off to do their own things. Eating, devotion and whatnot. Sigh. What a rowdy class I have. Naughty pupils!! So adorable!  Right. Now I have to go back to a new fic I am reading.  urlLink Time Out Of Place  Yeah. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Okay. I haven't have much time to go over the day in really full details. Yes! I admit! I am, once again, sucked into the world of fanfiction, this time immersing myself in  urlLink Per Solumn Lacuna: By Words Alone . Terrible! Heh.   Right. I planned to zheng CQ. By making myself his gui fei. The favored concubine, in other words. See. Told ya I am getting more and more disgusting.   HaHA. When I met Gloria, I was planning to zheng her also. She was already down her block awaiting for me. I was surprised. I was planning to greet her when she comes out of the lift. No matter. I ran towards her, do the mock bow-thingy (both hands on the left waist and did a sorta-mini-squat) and exclaimed loudly "chen qie chan jian lao fuo ye. Lao fuo ye qian shui qian shui qian qian shui" (It means "the concubine pays respect to empress dowager. long live the dowager!") Gloria was laughing and laughing and laughing. Heh.   Right. I was about to greet CQ that. Ayioh! He spoilt my fun. I saw WQ and hurried over. He seems to be in a daze. Then, I sense someone besides me. I turned over and saw CQ. I was so shocked to see him there that I forgot my lines! AHHH! Qi shi wo wor!!! Heh. There goes my surprise!   Well, I did tell him later. He was like O.o o.O . Right. Heh Heh. I kept calling him Huang Shan (Emperor) and Gloria Lao Fuo Ye (Empress Dowager). Well, WQ was Xu Gong Gong (Xu Eunch). Heh.   Right. We studied in the library and I managed to study 2 Chem chapters. Oh well.   Ayiah...there ends my crazy day! I gotta get back to mah fic. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Right. Today I did not revision. I was out the whole morning, and I was addicted to my cravings of  urlLink Welcome To The Real World . Thus, I did no studying today.   Right. Today morning we all went out. The first place we went to AMK Market! Guess what we ate? Did you guess correctly? It's popiah! Oh no! What have I typed? It's ku meen!! Yes! Mushrooms noodles! What a nice ku meen!! I love ku meen!! Ku meen is very nice!! Yummy!!  After that we went to NTUC Fairprice. They brought lotsa things, including waffles!! YAY! Even waffles are nice to eat!  After that we went to some POSB Branch in Yishun to make my ATM card! YaY! I finally made an ATM card! HaHa! The teller made me do a survey on her customer service and I ticked excellent for all (except for "Time", which i ticked Good). She's really good ma. She's very friendly with me. Smiled and talked a lot. Yay! The pin is a 6-numbered code that goes: ******. Yes! That's how it shows on the screen, doesn't it? You get what you see. Even my ATM Card is so blue and shiny!  Yes. After that we went to Causeway Point to buy my present. HaHa! My present was the Yang Guang Xi Lie 7 and American Idol 3 Greatest Soul Soundtrack. YAY! HAHA! My mother also brought the Charmed soundtrack, but I have to pay her back. Sigh. YAY! I got 3 CDS. I just listened to Yan Guang xi Lie! Not bad, not bad at all! I like the songs! Good job, KY!  Right. We went to look at the Singnet 1500 plan. Well, it's isn't much better than our current one lor. Sigh. I ended up signing up for Anti-Spam and Virus Scanning features. Ayioh...thhat counter lady somehow assumed that I wanted Web Filtering as well. I DID NOT say that! Oh my god! I corrected her, and my mother confirmed my choices in a loud and clear voice. Even so, I don't trust her. I never trusted admin people anyway. Ever since Cheng Shan Primary admin made a blotcher and omitted out "Kelvin" from the register, causing me much emotional and psychology scars in secondary school. Ayioh!! What if there's a filtering service? I shudder to think what the protective Singaporean government blockheads will filter out! God forbid! I may not even read slash anymore! Or go to Wiccan websites! Those close-minded idiots! I hate the government. I am so gonna complain if there's a filtering service added in my bill!   Okay. What happened next? Ahh yes. We went to eat lunch at Woodlands Central. Hmm. Even sheng mian is nice. Also longan with grass jelly. Even the longan season is coming! Weeee!   After that, I came back la. Sigh. Despite my resolve to study, the craving for the fanfic overpowered my freewill and thinking, and thus, I went online to read that nice fanfic!   Heh. Went for dinner at 6. Me and Siva smsed each other. I was actually playing with medieval words. Heh. I missed her. Ayioh!! Siva mah friend!   Meow. Right. I just have to ruin my fun and tell Gloria I was planning a surprise. Well, it ain't really a surprise. I just wanted something to zheng CQ. Heh. I am getting more and more 'disgusting' everyday. Might be the influence of Dray (friend of author of Something More) and Mike (character in Welcome to the Real World). Heh. Anyhoo, I got my idea from Huan Zhu Ge Ge. Heh.  Ahh well. Right. What else? Nothing more right? Then I gotta get going! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Right. I was about to blog, when dinner calls. Well, gotta go eat dinner first. Be right back.  Yeah. Back. While waiting for 8pm to come so I can watch my shows, I will blog.   Ergh!! I am pretty angry at that Mr Lim. He used bloodlines and brotherhood to make me teach my brother Chem. (I did complain about it right? Never mind, hearing it one more time won't kill you) I was pretty pissed off. I can teach and I want to teach de lor. He doesn't need to be so commanding about it. Use bloodlines to pressure me some more. I am gonna make my brother fib and say that I haven't taught him. I want to show Mr Lim lian she (my annoyance)! Ergh!!! I am so fed up! Being forced kills my passion!  Right. I deviated from mah day. Right. We went to the library to do Maths. On the way, I told Gloria how CQ bluffed me into getting all curious over a non-existant person. Ergh! You ar! I feel so tired. I just slept. Heh. Tired sia!! Tired!!  Right. Be Right back. Appararently, 8pm just came.   Oh my god! Darren died! He died....oh my god.... Shock!! Shock!!  Right. Back to the day itself. That Koo Wen Qiang didn't come!! AHH! I wrote my interview so nicely and so full of emotion some more leh! A very difficult thing to do when you have commercials to distract you! Yes!  Anyhoo, we ate dessert. Then we waited outside the library. It's the big squeeze and running for tables again. I ran like a mad cat upstairs.   Well, we studied. I studied about 4 chapters. Exponential, Bionomial, Partial Fractions and Inequalities. Yeah. We met Hann and I went down to talk to him. Meow moo!  At4+, we finished studying and we went to Mac to eat large fries. Yeah. Coming back was meowful, then blah blah blah.  Ahhh! I am engrossed in yet another fanfic! Ahh! I can't concentrate! I gotta go read me fics. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!

      Okay! Forca! What a meowing song! Yes! I got the song! YaY!   Okay. I've found out this title thingy la. HaHa. Slow. Maybe I'll start using titles, but it's kinda hard to sum up the whole day in a phrase. And maybe if I'm wu liao, I will start titling all the other posts too.  Right. Today we went back to school to attend Maths Lecture for test corrections. HaHa. It's the first time I went to school with Janet and Gloria. HaHa! Yeah.   Me and CQ feel like extra like that. We took a different test ma. I spent the time talking to WQ (and scratching his face) and ignoring poor CQ. Sorry la!! I don't mean it one! I will talk to you, okay? :D  Okay. Friend's time. Be right back at 10.30.   Backity back! HAHAHAHA! Another 30 minutes of insane laughter! I am so enjoying Friends! Yeah.  Okay. Back to today. Me, WQ, Gloria and CQ went to Causeway Point. Poor WQ cat. We left him out of the conversation most of the time. Well, not that he really minded. He got QingTing to talk to on the train. But we felt kinda bad anyway. It's like the three of us got some kind of bond from being together for so long. Yeah.   Anyhoo, we met XC and KS and we decided to go eat Mos Burger. Actually, they decided. I grumbled about the high cost. And I ended up being the one who paid the most. Heh.   After that they went to tour Causeway la. We stopped at the steps on the 7th floor, waiting for Hann. Well, I was very quiet. Even CQ, Gloria and KS noticed. Why cannot quiet? I don't feel like talking ma. Yeah la. It's because of XC la. I am just not comfortable round him, due to that incident long ago. And you know me. When I am uncomfortable, I just freeze up. Also bo pian ar. They wanted to meet up with us de. So I just tagged along, silently.   On the steps, we witnessed a horrific incident! Somebody spilled coke. The cleaner actually made the parents wiped the floor lor. Ordering her around. HELLO! That was supposed to be his job. Like it's the baby's fault that he spilled Coke. The woman actually snapped at him. Jia you! I was actually waiting for that guy to come over to our side so I can be rude to him (Say "Haiyoh!! So rude!!" loudly). I can't stand people like him. Too bad I don't have the chance. I was actually glaring at him and seriously considering spilling my water on the floor. However, I remembered I was in PJ school uniform, so I cannot do things to disgrace the school. How I wish I was not in uniform! Sigh!   Before Hann can arrive, we went home first. Me, WQ, Gloria and CQ. Me and Gloria took the bus home. Yes.   Okay. After bathing and whatnot, I went online and conducted the course. Yes. Even courses are fun and educational. Then I went to read another H/D slash. That story was so touching! I kept crying from the middle chapters onwards. The angst, the happiness, the joys, the sadness. So overpowering! I kept having twingling feelings all over me! Such powerful emotions! Great story.  I went for dinner and all. Ayiah, that's not important. Gloria wanted the link. Well, she can't take slash that well. Heh. Well, beyond gay sex, it is really a powerful story. A great one. HaHa. Each to her own preferences la. If she's uncomfortable with it, I guess it's unlikely she can feel the high emotions the author manages to evoke out of the readers. Yeah.   I wrote Gloria's testimonial. Well. I think it sucks. I don't know. I'll write a better one next time. Yeah.   You know what? The three of us are so close that relatively no secrets are hidden from each other. They get revealed some point in time, no matter within an hour or months. Yeah. HaHa! See how open we are with each other? Very!  Hmm. See. I am jiemei with Gloria, now I am xiongdi with CQ. HaHa! Hilarious story how I winded up being both. Anyhoo, meow. :P  Oh yes! I did WQ's interview. Well, Question 3 and 4 were the same and I answered them as one. I wrote a really long answer. HaHa. I was kinda cynical la. But I was speaking the truth. Honestly, I think their group did not really looked at the issue thoroughly. Maid abuse cannot be prevented. It can be lessened, possibly. Prevented? Nah.  Right. I gotta get going. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!

      Okay. I am meowing online now. Yes.   Today was a boring day. Okay. Not really. I was constantly occupied.  Well, in the morning, I was reading a fanfic. With lotsa pairings, Ginny/Draco is the main one. Wow. I love that pairing. HaHa! I am turning into a Ginny/Draco shipper too! HaHa! I am now currently enjoying Harry/Draco and Ginny/Draco. Well, anything with Draco in it is fun. He's such a great character to work with in slash and ships. He's quite versatile. I like him, even though he's an evil git in the canon, doesn't mean he's one in fandom. :P Heh.   One fic I wouldn't approve is Snape slash/pairings. Ergh! Somehow, I can't imagine Snape in any kind of relationship. It's like...ergh. Ha. *Shudders*  I've turned into a fanfic person all of a sudden! Ha! I am always engrossed in a fic. I am reading one right now, that almost all of the MNIers are saying it's good.  urlLink The Lodger  by Mad Martha. Ha!   I will complete this fast la. Yes. Today I completed the PoA game! Weee! Such a fun game! The Demontor attack was really hard...but phew, I managed to scrape past. HaHa!   Yes. After that were more fic. I was immersed in this series, The Wildest Dreams. I stopped after Number 3, a Snape pairing. That turned me off Snape pairings forever. HaHa! Ewwww.... Also, I was reading  urlLink A World Without , an AU where Harry and gang is totally Muggle. Of course, this is a H/D slash.   Yes. I brought dinner. I then went to make a some worksheets for today's tuition. I am tutoring my brother Chem. I am teaching Kinetic Energy today. Lets see how it turns out.  Well. Firstly, his chem teacher sucks. You know what he wrote for "Using Kinetic Theory, explain why is the fuel used in car a liquid?"? He wrote "because the liquid can dissolve and give power to the car" and it was actually marked right!! I was so shocked and surprised!! Such a teacher exists!!   Well, I taught him. He got the basic concepts. He needs more work though, but it's quite remarkable, comparing to what he wrote in the test. He did the worksheet, I corrected it and made him do corrections. Hmm. He better show Mr Lim what I've done. He has been chastising me to teach my brother. I hate it when he does it you know. Use that "brothers relationship" to force me to do things. I would do it one lor. No need to force. When I'm forced, I tend not to do things, even though I like/want to do them. I'll tell him on Tuesday. Sigh. I enjoy teaching.   Yes. I am now waiting to download Forca by Nelly Furtado! Such a nice song. Yes! Unfortunately, I am at number 29 in the queue list. Pathetic.   Right. I should be off reading The Lodger now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! What a day! Even the basketball is feeling baskety today!  Right. I woke up bright and early at 7.45, to prepare to go out to play bball. Yes! Even the birds are chirping and the sun is shining and the cats are meowing downstairs. Actually, there are no cats downstairs, and I didn't hear any birds chirping, and the sun isn't really bright at 7.45am. I am crapping.  Yes. I met Gloria and HL at the 911 busstop. They are wearing red and grey respectively. We were early. CQ came shortly after, wearing red. PY and SQ then arrived, wearing dunnoe-what-color and white respectively. Joyce then arrived, wearing grey.   Yes! We waited around and around for the basketball court to empty. Well, half of it anyway. It never did. We sat around waiting for KS, He told us to go play first, he will join us later. Yeah. We then went to the court with less shade and more sun!   We bade farewell to PY halfway and continued our tiring trek towards the court. We always end up there de. We played some ball. What a meowing and mooing game. KS soon joined us. We play more games.   Hmm. After that, we went to Causeway Point. CQ and Joyce went off to go home and eat. HL went off later to go meet with her PW group. Left me, Gloria, SQ and KS. We went up to the foodcourt to meet up with Hann and XC.   We ate lunch la. Me and Gloria ate duck porridge again. I ate popiah also. What a meowing choice of food!  After that, we went popiah. Me and Gloria just walked around while the guys were playing this and that. Ayiah,..after going to the arcade, Hann left.   The 4 of us decided to go play pool. Joyce joined us soon after. We played for 2 hours. Hmm. Meow! After that, we went home. Me and Gloria took 913 bus home. Yes! Even ducks are meowing.   I reached home, took a bath, played PoA, ate dinner and here I am online.  Ayioh! I feel so guilty! I didn't study for my exams at all, and not even touched my homework. I guess I better start on Monday. Sigh.   Well, I gotta go! Even ducks will do well to remember 18. Yes. See ya. TaTa! Night blog!

Well, I ate Shrooms Meal. I ordered Shrooms Meal. It was very very nice! Even the mushrooms were quishy and squashy.   Yeah. We discussed our plans lor. YaY! We da gong gao cheng. Meow moo. We ended around 2+ and we went home.  Oh my god! I finished reading The Time Traveler's Wife. Oh my god! Henry!!! Poor thing...The story is so touching! Henry and Clare's love story. Alba. I don't knw how to describe it! It's beyond words! I rate it 4 out of 5 stars!   Yes. Anyhoo, after that I went online, then I went to play PoA. After that, I met Gloria.  O.O! O.O! o.O! O.o! O.O!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shaking with laughter. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Right. CQ just woke up leh! He's such a poor thing! We went to eat lor. After dinner, we met CQ. He's wearing his pale pink shirt. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I can't stand it! I am gonna roll down the floor and laugh to death!!!!   I am about to be bludgeoned to death. Yes. We reached the Singapore Conference Hall at 7.40+ and we got seated. Ayioh!! A bunch of idiots sat behind us, and they spoilt the ambience! They even ate things!! Oh my lord!!! They were talking too...oh my lord! Sigh. Uneducated ducks.   The concert's very nice! I loved the Wonderings, and all the contemporary pieces! Yes! After that, we went home.   Oh my my my my! I had such a busy night! Actually, this should be classified under Today, since it is past 12am.   TODAY   Yes. I had a busy early morning SMSing. Laden with advice, I am ready to dispense them to those who needs it more than I do! Such is the generosity of me! Well, I slept at 12:30am. Some cats are not so lucky.   Well, if early morning was busy, you should looked at what happened today morning. Okay. I am exaggerating. YaY!! I am so meowing and mooing! I rocks! :P  Such egoistic duck! Actually, today is quite boring la. Yeah. I am gonna play PoA later. Meow moo!   See ya next time! TaTa!

      Uhm-hmm. What did I do today? Loads. Okay. Not really.   Darn. I am having a terrible headache! OW MY HEAD HURTS! My chest hurts too! My whole body hurts!  I am exaggerating. Kinda. Anyhoo, I will skip this morning. It's quite boring la. I went online, after that ate lunch and watched TV.  Yes. I am late in meeting Gloria. VERY late. How can blame me? I am..er...clearing my bowels. Too much info, I think. Yes. Then I spent 5 minutes finding my pants!!! My pants were put in my brother's closet!! Ergh! I rushed to meet Gloria, the the rest at Woodlands.   Yes. Me, Gloria, Joyce, CQ, Hann and KS are all going to KBox at Lot 1. Heh. We met Yih Fei's group in Lot 1. Yes!  KBox was meowing and mooing. Well, I sang relatively few songs, and I sang badly. Yeah. I spent most of the time walking round or staring at people sing. I once slept there. Until they woke me up that is.   Hmm. Quite meowing la, I must say. I paid $14.60 for the K Box. So +++=$4.60!! After that, we went home. I ate instant noodles for dinner then I went online. Actually, that's pretty inaccurate. I ate dinner while online.   Hmm. There was an conspiracy. Ayiah. Cannot reveal here. See what happens when your blog has a huge readership? You cannot write a lot of stuff. Heh.   Right. I gotta get going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Okie dokie. Right. Today morning was supposed to be spent playing badminton with me friends.   Notice I used the word 'supposed'. It means, I didn't. Where did I go? Well...I, we rather, went to treat my leg. Guess the infection's bad enough for my parents to  finally  take action.   Well. We went to the Skin Clinic. The nurse said we must get a referral letter. Cannot suddenly walk in there one. Sigh. Thus, we went to Woodlands Polyclinic, reaching there at 9.40+.  I spent the whole hour plus reading The Time Traveler's Wife. Well, my number was called and I entered the office of Dr Tan something something.  My god. My god! He can only offer me a reason for the rash and boils. Internal infection. Well, at least it isn't the soap. I wonder what it is. Of course, we got that referral letter to the Skin Centre. My appointment is on July 23rd. A Friday. I got a morning appointment. Guess what that means! I gotta skip school! Hurrah! Hurray!  Yes. All wild shouts aside. I received an SMS from CQ, lamenting and bemoaning about the loss of a much-needed friend. (:P to CQ if you are reading this) After calling, I found out that the whole gang is in McDonalds nearby. I went to visit them.  Well well well. What have I found and observed? A lot of things. Even ducks were meowing and quacking, but all that wouldn't make a difference unless initiative is taken, ya know. (I relish in the thought of forever torturing this blog with hidden hints. :P) After we talked, I went back to Mother.   Oh dear. I am stuck with anti-biotics and cream. Yeah. We went for lunch. Chicken rice is simple delicious at 301 (I believe that's the correct block number). We went home.  Right. I surfed the Net. Uneventful. I know. However, due to some recomendations from a friend, I came upon  urlLink Iresistible Poison . Another Harry/Draco slash! I am forever addicted to slashes. As you all know, I spent the better part of my afternoon reading this story.   Oh my god! This is so terribly touching! I was crying at the end. Harry and Draco suffered so much trials and tribulations...all for love. They love each other truly, madly, deeply. The author really stayed true to the book, writing Draco and Harry exactly the way they were. The love....is so touching. It transcends beyonds worlds and universe. Ahh...such love. It made me cry. I feel the hurt when Draco ditched Harry (deluded fool, but don't worry, they will patch back up). I feel the love when they are together. The love.  Right. Okay. I watched TV lor. I came online and did PW work. I feel so pressurized by my brother's tutor. I have to teach him SS and Chem. Not that I'm unwilling, but I lack proper materials! The SS Levels notes are missing, and my brother's teacher did not give that to him. Further more, he did not copy when the teacher told them! ERGH! Chem is easy to teach.   Anyhoo. I gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Right. Here I am. Sitting on my chair. Daydreaming away. Friends is about to show in er...12 minutes. Yeah. Right. I should get started.  Oh right. Distractions has distracted me and it's 9.55 now. Gotta go watch Friends, then I'll be back. This is basically a nonsensical, filler paragraph. Yes!   Back! Oh my god! Mike proposed to Phoebe! Oh my god!   Right. Okie dokie. Mornings were a tad boring. Well, I played PoA. Even exploring the rooms during nighttime is meowingly fun. Yep. I was almost late for meeting my friends, but of course, I turned out to be the earliest (whoop-de-doop! big surprise!).   We were going to collect our O Level Certs. Me, WQ, CQ and Gloria. We took 962 there. We waited for Joyce at the busstop. WQ is terribly embarassing. He went up to get Miss Tan to do surveys for him. ...! Okie.We met YiChun and Janet and we all went to Causeway Point to eat.  I begrudingly ate ban mian. I don't like the pork lard...but there are nothing else to eat le. Sigh. After that, we toured Causeway Point, then we went home lor.   After bathing, I played PoA till Harry gets the Carpe Retractum spell, then I watched TV and ate. Then I came online. Tada.   Right. WQ has already left for Thailand. Bon voyage and don't let the plane kill you. Sawadikap!   Right. Right now, I am engrossed in the book I brought. The Time Traveler's Wife. Oh my lord! It's terribly captivating! The story is so good...it makes me craving for more and more. The tender love between Henry and Clare. The time travelling adventures. The thrill. Oh my lord! I want to devour this epitome! Such greatness! I will, of course, give a complete review once I've finished with this book. Until then, rot in suspense. :P  Right. So I'll just go off and read mah book. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!

      Hmm. What a Sunday!  Okie. The morning was bit of a bore. Digimon has finished its season..no more Digimon. The new cartoon is terribly sucky. Sigh. The only saving cartoon worth watching is XiaoLin Dragons on Kids Central, but that's ending in two weeks' time too. Sigh!!   Oh well. We went out to buy my brother's TYS. Even the TYS were so mooing. Yes. Anyway, I brought 2 books. Luck Be a Lady (Charmed book) and The Time Traveler's Wife, one which I have been wanting for ages! I am currently in the midst of Luck Be A Lady. How  charm ing!  Anyhoo, we went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. Ergh. Lunch was sucky, the place was stuffy. Forget it. I came home, read my books, then went online.  Yeah. I did my PW work, typing the minutes and updating all our info. Yep.  sent all relevant documents to Gek. Yep. After that, I surfed the Net.   After all that surfing on the surfboard (IE), riding the waves and waves of information and binary codes, I disconnected me computer and went to play the PS2. PoA game la, what else? Heh. I played for a long time..till6. Then I went out and buy dinner (chicken chop rice).   Yeah. After dinner, I went to bath and here I am, online. YAY! Another chapter up for Something More! HaHa! Right. I am becoming more dramatic today! I wonder why! Drama king! (I can't bear to bestow the title of "Drama Queen" on myself! I just can't! I am not dramatic enough! Drama King is, of course, at a lower level than Drama Queen!)  Right. Overdramatic. Right. I gotta get going, read my Charmed book. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Oh! Today's a meowing day!  I'll skip morning to the PW meeting at Jurong Regional Library. HaHa. GekLing was there, then JiaHao arrived.   Woah! That place is huge!! We went to the fourth floor, the Teens section. Wah liew! So much space to meow and moo! HaHa. We went to sit at the red couch...then we left our bags to go print the microfilm copy of the article we wanted. Sigh...the printer is spoilt, and I have to go to Woodlands Library to print. Anyway, I am gonna collect my book. So meow!  We went out to eat. We ate at KFC. Kelvin joined us. GekLing drank medium Coke, KL a regular Moutain Dew. Me and JiaHao ate the Buddy Meal. HaHa! He said I was very meticulous. I ordered everything to the specific. Like the chicken parts must be wings and drumsticks. Heh. Must order everything you like to eat ma. Yeah. We ate lor.  After eating, we went back to discuss. We shifted to a corner. Well, it was my first time taking minutes. HaHa. I didn't put who contributed what...because all the points were contributed by everyone! Sigh..if need be, I will try to remember.   Well, the discussion went quite well. We discussed our project plan briefly. The detailed one will be discussed at the next meeting. Yes. We ended at 4:30. Me and Kelvin went back. Well, I went off at Woodlands to meet CQ, Gloria and WQ at the library. I am showing CQ an article we found in the microfilm.   Well, I went to collect mah book. After a long time of searching, I finally got to borrow the book! YAY! What a fun book to read!   Okay. Darn it! The printing person went for dinner and is only coming back at 6! Meow moo! I read my book lor, until 6.30. Heh. I finally went to look for the printing lady at 3rd floor and invited her down. I finally printed the pages..and another page 27 for WQ. The font is quite small, but still can see la. CQ don't need that article. Oh meow.   We went to accompany Gloria to buy food (and I brought a single Egg Sushi, which almost caused WQ to faint). Then we went home. I bathed and ate chicken rice, read a bit of Cowell and came online.  Oh god! Joyce called! She's angry at me (well, not really..she was joking) for telling CQ and Gloria stuff. Yeah...me and my big mouth la. I seem to be offending EVERYONE this week! The horoscopes didn't even warn me about it! Sheesh!!  Right. Oh yes! Good luck to JiaHao in his Taekwondo tournament tomorrow! Right. I shall end this blog le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya!  Meow meow! Right. I went to watch Harry Potter again with CQ, Gloria, HuiLing and ShuetLing. I am gonna skip all the boring nonsesncial breakfast stuff and get on to the movie.  Well, I certainly appreciated the movie better when I watched it the second time. I didn't concentrate so much on the plot. I looked at the mechanics of the movie. It's a very nice movie! The rat was more prominently featured. Yes! I still loved Professor Trelawney! I was pondering over the question "Would it be the same if they didn't go back? At that time when they were about to go back, Black has been saved. Why bother going back?" someone posted in SGSB. I think they should go back. Number 1, if they didn't, there are going to be 2 Hermiones and Harrys stuck at the same time. Secondly, the 'future' Herimone and Harry are there because the 'past' friends went back. If they didn't go back in time, the 'future' Hermione and Harry wouldn't exist. Therefore, what they did will come to naught. Besides, what the 'past' friends experienced is because of what the 'future' friends did. The timeline MUST be continued! I know I am confusing. HaHa! They have to go back...Yeah.   Okay. After the movie was choir. Choir was a bit tiring. I was hungry, tired, sore-throat and I can't even pitch AT ALL! Sigh...   Well. Today sucks. I made CQ angry. You see. We were filling feedback forms. CQ asked me must write the class or not. I misheard it as whether must write the name or not. I got pissed off and said "ayiah..write name won't kill you one!" and wrote my name in big letters on top. I was writing my answers, I misheard and I got irritated. I hate it when people ask me stuff that the teachers/people have instructed a few moments ago (that's why I keep glaring at JunSheng [CQ kept glaring at me whenever I give JS my evil look] when he ask stupid questions like this...PEOPLE! PAY ATTENTION!). When I get irritated, I just shot out my irration. Like natural reaction. I cannot control one lor. Adding worse is that I MISHEARD CQ's question. Sigh...now's he angry with me. All my fault la!   Sigh. I also kinda insulted Amanda. I was messaging WQ and it goes something like this "You terrible idiot! I just watched Harry the second time, and I appreciated the movie more when I didn't care about the plot". I wanted to tell Amanda about the appreication part, so I sent it to her too, forgetting there's a "you terrible idiot" part in front. Oppsie! She didn't reply...so I don't know whether she got offended or not. She might be in a bad mood when reading my sms. Sigh...   Ayiah...stupid la. I think I end my blog here. Oh yes! I had a very nice time with Noriko, chatting. :D Right. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! I am back from Choir Camp! Oh my meow! So meowingly fun, and tiring! Lemme start from yesterday.   Wednesday   What a rainy rainy rainy day! It was big and heavy! Yes! I even have to ask Father to bring me there! Of course, I also ferried CQ. Gloria was in school le. Hmm.  The first activity of the camp is practising the songs. We were practising until 4+. Wow! Gerald Ng is a good sectional leader! He really makes sure you know your work..even at particular notes. Okay, as I was saying before we got distracted, the lights were tripped and we decided to go out to play games.  YaY! Group D, mah group, won most of the games!! YAY!! Gerald Law was quick in the Dog & Biscuits game. HaHa! His number keep getting called.   Soon, it was time to bath. Wah lao...the bathing/changing room was totally pitch black, save for the remaining sunlight filtering in! I quickly bathed la(wah!!! cold cold cold water!) and waited for CQ.   Yeah..after that we went for dinner. Dinner was quite disgusting. Eeee. Okay..after that, we went to practise our song for TalentTime. O.O!   After that, we had Treasure Hunt. HaHa! It was over and done with in 30+ minutes. HaHa! We were really rushing like mad! We still lost in the end though. Sigh!   Well, we gathered in the canteen to tell ghosts stories. Ayioh..so scary one. That David ar! We know he was going to scare us by BOOing or something...but we still got scared. Heh Heh. Gullible fools. Soon, Groups A and C went for Night Walk. O.O! B and D stayed and played games to pass the time.  Right. It was time to tour the school. For convienence sake, I shall not post all the stories la. I just bascically looked down at the floor throughout the tour. Yeah.   After the tour, we went to eat supper. I ate Tom Yam noodles and milo! HaHa! We went back to MPR3..after we mass went to the toilet.   Today   Yes! Today! HaHa! Wah lao..we all stayed up real late to discuss/practise songs. Miss Toh and Miss Lim slept with us. Anyhoo...groups started to sleep la. Our group were rehearsing with Dorothy, cause she joined our group for TalentTime. We sang and sang..till 2.30.  We all slept on the sleeping bag provided by CQ! How nice! The five of us were sleeping in a star formation (everyone was saying it looked so nice!). It wasn't a nice sleep. I woke up constantly throughout the sleep. Once Gloria was outside..I accompanied her until she went over to talk to a group of people. I then went back to sleep. I kept waking throughout. I finally got woken up by Dorothy's watch alarm at 6.45. Wah lao..feel so groggy and tired.   We did morning PT. So tiring! After that, we went for breakfast, where I stupidly poured hot water into the lemon tea...and Dorothy and CQ poured cold water in theirs. Right. After that was more games..and our group cut open the watermelon to eat! How sweet!   Okay..after that was volleyball game. We lost utterly. HaHaHa! Oh well. During on the matches, Dorothy spilt her lips. Oh god...that was terribly painful. She was crying and crying..oh god. That must hurt a lot!   Okay..after the games..we went to eat lunch. Hmm...this time's food was better. Yeah. After that, we practised our song!! Dionne came over and helped. HaHa! Right...  Okay. The TalentTime for us was a big flop. We did lousily. Terribly lousily. Dun wanna talk about it. Rehearsals were much better. Yep.   After TalentTime was the prize presentation. Wee! Group D got 2nd group placing overall! YaY!!   AFter that, we went back. So tiring!! I went back, bathed, came online and chatted with JiaHao..then went to eat dinner. Watched TV, came online and chatted with a few of me friends. Here I am blogging. I am damn tired. I fell asleep while watching Sun Wu Kong just now. Sigh. Didn't get to see Sandy's ordeal.   Yeah. I gotta get going. Need my precious sleep!!! On the bed!!! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! Sorry for not being able to blog! I am really busy! Really!   Saturday   Right. Saturday. A very busy and sick day. Yes! How multi-purpose!   Right. I'll skip right to the library CIP. Yes. I was having a terrible flu. You can imagine the horrors of an air-conditioned place! It's hell on the sinuses! I kept sneezing and sneezing, and my sinuses kept running down. I felt so miserable!  Yes. About the work. Me and CQ were assigned the children's section again! Wah! Worked there all day long! HaHa! At the last hour, the librarians decided that we should broaden our sights and worked at other sections. We were assigned to Young Fiction, Chinese Fiction and Non-Fiction, Cookery and the magazines section at the end. We found Gloria there and we worked together to clear our load. Heh Heh.  After that we went to KFC to eat. Joyce soon joined us afterwards. Sigh. She persuaded me to go Expo with her, 'cause she needs my expert opinion on computer. Right. I wanted to go home and rest, but since she needed me, I go with her lor. What are friends for ma?  I slept on the train. Slept slept slept. I was so damn tired and cold. Oh yes. Did I tell you? I wore my jacket the WHOLE day. Everywhere I went, the jacket's with me. So cold man!   Yes. We reached Expo and met WQ. Woah! Joyce is an efficient shopper. She takes a look at the CD-Burner, decided that it was good, then brought it just like that. The same thing for her Discman. Well, I didn't say it was bad. Heck..the Expo was so crowded..so what she did was good and efficient. I just never encountered a shopper like her before. HaHa!   After that, we went to Orchard to eat sushi buffet. HaHa. I was quite recovered by then. Even the sushi is very nice. I sat the nearest to the conveyor belt, so I ended up taking orders for everyone. HaHa! Right. What a fulling dinner.  Right. After that, we went back home lor. Even ducks were meowing and mooing. I bathed, then slept. Too tired.   Sunday   Hmm. Shall I skip to the exciting part? Yeah. The morning and early afternoon's boring anyways. Yep. I met Amanda, WQ and Wendy at 4.30. Okay. Most of them were late. Some were excusable, while some were just late to annoy people. Right. No morals!   We took the train towards Orchard. We met SuPing on the train at Admiralty. Okay..we went to Delifrance to eat dinner. HaHa. I ate Pasta Gratin. What a nice pasta gratin!   After our dinner, it was a mad rush to the cinema! The show's about to show and we are so close to being late! Yes!  Onto the movie! Prisoner of Azkaban! Right... duringthe first few minutes, the projector spoilt twice and everyone was complaining and complaining. I thought the management will give us complimentary tickets, but oh well. No such luck. Yes. The movie. I digressed. It's bascially okay. A tad dissappointing. I mean, it didn't really stay true to the book. A lot was changed around. I think people who didn't read the book would have enjoyed this movie far better than avid readers (with the exception of our WQ, of course). Non-plot-wise, it is a good movie. I loved the special effects and the acting skills of the actors. Really improved a lot. Hermione was more prominently featured in the movie. I also loved the new Dumbledore. Professor Trelawney is damn cute and funny! Emma Thompson really did a good job protraying her! YaY! HaHa! There were loads of funny bits, but I don't want to spoil this for me friends. Watch then you know! :)   Okay. After the movie, we went to take NeoPrints. Yes. We saw a lot of Goths. they were quite fascinating, yet scary at the same time. Why people becomes Goths is beyond me. Right.   WQ wanted to go back. I felt obligated to accompany him. On the way to Orchard MRT, he's acting so bastardly that I left him and joined Amanda they all to shop. I wanted to shop in the first place. Right.   We tried to shop, but the shops were closed. We brought drinks, sat down and talked and then went home. All of us alighted at Admiralty and went home lor. By that time it's 11pm+. I bathed, then watched Practical Magic (really nice movie!) till 12, then I fell asleep.   Today   Well well. It's quite an eventful day. Yes. Skip skip right to 1pm. We have just finished lunch. Our performance group was supposed to meet at 1 to practise on our songs. People came in late. Oh well.   Choir was quite good compared to the last time. Yes. Very good. Anyway, our group have to spilt up, because we can't sing a single song with 6 people. Me, Boon Chai, CQ spilt up and Gloria joined us. HaHa. Now we are singing Wu Ding! What a nice song! YaY! My dream came true!  Right. I came back, ate dinner, watched TV and came online. Of course I watched Friends just now. HAHAHA! Another funny episode! HAHA!   Right. Today's entry is very rushed, due to me being very tired and I got distracted..again. Right. Okay. So I'll end here. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! What s meowful day!! Very the meowful!   Tursday   Okay. Me, Gloria and CQ met during the morning to eat breakfast. What a meowful meal Especially when dreams were discueed. Yes! See! Even cats and ducks should feel honored that they were featured in my dream. Okay. Not really featured. They were there. Right.  Moving on. Miss Yee's lectures were utterly boring. We got back our test. YaY! I passed with 17 over 25! I feel so happy!   Okay. Me, CQ and Gloria left PJ and walked towards Lot 1 for CIP. The library ain't open yet  We went to KFC. CQ wanted to drink Iced Tea so we accompanied him lor. Yes. We drank and talked. Yes. I forgot le.  Right. At 11, we went up. We told the counter staff we are doing CIP. We have to sign in and ayioh, wear a CIP badge! So embarassing! We were so spotted by fellow Pioneers! So embarassing!  Anyway, me and CQ did the Children's section the whole day. Well, also Recreation, Computers and Malay Adult. Anyway, we are stuck at the Children's Section for the whole session. I tell you ar. The children are very inquisitve. VERY! One cat even asked me where are 'the bullies'. I was quite shocked to hear there has been bullying. I quickly told the boy that the bullies were gone. Minutes later, he came back with a book and showed it to me, saying "Look! I've found the bullies!" The book's title was "The Bullies". I was like O.O and said "oh! good for you!"  Anyway, I am too tired to recount all of what has happened. Right. After our CIP, my group met me at Lot 1 and we went up to the library (again!!) to discuss PW. Our survey forms lor. We went down to Macdonalds to eat (well, only me).  Yeah. I am super sick and tired now. We discussed till midnight. Thus, my non-blog yesterday.    Today   Sorry. I am in no mood to blog. Because of my sickness. I just want to sleep. Here's a brief summary, in point form, of today's event.  -->Went for Mrs Tay's lessons. Very enriching. -->Went to Causeway Point to eat with Joyce. WQ came alone. -->We were 30 mins late for choir. -->I feel so sick.  Right. I gotta get going...see ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya!  Oh my god! I had a very wonderful dream!! A very entrancing one! A dream come true! Actually, not really. My dream come true in my dream. So, a dream come true in a dream. :P I am crapping. Oh my god! I experienced a whole host of emotions! How entrancing! How beautiful! How..wild! I'll never forget this moment and I hope this dream will continue tonight. *drowns himself in the pool of boundless emotions* *feels so helpless, because he can't tell anyone about the dream*  Right. I woke up at 8 something. YaY! Finally woke up late! Heh. I woke up, took a long bath, then went down to buy 8 Days. O.O! Daniel Radcliff is on the cover! O.O! I wonder why they didn't feature Tom Felton too. Or Emma Thompson, the crazy Trelawney! HaHaHa!   After breakfast, I went online and stayed online the whole day. I didn't do any homework. Bad person!!   Well. Technically, I didn't stay at home the whole day. I went to Woodlands Central to go eat lunch and shop at Sheng Shiong with parents. Yes. Lunch was boring. We brought lotsa stuff at Sheng Shiong.   I came back, went online. I got some PW work to do. I did them, chatted for a bit, then went to bath. I ate dinner then came online lor.  Right. I sounded terribly rushed. That's because I want to read a long chapter, then watch Miss Universe. I wonder who won. Meow!  See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Right. Tuesday. A moving and shaking day! Jing tian dong ti!  I woke up at 7.30 again. Yes. Again! Oh god..I want to sleep. I don't dare to. Today MaMa is coming back. From 9-12. I don't dare to sleep la.   Heh. Coward. Yeah. Met CQ at 10 to go oral. We can't find Mr Yeo at first leh. We searched high and low for him and he's not in his office. CQ went to study area to take a rest while I continued searching.  Lo and behold! I found our savior! Gloria's teacher, Mdm Chueng, was walking past me. I called her "Cheng lau shi dui ma?" She turned around and said yeah. I asked her where is Mr Yeo, she went in and said he's not in there. Then she offered to call him on her phone, and he turned out to be in the Haven. Such a good teacher.  Me and CQ went up to meet him. He's giving his class (Clar's class, we saw her) oral first. Hmm. We waited for a while.   Hmm. soon. It was my turn to practise the passage. Well. It's generally very easy. I knew almost all the words. Except for 'ji lei', which I totally forgot how to pronounce. I did reasonably well in this section. For conversation leh,I sucked terribly. I was asked about National Day and all. Well, I was trying to lead my answers to what I want to talk about (participating in NDP), but that made my answers didn't answer his questions. Right.   CQ didn't fare that much better. Oh well. We invited WQ and Gloria to come out to have lunch. Aniticipating long arrivals, we walked all the way from PJ to CCK Station. Not bad leh. Only takes 15 minutes.  They came at 12.15. anyway, only me and WQ ate. Gloria ate, and CQ has no mood to eat. Sigh. We ate LJS. Right. I was laughing about jokes. Laughed laughed laughed. Okay. We met Janet while going out. Hmm.   We went back to school for PW lecture. Well, that lecture was not bad. I took notes. As a Secretary... well, actually not really la. I began to take notes, but then I didn't feel like taking them later. However, I felt that since I wrote something, I might as well carry on. And so carried on taking notes I did. Quite interesting la.   Yeah. I came back, bathed, ate dinner, watched TV and came online.  Sigh. I'm worried about Wendy. Terribly worried. Wendy, I know I told you this le. I am telling you again. I'll be there for you. I will be there for you when everything goes wrong. I'll be there for you when everything is right. I'll always be there for you. I ain't abandoning you, no matter what you choose. I don't approve/support your decision doesn't mean that I will abandon you. :)  Yeah. I go sleep liao wor. See ya! TaTa! Morning blog!

      Oh my my! I didn't mean to not blog yesterday. Really. I came back 'round 11.45 and by the time I finished showering, it was already 12. I can't come online. Yeah. Presenting my entries!   Friday   Ahh! Friday! The last day of the weekidays and the start of the weekends. Well, at least after midnight anyway. Heh. Anyhoo, what happened today ar? Loads. Okie...I forgot what happened at school la. Got Chem lecture (where Mrs Tay suddenly ran out, which we all presume to vomit), GP (boring) and MT (not-really-boring).  After school is where fun begins. Okay. We've got a long day ahead of us. Our group is going down to this Teachers' Network to interview Dr Sumarta for our PW. First, we had to wait for Kelvin to finish his Parent-Teacher Meeting wtih Tham.   He came out with horror stories to share. Apparently, Tham had bad things to say about him. He 'attacked' KL using PW, saying that Kelvin could drag us down. O.O Even ducks meow!   Okay. It was onwards to the Teachers' Network. We took 190 to Orchard, then we went onto Orchard Boulevard. All thanks to the lousy map my father drew, we effectively got lost! LOST! We eventually have to hire a cab there, which was what my father suggested in the first place. Ergh.   Okay. The interview went rather well. Yep. We got rather a lot of info. One thing I must admit. I was very shocked when I met Dr Sumarta. She turned out to be woman. I always thought she was a 'he'! How surprising is that? Very! Yeah. She was friendly and great to work with. :D  Ahh...leaving the building is a terrible crime. You know what? I led the whole group to one big round finally walking opposite the Teachers' Network building. By then, I was terribly rushed. I have to go back, change, get moolah and meet my friends at 6:30. Die la! Do you know that it is very hard to flag a taxi at Grange road? Stupid right? Ergh... We spent about 10 minutes trying to get a damn cab! In the end, we got one la...  Haiyah! No time to go back to change clothes le. I have to rush to 768 in the end to get dinner moolah from Father. Sigh.   Okay. I met CQ and Gao Luan in Woodlands MRT. We then met Gloria on the train, and onwards we go to YCK station!  We met HL and HM at the station. We were fashionably late. As in 7.10+. We hurried over to AJ, then to the Auditorium. Wow! It was packed full! Lcukily, we managed to find a row of seats at the top.  The performance was great. I liked the Phantom of the Opera the best! tum-tum-tum-tum..... Even Joyce is meowingly good. At least, from what I cna see la. I remembered that in between the first and second song, she spaced out. Everyone brought their harmonicas to their lips, but she was staring into blank space. I was like O.O Then she remembered and the music began. HAHAHA! Still, she put up an excellent performance.   Okay. We went to 167 in Marsiling to eat dinner. O.O GL hor...likes to hao lian. Ayioh...hao lian about poly life. He also expects to go to the concert for free. O.O He thought SL paid le ma. Well, SL didn't pay for her ticket, but PY did. So it's like PY wasted her $5..and GL should pay. He seems to reluctant to pay, and when he tells Joyce that he's paying, he said like "I pay lor, to save you all the trouble". What the?? Anyhoo...after diner I went back with Gloria.   Yeah. Came back, bathed, read TNP and slept.   Today   Okie dokie. I woke up at 8, meowed and mooed till 10. I have to go mmet Tham ma. I was like very nervous. What if he says a lot of negative stuff about me? I hope I didn't do anything. Heh.  Right. We reached school at 11. Woah...We saw Yih Fei waiting, and he said that he waited for an hour le. HaHa. I found out that Siva was here in PJ too! She was in the TLDDS and is here for the Tmail Soc thingy. Hehheh. I was chatting with her, catching up with old times, until Yih Fei was free.   Hmmm. It didn't went as badly as I thought. Basically, the good points that come out of it is that he said my grades show that I am slowly adjusting stably and that I am a good student. Yeah. Meow moo.  After that I went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch with parents. After that leh, I met Gloria at Woodlands.  We went to Woodlands Library to do homework. Today was really productive, because I completed my Tutorial 10a (Basic Differentiation)! So easy! HaHa...actually I had problems only in the First Principle. Other than that, I love differetiation. Gloria helped me with my Physics Question 10. HaHa. I helped her too. Meow moo!   After that, Gloria have to go meet her friend, while I went to Popular to buy a book on punctuation. It's called "Eats, Shoots & Leaves", in which the title is basically a deliberate punctuation mistake in itself, if you saw the panda on the cover. Did you discover the mistake? Tell me about it in the comments! Such a nice book! Punctuation is important! A book of zero tolerance. HaHa!  Okay. Coming back was Internet and meows. Yeah. I think I gotta be going. See ya later!

      Hey Hey! Wondered why I have such a funny title for my blog today? Pionners would know. HaHa. Today's a extraordinary day. Why? Read on.  Okay. The story goes like this. Me and CQ were waiting outside the Chem Prac lab. CQ saw this monkey ran past into the opposite lab. I was like "what?". Suddenly, we heard glass crashing from that lab. Then we saw a monkey ran out and into an empty classroom. Then leh, our class started coming along with S25. We alerted then that there was a monkey in the classroom they were passing by. Everyone then crowded around and watched.  HaHa! That monkey tried to get out, but the windows were closed. It fell down many times, and everytime it fell, the girls would scream. Haha. Then it ran out and somehow jumped down to the first floor. By then, quite a number of people gathered outside because of our screams. It went into a classroom full of people and soon, everyone came out screaming. Now, all the PJ people came out and watched. It's like...wow. A monkey can attract so much attention! Everyone was screaming and meowing.   Okay. You see, there's this landscape between two opposite blocks. In that landscape, there was a pond. You can guess what happened la. SPLASH! In went the monkey. AHHHHHHH! Screamed the Pioneers. Luckily, the monkey got out. It was quite a shallow pond, actually.   Mrs Jasima then arrived and shooed us away. Heh heh. I heard that a teacher managed to lock it inside a classroom, and someone got rid of it la. Don't know who. I huess it is animal control ba.   Anyhoo, practical was a rush. Wow! Two experiments in a day! We were all very late for the Physics Lecture. I guess this late-coming is gonna be a regular thing. Heh heh. I partnered with Zahiah and we have such great 'chemistry'. Forgive the intentional pun. No la. We had fun working with each other. We cheated on the second experiment, as there was no time. We did half of the experiments each. Heh heh.   Okay. Blah blah blah through the day. Oh yes! We had Physics SPA. Ayioh! It was so darn easy! PY was saying it was tough and stuff. O.O She likes to exaggerate things de. Heh heh.   Today in choir, we had photo-taking. HaHa. Because of the constant moving of chairs and benches and the arrangment, it took us nearly an hour to take the pictures. HaHa. It was worth it though. I wished I could only stand besides Ah Ji. That JS ruined the boys' Raffles pose. Ergh!   After that, we had practice till 8.15!! Oh my god! We kept singing John's song leh. So horrible. I felt kinda small. I think I am one of the worst Tenors. I had JS sharing that "glory" with me. Eeee... I don't want to be placed in the same category as him. I am, after all, much more experienced than him. Sigh.   Anyhoo, me and Gloria decided to go MacDonalds to eat. It was already 9+, and we were feeling very hungry. Both of us ate the 4-piece McNugggets and regular Coke.   I arrived home at 9.40+. After bathing, I arranged my Chinese file and came online lor. Now, I am waiting for my phone to charge. Heh Heh.   Well, I think that's all for today. Not bad right? Me and CQ can cause such excitement and mayhem in the school compound. Not bad lor! Pioneer spirit! Heh Heh. Enough crapping. Gotta be going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! What a meowful day today!!  HaHa. Okay. Today is Smart-Casual Day. Wee! I wore the blue t-shirt they gave me for my birthday (I forgot the name. Polo Tee, I think) along with my blue trousers. I color-matched! HAHA! Crazy cat moi. Yes!   Okie. Today, something big happened! YESS! Koo Wen Qiang's right arm is in a cast. Or rather, a bandage. Whatever. He injured his right arm during PE today. Apparently, he was playing Netball when someone pushed him down because he was blocking that person. Yes. How complicated. His friend has to take him to the hospital. Ayioh. Poor thing right? Meow moo meow!  Okay. Today there are two Chinese events that must be celebrated! Number 1, my book review was praised! Weee! I am so happy. It is such a rare event that my Chinese work got praised. HaHa. He said I've written quite nicely, and said that I type better than I write. Heh Heh. He said my writing style is quite contemporary and it fits the modern times now. I am so happy. :)  Okay. After school there was this concert by the Chinese Department. Students and teachers sang Chinese songs for us. Even the non-Chinese teachers and students sang Chinese songs too. HaHa! I have really enjoyed myself there. :D   Right. When we are walking out of school, we spotted Gerald Ng walking with GuoHao and Grace. GH doesn't look entirely happy. Attracted by Gloria's and CQ's laughs about me (I was boasting about the Chinese book review to Gloria. HaHa!), he turned back and started walking with us. He thought we were laughing about him because he fell down. O.O Throughout the whole journey of walking to the bus-stop, taking the bus and going up the MRT station, I found out that his yi xin ping (suspicions-paranoia) is very heavy. When we are laughing or smiling, he thought that we were laughing at him. Then when I cleared my throat and went "hem hem", he thought I was laughing at him. O.O I think he finally knows that he is not really well-liked and is ostrasized. Poor thing leh. It's not fun being ostrasized, but...I can't click with him! What do you expect me to do? Pretend to be all fake and smiles around him? Okay la...as long as he doesn't go correcting my pitch, tone, tune, key and how I sing. :P   Heh. Yeah. Basically, that's my day la. Yeah. I think I am going off le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Meow moo! Sorry for not blogging yesterday! I can't blog. I got a visitor around. Kelvin came to type out his Chinese review. HaHa. Okay. Details later.   Monday   Okay. First off on Monday. PE! Softball! Weee! It was so damn fun! HaHaHa! Even I scored a run for my team! Wee-hoo! Okay. There's no PE and Mass PE for mine and Gloria's class for the next two weeks. Next week all the PE teachers will be going to the Leadership Training Camp and there will be no PE lessons for the whole week. The following week is National Day holidays! Weee! Okay. Not soo wee. I am dissappointed that there will be no PE lessons. I like softball. So fun! However, I don't mind not having Mass PE next week. :P  Right. What else today? Nothing else le. Yeah. I've got choir. Today in choir we spent the whole day learning John's composition. O.O Due to some inevitable shifts, I ended up in the second row. Besides Gerald Ng. I felt so extra when not in the front row with CQ and Astro. I am so used to sitting with them le. Gerald ar...ayiah. Don't know how to say him la. See him so pitiful like that. I know how Janet feels le. I felt so left out and miserable. Anyhoo....John's song was quite nice. HaHa.   Hmm. Kelvin came over at 9+. HaHa. He wrote till 12.15. HaHaHa. Even ducks were meowing at the almost-forgotten bag. :P   Today   Oh god. I felt so sleepy today. I don't know why. I don't think it is due to lack of sleep. I always sleep at 12+, and I don't feel this tired. I think maybe I had a heavy day or something. I even slept during Chinese test leh! So embarassing. I got woken up by Mr Yeo, and apparently, he and CQ were laughing at me sleeping and shaking their heads. Meow moo!!  Right. Why I felt painful? I don't know why. My left thigh hurts for the whole day. Sigh. It still hurts now though. CQ thought I was making up some excuse not to Mass PE. No!! Its really painful.   Besides that, I developed a sharp headache during Mass PE. So painful! Now I am still having it. I think I need to sleep soon. Yeah.  Ya know what? I think I'll do it now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      "You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else"  Identify this quote! Dum-dum-dum *drums fingers on table* Got it? Well, it's Storm from X-Men. HaHa! I am watching that movie right now. What a cool Storm! Meow moo meow!!  HaHa. The movie's just finished and Iam now eating Super's Tom Yam Cup Noodle. Good stuff, that noodle! Weee!   Okay. Today's bascially boring. Yeah. I mainly played Pokemon in the morning. Oh, did you know? I downloaded the Pokemon Sapphire ROM and played it. HaHa. I am so hooked after watching the Pokemon cartoon. Now I got a Treecko and a Taillow, and many other Pokemon too. I am a collector. HaHa.   Okie. In the afternoon, I didn't do my homework. I don't know how to do, not that I don't want to do leh! I didn't attend the lectures, and I got very confused. Sigh. At least I have some form of valid excuse. Hem hem.  Right. I did minutes instead. Ayioh. It's very difficult to cook up minutes. You have to literally put words in people's mouths. HaHa. This project really teaches creativity after all. Wahaha!  Okay. After that I played more Pokemon, earned more levels and finally went to buy dinner.   After dinner was bathing, and X-Men watching. Tada! Here I am, writing this blog. Even ducks could meow at that. Right.   I think I gotta go le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Weee! Today is the day! I must narrate in great detail!  Okay. First off, I woke up at 5 to bath. Ergh! You can't believe how tiring it is. I kept sleeping while bathing. Isn't that horrendous? Imagine! Sleeping while water is running all over you? Ergo!   Right. After that, I set on the ardous task of gelling my hair. Now, I wouldn't care to gel my hair. However, Miss Ong said she wanted a clean forehead, meaning no fringes. Sigh. You wanna know how long I took? Half an hour! My stomach was grumbling like mad already! I tried to make my hair all stand up, but I look like a freak. I can't do the flat top, because the rest of the back hairs are in a weird crazy pattern. Sigh. I even called CQ and Gloria to ask for advice. In the end, I did a center-parting thingy. HaHa. Oh well!  Right. I grabbed a box of Porky Strawberry sticks and ran out of the house to meet Gloria. O.O!!! It's about to rain! Such horrid weather in a morning! Atrocious! Luckily for me and Gloria, the downpour started after we went into the MRT station. Ain't we lucky or what?   Okay. We met CQ on the train, blah blah blah and arrived to school slightly wet. We have to trek across the open road, in such torrential conditions! Even ducks meow at not being wet!   After waiting for so long (for lotsa people), we finally set off at 8. Heh Heh. I slept on the journey, listening to Boon Chai's discman (I slept after Cindy's Ai Ni. I have to thank Wendy for 'introducing' me to that song. Who wouldn't get addicted if you have to listen to the song everytime you visit Wendy's blog? HaHa!).  I meow and moo! We went in there, and assembled lor. We rehearsed first. That Alvin ar. Such a joker. HaHa. He reminds me of Vincent, really. His friends tell me he's an attention-seeker and he actually asked "What's your name" today? Horribe reminder of that lunatic. Alvin's not that bad la. At least he knows when to be serious, can sing well and is humorous. Heh Heh.  Right. There's a break. Oh my! The boys are forced to apply blusher on our faces. HaHa. I ended up quite red la. Well, not really red. I joked that it's like hou zi pi gu (monkey's butt), something that XiaoYanZi would say often. HaHa! Not bad la. HaHa.   Okay. It's finally our performance! Ayioh...such a short performance. I kept smiling though. Once, it wasn't my turn to sing, so I was smiling at Miss Ong. I was so engrossed in smiling that I came in late for a part! HAHAHA! Anyhoo, I think we did rather well. So soon over le! We prepared for so long, so xin ku. Only came to perform for about 10 minutes. Like the ancient Chinese proverb: tai shang yi fen zhong, tai xiao shi nian gong (one minute on stage is equivalent to ten years preparation down the stage)!! Yes! Even ducks were meowing!   Okay. After our performance (gaining thunderous applause :P), we sat down at the back rows. I really felt like sleeping. Luckily, I know my decorum and did not sleep. HaHa! The ChannelNewsAsia camera man actually came to my row and started fliming leh. There I was, left leg over right leg, the booklet showing who's getting what awards open in my lap. When the camera started filming my row, I tried to be as proper as possible and looked at the big screen while applauding politely at those getting the bursaries. HaHa! How fake! Why my row of all rows? Heh!   Okay. After the awards, we had the reception. O.O! I totally pigged out! I ate so much chai tau kueh (carrot cake) and keep on grabbing more drumsticks! Let me tell you, their drumsticks is to die for! I think I took about 6! Oh my god! Such heavenly drumstick! After that, I took more fruits. HaHa! Wintermelon, watermelon, grapes and even dates! I am such a glutton! Yes!! I didn't get to drink tea though, 'cause CQ and Gloria wants to go off le. Sigh! My tea!!  Okay. After that we went to Orchard to go to Kinokuniya! Finally! I can spend my vouchers. Okay. I stand corrected. The vouchers CQ gave me. Yep. I spent it on "Tuesdays With Morrie" and I even have to come out with 70cents. HaHa. What a nice book!  Okay. After that, I met Kelvin at Admiralty MRT, while he passed stuff to me. I went back, bathed and made minutes. HaHa. So tiring. I even fell asleep for a couple of hours.   So tiring sia! Even ducks were meowing! Okay. I think I going le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Alright! Today is another off day for moi! Oui! No school! Actually, I am going for an appointment at the National Skin Centre, which was reserved during June. Yep.  Right. This time, however, I did not have the luxury of getting up late. Nooo.... I have to get up at 6:30. Sigh. Ku ming ar! Sigh. I bathed then we went out lor.  Yes. I slept on the ride to the Maxwell Food Center, and slept while waiting for my century egg porridge to arrive. HaHa. Okay, after breakfast, it was 8 something.  Well, we arrived at NSC at 8.50something. Well, we get to see this Alfred Choi guy. Heh Heh. He reminds me of Mr Jeremy! Really! He got a strong American accent, looks kinda ABC-ish and likes to exaggerate things a lot.   Right. I found out that I've got eczema. It's a skin condition where my immune system is over-sensitive to irritants and produces rashes and sores. My skin is excessively dry. Sigh. Eczema is permanent. Yes, it can dissappear...temporary. A flare-up might occur sometime. Sigh. I need to keep my skin moisturized all the time. To do that, I would have to try not to sweat. Ha! Fat chance at that! I sweat even in air-conditioned places. Sigh.   After the consultation, we went back home lor. I took the remaining morning to finish my Maths homework on 3D Trigo. HaHa. Think I am handing it up tomorrow, in case I forgot on Monday. Yep.   Okay. What else happened? Ehh..nothing else le. Kinda boring afterwards. I can't cook up minutes, 'cause I don't have enough materials to cook up something belivable. Heh Heh. Therefore, I read fics all day long.   Right. I think I am going liao. See ya next time with a report on tomorrow's MDIS performance! TaTa! Night!

      Right. Actually yesterday, I could have blogged. Yep. It's just that I so got invovled in  urlLink Love Under Will  that I didn't want to blog. Heh Heh.    Yesterday   Okie dokie. Whatever happened yesterday? Errr....nothing much in terns of classes. Okay okay lor.   Right. We went to the rehearsal for the MDIS concert at Swissotel the Stamford.&nbsp; It was a meowing bus ride there, as BoonChai and I talked and talked. Weee!   Wow! That hotel is very gao gui! Very posh and elegant. Duhz. That's a 5-stars (or issit 6-stars) hotel! Of course it is posh and elegant! haHa. We went to this room and met the Hai Sing cats and ducks and whatnot. O.O!!!  Okay. We got into position. Ayioh. Me and John are the shortest leh. Kept getting teased one. HaHa! Oh alright. I got into the front row first, sandwiched between two Hai Sing tenors. Both Sec 1s though. The one on my right is pretty inconsistent in his pitching, and I am ashamed to say that he affected me a little and I have strain to hear John's voice at the back. The left cat didn't pose a problem at all, as he was too soft to be heard. Ah. He should really project his voice, but oh well. As long as he doesn't affect me. Now I sound mean. :P  Righto. I got transferred to the second row next! YaY! I was promoted! Okay. There's one major distraction. The guy next to me on my left. He's a bass, probably a Sec 3 (Sec 4s would have left already) and he sings damn well! He's tall too. Ayioh! His voice is sooo deep, and so distracting. Yes! The bass sound terribly nice in One Song&nbsp;though. Yes. It was very distracting! Loud and accurate pitching, I found it terribly hard to follow John. Yes!  We ended at 5something. Miss Ong was apparently not pleased with our choir. It's excusable we don't know the MDIS song, for we only practised it on Monday. However, for the other two songs, she said we have no excuse not to know our work. She promised late stay-backs tomorrow if our performance is unstatisfactory. Heh.  Okay. Me, CQ and Gloria went home. Janna caught up to us and joined us on the way back home. I was apparently an interesting entertainment on the train. CQ and Gloria said the way I sleep is very interesting. I would lean my head...and lean until it was dangerously close to resting on CQ's shoulder. Then I would snap back and sit straight, and continued sleeping. HaHA! I did that in all directions too (except to the back). I know I am doing it, but I didn't know it was  that  interesting to watch. Heh Heh.   Right. YAY! Charmed's coming back on August 11!! WEEEE! Charmed! Charmed! Charmed!!! Even Piper, Phoebe and Paige are meowing and mooing at the cats and ducks and whatnot! Weee!!   Thursday    &nbsp; Righto. Today we have SPA. School-Based Practical Assessment. On Chemistry on titration. Sigh. It was testing of Skill C and D, which means calculations and evaluation. I think I did well on the calculations. I think. I can safely get a Level 6. For Skill D, I think I did fairly well and met expectations. A safe bet on getting Level 5 ba.   Mrs Jasima, however, was not pleased with our class. I think our class has garnered bad reputation from the Chemistry teachers. Mrs Tay and Mrs Jasima are both saying they were not pleased with S22 at all. Sigh. We felt so yue wang. I didn't think that I was playing a fool and not paying attention to Mrs Jasima. I can safely say that I met her expectations ma. I don't think S22 is what the teachers think lor. It's just some black sheeps here and there ma. I think our class, as a whole, is quite well-behaved and easily manageable. Of course, the only teacher we got along well with is Ah Tham, and I am glad of that. Come on, if we don't even get along with our form teacher, then we are pretty dead meat. Yeah! So hooray for Mr Tham!! WEE!!  Okay. We can skip to choir le. Nothing much happened. Okay. Choir! O.O Astro sat between me and CQ this time. I like sitting besides Astro. He's fun and silly&nbsp;to sit besides with. HAHAHA! Yeah. He sings well too. Good good. :) And sigh. I got demoted back to the front row. Along with Astro wor! HaHa! Great! :D And yes, we sang well enough. YaY!   Okay okay. Now I am back. HaHa. I gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Oh wow! Righto... Sorry for not blogging yesterday. Time and energy doesn't permit me to. I will narrate in just a bit.  &nbsp;  Monday  &nbsp; Hmm. I spent the day in misery, with hacking coughs every now and then. So miserable. I felt like vomitting all day long, but I don't dare to. Heh. &nbsp; Right. Nothing really interesting happened. Okay. I missed PE, because I can't run while coughing, or else all my vomit comes out.  &nbsp; Hmm.... Right. Today during choir, Miss Ong didn't come because she was sick. Poor thing! I hope she feels better soon. Okay. We sang  Sing &amp; Rejoice  and  One Song Many Voices  all day long! Ayioh...I was unable to reach the high notes. Keep having to shut up on the high notes, which thankfully, is at the end of the phrases. &nbsp; Yeah. Guess what? I got in the MDIS performance! HaHa. Well, there was no choosing la. All the boys got in. Guess there's a desperate lack of boys, eh? Gloria got in as well...weee! Okay. We learnt that MDIS's coperate song. So lame and corny. HaHa. You should hear the girls laugh as the boys sang that "management training" bit...it's like we have to suddenly cresendo and go high pitch at "meh" (it goes like: MEHHH-neg-ment"). HAHAHA! Yeah. &nbsp; Okay. I managed to persuade Mother to let me stay home from school today. Yeah. I don't feel like going to to school tomorrow la. I came back at 9, ate dinner till 10 and I have virtually no time to do homework. Plus, I fell asleep. Yeah. I have no mood to mass PE (what if Mr Ang don't allow me NOT to PE??), and I haven't finished my Chem yet, and I don't want to face the wrath of Mrs Tay. O.O &nbsp; Oh my god! How can I forget to say this?!!! I scored more points with Mr Jeremy today! First, he said he liked my English file and my comments for the articles.  Well done , he said! Ain't that something? *flashes wide grin* Also, I didn't participate in the debate, but I wrote points for everyone! I have written CQ's point, and guess what? Mr Jeremy said that CQ is the only one who touched on the topic of censorship is not nedded. His point, or rather mine, is that self-censorship is enough, and renders government censorship useless. Muhahaha! Double score for me! Take that, you idiot MCP (He has proven that he is indeed an MCP through and through. He supported the boys' group, which is us, rather than the girls' group,&nbsp;even though the topic we argued is not what he supports. Who wants his support? Eeeee!)! &nbsp;  Today  &nbsp; Righto. Today, I woke up at 8.30. :P to all of you who are in school at that time. I get to sleep late, and you don't! :P :P :P Right. Lets not make the masses angry (and jealous), alright? &nbsp; Okay okay. Enough joking. I went to AMK to eat some ku meen (for refresher, it means mushroom shredded chicken noodles, aka the best noodles in the world)! Ahh! Heavenly! I can't get enough of them! KU MEEN!!!  &nbsp; After that, we brought some supplies, then went back home. I did my homework (drew 2 graphs..haha), came online for awhile, then went to eat lunch.  &nbsp; After lunch at Admiralty Place (kuay chap), it was to the doctor's. After getting MC, we went to AMK again to shop for hats and whatnot. I brought a pair of black&nbsp;leather (I think fake one...but who knows?) shoes. My old one was too small, and childish I might add. Yeah. &nbsp; Okie. The rest is not really worth mentioning. Okay, I got lotsa tidbits from CQ about today. Okay. Most interesting tidbit. Today in Chem, Mrs Tay got rather upset and scolded the class. Apparently, John fell asleep and that led onto a tirade that seemed to incriminate the whole class. She apparently feels that whenever she steps into S22, she feels like losing her temper. Is our class so hard for her to handle? Sigh...yue wang ar! I am so glad I didn't come. &nbsp; O.O! We are supposed to go attend this SAF talk tomorrow. Apparently, me and CQ are selected by Ah Tham. Luckily, tomorrow we have this dress rehearsal at Swissotel for the choir and we can escape this nightmare. However, that CQ did not tell Mr Tham that the choir cats are not going. Neither did JunSheng try to save himself. HAIYOH!!! Qi shi wor leh! We are supposed to tell Tham ma...so he can select 3 other cats. If we tell him tomorrow, it will be too late to make last-minute arrangements. I felt rather upset and irrtated that CQ and JS didn't do anything lor!! It's like I everytime have to be the one who informs the teacher leh. Honestly! What's so hard about speaking to the teacher? Qi shi wor!! Ergh...  &nbsp; Okay...calm down. Calm down. Right. I think I gotta go le. Read a story. Heh. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Okay. The title spells it all. I am in such pain! My throat! My hoarse hoarse throat! I fell so sick! There's a constant pressure to vomit. I have not a single wish to vomit my meals out. I do not want to see chewed food coming out of my mouth while I writh in the pain of burning thorax. Yes. It's that bad. Oh! Lets not forget the stomach pains while its being sucked in to push the food out. *Shudders*  &nbsp;  Okay die. I just found out that I can't sing, or else I will risk the prospect of vomitting! Die le la...how to sing tomorrow? Vommitting's a side issue, but my voice has grown scratchy and lost its Tenor voice. Now it resembles god-knows-what! Oh dear!  &nbsp;  Right. Besides the osccassional sniffing of the throat and more-than-enough clearing of the throat, I did practically nothing today.  &nbsp;  Okay. Not really nothing. I watched TV in the morning. I also finished my beta assignment for the English Elite, a club in MNI I joined not too long ago. Very nice and fancy! :) Lexi (the leader) said it was very good. O.O I never 'beta'ed before. That's good, I supposed. HaHa! Even QianQiang meowed and quacked in Tou Long Zhuan Feng! Yes!!  &nbsp;  Okay. In the afternoon, I did my homework, which was GP and Physics. I suddenly have an urge to watch Xiao Qian, A Chinese Ghost Story. A commerical for that movie was showing on Channel 8, and I felt like watching it. Of course, I did very little GP writing as I immersed myself in the movie. Ahh well.  &nbsp;  I carried my homework to my computer desk and I resumed work. I concluded rather suckily for GP, because I was hurrying to get it done. Heh Heh. I then hurriedly to work on PW, to solve those pesky problems that I know. Can leave the unknown ones to Miss Yee. Heh Heh.  &nbsp; Right. After that I lost myself to  urlLink Dangerously In Love . Pages 13 and 14 gave me problems, and thankfully, Gloria helped me to copy those pages and send to me in Words form! Thanks Gloria.  &nbsp; Oh Yes! You should read  urlLink He's NOT My Boyfriend ! That story made me cried bucketfuls of tears! I never cried so much! Okay...I say it almost everytime. This time, I really cried a lot! The touching scenes were extraordinarily touching! Especially the breakup, then when they reconciled. Very very gan ren. I have a softspot for fights and reconcilation. I really cried so much that my shirt was wet. I just couldn't stop! Very emotional!  &nbsp; Yes. I think I'll end this now. See ya! Great. Now my cold came back. See ya next time! TaTa!

      Heya! I know I know. Throw rotten eggs on me! I haven't been blogging! It all went downhill! I swear I didn't mean to  not  blog. Well, maybe except Wednesday. I am so innocent!  &nbsp;  O.O! Blogger has colors and lotsa text-editing tools!  Look!   &nbsp;   Wednesday    Right. What's interesting on Wednesday? Well..I've got oral. Sigh. It sucks la. I was given the topic about falling birth rates. This is so Social Studies! Thank god Debra lent me her notes to read at the last minutes. They have pretty good pointers. Oh yes. I got some topics, but my oral skills are sucky. It's like I keep stammering, forgetting how to express certain words in Chinese. Sigh. The examiers have to fill in for me! I die le la. &nbsp; After that, me, Gloria and CQ waited for WQ. I made him promise to go shopping with me. Hmm. Me, Gloria and WQ went shopping. Gloria got fed a bowl of curry rice. HeHe! I can't find what I wanted, so I let Janet have the job of gift-buying. Quack! &nbsp; Okie dokie. Yeah, I didn't get to type minutes on Wednesday. Gek Ling forgot to pass me the minutes, and I forgot to ask for them. Heh Heh. I think I was reading fanfic, if I am not wrong. Yeah. It got late, and I have no mood to blog. Heh Heh. There's always Thursday, right? Wrong! Lets' see why. &nbsp;  Thursday  &nbsp; Okay. We had QA today in Chem Practical. Ayioh! It's so messy and sucky! I got black X (A Zinc compound. I have no diea what the anion is) all over my shirt and face. Ayioh!! &nbsp; Okay. What else happened? Oh yes! Choir! Ayioh...Choir hor. It was sucky. I have an off-day today! All my notes seemed to be wrong. I am having a terrible sore throat. Am, not was. Because I still have it now. Anyhoo, Mioss Ong announced that there were errors. Only 30 have to be selected to go. Sigh. She said she need almost all the boys. The operative word&nbsp;here is 'almost'. Sigh. I am not gonna be selected la. Ren ming ba. She said she wanted the best, not those mediocre ones. Besides, I was standing in front of her during warm-ups, and I kept giving lousy notes. I can't pitch for my life! Sigh. We'll see the results on Monday. I must come, fever or not. Yeah. &nbsp; Oh yes! I nearly forgot. During assembly, we have personality analysis. Some company came to give us a talk, and booklet to fill up. I found out that I am a S-I. That means I am an Advisor-type.&nbsp; I am too lazy to give an intro of how an Advisor is like, but I can give you one famous&nbsp;example and you can get a mini-idea. Anne, Sullivan, teacher of Helen Keller. Oh yes! Oprah Winfrey is an Advisor too! &nbsp; Right, moving onto... &nbsp;  Friday  &nbsp; Friday ar. Ayiah. In GP, we did practically nothing. Seriously. That MCP was drivelling away and I couldn't care less. The front row was engaging in a conversation. The back rows were not. Me and CQ thus chatted the whole lesson. Even cats and ducks chatted about a lot of things! &nbsp; Right. We went to interview the vice-prez of Parent-Teacher Network. Okay. We didn't really get her. We got another member of the PTN. She's super long-winded, and gives many irrelevant details. Sigh. I want to go off!! &nbsp; From then on, it is a mad rush back home. Me and GL went off first. I was rushing and rushing and rushing like mad, in order not to be late. &nbsp; I was late. Oh well. Me, Gloria and CQ are going to Mox Bar and Cafe to watch the Acapella Singing Competition. CQ's sister and her team (of Riverside choir, duhz) is taking part in this competition. We travelled to Tanjong Pagar and took a cab there.  &nbsp; Hmm. The bar is quite cool. I've seen lotsa groups come out to rehearse. They were good. I even brought fishball stick ($1.50!!) from the stall.  &nbsp; Okay. The secondary shcool category came first. Riverside's group was first. Ahh. They did a nice performance! :)&nbsp; Soon after came more groups. Not bad la. I don't see any group that I fancy. &nbsp; The college category came next. Only two groups, and I was about to sleep then. I felt very guilty, because I was sitting in front, and I was quite obvious. HaHa. &nbsp; On the open category, I woke up. Wow! There were a lot of professionals out there. My favorite got to be Upbeat. They rock man! I loved their style. So cool. Hip and urban! :)  &nbsp; Okay. The results are out. RSS did not win. Oh well. Upbeat did win the open category. That's well and good!  &nbsp; We travelled home. It was not a pleasant journey back. I got flu, and it is killing me. I kept sneezing and sneezing! Ayioh....I slept on the train, and the bus ride was killing me! I reched home, took a quick bath and fell asleep. &nbsp;  Today  &nbsp; Right. Today, we went bowling. Whee! It was fun, of some sorts. For the first round. I was giving a good performance. YaY! At the second round, I started declining. Oh well. We played for two rounds. Heh Heh.  &nbsp; After that, we went to the foodcourt to eat. I ate porridge la. What can I eat with this throat of mine? I need to recover my voice soon! I fell sick again. I slept after finishing my porridge, waiting for that WQ to finish his drink.  &nbsp; We walked around, and I felt very giddy. Sigh. Fever's taking its toll on me. Heh Heh. We went home after that. &nbsp; Actually, me and Gloria went to Causeway Point to buy food for her family. I got to choose 3 bread for her family, because she has an emergency to take care of. I hope my choices are okay. Yeah. After that, we took the bus back. &nbsp; Right. Today is a very signifant day! Actually, not today, technically speaking. Yes! This is extremely significant! Can't tell why though. :P &nbsp; Yeah. Wendy has mentioned in her blog that I have a lot of things to hide, so my blog is not very open. Yeah. I kinda regret spreading word around about my blog's existance. It seems like almost everycat that I know is reading my blog. I can't spill my secrets out, and I badly want to! Sigh. Heh.  &nbsp; Ahh well. I gotta get going now. It's very very late. Gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! Today is a meowing moo day! Weee!  Right. Today is a very okay day. Why? Because I think it is very okay lor. Right. I am crapping. I woke up to watch the last episode of the Jap show! The ending so stupid. Sigh. It gave me a lot of qi shi. Yes!  Anyhoo, today's a long and stupid day. In GP, we formed new groups. Bascially, SU were disbanded and spilt up and there were some changes. Me and CQ left the girls' team to join Kelvin's team. Yeah. That terrible-patriot-to-a-fault MCP gave a typically patriotic name to his group. Pionner Action Party. Everyone groaned (inwardsly or outwardsly) at that  lame  name. Even we ended up as the opposition for the upcoming date over "Censorship is a nesscarry evil". O.O  Okay. After GP was Chem. Before that, let me narrate what deal was made. CQ is to treat me ILT if I fail Chem. Well, you can pretty much guess the results of the bet by looking at the title. I got to treat him ILT, because I passed!! I always sucks at betting. Heh HEh. My Section A saved me, for I scored 21.5/30. Yep.   Okay. We changed our Mass PE teacher. Now we are no longer stuck with Mr Gerald Boh. We got Kevin Ang. O.O He's not bad la. We got let off early. Heh.   Right. Okay. Lotsa lotsa things happened. I am not really in the position to narrate, so I won't. Meow moo!   Oh yes. Me and XC started talking le! I am so happy. I was being childish. Really. I have to thank WQ for that. He started the ball rolling. I guess people like us needs people like WQ around more often. HAHAHA! Now ar,WQ. Don't get your ego all boosted up. :P   Right. I gotta go now. See ya next time. Most probably not tomorrow though. I got lotsa minutes to type tomorrow. Heh. TaTa! Night blog!

      Oh heya! Heh Heh. I didn't blog the whole day yesterday, and there's a perfectly good reason why. Right. You can probably guess from my blog title la.  Anyhoos, here's:   Sunday   Right. Father did not work today. O.O! Right. Even we ate laksa during lunch. Yes!  I went to collect my Charmed: The Book of Three (The Complete Companion to the Hit Show) from WRL. I met HL, PY and SL there. O.O!!  Right. I came back and started on my 1200-words book review. I am doing Huan Zhu Ge Ge, the first part. HaHa! I spent lots and lots of time working on that work. I have to keep calling CQ to ask how to write/express words. Heh. I also have to keep checking the three books on the content.  Also, I was pretty distracted by fanfics. This fic,  urlLink Harry Potter And The Jade Dragon , (a non-slash fic this time! O.O) actually captivated my attention because it has lots of Chinese origins in it. Yes!   Right. That was a major distraction. Of course, I worked for 9 hours on that 1500-words (yes..I managed to wrote extra 300 words) book review, which I fell was quite sucky.   Yesterday was also the first time I put "Away" in my MSN Messenger for the whole day. HaHa! I really felt "Away" lor. Even the cat is away today. Okay.    Today   I woke up at 5am to watch that Jap show. Guess what? It did not play today!! I mistook Wednesday for Monday....and sigh. Woke up for nothing!   Okay. Today in GP, there's a cause for celebration! Mr Jeremy actually thinks my counter-argument is very good! I finally got affirmation from me! I have been waiting for that 'Exactly!' for ages! :P  Right. The arugment I was supposed to counter goes something like banning porn because it has a chance to lead to crimes (sex crimes or otherwise). I countered by saying that pens might as well be banned, because their pointed tips have a chance to cause hurt to people should it fall into the wrong hands. Then, you might as well ban all things on Earth, since they are dangerous and have a chance to lead to crime. Mr Jeremy actually thinks it is good! :D   Right. That very 'patriotic' MCP actually thinks that the media should shield our government and protect its reputation when it did something wrong! AYIOH! Complete rubbish! Our government opening practises transparency. Even if that LKY committed a crime, his case should be covered as extensively as any other politician who has committed a crime. Okay, maybe more la. After all, he is Senior PM. Anyhoo, lets nhot talk about this. MCP is a silly duck.   Okay. I got my Physics results back. I failed with an F! AYIOH!! So terrible! Sigh.  Okay. Today got choir. YaY! I am very happy in choir today. I managed to pitch quite accurately. I am so happy. :)  Okay. That's all lor. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Okie dokie! Today's a hectic day!!  First off in the morning, we got MT AO Level Listening Comprehension. Yes. Me and Debra talked a lot. Our invigilator looks like one of those PE-teacher type. So PE-teacherish. Anyhoo, the paper was so easy! You can even use logic to answer the questions! It is like...duhz! I am confident of scoring full marks.  Right. After that, me, PY, CQ and Gloria went to help WQ with his PW work. Counting his surveys lor, so he can go off early. Heh. Even ducks counted and meowed.   Yes. After that, we minused PY, went to Causeway Point to eat lunch. I ate kueh chap. Okay la.  After lunch, I brought the cats back. CQ wants to come over to do PW research. Gloria wanted to come along, so why not. I have not planned on adding WQ, but since I felt bad about leaving him out, I inivted him over as well. I have now 3 cats in my house.  Yes. I left them alone for the first hour or so, as I went to bath then watch my Pokemon. Yep.  Ayioh! My room is so small and there are hardly enough room for all of us. Heh. Koo Wen Qiang is very bagua. Reading my conversations wor! No way dude! :P   Heh. It was a utter mess. Fans were being switched on and off. Am I the only one who doesn't find my fan cold? O.o I even fell asleep. Heh.  Right. They finished with their work and began exploring my computer. Siow cats. After that leh, we went outside to talk lor. Talkity talk.   At 5, they went home. Blah blah blah. Ate dinner then watched Simpsons. A lot of cats made guest appearance, like Tony Blair, Ian McKellen and JK Rowling. HaHa! Cool beans!  Right. I think I better go now. I am getting tired. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Righto. Okie. Two things happened today la. Okay. Three major things actually. Okay. Add another minor one.  First was the release of GP results. Meow moo! Okay. Before that, I made a bet with CQ. I will treat him ice-lemon tea when I passed and he fails. So, even if both of us fails, he will get one ILT. Unfair right?   Yeah. The results are as shown: CQ gets 2 bottles of ILT. Yep. It means I passed and he failed! Actually, I did not pass the way I liked. I got 47/100, but I want to get 50 and above. To me, 50 is considered passing. Sigh. Even the Ice Lemon Teas are gonna get sold out soon. Meow moo meow!  Okay. I also found out my MT score. I got a B4. Cheh. One of the lowest in class. HaHa!   Right. After that my PW group and I went to Boon Lay Primary to interview the vice-principal. Yeah. We went to collect the results from YuHua Primary.  Heh. The interview went quite smoothly. She brought up even more points, and I am very glad for that. :D  Okie. We went to Mcdonalds for lunch and analysis of our results. Heh heh. Lets just say our surveys are very satisfactory. Very statisfactory indeed. ;)  Okay. Me and Kelvin took 187 back. It's a 50 minutes ride back home. Yep.  Okay. I go watch Nip/Tuck le. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! I just found out that I have the worst luck ever!  Right. Let me narrate from the start. Okay. I am now hooked on this new TV show (a Jap drama) that airs at 5am. The storyline is so addicting! Okay right.  Today I left home extra early to deposit my moolah into my bank account via the Cash Deposit Machine at CCK MRT Station. Okay. I see there's no line, so I rushed there. I immediately took out my card and was just about to insert it when I looked up and saw the words "This machine is temporary out of service"! Why must this happen to me! So dao mei leh! When I want to deposit somemore! I said "ayiah!" and the people queueing in the ATM queue looked at me. So paiseh!   Sigh. This term in Chem Prac, we started doing QA. Eee. I hate QA. Have to memorize a lot of things. Also have to do a lot of tests too. So er xin. Sigh.   Okay. I found out how much I got for my Physics MCQ. It is...11/25. Sigh. Not even pass by 45% Die le la. Dao mei leh! So unlucky!  Okay. After Physics is choir. This is a rather informal practice session. Heh Heh. After that, we went back home lor.  Okay. I received news that only 9 passed GP in our class. Parvi sure pass de. They are spectaculating that I will pass. I doubt so. I can scrape through for essay, but for comprehension, it was a total stab in the dark while answering questions. I anyhow do one!! How can pass like that? Unless my essay mark is very high, which again, I doubt so. Sigh.   Okay la. I log off le. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Heya! Firstly, before I narrate today's event, lemme do something.  Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to Kelvin, Happy birthday to me!  Wheee! 7th July is upon us all again! Isn't it wonderful? O.O!!   Okay. Today's the starting of the school term. Sigh. Here we are again. Doomed to wake up as early as 5:30, being groggy and all, and before you know it, you are inside a building with thousand more like-beings being forced to learn theories and what-have-you.   Right. Okay. Today we only got back Maths. I passed by 1 mark, barely scrapping it! I am so happy! Weee! Heh.  Right. In Chinese, I was told that my compo did not li ti. Run away from the topic. YAY!   After school, me, CQ and Gloria went to Causeway Point to eat lunch, after that going home. Heh.   Okay la. There was no celebration today. Heh Heh. A lot of cats did wish me "Happy Birthday", so I am very happy. :)   Yeah. Oh yes! I am supposed to collect my present from Wendy. :) I wonder what she got me, even though I got a pretty shrewd idea. Heh heh. Wendy! Don't forget to lend me the W.I.T.C.H. comics ar! I really need to catch up. HaHa!   Okay. I am really really tired. I think I should go sleep soon. Yeah. See ya next time! TaTa!

      Yes! Even today is the day of the dazzling interviews and surveys! Weee!   Right. I woke up really early. Really really early. Yes. I took my father's taxi to Jurong East MRT.   Wahh....yi ge liang ge. Shan shan lai chi. Make me wait there for so long. I was so worried that we would be late. Kelvin met me and we took bus 98 down there.   JiaHao arrived shortly, followed by Gek. Phew! We didn't turn out late after all!   What nice interview session! Me and GekLing were doing interviews duties for this round. The moment was quite tense in the beginning, but it all melted away. Mr Ong invited his HOD of Maths, Mrs Toh to share in the interview.   It wasa very great session. Lots of new issues were brought up, and we were made aware of the different sides of the issues we are working on. It's a mind-broadening event. :D They also decided to help us distribute our surveys to their classes! So kind of them! We took a group photo. I truly must say, we enjoyed working with them! :D  After that we went to Boon Lay Primary and seeked an audience with the vice-principal. We booked an interview date with her on Friday, and she also helped us take some surveys to her classes. How nice!  After that, we went to Lakeside Primary. The very nice vice-p, Mrs Fong let us do an interview. This time, Kelvin Lim and JiaHao did the interview. Rotation of shifts ma. Heh.   After that we went to the canteen to let the kids do some surveys. We would like some surveys experience ma, not just schools help us do. These kids readily want to help leh! It's such a surprise! All those adults would be like very unwilling and stuff, but kids actually volunteered to be surveyed! How amazing! Such is the preciousness of the children. :D  Right. After that we went to Clementi for lunch. I ate laksa. Yes. Even ducks meow and moo!  Okay. We went to NanHua, but we can't get through. Sigh. I think we are all giving up on that school. Quite snobbish. We decided to go home lor.  Me and Kelvin took 963 bus back to Woodlands Interchange. Heh. We fell asleep on the long bus journey. So tired!   I went back, surfed the net and stuff la. Cheh. Nothing to do. Okay. I go off le la. 30 more minutes to 7th July! Weee! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Sigh. Another error. I am not upset this time. I didn't wrote much. Heh. Just a lot of nonsense in the beginning.   Heh Heh. Right. Today I went out with my friends to celebrate my birthday. Actually, HuiMin was invited too. Two Cancerians celebrating their birthdays, post-celebration for HM, pre-celebration for me. Heh Heh.   I met Gloria and HuiLing. Heh. I managed to scare them by hiding down the lift's door. When it opened, I gave them a "boo!". Heh heh! KY scaring has risen up a new level! Wee!   Anyhoo, we met CQ and HuiMin in Woodlands MRT, then Joyce arrived shortly after. Yes. We decided to go pool first.   Heh Heh. We only played for an hour or so. Hann came along and gave me the video-camera. Thanks Hann! I will take care of it de, don't worry!   After pooling, we went to watch The Day After Tomorrow. That movie is so nice! I mean, it is thrilling at first, but the emotions behind it is so powerful. Esepcially at the end when both the father and the son were rescued, and people actually survived that freezing. So touching!   After the movie, they went to buy my present for me. Apparently, they decided that I need a fashion makeover. Heh. They decided to buy something new for my wardrobe. Heh. After shopping all around, they finally brought me 2 polo tees from Giordano. A yellow and a blue one. Heh. They look nice.   Okay. That's it for today la. Oh yes! Monica and Chandler finally can adopt a baby! Weee! Such a nice Thanksgiving episode! Meow moo!   Right. Okay. I said something about a poem right? I have chanced upon this poem in MNI. It's such a nice, but sad, poem about the big bad world we live in. What's it about? Gays. How they are treated in this world. Read on.     urlLink  Queer People     by Cheyenne   You'd rather have you closeted kids be unhappy  Than out and proud, and have to listen to the endless  Talk at the country club about the town's new  Rainbow prince.  You'd rather tell your best friend he's going to hell  Than remember that he's the one who built a tree house with you when you were ten  And went to detention with you in middle school so you wouldn't be lonely.  Some people couldn't even say the word 'homosexual'.  Even if their mouth was full of one.  Is that you?  Some parents think their kids aren't gay, just too warm  And kick them out on the freezing streets to fight or die  As some form of 'tough love' that might 'cure' them.  Is that you?  Strangers on the news.  Attacked with a baseball bat.  Kicked endlessly in their head and left to die.  Tied to a fence and beaten to death.  And you'd rather shrug and laugh it off.  'Another less faggot'.  And go on about your life, than shed a tear  And admit human decency  Besides, giving a damn about queers  Will make people think you are one  And then your life would be over.  You'd rather hire an incompetent heterosexual  Than a qualified gay man to spread his gay germs everywhere.  A friend tells another fag joke  And you laugh along, cuz ignorance in the short run  Is easier than enlightenment.  And when it comes to AIDS, you'd rather blame it all on them anyways  Than admit affects men, women, and children all over the world  Gay, straight, and everything in between.  That would be too much responsibility that could be dropped onto someone else.  People think queer means anybody that isn't straight.  But you're only truly queer if you refuse to love at all.    Nice ain't it? What a beautiful poem. Sad too. Sigh. The stupid homophobic world. Oh meow.   With that nice poem, I sign off le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Ergh! I just came back from teaching my brother how to derive formulas of compounds and stuff like that. Ayioh..his Chem teacher is terribly useless.  Okay. Yeah. let me proceed to talk about yesterday.    Saturday   Yes! The SYF Opening Ceremony. All of us are going.  Okay. I woke up at 6, in order to do the Time Race quiz! Wow! I had fun doing them. I felt so confident! I hope my team gets into 2004 year safe and sound! Yes! Even ducks meowed!   Okay. I then met my team. We are planning to visit the primary schools to ask for permission to do surveys in their school. Heh. Most of the schools lie on the 98 bus route line, so it is darn convienent. Most of the schools are so friendly, especially Lakeside's vice-principal. So friendly! Some school's principals are not present, so we have to leave our particulars with the schools. Well, generally, we kinda succeeded. Yep. :)   Then I went to meet CQ and Gloria. Yeah. Lets skip the meeting process short and letys just say all of us met at Lot 1 at 12.35. Ayioh!!! Foodcourt is so full, and so are the fast food restaurants. We just have to ta bao our food back to PJ to eat lor. I 'da pao'ed chicken rice. I am damn hungry...and my stomach is hurting. It has been 6 hours since I ate.   Okay. We ate. Yes! We waited for the rest at the concourse. Heh. In the end, there were only 3 tables of choir members. Ain't that pathetic? Heh. They were thinking of skipping, because nobody took attendance. Even the seniors did not come. Sigh. All of us went in the end.  Me and BoonChai sat together. We chatted and chatted. Heh. I helped him do survey on accidents. What a cool survey. I chatted with him non-stop. What good chemistry between us.   Our choir people were talking non-stop. Heh. We passed by lots of school. Mainly primary schools. They were so happy meeting us that they keep waving at us. Heh. We met Admiralty Primary. YAY! Heh Heh.   Well, our bus is hopelessly lost. Well, not really. We have to get into the 'wrong' lane, and in the end, our batch is the last to arrive. We got separated from the rest of the Pioneers. Heh.   Okay. The Opening Ceremony is like a mini-NDP. Sigh. Copycats. Heh heh. No la. The choir put up a good performance. The display band competition is nice. YaY! Tanjong Katong won. What a nice display band! Yes!  Gloria and met met the rest outside the stadium. CQ went to meet his family. We met SL, HL, Joyce, Janet, Vydia and YiJia. Heh Heh. We walked all the way towards Kallang MRT, then we took the train back to Woodlands. We ate dinner there and went back home.  Yes. By the way, nice fashion, Colin. You matured a lot.   Today   Okie dokie. I mainly did my GP homework today. Heh. I finally succumbed to temptation and only did 'an article every 2 weeks' plan. However, I selected good topics like "Gay Marriages" and "Hate Crimes" to write on, so I got lotsa good and insightful comments. Yes! Heh Heh. So I only did 4 articles. Sue me. :P   Yes! That means I completed myGP homework. YAY for me! 1 down, 1 to go. Only MT left! Even the ducks are meowing at XiaoYanZi! Yes!  Okay. Today is that boring. Right. Not really. Dad was home the whole day. Don't want to work today, I guess. Yeah.  I got very very good news. I can't say what. Oh, very good news that is.  Right. I gotta go write the reward challenge for Survivor RPG. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Righto! Today was supposed to be a free day. Right. Free. The understatement of the year. Meow.  Okie. In the morning I only surfed the net la. Nothing much to talk about.  Heh. Okay. I met Gloria and CQ at CCK. Actually, I met CQ on the train. We went to McDonalds to eat. Me and Gloria ate that 20-piece Chicken McNugget. Meow! How fulling.  Hmm. We were at school quite early. Ayiah. We are going there to measure our sizes and select a pattern for the costume. Hmm.   Well, the process was long and ardous. Actually, it wasn't that bad. We were measured here and there. The design for the guys were somewhat like Chinese communists. Well, not really. Nationalists more like. The collar only. The jacket would be black in colour, while the shirt will be a big pinkish. I don't know what design the girls are gonna wear (they are still designing), but their color will be maroon. According to the wishes of the teachers.  Right. Sigh! I want to throttle the necks of a lot of bodies. First hor, they said wanna go out. Then, last minute, due to some reason or two, all of them cancelled their plans on us. I wasted my moolah you know! I was also very annoyed at that Koo Wen Qiang. Sian dong sian xi! I feel like throttling his neck the most!   Okay. Enough of murdering cats. I went hme, and meowed. Okay. End of story. I don't feel like elaborating much today. Heh. See ya next time. Most probably not tomorrow, because I got SYF Opening Ceremony from 2 till late at night, and I got PW in the morning. Sigh. Saturdays are doomed dates for blogging. Right. Enough rambling. Night! Tata blog!

Chem Bonding to me, is still half bucketful of water. I can't grasp the idea well! Sigh.  Heh. I was forbidden to scare Gloria. Sigh. What to do? I tried to give her a mild scare, but it didn't work. Meow!! Sigh. We were almost late. Even ducks are mooing and meowing.  Sigh. The Chem MCQ is a horror! Ayioh! For 1/3 of the paper, I was wildly making guesses! I swear, I never guessed so much in my entire life! Ayioh! I barely have enough time for the paper! Sigh... How meowing.  Paper 2 ar. At first I was doing quite happily. Then, qi shi wor!! The back questions were tough, and then I only have time for 1.5 essays questions, and I am supposed to do 3. Sigh. Fail le la! Fail le la!  Okay. Depressing business aside. We went home after the exam. Too tired to do anything else. Sigh. Tomorrow also dunnoe do what somemore. Meow. I think I end this entry le la. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!

      Oh my my my my! Okay guys. Before all of you freak out at moi and throw rotten eggs or whatever you have in hand, listen to my plea. I live a busy life these days! Yes! I am so terribly innocent! Okay...lets start with Saturday!   Saturday   Okie dokie. Today is mainly PW day. My group members are coming over to do PW. Yes!   Okay. In the morning I did my PW minutes lor. PW PW PW meows the ducks! Oh why yes!   Okay. I also finished editing Two Fanthoms Deep and am now putting all editions on the pieces of paper into the computer. Yeah. It's going great and all, yeah. I just need more time.   Okie. All of them came at 2.30+. Yep. Okay. Here goes a long long day! First off, Tham wanted us to do reviews for everyone of our articles. I've found out that I've got very very little articles. About 4. Sigh. I die liao la.   After that, we got onto doing group articles. HaHa. We numbered articles and we did them lor. Took us a whole big while. Of course, we chatted while we talked. WE talked about a lot of things, like JH's crush. HaHa.   Yeah. By dinner-time, we still haven't finished yet. They had to go down to 768 to buy dinner back home. I was eating my dinner and watching The Simpsons. After that I went to bath and went back to PWing lor.   Yeah. We finished about 11+. We were each given 2 group reviews, our indiviual reviews and our own PW Written Report chapter to write. Sigh. I also have the added burden of re-arranging the minutes. Sigh. Even ducks would meow at such a workload! I don't think I can do my homework le la. Sigh.   Sunday   Okie dokie! Today 4/5 had a gathering at Sentosa! Wheee!   Okay. We are supposed to meet at 9 at Woodlands Interchange. However, we only set off at 10. Yeah. Ayiah...meow moo.   Okay. We went to this food centre to eat first. After that, we joined the long long queue towards Sentosa.   Yeah. We met Kelvin and Teng Fei at Siloso Beach. Oh boy, was it big? Terribly big! Me, Manda, Cq, SL and XueLin went off to wade a little. HaHa. We even sat down on the pier and dangled our legs in the water. Like that also fun. After that, we went back.  Okay. This is where the nightmare began. Sigh. WQ somehow found a plastic bottle and took great fun with splashing water on me with that blasted thing. I AM SO KILLING THAT IDIOT WHO LITTERED! I don't know what the hell was wrong with him lor. Why des he take sadistic pleasure in torturing me? He needs to have his head checked. Badly.   Sigh. I was dragged into the water. Sigh. First, that GaoLuan tried to pull me in. Luckily, I have nails. I used them. He let go, and I am very proud to say that I inflicted wounds on him. Serve him right. Then, Hann tried. That GL came and attacked me lor. WQ took opportunity to pour more water on me. I hate it la. My clothes are all wet and sticky with sand. I might as well go down. I still hate GL and WQ. Idiots. I inflicted nail wounds on Hann too, but they are not deep. Okay. Sigh of relief. I don't want to hurt Hann. I wish I have Piper's powers. I so badly want to blow WQ up to pieces. So so badly. That's why I don't have powers. I'll misuse them.   Yeah. Wanna hear more stories of WQ's sadist nature? I was like trying to pull him down the sea...then he gave me a hard slap and shouted "My arm's injured la!". Everyone who witnessed was so horrified. How can a friend do that to his friend? Me. I was shocked, but it did not hurt. I got used to it. I guess he must really hate me. Come on. I don't even slap strangers. Or people I hate. Even my friend (cannot reveal name) was telling me to slap back. Sigh. WQ's such an egnima. I don't know how to say la. I hope one day, he feels really guilty for whatever he has done. (I am a big believer of karma. It's gonna catch up on him someday and hit him so hard that he will regret immensely every curel thing he did. A guy can always dream, right? :P) But when that day comes, the sky's gonna fall down. Such creature being capable of guilt? Ha!   Right. Once I stayed in the water, I felt so much like home. I began to connect with Phoebe (A Mermaid's Tail, Charmed Season 5's first episode). The seas's my home. I was unwilling to leave it.   When I left...oh man. I began to feel ill. The sun's very glaring...my sores hurt...I can't see anything and they wanted to play games. I tried to play, but my head hurts.   After a while, we went back into the water again. Oh my...it felt so good! I don't ever want to leave it. I stayed there as long as I could, whilst dodging missles from Hann's rabid 'fans'. HaHa.   After some photos, we finally went to change. Ahh...the first toilet we went to was crowded, so we went to the next. We walked and walked...and finally reached that blasted place. Woah...after taking a shower, I felt so good. Okay, not really. My skin hurts. I got sunburnt. Sigh...  After Sentosa, we went to City Hall. We wanted to catch the fireworks at the Esplanade. Yes! Unfortunately, KH decided to tag along. I was like O.O! Most of us don't like him lor. I was like "I don't want him around, but as long as he doesn't bother me, I don't care".   We ate lor. After that, we went to the Padang to watch the fireworks. We reached there about 7.40, but it doesn't start till 8.30. We chit-chatted. Meow moo!   WoW! The fireworks were spectacular! It's like so meowful! So beautiful. During the climax, you can really feel the whole place shaking with each BOOM BOOM BOOM! So nice. You really had to be there to enjoy it. Watching it on TV isn't the same.   We went back lor. HaHa! I want to laugh to death! HaHa! Xiao shu lin wor! That WQ tried to sabo me. He was trying to make everyone tell me ghost stories so that I would be scared when walking back home. I tried to point out the fact that I got Janet besides me. He can't listen, or he pretended not to. Either way, SL told her NP ghost stories and CQ narrated MeiTing's experience. That WQ was scared shitless and he was like saying "Stop leh..I am going home alone". I was like so laughing myself to tears! Who was the one who wanted people to tell ghost stories de ar? HAHAHAHA! This is caled retribution! HAHAHA! Zhi tao ku chi! HAHAHAHA!   Okay. I went back, bathed and slept.   I enjoyed today, because I got to meet all my 4/5 friends again. I had a great time! I felt so happy being able to talk to people like Amanda, Zue Lin and Shin Han again. HaHa. I didn't regret going to today's outing. :D   Today   Okay. Today we are going to Clementi's KTV World. Yeah. We met at Causeway Point and went there lor. We waited for PY and Joyce before going to sing.  Like again, they don't have English songs. Not new ones. I felt quite proud of myself for singing quite a bit. I might have gone off-pitch at times, but I enjoyed myself. :)   After that, we went to Causeway Point. They wanted to eat KFC, but it was full, so they went to Marsiling instead. Oh yes. I brought Ocean Ou De Yang's album. His songs are very very nice. Especially Xiu Xiu Xiu! YES!! Nice album. $18.95 didn't go wasted.   Okay. We went to Marsiling and waited for CQ and PY to come. They finally came and I was like a sigh of relief. Someone else to talk to at last. Other than the girls (who I have no problems connecting with), I felt pretty bored. Yeah. Me, Gloria, CQ and WQ shared a meal. Yeah.   We sat down and talked lor. Ayioh...all of them started to talk about me and WQ. They went "Oh! You slapped KY ar?". HaHa! Don't know what their intentions are, but of course, they are standing by me. Who would agree with the slapper, and not the victim. Unless they hate the victim la, but they don't hate me. :P Anyhoo, they were like saying me and WQ don't talk. Yeah, true. He didn't want to talk to me de ma. I mean, today's conversations between us right, he was either insulting me or talking about stupid things. Why can't I read the newspaper slowly? That idiot feels the need to poke his nose into my reading speed. Siao. I didn't talk to him, and basically avoided him lor. Yeah, some of my excuses for not sitting besides him were lame (my butt's too big for the space in between him and HuiLing), but the "sun shining on my neck" reason was really true ma. If he expects me to be friendly after that bullying yesterday, I think he must be off his rocker.   We also talked about a whole lot more of things. HaHa. Mainly about Joyce's life as the rich Mrs Ong (Joyce la, who else?) and her married life with Mr Ong. HAHA! So funny one. We were laughing ourselves to bits.   Okay. So we went home at 6+. I didn't miss the choir singing at all. Okay, I missed two while in the shower. The choir sang a pathetic amount of songs this year. I wonder why they cut away the choir time. Stupid people. This year's NDP was not so bad la. I only slept for 5 minutes. HaHa!   After NDP came Singapore Idol. Yeah, I liked that show. I really liked Gurmit the host. I felt that he was the 'big brother' when he was comforting Rocky Wang. So loving. The contestants were not bad. I didn't met anyone who WOWed me, but I find a lot of them whiny. The judges are not bad. Ken Lim looks very strict, and he's brutual and honest. The rest of the judges are more outgoing and friendly, and they know their stuff la. Yeah.   After that was online time, and then Friends. Joey can't speak French correctly to save his life. HaHa! So funny!   Okay. I gotta go le. It's about 13.36am Tuesday. Woah. Tired le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

      Meowing moo! As expected, there was no blogging yesterday! Meow moo meow! Let me narrate!   Thursday   O.O!! Even ducks were meowing and quacking and mooing! What a day!! Okay...  In the morning was nothing much la. Chem Prac was meowing and the anions are maddening! Yes! Okay...today isn't much fun. Except Physics Practical. HaHa. Me, Kelvin, JiaHao and CQ talked and talked. I found out that Yu Yi, this girl JH likes, is in choir. I..er-hmm...helped JH send a poem to her. O.O!! :P  Righto. Today choir, we had the parade rehearsals again! Weee! This time, Mr Sars is very happy with us. O.O!! O.O!! What a surprise! I guess we are all happy bout that. Hmm...we went back to practise.   Guess what? We have to assemble at 6.30 tomorrow! Sigh. I got my father to drive Boon Chai, Gloria and CQ to school. HaHa! That solved the transport issue. Even ducks would meow everywhere! We practised till 9. Can you believe it? 9? Yeah...it was so darn late. I reached home at 10, bathed and quickly ate dinner. Even cats have no time nor energy to come online yesterday. Thus, explained the lack of a blog entry.  Ayioh...Boon Chai and CQ told ghost stories in the train you know! Me and Gloria were scared to death! Even Gloria and I talked about  A LOT  of things on the way home. h why yes! A lot! While walking home myself, I even had to call WQ to keep my company. HaHaHa!    Today   O.O! Oh my my my my! Today, it was a very early time to go to school. Why yes! I even had to call CQ and Gloria up. That CQ ar! Very funny leh. He actually went to the station at 5! O.O!   Right. We [icked Gloria, CQ and Boon Chai up at Admiralty Station without much mishap. 'Cept that BC was late for a bit, however, we ended up being early in school. Weee!   Okie dokie. After lotsa practises, we finally performed. The parade performance was meowingly okay. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Yeah...we went up to the hall. Now, that's when the fun started.   Of course, choir is the finale (best of the last ma :P). The front parts were pretty boring. Especially the quiz time. MOST especially the quiz time. I fell asleep then. HaHaHa!   Okay. It was choir's turn to entertain the crowd. John told us yeterday that for years, community singing is mainly "the whole shcool looks at the choir singing" kinda thing. This year, we are so gonna change that. Yep.   Indeed, we injected spice into their lives. We went up there with our silly moves and roused the crowds. I was grinning all the way. Heck if I sang wrongly! I was so enjoying myself! When I went up there, I saw that S22 was sitting near the front. When they spotted me, CQ and JS, their eyes went like O.O! HaHa! They also danced along to Home. I was like beaming like mad. So happy that my class was so supportive and outgoing! HaHaHa!   After the concert, we were so happy. The teachers were telling us that we did a gret job and all. We stayed back for photos taking and more song singings! HaHa! Choir is so cool! Weee! Three cheers and three cheers and three cheers for choir! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! WEEE!!!  After that fun morning session, staying back late countless of times this week is so totally worthed it! After the celebration, we went to foodcourt to eat. Me, Janet, WQ and CQ eventually went to the foodcourt to eat. HaHa. We met JiaHao they all there. JH was jealous that I got to hold Yu Yi's hand. She was besides me ma. HaHa. I even held her back lor. :P I bet that JH would never accomplished what I did. HaHaHa! Not that I am interested in Yu Yi, but I can tease him with it. Muhahaha! I am sooo evil.  After that, we went home lor. Actually, me and CQ did. Janet and WQ went to bowling. Now, I am going to library to meet CQ, Gloria and WQ to do homework. I think I am only doing my Maths and Chem. HaHaHa. Meow moo!   So...see ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!  Stand..up...for...Sing--ga--pore!!! Do....the...best....you....can.....!!!!

      Heya! Okay. To summarize: Today's a sucky day. Yes!  Okay. Lessons weren't so bad. I mean, they were pretty boring, but nothing much happened really. Well, I came out with a marvellous story plot for my Chinese compo, and I was so happy! HaHaHa!   YaY! I beta'ed two pages of Kelly's story. HaHa! I noticed a couple of interesting things about her. I shall not reveal it here, of course, to protect her privacy. Meow moo!  Okay. Today's choir was sucky in general. In general. Right. Let me start from the beginning.   Right. I thought it was a private practise, but only to discover that we had Hall rehearsals. Darn.   Okay. Basically it went horribly. First there was the mike problems. Secondly, we can't co-ordinate with our lives! Our dance steps sucks. Sigh. I was moved constantly. I ended up standing in between Gen Sheng and Jun Sheng. Why must I be made to stand near JS everytime? Issit my bad luck?!  Okay. Today, that teacher-in-charge, Miss Kumar, got pissed at the choir. I don't know why, her mood suddenly became foul and started being bitchy. She got so pissed off with us that she placed the Dance Club to sing with us, and ordered us to tuck our t-shirts ALL IN.   Fuck. What is this? She added the Dance club because, apparently it seemed to her, we have no life on stage. Oh! So she thinks the dancers are more lively la! She thinks that they can do better than us la! She thinks that they are so multi-talented enough to dance AND sing. Why not scrape off the choir from the performance list and let the multi-talented dancers do everything? Sheez! Some people have no brains. At all. Then the tucking all in part. Not even folding out a little. What kind of stupid rule is that? Even Mr Kuek doesn't mind leh. Tucking everything in looks so boring (and honestly, geeky). Whoever with a sane mind does that? Sigh...I am so appalled at the horrible teachers leh. One foul mood and they decided to be super bitchy and made life hell for us students. Such teachers should jump off the building. I mean, the students are so innocent loh. When I am a teacher, I wouldn't do that to my students. Even I have more morals and integrity! Take that, Miss Usha Kumar!!!  Right. Following that ugly episode, all of us were like so wanting to boycott her. John pointed out that although it would be nice to do that (and show her who's boss! She can't just come in here and bitch her way around us!), but it would be a waste of our efforts if we just boycott because of a stupid event. Why don't we prove her wrong. I mean, we are good. We know that. We wanted to show her that she was so damn wrong in picking on us. We devised a set of our moves, and we are so not informing the Dancers. Let them dance their own moves, or fumble while trying to mimic us. The dancing was so damn fun! We are sooo evil. I was enjoying myself singing while moving to funny actions. :D Great job, choir! Keep it up! We can do it!!  Coming back, it was already 9. Luckily I don't have homework wor, or else I wouldn't even be online now, ranting about the ugly side of life. Yes!   Okie. I gotta go. See ya next time (Don't think I am blogging tomorrow. Coming back late due to choir, and I expect that there'll be Chem Prac homework). TaTa! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! I'm so sorry for not blogging yesterday! I came back really really late, and can only come online at 11! Choir ended late, and let me tell you, it's gonna happen tomorrow and Thursday too. So, don't expect entries from these two days. Yeah. Right. Lets begin on....   Monday   Right. What happened yesterday? Lets go down in chronological order. Right. That poor pitiful KWQ!! His hand is in such a heavy heavy cast! Oh my meowing mooing lord! So ke lian!   We had no PE today, so we had 1.5hours free! Wheee! How fun is it to be free? Very fun! What did we do ar? Bascially, I just lazed around while CQ did Chem. HaHa!   Okay. Something very interesting happened in GP today. Hmmm! That MCP made a terribluy narrow-minded comment! Yes! He incurred the wrath of everyone in S22! Weeee! Now his unpopularity is on the rise! Even ducks could meow at that. Basically hor, he said that ITE students are all stupid and they all smoke and dye hair. At that comment, everyone went 'OEI' and shouted "narrow-minded!". Even Khairul wanted to punch him. HaHaHa! Benjamin shot down every single of that MCP's points, and everytime he did, all of us applauded! HaHaHa! Wheee! When class ended, everyone went out of the class muttering how nuts is that MCP is. HaHa!   Right. After that classes are boring. Okay. Choir. Today's choir we had rehearsals with the band. We went out at 6 to practise singing the National Anthem with the band. I remember all too well during my Sec3 years, where the choir and band collaborated to disastrous results! I hope RS won't repeat past mistakes! Ergh...it was horrible. They couldn't hear us sing! Here we were, blasting our guts out loud and getting really tired, and what do we get? Criticism! Ergh! Ergh! Ergh! Actually, choir today wasn't that horrible la. At the end, we sang John's song (the rap part) so nicely that he was so happy about it and everyone's mood perked up! YaY! Finally! :D  Okay. Coming back, I am swamped with homework. I have to do Chemistry and also 3 mini-book reviews for Chinese. Sigh...I finally completed at 11! Oh yes! Phoebe finally got married (I forgot the groom's name! AHH!)! YAY!! Monica the control-slave-wedding planner is so totally hilarous! HAHA!   Tuesday   Right. What did we do today? Relatively little. It's kinda boring la. Yeah. Me and CQ kept asking Miss Yee about Physics assignment. HaHa! It looked like I've made a mistake with calculations. HaHa! Silly old me.   WQ removed his cast! O.O His right arm is still numb though. It practically has no feelings in it at all! O.O Poor thing!! Ayioh!   Right. Guess what? I've signed on to being a beta on FictionAlley. HaHa! Beta basically means I am an editor for authors. So far, only two has signed on with me. I am not sure about one, whether he wants me or not. I am currently editing the second's fic, and I loved it a lot! There are some errors, but not too much to make the pages red! Heh heh! I am so having fun.  Of course, I wanted to try writing a fic. I am now writing for this Title Challenge. I chose the title  Fear Of Flying  to write about. I am asking if my storyline would suit the title. I want to touch on the metaphorical 'flying', not the actual physical one. Yep.   Ya know what? I gotta get going now. I am so darn tired! See ya next time, eh? TaTa! Night blog!

      Hey Hey! What a jolly day! Jolly well! Jolly well!  Yes! Today morning was quite nice. Very nice. I was reading fics and such. HaHa. I forgot the links... Oh yes! There's one.  urlLink The Worst Happiest Day Of His Life   A very very hilarious fic! Tis H/D slash. HaHa! HAHA!   Right. In between reading slashes and watching QianQian and eating dinner, I waited for 2 to come.  I am supposed to meet Hann and his PW group at Woodlands Interchange. I was slightly late and only Hann came. Heh Heh. The other people are still coming over, so me and Hann explored around Causeway Point.   His PW members started arriving. First there was this YaoHua. She gave me the impression that she was quite cold. Then this MiaoMaio came. She waved hi. Oh i meow! Er...I forgot the last one's name. She waved back too.  I brought them to my house to watch the video I helped them record. HaHa. I was busy with my other stuff, naming surfing FictionAlley.   HaHa. Later Hann came in and I helped him with his project, which is finding plastic surgeons to interview. HaHa. Soon we are all sending them emails. Actually, I helped to type their emails, because I did that before.   Yeah. They did project till 6, then they left. Hann has to stay over to do some more project work. We went out to eat dinner.  HaHa! It was refreshing to chat with Hann. Catching up with old times. HaHaHa! Always great to catch up with old buddies! We chatted and chatted. Ha! We even talked about that rat MCP. OOOO! I've found out that he talked about me and CQ toHann, say what, we are always together and not with the class and don't know why/how we can be together for so long. That's none of his freaking business man! Ergh! I am so telling CQ!  Right. When we came back, it was already 7+. HaHa! I bathed first, then continued to chat with Hann and helped him with his project. He left at 8+, and I walked him to the bus-stop because it was raining. We sang "Home" all the way there. HeHe! Glad to have him around! :D  Right! After that,I came back and read Per Solum Lacuna. New chapter out!! Weee! Harry and Draco finally met! Oh my my!! What a cliffhanger! Oh yes! A very badddd cliffie! Now, the main concern is: How are they gonna turn from enemies to lovers? Does it happen over the next chapter or span across agonizingly over few chapters? O.O!! I am so excited to find out!   Why yes! My video for "Centennial Charmed" has been downloaded completely! Gotta go watch it! TaTa! Night blog!
