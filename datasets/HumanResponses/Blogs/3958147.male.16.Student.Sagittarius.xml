       Just for laughs (more jokes to come!)    Gizmo: Are you superstitious? Dave: Shhhhh! It’s bad luck to be superstitious.         The only man who ever got his work done by Friday was Robinson Crusoe!         Teacher: What is 24 times 8?   Pupil: 192.   Teacher: That's very good.   Pupil: Whaddya mean very good? It's absolutely perfect.       In my hand I hold a ball             White and dimpled, rather small Oh, how harmless it does appear             This innocent looking little sphere By its size I could not guess             The awesome power it does posess But since I fell beneath its spell             I’ve been through the fires of hell. My life hasn’t been quite the same             Since I chose to play its game. It rules my mind for hours on end             A fortune it has had me spend It has made me curse and cry             And hate myself and want to die It promises me a thing called “par”             If I can hit it straight and far To master such a tiny ball             Should not be very hard at all But my desires the ball refuses             And does exactly as it chooses. It hooks and slices, dribbles and dies             Or disappears before my eyes. Often it will have a whim             To hit a tree or take a swim With miles of grass on which to land             It finds that tiny patch of sand Then has me offering up my soul             If it would first drop in the hole It’s made me whimper like a pup             And swear that I would give up And take to drink to ease my sorrow             But the ball knows I’ll be back tommorow.

       If you're having a bad day, check out these actual cases!       Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and facemask. A postmortem test revealed that the man died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clothed diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire.You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Some day it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.     A man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, his wife nearby in the kitchen. While racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors. His wife, hearing the crash, ran into the room to find her husband cut and bleeding, the motorcycle, and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the paramedics and escort them to her husband. While the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to pick up the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet. After being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the cigarette butt between his legs.The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, she once again phoned for an ambulance. The same paramedic crew was dispatched. As the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them. They started laughing so hard that one of them slipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.     The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both.     A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his Walkman.

       Tired but happy...This afternoon was like a "Praying For a Rain God" day. Everyone dreamed of going home. It was the last day of Trial 1 and we did it. The last paper was the most nerve-breaking. Anyway, there will be lots of people online tonight, I think. So gentlemen, start your engines!!!
