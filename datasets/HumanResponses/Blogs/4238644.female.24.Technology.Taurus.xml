        Well it's either clean my bathroom or play on the internet..... I think you can guess which activity won.      My life is consumed by work lately. I live for Fridays and am not enjoying my job anywhere near as much as I used to. It's alright, but I guess the saving grace of my sanity is the people I have the pleasure of working with. I've made some good friends at work and we all get to bitch about how much our jobs suck. I never used to do that a year or so ago.... I need that footy tipping prize, get away from it all at the company's expense. ;)      9 weeks and 2 days to go (but who's counting?)

        My plans to go to Canada in October are coming along nicely. I've booked my flight, organised my accommodation in Vancouver and other little bits and pieces with IEP. If only I had a bottomless pit of money I could go there to ski the whole season without having to work!      Hopefully I can get a kickass job there which lets me ski a lot. I've managed to find a few other aussies and a girl from England doing the same as me so perhaps i've already found a few friends I can meet up with over there. Only 9 1/2 weeks to go! wuwu!      Only downer is having to leave behind my friends. I'd love to take so many people with me but alas, its not to be. I also hate having to move out of my awesome unit. It's not easy finding such a good place and after seeing other friends looking for places close to the city with all the ins and outs, only reminds me how lucky I was to find this place. Ah well, I'm sure I'll find something good when I come home. Not something to stress too much over now. TO CANADA!

        So I am now a dork... I mean a blogger. So many other people do this and so many of those use thier blog as quasi diary, so I thought I'd give it a burl. No promises to keep it going though. ;)  Filling out the "about me" bits of the blogger setup was kinda silly. I hate those things anyway, so why am I volunteering myself? I must be tired..      Check out my website  urlLink www.fionacannon.net  - it's only in the making, so nothing is really functional yet.      Maybe I can use this as a way of listing my life's ambitions.... then again.... maybe not. Let's not get too carried away. ;) How about I just finish customising my bloggin' site and go from there? I'll add a photo later when I get a good one. (ha)    Let's see what this thing can do....
