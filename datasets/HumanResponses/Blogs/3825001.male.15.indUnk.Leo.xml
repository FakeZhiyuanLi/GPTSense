      I have decided to put together an online coven. I met this really cool guy who is good at everything he does, which is alot! He is like the male Martha Stewart. lol. He is a Reiki master, he has his own computer type buisness. He is a healer, and he knows EVERYTHING about the occult. So he helped me with alot of my site, pointed me in the right direction. I mean he knows the two main things that I need. Websites, and magick. So I got alot done today, still have alot to go, but this is a project. Projects arent finished in a day, at least ones like these arent. Here is a link to the covens Homepage.  urlLink www.geocities.com/witch247us/ &nbsp;There are currently no members, but&nbsp;I expect them to start coming farly soon. I think a few of them might even be my local friends here in Forest Grove. Well I have to go to bed, It is 12:30 AM after all. lol. I love summer! :D

      &nbsp;Oh my god, I was stung by this fat azzed wasp today. It hurt so bad I had to devote a whole post to it. I was helping my Dad clean out his trunk today at like 12:30, when all of a sudden I fealt the smallest pinch on the inside of my calf. I looked down thinking it was somthing in my pants poking me. No, it was a wasp! It looks stuck, but I hit it if and I think it died, it just layed there, then alot more came, I guess because I killed one of them. But that thing hurt for a good 3 hours! It was the smallest darkest red dot I had ever seen, it hurt like a good four inches all around the thing. After I hit it off me, I went into Grannys house and put an ice pack on it for about 20 minutes. I think that was the only reason it didnt swell. To bad it didnt take the pain with it. Well I have to post about my new website. Or online coven.

      &nbsp;Wow, I just got back from the track. That was like the first time I have ran for like 3 years! lol. Prety sad hu? Well I can tell that I am VERY out of shape, I hope to run once a day though. Just to make sure that I dont become a lazy blog, or more of one that is. It actully feels good to run, well after it feels good. I can breathe alot easier after I get done running. I think clearer. And I feel like I am floating, I think that is the natural high it gives you. I actully did prety good for not running in a VERY long time. To start I walked around the track 3 times. Then I slowly started to run. The best I think I did was running half way around the track without stopping. Then I walked the other half. The last thing I did before we left was ask Dad to time me, I wanted to see how long it would take me to run all the way around the track. I ran half way, then walked for about 3 minutes then I started running again. The exact time was 5 minutes 34 seconds. Not bad for a over-weight slug hu? lol. Just kidding. I know I am not that over weight. It wouldent hurt to loose a few pounds, but I am not going to obsess over it anymore! It hurts the soul to dump on yourself about your apperince. What I have been learning to do is flant all I got. Meaning I allways have a positive attitude about my body now. Well I dont allways have that attitude, I tend to fall into hate modes once in a blue moon, but I am getting better. I just look at how I was last year, and laugh. I have improved my attitude about 45%! Go me! Well I am off to bed. Have a nice night.

      &nbsp;My wonderful Mommy just took me to see "A Cinderella Story". It was a very cute movie. I love Hilary Duff anyway, but she played a very cute girl in this movie. It was a bit on the mooshy side, but there was also alot of comedy, like her step-mother. I love that woman in EVERYTHING she is in. She is such a hilarious person. Well after we where done watching the movie me and my mom went over to Fred Myers. I got some more plants and herbs for my garden. She also got some stuff that her and Dad like. I got two of these really cool looking flowers. I think there called a ballon flower. Well when there in bud form they are in a little purple baloon type thing, then they burst into a 4 petaled purple flower. I also got a sunflower plant to put in front of my blue berry bush. It looks nice all ready. I got some "Lemon Balm", this stuff smells just like lemmons and this lady told us to more love and attention I give it the more the smell will grow. I took that as dont forget about the thing and water it well and I will have a nice smelling herb to add to my morning tea. My mom got herself a normal sized tomato bush, because I had gotten a cherri tomato bush a while ago and she doesnt like them as much as the regular ones. She also got herself a celantro plant, because she puts the stuff on everything she eats, well all most. She got Dad a jalepeno bush, which is all ready grown quite a bit. Thats about all the new stuff for the outside garden, but I got myself two herbs to grow in my window. I got a purple sage, and a english lavandar to grow in my window. I will get you some pictures of all my new garden plants as soon as I can, probubly tomorrow. I will also be getting a picture of each of my family members soon, because this is my journal, and I would like to include my family in it. Well I have to go wash up, Talk to you tomorrow.

       This is Tara. She is, as you can see an albino hamster. She will get more and more white as she ages. I have had her sence she was a little pink blog in a corner with about 10 others. Out of all of them she is the one I chose the keep. She is about a year old, give or take a few weeks. I love her like a family member. She is turning out to be just like her mommy, a close friend.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      &nbsp;I was working in my garden today for a few hours. I thought that it was doomed. But its starting to gain its beaty. I moved my two english lavandars that where in the back closer to the front so I could reach them with the hose, because they need more than a squirt with water. I need to make sure they are clean. So I give them a light misting after every water treatment. Just to keep them fresh looking. My blueberrys arent giving me much, but I expect them to get use to where they are within the upcoming weeks. I am so excited to get those bushes strong and fertile. My purple sage is also thriveing quite well. They didnt take as long as all the other herbs to recoop. Infact I wish that all my other herbs did as well as the sage did. They where only in shock mode for about 3 days. My catnip has gone to the cats. I think that If I dont see them start to grow I am just going to take them out and replace them with another herb. It is a waster to keep somthing there that just attracts annoying strays. I will grow it in my window seil. This isnt about the garden but I got a really prety Betta about a day ago. I will add a picture of him after I post this, but he has a black body with redish fins. I have him in this prety Betta bowl right now, but I hope to get a mini aquariam, somthing I can put some "Betta Buddys" in with him. I am thinking a snail or two, and some sort of a bottom feeder to pick up after everyone. Well I am going to upload that pic now, I also have a few pics of my hamster, Tara.

      &nbsp;Well, I really cant remember what has been going on since I last posted, so I will just start with today. Today was a very slow day for me, I dont know why but I feel like I am spinning into a depression I had in 7th grade. Except I am better at hiding it from family than I was back then. So I will just keep trying and trying to remove it from me. The weird thing is, is nothing has happend that would upset me. I mean I have my garden slowly crawling into its beaty. My birthday is a month away, I have a cell finally. I dont know. I think I might be a bit worried about the lack of FRIENDS that I have. I mean really, I have alot of people that I get along with, but no real friends to speak of. Not one of them actully cares. That may be my fault actully, but I have been shaping it up the past year. Infact I think that because I was nice this year, people drifted away because they thought I was trying to be somthing I wasnt. Which is not at all true. The whole I am mean thing was totally a sheild from people and there thoughts on me. I dont care anymore. If somone does not like me then they are not going to be in my life. End of story. I dont need the emotional crap this year. Yes, I will have friends and I will socialize, but my grades are at the top of my list on things to keep up on. That and my mental and physical health. Well that was even to deep for me, so I need to repost with a subject more lively.

       Guess what tooter did yesterday. She got out and she started playing with the catnip again. She goes over to it and she sniffs it for a while then she licks then she chews. After she has it in her system she gets a little loopy and starts rolling in it. I had to cut her off and throw her in the garage. I am planning on buying some more and just growing it in a pot in my bedroom window. That would work alot better, plus I have been wanting some freakin nature in my room anyway! Talk to you later.

       This is a close up of the famous catnip. My Grannys cat got outside and was loving this stuff! I went to pull her off of it, but we could see she was so wrapped up in it I had to pull her away from it hissing and scratching. She was rolling around in this like a pig in mud. So I put her in the house and snipped her a leaf. If I cant grow this stuff out there because of the local cats I am going to move it into my window. lol.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       I just feel like posting, so I will talk about what I did last night. My two cousins Jessica and Miranda came over. Miranda watched "Bedazzled", and me and Jessica watched "Rat Race". That is the funniest movie ever! I love it, its like the only thing Whoopi ever plays in that she is calm and not spouting off her mouth. Its... Refreshing. But her Daughter is like Whoopi when it comes to most of her parts. Jessica is going to stay the night tonight. I need to figure out somthing to do, first I have to clean up my room because I hated staying the night at there house when there room was messy, so I think they think the same. lol. And it needs to be cleaned becasue I am not a messy person it just looks like it because I am lazy. lol. That must be changed to. Talk to you later.

I dont think anyone is going to see the pattern but I like it and because it is my garden thats all that matters.

       We where only camping for one day! Jeez. Dad said that if it rained we would have to wait a day after it stopped because the tent would have been way to wet to put away, so we decided to leave before it started to rain. And when I say we I mean him. I wanted to stay so bad! Hali was there, I was so excited to see her. She is so cool, we have alot in common. Which is not usual for me. I hope to hang out with her alot more this summer. We might start to run together. Maybe go on an eating plan. lol. Because we both have bodies that we want to change. I am not saying her bodie is bad, just saying she has a problem with it. We only had one campfire, because we where only there for one night. But I was wanting to have at least 4! At least I got to run up the hill at Barveiw jetti. Me and Hali went up and went down on the other side, her mom thought we where just going to run up and then run down, so she came up looking for us. So when she called we had to run up the hill which was VERY steep. But there was a little pond and everything on the other side, with a swing. All very prety. But when we finally got up that steep hill we ran down the sand hill I thought I would hit Halis moms car at like 90 miles per hour. lol. I love doing that, its like your running without any effort. Well I am going to go, me and my dad are going to go get some stuff for the garden. Hopefully we get some stuff planted today! Wish me luck )0( Blessed Be )0(

This is going to be a very relaxing trip for me. There is a poll there, so I hope to catch some more tan while I swim. I am also going to try a prosperity spell over there by the water. So I will not be posting for the next 4 days, but I will tell you all about my trip when I get back. Well I have to go pack. Talk to you later.

       Yay, another holiday to celebrate. This year is going to be a very small group of people, but thats ok. Its going to be me, my mom and dad, and my Granny. Where just gona have a small BBQ, witch corn, potatos, and steaks! Then we are going to set off a few fireworks. Everyone else in our family are to occupied in there own selfish lives to spend time with there family. I am not going to name any names, but if you know my emidiate family you will know who is not at the BBQ are the selfish ones. But enough with sounding bitter, I am going to make this fun for everyone.

       We finally got my garden bed all rotilled and got its last dose of fertilizer in. Now all we have to do is wait, and get the plants and the extar goodies. Which is all coming outa my pocket ): But thats cool, becasue I will know that I made somthing cool with my own money and out of my own time. I dont really know what to think about that soi though... I mean its EXTREMLY light, the slightest step you sink. I dont know what to do about it. But I plan on having the blueberry bush at the top center of my garden and having other things growing as you go down, and having a patch of grass in the center where I can be. Its gona be so cool when I get everything all put together. So if you have any tips you can pass on for a newb gardener I would be gald to take them. Talk to you later.

       Today after I was done watering I walked down to my Grannys and I added another layer of the fertilizer. I mixed it in and then lightly watered it. I found this weird red barrel barried up to its tip about. Full of ashes and twigs. I went in and asked my Granny what it was, and she said it was my Grandpa's old compost barrel. I was so excited becasue I knew she was going to say I could use it. So I went and got all the weeds around that barrel and added it to it. Before that I added a thin layer of moist dirt at the bottem. Then I went into the front yard where all of her flowers are. She had these really weird vine type things growing outa control all around her flowers and I weeded them ALL out. That took me like an hour to do. But I took all those and added it to my compost pile. I would really like to know what those weeds where because they grow back in like 2 weeks and there really hard for Granny to get rid of because of her back. So I will post a picture of the weeds soon and if you know what they are and how to get rid of them I would really be greatful. I think tomorrow me and my dad are going to roditill the hell out of my garden with his new Honda roditiller. This soil is like clay and it is harder than a rock like 8 inches below. So I am looking foward to that.

       Well hello my new blog. That sounds a bit weird. I am just posting this to see how it will look. Well right now I am at my Grandpas and I am watering his flowers and stuff. He is outa state for a while. I love working in the garden. I am starting one at my Grannys. She has this land of dirt in her back yard and its really dence and clay like so I rotilled it up and watered it. Sorta got it to like dirt, then I went out and bought some of this fertilizer to make clay like dirt enriched with nutrients and stuff. All very exciting for me. I can not wait to get some stuff planted in there. I know I am going to have a blueberry bush in there. I would like some choice herbs in ther and some flowers. Maybe even some sun flowers. I am so happy that I finally started on this. I have been wanting to start a garden for like 2 years now. Well I am going to get a bit more use to the controls on this site. So I will talk to you later.
