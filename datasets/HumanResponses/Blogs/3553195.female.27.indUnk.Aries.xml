      Here is where Zorba recorded my measurements.  The chalkboard rinsed and the numbers frisked.  Pinkly.  Prickly.  Here the eraser clapped.  The clap of thunder.  Under the desks, and Zorba tolled the log truck.  Here is where a ninety degree angle.  A hummingbird knocking.   Too late in the season, I measured the red syrup, I ran the funnel to the vial, to the window where we seated.  In a row.  Zorba, her little nephew, her shotgun, myself.  Bubblegum.  Bubblegum.

      A wiggle in the eyelid.  Zorba pronounced it and I performed it.  Half-hearted.  Half-lobed.  He noted. Which fabric bore a renegade variation.  The elastic bodice held tight my premonitions, while, all that while, the hem crept close and skimmed my knees.  A pin, you maintain.  A pin you paint his name on, and, like  a baton, with which he directs.

      Enclosed, please find Zorba's lamb shank.  Please find a coveted booklet. A prerequisite.  In the future, when you shadow, please find a subtle  distinction between street and theatre.  I craze the window in her butchered sedan.  I leverage her documents, spilling from the console.  Figure these.  Repeat.

      In Amherst.  In the Dallas Room.  Bring a bag up there with you. Cleaned out, sprayed down.  Take a sample from its purveyor and a complementary yee-haw.    The vote was split.  I said aye and Zorba nay.  We cannot expect you.  About half as much.  The bone should be no shock, the crew raise no brow, and the terminal degree a full plow.  In summation.  A currency of dogs from wolves, of foxes tamed, the Siberian scientist lonely in his foxglove, leveraged by the farmers.  They run as puppets do.  They travel in style.  Do tell.

      Gets weaker when you treat her like a queen. Gets stuck  in Juarez when it's raining. And it's  Easter time too. Reconciled, she's gonna be up for awhile.               Bleeding, but not so as you'd notice. Tied  to furniture she's never been tied to.               Electricity howls in the bones. In her brand new  leopard pill box. Dear Black Johannes,  I found it in a plaited hair. Zorba  took the steps by two, requesting  your temperature. Your. Dear Black Johannes,  each letter was doubled and written  for a look in the mirror. Each letter  forged from a tentacle. Each tentacle.  Lashed.

      Please adminster the Rorschach. Zorba's needing.  Please locate her on your hilarious spectrum. Catch her  baking your cookies near Christmas.  The Christmas tree. On fire. Again. Proverbial. When you read this like a telegraph stop you will know stop I made it out stop alight.  Take stop the metro.  Heart the passage and the krylon walls.

      I will only wear the speculums for so long. In the basement, Zorba completes his psychogeographical survey. He reminds me of the the time he locked himself in with the Demerol. Of the time he dismantled the knob on the bathroom door. Scissor. When I eagled the orange. Kitchen carpet. Permit me. I siphon a vowel with which to respond.

      The f-up was the industrial red dye.  The connection was bogus.  In the morning, I glued your robin's nest to the sill. Zorba ratchets like a turnstile.   In the cedar closet, he discovered the microscope.  A corrugation. I secured in an earring the grain of salt.  The pencil shaving. Meant for a ticket.  Meant for a placard.  Meant for a vial of progesterone.

      Zorba's winding her bedsheet.  In a tunnel, there are two forks. Two crows with a winch.  I'm enclosing the tourniquet.  Credulous.

      The laundry's overdone.&nbsp; Zorba cites bleach, cites propane tank.&nbsp; I've rerouted the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; From the dryer.&nbsp; Against the limestone, the forecast bleeds.&nbsp; From the inside, I pack the belly.&nbsp; Zorba checks. Check-minuses.&nbsp; Here the fairy's ring, the collar striated, compromised. &nbsp; He circles in lipstick the lipstick print lips.&nbsp; In lipstick the grease,  which angles like a tumor and renders a window where once  was a badge.&nbsp; Puppet.&nbsp; Read the bottle and it says faction.&nbsp;  &nbsp; A faction of the time.

      The slick heel of your hand has left a print on the glass topped table. Please advise.  Zorba frets the punctuation.  Zorba establishes his case of fine jewels and silver monies.  He repairs his watch chain  at the sideboard. He shoots a look.  In the morning,  we will be forced to further.  The progeny gets it.  The prim cupboard turns its back and we thirst, we detail, we dip the pendant like a spoon into the broth, the tumbler is whole.  Your advice will follow?  Please advise.

      Zorba's lights are out behind the ply.  If you press your ear to the slip of gust.  If you press your limb from left to right. The composition reads, records the riptide on your brow.   You would have to stammer.  Against my femur.  You will have to stammer against my femur.

      Rotate the cord neatly in its socket.  The sandpaper retired, but the powder on the cement belies.  From here, you employ a stethoscope, a valve that is shaped as such and a string with no center.  In otherwords, not braided.  To detangle.  Information.  Dote on me, now.  Recite the story you heard Zorba whisper againstmy swathing.  As a smallpox.  I wore slippers that shuttled me out of the incubator, onto the interlocking.  I am meant to measure you with a metal device.  Which device resembles a hole punch.  I am meant to trick you onto this scale, situating a small cake in a checkered cloth over the rubber lap.  The result, Zorba said, would indicate.  A clip-art.  A whiteout silhouette of finger, with a destination engraved, as though a walkable distance, but rather less specific.  As though regular   from point to point, the needle spinning now a scarf,  now an absence, an abscess, a crocodile's price.

      I see your former California through this pickle jar.  The chestnut of its coastline, Zorba's first lover crowned in its postmark.  The zoo  then rife with fruit and wine, the trolley with a whisking of hair  and cellulose glue. I see your California bloodmoss, aphrodisiac, plenty.  What paunches they developed, what circumspect manners.  A pinky  in the dishdrain, the telephone in a civilized outfit.  The man himself had an electronic addition.  He buzzed in the foyer, the wrinkle in his chest pocket sang, it was the decaffeinated eye of the nightingale story.  I rang my knife on the edge of the glass.  I asked for water.  And water again.  And was my bear wound, was my wince against the bedskirt, was my different illness from yours--

      I trail your feathered leavings.  I see around the ground-level, cracked half-panes where you've been tramping.  A bitty crescent told off by a length of slit hose, where the leaves molder, and what you leave molders.  A sparkplug.  Tell me, said Zorba, do he & he make you feel for your temperature?   Do he & he have a muscle big in the arm from the aiming?  Do he & he pay for it when you dine at the surgeon's?  And I say.  Every time.  Here is my wallet, my truncated prescription. Purse your lips.  A regatta of providers ensues.

      My subtle line wish-washed by Zorba's C-serum, I include the request for additional funding, equipment, such as the cannon shaped  as a cuticle.  The spectre mask on page eleven.  The turpentine brassiere.   When in girlhood I encountered the gilt edge of your plethora, Zorba put her hand to mast.  Half-mast.  She twisted the miniature dial and the tube rose, rose to meet my clapboard. Matched.  At the end of the bath, read the bath leaves, the ring and the hollow skins of the bath beads.  Even in the dank, we rinse the strawberry from our turbans, we frame the jaw with petrol.    Curl it, Zorba.  The tin tub waits, the lady, the tramp.
