      Thursday through today, East Lansing had a sidewalk sale.  All the businesses along Grand River Ave. brought out a few carts and tables, cleared their back rooms and tried to sell their garage sale quality junk at discount prices.    It's time for me to get rid of my back room junk as well.  1. My job does not excite me. 2. I want a new ride. 3. I am hooked on techno.  My boss will be retiring next year, his boss retiring in 2-3, and I am a strong candidate to move up both times.  Unless I am given better autonomy, the positions don't look all that interesting.  Hence, I am looking for a better position.  So far, I am applying to places near Milwaukee, Boston and Chicago.  D.C. may be added.  What I want is some place that I can wake up in the morning and  want  to go to work.  I am not leaving until I find that.  Also on the sidewalk sale is my car, the Buick Grandmamobile.  This has got to go to make room for my new  urlLink Chevy Colorado .  Give me a few more weeks, and I will know exactly what I am getting, but I think it will be a crew cab 2WD truck in their bright metallic copper color they call Sunburst Orange.  This is one step, the next being to get my motorcycle cert and find me a  urlLink nice bike .  Memorial Day Weekend, Detroit's Hart Plaza.   urlLink The world's largest free electronic music festival.   I was there.  I caught several acts, including Kevin Saunderson.  Leading up to that and ever since then, I have been listening to more Detroit techno music, trying to find it online, on iTunes, at Barnes and Noble, even on the streets of East Lansing.    The former  urlLink Blue Note Cafe  was great for this (that's me there, before I moved to E.L.).  Julie and... uh, what's-his-name, mixed music there on a pair of turntables just for fun.  I'm even listening to some  urlLink techno  now.  How's this fit into the sidewalk sale?  I need to clear out my current music and find more of this.  Just like caffeine, I am now addicted.  Come get my cast-offs.  A halfway satisfying job with eventual upward mobility.  A Buick Grandmamobile.  Music of another life.  I am moving on.  Back inside, I am clearing room for an exciting job with real rewards, personally and socially.  I am looking for more vibrant cities.  I am getting a new ride.  I am changing to a charging soundtrack to my life.

      I got back from ERC this evening and came up to my front entrance, suddenly struck by the strong aroma of Kung Pao.  A word about where I live, I go through the front door into a lobby area with all the mail boxes for my building, a couple of windows and the elevator and stairs.  It's reasonably elegant, if Spartan in decor.  The wall is flat beige, large slate tile, and absolutely no adornments.  Not even a ficus.  Appearances mismatch, that's how it's been for me the last couple of days.  Kung Pao meets empty lobby.  This morning I awoke to my newly rearranged (three days ago) bedroom.  With the start of summer, there is sun outside at too-early-o'clock.  After already having hit the snooze bar, I awoke not feeling the best, a slight bit disoriented, hearing the guy on NPR say "it's 20 before the hour."  It takes me 16-18 minutes to drive to work and I needed to be at work by 8.  I got on some clothes, deodorized, grabbed my stuff and was out the door in five minutes.  I was outside, going up to my car before I realized it was 6:45.  I returned Missy's call yesterday.  She had called Sunday while I was at my parents' celebrating Father's Day.  All Monday I kept thinking of her.  As I told Karin Monday, if she and I were geographically closer, I would date her in a second.  I haven't really thought of her as someone I should date either because she or I have been in another relationship almost the entire time we've known each other.  Don't get me wrong, her current boyfriend is a nice enough guy.  It's just ever since she said "he's not the right guy, he's just the right guy  for now, " I've had a certain distaste for him.  Missy's also such a sweet person.  She's even got a voice that sounds pleasantly surprised whenever I hear it.  Anyhow, she's fitting into her new life in the city finally and he still is a part of it.    Getting back to the phone call, she left me a phone message.  After that, I couldn't go an hour without thinking back to it.  Then, after talking to her, she mentioned how she was fitting in with her peers, even going to company functions at both her job and his.  Those last two words brought me back down.  Kung Pao hits the lobby.  After returning, I knocked on Blake's door to see if he wanted to go out for a beer.  He and his better half were both watching Moulin Rouge while waiting for Sex and the City to come on.  He invited me in, so I decided to crash there for a few minutes, catch up a bit.  He offered me a beer, since that's what I was coming over for, so I took him up on it.  Unfortunately, they weren't drinking.  That makes me feel uncomfortable, drinking alone.  I drank the beer, caught up with them, saw his new favorite program, then said good night and made plans to go get that beer over the weekend.  Still, between him watching Sex and the City and my drinking without him having one too, it was that strange clash again.  I'm hoping for better results tomorrow.  At least I now have a small round table in my office.  My boss says it looks like a coffee shop sitting next to my mini fridge and coffee machine, but I like it.  Maybe I'll have Chinese tomorrow.

      I need a spot to spout off on things.  This is it.  1. The girls around here have been getting short skirts that are about 2/3 ruffles.  The skirts look stupid. 2. I am addicted to coffee. 3. Damn, I need a girlfriend.  If nothing else, to make the gay guys back off. 4. I need a project at home.  First item.  The night out skirt for the college sorority girls is now something that approximates a bedskirt.  It looks stupid and, although I do appreciate the short length, does not flatter the wearer much.  Sorry, sorority girls, it just ain't right.  My carpet is drying.  I ran the carpet cleaner over most of it yesterday and the rest of it today.  None of my furniture is where it belongs and all I could think of while I was doing the job both today and yesterday was coffee.  Specifically, a double capp while mostly reading my book out on the sidewalk in front of Espresso Royale Cafe.  ERC is downtown and there are lots of people to look at from there while I get my fix.  Very nice setting, but not what I need when I have work to do at home and the weather is something of a phenomenon of 103% humidity yet no rain.  Today I did get my fix, though.  While I was at ERC, I ran across Miranda.  She was someone I almost dated between my freshman and sophomore years of college.  She was going to be a senior in high school, a fact that helped me realize, no, don't go there.  One of my classmates, Jake, did.  They were a couple starting shortly after my brief time with her at least through a few months ago.  He wasn't there tonight, though.  Anyhow, I thought about her after seeing her there and thinking both I need a date and don't go there.  If I did, it would at least get Al's gay friends to believe I am straight.  More on that later.  I helped Al move into his new house this past weekend.  He's someone I met at ERC a couple years ago.  He got a nice place, needs a bit of work but not much.  The problem is, he's not the one to do it.  He has no mechanical aptitude (no, the socket wrench works the other way) and is moving in piecemeal from about 2 miles away.  He's moving almost no furniture, but I doubt he'll have moved everything before 2013.  Nonetheless, I am a bit jealous of his house.  I could use the project and I can see how to do it.  The house is in good shape, but needs a new kitchen, fix a few squeaks in the hardwood floor, some new light fixtures and it's good to go.  After helping Al move Saturday afternoon, his friends came by.  Al is a low key kind of guy, but his friends are not so much, and all of them there that afternoon are gay.  The first to come by (I forgot his name) came to pick up the bed frame Al bought at World Market in his truck.  His truck is a Ford F150 with a construction company logo on the door, his "Barbie" truck.  On the way there, he yelled out "breeders" at a mixed group on the front porch (this one I got, there was an obvious couple there, straight).  Anyhow, the three of us went to World Marked.  Now, I like red wine.  They have a nice selection.  I bought a couple of bottles they had on clearance.  The wine guy claims some accountant with no knowledge of wine decided to put them on clearance.  Al's friend also bought a bottle of wine.  We get back.  Two more of Al's friends arrive in their purple Sebring convertible.  Al's friend opens the bottle of wine he bought and pours it, so I figure I'll make mine available, too.  To cut to the chase, I spent Saturday evening drinking several glasses of red wine and a toast of champagne with four gay guys.  They said I have a bit of a refined quality about me, that I need a new haircut, and as the evening at Al's was winding down, I was invited to join them at Spiral.  I turned them down, reminding them I am straight.  Again.  Al's pickup truck driving friend gave me a ride home (all 8 blocks of it) while I sobered up to drive my car back.  It's sort of a Queer Eye for the Straight Guy experience.  I could go on, talk about work, but this is long enough for a first post.  My carpet is still drying, but close enough to get the crap off my bed so I can sleep tonight.

      One more thing - advertising sucks.  I went to a board I recently rediscovered, and the tagboard had an advertisement taking up the whole thing.  Ads fucking suck.  Pardon my (slightly intoxicated) french (intentionally not capitalized).

      Happy Birthday Grandma!   Happy Birthday Al!   I went to dinner with my parents and grandma at Applebee's.&nbsp; I wish Grandma had liked her salmon better.&nbsp; At least the  urlLink chocolates  I brought from Chicago went over well.&nbsp;   I just got back from Al's place.&nbsp; I had a few drinks there.&nbsp; His place was rather sedate as parties go.&nbsp; I had more to drink than anyone, and that consisted of a white Russian on the weak side, a drink of Al's using his new Carribbean flavored rum, a shot of Level vodka (not worth it, tastes just like the Absolut it is from), and a couple of glasses&nbsp;of merlot wine.&nbsp; This over a 3-hour period works out to less than 2 drinks per hour, but given my dinner was at 5 o'clock (grandma schedule), it hit me fairly quickly.&nbsp; I shouldn't have come home quite so early, but I'm here now.   I could've gone to  urlLink Spiral  with Al, but I'm just not up for that.&nbsp; I know, it has a mixed crowd, but still&nbsp;I'm not interested in a gay bar this evening.   Chicago was awesome, but I'll relate that some time I'm more sober.

      As Frank said, this is my kind of town.  I just got some  urlLink Vosges chocolates .  I highly recommend them.  I've only had a couple of the collection, but the Naga in particular is great.  It is a truffle with coconut extract, milk chocolate and curry powder.  Surprisingly delicious.  The Cubbies won yesterday.  I got to see Greg Maddux pitch a complete game shutout and a few home runs, starting with Sammy Sosa in the first inning.  Jim and Jim from Indianapolis sat next to me.  Jim is living in town for a few months and Jim is visiting.  Jim even got me a seventh inning beer as a gesture of welcome to Chicago from someone living here.  They left immediately after the game to reach their bus, but it was fun to watch the game with them.  I certainly enjoyed the game, and would do it again.  I went to a store called Backwinkel's food market for a bite to eat.  I bought a few items, then sat down to eat.  I nearly choked on my chili when I glanced down at my receipt and saw the name of the cashier; her name is Lakyowanna H.  Seriously.  I almost went back up to ask what the H. stood for.  I'll be off to catch Missy's performance tonight.  I haven't seen Missy in over a year and I haven't seen her perform in over 3.  John and I will be going there tonight.  This hotel is awesome.  Plush robe, chic bathroom, stereo system in the room (currently playing Venice Underground) and a chair in faux snakeskin.  As John said, "there's so much sex in this building."  Maybe that's just the mirrors and chrome he's talking about.  Anyhow, a few more things yet to do today, then off to the performance.

      I am so looking forward to leaving tomorrow.  Many firsts coming up.  1. First time on AmTrak. 2. First time to Wrigley Field. 3. First time in the Hard Rock Hotel. 4. First time in 2 years on vacation for no reason but me.  I am looking forward to taking the train.  I took the train in London to Stratford several years ago and it was a relaxing way to travel.  I hope that I can enjoy this one as well, especially because I get on the train before 8 am tomorrow.  I'm so wired right now, I may need to sleep.  Perhaps that's the quadruple shot latte talking, though.  I want to go to see a  urlLink Cubs  game while I am there.  I figure it'll be a fun way to spend the afternoon, as long as I find a scalper there for a good ticket.  I've only been to three MLB stadiums, and two of them are for the Detroit Tigers (Tigers Stadium and Comerica Park).  The third was on my vacation two years ago to Houston, but more on that later.  "Welcome to the  urlLink Hard Rock Hotel .  How can I rock your world?"  I'm looking forward to staying in a 4-star high rise hotel in the Mag Mile area that doesn't take itself too seriously.  I'm just grinning thinking about it.  The last vacation I took, aside from New Years' in Boston (sorry Jason, I am talking a vacation without pretext), was two years ago.  I went to Houston with Roger.  That was seriously fun, with everything from visiting the dog race track, to a game at Minute Maid Park (the Juice Box), good food and great weather.  I need to get out again.  I may try  urlLink Martyrs'  some time, this theater group in town that does 30 plays in 60 minutes, Papas, or who knows what else, but I am just geeked to be going there tomorrow.  John, Missy, Tiff, Kevin, I'm coming into town.

      I called John today.  He'll make himself available for a visit while I am in Chicago.  He wants to know what happened to Missy, so I'll let him know after I talk to her.  Her boyfriend seems to have pissed him off the last time he called her place, so I guess he doesn't want to risk talking with him again.  Oh well.  I just hope I can catch up with her when I go into town, whenever that ends up being.  I gotta go to my parents' place soon to visit my uncle and his girlfriend.  They may actually get married, so I would like to meet her.  This out of a guy who has spent a solid sixty-some years a bachelor.  She seems to be good for him, so I am looking forward to it.  Still, I've had enough family time lately.  I need to get out.  Hence, the Chicago trip.  Restlessness is settling in for a long stay with me.

      It was a short week following the 4th holiday on Monday (the 5th).  In spite of the short work week, I couldn't make it.  I took the afternoon off.  Last week was also a short week.  They made the 2nd one of the two floating holidays at work.  That one, however, was very good.  I slept in, got out just before noon for a run for about an hour, called Karin and went to Harper's for a beer around 1:30, then met up with Al and a couple of his friends for Spider-Man 2 at 4:20 (he-heh, 4:20).  I followed this up with going back to do packing and some critical laundry for packing for the  weekend in Indianapolis.  Last Friday was fun and productive.  This afternoon, I wasted away nearly all of the two hours I took off by sitting inside my house putzing on my computer.  This wasn't the idea on a gorgeous Friday.  I did finally get out, first to quickly run into the bank and then to run.  I got my usual bank teller, the enthusiastic redhead.  She had on her Hank cd in the back and was nodding along with the music as she processed my rebate check.  I'm glad I got her, partially because I didn't bring my wallet and the other teller there always asks for my ID.  Also because she's a cute flirt, even though she's married.  Aside from my hour long run and my trip to the bank, I haven't done much with my afternoon.  Karin had to clean the bathroom before her guests arrived, so no beer with her.  I was lazy, so I didn't get to any of the major 8-5 stores.  I don't even have my new car yet.  My request for a program car is in limbo.  Even GM is lazy.  They are on their summer 2 week shut-down, meaning I won't know until the week of the 19th at the earliest.  Damn them and their desirable new truck.  Next weekend, I may go down to Chicago.  I just decided this.  I'll call Missy and John and whoever else may be there.  Jason's engaged.  Congratulations.  For future reference, don't send a mass e-mail for that type of thing.  And don't wait ten days to send it.  Nonetheless, I drank two toasts to you and Gina on Wednesday over half priced beers with Karin.  Good luck with the move this weekend, too.  Al's in Puerto Rico, living it up and getting away from the new house worries.  Have fun Al.  To recap, Karin is having company tonight, Jason is moving and trying to let people know his big news, Al is in Puerto Rico and I am sitting here, unable to put forth a full four day work week or do anything with my afternoon off.  Next week is definitely Chicago.
