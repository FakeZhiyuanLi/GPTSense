      So here I am in the blog-o-sphere, or, blog-i-verse, or whatever for the second time. My umich site was getting too complicated. I'm using all these different computers and to update the site I would need ftp software, well, sftp software, which is even harder to come by, and it was just messy. So here I am with a new blog that I think I will update more often because I can from, you know, anywhere. We'll see. I've already been de-linked from Nemo's blog once, so it will probably take a while for him to give me another chance. Here I go...  I want to dedicate this first entry to an SUV I saw a couple days back that really made me want to blog again. There are some things I see that I just want to like, share, you know? Not having a blog really stifled this urge because I don't have any real non-cyber friends anymore and so no one to share with.   I was pulling off the highway and stopped in front of me was some tan Dodge-looking tank with a license plate that read, get this, "The Stud." Well, no period and no space, and all caps, so I guess like, "THESTUD". At first I was like ha ha, that's great and Angeline, who was there, was also like, ha ha ha, or rather he he he, that's great. (She kinda giggles.) But then I noticed something that changed it from "great" to "awesome" which like many of you know, means "totally sweet." Affixed to the upper left corner of this plate was a handicapped sticker! Now, I have nothing against handicapped people, but isn't it amusing to see one who broadcasts their status on the car AND ALSO has the license plate "THESTUD"? No? Well, I thought it was funny.   That's all.

      Have you seen that cell phone commercial where the guy is the first of his friends to get a job?  His friends keep calling his cell phone with all sorts of funny pranks, including, at the end, using a megaphone to order toilet paper while he's on the elevator?  I feel like that sometimes.  Not because I have a job.  But because I think he is tacitly at fault for all of the embarassing situations in which he finds himself, despite his attempts to be a responsible adult.  I certainly felt like that in West Virginia.    I'm not going to re-cap what  urlLink Nemo  has already covered and I'm sure  urlLink Jeff  will publish an exhaustive account of the trip soon, so I just want to get a few shots in.    One thing you won't get from the two of them is a firsthand account of what it was like to be in the "strong" boat.  The guide told us at the beginning of the rafting trip on Sunday that we should divide up the power.  Of course, with our knowledge of the free-riding problem, and our general selfishness, none of the five strongest guys wanted to join the three girls, Jeff, and Nemo.  Well, maybe Ming wasn't one of the strongest guys, and maybe he is weaker than most girls, but the story is better when it's the top five.  As a result, we were easily the most agile boat on the river while our other boat was outpaced by a troop of girlscouts rafting on their cookie sale proceeds.  It turns out our power was exceptionally useful.  On a "ladder" rapid, where there was a class 3, 4, and 5 in quick succession, a passenger of another boat fell out.  One portion of the class five rapid was known as the "meat grinder" in which the other boat's crude guide Warren estimated a 70% chance of not coming out if one went in there sans raft.  Our guide, the notorious Steve from  urlLink Pete Nemo's  trip a year ago, low-talked us in to action; we paddled as hard as we could toward him.  Steve handled the rope throwing and the rescuing; we got him, and our newest freshly saved, chaw chewing passenger, out of trouble.  The video of the rafting trip shows an awesome shot of Steve pulling this Southern Ohioan out of the water while we expertly navigated one of the most dangerous portions of the river.    Steve has an interesting history.  He was featured on Pete's blog as the guide who (a) had probably done a lot of drugs in his life, some as recently as the previous night, and (b) was a Low Talker.  He was both of these things in our boat as well.  I was sitting right in front of him, so I felt it incumbent on me to repeat - loudly - everything Steve said.  He didn't seem to mind.  In fact, he didn't really seem to care about anything; death included.  On our trip, he was also the first and only person to fall out of the raft unintentionally.  It's very disconcerting to get out of a rapid, thrilled that no one fell out and everyone is alive, and to look back and realize you're short one guide.  Luckily, Steve made it out fine and we all made it down the river.  There were many other funny and interesting things that happened on our trip.  Most of them will be recounted elsewhere, I'll try to fill in the gaps throughout the next week.  The last thing I'll mention now, which is some sort of sick vindication, occurred after returning to Ann Arbor.  I checked my email for the first time in days and found, in my law firm account, a request to have a project done by Tuesday morning.  It was 10:30 on Monday night and I was exhausted.  When I got to work in the morning, two additional people asked about three additional projects I was working on.  Amazingly, I was very productive and not tired through the entire day, and got enough of it done that I was able to not cancel a trip to the Detroit Shock game that night.  They lost by one on a three-pointer with .6 seconds left.  The crowd, replete with some very butch looking women, could not have cared less.    Tampax sponsored the defensive player of the game; beers were still $7.

      Bill Clinton's new book,  My Life  has been derided as containing mostly commentary on himself, rather than commentary on his policies as president.  The  Wall Street Journal , for example, ran an editorial claiming this was because he didn't do anything as president.  After 1992 he was stymied by a Republican controlled Congress.  The  Journal  editorial credited this inaction as cause for the economic boom in the late 1990s.  Apparently it was the era of the least new government intervention in business affairs since the 1920s.    A post from yesterday on Volokh.com contends that good governence is un-historically-remarkable governance.  A reader submitted this quote,   "[Titus Antoninus Pius's] reign is marked by the rare advantage of furnishing very few materials for history; which is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind." — Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol I., ch. 3, pt. 2  I think the second half of the quote sums up Clinton's legacy quite nicely.  Perhaps the amount of time his book dedicates to policy reflects the truth of the first half as well.   ******************************************  In hopes of pandering to the portion of my audience that can't really stand my soap box blathering I want to tell a story of Nemo's and my trip to Westland yesterday.  We embarked to retrieve a couch and a loveseat Nemo and Carrie had purchased several days before from the Valu City furniture warehouse/store.  Firstly, I borrowed by brother's truck, which is a Ford Ranger.  I recommend you never buy a Ford Ranger.  Carrie remarked when I arrived at their condo that the bed was "really little."  I mean, what is the point of a truck if not to haul stuff?  Looking at it, the bed was really for show.  And it wasn't much of one.  Nemo measured it and the couch was going to stick out the back approximately 14 inches.  Ignoring this warning, Nemo and I began the drive to Westland.  Nemo took the civic so we would have someplace to store the couch cushions, since the truck bed wouldn't do.  When we arrived in Westland, Nemo quickly locked his keys in his car, while it was running.  I think Nemo and Chuck (who had to drive the spare set out) were much more incensed by this loss than was I, who used the opportunity to buy and eat an awesome sandwich.    We loaded the couches into the truck without incident and gave them a great tie-down.  However, I then realized the true shortcomings of this particular truck.  Unfortunately, it is missing both side mirrors.  Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but we had just loaded a couch and a loveseat into the back, which entirely blocked out any line of sight from the rear view mirror.  In order to merge, etc., I had to lean out the window.  It was awful.    Because of the delay, we went directly from Westland, to my optometrist, where I had an appointment.  Nemo sat in the civic and did three things: (1) guarded the couches from injury, (2) played games on his cell phone, and (3) realized we had left the tarp in Westland.  I walked out, about 45 minutes later, wearing those stupid sunglasses they give you.  When we got back to his house with the couches, we were quickly met by erstwhile Crusader/River Rat Kevin Ryder.  I was still wearing the sunglasses.    We moved the couches in without further incident.  They are big and poofy, but comfortable.  We then moved the old couch to the city "Recycling Center" where we were asked by the "guard" why we would ever want to throw away the "lovely green couch."  Or maybe he called it beautiful.  Whatever.  Try sitting on it, guy.  We threw it away despite his commentary.  So ends the couch saga.

      I just finished reading Tom Wolfe's  Bonfire of the Vanities .  Granted, I'm about 20 years behind everybody else who read it, but I give it my highest recommendation, especially considering Eliot Spitzer's assault on just about anything/one famous and rich.    The book is remarkably salient given current world events.  The premise is that a successful investment banker gets lost in the Bronx back in the '80s, when it's still really bad.  He gets out of the car to remove a tire blocking the entrance to the highway and is hailed down by two black guys.  Thinking they were trying to rob him (it is later revealed that they were) he throws the tire at one, jumps back in the car, and speeds off - but in the process, hits one.  The kid is injured and goes the hospital where he falls into a coma.  The DA, the press, and a 'civic' organization leader jump on this guy because he is rich, white, and from Park Avenue.  Truth is put aside and only politics drives the prosecution.  If you ever thought that maybe politicos, 'news' media, etc. were providing only self serving information, my blog cannot find words to describe the depth to which this book drives that point home.  It's interesting, also, to read some of his shorter, nonfiction pieces, especially the first piece in  The Purple Decades .  The novel seems a lot more credible, after reading that.  Although, since the novel itself is tactfully self-aware, you also wonder if perhaps Wolfe himself is admitting self-serving sensationalism.  Back to the Spitzer point - Here's the concern I have.  I've been doing research for a project I'm working on at the law firm about tort reform law.  Many states have taken the tack of damages capping, or requiring judges to lower jury awards to a specific maximum amount, in medical malpractice cases.  The reason is that jury awards are getting out of control, doctors' insurance rates are soaring, and the cost of healthcare is astronomical.  The short reason for this is that juries are involved in wealth redistribution - they see someone poor and injured and they bestow on them tremendous wealth.  That's not what I'm concerned with.  There are arguable reasons for juries to do such, and some states have started large funds to provide for these poor and injured when the injurer can't pay.  To a some extent, I support the redistributive characteristics of juries.    What I do not support is what's really driving the increase in awarded dollars.  In  Bonfire , the only people that come out ahead are the corrupt civic organization leader, Reverand Bacon (who gains political influence and a lot of money), the DA (who is reelected), and the about to be fired reporter who breaks the story (he wins a Pulitzer).  Their mission is anything but the protection of the weak, it's entirely self-serving.  Same with many plaintiffs' lawyers.  Much of the problem is that, while in some cases, people who are truly injured by another and deserve to be compensated are compensated, in many, after expenses and fees are subtracted, the only one who wins is the attorney.  The problem is not in the damages juries are awarding, it's in the lawyers compensation.  Until plaintiffs' attorneys move away from percentage based contingency fee arrangements, the problem will remain.  The case of plaintiffs' attorneys is a good example of what else is going on.  Take Spitzer or the US's  urlLink (recently removed) plea  for immunity for its soldiers.  Spitzer's running for Senate.  The US is concerned the trial of its soldiers will turn into a political, rather than a legal, debate.  It is easy to resent a giant.  What isn't so easy is to understand the motivations of the giant killers, and if what they're doing is fair or just.  To reiterate, Bonfire of the Vanities is a great book.  It's James Patterson meets Bob Woodward.*  Exciting, but deeply convicting and exposing.

      One more thing.  My girlfriend, Angeline, has been clamoring for some press on this site.  The only thing, though, is that she's in Houston right now for Teach for American summer institute.  So we don't really do anything together besides talk on the phone.  And those conversations are private, dammit.  But seriously, you should give a  urlLink shout out  to her, you know, tell her that she's doing something "good" for the "underprivileged" and that you're sure it will help "change the world."  In fact, you should say that regardless of your opinion of its veracity.  Wait, check that, what you  should  do is tell her that she's doing no good, that she'll have an awful time, and that she should move back to Ann Arbor asap.   That  I would appreciate.  And tell her that you miss her, too.

      No one was actually killed, nor did lightning strike the  actual  golf course.  But Nemo and I did play golf in a thunderstorm.    I shot a 44 - on 8 holes.  A pretty good round for me, especially considering I had not swung a club since June '03.  My tee shots and approaches were all fantastic, but I 3- and 4-putted A LOT.  I was playing so well that I almost beat Nemo in a skins match, losing only because his 15 foot putt on the seventh hung on the rim for about 5 seconds, and than finally dropped in, sealing his victory.  On 6, it rained for about 10 minutes, which was very refreshing, but really deadened the ball.  It's amazing how much a ball will stick on the green right after it rains.    The aforementioned thunderstorm really hit while we were rushing through the 9th hole.  On shot 2, we saw a lightning bolt reach from the sky to the ground about 2 miles away.  That was enough to call the hole and make it back to the car just as it started to pour.  Oh well.  Earlier that day, I rode a bike home from work (it's almost 10 miles).  If you ever decide to do this, my only advice to you is that you make sure the tires have a good amount of air.  Mine were completely flat.  My only other advice is that if the first person you tell suggests that you should have stopped at a gas station to fill the tires up, you punch 'em.  Maybe then you won't have to be told four times until you finally begin the story, "So I know I should have stopped and filled the tires at a gas station, but..."    During the first part of my ride, I went over a bridge that spans the Huron River.  For those of you who are from or have been to Ann Arbor, you know that this is hardly a dangerous river, unless you are measuring its fecal content for Phy Sci.  But the chances of somebody drowning are very low.  So I'm riding over the bridge, and this overweight guy runs past me going the other way and says, "Do you have a phone?  Call 911!"  I look in the river and see a young girl casually floating along, in a life preserver, with three canoes casually paddling up to her to pull her into the boat.  Her canoe  was  swamped about 20 yards downstream, but no one seemed concerned.  But this guy was running down to the bank of the river like he was about to strip off his shorts and perform a Baywatch style rescue mission.  He had both a camera and a goatee - I think he was probably a pervert.  He just wanted the justification to perform mouth to mouth on a twelve year old.  Maybe that's just me.  Jeff got a speeding ticket, too this week.  It's an epidemic.  Check out his site.

      Firstly, Go Pistons.  And shout/apology out to Kai, who never lost faith in Rip & Co.  As many of you know, I picked the Lakers to win in 5.  Well, now it looks more like the other way around.  And remember, it should be 3-0 right now.  I'm not talking about 'i can't believe kobe made that shot' or 'we should have fouled shaq when he had the ball' I'm talking about that nancy 'Sheed.  Here's two options: (a) foul shaq.  I mean, really foul him.  So that it hurts.   Then  maybe he doesn't make the shot.  (b) don't foul him at all, allow the bucket, 'Stons are still up by 4.  Instead, 'Sheed gives him a little chest bump like he was playing girls' lacrosse.  You know, like 'watch out for my Audi TTs.’ I’m a big man, but I'm sensitive in the breasts.  He probably  helped  the shot go in!  Inexplicably, shaq makes a three-point play to set up Kobe's shot and all the fuss about intentional fouls.  Whatever.  2-1 in grandiose fashion.  Secondly, after leaving the game, I drive through north campus en route to Amber's house (leaves today for michigania) to drop off some stuff.  Now there's construction on one of the roads and they've closed it going southbound for about 1/8 of a mile.  I'm going southbound.  It's late, I'm at the top of a hill and can see the entire site, there's no one for miles, etc., etc.  Further, there's a bus pull-in on the side of the road so I can move over if things really get hairy.  So I slowly, cautiously, begin to navigate said thoroughfare.  Halfway down, a K-9 SUV barrels down after me, lights flashing, and all hell breaks loose.  The  campus safety officer  writes me not one, but two tickets (the second because my father, whose car I was driving, did not put proof of insurance in the glove compartment.  Certainly did not add to my cred that I was sorting through 4 registration docs, 1 of which was current, and 3 proof of insurance docs, 0 of which were current.)  Of course, when he returned ticket in tow, I asked him questions concerning the amount of the fine, etc.  He had no idea.  Completely ign'nt of the devastation he had unleashed.  Perhaps I should have mentioned before, this knucklehead sounded remarkably similar to the brother on 'Everybody loves Raymond.'  No joke.  I believe this man had a 'learning disability.'  Anyway, after the issue is foreclosed, I decide to argue with him.  The following from the conversation that ensued:  Me (perhaps not as politely as would be hoped): I believe that laws have a purpose, that they are supposed to provide safety and orderliness.  Officer (much less politely than I had hoped, in fact, angrily):  Well that's what you get for your belief!  That ticket!  While we had been sitting there, for approximately 20 minutes, about 4 cars had passed.  One of which was another cop.  If you remember my  urlLink previous blog  about the guy who called me up, demanding that the mayor fire cops?  I wish I would have saved his number; I'd be the first name on his petition.

      The Wall Street Journal ran a story yesterday on the Gipper and the subsequent decline of American political cooperation.  I took out of it two things: (1) There was a time in American politics when people fought all day until 6 pm and then went out together as friends.  (2)  That time was recent.    During my first year at law school I noticed how difficult it is to avoid disliking the person you disagree with.  Many people have very strongly held views and when they speak those views emotion and often some 'irrationality' seeps out.  After that happens, it is difficult to resist the animus that can come from emotional involvement.  The feeling of me/us vs. him/them is much easier.    The ability to set that aside and respect a man while disagreeing with him takes concerted effort.  The decline of that respect, today, I believe reflects an endemic loss in our society today.  I recently saw  urlLink  Supersize Me.   Many, if not most, Americans eat copious amounts of cheap, easy (and exceedingly unhealthy) fast food and soda.  Watch CNN or Fox News.  Many, if not most, Americans obtain their information from cheap, easy (and extremely one sided and sensationalistic) news channels.    Many people share views that are polar opposites of our own - often it does not mean that they are immoral or stupid.  But it takes some doing to respect that.

      I feel completely  urlLink  vindicated   in my continued, um, habit free, um, love of coffee.  You should too.  Also, Go 'Stons!  I must confess, I got in something of a quasi-public spat with Kai Kung via the email before this game.  I was convinced that Dee-troit would lose in 5.  I'm not ruling that out, but they sure looked a whole helluva lot better than I expected.  The Lakers really just refuse to play defense.  I still think Kobe, Shaq, and the gang will get their act together and win the series, but now I'm having my doubts.  If you want actual game analysis, well, go anywhere else.  What else?  Got sun-baked in Carrie and Nemo's pool on Friday, then went to see Harry Potter.  Much different from book 3, but still good.  I hated Y tu mama tambien, but the guy did a great job with this one.  Also, all grades in and I'm slightly mollified, but I've still got it in for Miller, the stupid Bloodfeuds prof.  Everything else went quite, quite well.    Now I'd better get back to work.

      The guy who wanted to do away with law enforcement kept saying, "It's a quality of life issue, man."  Well, buddy, this comic sums up my feelings on your quality of life issue.  (I had a little trouble getting the picture up, so it's above.)

      I volunteer in the mayor of Ann Arbor's office thursday and friday mornings.  Apparently, anyone is allowed to call whenever they want and, since the deputy mayor was gone all day today, I'm the only one screening calls.  That means I get to take calls like the one I got this morning.  Some guy (I didn't ask for a name because that might imply I was going to call him back) calls in wanting to know what the mayor is going to do about the astronomical number of police officers ann arbor has.  And when he's going to get them to stop hiding behind billboards, etc. and giving traffic citations.  You would imagine this is a guy who had just gotten a ticket and was pissed.  No, he had never gotten a ticket.  He was just worried he would "drop a sandwich and when he bent down to pick it up off the floor be pulled over for some da[r]n bull[crap]."    I was pretty bored at the time so, knowing it would do no good, I decided to talk with this guy at length.  He had opened the conversation with, "Ann Arbor gives out so many university degrees and yet the stupidest people live there."  I was talking to one of them.  Not to be dissuaded when I mentioned that studies have shown that crime rate is inversely related to size and visibility of the police force (thanks law review materials), he equated traffic stops to a "mugging," being upset that he could go to jail for taking a candybar from a store but that police officers could hide and pull people over and then give traffic tickets.  In other news, I take back anything good I ever said about Bloodfeuds, my Icelandic literature "law" class last semester.  And anything good I said about the professor.  I also moved over from eBloggy.com to this site, blogspot.com.  Jeff's success greatly exceeded mine in this regard, so I cut my losses.  I was able to change the date of my entries so I cut and pasted all (both) of my former posts from eBloggy.  Of course, you would never need to know I ever used eBloggy, because I really haven't told anyone I'm back up and running yet...so let's just use this as a lesson: don't use eBloggy.com.  It's terrible.

      Many of you may be aware, but last night the Detroit Pistons came from behind to beat the Indiana Pacers and advance to the NBA finals for the first time since 1990. I watched the game from the cozy, quiet Grizzly 'Best Beer in Ann Arbor' Peak. Who knew a restaurant could have a middle name? After standing around Scorekeepers and the Arena for the first half sans table or drinks, Angeline, Courtney, Rene, Christine, and I moved to more pleasant surroundings. It was great. Free tables abounded and the atmosphere was amenable to chatting while watching. I recommend that everyone continues to not go there.   My favorite non-basketball highlight of the game was when I saw some guy in the stands wearing a Rip Hamilton broken-nose protection mask. Or maybe it was when some guy was holding the "It's Time..." sign. Ostensibly, the sign referred to the fact that the 'Stons haven't been to the finals since '90, but the seriousness of his expression suggested he was after something much more. For all I know, he could have been saying, "It's time...to pull out of Iraq." Perhaps not the proper venue, but you never know. Regardless, Go Stons! They'll probably lose in 5 to LA.  In other news, my brother graduates today from Huron HS and I might play golf (for the first time this year...it's freakin June) with Nemo and his coworker tomorrow.  Peace out.

      I'm a Sagittarius - it says so on my profile, so it must be true.&nbsp; Apparently, we are a very optimistic bunch.&nbsp; I'd point you to a link that says this, but the City of A2 is blocking my access to Yahoo! Horoscope.&nbsp; So you can go there on your own.&nbsp; That's if you don't believe me, which you should.&nbsp;   But anyway, the problem with unbridled optimism is that nothing quite lives up to your expectations.&nbsp; For example, it's always very exciting for me to sign up for classes,&nbsp;but they're never as interesting in real life as they look on the web.&nbsp;   I'm going to assume that's the same for law firms, and I imagine they're even better at marketing themselves, but I still read about them and say to myself, 'Wow, that looks like a great place to work.&nbsp; I wish I were doing that right now.&nbsp; Gee wiz.'&nbsp;   For those of you readers unfamiliar with the practice of law, or unfamiliar with the size and geographic location of firms that I'm researching and how that size and geographic location affects said practice, let me explain why it's so strange that I get excited.&nbsp; As a first year New York associate in X brand name firm, this is essentially the typical day (from what I understand):    7:30-8:00  - wake up, maybe exercise, otherwise snooze for 15-25 minutes   8:00-8:15  - shower, dress (maybe eat bagel, but maybe they have these at office)   8:15-8:35  - go to subway, stand in crowded car which may or may not have a free handhold.&nbsp; Perhaps read WSJ if space permits.&nbsp; Arrive at very crowded stop, stampede to really tall, shiny office building.   8:35-8:40 &nbsp;- ride elevator up really tall, shiny&nbsp;building to a floor that may or may not have bagels/muffins and coffee for you (perk) and where your shared&nbsp;office probably but not always has a window (perk)   8:40-8:45  - examine your coworkers clothes as you walk in and remember that, since this is new york, and you work for a law firm, everyone spends way to much on these clothes and always feels like they're inadequately dressed&nbsp; (btw - whatever happened to the codpiece?&nbsp; I would have expected NYC types to have brought this one back by now...Any takers?)   8:45-9:15  - email, phone messages, etc.&nbsp; hope there isn't anything too pressing.&nbsp; Maybe some internet news.   9:15-12:00  - start reading very long and incredibly boring document(s), maybe write something.   12:00-12:30  - go to cafeteria lunch, maybe take back to desk.&nbsp;   12:30-7:00  - continue reading very long and incredibly boring documents(s), maybe write something, like notes (most junior associates do not speak to clients, co- or opposing counsel, or really anyone, except for senior associates)   7:00-7:15  - partner gets off phone, explains&nbsp;to senior associate (maybe yells/screams, depending on firm/practice area)&nbsp;that he needs senior associate to write something.&nbsp;   7:15  - partner goes home   7:30  - senior associate explains to you (maybe yells/screams, depending on firm/practice area) that he needs you to write something   9:00  - dinner is ordered by firm (perk)   10:00  - senior associate goes home   11:00, 12:00, or 1:00 (varies) &nbsp;- something is finally written, and by written, I mean cut and pasted from one (or more) long boring document(s) into a shorter, more boring document   10&nbsp;minutes later  - in cab home, realize that a paralegal, secretary, or even high school dropout could probably have spent the same day with the same result. &nbsp;only one thing - they would refuse; also realize that the other "perks", subsidized gym membership, etc. are never used, and (as has been suggested by some) the desk probably wouldn't be too bad to sleep under, there is a gym with a shower across the street, and the "great" 300ft2 apt you're paying $2000 a month for you haven't seen in daylight for several months   10 more minutes later  - peel off clothes, fall into bed.&nbsp; probably can't sleep because the shorter, but more boring document you drafted will probably be used to club baby seals or deprive starving children of food/medicine so that tobacco companies and GWB can make more money, or at least, that's what they're saying on CNN, in the NYTimes, and most other media except for FOX News, where they're saying that the seals aren't really "babies" and that it is in fact those seals that are depriving starving children of food/medicine and regardless it's the children's and seals' fault anyway.&nbsp; oh, and it's really quite good for the average american that tobacco companies are making money because it will all trickle down eventually.&nbsp; Depending on time of year, prez hopeful might say something about values.&nbsp;   Repeat, at least M-Sat, and sometimes Sun for 3-5 years.&nbsp; Day is longer if one wants to stay longer, make partner, etc.   The point of this all is, with this gorilla lurking in the corner, how could I possibly get excited about firms?&nbsp; One firm, for example, is rumored to have "the world's best cookies", they also provide attorneys with Starbucks(tm) coffee and Poland(tm) spring water.&nbsp; Do these amenities explain my otherwise irrational exuberance?&nbsp; Or is it some sort of mental defect...   Damn the stupid Zodiac.   Oh, and I didn't make Law Review.&nbsp;&nbsp;And my computer broke down and Dell says the part will cost 409.95 but, not to worry, the technical support hotline would walk me through the entire installation process.

      The NYTimes this morning  urlLink presented  an astonishing breakthrough: Binge drinking is causing raucous behavior in Britain.&nbsp; It seems that  38 percent  of Brit males binge drink weekly.&nbsp; The only place higher is Ireland, where 48 percent binge weekly.&nbsp; Those numbers seem awfully high.&nbsp; Two of every five and one in two?&nbsp; One commentator writes, "It seems that the acme of modern British experience is oblivion preceded by nastiness."&nbsp; Indeed.

      I read a great  urlLink column  this morning by William Safire in the NYTimes.&nbsp; He talks about the "5 factions" in a republican brain.&nbsp; Economic, social (or  soooo -cial), libertarian, neocon, and cultural.&nbsp; While the column generally is superb, one thing stuck in my head that I hadn't really thought of before.&nbsp; How much I identify with  cultural  conservatism.&nbsp; Safire says:   I identify with art forms more traditional than avant-garde, and language usage more standard than common. I prefer the canon to the fireworks and a speech that appeals to the brain's reasoning facilities to a demidocumentary film arousing the amygdala.   I think I fall in step with this&nbsp;- but I want to extend it to dress, as well.&nbsp; Take, for example, my penchant for my first Brooks Brothers (According to the  urlLink NYC GOP walking tour "Outfitters of Republicans - and union soldiers.") suit.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, my disappointment at a CNBC story I watched last night on the popularity of the "untucked" shirt at the office, sometimes coupled with loose tie.   I don't really know  why  this is.&nbsp; What would normally leap to mind -&nbsp;parents -&nbsp;in my case is not at all a factor.&nbsp; I just like it.&nbsp;   Really, I don't have any conclusion or deeper point to this little anecdote.&nbsp; I just thought the column was interesting and thought I'd share.

      David M. Tarr, esq2b, mentioned once in an email or perhaps on his blog about how very specific the group is that reads/writes these things.&nbsp; Very similar interests, levels of education, employment, etc.&nbsp; I'd like to think I've recently pointed out, on this site, one of the exceptions to this general rule, but that one makes sense, too.&nbsp; I mean, let's say there are "mainstream" bloggers.&nbsp; These were the kids in high school who were nerdy, but still had a modicum of social grace.&nbsp; They probably played sports, etc.&nbsp; Obviously I'd like to think they were me.&nbsp; I mean, we all knew that  some  people were going to use internet postings to rant about the bomb they were building or something like that.&nbsp; There's one guy in particular who joined the army right out of highschool (and always carried a briefcase while  in  high school as if it were his officer's important files)&nbsp;that I'm thinking about here. &nbsp; But what's interesting to me is the sort of people who do not read/write blogs.&nbsp; I am fascinated by blogs of people I know (or that they know), especially if they are clever, witty, and short.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; But I have friends who tell me, as some did just this last weekend, 'Yeah, I went to your blog, and [others'] once.'&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; But you never went back?&nbsp; Who are you?&nbsp; Who is Josh Ruland!?&nbsp; Do I have something on my face!?!? &nbsp; These are people that love the internet, they  often  visit  urlLink Strongbad and friends , they loved  urlLink Real Ultimate Power , but not blogs.&nbsp; It's weird. &nbsp; In other news, I attended a "masquerade party" and "fashion show" at  urlLink Cafe Oz  on Saturday night.&nbsp; And by "masquerade party" I mean otherwise normal people wearing little masks...sometimes.&nbsp; And by "fashion show" I mean, otherwise normal people (maybe) wearing otherwise normal clothes from Ann Arbor stores, walking as they otherwise normally do, down a makeshift runway for a total of about 8 minutes while some guy read (poorly) off a card and a dj played music too loudly.&nbsp; The whole thing was about 5 and 1/2 minutes too long. &nbsp; Besides getting ripped off for a saphire martini and a glenlivet (combined sticker price: $15 plus tip)&nbsp; the night was uneventful.&nbsp; UNTIL Juh-main and I ran into none other than former Crusader and River Rat hottie, Erin Treece.&nbsp; Yes, Erin Treece.&nbsp; Between Juh-main and Erin's woeful remonstrances of former, mutual but unrequited&nbsp;crush-dom, she informed us of what interesting twists her life had taken.&nbsp; She, for example, (a) lived for a summer in Jamaica, (b) was car-jacked twice w/in two months while living on the east side of Detroit, (c) had been, but was no longer, engaged.&nbsp; I was reminded that I live a boring life. &nbsp; Finally, I took down the link from my "Crazy in Ann Arbor" post b/c I don't want to get caught.&nbsp; If you want it again, let me know.

      Richard Posner on why America has a higher proportion of religious persons:  &nbsp;  "As David Hume would have predicted, the greater vitality of American religion than of religion in countries in which there is an established church or churches owes much to our unwillingness to allow government to favor particular sects.&nbsp; By impairing religious competition, such favoritism turns many people - those not comfortable with the creed or clergy or congregants of the favored church - off religion."  &nbsp;  Market dynamics play a role in faith-based initiatives...GWB couldn't have said it better himself.&nbsp; Probably because he is not articulate.&nbsp;

      The Ann Arbor "SNews", (as my 11th grade history teacher, among many, many others called it) reported today that ESPN is traveling to Newaygo, a western Michigan city, along with 10 other sites, to film a child named Espen in honor of the networks 25th anniversary.  This child is one of 11 who has been named  after the network.   One of these children is actually named ESPN - I think the birth certificate is in all caps.  Some disappointed father feminized the name for his daughter, to Espyn.

      To add one further addendum to yesterday's antics, after my hearing I went to the business school to do some work and when I left I found a parking ticket on my car.  So it was pretty much the worst day ever.    Luckily, Nemo and I had great success repairing a reticent toilet.  We employed the somewhat unorthodox give-it-a-good-hard-tug method (some might be familiar with its cousin method, give-it-a-good-kick).  At the end of the night, leaks were clocked at somewhat below 1 drip per 54 seconds.  Stay tuned for further updates.

      Or pulled over and ticketed by a moron.  A smug moron.    Despite hardly being able to string a sentence together, Officer West triumphed over me in our sparring match today.  Here's a consolidated play-by-play:  Judge: Mr. Ruland, it says here you failed to observe a traffic control device?  Officer West will speak first and then you can go.  Officer West (in that same Raymond's brother voice): Um, uh, um [insert wrong usage of some part of English here] and then, uh...[ad nauseum].  Me: [Somewhat, but not so much, articulately giving my statement, available in the comments section].  Judge:  Well, usually, there is inadvertence involved and I reduce for inadvertence.  But since there is no inadvertence I'm not going to reduce this for inadvertence.  Inadvertence inadvertence inadvertence.  Boy, I like saying inadvertence.  Me: Well, I think that my lack of insurance documentation, which we agree was not my fault, may have colored the discretion of the Officer.  Judge:  In that case I will remove the fine for the insurance documentation...except for the $25 mandated by state law.  Me: I was told that was a matter of course.  Judge:  No it is not a matter of course, I mean, it is not required by state law, but we do it here as a policy.  The court has it as a policy.   We  do it as a matter of course.  Me: [20 minutes later in the car] So you're telling me you are not going to do anything for me, but you're going to represent that you are?  Judge: [in my head]  You're right; I'm wrong.  I'm an idiot; you're very smart.  Everybody loves you and thinks you're a real man; I am an balding, overweight, emasculated, pathetic loser who tries to make myself bigger by taking out my frustration on anyone who is the least bit intelligent and articulate because they're probably better than me.  I and the officer will now go and commit seppuku.  The citation is removed.  Needless to say I'm pretty upset about the whole thing.  This is why democracy should be abolished, and members of the party should be above the law.  What made it worse was that Officer West, K-9 patrol, FDPS walked out of there with a smug grin on his face.  Prick.  Oh well, at least I can really get back at him by making fun of him on the internet.

      So Ann Arbor recently fired one of its firefighters.  We were told today that he returned to city hall yesterday and was arrested for various reasons, including resisting arrest (which seems oddly recursive, but oh well).  He is being arraigned today and we were warned that if bail (or bond, despite being in law school I really have no idea how the criminal justice system works) was set low enough, he might be out today.  We were warned that he might try to storm city hall again today and that we could expect no screening to take place by the police providing "security" downstairs.  So if we see him, we are to consider him "armed and dangerous" and immediately call 911.  Luckily, those police  are  right downstairs.  It seems that, despite instilling remarkable fear in me whenever a porn pop-up appears, (and not preventing anyone from entering the building who shouldn't) having those boys in blue two floors below has its uses.  Luckily, I won't be here when he may or may not be released on bail/bond because I will be fighting my own battle with an FDPS (F-ing Department of Public Safety) officer and a traffic magistrate, of which I will provide significant coverage later today.  In other news, I received an email today from "Famous Blue Pill" proclaiming with its subject line that "[My] life just got awesome."  Probably the most convincing argument I have yet heard for Male Sexual Enhancement products.

      From the Charleston, W. Va. Gazette:  June 30, 2004   Va. teen dies as raft flips on New River    By Dave Gustafson Staff writer    A Virginia teen died Tuesday after her raft flipped during a commercial rafting outing on a New River rapid nicknamed “The Meat Grinder,” after rescuers tried a perilous technique to pull her from the river.  Morgan Funk, 15, of Staunton, Va., drowned in the accident, WSAZ-TV reported. She had been on her first whitewater trip with her father when the accident occurred, the station reported.  The young woman was in a raft with at least six other people in the section known as Keeney’s Rapids on the lower New River near Winona when it overturned about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, spilling everyone out, said Lizzie Watts, a park ranger for the New River Gorge National River.  With the teen trapped downstream between rocks, rescue workers attempted to lift her out of the water by her lifejacket with a rope tied to both sides of the river, Watts said.  “It’s a very difficult technique, and it didn’t work in this case,” Watts said. “She didn’t seem to hear when the emergency workers were giving their commands.’’  The first raft on the trip, which was organized by Lansing-based outfitter The Rivermen, went through the rapids without incident, but another raft overturned while entering the second set of rapids, known as the Middle Keeney’s, Watts said.  Keeney’s Rapids are Class Five, the second most powerful on the river, she said. Raft guides generally refer to the Middle Keeney’s as “The Meat Grinder,” a guide with another rafting firm said.  Some of those in the water were pulled into boats. The victim was trapped against a rock downriver from the accident, Watts said. The other guide said the rocks above the Lower Keeney’s Rapids, where the teen was trapped, are one of the most difficult places on the river where a rescue could be set up.  Rivermen staff, other commercial boaters, as well as private boaters and video boaters, who document trips and provide safety support, began the rescue effort immediately following the spill. The Park Service was notified and got assistance from four fire departments, the state Division of Natural Resources, along with Fayette County deputies and emergency rescue workers, Watts said.  The girl’s body was recovered a couple of hours later and taken to the Fayette County coroner, Watts said.  The victim was wearing a lifejacket and helmet, and had attended a river safety course before the trip, Watts said. A guide with more than 70 trips’ experience was in charge of the boat in the accident.  The New River was at a good level for general rafting Tuesday, Watts said. Officials from DNR and the Park Service are still investigating the matter.  A phone number for The Rivermen did not accept messages Tuesday night.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.  To contact staff writer Dave Gustafson, use e-mail or call 348-5113.

      Somehow I think I've convinced spammers that I'm very, very dull.  They no longer send me emails advertising "Teenage sluts" and such but rather "Inexpensive yet hi-tech security camera" and "Need cheap printer ink?"  I'm not sure this is a positive thing...I'm still getting the same volume of spam, maybe it means they've been doing investigative research - reading my blog and emails for example.  I thought only Google was allowed to do that.  Assuming this theory is correct, it's  very  depressing to still get "Need another six inches?  We can help!"

      I think I make it obvious those days I spring the buck and the half-hour to read the WSJ: I talk about it.  Some of my posts are mundane, ordinary muckety-muck such as Wednesday's pejorative look at fat people.  However, on days like today, I devote my space to something more substantial.  For example, today I want to talk about Playboy.  If I were Joe Institutional Investor right now, I would be calling my trader and telling them to get me the hell out of Google.  I mean, their lawyers and bankers have tried so hard to keep these guys out of the press so they don't say anything stupid before the IPO, and the founders go out and interview with Playboy!  They've potentially breached the quiet period surrounding an IPO, which could set the offering back months.  I can just imagine every meeting these guys have with their IPO team:  Some stiff banker/lawyer/accountant: "Um, could you, um, please pay attention?  Remember what we were talking about?  Thirty-six  bil lion?  Remember?"  Founder guy (bouncing one of those annoying balls against the wall): "Yeah, whatever.  Hey, does anyone else want a frappucino?"  I'm imagining Zoolander, only with computers instead of being really, really good-looking.  I also want to talk about that d*ckhead, Eliot Spitzer.*  Never has anyone, in my memory, made as obvious a run for governor off the backs of  Journal  readers by pandering to those who buy the  Post .  His lawsuit against Grasso is ludicrous.   Ludicrous!   At worst, he is a power hungry politician so bent on higher office that he will do absolutely anything to get there - while thinking he's really too powerful to bother to cover it up.  At best, he is guilty of hating the player instead of the game.  Tru.   *Please excuse my language.  Which reminds me, at my interview last week, one of the lawyers said this to me: "Will my language offend you, if I am candid?  Such-and-such was so crappy!"  Honest.  I'm not making this up.

      For me, it's always that they're fat.  Real fat.  But not  urlLink this  fat.  Most amazing thing?  The guy is married.  They even have quotes from his wife that say how much he enjoys life.  Another funny thing - the article reports that the "League of Human Dignity" took the man to a  livestock sale  so he could be weighed.  Yeah right.  It was three guys in a pick-up going for a laugh.  And they had just been watching Superman cartoons on the cartoon network.

      I know the question everyone is asking:  Josh, I've heard through the grapevine that you got bumped up to first class on the flight from Houston to New York.  Is it really true!?  Yes, yes it is.  And it was sweet.  I think they even give you better snacks up there.  You know how everyone gets like peanuts or pretzels or something?  We got mixed nuts with walnuts and almonds and some nuts I didn't even know.  What do you mean were these strange nuts good?  They were first class, baby.  I knew, since I had been fourth on the waitless for the upgrade, that there were three other pretenders in first class.  I'm 99.85 percent sure that the guy sitting next to me was one of those.  First of all, he looked 14 - way too young to be getting first class treatment from CSFB, whose name was splashed all over his bag.  Second, he just looked uncomfortable.  I think he had to be very, very sure there was no "carding" going on before he ordered a drink.  So he made me feel a lot more comfortable - as did the three glasses of surprisingly mediocre red wine.   As for the rest: New York was great.  Interview went all smooth-like.  One of the first-years who took me to lunch made all sort of crude jokes while downing 3 Coors lights and the 22-oz "Junior" steak.  The only downer was that my suit, having three percent lycra instead of being all wool, is the opposite of breathable.  It was like I was walking around New York in a stylishly cut and well tailored plastic bag.  More to come, I should do some actual work.

      So I've been gone from the so-called blogosphere for a while. That's ok, because some of my colleagues have been absent since July 15 (Nemo), and July 10 (DTarr). They broke huge news those days and apparently thought their work in cyberland was done. Respectively, these news announcements were: engagement to 7 (?) year girlfriend (trying to beat the common law marriage cut-off) and solid proof that CNN has a liberal bent.  But in the meantime, a lot's happened. (1) Erstwhile Ann Arborite Megan found herself a job. Sort of. Apparently she is more of an indentured servant - working for no pay, but rather for food and shelter. Said shelter does not even have an indoor shower; she has to bathe outside and has to warm the water with actual fire. (2) Erstwhile Ann Arborite Megan quit her job and went to the city to "look for work." But really, Megan, I got your postcard (this is in part to brag that Megan sent me a postcard, and in part to thank Megan for the postcard) and I really liked it. The glacier looked sweet.  (3) I drove to Houston, hence the subject of this post. My girlfriend, Angeline, as you may recall, was spending six weeks in this town for summer institute. What I may or may not have mentioned was that one week after this six week stint expired she was to move there permanently - or at least for the two-year program. To do this, she needed her car and all her stuff. So we drove down from Ann Arbor to Houston with stuff in tow in her silver Taurus. You can fit a whole lot of stuff in a Taurus.  There were several sort-of cool things about this long-ass drive. (a) I got to see places I would never have otherwise. Take Houston for example; where they have no zoning laws. I'm still trying to schedule a visit to the Enron building. Or all the states I've never been through, and might never again. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Let's just say they're all nicer than Ohio, which I am more convinced than ever is the ugliest place on earth. Sorry Ho and Denbow, wherever you are. (b) I got to leave the Mayor's office forever. (c) Ok, there wasn't anything that was really cool to write about, but the entire affair was rather an adventure and generally fun - surprisingly so, actually.  (4) DTarr's birthday came and went. Maybe that's why the blog has been out of order (for 21 days). Sorry I didn't call or send beer. But Happy Birthday anyway.  (5) In Houston, we've done fun things like attend an estate sale. Angeline bought a large wooden cactus to match her mini Texan flag. We're going to paint it yellow and she's going to hang purses on it. I bought two leatherbound books. One is  The Prince . Is it entirely for effect and to try and look sweet? Yes. Will it work? Yes. I mean, how awesome is it to have a leatherbound copy of Machiavelli in your office? It's just bad-ass albeit in a dorky sort of way, but bad-ass nonetheless. The other was Alice in Wonderland. Which should be in leather, for a different sort of effect. That won't be in said office. Speaking of which, I don't really have an office...  (6) Second, um, cool-slash-surreal thing: shopping at Ikea. There is really no way to describe Ikea. I mean, on the one hand, it's awesome. They have tons of cool stuff (again, a different sort of cool. the home furnishings cool) and it's unbelievably inexpensive. There is just so much of this stuff as well as mobs and mobs of people. I don't even want to try and describe it, I just want to recommend it as an experience everyone must have, at least once. When I get back to Michigan, I really want to check out Cabella's. I'm expecting something similar.  (7) Finally, Jon Malinsky posted comments on my site and Jeff's. You can read them if you like. Anyway, it's great to hear from Jon and if he's still reading, he should send me an email so I can know what his address is.  Other cool stuff is imminent. On Wednesday night, I'm flying out of George H. W. Bush international airport to New York, where they pronounce Houston How-ston, for an interview on Thursday. I'll be sporting my new suit (which is freshly tailored and will be freshly pressed) so I'm expecting big things. This may be weird, but I usually like interviews. I've never had a "stress" (where you're yelled at or something) interview, so maybe that's why. It just seems that everyone's nice so long as you follow the traditional script, you walk around a cool building with a peppy recruiting assistant, then you go out to lunch. The thing starts at ten and lunch is over around 2:30. Then you go home. It's what work  should  be like. On the other hand, I haven't had much success getting a "job" out of interviews, so maybe I'm doing something completely wrong.  On Friday, Jeff and I (perhaps Munro, I don't know) are going to New Jersey to their "beach house." I expect rather gratuitous hijinks. Sunday, Jeff and I fly out of Newark, I to Michigan and he to LA.  So that's all (and I'm sure y'all, as they say here, are thinking "that's  all !?"). This has been rather a long post. Consider that a treat for waiting oh so patiently since my last post. I'll try to get out another before I leave H-town so I can include anything I forgot.
