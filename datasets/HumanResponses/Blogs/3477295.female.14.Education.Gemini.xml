      Only a few have seen this new blog. Daniel, me, uhh... and who ever is looking at it right now!  My birthday is coming up! Only a few more days! 14 years on this planet.... How did my parents survive that long without ending my little life?  My mom and dad got my birthday off. I was invited to go to the lake with Bri and I kinda want to go. I'm not sure yet. I hope I can go to church on Sunday though. See DJ right before my birthday! Say "At this time tomorrow I will be 14." (Of course church ends at 10:30 a.m.)  My mom doesn't really like the parking there....  Oh! Just over an hour ago I got a birthday kiss. I feel so special!  Yeah.... I'm random no doubt.

      Ello mates! So you've come to see how I got this nice dark spot around my eye huh? Okay. Here goes....    Franci and Stan (Brianna's parents; also know as "Mom" and "Dad") went into the house to calm down Brandon (Brianna's little brother; 5; also known as "Get off of me you little freak!" jk). Brianna, Majpluam, and I were on the lawn chairs sun tanning by the pools. Once the front door closed to Brianna's apartment, these 5 Mexican kids came out 'towards the pool. Once they came into the fenced area around the pool, the "leader" started saying stuff like "Ha! At least we don't have to have our mommies watch us while we swim." and "Aww! I feel bad for that baby.... NOT!"   That was the last straw. Brianna got up and jumped on that girl! She was (in nice words) MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The girl looked surprised. As Bri was on top of her, the 4 boys that were with her went to her rescue. As they started trying to pull her off, Majpluam and I attacked.   Right before we started hitting them one said, "You don't want to hit us, you want to kiss us." Majpluam and I stopped running and I walked up to the boy who said that and said, "You know what? Maybe.... I want to do this........" And I got up in his face where it looked like I was going to kiss him and punched him straight in the mouth.   Brianna got pushed off and hit the cement, then jumped back on the girl again.   We were all fighting and started getting close to the pool. Luckily for us (Brianna, Majpluam, and me) we were in our bikinis still, but sad for them, they were still in their clothes, because we all ended up in the pool. The 3 of us pushed, but the 5 of them held onto us. As we got dragged in, our legs hit the edges. Which now means we have cuts, scrapes, and maybe some bruises on our legs and ankles. So all 8 of us went in...... And now the fun begins!  As I must add this as vital, most of us ended up swallowing water. (You'll see why in a bit......) When Majpluam went in she landed on 2 of the 4 boys. I landed on the other 2. Brianna and the girl were still goin' at it. They were screaming ALOT. Yet, it looked and sounded like they were screaming out of fun. The guys were mostly grunting at our blows. Luckily we were in the 5 foot part of the pool or we would have done alot worse to the boys.... We made them swallow twice as much more water as when we went in and we kept them under for a good while! A few more screams from Brianna and her foe. She bit her ear.  Then the front door of Brianna's apartment began to open. We swam away. We swam to the deep end. The group of Mexicans were still in the shallow end. Franci, Stan, and Brandon all came back out. It looked like they had fought each other (Mexicans). There was blood floating around in the water.  They never found out the truth of what happened. The story we gave them about how we got our cuts and I got my black eye was that when we were jumping in we all messed up and hit the edge. And I got my black eye by swimming under the water and Bri had accidentally kicked my in the face.  The funniest thing about this is that we didn't know those people...... and we still don't. We don't even know their names!!!!!    What utter fun! Yeah right. So I have cuts on both ankles and a black eye. Yay!!!!

      Okay, promotion was kinda boring. (From my view at least.)   I played in the band. We played 4 songs and then the 8th graders had to leave. We put away our intruments and went to the line that we had to get in to go on stage and get our names called. I saw DJ and went straight to him. We were messing around at the back of the line and my friends were too. We were having fun just waiting there. The band started playing the Processional and we started to walk on stage 2 by 2. 1 person on each side of the stage. When we had gone down the front steps we took our seats. I sat with 1 of my best friends on one side of the seating area while DJ sat with my other friend. Me and Bri sat behind Joey V. We messed with him the whole time! He wasn't getting all mad at us like he usually would either. He let us. We took apart his pen. We put it in about 7 different pieces. After all that was over Bri went off to see her Nana. I went to find Majpluam and we took a photo together. I still haven't seen the picture but I want a copy of it. (Hear the MJ?) After MJ left I went to find DJ. I ran into my mom and grandma first, then DJ showed up. My gramma took 2 pictures of us. Then of my other friends. Then we left.   After I went home I went back to the school. I had forgotten my folder. (The one for band.) I knew Aleksis had it but I needed to find it. My dad took me back and I went ALL over both of the schools. The high school and the middle school. Finally, I was walking with my music teacher and I saw Lexi! We ran to each other and hugged. She took me to the band room and gave me the folder. After that I went down to the middle school office and I went to see Ms. Figgy. (That's what I called her.) I had been in the B&amp;G Club and she said she would give me a list of the activities that I had done so I could get volunteer work points on my college/work application(s). She told me that she owould mail it to me, because she didn't like the way that they had turned out. Then I went home for good. (Sort of.)   When I got home I left to go to Chilis with Bri. We spent an hour or 2 there. DJ kept calling me while i was eating.   Then at 4 I met up with DJ at the UA theater. We went to see The Day After Tomorrow. It was really good. DJ wanted me to be scared so that I would be clinging onto him during the movie. But I wasn't so I didn't. Sucks for him.   Then I officially went home and stayed there.   Lysie

      Thanks to my family for the pressies!  I didn't get anything from my friends or my boyfriend. I didn't ask for anything. I didn't want anything. And besides, what I did want was WAAAAAAAY out of their price range. A clarinet. Come on! They're like $200+.  What I got was cool anyway. I got a Gameboy SP, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Game (for it), Summer time Tigger, some bangles with my first initial, a skate T-Shirt, and a book. The book isn't that cool but oh well. I also got a giftcard. I used it in one go! I got a new skirt, new socks (curious george!), and a new pair of boxers! (Girl type.)  I can't wait untill the 10th. My 2 BEST friends are going to spend the night. This will be the first time Joey has ever spent the night, and the second time Tom has.  Lysie

      I repainted my room. It used to be blue. Now it's 2 different shades of green! Thanks to my dad for buying the paint and supplies. And thanks to my friends Tom and Timmy for helping paint. (You know who you are! I love your guys' nicknames. Mines just plain Bob.....) I'm sorry you couldn't make it Joey. I know you wanted to.  &nbsp;  Peaces,  Lysie

      I just wanted to say thank you to Dj for that wonderful present. I know that this is very late. And that I was given the pressie a long while ago.... But I don't care. It's beautiful and I wanted everyone to know. He gave me a silver jewelry box for my birthday. (Late birthday.) But it's still nice. I told everyone that I didn't want anything and only 2 of my best friends (the best of the best of the best of my friends) took me seriously. I thank them for that.  &nbsp;  Peaces for now,  Lysie

      Ok, all that actually read my posts...... We (as in me and&nbsp;Shane at the moment) are planning to gather up everybody, steal them away, and take them to the magical Wild Waters. That's right W.W. So if you still got your tix from when they gave us all refunds then throw together a beach bag and head on over. Even if you don't&nbsp;have a ticket then you get to wait and pay full price or&nbsp;use your season pass. We want you there anyway.&nbsp;We aren't sure when but we'll figure out a time and date soon.   For more info on this or if you just want to talk then email me or call me. If you don't have my number then email me and I can give you my number.
