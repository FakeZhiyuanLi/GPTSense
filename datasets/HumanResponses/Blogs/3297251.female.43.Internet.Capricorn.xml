      All I know is my own life. I feel like I'm overwhelmed, then I stop and think about all the people who are worse off than me. But, honestly, that doesn't keep me from feeling overwhelmed. And a bit depressed.  My day today consisted of getting up, getting ready for work, getting my son ready for his day, dropping him off at daycare, getting to work, working for 8 hours, picking my son up, getting supper ready, mowing the front yard (had to save the back yard for tomorrow), showering (again), folding laundry, ironing some clothes, putting another load of laundry in, emptying the trash, sweeping the cat litter out of the garage, emptying the dishwasher, getting my son into bed, and then putting the second load of laundry away. This is my life, day after day. Nothing else.  I'm going to bed. Maybe I'll have some excitement in my dreams.

      Why am I  always  attracted to men who are unavailable? Mike has GREAT eyes that sparkle when he's flirting (which is frequent). They're sort of greenish-hazel in color. It's easy for me to tell when he's switched to the serious, work mode; but then he switches back to the flirty mode pretty easily. He's very easy-going, which I find really attractive.  We're all supposed to get together next Tuesday after work for dinner and discussion. Maybe my recent fantasies about him will materialize? Until then, I'll just go to bed and fantasize more. Sigh.

      Last night went well, IF you know what I mean  ;)  'Nuff on that subject.  Have you ever wondered which of these is true? Is it ...     Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  or is it ...     Out of sight, out of mind.  I hope it's the first where Todd is concerned. We talk almost every weeknight, but STILL, we haven't seen each other since last July. I honestly thought we'd at least be engaged by now. I wish there was something I could do, but I know there's not. And I do admire him for wanting to get his problems straightened out before we start a life together. But still, don't you think it's a fine line between stubborn and stupid?

      Okay, here's the deal. I haven't seen Todd since last JULY. Can you believe it? And no, I haven't even gone on a date since then. So that leaves me ... where? I think I'm going to bed early.  Nudge nudge wink wink (to borrow a line from Pythonite Eric Idle.)

      I was so tired and so overwhelmed last night that I was just about in tears. I knew that I just needed to sleep, that things would look better in the morning. Which, for the most part, was true.  I just have so much to do, just to keep caught up (not even trying to get ahead right now!).  Gotta hit the sack. Goodnight.

      Okay, actually it was a very LONG day. On my feet from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., but at least I got a ton done! (Maybe the owners will take notice and I'll get a huge bonus?!) I'll be glad though when my own store opens so I can have better control over my hours. And I won't have to drive so dang far either. And the good news, there's a Starbucks on the way to my new store! Hello, latte!  Let's see, what sort of excitement did I have at home tonight. Oh, yeah, I cleaned the main gerbil cage. I know, too much fun for one night. They were so cute though when I put them back in, running around and sniffing everything like it was new! They're asleep now, which I guess I should be doing soon (since I have another long day ahead of me tomorrow, with no prospect of my flirtatious boss showing up either. Sigh.)  Speaking of being on my feet ... I wore my new Dansko clogs today and they helped keep my feet and lower back from hurting so much. Got 'em off of eBay, of course!  Does that part about my feet and lower back not hurting so much make me sound OLD?!?!

      DID YOU KNOW ... that you can actually boil an egg so much that it explodes?!  I did that very thing tonight. And boy does it stink. I put two eggs on to boil, and the (obviously) forgot about them. I was on the phone w/ my boyfriend when I heard something loud. Thinking it was the gerbils or the cat, I went to explore. As I got closer to the kitchen, the smell hit me and then I realized what it was. Just as I picked up the pot to remove it from the heat the 2nd egg exploded. Well, actually, it just popped (if it had truly exploded I'd probably still be cleaning egg off the ceiling). At any rate, all of the water was gone and the boiled eggs were now preparing to fry. NOT a pleasant thing. Hopefully the stench will be gone before I go to work tomorrow; I shudder to think what my clothes might smell like!  I've had two prior adventures along these lines. I'll save those for another blog on another day :)

      There's so much to this site ... or at least it seems like it! How do I find stuff from other people? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING!  Either it's because of (a) the old dog-new tricks syndrome or (b) i'm running out of fuel. I went to bed last night right before midnight and woke up around 4:30 a.m. -- and of course I couldn't get back to sleep. I'm sittin' here right now drinking coffee (decaf fortunately!), barely able to keep my eyes open.  I had to work in the yard again tonight, which is definitely a love-hate relationship. I actually used a string trimmer for the first time in my life and discovered something about myself. I am a weakling. More on my physical shape (generally out of shape, that is) and my yard later.  I guess I'll go brush my teeth (Tom's of Maine natural toothpaste!) and head off to bed. I'll probably drift off to sleep just as the gerbils wake up. Ah, such is life.

      I'm in week two of my new job with AuctionPlus, The Listing Store. It's going well, though things are still pretty slow. The idea behind AuctionPlus is that we help people sell their items on eBay -- people with no experience, no computer at home, not enough time, etc. It's a brand-new company and a new concept in the Kansas City metro area, so of course things are slow right now. The two men who started the company are great, and I really like them both. My store in Lee's Summit is scheduled to open on June 1, 2004. It'll be a lot more fun working at my own store! In case you're reading this and you're interested in the concept, check out www.auctionplus.com.

      when will that last worthless evening occur? it doesn't look like it's gonna be anytime soon. right now my job is my life. which in a way is good, because it's my future. but i need more than that. i need a man in my life. Todd. all i can do is hope and pray that he gets problems resolved soon, on his terms. he won't take help (stubborn or noble? it's a fine line).  btw, i'm mastering the skill of mousing w/ my left hand to help alleviate the numbness in my right wrist. pretty sad, huh?!  and a word about the weather ... it's June 19, 11:26 p.m., and 59 degrees outside. can you believe it?!  g'night.

      Yes, it's love actually. When I think of Todd, when I see his picture, when I talk to him. It's love. Pure and simple.
