      I see your face in every crowd I hear your laughter in every conversation I long for your sweet smile.  How i wish a rainbow would appear, to bridge these thousand miles between us. Will you cross the distance for me? Will you come back for me? When the clock strikes midnight, Every chime hammers in the fact that you're not here.  As i look into the glittering night, I joined the stars and found your smile in the sky.  In my arms is where you belong, Yet you are where my hands can't reach. Are you alone? Are you sad? Are you thinking of me? Are you safe? Are you happy? Are you missing me?  Here in my room, the fan slowly stirs the midnight air, Just like thoughts of you stir my emotions. In my dreams, we'll meet. And til the intrusive morning comes,  We'll dance together, my love.

      its a relative thing, really... if you start ur day early, you feel time passes more slowly, if you start it late, time passes very quickly.   ok, i think i have gone mad from attempting to study, i love my dad for being so understanding and supportive.   anione out there actually reading this? blogging is like an excuse for me to slack and use the computer.   jane: why you drink so much sprite? mum: yah lor, u know 1can is equivalent to 10 bowls of rice? me:hmm.. i have eaten almost 30 bowls todae then  something mean i did yesterdae. my sister is sick lah, so her bf came over. so she was lying on his legs, and he pulled a chair to stretch his legs lah, so he also fell asleep. i went down to get sprite, and decided to play a prank on him. i put the ice chilled-just-out-of-the-fridge can against his toe. -waits- no reaction. so i put on the other big toe(different foot) and still, no reaction. suddenly my fan went  cling  and i thot he would wake up..but no! after 4 secs! he opens his eyes wide and stares at his frozen toe in disbelief. haha... i was laughing like siao already and he said: "you are dam horrible ..."  hahha, i feel so mean....

      hmm, so i have gotten over  some  things. sometimes i let my emotions rule me and i really hate it when i reflect back and think why i acted in that way.   isnt it nice if i could give up everything, pursue all my dreams, travel the world... without having to worry abt anything?... yet i knoe i have my responsibilities, i cant just leave, things arnt supposed to work this way.  "I know you're supposed to get hit by an arrow and all, but the rest of it isnt supposed to hurt so much." - a 8yr old boy on love. so sweet, yet he's too young to understand that love isnt that simple. you go thru much more than that. Tears, joy, laughter, quarrels, heartaches. i'm not in ani position to comment, but i know that it can be a v.wonderful thing.  I try hard to make sure i control overthing, yet maybe i'm not that strong...   maybe this sheds me in a different light form what u know me as.... *evil eyes*

      why am i doing this quiz when millions of others are going to get the same results as me? its quite dumb, cause how can so many ppl have the same character as me...

        urlLink    zhengfu and me!&nbsp; urlLink     its the hols and i am rejecting almost every request to go out. only for those i cant decline ie.Amanda's bdae. well, PW sux big time... i did not reliase until i had so many things to type and settle(minutes, research, summary.) yup, but i'm sure i can do it!  being a slacker, and the last minute study-er that i am, i have practically no time to finish all my work. The most neglected sunbject happens to be hist, but i cant be bothered abt that now. I hope i pass my maths and econs... esp math! or i'll be letting my tutor down. he has been very lenient with me, cause he thinks i will do my work, yet i always manage to hide it from him.  somehow i'm glad i'm not attached. i mean if i were, it'd be totally time consuming and i dun think i am ready to commit. can you imagine how you'd be obliged to call, meet up, be nice, caring....... i dun think thats me. cause i'm someone who keeps alot of things to myself. like i'm quite a loner and i'd like my partner to be proactive. meaning he has to love me more that i love him. which is unhealthy for a relationship.   so i've digressed, i think i'll be dead shocked at my JCT results.  not to forget, my report to get me back to training!!! haven written it at all.... i miss hanging out with the gang. zf, ss, py, jason, ws! no one to tease abt being fat... haiz....    if anyone's wondering why i write using the pen name Zhengyu, its cause i've gotten quite used to it as my nickname le....

      everyone you meet could be fighting a harder battle than yours. isnt it mean how we always think that we have the right to flare up at ppl?   maybe i'm just bored....   k, finally, my blog is up... i have 2 wks left to study and here i am... slacking online. as you can see, its not very nicely done up yet... so give me time to improve.  haiz, feel so restless, dun feel like studying, feel like eating! where is my food?!! taking so long to get home...  anyway, tag me!

      haiz... i was planning to do all my work since i ended early on Tuesdays. then I had to smartly find out that the tr had made a mistake and the group that had to hand in the PW file was my grp! ok, -panics- so i had to stay back and do like siao, until 5. Of course&nbsp;3 hrs wasnt enough. (including lunch, and chi -- sacrificed to do pw)&nbsp;so i have been doing pw until now. which means in total, i did pw for 9 hrs. Shiok rite? wasted all my time!   i'm feeling damn hungry now...... 9 hrs of work, i deserve a treat man. dieting is underway, trying to stop my huge appetite from growing even more ( something i have trouble doing).  no one reads, so dun expect me to blog so much... its called blogstipation, to quote yiQing. and i dun even know her.....  my mind is drained, i am totally exhausted..... no time for anithing. Thats Singapore JC life for u. No life to be exact!......  Dua pui, jason, ahfu.....ss... nothing, just call for fun.... people who add alot of colour to my life :)

      hmm, has windsurfing session with the sailors the whole day. i went out with titus initially, to teach him, but we kept getting swept towards the canal wall. so i guess i was sailing more than him cause i kept trying to save us. then later i left him for.... i duno actually.... haha, but we had fun. i was slacking ard when i heard Koh Eng Chee shouting, saying someone&nbsp;was in the canal and he just abandoned his equipment to attempt to save her. i took equipment and sailed over and realised that its was han ying inside. haha, that was quite funny, then came out from the other side of the canal and carried the equipment up the stairs.   We proceeded to Suntec and you wont believe what i ate. 1 Zinger burger, 2pcs of chicken, 1 whipped potato, 1 cheese fries and my drink. thats like 1 drink, 1 coleslawand 1 whipped potato short of a buddy meal. And the worse thing was  i wasnt super full . haha... i am getting so damn fat lah. i must exercise self control.   watched King Arthur. wasnt fantastic but was ok. the girl was chio, thought i cant rememebr her name. Arthur was quite a leader... leading his knights.   hmm.... sch sux, alot of work to do, ok, i am going to do it now.... been wasting my time awae...

        Apathy, well I can say your lucky, in some ways. You see Apathy is no emotion, basically you don't care. But that does not make you a bad person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a little more. Trust me life hurts, most people who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt. But don't worry, life is pain, its also pleasure. Good luck. (please vote)    urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      MAKING LOVE OUT OF NOTHING AT ALL (Air Supply)  I know just how to whisper And I know just how to cry I know just where I find the answers And I know just how to lie I know just how to fake it And I know just how to scheme I know just when to face the truth And then I know just when to dream And I know just where I touch you And I know just what to prove I know when to pull you closer And I know when to let you loose  And I know the night is fading And I know the time’s gonna fly  And I’m never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you  But I know I’ve got to give it a try  And I know the roads to riches And I know the ways to pain I know all the rules and then I know how to break’em And then I always know the name of the game   But I don’t know how to leave you  And I’ll never let you fall And I don’t know how you do it Making love out of nothing at all  Making love Out of nothing at all (x6)  Everytime I see you, well the rays of the sun are all Streaming through the waves in your hair And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes Like a spotlight  The beating of my heart is a drum and it’s lost   And it’s looking for a rhythm like you  You can take the darkness from the deep of the night And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright I gotta follow it ‘cause everything I know Well, it’s nothing ‘till I give it to you  I can make the runner stumble I can make the final block And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle And I can make all the stadiums rock  I can make tonight forever Or I can make it disappear by the dawn And I can make you every promise that’s ever been made And I can make all your demons be gone  But I’m never gonna make it without you Do you really wanna see me crawl ? And I’m never gonna make it like you do Making love out of nothing at all  Making love Out of nothing at all...
