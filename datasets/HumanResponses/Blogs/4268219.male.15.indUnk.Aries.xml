      Political News Article: PM sketches the roles of his key men (ST) Summary: The newly sworn-in PM Lee Hsien Loong made his first remarks on the new cabinet, and spelt out the roles of the four most senior members of his government last night. He called his team a strong and tested one, which he has helped to recruit over the years, adding that he only had to redeploy and promote some. The four most senior members of his government were SM Goh Chok Tong, MM Lee Kuan Yew, DPM Tony Tan and DPM S. Jayakumar. He then proceeded to spell out each of their roles. SM Goh Chok Tong would help develop Singapore’s links abroad, relying on an extensive international network built up over the years, with a special attention to the Middle East. He would also help the PM sell government policies and consolidate support. He would also be chairing the Monetary Authority of Singapore until younger ministers were ready for the job. MM Lee Kuan Yew’s role would be that of a trusted guide. He would no longer be in charge of day-to-day running of government or of setting directions for Singapore. He would remain in cabinet to keep current younger ministers’ thinking and lend his experience and perspective to those in cabinet. DPM Tony Tan would be the Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, in charge of implementing the national anti-terrorism strategy outlined last month. He would also oversee university education, and chair a ministerial committee to review direction for research and development agencies and programmes. He intends to retire after next June. DPM S. Jayakumar would also be the Minister for Law. He will be chairing a Cabinet committee on foreign policy matters which cut across different ministries. He will remain in charge of foreign policy issues involving legal negotiation or international adjunction, such as the Pedra Branca dispute and the land reclamation issue. Despite just unveiling a new team, PM Lee said that he planned to reinforce it, saying that grooming successors early, timely renewal and smooth transition were a unique feature of their system.
