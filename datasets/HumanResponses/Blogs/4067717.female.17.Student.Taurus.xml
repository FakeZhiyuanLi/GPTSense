      OK so work tonight sucked. Bo-ring. There wasn't anyone to talk to. But Lindsey and I went to the Metropolitan afterwards and got coffee, so that was fun. Not to mention I got to see her new puppy! Chloe is a labrador/pit bull mix and she's soooo cute!  In other news, saw 'Eddie' tonight. Sarah, have you looked up a picture of Luke Mably yet? Anyway, as usual, I was too shy/tongue-tied/much of a loser to say anything, so it was basically a walk-past with no eye contact thing. *sigh* Must learn how to flirt...  I just watched 'The Quick and the Dead' on TBS. Horrible movie, made worse by the fact that it had potential, but still entertaining. Russell Crowe is hot. That reminds me, I need to see 'Gladiator.' I've heard it's good, though historically inaccurate.  Mom's at work, so I know she'll be in a bad mood when she gets home. Oh, here she comes now! Dad and I both think she'll be putting in her two weeks' notice soon. Heh, heh, heh. What else was I going to say?  Oh! You wanted to know who barrydublin is? I really don't know. I found his blog while looking at random entries on the 'most recently published' list and thought it was hysterical. You can't understand a word he's saying, as it's all written in what I think is supposed to be Irish slang. But there are some interesting pictures.  Tiffany and Nicolee are camping tonight and tomorrow night at Kanopolis. I'm not, because Mom was being OVERPROTECTIVE as usual. She thinks I would have fallen into the lake. *rolls eyes*  Perhaps I'll wait till  after  I turn 18 to tell her about the cruise...   'Cause I'm broken   When I'm lonesome   And I don't feel right   When you're gone away  AWESOME SONG: "Broken" by Seether with Amy Lee

      Almost done with 'Revisited!' 60 more pages to go! I think I'll read ten per day from now on, so I can go ahead and start Portrait of a Lady tonight after work. I think I will really enjoy that book.  Just watched MacGyver. He's still hot.  The tree-painting at BGS has been moved to tomorrow. This is actually better for me, since I don't have to work tomorrow (for once-- I swear I work way more than every other Sunday). I forgot to ask if Mrs. B has paint brushes and a drop cloth and everything, so I hope she does.  So, um...that's about it. Dunno why I wrote this, just bored I guess.

      There is a gray cat on my lap as I type this. Cleo is so cute!!!  Mom and Dad are watching the very end of Cold Mountain. Twas a very good movie, but sad at the end. I went and got gas earlier, so I missed out on semi-naked Jude Law. What a shame! :(  Lindsey, I hope you are reading this! Work was OK tonight. Got to talk a lot, and there wasn't much stock to put out. Hopefully it'll all be gone tomorrow, and all I'll have to do is that one plan-o-gram, which shouldn't take long. Whee! More goof-off time!  The tree-painting at Buhler Grade has been moved to Sunday, which means I get to sleep in tomorrow. YES!! Which means I have no excuse not to finish BNW:Revisited tonight. Darn.  Which is why I am drinking Dr. Pepper at 10:00 PM. That is, what's left of it after it sprayed all over the kitchen. Including the walls and the floor. *sigh*  Well, hey, I accomplished my goal! I was happy all day long :D   Some people want it all,   But I don't want nothin' at all.   If I ain't got you, babe.   Some people want diamond rings,   and some just want everything.   But I don't want nothin',   If I ain't got you.  -Alicia Keys, the aptly named.

      Just got back from The Strand. I now have blonde and red highlights in my hair! Woohoo! It looks good, except you can't really tell that there's red in it. But the blonde is nice. It's still long and curly, too. I've decided that longing for straight hair is a waste of time, since there's nothing I can do about it.   Sarah, you're right. Stephen Tyler is quite possibly the ugliest man in rock 'n' roll. Except for Marilyn Manson, but then he's not exactly a man anymore, is he?&nbsp; Sorry I was feeling sorry for myself last night, I get that way sometimes.   What picture of me do you have on your fridge? I hope it's not my school picture.   I read part of Brave New World: Revisited while my hair was drying in the salon. God, this is a dumb book. It's anti-everything. He raves and raves about the problems our society has but he never suggests a solution. Only eighty pages to go, then I can start on Portrait of a Lady.    I know I tend to get so insecure    It doesn't matter anymore     &nbsp;   It's not always rainbows and butterflies    It's compromise that moves us along    My heart is full and my door's always open    You can come anytime you want     &nbsp;   I don't mind spending everyday    Out on your corner in the pouring rain    Look for the girl with the broken smile    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile    And she will be loved    She will be loved    Notes:  This is "She Will be Loved" by Maroon5. It is a very good song, at least it was until they started playing it on the radio.    Today's Resolution:  Be Happy! :)

      I don't know why I am writing this except I am bored. I am only talking to one person on MSN, and it's a real person (as opposed to someone I don't really know), so it's not nearly as interesting. For one thing, I cannot have deeply educational conversations about the differences between the public school systems of the US and those of the Netherlands.   Thank you, Ilke!  Anyway, I thought I would come on here and write a nice rant about why my love like sucks. Here is a list:  1. I DON'T HAVE ONE.  There, wasn't that a lovely list?  So, in an attempt to analyze myself (or, more specifically, why I lack a romantic entanglement of any kind), I made another list. This is a list of the reasons I feel are responsible for my non-love life:  1. Lack of physical beauty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Analysis: While I am no Liv Tyler, I don't really think I'm dog-ugly, either. Of course, most boys my age are much more interested in facial characteristics than personality, so that could be a contributing factor.  2. Shyness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Entirely my fault, and entirely true. See previous post, in which I practically beg everyone who reads it not to tell 'Eddie' that I like him. NOBODY KNOWS WHO EDDIE IS! I am paranoid! This cannot be healthy! I have this huge fear of rejection (which I have been blaming on Sarah Whisler and Erin Lomasney for five years, which is also unhealthy, I'm sure) that keeps me from flirting or doing anything that might let guys know I am interested in them. Gaah. Except, apparently, for young men who work at Subway. Perhaps there is a strange forcefield around Subway restaurants that inhibits my shy aura?  3. Off-putting intellect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~AKA: I am a know-it-all, sarcastic bitch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, this one is self-explainatory, and I really can't refute it in any way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damnit, I'm not supposed to cuss anymore.  &nbsp; All right, that's about all I can think of right now. If anyone is reading this, I would appreciate any input that is not a carefully calculated compliment designed to make me feel better about myself. :D

      I am taking a rather large risk in writing this, because I REALLY don't want anyone to know that I like this guy. So if anyone is reading this and you figure out who I'm talking about, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't say anything, OK? I have had enough embarrassment in this area of my life already. A lot, in fact. Too much.  I call him 'Eddie' because he looks exactly like the character of that name from 'The Prince and Me'.  Today was a ssslllooowww day at ALCO. I would love to be able to write some scintillating stuff about what I did to further my social life before and after work, but all I did was watch MacGyver and surf the web. When I should have been reading Brave New World: Revisited, which is quite possibly the most boring thing I have ever been required to read for school. Thanks a lot, Mr. Knapp.  I made a hair appointment for tomorrow morning!!! I will get a trim, I think, and some highlights. Probably some red and some light brown, but I'll ask the stylist what she thinks. Maybe I'll let her completely redo my head. God knows I need it! :P  Aaaannd...that's about it.&nbsp;Sarah, here's some happy music for you:  Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   And just like the man whose feet were too big for his bed   Nothin' seems to fit!   Raindrops keep fallin on my head, they keep fallin'   So I just did me some talkin' to the sun.   And I said I didn't like the way he got things done!   Sleepin' on the job!   Oh, Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'   But there's one thing I know   The blues that come to&nbsp;meet me   won't defeat me!   It won't be long,&nbsp;   Till happiness steps up to greet me   Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red!   Cryin's not for me!   No, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'   Because I'm free   Nothin's worryin' me!

       I would call this the 'Dirty Confession Time' entry (which is obligatory in all of these little diary thingies I've set up all over the internet; I wonder how many are left, anyway?), but no one is going to read this except maybe Sarah, and I'm not sure I want her reading my confessions. She would just laugh and tell me I need to get a life because my confessions are nowhere near as good as hers are.    &nbsp;  So I will take this time to tell no one a little bit about what is going on in MY life right now. Pertinent Stats: &nbsp;~Finished Brave New World today. Now I just have to read Brave New World: Revisited and Portrait of a Lady in the next 20 days or so. No sweat.   ~Still working at ALCO. Gotta love it.   ~Got hit on by the guy making my sandwich at Subway yesterday. The SECOND time that has happened! Different guys, different stores, but both were making my sandwich at Subway! Maybe I should go there more often...Nothing can be as bad as the freak at the library (who later showed up to hit on Tiffany when we were in Hastings; THAT was beyond weird)   ~Still in love (from afar) with "Eddie" (I can't put his real name on here because I have this blog address as my MSN name, and three people on my MSN know this guy. Unfortunately, I don't have  his  MSN :( )   ~MacGyver is hot.   ~Seriously.   ~I am seriously considering having my hair straightened. What do you think? *dead silence* Right.    &nbsp;

      &nbsp;Ha. Sarah, you so owe me. Not for the money, but for setting this up so you will not have to suffer the humiliation of having only one person ever leave comments to your blog.  &nbsp;But that's OK. You probably won't notice the additional guilt, since I'll already be rubbing in about how I SAVED YOUR ASS by loaning you money so you can talk to your boyfriend (Is he really younger than me? Eww.).  &nbsp;Note to self: Visit Sarah's blog more often. Discover all her other dirty little secrets. (As if I had to ask ;)  &nbsp;Last night I dreamed that someone tried to strangle me while I was in the ALCO stockroom. Phillip and Jason ended up chasing the attacker all around the upstairs, and I stood with Alice, LaDonna, Tess, and Michelle and listened to them knock stuff over. Quite interesting.

      OK, I've been mostly putting stuff on my Xanga site, because people actually read that one. But then, my sister reads this one, and she's a person. What's a girl to do?  Mmmm...Starbucks DoubleShot!

      Well. Today was my first day of Yearbook. It was a marathon. Nine AM till 7 PM if you count the signing party (which was torture, because the only people who came were your typical preppy snobs...oh, wait, that's 95% of the student body...) and I had to do paperwork the whole time. Whatever possessed me to volunteer to be ad manager? Argh.  Not to mention I spilled red juice on my brand new shirt. :'( Mom says it'll wash out, though...gosh that sounds childish.  This year is going to be so hectic. I hope I don't end up having to quit work...I don't think I will, but with band and homework and yearbook I dunno if I'll have time (and patience) for it all!  OK, enough complaining. Off to watch The Whole Nine Yards now... :)

       urlLink   A SILVER Dragon Lies Beneath!       My inner dragon is to dragons what the Ranger is to humans. I possess considerable intelligence and self-confidence. I live by my own code of ethics and I stick to it at all times. Click the image to try the Inner Dragon Online Quiz for yourself.    Your Inner Dragon is to dragons what the Ranger is to humans. Silvers are one of three types of metallic dragon, the others being Gold and Copper. Like all metallics, Silvers rigidly adhere to an internal code of conduct. Unlike the other two metallics, however, this code is not universal. Each Silver must develop their code individually, a fact which explains their unique dispositions and actions. Silvers are often considered outcasts or shadows dwelling on the periphery of dragon culture (much like human Rangers), but they can always be counted upon to speak the truth and help their allies. Because no one but a Silver knows what they'll do next, their alignment is "Chaotic Neutral."  Being a Silver isn't all shady head-games, though. You possess considerable intelligence and self-confidence (whether they manifest themselves or not), and given the opportunity could make a great leader. Magic isn't really your bag, but you're awfully good at slipping in and out of a situation or conflict undetected. Which, by the way, may be due to your slightly-below-average size more than anything else. Your favorable attributes are dependability, durability, problem-solving, mist, fog, silver, and pewter. Like your human counterpart - the Ranger - you're a superb weapons user and have an especially good command of your icy breath weapon. Just keep in mind that even your friends may find your ethics hard to accept from time to time.     Actually, I took the quiz and it came out to 'Blue'. But I clicked on the silver result, and thought it described me better. Obviously, my personal code of ethics does not ban cheating...;-)

      Is it better to be seen as something you're not than to not be seen at all?  We went shopping in Wichita today! It was a lot of fun, especially Kohls, Linens N Things, and Borders. The mall was OK, except I now HATE American Eagle. As soon as I walked in it was like being drenched in meanness. Dunno how else to explain it. Maurice's was cool, as always, though not so interesting now that we have one in Hutch. Still bought stuff there, though ;)  Then we ate too much at On the Border. So yummy... :-D        I AM 70% EVIL GENIUS!

      OK, some rather confusing thoughts, as I try to put off reading Portrait of a Lady.  Is it strange to want everyone to know something, and yet want no one to know it at the same time?  Is it wrong to use someone for your own purposes if they're too clueless to know what you're doing?  If you know, without a doubt, that you might be able to do something with your life to benefit mankind, is it morally wrong to spend it doing something you love, instead?  Are all boys idiots? Scratch that. Know the answer.  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? I will never know, because I always bite it.  Why are lower-quality books and movies so much more gratifying than the 'classics'?  Why, when no one is going to read it, am I writing this?

      Dad was on the computer all night, so I couldn't type anything. Not that I have anything to say, really. On page 140 of Portrait of a lady! Only 410 to go! Woohoo!  Work was super boring last night. Did you know it's fun to look through bridal magazines? It is. They have gorgeous dresses in there.  Alice and Michelle were talking about the effects that Alzheimer's and strokes can have on the elderly, which made me sad. Memo to me: find out how grandpa is doing.  Aaand...work again today. But that's good, cause the sooner today is over, the sooner we go SHOPPING in Wichita on Monday!!! And then get to see Jonathan and Kara and maybe Jennifer either Monday night or Tuesday night. Par-tay!

      For now. Dad'll be back any minute now. But last night both parents were gone! There was an ALCO 'meeting' at the Hastings coffee shop after work, which was fun, because Beth was there and I hardly ever get to see her. So Kari, Beth, AJ, Derek and I all sat around for almost two hours talking about nothing. It was a lot of fun. Kari and I are lobbying to make it a friday or saturday night tradition (even though yesterday was Thursday, but oh well).  Then I came home, got online, and read fanfiction till 1:30 am while eating homemade salsa. Yum! And best of all, I wasn't tired today!!! Maybe I have found the magic number: five hours of sleep is the right amount for me? Four is too little, and anything more than that (if it's less than about ten) is too much? Hmm...makes you wonder.  I just finished watching the TTT EE Cast Commentary. I can't believe I haven't listened to it before now! It's very interesting throughout. Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and of course Dom and Billy were the best though. Sean Astin was a bit annoying, but that's nothing unusual.  Now I really need to go do some reading or writing. Or maybe I'll take a nap. Whatever :)        I AM 20% WHITE TRASH!

      Why is it that I only have dreams when I get just enough sleep? Never when I go for one of those 12-hour naps, and never when I don't get more than three hours. *sigh* Anyway, last night I dreamed that a bunch of people I didn't know, Eddie and I were all on the run, in Tiffany's car, because Eddie had seen a mob guy kill someone. This was a very strange dream, but pretty fun, because most of the time we were sitting around in this "safe house" ducking from windows. And then, of course, the alarm had to go off.  I am typing this when I should be fixing breakfast to get me through another day of band camp. Sarah, I will mail your Guns 'n' Roses CD tomorrow. Will that make you feel better?

      99 degrees Farenheit. Not a cloud in the sky. Marching. Trying to earn the respect of underclassmen while simultaneously earn the respect of a new band director. 'Nuff said.  I am tired. Plus, I am very very mad because they're showing 'The River Wild' on abc family instead of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?'. How dare they! So I have no excuse for not working on 'Portrait of a Lady'. Not to mention Calculus worksheets and BNW:R.  Band Camp at 8:00 AM again tomorrow. :( BUT I get to leave early! Yay! Except it's only to go to work. Boo.  I had trouble sleeping last night because I couldn't stop worrying about how much stuff I'm going to have to do for school this year. I've bitten off WAY more than I may be able to chew. This does not bode well for senior year! :'(

      There are few things in this world sexier than Antonio Banderas as Zorro. Unfortunately, the sequel isn't due out till sometime in 2005. Rats. I'll just have to content myself with reruns of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', which is a great show.  Today I painted a tree on the wall at BGS. It was quite fun, and I think it looks really good. Afterwards, Dad and I went to Lyons to see Grandma and Grandpa. Had a really good pecan praline parfait at DQ. Yum!  Other than the tree, I haven't accomplished anything all night. Alas, I should be reading Portrait of a Lady or BNW: Revisited. Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have something interesting to write about after band camp tomorrow.
