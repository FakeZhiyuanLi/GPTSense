      Ever since that pea-brained President George Bush declared the War in Iraq over, more Americans have lost their lives since. Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan will hopefully bring more attention towards all the sacrifices our soldiers make defending our country oversees. I can't even begin to believe that some senators are thinking of reinstating the draft. Let me see the Bush twins on the front lines first and then maybe they can start talking about a draft.   I realize that the UN weapons inspectors didn't find any "weapons of mass destruction" but couldn't they have narrowed the field down to ANY weapon of destruction? I mean what happened? It seems like every time I turn on the news there's more Americans dead because of car bombings and random shootings. I think any weapons should have been confiscated. This is what I imagine happening in Iraq:  Weapons Inspector: Do you have any weapons of mass destruction? Iraqi: Naw, just some surface to air missiles, rocket launchers and grenades. Weapons Inspector: Okay, okay, that's cool dog. Just as long as you ain't got any of that biological or nuclear shit. We don't want you hurtin' nobody.  I mean come on! Could it really be that difficult to have found other weapons? Grenades ain't cool. What the hell was the plan after we took Saddam out of power? That sumbitch is the only guy crazy enough to run that damn country! I say we send Omarosa from the Apprentice to rule that country...Crazy ass bitch.

      On Saturday I stopped by Jamba Juice on my way to Vicky's house. I had just finished volunteering for Christmas in April, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free home improvement for lower income families and other charities. I had spent half the day in the burning up in the front yard tilling the lawn into dirt that by the time I sauntered into Jamba Juice I was completely delirious.   As I was standing in line thinking about what to order I was thinking of how Vicky's brothers had told me that every time they went to Jamba Juice they would always give the cashier a made-up name so that when their order was called everyone would get a good chuckle. Some sample names they'd used were Mongolia, and Yoanus aka Yo anus. I thought for a second and decided that when the cashier asked for my name I would be Buck Naked.  When the cashier asked me for my name after I ordered I said Buck. I couldn't seriously bring myself to say Buck Naked but I thought Buck was good enough. The lady behind the register stared back at me with disbelief and repeated questioningly, "Buck?" I stared deceptively back at her and said without hesitation "Yes, Buck." with a tone as though I had been mildly offended.  I proceeded to sit down and wallow in my own guile as I waited for my pseudo-name to be called when all of a sudden I see "Jordan" one of the kid's from my kindergarten class walk in with his dad, Mr. Romero. I was excited to see them at first since being one of the few Filipino kids in class I give preferential treatment to, when I quickly realized that I was no longer Mr. Vince but Buck. Not to mention that I had come directly from the service project and my clothes and face were caked in sweat and dirt that I appeared to have just buried a dead body. I tried to squirm around and turn away before Jordan spotted me but his big round eyes quickly lit up and he shouted out "Mr.Vince!" I shot back a big smile and begrudgingly stood up and walked over to the pair. I have always been conscious that parents think I may be still a little young and immature when working with their children so I was proud that I had been able to fool most of them. All I could think about before I shook Mr. Romero's hand was what he would think when they called out the name Buck.  I made some small talk with Jordan and his Dad but all I could think about was what I was going to do once they called my name. I thought about ignoring it but I imagined the lady repeating "Buck" over and over again so I decided that as they called my name I would dash over, grab my drinks and vamoose. Mr. Romero was so impressed by my volunteer duties I was hoping it would keep him distracted. All of a sudden I hear the lady call out "Buck! Buck your drinks are ready!" I rapidly darted to the counter and picked up my drinks and Mr. Romero says to me "Is that yours?" and I respond "Yeah, Buck is my middle name." He looks back at me questioningly and says "All right Buck, see you on Monday!"  Today as I was talking to one of my coworkers in front of the school, Mr. Romero pulled up with Jordan. As soon as he saw me he waved to me and shouted with extreme excitement "Hey Buck!" My coworker looked at me puzzled and I said to her quietly "It's a long story."

      Warning! I am going to get dorkier than usual.  Over the weekend I saw The Punisher movie. I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed I was. The last couple of years have seen a lot of really amazing comic book movie adaptations such as Spider-Man, Hellboy and The Road to Perdition. There have also been a few movies that were completely disjointed and had no sense of direction. I'd much rather forget movies like the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Daredevil and even now The Punisher. Watching the movie was extremely painful for me because I am such a big fan of the comic book series and I had high expectations for a movie about him to do good. After the hapless butchering of his origin in the movie, leaving the theater that day made me think about what even attracted me to the character of Frank Castle aka The Punisher. After some really serious thought I realized that the Punisher is the most probable "anti-hero" in comics. Unlike other more traditional super-heroes, Frank Castle has no super powers or secret identity, he's simply a normal man fighting a war on crime. His only training came from the Marine Corp. and is also the first gun toting vigilante in modern comics. Where most heroes have a code against killing, the Punisher has no qualms about his goal to exterminate all criminals in his role as judge, jury and executioner.  I believe the biggest mistake the movie made was not incorporating Frank Castle's history in the Vietnam war. I realize that for movie purposes it was more self serving to make the story contemporary and not cast a fifty year old in the role but the actor who portrays Castle, Thomas Jane, is a little too young and handsome to be the The Punisher. The comic book Castle was a Vietnam veteran who voluntarily agreed to three tours of duty in Vietnam. He couldn't get enough of it. He may not have been the Punisher yet, but he was certainly a combat junkie. He was one of these guys who gets into the military, gets into the more action-packed Special Forces end of things and probably never felt so alive. Through the war he finally realizes what he was put on earth to do and that was to kill. The only other thing he was good at besides being a soldier was being a husband and a father. In the comics, when he comes back to New York he witnesses the slaying of his family in Central Park my mobsters. For Castle the only logical option in his mind is to declare war on his enemies, effectively becoming the Punisher.   The Punisher doesn't do what he does to make the world a better place. He does it because he hates who he kills. He doesn't hide behind a mask because he has nothing left to lose. The movie was onlysuccessfull in piecing together a few haphazard scenes and characters pulled directly from the comics. However for all the cool scenes what the movie ultimately lacked was giving us an emotional reason why we should support a killer.  The Punisher movie: C  Instead of the movie READ The Best Punisher Comics EVER:  Punisher: The End by Garth Ennis and Brian Azzarello "Welcome Back, Frank" Punisher (Vol.3) #1-12 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe by Garth Ennis and Doug Braithwaite Born Mini-Series #1-4 by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson Punisher War Zone #1-6 by Chuck Dixon and John Romita Jr.

      Crap...Here I am in front of the Goddamn idiot machine wasting my precious sleep time to blog. Accidentally deleted everything I had so now this waste of time will truly be a work in progress. I haven't been blogging lately not because I had nothing to write about but because there was so much shit going on I didn't even know where to start. Things actually haven't been too bad. Honestly things have been pretty fucking terrific! I actually won 8 bucks in the lottery last night. My main problem was that I usually blog when I come home or during the week when I have time. Lately I haven't been back home for more than just a few hours at a time for the last three weeks and I wasn't going to go out of my way to blog about some fantastic dump I had either. Oh man I'm whiney!  Regardless, expect a slow and incoherent slew of posts over the next few weeks.

      Have you ever shown up at McDonald's at 10:31 am and I just felt like punching someone in the face? I know I have.   There was a time not to long ago that I would wake up in the morning and the only thing that would make the world go right was by eating a Sausage McMuffin with egg at McDonald's. I'd arrive a minute past 10:30 and I'd try to order a Sausage McMuffin with Egg and the person behind the counter would say "Sorry sir, breakfast is over. It's lunch now." I just wanted to reach over and grab him by the collar and say "Fuck you man, you don't know ME! I'm Vince Vasquez! How the hell do you know breakfast is over, because I just fucking woke up?!" I swear to God McDonald's could increase their sagging revenue if they offered their breakfast all day long. Greedy assholes telling me when breakfast is over. For me breakfast is NEVER over because I sleep all the time. I take a nap in the middle of the afternoon, I wake up, I want my motherfuckin' breakfast! I swear when I gave up eating McDonald's it was like trying to quit taking drugs. There were serious withdrawal symptoms. Everywhere I looked it was like McGriddle? There'd be times when I would have sold my right nut for a McGriddle. I've never been on drugs but I bet what I went through was harder than that.  I think it was my Dad who got me hooked to McDonald's breakfast when I was a kid. Whenever he was the one who had to drop me off at school we would always leave my house at the butt crack of dawn and I'd arrive an hour early to school. To kill some time he would take me to eat at the Golden Arches. He might as well have gotten me hooked on crack cocaine back when because he started me on a life-long addiction to their breakfast that I just recently kicked. There's just so many options for breakfast there. Unless you order the big breakfast or hotcakes you don't even need utensils. Everything is in sandwich form. I'm Filipino so I love eating with my hands. There's the Sausage McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, Breakfast burrito, hash browns, the Steak and Egg Bagel, Ham and Cheese Bagel and the new kid on the block McGriddle.  Still, even though I shy away from McDonald's nowadays I still love me some breakfast.

      On the drive back from San Diego me and the Milk were talking about TGIF. Not the restaurants but the block of programming that used to be on ABC Friday nights. I remember I was amazed that the show Just the Ten of Us was a spin-off of Growing Pains. Well last night I was thinking about it and wasn't Family Matters a spin-off of Perfect Strangers? I think I remember them being tied together somehow but I forgot how.  Speaking of Family Matters, didn't the show start off with the Winslow's having three kids, Laura, Eddie and Judy? Shit, I don't even remember if the youngest daughter's name was Judy or Trudy. It could be Tootie for all I know. I do remember her name being in the opening credits in the first couple of seasons and then one year she just vanished from the show entirely with no explanation or anything of where she went or what happened to her! I mean for God's sake, wasn't Carl a cop!? Couldn't he have gotten the people on the force together to help him find his missing daughter? I would think a cop of all people would have taken some initiative to find out what the hell happened to his missing daughter! The Winslow's never even locked their  front or back doors because in every episode that idiot Urkel would come waltzing through. They practically invited her to get kidnapped. She just went up to her room one day and never came down.  Maybe Carl killed her. Or better yet, maybe Urkel killed her. Or maybe it was that shady motherfucker Waldo. He was one dumb motherfucker. Either way they had way too many perverts coming in and out of that house.

      As far as&nbsp;comic book conventions go, I didn't really spend that much time looking for comics at the San Diego Comic-Con this past weekend. I primarily spent most of my time either on my feet waiting in line or sitting on my ass waiting in line. But man, whether I was on my feet or on y ass it was totally worth it.   Even though I didn't find everything I was looking for, Comic-Con was absolutely amazing! Despite all the lines, crowds and waiting the entire weekend was well worth&nbsp;driving 8 hours back and forth. Not only did I get to meet some all time comic greats like Frank Cho, Jim Lee and Stan Lee but I got to meet Lou Ferrigno, Keanu Reeves, Jude Law and part of the cast of Smallville. I never thought I'd be such a geek around celebrities but I turned into a quivering pile of&nbsp;dung when it came down to it. I almost crapped my pants when I met Hal Sparks of I Love the (Fill in your decade)'s came meandering through the convention center. It's not like I'm even his biggest fan but just seeing someone I'm so used to seeing on TV was entirely surreal. Who wants to go next year?

      I think the best teachers are the teachers that dedicate their whole life to their work.&nbsp; The only time I think about work is Monday morning 15 minutes before class.  &nbsp;  I was hoping that after hiking over 16 miles this past weekend, I could just waltz&nbsp;into work Monday morning without a lesson plan and everything would kind of&nbsp;work itself out. Turns out that when I arrived&nbsp;at work today&nbsp;I'm asked to substitute the Elementary class because the&nbsp;regular teacher called in sick. Of course I say " No problem" when I'm actually thinking "Oh shit." I'd given some thought to calling in sick too.&nbsp;I decided&nbsp;against it&nbsp;though because I'm already taking Thursday and Friday off for Comic-Con.&nbsp;Man, I&nbsp;should have called in.  &nbsp;  I was so totally unprepared. Not only did I not have a lesson plan for my kids but the Elementary lesson plan actually required me to think. The only thing I wanted to think about was how soon I was going to go home. When I normally only have to basically kick back with&nbsp;6 kindergarteners for half a day I had to teach 19 1st-3rd Graders the whole day.  &nbsp;  I never realized how structured and rigid I lead a class. I always thought I was "cool and chill" Mr.Vince when it's more like Dictator Master Supreme Grand Wizard Mr. Vasquez. I think the reason I try to be strict is because I'm secretly unorganized, and by being stringent I'm able&nbsp;to cover&nbsp;up my lack of prep.&nbsp;I've got some ways to go to smooth out my teaching style but I don't think I'll ever be able to give it my all until after San Diego...and Half Dome.   My theory: All those teachers you remember that were good and nice, they had no life. All those teachers who were mean and gave out lots of work were extreme&nbsp;party animals.

      One more week till San Diego. I'm&nbsp;about to&nbsp;wet my pants in anticipation I'm so excited. People ask me why I'm so excited to go to a comic book convention.&nbsp;It's not just&nbsp;because I'm going to buy lots of comics and toys or anything. Sure, I'll be keeping my eye out for Action comics #775 but I'm going to be more&nbsp;excited meeting it's creators.&nbsp;I want to discuss the rivalry between DC and Marvel Comics. I want to take a picture next to a Klingon. To sum it all up, I'm ready to embrace my dorkiness.  &nbsp;  For me it's almost like I'm making a religious&nbsp;pilgrimage. Kind of like the way people&nbsp;will travel to Mecca or visit the West Wall, I'm embarking on spiritual&nbsp; journey of self discovery. Basically, the mothership is calling and I'm going home.  &nbsp;  I'm about to make a liquid explosion all over myself,&nbsp;I can't wait.

      Normally whenever the Philippines is in the news it's because there was an earthquake, a volcano or another rigged election. Finally something to celebrate.  Today the Philippines began pulling its troops out of Iraq, a move probably being made to satisfy demands by kidnappers of Filipino hostage Angelo de la Cruz. As of today (Wednesday), the number of Philippine humanitarian troops is down from 51 to 43. Eight of the 51 troops in Iraq have already left the country. His abductors had threatened to behead de la Cruz if the Philippines did not withdraw its forces from Iraq.  The United States protested the action, saying giving in to terrorist demands should not be an option.   Well you know what I say to you George Bush...FUCK YOU! Why the hell the Philippines even sent troops to Iraq is beyond me. I think they've got more than enough problems to go ahead and fight other people's wars. What difference can 51 troops make? They might as well have sent over a barrel of monkeys.

       urlLink    Published in the 1950's, "Two-Fisted Tales" is considered to be one of the best war (some even say anti-war) pulp comic in history. Two-Fisted tales were very gritty and realistic; many of the creators were once soldiers themselves and the editors were sticklers for accuracy. Many of the stories were touted as "He-Man Adventures" but on the contrary, the magazine was a brutally honest look at battles and wars throughout history.

      Poor defenseless clams. I spent the better part of yesterday slaughtering mother nature as I went clam digging with Vicky and my cousins. Stupid clams are just totally powerless. They must be on the fucking end of the food chain. They're almost like vegetables because like potatoes you have to dig the sons of bitvhes out of the ground. I was pretty surprised that there were still clams out there  because they are so weak. The only defense they have is their shell but that doesn't stop you from picking them up and boiling the fuckers to death. I don't even know if clams can move, or even swim. All I know is there was a butt load of them buried in the ground at some beach in Sacramento and that they taste damn good simmered with a little white wine and garlic.  I know...a beach in Sacramento. Who knew there was even running water in Sacramento? I didn't.  Clamming really isn't the most glamorous way to spend your fourth of July. Whereas most people probably relax at home, eating some barbecue, watch a couple of fireworks me and Vicky were on our hands in knees digging in the mud scavenging for food like a couple of cavemen. I swear from time to time I'd look up and it felt like we were in the Mekong delta rather than the California delta.

      I expected that in Michael Moore's new documentary entitled Farenheit 9/11, would have shown footage from the day when the planes struck the World Trade Center. In the movie you never see any plane stricke the twin towers. What Moore does show however is the people's reactions on their faces as they witness the horror in front of them. As this scene played out in the film I reached over and held Vicky's leg and I could feel goosebumps.   I cried during that scene. Tears were going down my face and I could feel myself getting choked up at least three other times during the movie. I could feel the hurt and anguish in those peoples eyes as they watched the towers burn. What really got to me was realizing that what happened was real life for those people and even though it's some three years later we lived through that ordeal and are still feeling it's effects.  I would recommend anyone to see Farenheit 9/11. And oh yeah...FUCK GEORGE BUSH!

      I think I'm getting too buff.  I noticed that in the past month my shirts have been fitting a little tighter. I reason this is likely due to the increased size of my muscles. The odd thing however is my pants are getting a little tighter too. I figure my waist is getting buffer too. I'd better cut back on the workouts...don't want to overdo it, if you know what I mean.

      We're a little short handed at work so my director asked me to come in an hour early to work for the rest of the week. I was supposed to be at work at 7 o'clock today. I woke up at 7:15.  Right when I realized I was late I practically flew out of my bed and went right out the front door. On my way out I was putting on my pants, socks, undershirt all at the same time. I was like the tasmanian devil, a little brown whirlwind whipping through Vicky's house at 7:15 in the morning. By the time I got out to the car I realized I didn't even have a shirt on. I figured I'd better get to work as soon as possible because there might be kids waiting for me. I just put on a dirty fleece I had on in the car and said to myself," My director's off this week so no one will even care or notice."  So today, off all the days in summer school, our Region Manager comes to pay a visit. A region manager that already doesn't like me much. Here I am, haven't showered, dirty clothes, I didn't even brush my teeth and I smell. I might as well have had a homeless guy teaching my kindergarten class.  Thankfully I only work half day because I don't know if I could have completely avoided the office all day long. I'd walk the kids the long way around school so we didn't have to pass by any other classes. The kids did surprisingly well today despite the fact that their teacher looked like a bum. Matter of fact, I don't think any of the kids in my class shower anyway.

      I bought a new bike! No...not a motorcycle, I'm not cool enough for that. A mountain bike, an '04 Specialized FSR XC Full Suspension to be exact. However, for the amount of money I paid for that bike it should be a motorcycle. Matter of fact it should be encrusted diamonds. But alas, money ain't a thing...when you put it on credit.  I took my Blue Beauty out to Joaquin Miller Park in the Oakland Hills yesterday and it felt so good to be on top of such a well oiled piece of machinery. It was absolutely exhilarating having that power between my thighs. My last Specialized bike was stolen from my garage a year and a half ago and it hasn't been the same peddling around in my Dad's hardtail Diamondback. Bombing down a narrow singletrack downhill , adrenaline pumping through my veins a song suddenly popped into my head. And like a dorkus malorkus I started singing it to myself...  Get your motor runnin' Head out on the highway Lookin' for adventure And whatever comes our way Yeah darlin' go make it happen Take the world in a love embrace Fire all of your guns at once And explode into space  Born to be wild Born to be w-  And then I fell hard, landing roughly on my side, my bike careening off the trail. Man, did it feel good. Thank God no one was around to see or hear me.
