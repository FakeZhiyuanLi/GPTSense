      What a beautiful movie. It was so beautiful, I bought the soundtrack years ago, and I still listen through the whole thing at least once a week. The way it was filmed, together with the music made it a wonderful movie.  One of the best movies ever.  Seven gold coins out of seven gold coins.  ____________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000

      I shall explain this in the fewest words possible:  Episodes 4, 5, and 6 are cool.  Episodes 1 and 2 are cool.  Jar Jar Binks - Why don't you love him? Annoy you, I can see that. But hate.... You illogical fools!  Hope the third one is cool.  I give the... uh...... five of them five and a half gold coins out of seven gold coins.  ___________________________________________________________________  00000½ out of 0000000

      Both of these movies where beautiful. But something was different about them. It was filmed differently then other movies are filmed. All the shots felt alittle to... uh... "free flowing." I know that doesn't explain much, but "hey".  I'm not saying it was baddly shot, I'm just saying it is different.  ...I'm thinking, "trailer-spot for a 'made for tv' movie." That sounds better then "free flowing." Is sounds weird, but thats just the way it is.  Other then that, this was another beautiful movie. I love Marvel and how they have now made movies to go along with the beautiful comics.  Stan Lee....  >... Woooooooooooo!  I give it six and ahalf gold coins out of seven gold coins.  __________________________________________________________________  000000½ out of 0000000

      Again.... Here we hit another beautiful movie. I think I cried abit at the parts of the film where Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, or at least the CGI Spider-Man) is swinging between buildings (at the very end of the movie). That was a fantastic piece of amagination(/eye) candy.  Serious.... on this movie.... I have a loss of words. It was just beautiful.  Seven gold coins out of seven gold coins.  ____________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000

      GREAT!  It was all beautiful, man.  Every frame was a work of art.  All the actors were legendary.  I'm for a lack of words....At "Return of the King" I cried! I never cry! well.... Thats a lie. I only cry when something that beautiful and breath-taking happens.   I cried during the part of the movie where all the torches light ablaze on the mountains and hilltops. That was beautiful.  I give the trilogy seven gold coins out of seven gold coins. Again... The highest rating. __________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000

      This was one of the greatest movies of all time. It had all of the elements of a great movie: romance; comedy; action; adventure; and last but not least, drama. It not only lit up the screen, but it brought my imagination above and beyond it's farthest limits.   First thing I did after I saw it, was build myself a awesome boat, sewed myself a leather pirate hat, and went-a-sailin'... ARrrrrr!  Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was the most beautiful proformance ever.  Everthing about it was unforgettable.  I give it seven gold coins out of seven gold coins!!!!  (I like the number seven.)  __________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000

       You know what my favourite tv shows are? They are Mutant X, Smallville, Enterprise,and That 70's show. Those are my top four. I like each and every one of them. Just thought I'd let you know. Victoria Pratt in Mutant X is a fox! So are Allison Mack and Kristin Kreuk from Smallville. WOOOOOOOooooooo doggy! (lol)

       Woooo! I just taught myself to play Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven." And I rock at it! My other specialties include Our Lady Peace's "Clumsy," Remy Zero's "Save Me," Janes Addiction's "Three Days," Jimmy Hendrix's "All Along the Watchtower," and Boston's "More than a Feeling."  I'm good!  I've been playing alot of pinball on my computer. Its a awesome game. One day I'm going to get a real pinball machine. I used to have two arcade machines. On was about a spaceship shooting aliens (NOT space invaders, this was a side-scrolling game.) and I forget what the other one was. It was awhile ago. They were sure old machines. Yea, Arcade machines rock! Especially when they are fixed so they're always free, lol.  Well, I have to go eat. So until tomorrow.... Chao! (Is that how you spell it? lol!)

       Well, I just spend today watching movies. I watched "Enough" and "Showtime." I know both of those movies are not the most interesting movies, but hey! Whatever.  They served their purpose. I just had them on for backround sound. Because whenever I have boring movies on, I sit down on the floor and work with metal.  I have dozens of huge reels of electric fence wire that I've been cutting into two inch (something like that) strips. After I cut them, I spend a entire day bending them into rings. And after bending them, I hook them together to make chain armor, like the stuff off Lord of the Rings. In about 2 days I can make 1000 rings. Its hard work. A chain tunic is my first large chain project. I usually work with sheet metal to make plate armor. I find that plate armor and fish-scale armor are the easiest things to make.  And other than that, I make other odd objects. I'm quite the inventor. Some of the other things I've made have been.... Oh! nevermind. Its a hush-hush operation, lol.  And now, after all that blister inducing labour, I'm just sitting infront of this computer. Maybe I'll play some "Alien vs Predator 2." __________________________________________________________________  I missed the finale show of Frasier! I can't believe it! Oh well. Instead I watched CSI. and after that I watched E.R. The latter is pretty cool. I never used to watch it, but now I like it for some reason.  Even though I missed the last Frasier, I'm lucky I didn't miss the last Friends. I'm glad I caught it, But frankly, it was a fairly boring farewell. I didn't get too much out of it... maybe its just me.  You know what is another awesome show - the O.C.  That show is awesome. I heard they might do a spin-off about seth and his "boating trip," lol. If thats true, thats hilarious. Adam Brody (seth cohen) is funny. I laughed straight for at least 2 minutes when we found out that his toy horse's (on the show) name is "Captain Oats." __________________________________________________________________   Well, thats it for today. Bye!

       Hello,  My name is George and I have just created my first blog. On this blog I will talk about everything imaginable. I am extremely eccentric, so I will probably rant on about random things such as aliens, government, music, movies and whatever else catches my fancy.  Actually, I like to stress my eccentricitys to people. I find that if they can take me, I can enjoy the company a whole lot better.  I just moved to the center of Canada, the city of Brandon. Its pretty nice. Its no Vancover, but it will do. I used to live in the country, so its been a great change, now I have more things to do. I'm going to enjoy going to the mall and the Sportsplex. Maybe I'll even get some paintballing in there.  As I'm writing this I'm listening to "Janes Addiction" (Three days & Just Because). Of course in acouple of minutes I'll be listening to some oldschool rock (Boston), and alittle bit more newschool (LifeHouse, Matthew Good).   I love music. I couldn't do without my music. Frankly, its what my entire life is based around. That and movies. I enjoy a good movie. I find that it is a great boost for the imagination.  Oh! Lifehouse's "Take Me Away" just started to play. I love that song. I think it is one of my favorite songs ever. It has the best sound I've ever heard. I could sing alot with it for hours. Seriously!  Oh! Matthew Good's "Weapon" just started to play.  Well, I think thats it for the day.  Thanks for checking in.
