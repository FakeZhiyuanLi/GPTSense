       Main Entry: vin·di·cate  urlLink  Pronunciation: 'vin-d&-"kAtFunction: transitive verbInflected Form(s): -cat·ed; -cat·ingEtymology: Latin vindicatus, past participle of vindicare to lay claim to, avenge, from vindic-, vindex claimant, avenger1 obsolete : to set free :  urlLink DELIVER 2 :  urlLink AVENGE 3 a : to free from allegation or blame b (1) :  urlLink CONFIRM ,  urlLink SUBSTANTIATE  (2) : to provide justification or defense for :  urlLink JUSTIFY  c : to protect from attack or encroachment :  urlLink DEFEND 4 : to maintain a right tosynonym see  urlLink EXCULPATE ,  urlLink MAINTAIN - vin·di·ca·tor  urlLink  /-"kA-t&r/ noun    I'm in an unbelievably good mood. I'm so happy, yet I have no reason to be. Everything in my life is falling down and I'm just sitting here, watching it fall, and smiling, because I'm numb. Whatever. Saturday we're supposedly going to CR.  That should be exciting, hopefully I get to hang out with Curtis but I highly doubt that. The percentage is probably sitting at about .4   "I wonder where you are, please don't come around tonight 'cuz I can't stand to see you and I don't want to fight. Give me one more drink and I swear I think I'll be ready to make the same mistakes again, with you. I finally figured out that you're not coming back, I'm not going anywhere." -Effing AWESOME band. I found it whilest searching for a song that wasn't by them..but was by Dashboard Confessional.   Everything is so good. Everything is so happy..being happy is so much easier then being sad. I love it. It's good. You're all such sweethearts :-P lol  "I want to be what you've always needed. I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste. I want you and your beautiful soul"    Yeah. I'm thinking about burning a CD. Cd's are good. Curtis is also good. I'd like to let everyone know that. Especially you mr curtis, you have the ability to make everything seem okay again. And when I'm really really bitchy, and you're saying nice things..and I say Whatever, whatever. And you think I'm not listening, and you think you're not helping. You are, im not even really..that upset anymore. I just..am too stuborn to admit it. And if I really hated you as much as I said I did all those times, I would have left.      I've concluded numerous amounts of things in the past couple days. My writing has gone downhill a horrible amount. I need to start writing again.  I also concluded that everything in the world doesn't need to be a contest, but with me, it is. Which is sad, and needs to change.  So yes.  On a lighter note; (Ohh...it's a pun)  I lost 7 pounds. Because I'm cool. You guys all said, "Your diet wont work." Well it worked. You lose. :) I definitely win.   That is all.

         phosphorescence 1 : luminescence that is caused by the absorption of radiation at one wavelengthfollowed by delayed reradiation at a different wavelength and that continues fora noticeable time after the incident radiation stops -- compare FLUORESCENCE 2 : an enduring luminescence without sensible heat       Last night..Brandon and Christian came over and we watched a movie..then...  We swam in the ocean..the ocean full of stars.....The boys came :) The boys are nice. The boys make me laugh with their theme song music and their duets. They're either really, really good at being players, and really badly need to get laid, or they're really,  really  nice guys.  But either way is fine..because if they're nice guys...good, we got ourselves some more decent friends. And otherwise is just what I assumed the whole time.   I decided we need a car. Cars are good, so are trucks. They make me smile. It's good to be able to say, "Hey, let's go to the beach." at 2 in the morning and then make it happen. Or be cravin McDonalds Apple Juice. **I thank you guys for that, SO MUCH by the way**  I hope you guys had a safe trip home..not smoking weed, talking on the cell phone, and taking turns holding the steering wheel.  I loved swimming in thee ocean. It was really warm. I really  wanted the boys to come swim with us. But they would not swim. Sad, sad stuff. I hope those boys care as much as they seemed to, and I really hope they come back..er..yeah.   The Hornby Trip was grreat. I had so much fun. And there were no boys or alchohol involved. Proud? That's what I thought.  Stephy and I ruined our "Liquor-priviledge" on the first day because the parents did not make it clear how much of the drink we were allowed to sample. Silly parents. While at hornby..we..ate a lot of popsicles, drank a lot of 'bottled beverages' and washed our faces A LOT. We got really tanned. I love being tanned.  Curtis is dissapointed in me because I'm stupid. That makes my heart cry. It also makes my heart feel really..really sorry.

So that when I'm not really talking, and I'm sitting there, and saying "K" and "haha" and "Mhm.." It's not because I'm a bitch, and it's not because I'm busy. It's because I'm sitting there, and thinking wow, and I so badly want to say ( in some cases type) more, and have a conversation with you but it's like I don't have the energy. I don't see the point. If I have a big conversation with you it's not going to change the fact that all I can think about is how bad I want to be..Yup. It has a lot to do with the fact that I'm EXTREMELY stuborn as well so when I start being a bitch and ignoring you and you say i'm being a bitch and ignoring you and I deny it, I cant go back and say sorry, cuz I'm a bitch.... Anyways. Yes. So I'd like to appologize to all of you who've called me/talked to me on msn and I've been a stupid annoying stinker. :) That is all. I've now completely vented and I'm readddy to talk fully to you in full..converstaion mode.

      I'm sort of done breaking down. Now I'm just crying. Crying because of reasons. Do you ever have one of those nights where all you want is to sleep on the floor? This is my floor sleeping night. I've decided maybe I should stop telling everyone else they've changed and focus on the fact that I've changed...But maybe I haven't..maybe i'm just..I don't know. I'm so sorry to all of you, especially Shayne, for being so stupid and so immature and so hypocritical. I've become everything that I hate and I've treated you all like you're less than I am...I hate this whole week, and this whole day, and this whole hour and minute and second and everything I am now. I miss Ryan more than anyone could ever EVER imagine and I need him to come back now... I also miss Cody. Maybe I just miss having someone to talk to that doesn't fuck me over and we can have a long 6 hour phone conversation without being assholes to eachother. Ugh. I'm done.

One of those days where I'm completely done and then I piss someone off, and then I feel so bad for pissing him..er..that person off that I completely break down because I'm too stupid and stuborn to say sorry even though I know I'm wrong and then it ends up ruining our friendship. Or lack of. Anyways. Yes. Completely done. Everything is falling down, once again. But I'm sure I'll be okay tomorrow. Yes...tomorrow. Although...the quote   "Smile, tomorrow will be worse."   is probably going to come true.   Anyways yeah...I'm stupid..and i'm a bitch. And it appears i have begun to care about someone who I shouldn't. Becuase you know, there's definitly rules. Whatever. That's all. I only wrote this becuase I said I would write every day.  Buhbye.

I mean, come on. Perk yourselves up, it's summer! There is absolutly  nothing  that I hate more than when peoples names on msn are ":'( I'm so sad." "Oh, I'm going to kill myself" and then you say "How are you? " or, "What's wrong?" and people respond with "I'm depressed, I'm sad. Blah-de-blah-blah" and then you say "Aww..what happened?" or "Why?" and they say "I don't want to talk about it." If you don't want to talk about it, keep it to yourself you stupid un-educated fools. If you have no intention on telling anyone about your problem, you obviously don't want/need help, therefore, putting it in your name is a pathetic cry for attention. And I'm sick of everyone saying "I'm going to kill myself because my girlfriend/boyfriend broke up with me." Killing yourself has to be the most selfish thing in the world. I mean, yes. Go, shoot yourself in the brain. Or even better, why don't you hang yourself in the bathroom? Yeah. That would be good. Becuase you know, your parents will find you, and just call the cleaning company and get your body removed, and all the blood scrubbed from the tile floor. Sorry, no. Cleaning companies don't do bodies, nor do they do blood. Your parents will be cleaning up your stupid dirty mistakes, all because you were too much of a dumbass to deal with them yourselves.    Wow..that's horrible. Forget everything I just said. I usually have so much..compassion. I just needed to get that out. But now I'm done. I love you all, you all mean so much to me. If you need to talk, if you're sad or depressed, TALK. Just dont say you're depressed and not talk. That really drives me closer.     Anyways, enough about this. Jonathong came back from England today. YAY FOR JONATHONG. You will now all notice a signifigant decrease in the amount that I talk to you.  With the exception of Curtis, (Of course, because he is GO[o]D[e][s][t].)      Tonight..I went swimming with Brandon, Stephy and Demetri. It was exciting..Stephy and I formulated a new plan..under the matress in the water. We also talked about Curtis. Swimming was good. I enjoyed it. A girl called us fat..or maybe she didn't call us fat, but she was talking with all her friends, and I heard the word fat. So I assumed it was about me. Because I always assume It's about me. You know..if I was like..400 Pounds. I wonder how I would survive? I also wonder how I'm going to survive when I'm actually in LOVE with a guy and he breaks up with me? Ha that should be great. But enough about that.    CURTIS, this paragraph is for you. Do you know why? Because you're the only person who ever reads my blogs AND I can hear you making sounds on microphone right now...sounds that make me smile. Curtis is my friend. Curtis your voice makes me happy. As do you. You're my friend Curtis. You also make my heart smile. I'm way too tired to be typing this. And I hope hope hope that you call me in the middle of the night..oh how I would adore that. But I know you won't, my friend Curtis. So I'm definitly not going to get over excited.  I definitly had to emphasize the 'friend' thing. Anyways. Yes...    That is all...Too tired to type more. Hope you enjoyed!

I hate the way you drive my car,     I hate it when you stare.     I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind.     I hate you so much it makes me sick,it even makes me rhyme.     I hate the way you’re always right, I hate it when you lie.     I hate it when you make me laugh,     even worse when you make me cry.      I hate it when you’re not around,     and the fact that you didn’t call.     But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you,     not even close…not even a little bit…not even at all.          I don't care anymore if I let you down     I believe that I need to be free     I'm so used to my life with you around     I don't know anymore . . . . the real me     And I thought that I found myself todayAnd I thought that I had control     All the change in my life just fell away     For a moment I didn't need you     All these tears that I've cried     You must be tired of taking care of me but     Its what you do best and I'm a liar cause really its what I need     Someone like you     Someone like me     Maybe its change that set you free     Free . . .             I would have done anything for you,       I would have died for you,       I loved you with all my heart,       I looked past all your flaws,       I made you my life,       And now I have to let you go.

It's so simple, and it's probably one of the first words all of you learnt; along with yes, it is taught at a very early age. Yet some of you, still don't seem to comprehend the meaning of the word. When you ask to see my boobs, and I respond with 'no', that is your cue to piss off and stop asking.   Curtis, I'm sorry, but that's a very VERY 'soft spot' and you need to stop..please. If you find humor in it, find humor in it outside of the time you're talking to me, please. I 'love you as a friend' buddy. Please stop being angered. I'm sorry for saying a bad word to you. I take back the evil.  I'm    so sorry   . Anyways. Yes. Curtis is my new 'boyfriend' ;) He makes my heart skip a beat. Ohhh yes...hahaha    "It's down to this, I've got to make this life make sense. I missed the life, I miss the colors of the world. Now again I found myself, so far down, away from the sun that shines. Into the darkest place, I'm so far down, away from the sun again."     Tonight...I'm hanging out with Brandon and Stephy.  We were  going  to go to the movies. I have no money, however, so we're going to do something free. Something free like....Standing on the side of the road..watching cars go by. Or maybe.. walking aimlesly around town. Or maybe even eating grass? Realistically though, we're probably just going to go to Stephy's house and watch movies.  Onto another note. I'm very proud of Stephy and I.  We're doing very good with the whole 'friendship' thing.  Everything is slowly, ( very very slowly ), coming back together. Everything is falling into place and I can't help but be happy!  I had to wake up at 8 today..and then I went for a walk after my mom left for work and I was back at home by 8:30. At 8:30 I went back to sleep and I ended up sleeping until 2:00. I feel so ...'yick' I'm happy Stephy called me because I would have slept forever.    That is all for now my friends;

But that's okay. Why is it okay? Because Curtis is DEFINITELY GO[o]D[e][r]. Yeah, you see that, that's a pun. Curtis is worthy of a pun. GO[o]D[e][r] Than anyone else. Curtis, you rock my world. Almost as much as Ac/Dc Rocks my world.           Onto another note.

      I have decided to put a word, and a definition at the beginning of each new post...for the benefit of all of you. You can learn some new words; Sabbat.   Etymology: French, literally, sabbath, from Latin sabbatum: a midnight assembly of diabolists (as witches and sorcerers) held especially in medieval and Renaissance times to renew allegiance to the devil through mystic rites and orgies.   Now. Firstly, I would like to express my..emotions towards Brandon. Our friendship is currently on hiatus.    Main Entry: hi·a·tus  urlLink  Pronunciation: hI-'A-t&sFunction: nounEtymology: Latin, from hiare to yawn -- more at  urlLink YAWN 1 a : a break in or as if in a material object :  urlLink GAP   Colton> b : a gap or passage in an anatomical part or organ2 a : an interruption in time or continuity :  urlLink BREAK  b : the occurrence of two vowel sounds without pause or intervening consonantal sound .  That is for you, my un-educated friends.  Brandon, is a boy. Brandon is a boy who says I'm annoying. And that, is totally and completely understood.  HOWEVER,  I do not appreciate him saying "I don't like how you are. I wish you were different" and not having any suggestions as to how I could improve myself. Because you know, my main goal in life is making Brandon happy. I will be  God's second hand man.- Curtass   I miss Jonathong. I also miss Spencer. One of you better come home soon...  Also..  I'm sick of everyone thinking Stephy and I are whores. Although it's not so much thinking we're whores..as it is that 'whore' is the only word that their uneducated minds could come up with to describe the fact that we aren't the same.  Whore:  1 : a woman who engages in sexual acts for money : PROSTITUTE; also : a promiscuous or immoral woman 2 : a male who engages in sexual acts for money : avenal or unscrupulous person    People really shouldn't be so judgmental, and if they are to judge us they should really know the definition of the words they are using. I wasn't aware that I engaged in sexual acts for money, nor was I aware that I wasn't a virgin.  I'm sick of everyone assuming things about me, and Stephanie, and more so our friendship. I am not a bad influence on her, nor is she one on me. In truth, none of you even take the time to get to know us. Why cant you even try to get to know us? Is it that difficult for you?   You hate us because we are different. Would you like it better if we changed the way we are and were the same as all of you? Everyone always has a problem with the way we are, because we are different, they refuse to let us in on what they would like us to be, if you don't like the way we are maybe you should make yourself damn clear on how you want us to be, before you start trying to mold us, you stupid ignorant bastards.   You all completely contradict yourselves, always. Every one of you always put in your stupid profiles that you "respect individuals, and people who strive to be different," Bullshit you do. /You say that becuase it's a fad. Same with your whole "I am bi-sexual" Bullshit you are. You tell us you are in an attempt to be accepted and 'popular' but that's a whole other story isn't it? Stop trying to change who we are. This is us. If you don't like it maybe you should go and find some new friends. I don't need any of you to tell me how to be, I am happy being who I am. I do not need any of you; maybe you should all re-think your opinions and your judgmental views. Stop looking to other to please you, and relying on other to make your life okay and complete. With such high standards, you will never be complete and you will never be okay; I can assure you that one day you will realize that everyone is different. I can assure you that when your life catches up to you, no one will respect you, they will reject you, just like you did us. You will have spent all your Highschool years trying to conform to what you thought was "normal".    Highschool is only three years of your life. After Highschool is over, we'll be in University, driving our Porche, because we got out there and expressed our feelings and opinions, instead of conforming. And maybe I'll see you boarding the city transit system, on your way to your trailer trash life. Maybe you should start seeing through your own eyes, instead of everyone else's. In closing, stop being so ignorant, and selfish, because its going to get you nowhere, and really everything you don't like about us, is exactly what you are. You are selfish, and have no regards anyone else. You are opinionated, and more so stupid. We are just as good, if not better than EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.  Thank you.  Also, I still love Stephanie:) She isn't hated yet. Curtis..you aren't hated either, as with you dylan..and garrett, you not either. also....hmm..spencer? and bruce. and maybe brian. But the rest of you. burn. burn hardcore.

       I am too tired to write..but I decided I would write every day..but I probably won't after the first week..but it's only the second day..Oh I am rambling...Oh well, bare with me. Today was extremely eventful and yet extremely...I don't know. We went to the parade. It was 2000 degrees and I thought I was going to die. My mom left us there becuase she couldn't find us at the park and got sick of looking..so Stephy and I had to wait outside my cousins car on the side of the road for numerous hours to see if she eventually got around to coming back to her car to give us a ride. Then we went to my Grandparents...We fell asleep for like an hour. Damnit. We broke the beautiful cycle of no sleep. It's o kay though, I don't blame myself. Anyone would have slept at the Grandparents house. It's just so damn comfy. Tonight..we went to the fireworks. It was interesting but wet and tooo many people. Being around large groups of people is not my friend. The Gramma promised me waffles for breakfast. Does she know how long I've been craving waffles? :D Ohh...waffles. I must go to bed now so the waffles will come sooner. LoL   *~Night-Night to Myself~*

      Last night..was..in one word...' Interesting.' First off, the beautiful sex talk with the beautiful parents of us. Parents who have, since the sex talk, decided to let us hornby it up by ourselves. Secondly, we got over the hump. Celebrate it. Stephanie peed her pants and threw up several times, while I puked in the beautiful blue ikea garbage can. We had a fight, actually..we had numerous fights. None of which are remembered by me now. We talked to Caleb all night..made plans for our photo shoot. Took some of our own photos. Hence the title. Elegantly...naked..photos... Masterpieces. Stayed up all night. Babysat...although..were too..'intoxicated' to watch the kid, heard it yell though..stuck a bottle in her mouth. I love that baby:) Finished with the night time..ate breakfast (china food) Also..talked to Curtis last night for a good and long time. Fantastically interesting stuff. Danced for people on webcam. Extremely exciting. Can't breathe. Forgot to take my pill again. Can't swallow..but maybe that's just our 'dry mouth' syndrome. Day..interesting...Night..more so. Going to the parade in a few hours. Should be interesting. Going to the fireworks tonight, should be..firey. That is all. Good day to all of you people who are bored enough to read this profile, I feel bad for you, truly truly sorry and truly truly disgraced.
