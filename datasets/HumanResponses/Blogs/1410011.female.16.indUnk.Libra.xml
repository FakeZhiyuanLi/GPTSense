      well today was so warm, me and my mom cleaned  and stuff. its starting...finally to really feel like spring and summer. i cannot wait for summer this year. fucking school is killin me. i have so much work to do between now and the end of the year its fucking nuts. anyway. i talked to a friend that i havent in a while--just started talking to them again and it feels so good to          re-connect. its hard to find friends who really count. a friend without jealousy. like--there are cliose friends of mine that i am jealous of, or just dont want anything better to happen to them. as bitchy as that sounds its true. but then there are those friends who i can be incredibly happy for whenever something wonderful happens to them. happier than if it had happened to me. and that is rare, and valuable. so im trying to hold onto friendships now as best i can, because losing them is just not worth it. not worth the world.

      I hate being sick more than anything in the world. this year has really been a terrible year for me in the health department. well actually in the everything department. academically,2003 has been a pretty good year. but i had that really bad stomach bug around new years and then of course i broke my arm...just not an all around good year. nothing spectacular or remotely exciting has happened, and we're already 5 monthes into the year. well i have 7 left for something good to happen-so if you are my prince charming or a winning lottery ticket, please come find me right now. and get rid of this damn headcold while you're at it.

      Break ups are never awkward for me. okay so i havent experienced a break up since september, but still. well i guess tim can count as a break up. i mean the second time anyway.so novemberish?  but back to what i was saying. break ups dont have to be as awfully awkward as everyone makes them. i mean... if its ended because some slut got ur man to hit on her or the slime ball did something to that affect to you, then i can understand the feeling of hate. but hate doesnt mean awkwardness. so you guys break up. the famous "lets just be friends" or "i dont want a boyfriend right now.."(which is not a lie in my case thank you very much KD!) those situations are only weird for you if you make them weird. even if you still care about the person, it doesnt have to be uncomfortable. breaking up is usually a good thing, because unlike the start of relationships... they usually are for good reasons. Getting over someone is another story. for me, personally....as sick bitched as this may sound...it usually takes another guy for me to get my mind off the last one. so yes...im a rebound user woman. and damn proud. but i dont like to toy with guys---because unlike breaking up...leading mean on can be extremely awkward. and im not trying to be insensitive... breaking up hurts. it really is a dagger through the heart sometimes. but make the relationship become comfortable, having it be uncomfortable will make it hurt worse right?

      how to lead a boy on:  1. Not telling him you dont like him. take the easy way out and let him figure out you dont.(boys wont figure it out)  2. when he talks to you while you're really busy, you take the time you dont have to talk, when usually you'd politely say "cant talk! gotta go!" with a sweet smiley. instead you end up talking about nothing so not to hurt his feelings.  3. flirting. this is a clear cut sign you to him that you want him to push it  4. Playful conversations--this usually includes sexual remarks. dont let that happen unless u really want the sexual things to happen.  5. Chillin with him alone. alone time with a boy that wants you never works out. no matter what. unless you are straight with him. then there's a chance. A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE. because dont forget, they all have a penis.  leading boys on is always the most awkward thing that can happen. dont let it... its just a big pain in the ass and you both feel bad after.

      BOYS! i am so done with them. the once "boy crazy" samantha is SO out of the pciture. so yes boys, that means you, look down, you with the penis. im through with you... i mean you're all pigs. think ofwhat you want to be doing right now. 93% of you are thinking sex, the other 7% are probably having sex or want to sleep. so whateverrr. this is not a bitter, ive been dumped girl inside me talking either. this is just an annoyed not getting any form anyone--also not wanting any from anything she sees bitter girl. so if you're hot and worth the shot then let me know. cuz right now all i see is big dumb jerks all around me.

      easter is a terrible holiday. the easter bunny is like shit compared to santa clause. all he does is bring calories and little shit in an ugly basket. and we have school tomorrow? this is bulllllllshit. the catholic community should be outraged by the lack of recognition and respect the rising of jesus recieves these days. his damned old ordinary birthday gets alot more praise then when the man rose up from death! now that is not ordinary. and this lack of time to reflect upon our savior disgusts me. school will interfere with that shit. now im goin to bed so i can wake up and be distracted from my time of reflection.

      man i miss hangin out with u guys a TON! that means you slal, 2 pump, frolie n BITCH! ahahah. but what i wanna vent about is OBNOXIOUS phonecalls. doesnt it bother you when people call you with other people screaming in the background. that is my biggest pet peeve. its the ultimate of annoying! especially when they're just being an ass and really have nothing to say anyway. so i got one of those just three minutes ago. so if you called me on a saturday night..with nothing to say...while people scremed in the background...YOU SUCK AT LIFE-if u sneezed i wouldnt even say god bless you!!!!!! anyway. beach house was mad fun, lucky for me--i didnt get walked in on while peeing, but hey slal...its bound to happen if you pee more than 45 times.. The beach is so beautiful. the ocean...everything... i wish i could live there. lucky bastards. well GOTTA GO SOAK MY FEET-- bad choice in footwear. my advice for you is do not wear plastic new flip flops to walk on six miles of rock. not a good idea.

VERY! but hey some people are gay n SUCK AT LIFE!  i wouldnt say god bless you if u sneezed!!!! beach house was mad fun. chillizin with slal, 2pump, frolie n BITCH...was a good time. i miss hanging out with old friends. so much has changed.....oh well mostley for the better. the beahc is BEAUTIFUL! i would give up sex for life to live there--(yeah im with ben on that one) well im gunna go soak my feet---poor choice in footwear--dont ever wear ur flip flops to walk on six miles of rock..

      We all have our faults right? some of us more than one...like me. but my biggest is that little thing called my height. funny thing happened today--- i went shopping with my mother and my sisters. how depressing...nothing fit right...either too big, too small(my favorite..yuck!) or my other favorite....too long. too long? TOO LONG?! like i havent heard or felt that before. GOD...i have one question for you? could it have killed you to give me just a few more inches? i mean jesus christ...being short does not have any advantages. everything was too long. capris? i cant wear capris...capris are pants to me, pants need to be hemmed into what would be capris on other people....but pants on me. shorts and skirts--not the problem. but the DAMN capris. so that'll put ya in a mood right? well not only do i have capri problems.. but i find the perfect dress...the one i want for my formal...and guess what? its supposed to be like right under the knee-ish....yet it's more like at ankle-length for me. lets hope this day of enduring my ongoing..never-ending "lack-of-height problems--ends better than it began. so tonight and tomorrow i'll be at alex's beach house.. hopefully it'll be fun. we'll see..

      so shopping always does the trick. as stereotypical of a valley girl that sounds, it really does make you go..ahh..afterwards. especially when you have a gift certificate. for some reason i think i have developed a disease.."spend and guilt" disease. self explanatory, but really i cant spend money without feeling like it could have gone somewhere else...somewhere better. like to a breast cancer society, or some shit like that. anyway.. gift certificate to gap..i thought would help with my disease. but no, call me a bargain hunter, or even dare to say cheap(genetic..got it from dad)..but nothing on my reciet was more than $6.99. i got a pair of flip flops, few shirts etc...only 30 bucks from a 25$ gift card. so only spending 5 bucks for six new outfits does feel good--i guess my disease comes in handy every now and then. we all have our own specific disease, some of us more than one...but talking about them makes it more fun--so what i learned today: dont hold back on diseases..they're a blessing in disguise. :) unless its like cancer or something. i wouldnt consider that a blessing.

      MY THOUGHTS ON FIGHTING: its an unsettling feeling. and some bitches do it for some sick pleasure. NOT ME! and i know that lily is like me, not those sick bitches. so its all good. i thoguht the fight with kopka was bad, it doesnt even compare to this one.all i have to say is THANK GOD its over. and im lucky to have friends like myself who want to clear things up more than they want to mess things up.  THOUGHTS ON FRIENDSHIP: my friends mean the world to me, they give more joy than anybody else. family is my rock, but friends are all my fun. you guys show me how to have fun, and i love you. DONT FIGHT WITH ME! because as i said before, it makes me sick. its immature. ater spending more time with the friends i love i realize how trivial the fighting is. fuck that--real friends dont do that shit to each other.(i know that i have fought with two friends in the past 48 hours and im not talking about you personally, just in general- our fights did not last remember?) hopefully meg can make me feel better tonight.

I wish i could just have a good relationship with every one of my friends. is that possible? and FINALLY the unsettling fight with jess is over. i feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. i just cant take it when people are upset with me.. so please if u get mad at me--make it quick

      so, the worst week of my life has officially begun. not only did finals and term papers and projects start closing in, but so did my grandfathers life. he died on sunday morning and i dont know how to deal with that. i dont know how i can just keep on going without him. no more sunday dinners... no more him. it just doesnt feel right for him to be gone--i hate seeing my family suffer like this. i really have never lost someone close to me before. i mean sure, my mother's parents when i was really young...but now that i am older i really understand and feel that awful heartache. i just dont know what i am going to do.

      boys boys. well i have officially been single for almost a year, infact i believe that my last relationship that i would like to remember started up a year ago around this time. i just dont know how some of you do it. i am so bored! there is no drama in this life of mine. not that i would take any of it seriously anyway, but it would be nice to have some around. im living a blithe, blissful life full of felicity, and that is soooo incredibly annoying. i mean a day in the life of sam show would be no comedy, no dawsons creek, nothing. it would fail completely whether a television show, movie, or even novel. my life is officially non-worthy of being biography-ed. im dying here, just waiting for a tall dark handsome man to walk into my life and wisk me away. (ill take short, light, ugly men too) just kidding just kidding. some of you may see this as self pity, or hunting for men, but really its just a ploy to get some. no no just kidding there too. im just telling the truth--i am a complete bore. nothing remotely interesting happens to me lately. i live off other people's problems and love triangles, squares, circles etc. well enough-now that everyone is aware of how pathedic i am, i will end this entry with a goodnight, and go to bed(one of the most exciting things i have done all day.)

      so just two days till my sister comes home for good. i cant tell you how happy i am, i miss her soo much during the time she is away at school. shes someone who i can talk to about everything...not like mom who i can talk to about a lot...but ya know...cant tell her it all...but i can talk about everything and  anyone ..without having to worry about it getting out or anything. its also nice just to have her around. like late at night when she comes home and says goodnight or just someone to paint my nails or anything...the little things like that. im realllllly stoked i cant even begin to say so. when shes away we seldom get to talk like we do at home. and plus dan;s coming home with her. which is cool because mom makes good food :) we usually go out a lot more..and i like him. hes good for her. and hes a great partner for hi lo ;) anyway im just glad that she'll be around for like the next 3 monthes. it will be more fun. its hard to think that she'll never be back for good again. so im trying not to. but hey im not thinking about the long run...just the short for right now..

      some people are so exclusive. little clicks that make other people feel like they cant be apart of that. i mean yeah we all have our crews, the friends that we like to spend our time with. but they change, people change. and the worst thing you can do is isolate yourselves. being open to new people, being open to old people....well not old people but,...any people. i just hate seeing groups of people who cant interact with each other, its dumb, you could make a lot more friends, and that would make you a lot happier now wouldnt it? clicks of people just set a bad atmosphere.

      am i hurt? hells no.. just disappointed that shit like this needs to happen. its really unneccesary. but i love you to death and you're worth the world to me. so i will do whatever i can to fix things and stop hurting you.--                    anyway. sitting in my bed last night at two thirty am... i was thinking how fast i could get to the lightswitch, to the lamp and back before i noticed that i was alone in the dark. so i planned it out, it wasnt quick enough so i turned back on my lights. this routine continued until my sister came in and said.. samantha, what the hell are u doing, go to fuckin bed. so...with that she left, slamming my door. and i was left in the dark, alone, again. this was intolerable , so i got up turned on the lights crawled under my blankets into a ball and shut out the thoughts of the movie i was forced to watch a few hours before. i was thinking, this better not be like the exorcist, i couldnt sleep for weeks after that. but i was younger than. then i started thinking about what a SLUT kevin donahue is, and this made all those scary thoughts go away... and i drifted off to sleep happily, and my uneasy, unsettled scared feelings were gone. so thanks for being such a tramp kev. :)                         ONE final left. i will get to spend my afternoon studying for my LAST one... i am so happy. 6 days till florida... ahhh itll be a greatt time. and if i could pick anyone to go with itd be who im going with. so WONDERFUL. and i also suggest that anyone who watches the ring cover their eyes during the part where shes in the closet, where hes in the chair and when the little girl talks and she has the nasty face on. disturbing is what it was, just repulsive. im a much bigger fan of lets say... happier movies..

      the next two weeks are going to be LONG and i am going to hate it mucho. its like wow i have a lot to do, but i know my lazy self and i wont do shit. MR COTTER is a bad, bad  little  man. i am convinced he is suffering from the " napoleon syndrome " this means that shorter men feel like they have to be greater, or better at things then everyone because they're so small. they feel they have to make up for their lack in height. lecturing about molecules for six hours a day...just LOVING to hear himself talk. and then he gives us this nazi final.i have learned absolutely NOTHING in his lame excuse for a class. its like an extra free period. and now his final is by far the hardest i am taking(besides john allen's--the master). i despise science with a passion right now. i guess i better go get started on bullshitting my way through 3-5 pages of a paper for the bad, bad little man.

      well....the weather this summer sucks. this whole week i have been down to the beach like four times.. to see my aunt and what not. but did we actually end up at the beach? no. why not? BECAUSE THE WEATHER SUCKS... so im a little more than upset. i ahve drivers ed this week, whihc means no beach days there either. oh wellll........... my family has officially gone insane. now that my grandmother has been staying with us off and on. everything is crazy! i am making tons of money from all the babysitting... like tomorrow i am babysitting from 6-5 for some people. and then going straight from there to the other people to babysit at night. so tomorrows shot for anything too. oh and of course, the money is fabulous but i always end up  losing at least 10 bucks a week. like i think i left it outside while meg n i were weeding last night.... ah well. this journal is really turning into a place for me to complain. im really not such a negative person. back to complaining... ask me how single i am? SO SINGLE... its really a record for me. it'll be a year in september that i have not had a real mutual relationship. yes i meant to use mutual there. i dont know if thats a good thing... or not. it could be good because im more picky? or worse because im just not one of those good apples anymore. i have kisssed any hopes of ending this pathedic record goodbye. right now my "prospects" are at 0.... but i dont think about it.... can you tell its not a big concern...? sure its not.

      It makes a difference when you flash someone a smile, or say hello, how are you. or even if you compliment someone, who really doesnt deserve the compliment.... but really could use the upper. i mean come on, all of us have had bad days before... but wouldnt the world be 100 million times better if people just went around doing nice things? i realized how selfish...obnoxious and rude some of the people closest to me can be at times. not only to other people but to each other. i just dont understand how careless and unthoughtful some people can be. dont they think before they say something hurtful? i dont understand how they can find pleasure in putting someone else down. i HATE more than anything someone who puts people down and makes rude comments like that. and think about it, if you were having a terrible day... and someone at the grocery store smiled at you, or your sister says wow you look pretty today... even though you look like shit. it could just make you feel better. instead of staring blankly at people when they say hello, or never being the first to start a conversation, let alone compliment anyone. i just think too many people dont think twice, or once for that matter, about anyone elses feelings. i hate it when i look back and see that i have acted like a bitch, its the worst feeling... and i wonder if all these kids who are little BITCHES like that ever think about it. cuz they should.

      so i'm just chillin with my sisters watchin a lil vh1... and they caught our attention with the tip 50 teen idol countdown. DAMN did that bring back memories. whoever made that list was crazy. britney was number 1 of course..which makes sense. but thank god that michael j fox and molly ringwald were somewhere up there. okay who the hell is corey feldman? i bet you all think hes a distant cousin of mine. yet hewas pretty far up there on the countdown too..just think goonies.. the burbs... yes he had minor rolls in those movies and caught the attention fo america in the mid 80s when he got caught and was arrested for drug dealing. but damn i love michael j fox...anyway tomorrow is the fourth of july. and i came home from meg's this morning and did we have a flag in our front yard? where is our patriotism. no instead of a flag we had an empty air conditioner box dropped out front. how gross. WHO LITTERS? i mean coffee cups, candy wrappers.. thats all just petty thefts. but my friend, who throws an oversized box out their car window..oh anyway i will spending the fourth of july with some of my close friends. it should be a good weekend. it'll be jess, i freakin love jess, she is so fun! so thats a good thing, i know i will have a good time with her there. then alysha too, who is such a sweetheart she will make the whole environment nice! my alli MIGHT come, and i hope she does because alli.. is spectacular ;) okay then alex, of course, its his house.. kev ben and ryan. they're all equally cool... shure. right. well i am blessed that my my friends, and michael j fox are apart of my life.

      so if you havent caught on, instead of complaining about the...enticing events of my enticing life....i've chosen to write about the people in it, because they are obviously the foundation of my, again, enticing life. so meg fogarty..she is by far the dirtiest wombat out there. she is a refined, essential member of FC. what would the club do without BIGGIE DIRTY...? who knows, but biggie dirty is just her..."stage name". at heart this girl and i are real sisters. im not even kidding. meg knew me while i was still in the WOMB. no word of a lie. so 5 monthes from when our womb relationship began, it evolved into our human relationship. ummm yeah i guess thats how it works. so, september 30,1987.... a crisp fall day in chepachet rhode island, our friendship began. meg and i are best friends and cousins. so we went from days ay my house in barbie heaven with the girls(me having two older sisters and hundreds of barbies), to manhunt and journies into the forest at her house(her having three brothers). needless to say we had the best of both worlds. anyway we are living closer now, i live in her front yard. so we are close-close. she is one friend i can honestly say i would take a bullet for, without having to think twice about it. what would i do without her? she is funny shit. what would YOU  do without her. really. now aren't ya'll jealous you dont have a meg like i do?

      okay so. there  has been a crazy misunderstanding between my best friends and myself. and each other and so on and so on. so without giving away personal details and what not... i love you guys and i dont know what i'd do without any of you. well actually... i would probably be nicer to my brother and watch a lot more television. anyway you guys are the best and im sorry if i was unclear about the way i felt. i really do need you guys. so stop being so gay.  you guys KNOW that we all feel the same way about each other. we're crazy lovahs and u guys have to stop.... thinking about the negative shit that has been said. i mean i am the LAST person to let things go... but i am reallly and truly willing to if you guys are. i love ya'll more than anything, more than i tell you i love andy gould...which u guys know is a TON... ;)  anyway muah muah remember sookie sookie and its really ironic that tonight of all nights i got my pictures from NH and everything we did together all summer.. anyway to the rhinos the wombats the whales and the one and only PIG...FC4L.... blut

      SO tonight i have heard from some of the people closest to me that i'm a brat, i'm a slut, and that im not a good friend. all from separate "friends" mind you. So, to defend myself... i am NOT  a brat dammit, slut or bad friend. phew. now i feel better.. well actually. i have realized that i am the biggest push over EVER. i just dont have a reaction to anything. and i can never say no. even if someone asks me to hang out... and i dont want to... i'll say yes and then just make up a last minute excuse.(not that i did that to you... i was telling the truth). but whatever i dont even feel like elaborating any more of my problems.  so today my gram n i were chillin, ya know cuz we down like that n all. and i put my pink bandana on her... just to be cute. so at this point.. i definitely cannot take this woman seriously. but we start talking and she gives me a sex talk. in her pink bandana. and i cant help but laugh. she takes my laughing as immaturity and insists on telling my father that i am not serious about "sexual safety precautions". i mean, could someone please shoot me in the head? another sex talk from my mom, dad or fuckin grandma and i will seriously go on a prostitution spree for the sole purpose of SPITE. anyway im out of here.....(i was serious about the hooker thing, throw some prices at me)

      So... PHAT that means cool right? no LM it means .. well whatever. breakfast is funny. if only i could eat with my mouth shut. but seriously... i couldnt breath when i did that. so i think that ya'll eat with your mouths open. to survive. so stop picking on me for it. anyway.... i feel like i have lost a lot of close relationships in the past few monthes. and it seems to be over such stupid little things. i really REALLY wish that everyone would stop acting like girls. fuckin... ugh... i hate it when girls say... well i heard u were talkin  about me. bla bla bla..... no one cares. okay face it... everyone talks smack about everyone. you know you do. anyway back to what i was complaining about. i dont even remember. i just get pissed when people get pubilcally mad and start a social upheaval over their feelings. no one cares. no ones cares no one cares i get pissed ALL THE TIME... but i dont broadcast it and start fights. so in a nutshell, what im complaining about is people who feel the need to be bitchy all the time. like cut it the fuck out, im bitchy on the inside thinking really terrible things, but i dont need ur shit to add to it. god damn its 1047 how is this supposed to make any sense anyway whateverrrrrrrr now im gunna do charity research for mosc who picks on me for eatin with my mouth open and im in a bitchy mood. this is not a good idea, mixing charity with my bitchy mood. but for positivity's sake, johnny damon did look made fine all  night long and really turned me on when he caught that second out in the 9th... oh baby oh baby

      i think i may possibly live the most boring life ever... theres no relationship which equals no drama. so boring. whatevaaaa... i dont even have anything to complain about. actuallllllly... i went to the movies the other night, i hadnt been in so long, and i really wanted to see this one. so we get there a little late, and SOME PEOPLE(no names) start talking. and they dont fucking stop. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ANNOYING THAT IS. yeah i bet you do because you've been in my position too. fucking gay people talking through hugh grant. hes awesome. ohhh hugh.. no damn respect! yeah thats all i got. so what did i do today... i was with jess because it was her bday yesterday and we hung out. HAPPY BDAY JESS... so then today... oh we hung out with some kids i havent seen in a long time, one ive never seen but its all good... and then we chilled with some kids i see all the time. and now im here..... and this is the life i lead. i mean, isnt that enough to complain about.  oh jesus its saturday night already,(i know what the fuck am i doing online---i completely agree)   and i have so much work to do, i dont understand how my thanksgiving four day weeekend is actually ending after tomorrow. i hate tomorrow--its sunday. im so angry... i swaer im really not this hostile in person

      so i have this weird thing going on. when im with my "bad" friends, i feel like im a goody goody and i need to loosen up. so like when we do bad things, i feel like i shouldnt be, because of the reaction i will get from my good friends, etc..... but then i will hang out with my "good" friends. and i feel like im dirty and really bad for the things i've done. and when i chill with these guys, im not really worried about the reactions of the other ones because, im not doing anything wrong. but then again some of it does influence the goody goody thing when i hang out with them. whateverrrr... but even when im doing really good things, i feel like a bad girl. and when im doing really bad things i feel like a good girl.  does this make any sense? well it should because in the different settings or atmospheres i feel different.normal enough? i dont know. i guess i will just try not to do bad things? but where is the fun in that? am i right.  so not doing good things then. that is just not an option. doing good things is fun too....

      okay so i reallllly should be reading right now, but im such a crazy slacker lately im doing this instead. i really am slacking in everything, i mean did i not stand up on a desk and pledge to miss vigneau about my rebellion? i seriously almost come to tears each time the second bell rings..... because it starts yet another looooong dumbbb period of stupppid class. i am quasi getting the algebra though. and now the chemistry SORT of too. notice i stressed SORT of. whatever. my dad just got his wisdom teeth out. a little late. but that means that i have to be nice to him for like the next few days... and that so sucks. mom is getting wicked surgery right after christmas... what the fuck. now im thinking about everything negative. im starting to think this blogger just brings the worst out in me.  oh oh oh, so i noticed, and i displayed many examples in english! but anyway what i noticed, was , that you can tell a lot about the way people feel about you by the way they recieve your hugs/hug you. so if i go to hug...lets say....bob short(u my boy bob) he will pat me on the back. because he gets uncomfortable when i touch him. when i hug steve, he doesnt pat me on the back. drew right away pats me on the back. so, my observation is that usually when people want to stop hugging you or didnt even want to hug you to begin with, they give you a polite pat or a not so polite pat. so i never pat people on the back. unless its like my dad or someone i dont like. anyway thats what i noticed.

      okay so i wore a dragon ball z tee shirt. what are u gunna do about it? i want to make it publically clear that i am a scrub and im dirty. oh and that all the gay stuff said(holly alli meg alex kevin BEN BEN BEN mat lee dana mike etc)... i DONT even remember. because i let things go now!  okay so i have a new philosophy on life. and no, its not "dont drop the pen" kevin. so this is my philosophy. i have to start to let things go. i cant dramatize everything and anything anymore. i mean yeah i do tend to.... whine about everything for months after it happened. so i am going to let all the comments go... grrrr this is hard.. all the ex not so much boyfriends but friends and their new love lives go.... and other stuff like that. im not going to dwell on everything negative anymore. i am not going to walk into spanish and tell everyone that im gunna rip their tits or balls off if they make a comment on my shirt...stuff like that.  most of the time when i complain and dramatize everything, its an invitation for everyone to comment on it. so im working on that.  oh and i know i contradict myself all the time, especially in this, but im just. like that. i have the weirdest personality ever... im such a dork. you love it. and you love that i contradict myself....and that im a drama queen..... whatever im stopping right now. letting everything go.

      AHHH halloween. okay so we(alli holl n meg) went to the haunted corn maze. after the whole mrs bailey being cher....so, being so cool, we got really worked up about it. haha. okay so there was this scarecrow guy who kept following us and going for my feet. he freaked the hell outta me. so i decided to befriend him. it worked, he was pretty cool but he wouldnt talk. he just nodded a lot. so then... we lost biggie in the maze. SO not good, we could hear her screaming like someone was killing her, and we could not find her at all. so then this really freaky looking guy was trying to scare us. this is the good part. he helped us find her. and then i got to know him. his name is phil. he is from providence. so this whole time im like how cool is this kid? so he helped us out of the maze. it was really nice. so im thinking automatically of what he looks like. i dont know why, but i pictured just some blonde cutie. i was wrong, after we got out of the maze he came out and was like, sam?  like real close up... and not that this matter but he was asian right. so i was like surprised, because i wasnt expecting that. so i guess my assumptions... say something about myself. i dont really like what it is that it says though...  anyway fyi... i didnt get his number. it was NOTHING like that regardless of what meg al n holls say about it. but he was a nice kid. i just wish.... that i wasnt... surprised by the way he looked. it wasnt a bad surprise at all. i just never pictured him while he had his mask on to look like that. maybe it has opened my eyes..

      CHRISTMAS is a mere 16 days away... i am so crazy excited. i mean, not ONLY for the presents, though they are a great perk to the christmas tradition. but everyone is coming home. and its so nice to make this oh so empty house... not empty. full. full was the word i was looking for. so hope is already home. thats nuts, its only the 9th. but nuts in a good way of course :):) mary and dan come home next week. which will be happy exciting etc etc...... but also... with the coming of vacation(which is 2 weeks this year... SCORE), comes paper deadlines, presentation due dates and whatnot. im like buggin out over here. and today i find out that i have an art midterm. when have i ever in the past had a midterm in art? i mean yeah, a project, a painting, sculpture, anything like that. sure that would be typical as counting for my art midterm. but no. wigren assigns a paper, power point plus being oral. oral presentation that is..  anyway im outraged. but i absolutely felll in love with this artist that is so different and beautiful, maxfield parrish. i really like him.  whatever. anyway its like 11 and im so hyper.... like crazy hyper. just straightened dana's hair. and she has curly hair. it was nice to chill with her though. reminissing all night long. oh the days. ah middle school ewww is right. middle school. definately have to go there for mentoring once a week now. the halls are small. the air is heavy with the friggan disgusting scent of puberty and body odor. and the little people, who pretty much measure up to about... me. so i get shoved around everywhere. its not cool. they are really mean. seriously... i dont remember being that pushy or mean when i was 12.  anyway im trying to tire...is that how you spell it... i assume so... anyway im trying to tire myself out by writing in this because i havent in like 6 days but its not really working. well im going to go catch up with the sis upstairs since im still like completely awake and wired....

      so i can honestly say i dread checking my email. i remember the days when i used to recieve one good email once in a great while, but now all i get is friggan mentoring emails. every single day. so when i open up my mail... its like 5 in your inbox sam! all little fwd fwd you're my best friend along with these other 50 people kinda emails, or mentor meeting during spanish next wednesday. and then i always forget and end up sitting through spanish feeling sick while mr simmons confuses me with all his spanish speaking....shit.  and while im on the subject of shit, everytime i turn on the damn radio the BIGGEST homosexual song ever comes on. i think im like either going crazy or the radio can sense when i turn it on and this friggan stupid song comes on. the most ridiculous lyrics ever... like where did this guy come from? he looks like a wannabe justin timberlake with panties on. okay anyway... i was so sick only 48, even 24 hours ago. and now im fine.. it was like snap, all of a sudden im healthy again. and believe me, this i am not complaining about. yeah well it seems that i have run out of things to complain about... seems, but really im just sparing myself the embarassment of complaining to a ridiculous extent on this ridiculous little diary of mine.   okay---reoccuring dream i keep having.... paul simon and i... getting married, chevy chase the priest. what does that mean? oh well think about it. if you even know who paul simon is. and you all should if you dont.  ---this dream does not reach in any way at any point a sexual level...ever. just marriage.

      JESUS! i havent written in this thing in so long. like forever and a day...  my christmas was fabulous.. as was my new years..sureee. so i love and miss my blog so much i am so happy i want to hug the people who started the blogger website. mmm i need a vacation so bad. i know people always say that and usually mean it but i really do. i may be acting a bit dramatic... but i wish i could go to some foreign island... with some foreign man and just sex it up. haha i mean and just enjoy not being here. i friggan hate winter right now. i am constantly cold. whatever TAMPA in a few monthes righttt... so tonight i realized how much my friends have NOT changed. every single person is almost entirely the same. for example... franco. you still trash people (cough cough me) alll the time. even though you look older and better.. you are NOT. i love you though...trash talkin ass and all... you're a classic.  i absolutely love krissy beanland! i dont think i mentioned that. haha we will party together again if its the last thing i do. arghhhhhhhh  i cant imagine anything better than sleeping right now.

       i dont think i have mentioned  my best friends enough, they are my worlddddd and without them i would perish. i love them for listening to alll my problems...matt jaffa... i love them for sitting through boring track meets with me...oh wait they love me for that.....i love them for carting my young license-less ass around all the time...and for hanging out with me, because without ya'll i'd just chill with my little brother all the time and where is the fun in that. thanks for creating my problems too by the way, or just being my problems, ending my problems... all of the above. i love each and every one of you for different reasons and without a subprofile like so many of you have---i have no way of telling you besides my constant loud mouth. which doesnt always so this is like a subprofile, where girls always personalize and tell friends what they love about them. only im not being very speciific. and isnt it fun to read your name in someone's personal thing that everyone reads. i always like seeing my name..so dont deny it.  so i realized tonight how completely-computer pathedic i am. im one of those screen names you always see online. "addicted" as some would call it.. i see it as.. yeah i see it as addiction too. but whatever i noticed that i have friends that i never see and friends i always see...but i feel like im just as good if not better friends with the online ones. weird i know. but understandable? whatever i think i remember last night actually saying "i miss having a little drama in my life... i never have any drama anymore" welllll gosh darnit, a little drama comes along and i start to complain. i think i am the queen of contradiction at this point..  some drama... can make you smile for a minute or two.....

      okay so does it reallllly matter how many towels i use when i take a shower? its like the end of the world to my parents. everytime i say, "imma take a shower now"... i get the same response "dont use so many towels"  on average i use three, one for my hair, one for to dry with and the other the wear around for a while. how does that not make sense? i think it makes perfect sense. i mean, okay a bathrobe, thats what the third towel is in place for, but bathrobes are uncomfortable for me. i mean i dont know... especially if im steal really wet. it doesnt feel nice. it feels wet. and after i take a shower i dont know about you, but i like to feel nice.   so it always ends up that i have a lot more work to do over vacation than i thought. i spend the majority of vacation not even thinking about it, and then comes saturday night when i am making plans and its like wow i have too much work to d, i should stay home and work. but i never do.. and i always end up doing a shitty job on sunday night. which is what'll happen tomorrow at this time... ill be stressed out and end up passing in quantity instead of quality... sorry miss t.

      alex and kevin are good shits.  my friends, so i cant realllly get into how much i want to do them both... riiighhht.  so alex--i have never laughed so hard in, well not in my life but you know whatever. so your jb impressions almost made me pee i was laughing so hard. you are fricken hilarious when u wanna be, the pesemistic thing doesnt work for you though. but hey you're hot right, and you're genitals are ENORMOUS.  so kevin-i dont even have to mention your wang cuz half of the female population has seen it, saved it, and used it with their "leroys" right? right. i know i do. (if you want a picture, email me and  ill send you one--samantha-chella@excite.com) you guys i dont even know what to say. you dont need me to tell everyone how unbelievably sexy you are. you reallly dont. :) but you are. and i could get gay and talk about how you are my best friends but i wont. cuz then i'll get uncomfortable. and it will be awkward. and theres nothing worse than that. so last night, there was this lady... this really reallly hideous lady at the mall. and yeah thats it. that story isnt as good as the experience of the hideous lady, but believe me it was a good experience.  so guys i know you'll be disappointed in what i put... but i did mention how hot, funny and how large your dicks are. so give me a little slack oittt my  black friends.   i put how sexy you are too. psshhh you guys have got to appreciate that.

      So these two girls i know, are ansolutely unbelievable people. (and surprisingly enough i dont mean that in a homosexual way). yeah so... i consider myself very lucky to have them apart of my life. i dont know what i would do without them! i hope they know who they are. they are funny sons of bitches. butttttt they're amazing and i love how they TREAT ME. not like im a five year old. for some reason i have that affect on people. they tend to treat me like a child.. and not take me seriously. because i mean come on, i am serious at least 40% of the time . like right now. pshh  so in health(so boring)  we were talking about stress and how different types of people deal with stress. and different personalities and stuff like that. so i realized that i dont get stressed, i mean i over dramatize things sometimessss ;) but i dont usually get very worked up about things. i guess i am a pushover... and as much as i do care, i'd rather not deal with it because i hate confrontation. so there's my problem: i am a complete pushover because of the fact that i cannot deal with confrontation. hmm something to work on i suppose? but it does save me a lot of stress. i guess. maybe i should stress out a little bit more about school. that might result in better grades...who knows.   so today in art, we slipped and said shit, hell, ass, fuck etc etc a few times. and mrs wigren has this swear jar. everytime we swear we have to put a quarter in. which is funny, because i didnt think i swore that  much at all. until recently... i paid up to mrs wigren. and then in algebra i called adam a bastard right in front of mr parrillo. i must be a complete idiot.  so i get home and im talking to my mom, and she said that she thinks i have tourettes. like are you kidding me? do i really swear that often?

      you know everyone says girls are caddy blah blah theyre so mean to each other and they always fight bla bla. and that may be true. but in my experience boys are the same if not worse then girls when it comes to that stuff. the high majority of my male friends have something negative to say about everything and everyone. i mean you cant mention a nice thing without them shitting all over it with immature rude jokes. by the way that is an awful quality that is terribly unattractive for all of you wangs reading this  excuse the whole hostile bitch thing going on..

      this morning i had blueberry pancakes. this was the third time this week that i have had blueberry pancakes for breakfast. i think tomorrow i will have them too. mmm the  joy of simple breakfast meals. annnnd another thing i noticed was that a number of people this week were sporting the new look.... huge hickies. i havent completely come to understand how those look hot yet... but im on my way. but seriously, i dont think i have seen as many hickies  in such a short amount of time ever. one of these days i will have a huge one. and everyone will be like "look at that hot girl with the hickie"....oh i know, its a long shot. but it could happen. oh how dreams come true

      so i have come to the conclusion that mental health days should be just as excused as sick days. i mean, like today for instance, had i gone to school it would have been an emotional disaster. i would have been too tired to seriously take in anything i was taught. i wouldnt have understood the subjunctive tense if simmons had taught it to me... i wouldnt have been able to sit through one of mrs folsoms google lectures, and i would most of all not be able to handle the quiz in history. so ... end of story.

      so my weekend was okay considering i was grounded and all.  saw JOHN MAYER last night. okay it was amazing. he was wonderful. i went crazy. right there, right then, i would never have thought twice about having sex with him on stage in front of the whole place. he was fabulous. and that is something that i wouldnt do with just anyone. well anyone at all really.  dont give me shit about john mayer either(every male  i happen to associate with) if you were at that concert, you would feel the same exact way as i did. and do.  i love how i  can feel so happy at like 4 pm, and then once 7 rolls around i become angry and upset at almost everything. maybe the series of events in between have something to do with my mood changing. but its crAZY how i could be so sure of something one minute and so unsure the next. boys boys boys. if your name is not john mayer i want nothing to do with you. unless you're a nice guy. but if you're reading this thinking you are one of the nice guys, you're not.  OKAY boys totally writing off all commitment and relationships "for the rest of high school" is becoming a commonality among guys around these here parts. see what crazy bitch girls do? they ruin you. i mean am i the only one picking up on it? not that i want any of you commitment fearing losers, but if i did there would be a problem. but i think i speak on behalf of all girls wanting an unattainable man when i say, dont forget about the rest of the girl world because of one bad relationship.  i mean come on, if you really like a girl why should anything stand in your way from dating her? i think that the whole not wanting a girlfriend while im in high school thing is just a popular excuse for --i really dont like you hunny-- so taking that into careful consideration, i think all you non-relationship losers are just cowards who cant be straight forward with the girls that like you.  this was inspired by a conversation i had tonight, you know who you are, but it really doesnt have any personal meanings at all, because i dont like boys. you for instance, i love, but dont like. or want a relationship with, so... dont get all worried on me.  just something i noticed..

      so i just saw passsion. cuz kris and i always go see movies afterschool together now..lol..but anyway.. it was completely different than i had expected. i mean sure, i heard that it was amazing, wonderful bla bla. but i just thought because it had the word "christ" in the title it would be like one of those jesus movies on tv, or something they would make us watch in ccd. something like that. but because of the good reviews and wwhatever i went. still expecting something the same. but it wasnt. the whole latin hebrew thing didnt even make a real difference to me. it made it seem more realistic but anyway... its just like me to cry mid-way through a powerful movie like that... and  somewhere between the scrouging and the constant beatings i started to tear up and then, the whole crucificying did it for me. so i was between krissy who was completely non crying at that point.. and sam. sam, the epitomy of manly, who of course was not crying. so i was hoping i was not alone in finding this emotional, and  i looked over at the old women in front of us. not a tear. but i found the movie... great. it just made me think a lot about what i  had learned my whole life in church..and i never honestly thought about it twice. i mean sure i know all the words to all the prayers im supposed to. sometimes i even sing along with courtney. but i never truly considered what happened to him (jesus) and so the movie, i suppose, did change my religous.. condition. ugh but the last movie i saw. with krissy. not cool. it was the new lindsey lohan one. i expect good things from her. i LOVE her. i am to lindsey lohan as krissy is to angelina jolie, as ben is to laura, as.. mom is to dad...as courtney is to clint. you know how it goes. so dont go see her new one. even though i must admit,  i was a fan of her leg warmer look.  wow i have gone on and on, but i have to study for like 4 make up tests.  (sighhhh i hate march)

BOYS RUIN EVERYTHING. JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME PLEASE unless ur like steve d... then u can come as close as u want

      my away message right now... just happens to be "you dont bring a sandwich to a buffet"  must i explain? ehhhh i think i will. basically you dont bring a girl someplace where there will be lots of girls. because that would just be silly would it not? so regardless of my poor reaction to that when it was said to me by....mmmm maybe i dont remember. either alex or ben. but for real i do understand. it just wouldnt be a good idea. i dont want to be there when you guys are trying to pick up girls. even though i must admit i would be entertained by about 96% of it   so friendships between women and men.  possible? i totallllllly think so. i have PLENTY of male friends who i am completely  un attracted to. and im sure the feeling is mutual. no offense harry... but you're just one of those men who doesnt pay attention to girls unless they are attractive. SO i guess that it depends on what kind of person you are whether you can have a platonic relationship with the opposite sex. honestly most of my boyfriends have developed from platonic friendships first. and i just became more attracted to them as time went on. so when im right im right. and tonight im pretty sure im right.  but my mood could totally change and tomorrow i could argue the same issue on the side that says---there is no relationship between a man and a women without an attraction. so i could write about something insightful or bullshit something that would make me sound like i was trying to be smart, but it would just make me a billion times happier to just vent every single thing thats on my mind right now. .... or i could just go to bed. cuz thats the kind of person i am.     i would rather just go to sleep.

      so im sick... and i could totally cry you a huge ocean about it... but im trying to cut back on the complaining. we'll see how that goes...  so not to be one of those 'count downer' people ...but why not... only 9 days til i get mah license. finalllly. woooo. im like the last person ever to get it. ever in the universe. but it will feel good. i hope anyway. now dana and i will never be bored again :) lol. that is if i pass... and of course find my permit.  i always seem to be losing something. alwayss.... come to think of it ... ive lost a lot more than i thought. ahhh remmebering all the important things i need to find asap.ohhh shittt (alli style) haha me and alli miller... we got bondage now... considering we're non-band trip/europe trippers. good times.  i came home sick from school today and it wasnt as fun as i thought it would be. i just kind of stared at the ceiling trying to breath--but it hurt. you know cuz i cant breath through my nose.. and my throat hurts terribly when i breath through my mouth, and i know you all know what i mean when i say that.. my nose was getting so red so i put vaseline on it. i use that stuff for everything. i put it on my hands sometimes... my knees elbows and bottom of my feet. and sometimes... well.   whatever this entry was shit.. but i had to put something in.

      i have an issue. everyone who knows me has experienced this problem i have. probably first hand.   it is impossible for me to say no to anyone about anything. i cannot say no to people.  and the result of this is all bad. this has NOTHING to do with recent events. by the way.  but for real... someone would ask me t o do something friday night i would say 'yes' even though i already said yes to someone else and someone else and i dont wanna be like that anymore so i swear to god i will say no when i should  or when people call me t o babysit. whether i can or not i always say yes and then i have to call back and apologize and then i get nervous before i call... and i lie... and its a mess.  perfect example of my long-time disorder : 5th grade... kayla fernandes birthday party and jess thurbers birthday parties. OVERLAP! the worst right. well kaylas was afternoon-mid-evening... jess's evening to night. handleable.  but i should have picked one.  instead i went to see titanic and the mall with kayla and party ... and left early. ----kayla upset. so i came to jess's late.-----jess upset.  no one is happy out of this deal. i missed cake at kaylas... and the acorn fight at jess's. there are things that you dont forget about missing out on in life and they DO leave emotional scars. but for everyone who was at jess's that night... ya'll KNOW i didnt miss spin the bottle...(goood times.)  i wonder how jess and kayla are.....i havent seen either of them in . well. whatever i dont know how long.  so yeah my long story was probly for nothing but..its 12:58 am and kevin just pointed out my problems with saying no and i needed to talk about it to my blog...  yeah alli miller has a blog... not cuz shes 'bored'....cuz she wants to be cool like me. we definitly got lost in east prov today... and definitly had a black man with no teeth make a sexual guessture at us on the highway. thats what i call bonding baby. fc4l i love u.

      its vacation and i juss got back from florida... well like 2 days ago whateva. florida was beautifulll the whole time.. and then i come home to this shit weather where im cold allll the time. its awful. but im officially ungrounded. and its nice. i guess, no different then before. i have no homework because i wasnt in school for a few days, so i probably have lots of homework i dont know about. its fine. i had like a whole blog done last night. and it was one of my more interesting ones... but then alex and ryan came to get me and i had to x it out quick. sad moment... so now i have nothing and im just blabbling on.   you know how when you give someone a piece of gum and then everyone wants one after? yeahhh thats definitly whats goin on (im just kidddding i love love love you even though you wont give me a ride home if i wont ... well yeah. )  so everyone in florida was tanner than me. but i was like whatever im the 'whitest white girl' some old man has ever seen but its fine. it was florida. people live in the goddamn sun there.  then i come home... and everyone else is still tanner than me. how does that work. i spend 6 days in tampa at the beach and i come home, and ryan harrington is much tanner than me from baseball.     i hope i do somethingg tonight......

      okay so well deserved(im not sure if that is so true anymore...after her nice blog about meee) but a holly huston devoted entry. you have been my best friend for a long long time chickie. (dont get jealous, you're my best friend too...) but beachie, my most wonderful memories have been spent with you. oh the times we've had. but most of all you've always been there for me. you take my side even when you shouldnt, but you also dont let me look like an idiot.. and correct me when im wrong. which sometimes i dont appreciate at the time but in the long run its worth it. and hey i know it.. you are beautiful, and pink... pink is my favorite color... and yours too.. and you're the only person i respect for loving it too. thats GOTTA mean something. i know you... ive walked with you once..upon.. a dream.  oh mariah carey and sleeping beauty. what would we do without em? oh corny girl songs and meg fogarty moments. oh god... dana's bathing suit... night before florida... memories memories.  i loveyou so much. love this okay bitch?

      okay so prom was last night. good times. uncontrollable laughter [pm ad] right.. everyone looked beautiful and whatnot. i had the best date ever. thank you matttthew jaffa.  so drew bangs and jim davis--- looked absolutely gorgeous-- erin and brie were lucky girls. lemme tell you. krissy bean is like my favorite ever. that lesbian (hahah ur poor date)and i wanna say i totally admire and respect amber's ass-shake. we white girls practice that shit... and it usually doesnt happen. so mad props. lol... classic---watching chad houle do a britney dance impression...  but anyway another person who made me almost wet my pants besides chad houle was steve d... this kid and his moves. phew..but overall prom was a good time. made me start thinking about graduation... sad moment.. i wishishishihish i was graduating in 30something days.   i have sooo much on my mind. but sooo much i dont wanna write about. i mean i could. but why get into all the emotional bitterness when i could come across as such a happy person.   for the record i do have the meg fogarty sleeping disorder and make noises with my mouth.

      officially summerr... :) spent my first few nights of 'official summma" at alex's. so nice that he has a beach house. but anyway wednesday afternoon i finish my last final... and i come home  and im like ahhhh finally through with ponaganset until august. what a nice feeling  "sam, i wanna show mrs wigren my stuff before she leaves, can you take me?"-hope ...of course i can. so i do. so no sooner did i leave than i arrived back in room 45, welcome to hell. (personal joke with becky--  i hate when people put personal jokes in these things...but it just seemed appropriate.) anyway finallly get home again... ready to go online and get packed.. and see alli.. and go to the beach.  but no "samantha... will you take me to run some errands, i know you will because you're the best little grandaughter ever. "--violets ...of course i can... but little did i know that meant standing there while she got her 70 cents back that she was overcharged at cvs for a sale on werthers, no that wasnt a waste of 15 minutes. neither was screaming that the people in the pharmacy dept... or getting out of the car at the drive-thru at citizens bank to knock and point her finger at the clerk through the window. oh violets.  but beach house was fun . kevin--"fuck you guys, you're a dyke, and your boyfriends gay" as kevin storms away "want a nut??"-alex. oh man i could sit here and quote everyone on all the funny shit they said in the last few days but chances are, anyone who wasnt there wont think its funny, or will. either way whatever.. i was exhausted last night. i couldnt even stay up to finish SVU, i even think i fell asleep before meg did.  i was probably so tired because SOMEONE kept me up all night.. and i still havent caught up in sleep..someone who likes to snore all night and then wake up at 7am and play tent foot. the worst game ever invented. oh and you wonder why your mom wont care if you die kevin.  .....im kidding. your mom'll care.    what a long pointless amount of information. oh well i do what i can with my blog.

      so my weekend was good. not even sick of alli yet. hah. so friday night... graduation. my speech was hot. then kevin and mat lynch cleaned my car. what nice kids right. right..roll of my eyes-- but it was funny. alex never ceases to make me come close to peeing my pants.  so saturday hung out with my allison. we ran errands, i helped her do her papers, and then went looking for meg. but she wasnt home, so we chilled with ray for a while and stayed there even after he left. awkward being at meg's without meg there? never.  so then we hung out in alli's bed until we figured we should go out cuz we looked so hot. went to dinner and to see shrek 2 with court and holly. well actually they went to see shrek 2 and i went to see andy etc. which was nice. :) courtney slept over.. and officially saw my boobs. no lie. should i let this information out? hell yeah. did she think they were nice? hell yeah.   newsflash-- dave larsen is straight.  not that i ever doubted it for a minute.   12 hours, 6 finals and 3 days left of studying left for me.    im way past being ready for summer.

      oh mags. you KNOW that you are my best friend. even though you're family, it counts.  no one is as lucky as us. i mean think of all the pairs of best friends... we have been bffs the longest. we were best friends before i was born.  you are way too special to be put in a blog, but whatev. this is for you. we've been through everything together. bla bla lets save it for the birthday cards... every year we cry. its cool though. i love you.  we never fight. unless its about me smoking or something, which is the best kind of fight because its about you caring about me. i guess you are the more dominant one in our relationship.considering im a crazy pushover and you're not at all a pushover. at least not with people you know anyway. but it all evens out   okay MEG its cool for you to be pissed ur not in here--but if ONE more person complains to me im going to throw up on them.

      so its been awhile little blogger.  5 more days of officially coming in to school left. coming in and seeing mr hicks in homeroom... mmmm so 2 days of review, three days of finals. so most people have one final a day... or two one day etc etc.. i have back to back finals everyday next week. the only laid back one is health.. which makes me mad bc its ridiculous that i have to come in for the D period final block when all we have to do is take a twenty minute test.. "final" my ass. but whatever im a good kid-- forexample: today holly and dana went to the beach after 1st period... i spent most of first period going back and forth... devil angel on my shoulder. "go to the beach and miss ur algebra quiz" or " stay at school in the hot hot hot sweaty classrooms and be a good kid"  hmm all my angel devil moments always have to do with the beach... cough cough field day or beach incident.. alex devil alli angel.  HOT HOT HOT SWEATY classrooms. by 2:10 this afternoon.. i was walking around with 600 smelly disgusting people. including myself. i could not leave fast enough. but it was a good thing i stayed at school.. i supppose.   being broke isnt  so  bad... more like  incredibly  bad. sigh this summer will be full of long days babysitting and 5 bucks an hour to play monopoly... hide and seek... just thinking about it gets me excited...  bill cosby will be fun though... 9 bucks an hour... to sing karaoke.   okay im going to save myself all the extra typing... and answer this one general question that everyone means so well by asking.."so sam, hows the love life?" "what love life?"                               some see it as pathedic. but im just picky    rightttt...

Heath just left. hes a little hottie... i mean a hottie in disguise. undercover hotness.  i wore a sweatshirt today because it was so gross and chilly out. but here in school its like hot as hell so now i have alli's little sisters wendys shirt on. hotness.   SATS are saturday. shit shit shit, my weekend is looking bleak.... real bleak.   its wednesday. i have chem next. a nicee little 10 minute presentation on formaldehyde. ill do what i can to make it not-so-painfully-boring.   in art we're doing oil things, and oil paint obviously. im excited for that class. last period? no the one before last. they should make the turpentine scented so it doesnt smell so pungent. oh wait they do, we just dont have any.    i tried going to bed early last night. that didnt happen. now its 9:30 and im exhausted. and its timeee for chem...  5 periods to go. G lunch...mmmm i dont really like G lunch but i can deal.

      people always say june is the best month, but really it isnt. you spend half of the month taking and preparing for shitty finals. and then the rest is good i guess...which doesnt exactly prove my point. but the whole half of it being in school time helps a bit.  finals. sats. shouldnt i be worried... im not. im a bad test taker. what can i say. i dont expect much.  i wish more than anything that i had n64 right now. playstation and whatever dont do it for me. the... controllers arent the same. theyre too complicated for me. i liked the n64 ones... my hand molded to it. i loved that. i miss it. i cant lie i wish i still played video games like a little loser still.   at least it made being a loser fun..  memorial day weekend--- didnt exactly go as planned... but it was realllly good anyway. hendriken prom--was awesome with andy hes the best. i love him. then my mike bonsante incident saturday shared with al and holl. good times. allison miller---i spent the entire weekend with you. and it was good, im not gunna lie about it.   "im not gunna lie about it" i dont know who originated that, but its insanely caught on and has begun to annoy me. in like march it was definitly the cool thing to say, even april. now, i find myself saying it and wishing i hadnt. im not gunna lie about it...  okay LAST thing im gunna say about my weekend. FUNNY how kevin donahue tells  me  i drive too fast.. and tells alli girls arent good drivers... right before our ride home from alex's beach house sunday afternooon... FUNNY kev..

       some people blog about what they do, what theyre upset about, or a certain someone. i try to mix it all together.. but this time im gunna go with a certain someone...  kaitlin frances fiorenzano. i have no i dea if i spelt that right. how shitty is that? my blog is dedicated to you, but i spelt your name wrong. thats like an editor's nightmare. i guess thats okay, nightmare works for me, dreams and samchella dont usually match up.  anyway, kait. you're mary's best friend, but that makes me happy because otherwise i wouldnt know you as well. i love that you love me, because i love you. i love that you tell mary to calm down when she yells at me, especially because im usually in the right.      i love that you can tell me how ugly my shorts are, because "usually you look so cute" and then proceed to jump on me with one of those really nice hugs. i love that you're brother is so nice, i could totally marry into your family.  and i especially love that you're coming to the beach with us tomorrow. ypu truly are someone i consider apart of my family. another sister. (:   >remember everyone, you gotta earn blogs like these

         its been a good week so far...    my girls have been around a lot and that makes me more than a little happy. we've all developed a new obsession with ashlee simpson. i swear to god dana if you dont burn that cd for us soon we're gunna burn ur house down.            just kidding.                i am babysitting today. big surprise. how else would i be spending my summer? at the beach? god no, i'd rather play beamo ball for 7 hours a day. its totally worth the money. totally.             im sad i  missed jim's call this morning, i hadda take people to work... then babysit... so i didnt get to talk to him. dont you hate it when that shit happens.         "im babysitting today" usually i get a response like "oh that stinks... it's only till 530"     but from you i get  :   Danza6987:    u could make them touch u, then it would be fun!             i have these two new best friends... anthony and tony. they make me happy when we hang out.       its my mom's birthday...i should call her soon .

       so i finally got to see allison this afternoon. we shopped for samuel, had lunch and got me dressed 607 times. it was fun i love her. im so tired ive been slurring all my words. its ridiculous, but i can always sleep in tomorrow morning.   oh wait, no i cant.   happy birthday amber and samuellll.... it was nice to see everyone tonight from school-- i dont hang out with most of you so it was cool. sidenote:im a little jealous that my friends didnt surprise me with penis balloons and cake on my birthday. just kidding, but i thought that was really sweet.    boyfriend #1-7 dont compare to  the one waiting for me in my car.   and i dont mean alli.     and im totally gunna ignore the fact that you were waiting WITH alli.....skank.

       im kind of excited about this whole... you can change ur  font  ...  size ... and  color ... thing...  and we even have a spell check! doublly nice. wait is this? whoa im impressed with this whole new blog me set up. so i've noticed how popular blogging has become. erin blanchette being the newest member of the blog-people-club (golf clap). alex grant being the shortest lived member evah. but he has my respect for his  one  incredibly funny&nbsp; entry. &nbsp; there are a lot of people i havent seen much lately. like MAGS. where the  fuck  have u been lady? alli... but i always mention her... alex and kevin... havent seen you guys since like sunday or something.  whatev-- but i did get to hang out with jkop last night which was just lovely. AND my alysh tonight. !! theres this thing alysha and i tend to do whenever we're out in public together--- we like to hold hands. it just feels right.. so we were in target tonight, and there were SO many people that would glance at us... our hands... and then us again...  i wonder if they were thinking 'good for them' or 'ew gross--- dykes' oh well i could care less all i know is i love her.. and i love dana my little patient tonight. i couldnt help but giggle when i saw her eating her tuna in the shape of ice cream scoops tonight. she was taking the smallest bites ever, it was adorable in a gross painful way. &nbsp; i should really put up an away message while i do this, people (bob) keep distracting me. not that i wicked mind or anything &nbsp; &nbsp; weekend tomorrow. woo hooo... im upset that alli and holly are gone but i can live without those bitches for 4 days. or can i... im beginning to seriously doubt it. &nbsp; im not a huge fan of this font but its kind of fun to play around with this shit. i wonder if i can add pictures.... &nbsp;

      so i decided to try that whole, shave-your-legs-less-often and get a smoother outcome that way thing. bad idea.. spontaneous trips to castle nails for a pedicure (which includes a lower leg massage) calls for a pretttttttty damn embarassing experience. jimmy-the nice vietnamese guy rubbing my un-shaven legs-just laughed at me. i really like that place. i strongly recommend it.   matt jaffa i missssh you.   so one more day of babysitting this week. that makes me happy.. so does jess kopka. saw her tonight.  and cass from burrillville. shes just adorable.   ive had a rough couple of days--- so thanks for listening to me hollly.   also...... where the hell are you allison. wait i know the answer to this and i wont see you for probably another week. but i like our every three days long conversations over the phone. they keep me satisfied.  CML you're slackin in the whole 'keep in touch with your best friends who miss you' thing. its not even about IT anymore. its about me missing you. sheesh.

      im weirded out. holly how did u write in my blog? weirdo. sry ive been all over the place the last few days..my away messages do lie. sometimes i make up cool things i want people to think im doing, when really im watching thats so raven. ha just kidding. so holly got the job, no hard feelings. fuckin bitch. ha just kidding again.. my weekend was good but.. there was  something  different about it. i just havent been able to put my hand----finger on it yet. hah so i heard that if you shave twice a week you will be smoother? well if thats the truth im done shaving every freakin day even though i was a little more than embarassed tonight when jim brushed his hand against my leg-- i was like (eww i didnt shave today)in my head, you know mini panic attack.  but i covered it up with, "oh im peeling... " yeahhhh..smooth like butter.   so heres how i feel: who cares what anyone thinks, yet at the same time i dont want to hurt anyone along the way.   i need to go to the beach its been a long time. im babysiiting tuesday wednesday thursday but friday im free all day. i definately should have gone on sunday with dana but i was so comfortable in holly's waterbed that i just couldnt bear to get my ass up before 11.   musicals in cartoons piss me off.

      and so.  you finally find someone you click with. and then all the complications, conversations, and weird ass hook ups come up. and then its like, well she likes him, so i cant hit that. or but he likes me but i like the other guy here... and it just..gets awkward.. it sucks...because you dont want to hurt anyones feelings... or your own.  my sam is upstairs with three girls rightnow. hes such a stud   had lunch with kyylleee today. it was coo  then i came to hollys w. my sam  and  jimmy came.  that was coo too.    erin was here  with ashley. i like them girls. they're so nice. lily got trashed again. it was much more entertaining last night though  i miss lauren so much already. and i dont just mean that in an online journal shoutout way.

      okay im going to be honest..theres nothing i hate more than babysitting. for real. and i do it so much... im suffocated with it.  for the next eight weeks, i am babysitting 3-4 days... long days... i could shoot myself in the face. i really could. last night i slept in a hugeee tent. superior to any of the other tents ive ever been in. it was like a house tent-- no-- a castle tent. it was all good up until they broke out the camera and used forceful... well whatever they're not forgiven.   i love lauren. and not just because shes here from georgia and i never see her... because if she still lived here, i would still be bffs with her. know what i mean. shes cool shit...im dreading saturday, but hey we hadda good ten days.   so last night i went to sleep with like 10 girls surrounding me being all girl like and such, and i woke up to a completely empty tent, silence and no sleeping bags besides my own. nothing. it was nice, suprising but nice.  who would have though that by 8am everyone else had to leave? i didnt think it.   mags came last night! but she didnt stay because shes a dirty whore and had to babysit for her gramma this morning.   slut.    im sure ill see her later tonight anyway. maybe if she reads this while im still at the cosbys she will come over again.  i hate babysitting.. maybe i will end up going to alex's tonight. that all depends though. my life is so shitty today

      so long time no blog. i know im getting bad at this. believe it or not, i think it has something to do with me being busy.. weird. my online is not working... once again... so im moochin off meg's comp... once again...  i just got back from the beach and im sandy as hell, sweaty.... and still white. thanks to holly who thought it was appropriate to sunscreen molest me all afternoon.  "not on my watch".... someone must have let paco out. (reference to CML ALM MEF HEH and anyone else who knows about holly storing our history teacher in her ...) well the beach was gorgeous today... i crumbled in holly's lounge chair multiple times but its cool to be clumsy like that.  fireworks were last night. no offense to anyone there but, it sucked i didnt have fun and i was hot. but afterwards i got to know tony fernandes and that was cool... dont know whats up for tonight...but the phone is ringin... and its alli.. so im about it find out.

       HOLY CRAP. i know i appreciated all this customizing at first, but now its pissing the hell outta me.             last night i went to hollys. saw some people therr . that was nice.       FYI--surveys are for boring ass people. the one underneath gave me friiiiiiiikan carpotunnel. spelt exactly how it sounds.. bitches.      so spent the day with dana. CASTLEd up, even though we both could really do without manicure spending. we're ppooor bitches..      AH speaking of money, guess who got a job? ME. i actually got hired.   and i guess im not a complete reject, bc it was such a bagel. im shocked bc i thought fo sho when holly got the call and i didnt, i was a failure at life, and i pretty much contemplated suicide a lot.      kidding, like i told you last night, i could never do that even if i reallly wanted to. im just not strong enough. ha         its 1228. and guess what. me and jim didnt go to sleep till 4am last night. and then i woke up at 9 and i havent slept since. do you know how tired i am? i bet you can imagine since i gave such a great description.      you know how people always say. "we should hang out" i say that to a lot of people and dont mean it.   people i mean it to>> amber and kris, greg steve and phil,adam croft, bob short..... etc. i guess. i mean i cant really think of anyone else.       okay remind me to blog about little brothers next time. i have MUCH to say about that. but i wont because i am far too tired to continue.. i hate being the last person up, because that means i have to turn off all the lights and go upstairs in the dark alone. and everyone else is asleep. and im gettin freaked out by all the flashlights outside. but im just gunna ignore that.
