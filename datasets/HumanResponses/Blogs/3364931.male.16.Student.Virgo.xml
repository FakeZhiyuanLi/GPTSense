      hey people, for those who have not yet got the chance of watching the movie Troy, i suggest that you should check it out ! the casts are really really cool and the scenes looks shockingly authentic. So its like quite awesome,and be prepared for some heart stopping moments too. Yea...i thought it would be a boring show but in the end, it was quite good...who said history sucked ?! in the end both of the heroes died...so sad...( at least let brad live lah !)  By the way, it was 2 hours 40 mins long, so brace yourself ! it was a good thing that i went to Cathay Cineleisure to catch it, the toliet's is in the cinema theater itself ! so i didnt really miss out any good parts.last but not least, the pre-sex scences was really Hot !! What an experience ! seriously,it's either the show was not censored properly, or they honestly (for once) relaxed the censorship rules. but dont expect a hands-in-your-pants sort of show, there's just too much battling goin' on !  Movie rating:  75%

      who said harry potter and the prisoner of askaban was worse than the previous two ?? in fact, i think its better than the last two ! the cast looked older ( duh marcus ) and much more experienced in the show, making the show more natural and flowing...if you get what i mean. Wow the spells are awesome and so was Hogwarts... Rowling is an awesome storyteller and i hope she comes out more stories. That reminds me that i HAVE to get the 4th book....something about the phoenix or something like that....since i have the Kinokuniya vouchers ! erm...Kino really have many books....shelves and shelves and rows and rows of books...from witchcraft to something like "the horoscope bastards:you guide to finding the bastards in the horoscpoes!" to Jap mags and interior designing...hmm...i could spend the whole bloody day ! sadly....i only spent one hour and it was closing time last night...so...i didnt use the voucher.hmmm...will go agin tomorrow...  Speaking of which... i have my rehab tomorrow at CGH @ 2.40pm...hmmm.wonder if physiotherapy is painful...i hope its nothing serious...my feet is getting worse each day...the doc said something about the inflammation of the muscles due to the over-usuage of the leg....din know that could happen....so on monday i ran two times around Bedok reservior, which was a grand total of 9.6 KM.the furthest i have ever ran in my entire life...which brought about the bloody pain in my leg...and so im limping everytime i walk. On top of that i still ran on sunday for the J-train training...wow...thinking back huh, i think i deserve the pain on my leg ! So now i have to recuperate and not do any excercise for some days...what a life...oh well...you cant have everything going the way you want anyway...still living, so to live is to challenge oneself !  Had a great dialogue with Ming Wei, Colin and my new-friend-but-it-seemed-like-i-have-known-her-for-a-lifetime Rowena at Starbucks...we talked from 8.30 all the way to 11.30pm ! but i felt so encouraged and set targets for myself immediately that night....and did some encouragements and articles for my classmates who had problems until 4am and went to school at 8...but i felt happy that i could help them out with their problems. okay...something like that....peace out.

      Just bought a new cd by Avril Lavigne, Under My Skin.Being a typical Virgo ( will check out my starsign online and paste it here) i am extremely critial about anything that concerns me. And the verdict is....after a year (or two) break, Avril still rocks !! wow ! her album is amazing ! i liked all of the songs inside it (except one "he wasn't" which didnt really make sense) wow...one talented chick here ! punk rock seems to be getting better and better huh ? However, compared to her first album, there is more "other" sounds other than she singing, and sometimes her voice is covered by all the "other" sounds,making it sound like she's scream-singing(or is she?)...but overall i still think that if you guys are thinking of getting something new, Avril's album is not a bad choice.Being in the industry for quite some time now, she seems to have matured in her thinking and thus portrays it in her lyrics. there's even the last song, called "slipped away", it was dedicated to her grandpa who passed away i think. the lyrics is really meaningful, and tell you she's not just another punk freak gurl devoid of loving people i guess. I guess why Avril's song really turns me on ( not that way !)is because she is really truthful with the lyrics she writes and that you are able to relate her song to a part of your life, be it when you are madly infactuated or have a love-at-first-sight thingy, or feeling betrayed by your other half,and i guess that's cool. oh yeah,one last thing. I didn't regret buying it.

      hey...read this at today's sunday times(yes, im reading something new other than those bitchy mags)...the topic about "shallowism" and the bias-ness(if there is such a word) of the society...quite a good article...  IT'S not pretty to say that one desires beauty, so Singaporeans shy away from admitting looks are important. Nearly everyone (98 per cent) polled in the latest Sunday Times Poll claimed to be happy with his or her looks and that looks don't matter.But if given the chance to change one thing about themselves, 60 per cent would grab it. On the wish list: a flatter stomach, a slimmer figure and more toned muscles.  Mr Peter Lee, managing consultant of an executive search firm, said: 'It's still politically incorrect to admit that looks are important because that's 'superficial'. But no matter what, people like to deal with attractive people.'  The social stigma of being seen to be over-concerned about looks means that plastic surgeon Martin Huang needs to tread carefully when he meets patients at parties.  'About 80 per cent of them ignore me and pretend that they don't know me. This is why I never acknowledge patients in public, especially high-profile ones, unless they acknowledge me first, so that their privacy is protected.'  Of the representative sample of 438 people surveyed by Singapore Press Holdings' research arm, 42 per cent reckon that good-looking people have an easier life.  About 80 per cent say that being blessed with big eyes, flawless skin and a toned body means that one is more likely to nail a job than a plain Jane or average Joe.  Some 60 per cent think good looks are important in getting a promotion. Human resource specia-lists agree.  Mr Lim Kian Kok of Mercer Human Resource Consulting said: 'The reality is that we'll be biased towards attractive-looking people.'  At job interviews, first impressions always count. Human resource manager Esther Chia of recruitment agency Kelly Services, said: 'Good looks give one a foot in the door.'  Social psychologists have found that interviewers decide within 15 seconds if someone is right for a job. Another study has found that when identical resumes are presented with different photographs, the unattractive ones are less likely to be shortlisted.  The companies interviewed said that if they discriminate by looks, it has to do with the positions. Cosmoprof, which manages spas such as those in Fullerton and Goodwood Park hotels, will not hire anyone who is overweight or has a bad complexion as a guest relations officer.  Its manager, Ms Angie Soon, said: 'They have the responsibility of greeting our guests, and thus are required to look attractive.'   Even firms that are not in such beauty-conscious businesses admit that all else being equal, they would choose a more attractive candidate over a plainer one. Mr Alick Chia, managing director of SKF Logistics Services Asia, said: 'Human instinct would lead us to pick the better-looking one. Looks may also translate into more confidence.'   Polytechnic graduate Susan Cheong, 22, knows what this cost her. She had six interviews in the two months after she graduated, but was never once shortlisted, though her peers found work quickly. She said frankly: 'I'm obese and not pretty. People in the human resource industry tell me I need to lose weight if I want to work in the corporate field.'  Now an administrator with a non-profit organisation, she said: 'When I look at job ads, I automatically rule out those that want 'pleasant-looking' people. It means 'young and pretty'.'   Psychiatrist Lionel Lim said he sees four or five patients a year who suffer from depression or anxiety because they were bypassed for jobs or promotions, owing to their looks.  Some choose plastic surgery. Dr Huang said the number of clients who seek his help before going for job interviews has doubled in the last two to three years.  Firms insist that though looks may play a role, what ultimately counts are attitude and capability. This is good news for Miss Cheong, who is determined to fight on her own terms. She said: I believe my attitude will pull me through.'    If you ask me, i feel that how you look does not stop me from befriending you, but for me i feel obligated to look good,or the best of my ability,to keep up with my horrendous appearance ! its just that the society is shallow nowadays and it will be getting worse in time to come i guess.    Many peeps think that if you are good looking, then you are a really shallow and a proud person. Not true. Take me for example. Hahah just kidding !! No lah...haha...really kidding, im jus the average joe lah... but i do know of people who are good looking and yet are very nice people...just that they have more self-confidence and thus that is what people nowadays are looking for right ? (hope it makes sense)I have friends who are modelling type and they are quite nice people. really.But,there are also quite a number of people who are are blessed with good looks but have a proud and shitty attitude. so, i guess you would have to know the person before you comment then,and that's what i always do.   Im just that teenage boy, with  hair that NEVER does what i say, with oily face that is...well...oily,and although i am not fat i FEEL fat.Then if thats the case,in the first place i should not have lost weight and take up a strict exercise regiment, beacuse i still feel fat before and after i lose weight ! I spoke to my mum about it(about my mental problem bout being fat), and she said i am retarded. Hahaha kidding la ! she said i am already skinny enough(Since when did anyone say that to me ??!!) and if i continue to go on the strict routine, i will become underweight. i told her if it is even possible for me to be underweight that is, then i will see how. So now she's like forcing me to eat lots ! gosh !the last thing i ever need !   Btw, i just realised, that i can go without food for the whole day without feeling hungry at all ! wow ! amazing right ?? it so happened that yesterday i had a whole day filled with activities from the time i woke up till night, so i didnt really eat until like seven, and then i was still not hungry then even after running 2km!  but i forced myself to eat for fear that i would die from malnutrition or what...hahah...will try it again tomorrow ! just drink my soya bean and everything will be alright !  will be running @ bedok reservoir tomorrow afternoon with my dear friend Karin. Cant wait to run ! love the scenery there man !(and the eye-candys even more!)  K la, hav to go to school tmr. go zzz now...oh ya got any comments pls write down okay ? thanks guys ! goodnight !

      Here was one of the interesting blogs which i read just now...hope it inspires you to do....anything?? hey by the way peeps, for those who reads my blog religiously ( hey dont hide i know one okay!)or for those who REALLY have nothing better to do right, just leave comments about my blog alright ? thanks ! Title:Love...like a bus ? When the bus come, you look at it and you said to yourself, "eeee... so full...cannot sit down one". So you said to yourself, "I'll wait for the next one." so you let the bus go and waited for the second bus. Then the second bus came, you looked at it and you said,"eeee...this bus so old...surely very uncomfortable one." So you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus.   After a while, another bus came. It's not crowded and not old but you said, "eeee... no air-con one...and the weather is so warm, better wait for the next one." so again you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus. Then the sky started to get dark as it is getting late. You panicked and jump on to the next on coming bus. It is not until much later that you found out that you had boarded on to the wrong bus!   So you wasted your time and money waiting for what you want! Even if an aircon bus came can you ensure that th e aircon bus won't break down or will the aircon be too cold for you? So people...want to make sure that what you want is not wrong. But it wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance, right? If you found that the "bus" doesn't suit you just press the red button and get off the bus! But wait...I am sure all of you have this experience before. You saw a bus is coming (the bus you want of course) you flagged it and the driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you and zoomed pass you!   The bottom line of being loved is like waiting for a bus and whether you want to get on the bus and give the bus a chance depends totally on you and walking alone is just like being out of love. Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what he or she means to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time, it might be too late. Seize the day.   Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today. Friendship is never an accident. It is always the result of high intentions, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution. It represents the wise choice of many alternatives. And remember.... Keep Smiling....coz... "Of All Things You Wear, Your Smile Is As love returns to me. The only way to find LOVE isn't finding the perfect person, but by loving the imperfect person perfectly. True LOVE doesn't have a happy ending, it simply doesn't end.

      When you'd cry i'd wipe away all of your tears, when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears, I held your hand through all of these years, But you still have,all of me.  Err..no prizes for guessing whats the title of this song(in case you dont know,it's My Immortal by Evanessance)... Dedicated to no one in particular, jus had this song running over and over again my head. Being single, its perfectly normal to be thinking of all these kinds of stupid things...hahah..its kind of hard to like someone but not let the person know huh? but...being me as usual, i'll just wait and see how things go, never making the first move,yet quietly dropping hints to be picked up.Yet i know it may be just my puberty-induced hormones creating infactuastic-love commotion in my life to make it more interesting...but i'll still wait for a while more i guess...a little while more..  Today was tiring.Skool started again for the June Hols...and it dosen't end till the second last week of the hols...like i said, what holidays ? I seriously think the skool has some issues. What if we study too much and just before the O's we become mentally retarded ?  would they be happy then? Then my future will be gone ! haha....but seriously, O level year is no life man...but, looking far ahead, i ACTUALLY needed the extra lessons ( wow, i cant believe im saying this !)if i want my distinctions so that's the bottom line. No complaining anymore. But i have to tell you, the teachers that are teaching me are great.. I mean, how can you find a group of approachable and down-to-earth teachers in a bundle (teachers like Miss Lee, Wendy, Cindy....it goes on)? so i guess thats my good fortune and i have to make good use of it !  Wendy Loi came up to me today while ordering food. She actually told me it is possible for me to get a distinction. Checking if she may have been drunk or may have mixed my identity with some first express class student with thick glasses holding a thick book wherever he goes, i realised that she was looking me straight in the eye. I was like....oh okay cool ! i can actually get a distinction ! if i work at it,that is. I never realise that she thought i had potential. Therefore this spurs me to do better in my POA. hahah...yeah thats about it for today then...boring life i have here... Sign out.

      Sherk 2 was the movie that i wont want to watch again,anywhere, and i will stop watching kiddy movies for a long time.Firstly i have to tell you that it was not to my liking but however the computer animation was great ! it looked realistic and really good.but the story plot was boring and the movie tried very hard to make people laugh,and i hardly ever did, except from the part where the mouse fell into the hole while trying to save the captives. But anyway it's supposed to make people laugh and it is a kiddy show, so i should have lowered my expectations...haha...oh well.. its a good thing that i didnt pay for it huh ? its a good thing that i watched with my mum ! will be watching "Day After Tomorrow" again later this week....its really good....oh yeah,you guys have got to watch Harry Potter 3 coming on june 6( if you dont know!) and Mean Girls showing now... okay will write more when im free then.  Shrek 2 Movie rating: 55% pros: the animation was fantasic, great cast cons: shitty story plot, corny jokes, nonsense ending

      yea...just came back from school and had my prelim orals...i got the highest in the class(by far)so im actually quite happy with it i guess....anyway im not competing with anyone for my prelims or my O's. yeah anyway going back to the show,basically this show is about some currents in the sea reversing and causing ice age, in basic layman terms, not using climate jargons that the show used so much. When they were explaining why there was a climate shift i was like "huh ??" but when the show continues you'll roughly understand what the hell they are talking about, so no worries there.The show was thrilling and suspenseful so not much boring dialogue, more on the action and people running and screaming which is what i like best in movies (im no sadist). There was one part where the wolves were looking for food, and they jumped out of the room and nearly hit one of the actors (have yet to find out his name)and that really got me.I actually shouted...hahha...sorry annabelle ! haha...erm...and another part was the freezing of the temp and there were like running here and there....that was cool too... overall the movie was superb and i'm watching it with my mum again later tonight i think, can't wait ! so if you're still thinking of watching it, let yours truly,the movie guru,tell you: catch it now !  Movie Grade: 85% pros: The SFX (special effects) are great, the chaos even better. cons: The show should be more realistic man ! Five or Six hurricanes destroying Downtown Los Angeles ( Plus the one erasing the sign "HOLLYWOOD")? give me a break lah ! and the SFX usuage is really obvious, so minus points for that.  Who should watch: sadistic people, disaster inclined people, Psychos, people looking for eye-candy actors Who should not watch:people who screams when there are exciting scenes, people who cant shut up,people who do not know anything about global warming

      One word. Wow. It was incredible !! The Special Effects was amazing ! an awesome show... well anyway i went with the school to watch it yesterday. The trailers for the show has been going on for months, so naturally i was looking forward to it.The seating arrangement was cool, i was sitting with my two great friends Annabelle on my left and Joel on my right. The show actually starts off with a global warming conference in India, and we all know that that was when India started snowing, meaning to say that the "climate shift" was already beginning. oh shit....okay i have to rush to school for my orals, i'll continue in part 2. peace out.

      Hey...wow it's been awhile since i last wrote anything here...perhaps my desire to keep an online diary is waning away...wahaha...oh well...i have better things to do anyway...the first week of school was hell..i had to wake up dead early, brave the chilly coldness of the morning air and nearly killing myself in the process of after-showers..change into my horrible uniform and look neat and clean to go to school,which, i must say, when i reach the school i am already sweating like a bloody pig and no, i don't feel NEAT and/or CLEAN anymore.What a life ! err...enough about that already...have to get used to the bloody routine and trying to continue my studies again..so that's about it i guess... Gab's birthday party @ Sentosa is on Sunday...and i have not got her anything yet ! have to make arrangements with Joel and Belle to see if they are interested in sharing...hehe...I have a feeling that i'm gonna have a great time this sunday during the party...hope i will not be disappointed..most unlikely though.. Oh and the Community run is that day too...wow..after weeks of practice, i am finally running the 5KM run at East Coast...hope everyone comes prepared...and my foot dosent give me problems... have to wait and see...i think i have to try another method of writing into this blogie...oherwise i will get bored of writing in and stop altogether...hmmm....am thinking about it... yeah so that's about it for me...im not a enthusiastic writer...but a very lazy boy ! hahaha okay till next time (soon i hope).  PS: Have to go for the CHIJ Fest on Saturday at CHIJMES with Glenna...okay...noted. PS(2): My chinese O levels Listening is on Sat ! so fast !
