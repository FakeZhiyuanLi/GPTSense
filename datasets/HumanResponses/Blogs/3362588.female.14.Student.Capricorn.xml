      I just got a email from some freaky person named james who has my password!!  AWWW!!  So I changed my email password, though the real question is, what password for what does he have??  Or is he just some freak who lies?? And I got ANOTHER email from some other freak who asked me if 'I don't got no money??'  Sup wit these peeps?????????  haha.  Strange.  Maybe I should reply and say, "You better watch your back, I work for the CIA."  heheheh.  I think I will....  muahahaha  Give those people a taste of their own medicine.  And then I'll block them, so the can't send me back mean replies.  hehehe.  What do you all think of that???

      Muhahahahaha.  Just got back from taking off dad's cab and - *gasp* - I drove ALL the way down the driveway at the property!!  Yeah, I drove all 150 feet down and even drove around that really tight curve at the top!  I only killed the engine like 3 times (the truck's a stick shift and doesn't have power steering either, I'm so good.  haha).  I *ahem* did almost run into the embankment, but you don't need to mention that.  haha.   *gasp*  Here comes dad...  I'm supposed to be doing a report on Egypt and the Ottoman Empire.  Must run... fast... Signing off - Jack the Really Ausome Driver  P.S.

      Man, I am so tired.  we went to the taming of the shrew last night.  Pretty darn good.  Though I do think that if Shakespeare had lived today, some of his jokes would have been censored by mothers.  hehehe.   Went to pond day yesterday at Kylan's (sp?) house.  It was really fun-o!! haha.  I dripped water inside of the house and made Kylan clean it up.  Muahahaha.  And then Kylan's mom made him go and get a little dead bird from outside so she could identify it.  It looked like it flew into the ground.  Pretty funny.  Ashley said it commited suicide 'cause his wife cheated on him.  I got laughed at alot by everyone.  *sniff* poor ol' little me.  hehehehe.  Yeah............. And we went garage saling too... got a nifty saronge (sp?).  It's Hawiaan and still had the tag on it.  Was tempted to buy another fish tank, but I figured that I already had enough.  so yeah...........  Got a sand lizard to... Named it Max Nardo (or Nerdo for short.  haha)   Then we finished Hangman's Curse.  THe end's pretty good.......  Not as good as the book, but not bad.  The book ruins it all though.  Bloom does not commit suicide.... "Dude, that's not how you throw a frizbee!!" haha better to to church now, Going down with a bang.... Jack the Mighty

      I just got told the three things every girl hates being told:  What are you going to do when the boys start chasing you?  Your really blooming... and....  Do you think your pretty 'cause I do.   AWWW!!  I hate that!  When your mom's friends are all talking and one of them turns to you and says something like that.  Or when your mom and your friend's moms start talking about rather *ahem* private stuff about all of you infront of their male children and your standing right there (I'm sure Elena can remember at least one of these instinces.  heh).  Hate that.    Yeah......................... So..........................................  Better be signing of.................

      Guessy whaty I foundy???  A site where you can buy mexican jumping beans!!!  It's so cool!!  I want one!!  WOW!!!   www.mypetbeans.com I REALLY REALLY WANT SOME!!!  That's what you can get me as an early birthday present,k??????  Good Oh Yeah!!  I watched half of Hangman's Curse today.  It's kinda... corny.  It's SOOO different from the book!  Elisha is a snob and Eliija is just..... weird.  And Bloom?  Bloom WAS supposed to be nerdy - yet goodlooking, but in the movie, he's just dumb.  Snyder's pretty close to the book, so is Sparks.  And why am I using last names you wonder?  Because I've now decided that I'm British. Oh darn, I have to go to bed.  man.................................

      Mom was just reading me this article about these people who remodled their house and found three bodies underneath.  Can you imagine finding a coffin buried under your house????  That would be odd... Definatly very odd. Oh, haha, I was reading some other guy's blog.  It was funny.  He put hair removal stuff on his chest - needless to say he was... sore.  He said every time his clothing rubbed him, hot needles shot throw his skin.  muahahaha.  How wickedly funny.   I almost lost Pukey today.  He flew up in a tree and we couldn't find him.  I was all like, "Ah man!  Clarisa's gonna kill me!!"  But we finally found him and got the dumb bird down.  Then Edgar crawled under a shelf in the garage and while I was getting him out Pukey flew onto the roof.  aHHHHH!!!  Talking about the birds, I'd better go check on them....

      Hey guys!  I changed my blog address 'cause this one has nifty templates and I like the adds betta.  Nifty, eh?  hehehe.  We went on this bird watching thing today at Round Valley lake.  It was pretty fun.  We all got a pair of binoculars and a nird (whoops, that's supposed to bird.  ha) feeding chart.  I zoomed in on people faces, it was fun.   Oh, and I didn't have to do algebra today either!  muahahahahaha.  Clarisa renamed her blue jay, it's new name is Pukey 'cause it pukes.  It doesn't swallow all it's food, it just keeps it in his beak and then when your not looking splatters it all over you.  It's really sicko.   I looked up Jack's Musings on google to see if my blog would come up, but no...  It came up with some friar's blog.  A friar with a blog?  How weird.   haha, there's this article that tells what to do if your mom discovers your blog.  It says that instead of saying you got drunk last night, say you got marshmallowed and your mom will never notice.  yeah right.   So what am I doing right now?  I'm touching up a photo of me to put on my blog.  Let's see...  We'll give me perfect eyebrows....  A flawless complexion.... Should I be wearing makeup or not????  Hmmmm.....Not.  That flawless skin is coming round really nicely.  Bless you Photoshop.   Well, must run. Signing out - Jack the Great  P.S.  don't tell anyone the picture is touched up a bit.  hehe.  You can show it to all your good looking single male friends.  okay okay, i'm just joking, relax.  I mean, why would someone who looks like me need that kind of advirtisment?   Fine then, break my bubble.  I'm leaving..........  merrrrmaid.....  muahaha

I met alot of cool people, like Tommy, and Brandon, and the other Brandon, and Aaron, and Hannah, and Trey, and Faith, and Katy, and Rachel, and.......  hehe.  And I met some weirdos like RJ, and Eddie, and Brian, and....  heh.   Had a great time.  Ruined my legs playing in the mud.  Totally scratched up and stuff.  It was alot of fun though.  I played gutterball most of the time.  Had a blaste.  It was just too awesome to tell about.  Beside, most of you have had to put up with my camp ravings anyway.  haha  Signing off -  Jack, the one who misses camp like heck

      Have to make this short, going swimmin' wit Ashes and Leners and G.I. at 3.  I just wanted to say bye to all of you guys (especially Mandy 'cause I didn't get to say goodbye.  boohoo.  Not that I'm dying or anything. heh)  Yeah, going to camp tomorrow.  Alisha's going.  merrr.  Her parents are going to just to make sure that she'll be 'comfortable'.  I can answer that one right now.  No.  She will not be comfortable.  She will probably have few if any comfortable moments at camp.  She will be dirty, thirsty, often hungry, probably scared, and sometimes lonely.  But what does comfort have to do with camp???  Nothing!!  Camp and comfort are two entirely unrelated ideas that have nothing to do with eachther.  But will she have fun?  duh.  That's why you go to camp.  I told that to mom and she smiled and told me not to say then when I was around them. haha.  Clarisa said that if Alisha gets there and she decids she doesn't want to stay, her parents will take her home.  Can you believe that?????  Gee, if she was my kid, I'd be like, "Goodbye!  And get used to it."  haha.  Lovergirl.... heehee.    So yeah..............  Camp's gonna be fun.  Then I get to go to another camp, which will be ausome.    Clarisa likes baggy shirts.  Okay, that was random.  Now she says I'm mean.  Tee hee.  Word.  Must go.  Signing off-   Jack the water goddess haha

      I had a totally weird dream last night about Ethan.  I dreamed that we were in McDonalds and in the next booth was Josh and Ethan who were talking to Robert and Ethan sounded exactly like Slug when Slug was making fun of Ashley.  It was totally weird.  And then one of them (I forget who) orded a chicken burger shapped like a face wit pickles for eyes and stuff.  I guess that all comes from evesdropping on Ashes and Josh's conversation yesterday.  hahaha.  It was fun.  Josh was all ticked that his stepdad wouldn't let him ride the predator, so robert and him were gonna ride it anyway hoping they wouldn't get caught.  That was right after Richie called for the 4th time and Ashes told him that she already had a boyfriend and his name is Josh.  hahaha.  So Ashes told Josh that they were now going out and Josh laughed.  It was really funny.  And then you could hear Robert in the background saying, "Who are you talking to?"  Josh: "Ashley"  Robert:  "Ashley Crim?"  "Ashley Kerr."  "uhhhhh..."  "I dunno, you might not know her."  "Ninth grade?"  "Yeah."  "Okay, I know her."  And then Josh says to Ashley, "He had to figure out what grade your in to know who you are."  And then he started laughing.  It was pretty funny.  And then Josh was all like, "yeah, Robert's a little weird sometimes."  and then Robert said something, so Josh says a little louder, "But I think he's cool.... Yeah, he's pretty cool."  Fun stuff.  And then Ashes called Slug and yelled at him.  And Slug got really ticked off at her.  And called Amy a lier and told his side of the story.  I still think da real story is somewhere in between.......  And then Richie called agian.  And, boy, was that the WEIRDEST conversation I have EVER heard.  He wanted her to record their conversation and stuff.  He kept telling her to stop and play and record and....  Strange stuff.  "Shut up, Russo." hahaha. *ahem*  Went swimming wit Leners and Jow-tow yesterday too.  Fun stuff.  Sandy Beach is SOOOOOOOOOO shallow this year!!!!!  You can walk from one end right to the other!!  I bet it's even too shallow to jump off the big rock!  So I'm ticked 'bout that.  Next year it's gonna be a big sand pit.  awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.    Darn, we have to clean today...... but we cleaned YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!  But no, it's NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!! *sob*  The agony!!  hmmmmmmmmmmm.... Notin' really mucho more to say.  There's a big party today at Spanish.  Thank God spanish is OVER!!  wooohooo!!  I hate Spanish.  So boring.  I'm so not a launguage person.  *Fake motherly voice*  "But you COULD be a language person, dear, you do so good!  Your the best in your class."  Yeah, well, that's not saying mucho grande.  I always get a headache during Spanish too. Prob 'cause of Will.  He is the most annoying, spoiled little kid I have ever met.  If I was HIS mom....... Anyway.

      I ordered my hat!!!!!!!!!  WOOHOO!!  It's so nify!  Went to Better Design, and the hat I WANTED to get wasn't there anymore (it was just your ordinary flex fit with red embroidery on the holes and the bill).  So instead, I got a hat that looks exactly like that, but it's mesh stuff.  Like the mesh they use for sport jerseys.  It's lined though, so your hair doesn't show through.  I'm getting Jack embroidered on it in red in cursive.  For anyone who wants a custom hat, Better Design is the place to get it done.  Only $3 a word.    I ate a ton of watermelon for breakfast - like half - and felt bloated with water for the rest of the day.  That was really good watermelon though.  Really sweet and mmmmm.  heh.    Nothin' else has really happened today.  I was home alone all morning 'cause mom and dad were at work and Clarisa has been at Alisha's for the last two days.  *sigh* I swear she lives there.    Can't believe camp is Saturday!!!  Yeahhhhhh!!  Slug time... haha.  'Twill be fun.    Awwww Man.........  I have a test in Spanish....... Oh well.  I know all the stuff.  It'll be easy - I hope.    Signing off-  Yours Truely

      My nation just tried to make streaking legal.  agh.  Yeah right peeps.  Try to sneak that one by me.  They tried to make it a law that every one would be nudists in my country too, give me a break.  (for all of you who don't know, I play Jennifer Nations.  It's an online game where you make your own nation and then the game will send you 'issues' you have to deal with.  And then by the way you make laws out of the issues is how your country succeds in the world.  pretty fun)  I gotta make this short, 'cause I have to go to bed.  Youth was okay.  I had a major tummy ache the entire time.  And Destiny kept chattering on and on.  Between her and Ryan and John, they should start a rabbit trail league.  They can get off on some new subject off of anything.  It's so annoying.  Yma is a slacker.  She hasn't been to Youth in like forever.  And Josh lied to Mandy and said he was going to be there, when he really spent the night at someone's house.  Lier. hehe.    Ashes spent da night last night.  We watched Bruce Almighty.  Good movie.  Guess who picked it out???  My dad!!  Ashes and me were all looking for something PG rated ('cause we didn't want my parents to freak), and my dad picks our a Jim Carrey movie.  It's SOOOOOO funny!!!!!!!!  SPOON!!!  hahaha.  My mom had the remote, so we had to fast forward through two parts.  But hey, it's better then not watching it at all.  We stayed up until like 12.  Not bad for us. haha.  Talked mostly.  Tried to get the stupid excuse for a camping lantern to work, but no.  We didn't have enough batteries.  Talk to you peeps later,  Signing off,  Jack

      No really, I don't want you to kiss me... it's alright... really... I didn't really mean the tittle.... awwwwww!!!!  *SOMEONE kisses jack*  You can makup who the someone is.  I really don't care.  haha.  Someone.... hey, that's a good nickname.... But for who I wonder????  If asking mandy, she will probably say for either robert or eric (or is it erik???  hmmm.... erik sounds... vikingish. haha) 'cause she's convinced that both of 'em has my pict beside they're beds.... whatever mandy. hahaha.  Gee, I can't believe sue missed graduation.  That's like blasphamy or something.  Or maybe not.... heh.  I mean, Vinny used to live with her (or he still does??) and she missed his graduation??? That's wrong.    Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.....  Just got back from Susanville.  I needed to buy a swim suit, but no, they had no one peices and we're not alowed to wear tankinis to camp.  Humph.  So instead I bought black capris (exactly like my tan ones but black).  I'm told they look like guy shorts, but who cares?  Not me.  :0)  They are very comfy.  But I look gothic now 'cause I'm wearing a black shirt too. hehehe.  And I bought patriotic socks for camp (the theam is red white and blue).... and I bought some hair ties 'cause clarisa keeps loosing mine....  and.... nothing else..... Except peanut m'n'm's.  They were yummy.  Clarisa tried stealing some, but I didn't let her.  She bought three mangos, and I can't eat one 'cause if I do, my mouth'll swell up and crack and go completely numb and buzz, and that wouldn't be pretty to go to camp wit.  Oh darn!!!!!!  I meant to buy flip flops!!!!!  AGH!!!!!!  oh well.  pffffft.    Let's see.... Tomorrrow is Sunday.... Clarisa is going to alisha's house... I think she's spending the night....  i'll be bored......   Heck, I am bored.  Not a soul is on good old msn.  Mandy and Ashes have abandonded me to go to kid's day.  pfffft.  heh.

      I was just checking out a bathingsuit site (looking for a swimsuit, why else?), and I clicked on this one button and found myself in the Fat People Swimwear Section.  Awww.  Okay, it wasn't named the Fat People Section, it was called the Wide section, same dif right?  I mean, I suppose you COULD be really wide one way, and really skinny the other, like a piece of paper, but is it likely to happen???  No.  Sorry, people.  :0) heheh.  Hmm... How weird.  You can ship underwear to peeps for their birthday.  It's like, "here's a wonderful pink bra for you, you need one."  I would find that insulting.  I mean.... Sorry again.  :0)    Oh, I got a job.  No, not the one at the silk screen place (Donette said she was 'downsizing'), but at Sue's summer camp.  It's like 5 weeks @ $100 a week... That's like.... $500!!!!  Wow!  That's like the most mula I have ever had!  $100 a week to teach kids crafts, go swimming, goof off, and go to copper creek.  wow.  hahaha.  It's like 4 hours a day.  Not bad.  It'll be fun.   So waz up wit yours truly other then all that stuff??  Notin' really.  I'm trying to get done on a picture for my uncle that I've been working on for a long time - like 3 months.  It's never quite right... But then, DiVinci worked on Mona Lisa for like 5 years.  So I guess 3+ months isn't that bad....    Hmm...  Quizzilla just told me that my greek god is Aphrodite.  What is up with this???  Every quiz in the world is tellin me I'm a romantic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AM I???  NO!!!  Idiot quiz...  Just 'cause I daydream, don't mean I'm a romantic.  Sheesh.  AND I"M ALL ABOUT BEING GIRLY AND PRETTY??????  HUH??????  come on!  And I have a twisted soul.  So I'm a romantic wit a twisted soul.... Okay.... "Twisted Souls have good senses of Humor and other times can be a bore."  haha.  or "Twisted Souls are kind, loving, weird, zany, temperamental, and very talented."  hehe "But, if you love someone, youre serious about it, intense, and forever loyal. Congratulations-the world should have more like you."  Oh yeah.  hahaha.   And I'm not in love.  I knew that.  But I'm also not not in love.  So I'm somewhere in between???  And if I were a pair of shoe's I'd be sandels.  Oh yeah!  Tevas all the way!   And my weird latin phrase is, "Furnulum pani nolo".  Which means... *drum roll*  I don't want a toaster?????  wow.  How weird.  hehe.  (for you who don't know, I have been taking Quizilla quizes.  A lot of fun, but not something to do with your parents looking over your shoulder) hehe  Nothing much else going on. I'm kinda bored, kinda lonely.  I miss everyone at drama.  waaa.  I wish there was another play going on.  Man... I should go to public school next year.  :0)  *sigh*  Signing off - Jack the....

      WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!  *sob sob* I'm okay now.  *sniffle*  I can't believe today was the last performance of The Hobbit!!!!!!!  Man...  And just when you got to know people.  I mean Miguel would kneel and give me his sword to put away like a knight and tease me, I talked to Marki and sat next to her, I told Thomas he looked like a freak in makeup and he laughed at me, I smeared pink make-up on Brady's forhead and also told him to grow up, I told Robert that he looked cute in his mideavil outfit (okay people, he knew I was teasing,it wasn't like I fluttered my eyes and said, "Oooo, Robert... sexy outfit..." no) .... What a life...  The play today wasn't as good as yesterday.  I guess everyone knew it was the last night and was depressed.  And I was kinda day dreaming while playing the violin *ahem*.  I actually took a bow today, :oD.  The last two nights I kinda edged out and edged back in... I hate taking bows.  Stupidest thing ever.  But I got a lot of applause - or maybe that was for Alex who came in right after me.... Keep on dreaming girl.  haha.    Right before the performance, I was with Becca and Eric and Robert backstage.  And Robert found all the costumes from other plays.  So he wore this nifty fur Russian cap.  And then Eric saw this straw hat with this weird band around it, so he's all like, "oo, I can be Tom Sawyer!"  And Becca's all like, "That band looks really stupid though."  And Eric's all like, "Then I'll tear it off."  And when he put it on he really DID look exactly like Tom Sawyer.  He's all like, "now I just need a fence to whitewash."  It was so funny!!!!  But Robert lost my red berray (how in the world do you spell that???), so I'm mad now.  hahaha.     The after play party was a blast.  I forgot a change of close, so i had to wear my bodice all through it - but that was okay.  I look slick in it anyway, got alot of looks - hahahahahaha.  I'm just joking peeps, take a deep breath.  Sheesh.  We had this jazz music on - really old jazz music - and Brady, and Emmanual, and Robert, Alex, and Marki and peeps were all dancing.  It was great.  They played Carmen My Love and Brady sang along to it.    There was this sparkling cider there and Marki, and Cat, and Robert and me were all trying to get at it, but we didn't have any cups.  So we told Brady to go find some, and he asked us if we were under-age.  haha.  So we finally found some but we didn't have a bottle opener, so Robert tried to be mocho (or however you spell that) and tried to pop off the mettle cap with his bare hands.  I laughed at him.  And then Jeff is all like, "Aw, Robert, let ME do it." And Robert's all like, "Fine then." But Jeff just almost cut open his hand.  So Robert and me laughed at him.  Fun stuff.  Mr.  Bradley had a bottle opener, so he shook up the bottle and we all went outside and popped off the top and tried to catch the foam. Then Jeff's dad, and Jeff, and some of the other guys soaked Mr.  Bradly in another bottle of the stuff - at least, I think it was apple cider.    And then Brady went outside to fire arrows at nothing - which he stunk at, he got it to go what, 8 feet???  haha - So I went to show him that I could to it better.... And.... stuck the arrow up on the school roof.  It was fun anyway.  hey, I did do better then Brady. hehehe.  And then Dad for some reason dared Eric into doing 10 pull ups on the door frame (I'm suprised Sue didn't hang him.  hahah).  He could only do 7, which is pretty good, so of course Miguel had to show off too, but he could only do 3.  Then Mr.  Bradley had to show off two, but he made it to 4 and slipped off and landed on the floor.  He said he slipped, but I think he let go 'cause his pants were falling off.  hehehehe.  It was really funny.    Then (yeah, we did do more stuff.  haha) when we were cleaning up, Eric and Brady were all singing while they were sweeping.  They were all like, "everyone needs a friend... lalalalala" (okay, it wasn't EXACTLY like that)  And after the fith time, Eric's all like, "Let's find a new song..."  It was funny.  I was gunna ask them to sing That Thing You Do, but I didn't.  *sigh*  And alot of other stuff happened to... Like Miguel giving me his broaken batman sword (I seriously think that sometimes he'd stand on his head if I asked him to. haha) all keeling over.... and my rapping papper broach (I tapped the rapping papper to the neclace Sue gave me to my bodice).... And Becca's crown (made of the stretchy gold string that went around the rapping papper.... Doing the limbo with Jeff and Becca and Eric and alot of little kids.... and lots lots more.  So yeah... I had a good day.  One of the best days of my life I think.  A warm and fuzzy day as Amy would put it.  A day where you relize that all that fun you've had is gonna be over, so you gotta make up for it.  A day where you love everyone and everyone loves you.... okay okay, I'm getting sentimental now.  Didn't think that was possible huh??? hahaha.  So.... I think I'd better sign off before this post gets any longer.  ;0)

      aaaaaah!!  Breath, breath!!  *gasp*  AHHHHHHHHHH!! Okay, okay, I'm alright now.  It's just that the play's tonight and I don't have a fiddle to play!!!!!!  See, yesterday I broke my brand new E string.  It must have had a weak spot, 'cause they AREN"T supposed to break the second time you use em'!!!  So now, I'm counting the seconds until the play.  Sue SAID she's getting me one when she goes to Chico for her appointment, but what if she forgets??  Or what if I ruin the violin since it' the first time I've ever changed a string by myself??? I even lost sleep over it... well actually... I couldn't go to sleep for any number of reasons.  And then I kicked my alarm clock out of my bed (so what I sleep wit my alarm clock??????????) and broke it (I think). Seriously, I think God made my hair out of spounges.  I washed and braided my hair last night so it'd be all cool and crinkly for the play, and it STILL isn't dry this morning.  After sleeping on it ALL night.  Better be dry by tonight.... Oooooo....  Here's a site on changing fiddle strings........  drat, no picts.   Oh man, the computer keeps freezing up.  I hope the power surge yesterday didn't bust it.   Dang... Doesn't anyone tell you how to change a violin string with pictures???????  How a hurdy-gurdy works with pictures... not what I'm looking for...  Signing off - Jack the Still Tired

      I'm soo tired.  Man.... I've been going going going all day long and, frankly, I'm beat.  we had the longest play practice I have ever had to suffer through.  It was soo boring, and soooo long.  It was detail stuff, so we'd run through a scene like 3 times.  With huge gaps inbetween while they decided stuff.  Oh well.  Tomorrow will be a better da..... wait!!????  Tomorrow is THE OPENING NIGHT!! *gasp* I had an interesting day other then that.  Somehow, they all got into telling blonde jokes, which turned into rather discusting, dirty jokes.  Alex is all like, "Okay, I can see where this is going, shut up now."  But nooooo... Braidy STILL had to keep going.  Grow up kid.  Jeff is all like, 'Something about highschool curupts (sp?) kid's minds."  That was kinda funny.  But otherwise, it was very immature and stupid.  After Braidy's bad joke, Amy's all like, "I don't get it!  Tell it to me agian.."  We're all like, "AMY!!!!!!!!!!"  How blonde. But I got to give Robert a hard time, which was fun.  hehe.  I was all telling him how to do his job (he does scenery).  He's all like, "Okay!  You have to guess the lucky number that I'm gonna show to Eric.  And if you don't, you have to get off the stage."  But he didn't really mind I don't think.  And then he flicked me and ran away when I wasn't looking.  But I hit him anyway.   And I found this cool straw hat wit lace on it left over from the wizard of oz, and I wore it all crooked for most of practice.  That's how bored I was.  Actually, it looked kinda stupid.... but what do I care???   I can't think of anything else... soo....   Signing Off- Jack da Mighty, Great, Super, and otherwise

      Work was hecka fun. We went swimmin' like all day long. I had to walk kids up to the bathrooms twice. The second time, Andrew and James come up to me and are all like, "Will you take us to the bathroom please???" So I get out of the pool and they gleefully yell. "Yeah! Serena's taking us to the bathroom!" I'm like, "Woa there.... boys....." So all the way up and back, they use the worst language they possibly can (I really cannot repeat some of the 'songs' they sang). And they wouldn't listen to me... and mer mer mer mer mer mer mer.     Ooo!! I can do a squirrel dive now!! Woohoo!! It's scary, you totally have no control over what your doing. Scary feeling. Hurts to, sometimes. If you don't know what a squirrel dive is, look it up on Google or something. :0D Freakishly frightening. And yet it makes the adrenaline flow if you do it right. hehehe. I love diving. So far I can do a jump into a dive (really nice), a suicide (those things are awesome), nearly perfect jackknives, pretty nice can openers, cannon balls.... big splash...., and some other stuff. Now I gotta work on my flip. Can't do that for heck.     It was SOOO funny!! I was supposed to go with the first group back to the school, but i didn't. So when I walked back down Brian was tying on Kaiah's hawaiian wrap dress thing, and he's all like styling with it and stuff. And then he's like, "I have boobs!" so he tied to dress to make it puff out and stuff. I'm like, Brian, you are gross. And he was lookin' at me, too. Icky.     And then him and Eric were all styling with it. It was halarious. Eric used it as a turbin and jumped off the diving board 'indian style'. It was sooooooo funny. All the kids were staring at us. And then Brian tied it around his shoulders and did a suicide with it streaming behind him. Steven's like, "Eric is superman!" and Brian's like, "No. I am superman." And then Brian told me to yell WATER POLO really loud 'cause me and him wanted to play, and when I asked him why he didn't do it, he was like, "'Cause I'm shy." I almost laughed. He looked right into my eyes when he said it and looked all innocent and stuff. It was so dang funny.    g2g    -Jak

      My life in one word:  Stressing.   I don't know what's wrong with me.  I'm so uptight about everything.  I'm scared to death of going to public school.  I'm literally counting the days.  I know it won't be bad.  I'll do fine.  But it'll be so different..... so weird........  ahhhhhhhhh.  *hides under the bed*.  Sure, I want to go.  At the begining of the summer, this very situation was my dream.  I wanted to go to public school so bad, but wanted my parents to make the decision so if I didn't like it, it wouldn't be my fault.  So here I am.  Sheesh, Serena, make up your mind.  What do you want.  I guess that's the problem, I don't know what I want.  Who I want to be.  It's scary when you know that you could be anyone, anything you wanted to be, and have to choose.  You can only put off your desicion so long.     Wait, I might hesitate    Am I a minute to late?    This pressure's got me lettin', go    What if I'm wrong, will I still carry on    And end up where I belong    I've never felt this way before      Work was fun today.  I love those kids.  They're so awesome.  Just when you decide they are driving you insane, they do something and you love 'em even more.  Like Brandon, I hated Brandon at the beginging of the camp.  Such a punk rebel.  Know I like him alot.  Steven - I've always like Steven.  How could you not like Steven.  He always yells, "Serena!"  when I walk into the room.  He shows off for me on the diving board.  Gotta love that kid.      Yesterday it was Japan day.  It was hecka fun.  We made sushi, and oragami, and played soccar (not Japenese, but to heck with that)  Soccar was hecka fun.  James kept puting is feet on my lap afterwards when we were sitting on the bench.  Then he took of my shoes and threw them around.  And attacted me.  So me and Hilary told him to go bug Brian.  So they litterally attacted him.  tee hee.  We were like, "sorry, dude, wasn't my idea (i mean, it was.... but....)"  haha.     Had my first guitar lesson today.  Mom told Marsha Roby I wanted to learn guitar, so Mrs.  Roby offered to give me some tips.  She's really nice.  So I can play He's Got the Whole World now.  buahahaha.  Beat that, why don't ya!!!!  tee hee    I think I'll go play my guitar now.      -Jak

      Peace and quiet.  Yesterday I was so stressed out.  It just seems like stuff is hitting me that I'm not prepared for and no one is letting me alone to figure it out.  The livingroom is no longer my sancuary I can hide out in.  Kevin and Eric and Clarisa sit on the couch all day long and I can't do anything on the computer without them reading it or look like they're reading it.  I'm trying to work on my novel and this other writing excercise thing, but I don't want to write when they're looking.  So I'm taking advantige of the fact that it is early and no one is up yet.  I made a really really really yummy smoothie (peaches, and rasberry yogurt, and sugar, and orange juice, and icecubes, yummy!!!)    Aww, darn,  Everyone's getting up now...    Anyway.  I had a somewhat good day yesterday, and a somewhat bad day.  The good part was that I got a guitar (classical, Jeff gave it to me).  So I'm totally excited about that.  I just need to get some stuff to play it and I'm all set.  And I got a goldfish named Famous.  It is our new band mascot.  tee hee.  I'm supposed to give it to Amy, but I think I'll just keep it and buy her a new one.  :D.  I think Famous is gonna die anyway... boohoo.  AND (yeah, it was a good die, sorta), I won a really awesome fishy tie!!!!  See, me and ashley had to answer this question from Mark, and who ever guessed the answer won.  I guessed it in like 5 minutes flat, so I got the tie.  Here's the question:  There is a number that when  you multiply the number by any other number and then add all the digits in the product together, the resulting number is either the original number or a product of it (I think that's how it goes....)      But the bad news was that I was totally stressed and ticked all day.  The twins totally got on my nerves, I didn't have a single minute all day when I was alone (a big issue for me), and I was depressed just becuase, and I was totally stressing over going to public school this year.  I'm really scared.  Be careful what you pray for, you just might get it.  :D  Yeah..... So I'm totally scared.  You might think, waz da big deal?  But for me, it is a big deal.  I have never been in any sort of school in my entire life, people!!!!  And I don't know alot of the people... and....... and..... and.....  So I'm freaked.  Totally new world out there.      G2G.  Work time.......  gotta blow dry my hair.  TTYL  ~Jak the stressed out

      yeah, work was fun again today.&nbsp; I love working at that summer camp!!&nbsp; Today was Travelling Tuesday, so we 'went' to Africa.&nbsp; Me and Kaiah and Brian played the African version of checkers and stick ball for the entire time.&nbsp; Brian always won, 'cause when you weren't looking he'd change all the pieces.&nbsp; Show off.&nbsp; Stick ball was a ball, I'm so bad at it.&nbsp; It was pathetic watching me try.&nbsp; But it was fun anyway.&nbsp; Brian was pitcher every time 'cause he was the only one who could pitch worth anything.&nbsp; I think I hit the ball a grand totall of three times in the hundred times I attempted in bettween groups of kids.&nbsp; Then Brian hit the ball on the roof, so Sue told him to climb up and get it but, "don't let any one see you do it, or I'll be busted."&nbsp; So he climbes up and saunters accross the roof, in full view.&nbsp; Sue was like, "why don't you just hang a neon sign up there?&nbsp; Didn't any one ever teach you to sneak?!"&nbsp; It was funny.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I ate homemade peanut butter and a tiny little piece of mango (pray to God that I don't have an alergic reaction).&nbsp; Good stuff.&nbsp; Haven't eten mango in soooo long.&nbsp; Love the stuff.&nbsp; Talked about movies and music.&nbsp; Brian was shocked that I thought Scary Movie was retarded and that country music is&nbsp;from the devil (I didn't quite put it like that... hehe).&nbsp; So he's gonna bring his cd player tomorrow to convert me.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp; Nice try.&nbsp;&nbsp;An we arm wrestled, Brian beat me, and we played mercy, I beat Kaiah, and we played drums and clapping rhythm stuff.&nbsp; Fun fun fun.&nbsp; Tomorrow we go swimming.&nbsp; And I really need a new bathing suit too..... &nbsp; Signing off - Simply Jak

      was fun.&nbsp; I had a blast.&nbsp; We didn't go swimmin', instead we went to the park and had a big water balloon war.&nbsp; I taught them the rules to the water wars we do at camp.&nbsp; It wasn't as fun as camp though, obviously, 'cause there's only 20 kids, most of whom are under the age 9.&nbsp; But I was team captin, so I had fun anyway.&nbsp; Brian was the other captain and we totally creamed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haha.&nbsp; He is such a showy offy flirt.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; Me and him took all the kids out to the play ground after we got back to play basketball and soccar and he soooo showed off the entire time.&nbsp; Especially when we were playing basketball.&nbsp; He elbowed me too and then opologized.&nbsp; He creamed my team that time.&nbsp; And then we played soccar and our gollies stunk like somethin' else.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kids were all tired and hot, so they just stood around and it was basically me and Brian one on one.&nbsp; It was hecka fun.&nbsp; I creamed Brian that time.&nbsp; Oh, and I hit Jason where it hurts with the soccer ball.&nbsp; He got all mad at me and the other little boys were all making a big deal out of it and stuff.&nbsp; They acted like I aimed at his lower torso or something.&nbsp;I'm like, "Whatever".&nbsp;&nbsp;It was funny.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Then we went back inside and Brian sat next to me&nbsp;then I'd move and&nbsp;he'd sit next to me agian.&nbsp; &nbsp;We drew eyes and stuff on this piece of paper and told riddles and stuff.&nbsp; Pretty fun.&nbsp; Chelsea made up this riddle about paint, and then Brian told a really lame one that was pretty funny even though it was lame.&nbsp; Well...

      Since Ashes (it was ashes, wasn't it?) posted her little snide comment, I'll confess.&nbsp; The song was about someone in particular.&nbsp; Actually, it's about two people in particular, I dunno, maybe even more peeps then that.&nbsp; I won't mention any names since *ahem* some of you already guessed one of the people.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; The chorus is about a best friend I had in San Fransisco, I haven't seen her in forever and we've grown apart.&nbsp; The two lines are, of course, about that other someone. &nbsp; Went to see Spiderman2 with Hans, and Gi, and Ashes yesterday.&nbsp; What an awesomely great movie!!!&nbsp; It has the best special affects of any movie I have seen.... Perhaps with the exeption of LOTR, but those are a different kind of effect.&nbsp; It had really good acting too.&nbsp; Toby Mcguire (sp?) rocks!!!!&nbsp; It's reallllllly intense if you watch it in a movie theater.&nbsp; We were sitting like right under the speakers.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Lots of good quotes in that movie too.&nbsp; "Hi... Hi.... This is really heavy."&nbsp; or "Hi?&nbsp; What's hi?&nbsp; Can I spend it?"&nbsp; hehehe.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After that we went to Walmart so that I could buy a tankini, but NOOOO, all they had was lame looking one pieces designed for... er... large people... and bikinis.&nbsp; I contemplated a bikini but... *evil cackle*&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; "The biggest piece of fabric on it is the how to wash tag."&nbsp; lol &nbsp; And then we got sandwiches at Subway.&nbsp; Love that place.&nbsp; Had a terrioky (shut up, I know I can't spell)&nbsp;chicken like always.&nbsp; Lots of fun stuff.&nbsp;  &nbsp; so ya....&nbsp; I'll sign off now...

      I'm bored.  What else can I say.  I still have to finish buttons for Joanna's website....  A task I'm dreading to do as I've already made like 3 sets that didn't work.  Work was a nightmare.  It was Traveling Tuesday, so the theme today was Mexico.  Sue set us teenage councelers to play this game with rotating groups of kids.  It was a little like Scatorgories - or however you spell that.  The problem was, the kids were like 5-6 years too young for the game.  Most of them can't hardly write their name.  So it was extreemly painful - even when we changed the game from writing to verbal.  Something like slowly having your eyelashes pulled out one by one.  The guachimoli (how in the world DO you spell that?) was good though.  Yummy stuff.  I ate like a gallon of the stuff.  So... Yeah...    I wrote a song today.  Someday I'll add music, 'cause I like the words.  I know you are all gonna ask who it's about, so I'll answer here:  It's about no one in particular.  haha.  I might still add more to it... Maybe...  But anyway... Here it is:  Where are you tonight Do you sit and think of me As you turn off the light Who do you see Inside your mind Flitting across your memory Am I all but left behind Will you remember me Do you wish that I stood near Do you remember when...  Chorus: Do you remember when we walked together Along the road and laughed together When we lay on the grass side by side Looked up at they sky together Watched the clouds go by  together Slip across the wide blue sky And we were together  Would you care if you knew How much I wonder And think of you 'Cause I remember the way you'd smile You made me laugh The world would light up for a while Do you still know who I am Do you remember when....

      I am bored.  And tired.  I wish someone would come on the internet.... Like Katie....  I wanna talk to Katie......  haha.  Nothin' mucho grande is going on.  It's a saturday, I slept in.  Job's doing great.  For those of you who don't know, I'm working at a day camp at the local elementry school.  There's like 25 kids.  It's been fun.  We go swimmin' at copper creek camp swimmin' pool almost every day.  It's been great.  And i get paid like 500, so that makes it extra sweet.  I've been practicing my dive at the pool, it's getting better.  I should have Brian teach me his dive.  He can do this loop in the air and then come down in a perfect dive.  He just hangs in the air for like 3 seconds before coming down.  It's really amazing.  I tried to do it when he dared me, and got a really bad water burn on my thighs.  Then I ran into the side of the pool and blacked out for a sec.  I was goin' really fast.  Lucky I didnt' get a black eye.  I was accient prone that day.  lol.

      Just got back from the Buck's lake camp.  It was good.  Just good, not as good as Schol Camp, which was awesome.  I supose the other girls who went would slap me if they heard me say it was just good, but they don't really have any other camp experiences to compare it too.  The camp grounds were pretty basic.  Really basic.  We stayed in bug infested barns, which wasn't as bad as it sounds.  Played crazy games and rock repelled.  Games like Ultimate Frizbee with a frozen ham.  haha.  Fun stuff like that.  The preacher dude was really boring, I thought.  The only night that was something like interesting was when he preached on purity.  He got pretty fired up.  The music team was awesome.  Great stuff.    I found this totally nifty site where you can get themes for your computer.  http://www.themexp.org/  Pretty cool.  Lots of mac themes and stuff.  Nifty.  So yeah..... Nothing mucho else to say.  Except I'm sooooo tired I could.... i don't know what I could do, but I'm totally tired.    Signing off- Ja.... *yawn*....CK

      Today was the second to the last day of lots of stuff. To Kevin and Eric being here, till we go camping, and the second to the last day of camp. Had a fun time at Sue's camp today. I love all the kids there. Went swimmin' all day long 'cause there weren't many peeps there. Chelsea didn't show. Brian was like an hour late and when he showed he was dead tired. I wonder why. He wasn't in a very good mood either.  Oh! There was this guy from copper creek there, he was like 16 and had cool sk8ter boi curly hair, and he was wearing these totally ugly, colorful short shorts. It was SOOOO funny!! He walks past us councilers and we're all staring at him. He turns around and says to us, "Just to let you guys know, I don't usually wear these." I guess it was some inside joke, or a dare or something. It was pretty funny though. They barly reached his finger tips. buahahaha. For Mandy and Ashes: catagory=slug. hehehehe.  My dives were really really bad today. Nothing that felt even remotly like flying, and that's what a good dive's s'possed to feel like. Sat around mainly and teased people. It was fun.  Here's a few songs I've written lately:  -Victim-  She's so quiet/So alone/She wonders if/Light hurts her bone/She lies down her head/And wants to die/Can't go on/Breaths her last sigh/  He sits in the hallway/Kids moving past/Tears in his heart/Soul in a cast/Can't understand Where they all went/Just want to stop/They circumvent  These people/These lives/Just want to die/Give up/Give in/Wisper inside/Hope is gone/Victim  They lean up/Against grey walls/Box their minds/Echo in halls/'Give in'/'Give up'/Willing victims/Every one  Observer outside/Watches them lie/Betray themselves/'Wait to ask why'/Pain in His heart Tears in His eyes/Calls to them softly/Rebuilding their lives  -Censored-  (slightly humorous, cynical song.  tee hee.  Based on True Story)  I saw you today/I just wanted to flip you off/Tell you what I really think you are/But I didn't 'cause I wanted/To impress the guy you were with  Yeah/Sometimes it makes me mad/To see what you've become/Yeah/Sometimes I think you need/Some one to slap you real hard/And bring you back to reality/Yeah/How much longer can you run/Away from me/Turn and face-  I saw you today/Skating down the road/Trying to pretend/You didn't have a care/Who do you think you are?  Yeah/Sometimes I just wanna scream/Stomp and shout/Yeah 'Cause the words I would use/Just couldn't be put in this song/It'd be one big BEEEEP Yeah/How much longer will you run/Away from reality/Turn and face/Me  I saw you today/I thought I would wave/You turned your head and kept on talking/I went on my way and kept on talkin'/But I can't give up on you  Signing off  Jak - poet
