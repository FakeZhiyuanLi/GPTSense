      Its been a few days since my last update, probably because not a lot really happened.   My awesome dinner plans with ryan fell through on thursday, it made me sad. But he cheered me up, so thats good.   My france trip is 29 days and counting! I'm really excited but the trip home is gunna be a little scary. I guess I have to take a train from Brest in Brittany to Paris (which is like taking a train from the very far west edge of texas to the middle of texas)... by myself... take a taxi from the train station to a hotel... by myself... and check myself in to the hotel where I'll stay... by myself. eep! I need to improve on my french because i dont remember anything from french III. 'Je voudrais beze' is what i was told to say when checking into the hotel. for those of you that know french, thats the worst thing you can say to check yourself into a hotel and for that matter, the worst thing you could say to any french speaking person.   Here's a lesson for all people: don't make assumptions of people you don't know and haven't taken the time to get to know them. It will lead to people getting frustrated. Also, dont go along with what people tell you about someone. Most of the time it isnt true and it just spreads incorrect information about the person. So please, grow up, punch yourself in the face, and stop making assumptions.  ::kuff::

      Good evening all  ah what a stressful week its going to be! I worked 3 to 10 tonight, and it was busier than expected and the new girl doesnt seem to understand that talking on the phone for an hour is not acceptable.   There is a slight (but serious) miscommunication between a few people which includes the assumption that i drove myself home drunk a couple weeks ago. Which entirely is not factual. here are a few reasons: - i dont drink - even if i did choose to drink, i had friends with me that would take possesion of my keys before i even thought of putting my shoes on to leave the house. (thank you mike)  - lastly, im more intellegent than that.   just thought i'd clear that up.   And much love goes to jamie for lookin out for me and making sure that i get punched in the face if that would ever happen =D thanks!   I'm off to finish modern global. nighty night all   $ kuff $

      Okay, we didnt exactly get nuked, but pretty darn close...   - I found out from a reliable source (my brother) that there was a real bar brawl in the b dubs in champlin on friday night. People being thrown across the room, tables being flipped, and beer bottles smashed over heads. Oh how I wish I was there to see it!   - Tornadoes ripped through. The sky hypnotized me. It was sweet.   - jaimos movin in fo sho! She might bring Ozzy (her cat) with her. My cat may just eat hers, we shall see how this will turn out! But either way it will be fun.   this is my last post of the day so night night all. I'm off to do some homework

      Happy mothers day all  I got up at bout 8:30, took a shower and got all clean and pretty and took off to go to Ryans work to drop off some McDonalds... however, i missed an exit and got lost, go figure. So i ended up in Egypt and asked someone for directions, and of course they were wrong. So I got lost again. But with my incredible intellegence, I figured it out on my own and finally got to Target in Brooklyn Center. I got there and the poor kid was so busy! I felt so bad for him but I hope the Egg McMuffin made him a lil happier.   So I came home, helped my dad fix the dent in my car because someone decided that it would be funny to kick my door in... bastards.   So my day hasnt been too eventful, but if we get nuked or something huge like that happens, i'll update again.   word.  Kuff

      Im gettin this thing up and running again!   here was my past two days:  friday: school, sleep till 7, ryans till 12, home, sleep  Saturday: Majkens at 11:30 to make music video for youth issues (i looked totally sexy on top of my car playing my guitar by the way), home, work @ 2:30 till 8, ryans till 12, now im home!   jaimo wants to live with me for two months for acceptable reasons... which would be freakin awesome! considering she is superior and what not and we would have a grand ol time being roomies. However, i must speak with the authority figures on the subject because technically this ISNT my house... derp.    Tomorrow is mom's day (and MY mom's birthday... how cool is that) so heres my plan for tomorrow: wake up early, go to McDonalds and get Ryan some chow for breakfast, grab my mom some flowers and a card on the way home and continue the mothers day festivities. Then homework for the rest of the freakin day. i have a ton!   but anyway. hoes need their sleep. peace!   ryan = thaumaturgic [::dreams of you::]   night all ::hugs for all and a kiss for ryan::   $ kuff dawg $

      It's a long one, but worth the time you take to read it...    The Culture of the Nacirema People.   Dr. E. Ron Eous, of the international Institute of Geographic Studies, has recently prepared a preliminary report on a newly discovered tribe of people in the rainforest known as the Nacirema. Dr. Eous is an anthropologist, a scientist who studies the culture of humans. His observations show the Nacirema tribe to be a strange and complex people with many contradictions. While he does not fully understand this unusual tribe, he has recorded many of their customs.  The Nacirema have perfected the art of making paper from wood pulp and are so proud of this achievement that paper has become one of the most valuable and cherished things in their culture. Those who are able to make and accumulate a great deal of paper are considered to be the wisest and most powerful people in the society. It is still not known why they place so much value on something that is relatively easy to make, but it is known that they will often decorate the paper with paintings of great leaders and prayers to their god.  The religion of this tribe is very difficult to understand because the Nacirema soon to have many different gods. Scientists are unsure if they are all part of the same religion, or if there are many religions in the culture. It is known that what the Nacirema say they believe is often very different from the way they act. Almost all of their gods instruct the people to treat the other members of the tribe with love. Yet, it is known that this culture is one of the most violent that anthropologists have ever discovered. They will fight and even kill each other over articles of clothing, decorated paper scraps, and minor incidents of various kinds. Many of the tribal games result in serious injury, paralysis, and even death. These rituals are frightening to watch because often those watching will get worked into such a frenzy that they start fighting among themselves.  They are a tribe which is very wealthy according to their own standards, but scientists have found that some Nacirema, many of them children, have no homes and not enough to eat. It is thought that the Nacirema consider these people to be unfit outcasts. They do not know what to do with these undesirables, so they keep them separate from the rest of the tribe. When the tribe goes to war, it often uses these outcasts as fighters.  The Nacirema place a great deal of emphasis on their own personal beauty. The women use paints made from the blubber of whales or the fat of animals to color their faces, and many also use sharp sticks to poke holes in the ears, nose, eye lids, tongue, and other body parts. Men do not generally use the face paints, but many show their masculinity by scraping off the top layer of their facial skin with a sharp blade. Both the men and women like to smear on a strong smelling, greasy substance which comes from the glands of a deer. The women will also apply a substance made from fish scales, which the men find very attractive. Also, it is not unusual for the most elite man and women to go to the village witch doctor in order to have parts of their bodies cut away. Many of the Nacirema consider this to be a privilege and will work many months and even years to order to satisfy the demands of the witch doctor.  Their dietary habits are varied. However, while the culture as a whole seems to admire those who show signs of prolonged and repeated fasting, many of the people are quite gluttonous. One of the favorite meals of the Nacirema is a mashed wheat and water paste that is baked with curdled milk and sliced pig intestines.  The Nacirema Also share a strange belief that no one is really responsible for the things that they do. They believe that all actions can be attributed to forces that occurred in the past. They spend a great deal of time examining the actions of their ancestors for clues to explain their own behavior. As a result they have developed a complex code of denial which allows them to justify any behavior that is detrimental to the society. If a person can produce a reasonable excuse for wrong behavior, then that behavior is often forgiven. One of their chief forms of entertainment is the public confession of sins, indiscretions, sexual encounters, or other private matters.  What makes them so difficult to understand is that they are so contradictory. For example, the Nacirema love to keep animals in their huts and will show them a great deal of love and affections. Yet scientists have discovered that they kill more cats and dogs than any other people in the world. On one hand many people are not allowed to share the wealth of the tribe, but on the other hand, the tribe will often provide food and shelter to those who have been affected by disaster. They are willing to do battle with any other tribe, yet it is their own people they fear the most, because they are so violent to each other. They discriminate against many members of their own tribe, yet their highest tribal law is that no one person is better than another. It may take many years before anthropologists will understand this strange people.     now, concentrate on the tribe name: Nacirema  look at it backwards, it spells 'American'

       Wakeup Call      Heres a wake up call for all of you ignorant Americans who think high school is the hardest four years of your life:   "Omiya Junior High [in central Japan], for instance, not only stipulates the uniform but also bans wristwatches, hair ribbons, curled hair, bleached hair, perfume, scented deodorant, earrings, makeup, money, non-standard school bags, or anything else that could set one student apart from another. The school even bans colorful shoes, although footwear is left at the entrance and exchanged for identical slippers that students and teachers wear inside the school building."

          ::shrug::  I took the boyfriend out to dinner at Khan's Mongolian Barbeque. He loved it which is good! Next time we're going to Pob Danlos - best fajitas in the f-in world. I suggest you all take a trip there and get the chicken fajitas!  Then we came back to my house and took some crazy gangsta pictures on my web cam. If I can figure it out, I'll put some pics on here.   Jaimo got her hair cut. dear lord its the cutest thing I ever did see. She looks adorable! damn skippy, Jaimo! I think it makes her look more like Ozzy (her cat... not the washed out rocker)   I went to the doc today. I have to take allergy medicine now hence the spring attacks my system with pollen and blooming trees. gr.   night all   ::kuffly wuffly::

       urlLink    I was walking along the road with two friends.  The sun was setting.  I felt a breath of melancholy -  Suddenly the sky turned blood-red.  I stopped, and leaned against the railing, deathly tired - looking out across the flaming clouds that hung like blood and a sword  over the blue-black fjord and town.  My friends walked on - I stood there, trembling with fear.  And I sensed a great, infinite scream pass through nature - edvard munch &nbsp; urlLink

      The body is real but fake as a mere player wanting what it will never be the golden calf is intimidating  his clothes and jewels are much too fine for she wants to be his muse a puppet with strings, she is  wanting to venture for a new (yet old) emotion cutting her restraints with waterfalls  secretly wanting an old emotion a void filled with control and acquiescence that she loves... fill the void.

      Well I'm back from kansas, "y'all"  it was pretty muggy and humid down there I'd have to say, but considering its may and I've been down there in july and august, it wasnt SO bad. The ride there wasnt terrific, eight + hours in a SUV with 6 other people, two of them being babies. Finding a spot to stretch out and sleep was a chore. My bro-in-law had just recently bought a portable dvd player for the way there so the kids wouldnt get crabby. But according to murphy's law, everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. The dvd player broke for no apparent reason.  So that sucked.   We arrived at our hotel at maybe, 6 or 7 in the evening (we left at 10:30 in the am) My mother and my sister and I went to a dinner that was put together by the grooms parents. Also boring. Then went back to the hotel and went to sleep.   The next day we all got ready and went to my cousin's wedding (thats why I went down to kansas) It was a very pretty ceremony, but very very short. The reception kicked a lot of ass. Haha. Dancin' like mad. Then went back to hotel and slept. heh.   We left the next morning to go home at about 10 and made it back at about 5:45. Once again, tensions build in a vehicle of the Kuffel family.    I cleaned up a little around the house and then went off to Ryan's to have some fun. Jesse was there too. Yeah! We drove around uptown a little bit, went to cheapo, drove some more, then chilled at Jesse's. It was GOOD fun, great fun. I got home at about 3 am. So yeup, its 4:20. Time to sleep. Goodnight everyone!   $kuff money$

They do.
