      Guess I'm still thinking about it    8)      (I'm assuming the other posts on responsibility are under our belt)     So if we find ourselves discouraged by the tough things in our lives or distracted by the enjoyable things in life there is one answer. We have allowed our driving passion for God to either be overwhelmed by either pleasure or pain.       .....either way, we've put another god in charge.     But that's all words....the doing is another thing entirely. Some good questions to ask are these, "Do I love God more than the things in life I enjoy?" and "Do I love God more than I dislike the things that hurt?"     If the answer to both of them is "Yes" than we truly are unconquerable.  See this post -  urlLink Passion        d4l3

      Read what I wrote last night...hope it wasn't confusing....but was thinking more 2day.     The relationship between  driving passion (DP)  and  responsibilities (Rs)  can be seen in so many areas of our lives and @ so many levels.     Because of my  DP  for my family I take on the  Rs  of my job.  The  DP  for my family transfers to a  DP  for my job but not for the job's sake, it is still for the families' sake.  Because I now have a  DP  for my job I take on the  Rs  within my job.  The  DP  for my family transfers to a  DP  for the  Rs  within my job but not for those  Rs ' sake it is for the job's sake but in turn, ultimately, for the families' sake. And so the things my job requires me to do that may be odious to me I have a  DP  to do, not for their sake, but for my families' sake.     And the same way the things in my job I love to do will never replace the  DP  I have for my family because the only reason I am in the position to accomplish them is because my passion for my family drove me there.     It is like the layers of an onion....in some way....I guess :)     So...as we follow God what can come between us unless we choose to exchange our  DP  for him with a  DP  for something else.  Basically, unless we begin to worship something else as God.      And what can drive us from him?  Surely not those things we don't enjoy or that cause us pain!  Our  DP  for God makes those things palatable and as James said we are able to rejoice in the hard places of life. Not because they are hard but because our  DP  for God makes them a desirable thing if they fall within our  Rs .     So....the question then is  ....   What has your  DP ?????  Because that's what you worship.     d4l3     ps - Now u know why I call this Thoughts Crashing :/

       As I was working today I had thoughts about responsibility running around my head. Responsibilities aren't always enjoyed. Sometimes they are but probably an equal time they are not. That got me thinking about whether you are    supposed    to enjoy your responsibilities.  And if you don't are you in the wrong somehow?       I won't bore with the entire thought path it took me to get to my end thoughts and I'll just jump to some of my conclusions.       If I enjoy a responsibility of mine and develop a passion to accomplish it I'm not sure that is a good thing. Say fishing for example. If part of my job is to fish and I grow to absolutely love it, let's say, more than I love my job. In some sense it has replaced my original passion for my job with a passion for fishing. And in some ways my passion for fishing may very well conflict with my passion for my job and my fulfillment of my other responsibilities.       I think a better way is this. To have a passion for your job to such a degree that everything that job entails (whether agreeable to you or not) becomes your passion. But not because of those responsibilities themselves but because you are passionate for your job.       A good example would be a parent working to provide for their children. That may bring responsibilities to the parent they like or dislike but they remain passionate to complete all of them but not because of the responsibilities themselves but because of their passion for their children. In fact, if a parent becomes so passionate for their responsibilities that it replaces their passion for their children aren't they settling for a much lesser life? And short-changing their children (their original passion) in the process?      Well, anyway, that's what I was thinking today. Specifically, my drive to do the things I need to do (whether pleasurable to me or not) should never come from the things (or responsibilities) themselves but from the passion that drives me to them, God's love. And if my drive to do them comes from my love for these responsibilities aren't I serving them instead of G  od?       And with the things I don't like to do (but yet need to do), if my passion continues to be straight from God's heart what is there that I can't do? Absolutely nothing is impossible! That's why Jesus said "Greater things than I have done you will do." Because he knows that his passion enables us to surrender all to him. All that we like and all that we don't.       That's it...if I've confused instead of clarified just chalk it up to someone with too much time on their mind 8)      d4l3

      Without passion what are you? You become the container that people with passion move through. Almost like plumbing. The copper pipe is part of the equation, I guess, but the water that is flowing through the pipe ... that is the moving agent.     When your life lacks passion you are not a mover, you are an exist-er. You are not an achiever, at best, you are an enabler. You are not the gun but the holster.     I guess a response may be "But aren't the pipe and the holster needed?" But I think that just identifies where the analogy breaks down and our fears succeed in convincing us that to never risk is a good thing. Nobody I know grew up thinking that in their wildest dreams they would be the best water boy a Super Bowl team was ever served by.     We dreamt we were in center stage. We dreamt we were the MVP of the team. We dreamt that our influence would reach far. For the large majority of us, we never dreamed to someday be in the hole we've carved out for ouselves. In fact, if we voiced our current state as our dream to our childhood friends we would've been laughed off the playground. Because they were all going to be something really great. They were going to have a real and lasting impact. They were going to change the world.     Well...looks like the world is safe.   :/        ....was gonna end there but...      I'm just not happy with that 'cuz it stinks. I refuse to believe that we can't change things. I refuse to believe that we are just ordinary, mundane, run of the mill, tasteless, insipid, boring, status quo, mediocre, average, powerless, 2nd string, medium, safe, half way, stationary, dull non-issues.     I believe we can matter. I believe we can change it all. I believe we can turn the world upside down. Those who oppose should run. Those who oppose and don't run are just dumb. I think we hold in us a power that our bodies should struggle under the weight of. Torrent would be a good word to describe it.     So...I guess I'm just tired of the middle ground huh?  Whatever I am I'm guessing it will be fun!        d4l3

      "One of the worst things about going is the leaving behind."    It is almost like the force of gravity, as if it had fingers and hands physically clutching you, begging you to stay.    It is almost a betrayal or denial of the place you've been.  I guess those are some drastic words, but if the place you are leaving is not a pleasant place than you are glad for the betrayal and the denial.      d4l3

      ...about sacrifice that is.      Kind of amazing that in our cultural christian belief system we take the example of Jesus' sacrifice and call it godly to live exactly the opposite of it.    Let me explain... Jesus poured his life out in obedience to what he knew would be our only salvation.  Peter said that he set an example for us to follow.  Peter, Paul, and the other apostles understood this and in their lives as in Jesus' the more they obeyed the worse (from the outside it appeared at least) their lives got, until there was literally no more to give.    ...but in the church today we believe that the more we obey and sacrifice the more blessing, and health, and wealth we will be showered with.  God would never expect us to give it ALL would he?    I guess now I have to choose ... Jesus, Peter, Paul, and the apostles just didn't realize the fulness of all they could've had with God -- or -- we've (the church) been fooled into believing the exact opposite of what Jesus was trying to display to us....kind of a tough question huh?    ...not really.       d4l3

      When did self-sacrifice come to mean - Giving up the things that you don't want or need.     We have believed a lie. The apostles scream with their lives that  self-sacrifice is to give up those things that you desperately need to  live. To spend yourself like money in God's kingdom until you have  nothing left to spend.   Maybe this is why the church in America is in decline but throughout  the world it is not.  Have we sold out some core values that  belong central to the faith?  And if we have, what is the state of  our foundation?   Don't know if that is new and revolutionary or old school :)   d4l3

      "Don't be afraid, it just might work."  Heard those lyrics in a song I was listening to today.  It really struck me.  That is a great attitude.  In one sentence it does a good job of encapsulating what it means to be risky, passionate, adventurous, self-sacrificing, and creative.  Circumstances dictate to us so often how we should behave.  How about instead we decide to dictate marching orders to our fears and to our circumstances?  What if the possibility of failure wasn't able to stop us?  What if we refused to listen to what our circumstances were telling us we needed to listen to?  What if we decided to listen to something else?    There is a voice that says "All things are possible."  How about we listen to that?  How about we begin to move because there is a chance that we will do really great things for God instead of sitting because there is a chance we will fail?  I know which of the 2 I wanna be.  d4l3

      Had a long talk w/ my wife (Jen) last nite.  Was trying to express my desire for passion, not only in my life but in the life of people around me.  I think I've decided that passion is more attractive than possibly even beliefs.  I think this is probably why God says  "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of My mouth."   I think, like him, I am beginning to find the lack of passion not simply insipid but repulsive.  At the same time, I want nothing more than the passion in me to spread to those around me.  To see a similar fire burning in another only fuels my own.  Fire's hunger is unique.  As it is fed its hunger grows not diminishes.  A vacuum's hunger as it is fed removes the vacuum and its hunger.  But a fire as it is fed only increases and desires more.  Someone (Nicky Gumbel) used the examples of coals from the fire.  As they are isolated one from another they become cold, but put them together and they only increase in heat and intensity.  Sometimes I feel for my wife.  She has to listen to so many of my unfinished/incomplete/partial/confusing thoughts.  And then again, w/o her I just might explode! ;)   d4l3 (dale)

      Realized I didn't explain anything about myself yet...so to those of you who don't already know me pretty well, here goes.  I spend my days (and evenings) pastoring.  I am one of 4 pastors @ a church in RI of about 280 on a weekly basis.  I have been married just shy of 17 years now.  And that has blessed us w/ 4 children.  My children range in age like this - 14, 11, 6, 3  B4 pastoring I was a carpenter for about 14 yrs.  (And yes, I did get my hands dirty)  Now after 5 years of pastoring I must say that my hands are much softer 8)  The reason for this blog (btw blog means Web Log)   is posted below.  I am on my way "further up and further in", as some may say.  d4l3

      Wanted to document some things that are changing...about me, my life, my thoughts.  Thought this would be a great place to do it.  Writing definitely gives me a sense of expression and completion.  It is the 'beginning' to the 'finishing' of a thought.  The 'ending' to the 'finishing' of a thought is the doing...or the becoming.  ---And that is my goal.  To make these crashing thoughts something other than random spikes of adventurous longings.  To make the thoughts something other than a desire to feel risk and danger.  But to make them part of my character and being.  In hopes that in doing so I become more and more like the author ( I believe 8) ) of these thoughts.  That @ the end of the day people would say that the two of us are strikingly similar.  Who knows?  Maybe that will even happen.  ...and so it begins  d4l3  ---by the way (btw) that's dale 8)

      I've been delaying posting and while I have I've realized something about myself. I have this compunction not to open my mouth (or my pen or my keyboard) until I feel like I have an idea completely surrounded. That's why there's been a delay because I have a thought that I don't feel like is finished yet but now I've decided I'm just gonna go for it (pretty darn risky, huh?) even though I don't know where it will end up.  Well here's the thought ....  On vacation I started thinking about being lost. {I won't say why 8)} As I began to think about it I began to think about how we use that word but we don't always use it to define the proper situations.  urlLink Lost  means "To wander from or become ignorant of or to lose one's way."  Basically, to not know where you are.  The reason I started thinking about this was the situation of the "lostness" we experienced over vacation. We knew exactly where we were. We knew exactly where we were supposed to be. But because we'd taken the wrong way we also knew that we weren't where we were supposed to be. So in one sense we weren't lost at all. We knew exactly where we were. Were we lost or were we wayward?  I think the worst type of "lostness" is when you think you are somewhere that you are not. That always results in complete confusion and helplessness. When I was a kid I had a dream once that I was in my kitchen. When I awoke with it still dark in my room I assumed that I was in the kitchen (gimme a break, I was dreaming!). I got out of bed and went to where the door to the kitchen should've been but it wasn't there. I couldn't find anything that was familiar. I couldn't find the lights because I was looking where they would be in the kitchen. After about 10 mins of confusion and near panic by going around the room bumping into things that shouldn't have been there I finally found a door that shouldn't have been where it was. As I entered the hallway the confusion lifted and I realized that all the time I had been in my room. I was safe at home but utterly lost. I was completely confused and helpless.  In life we sometimes refer to ourselves as lost. I think we use that to make ourselves seem better than what we are. The confusion from my dream left me blameless in my "lostness" because I didn't have any knowledge to navigate in the place I was. I don't think that we are always lost like we say.  When you know where you are and you know where you should be you aren't lost, you are wayward. You are no more lost than a child that skips school and spends the entire day avoiding detection. That child knows where he is and he knows where he should be. He isn't lost he is truant.  Now would I say that we were truant when we were lost on vacation? No because we didn't take the wrong way intentionally. But if, upon discovering where we really were, we still chose to not proceed to where we should be then we would definitely be truant.  As we walk with God and do our best to follow him there will be times when we take the wrong way and it will inevitably lead us to where we shouldn't be. That's lost.  But there will come a time (if we are truly followers of God) that our confusion will be lifted and we will see that we have come to a place that we never should have been. Now we aren't lost anymore because we know where we are and where we should be. If we don't start to move to where we should be, we, at that point, become truant, wayward, and rebellious. We can no longer say we are followers of God because we aren't following him.  I guess what I'm trying to say (remember, I don't feel like this is a completed thought yet) is, let's not use the word "lost" to hide the fact that we are not followers of God. Let's just be honest and say "I'm not where God wants me to be because I don't want to follow him there."  d4l3
