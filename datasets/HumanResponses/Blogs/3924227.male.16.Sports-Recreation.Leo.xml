WAD DID I DO TO MAKE HER DISLIKE ME WAD DID I DO.... for a few weeks... i seems to be happy out side but i m always asking wad did i do man.... just in my heart i was thinking wad should i do with out her is just like without my life...i drink some beers n wine in the night at home alone... thinking ... she dislike me... i should let her live her live happily... seeing her happy is all i got to do.... but sch reopen..... i start to noe that my "FREN" like her.... n he was the same "FREN" that tell my other frenz that she dislike me.... i say to myself OH MY GOD....i saw him flirting with her n alot of other gals.... n i think is she go stead with him.. i will should do something de..... but luckily she rejected him..... n now i was thinking wad should i do.... go n win her heart or wad.... i m not very good in flirting.... i sure lose to him 1 ma... but wad should i do....WILL GOD HELP ME..... or is there anythink i can do... should i go for her or give up........OH MY GOD.....
