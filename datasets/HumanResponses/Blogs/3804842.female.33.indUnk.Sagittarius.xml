      Took Katie to the Dentist a couple of weeks ago and they did the Normal Xrays on her teeth , it was time. I take all my kids to a pediatric Dentist he is a little less stressful for them. Get this he has a WIDE SCREEN TV playing cartoons on Cartoon Network 24\7 and get this they can still watch TV as they are getting their teeth Cleaned. The Dentist has a big screen Tv in the room where they Clean the kids teeth , I think they can fit about 10 kids in that room getting there teeth done and watching scooby doo. I wish I had it that good when I was Growing up!. I did find out though that Katie's adult teeth is growing in Crooked and sideways , showed up on the Panoramic Xrays. the Dentist told me he is hoping that this will straighted out before she looses her baby teeth or she Might need Braces. Like I need another expense! But he said not to worry that the Teeth  might straighted out in time. After all the Cleaning katie comes out and says "my teeth are all Clean"( LOL)she calls the girl that cleans her teeth the Tooth Fairy , strange things is she thinks the tooth fairy cleans her teeth so they will fall out and give her money. Funny how kids think of things!

      Katie had her 3 t ball game today and it is kinda funny. Nothing like a bunch of 6 year old having no idea what they are doing. I got to coach 3 base line today and  I enjoyed that alot. Tomorrow is carpet cleaning day here at the House. I had to call in the "Da boys" from a place from Fiber tech to Suck every stinky spot out of my carpet. so I have been Moving Furniture for two days. Well This week is a slower week for me so i was able to get things taken care of the house like the carpet cleaning. That is about it maybe I can get on this later.

      I never really understood the Term&nbsp; "I can handle anything God can Gives me I just wish he Did not Trust me so Much"&nbsp; Now I think it is Finally Sinking in. He Gave me Two Boys to Love and&nbsp; with Very Unique&nbsp; Medical situations. It has made&nbsp; me a stronger Person and learn to have more Patience. It has Made Me Appreciate&nbsp; a healthy&nbsp; Child. Making any sense?&nbsp; Sometimes Jealousy gets to me when I see Parents "take For granted"&nbsp; a healthy child. Then I Feel Bad because I have Great Kids.&nbsp; Must Be My Mood Tonight. I see so Many Healthy kids Come&nbsp; through the Clinic and then I see my Boys and makes me sad.Even though they are the sweetest kids Ever. I love all my kids Equally and Unconditionally. so Hug Your child tonight and Lots of Kisses... :-)   &nbsp;

      Hearing aides are now Ordered for David and should be getting them next week sometime. Do even go there on how much they cost us! Talk about&nbsp;stressing . Insurance Pays for half but then We have to come up with the Other half. Thank Goodness for Payment Plans! The Place we got them from is a independent place so They shaved off some of the Cost. But we got them For&nbsp; David Before school so that is all that matters. :-)

      Well another work week has started. Andy just found Out at work he has to Go to Austin Tx for some Training to help out the Guys in the Boiler room at work.He will be Getting Certified to work on Electrical switchboards so if somthing happens he will be the one who will get called .He will be Leaving the 2nd week in Aug. So I have to work out Babystitters and do some major sweet talking to Andy's mom to give me a hand while I am Working. I am thinking of taking a day or two off so I can be home so I have to work On my calendar this afternoon. Maybe me and the kids will do some day trips&nbsp; so they will not get too Bored. Nothing like getting a little Over a week notice.  Kids get registerd for school in a couple of weeks and I have to go pay dues and see who they get they Get for teachers. I always Kind of know with David who he will have the next year since he recieves special services from school because only certain teachers only take the Special Ed kids, by the way I hate that word&nbsp; Special Ed like the kids have a disease or something. Hopefully I will only have to put up with this for another year or so because Middle School is right around the Corner for David and Another set or Rules will apply to him.

      Well I decided to delete my last post.. mainly Because of the girls at work have access to this Blogspot and I might have some Questions to answer if it got to the Wrong Person Even if it was not my Fault. Much better day today and in a much, much better Mood. The Other issue is How to deal with a 6 year old that thinks she Knows EVERYTHING? Katie is such a smart kid and nothing Gets by her. Anyone know how to deal with a little Girl who thinks Name Calling is OK? and nobody's Feelings is Going to be Hurt? I tried already to talk with her but she is my EYE ROLLER. SHe is though Getting better since I started taking things away from her and etc.. ANy other suggestions would be Helpful.

      David was talking to me today and said that he Wanted to Go to Mary's Resturant this is a Family resturant in town that serves Really good Hamburgers. Any how I told him he has been there before and he insists he has not and I told him he went there with his Grandparents (Andy's Parents) and tasted these hamburgers and then he suprised me and said that his Short term Memory Must keep him From Remembering. Where does he Get this Vocabulary? I am in aww that he can come up with this stuff.  Katie has been eating me out of house and Home and I took Her Snacks away from her,not all but some so she will eat more at Meals. She asked me today for something and I told her to wait she Looked at me and Asked Me straight in the Face and asked me If it was because she was getting FAT and getting a Belly? Gosh can't I do anything Right? David is telling me his Short term  memory is shot and Katie is telling Me I will not give her snacks because of her Belly. GEEZ!!! she asks Me every day now  for three days if Her belly has gone down so she can Have more snacks.. Kinda scary that she Is Noticing this at age 6. WOW

      If Those who Do not Know What This is there is a Ton OF Links If you Go to Web MD and Enter this in Or Go to Google.   My Youngest Son has this and If want some Reading Or Just Curious Go GOOGLING (HARDY HAR).  It Basically is when Your Bowels have No Nerve endings and Basically Dead. In alot of cases That section have to Be Surgically Removed in my Son's case. He is Such a Hudge blessing and a Miracle!  Werid thing is, is that this Is a INHERITED DIsease and Most Parents do Not know of this Disease or Do not know they are Carriers until after the Child is Diagnosed. ANdy and I never Knew Of this Until he had the Diagnosis. Kinda strange isn't it? Ultrasound Cannot even detect this or any Blood work that they have can Diagnosis this. You Would think that in this day and Age they would Be able To know ahead of time.

      I have Noticed I nap more on Sunday than any other Day of the Week. I think it is because I run all week to T-ball and Errands  with the Kids I am just COmpletely Wiped Out.I even Really did not want to work Saturday because I wanted to be outside in the sun In a chair asleep. That is what I get for staying up past 1am. The Dog I am Keeping Is Finally going Home today Poor thing Misses her Family . But Went to Church this Morning and When I got Home The Garbage can was Knocked over and she had Went Wild and ate left overs I had in the Garbage including a Chicken Leg. Then When I called for her she Did Not coming running so I paniced that she Did not come, I finally found her with her Head Under My Bed and Her Butt sticking out thinking I would Not noticed she was trying to hide From Me. I scolded her then I took her for a walk, I thought she Might haave choked or something.   David's face is Healing from the Road Rash he has maybe next time he wil Learn to use his feet for a brake instead of his Face. At least he has not scared of his Scooter he still has Been Riding even after he Fell.

      Have to Go back to work today. I am picking up extra shifts at work this summer which I am Glad to get. We Had a extra day off due to the 4th and I enjoyed being home with the Kids. My Neighbor Girl has Been coming over to babysit  for me when I need to go in, SO I have Been Very Happy to have her this summer to watch the Kids. Katie and David Love her to come over they seem to enjoy having someone else watch them  for a change.  Katie went to a Birthday party over the Weekend she Loved it ! It was a swimming party with her Friends from school and then the Parents shot Fireworks off for them at dark so she did not get home until around 9:30.  I am glad she is My social Butterfly she needs her friends.

      Well The other day I was Driving to Oshkosh with Kids in tow and I heard David talking to Katie about His TWIN Cousins that he has that are 2 and a half years old and we just visited them about 2 weeks ago. Well as they Were Talking he told Katie that they Were Called CLONES  because they Looked so much Alike, By the Way I almost choked because I was Laughing so hard. I had to try to explain to my 10 year old their is a Difference between a Clone and a Twin and his Cousins were Definatly twins. David has such a knowledge of trying to learn something new and trying to use Big words to impress his Little sister. Bless his heart he is trying!

      Motovation... HMMM. I have none today. I realized after one pm today that kids had not had lunch, then realized no Bread for sandwichs. ERR. So I went and picked up some bread and milk etc. and Funny thing is , i just went in and picked some of the mess up from them making their OWN Sandwichs, this is a big thing in my house anyway they need to do their own without my help. I have 4 pieces of Lunch meat left from a smaller Brand new container. (Vultures) . Oh well David is a big eater anyway so I cannot complian to much.. but that means grocery store visits more often, and that is where my Motovation is null and void today. I still have to work tonight I hope it finds me before 4pm tonight or I am in some trouble.  Andy is taking Katie Fishing tomorrow he has More guts than i do taking a chatting 6 year old Girl with him. Good Luck to him . and God be with him. Katie can talk someone to death and then some.No kidding ! At least he will not be bored. I let her pick her Drinks for the Fishing trip for tomorrow she Picked Gatorade for Her and Her Daddy. AWWWW.. Details tomorrow on if Dad Survives the Trip. (lol)

      My darling 6 year old came to me today and told me "Mommie I have a problem" I asked her what looking puzzled at her. She showed  her belly and she said Look.  laughing I said I know that is your Belly and she told me  that it was getting pretty big. I pointed out that she just finished eating and of course she is going to feel full. I also told her that she is getting older and her belly needs to adjust to her growing body. She is so cute though on how she is concerned about little things. It has to be a girl thing. :-)  Andy took the kids shopping  YES ,I said shopping to a Mall in Illnois right over the border and they had a great time! Andy had a buddy with him they went to check out a great sporting goods store I call it the MAN'S Store it is so big that they sale boats in the store and bait and tackle. I went with a friend of mine to another mall  I had the 3 year old and it was great just having to keep up with one child. That made me feel strange just keeping up with one child.
