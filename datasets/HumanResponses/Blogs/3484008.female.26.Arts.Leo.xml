      To fall in love, to die, to sleep, perchance to dream. Ah, crap! Did you know that as a result of The Fall that a woman's desire will be for her husband? I was listening to U2 the other day and Bono sang the following, "And a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle" if that is true, why do I keep leaping out of the water at every passing cyclist? This ancient, natural urge to marry and mother is threatening my young, adventurous urges. Maybe it was because of all the new mothers that I hung out with yesterday. What a simply beautiful life it would be to finally settle down...  But after I left the haze of immediate temptation I remembered the fabulous opportunities that lay before me. It is not my choice whether or not I will get into this rock band, so it isn't a matter of me simply deciding to do it. I will give it my best shot, though, and if the walls slam down in front of me then I will once again change direction. But in the meantime I feel I have come to a place where dozens of roads vein out before me. One of the signs reads, "Stay Put Rd." This road apparently leads to getting a second job where I am, saving up money for CNA licensing, possibly moving into the world of health care, and then it disappears into the fog of the future. I would like to assume that the skills I would gain as a beginner-nurse would serve God in the mission field that I would inevitably choose if rockstardom is not, in fact, my destiny.   Another sign reads, "Leap of Faith Ave." and I can't tell if that yellow diamond-shaped sign further down reads, "Not a Through Street" or "Icy" or "Falling Rock". I could handle the ice and the rocks because I can handle Rock N' Roll, but if the road ends in a giant brick wall I don't have the TNT to venture onward. Plus, if there is a wall then I can take the hint. But who wants to back track?  The Clash song is playing on the radio of my conscience, "Should I stay or should I go now?!?! Oh you've got to let me know!" I am using that song as a prayer. Dozens of roads have diverged in my wood. I always take the least traveled roads and they end in cliffs, canyons, and giant rock walls. Come to think of it, the roads that look the most traveled always have their own overgrown side roads. Then I manage rationalize taking those grassy, untread ones out of sick curiosity. So here I am, 25 years-old, creditless, homeless, skill-less, and overflowing with dreams and disappointments. What do I have to show for it? Oh, I can write one hell of an essay on my life! What use is that to the world except in the form of a song heard by millions? "And I still haven't found what I'm looking for..." A song that's already been written, go figure! Maybe I should stick to listening to music, rather than creating it...  I have seen so many deserted pathways and have collected priceless wisdoms and experiences. All that veering and climbing could have taught me two things: 1. Less-traveled roads are your area of expertise. Who will travel them if not you? One of these days the road will lead to the Land of Fruition. Never give up on these roads and soon you will find the back door to a very special place that few have discovered........Or 2. There is a reason why people don't take those roads. Because they are smarter than you! Do you see all those people passing you? They haven't stopped to waste time down those little side alleys where gypsies camp and waste time with themselves. Why do you insist on rebelling against your God-given reason? Is it your sick longing to be so different and so significant? Is that a gift or a hindrance to your ultimate goal in reaching Fruition?  I could be a great nurse in a foreign land. I could be an unsung hero whose praise comes from Heaven and not the world. I could be a sung and singing hero who recieves praise from Rolling Stone for Best New Artist. I could be the voice that you can buy with $15.99 or Ticketmaster. I could be the voice that sings to one dying orphan with AIDS who I will painfully miss. Is the rockstar road less traveled? Or is it crowded with egoists like myself waiting for the bouncer to usher us into the party. It may be a shorter road but I am seeing now that it is in fact paved. American youth! Chase your dreams! Chase them right into the spiral pit of reality television. Your dreams are nightmares in disguise. Jim Morrison was a sexy poet whose heart was vacant. He fell headlong into the pit and we long to follow him. But that won't happen to me! I will rise and change the world like Bono, like Madonna, like Paris Hilton, like the Pope! I will soar on mechanical wings until I hit my head on the underside of a cloud. The very same cloud that Jesus rides as He returns to claim His rightful Kingship...  Yes I have a musical gift. Many friends of mine will tell you. They would love to see me conquer the world of media filth with my learned wisdoms. But the battle is the Lord's and what use have I of the crowns of this world. I would rather have one of twisted thorns. This world is going to the vultures of the enemy. Death litters the streets of the holy land. But I step over their bodies and push forward past the starving fingers yelling, "It's for your own good that I must fight for fame! What other resources do I have but my musical genius?!" I yell this with a mouth that can kiss, I run on strong feet and reach with capable hands. I push with the vigor of youth and the fuel of a fortified convenience breakfast bar. Past the starving mouths of the sick who's cries come to me from sattelite feeds and glossy print magazines. Are these my neighbors because I see them on the racks in the supermarkets? I see them and turn away to grab the Vanity Fair with Brad Pitt on the cover. "...freedom looks like too many choices." Bono again.  I can love on a local level. I can sing to ears who are so critical with a voice that reaches dozens rather than millions. Yes, this is the sound of practical reality invading my technicolor dreamworld. The paint of my dreams is running as I spray it with reason. Is it reason or is it discouragement?  So I put this out onto the internet highway to see who stops in for a chat. You can't get the help you need unless you ask for it...  Diana

      So I blew my hair dry this morning for the first time since, like, winter. I realized how '90s I still look. I am thinking of getting a freaky chop with short short bangs. But my hair has this natural wave that thinks it's trying to be straight, on certain days, in certain climates (my hair changes its mind as much as...well, me!). I want to keep my natural color because dying is too much for me to maintain. I wonder how much product I would have to put in my hair to make the jagged-cut look work. God, this is so girly...  So I need some feedback, girls AND guys. Should I chop it? What do you think of my look when I do the heavy black eyeliner thing? Am I getting way too much like the Sixpence None the Richer girl? Is that a good thing since that band broke up? I know that my clothes will consist of lots of long gypsy skirts (thanks to L.A. thrift stores I will be reinventing my entire wardrobe when i move down there) and layered gauze shirts. I want to bring back the many necklaces, many bracelets look because bracelets remind me of my loved ones and necklaces make a statement. Wow! There is an actual girly-girl in me somewhere! This is getting kinda fun, in a scary way...  So any feedback would be the bomb. It takes a village to design a rockstar's look. Or maybe I just lack the inspiration to play dress up by myself. This small town only has so many poochy pants and sweat-stain blouses to try on without getting discouraged. My kingdom for that Sunset Blvd. $1 thrift sale...  staring too long in the mirror, Diana

      There are a lot of sick people out there. What am I doing chasing my dreams? I should just go to school to become a health professional and hum down the cold tile hallways...  Or the hand of God could cradle me for a while and then when the clock strikes "NOW!" He may swing His great arm back and toss me up on a mountain. There my voice may bless the world with hope, hunger, and inspiration. Of course, it could always be less dramatic than all that. But I don't think subtlety was in my basket of gifts this lifetime.   Thanks to Kelsye for giving me the BLOG idea. A shrine to the constant changes that no one, including myself, can predict.   D

      I have spent this whole week in computer and book land. My brain is mush. But it is just adjusting to all the new information. I have packed quite a lot of revelations into one week. Now I move back home for a few days and then it's homeless and housesitting again. It's a greay way to get out my gypsy urges, housesitting.  Some sites to visit if you have time (Kels, you gotta teach me how to add links on sidebar):   urlLink Relevant Magazine. God. Life. Progressive Culture.   urlLink Ninjai: The Little Ninjai   Ninjai is a rad series of cartoons I saw from atomfilms.com  me likey.  love, Dianasaur rrrrrraaaar!

      Communications of rationalizations. Hours upon hours filled with words. Words from the page. Words from the screen. Words from the mouth. Words from the phone. Are they ALL heard? Don't any of those words slip into a black hole somewhere, never to be heard, never to be read? I don't think so. My God is big enough to hear them all and read them all.  On average women say 7,000 words per day. Men say just over 2000. So far I have spoken at least 6,875,000 words according to that average. I bet you I have spoken twice that many words. I have probably written at least half that much, too.   I saw another shooting star tonight, out of the corner of my eye. One star fell, one word spoken. Every time someone says, "I don't believe in fairies" a fairy, supposedly, falls dead. Poor little bastards. Who made up that stupid rule? Well, I DON'T believe in fairies. I'm a fairy killer.  I do believe in Jesus. I can't even bring myself to write the words of disbelief in Him. I know better. Will He fall dead? That's a laugh. Will I fall dead if I utter those words? No. But He hears them and I don't talk shit about those I love.  Why do I believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior of my life? Because I have seen the change in me, from my point of view. Others have seen it in me, too. But I could have made the change 'manifest' by choosing to believe it. It could be ALL me! "Hey, baby! It's all you! It's all good! You ARE a god, didn't you know?" Me? A god? I made this happen? I don't believe in Diana. I don't believe in Diana. I don't believe in Diana. I don't...  I don't. I never did. I didn't plan on living to be 25 years old. Yet, they say, I am a god. Am I a god? I get out of bed in the morning for God (me?) and feed my body for God(me?). I breathe in and out for God(me?). No, not me. God. God the Father who came as man to pay for my sins. The Creator of all this...  God says, "Where were you when I created the earth? Tell me, since you know so much! Who decided on its size? Certainly you'll know that! Who came up with the blueprints and measurements?  "Do you know the first thing about death? Do you have one clue regarding death's dark mysteries?  "Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his? Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty. Unleash the fury of your wrath! Look at every proud man and bring him low. Look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand. Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave. Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you."  I reply, "Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know."  I can't know. So I believe.

      "Tall, mild drip with room and a little ice." That's what I order every morning this week from Starbucks (the ice is because I don't want to wait two minutes to drink my coffee and burning my lips seems ridiculous) Then I sit on the patio, smoke God-forsaken cigarettes and pore through my latest devotional. It is  Sickness Unto Death  by Soren Kierkegaard. "Despair is the self not willing to be oneself. Despair is the self despairingly willing to be oneself." How do I keep up with this guy? Well, I do. Thanks to my tall, mild drip with room and a little ice. That drink sounds like a guy I once dated. He was a 6'1", skinny, sloppy kisser with cold hands...  I am in love with an 18th Century existentialist. The lady I use to work for down at the independently-owned coffee shop (I'm sorry, Sharon, Starbucks is only a block away. Stop glaring at me. I feel it all the way across town.) said to me once, "You are attracted to everyone." I had only commented on the hot, middle-aged asian guy walking enthusiastically down the street! He looked so serene and confident I could have kissed his face! So? I am attracted to everyone. That's not altogether true. I think that guy from Matchbox Twenty is totally GICK! He has no lips!!! A man's got to have lips, mmkay. But it's not really the outer that attracts me anyways, it the inner. "How you gonn' win when you ain't right within?" thank you Lauryn Hill. God has blessed me with insight so that attractive men, to me, may look a lot different from eachother. Plus, variety is the spice of life. I am not one of those girls who is attracted to a dude that looks like he could be my brother. That seems a little narcissistic, doesn't it? Or maybe they don't look in the mirror often  enough .  In any case I am in love with Soren Kierkegaard. I enjoy his words and his history so much that I can't wait to curl up with his books any free time I get. I even prefer him to a lot of the attractive guys I meet. He's dead so he's only gonna say what I choose to read. *buddum bum bum* I am so glad he is my brother in Christ (I don't know if he looks like me, though) so I will be able to shoot the shite with him in Heaven. If there's any shite-shooting up there...who knows?   Anyone else ever fall in love with a dead person? Jim Morrison? Shakespeare? Jeff Buckley? Those guys are mine so back off! *ruckety ruck ruck* Just laughing into the void, don't mind me.

      I set my alarm this morning for 7am just because I wanted to play on my brother's computer and sit at Starbucks before work at noon. When my alarm went off I sat up and rationalized going back to sleep. The exact rationalization was, "I will be delivering pizzas until late tonight so I should sleep more." Honestly, it could have been, "The trolls under my bed will poison my cereal if I don't sleep more." It didn't really matter why I needed to stay in bed. But I couldn't lay down without grabbing my portable alarm clock like a teddy bear. It had hit the snooze button, you see, so rather than sit up and press it every nine minutes I chose to simply move my thumb. This gave the illusion that I was getting up at any moment. Forty minutes later I finally just swung my feet out of bed, turned on the computer, and scuffed to the kitchen to pour my cereal. It was poison-free! Imagine that.  One of the biggest reasons I have no motivation is because my brother lacks the one essential piece of kitchen equipment known to man...the coffeemaker. I think it's so useful that he has a tin of coffee and some filters in the cupboard but no percolator. I could always boile some grounds in a pan and pour it into a filter and into a mug. Why do that when Starbucks is a mere block away. I would go there upon rolling out of bed if this wasn't Big Bear and if I wouldn't see at least a dozen people I know every morning. I can't wait to be an old woman so people will expect me to look haggard. It is so shocking when people see my angelic face as it really is...like a preteen crackwhore for starters. I have these black rings around my eyes that I have to cover with paste every morning or people will ask me, "Are you tired? Do you have a black eye? Rough night last night?" But what they are really thinking is,"Are you high on crack or meth or SOMETHING?!?! Or do ya need your fix?!? Hungover?" If it weren't for my big, soft cheeks I am sure I would never convince people that I get plenty of sleep and I am off the drugs. I know that when I get a tan on my face they go away for the most part, but I can't spend enough time outside without makeup on to get them that way. What was God thinking? He has His reaons for the oddest things.  Speaking of coffee....

      "Lord grant me weak eyes for things that are of no account and strong eyes for all thy truth." -Soren Kierkegaard  The following was written from my room in North Hollywood about March/April 2003 A.D.:  'Collapsed to the floor, face on the ground, tears making mud on my cheeks. I hide my face with trembling hands and beat my chest with anguish and wonder at the glory of a Creator. When it's supernatural to us it is natural to Him...here is where we learn to define ourselves in a language too confusing for words. I suppose that if we can write it or say it then we don't truly understand it...I am finding in my new faith that I am not afraid of Death or Satan, I am only aware of them.'  days later, I wrote:  'The Lord's my mind, my heart given over to Him. His glory is me. I will stand in His love never blown over by the torrents this world has. The enemy has the violent hate and deceit, yet I transform in His love. A giant newborn star and glowing as a chrysalis I will burst forth in splendor. Just now I am an egg swirling in the shell like a million brilliant colors..'  Today I dosed myself with coffee and wrote this outside in the wind: 'I have a very active inner life. I talk to myself, sing to myself, listen to my own speaking voice as I converse with others. This is starting to sound a little neurotic, but perhaps it's ingenious. There is a quote I recall that goes something like, madness and genious are bedfellows. I could do very well amongst coffee, cigarettes, and college professors. I could do very well with the fatherless children of the lost. I have mingled and danced with the light extremes of logic and insanity. Mild forms of eccentric, lazy artists have often found comfort in my company. I notice the hidden compassion in the most timid of people. My insights penetrate even the most thick facades. Maybe that is why music is my blood. Honest wails of questioning souls appeal to my own vulnerabilities. Somehow I haven't embraced my own desire for disciplining these same expressions.  The puzzles in my adjectives are only solved by the most patient. Some people just don't have time,energy, or care to discern me amongst the words I use. I admire them and look up to them. Some enjoy the challenge. Those are the ones with whom I melt into and rest with... Euphoria is hard to come by. Desire is running in and out of the exit door. She can't decide if she's coming or going.  Immortalize my thoughts, oh God. This way I am made in Your image and even through my unspoken, unwritten acts of love. The power behind the silence of wisdom is a mysterious responsibility. Every word will be paid for in eternity. I will answer, perhaps, to my sarcasms and idle ramblings. "Live the dreams in your tangled brain," they say, with encouraging half-smiles. "Chase your glorious, multi-colored tail because you don't know that you'll bit your own ass." Entertainment is a spectator's sport. Only the God of miracles could perform the impossible feat of restoring my true genius (madness?) to me. This God who births men out of dust and women out of ribs and Who raises the dead. This God who shouts love in a whisper. This God of paradox who baffles kings and brings heros to shame.  You are my Father. You adopted me and call me Your own. That I should be chosen and priveleged, I am stunned into paralysis with my worship of You. A bride and a sister of Your only begotten Son. It is more family than I could have ever hoped for...'  For those of you that have read all of this post, you rock and I love you. Amen.

      Last night I went to the bars. Maybe it was to prove to myself that I have no noble character. Maybe it was because I wasn't scared of the temptation. Maybe it was because I wanted to feel significant. I left feeling humiliated, inebriated, and pulverized. The bars aren't for me anymore and I am no longer for the bars. Sadly I must say goodbye to that era of my life. I will miss it and it will miss me. But I can't handle the disrespect of drunk people or the self-anihilation. That's it.   What the hell am I going to do NOW? I won't do boys, I won't do drugs, I won't do self-ambition, now I won't even party with old friends? I am praying that God will put me to work. I have wrung these idle hands far too long and now they need some serious employment.   I ask anyone who has a prayer for me to help me lift this one up to heaven. "Lord, restore my body and make it strong. It is tired and broken from the gravity of time spent dreaming and dozing. The weight of physical comfort is pulling my bones and muscles down. I want to master my body for Your sake, God of Heaven. Too long has it mastered me. Please teach me how, Lord Jesus. Amen."

      I have a new dream. See Proverbs 31:15  The Wife of Noble Character  10 A wife of noble character who can find?  She is worth far more than rubies.  11 Her husband has full confidence in her  and lacks nothing of value.  12 She brings him good, not harm,  all the days of her life.  13 She selects wool and flax  and works with eager hands.  14 She is like the merchant ships,  bringing her food from afar.  15 She gets up while it is still dark;  she provides food for her family  and portions for her servant girls.  16 She considers a field and buys it;  out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.  17 She sets about her work vigorously;  her arms are strong for her tasks.  18 She sees that her trading is profitable,  and her lamp does not go out at night.  19 In her hand she holds the distaff  and grasps the spindle with her fingers.  20 She opens her arms to the poor  and extends her hands to the needy.  21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household;  for all of them are clothed in scarlet.  22 She makes coverings for her bed;  she is clothed in fine linen and purple.  23 Her husband is respected at the city gate,  where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.  24 She makes linen garments and sells them,  and supplies the merchants with sashes.  25 She is clothed with strength and dignity;  she can laugh at the days to come.  26 She speaks with wisdom,  and faithful instruction is on her tongue.  27 She watches over the affairs of her household  and does not eat the bread of idleness.  28 Her children arise and call her blessed;  her husband also, and he praises her:  29 "Many women do noble things,  but you surpass them all."  30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;  but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  31 Give her the reward she has earned,  and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.   Do I wanna be a busybody? No. But I do want to build a solid foundation to be a strength in people's lives. The only way I can do that is by relying on The Lord to teach me how to begin.  I can't balance my checkbook, I don't have any credit, I am staying with friends and not paying rent, I don't have a career-minded skill, I don't know the first thing about making a hearty meal for people, I don't know how to shop let alone make my own clothes.   My mom wasn't that kind of mom. I didn't learn that any of that stuff was important. I want it to be important in my life but I don't know who will teach me. I wonder if there is a class I could take somewhere...  time for the hunt.

      "I'm like Peter crying Crowing burning my ears Still You come near You take my hand and place in my palm an eternal chance"  -Sixpence None The Richer, from 'Dizzy'   I have been trying to do what I thought God would want me to do. I thought I was to think of some outrageous way to use my gifts and then rely on Him to make the impossible happen. So I adorned my holy robes and ventured...right off the path. Now I huddle down in front of Jesus listening to His voice.  After I have indulged in a meal with Him He asks me, "Diana, do you love me?" I can't believe He could ask me such a question. "Of course I love You, my Lord."  He simply replies, "Feed my lambs." And again He asks, "Diana, do you truly love me?" I reply, "Yes, Lord you know that I love You." "Take care of my sheep." And a third time He'll ask, "Do you love me?" "Lord, You know all things. You know that I love You." "Feed my sheep."   John 21:15  Ok, I am listening. First it is His lambs, then I am to care for His sheep, then feed the sheep. I can't help see the disciple whom Jesus loved and be jealous. Oh, to be like John! Instead I have wielded the sword of Peter and cut off a man's ear. Jesus has scorned me and now I am collapsed. My obsession for Him was keeping me from hearing His commands. If I love Him I will obey Him. Lord Jesus, command me anything and I will do it.   silence...  I am not playing the church game any longer. I have a few simple goals I would like to meet in order to love others more completely. I want to buy some gifts, work more hours, babysit a little, listen to my friends, heal them, and be true to them. Everything else is in the fog of the future. I was flailing around in this raft when there weren't even any rapids. I was steering myself into the river banks and splashing my oars in still waters. I am resting now, riding the slow current of my daily life. Praying for bread and that I may not be led into temptation. So many options in this world of electronics and global communications. Voices streaming in on my wireless, on my television, on the air waves of public living. I want to hear One Voice, only One.

      I am reading Soren Kierkegaard's "Fear and Trembling". No, they didn't make a movie out of it with Johnny Depp in it. Though, the more I read it, the more I realize how autobiographical it is to S.K.'s life.  There is so much for me in this book. God has handed it down from heaven to be read by me at this time. He always provides perfection.   One concept that I am studying is The Infinite Resignation. That is, faith. S.K. and I are both overthinkers, or as I like to call it: philosophers. I can't get my heart around something unless it has seaped through the maze of my mind first. I have accepted this about myself, I am resigned to it...  I am going to see if there are any internet secret S.Kierkegaard societies where the infinite resignation is being discussed...  the search for community continues.

      Last night I spent some quality time with my best friend. We prayed and cried and talked crap. Mostly we just loved eachother. I love her. I was suppose to go to my favorite bible study but my priorities are my priorities. The friendship I have with this girl is so rewarding that I didn't want to leave her. I didn't want to leave her...  But I was going to, when I was thinking I would chase after my dreams in the city of fame and profit. It baffles me that I would have had any higher priority than my friends. My brothers and sisters have jumped up to being my first concern. The two commandments aren't Love God and Go Get Rich So You Can Help People. They are Love God and Love Your Neighbor As Yourself. Who is my neighbor? Luke 10:29   Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13   God is teaching me the greater love through His Spirit. Amen.

      Listening to one of my favorite songs last night while I delivered pizzas, I stumbled across this deep meaning for my life. The first part of this song has God's truth in it. The second part seems as though it is personally appropriate. The title of the song is extremely significant since I hae been talking a lot lately about the annoying skycams and aerial cameras that seem to be distracting my own perspective. This will be the theme song for a while...  You can listen to it at  urlLink http://www.systemdown.8m.com/  go to the tiny "audio" link in the list on the left of the page. System of a Down is NOT a Christian band, by the way. But they do encourage the interpretation of their songs in your own way. On to the message!   Aerials by System of a Down Life is a waterfall, We're one in the river, And one again after the fall.   Genesis 2:6 but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground- 7 the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.  1 Corinthians 15: 22For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.    Swimming through the void We hear the word,   John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.   We lose ourselves, But we find it all   Luke 17 33Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.   Cause we are the ones that want to play, Always want to go, But you never want to stay,   That is the part where it begins to specifically talk about me. The Gypsy Me, the me that is always ready to bail.   And we are the ones that want to choose, Always want to play, But you never want to lose.   That is the part where it talks about the Gambler Me. I should make action figures for my different tendencies.    Aerials, in the sky, When you lose small mind, You free your life.   That's the chorus. I believe it means that I need to keep my perspective face forward.   Life is a waterfall, We drink from the river, Then we turn around and put up our walls.     Aerials, so up high, When you free your eyes, Eternal prize.    insert the bible reference here. You get the picture, right? I am getting kicked off the library computer so that's it for this post. Stay tuned....  -Diana

      I just got a second job and solidified my stay in this town. I will be making sandwiches during the day and delivering pizzas at night. Sound exciting? I believe I have traded in 'exciting' for a life of simplicity. It baffles me to think that my current challenges in life include purchasing a dresser and picking out a plant to buy. The rest is cake.  God really did tell me to buy a plant. Like, last year. This is a real challenge for me. I have never owned a plant. He wants me to plant the seeds myself and learn how to take care of it from seedhood. Could life happen as simply as watering a plant? Maybe it would have it's exciting moments. I just remembered 3rd grade when we planted bean sprouts and watched them grow. I remember feeling a sense of ownership and accomplishment for one of the first times in my life. It is a slow process that just takes routine watering and sunlight. Such little maintenance and life sprouts up. If my life ever gets too distracted that I can't take care of a plant then I need to refocus. Just when you think you've actually learned something, God sends us back to the basics. I was sure that He was joking with me when He told me to buy a plant. But it is time I take Him seriously on that one. This is a lesson in simplicity. He says, "Be still...be still.....hold STILL...DIANA! *sigh* Be still, my child and know that I am God." I love Him for his infinite patience with me.

      I often relate to the men in the bible more than the women. I am the Prodigal Son covered in pig funk and God runs to me and kisses my filthy neck. I am Stephen standing up to lecture the crowd. I am Paul in front of the Sanhedrin having faith that the Holy Spirit will give me the words I need. I am David, but I am a tripped out version of David...  There's Goliath in all his fury and strength. What would Diana do? Run and jump on his back! Thank God for second chances. There is a difference between brave and stupid. David grabbed a rock and with the precision of a miracle it sunk into Goliath's temple putting him down. The specific guidance of the Holy Spirit taught him and prepared him for that moment. What if he had thought of himself as a wrestler as I do?  My mom and I recently went to Six Flags Magic Mountain. There is this ride called Goliath that has a 255 ft. drop at 85mph. What a rush. That is my life. Just before it hits the ground with a fatal crash it curves ever so gently upward soon to be a gravity-defying spiral, etc. What a rush. But ultimately the train pulls back into the station and it's time to get off. Not for me. It seems as though my ass is glued to the seat of this ride. "One more time!" I yell to the operator. Here I go, going nowhere at 85mph just because I can.  Lord knows it's time for me to get off this ride and get off this giant. I'll pick up my water bottle and camera and leave the damn themepark with some great memories and a little nausea. I'll land in the ancient dust and hear the voice of God tell me which rock to pick up. I can't do much until I learn to live in each day, solid and with an actual starting point. The ride is over, now I must defeat the giant.  being still and still being (damn I'm clever), Diana

      It looks like I have been stepping outside myself a little too much. So much that I stopped seeing things from my own point of view. I feel like I have been a camera man filming myself for all the world to see. What do I want to see? Do I really WANT to be a rockstar?  I know that people like my voice and my music and my message. I enjoy singing a lot. I am a performer, too. But do I really want to make a career out of it? I have said before that I could be happy just singing to my children. But to some that is the sound of failure, of giving up. Would I be burying my talents if I didn't pursue music? Can't I be invisible?  This opportunity that I have to be in this band has started to look less exciting. I have already written to them about my second thoughts. They are more than second thoughts. I have a couple of fears about not going...  One fear is that this is an elaborate rationalization to keep me from leaving the comfort of this small town. But the way I refute that is by remembering it is comfortable for me to leave, not to stay. I hardly ever just STAY...  Another fear is that I am too dependent on the friends I have made here. I am not used to being so emotionally dependent on people other than family. But I argue with that by remembering that people need eachother and I am not meant to leave the Body of Christ unless it is to join another part of the Body. Being in the Body is the most important place. Right? It sounds right, biblical.  So I am going to get another job here and save money up for something. I am taking some steps down the road of STAY PUT. I realized that I had been seeing myself from other people's perspectives way too much. Does that make me insightful and imaginative? Sure. But what good is that going to do me if I am blown around by the wind.   Thank God for my brothers and sisters. Life's about to get less hectic and more satisfying. It's mine. Mine I tell you! -Diana

      (also posted on relevantmagazine.com boards,&nbsp;my name over there is SoulRepair)  Many are called and few are chosen, right? God can chose whomever He wants to be a part of His kingdom. Why does He choose some and not others? That's like asking why God chose those particular people to be Jews and not some group of people, say in ancient native american culture or the aztecs or innuits, whatever (assuming that those people even existed at that time, which we're pretty sure that they did archeologically & anthropologically speaking). In any case, who are we to ask why? "You want the truth? You can't handle the truth!" God might say (but He's much cooler than jack nickelson). Whatever He says is right and I will not be judging God. Um, hell no.   So... few are chosen. That is the sad truth. God gave us the ability to reproduce our kind and we have nearly overpopulated ourselves off the map and it ain't stopping yet. With more people come more possibilities for being chosen, but God does the choosing. However, if He chooses us and we refuse Him He doesn't stop pursuing us and He doesn't stop forgiving us (that is, unless we reject and blaspheme His Holy Spirit, then there is no hope of reconciliation). But what a privelage to have the God of all creation pursue us! What an amazing honor to be chosen!That you and I should enter the gates of Heaven! Chosen by God! While we were yet sinners, dead in spirit and full of selfishness! God saw our potential and He chose us and is transforming us. We had nothing to do with being chosen. All glory and honor to the King of Kings!   As children of God we can petition Him. We can beg and plead on behalf of others we love. And He does change His mind sometimes! Those people that perhaps He hadn't called, if prayed for by His children with a sincere heart may be called. Then if God chooses, they will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. We will know that God has chosen them if they repent and believe in Jesus! But only He knows the hearts of men, and though we love a person God knows whether or not He wants to choose them based on His omniscience. But He is a mericiful God and He listens to us because we're His kids. But only if we listen to Him first...  I am baffled and shaken at the responsibility of being chosen. I am collapsed with worship and soaring with joy at my having been chosen. How can I take this gift for granted when so many do not recieve it? I have and now I repent! Right now. His wisdom fills my mind like a perfectly timed trickle of water into an empty bucket. Every day my thirst is quenched and I overflow...just by one drop of His grace. I am more deeply in love with my Father every day. All honor and glory goes to Him, the&nbsp;Almighty God! Amen.

      Ok, so I bought a twinkie three pack cuz you buy two and get one free. But that's not the cool part... &nbsp; I have been thinking of raising money for a mission trip next year. I would need $4000 or so to go. Then I pop in my awesome Kevin Sandbloom cd and something occurs to me. $4ooo would be more than enough to master 4 songs from my demo, make copies with an artwork sleeve, and get my own website going to sell them online, right? I haven't done that much research on the cost but $4000 seems like enough. Why am I suddenly thinking of doing this? Because Kevin Sandbloom is from L.A. and I saw him and many open mics and HE has done it. Granted, he is a genius guitar player, songwriter, AND vocalist but who's to say I can't do it too? By the way, for all of those who haven't blessed their ears with his tunes I suggest you do, immediately. Go to www.kevinsandbloom.com. It's as easy as that! &nbsp; As for my own mission? Well, my girl Kelsye would be smacking her forehead and saying, "DUH!" at me right now. You see, she paid for my pre-mastered demo... &nbsp; I apologize to the God, Kelsye, and all of my fans for not getting this idea/plan started earlier. I'm only 25. There's still time! To google! I'm makin' up&nbsp;a master plan.

      Once upon a time there lived a slut whore who was saved by grace. Baptised in the Holy Spirit, the girl was born again. But she still had the body that she was born with. This body bore the scars and tattoos of her past. It had been diseased and abused, neglected and ignored; all this by the person to whom the body was entrusted to by God. Me.  When Adam and Eve were clothed in light, they didn't need skin. But God made them skin when they fell. Skin, this perishable protein that holds in all our perishable innards. If not kept at the right temperature, we would cook like holiday ham or freeze like leftovers! Yet, my body is a temple...  With all that has happened to this temple I must hold onto the idea that it is dust. I am not the same person that I was before I was baptised into the Holy Spirit. Yet my body would tell you that I am.  It would be different if I hadn't brought the abuse on myself. But I wasn't planning on living so I fell into disrepair. Then God brought me to Life. He breathed into my spirit and I gulped the air. I gasped Life into my spirit for the first time. Now I want my body to know that Life.   "LIFE! Give my creation...LIIIIFE!" -Gene Wilder

      "My question is whether a belief in Jesus Christ is enough to adequately prepare a person to deal with the issues that are immediately important in addition to the spiritual issues that are only generally important. And as we all know, the universe tends toward the specific, not the general. -mARKUS"  My purpose in replying to this post is not to try and change the author's mind about Christianity. I love to challenge my beliefs because I do not believe blindly. The eyes of my eyes have seen the revelations of the Lord God and it is my pleasure to write about the answers I have found.  The first thing I'd like to address in the question pasted above is that the author believes spiritual issues are only generally important. I, on the other hand, believe that spiritual 'issues' are of the utmost importance generally, immediately, and specifically. The spirit in man is the eternal and the eternal is what I long for. In longing for the eternal I am longing for God. In longing for God I long for His Son Jesus, my salvation and the only reason I am able to have a relationship with God. My longing for the eternal is so strong in me that I make the spiritual my first priority. Later I found biblical reassurance that I am to seek first the Kingdom of God (God is Spirit-John 4:24) and His righteousness(Matt. 6:33). With righteousness we move into the realm of motive and behavior. The foundation on which motive and behavior are built is the spirit. Now that my spirit is one with the Holy Spirit I am change from within. My motives are then changed and eventually my behaviors. This is what is meant by 'transformed by the renewing of your mind' (Romans 12:2). I have come to discover that this change takes time, perhaps a lifetime.  Righteousness brings us to your questions about right versus wrong (see 'I Do Believe in Jesus' comments on my blog). There are many atrocities in this world, some of which I have endured personally. But rather than stop at the question, 'is it wrong to...?' I decided to go further and ask, 'why would God create and allow such horrors?' It was an incredible paradigm shift for me when I gained the revelation, the answer. If my mind hadn't been being transformed by the Holy Spirit working within me, I would not have been able to comprehend it. Had it not been for grace, I especially would not be able to accept it. But that was not your question. Here is my response to anyone who asks me, specifically if a particular situation (whether it be hypothetical or based on real events) is wrong or right:  When you ask me if something is wrong, I can make judgments from where I stand, as a human clothed in skin and ignorant of the mysteries of God's plan. I can tell you what the ten commandments say. I can tell you what the Holy Spirit says in my heart if God chooses to speak to me about it. But not knowing the future and knowing what the grace of God can do, I have hope for all of the abused. Let me back up...to the beginning.  Adam and Eve ate from the tree, we have all heard the story. But do you recall the name of the forbidden tree? It was 'the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.' God said, 'if you eat of this tree you will surely die.' Did He say He would kill them? No. He said they would die. Why would they die? Aren't we suppose to know the difference between good and evil? How else would we make moral decisions? But God told them if they ate of it they would die.  Then I looked at myself, mere (wo)man, beautifully and wonderfully made though I am and I compared myself to God. Of the two, who do you think knows right from wrong better? Man, who is limited in his abilities to see anything but this moment; who is not omnicient, omnipotent, or creator of the universe? Or God who is all those things and invented right and wrong? I decided that I didn't know better than God. And I must decide that every moment. When I am lured by the lies that hang from a tree of delusion, I sin. Sinning is anything done outside of faith.(Romans 14:23) Adam and Eve were completely dependent on God, choosing His love at every moment, before they believed the lie (the lie that they might be like God) and disobeyed God. As the story goes, they were kept from eating of the tree of Life because the professed to know good from evil. The truth is mankind decided what was good and evil, but only God knows what is truly good or evil in any situation.  I love my enemies and pray for them because I was commanded to. I will stop atrocities from happening whenever I can, I am commanded to and inspired to. But I allow God to judge because only He knows the heart of a man and He created justice. I can say that the things you wrote of (in commenting to my post about Jesus) are disgusting acts of cruelty. As a human I would want to watch people like the youth pastor for example be beaten to within an inch of his life (is it wrong to want that? perhaps.)But in faith I only mourn and pray. As for abortion, I believe a human is alive from conception. It is not the baby's fault that the girl was raped, it is the rapist's fault. If that little girl had faith enough she could move mountains and she could also take care of a child, or give it up for adoption. Do I judeg her when she aborts the baby? No, I love her. I, too am a sinner (though I have never had an abortion, thank God). Who am I to judge anyone outside of faith? All people are made in God's image (Gen 1:26) and I am told to love anyone on my path, even a rapist (although loving him may mean keeping him from raping me by any means possible, sending him to prison [where he may get a taste of his own medicine] and/or ultimately praying for him and sharing these truths with him possibly leading him to Jesus).   It is a lengthy answer, I know. But these questions are important and require an open mind to Truth if you want enlightenment. I am chosen to be a child of the Creator of the Universe, not because I am 'tha bomb', but because of grace. I desire to share these secrets that He has revealed to me. He has trusted me with this much and I want to discover how to invest it wisely. I am still waiting to discover...  Some people will not understand what I have written. They may only find they had their own answers to these questions set in stone and they don't wish to exchange their answers for mine. I have read in Matthew 13 about the disciples: Verse 11..."The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance...16 blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear..."

      So I am thinking about going to the American Idol auditions in Vegas on Sept 11th (a swell date I know, sarcastically she said). My mom says it's a good idear and so do some of my friends. I know I could take it if I am in the right place at the right time. Would God want this for me? It's a little like selling your soul. You should see the release form you have to sign! "...I understand that my appearance, depiction, and/or portrayal in the program may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing or of an otherwise unfavorable nature which may expose me to public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation." This is directly from the release form that you have to sign before you even go to the first audition. Is this something I want to subject myself to in the name of musical success? I figure I will go and try out and if the producers sweep me up and throw me into the spotlight I will have the ride of my life (so far) and God will infuse His strength in me to deal. But if I pass again into obscurity then I will be almost grateful. But I might as well try out. God may use it for His kingdom and my own character development. Lord knows I am up for the challenge. It's just that I don't listen to that kind of music. When's the last time you really dove into some Barry Manilow and a little Celine? I have never even dabbled in the cheese that is those types of 'artists'. Can I even DO cheese?! Well, maybe pepper jack.

      Well not exactly Baton Rouge but that town isn't far off from where I am thinking of going. Yesterday my dear Emily asked me to move in with her in Louisiana. I thought that I was done thinking of leaving. Alas, the gypsy freak of nature is alive and well. Here in my small town in California I feel stifled like always. Though Los Angeles (the real L.A. not LA as in Louisiana) is a mere two hours away, I feel like my resources are limited. I am going to do it right this time. All my relatives are telling me not to leave, but have I ever taken their advice?

      When I smoke cigarettes it is a metaphor. Though I hate the hold it has on me, I continue to rely on its wicked companionship. It is a dangerous dance with sin. The stench of my clothes is hideous making a trail of judgment behind me. It is a reminder of a bondage that I never should have revisited. It alerts people to my brokenness. My temple is being made unclean by its intoxicating intrusion. I want to be rid of it.  I am a smoking temple with 'under construction' signs and yellow caution tape all over me. Slowly and patiently Jesus clears out the splintered damaged goods and strips the remains of the wallpaper of rebellion. His hands are the only things that can remove sin-stained remnants and throw them in the fire. As the objects litter the front lawn in preparation to burn, I take an upset inventory. That was in ME? It reminds me of a beautiful princess toddler who craps the most surprising load into her diaper. How does something so precious produce such foul waste? Jesus doesn't cringe away in disgust; He simply disposes of it as a mother would. The love erases all memory of the waste and rejoices once again in who the beloved child is.  I didn't see these things as waste before Jesus began throwing them out. The remnants of my sinful habits were made useful for my survival as a sinner. Last year Jesus drug out a vicious and kicking habit of manipulation and destruction. I had held it as valuable once when my loneliness as a sinner required me to take advantage of someone's heart. When I saw the real monster that it was in the light of Truth, my heart failed me. I decided that I couldn't live. So I abandoned all hope of cleaning out my own temple. This moved me out of the way of Jesus' work and has allowed Him to move about the temple without my interference. He has managed to take out nearly every reminder of the monster's once consuming presence. Among the other sinful remnants that Jesus has cleared out have been the jagged arrogance of self-importance, the seeping need for acceptance and validation from others (that left a shiny, sticky trail that still glistens menacingly on the doorstep), the hard-edged and cracked codependent caretaker (that also left chunks of residue to be swept with time), and the seemingly never ending black globs of self-sabotage that keep me from utilizing the freedom that is a blessed gift.  Everything that He destroys in the fire, He replaces with a thing of light. Each day my temple is illuminated more and the once-hidden corners come alive with creatures I had forgotten were there as they'd clung to the walls all these years. He doesn't throw everything out. Some things He transforms and restores. He covers those damaged places in me with a glowing veil that pulses with healing light. Sometimes it burns as it searches out the cancer and dissolves it with tiny flames. But when He removes the covering the place explodes with beams of life, filling me with joy and peace in that part of myself.  It is a marvelous sight to see my Master at work. I know He could purify me in a matter of hours, but I am glad to watch as He works steadily and lovingly over my days and years. When He rejoices at a job well done I rejoice with Him. I praise His love and faithfulness. His glory is in the attention He gives to every detail, completing the task in a way that could only be His. I realize now that I could never do the work that He does in me. Sometimes I sit outside my temple wishing I could help Him, but hearing my thoughts He comes to me. His smile radiates like the sun as He shows me what He is working on. "I am making you a new heart," He says, "and it's so much fun I feel like dancing!" He picks me up and we spin and jump to the sound of heaven's angels who worship and exalt Him. I forget my sin and my shame as He holds me in His arms and speaks words that warm my soul. "See the glory of the Father," He whispers, "This miraculous transformation is my love at work in you."  So I watch Him work. He teaches me His Word and breaks bread with me on His lunch break. We laugh at some of the things He finds in my imagination. I cry with the pain of relief as He destroys another unclean thing that He cut from me. Though I sleep, He never stops working. Though I bring things home that He would never allow past the threshold, He doesn't get angry with me but He teaches me. I pray He will give me wisdom on how to make His work go faster. When He does I will listen, and while He works I sing Him songs of appreciation and praise.
