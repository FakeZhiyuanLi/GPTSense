       What is death to people? Is it an ending? Is it a beginning? Is it just a way point?  It’s hard to figure out how we make it what we believe. It could just as well be a path to nothingness. We’ll just never know its not what we are destined for. If we knew what would happen when we die it wouldn’t be any fun.  Death is just what you make of it and if that in the end is a bad choice that’s just what you have to live with. It could be considered an easy way out for someone who is in pain. But that’s just chickening out.  Life is what you make of it and so is Death.

       Darkness is all around me. I always feel alone…….Even in a crowded place. Something I fear always seems true There’s no where to run. I can’t hide from my fears I hate being alone Darkness is always around me. My heart is no more I have no hope left. There is no known path My future cannot be seen There’s no hope of return The window is not open Pain is all I can feel I will feel no more I am no more My death will come as no surprise It’s the only hope I can feel My life is a bitter story It’s ended in a sour way…….Good bye. I am dead.

       Chapter 1. Why do I feel this way? As he turns around, he sees a man staggering down the street, does he know this person? Is it the someone he is waiting for? While he stares at the silhouette in the distance he drifts off, his mind goes to some other place. He never really thought about what life meant, but he was all of a sudden curious about the possibilities; “What is love? What can I do differently? How can I better myself?” These were the questions that he always wanted to ask, always needed answers to, but he never had the chance to tell someone about his feelings. He felt that he hadn’t lived up to the expectations he had put on himself, and they were getting heavier all the time. He didn’t want it to end like this, he didn’t want to die without answers, and he needed that closure. He didn’t want to leave his life disillusioned. As his awareness of reality was returning, he was still staring at the person now disappearing down the street. He thought he should be spontaneous and go right this second and search for the answers he has always wanted. But he didn’t know where to start. he got up and just walked down the street not knowing where he was going not knowing where he could end up all he new is that he wanted answers as to why he was here? To tell you about himself would take a while but it’s a good tale to hear. we he came to be he was always different he just never really had a place anywhere he just muddled through life succeeding very well at everything he did without even trying he just didn’t know what to do with his life he had no passion in what he did even though he became wealthy he just wasn’t happy with his life he always kept to himself not really knowing what to do. He became good at deceiving people of who he truly was he just didn’t like to leaver himself open. Its not that he is shy he just didn’t want to burden people with crazy thoughts he kept on having. He continued walking feeling that he had no purpose than to find out why he could do the thing he could with ease. As he continued walking he walk right past the most beautiful looking girl he had ever seen he was hypnotised he for some reason just wanted to get to know her. She of course wasn’t the most beautiful person in the world but to his eyes she was beauty it self. he started to follow her trying not to be seen he didn’t want to introduce him self just yet he just couldn’t do that he kept to the shadows and slowly followed her. she walked into a cafe' he thought this is the perfect place he could grab a coffee and just talk his time and finally get up the courage and talk to her. as he walk into the cafe' he noticed that she was already sitting with someone he started to think to himself how much of a dick am I. he couldn’t believe that he didn’t see it happening that she would already be taken but it wasn’t like he had always done something like this. He thought something might be different. But it wasn’t things just never went his way. He went home and just thought and thought about this girl he just couldn’t get her out of his head he was obsessed with her and why he felt this way. A few weeks passed and he still had her on his mind he was thinking to himself if that maybe if he had done something different that night he might have been able to talk to her. He went to the same cafe that he did when he followed that girl that night. His luck was in she was there and she looked upset he started to think to himself what was wrong. If he could do something to make her feel better. He sat there for a while and then had a nice cup of hot chocolate sent over to her. Has never really been the guy to see someone up set and not do something about it. She received the drink and she was very puzzled on who could have sent her this. It made her curious she for got all about her sorrows and just wanted to know who sent her this drink. She asked the waiter and he pointed him out she went over to him and asked him why he had sent her a drink. He replied" I looked like you really needed a nice cup of hot chocolate. I don’t like seeing people depressed and thought you could do with a cup." she thanked him for the drink and wanted to pay him for it he declined but asked if she would like to sit with him coz she looked quite lonely over there. She accepted and asked for his name. Chapter 2. Everything Went Wrong At this point he couldn’t believe what he had done. He had shoved that knife so hard into her chest he heard all her ribs snap like a stick. What had he done he never wanted to do something like this he just couldn’t believe he had killed her the girl he couldn’t get out of his thoughts. What could he do he just committed cold hearted murder why had he done this? he curled up beside her not knowing what to do he just couldn’t believe how his world had changed so much in the past few weeks. Just an hour ago he was on top of the moon cause he had just celebrated his six month anniversary and then he does this the past six months just seemed like a blur to him he didn’t even know how he ended up at this point and he wasn’t sure if he really did want to know. As the time went so quickly the police took him away and charged him on the murder of Stacie. He was locked up put away he really didn’t care what happened to him anymore he could really live with himself not after what he had done. He felt like crap he just wanted to end it here and there. He was just sitting there when he realized that the police forgot to take his belt from him. He got everything ready and was about to let go and die when he couldn’t remember what his name was he was just so confused at this point. He wanted to kill him self even more just when he was about to let go he was spotted by a copper and was striped of his clothes and put into a room were it was just bare there wasn’t even a bed. He just couldn’t believe how he could get this fucked up. He kept on wondering how he had gotten up to this point where every thing went wrong he just couldn’t make out a thing. Was this girl he killed a hidden she-devil in disguise. He just wanted to go back and find out what had happened to him. Most of all he wanted to remember his name. Chapter 3. Any Last Words? It was a lovely evening the two of them where having the greatest night of their lives. They were celebrating there six month anniversary. He had planned so much and they were having fun doing everything together. When they first started the day he took her out on the river in this charming little boat and they had a wonderful picnic on the water. He then took her to see a really nice film and to top it all off he took her out to the most expensive dinner he could think of. While they were at dinner he just couldn’t believe he was here six months on with the girl of his dreams he forgot long ago about finding out the questions of life and all he wanted to do was spend the rest of his life with her. When they had finished eating they went out for a nice stroll to savour the night they were having the greatest time together. When they arrived at her house she invited him up fora nice cup of coffee. Being that they had been going out for six months he knew he really shouldn’t decline and just go home. But some how this all felt familiar. He declined but when she insisted that he should come up he just couldn’t refuse. The went up to her apartment and they had a nice glass of coffee and one thing led into another and they ended up in her room. he was shit scared at this stage he never really got this close to her because he really didn’t know what to do he was infect still a virgin he just never really felt adequate in front of the girls before and he just really never had sex. But he didn’t want to disappoint her. What was he to do? he let her make all the moves he justly really didn’t know what to do of course he had seen some hardcore porn in his life that his friends had forced him into watching but he was always wasn’t too keen on trying that kind of thing out. It wasn’t that he was gay he just really wanted to find the special person. This night was different he wanted to do it he felt like she was the one but he also wanted to savour the moment. He wanted to make the night the most sensual experience of his life. He was going great he was doing everything right she was enjoying it he was enjoying it they were both enjoying it together. He wanted this moment to last forever. Then something drew him to open the dresser table inside there was a knife with out even thinking he pulled out the knife and said any last words? Chapter 4. Life Turned To Hell. He was now seeing a therapist on how his life had turned to shit he just really didn’t know how he had gotten up to this point. He could now remember finding the knife in the drawer and stabbing it into her chest but he still didn’t know why he had done it. Everything was going so great up until that point. He was telling his therapist his thoughts and that he had no fucking clue why he had done it. In the court case against him he pleaded guilty. His lower wanted him to plead insanity but he wanted to pay for his crime. He knew he was guilty and that’s what scared him he had 20 years to think about what he had done he just never thought he could do something like this. Every day in prison he was beaten to a pulp he was sexually violated and he was made to feel like shit. Even the guards beat him up. In a way he was glad to what was happening to him he just wanted to die. The only fried he had in prison was the therapist he had to see. He was the only person he felt he could talk to maybe that’s why he felt secure in his office. He was telling the therapist on how he couldn’t actually remember the six months before he had killed her. The therapist tried many techniques to help him remember but it never help. I guess he always felt like an empty shell and he was scared on what he could do next if it was possible for him to commit one murder why not more. He had all these thoughts going through his mind he just wanted answers he wanted the answers to all the facts in life he wanted to know the answers to the questions he had before he met Stacie. His mind raced everyday of this torturous experience he was having. He had enough he began to fight back he had enough of the shit he had been getting and thinking he deserved. Everyone started to leave him alone. Chapter 5. Could this be real? he awoke suddenly he found himself in a nice comfortable bed he didn’t know where he was at first he glanced beside him someone was holding onto him it was Stacie he couldn’t believe his eyes was he dreaming did he go back in time was he finding out the answers to life? He just couldn’t tell anymore. She awoke. "Cant you sleep." she said. "No." "Whets wrong you seem distant tonight" "I don’t know I just cant seem to get it together this all just seems like a dream" "What? Whets up with you are you going to be ok. Are you having second thoughts about us?" "No its not that I just cant believe that I’m here with you I would never want us to break-up" "That’s good. You should get some sleep. You said we had a big day planned tomorrow for our six-month anniversary." She drifted back off to sleep. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing had he been given a second chace to do it all over again he didn’t know but something seemed different. He couldn’t quite tell was it her voice was it something about her or was it him. He felt around his body he found this gash in the side of his chest. What the fuck? He thought how the hell did this happen? every thing was getting more confusing as the night went on he just couldn’t believe what was happening maybe this all was a dream he just didn’t know any more he didn’t care either he was happy he was with the one he loved. He wanted this moment to continue forever but he knew it couldn’t last. It was the next day and everything happened again just as it did before when they arrived at her house he truly wanted to go in and spend eternity with her but he knew that he might kill her again and he just didn’t want that to happen. He was scared because he didn’t know what he was capable of doing anymore. He pretended to be ill and tried to go home but the more he faked it the more she insisted him to come up and stay the night at her place. He didn’t know weather he could stop this happening again. He was scared shitless. They went off into the bedroom and proceeded to have the night of their life playing around and then something changed he just didn’t have the urge to look in the drawer he just wanted to hold her forever. It was the next day and nothing weird had happened she wasn’t dead he wasn’t going behind bars but he was still curious about what had happened to him when he had killed her. was that just a dream was he sent back to change what had happened or was he just imagining all the stuff he did he didn’t know but he wanted all the answers to these questions and all the others he previously wanted to know but he didn’t care much anymore he was happy and was glad at were he was. As time went by and their relationship got better they decided to move in together. He came home one fateful day and found the place pulled apart. He didn’t know what had happened had he been robbed had Stacie been unhappy and decided to leave him? It couldn’t be that as he walked through the house he went into the bed room. He couldn’t move he was just staring. He couldn’t believe this could happen. He called the police. Stacie had been raped and murdered. Was this a nightmare he couldn’t believe what had happened he was distraught he just couldn’t fathom this happening. At that moment a piece of him just seemed to die he was motionless he didn’t know what to do he was just an emotional wreck. How could this have happened to him again? Chapter 6. Is the nightmare over yet? The murderers still hadn’t been caught. he couldn’t live at home any more he was to scared to he had that many good times in that house that he just couldn’t face it anymore he didn’t want to believe that she was dead. It didn’t seem possible. He was so angry he wanted to kill the person or persons who did this it were his mission to find and kill them. The police were kind to him they felt pity they gave them all the information that they had on the killers. He went on the search looking for all the information he could find. He found them he found the killers. It was his time it was the time of reckoning he couldn’t believe it he was ready he was right there ready to kill the people who raped and murdered Stacie. He walked up to the door and knocked he waited someone just had to be home. The door suddenly opened it was one of them right at that moment he froze he didn’t know what to do how he should kill them. He had this gun he had bought but was afraid of what might happen if he could actually kill them. Right at that moment something clicks he just whipped out the gun and shot him in the head. He couldn’t believe what he had done he had killed one. "WHAT THE FUCK?" said someone standing in the hall way. "FUCK" he thought "What am I going to do I have to finish it I have to take him out too" He aimed the gun and shot him to. He had done it he killed the people who raped and murdered Stacie it was done he felt better he didn’t care what happened to him next he was at peace he had given the killers the justice that they deserved. It was done but he still felt like shit was this what he really needed to do or was there something else he didn’t know he couldn’t hack it any more he just wanted it to end he grabbed the gun cocked it and put the end of it in to his mouth he was ready to let it all go so he didn’t have to worry any more. He put his finger on the trigger and pulled it. The gun went off he was dead the insides of his head were plastered all over the wall. Chapter 7. The realization of it all. He suddenly awoke.” What a nightmare.” he thought There was an eerie silence he didn’t know what was wrong all he really remembered was putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger but was that real if it was then why was he lying here. All these questions he really wanted to know he just didn’t know where to begin. He was figuring out stuff and it was just sending him further and further down this endless hole of despair, he was excluding himself from everyone. He would often be locked in his room months at a time he was just loosing it he was fighting a never ending battle. He was bound to loose but he didn’t want to loose but things were fading to fast. His life started to swirl before his eyes he just never thought things were going to turn out this way everyone seemed to be against him now he just never really realised what people were on about what had really happened to him he just seemed to be in and endless nightmare of torment like someone was playing a mean trick on him and he just couldn’t figure out what was happening. He started diging deep into his mind there were just no answers there he didnt know what to do. He thought about just resuming his life but things just wouldnt be the same he couldnt look at her the same he just locked himself away in a room and just started writing he was trying to get his thoughts out but it wasnt working much. "There is no clear future. I see no hope for this life i am leading. the only way out of this troubled mind is through the essence of my soul but that will never make me think. Will this nightmare ever end i can not seemy path. My path is death. Death is my life. My life has no hope. I should not be here in this world." This was all that could be seen on his page. He was holding something. It was a knife. As the knife left its sheath it looked as cold as hell. he ran the knife against his throat with the cold steel sending shivvers down his spine. he pulled the knife away from his body and with a quick thrust he jamed the knife through. He was dying. No one knew. Blood was every where he was quick to die it was a painful death it was a path he thought he had to travel but he never knew how much some people would miss him. Chapter 8. What do I have to do? he was back he had enough of this life he just wanted to leave it all behind but he couldnt he just knew he had to do something right. he couldnt stand what he was going through he just felt as though he had no purpose. what was life to him he just wanted answers right then but they wouldnt come they never would.

           I never knew the way you felt I never took enough notice Eventually the feelings faded away The possibility of us was forgotten  I didn’t know what I was looking for I had tried to find out, but I failed If only I could see the amazing girl That was there in front of me  As time went on, I started to see What I had never seen before I saw you with him Wanted to be where he was But yet, I didn’t know why  We found ourselves in the same group of friends We would all talk, and play and laugh You looked happy, so I was happy for you But I still couldn’t see the truth What went on when I wasn’t around  The changing moment for me was the party I went there for fun, but more was found You told me of your crush last year I was honoured by the thought Who knew what was yet to come  Then you got to see a part of me That you hadn’t seen before This caring, funny personality Brought those early feelings back  Then I knew of the way you felt before But what was about to occur to me Was a changing moment in my life I was about to find out what it was like To want, and be wanted in return  If only you were available, it would be so simple To explore these new feelings that I had Not knowing what to do, I stayed close by We wrote each other letters, feelings were shared I discovered more about who you were  It was a hard time for you, your heart was confused He didn’t make it easy for you, impossible to understand The relationship that was once so perfect Had come into the light, and then it was over  It hurt for a while after it ended But then your heart seemed to heal It was still too soon for someone else But I had never felt like this before You were a force I couldn’t resist  I was in heaven for a while But your memories returned They turned into feelings And confusion appeared The dilemma seemed to last forever  It was between me and him You were caught in the middle The good times from before were in your mind But was this new relationship fate  What should you do, who shall you choose You thought you knew What you needed, what you wanted You chose him, disappointment, but it wasn’t over yet  I didn’t give up, on what felt so right I said that I would wait for you Confusion returned, caught in the middle again Then it was much more than before I was sure I wanted to be with you  I don’t know how it happened But your feelings for me changed Now I was just a passing phase I felt like I had been used  I can’t help the way that I feel Even if you don’t feel the same way I know I don’t truly love you yet But I think I am falling in love  He has his selfish ways Putting pressure on your decision Still you listen, you follow his plan I worry what this means for me  His deadline is up, time to find out You tell me that I am just a friend It is over before it began But I don’t feel disappointment It is much, much more  My heart is broken My eyes swell with tears Unable to speak I am lost, I can’t think I am still in love But I am alone  The crying won’t stop Why is this happening I don’t deserve to feel this way I put my heart on the line Now it is crushed, destroyed  I truly believe I am in the right place But it is just the wrong time I only want to be with you I need one chance to make it work     ♥ For Stacie.
