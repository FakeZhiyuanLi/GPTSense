      Thane Centre.  Took my batches like always. returned in 2 and half hours, took a seminar on IT careers. God I'm good !  Sometimes You feel so lone that life seems like it is meaningless, My friends at Thane centre were more than happy to see me just as much as I was to see them. These are good people. My dearest kid was there too. I hope she picked up a lesson on saying no when needed.  If i could change the world I would wish a lot of people like the ones I know well. I could get them the world.  I think i am too tied up at times.  I am such a loser I think. My life is lone. I lost all i could have procured,  1) Education 2) Time 3) The women i like (never thought i was fit enough for them anyway.)  I hate to be called a Winner, each time I am called one I realize how much I've lost. Maybe it is my ego, my depression, I try hard to make people laugh but then how much can I fool Myself. I am the fool who plays the fool. I dont have to pretend.

      Fairweather Flowers.  I smell the sweet country side, Whilst I wander the meadows, The grass, fresh from the morning dew, Sways bringing my memories to life  When I would run through the tall grasses, I had her beside me, following, I wished then as i wish now, She stays on, through all times.  Why should I feel a tear roll, Moist should becomes my eyes, tearful, I knew dreams fade away at dawn, Someday I shall realize the same.  The morning mist has faded down, To reveal a land kissed by its presence, I pick up a fairweather flower Fresh, pretty like the girl I knew.   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004

      How much does a life cost????????????? How much des love cost?        Some questions, that are so damn well formatted with bullets and numbering in my miserable life. Why do I even try to escape in this life. I am cursed to live on like this with out love.  You ask me why am i so sad? well I'm not sad i am a crazy lunatic, who does not like losing out to anything or anyone in life.     All along the lonesome highway, east of Omaha, you can hear the engine moaning out as one song. You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the life before. But your thoughts will soon be wandering like the way they always do, When you are riding 16 hours and there is nothing much to do, and you  dont feel much like travelling, you just wish the trip was through.      Here I am, on the road again, Here I am upon the stage, There I go playing star again, There I go Turn the page.     She is gone.......................................... Like the rest of them, If only i was good enough to be with atleast she would have stayed behing.  All that You build and all that you break, All that you can't leave behind.   Wish you a very happy married life  babe.

      In Life and In love I always say one thing   "Mom We are comming home"   I may be alone sometimes but I know "someone somewhere is stinking of you" concept stands.. so if they hate me they think about me all the time. So I may not find love but atleast you are there.

      Life seem so simple when you look at it when others seem to be living their's. Then again how much can you actually take before you break down and cry.  I wish to be in love once again.  There is this one girl I have forever loved: I'll explain the scenario.  I am thought of as someone who is more of a maniac running loose in a city full of complete sanity. Someone who doesn't bend, break, or even cry.I can't cry for i got no tears left, I can't bend for I'm folded on the inside, and I can't break any further for I'm atomized.  I used to be in Khandala, 1989-91; beautifully long time ago. This girl walked into my class, GOD is one crazy idiot,he always mess up my circuits. It was morning, I was on the first bench, the sun was rising, she had golden hair, and I was awestruck, She turned out to be someone who knew my mother, my sister, and i knew her brother, her sister.  In 1991 my Dad (wow) expired. Like always he messed up a perfectly good life for me by dying this time. I had to come back to a miserable place called Kalyan, I am out of touch and have been so since the past fourteen years. She was never a girlfriend infact she was one of those girls I used to run away from.(oh I remember I used to be afraid of women and I still am, they make me so nervous sometimes)  Never thought that 14 years down the line this girl will still be in my mind like a warm gentle breeze on a winter evening.  She refreshes my thoughts, She reminds me of what I am, she gives me the strength I need to stay alive, She is everywhere I am, she is in every word I say, every poem I write, Every breath, Every dream,every pore of my skin, every ray of light I bask In.  My curse is I will never know where she is, never find her, never see her, never be able to tell her how much I love her. I will be alive for a hundred thousand years, the only hurt is I always run into women I can love, but the ones I love go far away. Maybe its GOD's subtle way of telling me 'I' exist alone and I shall be existing alone for-ever.  I wish I find love soon for I need support, I may seem like a strong wall that keeps the ocean out of the way but believe me I am not.  A prayer: 'Dear Angel : // If you search my name on the internet you will find me as a poet and I wish you you do that, If you are not single any more even then atleast meet me once for I am still thinking of you and the eyes that started the fire in my heart can only be put out if I see you once more asking me to forget you.//'  I have run out of tears, I've lost faith in love but I can't let you leave out of my mind. I remember very well,you told me that you were born on 23 rd of December. I pray a minute more on that day for you.   I confess I have loved and lost not once but all those 5170 DAYS OF IT.  Being in love is a beautiful feeling. Never found any one else who can love me selflessly or without having pity on me.  There is this girl who has pity on me and has tried her best to love me but for the past 5 years that she has been trying I have managed to love her a little more that what she can.   I told you my curse stands above all my wishes and Boons. But I want to take a chance this time,   Walk into my life once again, Touch those windows before you leave, I'll touch them when you are gone, They'll remember your touch and tell me,  Drink from my tea cup, I'll serve tea each time I feel alone, I'll drink from your side as well, It'll make me feel your presence,  Touch my plants, the ones I planted in my garden, They are what I watch in the mornings first, Play around them, They will play along, When they sway in the breeze after I'll think you are still playing amongst them.  Write your name next to mine, On the lillies beside my window It yearns for your gentle touch, Touch it once before you leave, It longs for a reason to bloom   Hold my hand before you go, Let me look into your gentle eyes, I'll need to look one last time, My memories need to refreshed, I need them atleast to survive.  Call my name one last time, Fill my ears with your voice, disturb the silence that has deafened me since long, For I'll miss your calling.  The sun, the sea shore, the pond, the shadow, The wind, the hills, the valleys, The mist, the grass, the dewdrops on untouched leaves, They all remind me of you since the past fourteen years.       ------------------------------------- Curt Kobain said it correct. ------------------------------------- If I had to lose my mind; If I had to touch feelings; I would lose my soul;  Yeah I'd do; I don't have to think;  I only have to do it; The results are always perfect; But that's old news. -------------------------------------    I am crazy. But I wish to be in love.  (Pink Floyd : "Is there anybody out there?")

      All I wanted in life was pain. Now that bloody God gives me sarcastic humor.  My friends screw me up, my enemies love me and at the end of the day i rather give a gun to the enemy than a friend. Trust me never trust a friend to show up when he says he will. And when he has your hard drive and your DVD drive then never trust when he says hw will get them to you.  Remember life means more: Friends are not people who get you your hard drives and DVD drives it is like a ton of weight that is un----necessary. Do your own and collect it if you want.

      What does it take. This is what i ask sometimes. I realize that I got the power to do what I want, get what I want, all i need is to wish with closed eyes and a deep breath and I can have the world at my feet. The question - What do I want?

      What does it take to love someone. Not much.  Ah yes a great body is one asset that would make me go head over heels.  They say beauty is only skin deep. (but who wants to live with a beautiful kidney anyway, or but ugly goes clean to the bone. ).  Life is good.  I am searching for someone who can love me ( trust me u ain't seen misery if u ain't seen me).        Pain has a face :- I am Pain        This time I will hold myself back and let the one who is equally interested do the talking.    I wish I run into her soon coz the wait ain't makin me any younger u C  .  Some one I can take home to momma and say     "mom we're comming home forever this time"      That reminds me i am dreaming again.    God I got to stop drinking like this.      ----------------------------------------------------------------------   How many dreams will end,   How long can i pretend,   How many times will Time pass me by   Untill I find you again.   { (C) Richard Marx}   ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Wish You were her,oops Here.

      Somewhere far across the savagery of loneliness Deeply nested in my heart now as empty as the desert I hear a song the I sang an eon ago something that made me fall in love.  Thoughts that may never go, to leave me in sanity For these thoughts are mine and i am habituated The terminal feeling of loneliness that has been a company all along this far.  I fear  a change for I find comfort in discomfort for i know its extent I take a deep breath each time and sigh Each time love passes me by.  All i know is all I've known The madness of loving that made me pay I smiled when I paid those dues last yuletide For I lost all love when I lost my love.  I know I am a damned to a life of eternal lonliness I still like a fool watch the roads I walked Amongst the valleys and mountain side For I still carry hope deep in my heart... somewhere   (C) Copyright Ritesh Nair 2004

      At the core we all know, all that is to be known. A smile, A tear, A call, An impulse, A thought, A blink, A state of mind,etc.  ( We) The only life forms with choices and how many. A day begins giving us a choice, to accept it or reject it. Some of us accept it, Most of us don't. You are tugged, over the vast sea of life like a tugged boat. The boat seems small like all major issues that we harbourin our mind, but it pulls us to the dock, to dock at the port ofsorrow. When you are sad, you have a choice; you can forget it and walk away or go ahead and sink deep into the sands of sorrow. --------------------------------------------------------------- This is a Friend I know.   (One of the ones I really care about, no it is not pity nor is it something else.  (It is love.)  for you always need someone to love so that you can understand what unconditional love means. This is something different more like a parent who loves his daughter  (I think)  Peaceful and undemanding she makes me worried sick every time something goes wrong with her. I never ever felt this emotion in me, for though i cared a lot for people always but never so selflessly.)     This is how i analyze she is.     At the Docks :   You get off, look around, the wind blows, cold freezing.The ropes on the docks are frosted. You see the icicles dangling, transparent, coloured orange in the morning sun. You see the ice feel its cold, the sun that rises doesn't warm a thought. You shiver, your legs are frozen, you limp, to reach to the nearest bench, to settle down. The journey's been long, you have been standing all along, waiting for the shore. You have no warmth left in your sight, your breath bites your nose, you are victimized by the drudgery of sorrow. You want to run away, break free, but your heart longs, longs to be hurt. You hang on hope, hoping that the rising sun maywarm your heart. The sunlight is cold too.You are lost, you want to stop the thought, you fight, you lose, you succumb to your senses of being habituated to being down. You wsh to escape, but you lost yourself to the last change, you are afraid of change. You make a choice, you regret, you drag the feeling, fight it, fight to forget, the memory remains like a thorn embedded deep inside your mind. A thorn that you fantasize, a thorn that you lament over it.  The hurt is your addiction, wanted by every pore of your skin. You pick up your self to shatter again. You accept defeat for the feeling of accepting it gives you pleasure.  I feel for you for I've een there and felt all that, just the same.....  So you ask why I support you. I cant see you like the way I was.
