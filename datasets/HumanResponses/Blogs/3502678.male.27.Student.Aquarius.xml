      I am currently working my way through St. John of the Cross's   Dark Night of the Soul   and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. You can download or just view it for free at  urlLink Christian Classics Etheral Library . This book is incredible, it describes the process of purguing our sense and spirit of the desire for self-gratification. One thing the book so succinctly describes is the imperfections of beginners in Christianity -- the ways we let pride and self-love come between us and God. When I read this, I realized it described me and pretty much everyone I know. We are so much more interested in doing for ourselves than for God.  I think this applies to almost everything we do...I'll admit it, the idea of doing it all for God's glory scares me. Sure, I can give the idea lip service, but do I really mean it? Can I do everything in my life without any intention of gaining pleasure from the action, knowing that the only pleasure lies in glorifying God? This requires radical faith. It also requires complete separation from the habit of gaining positive sensation from spiritual exercises. If I'm only doing it to feel good...well then I'm going down the wrong road. Unfortunately this is the road that many of us follow all our lives, never knowing anything greater. Eventually, the thrill begins to fade and we are left with a prospect: do we abandon faith for something more gratifying? Or do we take faith to the next level?

      Well folks I have decided to resolve some tension here. My diaryland site is becoming more and more incomprehensible as time goes on, and it really is more of a personal cathartic thing than an acutal blog. Seeing that I would like to have a place to air more coherent thoughts without interrupting the flow of nonsense, I have decided to set up a blog here. If you are reading this, you probably came through the discussion blog I have going with my church. If so, here is a place I will attempt to get a little deeper into some of those things we discuss, as well as other issues. Of course I may just be deluding myself and I may be the only one who ever reads this, but then so much the better...  I do apologize for any inconveniences and I promise to get this site up and looking pretty asap. Bye.

      Well I have finally decided, pretty much, to move to San Francisco and possibly switch to an MA instead of an MDiv. Most of this is contingent with my aspirations to go to GTU (Berkeley) and pursue my PhD, specializing in Christian Spirituality. I realize that I am going to get a lot of strange looks and advice, but that's really ok. I'm not out to please anyone but God and I'm not looking for job security. It really doesn't make a difference if I am working at Starbucks with a Phd or teaching at Harvard, because I need to go where I can learn the most and make a contribution to the study of an area that God has called me into. I am wholly convinced at this point that spirituality (read: doctrine put into practice) is the core of Christianity, it's what makes a Christian and Christian, and it is sorely neglected in the academic community. So that's the what and the why. I have been thinking a lot about the whole "emerging church" thing of late. My feelings are quite mixed -- although I really think the church is on the verge of another reformation and this movement may be the foreshocks. It could easily be termed just another trend, and I'll tell you why from my own POV. Having been raised in a mainline Protestant church and recommitted in a contemporary evangelical church, I have seen both sides of the coin. It seems that people keep attempting to remain relevant, or to "really reach" all of those "lost people" who could care less about the church. But at the same time, the one thing I noticed prevalently in mainline churches is the structure, particularly when it comes to doctrine and practice. Yes, postmodern friends, I realize this quickly becomes a shackle and even a prison that chokes the life out of spirituality. But I believe that spirituality needs a foundation, a set of universal truths, or at least universal truths as our limited minds can comprehend them. How long will the EC be able to remain a nebulous idea without parameters? I don't think it can remain that way indefinately. Social psychology simply proves otherwise. After groups form, they begin to establish their mores. Even if they are not writing creeds or catechisms, the unwritten laws then come into play. If the EC refuses to define any type of paradigm then the cohesion will soon fade. I don't think definitions necessarily have to be a bad thing; they don't have to be prescriptive. I look back at the early church and things like the Chalcedonian definition. While this is the defining statement for early Christology, it really doesn't prescribe anything -- it merely states what Christian's  don't  believe. Maybe this is the way we need to look at doctrinal issues: defining the parameters, the playing field. Of course all the deconstructionists out there will be calling me a heretic, but that's ok -- I think we've seen that deconstruction as a paradigm is a bit self-effacing anyway.  So in keeping with the title of this post, I can truly say that I don't "hate" the institutional church. Obviously our task is to remain vigilant, and as the EC start to resemble an institution, to keep checks on how it is developing. I agree with Karl Barth that the task of the theologian is to work from within the church, constantly scrutinizing the cultural situation and the proper way to respond. Barth didn't think he was closing the canon when he wrote his dogmatics, no matter what his critics say. We will continue to work out our salvation with fear and trembling -- but remembering that it is God that works in us.

      Purity of Heart by Soren Kierkegaard is the expression of a tortured soul that longs to do the will of God. It is an attack on institutionalized spirituality that has lost its life force, and an exhortation to consider the eternal implications of every action. Kierkegaard challenges the reader to self-examination and asks the question: “Do you really will one thing?” His challenge is a powerful one, and his work is a sobering treatise on the need for a serious spiritual life. 	Kierkegaard begins Purity of Heart by comparing the temporal and the eternal. Quoting from Ecclesiastes, he notes that the notion of eternity is written on the hearts of men, but they are in denial of this fact. Human life is generally comprised of an attempt to divert attention from this fact, until death comes and it is far too late. Kierkegaard states that we only have two faculties, gifts of God’s grace, that enable us to see our lives in light of the eternal: repentance and remorse. Unfortunately, remorse only comes at the “eleventh hour,” or the hour of desperation when all human means have failed. Kierkegaard invites his reader to embrace a life of repentance and remorse before that fateful day. He claims that this can be done only by purity of heart, accomplished only by willing one thing. For Kierkegaard, this one thing is “the Good in truth.” 	However, our lives are filled with obstacles to willing the Good in truth. Sometimes we do not truly will the Good at all. We merely chase after pleasant experiences that make us feel fulfilled. For Kierkegaard, this is foolish and double-minded, for the rewards of the temporal are generally inversely proportional to the rewards of eternity. Others will the Good only to gain those rewards, while still others will the Good out of fear of punishment. Kierkegaard points out that these are inauthentic ways of living, for we often do not understand that punishment can be a part of a greater cure. Only the one who wills the Good without any consideration for self-preservation can truly be called pure of heart. 	Kierkegaard also points out more insidious forms of double-mindedness. One may will the Good egocentrically. In other words, he may want to take the credit for what the good accomplishes. This leads to an unhealthy desire for success beyond God’s intention. One may also will the Good only in part. This is a common symptom of today’s Christian, who is often so absorbed with the busyness of life that they fail to see the eternally significant things in their lives. Kierkegaard exhorts us to cut out the useless vines from our lives in pursuit of willing one thing. 	To truly will one thing, one must be willing to do all or suffer all. It does not matter how much one accomplishes. The one who suffers alone for life with true devotion to God accomplishes more in eternity than the double-minded one who makes great strides in the world. Finally, Kierkegaard challenges the group orientation of the institutions of this world. In eternity, one will stand alone before God. Therefore in this life, we must learn to be individuals and take responsibility for the eternal implications of our actions. Kierkegaard recognizes that few of us are up to this monumental task. His suggestions in Purity of Heart are intended to make us aware of our inability as well as our responsibility. He suggests the office of Confession as a means to examine ourselves and come before God with our failures. By learning the eternal significance of all we do, we can truly be said to will one thing.

      Reading a wide variety of devotional materials makes for an interesting experience. Due to the class I am taking I have read everything from Augustine to Wesley, from Pascal to Kierkegaard. I am noticing some consistant themes in all of this material, and I feel that maybe I should get these thoughts out. First of all, the notion of spirituality. Is it all about experience? Within Christianity there seems to be a divided camp. One side sees experience as overly subjective and prone to massive human error. Within the confines of doctrine, they say, we can find security. The other side scoffs at this assertion, saying that doctrine is  a finite limitation of an incomprehensible God. Of course both sides seem to agree that the center is Christ, and that God's revelation is only understandable to us in the form of the incarnation. But what are the implications? Eastern Christianity and even Catholicism seem to focus on the mystical aspect. True experience of God comes only from practicing the art of contemplation. This is a very foreign idea to a Westerner. We want to understand things from a rational perspective. Is this a good or a bad thing? Well, I think it works differently for different people.  Not that I am trying to endorse an undue amount of subjectivity. I think that neo-orthodoxy had a lot of good points - relying entirely on doctrine tends to put the cart before the horse. But after all, faith needs an object. It is in this sense that I find Pascal especially helpful. He does not deconstruct reason to the point of rendering it useless, but he does not elevate it above all. The strengths and the limitations of reason lead to a reliance upon grace, but this is far from blind faith.  I realize that I may be mixing two separate arguments here, as these questions apply both to things such as worship styles on one hand, and a personal devotional life on the other. But one of the things that seems most glaring to me is that neither doctrine nor experience exist in a vacuum. Exodus 14:31 sums it up for me: the Israelites believed because they feared(respected) God. But they feared God because God acted. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the experience of God is the end of wisdom. This can be seen most clearly in Job and Ecclesiastes, and in the ultimate deconstructionist:Christ. So perhaps I will conclude that we cannot throw out either Proverbs or Ecclesiastes, but we need each one to balance out the other, lest we put the proverbial cart before the horse! Hopefully I can come up with some concrete manifestations of this idea as time goes on.

      Some words to ponder from  urlLink sayings of the Desert Fathers .  Do not seek the perfection of the law in human virtues, for it is  not found perfect in them. Its perfection is hidden in the Cross  of Christ.   St. Mark the Ascetic   We believe that the divine presence is everywhere and that "the  eyes of the Lord are looking on the good and the evil in every  place." But we should believe this especially without any doubt  when we are assisting at the Work of God. To that end let us be  mindful always of the Prophet's words, "Serve the Lord in fear"  and again, "Sing praises wisely" and "In the sight of the Angels I  will sing praise to Thee." Let us therefore consider how we ought  to conduct ourselves in the sight of the Godhead and of His  Angels, and let us take part in the psalmody in such a way that  our mind may be in harmony with our voice.   St. Benedict   In a quest to realize the presence of God at all times, it would seem that the easiest would be in the context of "minstry" or "worship." However, I find that I am often so distracted at times like these -- perhaps it's the curse of being a former worship leader, that I am often caught up in the event itself.

      I would feel very inappropriate calling myself a "casualty" of the institutional church. There are many issues that cause some bitterness toward the Ic for me. At the same time, I'm not sure that I would be aware of the needs of the church had I not been exposed to them for so long. I was also challenged recently by a professor after voicing my opinion. I had expressed a great deal of frustration with the fact that the church seems primarily concerned with evangelism and numerical growth, subsequently leaving believers to fend for themselves with little or no equipping for the extreme challenges of the Christian life. My professor tended to agree with my observations, but asked me what I would do to change it. That's certainly a wake-up call for a whining dissenter like myself. Well, it's very easy to sit back and criticize institutions. It is a whole other matter to actually suggest and try to implement change. Like it or not, revolutions need to be started from inside the "machine." So what is my primary selling point here? If I want to act as if I have something profound to say, what is it? Like our proverbial dad says, don't criticize unless you have a way to do it better. And just to make the game a bit more challenging, let's suppose that you wanted to create a true spiritual awakening...at a megachurch. Gasp. It's theoretically pretty simple to get together a house church and raise them up to be New Testament believers. You can observe and walk alongside a small group of people with ease. You can personally mentor them and craft a program of spiritual formation, in accordance with the leading of the Spirit, that fits the individuals perfectly. But how can the pastor of a megachurch accomplish such a task? One answer, from the extreme anarchists, would be to abolish the megachurch altogether. In their opinions, the megachurch is an amalgamation of Western consumerism and Christianity taken to its absurd conclusion. It is the mutant bastard child of a desire for material gain coupled with outmoded modernist epistemology, creating a beast that manipulates the unsuspecting masses in a quest for the bottom line. I suggest that this picture is a bit paranoid and extreme. Does it contain warnings that the prudent should heed? Certainly. Let me step into utilitarian/pragmatic shoes for just a moment and suggest that the megachurch, good or bad as it is, is here to stay, at least for the time being. Since the day of salvation is today, I would be a fool to just wait until the megachurch dissolves and crumbles upon its sand-sculpted foundations. Emergent church activist types have no right to act like self-righteous uber-liberals and sit on their laurels laughing while the world crumbles around them. The megachurch evangelical is my brother, my cousin, my father in a very real since (not a literal sense). My bottom line, my foundational statement, my creed is spiritual formation. I am going to be thinking in great detail, with the megachurch in mind, of ways to bring about a paradigm shift that can and will work in the megachurch. Is it wishful thinking? Perhaps it is, but I don't think God wants his children falling by the wayside. This area is going to be a big area of focus in my doctoral research, and hopefully I will be able to flesh it out and narrow it down in the next year and a half. If you are reading this, please feel free to contact me and offer suggestions, or better yet offer dialog via any number of sites that I post on. I am no prophet or wise man, I just have gotten a taste of God that is so much more than I have ever been offered in the IC...and my heart burns to share that with those both inside and outside of the church.
