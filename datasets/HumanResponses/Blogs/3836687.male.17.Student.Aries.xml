      there was something brave and real about the way he stood. something real and neccesary about his being there, now as things just became to be important. The train was delayed, it was ususally on time. It was raining, it was autumn and autumnal with it. The rain was dense, not  forceful, dense, the light was brown with the trees, the wind agitating them, they twitched. Now that the train was running late The ticks,of the station clock were louder, there were no tocks, the people were quieter, close to the platform edge, looking along the line, desperate to be the first to see it. The first to pick up their bag, their suitcase, put out their cigarette, to prompt the same from the others.   The train wasn’t for him, he didn’t need to go anywhere. he needn’t step forward, needn’t cross the dangerously yellow line. Anyway he wasn’t the kind of man who suffered anxiety. The automated woman on the loudspeaker dolefully told the platform that the train would arrive in three minutes, that she was terribly sorry for any inconvenience that she had caused. Of course she was.  But when it did trundle in, warming the air with all its thick rumble, when he recognised her standing behind the door, when the door was slid out of her way, when she held her hat onto her head in the wind, struggling to get her suitcase out, caught on something, all that he had tried to conjure softened a little, butter left out of the fridge. She smiled grimly at him, they wouldn’t need to change this scene, they wouldn’t need to make it more dramatic, more cinematic more... more.   “Hello, Jack” “Hello Elisabeth” and the smiles, still grim grew and relaxed, this was important, and real. He was neccesary, and he still tried to be brave. He gave her his cigarette, she smiled him her gratit ude, she meant it. “How’s things?” he spluttered a half coughed snigger, the question was not one that needed answering.   There was no car, he had walked. He took her suitcase, it was a little way back, they both enjoyed the rain, it was exciting. They spoke, about other people, gossip really, it was not the time for talk of themselves. They wondered together about houses they passed about curtains closed and curtains open, about the pristeen and the derelict. This was very easy talk. Her visit, their being together again, for though they were so instantly comfortable again, though they so easily slipped back into old routines, they had not seen one another  for a time now, no, of course there were real reasons for all this, best not talked about yet though, they both knew.  The bush alongside the path had been neglected, the water hanging under all the leaves was bothered coldly off onto their clothes. He fumbled for the keys, found them and opened the door. He turned the light on, set her suitcase down. took of his hat, and coat, stood, he watched her, take of hers, his arm out to take it from her, she was really very thin, beautifully but sadly so.

      sorry to inflict this upon any poor lonely traveller who encounters my blog, but I like it! I wrote it the other night, sitting outside, listening to devendra banhart  All the little points that cut and glisten off of the underneath of leaves, glowing, placed so carefully, held so tentatively, they could never fall. Of course they could, of course they could trip, drip, adding to the murmurs in the cold air. Cold air that makes your skin feel wet, and clean, and alive, the kind of feeling only cliches can properly express. I can still taste the smoke and the coffee, sitting half out of the back door like this. And the music too, delicate so not to disturb anything, not smothering, just laying itself over everything. Like the drops of water it is attached, held by its own aesthetic neccesity. It feels all so tightly strung, but with the smallest strongest threads, the spider hiding always just out of sight watching, its web so alluring. Even the trains and the traffic just rumble everything into life, they can do nothing to crumble and dissolve what there is here.  and something else I just found in my notebook.  Sharp green giggles Keen for colour Peek in a little dying snow And watching all this new warm with chill and shiver Held tight in rich warm wool Held tight  with kissing early morning light  Well the stupid machine won't let me publish this crap so I'll write a little more. I just had a really nice supper, bruschetta (sort of) with salad and parmesan all over it, it was delicious and now the garlic that lingers in my mouth makes me want more!

      Wow this is pretty wild isn't it, Isn't It? Maybe not then. I thought I'd do this, I don't know why but anyhow, life goes on tiddly pom. I've tried keeping a diary before but have always failed but maybe this is the answer, who knows? I sure as hell don't.  there's something very primal about standing in a field while your embarrassingly drunk friend, sprawled on all fours, vomits and retches explosively. Its sort of, reassuring. The moon lights pale glow and the trees shaking and shivering in the wind, while the sound of vomit hitting the floor behind you, as you avert your eyes, cuts hard against the air, this is such stuff as dreams are made of, surely it doesn't get much better than this. But once your friend has told you for the hundredth time that he's cold but he doesn't want to move, he wants to go home but he doesn't want to stand up, that's when the fun really starts kicking off. Oh well, I suppose that that is how the cookie crumbles, If the situation is ever reversed, I will be sure to be as awkward and as irritating as is really possible.  I finished my a-levels a little while ago, last Wednesday and its all a bit weird, to know that I have already either failed or passed, that all my grades are out there sort of floating in the ether. That some poor unfortunate exam marker has to put up with my rubbish essays, that they have to try their best to decipher my frantic handwriting and somehow read through my lack of grammar to make sense of what they have in front of them, just enough to be able to give me an atrocious mark! I keep sitting down to watch television or listen to music and thinking 'I shouldn't be lazing around like this I should be working, before I realise now it really is too late, there is nothing to be done.  The stupid computer seems to be refusing me the privelege of posting this crap, I didn't think that computers were designed to be critical, and you'd think they could at least be a little more constructive, bastard. I'll try again but I may be back soon...
