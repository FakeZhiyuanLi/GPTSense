      Haha alright, now, I don't know when he'll be reading this, but he'll be very happy when he does.&nbsp; Jaime, I had a dream about YOU last night, but it was soooo random!  We were at school, but it felt like the summer.&nbsp; As if we weren't supposed to be there, but we were for whatever.&nbsp; I was with Jaime, and I think Austin.&nbsp; Jaime, you took us to your house which happened to by right by the school, and it ws a small street that sorta circled at the end (like mine, so you get the picture) but these houses were HUGE, friggin massive.&nbsp; So, we went in your house and there was a very long bench in the middle of the hall and your mom and dad were there.&nbsp; Your mom was standing by a fire, or a cooking pot (i cant remeber) and your dad was holding a classical guitar.&nbsp; Actually, he was playing it.&nbsp; The three of us sat down on the bench and listen to your dad play, I was really impessed beacuse he was good.&nbsp; After a few minutes we had to go, and your mom told me I should come back again at 9:30, when I can hear him play longer.&nbsp; I guess we walked in on him playing, and he had been playing for a while already.. anyway, it was strange.&nbsp; So we leave.&nbsp; It may have been at this point where I woke up.&nbsp; If not, well whatever.&nbsp; Anyway, I did go back at 9:30 and when I went into the house the long bench as filled with guys, and guitars!&nbsp; Each guitar was different though.&nbsp; But it was so cool, all the guys were soo good looking, and I was in heaven.&nbsp; I sat down where there was some room, and I just basically talked to all the guys and asked them about their guitars.&nbsp; I remeber flirting with them to, oh I felt so good in the dream.&nbsp; lol  OK that's basically it.&nbsp; I cant remeber what happened after the guys.&nbsp; Anyway, crazzyness, can't wait to see what dream I have tonight!&nbsp; cheers

      Welcome to my first dream recording!&nbsp; MWAHAHA&nbsp; The dream I had last night was a happy one, and I talked to an old friend.&nbsp; Ok so let's just begin before I forget it.  I was at school, and it was winter.&nbsp; I was starting to walk up the hill but my cell rang.&nbsp; I picked it up, and wtf it was Corum!&nbsp; I haven't talked to him for sooo long, and it was him!&nbsp; I guess the wold I was living in was a lot different then what I live now... sigh.&nbsp; Alright, so I satrt talking to him, butnow I'm walking back towards the school, and random!&nbsp; Mitchell is in a car with a bunch of older guys saying, 'I can't give you a ride!'&nbsp; Okay...&nbsp; dammit.&nbsp; I'm still on the phone with Corum, but then all of a suddon I slip on the ice and my phone flies into the air and wham, on the groud.&nbsp; I reached for it, and I heard someone talking, but it was my dad.&nbsp; I told him I needed a ride and he said sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to keep talking to Corum so I tried finding his number in my recent callers.&nbsp; I friend sending him a message&nbsp;but then, this picture showed up on my phone&nbsp;and said I coudn't send him a message because he was out west!!&nbsp; Ok.....&nbsp; but I felt so special that he called me from all the way out west... hehe &nbsp;Then I woke up.  Next time I fell a sleep I can't remeber where I was, I think it had something to do with my previous dream, but I ended up wtih colourful hair and I told my mom not to kill me.&nbsp; heh.  My last dream was a really weird dejavu.&nbsp; I was at Kira's house again like I was on Wednesday.&nbsp; We were swimming and diving for pennies.&nbsp; I remeber when were actually doing it I did so baddly because my goggles kept filly up with water and I really can't holf my breath for that long.&nbsp; Plus Kira is a swimmer.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; Anyway, I remeber the last time we went diving, we didn't really pick up all the pennies.&nbsp; We kept having to dive for them and actually look for them.&nbsp; So, in this dream, I was just at her house diving.&nbsp; I was under water and I actually found some of the pennies we forgot, but as I went to pick them up, more kept appearing!&nbsp; But it was so cool, I could hold my breath for a lot longer..&nbsp; It's like, omg I was KIRA IN MY DREAM!!!&nbsp; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  &nbsp; hokay&nbsp;everybady, that was last nights dream.&nbsp; Man, I CAN'T wait to fall asleep tonight!!!!
