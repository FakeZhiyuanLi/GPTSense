      I had been in Parintins for 4 months now.  I was feeling like I would be there forever.  The River was rising because of all the rain. It seemed as if it would never stop.  It rained everyday between 11:00 in the morning and 1:00 in the afternoon.  We would joke with the natives saying, "I'll come over to your house after the rain," because with out fail it always rained.    If you were to look at a map of the Amazon jungle, Parintins can be found if you follow the Amazon River heading east from its birth.  Parintins is an Island surrounded by rivers.  During the rain season it becomes 4 small Islands.  Most natives get around using bicycles and small canoes.    Zone conference time ( a big meeting we need to get to by boat )   I loved Zone conference.  After 4 months of looking at only one other American, (we called each other comps) finally we could mingle with other adventurous missionaries like our selves in another area called Itaquatiara.  With a slight fog, and the animal sounds of the morning, we were on our way.  The air was so humid and damp that it felt like we were walking in a sauna. The lush vegetation surrounding us was tall and thick, giving us wonderful smells and the feel of inferiority as we struggled through the brush with our bags.   We weren’t on top of the food chain anymore, and we knew it.  Now the boat really didn’t look like much, after all the tickets were a measly 7 dollars, but we rode on that sucker for 17 hours.  It was 3 stories high with no walls on its sides.  You could see in to each level from the pier.  The bottom two levels were open areas with poles and hooks on the ceilings for us to tie up our hammocks.   The top level was open for eating and dancing, with tables and chairs and a dance floor.  Everyone slept side by side swaying with the rock of the boat.  The Amazon River is huge.  It looks like a “chocolate milk” ocean flowing sideways with the power to take anything with it in its path.  Natives love to swim, they were always in the water cleaning dishes and doing laundry.  But they never go near the big Amazon because it’s not safe.  It was full of life.  With snakes, pink dolphins (that are not friendly), and other creatures that some say can swallow you whole.  As I watched the river, safely from the boat, the fear of falling in and being tossed about helplessly by the giant brutal river consumed my thoughts.  I noticed the boat would always travel along the side of the river.  And when it needing to cross, it would turn at a 90-degree angle and speed across to the other side.  I asked one of the sailors on board why they crossed the river so fast?  Glaring at me as if I had asked the craziest question in the world he said sarcastically, ”Because we don’t want to die, if we go down while in the middle of the river, no one will make it.”  After 18 hours of boat life, I was ready to enjoy dry land again.  It was nighttime and the sky was full of stars.  The green jungle had turned into a deep blackness that surrounded us from every direction.  The boat coasted to a stop at the pier and we calmly skipped off the boat relieved and ready for a good nights sleep.   The next few days were great.  We explored the little city and enjoyed the company of the 8 missionaries that lived in the area.  Now, there was a rumor that the boat didn’t stop at the pier on the way back to Parintins.  Something about not having enough passengers to pick up, and it not being worth the time.  Instead we needed to take a tiny boat out to the middle of the river and jump to big one.  The more I heard the stories of people jumping through the air while the 2 speeding vessels competed in a deadly race up river.  The more I didn’t believe it.  These missionaries stared showing me cuts and scrapes from their personal experience doing it, could this really be true?  I don’t want to die out here.  “This can’t be happening,” I said to my self.  Every time I asked someone for details I got a half explained story that made no sense.  The clock kept ticking and with out any resistance our time had come to face the river. It was about 11:00, and there was a boat waiting for us near the pier.  There were 2 girls sitting in the front and some dude with his bike sitting in the back.   I thought to my self, “if these girls aren’t scared I better not be!” We hopped in and took a 5-minute ride out to the big boat.  We could see the boats lights and reached it quickly with ease.  The Larger boat stopped and we simply coasted near it and hopped on.  It was totally easy.    Those buttheads had really played a good trick on me, I laughed to my self and soon fell asleep swaying calmly in my hammock.   A month passed and it was time to go back for Zone conference.  Once we got to Itaquatiara and didn’t even talk about our previous experience.  The previous missionaries had been transferred, so there was no one to get mad at.  The time flew as usual in that jungle city.  We were experienced travelers in the Amazon; we didn’t have a care in the world.  After the first trip, It was like vacation.  That last night in Itaquatiara was great.  We were really hungry and had just received our monthly allowance of 100.00 reals.  (Brazilian money) this was enough to eat for two weeks then barely get by the rest of the month (a big time money management lesson.)  Anyway.  We decided to eat hamburgers.  We ate at a cool restaurant near the river so we could watch for the boat and enjoy our last night in Itaquatiara.   The egg, cheese and bacon burger was great. We sipped our Guarana Bare, (a carbonated beverage) and finished up our fries.  Suddenly it started raining, through the water streaming down the window we could see a blur of lights in the shape of a boat way out in the river.  Slightly panicking, with a rush and energy, we paid for our food and ran out into the storm towards the pier.  We understood what Forrest Gump was talking about with that “big old fat rain,” we were soaked in seconds.  We ran as fast as we could for 2 blocks only to find out that we had missed our boat.   Learning that there would be another in 2 more hours, we sat under a bench covered with sheet metal.  That cover made more racket then black cat firecrackers on the 4th of July.  The rain was just pounding the crap out of that sheet metal.  It was hard to have any real conversation so we just sat there wet and cold waiting for that blasted boat.   I live in San Diego, We have piers that stand hundreds of feet above the water and reach way out into the ocean.  They are great for watching the sunset or watching surf nuts shoot out between the columns.  This pier we were on was much smaller, standing maybe 5 feet above the water.  The boards were all different lengths and some were as far as a foot apart.   Soon we heard the sound of a walkie talkie, and saw the hands of the pier worker motioning us to get ready to catch our boat.  We walked towards the dock and found a boat half the size of the last boat.  With my Gym bag tightly caught between my knees and my right and left hands gripping both sides of the boat, I felt the thrust of the engine dart us out into that stormy river.  I could barely hang on feeling my hands slipping with every jump the boat made wave after wave.  The rain was so strong I could barely open my eyes and my grip was weakened more and more with the water slapping me harder and harder.  After an eternity of bouncing we had reached the boat and made a sharp left to run parallel to it.  We were bouncing even higher now because of the wake of the big boat.  All I wanted was for it all to stop.  The other man that came out with us stood up, threw his bag onto the boat, and jumped grabbing the rail like a mad man.    You see, the boat was built different then the first.  The other one was low and you could easily walk on to the lower level.  This was was taller.  The floor of the lower level was at least 5 feet high and the lowest rail was 6 feet.  With the movement of the small boat and no real momentum, you needed frog legs to get real air.   The Man driving the boat screamed, “Cai Fora,” which means, “get out of here.”  There was no way I could make it.  Panic ran through my entire body, I was terrified.    There is something you need to know about me, I’m 5’5” and I just can’t jump.  My comp being 6’2” barely made it to the boat.   I threw my bag on to the boat and jumped for it.  The smaller boat sped away and left me dangling like a fish on hook.  I was already so tired and the bar was so wide that my small hands could scarcely hang on.  The sound of the engine and the thought of being chopped up flashed through my mind.  If I miraculously slipped between the engine and its moving parts, I would be at the mercy of the great river in the middle of the night tossing and gasping for air.   My comp saved my life that night.  He reached down and pulled me up with my shirt.  I was able to use my last bit of strength and pull my self over the rail.   Laying on my back, wet and bewildered, I looked over at my comp.  He was breathing hard and giving me a small smile, (probably thinking, what a ride!) he then said,” They weren’t lying after all!”

      I have always liked the look of someone who was in really good shape. All through my elementary years, and through most of my Junior High years, I was chubby. I really hated that. I have always been the chubbiest out of my friends. When we would go swimming or out doors to do something fun, I would always feel funny. On top of that, I was a pansy. I would get bloody noses, stomach problems, other internal problems. One of my friends started working at a gym, and through him I started working out. I really didn't know what I was doing, but for the first time in my life I found something I could do at my own pace, with out loosing, and feel really good about. I started seeing differences in my body, which was nice, but what I felt was much more exhilarating than anything. I had all this extra energy. I would hang out with my friends and found my self-running, swimming, hiking, and just living so much more. I still felt like the same person, but I just enjoyed my self more. It’s not the love of abs and big pecks that gets you happiness. Its not girls looking at you or complements from others. They are nice, but feeling like you can run, climb, swim and play is the greatest feeling on earth. I was actually still a little chubby. I never got a six-pack but I was much healthier. Soon after this, I decided to go on a mission. I served in the Amazon jungle. I lost allot of weight because I wasn't weightlifting anymore, but I still felt amazing. I was strong and able to work harder and concentrate better then ever before. My diet completely changed. In Brazil they don't eat large dinners, the largest meal of the day is at lunchtime. They mainly eat, rice, beans, salads, and tons of fruits. I would drink new fruit juices every day, up until my last week of the mission, I was still trying new fruits because there were so many types. I would only speak Portuguese. We lived in an apartment in the same neighborhoods as anyone else. We ate the same foods and were with Brazilians all day long. Some were from the southern part of Brazil living in the North for their various reasons and some were decedents from Native Indians from the Jungle. Most of the roads aren't paved and there are dense forest areas everywhere. We would walk for hours from house to house. I have great memories of walking along-side Rivers, in the dark with all the sounds of nature all around you. The moon was very bright and I had never seen so many stars ever. People in the Amazon are really friendly and sometime try to be your parents. If I ever had a headache or a cut, they would walk with me in the forest and show me a variety plants, berries, bark and nuts that could help with my ailments. I usually would just ask them to prepare different remedies for me because we were so busy serving others. Soon my 2 years had passed. Part of me had to be left behind because my heart was so full of love for these people and this part of the world that I just have to go back someday. Being back in the City I started having similar problems just like before my mission. I had a weak stomach. I was starting to get colds and other types of ailments. I was becoming like my old self again. Realizing this, I became frantic and started eating the best I could and exercising more. But I still gained all my weight back, and my illnesses were back. Every time I drove by an import store, I would stop by to see if they had anything I was familiar with. But they mostly had candies and junk foods. After much disappointment, I gave up only to hope to be able to go back someday. One day, I was sitting in a Souplantation. I was sipping my soup and noticed that some one had forgotten their health magazine on our table. I couldn't really call it a health magazine. It was more like a weekly reader, but it contained the missing link I had been searching for. I found an advertisement for Amazon herbs. I called and was given some samples. Not bad. But then I decided I wanted to learn more. After studying on the Internet and getting a hold of a local distributor, I just had to try. It’s the same stuff. I'm feeling energy just like before. I ate a carne assada burrito (steak burrito) and a fat steak at Black Angus. I was able to digest it just fine. They have herbal combinations for everything your body needs, thyroid problems, weak immune system problems, digestion problems you name it. Of course it’s not a miracle drug. They are natural herbs, you still need to eat healthy, exercise, and sleep well, but they make a difference. Well I'm sharing my experience with every one I come in contact with. Every one who has tried one of the herbs has been more than satisfied. So I just want to say again. If you are tired of being sick, fat, lazy or just not in the best health. Try what Mother Nature has given us for our benefit and live happy.
