       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Sunshine -Lil' Flip feat. Lea  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #10  Ever since  Fat Joe  broke out with the smash “Whats Luv?” in late 2002, which featured guest vocalist  Ashanti , it seems that numerous thug-rapper/fox-crooner pairs have tried to answer that very question. Soon thereafter,  Ja Rule  released “Always on Time” (again with  Ashanti ), a song pushing the message that love is all about, well, promptness. Most recently, new rapper  Lloyd  made an attempt to reply with “Southside,” a 2004 single featuring (any guesses?)  Ashanti  that had a decent run on the charts. That duo thought that love was all about secretive sex (“Make sure your daddy just don’t know”), but that still didn’t seem to be it. Then, when the world seemed at a lost for an answer, Lil’ Flip released the second single from  U Gotta Feel Me , the playfully titled “Sunshine.” Subbing in the melodious Lea for  Ashanti , Flip rapped over juicy keyboards and electronic rays and revealed that both  Ja Rule  and  Lloyd  were pretty close; a lady does need to be on time (“Pick me up at 8:00, don’t be late”) and she needs to be kinky on the down low (“I need a freak in the sheets”), but Flip continued to completely answer that year-old Fat Joe query: “We don't have to be in love, we can just be friends!” Finally, an ode to friends-with-benefits that answers what love is really about : not being in love. But while this tender hip-hop ballad is ‘04’s beachside anthem, Flip actually lies a little bit. When he says that he’ll “treat you like milk [and] do nothing but spoil you,” he means more than he’ll “treat you like milk [and] have you waiting outside his door once a week so that he can bring you in, pop off your top, and pass you around the dinner table so everyone gets a mouthful.” I think.   The Verdict:  6.2/10 - The Fork   (3.1/5)

       The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy ,  the Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical) . We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #3: Lil’ Jon    000000000        Write Up    Bursting onto the scene with the irrestistable “Get Low,” Lil’ Jon went from being an underground no-name (with the infamous  Lil’  moniker) to a household pop culture icon. He soon was parodied by  Dave Chappelle , one of the truest signs that you’ve made it, as he continued to produce into 2004. Since 1997, he and group  the Eastside Boyz  have made geographically-limited crunk rap, mixing party spirits with arena beats. It wasn’t until 2003 when he started to produce for up-and-coming Southern groups, but he soon had a firm grasp on the  Billboard  charts, exercising the right to take dancefloors by the neck whenever he released a new track. Maybe one of the keys to his success was appearance, looking like a brother of  Cousin Itt  who stumbled into a rap career because he could wake comatose victims with his rasp. Jon seems the perfect player to get a party started, whether you want him on the vocals or on the beat, both of which he’s proved capable of. A  Grammy  for this young producer would be astonishing, but he’s definitely in the running. Consistently putting out new tracks this year, he seems to be at his highest work ethic to date, unselfishly dishing out some backbeats that he knows will burn up the charts. Those backbeats are extremely recognizable, sometimes just because Lil’ Jon throws his own voice into the mix with traditional  yeahs ,  whats , and  heys . If you like to dance, Lil’ Jon is your go-to man, never failing to ignite the boogying spark. Whether or not he can pick up the  Producer(s)   Grammy  is questionable, but keeping the world in motion is one hell of a consolation.     History and Mentionable Tracks Timeline       Select tracks followed by     Billboard charting     1997:   Who U Wit -  Lil’ Jon & the Eastside Boyz   2000:   I Like Dem Girlz -  Lil’ Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz   2001:   Bia’Bia’ -  Lil’ Jon & the Eastside Boyz   (#94)   ooooo0  Put Yo Hood Up -  Lil’ Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz   2002:   Nothins Free - Lil’ Jon & the Eastside Boyz   ooooo0  Rep Yo City - E-40   2003:   Shake That Monkey - Too $hort feat. Lil’ Jon   (#84)   ooooo0  Quick to Back Down - Bravehearts      Career Blotches     Damn! - Youngbloodz   (#4)  In 2003, one of  Lil’ Jon’s  go-to Southern duos (a subset including the  Ying Yang Twins  and  Bravehearts ) burst onto the scene boasting “We don’t give a damn, we don’t give a fuck!” Over a key-changing string line and a simply engineered drum loop, the world was introduced to two of the Dirty South’s newest dentist-pleasers, mouths blinged and words crunked. Yes, the single hit the #4 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 . Yes, the success of “Damn!” was able to propel the Youngbloodz debut release,  Drankin’ Patnaz , to the #5 spot on the  Billboard 200 . And yes, the song will guarantee interest in the group’s future misspellings. But I don’t give a damn, and I don’t give a fuck. This track is a mid-tempo mess, abandoning high-speed party rap for laid-back rasping in the vein of  Bone Crusher  (most notably on his brilliant “Never Scared”), but neither member of the Bloodz packs half of his fright. Being a first single, all the world wanted was a taste. Unfortunately, the Youngbloodz barked, but they didn’t bite.   Salt Shaker - Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil’ Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz   (#9)  Using a bouncing bass and club percussion,  Lil’ Jon  tried to rewrite “Get Low” with the Ying Yang Twins’ “Salt Shaker.” Regrettably, this track may have finally turned women against  Lil’ Jon’s  producing career. After all, since bursting onto the scene by demanding that the ladies “get low,” he continued by commanding them to “shake that monkey” (a  Too $hort  single) and now to “shake it like a salt shaker.” Visit any  Surgeon General  and he’ll tell you that shaking your monkey while you’re already getting low and salt-shaking will cause some urban hospital visits, if not death. On top of that,  Jon’s  beat is repetitive and lax, reaching a climax only when spiced with some flute trills during the song’s chorus. Marking this club hit as the end of an era,  Lil’ Jon  started to shine away from heavy-crunk ruckus anthems, producing new-sounding music in 2004. Good thing too, because if he didn’t stop there then every baby momma would have back problems.     Career Highlights     Get Low - Lil’ Jon & the Eastside Boyz   (#2)  “Get Low” is easily the best and most original single to come out of the Dirty South underground. Lil’ Jon’s remarkable production makes the track; he could get paraplegics dancing with the arena static bass line, the garage synth attack, and, most memorably, the melody-mimicking lollipop brigade (heard when the Eastsiders pepper the music with dum-dum-dums). This track takes all the likable elements of crunk (rabble-rousing vocals, a vicious but danceable beat, and head-occupying catchphrases) to an artistic peak for the genre, culminating in millions of club-goers violating fire hazards by leaning towards the nearest window and, subsequently, the nearest wall. Actually, the fine lady that inspired some of this party babble was only a 9, evidence being a memorable lyric. That’s right; she was only “standing real fine.” Just think of what Jon and the Boyz could have done if she was a perfect ten.     2004 Mentionable Tracks (Potential Grammy Material)     Jook Gal - Elephant Man feat. Lil’ Jon   (#57)  If “Yeah!” was crunk R&B, then this is crunk dancehall. Taking that incessant coolie skank riddim beat (also used in  Nina Sky’s  “Move Ya Body” and then  Pitbull’s  “Culo”) to its limit,  Lil’ Jon  and Elephant Man swapped the mic back and forth to see who could out-holler who. The winner? No one. Dancehalls and dancefloors alike quickly pushed this track out of rotation, not letting it achieve nearly the success of previous  Lil’ Jon  dance productions (reaching only the #57 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 ). By 2004, the world was tired of Jamaican jibber-jabber (thanks  Sean Paul ) and  Lil’ Jon  boogie hits (thanks casual sex), a duo of problems that ultimately killed this track before anyone even heard it.   Yeah! - Usher feat. Ludacris and Lil’ Jon   (#1)  Mapped out by Ludacris in the final words of this track, “Yeah!” put together the hottest soul singer (Usher, “the voice”), the loudest party roaster (Lil’ Jon, “the beat”) and the naughtiest lyrical prankster (Ludacris, “the flow”) for one of this century’s sickest club songs. And, most importantly, each member can make your booty go [insert whip crack here]. All that considered, though, it seems necessary to point out how Lil’ Jon pulled a fast one on the world with this #1 smash. All he did was reverse the string line from the  Youngbloodz'  “Damn!” from   low-higher, low-high   to   low-high, low-higher   for the “Yeah!” beat (listen to the tracks to see what the fuck I mean). In fact, the second half of “Yeah!”s infamous opening synth line is the exact same beat pattern as featured in “Damn!” Then, Jon shipped off the single, labeled it his “first crunk-meets-R&amp;B production,” and dropped 2004’s biggest jam. Hell, we should have seen it coming; “Yeah!” and “Damn!,” two one-word exclamatory hits penned by king of crunk Lil’ Jon, released less than a year apart. I could stay nit-picky and continue to bitch about how lucky Jon is that the world has a weak ear for similarity, but let’s face it: The buzz-saw synth stabs, echoed keyboard shakes, and fluttering pan flutes make for one hell of a beat, reused or not, to play beneath Usher’s unforgettably contemplative vocals and Ludacris’s life-of-the-party flow. Crunk’s finest may have fooled us, but at least he provided a soundtrack.   Freek-A-Leek - Petey Pablo   (#7)  Both the  Neptunes  and  Timbaland  still sound fresh with every single that they produce, even with the occasional misstep, like the  Neptune’s  light synth pop of  Jay-Z’s  “Change Clothes” at the close of 2003.  Lil’ Jon , on the other hand, produced a total of two 2004 singles before turning stale, namely  Usher’s  “Yeah!” and this song, Petey Pablo’s “Freek-A-Leek.” The two productions are devastatingly similar; they are both based around a looped synth-buzz line, they both hit vibrating spoons in the otherwise minimal percussion section, they both use haywire flutes to mimic any singing, they both have a chorus that drops the title on the first beat of every measure, and they both have barely audible bass lines used only to reinforce the instrumentation. Perhaps the most blatant evidence of this equivalence is the two couplets dropped in each song, one by  Ludacris  (“Take that and rewind it back/Lil’ Jon got the beat that make your booty go…”) and one by Pablo (“Would ya do it from the front, would ya take it from the back/Gonna break it down like that”). The only thing that makes “Freek-A-Leek” original is its subject matter and rapped verses, which are average at best (save Pablo’s ghetto name laundry-listing in the chorus, the song’s one highlight). In all fairness to Petey, “Freek-A-Leek” would have been much bigger had its release date preceded that of “Yeah!,” but one might get the feeling that Pablo was too busy acquiring diseases to notice this.   Culo - Pitbull feat. Lil’ Jon   (#32)  Recycling the same coolie skank riddim from  Elephant Man’s  “Jook Gal,” Lil’ Jon added some Latin flavor to craft Pitbull’s “Culo.” With a chorus that Americans couldn’t understand (something that seems to draw us in, citing as evidence  Eiffel 65’s  “Blue”), Jon mixed the dancehall drumming with some demented flutes for the best track to use that incessant rhythm (even trumping  Nina Sky’s  “Move Ya Body”). Maybe speaking less to dancing, more to personal hygiene (key lyric: “If you shave I'll give you some of this mighty tongue”), Pitbull broke out of an ethnic mold to hit crossover success with “Culo.” The best part of the track seems to be its haywire performance, sounding like the audio equivalent to street basketball, without fouls or bounds. Remembering Lil’ Jon’s “Yeah!,”  Ludacris  pointed out how he wanted “a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed.” In opposition to that, the guys of Pitbull announced their want for a “freak, a monster in bed, last thing I need is a lady.” Finally, a group that makes it seem like Ludacris is a classy guy.   Goodies - Ciara feat. Petey Pablo   (currently #15)  Introducing a young new artist by pairing her with hip-hop’s current most-horny lyricist,  Lil’ Jon  gave Ciara a club hit with “Goodies.” ’04 Bonnie & Clyde? No, more like updated R. Kelly &amp; victim. While Petey blathers away about how he could have sex with the planet in three months (do I see the sequel to  Around the World in 80 Days  in  Disney’s  future?), Ciara plays the innocent side chick who won’t give up her goodies to just anyone. Jon’s beat may sound futuristic, but its more outdated. Those techno squeaks came right out of  Timbaland’s  scrapbook (remember  Missy’s  “Work It?), and that sugary guitar honey has been in use for years. Still, the track is intriguing, as Ciara perfectly contraries Petey’s gruffness with high-pitched virginity squeals. The production, just to be frank, is what holds this track down. The individual performances are stellar.

       Nicholas Cage , the 40 year-old actor who most recently starred in the  The Life of David Gale , married 20 year-old ex-waitress  Alice Kim  today, July 30th. This is  Cage's  third marriage, with previous weddings to rock princess  Lisa Maria Presley  (2002) and actress  Patricia Arquette.  That makes this wedding  Cage's  first marriage to an average joess (and  Kim's  first marriage in general). The two met at the sushi restaurant where  Kim  worked, began dating in February, and got engaged two months later.  0000000000     00000   Asked to comment on their sex life,  Kim  said that  Nick  is usually "gone in sixty seconds."

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Goodies -Ciara feat. Petey Pablo  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #15   Britney Spears , from her 2001 hit “I’m a  Slave 4 U”: “All you people look at me like I'm a little girl.”  Ciara , from her current “Goodies”: “You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl.” Okay, we get it. Ciara is the newest  Lolita , once a virgin temptation now looking to break her seal as a sex-savvy fox. But wait; with continual listening, we start to hear some surprising lyrics. Backed by funk guitars taken from  Lloyd Banks’  “On Fire” (a song about being hot), high-pitched techno squeals stolen from  Missy Elliott’s  “Work It” (a song about sex), and echoed synth chords copped from guest-verbalist  Petey Pablo’s   “Freek-A-Leek” (a song about hot sex),  Ciara  croons this line: “[If you’re] lookin’ for the goodies, keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar.”  What?  Everything about this  Lil’ Jon  production pushes secretive, sweaty love-making, all down to  Ciara’s  bedside whimpers during the chorus. But, like  Mis-Teeq’s  “Scandalous” (“A one night stand just ain’t enough”), this is a summer club jam against fast lifestyles. Being a prude never sounded so sleazy, and that illustrates the unfortunate downfall of this track:  Ciara  can’t sound this seductive when singing that “[she's] not goin’ home with you.”   The Verdict:  4.0/10 - Brouhaha   (2.0/5)

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Confessions Part II -Usher Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #1 What the hell happened to  Mario Winans’  fine logic? Earlier this year, he and  P. Diddy  dropped “I Don’t Wanna Know,” a perfectly lovesick jam that idealized adultery;  Winans  begged not to be told about his significant other’s wanderings astray, citing as reason the fact that “[his] heart [couldn’t] take it anymore.” Then along came  Usher  midway through the summer, completely ignoring  Winans  by diarizing his infidelity and preaching it in song form to his girlfriend.  Usher’s  reason? His “chick on the side” is three months pregnant, and she’s keeping it. Rambling on through some up-step piano chords and a looped synth line, Usher picked one of the less interesting tracks from  Confessions  as a third single just because he wanted the whole world to know. Sure, it hit #1 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , but that’s just because Usher took the world by storm with “Yeah!” and “Burn,” making this track little more than a side dish (not unlike that mom-to-be mentioned throughout).  Mario Winans  didn’t want to know.  Usher  told all. If they were a couple, things could be getting really out of hand.    The Verdict:  5.0/10 - Brouhaha   (2.5/5)

         The Deal:   With the  2004 Olympic Summer Games  approaching right during the last leg of the baseball season, the  steroid craze  will be at an ultimate high. We've have testimony going on for months now in baseball, and we've had athletes admit to pre- Olympic  steroid use in the past. Even star outfielder  Gary Sheffield  outlashed against the extremist speculation going on, pushing the message that neither the fans nor the players are enjoying the whole scandal.    The Question:   Why is the drugs-in-sports issue such a big deal? Steroids have been around since the beginning of time-how the fuck do you think the tortoise beat the hare?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Deal:   Yesterday in  Houston, Texas,   Michael Jackson  surprised mall shoppers by showing up in a toy story after “business” (according to a publicist). Jackson went on a shopping spree for toys and stuffed animals, but ended up signing autographs for young fans and their parents.                        The Question:   Why didn't Jackson's media team advertise the toy store trip so that more fans would show up? Oh, maybe the Houston mall didn't want to publicly announce that  "Michael Jackson Will Be Cumming Today ."

According to an&nbsp;anonymous woman, Anderson "lured her into his trailer" and continued to sexually harass her. This incident may also explain the original title of the movie,  Kanjaroo Jack Me Off Bitch or I'm A Beat Your Mouth Wit' My Shoe.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy ,  the Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical) . We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #5: The Trak Starz (Zo and Sham)    000000000    Write Up  Extremely new to the rap game, the Trak Starz produced most of  Chingy’s  savory ’03 debut,  Jackpot,  and went on to become popular for danceable hits with crossover Southern flavor. Nonexistent before that Chingy release, soon gained critical and social success for their work, dropping three top ten singles along the way to guarantee future success. The ’03-’04 hip-hop era seemed the perfect time for their work, as young hipsters looked more to  Ludacris  than  Nas  for hits, begging for more of that rabble-rousing, “I’ll-drink-to-that” production, a sound that the Trak Starz have conveniently mastered. That rise in party-hard Southern rap may be the only reason that the twosome is able to dominate the charts, and it is fair to equate their lifespan to the length of the genre’s popularity, but hitting hip-hop trends at the right time is nothing to be humiliated by (hell,  Rubin  did it with the  Beastie Boys  in ’86,  Dre  did it with  Snoop  in ’93, and  Diddy  did it with  Biggy  in ’95). If anyone can continue the success of today’s radio rap, it seems to be the Trak Boyz, even if each of their productions sound cut, edited and shipped from the same exact spot in the same exact recording studio. They introduced us to Chingy, a fine replacement for the slowly-fading  Nelly , and now  Houston , a fine second-stringer in the newer  McDonalds  commercials (who may finally cause the drop of that fucking “I’m lovin’ it” loop). So while playing up a new urban era, the Trak Starz are also reinventing past stars as not to step too far into the future and leave old-school fans behind. You could call them one hit producing wonders, but they’re not. You could call them cliché-riders, but they’re not (entirely). You could call them  Grammy -less, which they are, and it looks as if it will stay that way until they really find some standing room of their own. For now, the pair seems content with pumping out hits that, while lacking in diversity, are packing in likeability, a go-to game-plan that won’t fail until radio changes directions.   Career Highlights (followed by  Billboard charting )   Right Thurr - Chingy   (#2)  Some funky organ work and a little sound effect spice was all that the slur-crazy Chingy needed to turn “Right Thurr” into a #2  Billboard Hot 100  hit, at the same time almost guaranteeing himself future success in the rap world. Purposely trading “there” for “thurr,” so absurdly drawled that it came dangerously close to an all-out stereotype, Chingy’s overly performed chorus matched the overly partying backdrop for an irresistible trance jam, all the while never sounding like anything that should be let above South Carolina geographically. More over there than over here, more Southurrn than Southern, the  Trak Starz  hit crossover success with a single that was little more than Chingy’s borderline-perverted comments about some honeys from afar.   Holidae Inn - Chingy feat. Ludacris and Snoop Dogg   (#3)  Above all else, “Holidae Inn” proves that three is one hell of a crowd. You’ve got  Snoop Dogg , the limber-lipped pimp who was tried for murder,  Ludacris , whose first radio single promoted “ruff sex [to] make it hurt,” and  Chingy , a sly newcomer who we’re sure would be up for a drive-by or a gang-bang (not necessarily in that order). The single, backed by some octave-dropping funk buzzes and a steady club stomp, absolutely killed radio (Snoop?) and molested video countdowns (Luda?) all across America. Peaking at #3 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , the hip-hop trio milked the “shizzle” fad in Ludacris’s show-stealing guest rap and invited any and all ladies to their nearest inn for a check-in with hotel clerk Snoop Dogg. The  Trak Starz  perfectly played a rollicking party beat for anyone willing to dance along, dropping the best rhythm throughout Chingy’s debut,  Jackpot . Ultimately, this was the best song in 2003 to rape and murder to.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Potential Grammy Material)   One Call Away - Chingy feat. J. Weav   (#2)  With  Jackpot,  Chingy was able to pioneer his own  Nelly  renaissance, matching that rapper’s  Country Grammar  success single for single, almost to an exact science. Chingy’s lead single, “Right Thurr,” schooled clubbers in down-South rhetoric much like  Nelly’s  “Country Grammar,” and his “Holidae Inn” followed in suit like  Nelly’s  “E.I.,” both holla-back funk jams to milk a newfound ego in the rap game. Then Chingy released “One Call Away” in early 2004, the drawl-heavy sequel to  Nelly’s  “Ride Wit Me,” which first used an acoustic backbeat in 2001. Not to fall short of “Ride Wit Me”’s #3 charting, “One Call Away” hit the #2 spot (only behind Usher’s untouchable “Yeah!”) on the  Billboard  charts, proving to be Chingy’s best and most commercially successful single from his debut disc. Riding that aforementioned acoustic guitar with electrically programmed drum fills, the  Trak Starz  opened the door to emotions without leaving behind funkiness, perfectly crafting a lovesick hit behind Chingy’s tender delivery.   I Like That - Houston feat. Chingy, I-20 and Nate Dogg   (currently #15)  Ultimately, “I Like That” pushes simplicity. Sizing down  McDonalds'  old ad campaign, you now are drawn into America’s worst diet with “I like that,” not “I’m lovin’ it.” At the same time, this single edits  Chingy’s  “I like the way you do that right thurr” down to its three-word title, once again downsizing the importance of the article, whether the “that” in question is a cheeseburger or a woman’s ass. Frankly, it doesn’t matter what you’re biting into, because the  Trak Starz  backed this 4-man crew with synth horns and cyber chords, creating a pump-up anthem for summer 2004. Last seen in  50 Cent’s  “21 Questions,” the scruffy  Nate Dogg  trades in G-funk for party rap, a genre he hasn’t updated since  Ludacris  and  Nelly’s  “Area Codes.” Sure, you can call it somewhat of a sell-out for immediately going to a  McDonalds  commercial, but struggling rapper Houston needed a break to make it big. Like  Ludacris  did on “Holidae Inn,” Chingy steals the show, enlightening us on the more important aspects of his assets, like his size (“This 12 inches, it’ll cost ya”). Ooh, I like that.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Don't Tell Me -Avril Lavigne Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #22 Staying true to her nationality, Avril Lavigne sounds pissed on this single. Fellow Canadian  Alanis Morissette , 11 years Lavigne’s senior, raged into America with “U Oughta Know” back in the ‘90s, and Avril revamped that act with a punk-pop edge for thousands of  Generation-Y  teens. Actually, angry people have given the world some great music (check out  N.W.A.’s  “Fuck the Police” or  Nirvana’s  “You Know You’re Right”), but Lavigne’s “Don’t Tell Me” sounds like she rewrote  Liz Phair’s  “Why Can’t I?” on a steroid rush.   The Verdict:  3.8/10 - Brouhaha   (1.9/5)

       The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy ,  the Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical) . We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #6: R. Kelly    000    Write Up  Probably the most sensually recognizable artist of this pop era, R. Kelly has become a household name for both the good (sex-charged R&B hits) and the bad (sex-fueled scandals), both of which have surprisingly aided his career. He seems to be a two-trick pony, but those two tricks have yet to fail; whether pushing shockingly hot club smashes (most recently the brilliant “Ignition”) or soul-food inspirationals (most famously “I Believe I Can Fly”), Kelly’s crowd follows right behind him, a popular tactic that’s lead him to don a self moniker, the “Pied Piper” of R&B. A scandalous and guiltily pleasurable solo career in the early nineties helped Kelly become one of the hottest producers for younger artists, most notably the late  Aaliyah  (for whom he produced the debut album  Ain’t Nothing But a Number ). Most often falling back on Eastern-tinged beats heavy on flutes, acoustics, and suaveness (after all, he is the Pied Piper), Kelly’s productions are hard to miss, especially because he usually employs himself for the seductive choruses. Despite those aforementioned sex scandals, most of which have now been thrown out due to an unwarranted seizing of some illegal materials, Kelly has remained a universally popular hitmaker who seems unable to fail, regardless of who he’s working with. Cleverly constructing his singles as to front that he spends equal time in the club and the church (though full album listens tend to secure the former), Kelly has won  Grammy  awards and numerous other awards for his work as a vocalist and a producer. To nab this year’s  Producer(s)   Grammy , his solo release would have to be critically acclaimed ( Happy People/U Saved Me , slated for fall release), and he would need to put out some hot tracks with other artists. Still, the fact that Kelly is a contender for the award every year is commendable, even if there’s great reason not to commend.   History and Mentionable Tracks (followed by  Billboard charting )  R. Kelly has an extremely successful solo track record that combines with a knack for pushing new R&amp;B groups into fame. He’s one of the hardest working men in the biz (continually updating the charts with his own hits) and one of the most generous producers (giving some of his hottest beats to lesser artists).  1992:   Honey Love - R. Kelly   (#39)   She’s Got That Vibe - R. Kelly   (#59)   Slow Dance - R. Kelly   (#43)   1993:   Dedicated - R. Kelly   (#31)   Sex Me, Pts. 1-2 - R. Kelly   (#20)   1994:   Bump n’ Grind - R. Kelly   (#1)   Summer Bunnies - R. Kelly   (#55)   You’re Body’s Callin’ - R. Kelly   (#13)   At Your Best (You Are Love) - Aaliyah   (#6)   Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number - Aaliyah   (#75)   Back &amp; Forth - Aaliyah   (#5)   1995:   You Are Not Alone - Michael Jackson   (#1)   You Remind Me of Something - R. Kelly   (#4)   1996:   Down Low (Nobody Has to Know) - R. Kelly   (#4)   I Believe I Can Fly - R. Kelly   (#2)   I Can’t   Sleep Baby (If I) - R. Kelly   (#5)   1997:   Gotham City - R. Kelly   (#9)   1998:   Home Alone - R. Kelly   (#65)   I’m Your Angel - R. Kelly feat. Celine Dion   (#1)   1999.   808 - Blaque   (#8)   Did You Ever Think - R. Kelly   (#27)   If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time - R. Kelly   (#12)   When a Woman’s Fed Up - R. Kelly   (#22)   2001:   Feelin’ on Yo Booty - R. Kelly   (#36)   I Wish - R. Kelly   (#14)   2002:   We Thuggin’ - Fat Joe feat. R. Kelly   (#15)   The World’s Greatest - R. Kelly   (#34)   2003:   Girlfriend - B2K   (#30)   Hell Yeah - Ginuwine   (#17)   Snake - R. Kelly   (#16)   Thoia Thoing - R. Kelly   (#13)   Step in the Name of Love - R. Kelly   (#9)   Clubbin’ - Marques Houston   (#39)   Gigolo - Nick Cannon   (#24)   Gangsta Girl - Big Tymers   (#85)   Hotel - Cassidy    Career Blotches   One More Chance - Michael Jackson   (#83)  Released in 2003, “One More Chance” was a new track on Jackson’s  Number Ones  release, a tradition upheld by many older artists who put out label-pleasing compilations. Trying to repeat the #1 success of “You Are Not Alone” from 1995, Jackson called in R. Kelly, a man who would never turn down the chance to work with a legend (Kelly also did sporadic work with the  Isley Brothers ). Kelly only needed a track that would sell as well as his sex tape, but instead he produced a mid-tempo ballad that fell terribly short of his better work (“I Wish,” “I Believe I Can Fly”). The weak charting of “One More Chance” pushes one of two messages: Either R. Kelly mega-gospels are outdated (very hard to believe) or the last thing Michael Jackson needs to revive his career is second-rate sop begging for “one more chance at love.”   The Best of Both Worlds  (album)- Jay-Z and R. Kelly   (#2)  Firstly, when the world’s hottest club producer and the world’s hottest pop MC launch an album that can’t even debut at #1, you know something’s wrong. The problem was that after the instant success of the Kelly-Carter collaboration “Fiesta,” which peaked at #6 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , the duo thought that they were invincible, so they rush-released a shared album that was lucky to find mediocrity.  The Best of Both Worlds  is a reasonable title (after all, they are the first bites on their respective genre platters), but the album showcases more the rest of both worlds, “the rest” being lesser selections from either artist. Hell, they shared in common the fact that they named themselves (Jay’s  Hova  and Kelly’s  Pied Piper ), but neither lived up to any name on this disc.   Career Highlights   Ignition - R. Kelly   (#2)  My generation has never heard a better summer jam than 2003’s “Ignition,” which spat in the world’s face while Kelly was under heavy speculation for his at-home igniting. The spit was so strong that Kelly bragged to “stick the key in your ignition” and still had millions dancing along, those millions probably able to decipher the metaphorical automobile. With a feel-good blend of jovial piano chords, cheery strings, and those watery synth slips from  TLC’s  “Waterfalls,” Kelly crafted his best single ever, with sing-along lyrics that every 9 year-old girl could make her parents extremely uncomfortable with (after all, who doesn’t want to “take it to the room and freak somebody”).   Bump, Bump, Bump - B2K feat. P. Diddy   (#1)  A landmark single for Kelly, this was his first club production to land the #1 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 . Taking a simple (but trademark) acoustic beat, Kelly modeled the young group’s vocals around that very beat, perfectly contrasting a maturely sexual guitar with some immaturely horny brat packers. The chorus was a vocal blitz, stopping every few lines for the communal chant (“Bump, bump, bump!”) that sent the track to the top. It’s a wonder why B2K (of all people) got to introduce Kelly’s acoustic serenade style to the world, but it was one hell of an introduction, which you can thank for  Cassidy’s  “Hotel,”  Nick Cannon’s  “Gigolo,” and  Marques Houston’s  “Clubbin’.”   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   Baby I Love U! - Jennifer Lopez feat. R. Kelly   (#74)  A track deserving a much higher charting, “Baby I Love U!” has verses that update  Geggy Tah’s  “Whoever You Are” in a reggae/urban realm  (“All I wanna do is to thank you/Even though I don’t know who you are/You let me change lanes/While I was driving in my car”  becomes  “It's like downtown New York/In the middle of traffic jam/All I really want you to know/Is who I am” ). The track sounds like an attempt to rewrite “Ignition” with an ’04 Bonny and Clyde. How a catchy track from the hottest duo to hit this year’s charts flopped is hard to explain, but it’s nothing to be ashamed of as a producer.   So Sexy - Twista feat. R.Kelly   (currently #30)  Laying down a snakelike beat to match Twista’s rapid-fire delivery, R. Kelly drops another potential summer hit with “So Sexy.” As with “Overnight Celebrity,” much of what Twista says means nothing (seeing as censorship has made much of his banter indecipherable), so that puts a lot of pressure on the chorus, which is a brilliant call-and-response between some beautiful ladies and, well, R. Kelly. The determining factor with this single, though, is the surprising aftertaste. Like watching  Ron Jeremy  at work, there’s a lukewarm pondering left at the end of “So Sexy,” leaving the listener to stumble over a respectable question: Wait, hot chicks think Twista’s sexy? Moments later, extreme self-confidence ensues.   Happy People/U Saved Me - R. Kelly   (Happy People: #19)  Unfortunately, to headline his 2004 fall double-disc release, R. Kelly chose two tracks that will not fare well with the pop charts. The first single, “Happy People,” is a two-step sequel to “Step in the Name of Love,” which had a strong #9 charting. Sounding like the chicken-picnic soulmate to  Usher’s  “Yeah!,” the track loops sampled “yeahs” in its chorus around a beat-shifting Kelly. Actually a better written track than “Step…,” “Happy People” unfortunately will not achieve the same chart success because it is pure country club, ditching all urban paraphernalia for a good rollick and a round of golf. Similarly, “U Saved Me” is a poor-charting single because it is nowhere near past Kelly jams (though a little better than  Michael Jackson’s  “One More Chance”). In the verses, Kelly narrates heart-wrenching tales of despair and ghetto-hopelessness only to culminate in a Lord-praising chorus, which takes a rise/fall pattern and milks it into a full-gospel sing-along. Ultimately, Kelly has made two trips to promote his new CD, one to the  Five Seasons  and one to the church. Problematically, no one is following.

      According to  urlLink Billboard.com ,  Michael Jackson  has been accused of seducing a young boy and then imprisoning the boy and his family, continuing to force them to record a video denying recent molestation charges against Jackson. Lawyers in Santa Maria made the charges today, July 27th.   Last year's television documentary (which aired in February of 2003) has footage of Jackson referring to his tendency to sleep with children as "harmless" and "nonsexual." Today's accusations are rooted in that very footage, seeing as how the young boy in the above charge's contents can be seen in the documentary. &nbsp;  The actions that Jackson supposedly took ( imprisoning a boy and then forcing him to perform against his will ) are being likened to stories of prisoners of war, but it seems that they relate more closely to being a member of the  Jackson 5 .   The whole imprisonment episode, if actually true, also gives an entirely new definition to the term "jailbait."

      Recently, after eating a chicken curry sandwich, media wonderwoman  Oprah Winfrey  bought the California-based  Art&nbsp;Cafe and Bakery , a struggling sandwich shop owned by  Margaux Sky . During a meeting with  Harpo Productions  president  Tim Bennett , Winfrey made a request for a turkey burger and ended up with the aforementioned&nbsp;chicken sandwich courtesy of Sky (Bennett's&nbsp; sister-in-law). Bennett told Winfrey about Sky's plans to close down the  Art Cafe and Bakery  due to long work days and little profit, and Oprah immediately&nbsp;offered to buy the place, which she did.   Always the record setter, it seems appropriate to note how Winfrey is the first black, female talk-show personality to single-handedly keep a sandwich shop in business. Oh wait, there's always Star&nbsp;Jones...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Jesus Walks -Kanye West Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #11 The harder of the two religious summer singles (the other is  R. Kelly's  urban inspirational, "U Saved Me"), Kanye West's "Jesus Walks" gives hope to even the hippest. Strutting over his own pride of gruff disciples, Kanye reinvents as a prophet while his backdrop grows with an orchestra, soul choir, and that tattered cell phone wriggle. Sure, he bites  Adam Sandler  (that "shit for breakfast" line) and  Nas  (the first rapper to self-crucify with "Hate Me Now"), but when Kanye claims that "radio needs this single," he's not overestimating. This track is lyrically superior to  Jadakiss'  curiously immature "Why," musically superior to  D12's  anthem of darkness "How Come," and artistically superior to anything on the  Billboard  charts. No, we're not looking at a lyrical catchphrase ("Jesus walks!"), but if the son of God times the whole "second resurrection" thing correctly (before this Kanye song falls out of heavy radio airtime), he might just reappear with a head bob.   The Verdict:  9.2/10 - The Fork   (4.6/5)      2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry

       This week’s CD:    urlLink Confessions  by Usher (Week of 7/26 to 8/2)  Release date:  March 23rd, 2004  Rating:   6.8/10 (3.4/5)   Get Audible:  "Yeah!," "Caught Up," "Take Your Hand"                             "More Proving Than Confessing"     Just after the start of the year 2004, the pop world was undergoing a confused, pre- Grammy  period that defines every year at about that time. This year,  Outkast's  "Hey Ya" and "The Way You Move" were both on their last legs after dominating radio airplay for weeks,  Eamon's  neo-soul of "F*ck It" was reaching a stalemate after a long run, and a series of second singles from popular artists were barely keeping the  Billboard  charts together (including  Ludacris's  "Splash Waterfalls,"  Evanescence's  "My Immortal,"  Jessica Simpson's  "With You," and  Maroon 5's  "This Love"). Then, seemingly out of nowhere, an amazingly hot track hit radio stations across America, called "Yeah!," the hybrid between Ludacris's clever southern drawl, Usher's soul vocals, and  Lil Jon's  crunk-R&B production. Surprisingly, but not regretfully, the track did not sound like an Usher first single. Yes, the high-strung vocals were there, narrating a late-night club experience, but the song didn't have the feel-good flute soul of "U Remind Me" or even the sly acoustic boy-band vibe of "You Make Me Wanna." "Yeah!" packed a sick buzz-saw beat, which was perfected in its chorus by demented pan-flutes fluttering around the near vocal-less chorus, something almost unheard of in Usher's past, seeing as how the majority of his hits have had multidimensional, layered refrains. Nevertheless, it became a hit, soon spending five comfortable weeks uncontested atop the  Billboard Hot 100  before the release date of the accompanying album,  Confessions.   Much of this album covers ground that Usher has walked many times before, but it still proves his worth as today's top R&amp;B man for soul and lovesick hits. For instance, despite synth strings, looped techno beeps, and an almost  Sadé -esque acoustic jazz guitar patterning, "Burn" cannot escape its destiny as the fraternal twin of "U Got It Bad," a fact only proven by Usher's near-trademark out-of-sync ramble verses strung together by an ever-saddening chorus. The case is the same with the song "Confessions," which pitches him as a sexier  Brian McKnight , from its direct imitation of counting in the chorus (remember "Back to One"?) to its production.  The truth is, while Usher does sound fine when he is rehashing his own material, his true inner-funk and grit come out when he is mimicking other stars, something he unquestionably has a knack for.   Take the evidence of "Caught Up," one of the true gems on  Confessions.  Sounding like what  Michael Jackson  would have put out if he recorded  Off the Wall  in 2003 with  Timbaland  as the producer, it hits hard with bass-driven horns and a well-written chorus. The best part of the production, though, is the funky bass line that appears twice in the song and seems like it was taken straight from  Beck's  "Paper Tiger." Similar is the "Rock Your Body" knockoff "Take Your Hand," which borrows the climb-up harmonies from the  Timberlake  song in its chorus, the same harmonies that were used almost 25 years earlier in the sing-back melodies from Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" (the "all night" and "sunlight" parts). The song's beat fuses heavy radio static-crackle with funk-fuzz bass and big band horn hits. Taking a break from the Jacko pastiche, Usher outdoes  Ginuwine  at his own game in "Superstar," the upbeat revival of "Take Away," Ginuwine's duet with  Missy Elliott  from 2001. While easily reduced to being a label-pleasing motivational piece, the song actually entertains with its stuttered drum beat and its upwards guitar spirals. And while Usher does do a good modern soul croon, he continually returns to his "Thriller"-era vocalization, which again comes out in one of the better slow selections on the album, "Simple Things." The cool keyboards from  Janet Jackson's  "I Get Lonely" are lifted to propel the beat, and Usher actually maintains MJ's intimacy from "Human Nature" throughout his inspiring delivery.  Noticing the odd title of this new Usher release (face it, if Michael Jackson named a future album  Confessions,  the world would gawk in worry with open mouths), it becomes clear that he doesn't know exactly who is he.  Cam'ron  classified himself as a dangerous pyro with his 1998 album,  Confessions of Fire .  Chuck Barris , the  Gong Show  host, was immortalized as a potential killer when a biographical  George Clooney  flick focused on him with the title  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . Hell, even  Lindsay Lohan  identifies herself as a teenage drama queen with her 2004 chick flick. Usher, on the other hand, simply "confesses," showing that he isn't sure whether he wants to be the next Michael Jackson or whether he wants to settle down and parrot  Boyz II Men  for the rest of his career. If anything, this album confesses that he can do anything he wants to: he can imagine a world where  Jimi Hendrix  plays underneath  Cooleyhighharmony -era vocals, which defines the near-psychadelia of "Throwback"; he can revive the flutes from "U Remind Me" and mix them with the lost sunny-day techno swirls of  Bone Thugz 'N Harmony's  "Crossroads," which is essentially "Follow Me"; he can even add to the library of R&amp;B songs based around a rock guitar riff ( The Root's  "Seed 2.0,"  TLC's  "Unpretty," Michael Jackson's "Black or White") with his own "Bad Girl."  Actually, Usher has done more proving than confessing here. His great vocal range and high-pitched soul struts come out (especially on "Can U Handle It?") better than they ever have before, and he sounds extremely comfortable to be singing over the beats that  the Neptunes ,  Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , and Lil' Jon (among others) have provided him.  Confessions  is a disc with only a couple of immediately disposable tracks, namely the confused ballad "Truth Hurts" and the over-glam of "Do It To Me." And as soon as Usher finally decides who he wants to be, he will be able to stop confessing and to start mesmerizing, while a world of listeners stops critiquing and starts fully enjoying.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Why -Jadakiss feat. Anthony Hamilton Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #36 Throughout pop music history, interrogative jams have been sexual ( Lil' Kim's  "How Many Licks?"), bashful ( Liz Phair's  "Why Can't I?"), longing ( Third Eye Blind's  "How's It Gonna Be"), biting ( D12's  "How Come"), weeping ( LeAnn Rimes'  "How Do I Live") and romantic ( Brandy's  "Have You Ever"), but rarely do they pack political punches, save the recent "Where is the Love?" Actually, with "Why," Jadakiss seems to one-up the Black Eyed Peas, as he asks over 50 questions in a headlining single cut for radio. Some of them are legitimatly intelligent ("Why did Bush have to knock down the towers"), some blatantly used just to rhyme ("Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Crist"), and some just absurdly unnecessary ("Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar"). Rocking a stutter-step bell line that recalls every nursery rhyme beat from "Rock Superstar" to "Wanskta," Jadakiss avoids becoming nagging by keeping an impressive flow and stopping every now and then to let Anthony Hamilton play Yoda in a wise and soulful chorus. Whether or not Jada was trying to update that one world-conscious question ("What's goin' on?"), he managed to perk up everyone's ears with this track, the ultimate summer Q &amp; A with Qs that are easier to answer than, say, "can I get a what what?"   The Verdict:  7.6/10 - The Fork   (3.8/5)     2004 Wild Card Singles Club Entry

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Everytime -Britney Spears Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #15 As with any Britney Spears single, “Everytime” has some lurking, indescribable quality that makes it easy to be drawn into; the song sounds like it's constantly on fade effect, delicately losing breathe until an end both dead and newborn. Neither the production nor the vocals are on a platform, unlike a  Christina  ballad (check the sickly wails throughout “A Voice Within”) or previous Britney singles (check the stop-and-start, volume shifting “Sometimes”). Audibly defining loneliness, the piano, harp and bongo arrangement meshes with Britney’s whispered soliloquy (an instrument of its own) and is thinned with awakening strings and quivering echoes. Regardless of the mediocrity of  In the Zone  or any paparazzi blitz on the nouveau beau, Britney’s ’04 singles have become surprisingly addictive, mainly due to their mood-shifting abilities. Take “Toxic,” for example, which could persuade even the most conservative into prostitution, and now “Everytime,” which could depress the clown’s jester. That convincing power is simultaneously breathtaking and dangerous; hell, if you shuffle a Brit playlist and end up mouthing “Toxic” and “Everytime” back to back, you may end up keeping both  Viagra  and  Prozac  in business.  T he Verdict:  8.4/10 - The Fork   (4.2/5)     2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry

Producer #7: Scott Storch    00000000000     Write Up  Introduced to the world subtly as the keyboardist on the  Roots’  1993 release  Organix,  Scott Storch has since become a popular hitmaker, his productions trademarked by synth beats and dazzling ivory struts. That keyboard work on  Organix  lead to a permanent spot as the Roots’ pianist, which in turn pushed Storch as the hottest handyman in the world’s tightest hip-hop band. Years later, he started to see work beyond the Roots, collaborating with such veterans as  Dr. Dre , with whom he crafted some of his most memorable work (especially the #2 hit “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” for  Eve  and  Gwen Stefani , a brilliant genre-defying sass attack that did wonders for both ladies’ careers). Storch soon abandoned his rap-only tag by dicing out some pop hits as well, working with  Christina Aguilera  and, most notably,  Beyoncé . Although Storch did have some initial stumbles (repetitive tracks that went nowhere on the charts), he rebounded immediately and now rarely misses with his hits. Actually, by late 2003, Storch had moved away from his keyboard-heavy jams in favor of elaborate dance tracks, a strategy that paid off extremely well (as Storch saw his first #1 hit in  Beyoncé  and  Sean Paul’s  “Baby Boy”). Now an experienced producer, Storch seems only to get stronger and funkier with age, almost reversing the thought of retirement in lieu of loading the Billboard charts with hit after hit. In terms of winning the  Producer(s)   Grammy , Storch needs to pump out a few more radio tracks to be noteworthy, but that’s something that the keyboard virtuoso just may be capable of.   History and Mentionable Tracks Timeline (followed by Billboard charting)  Starting out in the early nineties, Storch’s productions seem to grow more abundant every year, a stat that points to his rising popularity and work ethic.  1999:   Still D.R.E. - Dr. Dre   (#93)   Family Portrait - Pink   (#20)   2001:   Let Me Blow Ya Mind - Eve feat. Gwen Stefani   (#2)   2002:   Tarantula - Mystikal   2003:   Thug Luv - Lil’ Kim   Clap Back - Ja Rule   (#44)   Me Myself & I - Beyoncé   (#4)   Fighter - Christina Aguilera   (#20)   Poppin’ Them Thangs - G-Unit    Career Blotches   Can’t Hold Us Down - Christina Aguilera feat. Lil’ Kim   (#12)  Supposedly the first hip-pop crossbreed to fight for women’s rights, Christina Aguilera’s “Can’t Hold Us Down” (which milked the “Lady Marmalade” collaboration by guest-spotting Lil’ Kim) was bloated with double-standard defying lyrics and a less-than-fitting rally cry: “Can’t hold us down!” Unfortunately, Christina Aguilera (past lyric: “I wanna get dirrty”) and Lil’ Kim (graphic lyric: “I make a Sprite can disappear in my mouth”) are much more  Thelma &amp; Louise  than  Elizabeth Stanton & Susan B. Anthony , meaning that they speak to female empowerment by sexuality, not to female righteousness by protest. On top of that, Scott Storch gave the duo a beat that sweats and grinds with post-coital bell lines and thrusting guitar spikes, sounding like the last thing you’d want to loop beneath a feminine chant. More rowdy than rebellious, more galvanizing than groundbreaking, this flawed anthem combined all the wrong things at all the wrong times and spoke to little more than sexiness.   X - Xzibit   (#76)  Looping piano jumbles, synth lines, and string stabs, Scott Storch gave Xzibit one hell of a lackluster first single to his 2000 third release,  Restless.  Working with  Dr. Dre , Storch did craft a rousing beat, but did little to spice it up, a mistake that combined with the terribly chanted chorus (you guessed it: “X!”) to give this track almost no chart success. A very underrated rapper, Xzibit works well with the track, but again does little to make it all memorable. Sure, this song could be labeled “good,” but club-worthy it is not. Equating that statement, it’s apt to point out how all members put in a good effort (Storch’s salsa-esque piano spirals, Xzibit’s laid-back flow), back none of them flavored it enough to make it danceable.   Career Highlights   You Got Me - The Roots   feat. Erykah Badu   (#39)  Probably Storch’s top achievement, the Roots’ “You Got Me” from their 1999 release  Things Fall Apart  is a brilliant hip-hop ballad that combines a back-to-basics Erykah Badu crooning with heartfelt lyrics over a lush acoustic line that could have pushed even more free love at Woodstock. Simultaneously seductive and heart-wrenching, the track was so good that it won the Roots a  Grammy , an award as appropriate for the band as it was for Storch. Ultimately, this song was the breakthrough that the Roots had been waiting for, a summit that they hadn’t achieve previously and, unfortunately, haven’t achieved since.   Baby Boy - Beyoncé feat. Sean Paul   (#1)  Ah, the power that Beyoncé’s “Baby Boy” had. It was the one track Eastern enough to funk up the desert while Western enough to top the  Billboard  charts. It was the one track cool enough to blast windows-down while hot enough to make  Jay-Z  jealous (he infamously denied Sean Paul the right to perform it with Beyoncé at an awards show). It was the one track simple enough to guarantee Beyoncé as a household name while complex enough to be called a production peak for Scott Storch, who laid down the track without samples (unlike Beyoncé’s other chart-topping hit, “Crazy in Love”). A sick schooling session in Eastern-tinged R&amp;B, Storch finally mastered a sound that numerous producers had attempted before him. Techno bleeps and psychotic strings swirled with a killer bass line, all topped off by a steaming Beyoncé and a ruckus-causing (though hard to understand) Sean Paul. Easily the best-produced pop song of Storch’s career, “Baby Boy” is a feat that will be hard to top.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   Don’t Say Nuthin’ - The Roots  Previously described by myself as a “verbal driveby through Chinatown,” it seems that I have a love-hate relationship with “Don’t Say Nuthin’,” the lead single from the Roots’ 2004 summer release,  The Tipping Point.  Yes, the Roots are loved by much of the world, consistently fighting as that underground hip-hop squad who plays their own instruments and still rocks out. But, with this track, they don’t play their own instruments, most noticeably  ?uestlove , who’s usually pace-driving percussion is morphed into a clubbier drum machine. Similarly, gone is the funky wordplay of lyrical genius  Black Thought , present is some high-speed dissing and all-too-common self-praising. And while the beat naturally bobs heads, it cops  Lil’ Bow Wow’s  “Let’s Get Down” and is very short of “Baby Boy,” Storch’s bar-setting Eastern jam from 2003. The track, at times, can sound good, but its not the Roots’ best, and its not Storch’s best. “Don’t Say Nuthin’” sounds overproduced, a problem that the Roots have never had, and a problem that we hope they’ll never have from here on out.   Lean Back - Terror Squad   (currently #4)  The fastest rising single of summer 2004, Terror Squad’s “Lean Back” is meant for late-night drives through shady neighborhoods so that one can, well, dance (or, if you’re a friend of  Fat Joe’s , just lean back). Mixing cinderblock percussion with an equally funky and chilling string line, Scott Storch gave the Terror Squad a defining moment with this track. Surprisingly, Fat Joe and  Remy  hold their own, each one of them spitting unnerving lines over the already unnerving beat, making the entire episode a scary listen. With “Lean Back,” the Terror Squad may actually nab a  Grammy , which could be attributed either to Storch’s beat and the Squad’s rhymes or to no one wanting to fuck with Fat Joe. I’ll side with the former for now.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Leave (Get Out) -JoJo Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #12 As much as JoJo wanted to be the next ripest thing, she’s spending the entire summer singing the unfortunate sequel to  TLC’s  unbeatable “No Scrubs,” except this time it’s been approved for general audiences. Opening with an acoustic sap line that probably started as a cellular ring tone, the 13 year-old turns TLC’s complaints (“a scrub is a guy that just sits on his broke-ass”) into anger that her man “left [his side girl’s] number on [his] phone.” But what JoJo’s producers didn’t realize was that “No Scrubs” was made essential by  Chilli’s  piss-off attitude, as she dumped every existing loser (“I don’t want no scrubs”), not just one jackass who forgot to clean his cell’s call log.  Bottom line:  While JoJo is busy trying hard not to cry (“No tears will fall from these eyes”), Chilli is making her dirtbag thug bawl.   The Verdict:  3.2/10 - Brouhaha   (1.6/5)

        The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy , the  Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical) . We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #8: Trackboyz   (Mike Williams and Joe Kent)    00000 00       Write Up  Very recently signed to  L.A. Reid’s   Def Jam Records , Trackboyz are new to the rap game but already have created a unique sound on a few popular singles. They stray away from sampling and aim for lyric-heavy, spoken-chorus club jams, self-advertising as bringing the St. Louis hip-hop sound to other parts of the world. Not billed as whole-album producers, the Trackboyz look to create overly commercial tracks that either hit big or flop on radio. Really, though, they make good on their promise, always managing to maintain that down-south rumble feel on their productions, just an artistic shade below Lil’ Jon’s all-out crunk jams. Now, as one of Reid’s favorite teams for new artists, we should be hearing many more Trackboyz efforts, which have to this point been extremely infrequent. If the duo were to craft some more hit singles before the year’s close, they could be in contention for the  Producer(s)   Grammy  just because their work so far has been so memorable. But, as newcomers in the biz, they’ll probably need a few more years to prove themselves before they find their names atop of the go-to producers list, a position that every fledgling production team ( the Neptunes  included) once found themselves in. If they continue successfully in their single-genre creationism (that party-hard Southern chant rap), they could find themselves as A-list in-field specialists, a title no group would dislike.   Career Blotches (followed by  Billboard charting )   Air Force Ones - Nelly   (#3)  Basically jump some techno bleeps, DJ scribble, and misty vocal samples, the laid-back production in Nelly’s “Air Force Ones” was more a backdrop behind the Southern rap celeb than a worthy beat that could work under any no-name prospect. It’s not exactly producer error to get lazy behind a significant star ( the Neptunes  have done it with  Jay-Z ), but at the same time it’s no inventive pinnacle to boast about. Released in 2002, the track laid out the blueprint for what would become the Trackboyz’ trademark sound; Nelly over-slurs the overly Southern chorus, some lesser emcees (like  Murphy Lee ) play supporting roles to enhance the community effect, and the backbeat rarely shifts. Yes, the production is better than the horridly childish job on “Dilemma” (that  Kelly Rowland  mishmash), but it’s still nothing that the Trackboyz will be reminiscing about when they really get going.   Career Highlights   Po’ Folks - Nappy Roots feat. Ying Yang Twins   (#21)  Back in 2002, it seemed the perfect match: Pair Southern hip-hop’s newest, rowdiest, and largest collective with a new producing duo that tends to favor St. Louis creationist values (ultimately rowdiness and chant). On top of that, salt and pepper the combo with the deepest-throated twosome since Jordan & Pip. What seemed perfect was perfect, as the Nappy Roots and Ying Yang Twins took a single from Trackboyz, the drawl-heavy “Po’ Folks.” Mixing piano chords will hard-hitting string stabs (almost like Savage Garden’s “Carry on Dancing”), the Trackboyz dropped their most rollicking effort to date, setting the stage for some raspy and ghetto-hick verses, provided by the 21st century  Goodie Mob  that is the Nappy Roots. The trademark track from  Watermelon, Chicken &amp; Gritz , “Po’ Folks” is the sequel to  Petey Pablo’s  “North Carolina,” easily Trackboyz’ best work.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   40 Oz. - D12  (not released) We all knew that the boys of D12 could rap. But who would have thought that they could brawl? Calling in Trackboyz to do a track on their 2004 release  D12 World , they were transformed into a cluster of country bumpkins for “40 Oz.,” a dirty jam about violence and alcoholism. Over a crawling analog beat spiced with bells, plucked strings, and a kicking drum beat, D12 passes the mic and the booze, only stopping every few lines for a bar-chant chorus (“Pour your 40 out/Guzzle it!”). Sounding like nothing that  Eminem  or  Dr. Dre  are even capable of, “40 Oz.” is a rare glimpse of what D12 would have been had they been born some 4 states lower.   Tipsy - J-Kwon   (#2)  “Tipsy” should have been a #1 hit, but it had the unfortunate fate of being released right as  Usher’s  “Yeah!” dominated the charts, giving it the legs only to make a summit at #2. This track is so high-quality because almost none of the credit can go to J-Kwon, who does little beyond the wonderfully-garbled chorus. The only way, it seems, to dis the track would be to cite its minor copying of the “Grindin’” beat ( Clipse ), but hip-hop beats are recycled as much as paper (actual paper, not the rap slang for cash). That electro-funk shimmy beneath J-Kwon’s muffled enunciation is what really makes the track, instantly reminding us of  Kelis’  “Milkshake.” The production isn’t particularly elaborate, being little more than the digital bass line and the crashing percussion, but it finds catchiness in minimalism, an art that sounds easy but must be hard. Right at the start of the year, Trackboyz gave us “Tipsy” and the aforementioned “40 Oz.” At least we know where their priorities are.

       The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy ,  the   Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical).  We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #9: Rick Rubin      Write Up  Aside from a brief golden year in 1999 (fueled by Limp Bizkit’s “Nookie” and Kid Rock’s “Bawitdaba”), rap/rock hasn’t seen a worthy update since Rick Rubin, who single-handedly took the crossbred genre to its greatest heights in his short-lived heyday. Ever since that three year stint (’86-’88), he has been hailed as a legend, making big news whenever he teams with any act. Being one of those producers who can craft tracks playable for urban and suburban audiences, he has radio stations all over America leaving empty spots their playlists for his work. All evidence considered, there’s good reason for that; Rubin has dropped staples for alternative stations ( Red Hot Chili Peppers'  “Give It Away”) and urban stations (Sir  Mix-A-Lot’s  “Baby Got Back”) alike. Maintaining the  American  label, Rubin maintained his status as an album-producer, not a one-track donator, as he constructed discs with A-list veterans like  Mick Jagger  and  Johnny Cash  (the latter co-winning a  Grammy  with Rubin for the ’97 release  Unchained).  As for now, Rubin is laying low but has made a brief return as a singles-only producer, a method that likely puts him out of the running for the  Producer(s) of the Year   Grammy . Still, a man more for the music than the praise, Rubin seems content with the occasional eardrum-buzzing bash as opposed to the quietly graceful opus, both of which he’s proved capable of.   History & Mentionable Tracks Timeline (Followed by  Billboard charting )   1986:   Walk This Way - Run-D.M.C.   (#4)   My Adidas - Run-D.M.C.   It’s Tricky - Run-D.M.C.   (#57)   You Be Illin’ - Run-D.M.C.   (#29)   Rock the Bells - LL Cool J   1987:   Girls - Beastie Boys   Fight for Your Right - Beastie Boys   (#7)   Brass Monkey - Beastie Boys   (#48)   1988:   Goin’ Back to Cali - LL Cool J   (#31)   1990:   Shake Your Money Maker  (album)- Black Crowes   (#4)   1992:   Mack Daddy  (album)- Sir Mix-A-Lot   (#9)   1996:   Unchained  (album)- Johnny Cash   (#170)   1998:   Globe Sessions  (album)- Sheryl Crow   (#5)   1999:   Californication  (album)- Red Hot Chili Peppers   (#3)   2000:   Renegades  (album)- Rage Against the Machine   (#14)   2002:   By the Way  (album)-  Red Hot Chili Peppers   (#2)    Career Blotches   Results May Vary  (album)- Limp Bizkit   (#3)  After Limp Bizkit went from the top of the world (read:  Significant Other ) to the depths of the charts (read:  Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water ), they lost innovative guitarist  Wes Borland  and went on to record  Results May Vary , produced by rap/rock’s most consistent hitmaker,  Rick Rubin . Unfortunately, Rubin did little to tweak Bizkit’s sound, an unmarketable flaw maybe more blamable on  Fred Durst’s  ego than Rubin’s ear. “Eat You Alive,” the lead single, went absolutely nowhere, and neither did the “Behind Blue Eyes” cover, which was released with a steamy Durst-on- Halle Berry  video as the second single. This project is probably Rubin’s biggest mistake, taking a producing job with one of the most overly selective groups in the biz (after all, they held a nationwide search to replace Borland as lead guitarist and found no one). With such an impressive list of past work, including the  Beastie Boys ,  Run-D.M.C. , and the legendary  Johnny Cash , you’d think that Limp Bizkit wouldn’t fit into Rubin’s schedule, and you’re thought would be right.   Career Highlights   Paul Revere - Beastie Boys   Rick Rubin’s  makeshift boogie in “Paul Revere” became one of the most sampled backbeats in hip hop history by no mistake; the hypnotic cymbal slides are as empty as they are intriguing, leaving the listener with equal amounts of loneliness and funkiness, a deadly combination in any rap song. Probably the landmark track off the Beastie’s debut  Licensed to Ill  (all produced by Rubin), “Paul Revere” is a renowned piece that thankfully is kept alive by those numerous samplings.   Blood Sugar Sex Magik  (album)- Red Hot Chili Peppers   (#3)  One of the many milestone albums that  Rubin  has produced in his career (among which are the  Beastie’s   Licensed to Ill  and  Johnny Cash’s   Unchained ), the Red Hot Chili Peppers’  Blood Sugar Sex Magik  is a epic disc filled with focused funk, dribble-drabble lyricism, and the unforgettable “Under the Bridge.” Rubin really showed his craftwork on this album because of his undeniable ability to take a relatively unsuccessful group (in the pop realm) and turn them into superstars without compromising their original sound (which, for the Peppers, was that gritty garage funk). This disc will go down in history with RHCP, a near-guarantee that Rubin has been able to uphold.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   99 Problems - Jay-Z   (#30)  Rarely known to stop by and drop a hot single,  Rick Rubin  lived and breathed artiness throughout the 90s, defying his typical rap/rock genre to do pop ( Sheryl Crow’s   Globe Sessions ), blues/rock ( Black Crowes’   Shake Your Money Maker ), and even country ( Johnny Cash’s   Unchained ). But, just as we were all bidding farewell to the late-eighties b-boy that was Rick Rubin, he reemerged with arguably his hardest bite ever, Jay-Z’s “99 Problems.” Mixing the music of  Billy Squier  with the lyrics of  Ice-T , Jay and Rick try to outdo each other in their respective realms; Rick blasts an up-step guitar crunch and some heavy cowbell, Jay rhymes one of his cleverest conversations amidst some wordplay and boast. Combined, the two both achieve a career highlight, all tied together by that recycled, radio-edited, Hova-mouthed catch-line: “Got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t one” (unfortunately, looking at Rubin in the video [see above], that’s the one problem that he might have).

The Salt Lake City Mormon will return home to his 1-year old son and wife&nbsp;until Jeopardy! tapings start up again. Ten percent of his so-far $1,321,660 will go to the Mormon church as a tithe.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;dropping the 5-win limit rule, the quiz show's ratings have gone up 50%(much of that thanks to Jennings), and&nbsp;host  Alex Trebek's  sex life has gone up 100%. In unrelated news, Jennings recently complained to a doctor of "jaw aches."   In other news,  UPN  is airing  Amish in the City,  a reality show that will take six young Amish adults and&nbsp;let them live life in L.A., with every second of the experiment taped. The Amish, like&nbsp;Native Americans, are a group that are never exposed to the fast American world, the only difference between them being&nbsp;that we killed the Native Americans to build cities, while we built cities to kill the Amish. &nbsp;

      Upon&nbsp;invitation to the 2004  MTV   Music Awards ,  Michael Jackson  asked  Cold Mountain  star  Nicole Kidman  to accompany him, which she turned down. Kidman cited the fact that she had "never met him" as reason for the denial, calling the entire situation "a little strange." In all politeness, though, she did say this in a radio interview:  "I did decline but, hey, the way my love life is I took it as a great compliment."  Which begs the subtle question...how fucked up is your love life if you consider a date offer from a twice-suspected child molester a compliment? Jesus Christ, Nicole, I've got a hotel key and a once-soiled blindfold if you want another compliment.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Scandalous -Mis-Teeq Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #35 Never before has a summer single been so delightfully contradictory as Mis-Teeq’s “Scandalous,” both the headlining single to their self-titled US debut and the prominent trailer track for  Halle Berry’s   Catwoman.  Boasting an extremely sexy sound full of lush strings, digital bass wrinkles, and a distinguishing fire siren (the up-tempo update on Kelis’ “Milkshake” bell dings), the trio croons some harmonious lines that are surprisingly unsexy (thus the contradiction). A memorable lyric informs that “a one night stand just ain’t enough,” which means that the girls of Mis-Teeq either prefer meaningful relationships or just want multiple nights of sex with the same partner, although asking for “a little conversation” seems to assure the former. Actually, trumping the Spice Girls comparison (based solely on the loose British connection), the last group to ask for conversation was Salt-N-Pepa, who did so infamously back in 1991, except instead of using chatter to avoid a fast hook-up, they, well, asked to “talk about sex.” That kind of fucks up my comparison.   The Verdict:  9.6/10 - The Fork   (4.8/5)     2004 Best Singles Club Entry

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Tipsy -J-Kwon Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2 Had  Nelly ,  Chingy , and  Ludacris  not popularized the overdone Southern drawl, this single would not have been a hit. But, as we all know, they did. So, producers  Trackboyz  were able to put a minimalist club-stomp beat and some digital bass-funk underneath one of the world’s lesser emcees, the straight outta high-school J-Kwon. Sounding more like a shyer Fabolous than a promising Southern rapper, Kwon uses a straight and simple delivery to lisp his way through a late-night club experience. Actually, in one of the odder occurrences of the year, Kwon’s seemingly useless spit over a simplistically catchy beat evokes the original pioneers of that art: the Beastie Boys.   Best Moment:  The chorus, after being muddled by J-Kwon’s accent, is translated roughly to this: “Air-buddy in thu cluu get’n tips.” (Note: The unedited version of the song ruins the chorus by awkwardly replacing “the club” with “this bitch.”)    The Verdict:  6.2/10 - The Fork   (3.1/5)

       Us Weekly  is standing by its  urlLink story  that  Michael Jackson  is about to become a father of quadruplets to come from a surrogate mother, the method that Jackson admitted to using for the conception of his latest, Prince Michael II (Blanket).&nbsp;Despite the magazine's claim to have talked to inside sources about a recent trip Michael made to visit the surrogate, Jackson and publicist  Raymone Bain  are completey against the entire story (Bain: "This is not true").   Still, the physical evidence could prove Jackson wrong: Apparently, ultrasounds have recorded practice sessions and conversations between the quadruplets, who plan to choreographically moonwalk out of the uterus on&nbsp; delivery day.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Move Ya Body -Nina Sky (feat. Jabba) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #6 Upon meeting the Puerto Rican twins that make up Nina Sky, hip-hop producer  Cipha Sounds  pushed them straight into recording a club jam over that incessant  Coolie Skank riddim  (the same beat featured in  Pitbull’s  “Culo” and  Elephant Man’s  “Jook Gal”). They came up with “Move Ya Body,” a paper-thin dancehall hodgepodge shifting between Jamaican ruckus (from party host Jabba), some vacant verses, and a simultaneously catchy and eerie chorus. That eeriness, perhaps, arises from the fact that Natalie and Nicole sound like  I, Robot  extras; they hit their pitches perfectly and create monotone harmonies throughout their dronish cue. Unfortunately, keeping that tone in mind, it's hard for one to take boogie commands from a duo that sounds like the only dance they can do is the robot.   The Verdict:  4.6/10 - Brouhaha   (2.3/5)

Leaning more towards adoption than natural childbirth ("We'd love to have our own children, but we have a heart for kids, and we'd love to adopt"), Simpson pushed the&nbsp;idea that  Newlyweds  might&nbsp;end soon so that she and Nick could either create or import kids.   But, alas, there's a twist.&nbsp;Recently,  urlLink Simpson wore an Argentinean shawl on&nbsp;MTV .&nbsp;Little news to some, many others took a liking to the accessory, almost tripling the production rate of the&nbsp;shawl's previously struggling factory, which is based in Argentina. So, in a bizarrely hypocritical turn of events, it seems that Jessica went from wanting to adopt a third world child to forcing hundreds&nbsp;of&nbsp;Argentinean boys and girls into child labor three times greater than before her "accessorizing."   It's all&nbsp;alright, though, because&nbsp;the stats are with the kids. Apparently, children who are forced into underaged labor&nbsp;have higher self-esteem than the normal paid worker, mainly&nbsp;because they&nbsp;have a very small chance of getting fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       The Produce Section  is a special look at today’s hottest producers, all fighting silently on the  Billboard  charts to land that ever-important and grossly underestimated  Grammy ,  the Producer(s) of the Year (Non-Classical) . We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.     Producer #10 :      The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo)     000000000     Write Up  On a list concerning producers, its nearly impossible to leave off the two masterminds who single-handedly ran the  Billboard  charts in 2003. They did it so well, in fact, that they were a lock-in for that Producer(s) Grammy, which they won in February over a slue of veteran hitmakers. But after that huge victory, the two disappeared. Sure,  N.E.R.D.  put out its sophomore effort (Pharrell and Chad’s faux-rock sideshow), but after that there hasn’t been one mentionable Neptunes production to hit radio (despite their worthy two-song stint on  Cee-Lo’s  early 2004 release,  Cee-Lo Green…is the Soul Machine ). One might blame this on pure exhaustion from ’03, but for such a young duo, the disappearance is nothing if not disappointing. The two would need some huge radio success or another parented album (like  Justin Timberlake’s   Justified ) to even be in contention for  Producers of the Year , but their lackluster pace seems to put them out of the race (even with a second  Clipse  release slated for later this year).   History & Mentionable Tracks Timeline (Followed by  Billboard charting )  Probably the most sought out producers in the game, the Neptunes have made inventive track after track throughout their careers, with the occasional and understandable miss.  1999:   Got My Money - Ol’ Dirty Bastard feat. Kelis   (#26)   2000:   Shake Ya Ass - Mystikal   (#13)   2001:   I Just Wanna Love U (Give it 2 Me) - Jay-Z   (#11)   I’m a Slave 4 U - Britney Spears   (#27)   Girlfriend  -‘N Sync   (#5)   Diddy - P. Diddy   (#66)   Bouncin’ Back (Bumpin’ Me Against the Wall) - Mystikal   (#37)   2002:   Hot in Herre - Nelly   (#1)   2003:   Like I Love You - Justin Timberlake   (#11)   Señorita - Justin Timberlake   (#27)   Rock Your Body - Justin Timberlake   (#5)   Luv U Better - LL Cool J   (#4)   Beautiful - Snoop Dogg   (#6)   Excuse Me Miss - Jay-Z   (#8)   Frontin’ - Pharrell feat. Jay-Z   (#5)    Career Botches   Change Clothes - Jay-Z   (#10)  Returning the favor for Jay-Z’s guest spot on Pharrell’s 2003 summer jam, “Frontin’”, the Neptunes produced the headlining single for Jay’s victory lap final album,  The Black Album . But even after giving Jay perhaps his funkiest single ever (2001’s “I Just Wanna Love U”), Chad and Pharrell fell very short of the bar on “Change Clothes,” writing a near-anthem for semi-nude teaser clubs. The only thing the track had going was danceable spoon percussion, but that seemed forgettable when mixed in with the rest of the syrupy production, which included an outdated synth line and some lacking piano. Trying to craft the ultimate one-night stand song (“Change clothes, and go”), the Neptunes ended up writing a sex-crazed track on the verge of perversion.  Grindin’ - Clipse   (#30)  Clipse was and still is the Neptune’s son/daughter project, taking almost full production from Chad and Pharrell on their albums and hoping for the best. “Grindin’” was the first single that the group put out, a minimalist, rap-focused jam begging to be an urban-only phenomenon. With the bleacher-shaking percussion used again in J-Kwon’s “Tipsy,” the Neptunes let Clipse do the talking, only supplying a whispered chorus (courtesy of Pharrell) amidst some heavy street lyricism. The track flopped on the charts, though, mainly because it tried too hard as verbal anthem while trying too little as an audible anthem. The Neptunes took a back-to-basics approach, and, predictably, came out overly basic.   Career Highlights   U Don’t Have to Call - Usher   (#3)  The Neptunes hit the crossover jackpot in 2001 when Usher won a Grammy with “U Don’t Have to Call,” a brilliant update on Michael Jackson’s  Thriller -era club hits. Using some tubular techno falls in between glossy keyboard chords, the Neptunes finally gave us a taste of their ultramodern jamming, no artist to better karaoke to it than Usher. This track may have seemed like it was back-to-basics, pulling a Jackson-esque front, but it was undeniably back to the future.  Milkshake - Kelis   (#3)  Ditching any sort of boundaries, the Neptunes digitized the pop charts in late 2003 with “Milkshake,” a track that essentially became the ultimate innuendo (“My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard”). Hot electro-funk played underneath a hotter Kelis, managing to take extreme static and make it sizzle, all the while flirting with subtly orgasmic “you’re order is ready” bell dings. What made “Milkshake” one of the defining tracks of 2003 and one of the sexiest tracks post-2000, though, was that everyone who heard it wanted their order to be ready.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   She Wants to Move - N.E.R.D.  The headlining single to N.E.R.D.’s second release,  Fly or Die , “She Wants to Move” is a track rooted in bipolarity, for while its hard not to bob to it, the song is much too simple for a Neptunes production. Able only to cook up a recycled, half-step pump up rhythm, Chad and Pharrell reason through steamy Spanish guitar, salsa-worthy pianism, and a wailing (but extremely simple) guitar riff. Next to their other hits (I’m thinking of Britney’s “I’m a Slave 4 U”), this track is a laughable attempt at sexiness, almost asking to be slowed down into sensual balladry. This track is the evidence that the Neptunes are fire in the pop and rap spectrums, but merely warmth when trying to rock out.   Flap Your Wings - Nelly   While 2002's "Hot in Herre" was a number one hit and will be a club staple for years to come, this attempt at a rewrite is nothing more than party rap as dated as, well, Nelly's catch phrase ("Drop down and get your eagle on"). On top of that, the music behind Nelly's never-failing ego is extremely weak for a  Neptunes  production, merely some jingle-jangle percussion and continuously climbing organ notes. A complete misstep on radio stations all over America, the world's favorite pop rapper and the world's favorite pop producers were unable to churn out another danceable hit. Instead, they released a persistent, perverted, and lazy sequel to "Hot in Herre" that may actually inspire birds not to migrate.

      California governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  recently called California Democrats "girlie men," a comment rooted in years of an  SNL  skit&nbsp;dropping the same term from a parodied Arnold.&nbsp;Many gay awareness groups objected to the comment, calling it offensive, but Schwarzenegger refuses to apologize for it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   So, if you're a woman in Arnold-headed California, you're either getting no play (blame gay Democrats) or getting manhandled (blame girl-groping Republicans).

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Slow Motion -Juvenile (feat. Soulja Slim) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2 Who would have guessed that 2004’s slickest and most sexually relaxed beat would fall behind Juvenile? Once the rapid fire, Down South go-to man if you were looking to back that azz up, Juve has lost some energy with age and now wants that success all over again, this time in slow motion. It’s not him that makes this track, though, it’s the suave guitar line underneath some echo-effected piano trills, orgasmic horn stabs, and techno bleeps. In complete disagreement with a priceless  50 Cent  lyric, this track’s sensual serenade seems to suggest that Juvenile is no longer into having sex, he’s all about making love.   The Verdict:  7.0/10 - The Fork   (3.5/5)     2004 Wild Card Singles Club Entry

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Roses -OutKast Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #9 In the worst move of the year, Arista opted to put out “Roses” as a joint second single from  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below , as opposed to continuing the release of one single from each album to form a second single collective. Even if there was some underlying need to put both Big Boi and André in the same video, “Ghettomusick” seems the much more logical choice, even if it downplays André’s importance. Reaping commercial success only because of its novelty lyrics, which include the chorus, Big Boi’s “I want to see your support bra, not support you,” and André’s nearly-infamous ramble about Caroline’s fall into a ditch, “Roses” also needed its over-the-top video to hit big (which excellently parodies the supposed riff between Boi and Dré). But truth be told, the commonplace percussion, vamped techno lines, digital fuzz-bass, and funk organs are not enough to propel a second single from the most inventive hip-hop group ever.  Worst Moment:  While Big Boi is able to contribute a fitting rap to the song, Dré’s bizarre lyrical choices completely fall out of sanity with a line that puts him in the same league as Kool Keith: “Real guys go for real down to Mars girls.” Maybe Lance Bass would concur.   The Verdict:  5.8/10 - Brouhaha   (2.9/5)

Everything is less than&nbsp;two dollars and its pretty much the same shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    But still, they can't seriously offer the idea of "leaving Taco Bell full" to everyone. As long as they continue to employ little Hispanic boys,  Michael Jackson  will always leave empty.

         The Deal:    Bill Clinton’s  autobiography,  My Life,  still holds the #1 spot atop the  New York Times Bestseller List  (Hardcover Nonfiction). The book, whose format perfectly matches how Clinton spent most of his time in the White House (hard &amp; covered), was released about a month ago.     Question:   Why does everyone pay so much attention to the outdated Clinton sex scandal and then not care about the current  George W.  White House being full of Bush?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Deal:   Gary Sheffield, New York Yankees right fielder, publicly commented on how the steroids scandal avoids certain players like Roger Clemens, who Sheffield thinks may be out of the scandal’s light just “because he can pitch.” Most baseball-related press attributes Clemens’ longevity in the game to a superior fitness program, but Sheffield doesn’t buy it. "I understand the reason why [Bonds and I are] under suspicion, because of the BALCO issue, but nobody speculates on [other players], on their workout," he explained.    Question:   Why don’t white athletes ever get the cool drug scandals?  urlLink NBA.com  tells us that former  Utah Jazz  star  John Stockton  went from 8.2 to 13.8 assists per game in just one season (from the ’86-’87 season to ’87-’88). You don’t just jump 5 whole assists without some kind of illegal medical enhancement.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------     The Deal:    Colin Farrel , the star of  Phone Booth , recently joked about his penis size in an  Entertainment Weekly  interview. A scene from the upcoming Farrel flick  A Home at the End of the World  featuring his genitalia was cut because a test crowd lost sight of the plot due to Colin’s size. Farrel then commented on how its “nothing to write home about.” He furthered this by describing it as “dark” and “three inches, uh, seconds long.”     Question:   Why does Farrel think he has such a big deal when we all know the man with the longest schlong (below)?

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Dip It Low -Christina Milian Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #11 Using the clubbier cousin to the stutter-step beat from Mario Winans “I Don’t Wanna Know,” Christina Milian’s “Dip It Low” is a how-to guide for females to get “your man [to] say ‘oh’.” Suggesting the ever-sluttier alternative to conversation, Christina urges her listeners to “meet him at the door with nothing on,” a brilliant lyric that speaks both to overt sexiness and global over-consumption of clothing. But when you’re riding some naughty Eastern strings and a continuously coital bass line, it’s hard not to be hot, and Christina perfectly plays the tour guide through some sweaty sexscapades. Thanks to “Dip It Low,” this summer will have considerably less instances of gettin’ dirrty, puttin’ the key in your ignition, and backin’ that ass up.    The Verdict:  6.6/10 - The Fork   (3.3/5)

       This week’s CD:   urlLink Autobiography  by Ashlee Simpson   ( Week of  7/19  to  7/26)    Release date:  July 20th, 2004  Rating:   6.4/10 (3.2/5)    Get Audible:  "Shadow," "La La," "Unreachable"     "Fighting For Ashlee"   To speak fairly, almost every factor imaginable is working against Ashlee Simpson’s career. Her older sister is America’s sweetheart; comfortably dumb enough to push commercial success, which in turn makes millions comfortable enough to accuse Ashlee of riding her wave. Considering Ashlee’s picture-perfect timing (dropping her album midway through  Newlywed’s  season 2), those millions have an argument, but “Autobiography”s moral seems to be that breaking through Jessica’s PG-rated seal is nothing less than a challenge. Sisterhood has been at fault lately, evidence being the Olsen anorexia scare and the forced inclusion of Haylie Duff on Hillary’s weak “Our Lips are Sealed” cover, which is just more pressure to mount against any potential Ashlee Simpson solo triumph.  Finally, and maybe most importantly, is that aforementioned seal being PG. John Shanks (the “Autobiography” producer) has previously coached Michelle Branch (check out that Maxim spread), Alanis Morissette (sample “You Oughta Know” lyric: “Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?”), and Sheryl Crow (check out that Stuff spread), none of whom exactly blend right in with Ashlee’s expected virgin Mary image.  Still, even with all that considered, Ashlee finds clever ways around the patented image that is her sister, which are annoying in the real world (black hair?) but surprisingly delightful in the musical realm, making “Autobiography” a worthy and interesting listen, albeit a case-by-case, hit-or-miss patchwork of twelve packaged tracks.     To Ashlee’s advantage, she hits best in cases when she hits hard, and she can really hit hard. To her disadvantage, though, she spends too much time softening up, and, at the other end of the spectrum, she can really get soft (we’re talking haiku Jewel). The album’s opening third then becomes both astounding and disappointing, because while it is like a platter of Ashlee’s best songwriting and lyrical skills, it sets the bar very high for the remaining eight songs. The title track is much deeper than it sounds as the theme song to  The Ashlee Simpson Show . Starting bitterly, a crawling bass foreshadows the brilliant chorus, pure indie funk chug with that synth guitar from the Cars’  “Just What I Needed” lurking in the background. Ashlee’s tender and frank delivery, perhaps, is the song’s convincing aspect, as she rambles through both flirtation and heartbreak effortlessly.  “Pieces of You” and “Shadow” both outdo their respective familiarities, the latter trumping Christina’s Grammy-winning “Beautiful” (although it does sound suspiciously similar), the former mixing folky Jewel and Jason Mraz’s “The Remedy” into one hell of a headlining single. Actually, “Shadow” should be the album’s second single, a brilliant quasi-ballad and album standout that hopefully won’t be kept from radio just because of its Jessica-bashing lyrics (“I was stuck inside someone else’s life/and always second best”). But easily most shocking is “La La,” a wildly aggressive track about, well, more than kissing. Ashlee’s homage to Hole is undeniable as she rambles through lines like “I like it better when it hurts” and equates herself to a “French maid” and an “alley cat,” brilliantly sexing her way through a Donnas-inspired guitar thrash. The listener, inevitably, is left higher than he/she (actually just he) ever thought he’d be, starting to consider (okay, fantasize about) the doubled “e” porn-star spelling of Miss Simpson’s now more-hot-than-cute name.   Higher highs only make for lower lows, though, as both “Love Makes the World Go Round” and “Better Off” prove. “Love Makes…” sounds like Jimmy Eat World’s “In the Middle” at a third the pace, and “Better Off” just can’t find a decent melody. So, halfway through the album, bipolarity has settled for better and for worse, conveniently in that order. What becomes notable, though, is that Ashlee has so exceeded sub-par expectations that you’re suddenly fighting for her, not against her, which subtly shows that her music speaks louder than her MTV-recorded words. And while you fight for her, she fights by imitation, wearing wigs and playing dress-up to alt rock’s greater goddesses, a strategy that works well, like an audible version of “I Want a Famous Face.”      Ashlee once again pleases with tracks like “Unreachable,” in which she works up a sexy jazz steam over a “Criminal”-reminiscent piano lick (Fiona). The chorus is beautifully melodic and Ashlee is surprisingly witty (“got me heels over head”), combining to make this piece the album’s diamond in the rough. Similarly, “Love Me for Me” instantly brings Maroon 5’s “Harder to Breath” to mind, but culminates in an Audioslave-worthy chorus (which may actually be degrading Cornell & Co. more than it is praising Ashlee). “Nothing New” begins with a fast, Nirvana-meets-“Hand in My Pocket” guitar line as Ashlee croons into a Natalie Imbruglia impression (seriously, almost dead-on) for the “Wishing I Was There”-rewrite refrain, and a final highlight is “Surrender,” much-publicized on her television show, which puts together the electro-funk of Puddle of Mudd’s “Blurry” with a surprisingly bluesy midsection.   All in all, Ashlee Simpson looks not to ride her sister’s fame but to dodge it, which much of “Autobiography” succeeds in doing. She has the singles and much of the bulk to make this is a killer debut, even if she is more the wild-card of the Simpson family. Yes, the album drags out poorly (the closing duo is nothing more than average). But for such an inexperienced artist, she really brings a lot of writing talent to the table, including words that at times can be hotter than Jessica’s body. About a minute into the first track, Ashlee claims to have “a million subtleties.” While a lyric like that could end some artists’ careers (hell, if R. Kelly shared all his subtleties, no one would ever piss alongside him again), it only levitates Ashlee’s. Fact is, with her little secrets, you might want to get to know many, if not every single one.

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Turn Me On -Kevin Lyttle (feat. Spragga Benz) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #9 It’s hard not to feel bad for Kevin Lyttle, who was endowed with the voice of a helium intake and stuck with such lines as “hug me, hug me, kiss me, squeeze me” throughout “Turn Me On,” the lead single from his eponymous debut. The music doesn’t really help his case, sounding like a soccer jock jam mixed with some clichéd reggae synth, ultimately more 80s than anything else on summer radio during 2004. Oh yeah, as if the guy didn’t have enough to worry about, he has a terribly foreshadowing surname.    The Verdict:  5.2/10-  Brouhaha   (2.6/5)

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Lean Back -Terror Squad Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #7 Ultimately an instantly recognizable smash, Terror Squad’s “Lean Back” is brilliantly biting gangsta rap that, above all else, pushes the message that Fat Joe can’t dance (which is good, because previously there were quite a few fans who thought that the Big Pun follower could bust a sick move). Over a thrilling beat that might as well have been penned by DJ M. Night Shyamalan (of “Sixth Sense” and “Signs” fame), Joe and partner Remy Martin rumble through their pasts, their presents, and Joe’s opinions on pop culture (“B2K crip-walkin’ like that’s what’s up!”). In 2003, we had to get low. This year, we only have to lean back. Thank god for that, because, if I may speak for us all, we need to save our thighs for other things.

       This week's CD  :   urlLink The Tipping Point  by the Roots  (Week of  7/12/04  to  7/19/04 )    Release date  :  July 13th, 2004  Rating  :   7.6/10  ( 3.8/5)   Get Audible  :  "Don't Say Nuthin'," "Boom!," "The Mic"      "Where You Drew The Line"    The sentiment involved in getting pushed to the edge, becoming fed up with, or nearing the tipping point may be perfectly hallmarked by Black Thought not far into “Star/Pointro,” the Sly & the Family Stone-sampling opener to the Root’s 7th album: “Keeping it real will kill you if you end up letting it.” Thus, the album title, not able to be simplified to just a Malcolm Gladwell novel, is a definitive statement against continuation.   “The Tipping Point,” invisible to the critical and social world but easily perceptible to the Roots, is an outer edge, a sort of invisible fence for each member of the hip-hop super band .  So, the Roots chose to electrify and commercialize on this disc, in a way not to become electrocuted and burned out by that very fence (which may be caused by continuing their less commercial, more experiment sound of both “Things…” and “Phrenology”). That older Roots sound, which has come to be somewhat expected, is the “keeping it real” of Black Thought’s aforementioned diction, so shifting sound and style becomes the blueprint for much of “The Tipping Point,” a blueprint simplified into lyric during the choral attack of “Boom!”: “What we have here is a brand new sound.”  Taking a Phish-like approach to making this album, the Roots apparently jammed upwards of 25 minutes for each track, then nitpicked select beats to use to form song structures. Nitpicking, though, just starts to define their process, for each track then became a packaged piece of artsy hip-hop to potentially hit radio stations and t.v. stations. Much of the focus for this album is jazz, unlike the genre-hopping “Phrenology” of 2002. Perhaps, then, “Stay Cool” becomes the inevitable centerpiece, taking a secondhand De La Soul beat that morphs from a sunny-day jazz stroll to freestyle saxophone over a paranoid backing section. The lyrics push one of the simpler messages on the album (aside from the scat-babble attempted in the “Don’t Say Nuthin’” chorus): “Stay cool muthafucka’s y’all know the rules.” “Boom!” lies in the same vein; it sounds like a jazz-scratch response to the Beastie Boy’s recent “Ch-Ch-Check it Out.” With sax stabs and DJ wiggle alternating over trash-can drumming, Black Thought hyper-spits lines as happening as they are absurd (“It’s Black, code name Yafet Koto Ock”), seeming to play the harder, wiser cousin to Alfred Molina’s Spiderman-bashing Doc Ock. That antagonism is not foreign to Black Thought, and it becomes the role he most often slips into throughout “The Tipping Point.”  Spiteful and cocky are his words in the lead single, the two-faced “Don’t Say Nuthin’” (first face: commercial flop, second face: verbal drive-by through Chinatown), as he denounces the lesser and commends the greater, the Roots, and the great, himself. That beat (which oddly evokes Bow Wow’s “Let’s Get Down”) is pure Eastern-tinged funk, much like “Duck Down!,” a club-hopping Timbaland-esque track, boasting a sound seemingly achieved effortlessly that many of today’s producers try to imitate. Black Thought again plays the villain, potentially one-upping the late Hova by claiming to “spit what your wig absorb, sicker than sycamore.” Aside from self-endorsement, though, Thought takes a few political jabs, pronouncing that “every record ain’t a record just to shake behinds” over bleeding guitar funk and crawling bass dribble in “Guns are Drawn,” and later condemning those who “pray to Coca-Cola instead of the gods” in “Why (What’s Goin On?).”  All cockiness, jazziness, and seriousness aside, ?uestlove turns around his recent employment as Dave Chappelle’s music manager for “The Mic,” the first of the album’s pair of bonus tracks. Pure brouhaha, the Roots pull a Danger Mouse and drop what sounds like a Stones snippet beneath a rollicking crowd of hipsters (among them Chappelle) who claim to love the mic more than even the most impressive consolation, the opposite sex. This, of course, puts the mic and music above an endless list of wordly things, not to exclude the ever-feared concept of commercial success.  That commercial success is seen on “The Tipping Point” as the Roots cut out many elements of their past: A-list verbalists (Talib and Mos flow right off of the tongue), neo-soul styling (we’re thinking “Break You Off”), and clever wordplay in choruses to name a few. But, while high production values tend to classify this disc as being a commercial push, that never-failing mouth of Tariq Trotter (BT) puts the Roots right back on the cutting edge of commercialism. “They made a lot of money, [but] money never made them,” he aptly points out on “I Don’t Care,” a sequel to “Rock You!” In essence, it isn’t the money, the fame, the pop charts, or the girls that matter to the “legendary Roots crew.” It’s the thought, black or white, that they create music to be heard and loved, whether underground or more mainstream. This album sides with the latter, but nevertheless will bounce and bob with every spin. The only difference becomes, then, that where you drew the line, the Roots marked the tipping point.

        That's right, famed hoopster  Shaquille O'Neal  is moving out of L.A. and back to Florida (home of former team the Orlando Magic). He'll be in a Miami Heat uniform next year playing under a very open  Pat O'Riley  (Riley on Shaq: "We feel that we have traded for the best player in the NBA"). Meanwhile, former teammate  Kobe Bryant  will be in heat playing under a very open pair of legs.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Flap Your Wings - Nelly  Every summer, it seems the ultimate epitome for hip-hop stars and R&amp;B groups to create that nagging, ceaseless dance hit (the “urban Macarena” if you will) to last for summers to come. Viable attempts have been made (most recently and memorably Lil’ Jon’s “Get Low” of ’03), but apparently enough room was left for Nelly to pump out “Flap Your Wings,” the headlining single to his third release, “Sweat.” Continually demanding that you “get your eagle on,” Nelly creates an animalistic dance move cousin to such classics as the jitterbug, the camel walk, the chicken dance, the monkey, and the bunny hop. The problem, though, is that the music is terribly empty (at times during the verses dropping to merely a drumbeat) aside from a few organ octaves, which lack the vigor to convince anyone to bust out like an endangered animal. Bottom line: Don’t be surprised if you’re wife doesn’t “flap her wings” at your wedding reception.   The Verdict:  3.5/10 - Brouhaha  ( 1.75/5 )

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Naughty Girl -Beyoncé  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #3  Catching Beyoncé at her most blatantly sexual moment throughout  Dangerously in Love , “Naughty Girl” is just a notch short of “Crazy in Love” as a single. Favoring off-kilter harmonies to R&amp;B croons, she chugs her way through 3½ minutes of extemporaneously orgasmic verses and speedy bridge deliveries akin to those in  Outkast’s  “Ghettomusick.” And, for once, she takes an entire upbeat single for herself, not letting any significant other get in the way of her Eastern-tinged teasing. When soulmate  Jay-Z  was all about the dirt,  Beyoncé  was all about the flirt.  Best Moment:  That sultry and soulful high note she hits every other verse line, which makes  Mariah’s  voice-whistling in “Heartbreaker” sound like a sped-up  Kanye  sample.   The Verdict:  9.4/10 - The Fork   (4.7/5)       2004 Best Singles Club Entry

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink I Miss You -Blink 182  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #42  All the bubblegum punks who knew every lyric to “All the Small Things” should have seen it coming:  Blink-182  was going to try to mature. The best evidence of this is “I Miss You,” the second single from their self-titled 7th album. But as opposed to sounding artsy, classy, or even respectable, the song comes off as a punk-pop regurgitation of the  Smashing Pumpkins’  “Tonight, Tonight,” all the way down to  Tom Delonge’s  terribly annoying vocals (remember  Billy Corgan , the master of that art?). If  Blink  wants to mix their foul-mouthed roots with maturity, maybe the world needs its first song ever about erectile dysfunction.   The Verdict:  3.6/10 - Brouhaha   (1.8/5)

      Recently, a Mexican woman decided to receive her 13th pair of breast implants in hopes of having the largest breasts in the world. Having large breasts has always been one of her perks, though going for the world record seems an ultimate achievement. As international researchers looked at pictures of the woman's progress, they reported that the rise of plastic surgery use to mold busts may eventually put  Kleenex  out of business. Then they realized what they were masturbating into.  Meanwhile, a 33 year-old man in Romania announced plans to sell his penis to a victim of a genital cut this week. The man,  Constantin Dugulan , wants the money to support his younger brothers, and in the past has offered to sell his kidneys and one of his eyes. Though details are still foggy, a second reason for the sale surfaced earlier today. Responding to the most common query ("Why don't you want your penis?"),  Dugulan  said this: "I'm married; I don't need it anymore."

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink 100 Years -Five For Fighting  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #28  After emerging as the  Adult Contemporary  body double for  Ben Folds  with “Superman (It’s Not Easy)” in late 2000,  John Ondrasik  of  Five for Fighting  fortunately took on a much bigger role. As of now, he is our generation’s  Elton John , not in dress or sexual preference, but in sound, and “100 Years” is his “Tiny Dancer.” This irresistible piano jam, fusing music box pianism and  Ondrasik’s  warm voice, is the best thing of its sort since  Folds’  “Brick.” Like grammar, though, Ondrasik's lyrics set the stage for some exceptions to his rule; he sings that “we've only got 100 years to live.” What about  Rick James , bitch?

       This week’s CD:   urlLink Scissors Sisters  by Scissor Sisters (Week of 8/9 to 8/16)  Release date:  2004  Rating:   8.8/10 (4.4/5)   Get Audible:  "Take Your Mama," "Mary," "It Can't Come..."     "Fish in the Water"    The movie was  Jack.  The premise portrayed an elementary-school boy (the anything but boyish  Robin Williams ) with an aging disorder that advanced him to a 40-something body type while still trying to meld with the mini-brat packers at his learning level, all the while learning reading, writing, and concealing the grade’s biggest hard-on from  Jennifer Lopez  (a well-updated  Mrs. Robinson ).  Scissors Sisters , if not scripted exactly the same, seem in the same boat; the ultra-glam five-pack matures into something too grown to balance animalism with  Junior Senior , but at the same time too adventurous to trade kiddie porn with  Gary Glitter . More of a hipster disorder than an aging disorder, they pioneer their own lifestyle as Jack does, although Jack’s pioneering is a fault of science, while the Sisters have nothing to blame but sexual energy. Actually, maybe it is science that joins a hodgepodge of homosexuals, potential transsexuals, and metrosexuals; but anyone who’s ever delved into suffix study can look above and see that it all relays back to sex.  This sexual power-something that the aforementioned  Junior Senior  never really had-crafts an album set musically in 1977 and mindfully in 1969; that free-love attitude masquerades as a gay-disco cover band rifling through 43 minutes of music that no one requests but everyone can shag to. Problems expected of that era arise; “Filthy/Gorgeous” (the best interpolation of the  Mario  bass theme yet) sees  Pretty Woman’s  “biggest moneymaker [go] flaccid,” while “Music is the Victim,” which breeds disco with blues like “Diamond Dogs” did with country, pitches vocalist  Jake Shears  as the  Jesus  who says “fuck the 10 commandments” in lieu of saving the music (now there’s an idea  VH1  hasn’t commercialized).  That framework for the album, while intriguing to every listener, is the handicap that will keep the  Sisters  from hitting big in the States. Radio stations dismiss the disc’s singles as quickly as the  FCC  dropped its sticker on the cover, all because flirtations with free and choice love underscore the entire album.  The music labels the band members quicker than they could label themselves, sacrificing identity for a good ride that should stay the hell out of the South-central America.   All that said, some brilliant pop songs surface here; “Take Your Mama” provides the one glimpse of mainstream, as island guitars mesh with  Elton -esque pianism to find a chorus that reinvents  Ben Stiller’s   Starsky and Hutch  “Do it” as a full-frontal command of high-pitch. “Comfortably Numb,” the sometimes-awkward, sometimes-pleasing  Pink Floyd  cover, may as well be a tribute to the late  Maurice Gibb . Best is “It Can’t Come Quickly Enough,” which starts as a lurking, echoed,  Amnesiac -meets- Roxy Music  pastiche, and soon becomes a darker rewrite of  Björk’s  “Hyper-Ballad” that could have been penned by  Placebo  if they took themselves seriously. Reversing that logic is “Mary,” another beautiful piece that sounds like an outtake from “Sea Change,” only if  Beck  was in a little lighter mood.  Running that gamut of musical textures and tempers works dazzling effects for  Scissor Sisters , and the genre-copping elements here and there further their artistic achievement. The sly prog saxophone that highlights the closing of “Laura,” the picketing-gone-audible feel of “Tits on the Radio,” and the toy-like mutations throughout “Lovers in the Backseat” (my first thought: The  Rugrats  Theme) all side-dish this wonderful entrée. On “Better Luck,”  Shears  sees himself a “fish swimming without fins.” Also called “sinking,” that proclamation denies all fish-out-of-water presumptions by showing that  Scissor Sisters  are so stuck in their mascara-lined environment that they can’t ever leave. Unless, of course, they get hooked, which is extremely unlikely; they’ve already hooked you.

      Yesteray, Monday the 9th of August,  Donald Duck  received a much-deserved star on the  Hollywood Walk of Fame . Since 1934,  Donald  has played a mischevious counterpart to the snug  Mickey Mouse  with his infamous smoker's quack, leaving a mark on both the  Disney  channel and pop culture that will last for a long time. "Donald particularly appreciates this," said  Disney  chief executive  Michael Eisner , who helped present the star in front of the  El-Capitan Theatre  in Hollywood.  One of the first cartoon characters to receive worldwide appreciation,  Donald  and girlfriend  Daisy Duck  have inspired numerous spin-offs, from the  Huey, Dewey, &amp; Louie  nephew trio to the short-lived superhero  Darkwing Duck . Though constantly unintelligible in his raspy delivery,  Donald  easily won over America, the final proof-of-celebrity being this legendary  Walk of Fame  award. As for a post-promenade celebration,  Donald  commented that "even though it isn't Winter,  Daisy  will be migrating south tonight."  000000000000000000000

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Locked Up -Akon feat. Styles P.  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #31  Never before has their been a summer anthem so directly rooted in jail-time as  Akon’s  “Locked Up,” which profiles the artist’s continuing troubles with the law. As a vocalist,  Akon  plays his cards well like  Nelly ; neither can sing particularly well, but they draw attention with emotion in their inflections ( Nelly’s  sensual,  Akon’s  aching). Rocking a backbeat that sounds like  Eminem  remixed  Tupac’s  “Changes,” with misting strings and a clockwork derivative of that sampled piano lick,  Akon  narrates his problems like a cousin to  Kevin Lyttle  who’s sexuality is never questioning. Guest  Styles P.  does his own thing, rumbling through prison experience, but the show-stealer is the soulful chorus that, while slyly channeling  Michael Jackson’s  “Billie Jean,” updates millions of African-American spirituals sung to ease situational pain. This lurking jam may just rearrange your to-do list;  getting locked up  may have just inched above  getting knocked up.    The Verdict:  6.7/10 - The Fork   (3.35/5)

      "This is by far the craziest show ever," said  Hillary Duff  on Sunday afternoon, responding to a small fire that started while she was 6 songs into her  Gwinnett Arena  show (Atlanta). A short-circuited speaker was the cause of the problem, leaving some 10,000 fans to wait an hour while  Duff's  crew changed the speaker. While on-site coordinators reported that no one was injured, there was mild commotion amidst the front row, where the heat could be felt significantly.  Duff's  bodyguards commented that the fire was alarming, but it did go well with the 10,000 flames in the audience.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink So Sexy -Twista feat. R. Kelly  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #28  This year hasn’t seen a more awkward summer jam than  Twista’s  “So Sexy,” the third release from his career-making sophomore effort,  Kamikaze . Produced by  R. Kelly , the track meshes cool, juicy keyboards with cellular wriggles to back the unlikely duo in their seaside scoping. Unfortunately, the song quickly simmers into the result of censoring, PG-rating, and laziness;  Kelly , the man who once wanted to stick his key in our ignition, walks wounded from his past age-limit problem like it’s a “you must be this tall to ride me” sign. Churning out a boring beach bash that at its most ambitious claims  Twista  to be “so sexy,” R. seems at a loss for hotness, sensuality, and (his personal favorite) raunchiness. Worst of all, he’s paired with hip hop’s motor-mouth, who, despite the laidback beat, raps like his ass is on fire. Let’s face it: An  R. Kelly -produced single is no single at all if it doesn’t encourage raw, unprotected sex, and “So Sexy” won’t cause any rise in home pregnancy testing.    The Verdict:  4.8/10 - Brouhaha   (2.4/5)

Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink The Reason -Hoobastank  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2  The problem with  Hoobastank’s  “The Reason” isn’t that it follows vainly behind  3 Doors Down’s  “Here Without You” as a longing, somber ballad that will appeal to addicts and artists alike. It’s not the acoustic/electric guitar line that morphs into repetitive power chords either. Maybe the trouble with this crossover single is that vocalist  Doug Robb’s  lyrics are openly welcoming, so that they invite the listener into conversation, but also terribly contradictory, so that they lead to nothing but confusion. Observe:   Doug Robb:   I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be.   Listener:   Wait…if the person that you want to change is who you used to be, doesn’t that mean you’ve already changed?   DR:   I’m not a perfect person.   L:   So you admit to a gross lyrical error?   DR:   It’s something I must live with everyday.   L:   Oh, sorry.   DR:   I wish that I could take it all away.   L:   Oh, Doug, it’s not really that bad of a lyric…I mean, what’s your reason to want to take it away?   DR:   The reason is you.   L:   I’m gonna leave now.   The Verdict:  4.5/10 - Brouhaha   (2.25/5)

Hosts  Paris Hilton  and  Nicole Richie  will churn through the 37 awards on Wednesday night, some normal and others, well, not. Big winners include  The O.C.  and its cast, together nabbing 4 awards, R&amp;B maestro  Usher , who took home 4 music awards,  Ashton Kutcher , who (along with  Punk'd ) grabbed 3 awards,  Adam Sandler , who took home 2 individual awards, and  Ashlee Simpson , who also received 2 awards. The night's brightest star, though, was  Lindsay Lohan , who won 4 individual categories for her work in  Mean Girls  and  Freaky Friday . Among those 4 are  Comedy Movie Actress  (for  Mean Girls ),  Movie Breakout Star  (for both works), and, called her "most precious award,"  Puberty Inducer  (for gigantic breasts).

      Testing new waters of campaigning,  President George W. Bush  recently met  Roland Martin  in Crawford, Texas, where the two  urlLink filmed a  Fishing With Roland Martin  special  to help  Bush's  reelection bid. The show aired on the  Outdoor Life Network  on Friday, and encore runs will play this Wednesday and Thursday (6:30 EDT).  "The number of folks that fish is off the chart," said  Martin  of  Bush's  appearance, pushing the idea that  Bush's  televised role as a fisherman may contribute some needed votes come November.  Bush , who showed up with his Scottish terrier  Barney , refrained from political talk for the entire taping, again looking like your average father figure out to relax and catch bass.  Traditional baits, hooks, and tackle were the audience to  Bush's  storytelling, as he reminisced on pasttimes he spent with his family out on the lake. After sitting in on  ESPN  broadcasts and throwing first pitches at  Yankee  games, this stunt seems pretty tame for the  President . Actually, after demonstrating his fishing rod skills, the  Pres  commented that he did the show "just to prove that  John Kerry  isn't the only candidate who can get a hook up."  00000000

      Post-breakup word wars continue between  Nick Carter  and  Paris Hilton  as the public eye turns toward bruises on  Hilton's  face and body. Answering a recent question,  Hilton's  post-bruise comment was simply that she is "so happy to  be single right now," obviously incriminating  Carter  without direct accusation. Harshly refuting all attempts at blame,  Carter  has done little but deny. "I'll tell you one thing: I didn't touch her. I'm not that kind of guy. I would never [hit  Paris ]." He continued: "But as for the gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and herpes, I'm your man!"

       R Family Vacations , a cruise company run by  Rosie O'Donnell , will be documented in a 2005  HBO  feature for its open-handed attitude towards gay and lesbian couples.  Rosie  and partner  Kelli Carpenter O'Donnell  were married in late February and spent a week in July on the cruise, experiencing everything from New York to the Bahamas in the company of 500 other gay and lesbian families. The documentary was filmed by  Rosie , who is blatantly in favor of pushing the liberal message behind the cruises. Asked for her comment,  Kelli Carpenter O'Donnell  enjoyed the sea trip but didn't see the need to go to such lengths, explaining that she "doesn't usually have to leave the house to see a whale."  0000000000

Officer  Esther Rayes  reported that no suspect has been identified in the robbery, by which large amounts of jewelry, personal items, and money were stolen. Further theft may explain a missing laptop, video tapes, and several pictures of  Paris  with ex-beau  Nick Carter .  00000000000000-0   Police forensics have leaked that the criminal most likely entered from behind the house and was able to easily lift the goods.

Kelly  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #85  She’s had sex on the beach (“Don’t Let Me Be The Last to Know”), on the dance floor (“I’m a Slave 4 U”), and in an airplane (“Toxic”); where else is there for America’s engaged heiress to lose her inhibitions and try to apologize for it later? At some point  R. Kelly  must have mentioned  the Amazon  (I was thinking more the internet), not a surprising suggestion seeing that he recently turned his recording studio into a jungle. That seems the scene for “Outrageous,” a 3½ minute single that advances  Disney’s   Simba  and  Nala  from their  General Audiences  seal into a dirty African orgy (a graduation once staged by  Brit  herself). Seriously, though, the song’s lone highlight is its midsection bridge, when  Britney  croons over an animal kingdom choir that sounds cut from  Elton’s  own “Circle of Life.” What some might call a  Spears / Kelly  “duet” (but is more  Britney  singing while  R.  masturbates), the track rides the limper cousin to “Get Ur Freak On”s bhangra rhythm paired with  Kelly’s  “Thoia Thoing” clichéd instrumentation, fielding flutes, bongos, Eastern strings, and a koto line. As  Brit  asks climactically to be taken to a place where “love is free” to be as “sexy as [she] wants to be,” it becomes clear that  Kevin Federline  will not be able to get her there (much less spell the song’s title).   The Verdict:  5.9/10 - Brouhaha   (2.95/5)

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Pieces of Me -Ashlee Simpson  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #16  In the early 90s, it took  The Cure  a full workweek to confess love, as described in their glam smash “Friday I’m in Love” ( “  I don't care if Monday's blue/Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too/Thursday I don't care about you/It's Friday I'm in love  ” ). Over a decade later, attesting to both the  times ‘a changin’  motif and the rapid rise of her own fledgling stardom,  Ashlee Simpson  has released “Pieces of Me,” in which she waits only until Wednesday to fall into adoration with fellow pop-rocker  Ryan Cabrera . Quickly climbing the charts with dreary acoustic verses (a pop remix of those in  Shawn Colvin’s  “Sunny Came Home”) and a bright chorus (which weds  Jason Mraz’s  “The Remedy” and  Sheryl Crow’s  “The First Cut…”),  Ashlee  will likely trump her sister a second time by claiming the highest  Simpson -family charting ever. Going back to that retro-research, it’s relevant to cite  MC Hammer  in his boast that we couldn’t touch him (circa 1990). Now,  Ashlee Simpson  is asking for us to take a piece of her. So as opposed to the  "waiting for love"  and  "straying from touching"  attitudes of yesteryear, this generation is jumping into relationships and grabbing handfuls of each other, all while our new favorite  Ashlee  (Olsen who?) is singing the soundtrack.   The Verdict:  6.9/10 - The Fork   (3.45/5)

      According to the  Associated Press , a  urlLink racy new reality show  airing on  KRCA-TV Channel 62  (in L.A.) is awarding its winners with the potential for a green card. Called  Gana la Verde  ( Win the Green ), the Spanish television program awards its winner with a team of lawyers who may help the contestant speed up the process of immigration into the United States. Initially referred to as a more rewarding  Fear Factor , the show breeds the want for citizenship with bogus physical feats;  Yahoo!  reports that "gulping down live tequila worms, trapping a butter-drenched pig and jumping between two speeding 18-wheelers" are just a few examples of such stunts.  So let's get this straight:  Gana La Verde  will put anxious Hispanics and Mexicans to the test so that they can gain rights into a country that will treat them poorly? Ultimately, the winner of this show will end up eating trash (live tequila worms), working a low-end farm job that no one wants (trapping a slippery pig), and running from the cops (jumping between two trucks). It sounds like this so-called reality show is more like American training.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Let's Get It Started -The Black Eyed Peas  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #41  The Black Eyed Peas are starting to piss off a lot of their new mainstream fans. After releasing a pumped-up version of “Hey Mama” (only for radio airplay) that shimmied up the charts much faster than the album version would have, they tweaked the gleaming “Let’s Get Retarded” for “Let’s Get It Started,” a weaker but more commercial version that is again not available on the  Elephunk  album. Gone are the black-humored dance commands to “bop your head like epilepsy.” Gone is the novelty feel of a song that urges you to get mental. Actually, from its opening  Fergie  croon (a blatant rip of  Alicia Key’s  vocals that start “Fallin’”), the track is a mess, begging for likeability with a sellout bass line, some juiced guitar stabs, and drums that couldn’t touch  ?uestlove . Opting to push the song’s appeal by playing it beneath an  NBA Championship  commercial (like they did with “Hey Mama” in that  iPod  ad), the group wasted time advertising for  Kobe  and  Shaq  with what could have been the theme to the  Special   Olympics .   The Verdict:  4.6/10 - Brouhaha   (2.3/5)

      Just a few nights ago, I heard a  Conan  rerun that claimed the world's oldest    Viagra -taker to be 99 years old. Meanwhile,  Cialis , the erectile dysfunction medicine that claims to outlast  Viagra , has had a 2004 eruption, broadcasting commercials and getting more popularity than ever. Maybe even trumping that fame is  Enzyte , a natural male enhancement pill that has advertised in massive amounts with hard-not-to-like narratives that go through the life improvements of an  Average Joe  who started taking the medication.  Now, even with all this commotion about who has the best medication for men, new reports are surfacing that may push the border with sexual dysfunction medication for women. A  urlLink recent report from Discovery Health  goes through the facts (including the stat that 43% of women suffer from sexual dysfunction as opposed to 31% of men) and seems to foreshadow a future with pills or other medications that sex-starved women can take to help in their searches.  Maybe the universal quandry focuses around an easier solution without pills or medicines to help us fulfill our desires. Isn't there anything easier? Hell, if one of my nephews ever has impotency problems, I'll just buy him an Erector set.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink This Love -Maroon 5  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #5  Following in the wake of other number-in-name rock clusters, a throne previously warmed by  Third Eye Blind  and  Matchbox 20 ,  Maroon 5  have burst into the mainstream with two high-charting hits, the latter of which is this summer’s pop/rock gem. Called “This Love,” it’s somewhat of a narrative allowing singer  Adam Levine  to evoke sympathy in his grievance of how it’s so hard to “keep [his girlfriend] coming every night.” Reworking the same piano-pound bass line that helped  Santana’s  “Smooth” overheat the masses in summer 1999, the track lays down funk guitars and sturdy percussion to match  Levine’s  faux-soul delivery. Constantly equating love to “just a game” (remember  Santana’s  second comeback hit with  Michelle Branch , “Game of Love?”), the boys of  Maroon 5  chug through a breakup song that ends in  Levine’s  unwillingness to “say goodbye anymore” to his constantly-leaving lady. This single’s underlying moral may be that if you want a relationship with a Type A vocalist (we’re thinking  Rob Thomas ,  Mark McGrath ), your connection will have to be a little deeper than coming and going.   The Verdict:  6.5/10 - The Fork   (3.25/5)

      Along with lawyer  Martin Singer ,  Arnold Schwarzenegger  has settled a lawsuit against an Ohio distribution company that put out bobble-head dolls featuring the action star-gone-politician wearing a business suit and clutching a gun. Overly careful about how he appears on the screen in public,  Schwarzenegger  will allow continued production to flow from the  Ohio Discount Merchandise Inc.  company, but the bobble heads will feature no gun. On sale for $19.99 (Internet sale only), some proceeds may go to the  Arnold All-Stars  after school program, which is based in Los Angeles. Obviously angered by the original production of the somewhat stereotypical dolls,  Schwarzenegger  stated a desire to maintain his head-bobbing in other places, like when he’s below Fabio’s waist.

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Accidentally in Love -Counting Crows  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #43  It seems almost a fairy tale that eleven years after their emergence the Counting Crows have finally written their best single ever, easily trumping past attempts to breed rock/pop with jangle poetry. Maybe more a demented fairy tale (not unlike the  Shrek 2  film that it plays the theme to), the song is called “Accidentally in Love,” a feel-good pop romantic with folly for lyrics and the occasional racy double-meaning that we knew  Adam Duritz  (vocalist) just couldn’t leave behind (prime example: “Just get yourself inside her”).  Durtiz’s  snaky verses spiced with bouncing call-backs speed into an all-or-nothing chorus that serenades with one of the finest come-ons in musical love history (um, well, “Come on, come on!”). I guess what makes the song, aside from chugging electric-acoustic chords, is  Adam’s  tenderness, a quality he has previously hidden (past lyric: “We spend all day getting’ sober"). Remember when  Enrique Iglesias  paraded around assuring that “you can’t escape [his] love,” all the while making like  Schwarzenegger  and leaving little of  Anna Kournikova’s  body untouched?  Duritz  counters that brilliantly by telling his opposite that there’s “no escaping [her] love.” He’s the one who deserves to be touched (and we've all been waiting for that summer anthem that makes us want to feel Adam Duritz).   The Verdict:  9.1/10 - The Fork   (4.55/5)     2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry

       This week’s CD:   urlLink Cee-Lo Green...is the Soul Machine  by Cee-Lo      (Week of 8/2 to 8/9)  Release date:  March 2nd, 2004  Rating:   8.7/10 (4.35/5)   Get Audible:   "The Art of Noise," "I'll Be Around," "All Day Love Affair"      "Attitude & Appetite"    Not surprisingly, Cee-Lo falls into the exact same paradox as Outkast’s Big Boi. The latter is the shorter member of his urban supergroup, standing three inches short of Dré at 5’8’’. The former proudly proclaims himself as a “5 foot 6 inch God” in the middle of “Evening News,” the 11th track on his latest release, Cee-Lo Green is the Soul Machine. Regardless of size, though, both him and Big Boi talk big, live big, and weigh in big, evidence being Cee-Lo’s portrayal of himself as “The Soul Machine.” This godly status is not the only big statement that Cee-Lo makes throughout the album; on “Glockapella,” an anti-Goodie Mob thrash over a slowed down, whip-cracking James Brown beat, he ensures that “it’s gonna get funky when I’m fryin’ these little fishes.” But like Big Boi, he also takes time to share his sensitive side. Both of them employ their young sons, Big Boi’s Bamboo and Cee-Lo’s Kingston Callaway, to drop lines at some point in their albums. While Bamboo is used to karaoke Outkast’s “The Whole World,”  Kingston is used to reinforce his father’s position as the Soul Machine, which only emphasizes the maintained attitude that Cee-Lo clearly draws out within the last twenty seconds of his album, in his response to the question, “Shit Lo, what don’t you do?” His response: “Fuck around.”   This lack of fucking around starts early, in one of the two collaborations with Pharrell, “The Art of Noise.” Over a beat that features sly finger bass, a piano line akin to the one in Jay-Z’s “Change Clothes,” and a rolling drum line, Cee-Lo claims that he “sings because [he’s] happy, and [he] sings because [he’s] free.” Free from what? Well, he’s free from his former group, Goodie Mob, who he clearly sees as negative from the 4 minute bash in the aforementioned “Glockapella.” He is also free from his previously-shackling position as a little-known indie rapper, which he proves in a few ways. For one, this time around he is able to guest star the real Ludacris on “Childz Play,” not the Ludacris sound-a-like Big Gipp, who he featured on “Suga Baby” from his last album. Secondly, he is able to book huge producers this time around, from those two Neptunes tracks to tracks with Jazze Pha, Organized Noise, and, most impressively, Timbaland.  This joint with Timbaland, the simply named “I’ll Be Around,” is the centerpiece of the album. Sure, it is an ego boost, which Tim has an undeniable knack for producing (check out Missy Elliott’s “Lick Shots” or Tim’s own “Don’t Make Me Take It There”), but Cee-Lo has an incredibly intellectual sense of swagger, which he demonstrates through lines like “With a smile on my face, give the trophy to second place right after I won/And shake his hand firm like a man, but talk to him like a son.” The staggered beat sounds recycled from Tim’s “Funky Fresh Dressed” on Missy’s 2003 album “Under Construction,” but jungle thump percussion, horn vibrations every four measures, and an electronically programmed trumpet-funk line underneath each chorus make it all its own. This horn-laden production perfectly equals Cee-Lo’s affection for jazz-band instrumentation, as is shown on both “My Kind of People” and “Living Again.” “My Kind of People” alternates between lazy soul-club trumpets, a climb-up piano line, and absurd bongo percussion, while “Living Again” has a shakily-produced mute trumpet collective amidst its bridge, which leads into a chant-along chorus featuring Cee-Lo’s rapid spit.  Probably the most intriguing tracks on the album are those that take Cee-Lo into unexplored territory, of which there are many. “All Day Love Affair” is the urban revival of Super Furry Animals’ “Hello Sunshine,” with etch-a-sketch percussion, shy keyboard chords, and an underlying funk guitar that sounds like the slow motion patterning of pieces from the beat in Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’.” This Jackson pastiche comes out again in the spoken word piece “I Am Selling Soul,” where in the middle of liquefying techno a string line emerges that sounds loosely based on the strings in “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough.” This track’s soul brother, the spoken “Sometimes,” mixes MC Honky and Baz Luhrmann, of “Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)” fame. The beat is Honky, with coiling Snakecharmer flutes fluttering around growing strings, while the delivery is Luhrmann, as Cee-Lo drops insightful paradoxes for the passer-by, like “Sometimes hunger is the best food.”  This metaphorical idea of food is all over this album, and, probably not by coincidence, all over Cee Lo’s career. Lo states “I’m still standing in line at the world party trying to get some soul food” in “Die Trying,” which is both a comparison for his music and a reference to all three Goodie Mob albums that he contributed to. The most prestigious of these albums is Goodie Mob’s debut, “Soul Food,” a Southern typicality that has defined not only the sound of Cee-Lo’s music but also the extent of his genius; he gives haters some food to bite on in “Scrap Metal,” he predicts the nutritional appeal of his next girl in the excellent “The One” (“I bet you taste so good”), and he feeds his listeners violence in “Evening News” (“Now open wide and let me put the knife inside ya”). As stated, Cee-Lo is a large man, and maybe the big, ideological message of this album is the fusing of his appetite and his attitude into one bold statement for the entire world to hear, haters and lovers alike: He doesn’t fuck around when he’s eating.

      Two great feats have conquered the news lately, one being  Lance Armstrong's  record-setting cycling win and the other being a new obsession with  Kabbalah , seen in  Madonna's   Esther-and-beyond  conversion and  Britney Spears'  apparent wedding plans. With these two fads have come some flashy new armwear, namely a $1 cancer research bracelet available at  urlLink wearyellow.com  and a red-string  Kabbalah  bracelet currently selling for $25.99 at  urlLink Target .  Already, celebs are taking sides; the aforementioned  Madonna  &  Brit  pair sport  Kabbalah    bands along with  Kutch -lover  Demi Moore , while a slue of mentionables are wearing the yellow cancer bracelet;  Bono ,  Alec Baldwin ,  Bruce Willis ,  Robin Williams ,  Matt Damon  and  Ben Stiller  are among them. Most notably, however, has been the recent fashion of presidential candidates  Bush  and  Kerry , who both have been seen with yellow bands on,  Kerry  during his campaign.  All this commotion seems to beg a simple question: Which bracelet is better? Looking at the benefits of each purchase, we see that for $25 less than a  Kabbalah  string you can donate money to cancer research (and add to the current $7 million raised). But wait, my anxious friend. The  Kabbalah -wear may be pricy, but it is said to "protect against the evil eye" (notice how the paparazzi has backed off  Brit  a little since her buy?). So, in essence, you're either going to help someone else or protect yourself (for a little extra charge).  I currently wear neither of these things. Sure, the cancer idea is great, but I've been trying to get this  evil eye  to fuck off for  months  now. He's seen every single one of my moves... every single one  (a big sorry to my dog). So I'm kind of stumped on what to buy. And speaking of stumped, this kind of craze must really get to amputees and the limbless, just like the whole "no-carb" fad must make anorexics feel pretty left out (water &amp; crackers is not an  Atkins  option). But finally, we do have a decision that's harder to make than the '04 vote (just go for the guy with yellow on his wrist...oh shit).

       Recently, at a news conference to promote the blunder-full  Catwoman ,  Halle Berry  spoke out against America’s obsession with beauty, citing plastic surgery as one of the key downsides of our current culture.   To quote  Berry : "Beauty? Let me tell you something-being thought of as a beautiful woman has spared me nothing in life.” Hear that  Courtney Love ? Consider yourself lucky!  Seriously, though, the beauty issue has been at hand lately, with  Kirstie Alley  fighting out against her weight and now this  Catwoman  prowl. The battle essentially culminates in that one constant question: Do looks really matter? My instant erection says “yes.”

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Meant to Live -Switchfoot  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #18   urlLink Heaven -Los Lonely Boys  Current Billboard Hot 100 position: #19  It may not be irony, but it’s certainly worthy of mention that the #18 and #19 spots on this week’s  Billboard Hot 100  are in complete contradiction to each other; the higher single is  Switchfoot’s  “Meant to Live,” the lower single  Los Lonely Boys'  “Heaven.” “Meant to Live,” with its power-rock chorus (“We were meant to live for so much more”), speaks to spending your time on Earth to its fullest extent, narrating a tale of an anonymous “he” who seems to be hopeless in pursuit of that suggestion. “Heaven,” on the other hand, wants to abandon life’s current “prison” with an upward plea (“How far is heaven?”), all the while chugging through some Southwestern college rock that has made it the left-field single of the year (right there with  Modest Mouse’s  “Float On”). Also splitting the two tracks is the fact that one is an irresistible summer jam while the other is postmortem sludge, one deserving and one, well, not.  Switchfoot  seems to have invited the insult with “Meant…,” crafting an attempt at a triple-threat single by mixing rock/pop vocals, echoed grunge-updating guitars, and potentially Christian lyrics (like we needed another  P.O.D. ). That makes  Los Lonely Boys  the clear winner, as they croon blatantly religious lyrics over funk-spruced guitars, organs calls,  Santana -esque solos, and, best of all, a continually plucked bass line that wouldn’t be out of place in a  Michael Jackson  dance piece. On the  Switchfoot  hit,  Jonathan Foreman  (lead singer) poses a contemplative question: “Have we lost ourselves?”  Henry Garza  (Los Lonely vocalist) not only answers that query (“I’ve been lost in my own place”), but goes on to explain how he “need[s] to change.” That may be some good advice for  Switchfoot  to take.   Verdict 1:  Switchfoot - 4.4/10 - Brouhaha   (2.2/5)    Verdict 2:  Los Lonelies - 9.4/10 - The Fork     (4.7/5 )    2004 Best Singles Club Entry

       Brouhaha and the Fork  is your daily music review, taking a 2004 single and either loving it (the Fork) or hating it (brouhaha). Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink I Like That -Houston feat. Chingy, Nate Dogg, and I-20  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #13  Earlier this year,  VH1  and  Blender Magazine  awarded the #29 spot on their  50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs…Ever  countdown to  Meat Loaf  for his 1993 #1 single from  Back into Hell , the sequel to  Bat out of Hell . Looking into the bubbly balladeer’s vague lyrics (“I would do anything for love, but I won’t do that”),  VH1  asked for the definition of the continually mentioned “that” and got no worthy answer. Eleven years later, it seems that this summer’s hottest rookie,  Houston , is rapping himself into the same dilemma with “I Like That,” a club anthem that, while unquestioning getting millions to sing along, offers no valid description for the overused pronoun. Detective listening provides only one hint: Whatever “that” is, it’s bouncing, banging, and hearty, evidence being the beat that fuses digital funk bass, synth trumpet calls,  3000-cool  organs, and techno bird whistles. But wait a second; In 2003, guest lyricist  Chingy  put out his first single, “Right Thurr,” which featured this chorus line: “I like the way you do   that   right thurr.” Dammit. It seems that post-2000 Southern rappers have a certain “that” which pleases them, all the while unbeknownst to the rest of the world (read: white people). Putting all those findings together, we define “that” as an action  Meat Loaf  will not perform but the current urban community loves. So whether you’re head-bobbing to “I Like That” because you know what “that” is or intently listening and awaiting the case-solving clue,  Houston  seems to have your ears perked, an act that even  Meat Loaf  would do.

      It was released on Saturday,  July 30th , that the creators of the legendary  Girls Gone Wild  videos  urlLink have consented to a $1.1 million payment  for legal government claims. The total fee comes from two separate infractions, one a civil penalty (about $540,000) and one a customer payback (about $550,000). That payback will give approximately 84,000  GGW  customers a refund of $6 or more from the  Mantra Films Inc.  company (based in California).  Continually under legal speculation,  Mantra  has been found guilty of charging video buyers without their consent by entering them into a continuance program as soon as they purchase one  GGW  film. By that program, customers continued to receive and be charged for videos that they did not order. A giant corporation that has sold millions of videos,  Mantra  was happy to close this case. In the future, the company will have to get customer approval previous to every single sale.  And while the law got the  Girls Gone Wild  creators this time, it's a safe bet to say that in the future they will definitely get off.

      Even though faux-celeb couple  Nick Carter  and  Paris Hilton  have broken up (officially on  July 22nd ), they both  urlLink left a lifelong impression . During their short but wild relationship, the duo got tattoos to remember each other by;  Carter's  simply said  "Paris,"  while  Hilton's  ink remains mysterious. The blonde bombshell has yet to comment on the situation, but  Carter  claims that he doesn't regret the tattoo ("She'll have a place in my heart, always"). As for location, the memorative  "Paris"  rings around the Backstreet Boy's wrist.  0000000000   As a final thought on the all-too-common situation,  Carter  noted how it's nice to "look down and see that reminder of what I had staring up at me when I masturbate."
