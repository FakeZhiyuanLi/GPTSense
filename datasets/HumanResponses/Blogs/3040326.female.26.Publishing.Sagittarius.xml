        You are about to pay  The Penalty for Harbouring Partisans.    We’d like you to read the following three sentences out aloud please.  " I don’t believe in the media "  " I don’t believe in the media "  " I don’t believe in the media "  There yer go. Somewhere on the planet, a TV programme just died. Maybe a satellite crashed if you were concentrating hard enough; maybe an advertising agency went bust; a Hollywood studio burnt down.   Maybe, just maybe, a style magazine folded.   We believe in the power of positive thinking.  We guess opinion pieces are supposed to make narrative sense. Sorry. But we don’t believe in that, either. Narrative, like..er..fame...is a prison from which there is no escape, and, in capitals    WE , AND OUR ILK, OPERATE WITHIN THE IDEOLOGY OF FREEDOM.    So don’t expect any fucking stories out of us, right?  Right. So the human race is finished, Freud and fascism got replaced by behaviourism and ethics, four to the floor is over, AIDS is cool, Pete Waterman invented violence, incest is the world’s religion and there is no escape, ever, ever, ever, from becoming DavidBeckham.  Backwards reverb sound, flash to the year 2003, remember? That year when every human who’d ever seen, thought, watched, orgasmed DavidBeckham mutated from human into forty million from human DavidBeckhams, footballing and breeding babyBeckhams into existence all around the globe.   This fucking breeding thing has got to stop.  Fame is the most pernicious and extreme form of breeding thing known to mankind. Fame is the most pernicious and extreme form of virus known to mankind. It’s an external concretisation of identity; an end to the concept of change. The human race has been colonised by fame, and computers laugh like demons.  Gunshot.   Welcome to 1994. Slingshotted into the inescapable fame paradigm, Kurt Cobain opiate dreamed a novel pop-exit, transforming fame into legend, man into nothing. He’ll never play music again. Well Done Kurt.  Richey Edwards, learning quickly and usurped by his peer, trumped back eloquently in disappearance.  If Cobain’s intention had been to place a full stop by violence upon the ideology of fame, Edwards’ parry immediately reinvested the form with the potential for reromantisation of the dead – a wry comment and unfathomable oxymoronic vortex upon which his persona had been based from his entrance into replication.  By disappearing, Edwards formed an inexorable vortex through which Cobain’s desire became inverted. The two are inextricably linked – simultaneous Greatest Hits. Through this vortex – instead of creating a full stop - Cobain’s derive became profligate, and the logical conclusion of the spectacle was formed    – mass submission to the will of self-murder.    From a disgust with the fame virus, the two have become legion as ‘Forever Delayed Nirvana’, the unattainabilty only death can level. It’s what pornography beomes when it takes form; when the invasion, the colonisation, by the gaze becomes complete.  The vortex opened, the gaze became itself, we all became DavidBeckham and the human race has been colonised by murder.  Fame is Murder.  " What are you doing here? "   said some guy, at some art opening this week.  " We’re very well, thank you,"   we replied.  We hope he wasn’t being snide, but it irked us anyway. We guess we were there because we got a right, like the man says. But actually we don’t. We don’t got a right. We don’t have any at all. They don’t exist.  It’s an opinion piece, and as such is the voice of the author. This is a comment upon it, and an attempt to fold it back upon itself, to push Cobain and Edwards back through the wormhole they created – TV PRESENTER OUTS SECOND TV PRESENTER FOR ALLEGED RAPE OF THIRD TV PRESENTER – and then permanently close it.   Closure.   Baby, we're Luther Vandross in the shower. Help us. Give us your money. We are God.  Welcome to the death of after-thought.  James B.L. Hollands October 31st 2002.

       Strange town  I change buses in Knightsbridge, jump on the back of a 22 going towards Piccadilly and dash upstairs, in the seat at the back, huddles... urlLink  Steve Strange  who I haven't seen for a few months.  urlLink  He's  wrapped in a black fur coat and Liza black hair and a botox forehead, we chat a bit. I get invited to his 'new' club. He looks like a black carnation sitting there, blue marble pinned eyes. He invites me to some bar run by a friend of his. In the toilets a speedball is passed to me. In the mirror his make up looks better than mine and I'm not wearing any!

       Straight from the Horse's mouth, Volume One  Afternoon, Ladies, Gentlemen and Others,  Here is a basic introduction to myself and our services; I will be posting irregular bulletins about our activities forthwith. James B.L. Hollands.   urlLink  The Horse Hospital   - where all paths converge -    Cited recently in  The Evening Standard  as ' London's Real Home Of The Avant-Garde ', and upon  The Guardian ’s website as ' The Alternative ICA ',  The Horse Hospital  was established by Roger K. Burton in 1992 as a three tier arts organisation providing an umbrella for the related media of film, fashion, art and music.   Comprising of:  The Chamber Of Pop Culture ( Visionary & Underground Art )  kinoKULTURE ( Video & Film Presentation )  The Contemporary Wardrobe Collection ( Street Fashion 1945 - 2001 ),  The Horse Hospital is a Grade Two listed, two-floor, purpose-built stable for 24 horses. Built originally in 1797 by James Burton, the building was redeveloped sometime after 1860, and retains many of its original features, such as concrete moulded ramps, mock cobbled floor and iron tethering rings. The Horse Hospital is a rare example of a historically charged building operating with contemporary critical value.The Chamber of Pop Culture is an independent, non-profit organisation promoting a living and hitherto rarely documented, and even more rarely seen, cutting edge strand of modern art; giving artists the context and support they are denied elsewhere. With over 50 exhibitions in the past 10 years, the artists, musicians and filmmakers who have shown and been shown in The Chamber of Pop Culture share no common aesthetic bond, other than a desire to work and exhibit outside of the practise and theory prevalent in contemporary art dialogue.  In 1996, we began kinoKULTURE, London’s only permanent screening club for cult, underground classics, subversive and experimental new works, exclusive premieres, features, documentaries, short films, pop promos, performance footage and more! With a track record pushing five hundred films in five years - juxtaposing the hysterical and the beautiful, the decadent and the minimal - kinoKULTURE is a television station without a TV, dedicated to peeling the boundaries of film presentation.   Prestigious organisations such as the BFI, the Hayward Gallery, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Barbican Centre, the Shishedo Gallery in Tokyo, and the Brooklyn Museum of Modern Art in New York have all worked in conjunction with The Contemporary Wardrobe, The Chamber of Pop Culture and kinoKULTURE over the years giving the Horse Hospital international recognition, with the building and its exhibitions attract over 5000 visitors per year, with a relatively new but growing membership in excess of 1500. The building and its many diverse activities are supported by The Contemporary Wardrobe Collection, suppliers of unique pop fashion items to the film, TV and fashion industries. The Contemporary Wardrobe Collection is the sole, largest and most important free public access collection of street fashion and culture in Europe, housing over 15,000 important garments and accessories dating from 1945 to the present day, including many unique couture items.   With a huge archive of rare films and access to a definitive wealth of underground artists, performance artists, filmmakers, alternative musicians, photographers, fashion designers, and writers who participate in its success, The Horse Hospital is firmly established as    ' The UK's National Gallery Of Underground Art '    ( Francesca Gavin,  urlLink  Dazed and Confused , June 2002 )  For further information on programme, aesthetic, patronage, availability or membership, please contact :  James B. L. Hollands ( 020 ) 7833 3644  popculture@btclick.com  www.thehorsehospital.com  Legacies : The future sustained  The Horse Hospital bridges the gap between unnecessary suffering and a healthy, more productive working life by promoting good artist management and training.    The Horse Hospital is about sharing knowledge, not retaining it. We demonstrate to artists how their basic requirements of life - food, water and shelter - are not only vital but also attainable with our practical help. Collaboration from the early stages of a project guarantees their understanding and co-operation, as well as their ultimate independence. The world in which we work will not change in the foreseeable future. The Horse Hospital aims to go wherever the need is greatest. Sustainability means freedom - freedom from suffering for the artists, freedom from dependence and freedom for The Horse Hospital to move on and make a difference to the lives of the next million artists and donkeys imprisoned by suffering and ignorance.   You, too, can make a difference   The Horse Hospital relies greatly on being included in wills. Around half our voluntary income is received this way. If you know that, when the time comes and you no longer need your worldly wealth, a percentage of it has been safely promised to The Horse Hospital, then you also know that you can and you will really make a difference.   Tidy up the loose ends   Take the opportunity to put your life in order: review your position; count your blessings. Make a tally of your assets. Then think of your family, your friends and The Horse Hospital. With the help of experts, writing or reviewing your will is not a difficult exercise, yet is so important. Make it that much easier for those who follow you and leave a legacy of care, not confusion. This way, you can make a difference to your own environment and make a difference to the rest of the world.   Your sustaining gift   By including The Horse Hospital in your Will, you will be sustaining our projects well into this millennium. You will be helping us to bridge the gap between unnecessary suffering and misery and a healthy, more productive working life for millions of artists.   They give one hundred per cent. How much can you give?   Information and help   Legacies to charities come in different forms: you can leave all or part of your estate remaining after family and friends have been looked after (residue); you can leave a lump sum (best made inflation-proof) (pecuniary); you can leave specific items (real estate, jewellery, antiques, shares). Remember that charities are exempt from tax, so you can also reduce the tax burden on your estate.   If you would like more advice or help about making or changing your Will, please contact  James B.L. Hollands on ( 020 ) 7833 3644 popculture@btclick.com

       One part creativity, one part bitterness, one part stupid   The metallic taste of my own bitterness floods my mouth as I answer yet another email. "Here are the instructions," I type, "if you follow them, I will not spit in your hair." I can envision the bright-eyed face on the other end of the transaction biting her quivery, slobbery lip and pondering why on earth spitting in hair is part of the equation. I pity her, but not enough. Instead, I unroll a magic tornado from the depths of my cloak and lay waste to the homestead.

       Juxtapic 1-Take 2 (With a nod to fabulous Andy)  I am sitting in the passenger seat driving over the San Jacinto Mountains towards Temecula on a Sunday evening. Everything is black but I can smell dust in the air as my world turns to Fall. Johnny Cash is on  urlLink KCRW singing Depeche Mode's  Personal Jesus . Quick flash. I see a small church in the middle of nowhere. I pull over and go inside. The church is lit up in flourescent track lighting. The room is empty. A Goth boy stands in the corner in eyeliner wearing a Calico shirt. I look down at my knees that are being brushed by a red and white gingham dress. In a true Twin Peaks moment, a reverend walks into the room and sits down at a baby grand. He motions to a corner of the room where a table is laid with red cherry punch in Dixie cups. He starts to play "Someone to be your friend, someone who cares". I start to dance with the Goth boy, legs out, kicking up, hands over knees crossing back and forth. The fifties have blurred with the year 2002 and the Goth boy pulls me into the confessional for a game of truth and dare. "Pick up the receiver, I will make you a believer."

       Fishbowl reply to Bertie  Bertie, the scariest thing about the truth in your words about George Bush, is that most of Americans agree with you. These are the same Americans who profess to believe they live in a Democracy where their votes and voice actually count. So I hear you! You're freaked. How do you think we feel? Every night on the Jon Stewart Daily Show there is some clip of Bush saying something that in reality means "Saddam went after my daddy and I am here to get revenge." We are living under the rule of a man with a  personal vendetta and not much else. In the last election when America was basically split right down the middle and the vote went over in favor of Bush, I knew it was going to get worse before it got better. You don't have a schism that equal without having to take a hard look at the country you live within. Problem is, that no one in government is taking that look.

       Poems for all  The cool  24th Street Irregular Press  has been publishing miniature books of poems for years now and were recently written up in  Poets & Writers  magazine. Their mission statement, in their own words, about the poem books is this: "They're scattered around town-on buses, trains, cabs, in restrooms, bars, left along with the tip; stuffed into a stranger's back pocket.  Whatever.

       Rollins Radio  For those of you interested,  urlLink  Henry Rollins  is doing a show on Los Angeles talk radio station  urlLink  KFI  (AM 640 on the dial) on Sunday, October 13 between 4-7pm PST.  Don't know if it's a one-time thing or ongoing, but I guess that will depend on how many people tune in and how much he enjoys it. Thanks, Richard Box o Plenty of California, for this info.

       The little men in white coats running around my brain  I never go to seep b4 3 / 4 am...having dropped my sleeping pill -- I've done this for 6 years going on 35 now. Of late  I read  urlLink  The Journals of Denton Welch  waiting for the pill to kick in, for those little men in white coats to run around my brain  pulling down the shutters and....as I'm dropping off, lately, just on the tip of sleep, I jump out of bed, rush to the kitchen cupboard and reach for a Mars bar or a Snickers... this moring, a Kitkat and  a Snicker wrapper lay on the floor beside my bed.

       National ban your stereotypes day!   So, a few weeks ago Andy posted a  urlLink  Buzzwords  about A Russian Mail Order Bride website and I decided to go find out if all the hype about Russian women is true. Are they harsh but subservient, cold and greedy, detached and sexual? Well I found myself at a restaurant on Friday night drinking merlot with a particularly short, curvaceous, wild haired, and feisty Russian Jew, who I will call Natasha for the sake of flip flopping stereotypes out of a meaningless cycle and into non-perpetuation. She was funny and cynical and sexy as sin. She rolled her Rs everytime she said "Probably" which she said a lot.  She told me I was like strawberries with extra cream. She invited me to stay the night and we laughed until dawn listening to Russian pop music and talking about the politics of Israel and the cab drivers who will fuck anything in a skirt and I found myself feeling irritated by our collective conscious' pseudo-stereotype machine. The only thing machine-made "Russian" about this girl was the amazing syllabic accent and the fact that her mother had to unleash a queue of bribes to get her to the U.S.A. where she remains happy, feeling luckier than most U.S.A. residents do to be here, and works her days in a natural foods restaurant as she studies to be an international translator. I am declaring today NATIONAL BAN YOUR STEREOTYPES DAY in honor of Natasha, for like she said as the sun began to rise over a beautiful Californian Day: "Let me make this perfectly clear, it is now precisely 3 A.M."

       Hippie reflections   I was out tonight and found a copy of  Hair  on VHS for incredibly cheap and thought I'd watch it. It's hard not to get that creepy sense of then-and-now while watching a nation of innocent kids rush out to kill an enemy who retrospect has shown to not actually be the enemy. I think about all the talk these days of America invading Iraq, and I wonder just how many Viet Nams it's going to take.

The answer, brewing long before September 11th, was the threat of "international terror" -- sometimes described as Islamic Fundamentalism, sometimes as the Drug Cartels -- but in any event suitably nebulous and scary to justify the resurrection of priorities not seen since the Cold War" -- Fmr Sen Tom Hayden.

       My palette's running  A rainy Saturday evening in London town of old misery... I pop into interim art gallery owned by Maureen Paley in Bethnal Green... Little sketches of weeds. The upstairs gallery so overlit by neon I felt radiated. More delicate little weeds. I'd gone to meet someone who did'nt show. A Becks beer and three silk cut ultra later, I head back to my umbrella in the hallway weeping puddles of rain. As I'm leaving Tracy Emin comes thru the door, we exchange glances (we've meet at least 3 x b4) and oh I can't be bothered...I leave, get a bus home...Lit a joint and put on Bowie's  Diamond Dogs ...''Something kind of hit me today...I'm dancing where the dogs decay'.'

       We are scum   “I am told that today rather more than 60 per cent of the men who go to the universities go on a government grant.  This is a new class that has entered the scene.  It is the white-collar proletariat… They do not go to the university to acquire culture, but to get a job, and when they have got one, scamp it.  They have no manners and are woefully unable to deal with any social predicament.  Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public house and drink six beers.  They are mean, malicious and envious… They are scum.  They will in due course leave the university.  Some will doubtless sink back, perhaps with relief, into the modest class from which they emerged; some will take to drink, some to crime and go to prison.  Others will become schoolmasters and form the young, or journalists and mould public opinion.  A few will go into Parliament, become Cabinet ministers and rule the country.  I look upon myself as fortunate that I shall not live to see it.”  - Somerset Maugham,  Sunday Times,   1955

       Lefties with the decorators in...  Having just been informed by a close female friend that she doesn't want a    big night out tomorrow as she has 'fallen to the communists', it occurred to    me that you could reverse-engineer this analogy with great accuracy: the difference    between communists and anarchists has always been that socially most communists,    male or female, continually act like they're on the blob.

She's right in front of me!" S.J.Curtis did'nt believe me... but it was the legend of   Belle de Jour  and  Dancer in the Dark  smoking a cigarette, hiding nothing behind dark glasses.

       Fuck your heroes and fuck you too   urlLink Glen E. Friedman's  images of the early Dogtown skateboarders in the late 1970s and early 1980s along with the burgeoning hip-hop and punk rock scenes have made him one of the most important photographers today. With the uncanny ability to capture images of people whose subculture was about to change the world, his subjects range from Jay Adams and Tony Alva to Run DMC and the Beastie Boys to Minor Threat and Black Flag, among many others. Over the years, Friedman has been able to define the moments of the movements that defined an era. This has cemented his place in history as an uncompromising, extremely gifted artist.  Glen E. Friedman's  urlLink  Fuck You All   exhibition at  sixspace  highlights images from his first two books  Fuck You Heroes  and  Fuck You Too . The exhibition features nearly 35 original photographs (including seven never-before enlarged photographs) from 1976-1995 featuring images of a young LL Cool J, Ice-T, Run DMC, Bad Brains, Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys, Fugazi, Beastie Boys, Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Steve Olson, and more.  Fuck You All  continues through November 30th.  sixspace  549 West 23rd Street Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA 213.765.0248 Tuesday-Saturday from 12-6pm.

       The War on Terror   Good news, people. I was doing a little research and it turns out that "Terror" is actually an emotion. Therefore anyone who bothers to make others feel that emotion is "terrorizing" those people, which makes them "terrorists". That includes:      Student/Taxi Drivers     That loudmouth at the office     George Bush and his nazi prick regime raining electric death on the heads of anyone they please. I mean seriously, you expect me to believe that the Calgary Stampede is a bloody terrorist target? and that this stupid list of Canadian death traps only happened to appear a few days before they start calling on the Canadians to help out in the pending war in Iraq? Hey, George. Here's one Canadian who took time away from the back bacon and the hockey to pray an extra special prayer to God and REO Speedwagon that your genitals atrophy, because until that happens we can look forward to even more of your global pissing contests, you asshole     Stephen King (if only just)

       Dog days  ''Running with the dogs today'' (wild ones)...   Went to see  urlLink  Suede  in concert in London with James of   urlLink  The Horse Hospital  as my guest... it rained... Brett the singer looked slim and worked out. I'd seen the first tour in 1993 and then he was sweaty, plump and limp wristed. Tonight he was professional and suburban like Pop's   Abigail's party . James was certain that they were 'miming' to a backing tape. Brett, the singer, swished his hips a couple of times and skipped the really high notes...moments of thrill... the thrill of moments. Occasional dream. Pictures conjured...I'm off to Holland for 4 days.

       New Eurock and European experimental music book  The  urlLink  Eurock Book   is hot off the press and published by Archie Patterson/Eurock of Portland, USA.  This book looks stunning and is filled with 714 pages of cosmic prose.  The  Eurock Book  is an in depth history of Eurock, and the European experimental music scene along with coverage of progressive music from other non-Anglo and Eastern bloc countries.  Written on the fly as it happened, the  Eurock Book  is a living document of a culture in flux, with controls set full throttle into the heart of the future.

She returned. I could have gone to work. I did not. Clearly, this is some new and evil plot by these whoremongering terrorists to weaken the already shakey economy of the western democracies. Who will stop them? It's like they're everywhere, tied to everything, and capable of anything.

        The Meaning of Love    Platinum Eyelash:		  Hello again.  Starfishmilkshake:		 I knew you would come.  Platinum Eyelash:		 You gave me a ball of thread and asked me to run with it.  Starfishmilkshake:		 I am glad you did.  Platinum eyelash:	  That is very sweet of you to say.  I like the idea that we have started this perpetual conversation. It's like an object rather than a thing that stops and starts.  Starfishmilkshake:		 It's what I was telling you about.  Platinum Eyelash:		 Yes, you're right.  Starfishmilkshake:	 A conversation piece. You add, subtract, conjugate, contemplate, obfuscate, and hand over to the other for examination, analysis, re-fabrication, and re-transmittal.  Platinum Eyelash:	 Meld, wield, forge, manipulate, comprehend, consider, decipher, loll within, ping-pong, dissect, disintegrate, and renew.  Starfishmilkshake:		 And possible random confusion.  Platinum Eyelash:	 Everything is rehashed. Everything is deconstruction and reconstruction brought out anew under new lights with many costume changes.  Starfishmilkshake:	 Yeah, the blueprints are on a constantly moving spreadsheet like a seismograph.   Platinum Eyelash:	 	Richter scale.  Starfishmilkshake:		 And in 4D.  Platinum Eyelash:		 4D, yes!  Starfishmilkshake:		 I'm sure the Richter scale does come into it somewhere  Platinum Eyelash:	 That's the arguments part, the crest and trough and rolling waves and stormy seas and moon beams and cleansing rains.	  Starfishmilkshake:		 Yeah  Platinum Eyelash:	 And electrical wires, disconnecting and reconnecting, two water droplets and a third dropped within the middle to connect the whole.	  Starfishmilkshake:		 Oooh, a chain reaction. I like the water drop analogy.  Platinum Eyelash:	 Chain reactions, domino effects, wonder twin powers activate.  Starfishmilkshake:		 Do you believe good overcomes all? . . . . .   Platinum Eyelash:	 Hello again.  Starfishmilkshake:		 What is love?   Platinum Eyelash:		 The selling and buying kind?  Starfishmilkshake:		 No, the kind that starts pure before the jading.   Platinum Eyelash:	 Oh, I haven't met that kind.  Starfishmilkshake:		 I am trying to figure out if it even exists?   Platinum Eyelash:	 It doesn't exist. But there are three million variations on trying.   Starfishmilkshake:	 No, but I think it DOES exist.  Platinum Eyelash:	Is THIS love?   Starfishmilkshake:	 	You and me love? Is that where you are going?  Platinum Eyelash:	 Yes.   Starfishmilkshake:	 Yeah, I think so. A discombobulated population would think so.   Platinum Eyelash:		 This is anonymous love.   Starfishmilkshake:		 The best kind, no?  Platinum Eyelash:		 The safest, yes.   Starfishmilkshake:		 Where are the thorns here? Or are there truly none?   Platinum Eyelash:	 The thorns come in the day. In normal life. In those moments I think of you for two seconds and realize you are only partially real and that I am better off for only having half of truth than all of it. 	  Starfishmilkshake:	 I think all of truth is here.  Platinum Eyelash:	 The rest of them have it wrong.	  Starfishmilkshake:		 Sure, I will raise my glass to that.  Platinum Eyelash:	 Here's to knowing nothing.  Starfishmilkshake:		 Here's to you over there and me over here.   Platinum Eyelash: 		 The people out there are getting restless.  Starfish milkshake:	 It is a top-secret mission to rule the world.

       Softer than a brownfield in an industrial city  Each morning I pass your office with the intent to start a pot of decaf coffee and fill-up my cup with bottled water near the company's mail slots. The smokers outside the door are laughing. In the basement, someone has taken an early lunch in an attempt to forget the day ahead of  them.  Up the steps, the stairs creak as she discusses marketing strategy.  I am told that we are not close to securing funding for our  project.  Perhaps our jobs are in jeopardy?

       The Bohemians of the Northern Quarter  When I discovered the bohemians of the Northern Quarter I thought my luck was finally in. They sat on austere cushions, dressed in corduroy, clearly stoned in the browning gloom. They laughed, alienating those around them. Here I was: bohemian and yet not at home with the bohemians. They didn’t reject me, but advised me to try new, as-yet-unheard-of R n B areas, which didn’t really grab me. So I departed, a wandering bohemian, exiled from his own kind, ambling blithely toward the common ground... and somewhere in the middle of the city, she turned to me and said: “Tell me; why do architects so frequently dream of towering staircases?” She had such an unusual turn of phrase. These were words I had never heard before, certainly never in such a compelling sequence. The sun glistened against the ruddy skin of my face. City life was immediately multiplying our options, I realised. (At a private party, I dropped to my knees uninvited and died a little on the inside. Nobody noticed. So I got back up again and acted like nothing had happened.) One more thing about city life: it drifts in and out of focus. Time moves too fast in the city, ageing things like never before. Was this how city life always flourished? we wondered, somewhere between the borderline of waking and sleeping. Will city life always enjoy such a redolent ebb and flow?

        Blue Monday   Having been diagnosed with a peculiar roller coaster disease, she sits surrounded by the sounds of the perfect morose triangle: Saint Etienne, The Smiths, the latest Sleater Kinney. She stares at her desk, at the picture of her rose colored daughter, the wooden mannequin with the flexible limbs that looks as if it is jumping with mad joy off of a cubist wooden cliff, the trophy presented to her by the drag queens in town, and the small Buddha offering up business cards to anyone who wants to hire a woman gone mad, on the verge of a balancing act, on the tip of of a tongue, a quiver....

       The General  The General personally oversees the torture and persecution of all potential opponents with a great pride and exacting attention to detail. The General doesn’t exactly get involved himself, though; he has henchmen who do that sort of thing for him. However, the General is always quick to lavish praise upon any notable new rival: “That way,” he observes, “the  schmucks  don’t suspect you of being up to anything...” In the War Room, he plots their downfalls, one by one, all by himself. Some he sets up via convoluted honey traps. Some he pays off with sacks of cash. Others he quietly bundles into the back of unmarked limousines, never to be heard of again. After their deaths and disappearances and resignations, the General issues six-page statements of sympathy in the press. At their funerals, the General recites Christina Rossetti and expels real tears which have artificially generated for him by casual interns.

       Day After Christmas (north of the border)   ...and I am wondering where the hell my white Christmas went? Living on the Canadian prairies, and the only white was a little hoar frost on the grass. I've just read Kurt's Journals and feel like I should probably do a better job of keeping a copy of what I write. I got a chain letter about the quarter-life crisis that I think I wrote, but can't be sure. Sort of a creepy feeling. Spent Christmas with family. Didn't eat the big dinner because I felt green and well-worn. Postcard? Donde esta?

       A Canadian Response to Joni Mitchell   I find it horrible that you English (and indeed all Europeans) can condemn a talentless hack such as Joni Mitchell, who used to live down the street from my high school choir teacher when he was a wee laddie, while at the same time accepting and encouraging Bryan Adams. Yes, Joni is a pox. Yes, Joni is the sign of an oppresive regime of total and complete evil. But the truth is that you people encourage this. Joni Mitchell doesn't get radio play in Canada. If it were up to Canadians, Joni Mitchell wouldn't even own a radio here. But your weird-ass welfare programs and musician assistanceships keep tragedies like Cindy Lauper or Bryan Adams alive and waking up the neighbors. And now that I think about it, you people excreted so much pain on the west through the visages of the Spice Girls, Elton John, and the Beatles (oh hush now) that I cannot feel badly for our retaliatory ways.  But I am sorry about that whole Rush thing.

       First Thoughts On City Life  Finally, we entered the city... escaping through the rain... aided by a large umbrella, two Germanic artists, the BBC, an affable fashion model from Barcelona... behind us, a land without loving. We crawled smiling out of the wreckage. A wonderfully moment. Like Velaquex returning to Spain in 1651. The kudos was immense. Crowds gathered, curious at our arrival, every last man, dwarf and baboon of the city cheering us on. The streets rapidly filled with Sports Personalities. They eyed us lovingly from top to toe. Immediately, I felt empowered; like God, holding a revolver. The air was heavy with acoustic Leonard Cohen cover versions, sung admirably. There seemed no better place in the universe to be...

       Revenge  Every year on a rainy day in December I am obligated to go to a fashion show for the Catholic School I was forced to go through as a child. Along with my wine-drinking wise-cracking mother, my bitchy St. John knit wearing Aunt, and my sophisticated-ly insane Jewish grandmother from New York, I get to submit myself to four hours of clothes I would never wear pranced around on models i would never fuck all in the name of carrying on a family tradition. This year I have decided to have a little fun. I am going to arrive in a shirt made out of my deconstructed catholic school uniform in the name of lustful sacrilege and I am going to wear three crosses in my ears to remind the nuns of the little ear piercing shop I sed to set up in their bathrooms. My favorite parts of days like these, are watching the male teachers cringe when they see me and remember all the debates I created to partake in with them and then watching the realization sweep over their faces that as as a hedonistic non-conformist, I am not burning in hell but am actually quite successful. Hee Hee.   As the resident 3 AM mush, I want to throw out some love to all you beautiful co-editor men and sexy Utahna. Wasco you are brilliant. Bertie you're magnificently nuts. Howie Wowie. Jim thank god we have you to yank our helium filled chains every so often. G you're cute. Andrew you are magical. Everyone else have a great holiday season. I only get this mushy a few times a year.

       From  Secrets of the British Motorway System  by PK Young  Some narrow streets from my youth. Near me: a group of boys in a frantically small park, playing football. Seven identical boys like cloned brothers: jet black hair, every one of them. They see me, send the ball in my direction. I try to kick it back, but can't. Because my feet don't seem to work the way they used to. I miscontrol, misdirect, miscalculate the kick: hitting the ball too hard, hitting it way past them, straight over their fuzzy heads.       I apologize.      To them and to myself.      I feel stupid.   I walk on: one of the boys joining me, walking with me. He reminds me of myself: when I was a kid, not as I am now. I tell him how I used to play football when I was his age. I tell him some old stories. He seems unimpressed. We walk on, talking ourselves into the city: the gray, urban apex of under-age peep shows, 24 hour brothels, family-orientated strip joints.

       Color Coded Puffs of Wheat   Okay, I'll tell you how to post with color, but you have to promise not to get all transcendental psychedlia on me... Too much color looks like you've thrown Dame Edna at rotating knives... So if you're going to abuse this gift I give (as humans tend to) then just stop reading right now... You stopped? Okay, I'll go on. All you have to do is put in a font tag. You can get creative if you like. For example, you could simply turn the font a  dark green  (&lt;font color=#008800&gt;) or you could specify that you wanted your font to appear  like this  (&lt;font style="font-family:comic sans ms, comic sans, verdana;font-size:18px;background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff"&gt; The key is that you MAKE SURE TO CLOSE YOUR FONT TAG! In other words, after you have the text you want colored finished, you have to include a &lt;/font&gt; or the rest of the page is going to be the same color and I'll have to start hating you.

       Nay, a roll in the nay  Well I'm just bewildered that the horse thing has galloped away, I just don't know where to but... of course froggy gallix eats horses and I've fallen off many a 'pony'...as the boy looked at Johnny but the movie kept moving as planned, he pressed him against the locker and he drove it home drove deep in Bertie... who was laughing hysterically... and the waves came lapping in like sea horses and the scream he made was soooooooooooooooo high pitched....  Bertie channeling Patti Smith in the middle of the night trying to get a flight to nyc without a credit card .....

       Praying for rain  Jim's rubberband mind, in one lurching step, goes from the Rolling Stones to small pox. Dizzying.  By the way, how come some of you guys get cool colours for your postings ? Did I miss an important course on how to use Joe Bloggs? The universe can be so unfair sometimes.   PS: note that I didn't mention horses in this particular posting.  PS2: cheer up Kim! there's so many snails to slowly crush under your soles! Ain't that exciting? Ain't that a dainty noise? a tiny creeeekk followed by a still feebler squashing sound...pray for rain!

       Terror Vaccine   I watched a show last night about the whole small pox vaccinations thing, and it really got me thinking. I just wanted to take a moment to formally thank the leaders of our world. You see, the show kept telling us how we had eradicated small pox, but some of it still existed in freezers and had ultimately found its way (read: got sold on the hush hush) into the hands of terrorists for their weapons of mass gonnafuckyouupness. Why was it that we felt the need to keep the most deadly virus known to man in freezers? Wouldn't it have made sense given that we had eradicated a plague to simply destroy what we had? No more small pox means no more small pox. That's easy math. So why didn't we? Could it be because we also recognized the awesome power of using it on our enemies? That we knew that if the right circumstances presented themselves, our best defence might be a biological response in a quarantinable environment? They say that the Israeli army are all vaccinating against small pox. Can you imagine if their intent was to barricade cities in the disputed territories and infect the people therein with small pox, and then blame the victims for having their biological warfare bombs just sort of go off by accident? It's way too early for this sort of thing, but I can't help thinking about it. My wife and I were talking about it last night, and she asked if we weren't just paranoid. My response? We might be, and it pisses me off that I live in a world where I have to be. But I do, and I can't honestly trust the people we elect to protect our interests to not be lying to us and selling those interests short as they play the Grander Scale game.

       GG up  I was standing in the street with seven other guys, four of whom I had never seen before, and waiting for the moment to come. We had been told the priceless mummy would be stolen from the British Museum at 6, that it would be taken out hidden in a laundry van, before being transferred to a four-horse, nineteenth-century hearse. I knew it was a stupid idea, but the organiser of the job was the grandson of London's last successful operator of horse-driven hearse services, and he was a superstitious bloke. He was a plain junkie too. The hearse had been gathering dust in a dockside shed for the last 50 years.  The furry suits were bundled at our feet now, and it was freezing cold. The wooden hearse had been parked against an iron fence surrounding a small garden, and from the narrow, piss-reeking passage where we stood hidden, we could see passers-by casting curious glances at the vehicle.  Who would look for a mummy in a hearse? Insane bit of reasoning. How insane we had learnt when we found out that there were no black horses to be found for hire in London that week. So Tommy, the undertaker's grandson, had rung up a friend who worked in a circus and managed to procure four horse suits. Two men per suit, one in front, one in the back.  We heard the screeching tires of the laundry van before we saw it. It came to an abrupt stop behind the hearse. Three guys, including Tommy, opened the doors of the van and transferred a pine coffin into the hearse. All the while Tommy's eyes looked for us. He sneezed violently.  This was our cue. We all bent double and started to wiggle into our horse suits. Fortunately, I was one of the front guys. We then trotted straight for the hearse, stumbling every two steps, and we took our place in front of the ramshackle vehicle. we could not see much of what was going on behind us, but we supposed we were being harnessed to the hearse. After a minute or two, I heard the engine's van, being turned on in my back, and presently I heard the mad laughter of Tommy, as the van roared away. When I tried to turn around to see what was going on, I realized we had been tied to the fence. I stretched my neck as far to one side as I could and caught a glance of the van, with the hearse in tow, turning a corner at the end of the street at full speed. There were only the 8 of us left, in our four horse suits, tied to the fucking brass rails. Thinking how we could get away from the situation without loosing too much face, I raised my eyes to look around if anybody in the surrounding buildings was watching us through their windows.   And that's when I saw Bertie's sleep-puffed face, an incredulous look on his face.

       Darkness   I woke up this morning to darkness. We're only getting about 7 or 8 hours of light this time of year, and they usually happen while I am at work. There was no coyote howl to greet me, no horses lashed to the neighbor's condominium. It was quiet, except for the roar of a few sirens and the steady, antimelodic churn of the traffic on the road in front of my house. Still, I managed to grab some breakfast on my patio (something that the temperature during winter would normally preclude, but thanks to global warming it's barely freezing) and stare across the lifeless treetops to the giant glass hardon that some call downtown. Much like a real penis, when seen from a distance it actually looks pretty beautiful. From where I sit it's all glass and mystery. In an hour, as I ride the bus to work, the definition will come more and more until I can see the homeless, can see the dirt, can see the terrible monsters of industry lurking in their sport utility vehicles. But for now, it's a pretty moment and one worth savoring.

       Industry shits this town  I woke up this morning and peaked through my plastic blinds at the snow on my neighbor's roof.  She has the heat on low.  She picks through garbage.  After sloshing through the grey slush, I navigate my subcompact car through potholes and bad roads.  Coolies in the Hough give me the fuck you look.  Read your history, this neighborhood was burning during the riots of the 1960s.  Look mates, I'm simply headed to work, I think.  My throat is scratchy.    Holly Golightly is in my player and I understand her when she sings, "I can't be trusted."

       Pink Skies  Through the slats in my blinds this morning, woke up to a startling pink sky--a perk of desert living. As if on fire in a surreal world, I was inspired to then buy a blue and silver tinsel tree in a small art store after a lunch of curry chicken with one of my editors. Instead of seeing horses down the street, I was startled on my way to work by a howling coyote on the road, looking like his hangover from the night before had him scouring the city streets for a random school child for breakfast. Nowhere is there snow.

       Congratulations!   Congratulations on your purchase of an authentic French guillotine! We know that whether it's simply held as a conversation piece or as an active part of your new lifestyle, you'll find that nothing seems quite the same after this purchase. There are a few notes one should keep in mind as the owner of such a magnificent piece of history. First of all, it is of dreadful import to keep the mechanism working and the blade razor sharp. Authenticity is authenticity, after all, and what would they have said if the blade had fallen on some toxically inbred monarchist and simply left a really mean bump? The second thing to consider along with the physical maintenance of the guillotine is your own familiarity with the object. It wouldn't do to be fumbling about at a party trying to get the stupid blade to drop down and cut a pineapple for punch. We recommend that you keep your skills as sharp as the blade and as well oiled as the machine. Easy ways to do this include practicing on fruit, newspapers, lumber, or homeless persons. The last point we would like to make before leaving you to get acquainted with your authentic French guillotine is the need for safety. Keep your children a safe distance from the guillotine (so long as it isn't a piece being bought for disciplinarian reasons), and always make sure that nobody puts an arm through that they do not want to lose in the first place. Enjoy your authentic French guillotine!

       The little boy, the car & the oven  Okay you take a screwdriver and a hammer and you dip them in flour, and then you take a short vacation, and then back. At this point, nothing should have happened to the original axis of the earth BUT many centuries of cell-existence will have potentially developed in the inner Holy of Holies of those molecular fortresses scattered about your internal meaty organisation. Which speaks a lot for tidiness of mind in times of national hazards. This means that:  The sky being greyish white, and my woollen jumper three sizes too large and the screwdriver and hammer being now -- supposedly -- at room temperature, it is perhaps, I say perhaps as a kind of gentle invitation, a hardly perceivable intimation that this is probably the right course of action to take, then, perhaps as I just wrote, you can take the whole insane project to its next infamous step: write a Christmas wish list to your banker.   The other day my 2 1/2 year old nephew put his plastic toy car in the microwave oven, and turned it on. No one was hurt, except the car and the oven. The firemen had a laugh, my sister didn't. Question: who do we sue: the little boy, the manufacturer of the oven or that of the car?

       Stars & gutters  Went to see NYC punk band 'star spangles'  at a pisshole on oxford street -- little NYC boys reminding me to remember they were kind of NY DOLLS, Iggy - the front man (boychild) a bit Nick cave etc.... everything reminded me of someone else... but there were many pretty boys in the audience with 'haircuts'... skinny kids drunk and in black but not quite goth....not quite anything... sexless dollies...skin yet to be corrupted by smack and beer? On the way home, a young boy beggar asked me to smile.. I did and had a chat. All I had was a pound left which I gave to him and he said 'god bless' which was fucking heartbreaking I can tell you...We chatted about drugs and he rolled up his sleeves to reveal no track marks...messy blond hair and starry green eyes ( I wish I had my digi cam) where was he sleeping tonight? Right there on the sidewalk... As I walked away I wish I'd have given all my money = five quid total...I wish I could give him the world actually.......

       Too many thugs in KFC  Late afternoon, split from work at 4pm and caught the bus to Ladywell... changed there for a P4 to Brixton, absolutely crowded, no seats.  Arrived at Brixton too early, had to browse in a second hand book shop (made mental note to return, huge stock) then in a novelty shop - was amused by Sigmund Freud action figures ("ideal present").  Went to The Fridge and interviewed Andy Czezowski and Susan Carrington for  3AM , talked for hours and run out of paper, some good lines to hang the piece on.  Left but desperate for toilet, too many thugs in KFC and McDonalds so had to buy a pint.  Mad old lady comes into pub and does a circuit of the tables, she reminds me of a female version of the black janitor in the club in   A Confederacy of Dunces   but is thrown out by over-zealous security guard.  Long bus journey back on P4, pop into Fox and Firkin in Ladywell to see if anyone I know is in, it's dead bar the winos, one starts on me for my "Irish accent", leave and buy a cereal bar on way home.  Finish Houellebecq's   Atomised   on the bus, impressed at moral narrative.  Key in the door, but the phone rings, invited to Oxford Circus to celebrate friend's new job.  Can't be arsed, have one of my own to go to in the morning.

       Underbelly Nation  Last night on the Daily Show, Jon Stewart interviewed the female editor of the magazine The Nation. She spoke of a growing demographic in America that is non-republican, non-democratic, non-voter that is showing up as a subscriber and contributor base to her magazine. She reminded us that our country is not split down the middle ideologically by the two party tallies. She reminded us that her magazine's subscription and contributor base has been progressively rising. This large group of un-accounted for Americans represent humanist, progressive, liberal-minded, conscientious, culturally creative, and multicultural thought. This voice can be found in periodicals like Utne Reader, The Nation, and other progressive-minded vehicles but has been largely quiet and unsuccessful within the five major media conglomerates and the political machine. These channels are few but deserve support. I think everyone should subscribe to the Nation and boycott their t.v.s. How do we infiltrate mainstream media if we are such a large un-heard group? Do we even want to? How do we take these numbers and have them add up to actual action rather than just positive rhetoric? We've always had the internet to create this thriving arena, although how loud will our voices be if the Homeland Security bills go through towards monitoring our moves and gaining political sentience on our sentiments? These are strange days indeed.

       Scenes from a Maul   Waking up this morning thinking about the news last night when they talked about global warming. Most people laugh, and say that it's nice to have the warmer winters. Sort of reminds me of bread and circuses. Outside, the ground has a light powdered sugar dusting of snow, the first we've had in Calgary to last more than a day or two, and the news man sayeth it's going to fade this weekend. Waiting in line yesterday I saw a lady complaining about how cold it was and I laughed and told her it was nothing. She kept blathering on, and I had to sympathize with all the farmers who are hoping we get enough snow to carry a crop next year. It seems that global warming really means more bitching, less food, and a brown Christmas.

Wanting to start a work free revolution, reading about cultural creatives, pissed and miffed in America, wanting a hand to hold, wishing it would rain, sitting in a box, completely lost at the moment.

       Playing Hooky  Listening to the sounds of garbage trucks outside, dogs yapping across the street, my computer whirring, and a silent world. Reading the Los Angeles times peppered with quips from Bush's depressing State of the Union address last night. Frequenting the kitchen where my girl on canvas awaits her second coat of pink red hair. Watching the cactus outside sit perfectly still. Flipping through the hot pink catalog for this weekend's Art of Punk show at the Kantor gallery. Wearing a big grey man's shirt spatterd with yellow paint and fuzzy slippers crocheted by mom. Adoring the loneliness. Drinking ice water. Eating ginger chips.

      OLD PERVS. GAWD! what is it with certain British men in their 50's and in show/music biz...that can't leave kiddie porn alone? Pete Townsend's Rock Opera 'Tommy' takes on new meanings...'' Tommy can you see me? Tommy can you FEEELLLLLLLLL me?''...and really that scene with Keith Moon and Paul Nicholas drooling over Roger Daltrey in a school boys uniform, singing  '' Fiddling about, we're fiddling about''....

        Listening...  to Neko Case sing about Big Red Bells, wanting to crawl under her van with her, croon the blues over some deep red merlot, fall asleep in the sawdust of some dim town, away from it all. Reading Alan Dershowitz's rant in the Boston Review, creaming over Professor Richard Florida and his global views, going to the gym to kill my thighs surrounded by buff gay men in a curious safety meat market zone. Everything is dull compared to the kiss Franco Zefferelli gave me last week at lunch, surrounded by watered down media and high gloss tales of con men and the people who run after them. Wearing paisley and velvet, as velvet is the only thing that can consistently get me wet. Adoring a spinach souffle. Drinking purified water. Eating candied ginger chips.

      So I'm reading Keith Haring's diaries, and he talks about the Jean Tingueley sculpture ' Requiem for A Dead Leaf ' and how it's the closest representation of a recurring dream he's had since childhood of unfathomable huge whirring noise, a small child and a daisy. You had that dream too, Keith? It remains one of my earliest memories and nightmares, and the thought that it infects other people horrifies me.  I spend a sleepless night, go to the shop to get cigarrettes and the counter man hands me change in the shape of a five pound note which has 'James' handwritten on both sides of it. I love the fact that meaning is contingent.

      RED RIP OFF... still spinning from my  recent nyc trip and heading back there in less than a month..reading KATHY ACKER'S first novel (1973) published by Grove Press (2002) ''Rip off red, girl dectective'' is her best, gamey but coherent, sexy with delicious snatches(sic pun) of prose....also her selected works ESSENTIAL ACKER - bits from her novels make more sense in snippet form....there was no writer doing what she was doing in the 1970's, cut and paste, slash and void...

       The Forthcoming War  “The forthcoming war will be radically different in tone to any previous ones. Everybody will sit down on Perspex chairs and discuss the vernacular of the forthcoming war days and weeks in advance. The forthcoming war will alter many people’s perceptions of what a war can achieve. It will be a friendly war. A war with scruples. Nobody will disagree about the forthcoming war. Small children will even laugh about the forthcoming war. They are already selling themselves to fund the forthcoming war. The forthcoming war will put smiles back on innocent faces. The forthcoming war will be great entertainment value for all involved in it. Nobody will be injured in the forthcoming war. The forthcoming war will do nothing but good for all concerned...”

       Imagine The Excitement   Kids! At the end of this broadcast, you're going to want to rush to your parents and tell them all the wonders you have heard! They will be so proud, so spiritually uplifted to see how grown up you are becoming that they will no doubt increase your allowance! As of today, a small but important piece of US legislation was passed which allows all children under the age of 18 to sign a pledge sheet guaranteeing their future enrollment in your choice of the army, navy, air force, or marine corps. Imagine being the first at your school to proudly display a Semper Fi tattoo! The other children will be so green with envy that they will double over and vomit patriotism at your feet! For a simple commitment of four years to help us stock our new perpetual war you too can be th envy of all that is seen, known, and loved in the world! This offer isn't valid if you are queer or sissy, but they would have stopped reading the ad ages ago. Go now, kids! Go tell your parents that you want to be one of the few who stood tall in the face of terrorist threats to come, whether they be from such aggressive nation-states as Iraq! Canada! Ireland! Puerto Rico! Why, you'll have all the fun of playing guns but with live rounds! Think of all you'll see and all you'll get to kill! George W. Bush will be so proud of you.

       The Morrissey Exhibition  The Morrissey Exhibition arrives in Manchester today midway through its tour of 147 countries. Consisting primarily of over 35,000 Morrissey-related items, exhibits will include Morrissey’s entire back catalogue played in reverse, Sonny Liston, a recently restored childhood trowel, and Gilbert O’Sullivan’s monogrammed golfball collection, as well as rare polaroids of Morrissey riding a bicycle (1964), contacting the dead (1988), and looking aggrieved at the site of the Peterloo Massacre, date unknown. The usual celebrity guests will appear: Leo Sayer performing “November Spawned A Monster” semi-acoustic (Monday), Germaine Greer in a tutu (Wednesday), and David Bowie, scheduled to appear on one knee, weakly grasping a tulip (Friday afternoon). Plus a short guided tour of Morrissey’s subconscious (Saturdays only). Morrissey himself will not be in attendance. Attractive women and excitement will frequent the exhibition on his behalf.

       Dear Mr Jim Martin,   I don't know what to do. My pet raccoon, Gertrude-Rose, has taken up again her repulsive habit of dropping Cuban-cigar ashes onto my genuine 17th century French rug, which incidentally pictures an alcoholic knight and a cherry tree in the very act. Threats to discontinue Gertrude-Rose's subscription to the Rock Paper Scissors channel, appeals to her sense of the importance of preserving our cultural heritage, especially in our county, where the chief industrial production is Swiss cheese's holes, have remained fruitless. I often find myself having nightmares featuring David Hasselof and lifeboats made of blue, rotten bananas singing hypocritical songs of praise to the Lord. This, my shrink has told me, is evidently a direct consequence of the strain. Also I have bad breath. Can you help?   Many thanks from,    Otto Martinet,  Lamotte-Beuvron,  France.   PS: Tink, you rock.

       Iris  By now Iris had developed an almost pathological disregard for tidiness and personal hygiene, eventually being admitted to a 4-star asylum, somewhat like a seaside spa resort, where they reprogram outgoing women into wholesome single mothers via electro-shock treatment. Here she declared an attraction for her ballet teacher and was caught masturbating in the gymnasium. Various treatments were prescribed: insulin, morphine, belladonna, potassium bromide, horse serum, the occasional elephant tranquilliser, which only conspired to induce acute memory loss and crippling weight gain. In due course she flipped her wig completely, re-inverting over twenty-seven years of social programming in the process. There would be no short-circuiting her Neanderthal DNA. She proved immune to injections of bohemian anti-bodies and reverted to type. Soon after, she cut off her hair and drove away to join the Bloomsbury movement where she could do no wrong. I owed her a lot; money mostly. When last I heard of her, she had formed a group of travelling musicians and dressed as a mermaid, occasionally sounding a conch shell astride the back of a gigantic inflatable dolphin...

       Bitter Old Man   I don't know what I expect to happen on New Years, but it's always a bigger letdown than Christmas. There's a magic in the air all night of promise, potential rebirth, but the next morning the magic becomes plainly seen as the reason my mouth is dry and loud noises offend. Magic is for children, and New Years Day is a bad time to go taking stock of the situation. That said, at least it isn't  urlLink so bad  for me. I still have my health and the legions of adoring fans who seek nothing more than to gargle my man-essence in public.

       A TRINKET ON A MENU  Holy falafels, you are a fine middle eastern.  I am down with your d.j. and privy to all the new sounds.  My finger in the end of a tube is as tight as it gets here in Los Angeles.   Your green time-sheet says that you are sick, sick, sick.  Analysis is another reason to stop believing in any sort of redemption.  The poor man on the shitter off Sunset Boulevard  knows the value of a quarter to unlock doors in a city that protects itself. Razor blade wire all over Koreatown,  cutting into my vision draining liquids in an apartment complex full of Mexicans named Jesus.  What do you think about vacation time?  Your vacant eyes are dull and Griffith Park makes you sweat.  You  are sweeter than trail mix and sugared  dates and I want to tell you that our skin should be touching each other's skin; but I am shut tight and shuddered.  Mutter.   Cutter.  Clutter.  In a rut of huts  and outsiders and funny looks at Vegan Express near countless roads in California. Nobody, you tell me, rides the bus and a car-pool lane only needs two passengers in this place. -Matthew Wascovich 2/26/03

       An end to war   Thanks to visionaries like George Bush and General Franco, I have finally been made to understand that we can see an end to war in our lifetimes. All we need to do is kill everyone and everything that is opposed to our beliefs. We can succeed by making the world a homogenous mash of fearful agreement. When Daddy Bush read Baby Bush bedtime stories, do you think it was 1984? or maybe they just watched Deliverance and cuddled.

        urlLink DISASTODROME  takes place this weekend at  urlLink UCLA   David Thomas, the founder of Pere Ubu is organising a three-day festival of "voice and vision where the reputation of 18 avant-garage heroes will be collectively tested" at UCLA (February 21-23). Disastodrome! will include live performances by Pere Ubu, David Thomas and the Two Pale Boys, Frank Black, and The Kidney Brothers, as well as the first appearance in 27 years of the legendary Rocket From The Tombs and the American premiere of David Thomas' rogue opera, Mirror Man:   "Disastodrome! continues a series of events conceived as an antidote to datapanik. In 1976 David Thomas and John Thompson note that in a state of data overload all 'new' information will only serve as a sedative-like drug, a junkie culture becomes inevitable, dataflow can be the only social imperative, and that discrimination, or any other hinderance to dataflow, must become anathema. Dataflow Junkies pursue a highly ritualized course. A break in routine can lead to disaster... to datapanik! The symptoms of datapanik are easily recognized: doubt and fear of the moment. Is what I'm experiencing meaningful... enough? What will my friends say? Is everything okay? Disastodrome creates a space in which the ordinary citizen can be freed from that burden of anticipation haunting the data-junkie. Only Disastodrome can guarantee that nothing will go wrong. 'It's a mess!' The cry goes up. 'It's a disaster!' Oh no, my brothers, Disasto reassures us that everything is going absolutely according to plan. Relax. Let it wash over you."

       The Dismal Swamp  I found myself in a dismal swamp: a dismal, dismal swamp. As far as dismal, dismal swamps went, it wasn’t such a bad one. It wasn’t too deep or too turgid or too dismal. But it was still a swamp and it was still  somewhat  dismal. There was not much that I could do about it. It was only much later, after the forklift accident and everything which consequently followed as a consequence, that my life achieved some clarity, a certain clarity it had never achieved before. (NOTE. The emotional consequences of such accidents were first noticed back in 1865 when Dickens suffered severe post-traumatic stress disorder, following his infamous head-on bicycle collision with Thackery.)

       Hollywood Subplot  I married an elephant. She taught me how to love. I taught her how to live. In return, she allowed me to stay up late and watch Late-Night Sport, late at night: Brazilian Golf, Austrian Volleyball, Welsh Wrestling, Chinese Beach Billiards, Cornish Lady-Shaving, Pro-Celebrity Canadian Skittles, Mixed-Race German Bikini Bowels, Indoor US Introspection (“ Live from Reno ”). Then she contracted an unspecified terminal Hollywood illness. Leaves fell. You can probably guess the rest....

       The General  The General's battle plans invariably fail. "Nuts," curses the General to himself, after his latest setback. "Too many defeats. Too many scars that never heal. Every cause I fight rapidly turning into a lost one..."  Long after the battle is over, the General surveys the field, tours the wounded in a minibus, kisses the cheeks of a young limbless soldier: "I am not a trained doctor," the General tells him, "so may I suggest you consider acquiring some professional help with your injuries...?"  Tired of fighting, tired of losing, the General resigns in a fit of pique. Two hours later he's on the phone, demanding his old position back again. The next day he's making preparations for renewed hostilities: a fresh batch of air strikes, several innovative media attacks, one or two brand new strategies... "It is imperative that this mother fucking War Room be redecorated at once," he screams, slamming the receiver down...

       "After Happening Upon a Saved Postcard from a Rich Aunt, 24 March, 2003"  by Utahna Faith  Oh, edifice, your tiny tiles sparkle in the desert sun. Such a shade of blue, dreamy and electric, such a gold, such yellows. Your beauty stands through centuries, unscathed by war after war, battle after battle, years on years on decades on decades on centuries on centuries on millennia on millennia of sand scraping, rain lashing, lightning and fireballs and swords and bullets and curses and kisses and prayers. Edifice, are you trembling? What is time to you? What is your perspective, bathing in tears? Do you understand good and evil? Tell us what you know, tell us pure, give us your wisdom. Would the most powerful listen, if suddenly a building should talk? Goodbye, beauty. I'd wish you luck, but luck won't have it. Goodbye, ancient. Goodbye.   * * *

       Down the Dustpipe  In a special collaboration between Stephen Malkmus and the South Bank Centre, a two day event entitled  urlLink Down The Dustpipe  takes place on Friday April 18th and Saturday April 19th at the Royal Festival Hall. On each night Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks will be headlining a bill initiated by Stephen Malkmus himself and designed to present the weird and the wonderful, the eccentric and the extraordinary, reflecting the diversity of British music past and present.  Over the two nights a series of artists from different eras and idioms will be rubbing shoulders at the Royal Festival Hall. From experimental left-field punks Alternative TV, to undisputed folk legend Bert Jansch on the first night, from blues-prog legends, fronted by Tony McPhee, The Groundhogs to sixties folk chronicler Vashti Bunyan, performing here for the first time in over 30 years on the second night. Both evenings will be concluded by a performance from Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks with Graham Coxon making his first major public performance since leaving Blur on 18th, and Super Furry Animals in their first performance in over a year on 19th.  Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks will be playing a selection of material, old and new, but with a focus on their forthcoming lp, 'Pig Lib' released on Domino Recordings on March 17th. The evening shows will commence at 6.00pm and in addition to those taking place in the main hall, on Saturday April 19th, there will be pre and post concert performances on the RFH Ballroom in the main bar area, by Wizz Jones and Billy Childish & The Buff Medways respectively.

       urlLink Mike Watt & The Secondmen on tour  From  urlLink Watt :  this  urlLink tour  is the final shake-down run for the songs for the illness piece,  the secondman's middle stand  - me and the secondmen are going to record it here in pedro at karma stuido a month after we get done rolling through these gigs. it should be in the stores by october. tourwise, it's the second time around w/pete and the third time w/jer but this time we're bringing the hammond b-3 organ so you folks can hear it like it supposed to sound - no synth kludge proxy like last tour. jer will be pounding his same drum kit as before but w/beefed-up kickdrum pedals, courtesy of pete. unfortunately, pete again can't do the whole tour due to commitments here in pedro but he can do the first six weeks. starting w/the hamtramack gig, paul roessler (me and him used to have a keyboard/bass duet called crimony in the late 80s) will play pete's organ for the final fifteen gigs. thank you, paul. hell - thank you pete and jer too! I've been very blessed to play w/some righteous peeps all down the years and am most grateful. by having paul aboard, it'll be a sortasecondmen thing and not a completely different band like last time when tom came to our rescue.  last tour we did the first three tunes from my illness piece. this time we will do the whole thing. the piece concerns the hellride the  urlLink illness  took me on starting january 25, 2000 and lasted for many months including thirtyeight days of violent fever and vomiting, an infection growing inside me like a baby, almost dying, emergency surgery and long painful recovery. a favorite book of mine as a teenager, dante's  divine comedy  loosely parallels my piece cuz it was much on my mind during all this. of course, it read much different so many years later in my middle forties than it did as a boy but the same inspiring feelings I got to plumb what was really on my mind in those days made just as much sense to me now, if even more so. you must remember dante was in his forties when he wrote his epic. I've read many translations (dante wrote in his native italian, bucking the convention of that day to write in latin) but here's an iteresting prose version by a.s. kline of the the comedy. dante actually wrote his piece in a poetic form he invented called terza rima (tertiary rhyme: aba/bcb/cdc) - threes dominate throughout. how more fitting for a powertrio from pedro? I've been inspired to organize the music along similiar lines w/some sick sixs and builder fives/sevens too. of course, three squared is nine so... anyway, it's not all about numbers - that sickness took a lot from me so I thought I should be able to take something back in return.  what better day to start a tour than on  urlLink d. boon's  birthday (april first)? he is much on mind these days as I attempt to come to grips w/the current mood. many times I find myself thinking  what would d. boon say  or  what would d. boon do  when I see some of the insane things going down in the name of whatever. such an intense war for our minds, people! thank god I can still pedal my bike and pluck my bass - much respect for folks w/free enough thinking to let me and my guys roll through your towns and come play for you. it is very, very kind of you all and I thank you much. I promise to wrestle my fucking brains out on the bass to the best of my abilities - you cats (and my guys) deserve nothing less.

       Untitled States of America  During the bleeding time, everyone contributed.  Blood from the thinnest hearts  squeaked out tiny dots of it -  And from the muscled, gushed it  down to cement, across streets  Blinding do not walk reds.  Sloshed in boots and ran deep like mortar.  Bubbled on car roofs.  Stuck in sockets like a paste.  Gurgled by roots  until all Summer fell,  ended in dark gels at the curb,  was flattened into memory books  saved in the cellar,  shot up telephone poles  and splashed back into itself -  Got its own photo taken.  Went on the town.  Crossed back to rural in a flash.  Addressed itself as king,  Grew hands out of meters  and pressed them into use. -Jesse McGuinness

       The Sadness of Shopping Alone  Sadness bites hardest in supermarket aisles. Idling foolishly in disinfected supermarket aisles. Displaced somehow between the supermarket aisles. Angling for products that don't actually exist. My endless quest for lone male consumables. The difficulty of being untogether. The fear of leaving yourself behind. The sadness of shopping alone...  So strange; estranged.

       Rocket from the Tombs live  As some of you may know, as well and being part of Television and my own band, I have also joined a band called Rocket From The Tombs, or RFTT for short.  RFTT was a band out of Cleveland who included David Thomas (Pere Ubu), Cheetah Chrome (Deadboys), Craig Bell (Saucers) and Peter Laughtner.  They were responsible for getting Television to perform in Cleveland very early on, and they opened the show. (They also got in a big fight and broke up right after, and then all formed the other bands that they are better known for.) Unfortunately soon after, Peter Laughtner died, making a reunion difficult.  Sometime last year I was contacted to find out if I could join as guitarist to take Peter's place, and I said yes immediately. the music is somewhat like a cross between Alice Cooper & Led Zeppelin, with a big freaky Ozzy in front. We did one show earlier in Los Angeles.  At the rehearsals the band once again got in a big fight, with some bandmembers leaving the stage in a huff and others pouting, and I thought it might not get off the ground, but as showtime came around the band pulled together and ended up with standing ovations. (how, I will never know!).   Everybody had an almighty blast, and we all decided to do it some more (fights and all)  Rocket From The Tombs might soon be appearing in a town near you.   Confirmed dates are as follows:  Wed, June 4, Chicago, Abbey Pub Thu, June 5, Cleveland, Beachland Ballroom Fri, June 6, New York City, Village Underground Sat, June 7, New York City, Village Underground  As David Thomas has put it, "We like playing together but this is no reunion and the whole thing may blow apart at any moment so don't assume you can see it next year."  I concur.  You can read more about it at the  urlLink Ubu Projex  website.  May God bless, and good luck getting tickets to this one.  Peace, and Safety to you all.  Sincerely yours,  Richard Lloyd  PS  Television has 2 shows coming up in May in Madrid and Barcelona.

       Kim Gordon art show in NYC  From April 19 – May 18, 2003 PARTICIPANT INC will present STAIRWAY (IS IT MY BODY?) a solo exhibition of works by Kim Gordon. Based on a text written by the artist, this site-specific installation will incorporate recent and new works in painting, sculpture, video and sound. The text—one in an ongoing series of music revisionist artist’s books—addresses themes drawn from Gordon’s experience growing up in Los Angeles in the 70s: cars, hitch hiking, Charles Manson, rock music, and the intersection of modern and postmodern architecture. Somewhere in the desert canyons resided Joni Mitchell—the embodiment of “consistent total brilliance.” Her memories are aesthetic, like architecture. Using the particularities of L.A. architecture (wood and metal detailing, the colors of buildings, institutional murals) as catalysts for works, Gordon recalls the subtleties and obsessions of this formative moment.  PARTICIPANT INC is located at 95 Rivington Street, between Ludlow and Orchard Streets in the Lower East Side. Gallery hours: Wednesday-Sunday, 12-7pm.

       You Can Probably Guess My Trajectory  More by accident than design, I found myself in Stockholm. Death hung in the air like a light bulb. It was raining. It was night and winter and dark and raining and the streets thronged with badly dressed sports commentators, asking for directions. I walked through the dark streets, electing not to hop or skip or jump or sprint, but to walk. Finally, after walking for what seemed like minutes, I reached a broad square of shops and public houses, dimly illuminated by badly-maintained street lighting, into which many other streets converged also. The various quarters of the city were arranged around the square like working-class cake decorations. In the centre was a circular pool of water and in the middle, a small island. On the island stood a single tree, a magnolia. Next to the magnolia, stood a white-haired Irish man whistling  Mr. Bojangles  to himself. Seeing me loitering like a tourist, he spoke: "One day, my friend," he said, "your mouth will speak of remarkable things: unusual women and as-yet-unnamed psychological conditions."  Although I had no reason to doubt his words, I did not believe him.

      The Horse Hospital, London, presents the creme of new books in a series of launches during May and June : for invitations please contact  urlLink james@thehorsehospital.com    THURSDAY MAY 29TH – BOOK LAUNCH - 7.30pm   Martyn Waites : Born Under Punches    published by Simon & Schuster   In the company of the author  “One of the brightest stars in the British crime writing firmament “ John J. Connolly  Set in the author's native north east and centring on the miners' strike of 1984 - this tautly-plotted thriller follows the intertwined lives of five characters all linked in various ways to the strike. Moving seamlessly between 1984 and the present day, Born Under Punches reveals the strike's unforeseen and devastating repercussions - not only for those directly involved, but for future generations too.  Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Martyn Waites now lives in Essex. A former market trader; bar manager and stand-up comic, he is now a professional actor; a career he combines with writing.  Martyn is Writer in Residence at Huntercombe Young Offenders' Institution and author of MARY'S PRAYER,  LITTLE TRIGGERS,  & CANDLELAND   MONDAY JUNE 2ND – BOOK LAUNCH : 6.30pm   Iain Aitch : A Fête Worse Than Death – A journey through an English summer   Published by Headline Review    In the company of the author  A Fête Worse Than Death is a comical trip around England where Iain meets shin-kickers, crop circle makers, stag parties and a dog-bitten woman who asks him to marry her at Stonehenge. Iain witnesses the sailing of a Cornish pasty, plays cricket with trainspotters and gets all vitriolic about the horrors of Stratford Upon Avon. He also meets the very English Luftwaffe, visits both Pontin’s and Centerparcs and also attends more village fêtes than it is healthy for one man to do.  Come for the guess-the-weight-of-the-cake competition and stay for the human fruit machine. There will also be a short reading by Iain as well as bunting, books and music.  About the Author : Born in Margate, Kent to the sound of a ropey tape recording of the Bow Bells – as all good Margatonians are, Iain was christened on the Scenic Railway and later renounced his faith in the River Caves. He didn't like school, school didn't like him and he got out of town as soon as he could. And no, he never slept with Tracey Emin. Somehow the evil people at the dole office tricked him into working there. It took some years to realise that, despite vastly improved blackjack skills, the job wasn't suitable. Inventor of World Phone in Sick Day, Aitch became a writer and began organising an annual drunken rampage by 60-odd Santa Clauses. Iain still writes for a host of newspapers and magazines, still needs to tidy up his office and lives in London.   urlLink http://www.iainaitch.com    THURSDAY JUNE 5TH –BOOK LAUNCH - 6.30pm   The Air Loom Gang by Mike Jay    Transworld Publishers    In the company of the author  London, the 1790s. Europe has been turned upside down by the French Revolution and the bloody Terror that followed it. Plots, counterplots and conspiracies seem to be edging England into a disastrous war with France. Operating undercover across the city as a gang of revolutionary ‘terrorists’ armed with a machine unlike any the world has ever seen. They call it the Air Loom.  The Air Loom works by animal magnetism, sending invisible rays to control the minds of its victims, forcing thoughts into their heads and tormenting them with unbearable agonies if they resist. The gang has control of the minds of politicians and generals and is bent on plunging France and England into war. The only man aware of the Air Loom Gang and their diabolical machine is a tea merchant from Wales called James Tilly Matthews. But Matthews is a long-term resident of the Bethlem Royal Hospital – Bedlam.  The Air Loom Gang tells James Tilly Matthews’ remarkable true story. Incarcerated in the world’s most notorious madhouse, his delusions became celebrated as the most complex and bizarre ever recorded. He remains one of the most famous cases in psychiatric history - the first man to believe that his mind was being controlled by an ‘influencing machine’. But the truth of his case was even stranger than his doctors realized: many of the incredible conspiracies in which he claimed to have been involved were entirely real.  ‘I have never seen the logic of madness, of a particular delusion, presented so clearly and convincingly. The Air Loom Gang is a wonderful book to read, combining exceptional scholarship and psychological insight with deep empathy for the tormented but always gentle and dignified Matthews. And it is beautifully written, with all the drama, the rich characterization, the subtlety, of a fine novel.’ Oliver Sacks  About the author : Mike Jay is the author of The Air Loom Gang, Emperors of Dreams: Drugs in the Nineteenth Century, Blue Tide: The Search for Soma and Artificial Paradises: A Drugs Reader and editor of 1900: A Fin-de-Siècle Reader.    FRIDAY JUNE 6TH –BOOK LAUNCH - 6.30pm   Victims By Travis Jeppesen   Published by Akashic Press   In the company of the author  "Victims may by the most exciting first novel I've read in a decade or more. This is a brilliant, haunting, and, strangest of all, very funny novel."  -- Dennis Cooper, author of Frisk  Victims is a novel about the final days of a religious cult called The Overcomers. Like the infamous Heaven's Gate cult whose mass suicide gained world media attention in the 1990s, they are a small group of lost souls guided by the teachings of a charismatic leader, Martin Jones. The Overcomers go about their lives preparing for the cosmic event that will signal the end of their time on earth. Their struggles to reconcile their faith in Jones's teachings with the emotional ups and downs of their relationships, jobs, and interactions with the natural world form the subject of this exquisitely written and highly original novel.  Based on extensive research into the rhetoric of religious cults, Victims is a novel of ideas in the tradition of modernist works like Magic Mountain and The Plague. Twenty-three-year-old author Travis Jeppesen uses an episodic narrative, an elegantly direct style, and a quirky, sympathetic group of characters to ponder a question raised by Jones's teachings: If friendship and love are just systems to instill comfort in our lives, are all human interactions acts of manipulation?  Victims is set in a rural America of the imagination informed by classic American values -- and cleansed of the mundane distractions that characterize American culture. Travis Jeppesen has written a novel with a philosophical bravura rarely seen in the work of contemporary American writers.  About the author : Travis Jeppesen was born in Ft. Lauderdale in 1979. His fiction and cultural criticism have appeared in Book Forum, 3am Magazine, The Stranger, and other publications, and he is a contributing editor to Pavement Magazine. Victims is his first novel. Having resided in Charlotte, Seattle, New York, Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin, Jeppesen currently resides in an undisclosed Eastern European country.   THURSDAY JUNE 12TH BOOK LAUNCH - 6.30pm   Pamela Des Barres : I’M WITH THE BAND- Confessions of a Groupie    Helter Skelter Publishing  In the company of the author  Long overdue return to print for the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll - The definitive groupie memoir from the ultimate groupie. Frank and engaging memoir of affairs with Keith Moon, Noel Redding and Jim Morrison, travels with Led Zeppelin as Jimmy Page’s girlfriend, and friendships with Robert Plant, Gram Parsons – with whom she was particularly smitten, - and Frank Zappa.  Follow Miss Pamela’s adventures as she loses her virginity to a member of Steppenwolf, hangs out with Cynthia Plastercaster, enjoys close encounters with many members of the era’s rock aristocracy, founds the Zappa-esque all-girl group the G.T.O.s, tours with Led Zeppelin - Jimmy Page had “dark chilling powers” and kept whips in his suitcase – babysits Zappa’s kids, lives with Don Johnson and somehow survives.   “Miss Pamela, the most beautiful and famous of the groupies. Her memoir of her life with rock stars is funny, bittersweet, and tender-hearted.”  Stephen Davis, author of Hammer of the Gods   THE HORSE HOSPITAL COLONNADE BLOOMSBURY LONDON WC1N 1HX 020 7833 3644   urlLink popculture@thehorsehospital.com   urlLink www.thehorsehospital.com   Media it say :  " London's premiere underground and avant-garde centre. "   ( luxnewswire, May 2003 )   " The current home of London's avant-garde. "  ( Iain Aitch, London Evening Standard, 2002 )   " London’s most innovative test site for experimental film presentation. "  ( Ian White, Whitechapel and Tate curator. )   " One of London's finest venues; if you're ever in London it should be added to your must-see list. "  ( http://www.compulsiononline.com )   " where you find fresh expressions reaching for the sublime "   ( The Guardian Website, Feb 2002 )   " The showcase for the finest minds of its generation "   ( Res magazine, Toronto, 2003 )   " Modernidad extrema anclada en un marco antiguo. . El Hospital de Caballos se construyó en 1797. A mediados del siglo 19 se reformó y se declaró edificio protegido. Desde entonces conserva su arquitectura. Nada cambió salvo que ya no da cobijo a carruajes y caballos. Sin embargo los inquilinos de entonces siguen estando presentes. Pero también es esta locura la que hace posible lugares como el Hospital de Caballos. Donde no existe la censura de lo políticamente correcto. Donde rige la idea de que sólo traspasando normas y gustos establecidos puede nacer algo realmente innovador. "  ( No Solo Musica, Spain, 2002 )   " The diversity of films is immense - from pure abstract formal expression to hard-core, queer/dyke porn. kinoKULTURE started in 1996 and now has a large fan-base. Artists and writers are encouraged to select and present their film choice, frequently coinciding with exhibitions. Recent hosts have included Jack Sargeant, who wrote the cult movie books : Deathtripping - Cinema of Transgression, and Naked Lens - Beat Cinema, offering a rare opportunity to see controversial underground shorts from New York (1980s) and Chicago (1990s). Also performance artist Franko B., presenting favoured new British and Canadian work alongside hilarious gay porn from Denmark. Horse Hospital screenings recall the recently demolished and sorely missed London Film Makers Coop (LFMC) in Camden, and kinoKULTURE has gained official approval from the British Film Institute (BFI) in the past. "  ( Chris Barber, QX magazine, 2002 )   "The Horse Hospital is infinitely cooler because it comes from an organic mind-set and doesn't concern itself with any cosmetic bullshit," says Payne. "It doesn't give a f***, it just shows what it wants. Not like the ICA. For example, it would never dream of showing some sh**ty films and then getting Talvin Singh to bang a couple of tablas in front of it and charging 15 quid to get in. The Horse Hospital wouldn't do that, it would do something good, charge you five quid to get in and you'd have a lot more fun. I mean, f*** the ICA."   ( Oliver Payne, The Evening Standard, 2002 )

       New from  urlLink Akashic Books   1) FIREWATER, a green novel by Edward Cohen "This may not be the first environmental novel, but itâ€™s the first one that produces belly laughs."   --MARY BRINGLE, author of Murder Most Gentrified [full book details below]  2) JONAH SEES GHOSTS, a novel by Mark Sullivan "A stunning look at the addictive personality of an adolescent boy in an alcoholic family." --LIBRARY JOURNAL [full book details below]  ************************  FIREWATER a green novel by Edward Cohen  $13.95, A Trade Paperback Original, 200 pages, ISBN: 1-888451-43-2 Publication Date: June 2003  Firewater is the first selection of the Akashic Rural Surreal series.  "A comic, surrealistic response to a very real problem: the collusion of government and big business to create â€˜the science of death and the death of science . . .  a monoculture of death . . . A wild romp." --LIBRARY JOURNAL  "Eccentric, hilarious . . . This may not be the first environmental novel,  but it's the first one that produces belly laughs."   --MARY BRINGLE, author of Murder Most Gentrified  "All the feeling of Abbey in the words of Bukowski."   --JAMES RIDGEWAY, author of Blood in the Face  "From Bhopol to Chernobyl, from Love Canal to the polluted oyster flats of  the Northwest, Edward Cohen wards off depression by rapping the funny bone.  Here, where paranoia is no longer a disease, but a given of the human condition, Ed Cohen's hyperbolic imagination is an irreverent tonic."  --JOHN GARDINER, author of Great Dream From Heaven  FIREWATER is a brutally funny environmental suspense novel featuring CHIEF SHELLDRAKE, favorite son for the US presidency and last hope for the world's survival. A perfect anti-hero for the post-apocalypse, Shelldrake is equal parts RALPH NADER (in his zealous environmental activism), SITTING BULL (in his proud tribal loyalties), HUEY LONG (in his fiery demagogic populism), and  WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON (in his unquenchable appetite for voluptuous young women).  EDWARD STONE COHEN (1937-1999) was born in Massachusetts and lived his final years toggling between two unique hotels, of which he and his wife were proprietors -- the Tabard Inn in Washington, DC, and the Moby Dick in Washington State. He was a tireless environmental activist.  ******  JONAH SEES GHOSTS a novel by Mark Sullivan  $13.95, A Trade Paperback Original, 196 pages, ISBN: 1-888451-04-1 Publication Date: July 2003  "Written with insight and compassion, this is a stunning look at the  addictive personality of an adolescent boy in an alcoholic family." --LIBRARY JOURNAL  "Mark Sullivan writes with beautiful, introspective clarity. In young Jonah,  he captures perfectly the conviction of perception that only the young  have." --HENRY ROLLINS  "Beset with the visions of a BOSCH, and the honesty of a HENRY MILLER,  Mark Sullivan's young protagonist faces the twenty-first century in bewilderment.  With the invention of this anti-hero all his own, Sullivan leaves us wiser in our admiration for his remarkable first novel." --JOHN ROLFE GARDINER, author of Great Dream from Heaven  JONAH SEES GHOSTS is a shocking, touching, and humorous debut novel  that blends magical realism with a figurative study of the ways alcohol abuse shapes the personalities within a family. Resembling a stylish blend of S.E. Hinton, Stephen King, and Tom McGuane, Jonah Sees Ghosts tells the story of fifteen-year-old Jonah Hart, a boy with a problem he's afraid to share: Not only does he see ghosts, but when he dreams at night, he leaves his body and travels in the ether -- a compellingly addictive form of retreat.  AS THE GHOSTS THAT PLAGUE HIM become more and more aggressive, Jonah withdraws into his dream world; when things there turn dangerous as well, the boy is forced to make a stand from the full depths of abandonment and isolation in a last stab at redemption. At its heart, Jonah Sees Ghosts is a story of love within dysfunction and the adaptability of the human spirit.  MARK J. SULLIVAN, III is a writer and a musician. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife and two sons and is currently working on his second novel, Angel, Fallen from Heaven.  contact: Johanna Ingalls Akashic Books PO Box 1456 New York, NY  10009 Akashic7@aol.com www.akashicbooks.com

       More Than Music Festival   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  March 29, 2003 – Columbus, Ohio – Organizers have announced that the 11th Annual More Than Music Festival will take place in Columbus, Ohio on July 11th and 12th, 2003.  The event will be held at The Factory, a prestigious multi-stage/multi-room venue that will allow the hosting of music, art, film, and speaker/discussion led panels and workshops.  During the past ten years, More Than Music has undergone much change, innovation, and diversification – each year simultaneously reflecting and building upon the present community through the medium of a music festival. A music festival not only intent on showcasing performers large and small (for More Than Music has always served as a proving ground for many of the underground scene’s up-and-coming bands, who soon exploded into national prominence) but whose profits are always extended to benefit local and national organizations/projects. For its eleventh and final year, More Than Music embraces experience and evolution to showcase the spirit and excitement of the event, artist and audience combined.  More Than Music has certainly lived up to its name, creating a forum where music itself can be the medium that brings people together, and where a discussion of politics can move beyond the rhetoric of government or activism and into the realms of philosophy, aesthetics, ethics, ethnicity, environment, and the choices we make every day.  Appearing at previous festivals have been the Carbon Defense League, Ruckus Society, Lost Film Collective, as well as workshops and discussion panels led by renowned graffiti artists and many, many prominent activists.  More Than Music 2003 casts the net wider to reach out across different genres and scenes in order to forge links between them. In doing so it’s recognized that many of the same ethics and Do It Yourself attitudes are shared between the hip-hop, techno, indie, noise, industrial, metal, jazz, and hardcore scenes.  More Than Music has showcased 250+ artists and speakers over the past decade, including groups such as Adult, Avail, Blood Brothers, Bratmobile, Converge, Delta 72, The Faint, Get Up Kids, Hot Water Music, Jets to Brazil, Lightning Bolt, The Locust, Milemarker, Party of Helicopters, The Promise Ring, Q and Not U, Rainer Maria, The Rapture, Shellac, Suicide, and The Walkmen.  The lineup for More Than Music 2003 will be announced in the upcoming weeks.  More Than Music has received press coverage in Alternative Press, Spin Magazine, Black Book, Village Voice, Rolling Stone, Stuff and on MTV2.  Spin calls it “an indie nerd’s wet dream,” and Stuff says, “Looking for the future of rock?  Come here and see the best of the underground.”  The beneficiaries of the festival include Food Not Bombs, Project Open Hand, Kaleidoscope Youth Coalition, Central Ohio Abortion Access Fund, Buckeye Regional Anti Violence, and Amnesty International.  To request a media kit on this event or to line up coverage and/or press passes, please contact Peter Bottomley of Skyscraper Media at 303-544-9858 or peter@skyscrapermedia.net.   www.morethanmusic.org www.factorycolumbus.com www.skyscrapermedia.net

        >>>ARTROCKER-TORIAL 94  >>THIS WEEK...DELIA MENTIONS JOHNNY CASH - A LOT...PARSLEY EXPERIENCES THE NEW >>YORK POWERCUT...DEB DIGS MARS...STEWART REMINDS US THAT THEY HAVE A TUBE >>SYSTEM IN GLASGOW...DAVE BURTON HAS MORE FUN ON TOUR WITH YEAH YEAH YEAHS... >>TOM SAMPLES THE ATMOSPHERE...MELLISH MEETS HOLLY GOLIGHTLY OUTSIDE >>TIFFANY'S...TEQUILA IS UNIMPRESSED BY THE GA GA'S SHENANIGANS...AND STUFF!!  So here we are, Thursday and I'm still suffering the effects of Leeds. That's the festival, not the city, although I did live in Leeds for a while back there, and it took a few years to recover from that experience, they like a drink in them parts! To be more specific, I haven't recovered from Friday night when The Hells strutted their wonderful stuff. After a horrendous journey of 6 and a 1/2 hours (twice as long as usual) we stumbled, crook backed from car seats, into The Hells dressing room wherein our dusty eyes beheld a veritable feast of booze. Artrockers, I lay into it like a man posessed, a very large bottle of vodka being my prime target, determined to cut it down to size. Of course this was a battle that the bottle was always going to win. Within a frighteningly short space of time I was doing the old wobbly walk, like a sailing boat running against the wind, I tack far over to the left on one leg, hit a wall and tack wildly to the right on the other leg till a hard surface is encountered. This walking technique is long winded and means that you walk at least 4 times as far as you need to in order to reach your destination. And when you do pitch up, half an hour later and a good 50 feet from your starting point, damned if you can remember why you wanted to go there in the first place. Best take a leak so as not to waste the journey and then start tacking back in the general direction of drunken voices. We've all done it at one time or another haven't we Artrockers? It's only human. The subtle difference here was that the whole thing was being filmed by the documentary team that's been following us around all year. Have you any idea how hard I've been working at portraying the correct, sober, image? And I blew the whole schmeer over one large bottle of Smirnoff. I need to find the contract, did we ask for 'final cut'? Hang on a second, not only is there no 'final cut' clause, there is no contract. We are trusting souls who beleive in community baby! Let's hope the film makers are of a similar mind set, that footage is dynamite, my fan base will be terribly disillusioned. I know this because I asked him. Apparently, and I'm not proud of this, unable to walk or even talk, I drove us all over to the camping grounds with Paul's hand hovering over the steering wheel. Many years ago, when you could still get away with it, I perfected a drunken driving technique that has never failed me, close one eye and the road stops wandering around in an unpredictable manner. This technique I now applied and, with an average speed of 1 mph, made it safe and sound to the tents. Which was the cue for Myshkin's Tequila to be unwrapped and for my memory to shut down, all else is blamk until I found myself, in the cool morning dew, fertilising a tree with the day before's food and drink. I felt fairly chipper after that, that's chipper as in not quite so fucked as I was. The rest of the day was viewed from the right side of a very dark pair of Aviators which did nothing for my cool factor, smeered as I was with puke and grass stains.  The fesival? Well, it was a festival wasn't it?, same as they ever are. It made a nice change from Reading though in that we could walk through the guest bar without wild eyed record company execs. leaping out and berating us for slagging off their latest Indie tossers. Speaking of whom, The Thrills are on the radio right now and Jack, quite rightly, asked who the hell likes this band. My answer was "old men who like a nice four part harmony because it reminds them of The Byrds or The Fannies or something like that - it reminds them of their youth!" Old and in the way, meet young and totally irrelevant.  Acoustic guitars are the work of the devil: discuss.  TOM ARTROCKER  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  CONTENTS.  1.  DELIA'S GIG GUIDE  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  1.  >>>DELIA'S GIG GUIDE  >Johnny Cash: How do I get to be him? Some music is so great that i can't really deal with listening to it. It jiggles through my veins as though i've got a drip putting it in intraveneously. I feel my skin crinkling and my fingers clenching trying to cope with the glory of pop. I dance around my room but can't go fast/slow/high/small/big enough. I shoot sparks of pop out of my fingernails and my hair falls out and re-attaches itself with frustration. when i am an old (er) lady i will be pushed around in a wheelchair (by sadistic jailers in debtors prison actually) and when i hear the faint echoes of tunes coming out of peoples windows you'll see my eyelashes flicker in get-up-dance desires.  >Soundtracks this week. Oh it's all gone Johnny Thunders. CAn't put your arms >around a memory.  What a tune. I kiss that tune. I put my arms around the memory of that tune whether Johnny likes it or not.  Also Angel Corpus Christi. Something about her voice makes you feel wistful and raw-hearted. Bleak is out and New York cool and Angel knows all about it. And The Violent Femmes. There's such good music out there. Forget about this weeks cool. Go and dig deep in your record collection (or someone else's) and rejoice in all that is great. Jubilations and salutations to all that is good and pure in pop. The greatness and perfection of pop can hit you in the face like a frying pan in a Tom And Jerry cartoon.  Johnny Cash: I'd even be a christian if i could be Johnny Cash.  R.I.P. Wesley Willis. 'Off-Kilter' , 'untoward' and well..let's face it...kinda bonkers. More blatant in having most of his songs sound quite similar than most bands admit to but if you've got such a genius song and such a great approach? well then that's okay. With songs about McDonalds and Urge Overkill and even (i had the great pleasure to witness..) about the Country Teasers he was  a one man tribute band. I am very privileged and proud to be able to tell that I met and headbutted with Wesley and he was a sweetheart. Where's like him? Not many and they're all dead....  Johnny Cash: He can and does sing anything and it sounds like the song they'll be playing when the end of the world comes.  >>>LAST WEEK  >Thursday:  A little tired....am djing for my friends singer-songwritery accordions/ melodica/ baby-jazz-drum kit bashing night. I meet some old friends. Ones in a band that's just been signed. I think everyone in London is in a band. They'll have to draw lots soon for who has to be the audience. And the ones that aren't in bands are DJS. Which are you? Bagsy not my turn to be roadie.  Johnny Cash: JOHNNY CASH!!!  >Friday:  The Bull And Gate. Milky Wimpshake/ A-Lines/ Speed Of Sound/ Cut-Outs/ Spinmaster Plantpot. We show up at 6.30pm for our soundcheck. The soundman was supposed to have been there since 5 soundchecking other bands and sorting out backline etc. Some kinda of muddle sees him turning up at about 7.30pm. Five bands to soundcheck in 30 minutes. We are all a little apprehensive and anticipating big fat Technical Hitches! But actually the sound is fantastic! Okay no one gets to rehearse all those songs they wish they knew better but maybe all those long soundchecks are just unnecessary (gasp!).  Yes 5 minutes per band is the new soundcheck. Why make the bar staff listen to 2 hours of snare drum soundchecks? it's a drum. it's going to go bang. does it really matter on the exact tonal quality of the bang? no. well probably yes actually...Spinmaster Plantpot is a one man rant machine, the cut-outs are like a band that you once saw supporting the 14 iced bears, the shop assistants or the passmore sisters a kind of shamble-fi keyboard peep-po pop hurtle down a pile of stairs piled up with razorcuts, talulah gosh and aaardvarks records (yes bit of that in there too...). Speed of sound are like the soundtrack to a strange european '60s film that's about swinging London without actually having been there...Kind of slightly jarred memories of groovy organ-beat go-go parties with a bitter aftertaste. The A-lines is my band (sorry i always say this but i don't want you to think that i'm going to ignore the fact that they're my band and then say amazing things about them as though i'm not in them or something and then you'll find out and think i'm a faker/ even more of a faker etc etc etc...) Well anyway it's not my place to review my own band. But someone from the Milky Wimpshake Sunderland scene crew tells me that we're 'champion' . And we sell 20 badges!!!! That's shifting units! If you think that there were maybe 120 people there. 20 had badges already then that's 20 percent of people that brought badges. And that's not allowing for people who would have brought badges if they'd realized we had some. So if you apply that to the world (this is of course assuming that the rest of the world would have been at a wimpy milkshake gig on a friday night if they'd only but known about it...) that means i should get about 5 billion badges made. maybe. And hurray! We're really getting someplace! We have picked up some girl-band stalkers! Every all-girl band needs at least one slightly odd male fan. All is right with the world. A man tells me he likes my bass playing whilst staring very hard at a part of me that i definitely don't use when i'm playing bass. he does the same for our guitarist. I meet a man who gave us a bad review once. He denies it was a bad review. I (being a sad fuck...) quote parts of it to him. He tells me I've totally mis-interpreted it and shuffles from foot to foot in oh-dear-ness. One of my bands once got a bad album review in a fanzine. I asked the man who did the bad review if I could have the album back as he obviously didn't like it....but I think it had already gone down the record and tape exchange....anyway enough sad bitterness from the past.... My brother has gone to the Sights at the dirty water club. he says they're good but a bit like hansom gone rock.  Johnny Cash: Take everything you own to the Record and Tape exchange and get some Johnny.  >Saturday:  Shit. Was going to go to Reading today. Okay they took The Darkness away from me and put them on an inaccessible Friday but i was still going to go. But all the bands that I particularly want to see are on early. The Futureheads are on at something like 12noon. And it's now 11am and i've just woken up (Maggie is affectionately pulling my hair with her smelly fish teeth strongly implying that it's kitties brekkers time...) Even if i had a helicopter in my garden to get over the fact that on bank holiday they've fucked up half the trains i still wouldn't make it to reading in time to see the futureheads. or even the agenda or probably not even jet. fuck. so i spend the day sulking like a fulish fule. later that evening i go to the buffalo bar to do the door for careless talk costs lives. Scout Niblett/ Todd/ La Momo/ Swearing At Motorists  / gordon  from cindytalk. Today i am a little bit of a tipsy door-lady. But fear not I stare extra carefully at every note to cancel out the voddikinis effect. Chocolate vodka and lemonade is definitely the coctail of the moment. Except don't have too many of you will definitely be sick (not that i did...- honest- much as john ctcl would have liked to have seen this thank you very much john...) Scout Niblett is wandering around in her Morwenna-Banks-as-naughty-child wig and a circus leotard style outfit. She looks about 20 years younger than she does in the photos i've seen of her. this is odd...normally press photos do their best to blend out oldiness and make you appear smooth and pop-star-beautiful. Scout is much prettier in real life (which is as it should be....). Swearing At Motorists is a Zappa-looking chap plus drummer playing retro style alt-rock which reminds me very much of a band called The Lucys but no one else apart from me ever liked them (not that i ever spoke to anyway) so that probably won't mean much to you. After his set there are still people queueing outside that couldn't get in to see his set. So he takes his guitar outside and plays some songs for the people in the queue. This is cool. I give him 10 out of 10 for coolness on that. He is very enthusiastic/exuberant about what he does. good. i hate moaning minnie bands.la Momo are sort of No Fun on synths and casio handclap beats machines with girl vocals and swooshy syntho noise. Todd are a cacophonous hairy-face noise opera of chunderous noise. Mark and jean-michael bouncer do silly grrrr-punk dances which should definitely be on the Todd video if there ever is one.  The Very Famous I Produced The Strokes Gordon Raphael comes to see Todd. He pays to get in without any 'i'm famous gimme freebies' try-outs. I respect him much more for this than any work he did on The Strokes album. A whole bunch of people totally totally love what Scout Nibletts doing. Me i'm a pleb and i just don't get it. she's drumming along to her own singing in a bit of a free-form style....she's doing the 'give me an a, give me a b' type chants that go on so long i lose track of what word she's spelling. (or is it random letters..???) but like i say people are screaming ecstactically at what she's doing/singing/performing so it's just me don't you worry.  Gordon Sharpe of Cindytalk does a late night swooshy beats behind eerie little couple of songs. Earlier he has had sushi delivered! OOoh get him ! we say....rock-star....but no....the sushi wasn't ordered! someone has had it delivered as a suprise....spooky and little embarassing but yum veggie sushi is scrummy.  Johnny Cash: What can I say?  >Tuesday:  Buffalo Bar- The Electric Shockis/ Whirlwind Heat. I recommend the new electric shocks video. make tom and paul show it to you. kinda found it in a skip version of the bangles going down to liverpool video. on the bus going from kings cross to camden i pass the site of this video. it will be on the (art) rock tour of fame anyday now. came to this show too late to see the bands but I Heard They Were Good!!!!  Johnny Cash....!!!!  >Wednesday:  Public life- yes a toilet indeed. The Square Mile Group are playing. Someone wanders in. 'Two pounds entrance please' the doorlady asks. 'is their a concessionary rate?' asks the customer. She is not joking. We are entertainingly shocked by her stinginess. Square Mile Group aren't helped by the fact that they really are playing a toilet and the sound swings around your head in a bit of an echo chamber battering. But it's kinda Astrid Gilberto style soothing jazzed up indie-bossa stuff that pokes it's head out of the reverberations every now and then. Even the bar-staff gently tap their toes doobie-doobie-doo.  >>>NEXT WEEK  >THURSDAY ***Cobden Club- Club Whoopee. A Mexicali theme and lots of scantily clad ladies in a burlesque affair. Including a Freida Kahlo  tableaux! ***Hms President- A punk-funk band on a boat. This band is all the NME website has on it today. ***Garage- RAdio 4/ Calla/ Maybe Futureheads...more punk-funk this one is for charity....no boat though. ***Underworld- The Locust- shrieking noise synth mayhem madness attack. in funny outfits. ***Water-rats- Spearmint (it's a super pop thingy) and Subway Sect (it's a legendary even popper thing with Vic Godard and some sublime songs).  >FRIDAY ***Monarch- Client. Whatever happened to Dub Star? This did. bit more synth-pop but still them icy cool vocals. ***Garage- Pretty Girls Make Graves (girly fronted punk jerks), The Blood Brothers (never seen them but people tell me dead good thigns...). ***ALSO! The Tapestry Weekend starts today! Get your arse down to Cornwall, get your spurs on! It's the battle of the country bands and the no-good punks! Expect The Country Teasers, The Beatings, Pink Grease, Gin Palace, loads loads more. Three days for 20 quids.  >SATURDAY ***Spitz- Brave Captain (geezer from Boo rads), Kicker (super soul fronted pop stuffs), Relict (i think a clientele spin-off being v. mellow pop?) plus DJS from St Etienne and Ash all in aid of Young I.A. charity. ***Needles- Homocrime club with The Gossip punk hollering diva lady and The Battys a Lesbo Pig spin-off.  >SUNDAY ***Club Tiki All Dayer with horns and hammond band Gene Drayton Unit and the Sugar Creek Trio. oh yeah this is at South London Pacific.  >MONDAY ***Metro- An acoustic show from Lemonhead country boy Evan Dando at a Death Disco night.  >TUESDAY ***Buffalo Bar- The Dirty (one of the best of the current London sprawly stir-it-up punk bands) and The Blood Group (kinda less laid-back / more sharp-edged) at an art-rocker night. ***Betsy Trotwood- A Ruby Tuesday indie-club night with Kicker again. ***Arts Cafe- The Pictures- synth-poppery from former Rosita lady. ***100 club- soledad brothers- one of them bluesy punky things.  >WEDNESDAY ***Stag-O-Lee- ole mens drinking den for young old men and ladies. dominoes and poker and sandwiches and drinking. at the new evaristo in greek street opposite the pillar of hercules. ***Spitz- Clientele- Indie-pop gintle-ben style. ***Arts Cafe- Wisdom Of Harry/ Klang- Pete Astors indie-rockers and if i tell you that klang was the studio that kraftwerk used to record in does that give you a clue perchance hmm? about what they sound like i mean. i'm not alluding to some special secret gig. ***Electric Ballroom- OKGO/ Webb Brothers - hmm heard some okgo ages ago kind retro '60s beat stuff if i remember aright with support from luscious harmony -pop brothers with kinda psychy pop tunes.  >THURSDAY ***Underworld- can't remember who the headliners are but support from beardy men Dukes Of Nothing playing kinda good fun boogie-metalling-pop stuff. ***Metro- Simple Kid- Kinda of like if Marc BOlan was around now and an indie kid. in a good way. and liked Beck too.  >FRIDAY ***Bull And Gate- The Country Teasers (twisted punk messed up country Fall noise beserkness in the most langorous of manners), The Beale - (art-rock), Nought (jazz-rock), Wet Dog (all girl pop-=punk stuff). ***UPstairs at the Garage- A Silver Rocket indie-rock night with glam-stompers Beachbuggy and more.... ***Buffalo Bar- Kosmische club night with Freeoform, Club_of_Rome and Zof doing all kindsa strange electronica and kraut-tie stuff.  xxdeliaxx

The group, comprising of Tom Kelly, Kevin Masson and William Kelly, are famous for their murals in the area of Derry, Northern Ireland, known as Free Derry Corner. These large-scale murals explicitly depict key images of the Troubles in the city since 1968. This exhibition of their work is a chronicle of those events within the struggle that the artists consider to have been the most significant during the last thirty years.  Displayed in installation as vast 12 x 9 foot vinyl hangings, the original murals were created as powerful re-presentations of a photographic moment of profound local symbolism, funded through donations of paint, supplies and door to door collections from the residents of the buildings they grace. Although the exhibition has toured widely throughout the world to great success, this is the first show in England for the artists, as the material has hitherto been seen as too delicate and controversial for exhibition within mainland Britain.  The works are a moving testament to the power of art as historical document; the importance of documentation within the history of art, and the power of art within society; a creative process that situates the past as something we must acknowledge within the present, and from which we can draw strength.   "We do not play down the contextual significance that lends itself to the work. Neither are we militant propagandists, tribal fantasists or proponents of the us-versus-them delusion that is still causing such evils around the world."

        From Jessica of Anglo   TIM BURGESS of The Charlatans releases debut single and album and announces UK dates in August  Tim Burgess releases a solo single I Believe In The Spirit on Monday 25th August on Straight Trippin’ through Play it Again Sam. The single is taken from the forthcoming album I Believe to be released 8th September.   I Believe was produced by Linus, who has worked with Puff Daddy and Lil Kim. The album was mixed at Studio Nine by Michael Patterson (J-Lo, Snoop, Beck and B.R.M.C). The band includes Roger Manning -  Keyboards (Beck / The Vines) and Probyn Gregory -  Horns (Brian Wilson).  Tim will perform his first solo shows in August, including an appearance at V2003. The dates are:  August Tue	12th 	Edinburgh 	Liquid rooms  Wed	13th 	Sheffield 		Leadmill  Thu	14th	Birmingham 	Academy  Sat	16th	Stafford		V2003 		 Sun	17th 	Chelmsford	V2003 Tue	19th	London		Scala Wed	20th	London		Scala  Tim Burgess adds: “I wanted my songs to represent me, my soul & my spirit. When I started writing I never thought it would get this far, there were so many obstacles in the way, but once I got started - I just couldn't stop. All the musicians who helped me with this record did it as a favour. The album was recorded in Linus’ one bedroom flat in Hollywood and if you listen carefully you may be able to hear the noisy neighbour downstairs blaring out 80’s hard rock. I would describe it as a ‘cheer you up record’, songs of joy & travel with influences from all of my favourite artists, rolled into my own style. This album is me, so check it out & turn it up!”  The full tracklisting for I Believe is:  •	I Believe In The Spirit       •	Held In Straps •	Only A Boy         •	We All Need Love •	Oh My Corazon •	Be My Baby      •	Years Ago •	Say Yes        •	Spend The Night •	Po’ Boy Soul      •	All I Ever Do

       The Education System  Once, against my better judgement, I became embroiled in the education system… The education system was as large as an eagle’s egg back then, of course… I stood back and observed how the wheels of the education system turned, mostly behind closed doors, grinding with severity of a gigantic pepper mill. The education system was hauntingly reminiscent of an over-sized 1970s glass coffee table at the time and I was decidedly impressed. Distracted by the unlikely nature of its appearance, I let it catch me off-guard… and the very next day I was swallowed whole by the education system. It wasn’t all bad though. I found myself in new social situations, in bed with different people. I found myself flaunting new lifestyles. I found my horizons expanding and diminishing at regular intervals like a concertina. I loved – and was loved. I found money – and spent it. I howled at the moon once or twice. I challenged God occasionally. I did other things too...

        Zine culture   At the   3AM   bash the other week (where I was municifently trashed, so I am surprised I can remember) Jimmy Bullet of the   Cheap Trash Poetry   zine (and husband of one of the DJs at the Maggie Fortune reading events in Whitechapel -- top night!) put a handful of his zines into my hand and requested a review on   3AM   .  Jimmy actually sold a record number of zines at our event, which just goes to show in my opinion.  I know it's tough as a zine editor -- I put out a couple in the early 90s and you have to contend with moody Goths who control the printing press, snarling punks who think you're an effeminate indie kid cos you've got an interview with a band who use a keyboard in there, crusties who want copies for free at gigs as the're saving their money for cider, petulant wasters who hassle you to review their atrocious demos... oooh never again! Although we couldn't stretch to a full review on here given the demands on all our time now we are an online publication of substantial cachet (I am now being deluged with all kinds of crap from people who just want to see their name in print but have nothing in particular to say...), I do feel obliged to provide some kind of plug so here goes...  There's five or six editions of   Cheap Trash Poetry   , which is seemingly a Brighton-based zine (though it gives a Blackheath address in the latest one -- perhaps they've moved?).  As you'd expect it's the usual designedly tatty and scrappy D.I.Y. montage of poetry, rants and interviews (Billy Childish and Sexton Ming, natch) -- you can either order (with an A4 SAE) from 44 Beaconsfield Villas, Brighton BN1 6HD (£1.50 each or a fiver for the lot) or log on to  urlLink  their site   for more info.  I'm actually quite surprised (yet encouraged) to see the zine scene's still alive within these shores -- I thought the net had eliminated but the need and the impetus for this kind of publishing.  I guess as long as the youth feel alienated and creative then that's not the case...

       20,000 Leagues Under the Industry Film Fest  “You want good art?” Cleveland film impresario Matthew T. asks rhetorically, if a bit insistently. “Then make it yourself.”  That’s pretty much the entirety of the whys and wherefores of the 20,000 Leagues Under the Industry Film Festival, which this year marks its fourth Cleveland happening. The festival, a joint venture between T. and Hollywood’s Marcel DeJure, began in 2000 at the defunct arts center Speak In Tongues on Cleveland’s Near West Side and marks its third annual showing at Collinwood’s Beachland Ballroom this August 22 through 24. It also has played in Marcel’s hometown, and will again this Thanksgiving weekend at the Echo Park Film Center. 	 “We began 20K because we saw a need in Cleveland that had to be filled,” explains Matthew T. “No one else was, or is, showing the type of work we screen.”  DeJure has his own take. “I would like us to play a part in distributing movies that deserve more attention then they are getting,” he says. “Also more films by women, people of color, youth, and more diverse material.  “As a mainly two-person operation,” he notes, “I think we cover a lot of ground.” That’s indisputable. With its title provided by a friend of Marcel’s on set regarding their position in the film biz — Marcel has worked for over 13 years as a lighting technician on films, music videos and commercials, as well as theater and live events, and also has a puppet troupe and product line known as “Cinnamon Roll Gang” — the duo’s initial motivation was to give Clevelanders an opportunity to view work they would not have seen otherwise. In that spirit, they have maintained a DIY ethic balanced against the need to reach out to the community-at-large while defying class structure. (Works are presented on their own merits and the festival is not wrapped in any dogma.)  With minimal staff and no funds, 20,000 Leagues this year made the foray into an open call for submissions to complement the work the pair scours various film festivals to find.  “We scavenge off other festivals, hunting and stalking film- and videomakers in theaters, skateboard shops, burrito stands, under rocks, on subways,” Marcel says, mostly serious. “You know — we ask a lot of questions and are very good listeners. If all else fails, the phone, Internet and flyering are handy as well. The scene crosses borders, and there’s a vast world of entertainment out there waiting for your eyes and ears.” While not the main focus of this year’s programming, an important mission for the founders was to reach out to younger filmmakers. To that end, they have added a program of films made by young people, along with a program suitable for young people.   “The film scene in Cleveland has a lot of room to grow,” enthuses Marcel. “This year, we are giving away a Super 8 camera and a cartridge of film to a youth, with the hopes of doing our part to help spawn fresh talent.  “We really care,” he adds, “and we’re not too proud to prove it.”  AS IF TO PROVE JUST THAT, 20K2K3 showcases the profiles-in-courage interview feature D.I.Y. or Die: How to Survive as an Independent Artist by L.A.’s Michael W. Dean.  Dean, who has been featured in Film Threat magazine and has guest-lectured at places including Cal Arts and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, also has written a book called $30 Film School (Muska & Lipman), a “complete start-to-finish course on no-budget, drive-by digital filmmaking.” With around 20 well-known, lesser-known and unknown musicians, artists, writers, sculptors and so forth, D.I.Y. or Die examines the basic questions facing those who just have to create, economic reality be damned.  As Dean puts it, “I wanted to interview my heroes, and my unknown buddies, and put them side by side with no star-system separation. Our little video is all about finding the common thread in artists who make cool stuff regardless of a paycheck.”  Similarly, the festival will present a true rarity — an underground feature-length film, Hood Rats by Ecuadorian Angeleno Edgar Arellano, shot with nine cuts on 10 rolls of film in three days. (DeJure calls it “raw and exciting.”) Though operating without even a meager budget, Arellano managed to put together a gritty, realist version of typically stylized urban exploitation fare, and with a largely Latino cast and crew to boot.  One other feature puts an entirely different spin on these same issues, Northwest by Coan “Buddy” Nichols and Rick Charnoski. Northwest is an intriguing glimpse at two companies of independent skate-park contractors, wholly comprised of skaters, who made their vision a reality starting in Portland, Oregon, and have since constructed parks in numerous cities and towns nationwide.  Nichols and Charnoski, who also are showing a shorter film, “Asbury,” depicting a group of skaters’ last ride in a pool being demolished in Asbury Park, New Jersey, started making films together in 1999 with “Fruit of the Vine,” a look at the world of backyard pool skating, and since have traveled around “filming new stuff” and “doing screenings like the old surf film guys.” (Perhaps unsurprisingly, the pair notes that they enjoy “skating, traveling, filming Super 8 and meeting new people.”)  AS FOR THE KIDS, this year’s 20,000 Leagues is delighted to present a series of works by young filmmakers, many under the aegis of Austin, Texas’ Center for Youth Cinema, which provides educational resources and training in film and video production for youths ages 11-18. Of these, the highlight may be 15-year-old Natalie Aston’s “Robert Bider: Master Thespian,” after a viewing of which one may never look at child actors the same way again. The star of “Master Thespian,” by the way, also is the director or co-director of three of the other shorts featured by the CYC: “Toycar” and “French Restaurant,” with Duncan Knappen, in the first of which two very young boys take mom’s car for a joyride (in the second, two older boys hatch a plan to acquire a big-screen TV); and “Clicker Boy,” wherein a young boy uses his remote control to make his world his own. CYC also presents a mockumentary called “Rattlehead: Heavy Metal is God,” which is fairly self-explanatory. The films cover a wide variety of styles, scenes and sounds, and it is often difficult to remember they were made by teens and preteens.  20K VETERANS SHOULDN’T FRET, HOWEVER — though Matthew T. and Marcel DeJure maintain that “underground” does not necessarily mean “subversive,” they have not forgotten to include compelling work that may titillate as well as entertain, and possibly shock.  One of 20K2K3’s surefire hits, for example, is “Pornographic Apathetic” by L.A.’s T. Arthur Cottam, whose “Beer Goggles” was, hands down, last year’s bust-out success. Described as a “satirical look at the desensitizations of sex through pornography,” the five-and-a-half-minute “Pornographic Apathetic” features four actors ad-libbing would-be dialogue from porn films, with nary an expression or emotion in sight. (The films recently won the Christopher Wetzel Award for Independent Film Comedy at the Gene Siskel Film Center.) “The goal remains to entertain,” T. comments, “because work is work, after all.”  T., a noted and well-traveled indie filmmaker himself — he began filming in 1994, when a friend and co-worker gave him his first Super 8 camera and said, “Now you’re a filmmaker,” lives a life of unsteady freelance work in commercial film production, and has had several of his works play literally all over the world in festivals both large and small — knows his field well. Ask him what constitutes an “independent” film, and he has this to say:  “For me, it’s a film that was made completely outside of any studio system, and that the filmmaker had as complete control on the process as could be. That is not to say a million-dollar film is not independent; but if that film is made by committee with market concerns in mind, it is not really independent ... That is why the distinction ‘underground’ is often used. These films are not necessarily subversive, just removed from Hollywood/indiewood concerns and style, generally speaking.” 	 This year’s 20,000 Leagues carries on that tradition with selections such as Philadelphia’s Kate McCabe’s award-winning semi-documentary Go-Go Rama Mama, a look at the inside world of strippers and how they earn their tips. (McCabe received her master’s in Experimental Animation from Cal Arts, has worked with world-renowned independent filmmakers, and is herself an award-winning veteran of many experimental and underground film festivals.)  There’s also Brooklyn, New York’s Becky Goldberg’s Hot and Bothered: Feminist Pornography, a look into the empowerment theories behind that artform. Her directorial debut, which she spent two years creating, Hot and Bothered has garnered a Haig Manoogian Production Grant and a Chicago Underground Film Fund Grant. (She’s currently fund-raising for her next feature-length documentary.)  	 Another eye-opener is David Chalker’s “Hypocrite,” in which an actress plays cinema itself, literally kicking the audience around, thanks to a special camera housing the filmmaker devised. “Hypocrite,” Chalker’s latest film, won the Grand Prize Golden Gate Award for Best Bay Area Short Film at the 2002 San Francisco International Film Festival, along with the Most Innovative Short Film Award at the Tiburon International Film Festival, has screened in over 20 festivals worldwide and has been broadcast on PBS. (Chalker also has shot various other projects, including a museum installation that won the First Place Award at the Irish Museum of Modern Art. He has worked on dozens of features, shorts, commercials, music videos and documentaries, and also is a director of the Hip-Hop Film Festival, a touring festival that has screened films all over the country.)  20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE INDUSTRY — the brainchild of Cleveland’s own Matthew T. and Hollywood’s Marcel DeJure — truly offers something for everyone. A final quick rundown would include black humor, outstanding and innovative animation, existential examinations, depressing slices of humanism, farces, spoofs, fake commercials and mockumentaries, straight-out art explorations, radical political commentary, and a whole lot of stuff that defies description:  Standout politically oriented works include Austin, Texas’ Jason Archer and Paul Beck’s pair of satirical painted shorts, “The State of the Union” and “Homeland Hodown,” from artists who helped animate Richard Linklater’s Waking Life and music videos for artists including former Talking Head David Byrne. (“The State of the Union” was acclaimed Best Animated Film at the 2002 Chicago Underground Film Festival.)  Then there’s Guerrilla News Network’s Stephen Marshall’s “Countdown,” examining the stranglehold corporations have on media, along with Marshall’s “When the Smoke Clears,” a poetic dissing of modern hip-hop’s mores, or lack therof, set to the propulsive beat of Dead Prez’s “Hip hop.” (GNN also presents “The War Conspiracy,” the tale of Berkeley professor Peter Dale Scott’s suppressed 1970 book about the CIA.)  Animation and related fare includes Brooklyn’s Julia Sarcone-Roach’s whimsical “Call of the Wild,” featuring any number of quirkily drawn small, fuzzy animals connected by a party line and their dreams; and New York’s John R. Dilworth’s “The Mousochist” — “The story of a mouse who could not control his impulses.”  Dilworth, an animation director and designer whose work has appeared on CBS, Showtime, HBO, FOX, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, MTV, Canal +, and Arte, is the founder of Stretch Films, Inc., a leading design and production animation studio. His 1995 animated short film “The Chicken From Outer Space,” was sponsored by Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network, and was nominated for an Academy Award, an Annie Award and a CableACE Award. (Dilworth has also produced and directed 12 independent short films that have screened worldwide and won numerous awards. His work has appeared in Spike & Mike’s Festival of Animation and Sick & Twisted, with the 1995 Lollapalooza Music Festival, and was chosen to open the feature film Crumb in Montreal, Canada.) Plus the utterly fantastical “Plain English” by Baltimore’s John Standiford, which features herky-jerky, grainy images speaking lines from an ESL course in a restaurant in Japan.  Chilling and bleak films number “The Sandpit and the Disappearance of Kerry Sommers” by New York’s Jake Magher, a purportedly true story put together from bits of home videos that will keep you up late into the night, and “Estranged” by New York’s Todd Downing, based on Joe Frank’s radio play “Rent a Family,” the tale of a lonely woman alone in a big house.  (Downing received his MA in Media Studies at New York’s New School. His work has a diverse and loyal cult following for its dark humor and originality, appealing not only to the underground film community, but also to film and culture scholars, as well as numerous gay and straight film festival attendees. His films have been profiled in an array of press, as well as media outlets such as National Public Radio, MTV Brazil, Channel 4 [London], Canal +, and the Japanese version of Good Morning America. He was recently named one of the “Six Best Directors You’ve Never Heard Of” by SHOUT magazine and has received multiple grants from the Creative Capital Foundation, The New York Foundation for the Arts and The New York State Council on the Arts.)  Plus films by Clevelanders, enough for a program of their own. These include Jack Yager’s “The Devil Was Hot,” based on a short story by Charles Bukowski (it’s Yager’s second film, following eight years of industry work, including stints with American Splendor and Welcome to Collinwood); “Application Counter,” an examination of Cleveland, inspired by its neighborhoods, by P.J. Doran and Matthew Wascovich, an “industrial-themed visual artist” and writer, respectively; “Valley Sketches” by Damon Nathaniel Smith and Tobias Morrison; “Wake,” by Nora Hartlaub; and “What Grows in the Ashes of this Garden” by the Budakid collective, examining the Temple of Lost Love, which is now itself lost. The films run the gamut, ranging from frankly cinematic, to expressionistic, to realistic, and everywhere in between.  Also showing are works by Cleveland’s indie-film ambassador Robert C. Banks Jr., who needs no further hype, and “The Wolfman” by former Clevelander Sean Carney, who currently calls Hollywood home but is returning for 20,000 Leagues to perform the score of his film live — as he has, most notably, at Totalfest in Missoula, Montana.  “Cleveland lacks a media arts center like many other towns have,” Matthew T. points out in closing. “I don’t know why. A media arts center would supply gear and classes for filmmakers ... It is hard when you are using equipment that is considered obsolete, such as Super 8. I would like to encourage more filmmakers to do their own work and form their own ideas.”  Hence  urlLink 20,000 Leagues Under the Industry Film Festival.  Every town should be so lucky.

        urlLink Cryptonight  at the Club Tropical in Culver City, California      Thurs October 2, 8 PM - The Neon Hunter Collective with Norton Wisdom     david witham - keyboards, effects and theremin matt reid cohn - keyboards, effects and theremin dan morris – drums and percussion norton wisdom – live performance painter  Pianist David Witham brings his free-wheeling trio, The Neon Hunter Collective, to the Club Tropical. Providing visual counterpoint is Norton Wisdom, a renowned and adventurous live performance painter. The Collective combines elements of dub, jazz, free improv, and electronica into a funky stew for the eyes and ears. David Witham and Matt Reid Cohn play keyboards, effects and theremin, and Dan Morris plays drums and percussion.   The Neon Hunter Collective evolved from the visual explorations of David Witham and his life-long friend Matt Reid Cohn. Their soundtracks for video installations at the Museum of Neon Art in Los Angeles and the Caretta Shiodome in Tokyo led them to join drummer Dan Morris and create live music in the same spirit.

       Tuesday, October 28th, Beachland Ballroom:     In the Tavern  --  Kaito / Parts & Labor / Tyondai Braxton / Brian Straw & Matthew Wascovich  -- Didn't think they did noise-rock in the UK, eh? Forget your Blur records; upon a cursory listening Kaito's female-fronted shred owes much to Cle's very own Pere Ubu's most experimental works, along with a good dollop of bands like Huggy Bear and Bratmobile. Acclaimed young Brooklyn trio Parts and Labor shred it up like the best no-wave/prog rock band you've never heard; their pal Ty Braxton (son of composer Anthony Braxton) goes on the solo tip with guitar, effects pedals, and solid tunes. Parts and Labor and Braxton's tour is in supoort of their great new split-release on Narnack records. Matthew Wascovich (who's collaborated with the likes of Todd Colby, Thurston Moore, Christiina Carter, Byron Coley) and our very own Brian Straw perform works that combine rust-belt liturgies with trips down a sonic Cuyahoga.   $6 -- 9 PM   Beachland Ballroom 15711 Waterloo Rd.  Cleveland, Ohio 44110  tel: 216.383.1124  More info:  http://beachlandballroom.com http://www.slowtoe.com http://www.brianstraw.com http://www.partsandlabor.net http://www.tyondai.com http://www.kaito.co.uk  *spread the word*

Programmed by Kendra Gaeta  ***************************************   Sunday, October 19 North Six, doors at 8, show at 9 (sharp)  Brooklyn, New York, USa Live Showcase  *inter-band DJ’s and visuals by the Mighty Robot Audio/Visual Squad   The Sabers with Mike Sump   Described as a “bleed-heavy” and “brilliantly restrained” soundscape, The Sabers melt it down. Loops and field recordings, drumming rhythmic fields, a guitar and one small city of pedals, effects, and mixers distill a surprisingly simple and mesmerizing sonic experience. The video, by Mike Sump, was executed based on saber's music and is a visual reaction to the layered quality the music possesses.   Grandpa’s Ghost with video by James Ftopoulos  “We're going to work from within to help make the head spin...” A four-piece band: two guitars, bass, and sound manipulator, with strobing video images by experimental filmmaker Jim Fotopoulos. Locking into rhythms and very certain feels, this performance is self-described as something “psychologically to withstand.”   Lukasz Lysakowski + Kurt Ralske  Two-thirds of the international performance group 242.Pilots, Lysakowski and Ralske use customized software to explore real time visual improvisation and generative audio visual performance. The New York Times has praised their work as “a compelling, intriguing alliance of sound and motion.”   Aspect of Physics  Can the tonality and frequency interactions of sound, in a mathematical sense, shed light on the basic root level interactions between humans? Ask Aspects of Physics... Two Aspects perform live in New York with the third, in San Diego. Through a live internet feed, the manipulated audio/visual mix will be fed back and simulcast in San Diego, a block away from the point of origin (just because they can).

       From Oxbridge junkie to sixth form wannabe   "It’s happened again. The other day I was deep in the Tube, powering my way through the loose maul, when a poster caught my eye. Will Self is promoting his latest book. At first glance the photo resembles an ad for a men’s magazine. Cool guy, cool clothes, cool chair, cool glare. Self sits sheathed in impassive black tailoring, with one leg casually thrown over the other; his intense skull and cold blazing eyes appraise you with a look of narcissistic derision. Hm, I thought, another Will Self novel. Already? They’re getting more frequent than rail crashes... So whatever the book is like, I can see that Will Self Worldwide is trading as vigorously as ever. And that infuriates me. It drives me mad. As I scurry through the seething tunnels I feel a rush of envy surge though my veins. I am beside myself with anger. Why am I beside myself? Because I am not beside Self. I am beneath Self -- way, way beneath him. Along with hundreds of other neglected word-slaves, I toil and hack through the freelance jungle while above us soars this prolific bird, plying the airy canopy of literary stardom."

       An online Fitzrovia?   3AM  continues to attract praise from the quality press in Britain with this mention in  urlLink last Saturday's Daily Telegraph :   "In Bloomsbury, 3ammagazine.com hosted a reading by young novelists. The line-up was suitably roguish for a website that aims to be an online Fitzrovia. It included the novelist Matt "New Puritan" Thorne and Daren King, whose novel Jim Giraffe will be published by Cape in February.   Thorne read from his newly completed novel, Cherry, which won't be published until 2005 since Faber is launching him as a children's author later this year and Cherry contains "scenes of an adult nature". King's story of a lewd ghost giraffe has already been promised cult status in two broadsheets, as well as in Penthouse magazine - under the circumstances, King said, "that's the one I'm most pleased about".   Also reading were Toby Litt, one of Granta's top 20 Young British Novelists, and the art critic Matthew Collings. Perhaps it was the company, but Collings confessed to feeling disaffected with artists' illiterate conversation and drunken habits. Certainly his wife is encouraging him to lead a more temperate life. For Christmas she gave him three months' membership of Holmes Place."   So that's  The Times ,  Guardian  and now the  Telegraph .  Anyone at  The Independent  care to comment? Your new tabloid's really good, by the way...

       Anti-hangover pills  In Monday's  Evening Standard , Literary Editor  urlLink David Sexton  penned a lengthy piece (no link available) on literary sites and blogs, citing the  urlLink Complete Review  and  urlLink Bookslut  as brand leaders in an emerging market of increasing relevance.  He mentioned that literary blogs are sometimes tardy with the updates, because the writer has a hangover.  This blog is no exception, so you'll just have to cruise on over to Jim Giraffe's blog  urlLink here  until I sleep it off.  Hangover courtesy of the  urlLink Artrocker Club .

       RIP writer/artist/teacher/poet Jeff Nuttall  .... who died on 4 January. He was most famous for his 1968 work  Bomb Culture , one of the coolest beatnik books, detailing the rise of the underground.   I had the pleasure of playing in a band (Brigandage) with Jeff’s son Tim who, seemingly living out his father's work, was definitely part of the capital’s mid-80s underground.   At that time, Tim lived in a semi-derelict Victorian housing association place-cum-squat. It made the  Withnail and I  abode look like a glittering palace – and, indeed, some of the behaviour that went on there made Richard E Grant’s character look like a lightweight.   Peering through his mop of curly ginger hair, and displaying a natural can’t-be-bothered ambience, Tim embodied the prevalent all-over-the-fucking-place Camden squatter ethos.  He spent much of his time poncing money, staring at the wall, growing his fingernails, and trying not to waste his time on superfluous activities like washing or eating.  He also liked his liveners – too much, sometimes. I remember heading round to his gaff to pick him up for a gig. The way his eyes rolled in different directions alerted me to the fact that something was slightly awry with our Timbo. When he started talking in tongues and flinching from invisible blows, I realised the crazy fool had overdone the speed, and psychosis had set in. One of the symptoms of Tim’s disorder was the belief that he needed to piss constantly, and the cab ride from Camden to the Fulham Greyhound was eventful, to say the least. The cabbie wasn’t best pleased to have a raving loon in the back for starters, and his mood rapidly went downhill after being asked to stop every few hundred yards so that Tim could try to empty his already empty bladder. Unfortunately, our boy’s self-awareness and co-ordination was not what it should have been, and the image of Tim careering back to taxi in Green Park with trousers round his ankles, cock flapping in the breeze, is an enduring one.  Despite all that kind of malarkey, Tim was – and still is hopefully (sorry if this is starting to sound like his obit) – a very talented bloke. Check out the Brigandage tape-only release ( FYM  – on FO Records, contact me for details. Rare.) if you don’t believe me – or, ask Roland Gift who, before joining the Fine Young Cannibals, used to jam with Tim.   So, Tim, sorry to hear about your dad. And, if you’re reading this, have you got that tenner I leant you back in 1986? But, hey, don’t worry about your share of the cab money to the Greyhound that time…  Next week: the day Pinky, future wife of  Ripped and Torn  writer AL, OD-ed on Tuinal, fell several floors from her tower block squat, and woke up next day in a big metal rubbish bin. Oh, how everyone laughed.   Richard Cabut

        Event Report   The  3AM  'New Rock and Roll'  urlLink Xmas Bash  on 30 December was very well-attended, with a keen and eager crowd packing out the  urlLink Aquarium Gallery  in the Euston district of North London.   urlLink Myself ,  urlLink Andrew Gallix  and  urlLink Richard Marshall  curated the event and  3AM  Co-Editor  urlLink Bertie Marshall  was also in attendance.  First up was  urlLink Black Amber  author Alex Wheatle, who read from his novel  The Seven Sisters  -- a tense account of life in a children's home.  He was followed by  urlLink Ali Catterall , who give an amusing account of an encounter with Southeast London celebrity gangster Dave Courtney.  East London's favourite purveyor of banned lesbian fiction  urlLink Charlotte Cooper  then gave an 'interactive' talk on the pitfalls of life within a multinational corporation, with several audience members walking away with all manner of executive toys and corporate promos.  In an unscheduled appearance, the legendary  urlLink Stewart Home  gave a (very) brief reading, which (some might say) made up for Mark Simpson and Tony White cancelling at the last minute.  We were then treated to a lively talk from  urlLink Matthew Collings , which we felt was something of a coup for  3AM  as we're fans of his recent high profile TV work.   urlLink Preethi Nair , whose  One Hundred Shades of White  is released next Monday, gave an inspirational account of how she fled the world of management consultancy to become a novelist.   urlLink Paul Crooks  was able to give us an interesting reading from his intensively-researched novel  Ancestors .  urlLink Toby Litt ,  urlLink Matt Thorne  and  urlLink Ben Richards  provided some top drawer contemporary British literary talent to the evening, airing short stories.  Finally, we were fortunate enough to have  urlLink Daren King  read a few sections of his eagerly-awaited  Jim Giraffe , which is likely to figure highly in 2004 British publishing.  Sorry, I can't be more descriptive but it's New Year's Day and my head is still somewhat in bits from the festivities last night.  A fuller account will appear on the main site in the near future and the pictures from the event remain on Andrew Gallix's digital camera until he returns to Paris in a few days' time.  Fortunately, photoblogger  urlLink Yuki  was  urlLink on hand  to get a  urlLink few snaps  of the night.  In all, (aside from the beer supply running out) we felt the event was a success and would like to thank the authors who gave readings and those who turned up to hear them -- who now want more  3AM  events in 2004 by all accounts.  I think we can manage that...

       Wildly over-sexed and on the net  From the  Telegraph 's literary diary section (no link -- subscription-only):   "The Conville & Walsh literary agency is being inundated with offers this week for  London Calling,  the memoirs of a call-girl who goes by the name of Belle du Jour. The book started life as a weblog, detailing Belle's career trajectory from academia to prostitution. In publishing terms, Belle's main selling point is that she is a 28-year-old academic from a "good family" who confesses herself to be "wildly over-sexed". She has also proved herself to be a lively writer, winning the 2003  Guardian Best-Written Website Award,  and attracting 10,000 readers a day online.   So it is no surprise that her agent is considering bids from the publisher Serpent's Tail, which is offering jointly with Bantam - the same team which published  The Sexual Life of Catherine M  - as well as Weidenfeld & Nicolson.   There are film and TV offers too: from Lloyd Levin, who wrote and produced  Boogie Nights,  and the British producers behind   Footballers' Wives.    An Italian publisher has made a pre-emptive five-figure bid for translation rights.   The book is expected to be a huge success if only because of the Belle Lettriste's anonymity. A frenzied guessing game has begun, with Popbitch, the online gossip column, speculating that the Belle's real-life alter ego might be none other than Toby Young, the  Spectator's  theatre critic."

       Myths of 3AM  I won't embarass the poor student by mentioning them by name, but recently I had an email enquiry asking about the possibility of interning at  3AM  as a means to boost their student journalism portfolio (hey, it's a tough jobs market, I know).   You mean you think we have an office?  Somewhere you could actually turn up to on a morning and work? If only.  It's flattering and actually more commonly assumed than you might think (unless you're assuming it, I suppose).  The other common assumption is that we are in a position to pay people who write for us (erm, read the  urlLink guidelines  section).  Again, a case of 'if only' -- do you think we'd have that dated mast-head if we were a commercial concern with an image to think about? Who do you think we are, the  Paris Review ? (actually, the mast-head will be revamped, soon)  So what would a  3AM  office look like? Assuming we existed on, let's say, an Arts Council grant with a bit of Lottery funding thrown in for good measure, it'd actually be quite difficult to have one single office, given that our editors are spread across Europe and North America.  So we'd need a London office, a Paris office, a New Orleans office, a New York office and a Calgary office, even.  That's a lot of phone bills and rent, not to mention a lot of office parties at Xmas.  The IT budget alone would require a generous donation from a philanthropic source.  But let's stick to this fantasy realm anyhow.  Would the office be plush and Conde Nast? Of course not, it'd be grotty and flea-bitten, like the site.  There'd be piles of CDs and books, waiting to be reviewed by me... letters from American students wanting to intern, being answered by American interns... the drinks cabinet would be well-stocked too, of course.  The waiting room would be a veritable constant literary gathering as authors and musicians chewed the cud while waiting for Richard Marshall to get round to interviewing them... Richard Cabut and Bertie Marshall would be arguing the toss over who said what in 1977... me and Andrew Gallix would be bickering over some editorial issue and then decide to sod it and go down the pub to indoctrinate the interns into a life of alcoholism... actually, there'd be too many distractions, nothing would ever get done.   3AM  would probably fold in a month.  The Arts Council would demand their money back.  So there you have it.   3AM  has an office -- cyberspace.  Like literary mags of years gone by ( Merlin , for instance), its personnel do their business wherever they find inspiration.  An author once said to me that the reality is actually more fascinating than the myth in terms of the four guys who put the site together -- a politics lecturer at the Sorbonne, a deputy headteacher in West London, an East London-based government relations manager for a Japanese organisation and a web designer in Calgary.  After I've thought about why there's so many people at  3AM  that are called either Richard or Andrew or have the surname Marshall (though HP, Utahna and Wasco more than make up for that), I'll drop the student a line and see if there's anyone in my contacts book who might be able to assist them in their noble goal.   3AM  -- it's not how we define it, it's how others perceive it.  OK, enough self-indulgent wankery for today.

       Could we muster 20 000 'thinkers' in Britain?  From  urlLink The Guardian :   "More than 20,000 French artists, thinkers, film-makers, scientists, lawyers, doctors and academics have signed a petition accusing the centre-right government of "waging war on intelligence" and instituting "a new state anti-intellectualism". In a campaign bound to inflame passions in France, where penseurs are accorded the kind of respect most countries reserve for their rock stars, the signatories denounced a "coherent policy" to "pauperise and fragilise every field considered ... unproductive, useless or dissident".   Among the better-known names to have signed the document, published in today's issue of Les Inrockuptibles magazine, are the philosopher Jacques Derrida, film-makers Bertrand Tavernier and Claude Lanzmann, theatre director Ariane Mnouchkine, novelist Marie Darrieusecq, the former Socialist culture minister Jack Lang and Danny Cohn-Bendit, hero of the May 1968 student uprising."

       A very French affair  The story concerning the extradition of the Italian novelist Cesare Battisti from France:   "A reformed Italian terrorist turned successful crime writer has been arrested and faces extradition from France, despite a longstanding promise that Paris would always provide a safe haven for one-time Red Brigades militants.  The arrest last week of Cesare Battisti, who has lived peaceably and openly in the French capital since 1990, has prompted a storm of protest. "France offered judicial protection to these men and women," a Socialist party spokesman, Julien Dray, said yesterday. "Not to respect that promise would be unworthy of France's traditions and an insult to our history."   Opponents say the government has broken a 1985 pledge by the late Socialist president, François Mitterrand, that members of the far-left terror cells, whose bombings and assassinations rocked Italy in the 1970s and 1980s, would be left in peace in France provided they renounced their past, did not go into hiding and kept out of politics."

       Eggers all over his face   urlLink Bully Magazine on the Underground Literary Alliance, Dave Eggers and amazon.com reviews :   "In an amazing story that no doubt ruined Valentine's Day for at least a few authors, Amy Harmon reported in last Saturday's New York Times that a week-long glitch in Amazon.com's Canadian site had caused formerly anonymous customer reviews to be posted with the reviewers' real names. Not surprisingly, a number of authors were - gasp! - found to have praised their own work rather highly.   But in a dark twist that strikes right at the heart of a debate currently raging in the literary world, it was also discovered that at least one well-known author had made wild personal attacks against the people he thought were responsible for posting negative reviews of a friend's book. Again this is not terribly surprising, but in this case the accused were the literary world's favorite bugbears, the Underground Literary Alliance, and their anonymous attacker was revealed to be none other than super-successful memoirist and mini-mogul Dave Eggers.   Calling himself only "a reader from St. Louis" - he lives in San Francisco -  Eggers savagely attacked the ULA on the customer review pages for Heidi Julavits's novel The Effect of Living Backwards. Reached by Harmon, Eggers admitted writing the review, saying "In this case I just tried to bring back some balance."

       I've a bone to pick with you   urlLink Elsewhere on  3AM  , there are those who take issue with the  Evening Standard 's pop critic.  I want to take issue with 'literary critic' David Sexton's column (for the second time in a month).  In today's offering, Sexton discusses (no weblink, of course) the forthcoming  urlLink Get London Reading  initiative of the Mayor, Ken Livingstone.  This is not just another 'Big Read' type affair, its purpose being to promote literature about London in all its forms.  Of course, as is the way these days, there is a  urlLink definitive shortlist  of 12 essential London books (all by living authors and in paperback) to devour and devour it Sexton does.  Sexton's contention is that there  "is no, single, unarguably great novel about contemporary London."  at the moment for readers to  "give a friend from New Zealand or France to read about London"  as apart  "from maybe Ruth Rendell, there aren't even any great crime contenders (Yorkshire and Edinburgh fare better)."  I'm sure Jake Arnott will be pleased with that.  Furthermore  "We have no Dickens today."  I'm sure well all share Sexton's indignation and anxiety at this parlous state of affairs.  History will be the judge however and I'm equally as sure that right now, somewhere in London someone is scribbling away at a book that will fill this over-agonised void.  A few weeks ago, Mr Sexton penned a piece for his London-based paper on how literary websites were becoming more and more important.  Great stuff, I thought, shame the article wasn't online.  And from what country did the sites he mentioned hail from? The US, of course.  I wrote Mr Sexton a polite letter mentioning this and did he bother to reply? Of course he didn't.

"My next book, Ludmila's Broken English, is about immigration and globalisation; two English boys go to Russia and get eaten up by forces beyond their control." But it is his third novel that is particularly exciting the erstwhile fraudster and cocaine addict: "I've found a way to make vulgarity acceptable," he says."

You know what causes sexual thoughts when it's all said and done? ...Here's what causes sexual thoughts... having a dick. ...In the course of our day ANYTHING can cause a sexual fucking thought. You can be on a train, and it's rocking kinda nice. Pants are a little tight. Oh my God, I've got a woody! ...What are we gonna do, ban public transportation? I find it ironic that people who are against sexual thoughts are generally these fundamentalist Christians who also believe you should be fruitful and multiply. It seems like they would support sexual thoughts, you know, perhaps even have a centrefold in the Bible. Miss Deuteronomy. Turn offs: floods, locusts, smokers.  I actually did that joke in Alabama, right. These three rednecks met me after the show, man. 'Hey, buddy! Come here. Hey, Mr Comedian! Come here. Hey, buddy, we're Christians, we don't like what you said.' I said, 'Then forgive me.' It seemed so obvious. You know?"  At the Vic theatre, Chicago, November 1990

Given that Scott is married, one would think this an easy problem to remedy, but the only re-entries that interest him concern his favourite creation, 'Space Man in Space'. King’s smutty, surreal picaresque provides the missing, and heretofore unsought, link between 'Carry On' and 'Monty Python'."

       Suicide Blondes?   urlLink Boing Boing  on the decision of  urlLink Suicide Girls  to betray their  "humble indie dot-com beginnings"  by syndicating with  urlLink Playboy .   urlLink Casino Avenue  gives his commentary:   "I don't know if you're familiar with an "alternative" rude site called Suicide Girls - supposed to be an alternative to crappy Playboy stuff, that kind of thing, and seems to have found the backing of the likes of Dave Grohl and Courtney Love. It's actually not a very pleasant place once you get into it (ie, erm, subscribe) - rumours that it treats its models poorly, and it's full of full of rather reactionary and ignorant Americans, none so reactionary, ignorant and American as its founder. Now here's the icing on the cake - it's teamed up with Playboy. Deary deary me. More, and all the links you'll need, at the work-friendly Boing Boing. You can read more about what really goes on at suicidegirls.com here at a LiveJournal set up to discuss it - it's eye-opening stuff, especially the "free memberships for Israeli soldiers" stuff. Next week, massacre a Palestinian family, get a free webcam sesh with one of the girls. Make love and war, kids.  The moral? Never believe anyone who claims to be on your side until they show it. And no looking at rude internet sites. Ever."

'It still seems like a strange way to make a living, sitting alone in a room for long periods of every day,' he says, 'but that is literally where the work takes shape. I never go out looking for stories to tell; they grow inside me and become a weird compulsion. So, even though the story might change day to day, I know the characters really well, because I've carried them inside my head for years.'"

       Wanted: publicity for Zadie Smith and Nick Hornby  From the  Telegraph 's  urlLink Literary life :   "This month... sees the launch of the "Get London Reading" campaign which has been organised by Booktrust. It is hoped that independent bookshops, as well as most branches of the major chains, in the capital will promote the 12 chosen titles.   The dozen works all feature the Great Wen in some way but the list could have been more imaginative. While Iain Sinclair's London Orbital and Gilda O'Neill's My East End might seem natural selections, do Zadie Smith's White Teeth or Nick Hornby's High Fidelity really need any more publicity?  Maureen Duffy's Londoners, Michael Moorcock's Mother London and Geoff Nicholson's Bleeding London, to pick just three examples of books not on the list, deserve to be read far more widely."

       Blue Monday  I'll understand if you don't share my excitement, but I've  urlLink just read  that there's a new installment of the  Blue Monday  comic coming in April.  This is what they had to say...   AN OPEN LETTER FROM THE BLUE MONDAY CAST RE: THE NEW SERIES  Dear comics reader:  Oni Press is releasing a new BLUE MONDAY series in April. It’s called PAINTED MOON. It’s by that Chynna Clugston-Major person. She’s okay. We like her all right. It’s those sweaty boys at Oni Press that get on our nerves.  First off, we know this is supposed to be a press release, and there actually was one written. That Jamie Rich guy, the whiny one with the big belly and bad hair and like eighteen ulcers, he wrote one and it’s got all these quotes about how excited we are to be doing BLUE MONDAY: PAINTED MOON, to be back after Chynna left us to do her “solo record.” SCOOTER GIRL made us feel like the other members of Bon Jovi when he did that YOUNG GUNS soundtrack. Not that we would listen to that, but everyone always complains that we don’t like music that anyone has heard of, so we’re compromising here. But we digress…  Oni’s publisher Joe Nozemack stepped away from his desk. I think his martini glass got empty, or he was going to club a baby seal or something. He’s a publisher, and they’re eeeeeevil. So, we hijacked his computer, deleted the marketing hype, and we’re sending this out.  Oni Press doesn’t care about us. To them, we’re dollar signs with legs, arms, and, in Clover’s case, big boobs. (Alan made us write that part. Stupid Alan.) When it came time to plan PAINTED MOON, we said we wanted to be involved more in planning this stuff out. We wanted to be able to grow. There are only so many times we can come back and make jokes about the boys being stupid and Clover’s big boobs. We want more character stuff. It doesn’t have to be Shakespeare, but how about a little MY SO-CALLED LIFE? Or at least a very special episode of THE O.C.!  But nooooo…they didn’t want that. “Sex,” Nozemack said, and swear to God, we heard a cash register sound in his head. “Bodily functions,” Rich insisted, all the while touching himself in a place we won’t mention. “Honey,” said James Lucas Jones…but, after all, he is a bear with very little brain.  We protested, but then Joe got our contracts out. They own Chynna lock, stock, and barrel, and Chynna owns us…so we’re stuck.  So, if you like that teen sex comedy stuff, you’re going to L-O-V-E the new series. BLUE MONDAY: PAINTED MOON. It’s got four issues. It starts in April. In it, Bleu discovers certain things about puberty that she might not have realized, and we learn a thing or two about Victor and why there is suddenly hair on his palms, too. (Victor said, “Shut up!” But we’re typing, not talking, so how exactly can we “shut up”?) And don’t worry, for those of you who agree with us and want more character development, who want depth—well, you know us. We’re clever. Comics editors are stupid. We’ll sneak some of it in there, trust me.  Sincerely,  Bleu, Clover, Victor, Alan, & Monkeyboy   You can read an interview with  Blue Monday  creator Chynna Clugston-Major in the excellent  Uppers  zine  urlLink here , with  urlLink more  in the notable  Borderline .

       Mount Rushmore revisited   3AM  old timers may remember an idea I once had and aired, of doing some sort of  3AM  banner thing with all the  3AM  editors/regular contributors' mugs on it. At the time it failed for various reasons but I'd like to take up this brilliant, provocative and amphibious (?)  artistic project again, so here's the deal:  Would you be so kind as to send me a pic of your face, one you like, not necesssarily an ID one but preferably, or at least one with a light background. I doesn't have to be very high def, but the lighting should be good (that is not too dark). Alternatively, you can also send me a URL where I can find a pic of you, this would actually save time.  It will be so beautiful you won't believe it.   cheers G.

       This Is Not A Love Song, apparently  Those friends of  3AM  at  urlLink The Aquarium  send details of their next event:   I Hate Your Guts! A Celebration of Love, Confusion, Sex and Fantasy   14th Feb - 6th March   Sat 14th Feb 6,30pm - 9pm   A mixed exhibition, mostly of items from The Aquarium stock of rare & curious printed matter.... but we will also be presenting to the world a few new things made exclusively for the gallery, as follows:    Billy Childish: I Have Cheated My Own Hart   A limited edition set of (mostly) pornographic woodcuts that Billy originally did back in the 80’s. Also included will be a lavishly produced handmade book featuring a fantastic extract from Billy’s forthcoming novel: “Sex Crimes of the Futcher”. These will be housed in a cloth covered archival box with a silk screen design on the cover. Only 10 sets will be made for sale.  We will also be printing a limited edition of the cover design as 100 signed & numbered screen prints.    Scorpion Thunderbolt of the 21st Century: Enclave of Love CD Single   STOT21stC are a terrible terrible band and this is their first release. Stupidly shy of vocals, they’ve got Power Pack in to do a stint on this one, leaving them to concentrate on their barrage of insane noise with a slight nudge & a wink towards some kind of warped pop sensibility. In true Aquarium style this will be a limited edition of only 50 copies, all hand packaged and complete with the Scorpion Thunderbolt ‘Rule Book’, sticker and snapshot. The two tracks on the CD will also be available for free download on their website www.scorpionthunderbolt.com    The Prada-Meinhof Gang: Submission Ltd Edition DVD   Of only ‘Goddess No.11’ editions, this DVD exclusively produced for The Aquarium and all water lovers is The Prada-Meinhof Gang’s take on what is generally agreed to be the Sex Pistols only ever love song: ‘Submission’.  Originally a film installation, this homage to Millai’s Ophelia reconstructs the song from the ground up, complete with an entire orchestral production and set to haunting visuals. The Prada-Meinhof Gang ask you to remember that Ophelia - Hamlet’s sick sister - is from a play in which the principle character - Hamlet - obsesses endlessly, forever contemplating suicide and madness - yet it is the female character of Ophelia who truly enacts both.  The 11 DVD packages will be given to chosen people at the opening party by The Prada-Meinhof Gang.    T-Shirts   We will be making three t-shirts ( ‘I Hate Your Guts!’, ‘Romeo’, & ‘Break Here To Enter’) for this exhibition, all of which have been exclusively designed for The Aquarium. Again, only limited numbers of these will be available.    Poetry  Tim Wells and Sarah Kobrinsky of ‘Rising’ & ‘Dripping’ fame will be reading some of their love poems at the opening party and free print-outs of the poems will be available for you to give to loved ones.   The Aquarium  10 Woburn Walk  London WC1H  United Kingdom  020 7387 8417   open: 11am - 6pm Mon - Sat  Nearest Tube: Euston

       It's just not cricket, old chap  There's  urlLink controversy brewing  at the Literary Society and it's not because there's a shortage of port.  Lord Armstrong, a non-author and principal headbanger-in-chief under Margaret Thatcher's premiership (that's Cabinet Secretary to you), has been elected President of the esteemed body.  Armstrong, who invented the much used phrase "economical with the truth" apparently, is somewhat out of favour as the chief proponent of banning of former MI6 agent Peter Wright's memoirs,  Spycatcher  during the 1980s.  Even (Sir) Peregrine Worsthorne was moved enough to make an outburst.  What surprises me is that such a body exists -- we aren't  3AM  invited to be members I wonder? You'll be telling me there's a Royal Society of Literature next.  Oh,  urlLink there is .  I bet it's all anarchy and debauchery with those two -- real  urlLink Champagne anarchism  in fact.

       The most hypocritical crawler in literary London  An excerpt from Whitbread Book of the Year nominee DJ Taylor in this week's  New Statesman  Diary ( urlLink site  subscription only however):   "Two years back, I reviewed, unenthusiastically, a work by Novelist X. Unexpectedly, the book stuck in my head: whole episodes, lines of dialogue and incidental effects wandered there for months on end. I brooded on it, recalled the names of its characters, saw its cover staring at me from every shelf. Eventually, just before Christmas, I reread it, formed an entirely different view of its achievements and felt thoroughly ashamed of myself. What do you do in such circumstances? I decided to write to Novelist X in a suitably humble manner, owning up to this sad lapse in judgement. The letter sent, I discovered that X sits on the Whitbread jury, and probably now thinks me the most hypocritical crawler currently nosing the floors of literary London."

       It's Grim Up North London  Reader, disparager of the small press and self-appointed critic Mark Durham emails in:   "You think it's clever to knock the likes of Dave Eggers and Zadie Smith all the time, you are simply envious of their status and rank.  Far from not representing a coterie, 3am seems only too well to represent a certain set of young British novelists -  urlLink Dan Rhodes ,  urlLink Matt Thorne ,  urlLink Daren King ,  urlLink Tony White  and  urlLink Toby Litt,  for instance as well as people like The Idler and Smoke.  It's just Londoners and their websites.  Don't put people down, just because they have the edge on you."   I don't think  3AM  sets out to 'represent' anyone.  We have stuff on the site by New Puritan authors sitting cheek-by-jowl with Stewart Home and Billy Childish.  The Underground Literary Alliance sit nicely with Paul Auster.  If it happens that way, then so be it.  It's what post-punk is all about.

       London: not for everyone, apparently  Over at  urlLink the main  3AM  site  today, there's an interview by Mancunian sort HP Tinker with local literary starlet  urlLink Gwendoline Riley , who's been described as a  "Camus in hot-pants"  by all accounts.  I remember a  Time Out  feature on her a year or so ago where she reckoned London wasn't up to much as a place to live.  OK, Paris it is then!  In positive disagreement with this assertion would be  urlLink Diamond Geezer , the inspirational blogger of all things London and, fortunately, even then of an East End bent.  Geezer (as he may or may not like to be known) posted a substantial entry (by way of a plug) for Jude Rogers' excellent  urlLink  Smoke   magazine, with issue 3 now hitting the usual stockists.  Geezer also discusses in a parallel context to my own recent offering here the  urlLink  London News Review  , with whom I have been corresponding with the editors of.  Paul Carr (who writes a  urlLink weekly new media column  in the  Grauniad , keeping the homefires burning in a sceptical media scornful of "dot coms") was at pains to point out that despite its title, the  London News Review  is not London-centred but is more a news review that just happens to be published in London.  Happy to correct my mistake, of course.  Paul also points me towards  urlLink technorati.com , which now enables me to see what kind things people are saying about  3AM  on their blogs.  Apparently it's how he came across  3AM 's existence and naturally I'm shocked and appalled that he wasn't aware of us previously.  And in their own  urlLink literary blog , there's some commentary on how often  The Grauniad  publish pieces on Hazlitt.  Not enough, says  urlLink one  of  3AM 's editors.  But the whole technorati thing has prompted me to undertake a revamp of our blogroll, which was created in 2002, when blogging was the sole preserve of 9/11 crackpots and chickenhawk sorts (and pissed-up literary sorts).  Oh, and that reminds me, there's a new  urlLink  Idler   out soon, containing as it does their new 'Ladies of Leisure' poll.  Their site also gives mention of a new phase of  urlLink Crap Towns  nominations -- my London-dwelling Northerner animosity will be directed at Middlesbrough this time, a sorry excuse for a university, football team and place to live.

       How do you sleep?  I've been having trouble sleeping of late ( "Hey!" , indignant Joe Bloggs reader cries,  "I didn't think it was that sort of blog!" ) for some reason, generally it's a case of slouching up the three flights of stairs to the top of  3AM  Towers overlooking Whitechapel High Street and falling flat onto the duvet, but I've been, quite frankly, under-doing it the past few nights.  So a nip of Nairi (Armenian brandy) seems to do the trick and any readers having the same problem would be advised to get hold of some.

       Worst post, ever!  Following on from my post on the  London News Review , a reader writes  "Your blog is just a load of anal-retentive contrarian whinging"  (yeah, and I love you too, 'Mark Durham').  I guess if you didn't know me, it would be easy to visualise me as some kind of Comic Book Guy off  The Simpsons  type who likes nothing better than sit behind a PC and write  "Worst publication, ever!"  over and over again.  Of course, I don't see myself that way and by all accounts neither do those who know and work with me, I just believe in the right of people to take others to account for their actions.  The press, in all its manifestations, is not exempt from this in my view and who better to scrutinise its performance than the media itself.    However, this got me thinking.  Not into the realms of the tired 'What is blogging all about?' introspection but more along the lines of authorship.  What makes someone worth reading? What makes readers view certain writers as 'must-read' on a regular basis? For instance, I couldn't care less if John Pilger had his fingers blown off by a CIA-planted letter-bomb and could never write another  New Statesman  column again.  But I would be beyond despair if Boris Johnson suddenly decided to go live in Rwanda, never picked up a pen again and merely took advantage of his own  Spectator  subscriptions to Africa appeal (for those of you who don't read it,  The Spectator  allow readers to pay for African villages to receive the magazine free of charge.  I'm sure if I lived in Sudan I'd have better things to worry about that what Simon Heffer thinks of political correctness).  I don't agree with either writer's viewpoint, but why is Boris indispensable while Pilger is merely indefensible? Both writers usually tackle the same subject (the motives of Tony Blair in any given situation) and come up with diametrically-opposing conclusions ("Blair is a fascist" or "Blair is a communist", respectively).  Yet Boris Johnson manages to at least display a modicum of wit and engagement, while Pilger merely churns out autofeed-style conspiracy theories on a weekly basis.  Another writer I've never 'got' is Rod Liddle.  I don't think any of us would have heard of him had he not been forced into an ultimatum by his BBC employer concerning his temporary stint at  The Guardian 's G2 section.  Again, I'm assuming a certain amount of prior knowledge here on your part so I'll fill in (skip the next bit if you can't be arsed).  Rod Liddle was Editor of BBC Radio 4's  Today  programme who was given the chance to be a temporary fill-in at the  Guardian .  In one of his columns he remarked that the presence of the Countryside Alliance on the streets of London should remind us all while, despite their manifold and manifest failings, the Labour Party still deserved to remain in place to keep the Tories out, Tories in this case being exemplified by the fox-hunting scum who marched so brazenly to defend their sick tradition (I'm paraphrasing here of course, but you get the point).  Standard fare for a liberal elite columnist (giving the punters what they want etc).  As such, this was cited as yet another example of left-wing bias at the Beeb and his employer forced him to choose between the two (you or I would have been sacked however).  And how did he respond to this? With the most cringe-bearing headline to a newspaper column I have ever seen --  urlLink 'Reader, I chose you...'  (you can't see me now, but I'm doing the fingers-down-throat gesture). So where we supposed to be grateful or something?  "Oh no, Rod Liddle's not writing for  The Guardian  anymore! Where will I get my weekly dose of received opinion? Only two more days until the  New Statesman  comes out, phew!"   Anyhow, I think I've doled out enough stick to other parts of the media for a while now, so unless more email is forthcoming I'll terminate the discussion here.  Not to worry, anyhow, not long after that email there was one from an ex-girlfriend, telling me to blog less and write more.

       Indie Obscura Day 2  It's Monday and that can only entail one thing... Indie Obscura Day! Today's anal-retentive fest comes courtesy of Eat.  I can't really wax lyrical for my love of this band for the simple reason that it never existed.  I once bought a 12" of theirs on spec purely because it was in the 99p section of The Hit Parade in Hartlepool and to be honest I might as well have just dropped a pound coin down a drain compared to the joy it brought to my stereo (ie. none).  Anyhow, here's the obligatory facts...  allmusic.com entry:  "Formed in the King's Cross area of London by several natives of Bath, Eat mixed hard rock, swampy blues-rock, Jim Morrison-esque poetry, and dance beats to create a singular hybrid. Eat's original lineup was fronted by vocalist/songwriter Ange Dolittle, with brothers Paul and Max Nobel on guitar and a rhythm section of Tim Sewell (bass) and Pete Howard (drums). The group built a following on London's underground scene, with Sewell and Paul Nobel frequently DJing parties on the side. Eat signed with the Fiction imprint and, after a couple of EPs, debuted on LP in 1989 with the acclaimed Sell Me a God. However, by November 1990, the band had split up as a result of both the Nobels' splitting with the rest of the band and Dolittle's heroin habit; a completed follow-up LP never saw the light of day. In 1991, Dolittle re-formed Eat with a new guitar tandem of Jem Moorshead and Max Lavilla. The band recorded the more psychedelic Epicure in 1993, which was released in the U.S. the following year. When Eat failed to draw audiences on their supporting American tour, Dolittle again broke up the band and joined the instrumental portion of the Wonder Stuff to form We Know Where You Live in 1995."    Little-known factoid:  Not only could you buy their 12" singles for 99p in Hartlepool's Hit Parade, you could also get them for the same price in Stockton-on-Tees' Tracks record shop too.  Records from the likes of Airhead and Sensitize could also be bought in those fabled 'pound sections'.   Where now?:  Lead singer Ange Dolittle last seen fronting Big Yoga Muffin.  With a name like that, they deserved not to be successful.

       The return of Lunchtime O'Booze  In the Bricklayer's Arms today (the arty hang-out in Hoxton, not the rough dive in Sarf Landan) I couldn't help but notice (as they were on every available surface) that copies of the recently-launched  urlLink  London News Review   are being given away there,  gratis .  I know the paper's offices are spitting distance away, but your average punter is not going to cough up for a subscription to the thing if they can just swan into a pub and read it in five minutes flat over a pint of Stella.  One meejah type I know reckons the paper will  urlLink go the same way as  The Face  , but in less time and with fewer people noticing.  Let's ignore that comment and assume they're going to have a long and fruitful existence -- this post is a kind of 'critical friend' to them.  By all accounts, they work from one of those converted industrial space units cum meejah operations off Brick Lane, so I suppose I should champion business in my locale.  My first impression of the publication is that it's a bit matey-matey and seems to celebrate its own existence a tad too much.  Someone really should point this out to them, as while they may enjoy the process of celebrating themselves ( "Whehay! We write stuff!" ), they do have to make a profit for someone and prospective readers might not be particularly interested in their existence as people in themselves.  I may be wrong, but to me it seems to the extension of a few second-rate  Grauniad -sters who feel that they deserve more than an online presence for their journalism.  It's also the extension of the all-too-familar London meejah conversation of  "You know, there's a gap in the market for a fresh London paper of some description..." .  Such conversations usually end with the shrugging of shoulders and then move on to an argument over whose round it is.  Here however, it's ended up as a tangible product.  Fair play to them, you might say, it's all very well for you sat there on your PC ploughing your furrow with your NDJDC (non-day-job-dot-com), at least they've gone out there and done something.  Yes, well, erm, but... OK, for a start, the producers of the paper  urlLink seem  to have spent  urlLink more time talking  about the need for their paper and  urlLink the trials and tribulations  of publishing than actually publishing it.  Perhaps their editor should just take over the  Guardian  media section or something, his heart seems more into that.  Secondly, there's the hyperbole:   "Each issue provides a complete round-up of the week's news, combining behind-the-scenes analysis of the major (and not so major) stories, interviews with prominent newsmakers, and irreverent commentary from some of Britain?s finest and funniest writers. It is sharp, thought-provoking, opinionated, influential and absolutely indispensable."    Obviously, in sales and marketing terms, no publication worth their salt is going to say  "We're a bit crap really"  (I fully confess that  3AM  could do with a make-over in some areas...) but I'm not sure if any publication is fit to pass judgement on themselves in such a way.  The fact that they have to do it and don't have anyone to do it for them suggests they should keep quiet until there's a few more issues to compare.  For what it's worth, the issue I came across is better than I expected (some good political pieces in there, as well as media commentary), though the blatant plug afforded to Tory mayoral candidate Steve Norris jarred a little.  I'm not sure it's their role to do anything other than bash him, not give him the an opportunity for publicity and hits on his website, but there appears to be some political ambiguity there (ie. stock anti-US tirades sit cheek-by-jowl with championing of a blogging Labour MP who happens to be the most ardent Iraq war supporter in Parliament).  Thirdly, there's the associated products,  urlLink The Friday Thing  (more matey-mateyness and not funny) and  urlLink London by London  (an 'interesting concept' which has, in turn, descended into a Mayor Ken-bashing platform for fans of the oleaginous Lib Dem candidate Simon Hughes or the annoyingly smug Green Party hopeful Darren Johnson).  So what are the portents for the  LNR ? Difficult to say really, they appear to have enlisted the  urlLink ICA  as major advertisers and stockists but beyond that, are they making any in-roads outside of the media elite? Not having access to their circulation figures, I can't pass judgement on that score.  What I can say though, is as a non-media elite person in their key demographic (I'm a single late 20s male with a disposable income and no mortgage), I'd rather read fresh writing about London from complete unknowns rather than celebrity twaddle from TV comedians whose careers have peaked.  Time for another Stella I think.

       Less is Moore   urlLink The Bookseller  column of this week's  Guardian  Review contains an entry on our friends at  urlLink Soft Skull Press  today:   "A small US publisher, Soft Skull Press, is relishing the publicity after HarperCollins demanded that it change the title of one of its books. How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office, a collection of essays edited by William Upski Wimsatt, might be confused with Michael Moore's bestseller Stupid White Men, HC alleged; "Accordingly, we demand that you eliminate the phrase Stupid White Men from the title of Mr Wimsatt's book prior to publication."  HC now says that the issue is settled. It's too late: Soft Skull saw an opportunity to get coverage, and it has not been disappointed. The US press has enjoyed the story particularly because HC and Moore (who is published in the UK by Penguin) fell out when the company put publication of Stupid White Men on hold following September 11. Moore's comment on the current controversy is: "It is kind of strange that a publisher that first tried to squash my book is now trying to defend their economic interest now that it is a bestseller.""

       You can put your tongue away now, boy   urlLink Puff piece  in today's  Grauniad  concerning the love-in between Dave Eggers and Zadie Smith (Nick Hornby likes to watch, apparently).  I've always wondered if, secretly, Alex Garland and Zadie Smith donate their sperm/eggs to create a new generation of uber-hip publishers' wet dreams -- somewhere in W1 there's a firm of graphic designers already working on the dust jacket imagery as I write this, while these precocious babies are awaiting intensive tuition of some description.  Anyhow, back to the plot... author Gordon Burn attempts to place all of this into a milieu of some description and is at pains to create literary parallels:   "Clive James once famously responded to the criticism that he only ever seemed to recommend books written by his friends in the annual, pre-Christmas roundups with the reply that books by his friends were the only books he had time to read. He was mocked for what was taken to be a piece of bare-faced self-aggrandisement. But James was part of the circle that formed around the late Ian Hamilton, the poet, critic and editor of, first, the Review, and then the New Review in Soho in the 60s and 70s. The group included Al Alvarez, James Fenton, Craig Raine, Julian Barnes, Martin Amis and Ian McEwan. And reading the festschrift that was published to celebrate Hamilton's 60th birthday four years ago, it was salutory to be reminded that it hadn't come into existence, fully-formed, as a cohesive, self-lubricating unit of smooth metropolitan movers and shakers. Barnes, for example, describes his humiliation at turning out in what the New Review lags referred to pointedly as his "literary London" suit (it was green velvet). McEwan at the time was living in an attic room in South London.   Along with the other regulars at the Pillars of Hercules pub next door to the NR offices in Greek Street they were carrying on a Grub Street tradition dating back to the clubs and coffee houses of Samuel Johnson's London, the salons of Paris and Bloomsbury, the Algonquin Round Table and the crash pads of the Beats. But the set-up the New Review crowd most nearly emulated was Cyril Connolly and his "friends of promise" at Horizon, which was launched in 1939 on the eve of the second world war and persisted for a decade."    The  urlLink Underground Literary Alliance  won't be impressed, that's for sure.   Update:   the  urlLink Bookslut  herself is also not impressed.

       Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne  A jet-lagged  urlLink Wasco  arrived in London yesterday.  The first I heard of it was when I received a call from him claiming to be a certain former  3AM  Co-Editor who wanted to me take me to task about my latest  ad hominem  Bob Geldof criticism on here! I left him in the  urlLink ICA  for a few hours and when I returned he'd already found musical acquaintances that he didn't even know were in town.  A phonecall to  urlLink George Berger  later and we were all set.  Wasco's in town for  urlLink All Tomorrow's Parties , the electica-fest on the Sussex coast taking place soon and last night was an ATP showcase at the ICA featuring Bardot Pond and Jackie O Motherfucker.  Given the scarcity of tickets for the ATP weekends each year, the ICA staged the event as  "a place to come and feel part of it".  We sat and ate/drank with the bands for a while, George/Gerard stated his desire to resurrect 2002's short-lived  3AM  'Arse of the Week' award (something conceived during a meet-up at the ICA of European  3AM  editors back then).  Given  urlLink recent events , nothing would surprise me on that level.  Soon it became apparent that we were actually sat (by accident) in some kind of opening night for the  urlLink Beck's Futures 2004  show as all manner of celebs (well Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys and  urlLink Alan Yentob ) began milling around as sushi and champagne were paraded on trays held by insouciant-looking arts graduates.  Not quite  urlLink the Saatchi party of the other night , but at least there was people connected to the arts in some way at this one, rather than  urlLink Eastenders actresses  (wot no Max Beesley?).  Bardot Pond were pretty intense, slow... but intense.  I'm not sure Mr Berger was particularly impressed as they didn't really break a sweat or any equipment for that matter, but Wasco was well into it.  I slipped away just before the end and noticed that there was a  urlLink soap actress  in attendance at the Beck's Futures party (albeit one who had at least been in a Woody Allen film and my favourite TV series,  The Bill ).  High and low brow really are converging it seems, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.  I'm in the wrong business... no, wait... speak to my agent, dahling.

       Trouble at mill  Once again,  urlLink MediaBitch nails it  with their biting expose of  Mirror  staff's true feelings about the tacky gossip rag forced on them by the men in suits:   "It seems there’s a little tension in the air at Canary Wharf following the launch of the  Mirror’ s  3am Magazine.   Unlike the  Mirror  itself, the first edition of the magazine bulged with naked flesh. It carried a series of explicit screengrabs of the raunchiest moments from Sex in the City that would never have made it into the newspaper. The phone’s been ringing from angry parents ever since.  One staffer revealed: “We never see them – they’re on a different floor. They don’t seem to understand what the Mirror’s about, but then neither do some of the people in the senior management.”"   Over at  The Independent , former  Mirror  Editor Bill Hagerty  urlLink reveals  similar tensions:   "Following my observations in this space on the  Daily Mirror's 3am Magazine,  I received a most lucid letter from a member of its production staff. Far from, as I wrote, the magazine team believing that the newspaper has totally lost its way, he insisted: "I am inordinately proud to be on this paper." He and other team members saw their role as helping to boost the  Mirror  circulation to back over two million and "trying to revive the spirits of this once-great institution".  In the face of such admirable passion, I concede that I must have been ill-informed on this point."    Oh well, if they're that pissed off, they can always come and work for the  urlLink real 3AM Magazine .  I can guarantee them a pint a week by way of a salary.  A pint of milk, that is.

       Rock With You in SE8  The Rocklands Tourist Board website is  urlLink here .  Deptford/New Cross has an enduring musical heritage that continues to this day.  My favourite anecdote concerns Dire Straits, whose leading light Mark Knopfler lived on Deptford High Street in the 1970s.  Back then, he used to frequent The White Swan pub on Blackheath Hill where all manner of jazz acts played.  Inspired by this he penned 'Sultans of Swing'.  Years later, Dire Straits went on to fame and fortune (though they never seemed to recover from working with Sting on 'Money for Nothing') and The White Swan became a bikers' pub.  One day, a coach-load of nylon anorak-clad Scandinavian Dire Straits fans turned up and in true redneck bar-style, the pool balls stopped mid table and whatever record was playing at the time did likewise.  Their demand of  "Now you must play us 'Sultans of Swing'!"  was met with a rather inevitable response from Chopper and pals.  Or so my mate's brother reckons...

       More ruminations on London pubs  Serial self-publicist and ubiquitous reviewer Toby Young told, tellingly, in his  How to Lose Friends and Alienate People  that his bosses at  Vanity Fair  turned down the opportunity for Mr Young to pen a feature on the role of pubs in literary London.  Today I noticed that the utterly loathsome 'Bad Bob's' bar on Chandos Place, near Covent Garden, is no more.  I always found its existence totally demeritorious, the product of a sad man (in this case, Bob Geldof) dealing with the on-set of middle age by opening a fun pub.  Let's hope it remains closed, although a South African-themed bar (the 'Springbok') appears to have replaced it.

       Indie Obscura Day  In a bid to place as much clear blue water between us and our doppelganger friends at the  urlLink phoney 3am , a new feature at  3AM  will be  Indie Obscura Day , every Monday.  This will be a comprehensive run-down in the form of a tribute to the much-neglected but not forgotten indie stars of yesterday, for whom the royalty cheques always fail to materialise.  First up in this series is Cud, indie superstars of yore, hailing from Leeds in the early 90s.  The  urlLink allmusic.com  synopsis of their career reads:   "Weird humor and eclectic musical parody are the hallmarks of Leeds, England's Cud, an indie-rock group consisting of vocalist Carl "Y.F.B." Puttnam, guitarist/keyboardist Mike Dunphy, bassist William Potter, and Steve "The Infamous Drummer From Cud" Goodwin. The foursome's impetus for founding a band was provided by a discarded drum set happened upon in a junkyard in 1987; just two years later, Cud had built a small northern England fan base and released their debut album, When in Rome, Kill Me. Their early indie singles and compilation/tribute album tracks were collected on 1990's Elvis Belt, and a new LP, Leggy Mambo, appeared later in the year. The singles "Robinson Crusoe" and "Magic" scraped the lower reaches of the British charts, sparking major-label interest; Cud allegedly chose A&M simply because the label had a trumpet in its logo. After a 1991 EP, Cud issued its acclaimed full-length A&M debut, 1992's Asquarius. 1994's Showbiz was released to similarly positive reaction, but the band's eclecticism perhaps made them too difficult to pigeonhole for commercial tastes, and the hoped-for sales success did not materialize."    Little-known factoid:  Cud were once mentioned (alongside Ride) in a Reeves and Mortimer sketch about an anal-retentive newsagent who managed indie bands.   Where now?:  This  urlLink website  pretty much details what they had for breakfast yesterday...

       Champion the Wonder Whore  Wouldn't it be rather ironic if the inconic Catherine Deneuvre was revealed to be the real  Belle de Jour  blogger? If you don't believe the hype,  urlLink Sarah Champion 's story is in  urlLink  The Observer  .  And if you don't subscribe to MediaGuardian's complicated sign-up process, then it's here, in full:   "Ever since I found myself described as a 'wild child' in a local paper as a teenager, I dreaded that one day I would wake up to find paparazzi outside my door. Since then I've published a book of ecstasy drug stories in the wake of Leah Betts's death, briefly dated a well-known TV comedian and shared a spliff with a former member of the Beatles. But it never once occurred to me that what would finally bring the paparazzi to my door would be my use of commas.   It was my punctuation that had me labelled last week as either the most celebrated literary hoaxer of the day - or Britain's most famous call girl. And all because four years ago I wrote an insignificant review of a book called Playing the Moldovans at Tennis, in which I wrote that the author's stunt of presenting a plastic B&Q round table to Moldova's new King Arthur was 'cringe-worthy'.   When last Tuesday I took a leisurely stroll to a San Francisco café it seemed an ordinary Californian day. Then the call came. It was a journalist from the Times. Since Tony Blair had visited my old school, Oakwood, days before, I assumed that he was searching for alumni - perhaps he'd found me through Friends Reunited. Not so.   I would later discover that a whole investigative team was on my trail.  'You do realise everyone is looking for you? You're phenomenal. It's incredible,' he enthused. 'Everybody is talking about you. It has taken me five days to find you.'   'Well,' I laughed, 'San Francisco is an easy place to hide.'   I let him talk, searching for clues as he purred with delight about finally getting to speak to the real Belle De Jour - although, being 6,000 miles from the centre of the hype, I had no idea what he was talking about. Who was he really and who had put him up to this wind-up?   'Can I just ask you, is this a work of fiction or are you a working call girl?' he concluded, with a conspiratorial whisper. A what? My heart missed more than one beat as reality hit, 'Oh fuck, this guy might be serious.'   Only after he hung up, did I discover why he was so excited. Belle De Jour was a website proclaiming itself the 'Diary of a London Call Girl' and guessing the identity of its anonymous writer had become an obsession among the media and bloggers since it was revealed that she had signed a 'six-figure' book deal.   So Thursday morning saw me share the front page of the Times with Gordon Brown's Budget. And inside, across two pages, was the newspaper's verdict: I was either a fraud or a whore.   I want to make it clear that not only have I never been a call girl - which will especially please my mother, who has had journalists calling on her Manchester home - but I am not the author of the Belle de Jour net diary.   I have not lived in London since 1999 and, far from a predilection for manicures, Gucci and French affectations, many will testify to my dedication to trainers, pints and northern slang. Meanwhile, I'm not big on obsessive daily confessionals, having rarely as a journalist ever written a piece in the first person. Until now.   'Your commas gave you away,' a mysterious one-line email from the Times man teased me. Only when the paper hit the streets did I discover what he meant. It was all down to punctuation. And a team of journalists who, like Agent Mulder, desperately wanted to believe.   The Times recruited 'the world's foremost literary sleuth' to the cause - Professor Don Foster, or 'Doctor Comma', as he quickly became known in my household. Daft as it sounds, merely to discover the identity of a blogger the paper had gone to the extremes of hiring a New York academic described as the world's number one 'textual Ghostbuster', an expert previously brought in to study Monica Lewinsky's writings.   In his book Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous, he describes his successes. He is credited with confirming the authenticity of the Unabomber and unveiling Joe Klein, the author of Primary Colors. In my case, the Times boasted it took Foster 'just 20 minutes to discover what Britain's literary establishment had missed'. Belle and I apparently shared a unique 'linguistic fingerprint'.   The clues were in the way I used my 'brackets, dashes, compound verbs and italics'. Dr Comma noticed that Belle had used the word 'cringe-worthy', which he considered an unusual hyphenation, and the phrase 'suffice to say'. Using his unique skills, he entered these clues into Google. Fewer than 200 webpages in the world contained both. Like Belle, I had once used them - in a travel book review when working for Amazon.co.uk.   On this evidence, I found myself besieged at my San Francisco apartment while my parents were being pursued by reporters posing as delivery men. 'While no piece of evidence is conclusive by itself, I'm sure we have found our woman,' Foster told the Times.   He backed up his findings with 'internal biographical evidence, that sealed my fate'. I had once lived within a mile of the A23 and had Yorkshire connections (I own the house in Mytholmroyd where Ted Hughes was born). In a recent entry in Belle De Jour's weblog, her boyfriend had flown to San Diego. My partner was in San Francisco.   How could I be anyone other than the real Belle De Jour? By way of Moldova, West Norwood and California, she and I will be forever linked."

       Exclusive: 3am interview with Will Self   urlLink 3am  was given the opportunity to chat with leading author Will Self recently following the London Book Fair.  Here's what he had to say...  3am: What's your favourite colour? Will: I tend not to think of  a colour  but more of  colours , as such.  Red is immediately recalled as the crimson fluid that flows directly through the pulsating aorta of Ballard's 1970s works, for instance, whereas black could be seen as a direct link to the more macabre elements of 1980s New York gay society.  Of course, New Labour has considerably diluted the ability of the colour red to arouse even the slightest modicum of socialist fervour in the modern age.  3am: What's the last record you bought? Will: Well it depends what you mean by 'bought' really.  Such a word can be associated with all manner of commercial exchange.  A commercial transaction took place the other day when I purchased Beyonce's album for my son, Lex, but to consider my own musical taste begats an inquiry into a less recent era.  I believe it may have been something by John Cage, circa 1987.  3am: What did you have for breakfast this morning? Will: I fail to see the significance of such a question.  However, as you ask, it was lightly-toasted bread and marmalade.  3am: Do you think the Spice Girls will get back together? Will: Again, I fail to witness the significance in your line of enquiry.  But as you ask, yes, I think they probably will.  3am: If you could change anything about yourself what would it be? Will: The validity of this question perplexes me.  Are you suggesting a conscious surgical procedure or transmogrification by another means?  3am: You what? Err...

       We've only just begun  Remember how (according to Mirror Group Newspapers Legal Department's Marcus Partington):   "Obviously you have not experienced any significant problems to date. You refer to some confusion between the Mirror's 3am Girls and your business but suggest that your problems now arise because of our pull out magazine, which in any event uses 3am in stylised fashion with the bottom of the 3 forming a devil's tail. The word magazine is not prominent. The pull out is not for sale or given away separately but comes free with the Daily Mirror on Wednesdays.  In the light of this, even if you had established a reputation and goodwill exclusively in the name 3am (which cannot be right given our much more widely circulated use of the name) I cannot see how, as a result of this use, any consumer or supplier of yours could be confused into thinking that our " 3AM" publication is connected with yours. Our pull out is aimed at a different readership (people interested in celebrity showbiz gossip) and takes a different route to the market, being available free with a national tabloid daily newspaper. Your magazine, on the other hand, only appears to be available online and is aimed at readers who are interested in literary fiction and other articles of a particular type and advertisers who are interested in reaching such readers.   I find it difficult to believe that these two markets overlap at all. Indeed even if they do, I doubt that either your readers or, in particular, your suppliers, who would be well-educated in the type of services you offer, could be confused into thinking that there was any association between us.  Although we have only recently become aware of your publication, I have never been informed of any instances of confusion between our business and yours.  In all the circumstances, I am convinced that you do not have any valid cause for complaint about 3AM or the 3AM pull out."   Our good friends at  urlLink Nominet  say otherwise.  They reckon that on 10 March, a  urlLink 3ammagazine.co.uk  was registered by Trinity Mirror Digital Media Ltd.  So we are hardly guilty of over-reacting or over-egging of any puddings when we say it simply isn't on.  My only hope is that someone looking for the latest on Jordan or J-Lo accidently types in .com and gets more than they bargained for (or not, as the case may be).  I had hoped it was all over but it looks as if it's only just begun...  Meanwhile, over in the  urlLink parallel universe :   "THE midweek blues are a thing of the past now that our sassy 3am Magazine hits the streets every Wednesday. It mayh be handbag-sized, but it's still bursting with celebrity chat, hot gossip, star style secrets and beauty tips.  IN next week's issue - FREE with the Daily Mirror - we get the lowdown on dynamic duo Ant and Dec.  We reveal the woman who spent £23,000 to look like Victoria Beckham and how TV presenter Nadia Sawahla battled the bulge. Plus we chat with 21 Grams star Naomi Watts.  WE'VE sexy shots of Simon from Blue, Heartbeat's Tricia Penrose tells us where she loves to hang out, and celebrity make-up artist Jemma Kidd shares her top tips for looking fantastic.  SO if you want even more of your favourite showbiz column, don't miss Wednesday's fantastic 3am Magazine!"

       From having  it  large to having  them  large  I have, thus far, shown about as much interest in  urlLink award-winning  blog  urlLink Belle de Jour  as I do in the antics of Shane Ritchie or Darren Day.  To even the most untrained eye, it could only ever have been the work of a media insider, a broadsheet journalist perhaps.  As such, the identity of the anonymous call-girl blogger has  urlLink vexed the minds  of Fleet Street's  urlLink finest , with speculation rife as to who the blogger might be.  So imagine my surprise when it was  urlLink revealed today  as none other than  urlLink Sarah Champion , chronicler of the e'd up chemical generation and author of many chemical pulp stories herself back then.  Back in the day (1996, to be precise) I had little time for Ms Champion's anthologies of chemical pulp, though one of my housemates at uni purchased them religiously, much to our amusement.  But subsequently, it was explained to me that she'd only intended to have around 5000 of them printed and not to make much of a splash -- as opposed to unwittingly sparking off an entire genre that may be pored over by literary theorists in 30 years hence but means precious little right now.  Sarah is a good friend of Gwen Bowers, who came all the way from San Francisco with her photographer friend Jenn, just to visit the  urlLink 3am Magazine Xmas Bash  in late December last year.  Gwen and Sarah both hang out at San Francisco's Edinburgh Castle literary cafe, which is run by Alan Black, who interviewed another of the city's British literary ex-pat residents,  urlLink Irvine Welsh , for  3AM  recently.  All interesting, anyhow.  I wonder how many  urlLink hacks  will be screaming  "We knew it all along!"  now? And if it isn't her, then so what? Get a life and leave her to hers.

       Bowing to the inevitable...  OK, the  Mirror  didn't capitulate and it still insists on publishing that infernal gossip rag.  We didn't galvanise public opinion to our cause and force riots at their offices in Canary Wharf tower.  And  The Sun  simply wasn't up for facilitating a drinking contest between the real  3AM Magazine  and the 3am Girls to settle on who gets to keep the name once and for all.  Murdoch and co. just didn't have the stomach to take on their biggest rival.  So we will concede defeat and accept the fact that the  Mirror 's corporate cock has jizzed all over our collective faces.  From hereon in, when someone says '3am', others will think they mean a  "cheap and tacky, and generally a bit naff"  gossip rag rather than  "the web’s best litzine"  or  "an online Fitzrovia" .  Such is life, I'm afraid.  The not-the-"Oo-ah" urlLink  Daily Star   site features an interesting take on yesterday's fake  3am Magazine :    "According to the  Daily Mirror ’s TV ads, a "super glossy  3AM magazine  is free" with today’s issue.  Trades description should be on to them like a shot.  Super it ain't, and glossy? It isn’t even a distant poverty-stricken hick second cousin to  Heat  magazine.  But hey! It’s free in today's  Mirror , complete with a  3AM Hits CD  (speak to your newsagent if it's not there).  Belt out the wicked tunes like, Meat Loaf's Dead Ringer For Love, and the yet-to-be released for a thousandth time, It's Not Unusual by new talent Tom Jones.  Inside the rag, it's more and more low-grade celeb nonsense, making  MegaStar  look like James Joyce's  Ulysses.   Strong-jawed horsey royal type, Zara I've-Got-Posh-Teeth Phillips gets page three turned over to her romps at Cheltenham.  But no shock horror about Zara in the jockey’s whey-hey-hey-ing room, more the fact she wore something similar at last year’s jump festival.  A hat, and er, some boots.  Best fish the "super glossy"  3AM  mag out of the bin, then."   Jesus, if it makes  them  look like Joyce's  Ulysees  then what does it make us look like? Pretty fucking good I'd say.   urlLink Piers Morgan , you're a fraud and you'll be editing  Bus World  by the time you're fifty, take it from us, mate.  So unless anyone else has anything to say, that's the last word from us on the subject.  You won't find Jordan or  urlLink Peter Andre  here.

       Pop Will Eat Itself  The anti- Mirror  backlash continues apace.  This week's  urlLink  Private Eye   contains an interesting item in its 'Street of Shame' section:   "IT IS only four months since Piers "Morgan" Moron launched his TV series  The Importance of Being Famous  by attacking the "media-fuelled vacuum of C-grade celebrity nonsense".  As he asked: "What is wrong with us? We are getting so obsessed by these people laughably called stars that we are developing quite scary levels of celebrity psychosis."    So how is the  Daily Mirror  doing its bit to reduce the psychosis level? Why, by launching a weekly  3am Magazine  two weeks ago.  So far, we have learned that Kerry McFadden's hubby Bryan wears pink nail varnish, that former Spice Girl Emma Bunton doesn't like faddy diets and that Victoria Beckham recently bought some grapes in Marks & Spencer.  Last November Piers claimed that nothing better exemplified "the strange, fame-gripped state our nation is now in" that the fact that people from  Pop Idol  are thought newsworthy.  So what did we find in last week's  3am Magazine?  A two-page spread with "25 amazing facts" about, er,  Pop Idol ."   While we couldn't have put it better ourselves, the fact that other media outlets are starting to concentrate so much fire on a  3am Magazine  [sic.] surely exposes the Trinity Mirror's solictors claim that  "I am convinced that you do not have any valid cause for complaint about 3AM or the 3AM pull out."  to nothing short of utter ridicule.  As someone pointed out to me, if a boyband came along called Slipknot then the real Slipknot might have just cause to argue that the confusion arising between the two could be embarassing for the band and its fans.  I feel a strong letter coming on...

       More Middle London bilge courtesy of the M25  Daily Mail    3AM 's on-going spat with the  urlLink Trinity Mirror Group  is a war on many fronts.  One personal front is my on-going irritation at the decline of another newspaper, the London  urlLink  Evening Standard  .  The  Standard , as I've mentioned on here before, is the capital's only daily paper -- unless you count  urlLink  Metro   (the free paper given to commuters).  The  Standard  and  Metro  are owned by  urlLink Associated Newspapers , home of the dreaded  urlLink  Daily Mail   (reactionary rag, home to reactionary columnists Simon Heffer and Melanie Phillips).  Others at  3AM   urlLink have written  of their own loathing for the  Standard  and Hari Kunzru's refusal of a  Mail -sponsored literary award is well-known.  The content for all three titles verges on the identical -- scaremongering over the Atkins Diet, asylum-seekers and the Congestion Charge.  The  Standard , like its organ of Middle England sibling the  Mail , now exists to promote a hegemonic vision of how others should lead their lives -- no deviation in moral standards and deference to celebrities and the Establishment.  The London the  Standard  represents and promotes differs marginally from the Middle England the  Mail  attempts to preserve.  Unlike readers of the  Mail , the  Standard 's readership are more likely to have black and gay acquaintances, therefore the prejudice is toned down immediately and the political coverage tends to concentrate on Mayor-bashing and opining about Council Tax rises.  So the London of the  Standard  is the London of Zadie Smith, Tony Parsons and Nick Hornby -- safe, recognisable and slightly more 'street' than the  Mail 's Middle England triumvirate of Jilly Cooper, Ken Follett and Andy McNabb.  While the  Mail 's readers are likely to opt for a Sunday visit to the garden centre, the  Standard 's key demographic prefers a warm goat's cheese salad in All Bar One before watching the rugby -- compare the coverage of Jonny Wilkinson to that of Alan Titchmarsh.  Today's  Standard  comes with a free  urlLink 'Best Pubs in London'  guide -- a nice gesture to the capital's drinking classes, you might argue.  Au contraire, my friend.  The guide is front-loaded with a best of the Oirish pubs section -- topical given that it's St Patrick's Day tomorrow and every reader is guaranteed a free pint of Guinness, thanks to the  Standard  (just don't forget to raise your glass to a Steve Norris victory in the June mayoral elections).  That'll be good for the Craic then -- fortunate given that pubs in Dublin's Temple Bar are banning parties of English people these days.  The rest of the guide contains the run-down on 'historical pubs', 'pubs that rock' and 'gay and lesbian pubs' (that's the 'diversity' box ticked then -- can you imagine a  Mail  guide of this sort with that in though?) -- with some glaring omissions.  The historical pubs section wilfully neglects the likes of The Fitzroy Tavern and Gordon's wine bar, whereas the pubs that rock section fails to live up to its name by not mentioning either The Ship or The Intrepid Fox on Wardour Street.  There's no All Bar One/Pitcher and Piano/Slug and Lettuce... but most  Standard  readers will know where they are already... and then I noticed, most of the pubs are located around West London.  Just gives me another excuse to dislike the place, I suppose.  Anyhow, that Ken Livingstone... he's a right extremist/up Tony Blair's arse and as for that Atkins Diet, it gives you Cancer apparently.

       Franz Ferdinand interviewed on 3am!  Unfortunately it's  urlLink  that 3am  ...  Meanwhile,  urlLink Media Bitch UK  concur with us on the poor taste of the 3am Girls' foray into the CD compilation world:   "Covermount CDs are always something of a surprise when you remove them from your favourite magazine title, ripping the magazine as you go. But the quality of the little silver discs you find attached to, or inside, your favourite publications is frankly getting ridiculous.  Normally you can recognise at least some of the selected hits.  Maybe Media Bitch is getting a little past her prime, but she didn’t notice a single “hit” on Glamour magazine’s latest Glamour Hits package – just a series of album tracks that didn’t quite make the grade.  As for the latest CD to come with the recently launched 3am Magazine, music to dance to in suburban nightclubs was not the word. Not a single track from the nineties or noughties – really keeping up with the times, eh, Jessica, Eva and Caroline?"

       Getting shafted by the big boys  Below is the response from the Trinity Mirror Group's lawyers, concerning their fake  3am Magazine  [sic.].  Doncha just love the sneering, the whole  "Who the fuck are you?"  attitude? I tell you who we are, we're people who think there's more to life than the perpetuation of a tacky concept of 'glamour' embodied in b-celebs and make-up artistry.  The real  3am Magazine  is all for glamour, but of the more sassy variety.  Anyhow, below is their response:   Dear Mr Stevens  "3AM MAGAZINE"  Thank you for your letters of 3 and 10 March 2004.  I note your concerns regarding our recent launch of our pull-out magazine, "3AM", which is available free inside the "Daily Mirror". However, I really doubt that this pull out will cause you any problems and I believe that you do not have any legal right to object to it.  We first started to use the name "3AM" in the Daily Mirror on 3 July 2000. It was used as the name of a column commenting on the lives of celebrities and show business issues generally. Stories were gathered by our columnists very often from celebrity events and parties carried on until the early morning - hence the choice of name.  You claim to have commenced the internet based magazine "3AM MAGAZINE" ; only three months earlier, in April 2000. I have not been able to find out much about that early use except that it appears to be internationally based (principally in North America and France) and to have used a variety of names such as 3.A.M Publishing and 3.A.M International. It describes itself as " ;edgy" and containing "cutting edge" fiction and "political satire", essays, documentaries and "culture orientated" articles.  Obviously you have not experienced any significant problems to date. You refer to some confusion between the Mirror's 3am Girls and your business but suggest that your problems now arise because of our pull out magazine, which in any event uses 3am in stylised fashion with the bottom of the 3 forming a devil's tail. The word magazine is not prominent. The pull out is not for sale or given away separately but comes free with the Daily Mirror on Wednesdays.  In the light of this, even if you had established a reputation and goodwill exclusively in the name 3am (which cannot be right given our much more widely circulated use of the name) I cannot see how, as a result of this use, any consumer or supplier of yours could be confused into thinking that our " 3AM" publication is connected with yours. Our pull out is aimed at a different readership (people interested in celebrity showbiz gossip) and takes a different route to the market, being available free with a national tabloid daily newspaper. Your magazine, on the other hand, only appears to be available online and is aimed at readers who are interested in literary fiction and other articles of a particular type and advertisers who are interested in reaching such readers.  I find it difficult to believe that these two markets overlap at all. Indeed even if they do, I doubt that either your readers or, in particular, your suppliers, who would be well-educated in the type of services you offer, could be confused into thinking that there was any association between us.  Although we have only recently become aware of your publication, I have never been informed of any instances of confusion between our business and yours.  In all the circumstances, I am convinced that you do not have any valid cause for complaint about 3AM or the 3AM pull out.  Yours sincerely etc etc.

       "Rather cheap and tacky, and generally a bit naff"  Top Scottish leftfield publishers  urlLink Canongate  throw their weight behind  3AM 's struggle against the corporate hegemony of the  Daily Mirror  and their name-stealing gossip rag.   Mirror  Editor Piers Morgan was presenting his 'Tabloid Tales' programme on BBC1 last night, interviewing Simon Cowell.  Morgan fancies himself as a pioneering Fleet Street-era editor and is on a mission to restore the  Mirror  back to its heyday -- viz. his lone tabloid stand against the war in Iraq and support for the Labour Party.  He was recently  urlLink designated   Esquire  magazine's top media man under 40.  Here's what will have landed on his secretary's desk this morning (copied into his bosses too, natch):   Piers Morgan Editor, Daily Mirror One Canada Square London E14 5AP  Dear Mr Morgan  Re: ‘3am Magazine’  Following our letter of 3 March 2004, we note that we have received no response from Trinity Mirror plc regarding the launch of your new 3am Magazine, which you will have noticed bears a striking similarity to the title of our own magazine that has been published continuously since April 2000.  We acknowledge that the ‘3am Girls’ has existed as a concept since July 2000 and while their existence has led to some confusion for those who deal with us, we have always been inclined to dismiss it.  The publication of another 3am Magazine however, was always bound to have more direct consequences for us as a publisher.  We feel that your failure to enter into dialogue with us or to even respond to our correspondence, issued for what most objective outsiders would agree to be understandable reasons, shows a breathtaking degree of arrogance and an unhealthy disdain for the small press by an organisation such as yourselves.  It may be the case that you proceeded with publication of your 3am Magazine (which we now appreciate is part of a strategy to halt declining circulation figures), secure in the knowledge that as a publicly-listed company you had the full back-up to over-ride such inconvenient considerations as someone else of smaller commercial stature actually owning the name.  However, in the longer term, we believe that this decision will ultimately come back to haunt Trinity Mirror as you have merely given succour to your detractors as a publisher of a once reputable tabloid that could hold its head up on Fleet Street as a by-word for campaigning journalism and comment of considerable standards.  We refer you to press coverage elsewhere of the launch of your 3am Magazine.  This decision may have been taken for commercial opportunism in a hostile market for tabloid newspapers, but you also have to be held accountable for your ethical conduct as a journalist.  As such, your victory on this occasion is merely pyrrhic rather than symbolic.  Yours faithfully     Andrew Stevens Editor, 3AM Magazine   This will keep on running and running.  We were here first and Morgan has a lot to lose.  Oh... I couldn't help but notice the following on the  Mirror 's  urlLink site  recently:   Want to expose the dodgy dealings of a firm and its bosses? Be it a billion pound giant or a small time shyster, our Sorted And The City team will want to know. Email sorted@mgn.co.uk (Please include a full postal address)   According to  urlLink Trinity Mirror Plc's financial data , their turnover last year was £1092m, which in UK terms makes it just over a billion.  So I guess you'd call them a 'billion pound giant', acting like a 'small time shyster'.  So who's going to report them to themselves?

       Anger management 2  Another day, another  3AM  rip-off... yep, the  urlLink  Mirror   have issued another edition of their eagerly-awaited (snigger) gossip organ,  3am Magazine  [sic.].  It's not like I expected them not to or something, as if a  "little-known online literary title"  could stop the might of the Trinity Mirror Group and their much-vaunted plan to save the paper from extinction.  I guess like the Wire song, we are the fly in the ointment of their cunning strategem to halt falling sales by feeding the Great British Public  "an addictive diet of celebrity and gossip instead of news or analysis"  in their  "rather cheap and tacky, and generally a bit naff"  rag (not our words, Piers, but Andrew Neil and the  Daily Star 's).  They probably didn't reckon on anyone else having the name and if they did then, hey, that's showbusiness! I wouldn't mind but it's Kylie Minogue on the front cover, with the headline  "I'm a red-blooded woman!" , but fear not (real)  3AM  readers, for there is a free CD, to give you that extra motivation to part with 35p for a copy of the  Mirror  today (as opposed to  The Sun  or  The Daily Star ).  And what's on this CD, you may ask?  1. 'Celebration' - Kool and The Gang 2. 'Video Killed The Radio Star' - Buggles 3. 'ABC' - The Jackson 5 4. 'I'm Coming Out' - Diana Ross 5. 'Word Up' - Cameo 6. 'Car Wash' - Rose Royce 7. '99 Red Balloons' - Nena 8. 'Boogie Wonderland' - Earth, Wind & Fire with The Emotions 9. 'I Love Music' - The O'Jays 10. 'Let's Hear It For The Boy' - Deniece Williams  Who on earth (wind and fire) do they view as their potential market with this? Salesmen in Mondeos driving up and down the M1? An office girls' pre-night out mix-tape on the Alba stereo? That's not very ( Mirror )  3am  [sic.], now is it? If the real  3AM  ever moved into the tabloid field ( The Sun Literary Supplement , perhaps?), we probably wouldn't have to bribe you with marketing gimmicks to buy the thing, but if we did, a free CD might look a little something like this:  1. 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' - Adam and the Ants  2. 'Teenage Riot' - Sonic Youth 3. 'Sunglasses After Dark' - The Cramps 4. 'Revolution' - Spacemen 3 5. 'Blitzkrieg Rock' - The Ramones 6. 'Promises' - The Buzzcocks 7. 'Sooner' - My Bloody Valentine 8. 'Fuck The Pain Away' - Peaches 9. 'We Don't Play Guitars' - Chicks on Speed 10. 'I Am The Fly' - Wire  Oh... today's '3am Girls' column opens with the line  "They say imitation is the best form of flattery..." .  Erm, yeah, you're not wrong love(s).

       It aint over until the fat lady sings 2   3AM 's David and Golliath-esque struggle against Trinity Mirror plc  urlLink moves up a gear ...  The  Mirror 's new publication has drawn some comment from the overly-analytical world of media commentary.  Former  Mirror  mainstay Bill Hagerty assesses  urlLink the other 3am Magazine 's likely contribution in reviving the fortunes of the flagging  Mirror , once the tabloid flagship of Fleet Street in its heyday.  Trade press journal  urlLink Media Bulletin , on the other hand, hails the other  3am Magazine  as  "the first handbag-sized supplement in newspaper history".   The Times   urlLink actually covered it  last month -- we should have been more eagle-eyed I guess (as did  urlLink The Guardian ,  urlLink twice in one day  -- as did  urlLink Media Week ).  'Media Bitch UK' (who they?)  urlLink dish the dirt  on the low celeb-count at the launch party for the other  3am Magazine  (and where was our invite?).  Yesterday's  Guardian  dismisses the Piers Morgan/Sly Bailey strategem as  urlLink a crude attempt to emulate the success  of  Glamour  magazine.  Meanwhile, the  Mirror 's tabloid rival, the  Daily Star , takes the other  3am Magazine 's launch personally --  urlLink dismissing the new publication  as  "rather cheap and tacky, and generally a bit naff" .  We, erm, know how you feel.  They go on to say that the new magazine  "can't seem to decide if it wants to be Bella or Heat"  and  "If that's the best they can do, they might as well give up now."  A few weeks ago, the  Mirror   urlLink declared  that the mere prospect of a  3am Magazine  had their  "rivals in a sweat" .  That's one way of looking at the situation.  Ubiqitous media pundit extraordinaire, Andrew Neil (this time without vest, baseball cap and scantily-clad Asian beauty -- see  Private Eye 's  passim ), publishes his take on the situation in  urlLink The Scotsman , arguing that  "if anybody is to blame... it must be the red-top tabloid editors themselves who, over the past couple of decades, have fed readers an addictive diet of celebrity and gossip instead of news or analysis and turned trivia into an art form." .  The  urlLink Telegraph  helpfully points out that the  Mirror  had to  urlLink abandon a similar celebrity-focused magazine  (the imaginatively-titled  M ) last year due to it not being  "strong enough" .  I'm inclined to watch events unfold here, although some people have suggested I give  The Sun  a call.  Oh, and finally (from the  Guardian 's  urlLink MediaMonkey  column):   "Much excitement at the launch of the Daily Mirror's eagerly awaited celebrity rag, the 3am magazine. Let's hope it contains more famous people than bothered to turn up to the launch at a groovy West End venue last week - who numbered precisely zero. To use the parlance of the 3am column...

       Manic Miners  David Peace's  GB84  reviewed  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Dan Rhodes' magnificent  Timoleon Vieta Come Home  reviewed  urlLink here .  Today's  Telegraph 's Literary Diary contains the following on Dan:   "This July, Canongate are publishing a debut novel, The Little White Car, by a mysterious young author who goes by the name of Danuta (pronounced Dan-oosha) de Rhodes.   Her publishers swear she is not related to the cult novelist Dan Rhodes, also published by Canongate. Dan, they claim, was last seen somewhere in the British countryside recovering from a joint authors' reading with DBC Pierre. After that encounter, Dan claimed he would never write again. Meanwhile his stable-mate, Danuta, is so shy of her success in her native France that she has moved to New York where she is apparently dating a member of the band The Strokes.   The confusion about the two authors' identities is compounded by similarities in their work. Like Dan, in her fiction Danuta likes to flirt with real life. Her heroine's story begins as she is driving a white Fiat into a Parisian tunnel. She clips a large, black car before speeding off."

       More subscription-only reviews but apologies for the length  Hey, if my employer's willing to pay for it then society at large might as well benefit.  From this week's  urlLink New Statesman :   Underground London: travels beneath the city streets  Stephen Smith Little, Brown, 390pp, £17.99 ISBN 1567118666     Reviewed by Andrew Martin      When I started in journalism, it was always said that there were two classic stand-bys for feature articles. The first was afternoon tea dances, which surprisingly (except that everyone knew about them) survived at certain genteel restaurants and hotels. The other was known as "London under London", which would allude to a range of underground phenomena. Learned stuff such as discussion of Roman remains would be optional, but anything macabre - tombs and abandoned Underground stations, for instance - would be compulsory. The difference between these subjects was that "London under London" was inexhaustible and foolproof. Anybody could write it, and everybody would read it. It was just interesting.  The standard text to crib was actually called London Under London, by Richard Trench and Ellis Hillman. First published in 1984, this was an excellent book, but it now faces stiff competition from Stephen Smith's Underground London. Smith has clearly read Trench and Hillman's work, and gives it a credit in his bibliography, secure in the knowledge that his own book, while covering similar territory, is quite different in tone.  Trench and Hillman would never have written, as Smith does in describing an explosion that occurred in 1846 within the buried River Fleet, ". . . a Thames steamboat rammed into Blackfriars Bridge on a bow wave of crap"; or that London "rests on its cold, wet base as negligently as a fat old man on a waterbed". Underground London is more writerly than the earlier book, and far more personal, to the extent that much of it consists of first-person reportage.  Smith has a good eye. In the crypt of St Andrew's Church in the City, he contemplates the distorted lead coffins of plague victims: "They reminded me of the vanished fashion for blowtorching classic Coca-Cola bottles until their elegant necks were stretched into glowing icicles." He has a fine ear, too. Visiting the silver vaults under Chancery Lane, he detects a latent melancholy among the dealers who work down there, and quotes one who says: "They used to make everything in silver . . . Too many things. You'd need a football pitch for all of them. And you'd have to keep them clean. And they wear out."  All the main under-London phenomena are dealt with - the hidden rivers, the Tube, the Thames Ring Main. And in most cases they are personally observed by Smith in the company of guides at whose expense he has some wicked fun. Visiting Westminster Abbey (with the under-floor interments in mind), he notes that the advertised "verger-guided tour" sounds curiously like "heat-seeking missile".  But he does not manage to penetrate the secret subterranean governmental facility reputed to radiate across central London with Whitehall as a hub. In 1980, the investigative journalist Duncan Campbell entered this network via a manhole on a traffic island in Bishopsgate. He rode a collapsible bike around it, apparently while guards were having their tea, photographed it, and described it in an article published in the Christmas 1980 edition of this magazine. As a result, Campbell is a hero to the members of Subterranea Britannica and, Smith suggests, is a regular turn at the meetings of that mole-ish club. Smith believes that no outsider has been into the tunnels since Campbell, and he ruefully notes that there are "those who enter the government labyrinth and don't write about it, and those who write about it but don't enter it".  Smith's book still manages to be full of revelations, albeit ones of a non-security-sensitive nature: Underground railway lines tend to rise up slightly within stations to assist the trains in braking; scientists from the Centre for Explosion Studies at the University of Wales worked out that Guy Fawkes and his colleagues had enough gunpowder to flatten the Houses of Parliament 25 times over; there are more bodies in Bunhill Cemetery than there are people living in Southampton. (To which the true Londoner will respond by asking Stephen Smith: Ah yes, but what do you mean by "living"?)  Smith has a good go - well, lots of them - at explaining why we are fascinated by the underground life of the city, but I liked this one best: "The lore of the London criminal would be incomplete without the stash of moody money, to be dug up and divvied out as soon as the gang is back together again." It's the secrecy and mystery, in other words, plus the sinister overtone, speaking of which Smith actually encounters a sewer worker who extends his arms and says: "The rats are this size." That just about sealed it for me.   Douglas Murray's review in  The Observer   urlLink here .

       Picking up Trash  Those with a Rockist disposition -- and I’m talking late-Penetration rather than The Darkness here -- might like to check out new band  urlLink Trash Monroe , who provide crashing sounds to punch the air along to. The upstarts will be coming to a stadium in your hometown soon, no doubt.  Attracting all the media attention is 22-year-old lead singer Melany. Such is the allure of this young woman that one music biz executive, married with children, skipped the usual “What are you drinking?” chat up line and offered to immediately install her in a swish rented apartment as his mistress. A typical pop industry tool, but if TM can inspire similar passion/crass stupidity in the punters, they'll be quids in.

       Now that *is* what I call music  One irritating aspect about being into music so much is the strong likelihood of meeting other people who share your enthusiasm.  It is especially irritating when people attempt to argue that they were already fans of a band they are into now at an unfeasibly young age, or even go so far as to lie about it ("Yeah, of course you saw the Mary Chain on their first tour when you were 10, of course you did..." etc).  To this end, I rarely mention that my first brush with The Smiths was aged eight.  But in late 1983, I was bought a vinyl copy of  Now That's What I Call Music 3  to play on my newly-acquired Amstrad hi-fi -- on the second record there was a song by the name of 'What Difference Does It Make?' by a certain four lads from Manchester.  To be fair, I only liked the song because it was a jaunty number, if it'd been 'How Soon Is Now?' it might have been different and I probably preferred Duran Duran's 'The Reflex' or China Crisis' 'Wishful Thinking'.  My next brush with Johnny Marr wouldn't be until he was in Electronic and even then I taped that off the radio.  But it has  urlLink been announced  that  urlLink Morrissey  is to  urlLink curate the next Meltdown  on the  urlLink South Bank in London .

       My Lad Mag Hell!  OK, that's a bit strong.  But were I writing an article on this, perhaps that would make a good title for it.  Yesterday,  3AM  was invited to watch the Carling (League) Cup Final (Bolton Wanderers v Middlesbrough, as you ask) at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, with full corporate hospitality and all that entails.  Again, I'm over-egging the pudding somewhat as I got the invite courtesy of a journalist friend who works at  Front  magazine (international readers: this is a competitor title to  urlLink Loaded , a more upfront and tawdry version of  FHM ,  Esquire ,  GQ  etc.) For the record, I support no team and show no interest in the game apart from international tournaments or arguments over regional rivalries (which are infinitely more interesting than 22 overpaid men fighting for a ball).  The day began by meeting at 7.30am for the transport to the stadium in the function room of a rather opulent London hotel, so I digged into the complimentary croissants and coffee and surveyed around my fellow invited journalists as I waited for my friend to turn up (the cab he'd booked the night before didn't show).  I was told to wear smart clothes as the invite warned of no jeans or trainers but compared to the raffish middle class young hacks who staff lads mags these days (neat and sleek haircuts, blue Hugo Boss suits and black loafers, topped off with designer label parkas), I didn't really scrub up in brown cords, black shirt and brown moccasins.  The 'luxury coach' was more coach than luxury and the scenery of the M4 hardly provides a distraction on any journey, so sleep was in order.  We arrived in Cardiff and parked on the university site.  For corporate hospitality, I was rather surprised at how unorganised it all was as we were left to make our way to the stadium flanked by Middlesbrough fans possessing comedy accents and even funnier attire (before the regionalism accusations are made, I grew up just outside the town, I'm allowed to hate it).  Having performed a virtual tour of the city centre and the stadium site, exacerbated by stewards and security staff who seemingly knew nothing, we were seated to a three course meal comprising salmon starter, chicken main course and lemon tart dessert, all washed down with copious quantities of free Carling lager (sponsors of the tournament).  Why couldn't Stella Artois sponsor it? Carling is revolting.  Still, most Boro fans will have had to work extra shifts in their call centres just to be able to be there and drank paid-for Carling out of plastic cups.  Once seated for the game, there was all manner of fireworks and the Chairman of the Football League, Sir Brian Mawhinney MP (ex-Tory Health Secretary, for those of you with short memories), shook the players' hands.  I don't know much about football, but it was end to end stuff and the result was 2-1 to Middlesbrough at full time.  As it's the first cup they've won in 128 years (having played in many cup finals), then all the best to them.  Apparently violent crime drops in Middlesbrough when the team perform well, so some student will have been spared a beating last night.  The post-match award ceremony for the winners and "gallant finalists" (ie. losers) exposes the cruel differential between the League Cup and the more prestigious FA Cup.  FA Cup winners can expect to shake hands with a minor royal whereas yesterday's winners had to make do with the UK Marketing Director of Coors Breweries.  In the corporate hospitality suite afterwards, I was asked by all manner of journalists which publication I worked for.  I said  3AM .  While no one had heard of us, no one seemed to think I didn't belong there once I explained what  3AM  was and had given them one of the business cards me and Andrew Gallix had printed up for ourselves.  Perhaps next year  3AM  will be invited in its own right then, though I'd settle for invites to the Hay and Edinburgh Literary Festivals first, then Cannes.  You never know...

       Move over, Dickie Roberts   urlLink Matt Thorne 's  Child Star   urlLink reviewed  in  The Guardian  this weekend:   ""I suppose my story lacks some of the punch of Drew Barrymore's," muses Gerald. He's right there - instead of ET and drugs, Gerald reflects on his appearance in a fleetingly notorious children's soap and mild disappointment. Gerald, having briefly rubbed his nose on fame's sleeve, now teaches in a language school and is dumped by his depressive girlfriend. In alternate chapters he charts his current obscurity and the making of All Right Now. He looks back on fractious workshops with an endlessly pompous dramaturge and on tensions in his home life with a psychopathic kid sister and parents bickering towards separation. As ever, Thorne's deliberately thin-textured prose name-checks fly-by-night movies and albums, but derives an undertow from the sad slide past celebrity. Gerald insists that a celeb-hungry public slavers for stories of fallen idols - "The most entertaining spectacle would be to watch Hollywood stars being beheaded.""

       Miners' Strike 2  Novelist David Peace, also in the subscription-only  New Statesman  this week, on the folklore of the left.  A review of his new novel  GB84  (will deals directly with the strike and was reviewed in  urlLink The Observer  this weekend) will be on the  3AM  Reviews section soon.   "I was born and raised in Yorkshire. Now I live in a foreign country. In Japan, people do things differently. Japan has no state religion. The traditional culture combines Shinto and Buddhism. Most Japanese homes have butsudans - small Buddhist shrines to dead relatives. Anniversaries are marked on the 49th day and then the first, third and seventh years after death. Families make regular pilgrimages to their ancestors' graves. National holidays are set aside so people can pay their respects. During the summer festival of O-bon, streets are adorned with lanterns so that the dead might find their way home for three days - an occasion to be celebrated, not feared.  Three years ago, I could not have told you when my grandparents died. I could not have told you whether they had been buried or cremated. I could not have told you whether there were gravestones or plaques to commemorate their lives or mark their deaths. I could not have told you the names of their parents. Their brothers or sisters. Their jobs. Their hopes.  Three years ago, I began to research and write GB84, a novel about the miners' strike of 1984-85. Three years ago, I began to meet the men and women from both sides, read the books and newspapers from both sides. Three years ago I also went with my father and my son to the National Coal Mining Museum for England at Caphouse Colliery, Wakefield.  At Caphouse Colliery I found the names of my great-great-uncles on a monument to the 139 miners who died in the Thornhill Colliery disaster of 1893 - I did not know that my great-great-uncles and their father and their sons had been miners. I had forgotten that there had even been a Thornhill pit disaster - or a New Hartley Colliery disaster. An Oaks disaster. A Cadeby Main. A Lofthouse.  I had forgotten that men died on the picket lines during the 1984-85 miners' strike. That young boys had died coal-picking. I had forgotten so much; so much that had happened - on my own doorstep, in my own county, in my own country.  During the strike, I had been living in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. I had been doing my A-levels at Wakefield District College. I had been singing in a band; I had been having the time of my life.  Three years ago, I still remembered odd things about the strike - who wouldn't? The plastic buckets and the pub fights. The yellow "Coal not Dole" stickers and the Redskins. The Wakefield Gala and Orgreave. The kids in my class whose dads were on strike, and how they had crisp sandwiches for lunch - then butter sandwiches, then just bread. How two years after the strike, bailiffs were still taking their furniture away.  Yes, I knew there had been violence. Murder even. That there had been mistakes. But I had not known that there had been such sacrifice, such selflessness - that miners in good pits on good money would give up their wages, their savings, even their houses, for men in threatened pits with no future. That these miners and their families would give up all this for other men and their families, people they had never met and never would. That they would organise in order to protect and to fight for the security of another man's job. Defending those jobs, those families, those communities, that culture and that heritage was extended to defending those jobs, those families, those communities, that culture and that heritage against monetarism, deregulation, privatisation, market forces and the trickle down.  Sacrifice and selflessness versus brutality and bribery, fear and greed. And we all know who won. And we all know who lost - their jobs, their families, their communities, their culture, their heritage - 150 years of socialist heritage. British heritage, not nostalgia. Not romanticism. A heritage of sacrifice, of selflessness. A sacrifice and a selflessness born out of compassion and empathy - qualities that cannot be bought or stolen from you. That cannot be won on a TV show or found fake, off the back of a lorry, three-for-two or all-you-can-eat.  Yes, there was violence in 1984. Yes, there were mistakes. And there is still violence today in 2004. And there are still mistakes - but where is the sacrifice? Where is the selflessness?  I can't remember the last thing I gave up. Drink or drugs? Gambling or pornography? God or socialism? The last thing I gave up for someone else? The last time I even thought of someone else? Someone outside of my family? My friends? Someone I had never met?  The last time I thought about someone else's job? Their family? The place where they live? The people they live with? Their history? Their hopes? Their fears?  Twenty years ago, there was sacrifice. Twenty years ago, there was selflessness. Not in a novel. Not in a film. But in Great Britain. In this country. In 1984 . . . In Great Britain, in 1984, people might have done things differently, but the past is not a foreign country. The people who lived and died there are not strangers. They are our people, us, and it is our country. Then and now, right or wrong.  We are shoulder to shoulder."

       Miners' Strike 1  Apologies for the length, but I thought  3AM  readers who don't subscribe to the  New Statesman , deserved to be able to read  Daily Mirror  journalist Paul Routledge's excellent commentary on the Miners' Strike of 20 years ago.  You can even  urlLink buy the t-shirt  these days...   "The memory of impending doom is as sharp as ever. The scene is the public bar of the Danum Hotel, Doncaster. The date is late October 1984. It is late evening and I am drinking with the lads from Frickley Colliery in Yorkshire. There is an air of subdued elation, because after more than seven hard months of a strike that began in March that year, a whiff of victory is detectable. The pit deputies, whose normal working has undermined the greatest working-class insurrection of modern times, have voted more than four to one to join the strike at last. Without them, the pits cannot operate lawfully, and the Thatcher government's ambition of breaking the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) will be defeated.  As labour editor of the Times, I telephoned the news desk at about 10pm to see how the story was playing. It was the front-page splash, but not as I had written it. Why? Because our man in Birmingham had fresh, reliable information. Key members of the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (Nacods) executive had gone home from the ballot declaration stating that they would defy the vote and carry on working the Midlands and Nottinghamshire pits.  I knew then that it would be simply a matter of time before the miners and their families were crushed. I went back to the bar and, two decades later, I can still remember the song that was playing - "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper - as we discussed the prospects. Some miners would not, could not, share my gloomy view. But the deputies did stay at work. Moreover, they signed a deal on pit closures that Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, rejected with contumely - sealing the fate of the dispute just as surely as the deputies' treachery.  The memory of that evening - more than the picketing, the collective hysteria of the Scargill rallies, the close relationships built up during that awful year - remains the most poignant and distressing of all. I cannot bring it back to mind without feeling hatred for the bastards who did these things to our people.  I was only an observer, if an interested one. I had not lost my home or my livelihood, as so many of these exhausted men and their families would now do. The Tories and their allies tore through the pit villages like an avenging army, destroying jobs, pits, the union and a way of life that had endured for more than a century. The legacy is still with us. Work is scarce, and it does not command anything like the same money. All too often, it is agency work in warehouses and the like, on short-term contracts, with no union. "You take what you can get, because there's nowt else," is the common refrain. The glue of disciplined work in a dangerous environment has also gone. In its place has come drug addiction on an inner-city scale. South Elmsall village is a typical example. Its former miners at Frickley Colliery prided themselves on being "second to none", because only four out of 1,800 men scabbed. "And they were outsiders," they quickly explain. Now rows of terraced houses near the site of the pit, which would fetch a million pounds in Chelsea, have to be demolished, because they are the killing fields of heroin dealers. A few hundred yards away, "executive" homes are going up, likely to fetch £150,000, and be occupied by commuters from Leeds, Wakefield and Sheffield.  The NUM has been a high-profile casualty of the post-strike years. Sundered by a split that led to the breakaway of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM) and the re-election of Scargill, this once-proud organisation imploded and today resembles an extinct volcano - rugged, scary, but dead. Scargill took over a thriving union with 270,000 members and a bulging bank account. Under his leadership, it contracted to no more than 2,000 paying members. He remains its £1,000-a-month "consultant", with a £60,000-a-year pension. He could not even leave the NUM a presidency; it now has a chairman, like a working men's club committee. The post is held by Ian Lavery, a decent man who has been overwhelmed by events.  The four-pit Selby complex closes next month. Hatfield Colliery, sitting on Europe's biggest reserves, shut down in January. Yorkshire will have only three deep mines: Kellingley, Maltby and Rossington, the last redoubts of the NUM. Just three where there were once hundreds. Some spirit survives, like gas venting from the crater floor. Kellingley miners have just voted by nine to one to ban overtime over UK Coal's plans to impose longer shifts and 24-hour working.  Then there is the continuing scandal of the mineworkers' pension scheme, set up by the Tories in the aftermath of the strike. The Treasury takes half the annual profits, often amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds, in return for a pledge to maintain the pitifully low level of miners' pensions. Some get £12 a week. Gordon Brown refuses to end this theft of the workers' pennies. Between 1997 and 2001, the Labour vote in Hemsworth - once the party's safest seat in England - fell by 9,000. These were not transferred votes. They simply disappeared.  Yes, shipbuilding, heavy engineering, steel, the railways - all got it in the neck in similar fashion. But the miners had a special role in the British understanding of what we are all about. They once numbered a million men, plus women and children. The nation's wealth was built on their backs, on the pit rows with their ash middens - conditions that did not change until municipal socialism, often a distant cousin of big Labour, brought about reform.  It is not possible to romanticise about the miners, because their achievement was so real. The others talked. They did it. The council estates of South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Fife, the Welsh valleys and the Midlands are a tribute to their struggle. They put the baths indoors, and they did not put coal in them. What we have lost is not just the NUM's hard hats, with their Labour Party block votes, but also unsung individuals whose daily efforts brought improvements for the people they represented. We shall not see their like again. Who can put his hand on his heart and say that Peter Mandelson is a more important figure than the unknown miner who stood at the gates of hell for a year, living on the charity of fellow trade unionists and the uncertain handouts of a Labour council in fear of voter disapproval?  The smirking, smarmy face of new Labour tells us everything we need to know about the political generation that never had to face the great crisis that confronted Neil Kinnock. He was torn between loyalty and expediency. It showed in his face. But at least it showed. With supreme irony, Tony Blair lives in a former mining village in Durham. The daft Spanish name of his house - Mirabella - gives away the dysfunctional relationship he has always had with the miners. He routinely fails to answer invitations to the annual Durham Miners' Gala, held a few miles from his home. He allows his staff at No 10 to denigrate those who fight for higher wages as "Scargillites". There is no greater insult in his (admittedly limited) political vocabulary. This should come as no surprise, since he has never had a proper job, or been on strike, or felt the hot breath of the boss down his neck. Blair has never shown an ounce of understanding for what the men and women - the very men and women who sustained his party in the bleak years of opposition - went through. He thinks bread and dripping is a side order in the nouveau-bourgeois Quality Chop House, a "progressive working-class caterer" in London.  Forgive me if I fail to suppress my wrath. It is not invented. It resurfaces at the oddest moments. A few months ago, I was asked to talk to a supper meeting of a Tory club calling itself "The Britons". Norman Tebbit was among the speakers. Somebody mentioned the miners. I got to my feet and said something like: "Call yourselves Britons? Don't you think the miners and their families were Britons? Don't you remember what you people did to them - especially him [Tebbit]?" I could have machine-gunned them, wallowing in their Chateau Whatsit and ignorance.  What do they know, for instance, of the work of Father Peter Needham, the Roman Catholic priest parachuted into St Luke's, Grimethorpe, where not only the pit but a coking plant and a power station closed? The village hit rock bottom, with 50 per cent unemployed, and an average wage of £8,000 a year for those "lucky" enough to be in work. Needham, an omnipresence with his dogs Mary and Joseph, fought to rebuild the disintegrating community and his efforts are slowly bearing fruit. "Nobody else from outside seemed to want to help," the former miner Trevor Wassall told a radio programme.  On 20 March, the annual David Jones/Joe Green memorial lecture will take place in Barnsley. It commemorates two pitmen who died in the Great Strike. In both cases, on the picket line. No politicians died, only a few reputations. Nor any policemen.  This year, inevitably, the ex-pitmen wanted to hear Arthur Scargill. He is still a cult figure in the mining communities. You rubbish him at your peril, not least because so many ex-miners have yet to come to terms with the grief, the horror and the sense of defeat. He is there for the funerals, and other social occasions. Unbelievably for outsiders, he is not criticised for never having been there to negotiate miners' wages, or colliery closures, after the strike was over. Or for pulling out of health and safety forums to pursue a vendetta against the renegade UDM. "Scaggsie is a bastard, but he is our bastard," you will hear. Nobody closes ranks against the outside world like the miners do - to this day. They remember that he was prominent in the 1972 and 1974 strikes - real victories, victories that improved pay and conditions and ultimately brought down the Heath government.  It comes as no surprise to hear that former NUM leaders such as Terry Thomas in South Wales do not want to take part in 20th-anniversary media programmes. There is much to think about, not much to celebrate. Those idiot media children who want to exploit an event of which they could have had no contemporary experience, who see the strike as an event to be filmed before they move on to the next fixture in the calendar, should stay out of Pit Row. Those who went through it are the only people who know. I leave to the end the Frickley miner who, when the strike was over and Scargill declared a victory, said: "Well, I lost the car, and my life's savings, and I nearly lost the house. Good job we didn't get beat, isn't it?" In that sentence, you know they never were."

       Whitechapel greasy spoons are alright by us  Friend of  3AM  Suhkdev Sandhu pens a review of Adrian Maddox's  Classic Cafes  for the  urlLink New Statesman  (subscription-only), which is reproduced here:   "The other day, I was in Katz's Deli on Manhattan's Lower East Side. It's one of the best-known diners in the city. As one of the few surviving Jewish eateries in an area that was once packed with them, it acts as a magnet for heritage-seekers. The walls are lined with photos - of mayors, baseball stars, Bill Clinton. It was here that Meg Ryan faked an orgasm in When Harry Met Sally. And it was here that I came across Sara Cox of BBC Radio 1 broadcasting her show live to the UK. As I tucked into my spinach knish and listened to her whoop and big up the place, I tried to imagine the DJ doing an open broadcast from a greasy spoon down Whitechapel Road.  Few people these days champion English cafes. They conjure up images of cracked mugs and failure, sausages with the tex-ture of sodden bath rugs, bacon bubbling like offshore oil slicks. Raymond Blanc has argued that the British hate food because "you think it's fantastic to go into some revolting cafe and eat something disgusting to endorse your working-class status". However, increasingly, these cafes are closing down and being replaced by brasseries and identikit coffee houses owned by American chains.  Adrian Maddox, the author of Classic Cafes, sees this creeping homogeneity as a quiet tragedy. He has produced a thinking person's coffee-table book, packed with atmospheric photographs by Phil Nicholls. Starting from the premise that "a proper classic cafe needs to have been left well alone for the past 50 years or so to facilitate that signature feeling of crushed romance and brief escape", he evokes a fading world of Pyrex cup'n'saucer sets, vinyl-topped tables, Gaggia machines, Vitrolite ceilings.  There was a time when Formica cafes represented a future as glinting and accelerated as the Skylon. They were sleek and Euro-glam, an escape from drab, austere England. They were also an antidote to old-fashioned tearooms with their prim waitresses and polite sandwiches. Their interiors sparkled with design motifs such as starbursts, sputniks and boomerangs, conveying the impression of "energy caught in the act of explosive release, like a coruscating diamond".  No wonder they attracted bored, insurgent teenagers, many of whom cultivated identities based on cultural interests rather than class: skiffle, jazz, mod, rock'n'roll. They cropped up repeatedly in pulp cinema of the period - The Golden Disc (1958), Serious Charge (1959), She Knows, Y'Know (1961) - and attracted the invective of such commentators as Richard Hoggart, who saw espresso bars as "spiritual dry-rot amid the odour of boiled milk".  The coffee houses of the 17th and 18th centuries had been hubs for doctors and commodity brokers, hang-outs for that merchant class which profited from the empire, "penny universities" whose customers were at the centre of the English Enlightenment. Maddox makes the case for seeing the cafes of the 1950s and 1960s as salons for a new, de-industrialised, post-imperial Britain, catering - literally - for artists, designers, the tribes of urban pop culture. Quoting such loafers and bohos as Frank Norman, John Bratby and B S Johnson, he views these cafes not as places where ideas were hatched, but as hallowed zones in which the dynamics and cross-currents of city life could be tapped into.  Wandering through the side streets of London, hunting for cafes that have resisted sunny-side-up gentrification, he recalls the "third place" philosophy of Ray Oldenburg, a thinker who championed neutral areas between home and work, "restorative oases" that are private yet social, discreet yet visible. He cites the psychogeographers Iain Sinclair, Stewart Home and David Seabrook, who have discussed the importance of cafes for modern-day schemers and dreamers, those who still believe there's a space for urban drifting in an increasingly airbrushed, global metropolis.  By default, Maddox has written a history of immigrant labour. Many of the cafes he praises were family businesses opened and staffed by Italians. The second or third generation's reluctance to work long hours means that few survive. Yet new cafes, shabbier perhaps, open all the time. On the edges of London, in those neighbourhoods not yet wholly colonised by shaggy-haired hipsters, cafes run by recently arrived Turks, Ethiopians and Lithuanians are continually springing up. Here, the poor and the friendless come to swap gossip, find out about odd jobs, talk of politics back home, plot some dodgy scam, feel less lonely. Maybe, one day, some of these will be held up as classic cafes, too."

       Paperback Blogger   The Guardian 's  urlLink 'Online' section  (the worst and most-neglected part of their website, ironically) features an article by  urlLink Andrew Losowsky  on  urlLink innovations in e-2-ink publishing :   As it once did with the web, the sheer quantity of words available makes blogs seem best placed to revolutionise print publishing as well. Though, as Keiger points out, that may not always be a good thing for the readers.   "Ninety-nine percent of blogs are bloody awful," he says. "Most of the books published this way will be of utterly no merit. But what the hell, if someone wants to cobble together entries and have them published on demand, where's the harm?"     Andrew Losowsky?  I thought.  Sounds a bit like  urlLink Andrew Orlowski  to me.  But no, his story checks out -- I checked google and he has  urlLink more sites  to  urlLink his name  than Imelda Marcos owned shoes it seems.  Which is also ironic given  Andrew Orlowski 's  urlLink much-reported  (in the blogosphere) disdain for google.  OK, I know this has been discussed a lot  elsewhere  (note my casual, rather than affectational as Stuart Marconie would say, disdain for serial blogging -- in the same way that the House of Commons refers to debates in the House of Lords as happening 'in another place') but Andrew Orlowski (not Losowsky, note) is the boyfriend of  urlLink Sarah Champion , who was branded a psuedonymous-blogger of some repute, but actually wasn't.  I think.  I don't know.  But it does bring things rather full circle I find.  I wish I had a name like Andrew Orlowski or Andrew Losowsky, rather than plain old regular Andrew Stevens.  If you google me you get 8 million different Andrew Stevens', which is ironic given that our surname was once (reputedly) Stevanovski.  'Andrew Stevanovski' -- has a nice ring to it but, come May 1st, I might get mistaken for one of those Polish economic migrants that Tony Blair and the  Daily Mail  get worked up about.  I can just see the scenes at Heathrow Airport --  "Honest, I work for The Guardian, I write pieces about weblogging and that! What are you putting those gloves on for?"  Nope, it's a really bad idea.  Anyhow, blog-publishing on demand, the mind does boggle as to who would part with hard-earned cash to read something they could just skim through online.   urlLink Salam Pax  was something of an exception, given that 99.9% of Western bloggers would have been preoccupied with survival if faced with his predicament a year or so ago, that man deserved a book deal.  But  urlLink  The Thoughts of Hak Mao  ? A book deal of her own for the  urlLink Bookslut  to discuss? Forgive me as I stroke my chin quizically, but I don't know if that will have the boards of HarperCollins or Jonathan Cape standing on the 13th floor ledge with the wind billowing against their faces as they contemplate suicide in face of dwindling profits.  When Dave Eggers and Zadie Smith acquire blogging personas, I'll sit up and take notice.  Until then, the world will continue to be divided into two sorts of people -- those get paid to write about people blogging and those who don't.  They don't call them the  urlLink blogeoisie  for nothing, you know.

       Last Exit  Eric Homberger's  urlLink obituary to Hubert Selby Jr , who died on Monday:   "Though, in later years, the literary world grew somewhat blasé at a constant diet of rapes, violence, urban gangs and sexual obsession, Selby could at least claim that he had been present at the creation of the literary sensibility that defined the age, and that his book became a landmark in British law."   I was always a fan of his spoken word work but it was  Last Exit to Brooklyn  that had a profound effect on me, growing up.  Its raw and delicate discussion of issues I'd never really come across in literature before switched me on to other great American writers and, as they say, I never looked back.  It's fucking typical of this country that they'd try to ban it.

       Forever Horizontal  The  urlLink ICA  held a showing of the  urlLink Pavement  documentary,  The Slow Century  last night, so attendance was in order.  To be honest, my initial attraction was to the billing of  urlLink  Heavy Metal Parking Lot   as the warm-up feature, as it's not available on DVD yet and I've only ever  heard  about it, not  seen  it.  So you can imagine my displeasure when in fact the presented feature was actually  Harry Potter Parking Lot , an ironic take on the franchise based around a JK Rowling appearance at a Politics and Prose store in the US.  A few years back,  3AM 's  urlLink Bertie Marshall  discussed on this very blog the demise of the ICA cinema (when they attempted to show a  urlLink Baader Meinhof  documentary and failed, offering no refunds) and I felt similarly cheated by their jipping me.  Were it not for the fact that the actual feature was an amazingly well-assembled piece of film on one of the 90s most key and influential (yet often overlooked) bands, I would have stormed out of there, demanding the head of the cretinous soul who lied on the literature about what films were on.  It's on again on 30/4 and 6/5 so if you're able to, I'd well advise watching it.  Just don't believe them about  Heavy Metal Parking Lot .  Meanwhile... a  urlLink shoegazing weblog  has been launched.  Will wonders ever cease?

       The idiocy of contemporary writing  Following on from the  urlLink Luther Blissett -penned  Ten Point Guide To Being A Cult Artist ,  urlLink Charles Thomson  of the  urlLink Stuckists  informs me of his and  urlLink Billy Childish 's remodernist take on self-designated cult literature,   urlLink The Cappuccino Writer  :   1. There is popular writing known as the blockbuster or airport novel but this is considered trash by the critics. Then there is the writing by pseudo-intellectuals which is very popular with the critics but considered even worse trash by us.  2. Contemporary writing is cowardly and unchallenging because squalor is tedious not remarkable. If you find yourself in a rubbish bin the only interesting narrative is how to climb out, not how ill you can make yourself by ingesting it.  3. The main problem with contemporary writing is that writing, like the other arts, can only ever be a reflection of an aspect of the creators character.   4. Salmon Rushdie is the epitome of contemporary turgidity and defies anyone of sensibility to read more than one paragraph, wherever that paragraph may happen to be. His writing achieves all the characteristics that defeat anything worth saying, a position guaranteed in todays self preening philistinism to win all the prizes. His style is artificial and insulting to even avarage intilligence, the story lines are a random assemblage and the language false. We advise people not to read him.  5. We don't like the 'Cappuccino Writers' either, e.g. Will Self and Martin Amis, (so named becouse of their penchant for cappuccino as opposed to tea or coffee). Also we are bored by Ian Banks, Irving Welsh and Ian McEwan.   6. The common characteristic of the Cappuccino Writer is his puffed-up preening self regard. His writing is artificial and painfully over-aware of itself.   7. The Cappuccino Writer is not an outsider. It is pitiful to see affluent and feted mainstream writers posturing as underground martyrs.  8. The ultimate accolade for nausea is Nausea by Jean Paul Sartre, who is an intellectual toss pot. (Existentialism was tedious in the first place, even when it had the benefit of novelty).  9. It is a characteristic of the Cappuccino Writer to describe intimacy in the style of a twelve year old public schoolboy's fetid and gauche imagination.  10. The mention of buggery does not make the Cappuccino Writer dangerous or a pop star. Authors should be cautioned that most women in real life situations do not automatically insist on anal sex.   11. The writer can only write what he knows about him/her self. To develop as a writer you must develop as a person.   12. Writers who stive to maintain a fashionable stance will always be marred by all the limitations and stiltedness which that fashion is formed from. This applies equally to underground or cult fashion as it does to the middle of the road variety.  True writing is the tearing asunder of such restraints, not the pandering to them that we see in England's pathetic drug-culture pretenders.   13. In any period that the writer lives he/she has to say the wrong thing to get it right.  14. Writers that have to be interviewed by Melvin Bragg to be recognised as writers aren't writers.  15. The Cappuccino Writer is distressed because he doesn't have the media status of his Brit Art equivalent. (This is one mercy to be thankful for). He pretends to be a bit dangerous and a bit risky but the biggest danger the Cappuccino Writer runs is not being invited to the right parties.   16. One of the worst things a writer can do is conceive of themselves as a writer whilst writing. The best writing is written by human beings. Besides what kind of an idiot would want to be anything other than a human being? (This is especially true of poetry and poets).  17. In visual arts any new idea (fashion) is presumed to be original and thereby render all previous forms as defunct and old fashioned. In post modern writing the concrete poem and Finnegans Wake are not presumed to make all other forms of writing redundant so, thankfully the writer is forced to at least attempt to communicate in a semi- recognisable language.   18. The probable reason that writers have to communicate in a more accessible manner is because, unlike the visual artist who only needs to pander to a self deceiving elite, the writer is reliant on the general public to buy his or her work. This is one of the most convincing proofs of democracy in action ever encountered.  19. The main advantage of contemporary literature over current established visual art is that it attracts less media attention and is therefore easier to ignore.  20. Revelling in zipless sex, shopping, drug taking and cool, nihilistic posturing is an easy evasion of self and real emotion. Life and depth start where these stop. What we need is the challenge of being human, to put it mildly.  21. It is a matter of debate whether Dazed and Confused readers or Time Out readers are the most fashion-conscious, cool-conscious and therefore unconscious. Attention to the ephemeral demands of society is in inverse proportion to knowing anything worth knowing.  22. What makes great writing great?   The first stage of meaning is known as understandability and the willingness of the writer to feel that the reader is not utterly beneath their contempt. The second stage of meaning is actually writing something that is worth understanding. Something is not worth understanding in writing if its not worth understanding in life. This is what makes great writing great.  23. Great writing appears to change the world but in fact what it does is to reveal more of what the world truly is.  24. The relationship between objectivity and subjectivity. It is the subjective path that the reader connects with as their own. By subjective we mean the honest uninhibited experience of one's true feelings, motivations, desires and fears. This is not something that can be faked. Any attempt to adopt a predetermined persona is an evasion of the heart. Anything without a heart, by definition is dead.   25. Objectivity is only necessary for the writer to view himself in his subjectivity and prevent a decline into ego-mania and ultimately a lonely and penniless death in Hastings.   26. The writer must be bold and compassionate. He must have belief, or at least try to understand his lack of it. It is the writer's duty to consider the reader. A bit of consideration is good.  27. The writer who strives and sticks with his work inevitably comes up against his/her own limitations time and time again. This is the point where the writer cannot find solutions in writing alone, writing is there to serve life, life is greater and more demanding than writing can ever be.   Summary  On inspection there would appear to be fewer problems with contemporary writing than with contemporary visual arts, but both have the problem of being spiritually bankrupt. (Except poetry, which on the whole has the problem of being utterly tedious).  Despite the benefit of centuries of literature the Modern writer still manages to sound less developed, less contemporary and less vital than his dead predecessors. He tries to sound big and brave when in truth he is scared of his own farts.   Post Modernism's reflex recourse to a stance of invulnerability tourniquets emotion. If you don't experience life more keenly after reading a piece of writing then that writing is a lamentable failure. If you feel your soul is depleted after reading a piece of writing then you can expect to see that writer on the South Bank Show.  Sometimes a savage truth in the writing leads the reader to feel numbed horror, this is the revealing of iron in the soul from the burning off of the encrustation of complacency. This is good writing. This does not appear on the South Bank Show.   I think the  urlLink Underground Literary Alliance  would concur.

       No talent required  Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond's  urlLink   The Manual   is now rightly viewed as a seminal and much-adhered to template on how to have a number one the easy way.  The following is a section (written in 1996) from the Stewart Home-edited anthology  urlLink  Mind Invaders   (Serpent's Tail, 1997).  While there's an air of Malcolm McLaren monologue about it, eight years on it was disturbingly prescient and author(s) Luther Blissett later achieved  urlLink infamy in their own right ...   TEN POINT GUIDE TO BEING A CULT ARTIST  Contemporary art knows it's the new rock and roll.  Successful young British artists like Damien Hirst crop up everywhere - from society gossip columns to the feature pages of   Hello!  magazine.  So if you fancy attending upmarket social gatherings and being driven around in a limo, then why not try your hand at cultural terrorism? Becoming a nouveau is easy.  It certainly doesn't require any talent.  Here's how to do it.  1. RECOGNITION: It's your image that sells the product.  This is the ultimate form of branding.  Gilbert and George are famous as the artists who wear business suits.  Create a visual look and stick with it.  2. PLAGIARISM: Originality is for losers.  Don't waste time on researching and developing new ideas - let others do this for you.  Famous artists are inspired by their less successful peers, the ones who starve in garrets.  Necessity might be the mother of invention, but there's no point in going hungry when you could be funding meals in expensive restaurants through acts of cultural theft.  Cindy Sherman is famous for making photographic versions of Old Masters.  3. NUDITY: Former stockbroker turned art superstar Jeff Koons married the Italian porn queen Cicciolina and then used her as a model in his work.  Everyone is interested in sex, which is why tits and bums are favourite subject matter of great artists.  So don't waste your time with 'deep' subjects.  Everything seedy is grist to the cult artist's mill.  Since they've no experience of street life, rich art patrons are always attracted to decadent, debasing and degenerate subject matter.  Select topics that are considered taboo.  4. EGOISM: If you don't believe in yourself, then nobody else will.  You must make extravagant claims for your work.  Sow confusion, so that even professional critics doubt their ability to correctly judge the value of the things you do.  Modern art is like the Emperor who had no clothes, as long as its unfounded claims about giving access to a higher realm of experience remain unchallenged, the rich and gullible will continue to invest money in stuffed sharks and houses filled with concrete.  The highly successful Danish painter Asger Jorn once claimed that 'artistic research is identical to human science, which for us means concerned science, not purely historical science'.  5. PUBLICITY: Most successful artists begin their careers by praising their own work under a variety of pen name.  While homages of this type rarely make it into the national press, the letters pages of obscure art journals are filled with them.  As you become increasingly successful, your sheer financial clout will force critics to pay attention to your work.  The glossy catalogue accompanying the recent exhibition  Chaos II  by Scandinavian artist Jens Jorgan Thorsen was filled with over-the-top praise from art critics.  In fact, Thorsen was responsible for all the writing in the catalogue, which included an essay entitled  Jens Jorgen Thorsen's Paintings Defy The Laws of Gravity.   6. ADDICTION: Heroin, crack and other hard drugs do nothing to aid the creative process, but the general public likes to believe that the 'genius' has no control over his or her creative outpourings.  Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate the image of addiction without actually becoming an addict.  All sorts of ruses can be used, from having needle marks tattooed up your arms to pouring gallons of whiskey down the sink and then littering your studio with the empty bottles.  7. INCITE THE YOUNG AGAINST THE OLD: Art lovers are mainly old and rich; if you bad-mouth them in public, they will shower you with money and gifts.  Your abusive words feed their delusion that it's possible to buy into the culture of the young and hip.  However, do make sure that you know how to hold a knife and fork correctly.  You must be on your best behaviour when spending the weekend at the family seat of important patrons.  The works of the futurist group are collected by museums precisely because F.T.Marinetti, the leader of the movement, wrote that futurism 'will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.'  8. DON'T GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY: Andy Warhol, the most successful artist of the post-war period, had a huge entourage of assistants to help ease the tedium of the creative process.  So pay someone else to make your work.  A successful artist is a middle-class professional, not an artisan.  The cult artist is only interested in the bottom line.  9. MARRY MONEY: There are two kinds of capital: financial and cultural.  The cult artist wants both.  The successful artist exploits the old maxim that fools and their money are easily parted.  Selling a work of art is a one-off transaction.  If someone wealthy is rash enough to marry you, then you can make them pay through the nose for their folly.  The English painter Ralph Rumney was big news in the late fifties.  After he married into the art-loving and super-rich Guggenheim family, his painting became something of a hobby.  10. DEATH: Great artists are perceived as being immortal.  Nevertheless, if the value of your work suddenly erodes, then death is often the smartest career move.  Faking your own suicide then disappearing is relatively painless; doing it for real requires the kind of commitment that exposes your assimilation into the  haute-bourgeoisie  as having been, at best, partial.  It is the cult artist's output, and not the artist, that is supposed to be vulgar.  New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat was a hot property in the mid-eighties; when it all went wrong he topped himself and a retrospective show of all his paintings is currently on at the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gore.   Perhaps the time is right for a  TEN POINT GUIDE TO BEING A CULT AUTHOR ?

       You're so vain, you probably think this blog is about you   urlLink The Bookslut  on Toby Young:   "Just in case you didn't hate Toby Young enough the first time he released a book, the vile and unsympathetic  How to Lose Friends & Alienate People  (you can read the Bookslut review here, which begins with, "You can probably tell a lot about a person by knowing at which point during  How to Lose Friends and Alienate People  he or she started to hate Toby Young."), he's writing another book. While he's writing that book, he's writing a diary for Slate:   I've only been in Los Angeles for 10 days, but this theory makes a lot of sense to me. In the same way that other cities have been ravaged by certain drugs, L.A. is in the grip of a fame epidemic. Like cocaine, it used to be the drug of choice for a privileged few, but now it's gone mainstream, often in a very adulterated form. The kind of notoriety that comes from appearing on a reality show, for instance, is the equivalent of crack. In effect, a few unscrupulous pushers have worked out how to cook fame in a microwave, and as a result an entire generation of Americans has been decimated.   Yeah, we get it. It's a drug metaphor. Now stop it."   I also enjoyed some  urlLink email correspondence the Bookslut received recently  from a rather unappreciative reader of her blog:   Your website bookslut, is the most ridiculous, dehumanizing book site I have ever seen. If you want to use the title bookslut, have a naked man reading, not a women. It is insulting to women and just plain stupid.  You should be ashamed of yourself. No self-respecting person would be a part of this.  You could have named your group anything, but chose that. You are silly and nasty.  Lee   So they do humour bypass operations on the NHS these days then? Joe Bloggs' more sensitive readers have fallen silent of late recently, thankfully.

       "I feel your disease..."  Simon Hattenstone in today's  Guardian  on  urlLink being a 'financial phobic' :   "I am a sick, sick man with a sick, sick condition. I was financially phobic when I was broke, and I am still financially phobic now that I have a decent job. I know there will be readers screaming that if I was on the dole, I would know the value of money etc but I'm afraid you are wrong. Just ask Dr Brendan Burchell of Cambridge University, whose web page confirms that I am one of Britain's nine million sufferers.   Financial phobics, he says, experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms. I go down his list and tick off every symptom: no, of course I don't open my statement when it arrives; sure, bills are left at the doorstep; yes, I do feel sick and dizzy when faced with the prospect of managing money.   But there's more. I don't have a wallet. I can't have a wallet. I do keep my very few plastic cards - press card, Man City card, work entrance card, Blockbusters card, cashpoint card, M&S card and Halifax card (my partner sent off for the last two, and I don't know how to use them) - in a plastic card holder, but it isn't a wallet. And the transparent plastic has come away from the blue plastic so the holder doesn't even hold properly.   I keep my money in my pockets, alongside my tube tickets, receipts, Post-It notes and silver sweet wrappings. Almost invariably, when I'm searching for my tube card, I drop a fiver. Or a tenner. Or more. My children have started following me so they can pick up my droppings. The other day I dropped a wrapped-up wad of three 20s. Alix picked it up and handed it back - I have never seen such contempt on a child's face before."    On reading this, I was like,  "I'm not the only one!"  (well I'd heard other  Guardian  columnists  urlLink proclaim such things before , but they don't count) and sank back into the seat of the London Routemaster bus as I prepared to turn in for another day of wage slavery.  It's true though, I never check the balance for my account and just hope for the best at cash machines.  My life is one long story of  "I'm sorry, that card's been rejected" .  I'm not a Communist (anymore) but I'd pay good money to see the Board of Barclays Bank plc liquidated in some kind of Ba'athist-style massacre of anti-Saddam dissidents.  Then my sympathy for Hattenstone evaporated like a racist football commentator's broadcasting career:   "My partner estimates that I lose about £100 a week. I have to rationalise my losses to justify my existence - "Well," I say, "I don't go out for a curry every night like I used to and I'm smoking much less so I can afford to lose some money." It's pathetic and embarrassing and humiliating."    Well, you might say,  "At least he has the honesty and candour to own up to this."  -- yes, but at what cost? I don't know how many pence per word the  Guardian  pay their columnists, but I'd wager they could afford to lose £100 running for the bus, as we used to say up North.  Us  real  financial phobics do not have that luxury.

       Zine Scene  A visit to the  urlLink ICA bookshop  today (Phillip Dodd, if you're reading this, I plug your place constantly -- I deserve a discount I think) and I am few pounds lighter, in the wallet that is.  Notable additions to the magazine rack in my toilet at home include the latest   urlLink Chap   magazine (worth it for their 'Letter from T' North' and 'Chap Towns' spoof) and   urlLink The Idler   (which is worth it for their 'Ladies of Leisure' feature, which includes an entry from yours truly).  I also laid my hands on a copy of the launch issue of   urlLink Kulture  , a publication as Shoxtonian as some bloke with an ironic mullet under his trucker's cap stood outside Old Street tube station and an ESG album under his arm for effect.  Nice Bobby Gillespie interview though, as well as a good Cramps/Suicide/Throbbing Gristle thread throughout.

       Citations du jour   "If it hadn't been for books, we'd have been completely at the mercy of sex."  "I thought that being a Communist was a penalty you had to pay for being interested in politics.  It was the adolescence of politics, an awkward stage you had to pass through.  But when it came to modern art, I was afraid that maybe the others were right, that I'd never be hip or sophisticated, would never belong.  I'd never know that smug sense of being of my time, of being contemporary.  Perhaps this sounds like a fuss over nothing, but when you're young, everything matters, everything is serious... The life we led depended on modern art.  Without that, all we had was a dirty apartment."  "Hell hath no fury like a famous poet's wife."   - Anatole Broyard,  Kafka Was The Rage , 1993

       Paradise SE14/SE8  Amidst the pogo-ing, spitting, pissing masses at a recent Art Brut event at the Paradise Club -- where the band warmed the cockles of our south east London hearts with the chant-along 'New X' (if that’s what the song is called) -- it’s clear that the nouvelle vague (or new wave as we say down here) really has washed up on the banks of Deptford/New Cross.  But, hey, all this poptastic groovy nowness isn’t merely a new thing, as punk historian Neil Gordon-Orr made clear in a pre-band sales pitch for his booklet  Deptford Fun City . This lovingly researched, comprehensive tract traces the manor’s history and music from the peasants’ revolt to punk rock and beyond. Neil, who takes annual guided walks around the area, and who has flown the SE14 flag on Resonance FM and Radio 5’s Robert Elms show, certainly knows his stuff -- check the massive bibliography. Anyone who has any interest in the new New Cross bands  would do well to check their antecedents (This Heat, Desperate Bicycles, Test Dept, Band of Holy Joy, ATV, June Brides,  et al ) in this smart publication.

       How to Make An American Quilt -- English version   urlLink 'Controversial' YBA makes quilt for schoolchildren  as part of gesture to the community, giving a little back and all that.  Cash-strapped school  urlLink decides to sell said quilt , while it's still possible to capitalise on said YBA's name.   urlLink YBA has strop , if anyone's going to make money it's her (said YBA recently derided reviewers who pay their mortgages by rubbishing people).  Said YBA refuses to authenticate said quilt, rendering it worthless (how on earth could she deny it's not hers now?).  Suitable  urlLink media storm whipped up , ensuring said YBA receives more publicity.   urlLink Stuckist  gets slated in crap newspaper aimed at All Bar One's key demographic.  Stuckist writes letter in response:   "ANDREW Renton (Artists' licence, 6 April) condemns me as "confused", "illogical", "chip-on-shoulder" and "complaining".  Yet at the same time he staunchly defends the "wayward" art of Stella Vine, my ex-wife and Tracey Emin against accusations of churlishness over her patchwork quilt for schoolchildren.  Renton says "we have to allow artists to be unreasonable and selfish" and "art is defined by the artist".  Are there two sets of standards? One for Saatchi artists - another for Stuckist artists? Charles Thomson, co-founder of the Stuckists, Shoreditch, EC2."   The  urlLink Stuckist Gallery  is London's refuge from benefactor-sponsored consumerist tat, check it out if you're in the area.  I've always found it peculiarly ironic that the Saatchi Gallery is sited in County Hall.  County Hall was home to the  urlLink GLC  between 1965 and 1986.  In 1979, Charles Saatchi helped mastermind Margaret Thatcher's election victory and a collision course was set with the socialist administration of Ken Livingstone elected to County Hall in 1981.  Because of Britain's unwritten constitution, Thatcher was at liberty to abolish the GLC, simply because she didn't approve of its popularity with Londoners and its politically-unfashionable interventionist policies.  Following abolition, the County Hall was sold off for a song and dismembered by hotels, aquariums and art galleries -- the latter being owned by a certain Charles Saatchi, mastermind of Margaret Thatcher's election victory in 1979.  If it had happened in any other country people would claim it was corrupt.  So it's even more richly ironic that Tracey Emin is happy to boost the election coffers of Ken Livingstone (now esconced downriver in a Norman Foster-designed City Hall) using money obtained from commissions by... a certain Charles Saatchi.  Swings and roundabouts, I guess, though digs at Ms Emin are never likely to go down well with the Shoxtonian tendency.

Once staffed by the mighty Elizabeth Young and something of a refuge from postcard punks and provincial types looking for the Good Mixer.  2. For Books, Cowcross Street, London --  a good source of secondhand fiction and political science textbooks at knockdown prices when I was a student.  Staffed by the most philosophical Irishman I've ever met and always a source of good conversation about the proponderence of bastards in the world.  3. Cleveland Comics Centre, Prince Regent Street, Stockton-on-Tees --  introduced me to  Deadline Magazine  and all other manner of study avoidance in the early 90s.   There are some others, I'm sure.  Easter weekend was rather hectic, with limited net access and all manner of drunken extended birthday pursuits on Sunday night in Shoreditch (I was not impressed with the staff of the Bricklayers' Arms donning Playboy costumes in the name of 'Easter' -- you can take irony too far you know).

       Maybe I ought to start charging...   urlLink A perplexing email  lands on the  3AM  doormat (you'll have to imagine that metaphorically) this weekend from the  urlLink London News Review  stable.  You may remember  urlLink a few weeks ago I discussed  this Brick Lane-centered publication and advised its linchpin and propagandiser-in-chief Paul Carr to stick to his Internet publishing career.  Some minor umbrage was taken at my criticisms of the  London News Review  (later cleared up) and the course was set.  A few weeks later... it turns out that Paul will be concentrating purely on his considerable portfolio of net publishing interests and leaving the  London News Review .  So what has brought this on, you may or may not ask? Well...   "The London News Review is at a critically important phase of its development - a phase where external investment is being introduced in order to guarantee the paper's future in print. And to provide the company with new and larger fridges. Inevitably, one of the conditions of this investment involves ceding a certain amount of control over the editorial content of the paper to outside forces. From a commercial point of view, this makes perfect sense. But from an editor's point of view, it's not something Paul feels entirely comfortable with."     "[C]eding a certain amount of control over the editorial content of the paper to outside forces" ? Blimey, not surprised he's off, laptop and ADSL cables trailing behind him.  I know I'd be.  Our Publisher forced us to accept Google ads on the site, just to pay for a revamp (which is sat on some bod in Seattle's Apple Mac at the moment, but I've seen it and it looks fab, honest), so I need talk.  But I did draw the line at AdultFriendFinder.com.  Here's to the Internet, anyhow.  Though even that has its fair share of  urlLink detrius  and roadkill...  Speaking of which, another member of the Stevens clan to go online is my cousin,  urlLink Geoff .  Geoff's  urlLink an actor in Hollywood , of all places, and has taken to advertising his repertoire on the net for any budding Senor Spielbergos who fancy casting 'some English guy' in one of their films (sorry, 'movies').  I like the way he gets in the first line of his biog that we went to the same secondary school as Jamie Bell of  Billy Elliot  fame (well obviously he didn't mention me, but that's not the point).  Actually, there's only three males of our generation in the female-centric Stevens family and his brother (who also went to Northfield School) is a model in Brazil.  I'm under no pressure, obviously...  And another site that merits a mention via the tried and tested technique of pouring flattery on  3AM  is the  urlLink Lost in Hype  blog, which I assume hails from Manchester.   3AM  Co-Editor HP Tinker was getting all lonely up there on his own but soon there'll be another two Co-Editors from the Liverpool/Manchester megalopolis joining him.  For something with a supposidly global remit,  3AM  is definitely acquiring a curiously English flavour, a curiously  Northern  English flavour.  A good job we're adding another London-based Co-Editor then, just for balance of course.

       Literary awards ceremony in 'dumbed down' shock  Evidence of the literary world's slide into a deepening commercial abyss was in manifest evidence at the  urlLink British Books Awards  recently.  As  urlLink Jordan  stepped up to the podium, prompted by hosts Richard and Judy with mentions of her own forthcoming magnum opus, and merely announced DBC Pierre's name to rapturous applause (he was only nominated), I could watch no more (I don't care if she has huge tits).  As you can imagine, Mark Haddon, Lynn Truss and  urlLink Alexander McCall Smith  walked away very content, with Monica Ali also receiving a gong or two.  I wonder if the other  3am Magazine  [sic.] was there? Probably, or at least in spirit anyhow.

       Helen Walsh  Helen Walsh's debut  Brass  has just been published by  urlLink Canongate  to great acclaim, with  urlLink rave write-ups  all over the shop.  Once again,  urlLink 3AM  took a few moments to grill her on Scousers, literary influences and transgenderism:  3AM: What compelled you to write your novel? How would you categorise your writing style?  HW: I've always been besotted with the cathedral area of Liverpool. With its cobbled streets and delicious and diverse melt of people it has to be the most bohemian red light sprawl in Europe. I used to cycle into Uni, and on my way home, I'd pass through its meandering cobbled streets, to watch the girls ply their trade outside the Georgian houses of dons and barristers. As a teenager, I found that an incredibly romantic sight.  The character Millie was more a product of my time in Barcelona. Again the red light district there is very glamorous, but it is also very fluid. There is something for everyone regardless of your gender or sexuality. Perfect for someone like Millie. Jamie was more a product of my time spent with young Liverpool men. I trained at a boys' boxing gym in South Liverpool and that's where I picked up the nuances of the South Liverpool accent. Like many working class young men in South Liverpool, Jamie is decent, honest, hardworking but seems to be supressed by the strong moral codes he espouses.  3AM: How do you feel about the positive reaction  Brass  has  received? Do you worry it'll make your more complacent about future books or that you have expectations to live up to?  HW: When I wrote  Brass , I wrote a book, quite selfishly for me -- I wrote something that I would want to read.  It's brilliant then, that it's had such a positive reaction.  Expectations are always high for a writer's second novel, but I'm not stressed. You have to shut yourself off from the outside world, and I guess, just write what's in your heart.  3AM: Much of the publicity you've received homes in on aspects of your background -- does this annoy you? To that extent, how did these factors influence what you write about?  HW: No, not at all. I made a decision before  Brass  was released not to shy away from questions about my background because I wanted to defend my characters. I wanted to authenticate them. I wanted people to believe that Millie's sexuality is a very real product of modern city life.   3AM: What about locality, how important is that to you?  HW: Very much so.  Brass  could not have been written in any other city but Liverpool. It is a Liverpool novel.  3AM: You've lived on the continent, as well as England.  Do you view yourself as belonging to Europe, England, Liverpool or in a more international sense?  HW: I'm always getting teased by fellow Scousers for not being the real thing. I was born in Warrington which makes me a 'Wool!' I have huge amounts of affection for Liverpool, and I can't see myself living anywhere else in the UK. My family live in Warrington though and I love going back there.  3AM: What other contemporary writers do you rate at the moment? What about influences?  HW: Laura Hird, Louise Welsh, Maggie Estep... which is weird cos all my influences as an adolescent were very male -- Bukowski, Dostoyevksi, Steinbeck, Fante and more recently, Irvine Welsh, Niall Griffiths and Kevin Sampson.  3AM: If your writing addresses issues of sexuality, how do you avoid any negative portrayal?  HW: I don't. I've always been very open and honest about sex and sexuality. I've grown up in an environment where homosexuality, transgenderism and other sexual minorities have had as much authority as heterosexuality.

       Indie Obscura Day 3  Joe Bloggs is sad to regret the demise of Indie Obscura Day, which is something best left for down-the-pub discussions with ICA staff (like last Friday night).  That said, the drummer out of Mint 400 (a possible candidate themselves) agreed with me that a site devoted to such discussions is necessary.  This week's (final) 'victim' is Brighton band Jesus Couldn't Drum, who get an inclusion by merit of name alone.  Take it away lads...  allmusic.com entry:  There isn't one.  Shame on them!   Little-known factoid:  One of them did some 'programming work' for the Stone Roses.   Where now?:  tropicola@hotmail.com

       3AM: an apology  One or two recipients of  3AM 's monthly mail-out (sign up at  urlLink www.3ammagazine.com , if you already haven't) have written in to express alarm at the fact that when I put said mail-out together (alongside eight-million other different things) I managed to confuse a few "its" and "it's".  I don't know if said correspondents have taken Lynn Truss' (or should that be "Truss's")  Eats, Shoots and Leaves  a bit too literally, but on behalf of all the team at  3AM , I apologise whole-heartedly and sincerely.  Clearly this is a mistake of a Beverley Hughes-esque magnitude and corrective action will be taken henceforth.  Despite being paid to write stuff for a living, somewhere along the line I became an absolute imbecile, it seems.    For those of you who didn't receive a copy in your in-box, on top of the round-up of recent  3AM  articles and mention of our Good Sex Prize, there was also a call for people who might be interested in assisting on the  3AM  global team by way of working on non-fiction pieces for us and subbing interviews.  Highly unpaid but also highly rewarding.  Shoot an email to the usual address if you're interested.

       Aniruddha Bahal  Recently  urlLink Aniruddha Bahal  (investigative journalist, author of the excellent  Bunker 13  and winner of last year's  Literary Review  'Bad Sex Prize') took some time out to speak to  urlLink  3AM  :  3AM: How did it feel to receive the  Literary Review 's Bad Sex Prize?   AB: It was an enjoyable evening and I think much less of a stigma than is imagined by some people. It's quite funny and I had a good time.  3AM: Did it improve sales of the book?   AB: A little bit but nothing dramatic. It's good profiling for the author though and many people come to know about your work.  3AM: Do you feel such an award should exist?  AB: There's no harm in it. As it is books and anything related to books doesn't really get the space in mainstream media that it should get hence this creation of novelties to try and interest the media.  3AM: Do you feel contemporary Indian fiction shuns or avoids discussion of sex?   AB: I shouldn't think so. Though socially there is a moral position on sex as it is in many societies. In India it is a rather less freer position than what it was in ancient Hindu society.  3AM: How do you view the role of sex in contemporary Indian society in general?  AB: It's not as healthy as it could be. But much goes on behind closed doors. For the males though there is a huge repression problem which manifests itself in crimes like rape, the majority of them going unreported.  3AM: Do you see yourself as a specifically Indian author or as more belonging to the republic of letters in a more general sense?  AB: It would be too discomforting to be slotted as an Indian author in the longer run. I guess it is unavoidable though in your first few books.  3AM: Your book approaches both politics and journalism in India with a cynical mindset.  Do you agree with this assertion? To what extent are these specifically Indian problems?  AB: My background is in journalism and journalists as a rule are much more cynical than others. This has to do with them getting exposed to the seamier side of human nature almost everywhere. There is nothing Indian about it. I think it applies universally.  3AM: How did you develop the character of MM? The first person narration with the emphasis on the reader is very unusual -- how did you develop this?  AB: The tone is something which I thought would immerse the reader more in that particular material. Put him or her in a cockpit like situation. And I think it has worked that way.  3AM: What fictional influences do you have?  AB: Influences would be a strong word. But I have many favourites. I love the British classics. Then, of course, I love the American writers that came up in the 60s and 70s. The Joseph Hellers, Tom Wolfes, Ken Kaseys etc. I think there is much more energy and direction with American writing these days.   3AM: You're a journalist -- what journalists (past and present) do you rate?  AB: Any journalist who has had the courage to take on a system or peoples and has suffered for bringing out the truth but has done it regardless.  3AM: You edit a website -- how do you view the internet's role as part of the media? Hype or the only show in town?  AB: The internet is here to stay. Most of us so-called literate browse the net one or two hours a day on an average. It has taught mainstream media to be more supple and brought in the concept of a continuous deadline.  3AM: What do you plan next to bring about some controversy for yourself?  AB: Well, I am working on some things. Both fiction as well as non-fiction. I don't as a rule go hunting for controversy. It's not a very relishing experience.  Though sometimes it is unavoidable because of the nature of your work.

        3AM  Good Sex Prize  Call it crass, call it shameless opportunism, call it getting even with the literary establishment... off-beat literary magazine   urlLink 3AM   announces its Inaugural Good Sex Prize in 2004.  The accolade, which will be presented to an author nominated by readers of the magazine and judged by other authors, will make its first appearance mid-year at exactly six months before/after the  Literary Review 's  urlLink now infamous award .   3AM 's editors hope it will not only represent a countervailing force to what has become yet another token literary awards ceremony alongside the Booker  et al , but will actually celebrate genuine and forceful writing about sex in literature.  We probably can't manage a swanky ceremony with some out-of-context celebrity handing the thing over, but we might stretch to a few bottles of Hoegaarden in some East End art gallery.  Readers who wish to nominate an author (whose work must have been published between May 2003 and April 2004) should send their nominations to andrew@3ammagazine.com by May 1st 2004.  Alternatively, authors can themselves write in with their own nomination and a tie-breaker along the lines of  "I deserve to win the  3AM  Good Sex Award because..."  (in 25 words or less).  No correspondence entered into, the judges' decision is final etc etc.

       In praise of wry footnotes  As everybody in the know knows by now,  urlLink The Dust Bunnies  are gearing up for their  urlLink first gig  to be held at a secret location in Paris on  12 June . During yesterday's rehearsal, The Bunnies introduced four new songs into their minimalist set: "Howard Devoto's Spectacles" (an instrumental), "Hugging the Wrong Tree" (think early Cure played by a stroppy mod band), "In Praise of Wry Footnotes" (difficult to describe) and "Why Is There Something (When There Could Be Nothing)", a ramalama take on the old theological chestnut which caused sporadic outbreaks of pogoing ("leaps of faith," as I put it, rather wittily, to someone whose name escapes me) among the band's burgeoning following.They wrapped up the evening by covering "Boredom" (The Buzzcocks), "White Riot" (The Clash) and (for the first — and probably last — time) "Venus" (Television) at a leisurely pace. The whole thing was reminiscent of jackrabbits lolloping in the sun. You get my drift.

They should be a great act live, for those of you who are in the New York area (not really my case).

       Psychogeographic Shack, that's where it's at  Turn out of New Cross station, down Amersham Vale, past the pet hospital, allotments, police station and Deptford Green secondary school.  Turn left onto Edward Street, past the Celestial Church of Christ, past the tube drivers' staff room and under the railway lines.  Continue round so you're on Sandford Street with Canary Wharf now in view, past all the England flags hanging off council flat balconies and Vietnamese slogans in windows.  Pass BJ's cafe and continue on where it morphs into Trundleys Road, up past all the scrap yards and under the railway arches with fly-tipped sofas underneath them, past all the Millwall banners on houses and cars, past the derelict Rival Envelope Co. Ltd depot and the Old Manor House pub onto Bush Road to navigate the one-way system around Surrey Quays tube station.  Pass Tantastic and the Docklands Cafe with their Millwall banners and cross at the pawnbrokers to get onto the Lower Road, where the Swiss Re Tower comes into view, passing Jubilee Sandwiches, La Cigale and the Surrey Docks pub.  Then past Surrey Quays tube station up to the pedestrian crossing (replete with half-torn BNP St George stickers) next to The Caulkers pub with its Millwall banners up, past The China Hall pub and the Swedish Seaman's Church.  Cross the road and turn onto Surrey Quays Road, past the old Dock Offices and Canada Water tube station and continue round onto Needleham Street, past the printing works for the  Daily Mail  and  Evening Standard , taking care to traverse the plot of wasteland-cum-skatepark and down a path through unkept shrubbery onto the Albion Estate, past all the Millwall banners, before coming onto Brunel Road and past the Adam and Eve pub with its Respect sticker outside, whereupon you enter Rotherhithe tube station and travel through the orange 70s decor, onto the platform and take a train through the Brunel-built tunnel one stop under the River Thames to Wapping tube station, alighting here.  Travel up Wapping Lane, past the warehouses-cum-yuppie flats, past the White Swan pub and the unclean water of Tobacco Dock, turning left onto The Highway, then right onto Dellow Street.  Then you turn right onto Cable Street, past Shadwell tube station, then right onto Watney Street, past the Old House at Home pub and Shadwell DLR station and onto Watney Market before hitting Commercial Road, turning right there to pass the disused synagogue and turning left up Jubilee Street, site of the anarchist social club in the late 1800s/early 1900s, past a solitary West Ham FC banner.  Turn right onto Adelina Street, past the Rinkoff Bakery (the last remaining Jewish bakery in the East End) and onto Sidney Street, site of the seige of Sidney Street by Russian anarchists in 1911, before turning left onto Whitechapel Road, past the infamous Blind Beggar pub of Kray Twins fame.  Continue up Whitechapel Road, past the Grave Maurice pub of Morrissey fame, past Urban Bar and the Royal London Hospital, before passing the East London Mosque, Indo bar and the Rhythm Factory club then the Nag's Head strip bar ("£10 - girl of your choice").  Pass the Aldgate East tube and the Whitechapel Gallery (maybe checking out Freedom Books the anarchist bookseller down Angel Alley) and up Osborn Street onto the now infamous Brick Lane of Banglatown, up past a plethora of Indian restaurants, before hitting the Old Truman Brewery with Cafe 1001, 93 Feet East and the Vibe Bar.  This then brings you to Shoreditch tube station.  You have just walked the entire length of the East London Line.

       20 Questions  Well, I've exhausted the list of people I wanted to feature on here -- only one refused outright and one never replied -- I don't know if any of the other  3AM  bloggers have anyone in mind they'd like to approach.  One blogger even suggested to me that bloggers reading could this cut and paste the questions and send in responses to me, completely random and unsolicited.  Yeah, I could go with that.  In any case, here's  urlLink Sarah Weinman 's two-penneth:  Why do you blog?  So many reasons -- love, obsession, addiction -- but ultimately, I started the blog back in October because I felt that crime fiction wasn’t well represented in the 'sphere, and I could do so in a way that would attract those in the genre and those outside of it. As long as I still find things to talk about -- I’m amazed I still can, really -- I’ll still blog.     What are your favourite blogs?  Oh god, so many--it’s a little scary how many I do read and enjoy.  The usual lit suspects, of course (between Mark and Moorish Girl’s interviews, I think they’ve all been covered) because they cover literature so passionately, honestly and with such distinctive complementary voices. I’ll add five more:  urlLink Roger L. Simon  because he’s a hell of a writer who’s trying to come to terms with changing politics in a changing world; the fiendish mind of  urlLink Uncle Grambo  and his "goofy patois"; the duo of  urlLink Maccers  and  urlLink Eurotrash  who never fail to make me laugh out loud in the most unladylike way, and because I can,  urlLink Something Old, Nothing New  a new retro arts-and-culture that my older brother Jaime has just begun, because I learn something new all the time from it, and he knows more esoterically cool stuff than almost anyone else.     What are you reading at the moment?  Donald Westlake’s second Dortmunder crime novel,  Bank Shot , and Norman Green’s  Shooting Dr Jack.    What is the best book you've ever read?   I’ll never be certain of that so instead I’ll offer up the best group of books I’ve ever read—the novels of Ross Thomas. Though I haven’t made it through them all, I’ve never been disappointed by his wit, sardonic humor, and impeccably twisty plots. And his astuteness for what really goes on in the underbelly of politics. I suspect he’d have had quite a lot of material with what is currently going on...    What is your favourite poem?  Shel Silverstein’s 'The Smoke Off', because it’s just so much fun to read aloud. I did that a few years ago at a group reading in Montreal and people stared at me slack-jawed when I was done. It was great.    Who is your favourite musician(s)?  A toss-up between Loreena McKennit and the Klezmatics.     What is your favourite quote?   "Why do you write?" "To keep from dying." -- Janine Boissard,  A Time to Choose  (English translation of  Moi, Pauline! )    How did you vote in the last election?  Liberal, because there wasn’t anyone else to vote for. Damned if I’m going to vote for them this time around.    What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  Ignorance and a lack of curiosity.    What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  "Nobody cares." Harsh, but very liberating as well.     When do you view it permissible to lie?  When telling the truth would cause more damage than lying.     If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My bootleg copy of Shel Silverstein’s  Fuck ‘Em  because only about seven copies exist and I worked too hard to get mine.     Define pleasure.  Getting completely and utterly lost in a book. Coming home and finding free books waiting for me. Knowing that my advice helped someone achieve their goals and dreams.     Define pain.  A raging ear infection that persists for a good month and a half, which felled me last fall. Labor has to be less painful than that.     What animal would you most like to be?  Honestly, being a human is hard enough without thinking of what animal I’d like to be.    What has been your best blogging experience?  The friends I’ve made, hopefully for life. The fact that I wouldn’t have had almost any of my print freelance gigs without the blog. And any time I find an offbeat little nugget that people will enjoy.     What has been your worst blogging experience?  When I thought I had pissed off the MWA (Mystery Writers of America) with one of my rants. It got smoothed over, but I worried about it for too long.     Who are your heroes (in any field)?  Charles Hirsch, the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City, for so many reasons, but mostly because of his stalwart leadership of the OCME during and after 9/11. He doesn’t grandstand or court the media, just does his job and does it amazingly well. And if he ever writes his memoirs, I’ll be the first in line to read them.     Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  Bob Newhart.     What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  A de-stresser machine.

       20 Questions  The lady gets name-checked a lot by other bloggers, so who better to have on here than  urlLink Maud Newton ?  Why do you blog?  I started on a lark, on a blogspot blog, while procrastinating on my writing.  Over time I focused more on books and moved the blog to its current location.  Now it's a compulsion.   What are your favourite blogs?  Oh, God, how many can I list? I'm a blog junkie.  Of the literary blogs, just off the top of my head, everyday reads are  urlLink Old Hag ,  urlLink The Elegant Variation ,  urlLink Moorish Girl ,  urlLink Bookninja ,  urlLink Return of the Reluctant ,  urlLink Rake's Progress ,  urlLink Golden Rule Jones ,  urlLink Kitabkhana ,  urlLink The Reading Experience ,  urlLink Beatrice ,  urlLink The Literary Saloon ,  urlLink Splinters ,  urlLink Scribbling Woman ,  urlLink The Mumpsimus ,  urlLink Crooked Timber  and  urlLink Sarah Weinman's site , which concentrates mostly on crime fiction but also includes some unusual publishing links.  I'm sure I'm forgetting somebody. Sean Walsh of  urlLink The London News Review Books Diary  is funny and bright, and I wish he'd update more often.  Of the culture blogs with a wider range, my favorites are  urlLink About Last Night ,  urlLink The Fold Drop ,  urlLink Cup of Chicha  and the venerable  urlLink TMFTML .   urlLink No Rock & Roll Fun  is the best music site -- damn, that guy's hilarious -- and I'll also put in a good word for  urlLink SFJ ,  urlLink Stereogum , and  urlLink Voltage .   urlLink Cinetrix  for film.   urlLink That Brutal Joint  for architecture.  My favorite personal site, hands down, is Dana's  urlLink Twinkle Twinkle Blah Blah Blah Etc .  Also  urlLink Dong Resin . And I love  urlLink The Antigeist , online and in person.  She's an old friend.   What are you reading at the moment?   I've been going back and forth between a bunch of books, including the new John Barth story collection.  Yesterday I was distracted from all of them when McSweeney's Issue 13, the comics issue, arrived in the mail.    It's stunning, possibly the most beautiful book I've ever seen -- hardcover, 316 pages, with a foldout, Sunday comics-style cover.  Inside are fascinating personal essays from Ira Glass and Chris Ware, along with a historical perspective on the art of comics. And it's packed with selections from some of the most prominent contemporary cartoonists. It's a great introduction for the uninitiated like me, those unfamiliar with comics and graphic novels aside from, say,  Ghost World ,  Peanuts , and Spiegelman's  Maus  books.   What is the best book you've ever read?  I'm going to say it's a toss-up between Graham Greene's  The End of the Affair  and Walker Percy's  The Moviegoer.   What is your favourite poem?  "Neutral Tones," by Thomas Hardy. It's structured around bleak wintry images and contains the lines "Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove/ Over tedious riddles solved years ago" and "The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing/Alive enough to have strength to die."   Who is your favourite musician(s)?  Elvis Costello was, for the longest time. In college, I hung four E.C. posters over my bed, scrawled his lyrics all over my jeans, walked around quoting his songs.   But now he's "just a mere shadow of [his] former selfishness," and that makes me sad.  I know it's impossible to stay as angry as he was, or seemed to be, forever. But he's become so self-promoting and obsequious now that it nearly taints his music for me.   Then I listen to "The Beat" from  This Year's Model  or "Beyond Belief" from  Imperial Bedroom , or  My Aim is True  or  King of America  and I feel understood and melancholy all over again.  (That's a good thing.)   What is your favourite quote?  Today I'll say it's Dorothy Parker's "Resume":      "Razors pain you; Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live."    How did you vote in the last election?  For Gore.   What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  American imperialism.   What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  Stick with Maker's Mark.   When do you view it permissible to lie?  I'll lie if someone else needs validation and it's not the kind of lie that will hurt that person in the long run.   If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My cats (although I've got this J.M. Coetzee impulse that tells me its wrong to characterize them as "possessions").  Letters from my grandmother.  My laptop.   Define pleasure.  What's that?   Define pain.  Living in a house with 300 caged birds.   What animal would you most like to be?  A cat, because cats are mysterious and slinky, and I'm not.   What has been your best blogging experience?  Being part of a community that cares about fiction.   What has been your worst blogging experience?  Dealing with the bullshit people project onto my blog.   Who are your heroes (in any field)?  (Cue the sentimental music.) My sister.   Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  That's hard.  Eddie Izzard?  Jon Stewart?  Carol Burnett?  David Cross?  One of those.   What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  Xanax.

       20 Questions  Like the proverbial bus, usually a 205 in my case, you wait ages for one blogger to get back to you with their completed 20 Questions and a whole blogroll's worth do at once.  Today is Steve from  urlLink Splinters  the  urlLink Spike  (not  urlLink spiked ) blog's turn:  Why do you blog?  I have a lot to say and nobody else will listen.   What are your favourite blogs?   urlLink Wood s lot  and  urlLink Lenin's Tomb .   What are you reading at the moment? Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl  by Gert Hofmann.

The beginning of the end of pain.   Define pain.  Oneness!   What animal would you most like to be?  A particular horse.   What has been your best blogging experience?

       Eaten, shot and left?  We all got it for Christmas, but has anyone ever actually read the  urlLink Lynne Truss book?  For quick answers to grammar/spelling/style/punctuation questions without all the irritating, self-congratulatory anecdotes, you're better off with  urlLink  Quite Literally  , the new book from charming pedant Wynford Hicks.  Quick plug there, of course, but he's one of my favourite authors and a super nice guy.

       20 Questions    urlLink Moorish Girl &nbsp;becomes the latest litblogger to answer our&nbsp;20 Questions:   Why do you blog?  I started the blog as a way to keep track of what I was reading on the Internet. Initially there was quite a mix of politics and book-related banter, but lately it's been mostly about books.    What are your favourite blogs?   urlLink Maud Newton  is probably the best book blog around.  urlLink The Elegant Variation  is a must-read.  urlLink Bookninja  always has an unexpected link or article.  urlLink Return of the Reluctant  offers a very eclectic mix of material.  urlLink Literary Saloon  is incredibly thorough. And  urlLink TMFTML  and  urlLink Old Hag  are a good way to start and end the day.    What are you reading at the moment?  I just started a novel by an Arab Israeli author named Sayed Kashua, it's called  Dancing Arabs.   What is the best book you've ever read?  That's a tough one to answer. There are so many books to choose from, and my answer would probably be different depending on when you ask. Today, I'm going to pick  Lolita.   What is your favourite poem?  Anything by Pablo Neruda.    Who is your favourite musician(s)?  Right now I'm listening to a lot of Audioslave.    What is your favourite quote?  No snowflake in an an avalanche ever feels responsible -- Voltaire.    How did you vote in the last election?  Not for Bush. And I plan on keeping it that way in the next election.    What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  The O.C.    What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  "It doesn't matter, we're all going to die, anyway." My husband said that to me once. It helped.    When do you view it permissible to lie?  When you're caught.    If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My laptop.    Define pleasure.  Finding a good book.    Define pain.  Being without Wi-Fi.    What animal would you most like to be?  A bird.    What has been your best blogging experience?  Getting emails from people.    What has been your worst blogging experience?  Getting emails from people.    Who are your heroes (in any field)?  Han Solo.    Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  At the moment, I'd say Jon Stewart.    What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  I'm pretty satisfied with the quality of my life as it is.

       The Others + The Swear, Paradise Bar, New Cross 25/5/04  A thoroughly enjoyable time was had by all at the Paradise Bar in New Cross last night, the epicentre of the SE14 art rock scene according to the  NME  recently.  Invited, nay instructed, by its formidable promoter Caffy St Luce,  3AM  ventured south of the river to see locals  urlLink The Swear  and hotly-tipped Poptones act  urlLink The Others .  You might know The Swear from the much-hyped and now scarce  urlLink Angular  compilation, who were so good they've been invited to appear on the second one as well.  Frontwoman Tycie (who met her bandmates at Goldsmiths College when I was there a few years back) comes across as a proto-early Madonna (post-punk era, of course) with a bit of that one out of the Cardigans for good measure.  Their songs are fraught and tight, with hardcore fan Andrew providing additional vocals, leading on 'Japanese Pop Song'.  The Others will probably rue the day they played such tiny venues as this -- or maybe secretly hanker after them when they're packing them into larger ones.  Alan McGee has invested much stock in this act and while I once sniggered watching him watch Creation failures One Lady Owner at Reading like a wide-eyed child, on this occasion I think he's right.   urlLink The Others  have 'it'.  They shouldn't, coming across as some old indie kids who should know better, but they do.  Recent single 'This Is For The Poor' was kept out of the Top 40 by the Millwall FA Cup single (ironic, given where the Paradise bar is located) but while Millwall limp back into Division One obscurity, The Others will keep on playing regardless of whether anyone wants them to or not.

       Velocity Boy  Over at  urlLink  3AM   today you can read Richard Marshall's interview with artist  urlLink Julian Stallbrass , my scathing review of  urlLink Morrissey's new album  (which has already offended one member  3AM  team so the obsessives at morrissey-solo.com should be marching on Whitechapel by sunset...) and Andrew Gallix's excellent  urlLink Buzzwords  column, which features many many things New Cross.  That and  urlLink Attack! Books'  Tommy Udo's  urlLink blog , where he claims that our event last summer wasn't up to much:  "the 'underground' just seems populated with such boring losers" .  Fine, suit yourself, we don't care.  Speaking of art, Charles Saatchi and the Young British Artists have  urlLink much  to  urlLink cry into their beer over  today (the  Mirror  displayed its  urlLink usual taste and decorum , of course).  Methinks our forthcoming summer event at the  urlLink Stuckist Gallery  on July 3rd might end up being a benefit gig.  Psst! Wanna become a  urlLink Defastenist , the remodernists seeking a return to the cult of the artist (writers can also apply)? Fancy some  urlLink Stereolab ?

       The new rock and roll, broadsheet-style  When it falls out of the paper alongside all other manner of crap and flyers,  The Observer 's  urlLink Music Monthly  section is pored over obsessively.  When it was announced that Music (alongside Food and, yawn, Sport) would be the third component of the paper's added-extras drive to actually maintain people's interest, I was like  "Ex-Select journalists apply here or what?" , though so far I've not seen Sian Pattenden's* byline on any articles.  In yesterday's section, there was a piece on the new  urlLink 'Grime' scene  of East London.  Forgive me for thinking that this is the worst case of over-egged simplistic journalism in search of a story that doesn't exist since Stephen Glass stopped writing for the  New Republic .  I did find author  urlLink Simon Armitage's CD collection make-over  amusing though.   urlLink This   Girls With Guitars  album looks promising too.  (* She wrote for  Select  and such-like in the 1990s, a lot.  What's funnier is what she did afterwards, recorded in detail  urlLink here  on ex-Adorable frontman Pete Fijalkowski's  urlLink post-shoegazer site .  He hasn't changed at all ( "Creation weren't a bad label, they just probably weren't the label for us" ).)  Elsewhere, Damien Hirst is to  urlLink open a bar  in the quaint Devon town of Ilfracombe.   urlLink Charles Thomson  will be barred straight off, I expect.  More  urlLink Morrissey  comeback  urlLink antics  in the usual places.  The dour  urlLink Royal Academy  gets a pasting.   urlLink Irvine Welsh  on Jessa Bookslut's favourite,  urlLink James Kelman 's  You Have To Be Careful In The Land Of The Free .   urlLink More pictures  of The Pixies looking not-so-cool anymore.

       Is there life beyond the M25?  It seems that  urlLink Penguin's ceaseless campaign  to cheapen literature has finally paid off.  In among the lifestyle features of last Friday's  Evening Standard  glossy magazine (for US readers: this is an upscale version of  People ) was a guide to forthcoming literary festivals, this being pitched in a kind of  "go to these and you might see an author of you've heard or meet a dashing chap who reads a lot"  way.  The most famous book festivals are in Hay-on-Wye and Edinburgh and we at  3AM  often contemplate a presence there.  Then I muse  "Yeah, but they're outside of London"  and think no more of it.  You see, unless I'm traveling abroad, as soon as I leave London, I wish I hadn't.  No matter what it is I'm going to, I know I'd have been better off staying in London.  There may be a medical condition for this, I don't know.  Try finding  The Guardian  in Bracknell or decent moisturiser in Dundee.  Anyhow, one festival I can attend, as recommended by the  Standard  (so it must be good) is the  urlLink Clerkenwell Literary Festival  on 9-14 July.  Hell, I can walk home from that.  Bonus!

       Kill Bush 2?  So  urlLink Michael Moore  won the 'Golden Palm' at the Cannes movie festival this week, the highest, most prestigious award in the French movie industry, and more generally one of the most notable in the French artistic scene at large. Watch Moore's reaction, irritatingly dubbed in French,  urlLink here . (choose "Interview / Photo Call Palme d'or : Fahrenheit 911")  The event, viewed from France at least, has its importance. The media attention devoted to the festival each year is comparable to what you usually get for royalty weddings,and Cannes is by many accounts the center of the film world during its week of screenings. In many ways too, Cannes represents a consensual view of cinema in this country, that is, a lot of people identify with at least part of the selection, that ranges from big American productions, virtually assured to be profitable with or without the jury's accolade, to more obscure, in recent years often Asian movies with more unusual aesthetical and/or narrative approaches. The movies that receive awards certainly enjoy a success they would hardly have had without the exposure.  So the impact of Moore's triumph is politically and culturally meaningful, and if I understand Bush's psychology, I wouldn't be surprised if Cannes were now high on his invasion/bombing agenda. The mix of intellectual and popular interest in the Cannes awards ceremony sends a very unambiguous message about France's appreciation of Bush's errings. The secondary debate on the legitimacy of such a political choice in a supposedly exclusively artistic context will certainly not have much weight. The jury, in an unprecedented post-ceremony press conference, felt the need to give artistic justification to their choice, but while I wouldn't question Moore's talent as a film-maker, beyond his politics, his is a cinema of ideas before anything else.   More practically, this could mean that Moore may be able to show his movie to the Americans before the next presidential election in America, something we all hope for, if only for democracy's sake. The (mildly) French left-wing daily newspaper " urlLink Liberation " used the title 'Kill Bush 2' to refer to the event. I very much doubt that in any context, American or European, a work of art can be enough to decide an election, but for once in a very long time, I have not been that ashamed to be French after all. Although to be fair, Quentin Tarantino's tenancy as chairman of the jury may have had some influence on the final decision. If it were only me, he'd be very welcome here if he ever needed political asylum. Same for Moore, but I'd have to ask him to lose the baseball hat. If he's not an ungrateful bastard, Moore should switch to  urlLink berets  now. I'd be happy to send him one if he asks.

       On Naked Ladies  In this good weather you can't help but notice women's bodies.  You notice little things about the girls you meet, like the freckles on their upper arms, or hairy toes, or birdlike ankles, or a fine down covering their cleavage -- but there's nothing quite like the  urlLink Turkish Baths  for the full revelation of what other women really look like naked.    In the baths at York Hall today I learned of the democracy of cellulite, and the immense variety of women's bodies.  There was one stunning hourglass of a black woman in red lace knickers who walked into the steam room covered in foam, and shrieked as she poured cold water over herself with a bucket. There was an Eastern European woman in the shower, with a few teeth missing, and who had strangely discoloured skin on her hips.  There was the white woman lolling like a seal on a slat in the hot room, across from a lithe brunette doing stretches.  There was a woman in her 30s with white horizontal stretch marks across her back.  Then there was the Chinese woman in her 40s, with tattooed eyeliner on her lower lids, who sat on a bench holding a single, melting ice cube.  Almost completely flat-chested, she had nipples that stood out like brown jelly beans, and she had the politest strip of a Brazilian I'd ever seen.      It was a lovely afternoon, subsequently ruined by going to see  urlLink Gillian Wylde's  halfhearted show at  urlLink Toynbee Studios .  After hearing one of GW's pony-tailed entourage sing  Every Day Is Like Sunday  while listening to a walkman, and after suffering a self-indulgent stream-of-consciousness spiel about research and process by la Wylde herself in a quiet monotone, I went to look at the fruits of all this process and research I'd heard so much about.  One was quite fun –- it was a kaleidoscopic video of the artist, playing an electric guitar while topless –- her breasts and arms merged in and out of another psychedelically, sometimes making the whole mess look like a giant nipple-headed musician with a two-necked guitar.  Just after this, however, came another vid of Wylde sticking the stem of an iris up her arse, which was painted brown, and doing what appeared to be kegel exercises in order to waggle the flower around like a tail. After two minutes of exposure to her pulsating anus I was faintly nauseated, but none the wiser as to her artistic intentions.

       Bucketloads of fun for the whole family  I've invented a new game. Think of a difficult word, that is, one that people tend to misspell. Then choose what you think is the most common  incorrect  way people write the word, and type it in Google.    The game is: find the word and the spelling that will bring the highest number of pages under Google.   I've done it with "corcodile", obtained 923 pages. So, technically, I'm the champion so far.  Your turn now.

       Young British Artists have had their day  That's  urlLink the verdict of arts critic Maev Kennedy  in today's  Guardian , commenting on the shortlist for this year's Turner Prize as announced yesterday.   "It's mortgage and Bupa time for them"  apparently.  Anyhow, you can see the shortlisted works  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , with additional broadsheet commentary  urlLink here .  Meanwhile, Charles Saatchi's unsuccessful attempt at rapproachement with the  urlLink Stuckists  makes  The Independent 's Diary column yesterday:  "Charles Saatchi has (unsuccessfully) tried to visit the headquarters of his most vociferous critics, the Stuckist movement. In a possible rapprochement bid, Saatchi and his wife Nigella Lawson pitched up in a black cab outside the Stuckist Gallery in Shoreditch on Saturday."  What does it all mean?

       20 Questions  This week's 20 Questions comes from  urlLink Mark Sarvas  of  urlLink The Elegant Variation  litblog.  He likes Scotchguard, apparently.  Why do you blog?  As an outlet for crippling insecurity and acute loneliness.  It's also an excuse to keep me from my real writing.  Oh, I also do like books.   What are your favourite blogs?  Why, Joe Bloggs, of course.  (Did I mention I'm also an incorrigible ass-kisser?)  The blogs that manage to pierce  the clouds of narcissism that surround me are listed in my blogroll, and I'll probably hurt all sorts of feelings if I leave people out here.  But daily must-reads include the following:  urlLink Maud Newton , sine qua non of literary blogs.  (TEV has been my poor attempts at a Maud impersonation, and if I could only visit one site, it would be hers.);  Sarah Weinman's excellent  urlLink Confessions of an Idiosyncratic Mind , focusing on crime fiction with energy and style; Dan Green's thought-provoking  urlLink The Reading Experience  has been a literary education for me.  Ron Hogan's  urlLink Beatrice  is always thoughtful and - together with my great friend Ed Champion of fantastically exuberant  urlLink Return of the Reluctant  keep the evil Book Babes in check.  I'm also a daily reader of  urlLink Moorishgirl , who is doing excellent things with her site particularly in terms of reviews.  Sam Jones'  urlLink Golden Rule Jones  is also a daily stop.  And then there are the indispensable  urlLink Old Hag  and the mighty  urlLink TMFTML , without whom I'd have precious little to laugh about, and who make me feel better about my own drinking habits.   What are you reading at the moment?  I'm finishing up  Mortification , a collection of Embarrassing Writer Stories, which I'll be reviewing at TEV.  I'm also reading Percival Everett's  American Desert , also for review on my site.  I'm working my way through Donald Barthelme's  60 Stories .  And I'm working through William H.Gass' collection of essays,  Fiction and the Figures of Life.  What is the best book you've ever read?  I don't think I can answer this.  I suppose it defends on your definition of the best written?  The best constructed?  Or the one that made me feel best?  Anyway, I'm terrified of commitment.  But since I can't seem to go a week without plugging him in some fashion, I'll answer "Every book by John Banville."   I'm particularly partial to  Athena  and  Eclipse.  What is your favourite poem?  It's probably  urlLink 'The Layers'  by former poet laureate Stanley Kunitz, which contains this wonderfully sad line that I use to open my novel-in-progress:  "How shall the heart be reconciled/to its feast of losses?"   Who is your favourite musician(s)?  Bill Evans' piano playing is one of the few things that might almost convince me there's a God.     What is your favourite quote?  I've never been able to sort out the attribution for this one, but it so perfectly sums up my own uneasy relationship to my work:  "I like having written."   How did you vote in the last election?  Gore, of course.  Sent him money, too.  And "I've ranted about this before" I've never forgiven Nader and his followers for having so naively perpetuated this grand lie that there's no difference between Republicans and Democrats.  That one's come home to roost, sadly.   What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  George W. Bush.  And this is not hyperbole.  We're standing on the brink of a dark ages in this country, and the choice probably hasn't been as stark since 1860 when Lincoln ran against Douglas.  His administration is riddled with evil all the way to the core, and, as a committed internationalist, I despair for America's future and its place in the world.     What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  I used to drink at this Los Angeles bar called the Cat and the Fiddle with my dear friend Eric, and after he'd listen patiently to my complaining and whining and moaning about the various difficulties and injustices of the writing life, he'd give me an unimpressed look and say, "Shut up and write." Shut up and write.  Words I live by, to this day.   When do you view it permissible to lie?  When my agent wants to know how far along the rewrite I've gotten.  It's not like he doesn't know.   If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My laptop and my 1963 Hofner Beatle bass.  It's the violin shaped bass guitar the Paul McCartney played with the Beatles, and I've had one since my Beatle band days in college.   Define pleasure.   Being in Paris with my wife.  I go there every year.  There's a cafe on Place Saint Sulpice with rows of chairs out front, and I've probably spent some of my happiest moments right there.   Define pain.  These days, it's reading the newspaper.  The helplessness in the face of truly disastrous times.   What animal would you most like to be?  No idea.  I don't think being an animal has much to recommend itself for.  Let's say a housefly, they only have a lifespan of a few weeks, right?  Might as well get it over quickly.   What has been your best blogging experience?  It's probably a toss-up between the first time Maud Newton linked to a piece of mine  I couldn't believe anyone was actually reading  and my recent interview with Andrew Sean Greer, which was an example of new doors that are opening thanks to the blog.   What has been your worst blogging experience?  Only getting 36 signatures on  urlLink my petition  to dump the Book Babes.   Who are your heroes (in any field)?  I'm suspicious of heroes - I find that sort of adulation slightly dangerous.  But the closest I come would be my previously mentioned friend Eric (of "Shut up and write.").  He was a child actor whose career ran out of steam, and rather than give in to L.A. despair when the phone stopped ringing, he had both second and third acts.  He went back to school as an adult, graduated Berkeley with honors, taught English in Japan, then came home to work for the good guys on Capitol Hill.  Then he moved into the non-profit world, where he's been working directly to help people improve their lives.     Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  Until Eddie Izzard came along it would have been John Cleese.  But Izzard is brilliant, magnificent, unlike anyone I've ever seen.   What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  A big, fat sale for my book.  Of course, that probably means I have to finish it, first.

       Recent Britflick in 'not bad' shock!  I went to see the  urlLink Football Factory  at the weekend.  Don't get me wrong, I don't 'do' football but I think John King (who wrote the book of the film back in the 90s) is as good a writer as  urlLink Irvine Welsh  when it comes to documenting inner city life in Britain.  It's worth saying from the outset that the film could have been a lot worse -- we're hardly known for making convincing criminality films of late.  Thankfully, it being made in 2004 rather than 1994, it seems you can do more with low budgets these days and while the soundtrack is ever-present, it tends to veer towards the Libertines and  urlLink Primal Scream  end of the spectrum (with two recent Scream tracks for comfort on there).  Fading out with 'Going Underground' by The Jam was somewhat predictable and while there's one or two well-worn cliches in there, on the whole it's a surprisingly well-made film (yes, I did go to the cinema expecting to be disappointed, but what can you do?).  One thing though -- I used to live above a pub frequented by Millwall thugs and I can honestly say that the ones depicted in the film were effeminate PhD candidates compared to the ones I met.  Apparently Mark Perryman, author of  urlLink  The Ingerland Factor   and founder of  urlLink philosophyfootball.com , is going to review the film for  3AM .

       Joy Zipper + 10 000 Things, ULU 14/5/04  On Friday, an email pops in the in-box kindly inviting me to go and see 10 000 Things, who are supporting  urlLink Joy Zipper .  I was planning on attending the  urlLink Angular  event but a trip to ULU (round the corner) is preferable to braving early morning transport home from Brixton.  An opportunity to shoegaze should never be passed up either.  I was surprised to see  urlLink Matt Thorne  in the crowd -- so even novelists do gigs, I now know.  10 000 Things, as suggests their support act status, are first on and proceed to plunge into a set of grungey Oasis-esque numbers, a kind of Gallagher brothers after a few Thee Hypnotics albums and a bottle of Jack Daniels each.  As well as sounding like 10 000 Maniacs in name, 10 000 Things have the misfortune to suffer from Ordinary Boys Syndrome visually (ie. each band member looks as if they should be in another band).  But frontman Sam Riley has more front than Southend and strikes up an instant rapport with the audience between songs in the manner of a stand-up comedian, displaying his Leeds origins with a gruff Northern accent.  Lyrically-speaking, the songs ('Dogsbody'?) won't be winning any Ivor Novello Awards, dealing as they do with everyday topics of little gravitas such as work, fidelity and alcoholism.  It never did Oasis any harm commercially but some might be a little distracted from their brand of straight, down the line rock n'roll by this.  If dirty and raucous does it for you then 10 000 Things should work a treat.  Unfortunately, mesmerising and wistful does it for me -- so I am more than content with the performance of Joy Zipper.  Wrongly described in pre-gig publicity as Beach Boys-esque, Joy Zipper owe a clear debt to My Bloody Valentine (they're produced by Kevin Shields) and come across as a contemporary take on the Mazzy Star franchise.  Their second album's title,  American Whip , evokes memories of Veruca Salt's  American Thighs  -- but hopefully they'll have more staying power than them.   American Whip  is a  Loveless  for Generation Y and the duo of Tabitha Tindale and Vincent Carfiso more than cut it live to boot, breathing new life in to the previously assumed decaying corpse of shoegazing.  I can't recall a gig I've ever felt so affected by what's going on on-stage.  Perfect.

       Dude,  you're  confused?   urlLink Mark Sarvas  over at  urlLink The Elegant Variation  blog wonders what exactly is being judged in the  3AM  Good Sex Prize --  urlLink the judges or actual fiction ? For his benefit, I'll reiterate the shortlist, as I confess, it was a wee while between announcing the shortlist and the judges and anyone not paying attention could get confused:  Frederic Beigbeder,  £6.99 , Picador, July 2003 Stewart Home,  Down and Out in Shoreditch and Hoxton , The Do-Not-Press, February 2004  Michel Houellebecq,  Lanzarote , Heinemann, July 2003 Mounsi,  The Demented Dance , Black Amber, July 2003 Ben Myers,  The Book of Fuck , Wrecking Ball Press, February 2004  Adam Thirlwell,  Politics , Jonathan Cape, August 2003  Helen Walsh, Brass,  Canongate , March 2004  Tony White,  Foxy-T , Faber and Faber, July 2003  OK, it's a bit of an EU-centric affair as there's no US novels to speak of in the list, primarily because no one nominated any.  There's always the 2005 prize for that I guess, if any US authors write any that is (tip: write one now and it might win).  However, my post of the other day on the list of judges, although now amended, was not strictly true as I omitted both  urlLink Toby Litt  and  urlLink Andrei Codrescu , primarily because I didn't know  urlLink Andrew Gallix  had approached them to be judges and the first I knew of it was when they voted (having done so before most of the announced judges).  As such, two authors are now level-pegging in the lead, though obviously I can't say who they are.  So, to recap on that front, here are the judges in full:  - Steve Almond - Andrei Codrescu - Jessa Crispin of  Bookslut  - Richard Hell - Tom Hodgkinson of  The Idler  - Toby Litt - DBC Pierre - Neal Pollack - Jude Rodgers of  Smoke  - Scarlett Thomas - Matt Thorne - Peter Wild of  Bookmunch   Whether that list is for my or your benefit remains to be seen.

       Mourning Morgan   3AM  would like to apologise for their premature gloating at Piers Morgan's hastened departure from the  Daily Mirror  last Friday.  We understand that Morgan was escorted from the  Mirror 's plush Canary Wharf offices by security an this is not a fate we would wish on anyone.  The blog entry in question was ghost-written by a  3AM  intern who has now had their placement terminated and is understood to be making their way back to the state college from which they hailed, whereupon their exploits will be turned into a teen sex-romp starring Seann William Scott and/or Tara Reid.  Our heartfelt apology has nothing to do with the fact that Piers Morgan is claiming a £1m pay-off from the Mirror Group.  Nope, not at all.  Nor the fact that the Editor of their  3am Magazine , Phil Hall, is tipped to replace Morgan in the Editor's chair.  "3am Editor tipped to become next Mirror chief" -- I like that.  For wide-ranging discussion of the fall-out following the  Mirror 's recent personnel changes, read  urlLink Fleet Street Blogger  or the  urlLink London News Review's media blog .  Our lips are sealed on the matter.

       Wanna work for us, Piers?  A few months back,  3AM  embarked on a valiant struggle against the   urlLink Daily Mirror   following its decision to publish a  3am Magazine  based on the franchise afforded by their popular  urlLink 3am Girls  gossip column.  The plan was that this magazine would, using the award-winning 3am Girls formula, resuscitate the  Mirror 's ailing fortunes.  We were already encountering problems with some people in the media confusing  us  ( urlLink 3AM Magazine ) with  them  (3am Girls) and a magazine under the name of 3am Magazine would only exacerbate matters further.  Editor Piers Morgan (known affectionately to  Private Eye  as 'Piers Moron' on a regular basis) had invested a lot of personal credibility in  3am Magazine 's ability to revive the failing tabloid however and the project had his unwavering support.  Our valiant struggle failed, amid a morass of lawyers' letters and our profound inability to match their financial might -- but so did their plan to save the  Mirror  using Jordan and make-up tips.  A few months on and their much-vaunted publication is as well-received as a Thanksgiving Turkey in Iraq -- which pretty much mirrors (no pun intended) the launch night for the publication held in London's hideous Leicester Square (soon to be home of MTV, apparently), which featured more z-celebs than a night out with  urlLink Dean Gaffney .  To compound their misery further (much further, in fact) calls are being made for  urlLink Piers Morgan's resignation , from the floor of Parliament through to other echelons of Fleet Street, following the revelation that the  Mirror 's pictures of  British  squaddies torturing Iraqi detainees were faked.  Morgan's schtick as editor of a British tabloid (not the most credible of avenues in journalism) has been to claim a mission to revive the paper's populist left remit and to badge himself as a media commentator and standard bearer of ethical conduct.  So it remains to be seen whose shelf-life will come to an end soonest -- the Mirror's  3am Magazine  or Piers Morgan's tenure in the editor's chair there.  Never mind Piers, you could always come and work for us if you turn up to Canary Wharf and find you're no longer wanted there.

       Love on the East London Line  I was surprised to read a  urlLink more than laudatory analysis of the 'New Cross scene'  (if you can call it that) in this week's   urlLink NME   (see Richard Cabut's review of the Angular Night last month  urlLink here ).  Surprised in a kind of 'they're waxing lyrical about places I go and people I know' kinda way.  It was always bound to be thus -- I lived in the area for most of the time I've been in London, did a Masters at Goldsmiths College, worked as a press officer at Lewisham Council and still live on the East London Line.    The article portrays the  urlLink Paradise Bar  on New Cross Road as some kind of latter-day  urlLink Good Mixer  or a  urlLink Rhythm Factory  south of the river.  Until the 'Pop Of The Tops' night mentioned in the article, I'd always given the Paradise Bar a wide berth -- aside from a few good drum and bass nights there in the 1990s, it was a venue that was more synonymous with violence for me (a uni friend got a good pasting over nothing by a bunch of estate kids there a few years back).  The area may have Goldsmiths College to call its own, but most of the students who attend there tend to frequent where they live, which isn't always New Cross, though I have amusing memories of moody goth parties on Lewisham Way that remain with me to this day.    You can count the decent pubs in New Cross on one hand -- Camden it aint my friend, despite what they might say.  Two of the best bars -- Goldsmiths Tavern (some legendary ska nights in there, a graffiti-strewn punk dive of note) and the Mulberry Tree -- did not survive their recent re-fits intact.  The Amersham Arms does some good  urlLink live nights  but don't draw too much attention to yourself in the front bar as the regulars can get a bit lively themselves.  The Marquis of Granby is good for a pint and a natter but the Walpole Arms over the road has degenerated into a refuge for estate kids who want to quaff alcopops and listen to Britney or Justin.  The Hobgoblin opposite New Cross Gate station is probably your best bet for a pint and a go on the jukebox and seems to be the most student-centric boozer in the area if you fancy a trip on the East London Line to try and pull a future Damien Hirst or Sarah Lucas.  The chaotic array of  urlLink shops  around the college are also worth checking out during the daytime.  Where the article is spot-on is in the dedication of both the people behind  urlLink Angular Recordings  and the  urlLink Rocklands Tourist Board , who have flogged their guts out mercilessly over the past few years to make this happen, with  urlLink the local council  only sitting up and taking notice since articles like that of the  NME  began to appear.  Possibly because the Socialist Party and the Greens have begun winning seats on the council there.  You can check out our East London Line blog  urlLink here  and the Rocklands blog  urlLink here  to find out more.  You can also  urlLink watch the video  to  urlLink Art Brut 's now seminal 'Formed a Band' or  urlLink listen to  Bloc Party's 'She's Hearing Voices'.

       Young author scoops literary accolade before single word written   3AM exclusive  A YOUNG writer was the toast of Fleet Street today when he was included on a respected list of promising authors before he'd even written a single book.  Jake Purbright was a surprise inclusion on the  Charlie  Young British Authors list as it is known that he hasn't even written a book yet.  "This has quite taken me by surprise," said Purbright, 26, from his fashionable home in a multicultural district of North London yesterday.  "There I was just bumming around in Hoxton and the next thing I'm hanging out with Martin Amis and Dave Eggers.  It's great!"  Mr Purbright, a media studies graduate, was thought to have been signed to a six figure publishing deal with Penguin following a lunch at his girlfriend's parents house last year.  "I was a bit depressed, I mean I'm no good at art and I don't think I could handle the workload of being in a band.  So I was just hanging around gallery openings and attending gigs on the guest lists of bands I know but I couldn't actually point to anything I did creative-wise.  Being a writer sounded fun, and easy."  One of Purbright's biggest advocates is the well-known writer Zadie Smith, who met him at a party organised by lastminute.com founder Martha Lane Fox last year.  "I think Jake's writing will have great energy and rawness," said Smith on hearing of the accolade.  Purbright brushed aside criticisms of his inclusion, arguing that he does intend to write a book in the not too distant future.  "I do have a laptop, you know.  It's still in the box but I will get round to writing something very soon."  William Hill shortened the odds of Purbright winning next year's Booker Prize today.  Dave Eggers and Nick Hornby were not available for comment.

        Panache   Mick Mercer has been writing about music for 30-odd –- very odd –- years. Starting in 1976 with his fanzine  Panache , he’s worked for practically every pop rag going, including  Melody Maker ,  NME  and  Zig Zag , which he also edited. Most of us gave up, got proper jobs and had kids a long time ago. Not Mick. Since the demise of the printed music press, he’s being bashing out his strangely crazy thoughts on  urlLink www.mickmercer.com , which includes a free PDF mag called  The Mick . And now he’s even resurrected  Panache  in the form of a CD Rom –- an illustrated version of his provocative, pent-up live journal. Of two other CDs on sale,  3AM  types will probably find the  Punk History Vol 1  to their taste. This features interviews with a couple of early members of Adam and the Ants, the Adverts, the Damned and more. There’s also a big bunch of punk photos taken by the man himself –- the Ants at the Marquee (1978), Blondie (1978), Damned at the Roundhouse (1977) etc. The CDs go for about a tenner, with details on the aforementioned site. Needless to say, it’s all pogo-tastic stuff.

       Is Britain shit?  Went to see  urlLink Selfish Cunt  at the  urlLink London School of Economics  last night.  Support was provided by Prey and the always entertaining  urlLink Pink Grease , and I was accompanied by  urlLink Marco  and  urlLink Zan .  First reflection should be on the bar prices there -- £1.90 for a pint of Stella, which is surprising in a city where I generally expect to come away with little change from £3 at the bar.  Made mental note to return.  Some of  urlLink the crowd  were somewhat unusual, from emaciated types with quiffs to pot-bellied goths letting it all hang out.  The girl selling the merchandise, a peroxided waif, was doing likewise, insisting on flashing her bikini top to us from under her fake fur coat and even letting some customers grope her.  Marco bought a couple of singles, I noticed.  Geek chic was the order of the evening.  Pre-gig band tapes are always interesting to me -- 'This Town Aint Big Enough For The Both Of Us' by Sparks nestled next to 'Top of the Pops' by The Rezillos.  Prey specialised in fraught r n' b workouts -- no vocals.  The sound was very much Cramps meets Neu! with a heavy emphasis on the surf drums.  A good live performance but not sure how well it'd translate onto vinyl.  Pink Grease remained true to garish form, with much in the way of camp in a kind of non-ironic Electric 6 way.  Once again, The Cramps were instantly recalled.  While the band had much in the way of theatrics to rely upon, the distinct lack of a back catalogue ensured the set was relatively short.   "We're your fantasy band, assholes!"  yelped the lead guitarist, replete with whiteboy afro and goggles.  It was an incendiary display, capped off with the sound cutting out as the inter-band tape came back on, 'Freak Scene' by Dinosaur Jr perplexing a few people around us.  Once Selfish Cunt mount the stage not long after this, confusion reigns supreme.  Coming across as a contemporary take on Suicide, the assault on the senses is deafening and baffling.  Singer Martin, no stranger to camp theatrics himself, begins with back turned to the audience, before writhing around to the strains of guitar that is abrasive yet sometimes New Wave-styled.  The presence is almost messianic to some extent and the ethos entirely confrontational.  I am loathe to participate in the process of heaping hype on an already over-hyped act, but Selfish Cunt's neo-manifesto of applying shock treatment to fundamental tenets of the British psyche (cf. their  urlLink 'Britain is Shit'  single) and attempting to represent an affront to moral decency are just what the pop charts require after what seems like centuries of turgid indie rock.  It's almost as if Throbbing Gristle never went away.  In truth though, the night belonged to Pink Grease.  We may have been stood in the same place that the London crowd of 1968 held college authorities to ransom in the name of Vietnam, but the revolution is now sexual as the ghosts of Roxy Music fornicate openly and flirt with your affections.

       Quiet days in cliché  Another  3AM  person to take advantage of the nu-style  urlLink blogger.com  is Chief Editor  urlLink Andrew Gallix , our  homme à Paris  and 'piss artist extraordinaire'.  He will be using  urlLink gallix.com  to archive his published work on the net, he tells me.  You can view mine and Andrew's fotologs  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  respectively.  Which is handy, given that the blogroll disappeared when I overhauled it today...

       20 Questions  Today's 15 megabytes of fame outside of their own weblog comes from the pseudonymous Inspector Sands of the  urlLink Casino Avenue  blog, which focuses on the life of a journalist and Charlton FC fan resident in, erm, Charlton of all places:  Why do you blog?  Because it seemed like a good idea at the time. Now I like it because it's a good way of bringing like-minded types together, as well as putting a few issues in the spotlight which would otherwise be missed.   What are your favourite blogs?  Loads, none of them American, not all listed here.  urlLink Diamond Geezer , a wised-up take on capital life which avoids the naiveity of other blogs and most of the media, but never loses its enthusiasm for London.  urlLink Onionbagblog , which is savage and witty, but never too cynical.  urlLink Pixeldiva  does great things with pictures, while  urlLink Bandhag  and  urlLink Smacked Face  ooze a lust for life.  urlLink Green Fairy  still makes me laugh out loud from time to time, while  urlLink Creepy Lesbo  still sounds like someone I want to go drinking with, after a year of reading her.  urlLink iCandy ,  urlLink The Highrise  and  urlLink Not You, The Other One  do fine work for Manchester, Edinburgh and Newcastle - I discover most of my blogs through  urlLink London Bloggers , so I don't read enough from other parts of the world.    What are you reading at the moment?  'Be My Enemy' by Christopher Brookmyre. I'm not reading enough at the moment, largely because my coats and jackets have pockets which are too small...   What is the best book you've ever read?  'Animal Farm' and '1984' by George Orwell.    What is your favourite poem?  I cannot for the life of me fathom out why anyone should get worked up about poetry.   Who is your favourite musician(s)?  I am loving the Franz Ferdinand album right now, while I'd walk over hot coals for Ladytron, Tindersticks, the Delgados and Spearmint.   What is your favourite quote?  That Oscar Wilde one about lying in the gutter and looking at the stars.   How did you vote in the last election?  Green. Not sure what I'll do this time.   What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  Religious fundamentalism.   What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  Shut up and listen.   When do you view it permissible to lie?  To protect someone else.   If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My Charlton season ticket and my digital radio.    Define pleasure.  The third pint of Guinness, preferably following a sixth Charlton victory on the trot.   Define pain.  Waiting for something that never comes.   What animal would you most like to be?  A pub dog.   What has been your best blogging experience?  Sparking a debate, or getting appreciative comments from people.   What has been your worst blogging experience?  Being screwed over by the awful Enetation commenting system, and discovering there are people who take this all too seriously. And discovering the whining horrors on the Blorgy ratings page - a reminder that once you've found a good blog, cherish it and the person who writes it.   Who are your heroes (in any field)?  Ken Livingstone (until he rejoined the Labour party), Steve Lamacq, Dean Kiely.   Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  The Mary Whitehouse Experience changed my life, even if David Baddiel later became a complete knobber.   What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  A cheque for one hundred trillion pounds. Or the reinstatement of the fast M1 bus between Charlton and North Greenwich stations.

       Remake/Remodel  This blog, like 99.9% of the others that clog up cyberspace, is maintained using  urlLink Blogger .  For as far back as I would care to remember, this (free) service has had a level of originality, diversity and panache usually more associated with cars of the former Eastern Bloc or those produced by nationalised manufacturers in the decadent West (remember the Austin Allegro?).  But as far as loss-making concerns like  3AM  are concerned, Blogger offers us a cost-effective means of communicating with our readers using stuff we wouldn't normally put on the site and on a more regular basis.  As such, I was not surprised to log on this morning to discover that Blogger's recent revamp and sprucing-up of service provision has provided something of a 'Hot Topic' (a la Le Tigre) on  urlLink many blogs  today.  So welcome to the new look, more contemporary Joe Bloggs.  All I can say is about time, though it's a bit fiddly, like.  And we've lost the blogroll and the comments function doesn't work.  Teething trouble, I guess.

The reformed (surviving)  urlLink New York Dolls  brought together by  urlLink the Mozfather  (to borrow the  NME 's  urlLink newfound enthusiastic name  for Morrissey).   urlLink New York also comes to London  via the art world in today's  Guardian  piece on the new gallery of Larry Gagosian to be opened in the seedy Kings Cross district.

       A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Blogger  I shall depart, to do whatever it is I do at weekends, leaving you with Stella Vine's (who's definitely  not  a  urlLink Stuckist  anymore, by the way)  urlLink blog  for company.  Over at  Idealog , there's an  urlLink interview with  3AM 's Richard Marshall  about, erm,  urlLink 3AM Magazine .  I think we get more than 7000 hits a day though (circa 30 000 unique users, to be precise).  The other day I found the bizarrest and most hyperbolic description of us ever (to have not been written by myself) over at the otherwise quite good  urlLink Kultureflash :   "One may have lost oneself in London and still not heard of The Horse Hospital, 3am Magazine, or Richard Strange. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take a chance on the cosmic conjunction of all three this Saturday. Indeed the line-up is almost supernatural in it's assortment of high-cool low-recognition avant-gardeness. It should be a blazing array of pop-punk poetry and literary swagger. Basically the unrepentantly midcult e-journal, 3am magazine is having a party. Standing on their chairs and letting it all hang loose for the party people will be such luminaries as arch YBA-apologist Matthew Collings, Billy Childish -- king of his own little world, Vic Godard still doing Punk like it never went out, came back and went out of style again, Bertie Marshall psycho-lit boy, the aforementioned Richard Strange, the sexy Mitzi Szereto and, jeez, about ten other spokesman for counter-culture. Jessica Callan tragically won't be there (3am launched two years before the Mirror girls were ever a twinkle in Piers Morgan's eye) but don't let that hold you back. It'll be different, that much is certain. And hey, think how less lost you'll be."    I haven't felt so proud since I discovered we were on the Links page of the  urlLink Cheech and Chong  website.

       "lower than vermin"  To seasoned viewers of BBC's  urlLink 'Have I Got News For You' , his bumbling toff persona (a clever front, some argue) is all too well-known.  But  urlLink  Spectator   editor and the Hon. Member for Henley (Con),  urlLink Boris Johnson , has been appointed Shadow Minister for the Arts and has already generated  urlLink enough publicity  to preserve his cuddly image.  True to dim toff form, Johnson made some rash pronouncements on what the arts would look like under the Tories, including a Stalinist-sounding Six Point Plan to save our cultural heritage.  Point Four was interesting:   "Fourth? I can't remember what point four is. Ah, yes. We are going to convene a summit with Damien Hirst and the rest of the gang at which they are going to explain to the nation what it all means. Let us have a national 'mission to explain' by the Saatchi mob, which will be massively popular.

       20 Questions  An intended regular feature on here will be Q+A's with other bloggers, a regular feature hopefully remaining in place (unlike Indie Obscura Day).  The first interview subject is Jessa Crispin, AKA the  urlLink Bookslut :  Why do you blog?  Blogging fulfills both my ADD-like tendencies and the huge amounts of time I have on my hands.   What are your favourite blogs?  I actually only read a handful of blogs.  urlLink Neil Gaiman 's,  urlLink Poundy.com ,  Spike Magazine 's  urlLink blog , and then the blogs of the people I know and love.   What are you reading at the moment? You Have to Be Careful in the Land of the Free  by James Kelman;  Louis Reil  by Chester Brown; and  Underground  by Haruki Murakami.   What is the best book you've ever read?  I don't think I can answer that.  Dubliners  by James Joyce maybe. Or  Of Human Bondage  perhaps. I don't know, that's too difficult.   What is your favourite poem?  As is that. I really like Austin Clarke, so perhaps one of his.   Who is your favourite musician(s)?  Bono is quite possibly the Messiah.   What is your favourite quote?  There's a long passage in  The Ground Beneath Her Feet  by Salman Rushdie that ends with "We Soar. We Fly. We Flee." That might be it.   How did you vote in the last election?  I voted for Nader. Mostly because I was living in Texas, and voting for Gore really was throwing my vote away.   What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  President Bush, Karl Rove, and Dick Cheney.   What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  As I was freaking out on the phone to my father, crying and bitching, he just sighed and said, "Jes, some days are going to be like this. And some days are going to be worse." It helped more than you would think.   When do you view it permissible to lie?  Whenever it makes you look good.   If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My cats. I don't really own anything of value, other than my books, and I would probably die of smoke inhalation trying to get them out.   Define pleasure.   Reading comics on the couch on Sunday afternoons, drinking tea and smelling the dessert I made for Sunday dinners cooling on the counter.   Define pain.   That time I nearly took my finger off with a boning knife. I still have a scar.   What animal would you most like to be?  I'm quite fond of being a human. I wouldn't get to have so many books and so much cheese if I weren't human.   What has been your best blogging experience?  The day Neil Gaiman e-mailed me the first time.   What has been your worst blogging experience?  I don't know. None of the bad stuff really matters.   Who are your heroes (in any field)?  Salman Rushdie in the grace under pressure category. My own father in the being successful in everything he tries to do category. Mike Wallace in the being a delightful bastard category. Dottie Curry in the being a badass category.   Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  Right now I'm obsessed with Eddie Izzard.   What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  Perhaps finding a job. That might be nice. Barring that, a nice windfall of some sort. I should find something I can sue the city about.

       On Becoming A Cult Literatus  People often say to me,  "Andrew, how do I become a writer?" .   "Well,"  I tell them,  "It's a bit like this..." :   TEN POINT PLAN TO ACHIEVE CULT AUTHOR STATUS  1. Become famous before the book-buying public have read a single word Your arrival on the literary scene requires a fanfare.  Stories about "telephone number advances" and being "the find of the London Book Fair" will help here.  Even better if you can get on the  Granta  Young British Writers list before a single copy hits Borders.  2. Your past is more important than your present A few minor indiscretions in your youth? Bring them on, it all adds to the mystique/branding.  3. You have to look good on a dust jacket Who cares if you've written the next  Ulysees ? Unless your face shifts units then the marketing department won't want to know.  Men may seldom make passes at girls in glasses and the book-buying public would prefer you pouting/chiselled too.  4. Tick boxes shamelessly It's not just about narrative anymore honey, you need metanarrative and allegory too.  Multiculturalism or probing notions of national identity help.  Otherwise just stick to sex and/or drugs.  5. Write with film-optioning in mind What could be better than being "the book of the film" in terms of boosting your career? Even better if you're on hand to write the screenplay.  6. Champion fashionable causes Being  cause celebre  is not an end in itself, you need to have opinions on everything -- from fishpaste to politics.  Don't worry about developing any form of theory, a soundbite will do.  If there's a war on, then oppose it.  Party politics is a little more tricky, as a first resort be against the government of the day, but it generally doesn't do any harm to be on hand for governmental soirees.  7. Write a disappointing follow-up to your debut You could write the literary equivalent of Lou Reed's  Metal Machine Music , if the marketing power is there then people will buy it based on your debut.  You can then "return to form" for the critics with the third.  8. Be in a milieu You need a scene to be associated with, other authors to refer to you in interviews and by association.  Don't worry if they're not very good.  9. Develop another string to your bow You're into music as well? Really? Do you fancy a spot of rock biography or commentary to broaden your scope as a literary figurehead?   10. Make sure your agent submits you for as many literary prizes as possible The actual financial awards given by these things will be pin money to you, but the assistance in shifting units is immeasurable, even if you're only on the shortlist.  Tongues will wag if you fail to get that far.

       Neils Children   urlLink Neils Children  are a brash, young threesome from the Home Counties and are attracting favourable write-ups in all manner of media outlets, from the conventional music press through to style mags.  The  NME  referred to them as  "druggy, extreme-Dickensian tinkers"  recently, so  3AM  felt obliged to sink a few pints in their company on the eve of the London date of their first UK-wide tour:  3AM: You’ve received a lot of attention in the press of late but some readers might not know much about you, where are you from?  NC: We met at college in Harlow when two of us discovered we were actually from the same place, Cheshunt in Hertfordshire and had the same interests.    3AM: What did you study at college?  NC: Music.  3AM: You’ve been tagged as one of these bands that are emerging from East London, is this a fair reflection on your sound?  NC: Not at all, it’s just lazy journalism.  I don’t really know of any bands from East London, apart from Bloc Party who I’ve a lot of time for.  That whole Shoreditch thing is over-rated, it’s just a good place to drink and watch bands, there’s a lot of venues but I’d be surprised if any of the bands playing in them were actually from there.  It’s just a fashion tag, that’s all.  3AM: How important is visual presence for you?  NC: Fairly important.  We make our own clothes, the visual presence is part of who were are as a band, no band can ever escape that.  I’d like to think we had some artistic flair in what we do.  Music is an art, it’s a form of intelligence, we are artists in that regard.  It’s not some wanky art school thing, pretentious bollocks or anything like that.  But we do have an art edge.  3AM: Do you get out of London much then?  NC: This is our first tour outside of London really, apart from a few European dates.  We’ve been coast to coast and we’re exhausted now so we’re just looking forward to things calming down after tonight.  It’s been a strain on my voice and the record label are worried I won’t be right for this evening and tonight’s important as it’s the London date.  3AM: On one of your German dates, you played ‘God Save The Queen’ while on a riverboat going down the Rhine.  Do you have a political edge or was it just referencing to the punk era?  NC: It was a joke, not a serious gesture at all.  We were on a boat going down the Rhine on Jubilee Day and we thought ‘Why not?’ It was just to give the German audience a treat, I don’t know if they got it or not.  It’s just a bit of front, a laugh that seemed right at the time.    3AM: I can’t help but notice one of you is wearing a Ken Livingstone badge, are you sure you don’t have a political edge at all?  NC: He just likes badges! We just play music, I don’t know enough about politics to claim any sort of ‘edge’ really.  It’s not something that’s ever appealed to us.  I’m 21 and I’ve been able to vote for three years and no one’s ever sent me an invitation to vote so that’s how much they value my opinion.  3AM: Where do you musical reference points come from then? Punk, obviously.  NC: The freakbeat era holds a lot for me, I’m big on that, it does something for all of us I’d say.    3AM: The Creation and The Action, that sort of thing?  NC: Completely.  Those bands were something of a turning point, an exciting time for music, before then it was just bands playing beat music but then they began to experiment.  I like psychedelia, not that West Coast rubbish but the more darker British stuff.  Again that was a turning point, early Pink Floyd and the bands associated with their sound.  The Pop Art sound I’d say.  3AM: What about later stuff?  NC: Post-punk, basically.  Other than freakbeat we’re mainly influenced by the post-punk sound, aesthetic and ethos, in fact we’re obsessed with it.    3AM: Which bands in particular?  NC: Public Image Limited, Gang of Four, The Slits, Delta 5, The Buzzcocks, that’s our main sound.  3AM: In what other ways are you ‘post-punk’?  NC: We’re angular, it comes across in our music and the way we dress.  The ‘punk’ era was defined by random splodginess, but post-punk had more going for it and took account of other things that were going on at the time, dub reggae and the like.  Our freakbeat side is tempered by an adherence to a post-punk ethos, but at the same time they’re very similar for us.  It’s just 'smart punk' rather than the pointless random side of punk that never really held much appeal for us.  3AM: Don’t you think a lot of bands are going about referring to themselves as ‘post-punk’ these days, though? What makes you different to those bands and other noisy guitar bands that are vying for attention at the moment?  NC: Well we’re not like The Libertines or The Strokes, so that’s a good start.  We have a unique sound and I don’t think I’m over-stated in saying that as we draw on such a myriad of influences and reference points.  Those bands that we draw on heavily, the freakbeat and darker psychedelic bands don’t sound like anything that’s around today so as such neither do we.  3AM: What about the rawer punk sound, The Pistols and The Clash?  NC: Obviously that Pistols album was revolutionary for its time but everything that followed, fucking off to Brazil and performing with Ronnie Biggs, that was an absolute joke, wasn’t it? A bit ridiculous really.  I think I have The Clash’s first two albums but even then, they’re too straightforward rock and roll.  That’s why post-punk is so appealing, you didn’t have to sound like a cardboard cut-out punk band to fit in.  It was just about the music but you could take in stuff like dub and psychedelia without worrying about anyone being down on you.  It had a punk edge but there was something else to it.  That whole 1977 stuff just sounds dated now.  3AM: Do you have any literary influences? I don’t just mean in terms of your musical output but in everyday life?  NC: I don’t really read fiction, I can only point to two books that have had a profound influence on me personally --  1984  and  A Clockwork Orange .  I’m not grabbed by other stuff but I’d say we’re an Orwellian band.   3AM: Well, we’re as much a literary website as a music one but I think the two are not mutually-exclusive.  NC: Don’t get me wrong, I think websites are essential to furthering our cause.  From the websites we’ve spoken to on tour, I’ve gleaned that they actually want to speak to us and are more passionate about music.  The more traditional music press only interview you because they have to and are getting paid for it.  There’s something more punk and original about what you guys are doing.  3AM: Your new single is called ‘I Hate Models’, care to explain?  NC: It’s not a major statement, as such.  I mean, I don’t know any models personally or anything.  It was just a symbol of our frustration at the way things are going, that whole Shoreditch thing, the pretentious side of the music industry where sound doesn’t matter.  We’re just tilting at wankers... we just want to play guitars.

       Indie Stu  I get dewy-eyed and romantic when it comes to defunct record labels.  I can't stand football in terms of knowing who plays for who or what team scored what on a regular basis, but I am intrigued by local rivalries and club histories.  I think I have a high level of organisational literacy, despite wanting to be good at drama and art at school, I sailed through Business Studies and Politics instead.  Anyhow, here's my favourite sites devoted to defunct indie labels:  - Sarah Records:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  - Creation Records:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  - Ron Johnson:  urlLink here  - Postcard:  urlLink here  - Rocket Girl:  urlLink here

       Little Hitlers  Friday night saw the opening of 'Occupation Theory: an exhibition of new paintings, scupltures, prints and toys by  urlLink Frank Kozik ' at  urlLink The Aquarium Gallery  in Euston (where else?) and various  3AM  sorts were on hand to assist in the quaffing of Asahi lager and talking bollocks in the bookstore below the gallery, among the various Brazilian guerrilla warfare textbooks and sundry comics.  Much amusement was derived from the discovery among the piles of  Zig-Zag 's and  Sniffing Glue 's of a fanzine edited by  3AM 's Richard Cabut back in 1980, main feature: an interview with Bauhaus.  I also laid my hands on a copy of the re-launch issue of  Nude Magazine  (website to be  urlLink here  soon I am told, but it's ostensibly  3AM  in print form) and the confirmation of its continued existence is a good thing indeed.  I've spent a small part of this weekend checking out the myriad of websites it marks for the reader's attention, which include Bill Drummond's new 'project'  urlLink Youwhores.com , a tribute to vehicular oddities  urlLink The Hopeless Transport Archive  and comic artist  urlLink Lorna Miller .

       urlLink       The Missing Links - Gallix  John Carney on the late  urlLink  Robert Quine :  "Robert Quine played guitar in a certain way on a few songs that made me believe in beauty, poetry, and romance. He executed a guitar solo in the middle of a song called 'Blank Generation' that for me defines what music is all about. And I am talking specifically about the version of 'Blank Generation' that appears on that LP which Sire released in 1977. It’s an LP that also features 'Love Comes In Spurts' where Quine’s guitar opens up possibilities that have only barely been realised since by the likes of the The Fall, Subway Sect, Blue Orchids, Pop Group, Josef K and Fire Engines."  Another (yawn!)  urlLink  Shakespeare  controversy.  urlLink  Martin Amis  argues that English football is crap, but praises Rooney:  "When he smashed in his first goal, from that distance, from that angle, it was the way he shaped that stayed with you -- like a gorilla, with fully demonstrative menace. Zidane twists, Henry glides; Rooney thunders. He is neither vicious nor undisciplined, but his is a game of applied violence. The sportsman he most resembles is not another footballer: it is the pre-decadent Mike Tyson".

It seems almost unreal now but for a young guy living in a completely grey world, it was an incredibly liberating experience in many ways and one that translated beautifully for me into rock'n'roll.' It was punk rock that lifted the 16-year-old Jobson out of the gang and on to the stage..."

       20 Questions  Or alternatively, inform me that you're about to graduate from the college I attended.  Today's interviewee is  urlLink Madame Tytania , who implores you all to cultivate your inner whore from her blog.  Why do you blog?  Because I've no problems with being overly self-indulgent.    What are your favourite blogs?  I've only been discovering blogs over the last few months. I'll mention the ones I'm linked to at the moment:     urlLink Rubbishgays  ->  for the fag hag in me    urlLink Pansexual Sodomite  ->  because we understand each other sexually    urlLink Casino Avenue  ->  because it's like having a chat with a mate in the pub    urlLink Love and the City  ->  was cool till he blogged supporting Ukip    urlLink Stella Vine  ->  some artistic angst I believe in    urlLink Belle de Jour  ->  before she became an unemployed hooker    urlLink Gachas at Tiffany's  ->  it's in Spanish, it belongs to a writer friend of mine    urlLink Diamond Geezer  ->  more mates in the pub factor    urlLink Greenfairy  ->  ditto (and she has girlie concerns too)     Plus almost anything with porn in it.   What are you reading at the moment?  Foucault's  History of Sexuality , but only because I must. I like reading fiction, porn and biographies.    What is the best book you've ever read?  In its day, Richard Ellman's biography of Oscar Wilde was a HUGE eye opener; anything by Truman Capote;  The Great Gatsby;  Warhol's  Philosophy from A to B.  Yes, I am a fag hag, I mentioned it earlier.     What is your favourite poem?  I am more into narrative than into poetry. Maybe  The Odyssey  by Homer.    Who is your favourite musician(s)?  Alex James from Blur 10 years ago was, like, LUSH. No, seriously: David Bowie, for the alter ego thingie, definitely changed my life; Malcolm McLaren; Mike Skinner (should have included him in poetry maybe); Roni Size a few years ago, D'n'B was important once; Marc Almond while in Soft Cell: the first boy in black eyeliner I ever saw. Momentous! Dusty Springfield; Bach.        What is your favourite quote?  *there are two types of people in the world: the cats and the dogs* F. Scott Fitzgerald.    How did you vote in the last election?  Relax, I didn't vote UKip ;-)     What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  A universal male fear of buggery.     What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  *It takes exactly the same work and effort to make a crap piece of art than a good one*.     When do you view it permissible to lie?  When the truth would hurt far far more, and a white lie will suffice.     If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  My computer; my video camera; my latex catsuit and single tail whip; my strap-on dildo; moisturising cream and make-up: Ms Tytania's Essential Survival Kit. One or 2 books I can't think of right now, probably novels and biographies. I could live in a desert island with those. Strutting my stuff in a rubber catsuit under the palm trees... Now, that's an image to cherish! :-)))     Define pleasure.  When sex and communication go hand in hand, it can be very pleasurable. Power exchange can be very very good too.     Define pain.  Emotional unfinished business. Bigotry. Death (of close ones).     What animal would you most like to be?  A dog. A Jack Russell.     What has been your best blogging experience?  When I started getting comments from people I've never met.     What has been your worst blogging experience?  None so far, although I once got a comment from somebody who sounded like a religious fundamentalist, and that was a bit unsettling because I had just started my first blog.     Who are your heroes (in any field)?  Andy Warhol; Coco Chanel; dunno, I look up to my closest, oldest, most dearest friends a lot.     Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  Andy Warhol.    What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  Financial stability. Not quantity, just stability.

       Handing the Loaded Revolver to the Enemy  I feel I have been neglecting blogging matters of late, but there's much to organise with our forthcoming lit-pop/art rock collision, as well as trying to fathom out the English weather and avoid the worst excesses of both hayfever and Japanese sake.  I'd like to have blogged on  urlLink Anna Funder's winning of the Samuel Johnson Prize  ( Stasiland  unfairly missed out on the  Guardian 's First Book award, which was taken instead by a book on mountains by some chinless wonder) but I didn't get chance to.  It was in fact well-written, but certainly has something of the  Good Bye! Lenin  effect about it.    I do have time however, to give mentions to the forthcoming exhibition by Billy Childish at The Aquarium Gallery, which is  urlLink a homage to Van Gogh  apparently.  There's also a  urlLink fascinating interview  in yesterday's  Times  with East London artist  urlLink Stella Vine , who is definitely not a Stuckist anymore, apparently.  Normal service should be resumed next week.

        3AM  Good Sex Prize  The judging is over.  The votes are in and have been counted.  So it only seems fair to exclusively announce to the readers of Joe Bloggs that the inaugural  3AM  Good Sex Prize will go to...  Mounsi,  The Demented Dance  (Black Amber)   "When I went too far, disrupting the class with my bravado, Mademoiselle Karina would make me go under her desk to calm down.  What delicious punishment! While she corrected our exercise books, I could make out the soft hair of her golden fleece, satin-smooth, and the three white fleur-de-lis embroidered on her knickers.  I could have spent my entire life between her thighs, which she’d cross and uncross, with a slight rasp of her stockings, trying to get comfortable.  What did I care for comfort? What a way to go, released in the supreme moment between delicate, transparent lingerie, amid the provocative armour of girdles, bras, suspender belts, hoisted like frigates’ sails in to pure, exposed matter.  Deep in the aroma of voluptuous flesh, in among the downy strands of hair, you’d leave as you’d come, craving an infinite caress, a final farewell to sorrow, delicately, in full poetic flight, with a thousand, whispered sweet nothings.  At that age, all you see of love is its rose-tinted aspect.  Just one little controlled, discreet, elegant orgasm.  Under her desk, in the intimacy of her underwear, between her legs, precisely where the elastic of the suspenders garrotted the skin of her thighs, my mind concentrated on her pussy, I breathed into her curls.  Your mind inside someone’s knickers, that’s rare, but it’s amazing.  I was there, I can vouch for it.  I was carried off in a dream.  I inhaled deeply.  My nose reached into the origin of life.  I hallucinated curls of fur.  That was my whole life, right there."   In joint second place was Tony White with  Foxy-T  and Helen Walsh with  Brass .  But Mounsi leapt ahead when the final votes came in.  The prize will be awarded on Saturday 3rd of July at the Stuckist Gallery, Charlotte Road, Shoreditch EC2 -- rsvp3am@hotmail.com.

       You don't have to be American to be an acclaimed litblogger, but it helps  I suppose when you pen a piece on the newfound prominence of blogs, you're always bound to offend people with non-inclusion.  That certainly explains the exhaustive lists provided on here by litbloggers in our 20 Questions series.  And when a journalist in the mainstream media pens a piece on blogging per se, it's always bound to promote a flurry of commentary in the blogosphere.  Heaven knows  The Guardian 's  urlLink recent political blog awards scheme  caused no end of offence by non-inclusion of some favoured blogs from that particular domain.  I guess that's a rather protracted way of saying how angry I am that, like the  Evening Standard 's David Sexton before him, Robert McCrum in yesterday's  Observer  has managed to wax lyrical about litblogging and completely ignores those from his own country:   "The other country in which blogs have really taken off is the United States.  urlLink Hit & Run ,  urlLink the Black Table ,  urlLink Dong Resin ,  urlLink Zulkey ,  urlLink Low Culture ,  urlLink Old Hag ,  urlLink Press Think  and  urlLink I Keep a Diary  are just some of the more high profile of the American blogs. In the political arena, some of these blogs play an important role in shaping debate. It won't be long before they find a creative role, too."   For McCrum's generation, I guess the whole blogging thing is something of amusement value, rather than something to be taken seriously or considered worthy in its own right.  A novelty aspect of the literary world, no doubt.  McCrum wastes no time in dismissing Dave Eggers' serial novel on Salon too.  I am, of course, pleased for the blogs he mentions and the publicity they've obtained in the print media.  But, forgive me for saying it, there's some American litblogs that are slightly more worthy of a mention.  I won't going into that now but I will end in saying that while Joe Bloggs has no right to an automatic mention (given our unfocused nature, then again, we  are  attached to a litzine),  urlLink Splinters  and the  urlLink London News Review's Books Diary  were worthy of one.  Personally, I feel we live in a Republic of Letters, but if McCrum is going to get specific then he ought to take a look in his own backyard first.  Poor show McCrum, as we say this side of the pond.  Sarah Weinman has her thoughts on this,  urlLink here .

       20 Questions  Or alternatively, to gain inclusion on here, just mention on your blog that you've not been included thus far...  Here, it's the  urlLink Rake's Progress ' turn:  Why do you blog?  It beats working.   What are your favourite blogs?  The usual suspects.   urlLink Maud Newton ,  urlLink The Elegant Variation ,  urlLink The Reading Experience ,  urlLink Return of the Reluctant ,  urlLink Bookninja ,  urlLink Golden Rule Jones ,  urlLink Syntax of Things ,  urlLink Lit Saloon ,  urlLink Beatrice ,  urlLink Confessions of an Idiosyncratic Mind ,  urlLink A&L Daily ,  urlLink Cup of Chica ,  urlLink About Last Night ,  urlLink TMFTML ,  urlLink Splinters / urlLink In Writing ,  urlLink Largehearted boy ,  urlLink S/FJ ,  urlLink This Modern World ,  urlLink Bookslut ,  urlLink Collected Miscellany ,  urlLink Old Hag ,  urlLink brokentype ,  urlLink Last Plane to Jakarta ,  urlLink Aaron’s Baseball Blog / urlLink The Hardball Times ,  urlLink Football Outsiders ,  urlLink hip hop music dot com ,  urlLink Hipster Detritus ,  urlLink No Roll & Roll Fun ,  urlLink Izzle! Izzle Pfaff! .   urlLink Moby , when he was still active.  And Uncle Bob at  urlLink Identity Theory , who doesn’t usually blog but helps keep whippersnappers like me in line.   What are you reading at the moment? Dog of the South , the new DFW ( Oblivion ), and, at the behest of Mrs. Rake,  The Awakening , by Kate Chopin.    What is the best book you've ever read?  Argh.  I want to say  In Search of Lost Time,  but I guess I’ll go with  Blood Meridian .  It’s more than a novel, better than a “book.”    What is your favourite poem?  "Aubade," by Philip Larkin.   Who is your favourite musician(s)?  If I have to choose one, I’m taking Bob Dylan.  Best album, however, is a death match between  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, 69 Love Songs,  and  Bee Thousand.  What is your favourite quote?  You have asked me what I would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can, and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use.. silence, exile, and cunning.   How did you vote in the last election?  In vain.   What do you consider to be the main threat to civilisation?  Religious fanaticism.   What's the best piece of advice you've been given?  Know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em.  Know when to walk away, know when to run.   When do you view it permissible to lie?  When the cure’s worse than the disease.   If your house was on fire, what possessions would you grab?  Just the dog and the best bottle of whiskey on the shelf.   Define pleasure.  When the one you’re thinking of is thinking of you.   Define pain. When the one you’re thinking of has forsaken you.  What animal would you most like to be?  A crow.   What has been your best blogging experience?  The best moment was the first time I saw RP mentioned/linked to (at  urlLink Ed's ).  The graciousness and intelligence of the lit blogging community is an ongoing pleasure.   What has been your worst blogging experience?  I haven’t been around long enough to suffer much.  Anything involving the technical aspects of running the blog makes my stomach turn.   Who are your heroes (in any field)?  I honestly try to avoid them.   Who is your favourite comedian of all time?  Bill Hicks/Andy Kaufman.  Toss up.   What one thing would improve the quality of your life?  $500,000.

       Pssst...  From this week's   urlLink Private Eye  :   "No current British writer worries about his or her inferiority to Yankee competition for the simple reason that the American novel has been more or less washed up since the early 1990s - old stagers such as Roth ( American Pastoral  notwithstanding) and Mailer (and Mr U[pdike] himself, I fear) sunk in torpor, newcomers like the Dave Eggers-fathered McSweeney's crowd more interested in back-slapping group promotion...  Does anyone seriously think that Zadie Smith would have gone quite as far had she not looked like a cadet member of the Pointer Sisters? As Yasmin Alibai-Brown suggested, how would  Brick Lane  have fared in the bestseller charts had its author worn a burkah and chaired the Shoreditch Islamic Sisters Against The Great Satan Bush Coalition?"   And in today's   urlLink Evening Standard  :   "Zadie makes peace AT LAST a reconciliation between Zadie Smith and the Orange Prize.  When her first novel  White Teeth  was nominated four years ago, the temperamental author invited William Hague's wife Ffion, one of the judges, to "kiss my behind". She hadn't been back since but this year peace has finally broken out.  Zadie sidled into last night's party with her fiance Nick Laird and the two stayed late into the evening.  "I'm not sure she was actually invited this year," mused one of the PR team at the marquee on the South Bank. Meanwhile unkind wags at the party suggested that Zadie, dressed in a trademark frock accompanied by a Latino-esque flower in her hair had serious competition for the best dressed party-goer from transvestite Turner Prize-winning potter Grayson Perry, who wore one of his famous doll's dresses. The £30,000 Orange Prize was won by Andrea Levy for her novel  Small Island ."    Literary rivals "WELCOME TO the finest literary awards ceremony of the evening," quipped Mark Le Fanu introducing the Society of Authors annual awards.  "I believe there's another ceremony going on tonight, but we don't talk about that." Hackles were raised after the Orange Prize scheduled its own awards to coincide with the SOA event. "I hear they are bribing celebrities to attend," sniffed Lady Antonia Fraser, referring to Orange. "I did not have to be bribed, thankfully." Other guests included Lynne Truss, David Lodge and Margaret Drabble."

       The worst system apart from all the others  As the race for London's Mayor hots up (well, maybe not), the candidates have been asked their opinions by the  Evening Standard  on subjects as varied as the price of a pint of milk and their literary tastes.  A few weeks ago, the  soi disant  left-libertarian author Will Self used his column in the paper to state his voting intentions as being for the oleaginous Liberal Simon Hughes and claimed that Conservative Steve Norris  "looks as if he belongs in a car showroom" .  However, in today's edition, Mr Norris claims that:   "The last book I bought was JM Coetzee's  Disgrace . I think he's terrific. I'm also a fan of Zadie Smith and Will Self."   We all know these things are written by campaign aides but don't they keep up on these kind of things? Or are we supposed to believe that Mr Norris' affection for Will Self's work is so deep as to be magnanimous?  (for those non-London-based readers of Joe Bloggs unable to vote on Thursday, you can always  urlLink buy a vote on eBay off this guy ...)

       "Then I saw her face..."  I like  urlLink  The Believer  , I really do.  And I think its 'Idea Share' section is a good idea.  In theory. (echoes of Homer Simpson's  "In theory, communism works. In theory."  speech here) But why do people have to be so lame? I mean there's hours of fun to be had here, picturing people sat on buses going "Hmmm..." over the following:   "Someone should invent a kind of food that is designed to be mixed and heated in an hour or two by the friction generated by your pants’ pockets."   or   "Someone should write a Choose Your Own Adventure history book. Readers would be able to read about the Battle of Waterloo and trace the actions of those involved—of anyone involved. Critical moments in history would come alive: The First Congressional Congress, the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, etc. You could zero in on the life of man who lit the candles when the Founding Fathers worked late, follow him home, and... well, you get the idea."   Perhaps it's woefully obvious why these have remained ideas with no tangible outcome? Apologies if those concerned are reading this.  Actually, no, I don't apologise at all.  Stop being so goddamn lame!

       Public Service Announcement  McSweeney's carries an amusing feature -- a  urlLink Daily Reason to Dispatch Bush .     3AM  is a literary mag, it's not our business to lecture you on politics, though we are in the business of carrying political content in the name of debate.  However, this Thursday is the date for the elections in London.  On the basis of this, you might make two initial points:   i) the elections are for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly, both of which are toothless institutions dreamed up by Tony Blair and his lawyer friends at a dinner soiree in Islington circa 1996 as a means of restoring the London-wide government abolished during a fit of pique by Margaret Thatcher in 1986 but without giving Londoners any real power as it's always been a bolshy place and they'll just abuse it again; ii)  3AM's  writers and readers either have a disdain for the farce that is liberal democracy (especially parties of the so-called left) or are inclined to tolerate West London cokeheads who just care about money and will therefore vote Steve Norris because they want to shag Tara Palmer-Tompkinson and her rich friends (need I point out that the latest  Zembla  has tacit Tory Bob Geldof on the front cover?).   The point is, just get out and vote as all the  urlLink British National Party  need to gain a seat on the London Assembly (which is looking  urlLink increasingly likely ) is a measly 5% of the vote in the capital.  OK, I hear you say, but there's enough racists elected under the current system, what makes these jokers so special? Try holocaust denial, links to paramilitary organisations and routine beatings for anyone whose skin colour they don't like -- for just three.  As someone who gets dewy-eyed at the mention of Routemasters (though I do think they belong in a museum), I'm going to place my big fat X next to the box with Ken Livingstone written on it -- anyone who wants to rant at length about how he's in the same party as Tony Blair is welcome to join me down the pub to do so.  Actually, I know there's one Richard at  3AM  who thinks the Labour Party has always sold out those it puports to represent while another of the Richards is a bit of a romantic old lefty at heart.  I'll leave you to work out which one is which.

       Still waiting for that  3AM  revamp?  Is it just me or is  urlLink Rachel Cooke's review  of the much talked about biography of BS Johnson in  The Observer  woefully tame and pedestrian? Given what she had to work with, she barely says anything.  Despite the presence of  urlLink McCrum  on its pages, the  Observer 's book reviews section is but an anti-climax to the weekend's reading of the papers.  Step aside Young British Authors --  urlLink the best  of Britain's young poets ( urlLink apparently ).  Hay-on-Wye and BookExpo are now over, leaving me to enjoy the  urlLink Comica  festival at the ICA and look forward to the Clerkenwell Literary Festival starting July 9.

       Maybe we should get out more  The only thing worse than not being at Hay is  urlLink blogging about Hay .  Unlike the rest of the blogosphere, we're not at BookExpo either.  But we were able to soak up this pollen-infested day in London with reviews of the  urlLink BS Johnson biography  and a personal examination of  urlLink what BritArt means .  I loved the conclusion to the latter:   "Ten years ago, blood heads and penis mannequins and Myra Hindley made of children's handprints seemed to say it all about our culture. But now, consumerism and Holly Valance and the sheer mind-blinding horror of a planet inhabited by people who look and talk like they're in a L'Oreal ad (all the time) has triumphed totally and utterly and forever.   Britart fought the good fight, but lost, and like it or not, we now all live in an episode of Hollyoaks."   He's right.  Seven years of New Labour (we should have known, given the use of a D:Ream song as their campaign theme) has rendered London (I don't know about the rest of the country, it's probably much worse there, I daren't find out) into a cardboard cut-out designer socialist utopia of bland chain bars, ringtones and reality TV.  New Labour's strategy is to make it difficult for themselves to disagree with any of the alternatives - authoritarian Cabinet ministers can point to their radical chic days in the 60s and 70s, junior ministers can show you photos of themselves working at law centres for the poor of Islington in the 80s - just so long as you accept that while it was cool, it's in the past.  Because of the Tory media we have to allow ourselves be enslaved to, all we can offer people is the chance to buy into an estate agent's (probably driven around in a Mini Cooper with faux graffiti on the side) dream.  London is fat, complacent and ultimately dull.  Only Norman Foster architecture can save us it seems.

       Happiness in magazines  You would think that the  urlLink news of the Booker Prize  launching a global off-shoot would be met with shrieks of protest from former Booker judging chair Professor Lisa Jardine, who once fatuously declared that  "the Booker will become as British an institution as English muffins in American supermarkets" .  Apparently not, as it's  "a good thing - a real innovation... It means writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Orhan Parmuk could be rewarded."  Now that's pragmatism for you.  Andrew O'Hagan sits down with a  urlLink coffee table's worth of lad mags  and declares that:   "Britain's news-stands are heaving with magazines devoted to the rough magic of being a bloke. On first sight you think they are what my friends used to call scud mags; the girls who adorn the covers - legs wide, breasts atumble, nipples fit for pegging a couple of wet dufflecoats on - tend to be among the nearly famous, a tribe of models admired by laddish editors for their friendly shagability and the hunger in their eyes. The market for male 'general interest' magazines has grown massively in the UK, as if young men suddenly needed to be celebrated and serviced in a new way, as if there were a new demand among them for reassurance about the wonders of male normalcy. They look for all this in the way people like Tony Parsons have taught them, in a spirit of soft-core irony and hard-core sentiment. But apart from reassurance and a sort of avenging pride, what are these magazines selling to their readers? With their grisly combinations of sensitivity and debasement - 'How to Bathe Your New Baby' v. 'Win the Chance to Pole-Dance with Pamela!' - it may be time to consider whether these men's magazines aren't just the latest enlargement on the old fantasy of men having everything they want to have and finding a way to call it their destiny."    The genre is obviously doing better than the style mag sector, as  Jockey Slut  and  Sleaze 's parent company has folded, leaving   urlLink Dazed and Confused   and   urlLink Wallpaper   to slug it out for the title of undisputed house magazine of the Hoxton clone (c/o  urlLink Voltage ).  This week's  Time Out  is guest-edited by novelist Jake Arnott, who devotes the issue to 'Underground London':   " Time Out  had its roots in the underground press of the '60s and '70s, and when I was asked to guest edit this issue, I wanted to look at where the tradition of dissent is today, maybe provoking something of a revival in its spirit.  Now is as good a time as any - the false consensus of New Labour has fallen apart and protest is in the air once more."   A brief flick through the magazine demonstrates quite amply that  Time Out 's 'roots' mean jack shit today.  I guess it's all about co-opting radical edges and hip, a bit like that 'false consensus'...   urlLink Jenny Colgan  is told by the Hay Festival organisers that she's "not classy enough" for them.  She's more than welcome to speak at our Summer event,  A Riot of Our Own , at the  urlLink Stuckist Gallery , 3 Charlotte Road, Hoxton London EC2 on July 3rd (our Paris event has been deferred until September now...).  Our first confirmed speaker is  urlLink Colin McCabe  with more to be announced.  Myself and Tom Hirst will be responsible for tomfoolery on the wheels of steel.

       Imbibe to inscribe   urlLink Rake's Progress  on top form yesterday, donating a little commentary to Joe Bloggs' own 20 Questions feature.  Mr Rake  urlLink goes on  in his  Critique de la Vie Quotidienne  to mention a  Writer's Digest  survey on the drinking habits of writers, the questions being:   1. "How would you describe your own drinking habits? -----Light -----Medium -----Heavy -----Other?"  2. "When you feel like having a few drinks, what do you usually have?" 3. "Any favorite hangouts for drinking?" 4. "Favorite drinking companions?" 5. "Heaviest drinkers/writers that you know--or have known--of?" 6. "Do you see any affinity between hard drinking and the writing life? Explain."   Seems like a good enough exercise to me -- maybe a Joe Bloggs regular feature in the making there.  I have officially designated June as my month  on the wagon  though -- an admission that will no doubt cause wry amusement with Andrew Gallix, who often observes that if I drank less the other 11 months of the year I wouldn't need one month off.  There's films I need to watch, bank balances to be restored, waistlines to be receded and wellbeing to be considered though.  I managed to sit and drink Coke all night the other evening so I seem to be doing OK.  Yes Andrew, just keep telling yourself that.  Anyhow,  Rake's Progress , hard drinking and the literary life -- reminds me of the comments  urlLink Matthew Collings  made at our Xmas Bash last year about being fed up with drunken literary sorts.  There's a book in that, I tell you.  If I stay sober long enough I might even be able to write it.

The Story of O  comes in for  urlLink a timely assessment  at 50:  "But beyond its merits as a literary work, its merits or limits as pornography, there lies the paradox that this incendiary book was written by a woman who wore little make-up and no jewellery, who dressed with quiet elegance, who lived out a polite, bluestocking existence in a small flat with her parents and son. Beneath this unlikely exterior raged terrible passions. In the end, the most instructive aspect of the book is that it demonstrates the demoniac nature of sexuality in any or all of us. This quiet, learned woman understood the power of sex. She knew that desire can ignite compulsions to commit sudden, arbitrary violence and induce a yearning for voluptuous, annihilating death."

Julian Evans in  Prospect  on  urlLink Europe's lost writers :  "What went wrong in the old world? I fed, from inky school bench onwards, on Maupassant, Flaubert, Zola, Céline, Sartre, Camus, Proust; my youthful spirit was bottled in the poetry of Nerval, Baudelaire and Valery Larbaud. It was French literature that represented the greatest of the continent; and it was France's decline that occluded our interest in Europe. But wait: isn't the idea that French fiction declined merely a figment of British ignorance? Surely the French would declare the reverse - that the novel advanced on the continent while Britain got caught in a formal cul- de-sac. The nouveau roman - exploring a subjective, randomised world of objects and sensations - dismissed the narrative novel's "dubious relationship" with the world."   urlLink David Foster Wallace  takes up comedy (also  urlLink here ).   urlLink London Studies  and Nick Cohen's  urlLink scathing attack on the modernisers of New Labour  in  The Guardian .

       urlLink      The Missing Links - Stevens    The Bell Jar  for Generation X, Elizabeth Wurtzel's  Prozac Nation ,  urlLink in  The Observer  today :  "At 10 years' distance,  Prozac Nation  remains - and this is not intended as criticism - a strikingly adolescent read. It contains absurdly showy lines such as 'Maybe what I really need is some Thoreau.' Moreover, it is stuffed with aphorisms founded on the kind of dogmatic certainty that adulthood perhaps erodes: 'There are two kind of dysfunctional families: those who don't talk enough, and those who talk too much'; 'If you feel everything intensely, ultimately you feel nothing at all'; 'Insanity is knowing that what you're doing is completely idiotic, but somehow you just can't stop it.' " The Guardian   urlLink feature short stories  from the likes of Jonathan Safran Foer and Hanif Kureishi.  Moral outrage on London's streets --  urlLink indecent sculpture  attracts the attention of the authorities.   urlLink Caryl Phillips  on Colin McInnes:  "Today, Britain remains the most multiracial of European countries, and London is Europe's most multicultural and racially diverse city. More than 300 different languages are spoken daily in London schools, yet, if we look at contemporary British literature, some of the absences of the 1950s continue today. Then and now, black writers addressed British life, and naturally enough these writers included black characters in their work. Perhaps Samuel Selvon's  The Lonely Londoners  (1956) is the best example of a 50s novel that tackles the problems of race and class that bedevilled British society at the time. But writers such as George Lamming and VS Naipaul also wrote about race, class and British society, as did Africans, most memorably Wole Soyinka in his poem "The Immigrant". Like their successors in Britain today - Ben Okri, Hanif Kureishi - these writers wrote and write about contemporary Britain with eyes that take in not only black people, but white people too. The lack of any reciprocal imagining on the part of white British writers is puzzling."  Sean Walsh of the  urlLink LNR Books Diary  becomes the latest litblogger to suffer at the hands of  Zembla 's new site.   The Spectator  is back on young fogeyish form with its diatribe against 'rock and roll',  urlLink having taken 50 years to notice it , apparently:  "...with its manufactured sense of outrage, juvenile emotionalism, bogus egalitarianism and grotesque sentimentality, pop lacks the capacity to express any feelings other than the most basic; that by trying to be rebellious in some inchoate, let’s-goad-the-parents sort of way, it has turned out a succession of illiterate chumps who are more conformist than the ‘establishment’ figures they find it daring to mock. How else does one account for those oafish lumpenproletarians, Oasis, who appear to have walked out of a Theodore Dalrymple column?"   urlLink Irvine Welsh  shares  urlLink his outlook on life .   urlLink The Literary Saloon on BS Johnson , citing  urlLink Nicholas Lezard's defence  of the much-talked-about literary figure against Giles Coren's tiresome review in  The Times  recently:  "I dwell on Coren's review because it typifies the kind of smirking philistinism that makes this country far more of a cultural desert than it needs to be, and may well have been one of the factors that drove Johnson to slit his wrists in a hot bath at the age of 40."

       The Clerkenwell Literary Festival  From today's   urlLink Evening Standard   'Londoner's Diary':   "CLERKENWELL Literary Festival's Community and Family day went down a storm - with one exception.  Writer and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter was so disturbed by the fracas taking place near her house in St James's Church that she called the police.  "Evidently Janet did not have much sleep on Sunday afternoon and she came down and started swearing," lit fest organiser Victoria Hull tells me.  "There was also a set by singer Louis Elliot and there was also a very loud seven-year-old on the trumpet so perhaps that was what she objected to.  The police came but they were fine as we had already cleared the event with them." JS-P, who was the pioneer of Yoof TV in the 1980s is unrepentant. "The organisers had gone on longer than their licence," she insists.  "That's why the police were involved.""

       Turning rebellion into money  Sean O'Hagan on the commodification of  urlLink Che Guevara . Here's film producer Paul Webster says:  "'No. There is no myth around Castro. Che was young and beautiful, and that, as much as all that happened later, is what underpins the myth. Paul Newman once said, "If I'd been born with brown eyes, I wouldn't be a film star." Well, if Che hadn't been born so good-looking, he wouldn't be a mythical revolutionary.'"  Here's another extract:  "'The image of Che was just so right for the time,' says liberal American writer Lawrence Osborne, whose critique of Guevara appeared recently in the New York Observer. 'Che was the revolutionary as rock star. Korda, as a fashion photographer, sensed that instinctively, and caught it. Before then, the Nazis were the only political movement to understand the power of glamour and sexual charisma, and exploit it. The Communists never got it. Then you have the Cuban revolution, and into this void come these macho guys with their straggly hair and beards and big-dick glamour, and suddenly Norman Mailer and all the radi cal chic crowd are creaming their jeans. Che had them in the palm of his hand, and he knew it. What he didn't know, of course, was how much that image would define him.'"

       urlLink       The Missing Links - Stevens  British intellectuals in  urlLink "not oxymoron" claim  (he's right, you know):  "Many British people instinctively feel that we don't have intellectuals. Intellectuals are tousle-haired people sitting in cafes, smoking Gauloises and talking about Being and Nothingness. In short, they're French. Here, if someone describes someone else as "an intellectual" you can usually hear the ironic quotation marks buzzing round the epithet like wasps. Or they'll say, "he's a bit of an intellectual". "British intellectual" is taken almost for an oxymoron, like "military intelligence" or "honest politician". Most other European countries have a social group they call the intelligentsia, or simply "intellectuals". In Britain, we say "the chattering classes". This label was, of course, itself invented by members of our chattering classes (ie intelligentsia), thus illustrating how British irony has a habit of disappearing up its own rear end."

Can you  urlLink  help this young woman with her homework ?  urlLink  The Idler 's  urlLink  Tom Hodgkinson  reviews Madeleine Bunting's  urlLink  Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture Is Ruining Our Lives :  "One coercive technique used by employers to make willing slaves of us, says Bunting, is the "brand". Big companies use concepts such as brand loyalty and "teamwork" to give the illusion that the company is bringing some sort of meaning into people's lives; meaning that was once provided by church and community. Thus they hang on to their staff. Brands cleverly use inspirational slogans to convince their employees they are on some sort of mission and not merely underpaid and exploited profit-creators for a handful of fat cats. Words such as "passion" and "commitment" are bandied around. Asda, for example, encourages its employees to believe they are lucky to be part of a caring family. Managers look for cheerful souls, team players. And woe betide anyone who doesn't join in. . . . So if it is true that work is a gigantic con trick that we are now waking up to, the question remains: if we dismantle the job system, then what do we replace it with? How do we live? One answer is to live well on less. If we do not desire the panoply of products that are sold to us each day, then we will not have such a voracious appetite for money. Less money means less work. Less work means more freedom to do our own work or do what we want to do"  (Hodgkinson's  How To Be Idle  comes out in August).

       urlLink        3AM  Update  The  urlLink  3AM Magazine   summer shindig,  A Riot of Our Own , was held at the  urlLink Stuckist Gallery  in Shoreditch, East London last night.  The event also included the awarding of the inaugural  3AM  Good Sex Prize, won by Mounsi's  The Demented Dance  ( urlLink Black Amber , 2003).  Mounsi's reading was interpreted from the French by his agent,  urlLink Georgia de Chamberet  (also editor of  XCiTés: the Flamingo Book of New French Writing ).  Readings also took place from Tony White, Clive Murphy and Colin MacCabe, while The Fucks and Mark Sampson provided acoustic entertainment.  In addition to Mounsi,  urlLink Tony White  was also shortlisted for the prize for his novel  urlLink  Foxy-T  , which like  The Demented Dance  was published to acclaim last year and deals with complex issues of ethnicity among the marginalised youth in the inner city of a nation's capital (Paris and London respectively).  For that reason alone it was worthwhile to see the authors discuss each other's work and reflect on the overlaps.

The  Sleazoid Express   urlLink website .  The  urlLink Kultureflash  weekly email mentions the forthcoming (July 3)  3AM  event at the  urlLink Stuckist  gallery in Shoreditch:   "3am magazine has been on the go since 2000 and is showing no signs of blear. For the uninitiated, it's an e-journal that dips its snout in the trough of quotidian life and comes out with factual and fictional accounts filed under regular headings such as "Fat Man on the Left", "Fetish Alphabet" and "Parisianism For Beginners" that are worth the truffle hunt. Eclectic and odd, 3am tells us what the zeitgeist is while it still sounds like a foreign language. The magazine's Summer Shindig this year is at the Stuckist Gallery, another home to admirable artists of great conviction whose metier still leaves us a little confused. The event is billed as "a literary event with turntables or turning the tables on literary events" and boasts a fine line-up in word and music. Readers include Godard aficionado Colin McCabe and the man who coined the term "metrosexual", Mark Simpson, whose latest offering,  Saint Morrissey , was put together without any primary research whatsoever but with the devotion of a dyed-in-the-wool fan. Mark Sampson, Sweetie and The F*!ks of Angular Records are playing acoustic sets and there are DJs to boot. In keeping with the smoke and mirrors mystery of the affair, entry is free, but you must rsvp to attend."
