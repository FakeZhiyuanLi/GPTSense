      by Matt Hankins  MARTINSVILLE, Va. â€“ Martinsville City Public Works will close Oakdale Street Monday, August 2.  The street closure between Mulberry Road to Church Street will accommodate a construction project at the YMCA. A crane will be unloading concrete panels for use in the construction. The crane work is expected to last throughout the day, so through traffic should expect to detour around using Starling Avenue as the connector. Drivers should be aware of heavier-than-usual traffic at the intersections of Starling-Mulberry-Market and Church-Starling. (7/31/04)

       Hurricane Charley has made landfall again, this time just north of Charleston, South Carolina, with winds of 85 mph. Charley tore through Florida Friday. South Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency.  In Virginia, emergency services officials say Hurricane Charley could bring tropical storm-force winds to the outer banks.  The Flood Watch has been cancelled for the following areas: In North Carolina... Stokes and Rockingham. In Virginia... Roanoke... Botetourt... Rockbridge... Patrick... Franklin... Bedford... Amherst and Henry.The threat of heavy rainfall across the foothills and along and near the Blue Ridge in Virginia... as well as over northwest portions of the North Carolina Piedmont has diminished significantly. However additional rainfall is likely this afternoon generally east of a line from Danville to Lynchburg as deeper tropical moisture surges north out of central North Carolina.

       About 1,000 spectators watched as 130 kayakers competed in the 22nd annual Kibler Valley River Run Saturday. The competition is sponsored by the Red Bank Ruritan Club in Patrick County and draws water enthusiasts from all around. The course began at noon and takes about a half an hour to complete.  This year was a special challenge for event planners because of work being done to the pipeline that carries water from Pinnacles Dam to the generator powerhouse. The Dam was built years ago to supply additional electricity to the city of Danville.  The event serves as the primary fund raiser for the Red Bank Ruritan Club. About $5,000 is raised each year. Contestants paid $25 to compete in this year's event. (Photograph by Danny Turner) (8/1/04)

Henry County officials say they could not provide the company with a large enough building to meet their needs. The company decided on the old Pillowtex building in Eden. (8/1/04)
