       I just love being a recovering addict on blogspot.  Ever notice how it is really Blogs-pot?  Maybe that's me being me, a drug addict who sees the word pot in like everything I ever see.  I smoked pot for over thirty some years like almost every day and it finally got in the way.  In the way of my crack habit actually.  I only really started that as a way to bond with my older brother.  He recently died from his habit, actually from an aneurysm, which my dad also had, but his was in a hospital where four of the states best cardio surgeons just happened to be that day.  He complained of a back ache and his doctor said to go on down to the Hosp. And would meet him there.  They said he would never had made the ambulance trip.  So, I'm High-risk for that, great. :(  I sometimes tell stories just to tell other stories, kind of like a background.  I feel I have to for you to fully understand what I am trying desperately to say.  I also really appreciate Blogspot as I have tried other blog-creation sites and they were just waaaaaay too hard to crack (oops!)  I keep mentioning crack, that's not the thing to say in the rooms of recovery.  Some oldtimer once said we should just refer to a particular  drug as a "drug" and leave the romancing of the particular drug to the actual drug users.  I feel it is okay to casually mention drug names, but only in a meeting where I am the speaker, and no one else can share, that really happens sometimes.  Also if I want to really name call my addiction I go to a Cocaine anonymous meeting.  Man they really get it on there!  Also sometimes to AA, where I have over five years sobriety, although in NA I only am clean for just over two years.  I pick and choose my meetings.  Here in Pinellas county we have over 95 meetings each week.  I feel we have a lot of NA meetings because there is such a relation to the number of crack dealers here.  Who really knows for sure.  One thing is for sure, if you don't like the meeting you are going to, there are a lot of different meetings to choose from.  There are strict meetings, where you sit and don't talk unless you are a fervent home-group member AND have three years clean, and then there are the kind of meetings I enjoy, where you make a cat-call when\en they read the eleventh tradition when they say attraction not promotion.  And when, in the reading of the steps, you say "What about alcohol?" immediately before someone reads "Thinking about alcohol...".  This one really makes you out to be really smart, or at least like you've been to a couple of meetings beforehand.  I hate Blogs that just go on and on and on....
