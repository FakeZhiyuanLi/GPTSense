      Hi gang -- Greetings from the land of the unconstitutional California recall, the unconstitutional Pledge of Allegiance, the unconstitutional.... well, you get the idea.  In response to Elizabeth's post, I actually kind of like "The '04 Wall" as a name for the blog... then again, I've never been much for clever names (see, e.g., my name in the masthead of the Joke Issue of YLJ). But I'd throw my vote toward the status quo, at least for now...  As for news from the appeals court that never sleeps, there's an interesting personal jurisdiction decision out in the  Yahoo!  case from yesterday, available at  urlLink this link . Basically, the court, through Judge Warren Ferguson, held that these two French firms had not subjected themselves to jurisdiction in U.S. courts by sending Yahoo! a cease-and-desist letter to take down various links to Nazi-related items available to browsers in France (in violation of the French Nazi Symbols Act). The district court had held to the contrary, a decision Judge Melvin Brunetti, in dissent, agreed with.  Not the sexiest case of the year, but an intriguing international civil litigation issue nonetheless, and one that, I believe, several of our classmates have written about... :-)  In other interesting Ninth Circuit news, for those  urlLink Dan Kahan  fans out there, we've had two high profile shaming decisions in the last couple of weeks. In the first,  urlLink Demery v. Arpaio , the court struck down the use of live webcams inside the holding cell (among other places) in a Phoenix jail... by contrast, in  urlLink United States v. Gementera , the court upheld a district court's sentence that included, as a condition (I kid you not), that the defendant had to walk around outside a local post office wearing a sign that said "I Stole Mail!"  I was never much of a Kahan groupie (except for when he popped by our late-night games of Settlers of Catan in the dorms first year), but these both seem interesting manifestations of the larger issue of shaming sanctions...  Anyway, I hope all is well with everyone, and I'm looking forward to hearing how the post-YLS life is treating everybody else!  P.S. My better suggestion for a name (though I still prefer 'The '04 Wall' is "Koffee Three," or some other play on something New Havenish... for those of us, that is, who miss it...

       Welcome!   As soon as we can, Jon and I are going to try to get the class list from the registrar to invite the whole class, but in the meantime, tell everyone you know in YLS04 to check it out.   We'd conceived of this place as a way for the class to keep in touch, share legal experiences (working, clerking, keeping ourselves out of jail, etc.) and express opinions on everything and anything.  Basically, we want to entertain ourselves and each other.  Obviously, it will become whatever we all want it to be, and I can't wait to see what bizarre form it takes.  If you'd like to post but haven't gotten a log-in, e-mail Jon or me, and we'll put it up for you or arrange a log-in.  There are no rules per se, but as a general rule, if you're posting something that has to do with your work, obviously be aware of whatever privileges/ethical guidelines apply (the secrecy of a judge's chambers, attorney-client privilege, general theories of slander: i.e. "Tony Kronman smokes crack" might cause us some problems).  Remember,  anyone  can see this blog (and I am sure the rest of the world is just dying to tune in to hear what YLS04 has to say), so be cautious.  But not if it means holding back something entertaining, of course.  First order of business -- what should we call it?  We were thinking of it as a virtual "Wall" -- with fewer (only slightly) personal attacks and more fun, but couldn't think of a really good name.  So let's hear some suggestions.
