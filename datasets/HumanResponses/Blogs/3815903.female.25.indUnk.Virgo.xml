      I think I'm going to like Blogging.  I thought about it the whole night at work last night.  What I was going to write about, who i was going to talk about etc...   I said I was going to talk some about me so I guess I will.  I'm starting the later half of my 20's, Have a few kids, Mainly stay home and be a mom most of the time, some times i get a wild hair to make some money.  This would be one of those times... I didn't make any sales though.. quota is a bitch.  The last guy i talked to last night, wouldn't even let me pitch the package to him, he was sure i had called him for another reason.  He told me that all things happen for a reason (which i do believe) and that there are no mistakes in life.  He went on to tell me how he discovered this  urlLink book  that changed his life forever.  He claimed that through the teachings of this  urlLink woman  he was actually healing the cancer in his body... said he could feel it and after being diagnosed this meditation actually is making it go away... I'm not so sure about that, but i think i'm gonna buy the book.

      What's with all the hype about   BLOGS  ?  I never even heard of a   BLOG   until that washingtoneitte girly was busted using the congressional computers for her tales of  sauciness . I admit it.  I read it.  Intriguing.  She got a book deal.  I might buy it for my mom.  She reads all those romance harlequin (aka porn) books.  I never was good at keeping diaries, mainly because I was afraid my parents would read and think I was some sort of fruitcake...they would have been right..but I thought that if it was online I may be more apt to keep a log of thoughts.    I anticipate I will randomly change subject, ranting and raving about this and that, whatever is on my mind at any given time.  I typically don't work, so I'm liable to post several times a day some days.    I'm experimenting with working again.  This time I'm selling vacations for some little podunk company that is sure to screw me and fire me the first chance they get.  Not many that I know have much faith in this job.  I'm just not good in the work force.  Thank the Universe for my husband.  I'd be lost without a good man.  Maybe next post I'll share some about my HUGE family... Let  you get to know me before I just start randomly babbling... maybe not... I don't know.  I do know the little one will be up soon, I should fix lunch.  not sure how i'm going to sign this yet.

       My husband works at a highschool.  He  did  clean the kitchen.  He actually bid on that position 2 years ago and won it.  NOW because they want some idot to quit instead of fireing him-- with just 1weeks notice the supervisor  swapped him and my husbands jobs.  Instead of working 7-3:30 in the kitchen where he has been for 2 years, on monday he has to work on the 2nd floor and   girls   locker room from 3:30 to 11 and if he wants ANY over time, its after.  SO by the time he gets home it will be like 3:30-4 in the morning (because we NEED overtime) .    I know in many familys everyone works.  I do not.  Rarely do I have a job.  We are a Husband works, wife stays home with child and bakes kinda family.    I know it may sound selfish.. but I   AM   an emotional wreck--always have been...  If i wanted to spend all my time without my husband, i would have stayed single you know?   3:30 to 11-- 4 if he does over time... thats insane.  He got the kitchen position because he knew he would need evenings with his child.  To give away his position because they want some chew swallowing toothless guy to quit is not nice.   I am just mad.  I need to get back to his resume.  We never realized how tricky they were.  *driving me nuts!*

      Out of boredom, I decided to start writing again.  I used to be an excellent writer in school.  I was always turning my english teacher's heads when I handed in a creative work.  When I was younger, I had a much darker persona.  I was into dark twisted stories and vampires and eternalness--> anything that caught my eye was usually beautiful but in a twisted kinda beautiful (like for example the artwork for seth macfarlane's ALICE... take something beautiful and twist it.)   Even in my writing it showed, and still does, especially in poetry.  Rambling thoughts in a journal is different mind you, but my dreams inspire me to write poetry the way i do.  It's usually a mix of words, emotions and twisted, lost and swept away feelings.    What I'm writing now, I'm hoping to be different.   Whether it will be for submission somewhere, or just a sense that I accoplished a work again, would make me very happy.  I have not written seriously in so long, but I'm planning on this being a fairly large piece of work perhaps.  If it gets interesting, I'll maybe post a bit.  Almost time for my husband to be home for lunch.   I shall Blog again.

      It has been a while since i last posted.  My family has been very busy of late.  We have had to deal with many ex family members trying to make our lives miserable.  It's not gonna happen.  We are strong in our unity and nothing is going to break that.  They can try all they want and say what they want and lick their asses all day, but this machine keeps rolling.   My family you ask?   We are a family based organization.  I have over 30 brothers and 6 sisters.   In my heart they are 100% my brothers and sisters.   We may look like a bunch of ragtag, longhaired bikers somedays, but we are not.  We are no sort of gang or cult.  If you wanna call it a club you can.  I call them my family.  It has been a very benificial part of my life.  My family has grown, I have MANY neices and nephews,  and i'm surrounded by people that are bound to the same morals that i am.  I feel very secure.  I love my family!  My man and I got a new house.  It is absolutely wonderful living in a HOUSE that is mine.  NO landlord, No restrictions on what i can do with the house, it is great.  The little one LOVES her polkadotted room:)  I found a friend from the past.  Known her for almost 13 years now.  Had lost her for a while.  One down, 3 to go.  If only i could find Donna, Amy and Kendrick.  I sure do miss them, even with all my family, I still miss them.   There are things in  my life i don't know if i wish to discuss under this name.  I may create another blog with my life stories.  There are many intersting things that i have been through, but i don't want certain people to be able to  find.  I'm still not sure if i shal blog it or if i should just use word and write it all into a little book.  I'll have to think on that.   In the meantime, I shall go about my housewife life(which i enjoy thouroughly, being able to be with my baby and sing and watch NOGGIN all day! ) i couldnt spend a day without her.  We take her EVERYWHERE.  15 months and no babysitters... most people would be going crazy.  I love it.  tried to give working a shot...not happening...then again, ive never been to good at work.  Thats it for now, had to update this, but didn't really have much to say really... so until nextime. (this will get more interesting i promise!)
