      Right well after a fun week in which I managed to break a string on my violin I thought I'd pay a visit here and write some more...  From now on each of my posts is going to be about at least one song...So to start with we have...  Green Day: Good Riddance (Time of your life)  I've always been quite fond of this even though it's possibly the most over-used and mis-used song ever. All over the place people go on about how it was their graduation song and it reminds them of all the great times they had etc etc etc. Does nobody except me see that the song is called Good Riddance (Time of your life)? Obviously... Won't stop me liking it, it just annoys me...Having songs constantly played is the no.1 way to ruin them for me. I'm willing to bet at my prom in March this will get played. And I won't be dancing. And I'm greatful for this song in a way, something modern to play on violin that isn't The Corrs, oh how I'm sick of The Corrs. And it's acoustic guitar, also perfect for me.   Good Riddance (Time of your life) - Lyrics   Another turning point,a fork stuck in the road. Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time. Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.

       One is always needed so here's my intoduction...  I'm Alix Carpenter and I live on the south coast of England, pretty much in the centre. I'm 15, I'll be 16 in March. I have brown hair, brown eyes, not short, not tall, not thin, not fat...I'm absolutely nothing really...Doesn't make my outlook on life look very positive does it? At GCSE I'm taking Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Statistics, English Language, English Literature, ICT, Music, Geography, Spanish, 1/2 course RE, 1/2 course Graphics. I took my Maths in November of year 10 (Almost 2 years early) and passed with an A. My one real love is music though. Whether it's performing, listening or composing, I love it all. I'm going to use this space to post some of my favourite song lyrics from time to time. Whether they're ones that are particularly relevant to me or just songs I remember from growing up. Performing has led me to have a rather eclectic taste in music, I don't care what I perform but I'm more picky about what I listen to. I'll happily sing Vivaldi's Gloria but I'll always be listening to Alanis Morissette, Keane, RHCP, Goo Goo Dolls etc etc. I sing with Hampshire County Youth Choir, possibly the favourite aspect of my life. It's one of the key things that makes me not want to grow up, when I go off to university, another 3 years away, I'll have to leave. I'll probably end up writing a lot about choir, I love singing... I also play piano, violin and classical guitar. I've been playing guitar since I was about 5, it was fine at first but as you grow up you want to escape the confines of classical music. Not that I have anything against classical music but at about 13 you just want to take everything out on it, play all those angst-ridden songs...So I quit my lessons and haven't touched a guitar in about a year. It's a shame because after 8 years you get quite good but hey, that's life. Anyway, I'm going to go now and plan what songs to introduce you to first. See you later...
