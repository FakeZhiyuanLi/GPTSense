      Look at your young men fighting. Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying. The way they've always done before. Look at the hate we're breeding. Look at the fear we're feeding. Look at the lives we're leading. The way we've always done before.  My hands are tied. The billions shift from side to side and the wars go on with brainwashed pride for the love of God and our human rights and all these things are swept aside by bloody hands time can't deny and are washed away by your genocide, and history hides the lies of our civil wars.  Did you wear a black armband when they shot the man who said "Peace could last forever."? And in my first memories they shot Kennedy. I went numb when I learned to see. So, I never fell for Vietnam we got the wall of D.C. to remind us all that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands, When everybody's fightin' for their promised land.  And I don't need your civil war. It feeds the rich while it buries the poor. Your power hungry sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store. Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war.  Look at the shoes your filling. Look at the blood we're spilling. Look at the world we're killing the way we've always done before. Look in the doubt we've wallowed. Look at the leaders we've followed. Look at the lies we've swallowed. And I don't want to hear no more.  My hands are tied. For all I've seen has changed my mind But still the wars go on as the years go by, with no love of God or human rights, 'Cause all these dreams are swept aside by bloody hands of the hypnotized, who carry the cross of homicide, and history bears the scars of our civil wars.  We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials. For example, to create a vacuum. Then, we fill that vacuum. As popular war advances, peace is closer. And I don't need your civil war. It feeds the rich while it buries the poor. Your power hungry sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store. Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war.  What's so civil about war anyway?

      ....while I pondered weak and weary. There was a rapper at my door. He had himself a fatass whore. I thought to myself..."SCORE!!!" Then I realized there were two more...as the months passed it became a chore. But, it never ever ever became a bore. for shore. popped out my double barell shotgun and shot her in a pore. so, i needed to go to the store. i ran outta condoms and this had never happened before. i went to priscillas....women galore. stuck it all the way to her core. had her beggin for more. i stuck it in and...damn...that shit tore. she let out this loud ass roar. then i let it pour.

      Finally someone let me out of my cage. Now, time for me is nothing cuz I'm counting no age. Now I couldn't be there. Now you shouldn't be scared. I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare. Intangible. Bet you didn't think so I command you to. Panoramic view. Look I'll make it all manageable. Pick and choose, sit and lose. all you different crews - chicks and dude. Who you think is really kickin' tunes? Picture you gettin down in a picture tube. Like you lit the fuse. You think it's fictional. Mystical? Maybe. Spiritual, hearable, What appears in you is a clearer view cuz you're too crazy. Lifeless. To know the definition for what life is. Priceless. For you because I put you on the hype shit. You like it? Gunsmokin' righteous with one token. Psychic among those. Possess you with one go. The essence the basics. Without it you make it. Allow me to make this. Childlike in nature. Rhythm. You have it or you don't. That's a fallacy. I'm in them. Every sprouting tree. Every child apiece. Every cloud you see. You see with your eyes. I see destruction and demise. Corruption in disguise. From this fuck it enterprise. Now I'm sucking to your lies. through russ, nthough not his muscles but the percussion he provides with me as a guide. but ya'll can see me now cuz you don't see with your eyes. You perceive with your mind. thats the inner. So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor. Bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers remember where the thought is. I brought all this. So you can survive when the law is lawless. Feelings, sesnsations that you thought were dead. No squealing, and remember that it's all in your head.

      So yeah, I was walking down the street, right, and like, I came across the strangest sight. I think it was a man. He looked very beast-like. He had on a lot of baggy clothes...very baggy clothes. His skin-dirty. Face, unshaven. Hair, nappy. Lips, holding a ravelled cigarette, more than likely a marijuana cigarette. Teeth were black and some missing. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand straight up as I saw this creature. I crept away as quickly as possible and turned off of South Main St. Yeah, in case you dont know...I just described about 98 percent of the population in Louisburg. Oh yeah...one more thing. What's red and crawls up your leg?...the answer...read the title of this post.

      Let me tell you, I've seen a lot of fuckin' shit in my day. Speaking of shit...right now, I feel like shit. I'm one ounce of gunpowder away from taking a trip far away. So get this, I'm driving my car and everything...come up to a stoplight, and it's red so I stop. The car starts smoking when I press the gas to go. So, I pull over and open the hood. Look around, antifreeze is everywhere. So, the water hose came off. I get the bright idea to turn around and head home. Halfway home, the car cuts off. I wait and let it cool down, then I go home. I barely made it home, but to fix my car is gonna cost $2500 because I cracked two gasket heads....all because I drove home. If I had just stayed out there in the heat, I could have had it fixed for $60 for the water hose to be fixed. Instead...I just had to get home. So, when my mom said it's gonna cost $2500, I said, "well....*long silent pause*...I have about $120..." So...I'm fucked. And I'm mad. I'm dangerously mad. How much worse can life fucking get. Goddamnit. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that one of my friends and some family members are having some bad health problems. And there was this girl that I was once close with about a month or more ago....anyway, she decided to ditch me and I got the chance to say what I felt like say today. Not a good sight..but oh well. FUCK IT! At least Sweet Child O' Mine is on the radio. This is pretty much my favorite song of all time. Why aren't I rich? I mean im not shit poor by any means...but why do those stuck up motherfuckers that live in places like Wakefield that have never had to really work for anything their entire lives get to buy whatever they want while I get to sit on this slow ass piece of shit all day with nothing to do but play music and look at the words people are too afraid to say to me. I haven't really touched a guitar in a week or so, and I keep getting porn in IMs. The guitar solo in Sweet Child O' Mine is on now. I love this solo. It's just...perfect. It starts off slow then that fast bit kicks in so perfectly. It just busts my nuts every time I hear it. I love it. It's funny, I said I was gonna quit all kinds of drugs...ever since then i've been doing more. AAAGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah...that's what I'm thinking right now. Pointless, meaningless, self centered horeshit. That's what I am...self-centered. I want want want want and want more. I hope my car gets fixed. My band is gonna make some copies of our originals we have recorded and are recording and release them. Isn't that spectacular? My dad is in the military. He's going off to war around Christmas time. But, we aren't really talking all that much. I'm so close to the point of breaking...

      So I wait and I take another breath. I wait out for this unexpected death. I can't understand this message for me. I don't understand the things that make me be. I just don't know what will happen when I die. I only imagine what's held behind your eyes.  Without love, will and hope will never last. Without pain, lessons learned will simply pass. I'm locked behind the door to eternity. I've been ripped apart internally.   To anyone else, they wouldn't understand. But, nothing really matters. Nothing ever lasts. No, nothing really matters.  But, here I am with an open heart, an open mind, and an open hand - to pick you up, to get you on your feet again.  A thousand questions go unanswered, But, I just can't seem to comprehend. Here goes my life that I have rendered, But these memories will never mend.  A million questions go unanswered. A million subjects go untouched. All for you I am rendered, But I will never be enough.

      I'm here again...listening to DREAM THEATER. Awesome shiznit. This guitar player, John Petrucci, is the 9th fastest guitarist in the world. He's so humble, too. What an inspirational guy. But he's not quite as inspiring as Jason Becker. Jason Becker is paralyzed. He has Lou Gherig's Disease, and he has this machine that he hooks himself up to and he spells out words with his eyes to he can communicate. But, he still remains in a positive state of mind and never puts anything down. Now that is an inspiration. He is one of the few guitar players that can play fast and still keep it beautiful sounding instead of just playing fast to play fast. His melodies are just...amazing. He's phenominal. He's really classically influenced. John Petrucci went to Berklee, though. Hells yeah...Anyway, so yeah...no one believes my Camaro is mine...even when I show them. I just don't get it.

      I got my driver's license today. Ain't I special? It's a lot different. There's more freedom, less pressure, and the urge to speed is hard to resist. But it's great...I can blast the stereo, rev up my engine at a stop light, speed up when someone's tries to pass, honk the horn for no reason over and over or just hold the horn down, etc. I'm sitting here enjoying my Dream Theater live 3-disc compilation while eating a Philadelphia Strawberry Cheesecake Snack Bar and drinking iced Pepsi...in a plastic cup. What else should I be? All apologies. Is a hairline fracture a fracture that runs through a line of hair? Monday was my birthday...happy birthday to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Eddie Vedder and his fellow gang members that make up Pearl Jam are currently on the radio. I'm going to go to the Berklee College of Music. What a goal huh? That's like saying I want to go to Juilliard....or Harvard or some shit. You know? Oh yeah...I'm starting a James Wrenn Future Guitar God Foundation where anyone who donates money to me can get a used guitar pick and an autograph. It will go towards a guitar, one of the many I have in mind of getting. A doubleneck guitar... obviously a guitar with 2 necks, a Gibson Les paul, a Jackson Randy Rhoads model guitar, the Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul, and the list goes on. This stuff adds up...especially those Les Pauls...you're lucky to find a good one of those under $1000. Anyway, yeah...feel free to donate all the money you want. If anything it's a good investment in my future. So....word. You know. It is time for me to head to my chamber for the rest of this fine...well...morning now. Later Haters

      Well well well....Monday was my birthday. There just happened to be fireworks on the 5th at my school...instead of the 4th. Like everything else, no one beleived it was my birthday. I bet I could tell people I'm an actual human being, and people wouldn't believe it. It's funny how things work out for the best. Or do they? It's funny how people take time to wait for something to happen, but in reality, you have to make things happen. It's also funny how when you're a little kid, adults tell you to have a lot of self confidence and determination. This builds up an ego. But, when you're older, everyone tells you to be modest and humble and not brag....and the confidence is beaten out of them. People tell you to dream when you're kid...then you finally find a dream and it's not the one thats "in your best interests." You know, July 5th was the day rock n' roll was supposedly invented. I was born on july 5th. Coincidence? If you think so...fuck you. Fuck off and die, if that's what you think. If you don't believe in me, don't fucking talk to me. I'm leaving...and when I come back...it'll be too late to be on my side. The difference between me and everyone else is....i'm one step ahead...When people see a chance, they see it as a chance to run and hide. I take my fucking chances...and that's how I'm getting out of here....on a chance. If you don't take the chance...you have that question stuck in your mind..."what if?" You're the one that will live with regret. The only problem is....I have to regret the fact that I can't change people's regret.

      ... has absolutely nothing to do with this post.  I got a Camaro the other day, but no one believes me...I don't get it. When I lie...I usually lie about something far fetched and totatlly unbelieveable just to see if I can convince someone of something really stupid. But, getting a Camaro isn't too far fetched. My birthday is Monday. Isn't that great? I have to learn 6 new songs for my band. The band, Vurvein, is going to have another show at the Louisburg Highschool Auditorium. The date isn't confirmed, but we're talking about Friday, August 13th. It'll be great. I get to do a guitar solo, there'll be a drum solo...Who knows, me and my drummer may switch off instruments for a song and do solos or something. We might even have a guitar competition. lol...good times huh? The songs will be more diverse styles of music, definitely. We're working on some modern rockin' stuff and some old country/southern rock stuff. All I can say is this show will be much more interesting and fun than the last one. Me and brandon made a deal that if I learned Mable's Fatal Fable on guitar, he'd learn it on drums. That's gonna take a good 2 weeks or more...depending on how much I work on it. Isn't that wonderful? It's extremely extremely complicated and dangerously fast. I need a challenge, though. Well good buddies....I'm out like George Bushes' presidency.

      Ahar I say. Hark! 4 score and 7 years ago. There was a man named Rufus. Uncle Rufus to be exact. In an attempt to save himself, he got saved. His voice became weak and his speech broke as he spoke to the Chosen One.  He quickly ran for the Florida Panhandle. After 7  long hours of vigorous walking, he began to hitchhike with the passing horse and buggies. And there he goes...on and on and on he goes...like dust in the wind.
