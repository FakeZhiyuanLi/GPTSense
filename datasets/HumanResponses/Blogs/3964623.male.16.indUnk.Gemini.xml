      well it's over between me and Kita i guess i wasn't ready for it and i was just shocked more than anything and confused i mean i thought that we had something going on i read her blog today and i came across somethings that shocked me i mean i read that this guy Xavier kissed her and she not kissed him back but didn't stop it and that made me feel well like crap and i dunno why and it's like i want to get mad and call her up and call her a chaeat but at the same time i am at fault to see there is this girl that i flirt with alot and sometimes i can't stop thinking about her and i feel i need her to just inwind and when i'm with her i miss markita and at the same time i want to be with her and it's so confusing and right now i need markita more i think if i could just sau good bye to her and hold her one last time at tell her i loved her i could moove on and not to mention my deab beat father is being a complete jack ass and just uhhh being a jerk like today my little brother called him to ask him if he was going to be able to pick him up and he was mad at him becuase he didn't call him and told him to wait till he was ready tp pick him up and hung up i mean he just says things with out thinking and it pissed me off i hate him ..... when he is like this i wish i was just in san antiono now to get out of this hell hole! I need a hug big time ! from who i really don't know ........................

       well time and who knows what else went on and ended my relationship with&nbsp; M . I was expecting it and at the same time i wasn't prepared for it i meani think alot has to do with other people telling US things and i also think that the long distant thing had alot to do with it i mean we trusted eachother but when she is like millions of miles away there is always a dought in your mind i mean i dunno i miss her so much and i think it would be easier if i could see her more often it would be easier to move on and i don't know if she left me for another guy or she just dosn't feel the same any more well i dinno and right now my dumb dad is acting up agian (whats new) and i could really use her here .............

       My dream as long as i can remember i have always been wanted to become famous i really do . Sometimes i can see my self out there singing onfront of thousands of people and having them sing my songs and having people comung to see me and cheering my name . I can't help but want it sooo bad that i can almost taste it ......Dreams are all that we have now and that is what we have to hold on to .....Don't you think? I like this poem that i heard on tv "never ever dought your dreams even when thier dosed in sorrow becuase even though they might seem far away they might come ture tomarow".......Keep Dreaming... that's why i do    I am enquiering to join the church choir but i really want to be alone in the game ....    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;God Bless!

        I know many people say that they have had a hard life but i can honestly say that i have . I mean since i can remember i never really got along with my dad we have never really seen eye to eye . He just seems to be insecure about himself and blind and not noticing how he hurts people . Especially me. I love him i mean he is my father i have to but that dosn't mean   that he can treat me like   dirt   you know ? I really think he has some sort of mental problem that he thinks evryone is out to get him and that everyone is his enemy. For some reason he has this anger twards me evrything i do seems to upset him for some odd reason he thinks i am   gay   . Which i am not i mean i can admit it i am not your macho jerk typical guy i know i am not that steotype person but i don't feel those things make a man a man . That is not how i was brought up but then agian i was brought up by women like when guys especially see me with girls all the time call me ugly names i just think poor them u know ? I mean why of all reasons would you want to spend time woth people your own sex that you don't like when you can spend the time with some one of the oppsite sex and get to have a relation ships ? He (My father) thinks my singing class and music is a waste of time and i should be something else u know but that is something that is near and dear to my heart and i honestly loooove doing and it hurts to think that he disaproves. I really don't know what his problem is . i feel as if i was alone and unworthy becuase i could do nothing tp pleese him you know i really am confused .........

      Today was the day that i knew was going to come at yet i was still shocked i still am i mean i saw him i saw him dead and touched his face  that one held  so much life and i was sureal like if it was a dream or something like i was looking at a wax figure . I saw him go under and i still am expecting to see him walking around the house and singing . God it's like the old saying goes "you don't know waht youve got till it's gone" and an't that the truth  I was so in shock that my grandma was such a trooper she really was i nver once saw her break down and just loose total control even when we had to say goodbye for the very last time she held it and managed to kiss him and smile . I love her so very much and i hope she dosn't stop living and rejoyce his life the pastor that gave the last rosary was so amazingly touching he said that he didn't die he went home and bye golly that's the ruth .well god bye abuelo te quiero por simpre!   In The loving memory of   Elmiliano Contreras Sr.  August 12,1920-August 12,2004     I love and miss you so much !   Love Sergitio

      well hi i just got back from vacation to finf that my grandfather died i knew it was going to happen but i wasn't expecting it if that makes any sense at all All last night i was just dreaming about him and thinking where he could be you know i know he went to heaven he was a great person with a big heart . Even though he seemed to be rough he was really like a big teddy bear at times He hoped the doors to me when everyone else shut them out he was the one who gave us a shelter and gave us food and love even though most of us couldn't see it we all loved him he was our family and we are all in some sate of shock the last time i saw him was right before we went on vacation he was in his hospital bed and he couldn't recognize me or my brother and he just looked so not therer you know i had never in my life seen someone so hanging on to life about to fall, and my grandmother was crying and i had never seen her cry like that before. I guess i understand her pain all though i really don't i mean that's the father of her children her soul mate just slipping away . All this makes me think about my father and what will happen to us in the near future i mean i love my dad but he is just so thick headed and can't undersatnd why i just can't stand sometimes and i sometimes wonder if it's my fault and if maybe i should just forget it but as much as i try i can't i mean all the stuff i just can' sweep it under the rug .......i dunno what i'm going to do i 'm just lost and to top it all off i miss M alot she is the only person who can calm me doen right now i just misss hearing from her i miss holding her................

      Its been one week since M broke up with me and i guess it hasn't hit me yet i mean i miss her alot and want to talk to her and now that i am single i am lost i feel like when uu play monopoly and it sends u back 3 spaces as corny as that sounds but it's the way i feel but i couldn't find another anallegy i was thinking about what we would have to face as we got older i mean being diffrent races has it's issues i mean my family(on my mom's side that  is ) couldn't care less about her race but i dinno how her fam is i mean i am not saying that they would say anything ethier but i dunno . I just miss her soo much and care for her alot i mean when i was looking for someone to come into my life and help me out and pick my feelings up i found no one so i stoped trying and she bounced up and came into my life it was amazing and now that she is gone i am lost without her and i know that sounds stupid and dumb but i mean it it;s like that song i used in the post called a long distant love " I don't want to hear that i'm too young to know it's love makes me  feel this way cuz i don't need to feel the heat of the sun to know it shines on me every day " and that's the way i feel but i dunno maybe it's just teenage hormones i dunno i just really confused as u can tell i guess i just wan to hold her and say good bye becuase i never got that chance ............................

      i got to thinking and i wrote a song about M :  Never going to be  It dosn't seem a second goes by that i don't think about u every night every night I try to forget you try to move on but no matter how hard i try i can't see beyond your beeming light i try so hard with all my might to kiss your memory away but once you love you don't stop we could have made it we could have stood up to the challange instead you wimped out over a stupid thing i miss your loving arms holding me tight each and every night i dream about you taking back all the horrible things youve said all the pain u put me threw  chours :  but that is never going to happen it's  never going to be Your never  come back but i'm never going to leave all that's left is heart breakand heart ache  and all ther's left is tears baby your never coming  back oh baby yeah  all ther's left is heart  break and tears that you said you'd kiss away I can remember me and you you and me kissing under the oak tree and dreaming our problems away i was there and you were there we were eachothers company What happend to those days when you said you loved me and we'd be able to lick any problem big or small (Oh bayby you said that) i wanted you here with me i thought that was our destiny !   Chours 2 X  It's never never never going to happen ........  oh baby you don't know what youve missed and is left is the memories when we kissed And i know that your going to miss me know when the world turns it's back and your all alone in this cold place we live in and your going to want me back but guess what  that's never going to happen thats never going to be ...         whay do u think ???
