      Ok, the Astros finally won last night.&nbsp; I am hoping that they will go on a tear over the next week so that the salary dumps won't happen at the trade deadline of July 31.&nbsp;   My wife and I are attending a marraige conference this weekend sponsored by  urlLink Family Life Today .&nbsp; I hope this won't be a waste of time.&nbsp; As a result of the conference, I am going to have to drive from College Station to San Antonio and back on Friday so that my kids can stay with my aunt.&nbsp; All in all, it looks like a very busy Friday.

      Well, I had an interview last week with the Attorney General of Texas, Child Support Division, Tyler.&nbsp; I hope to hear something soon.&nbsp;   As the interview was sandwiched between visits to my Grandfather in the hospital in San Antonio, I believe it went pretty well.&nbsp; After a long week of visiting relatives and negotiating hospital hallways, I am enjoying relaxing for a day or two this week.&nbsp;   A law firm in Tyler posted a job opening yesterday.&nbsp; I am still debating whether to apply for it or not as I really despise legal job interviews.   In other news, the Astros are playing as bad as I have seen them play in about 4 years.&nbsp; It looks like it may be time for this current team to be sold for parts.&nbsp;   On a more positive front, the Spurs resigned Manu Ginobili and Bruce Bowen.&nbsp; The Spurs also signed Brent Barry to be the first guard off of the bench.&nbsp; I am still a little concerned about the depth in the front court with Malik Rose being the primary backup at both the 4 and the 5.&nbsp; I am hoping that rumors that Malone may sign with the Spurs are just rumors intended to increase Malone's salary with some other team.&nbsp; Let's just say that I'm not a big Karl Malone fan.&nbsp;   Well, that's all for now.&nbsp; If anyone has a Gmail invite, I would appreciate a note.&nbsp; Thank.

      I am currently trying to obtain Texas statutes that I can download onto my Pocket PC.   urlLink Texas Statutes  has the statutes but none of the formats is readable on the Pocket PC.  The .pdf version doesn't fit the page at all and takes up a ton of memory.  The Html format is fine if you want to scroll the screen for every line.  Plus, I don't know enough HTML to change the font size.  The Word document format downloads an empty zip file.    So, I am poking around the web to find a good site with free legal statutes that I can carry around in my pocket.

      Ok, this is my lame attempt to obtain a Gmail account.  It seems that www.gmailswap.com is down.  No doubt having the site listed in the Wall Street Journal is increasing the page hits just slightly.  I am intrigued by the ability to have larger emails for pictures and work files sent to a large mailbox.  It seems that my tiny Cox cable mailbox only accepts up to 1 meg which is easily maxed out with ONE PICTURE.  That is unacceptable.    So if you have a gmail invite, please feel free to invite me or tell me how to contact you. Thanks.

      This is my first attempt at writing a blog.  I am trying to get a feel for this format and what kind of information that I want to share. :)
