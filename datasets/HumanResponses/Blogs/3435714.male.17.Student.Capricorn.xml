         The Resident Evil spoof script is now finished, & the whole thing will hopefully be shot on tuesday, if not this week, then next tuesday. for the sake of copy rights the name has been put as Occupant No Good instead of Resident Evil: The Gretna Outbreak. So as I said, if you know who i am, make sure you get in contact with me if you want to see this when it is finished.

         So lately, ive had a few friends, or a friend, who has turned into a major DICK. Most people just complain about him, or make dumb threats at him, but if he continues on his path, I may have to resort to...                VIGILANTE JUSTICE   Pretty much meaning, that if he keeps this up, i'll kick his ass back to new mexico... And that is what i call the darker side of good!

         Today was my last day as a junior in high school, but thats not the focus of my entry tonight. Neither is it that we finished the script to my movie. The focus is..... MY MOTHER!      Most days...I love her, other days (such as the last 2 weeks of my life) I either want to smash something (or someone in that case) or move out as soon as I can because of her. She has made my last to weeks into HELL!She was upset about my girlfriend & my actions. SO she has (at least what it seems to me as) pushed us almost to the brink of ending the whole thing, & if that were to happen, there would be hell to pay for a very very very long time. So for the last 2 weeks: Mom has been mad at me, My girlfriend has been mad at me (off and on), my girlfriends mom is mad about the whole thing, & my brothers are mad at me cuz im mad at them. Then here in the middle are me and my dad... 2 men against 3 women & 2 boys, Not even near being fair. Plus im working 2 to 10 every nite every week so im very tired along with this whole deal, not cool.

         Its official, Vince has joined our band. He'll take my place at lead guitar & i'll go to playing rythym(is that spelled correctly? oh who cares) guitar. Which in all honesty is the way I want it to be.   So thats wuts new...& theres not a whole lot goin on either, all i do anymore is work, hang w/ the band, practice for the band, & live the single life.   Meh.

        Tonight Josh and I were sittin around goin over some Bass stuff when he told me there is another guy in town who would like to join our band, his name is Vince, hes been playing guitar a little longer than I have, & he is a WHOLE LOT BETTER then I am. So we got to thinkin about talkin to him about joining.   And in recent updates, we're gonna change the name. To understand it better as a reader let me enlighten you on what we do as a group when were not practicing. Josh & I are very disturbed young men & we have a lot of pent up rage inside, so when we get together we usually break stuff, or take stuff, hurt ourselves or eachother in increadibly idiotic stunts, or get people pissed off at us. So Josh got to thinking and now we are gonna  change the name from "Under War Torn Skies" to "Deffient Youth."    So thats the recent band update. Enjoy.

         So, I was supposed to start a band with a couple friends of mine...but, it seems they're never gonna get their crap together. And I really want to be in a band just for the fun of it. So i got my friend Josh, my two brothers, & I together...and we're gonna be a band known as "Under War Torn Skies." I came up with the name, its from the whole Cold War period of history, when everyone & their dog feared nuclear death, & spy planes we're  tearing back & forth like crazy. The name has a lot to do with that.    The band will consist of Levi @ Lead Vocals, Ethan @ Drums, Me @ Guitar & growling, & last but not least Josh @ Bass & Backup Vocals. Knowing what my brothers & I listen to, plus adding in all the stuff that Josh listens to(mostly stuff I eventually end up liking cuz he plays it all the time) our band will be pretty heavy.   It will have a lot of influence from bands such as: Metallica, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, KoRn, Godsmack, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana, Static-X,  Seth Amens poetry, Levi's poetry, & our emotions.   So it should be pretty awesome, i'll post more updates as everything progresses, And as my closer before I end this journal: "Seth thank you so much for the inspirations, you truly have a hardcore heavy metal soul, i can see it in your writing, you have some serioussly wicked talent. Dont ever lose that, or let anyone or anything take it away from you, You are the Greatest my man."

      I sit here, alone in the dark, Wondering to myself, With the things Ive done, or have had done, or gone through. Do I feel? Am I affected by "emotions" Ive cared for people, ive hated people, ive missed people, ive even loved people. But, now this very second, do I feel "emotions" any longer? I wish the answer was as easy as Yes or No... I have run out of road, mentally & emotionally. I had one of those things I thought would last forever, But its gone now...Completely GONE! What will I do now? Will I srtive on? Become a recluse? Will I sease to exist? I will strive on, I have to & will. I will "Float On" as a certain song out now says. This perticular song has been my crutch for the last month.  "And We'll all float on ok,  Yeah We'll all float on ok,  And we'll all float on anyway." "Alright already well al float on,  Even if things get a bit to heavy well all float on ok."      Thats the chorus to the song Float On by Modest Mouse,      It means that things are gonna happen in your life      That are bad and you cant control that...      So you have the choice to let the thing rule you...      Or you remain cheerful and "float on"      I have decided to float on. Cause if 1 bad thing that happend in your life would cause it to end, Im sure 3/4 of us would have died a long time ago. So if this seemed as a pointless jumble of run-ons to you. And it has no uplifting value to you at ALL. Nwxt time your having a bad day, listen to Modest Mouses' song "FLOAT ON" and if your anything like me, it should cheer you up & bring some encouagement to you in a bad time.

      So, its 1:30 am,   Its saturday the 24th.  Im home, for a day, sort of.  I figured id mention about the trip i just   got done with.  Imagine this driving 1/2 way across the country with:  -The dad who is a pator, who occasionally looses his temper or gets confused easily  -The mom who is trying as hard as she can to hold the family together,  -The emotionally unstable brother who is ready to snap at any given moment     and takes refuge in his own mind (me)  -The blonde haired, blue eyed mac daddy with a 2 second attention span     and hates almost everything on the planet  -The hyperactive brother who is trying to grow up and be a kid at the same time  -The weird little sister, i mean weird  -The self centered, destructive, annoying cousin  -The cool math teacher aunt who could kick your and all your friends      butts with no problem  and finally  -The grudge holding angry grandmother.  So throw all that in a van and a camper and ship it half way across the country  Add a little rain 10 out of the 13 nights and what do you have?  MY FAMILY VACATION.  Now if you exscues me, i should get some sleep.  I have to be on a bus at 10:30 tonight to go to   Colorado for 2 weeks, then i come home  have a few days rest then........  Off to Soulstice: Christian concert super hang out.  So until august 17th or soish,  Dark Rocker

        SO my computers been down since 2 days after my last entry and sometime this afternoon i am going on vacation for a month. 2 weeks in New England, 2 weeks in Colorado, & 3 days in central nebraska. all back to back to back. So when the whole thing is done i will be very very very tired. A whole month of traveling plus when im in central nebraska i will be a t a series of concerts i'll be moshing, jumping, yelling, and if i feel stupid enough to attempt last years amazing stunt i'll go crowd surfing again, but i doubt that will happen. Just on a closing note,  My girlfriend and i broke up a month ago, and i've said and done some things in the last month that when im not still angry i'll be sorry about. So I would like to appologize on my blog not to bring attention to the  situation, but to show everyone who reads this that when you do stupid things out of anger you hurt people, so thats one of the reasons why im appologizing here.
