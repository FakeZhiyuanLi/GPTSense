      WEll mikes party was tonite, as was the last time I get to see annie for a long time. The party was very good. I kissed chow on the lips, it was funny. I had an awsome costume, so did annie. WE got mike really bad porn, lube, and a bunch of stuff from the dollar store to make him laugh. It worked. Im really going to miss annie and im going to do my damnedest to keep fateful to her. I cant even begin to imagine betraying her like that. So i think ill do ok.

      Well then, all was going to roll smoothly for tomorrow if not for my over reacting close minded parents. They cant even begin to imagine me as my own person it seems. I want to dress diffrent because i feel differnrt. I want to stand out because i always do anyways. I dont know why sociaty has to hate the change and the fu that young people bring with them. Annie's mom wasn't posioned by it why are my parents? I like the coulor pink, they call me gay, i defend myself, nothing i say can sway them. WTF! Why cant they be accepting of who i am rather then negitive and angry about what i do to express myself. Aw well.

      Well my plans almost worked. Me and Annie met, we had a fun afternoon and saw Alien VS. Predador. It was good. I got a size 10 in kids t shirt for my goth costume. Its gonna be awsome, we got lots of safty pins cuz there hardcore. Me and Annie had a fun evening,  It ended in me falling asleep... Again. I didnt end up going out with my friends and getting drunk because i ws too damn sleepy... I fell asleep the first time at 8:30 I think. Well, plans where not followed but how is that any diffrent then usual.  So as far as a quote of the day, while swe where entewring the movie theatre we heard a man say to his child "No, you cant have any. They dont make ice cream with beans" so we found it amusing. Also i was mauling Annie infront of the theatre and someone yelled get a room. It was fun. All in all yesterday was pretty good. I wish i had have had the energy to go drinking though. Oh well too bad, ill make up for it in college.

Oh ya I picked up a shift for 7am till 11pm, woot i guess... Anyways i get to see her thats all that matters. Work tonite was pretty good, im gonna miss that gang. There pretty cool. Especially all the hot servers and bakery girls. Ill miss them all even the cooks that make fun of me. So ya I've had a fdun filled summer of work and Annie, mostly work and not near enough Annie.

      Another day in my life, Nothing really new. I gotta work tonite at 5 so im going in a few hours early so i can skateboard, cash my check and get some supplies for school. My mom made me do a bunch of cleaning today, it sucked. I think im gonna swing by my girlfriends house after work and hang out. It will be good. We are so right for eachother and i dont know what kind of strain my leaving for college will put on us. One of my good friends had this happen to him and it ended badly because he loved her, but as a guy, it was too hard to pass up casual sex. I really hope i dont run into that problem. I really love my Annie and dont want to lose her over some pretty girl that wants to get her freak on with me. Awe well i guess only time will tell. Anyways im gonna go play Nintendo.

      Well i seem to be off to a pretty huge fucking start. Like im posting way to much. I mean, if i had something better to do you know id do it. I miss my friend ashley. We are not going to see eachother for a long while likely. The longest we've ever gone was like 2 weeks. man im gonna miss her. Same with my girlfriend Annie. Shes so awsome and cool and in yo face lol. She's staying behind in dirt town AKA Orillia. Im leaving a lot of friends here and it really kinda sucks. Hopefully ill meet some really cool people in my rez. Anyways this week should be fun, after working 55-65 hour weeks i finally have the last week before i leave off. So far i got some pretty decent plans, gonna hook up with Annie on monday after work, tuesday im gonna party, one day will be devoted to Ashley. Hopefully ill get to Rift. (table top RPG i play, It will be explained at a later date) and thursday i have a party for my friend mike with a goth/rockstar theme. Me and Annie gave him the idea. so ya im excited. Hopefully it will be more interesting then today was. If not, expect to see a shit load of posts again tomorrow.

      Well i guess Ian was right in telling me to start this i do have a lot of things to say and to do and to learn. I guess i should fill in those who dont know me what I am all about besides the things in my profile. Im a boy and i like pink but i like like girls too. Really i like the coulor pink and i really dont see the big deal if i wear it now and again. I like loud heavy music, i figured even though thats in my profile id mention it anyways.  I like to draw and play video games. I guess i could learn to enjoy blogging. Im really excited to be going to college i start classes on the 23rd of August. Well that about sums it up for now. Ill keep you posted lol.  Vincent

      Jezz, if i was just a bit more lazy, this would not be writen right now. See, my buddy Ian was all like "do you have a site?" and i was like "no" so he was like "well get one" and i was like "too lazy to learn html" so he gave me this site repeatedly untill i went through with it. My spellings reallly bad and i think blogs are lame so this is gonna be a pretty fucking sorry excuse for a blog. So ya i guess this is the part where i say what i did today. WEll i eat some meat, it was good. i play some old school nes. I was playing Ice hockey and i beat the USA witrh the Canadian team 17 to 4. Take that bitches! so ya then i did this, and for that i am sorry  Intergalaticly yours Vincent
