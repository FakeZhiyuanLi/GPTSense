      I just couldn't resist.  I visited a co-worker's desk just now, and he was not there, but his dry erase board was.  On it was a checklist of things to do.  So I had to add something.  What came to me at the spur of the moment?  "Save the princess (she's in another castle)."

      The government-implanted microchip in my brain has instructed me to start a blog.  I am typing this first paragraph against my will.  The rest will be my own words, or so the microchip says.  It doesn't know about the demon squirrel on my shoulder that will likely dictate the rest.  (chitter chatter, chitter chatter... No, I'm not going to write about the merits of the hazelnut.  This is my blog, dammit.)  Ahem, where was I.  Hmmm... don't understand that first paragraph... demon squirrel, yada yada, okay.  I've decided to try my hand at this blogging thing.  My first instinct was to come up with some sort of cool theme for my blog.  There's all sorts of stuff I'm interested in -- games, computers, movies, politics, religion -- there could be some good discussions there (ignoring, of course, the "omg u r lame" that would be sure to follow if I admitted to liking any one particular thing).  Then I thought of doing a themed humor blog.  You know, making fun of office politics (I work in an environment that can best be described by reading Dilbert), creating my own political party (donations are being taken for my Enslave the Elderly program as we speak), or even going out on a limb and pretending to be a angst-ridden teenage terrorist (don't ask).  Then I remembered my college days.  I worked in a computer lab for some spending money, and basically most of my time was spent sitting at the computer doing jack squat (which I still do, only I work for large company and get paid much more to do it).  So I started an e-mail newsletter that I'd send to all my friends.  I'd compose it throughout my time in the lab, with whatever random ramblings would pop into my head.  And believe me, there were plenty.  So that's what this is (or will be).  An incoherent set of completely unrelated posts.  There will be no wallowing in misery, nor sharing every detail of my life, nor any great insights into the world around us or the meaning of life (besides, it's 42, we already know that).  It's really just going to be a big steaming pile of brain drippings, the overflow from an underworked mind.  I hope they'll entertain or stimulate somehow, but I'd be lying if I said I cared.  And as far as that goes, this may be the very last post.  This wouldn't be the first thing I ever started that I didn't fin...  (And yes, I use parentheses a lot.  (And I mean a lot.))
