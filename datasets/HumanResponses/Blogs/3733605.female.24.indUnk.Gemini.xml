       urlLink     Okay so whats the deal?  I live very close to d.c.  And I have yet to find the atmosphere of Sex and the City! Most girls want that, three friends that are all totally different yet alike.  Who are individuals and respect each others thoughts! Do i find this here in D.C... noooo.. Ofcourse I guess I can't blame everyone for me not getting out. I stay on this machine to dang much. But still where is that, where is my Cosmopolitan?  Theres not alot of females out there u can trust. Most are backstabbers, or they just don't really care. Its hard to find friends who actually look out for you, who actually care about what you've got to say.  I've got acouple I kinda trust..but you never know how quickly that can change.  Do men have these problems?  I doubt it, they sit on the couch with their friends and play Playstation and Xbox all day. There's no need for drama.. they barely even speak. Only to cheer in victory over a defeated foe. Their lives  are so easy! They never loose friends, cause they frankly don't get emotional. .. I guess thats something to try... anyone for a game of Super Smash Brothers??

       urlLink    Wendy's Big Mistake&nbsp; urlLink     Lets see.. I'm still on vacation today and I did nothing, okay I'm talking about Thursday even though I'm writing this Early Friday morning.  I ate write since I had to go weigh in. Yeah I'm on Weight Watchers I might not look like I need it but I've come along way baby. Anyway.. I tried to eat little so that I would weigh in good.  Well I did, weigh-in worked well.  After that I went to Wendy's Yeah Whats that about?? Theres no point in eating right the whole week, and after knowing you did well, go out and get a Bacon Cheeseburger, fries, and lemonade that was horrible!! I also went to Wegman's and got 1 slice of Cheesecake.. I'm so horrible. I'm going out for sushi this weekend.  Hopefully I'll do better tomorrow.. what a waste of eating right the whole week.

      I can't talk to you right now. As much as I would like to I can't.&nbsp; I'm realizing all the wrong that I've done in my lfe&nbsp;and now I'm figuring it out whats right. And although talking to you might be okay. I have to make sure.&nbsp; I'm sorry I can't talk to you. I'm at home sitting alone wondering what is right. I'm here. I hear you.. I just can't answer..my mouth is afraid too talk&nbsp;and so I sit and stare wondering when I will find the right answer. I'm sorry..&nbsp; forgive me.. I'm hoping I can find the answer soon..and I'm hoping the answer is a good one.. but I'm beginning to think it isnt.. I dont know if you'll understand.. but maybe once I do I can explain it.&nbsp;... My heart pounds with fear.. I'm not sure of anything anymore.. I question it all..yet I try to follow it all..I have to free my mind. I can't talk to you right now.. hopefully soon,&nbsp; and hopefully not never again.. melodies..

      Romans 12:1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God – this is your spiritual act of worship. (2) Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is – his good, pleasing and perfect will.

       urlLink    Okay so it's late at night, on the fourth of July, well i guess it's the 5th now. Today was pretty boring, I didnt do much of anything but sleep, good thing this weekend I did was I finally bought a coffee table..it was light colored and big.. beautiful table, althought I hate that its light! I have some pics coming soon.. well the plan is to sand it and then stain it really really dark.. well I dont know how thats going to turn out.. I'll let you know how it turns out.. Well anyway this is a bummy pic of me with my scarf on my head.. I wrap my hair everynight, so that it doesnt get all tangly.. its so humid here, and its been raining alot! I ate cookies today as well as candy Hot tamales. Nothing deep to say today.. My toess need new nail polish. My legs need to be shaved. I need a facial. I feel sticky.

       urlLink    Okay so for all of you who know, I finally got my laptop about two weeks ago. I tried to get it through BestBuy through their customized computers. But after hp shipped it apparently FedEx lost it in China. BestBuy did not try to compensat me and a month went by. I eventually cancelled the order and ordered my laptop directly from HP. It consist of HP Pavilion ZX5000 Pentium 4 3.0 HT 512 MB 128 ATI 9600 Graphics Card. 54g Wireless Lan B/G and Bluetooth. CDRW, 3 USB 1 Firewire. 5 in 1 media reader. With harman kardon speakers. A big review will come later. But as for now.. I can say its a great laptop the touch is a little hard to use. The biggest problem...this thing is hot.. and battery life sucks! I mean truly is horrible..keep this thing plugged up. For me since I use it at home most of the time its okay.. but I havent taken it out the house yet. Full review coming later. Happy Friday!
