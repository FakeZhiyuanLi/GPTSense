      margie is a girl i met at the broadway cafe a month or so ago. she has yellow and brown dreadlocks, a sharp face, and always wears the same pants stitched up with patches proclaiming animal, environmental, civil, gay, etc rights. she can roll a cigarette in 3 seconds flat, and she lives in a little apartment on valentine with a single picture of an african mountain gorilla on the wall, like a shrine. we have decided to tree-sit together in california, and possibly trek the 4 month hike up the appalachian trail.  i have a huge crush.   she lives on love street lingers long on love street she has a house and garden i would like to see what happens la la la lalalala  canvassing mopirg (public interest research group) in brookside was great -- everyone leans left and supports any environmental issue you throw at them. and it was home turf for me. i sat in the st. teresa's quad to smoke a cigarette, just to get a kick about doing something that would get me expelled in 2 months.

      camping was wonderful, from what i remember. saturday elise and i cooked vegan stew. everyone huddled around the fire playing an intense game of "i never" and getting wasted on cheap boxed franzia and boone's. we took it down to the waterside for "spin the bottle." sarah, mo, mike, brian, and i headed over to the adjacent campsite at 2:00 in the morning to party with iowan boys, and while waiting for sarah to finish making out with one of them (kyle?) in the backseat of his lesabre, i had stoned political debate until 5:00. the next morning i woke at 9:00, drove around with kyle on country backroads and through the various north 1st streets of small towns passing a one-hitter back and forth.  copasetic.  last night was not so pleasant. i stopped by broadway to fill my empty stomach with black coffee and catch up with some friends, wandered around westport for a while (grateful to be back in the city), headed over to passages. who should be there than ava martin, dressed in her usual black boots, army jacket, plugs--the epitome of a heartless dyke. as usual she had 10 different phone numbers scribbled on her forearm, half of them made up for the image.   she drags me off on a walk to the church parking lot, procedes to tell me all the details of her latest fuck buddy, and then says  " kate, let's fuck. " " excuse me? " " let's fuck. right here. why not? "  bends over and starts to kiss me as if i'm going to lay myself out on the pavement at her feet. i run back in and we start to argue about jasmine, ava of course tossing around her usual slew of lies and claims  " i'll bet you $100 i can get into her pants by the end of next month. "  how absolutely despicable can you be? i ended up in the shotgun of molly's car, listening to "gravel" and crying at my own naivety. i give her chance after chance to prove me right, that deep down there is genuine love and goodness inside of her, and every time she lets me down. i can't help trusting in people. i can't help my optimism, and it plagues me sometimes . . . i need to get away from her. she's self-destructive and she's a threat to every relationship i value. i hadn't been angry for years, but last night i felt like slamming my fist through the apartment wall.  i can't let it happen again. i don't know why i keep giving her second chances.  peace

      today i saw a frog on my driveway with his guts spilling out of his belly--stomach and intestines slung to the side in this sticky yellow heap. i touched his neck only to realize he was still alive. i hate seeing little things suffer like that.  this is the first i've been in kansas city for a few weeks, after the accident. i have some chores to do: swing by the sierra club to pick up my check, buy a bike, catch up with the broadway cafe folks and maybe smoke a few cigarettes in the rain. it feels good to be active again. i haven't been living much the past few days, just existing in a haze of day-time talk shows . . . tons of seeded watermelon . . . sleep. yesterday i managed to drag myself from the couch and write a new song (healthy, because i hadn't done anything remotely creative in days)  pretty girl when we will learn that the world won't do anything without something in return  and i ask how hard can it be to love without boundaries? i've seen a war that's been going on strong for the last 50 years and it tells us exactly what we believe now we belong in the pictures of beautiful women in magazines  with the shapes of our fears  and i say, pretty girl, reassure me that i don't have to be lovely to be loved so tell me the difference between d.c. and baghdad and that we've been told the truth, that there is proof that a child half the world away playing with dolls is inherently evil and can only grow up to blow up in our backyards this is who we take our freedom from whoa in a nation where corporations decide the vote  and most people go through life trying not to rock the boat but i think as long as there are children, pretty girl, we're okay as long as the sun recedes, leaves its light upon your face  so tell me you love me, give me something to believe  tell me there's love that exists, love without boundaries  whoa  can you guess who the pretty girl is? i have mixed feelings about this invisible grip she has on me. after london, it's nice to have a crush . . . but god knows it'll get me nowhere. i'm so inconstant and she's heartbroken.  peace

      jamie&nbsp;is a girl i met at the broadway cafe a couple of months ago. she has a dirty blond mohawk that always seems to fall forward into her eyes,&nbsp;and a&nbsp;cute septum piercing. she is tall and thin and punky and absolutely beautiful. she recites ani difranco lyrics at the poetry readings we go to, and i can&nbsp;never quite figure why such a&nbsp;gorgeous girl would have a thing for me, but she does. she too has been subjected to ava's lies and parental nagging and societal bullshit. things are going wonderfully, except that neither of us can come out and say "i like you." how totally 6th grade, man. so for now we have cheek pecks and little smiles and drunken parties and&nbsp;ken pushing our bodies closer to one another.  when&nbsp;i say those difficult 3 words, maybe we'll have a . . .  . . .  Relationship. *gasp*

      my apprehensions about going to college, selling out for some business career, and living the rest of my young life in middle-class, conservative,&nbsp;suburban comfort have been assuaged by one word:  &nbsp;  berkeley.  &nbsp;  the atmosphere is incredible. the historic political and social consciousness embodied by berkeley students is&nbsp;without a doubt  extraordinary . both&nbsp;the film school and the department of environmental studies are top-notch.&nbsp; there is an entire dorm for LGBT students. not to mention that california is a fucking hippie/guppie zion.  &nbsp;  i'm going to dedicate my entire senior year to getting in. i will pour over kaplan sat books, i will submit thousands of independent scholarship essays, and i will burn the one bra i have left.  &nbsp;  jasmine and ava are together (what the fuck?) jamie and george have been calling me non-stop (i'm giddy) joy is fitting the pieces of her life back together (good for her) my debts have been paid off (thankfully) and the united states public interest research group has a director position in cali just waiting for me just waiting until graduation (remarkably wonderful)  &nbsp;  nothing left to do now but kick back and chug cough syrup: all these midwestern stresses and excitements have been taking a toll on my health.  &nbsp;  or maybe it's philip morris.  &nbsp;  or the mercury pollution.  &nbsp;  peace

      i've been doing alot of performance readings lately, anywhere from jacob's house to jilly's to allen's place (in respective order of pretentious-bastard-ness). it's good for me, to actually write again. college applications are hovering over me like anxious vampire bats, i can't decide between english film or environmental studies and more often now i find myself saddened instead of invigorated&nbsp;by change.  &nbsp;  so poetry is a nice distraction.  &nbsp;  i am i and the world will continue to twirl in geometric sufi-dance when i  am dead, long gone from the fresh fruit of this world like some dusty smithsonian  artifact  i can point out all the places where my  callow lungs sucked THC, hearts ignited with  pleasure &amp; passion &amp; yellowed-young bliss as lovers covet the  Revolution &amp; we always end up in these certain parks beneath the same rotting trees  gazing onyx eyes for missed details in same old photographs of ex-girlfriends  (we are, of course, a wistful generation) but  pass the joint, man, and it'll all be okay  kansas city i will look toward the trees  throw head back and revel in soft madness that consumes  each of us eventually  passing thru platte county, god's country littered with  thick billboard fonts for hamburgers -- rotten cow fleshes violently settling into  fat-packed american bellies  in the arbys, two married men are feeling the forbidden roughness of  one another's kneecaps beneath the tabletop billboards,  more billboards for beer  condoms extra-lubed ribbed for her pleasure as if this is a RADICAL  idea of female satisfaction.  somewhere in platte county they are building a power plant to keep lamps clicking  on / off MTV blaring white noises on a  black, breathless god.  somewhere in platte county they are building a power plant to vomit smoke  from its great iron mouths:  carbon monoxide  sulfur dioxide  mercury to find flight unrelentlessly into  serpentine midwestern streams  settle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violently into the muscles of tuna thrashing in net of edwardo  rodriguez to make nice juicy  sandwich for pretty daughter maria (with no idea  how deep tommy's semen could sneak up inside&nbsp;towards life and)  &nbsp;  just like that the fuckin  MESSIAH  is abandoned in a pool of venusian blood tears relief in form of sighs  thank god  thank god  thank god, oh tell me that  your life has more direction  straight and narrowed.  &nbsp;  we are the musicmakers  i am we . . .  &nbsp;  ( to be continued) &nbsp; edit: the problem is that i spread myself too thin. i want so many things to happen in my life; i have so many (too many?) aspirations. i've been especially concerned about choosing a major. i want to reach people, and i think the easiest and most accessible form is through film. &nbsp;

      saturday, july 3, 2004 11:04 am cigarettes smoked since 9 am: 7 (i'm going to kill myself at this rate) vegan food in kitchen: one half-filled jar of peanut butter, diet coke, wheat bread (memo: make sandwich)  i'm sitting in my apartment, staring out the window at my lovely view of brickwall and waiting for my only pair of clothes to hang dry. the plaza bells are going off in a disney theme--cinderella, i think. i'm beginning to really love kansas city, enough to come back every summer or so. yesterday was first friday and the opening of my anarchist friends' radical bookstore. i bought a $4 book about deschooling/deinstitutionalizing society, picked up dozens of leaflets about overthrowing capitalism, and went swimming around in the thick mud with mary. i saw fahrenheit 9/11 - again - and bawled - again. my life has been a constant daze of parties and smoking and sleeping and poetry readings and smoking and environmental rallies and anti-war protests and free tibet press conferences and smoking and parties and working and sleeping.  just the way i like it.  there are a few new girls in my life (just the way i like it). george is 18, but acts like a full-blossomed 30 year old. she's a comedian, but not as eccentric as a.j. or nick or dustin. we have not slept together yet: she refuses to, because she says it's unusual for her to really  like  somebody and she doesn't want our "relationship" to end up as a one-night stand. relationship. ha. sometimes her stability scares me, rightfully so, but for now we have quick mouth-kisses and spooning all-night-long and obvious flirtations across the bars and it's all very nice.  more later, my loves and lovers  peace

      we starve, look to one another short of breath walking proudly in our winter coats wearing smells from laboratories  facing a dying nation  of moving paper fantasies, listening to the new-told lies with supreme visions of lonely tunes somewhere inside of something there's a rush of greatness who knows what lies in front of our lives i fashion my future on films in space silence tells me secretly everything everything  let the sun shine let the sun shine in the sun shine in

      i'm reveling in the newfound joy of finally having a library card. this means all of humanity's intellect and imagination at my fingertips - for those of you without one, i really recommend it. in the past few days i've blazed through a few particularly good ones, and always finish with a redefined sense of purpose. "i need to tree-sit." "i need to travel around the country." "i need to start a revolution." oh, i just   have   to, there's no choice or desire about it.  "the legacy of luna" - julia butterfly hill "junky" - william s. burroughs "to america with love: letters from the underground" - anita & abbie hoffman "che guevara: a biography" "deinstitutionalizing society"  i ranted for hours after finishing  luna : the blind ignorance of capitalists still astonishes me. with all i've experienced and heard about and read, you'd think i'd be a cynic, but i don't think i'll ever get over this naive, eternal-optimist nature-loving-peace-spreading stage. and that's exactly the way i'd like to remain.  i need to feel pavement beneath my feet. i need to get out on the road and shake things up, change things at their most primitive levels. with each radical book i read, i feel my insides start pounding with restlessness. i gotta get out there to where the action will be. and if that means postponing (or cancelling?) higher education, so be it. i think when the time comes i'll know what i need to do. i've got a year to lay around and flip through books and eat soy nuts and watch south park.  then the people will rise up!  haha  peace
