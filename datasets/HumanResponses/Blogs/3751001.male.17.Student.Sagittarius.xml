      Yo its me again, i've playing around with PHP a bit and i've made a slightly varied version of the index page which happens to have the current date at the bottom. The link is http://www.atrocty.com/index.php so have a look if you want, i'm gonna try and find some decent tutorials and learn to make a more useful site.  My other site updates are to the forum, i've added some more skins which you can change in your profile control panel, i've yet to do any modifications to them but i will do over the next few weeks so watch this space!  Thats it for now, i'll update hopefully by tuesday again.  ~Atrocity

      Because of problems involving our old blog, which was hosted by angelfire we have decided to create a new blog. The new blog will be used by all members of the team who work with or on the main site. When a team member posts their web name will be posted somewhere among the main text, in my case i've placed mine in the title in brackets.  Anyway for now that's all i have to say, until next time cheerio!

      Hello again, a faceless geek writes again in the grim hope that someone may read this. I'm ok today, I think i'm ok but knowing me I will probably miserable by later today. Today i'm going to talk about my freinds, or rather lack of them.  A "freind" holds much significance for me just like finding a partner. Freinds are people I trust more then my own family, a freind to me is someone i look up to and listen to. My freinds are fascinating people, many are unhappy and troubled much like myself and this makes me feel more like a normal person and not "Mr Unlucky", to me this binds us together.  As a Introvert i have found it very difficult to reveal my inner thoughts, i could blame this for my failings in School. I've seen the death of a member of my family which was sudden and shocking, the death occurred in the october holiday of 2000 and i was back at school on the first day back.  I managed to tell one person of this death, they did not know how to respond, they thought i was joking. Over the next few weeks people began to find out, unable to cry i unleashed my pain in the form of anger - one of my great flaws.  Today i only see anger as a way of relieving the pain of something, i hate it but i've accepted it as part of me and hopefully my freinds who are normally at the recieving end of it do also. My life has not been brilliant, much of it remains a secret and will do for the rest of my days on Earth.  I really hate secrets, there a nasty thing to contain and for some reason people share theirs with me but i cannot with them. I've revealed secrets but these secrets have been used against me by who i considered "freinds". If your reading this i do hope you can forgive yourself.  I will never share anyone elses secrets, i'm a person who values trust and i should set an example if others dont. I'm a quiet guy most of the time, i enjoy my own company but i do enjoy going out with freinds places, if only they came out more often...  Anyways, enough of this depressing rant. I've got two years of further education ahead of me, i'm going to meet new freinds at college who hopefully i will value more then previous ones. This year has been quite a troubling one for me as i've noticed i have not many freinds, i've learnt more about myself but i need to do more. I need to save myself from myself.  ~Atrocity

      The curse that is summer holiday boredom is now in control, despite enjoying meeting my online buddies Chris and Vix i'm now again bored. Hopefully next week i'll be going to Nottingham with Vix and maybe some others, i'm also awaiting the return of Jonny from Italy so i can begin my "mission" *winks*. When i'm bored i become very moody and take it out on others, normally its Riktard but because he's on holiday (hes Jonny's brother) i've been lashing out at random people for no apparent reason, and i don't like what i do :-(. There is another thing troubling me at the moment - love - a concept i've had little experience with in my near 18 years on this planet. Alot of people i know are finding people and are happily in love and until now i've wondered whats the fuss with the opposite sex. I DO like someone, i really do like this person i'm sure most of you can guess if you know me including her. They is several main reasons for liking her; shes patient and understanding, she's beautiful and most importantly i can trust her which is rare for anyone in this world.  She knows who she is.... I love her.  ~Atrocity

      Too long!  Just to let you know i'm still alive, i've been having some personal problems in the past few weeks but i'm back stronger and better then ever. My only problem now is some stomach bug which is stopping me eat properly (i ate nothing one day!).  Anyways the week has been relatively boring except for a visit to town to see my online buddies Chris and Vix, i've met Chris before at riktards birthday party but i've only known Vix through talking on msn and i was shocked at how different she looked from her photo (its a good sort of difference).  Well everything turned out fine, both are really nice people and i can get along with them without effort. I didn't get round to buying anything, Chris has no money (poor guy) and Vix was splashing out on allsorts of CDs and DVDs (i think).  About two hours were spent talking on a bench, Chris left and me and Vix talked for a while again I could easily talk to her even without Chris's dominating presence.   Guys I love you both!  As for the site well things have been fairly ok, we've had a bit of activity but nothing worthy of mention (i'm not a millionaire yet!). I really need to learn PHP but its proving a nightmare, i've also been making lots of digital images with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. My photoshop work is availiable for viewing on my website;   urlLink http://www.atrocty.com/images  and some freinds work is in  urlLink http://www.atrocty.com/fanart   Well it's the summer holiday, over six weeks of boredom! I'm gonna be home alone for a few days while my mother and brother go on holiday to someplace i don't know about. Of course like any good honest teenager i will not be having wild parties, and getting pissed *rolls eyes* hehe.  Currently listening to :: Rasmus - Guilty Current mood :: Happier but not super happy, probably because of meeting my freinds. Quote&nbsp;of the week :: "Bangin Blazin Squad" - Vix, taking the piss out of townie filth. Fed up with :: This illness, I want to eat!!!! Loving :: My freinds, i adore them. Currently in production :: Bon Jovi Vs Atrocity cartoon saga.  Oh well thats it for now!  ~Atrocity

      Anyway they is little news from atrocty towers, the site has gone through another period of updating mainly because I had to delete the large image files which were taking up half of my availiable space. Anyway as you know I dropped out of my college course and i've finally sorted out an interview for next year, I intend to do graphic design but you shouldn't worry as they will be plenty of fresh updates next year.  Currently listening to :: Metallica - Four Horsemen  Currently in production :: Nothing, cuz i'm a lazy bugger :D :P

      Like most other honest and law obiding members of Britain's youth i'm sick to death of the crime which is rife in cities and suburbs. Over the past few years a group of teenage yobs have been bred as the result of poor parenting and lack of discipline. The so called "Townies" recognised by their uniform of tracksuits, carbrini hoodies, burberry caps and thick fake gold jewellry known as "bling" are a public menace that could easily be stopped if they was some form of effective laws in this country. Because of this plague on our streets myself and others have decided to form a group to combat townies (also known as Chavs, Kevs, Scallies, Neds and Charvers) if you want to know more then join the forum and post your queries. Townies should be warned of GOATs (Guild Of Anti Townies).

      Hello again, sorry about the lack of updates but its been four very wierd days.  As you know last saturday my family went off on holiday somewhere, dunno where, dont really care but anyways, lets go through each day;  Saturday : Got newspapers, went on computer talked to my wonderful freinds online. Sunday : Pretty much the same, were gonna go to town with Jonny, Sarah and Vix :-( . Monday : Aha! Finally socialising, bit of gaming and watching of dvds while rock music ripped through the tv speakers, spent good part of the day hugging vix on the sofa. Tuesday : Four of us go to town, look around, sit on a bench, more vix cradling and stuff, my quest to find a pirate flag also failed :'( oh well...  So that was the week, monday and tuesday have tired me out, i've experienced alot of emotional changes over the four days in total, i was angry and scared saturday and sunday, calm and worried on monday and very relaxed tuesday.  I'm happy at the moment but also in a wierd dreamy state, something wonderful happened to me and others around me are happy too. I also feel loved, by the girl I love the most.

      Tis me, the guy with a stupid name.  Well as saturday draws nearer I get more excited, yesterday I went to see some relatives :( but I was glad to be home again. Anyways logged on msn and had a funny conversation with Vix and Sarah (I won't go into detail, was rather erm sexual).  I heard sad news that the only copy of halo has been seriously scratched and so we have no halo to play (unless... nah) but we have plenty of games still t'which is good, i'll need to invest in some food for the party and we have no reliable supplier of beer :'( so i guess we are gonna be sober zat day.  My recent productions have included a new desktop background which i've been editing quite a bit, i've also made a new signature for myself and matching avatar, the new one isn't amazing but its good enough.  Well thats it for this brief and irrelevant post.  Currently listening to :: Music duh (jk i'm listening to New Found Glory) Currently in production :: Little if anything  ~ Atrocity

      Hello you horrible lot (joking :P i love you really!),  Its your humble, long haired Derbyshire oddity again, so far i've managed to buy two newspapers this morning (wow go me!) and now i'm online again. As i'm bored i'd thought i'd write some random crap.  I can't wait until the big day when my wonderful family bugger off on holiday for a couple of days leaving me in command :D. So far i've got a gaming party planned, so far i've got Jonny, Sarah, Chris, Chaz and Vix coming along with a couple of game machines all wired into two TVs.  That should be occurring next monday or tuesday, before that on sunday though i'm off to the city centre, i'm trying to find a pirate flag and some form of t-shirt, also it will give me the opportunity to see some of my freinds again :D.  As for the site well it's ok, so far its generated about £5:00 in revenue from advertisements and other sources, i really need to actually put some content on the site though, the forum is the only completed part of the site.  I'm gonna get the "Bon Jovi saga" completed soon, its been in planning for weeks, i'm also awaiting a few comic strips of people and i would greatly appreciate any other work from anyone.  Currently listening to :: Iron maiden - Bring your daughter to the slaughter Currently making :: Random shite with photoshop and paint Favourite thing at the moment :: My freinds!!!  ~atrocity

      Hello again, tis me.  Looking at the website i've noticed what a big pile of shite it is, i should really put some content on the site to make it worth people visiting. Site visits are fairly ok but people dont stay or join the forum, the google ads have made me almost £5 so far which is good.  Basically could you please gimme some ideas of what to do with it?  This week should be pretty good, the roof problem is now fixed (official now as of this morning) a hell of alot of people are returning from holidays and they is now exactly a week before my mother and bro jet off on their holidays, leaving me alone :D  I will be dragging people and their stuff around the house of Atrocity and hopefully do something of some interest. Next saturday i'm probably seeing Jonny (back of holiday) along with hopefully Vix and Sarah, i'm not sure what we are up to.  I'm quite happy now, my desire for love goes on but its well under control and besides alot of people need me at this time which is cool but also important as i do love them alot ;-) . Responsibility is something i'm afraid of put i reckon its gonna slap me in the face and i'm gonna have to face it and take it on, who knows i could be a manager or leader in years time :S

      The past few days have been pretty alright, yesterday i went off to town on my own for the first time in weeks (blame my increasing social life). I went to sort out the problems with my bank card and the woman said that a replacement will be sent out with all money intact :D .  My next bout of happiness comes with the end of the saga which has been troubling my wonderful family for many weeks/months. The guy came and fixed the loose roof slates and plastered my cieling again, still they was a leak. Second time he looked at the tank in the loft, still a leak and now he has finally found the problem :D .  I decided to have a look in the loft for the first time in my life, the roof is very low and you just about crawl around like a rat, its also surprisingly warm because of our decent insulation. He explained what was up, i understood, my mother did not :P .  Alot of people I know are on holiday with the exception of Vix and Chris, my mother and brother are going away somewhere very shortly which is definate as the leak is now fixed (or will be on saturday).  I'm gonna get a few pounds to spend on plenty of junk food and possibly a nice little gift for myself, i'll invite a few people around if they want to come and we will plug up some consoles into the widescreen tv and get some decent music (also known as rock) blasting out and annoying the neighbours.  There goes my reputation as a fairly decent teenager... oh well i'm not a chav!  Overall i'm quite happy except my desire for a nice young lady to fall in love with. I'm open to offers! I try not to be fussy with what i want, i dont want skinny or obese, i'm not bothered about breasts, i like nice eyes to glare into and soft hair and preferably she needs to have similar interests.  The girl I like is a freind, I want it to be more but it will not happen but i've not given up because she is far too nice for that. Never in my life have I met someone as amazing as her, she is unique but she is kind and loving, she is beautiful on the outside too but she doesn't love me in that way :'( .  Oh well I'm not giving up, I can't give her up.

      Well the fourth post of the week - i think i enjoy typing my thoughts into this space!  Anyways today i'm gonna ramble on about similar stuff to other issues this week. A online buddy of mine whose name i shall not mention at this time ;-) likes another freind of mine and by "like" i mean the type which is stronger then a freindship.  I'm gonna call, the online buddy X and my other freind who i know from non-online purposes "Y". I've known X for quite a few weeks after being put in several mass coversations together i decided to add her address to my msn list.  Shes not been a happy soul after some recent event which i don't think she will approve of me telling the world. Sorry to bring this issue in again but we trust each other, and by doing this "mission" for her i'm doing her a favour and she is doing something for me.  Y is a guy who i've known for many years, from what i know the pair are good freinds and X wants to go further. As a freind to both i feel its my duty to help them out, it may put a smile on my expressionless face! :-)  As for myself well i'm ok, i'm really really bored but hopefully i'm gonna be seeing vix and chris again to go to Nottingham and this time possibly buy something 8-0. Until then i'll probably blog some more rubbish so bai bai!  ~Atrocity
