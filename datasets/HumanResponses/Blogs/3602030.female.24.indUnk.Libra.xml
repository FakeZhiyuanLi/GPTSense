      again...i really never know where to beging with these things...but here goes...  so lately it seems that everthing has been working against me...everyone is against me and wants to see me fail...i just don't understand why i feel that way and why i take people's actions and words to mean that.  things have just really been hard for me since i've been back to florida.  i haven't met many people that will hang out with me and my daughter, kaya.  she's awesome...at least my friends from NC thought so.  it is very hard to find people that can fully accept that you have a kid...unless they have a kid, too.  i have actually met quite a few guys lately that have a kid.  one has full custody of his, and one lives near his and sees her all the time.  i've been meeting some interesting people and that's cool, but i know that it's gonna be hard to figure out the hang out schedule b/c of having the kid.  i'd really like to meet people that will go and hang out with "us"...the two of us...b/c she's my best friend.  i do have my moments though when i just feel like by getting pregnant so young i really did miss out on being able to do all the things that everyone else my age is doing.  it sucks...but i have to learn to fully accept it.  i'm trying and it's gotten better of the years.  (never finished post)

      well, i have had blogs or online journals before...but this one might be kinda cool.  i just recently met someone who uses this site.  boy does he.  so i really don't know where to begin with this...i have so much going on right now in my life that i just thought what the heck...i spend so much time on the computer that i might as well post on here instead of my regular journal...for a little while anyway.  the big secrets will be in the real thing.  so, i have a few things to do and then i will be back to post my real/official first blog entry.

      well, it seems that maybe, just maybe, things might be starting to go okay for me.  i am so tired of everything being so lame and boring and struggling month after month to make ends meet.  i just want to have a decent paying good job that i can pay my bills and get the things that kaya and i need to live.  everything has felt like it's been on the verge of blowing up in my face, so i am ready for some much desired change.  i have been meeting some people, but it's just so hard to find cool people that really honestly don't mind that i have a kid.  i know that is always gonna be a hurdle that someone is going to have to get over in order to be in my life...it's just whether they want to jump it or not.  i'm not looking for a daddy for kaya or really anyone to take care of her.  i would at least like someone to pay attention to her and be her friend.  she deserves that at least.  she has a dad, eventhough he chooses not to be a part of her life.  that is a whole other entry.  so, tonight i am to help my best friend, athena, with an outfit that she is making to dance at a club event tomorrow night.  she's crazy and i have no idea how this is going to turn out.  we shall see.  she'll be over here soon and i have no clue where we are going to begin on this project.  i have the feeling it's going to be an all night thing.  it will be fun though...it's been awhile since we have really hung out and done anything...and it makes me feel good that she picked me to help her.  i've known her for going on 18 years and it's just been amazing to me to know that i have known someone for that long and they are still in my life.  makes me think that one day i will meet someone else that will be able to put up with me the same way she has for all these years.  of course, we had several years that we were apart and we kinda went our separate ways for a time, but we are back together and that makes me smile.    i've been trying to think more positive about things, so if any of my posts should sound overly cheesy, i'm sorry...it's just my way of convincing myself that things have to get better and that i have no reason to worry.  anyway, i'm gonna pick up a few things around my apartment.  on top of the fact that my friend is coming over, a co-worker from work may stop by to pick up a book.  oh, and he's a cute co-worker, but he's only 19...he's so cute though...  'til next time.

      i was just about to turn the lights out and go to bed when i saw this letter that kaya's dad wrote to me years ago sitting on top of my jewelry box.  so, of course like everytime i see it, i read it.  the tears started rolling down my cheeks.  i hate when i find things that have to do with him and the time we spent together.  it wasn't very long that we were together, but it was truly one of the happiest times in my life.  even if he didn't mean anything that he ever said to me, i believed him and he made me feel so good about myself.  i haven't felt that good since.  there is a line in the letter that says: "i think nobody will ever love you as much as me."  i am beginning to think this is true.  no one will ever love me as much as i thought he loved me.  why is it so hard for me to truly get over what he did to me and how he made me feel special and then just made me feel horrible.  i want to hate him so much.  but i can't.  he has been living his life how he wants to without any real responsibility.  i have had to raise our child and not really put 100% into the things that i really wanted out of my life.  he's been free.  he still is, other than paying me child support, he can do whatever he wants.  don't get me wrong, i don't want him in our life.  he can be dead for all i care.  i should destroy this letter, but i want to let kaya know that he was a once seemingly caring person.  he isn't anymore, but he once tried to come across as a loving person.  i just want to know why he did this to me.  why?  i am not a bad person...and i loved him, i just wasn't ready for all the things he expected of me.  so i guess it's supposed to be my fault why we aren't together.  because i didn't want to commit to marrying him when i was only 17 years old and still in high school.  i don't know.  i hate when i get all emotional about him.  i try my damnedest to not think of him, but he has scarred me and left me with a permanent reminder of him.  why do people have to change so drastically.  like my dad...he has scarred me, too.  but yet even with the scars from these two important men in my life, i cannot bring myself to hate men or not want one around.  i just want so bad to find one that can love me for me and not turn around and stop loving me for reasons that i just don't understand.  i am a likeable and loveable person...why can't anyone stick it out with me and really get to know me?  i do feel like no one will ever love me...maybe not like he did, just maybe not at all.  this isn't what i wanted to feel just before bed, but i had to read the letter...even though i knew what it said.  things will hopefully start to change in my life, but i just wish i knew when...so i could prepare to feel happy again.  i don't even know what that feels like anymore.  no one wants me...as a friend, as family, or as a lover.  i feel worthless and pathetic...where is my life going???

      so i sort of played hooky from work today.  i really shouldn't have stayed home, but i really didn't feel good.  i know that i am gonna regret it since i won't get paid for missing today.  oh well, i got to catch up on some sleep.  that was great.  kaya stayed home from camp, too.  we both just needed a day.  i didn't really do anything all day...just slept and watched a little t.v.  anyway, i really never have anything exciting to put on this blog.  i just figured i would write for writing's sake. or rather type.  hahaha.  i hope that i find a job soon.  i really need to be making more money.  it's too hard to live off what i am making right now.  once i get my financial situation straight, i hope that i can maybe meet someone.  i want a relationship.  i want to fall in love.  i am ready.  okay, it's bed time, i don't want to be up til two or three tonight.  later.

      i can't really think of anything extremely important to write about tonight.  i feel like shit and i should be in bed right now as i am typing this blog.  my title is what i came to realize tonight...i am a one hit wonder...and that in the music business is not a good thing and in my life that is not good either.  it seems that when i meet a guy i only get one chance to make it right in bed and i'm not afforded any other chance b/c he doesn't want to give me one.  most of the guys that i have been with, even recently, i have only been with once.  i know i am not that great in bed, but am i that bad??  some of the guys i don't think i would want to be with again, but some of them i would really like the opportunity to get more comfortable with.  i don't want to be a one hit wonder!!!!  maybe there really is a guy out there that will be patient with me and teach me how to come out of my shell and be more confident.  that's all i need is a guy that wants to have a whole lot of sex and teach me things in the process...i mean it works out for both of us.  anyway...i'm thinking about playing hooky from work tomorrow...that's if i feel as nasty as i do now.  i have to do something...i really need to catch up on some sleep...bad.  okay, good night.

      well, things are just kinda rolling along with me today.  the day was kinda slow at work.  i had to take an extended lunch to go to an interview.  i think it went pretty well, too.  i may have a new job that i can start in two weeks.  i hope so...i really need it.  i am still recovering from the weekend.  i just can't seem to go to bed at a decent hour anymore.  i really should be asleep right now, but i just can't make myself go.  i am still completely stressed about my money situation this month.  i don't know how i am getting many of my bills paid.  being a broke ass bitch sucks...!  soon though i am hoping that my luck will change.  i definately need it to.  they have to or else.  well, i guess i am just gonna go try to hit the sack and pass the fuck out.  hopefully i will make it through tomorrow.  i may have to leave early...come up with an excuse that kaya doesn't feel well and i have to pick her up from camp.  i don't know...i just hate going to work these days.  can't wait until i get that new job.  later.

      so i had a good weekend.  didn't get much sleep but i guess i can try to catch up on that this week.  athena  did end up coming over on friday night to get started on her outfit for the club on saturday.  we slaved until 6 a.m. on that thing and still didn't get anything much done.  she came back over on saturday around 1 p.m. and we got started again.  i think we finished the project around 8-ish.  the outfit turned out pretty damned good and athena looked hot in it.  she can get away with wearing something like we made.  anyway, it was funny because we went out to wal-mart at like 3 in the morning and bought a sewing machine and i think we are gonna return it here in the next day or so.  i'm not but james or athena will.  james also volunteered to watch kaya for me so i could go out with athena and his new roommate, andreah.  we had a really good time.  i didn't get home until 7 something.  kaya actually called me to find out where i was.  it was just funny b/c she's never called me before to know when i would be home.  hilarious how funny kids can be...and mine is a trip.  today was pretty good...i just slept most of the day.  been cleaning up this evening.  think i am gonna start up a bachelor's cleaning service.  i'll start with the guys that i know and then let them network me out to other friends.  we'll see...i figure if i charge $10-15 per room depending on size that's not a lot.  and it makes it so they don't have to clean.  i'll just have to let them know that there is no guarantee for shininess or spotlessness...just doing general cleaning and tidying up.  most guys would appreciate that.  i dunno...i just really need to make some extra fucking money.  the bills are getting out of hand.  i have a job interview tomorrow, so i am really excited about that.  it will pay me two dollars more an hour if i get it.  i really hope so.anyway, it's after midnight and i don't want to be too groggy tomorrow for the interview.  i just wanted to make a quick post about the weekend.  i can elaborate more later.  so off to dream i go and hope that they are good ones....

      today, or rather yesterday since it is after midnight, was a pretty good day.  i slept in til about one and then got up and really tried to motivate myself to clean.  that didn't work too well.  kaya ended up going outside to play with the two girls from upstairs and didn't help me at all.  sometime during the late afternoon early evening the power went out for about 30 mins to an hour.  not really sure how long, but it seemed like forever.  anyway, the day as just an average day, but i felt so much better than the previous days.  it's good to be back to normal, well semi-normal.  so, i was sitting here at my computer and my cell rang...it was this guy that i hooked up with last sat./sun.  he was calling to see if i wanted to "hang out".  unfortunately my wonderful friend came to visit as of this morning.  nice.  so i had to turn him away.  sucks...a guy actually calls me to hang out a second time and i can't.  go figure.  hopefully my friend will only be in town for a few days.  and then i can call upon mr. seconds...or rather ninths or tenths...he is one i don't know if i can keep up with.  anyway, kinda made me feel good that someone wanted to hang out again...even if for just, well, you know.  tomorrow i have this interview and i am hoping and praying that it goes well.  as i keep saying i am a broke ass bitch.  i need something to pan out for me soon or else i just don't know what i am going to do.  things are really getting tight and i just can't seem to find something that is gonna bail me out.  wish i had a really well-off family that could help me out.  but i got stuck with poor folk.  oh well, one day kaya and i will be making really good money and we will be helping others out of situations and doing good deeds for others.  that is what i hope for anyway.  alright it's almost 1:30 in the a.m. and i need to get some sleep so that i am good to go for my interview.  wish me luck.

      just getting over some crazy allergy cold or something.  feel so much better than i have the past few days.  missed a day of work this past week and that sucked b/c i can't afford to not get paid for a whole day.  anyway...it was great to just sleep.  i think that is mostly what i did this week.  i slept most of today, too.  i needed it bad.  so i feel really good now...still a wee bit stuffy in the nose, but that should clear up fully by tomorrow.  just glad to be somewhat back to normal.  things seem like they may start to pick up and get a little better for me.  i really need them to.  this money bullshit is just stressing me out more than i need to be.  i've really got to put some of my money making schemes to work and soon.  i have another interview on monday.  it's for a sales and marketing company.  we'll see how that goes.  i need something to pull through for me and fast.  either that or i need to ask the dealership for more money.  i doubt they would give me a raise now...they'll probably tell me to stick it out for one more month until my year mark.  even if i end up having to do that...they won't be able to pay me what i need to be making to survive.  i need to meet someone really cool that won't mind sharing a place with me and kaya.  that would be an ideal situation.  i could have someone to talk to once in awhile and cheaper rent and living expenses.  may end up having to move somewhere with james, but i don't know what he wants to do.  i just know that something has to be done with me and very soon.  don't know how many times i can express that.    well, i guess it's after one in the morning on sunday.  i need to try to get some sleep.  kaya and i are gonna clean the place tomorrow.  i'm gonna make her help.  we are gonna go room by room.  probably start with the living room, then kitchen, then bathroom then her room, then i'll do my room later on after kaya goes to bed.  next weekend is the fourth of july...i still have no clue what we are gonna do.  i need to start figuring something out.  alrighty...off to bed i go...hopefully i will be able to fall asleep pretty quick...

      it's been awhile since i last wrote anything so i am posting a new entry.  i don't know really what to write in this one.  not too much has been going on.  well, this week i had a flooded kitchen, the kid got lice, and i'm still a broke ass bitch.  but luckily my neighbor's new roomie, andrea, is gonna watch kaya for me so i will save some money on camp.  that is great...i needed the break.  so things are hopefully gonna start to look up.  i just hope that in the next month or so i can get everything straight to move out of my current apartment and get into a place closer to kaya's new school.  i've been looking in riverside and san marco areas.  may drive through there tomorrow and check out a few places.  we'll see.  anyway, it's saturday night and yet again i have nothing to do...i'm getting ready to go in the kid's room and clean it up...we have to start going through stuff so that we can eliminate any unnecessary stuff to pack.  okay...going to clean up...till next post.
