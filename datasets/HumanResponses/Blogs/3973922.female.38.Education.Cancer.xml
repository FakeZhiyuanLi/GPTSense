        I'm making myself crazy; it's getting to the point where I can't tell what's good and what isn't. I think it's good when I'm writing it; I think, at last, I've found the vase for my petunias (or the bedpan for my piss). Then, while I'm watching Law & Order with Jon (a double feature tonight), the new and supposedly improved pages on my desk begin to taunt me:  Not so fast , they say.  You know we're not quite right, not even close . I know I should leave them alone until morning; I know I should take my blood pressure pill (yes, I'm old) and go to bed. If I don't sleep tonight, I won't be able to write in the morning; I'll wake up at two in the afternoon (I know, poor me) and feel the day is shot. At three there's Dr. Phil (reruns, no less), and at four, People's Court; or I could go for the five o'clock Dr. Phil and Charmed at six (more reruns). I'd unplug the TV, seriously I would, but without it, I'd need medication.   So, against my better judgment, I sat for a moment at my desk before going to bed, David Letterman kissing Sharon Stone in the background, and I read the three (almost three) measly pages I managed to crank out this afternoon, after I spent the entire morning researching a Royal Caribbean cruise I can't afford; I now know the layout of all fifteen decks of the ship,  Voyager of the Sea . I am also familiar with the full trip itinerary (7 Nights, Western Caribbean, departing from Miami, with stops in Belize City, Costa Maya, Cozumel, and George Town/Grand Cayman), as well as all the extra excursions available at each stop (this took some time). In addition, I can tell you the dress code requirements for both men and women for the formal dining room; the amenities of the various staterooms (a hair dryer is included in each room, you'll be happy to know); and Royal Caribbean's refund policy, in the event of a hurricane, for instance. Mind you, I kept returning to the Royal Caribbean website on Jon's computer (his is connected to the internet, mine is not) while, next to my computer, my coffee grew cold and the dreaded pages waited in vain, at least until after the Price is Right (a guy won three cars).   Well, well. Some writer I am. It's just that, after thinking I was on a roll (don't make me seasick) with thirty good pages, it's hard to start over; imagine if it was fifty, or a hundred and fifty. How would I deal with that? All I can think of is Chevy Chase in one of my all-time favorite movies (naturally),  Funny Farm  -- the one where he unwittingly eats all those bull testicles and his wife ends up being the writer instead of him, inspired by a stuffed squirrel. I feel the need to rent that movie.   Jon says I'm trying too hard; I know he's right.  Just keep going , he says.  Don't look at the old pages . It's the same advice I would give to someone with my symptoms. And be patient (like Dave said in the Comments); a novel's not something I can figure out with a snap of the fingers. Sure Faulkner wrote  As I Lay Dying  in six weeks while working at a power plant, but I'm no Faulkner. I'm a whiny little brat who enjoys bull testicles (well, who doesn't?).   I need to stop now; my, this blog is a good outlet, though. Thanks to all who've offered advice and encouragement; much appreciated. Tomorrow's another day; initially, I wanted to finish a draft of my novel this summer (ha!), but, at this point, I'd be happy to finish in a year of consistent work. That's a more realistic goal. I suppose, at some point, I should say what the novel's about. Alas, tomorrow; I'm tired and my face is flushed from the Metropolol. Maybe I'll call my mom (my adopted mom, Edith); she turns 89 on Monday. Luckily, she's more of a night-owl than I am. When I was in high school, I used to fall asleep to her late-night renditions at the piano of  Those Were the Days, My Friend , and  Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue, Has Anybody Seen... ; I don't know what I'll do when she isn't there for me to call anymore (may it not be for a long time, knock on my wooden skull -- knocking on wood, my one remaining superstition). When I was a kid, and I still said prayers, I tried to name everyone I knew in my prayers each night. The list of names grew longer and longer. My mom would sit on the edge of the bed and wait until I was finished. I closed my eyes, folded my hands on top of the covers, and recited the names. I worried that if I forgot anyone, something bad could happen to them. There's a character in my novel, Nina, who does the same thing.   By the way, Room Service on  Voyager of the Sea  is available twenty-four hours.

        Thought I'd share a poem today. The novel is one project I have this summer (ad infinitum); the other is my poetry manuscript. It's difficult to figure out an order for the poems. The next book of poems I have in mind is more unified in its theme: a collection of prose poems in the voices of various patients in a mental health institution. My current collection, however, is more eclectic; many of the poems, however, deal with my birth mother, Adrienne. This is one of my favorites:

       So we're coming to the end of July, and I've hit a wall. During the cycle of the school year, I teach high school English in the Bronx, and I was looking forward to the summer and the opportunity, finally, to write.  I had planned to live as a monk and concentrate on my writing; I wanted to finish my long-on-the-back-burner first novel by the end of the summer (naive, yes).  Well, the monk part is working out fine (I haven't left the house or showered in three days); the writing, unfortunately, is another story.  For years, I've had one excuse or another: no money; no time; no job; divorce.  Though I have an MFA from the University of Miami in Florida, and I've published poems in half a dozen literary journals, I rarely refer to myself as a writer.  At the end of the school year, when friends and colleagues asked about my summer plans, I mumbled something about trying to do some writing, and, though I didn't sound like it, I believed it this time.  I didn't have to pack up and move to another state; I wasn't going through a terrible break up; I didn't have to take classes; I wasn't having surgery; no one in my family had died in the last year (thank providence); I had the whole summer to myself -- paid, no less.  If I couldn't do it now, I'd never do it.  Hence, my despair.     The summer, I sense, is slipping away.  For the first ten days, I was cruising along just fine.  I felt like I knew where the novel was going, and I'd completed about thirty pages.  I'd finally settled on a narrative voice: third person limited, past tense.  It had taken me a long time to let go of my original concept of the novel, which involved using five different narrators and writing in first person, present tense (alla Faulkner's  As I Lay Dying  -- though he, of course, had many more narrators, and is the God to my peon).  I wrote several chapters, using the different narrators, in a fiction workshop at Miami several years ago, and I was able to revise some of that work. I also have a flow chart that outlines the whole novel; it's semi-autobiographical, though I'm not in it in any direct way.  I had, what I thought, were thirty good pages in ten days. So what happened?     I had a birthday.   I went up to see my family in Connecticut and took a day off.   Plus, my boyfriend,  urlLink Jon , took a week off from work. I lost my rhythm. And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I am full of excuses.  My mom is supportive, and Jon is supportive, even after all these years of nothing (in terms of the novel; poems, naturally, are not nothing, though I haven't written many new ones lately either). I asked Jon not too long ago, "What if I can't do it? What if I try my best, and fail?" He said, "So you're a teacher."  And it's true; it wouldn't be the end of the world. In fact, I really enjoy teaching; if my writing ever gave me enough money to live on (pipe dream), I would still want to teach, either high school or college. But I can't give up; I feel like a part of me would die if I gave up on writing (melodramatic, I know). Maybe that's the problem; I put too much pressure on myself. There's too much at stake for me. The book I'm writing is very important to me; and I have about eight more projects in mind. I'm desperate to write. I call it the Warren Zevon factor. I have a copy of his last CD by my desk. I saw a documentary about how he worked so hard to finish it before he died. It's a lesson I can't shake; I don't have forever.  I am a fool to waste even one more day.     I'm unhappy, though, with the pages I've written.  They need rewriting, and I'm not sure how to proceed.  I even tried the first person, present tense again.  My prose seems too choppy to me, and I fail to pull the reader into the story in the first chapter.  There are paragraphs here and there that work, but overall, doubt has settled in, like a Saint Bernard by the fire.  I do want to keep to the third person, past tense, though; and I'd like to try a plainer style.  The lyricism of my poetry takes over my prose too much, I think.  I don't know if any of this makes any sense.  When I was in graduate school, I never read the comments anyone made on my poems or fiction; they tended to stick in my head like peanut butter to the roof of my mouth, so I just gave up reading them.  I think the initial stage of writing is something you have to work out yourself anyway.    Well, I think I'll give it a rest for now, and go take a shower, put on clean underwear.  Miami CSI is on tonight, Casino and For Love or Money (guilty pleasure).  Tomorrow morning I'll get up, make a cup of instant coffee, and turn on the computer; no excuses -- no more whiny little brat.  There's nothing to do really but sit my butt in the chair and try; temper my expectations.  I do love to write; I love when I look up from the keyboard, my wrists stiff and my ankles swollen, and find that three or four hours have passed.  It's a great feeling.     So thanks for enduring my admittedly self-indulgent prattlings. Comments are appreciated. Maybe there are some other writers out there who might like to share their stories or a few words of advice (nonwriters are encouraged as well, of course). It is a lonely affair, writing.  And private; I'm nervous about this blog, like running my dirty undies up a flag pole.  But what the hell.  At least I wrote something today.    P.S. -- Jon has Easy Cheese.

        I reworked the first chapter again. Finally, I can at least read the first paragraph without wanting to change anything. I added quite a bit to the chapter, though, and I'm worried I made it worse overall. I'm a little afraid to read on, past the first paragraph. It's exhausting, picking at this sentence or that. I'm never satisfied. I have ideas about how long the paragraphs should be and whether or not I'm repeating certain words too much, words such as left, right, down, follows, leaves, lifts, first, again, upper, lower, out, over, up, inside, back -- directional words, I suppose, that I seem to use a lot (Too much? I'm conscious of it, but does it bug the reader? Does the reader notice? I've decided probably not). I go over it so many times, reading it aloud as I go, I have parts of it memorized (I do that with poems, too -- maybe it's just my method, what works for me). It's not like it doesn't read fairly well, as is. It's this nebulous instinct I have to want to make it better. It makes me crazy. Half the things I change, I change back (at least I'm not a sculptor -- imagine the marble I'd go through!). I take a line out one day and put it back the next. And round and round the track I go. Actually, it's more like bumper cars than a track. A track implies speed (although you don't get anywhere in either case).        I'm already looking at the Edward Taylor books I have as research for my next project -- yeah, as if. Well, why not? I will eventually finish this thing (talk about faith). Last night, around one in the morning, I called my mom (though I shouldn't have -- I was too tired, and I get grumpy when I'm tired), and she asked me how many pages I had. I felt compelled to lie; I couldn't fess up to only having nine of what I consider to be polished pages (with another 30 or so ready for revision, she says cheerily). After all this time, how can I only have nine pages? I need to move on, I know that. Push through into the next chapter (which I also have a good start on), and the next and the next, and so forth. Just don't look back. It's like crossing a steel beam, only instead of don't look down, it's don't look back. Of course, ten or so pages a month is a hundred and twenty pages a year, which is a good-sized book every two, two and a half years. That would be fine with me. I don't need to publish a book every year (I'm not Joyce Carol Oates, though a professor compared me to her, which I'm not sure is good or bad -- I'm afraid I haven't read anything by her; the professor, though, meant it as a compliment).       Unfortunately, as the writing gets better (and it is getting better), the depression gets worse. I feel drained. I'm thinking of giving my car away; I can't afford to drive it anyway. I need a pitcher of margaritas, or a trip to Vegas, something. I don't think I'll take the whole summer off next year. I think I'll teach summer school instead. I need the money, and I go batty by myself all day. I'm glad I did this, though. I needed to know just what the writing takes (it takes your soul). If I taught summer school, I'd get out around one in the afternoon, and that would still leave me plenty of time to write. This fall, I also fully intend to continue working on this book (no, I mean it this time). If I do the early shift (periods one through eight instead of two through nine -- our school is an extended time school), I can be home by four. I'd only want to write for two or three hours a day while I'm working anyway. I could look forward to that time for myself.        I do love to write. I get mad when I reach my absolute limit after six or seven hours (sometimes twelve or thirteen hours) and I can't go on (see what I mean about the nine pages?). I want to keep working, but the screen is blurry and the backs of my thighs are numb. It can become obsessive. And there's a diminishing return after a few hours anyway. That's when I start picking over clean bones. I need to relax, take it in stride. Go for a walk. Find some balance. I went to bed around six thirty this morning. I made myself get up after about five hours, so I'm hoping I'll sleep tonight, turn my clock back around. Of course, I thought the same thing last night and the night before. I'm groggy as hell; I need more coffee. But I went to bed thinking about the Confederacy of Dunces guy. How he worked so hard on his book and how he couldn't find a publisher and ended up killing himself (I don't know if that's why). It's considered such a brilliant book -- highly praised post mortem (won the Pulitzer, I think) -- and he fell into such despair. I was thinking how now I understand. I understand them all -- Sylvia Plath, Hemingway. It wasn't because they couldn't write. It was because they could. The demands are so great.        Jon says I should try to be more short and pithy with my blog, but I don't think I'm very good at short and pithy -- I'm more the introspective, maudlin type. In any case, here's a sample from my hope-to-be first novel. Overall, there are five of what I call headline characters in the book: Jason, Adrienne, Phaedra, Nina, and a case worker. They're not narrators, per se, since the book is in third person (i.e., he/she instead of I). But each chapter begins with the name of one of these five characters at the top of the page. I attempt to stay faithful to that character's perspective and experiences (as much as any novelist can -- in the end, it's all me, of course). In brief, the book's about what you'd call an "underprivileged" family trying to put itself back together, and what's on each individual's mind throughout the story (I love to mix memory with what's happening in the scene -- the past and the present, by our nature, are always simultaneous). The book is called  Newton's Cradle  (five voices, like the five suspended silver balls in a Newton's Cradle, clicking back and forth -- cause and effect; the word "Cradle" is appropriate for its associations, too). The following excerpt is from the first chapter, from Jason's perspective. (Unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out how to indent, so I had to leave an extra line between paragraphs. I tried editing the HTML, but it wouldn't accept the spacer I put in. Maybe Jon will know).

        Above my desk, I have two pictures of myself feeding goldfish at Longwood Gardens, in Kennett Square, PA. The view is from the back, and I'm kneeling, sitting on my heels. In the first picture, my hand extends over the pond to drop the pellets (a handful for a quarter from a bubble-gum-type dispenser nearby), and in the second picture, after I'd dropped the pellets, I'm just sitting back, watching. I remember there were these black fish that came up quick from the depths to snatch the food from the larger, slower goldfish (these weren't the ordinary bowl-type goldfish I was accustomed to -- I hadn't realized they could grow so large, a foot or more). To get the food to the goldfish, and not their unwelcome companions, I had to practically put it in their mouths. Cylindrical brown pellets that left the scent of dog food in my hand. My adopted mom, Edith, took the pictures from behind. There are other tourists in the shot -- a bald man and his wife with a fanny pack (it's strange that I remember a fanny pack; I went back just now to my desk to reexamine the pictures, and there's no fanny pack). My mom and I were on one of those Kaplan bus tours. I'd just turned sixteen; we'd had to delay the trip after I came down with mono (diagnosed  on        my sixteenth birthday, mind you). My throat hurt so bad, I couldn't go near the birthday cake. Luigi's vanilla and chocolate custard, with buttermilk frosting and extra flowers. We put it in the freezer for later. I dropped down to 118 pounds, not being able to swallow. I cured myself with crusty bread, forced myself to swallow it until it had scraped all the painful white gunk off my tonsils (gross). After that, I was able to eat again.    So what's the point of all this? I started out with the idea of describing what I keep on and around my desk. The pictures at Longwood Gardens, how solitary I looked; the rose-colored glass tea light holder on its metal pedestal; the two pewter wizards, one with ruby eyes (my birth mother gave me that one, and the other I found at Goodwill); the ragged, palm-sized stuffed lion with the orange mane and bright green eyes that my adopted mom granted me at the gift shop in the Catskills hotel, not long after I first moved in with her and my father (I named him Pal; it was the only trip we took as a family, with my father along); the Newton's Cradle, with the silver click-clack balls (the title of my novel,   Newton's Cradle  ); the official casino dice from the Venetian in Las Vegas; the sunset picture I took when I was twenty-three at Rick's Cafe in Negril, Jamaica, on my honeymoon, my new husband rushing me to make the bus back to the resort, and the sinking sensation I had as I watched the colors streak through the clouds that our marriage wouldn't last; the picture my brother Joe's daughter (from my birth mother's side) drew for me when they visited five or more years ago (I've only seen her twice) -- tall, North Carolina trees, a pink and orange sun, and a girl in a pink striped outfit, her feet floating off the ground, her arms spread wide (she reminded me so of my birth mother, I couldn't stop staring); the photo-painting of a woman with her face melting, in shades of swamp green, bought from a street vendor here in New York (he wanted ten dollars, and I gave him twenty); the portrait a cartoonist named Halsey drew of me while I was waiting for a Connecticut Limo at LaGuardia airport (I didn't know he was doing it -- I look irked from having missed my ride).    There are other toys, too, on a corner shelf above my desk. Lately, I mainly play with the mechanical chickens and the dice as I write, and the Newton's Cradle. I like these things around me; I like my past around me. Most of them wouldn't mean much to anyone else. After my father died, my mom, Edith, cleaned his desk. It was one of the first things she did. She took down the name plate he had from his bed spring factory, and the poem I gave him for father's day. He never would let her, or the weekly cleaning lady, touch his desk when he was alive. A few months back, I went looking for his red and black checked wool hunting coat, but it was gone. I hadn't thought to save much at the time. I have so little of him. Don't get me wrong, we did not have a good relationship. He was a difficult man to talk to, angry a lot of the time. Shortly after his death in 1998 (which I witnessed), my mom told me how disappointed he was in me (I was unemployed at the time, and didn't know what I wanted to do, except write). I know she didn't mean to hurt me, but it's hard to think that the last thing my father felt for me was disappointment. She doesn't remember saying it now. She's the sweetest person, and raised me when she didn't have to (the child of her husband's mistress), and I'm not angry at her at all. I just wish my father would have lived a little longer.    On the Kaplan trip, the tour director was a guy named Harry Shapiro. Short, a little stout, brown hair, mustache. Nice eyes. We went on a date during the trip. I looked good (118 pounds, after all), in white slacks and a blue and white striped boat-neck sweater (it was the fashion then). He said "wow" when he came to the hotel door. He was twenty, and I was sixteen. I remember, later, he wanted to kiss me, and I put him off, told him about the mono. Somehow we got talking about sex. I was a virgin, but he said he thought maybe I was into oral sex. I told him I wasn't. He never pushed. After the trip, he wrote me a lot of letters. Practically everyday at the mailbox there was another fat envelope. He sent me short stories he wrote, all typed out. They weren't bad, from what I recall. I remember a vivid scene of a man taking a whiz, describing the piss hitting the water in the toilet, and the bubbles that formed around the water's edge in the bowl. I liked the detail. Harry's intensity scared me, though. He came down from Hartford to visit (ate his t-bone clean, I remember). Got along okay with my father. After dinner, we went for a walk by Rooster River, about a half mile from my house. It was dark, and anything could have happened, but he was a gentleman. I told him I wanted to break it off; I had worried all week about his response. He just laughed, said it was fine; he must have thought I was so young (and I was).    Looking back at it, Harry's stories were one my first introductions to being a writer. On that front, my novel's coming along. For the moment, I've given up on the idea of having a routine, a structured time when I write. My clock got all turned around from insomnia and a natural tendency to stay up till dawn when I don't have to get up for work (and, admittedly, too much TV), and I could never make that 9:00 a.m. appointment I had with myself at my desk. I came to feel like if I didn't write in the morning, I wouldn't write at all that day. But now I just say screw it, I'll write whenever I happen to be awake, and I'll keep the TV on if I want to. It's been going okay; I'm at my desk five, six hours at a time. It's physically demanding. My legs get swollen and my colon acts up (too much information, I realize, but I think I know why Hemingway used to write standing up). But it's great. I'd still like to get some kind of routine going, but if I can't, as long as I'm writing most days, I'm happy.    Jon laughs at me, "You still on that first chapter?" It's true; I must have revised the thing fifteen times. I'm back to my original concept for the book (sort of). I'm back to five different narrators (only one in any given chapter), and it's in present tense, but I'm writing in third person (like Michael Cunningham's   The Hours  ). Now that I've figured out my format (I think), I have a lot of material that I can adapt. Still, it takes a long time to get a chapter to the point where I feel like it's "good enough." I was very depressed for a while; I felt good while I wrote, but then, when I went back and read the pages, I hated them. Now I realize that it just takes more work, writing and rewriting and rewriting again. For the first time, the other day, I looked at the pages and I thought,   Hey, maybe they're getting there  . That was two rewrites ago. Most of it's sentence level editing. Then maybe I add a paragraph here or there, change this dialogue or that, figure out how I want to present the dialogue (how does Michael Cunningham do it?). It's a slow process, but I think the work's getting better. I'll include an excerpt soon, I promise. Writing it's one thing, putting it out there's another. I'm sure when authors go back and read something they've published, they see things they'd like to change. So how do you know when something's finished? Anyway, speaking of finished, I guess I'll wrap things up for now. Jon's home with massive back pain. I think I just heard him collapse on the sofa.    P.S. -- Hats off to ya Harry.  Hope you're out there writing.
