      Hey everyone!      This is my first time to do this blog thing so I'm kinda excited. I guess you woulod refer to me as a "Blog Virgin" cuz I actually have something to write about. On Friday Night I saw Mean Girls with my sister. It was really good, but Lindsay Lohan's boobs were just everywhere! It was gross! There's one scene where she's wearig this really tight strapless dress and she's wearing a red bra under it so you could see her bra, and she runs after the guy she likes in high heels and her boobs are just bouncin' around... it's disgustin'. But overall it was a good movie.      Friday night I had the wierdest dream. See, in History we're watching The Pianist, and it's about WWII and the whole thing is just terrible. Anyway, so I had a dream that I lived in Germany during WWII and I was hiding a Jew in my apartment. There's a really funny prt of the dream where we're sitting on the couch in like the main lobby and he wants to watch the Great Mouse Detective and I'm really nervous that someone'll come in and see him, and for some reason he got really mad at me and stormed off into the room. Wierd, I know! And our apartment was like a bathroom with 2 bath tubs in it and we would have to sleep in the bath tubs...whew glad that's over.      I had a good weekend. My sister isn't sick anymore, so we got to hang out. On saturday, I thought the choir was going to have a car wash and we went around looking for it in the most likely of places, but we didn't find it. So we decided to go to Six Flags. The lines were friggin' long but we waited in them anyway. They were going fast so it really wasnt a big deal. Anyway, so we were in line for the Batman and there were these really cute boys behind us. My sister started talking to them and when we looked at them, they were twins!! Oh my goodness they were so cute! Their names were Hunter and Tanner and they had a friend with them named Jonathan, who was pretty funny. I liked Tanner the best, but they were all cool guys. I think they all pretty much liked my sister more since she's prettier than me and can flirt more easily so she was talking more than I was. They were from Meers, Oklahoma and they were there for their senior trip. Man were they precious. So they had to go and I still am beating myself up for not giving them my phone number!! Why the heck did I not give them our number!? Gees I'm so stupid! Oh well. So it was really fun hanging out with them. That was my Saturday.      I learned Spanish on Sunday! We're going to Mexico for a church mission trip and we have to learn Bible verses and a few simple songs in Spanish. So I went home and was saying the verses out loud and my dad was yelling at me cuz he was trying to watch TV and I was being too loud. Hehe  Well, that's all I have for now... tune in again... Same blog time, Same blog channel!
