      *hoorays* today was considered the best day of the week! maybe because its the weekend. maybe its just me. haha. you decide. hmmm. the day started just fine. with me, crawling out of bed literally. i mean crawling, yes. normal routine: wake up and bathe. was going to school for chemistry E.P. its always rocked with miss jaz!  so, it begin with her talking about us not doing the mind map on organic chemistry. *blah blah blah* she nags. so, she flashed the transperency, with the already done mind map, letting us copy down. my map was small compared to the rest lorz. i felt a sense of accomplishment. (bows). but, woah, the remedial worksheet she gave us was a tough nut to crack. consisted of all the good schools prelim, such as cedar, dunman, catholic high. E.P went on till 10 plus. after which, me and jun jie proceeded to phillip's house to chill for a while. i was actually planning to test his bike. apaarently, the rain was in my tracks. so yeah. we hanged out, played cards, listened music, then about 12, i went cycling for 10 plus minutes?! haha. pathetic, but worthwhile. hmm.  the next part of the day, was meeting evonne for a swim. its been a long time since i saw her. there she was, at yio chu kang bus interchange canteen, siiting with a soon to be naval diver from the 22nd. (okay. my BDC was with the 22nd batch, so had good time with them) we alked and talked, about shirts and sandals, instructors and stuff. evonne's crazy about them. hmm. swimming, swimming, swimming, 20 laps just passed. haha. couldn't catch up with evonne. she's too fast. anyway, i overtook her at the last 4 lap because she stopped! i felt so inferior. haha. not bad la. 30 laps in 40 minutes or so. did some breath hold with her, and sinking to the bottom of the pool for no reason. *recapping diving signals actually* you can always count on evon to have fun.   rushed home. cnadice said she wanted geog notes, so had to rushed. in the end, i found out they were lost somewhere. meeting never took place then. i took my time to wash up. later hitting town to play pool. so rush rush, contacts couldn't went in. had to take some time. got ready finally, and my sister drove me to plaza sing. she's a great driver i must say. *applauses* went to orhard, walked around tangs, found the place selling the item, hesitated here and there. decided on one and bought it. it now lies proudly in my store room, waiting to be given to someone. met phillip and clement&nbsp;for pool. btw, pool was great. i improved by a bit. impressed at myself too! haha. i know its lame but yeah. i'm impressed by myself. *claps* tonight's game was well played. enjoyed it with phillip and clement. their company rocks. cause we're brothers. was late because of clement though. but its all right.  i just realisd that i had to go to xue pin's boy town or home carnival thingy. so i had to called almost everyone. or rather, sms-ed everyone. evonne didn't picked up. haish. problem lies with her. AGAIN. she's always un-contactable. have to meet her to meet instructor tony tomorrow for some stuff. unclear on what's it about. i guess i have to wait till tomorrow.   so, the day's spent well. so be it and lets retire shall we.  you have friendship. courtship. relationship. so why can't we have brothership?- me  &nbsp;

      cheers! its the weekend again. one week passed by yet again, which brings us sec 4s closer to our prelims by one week. its like a double-edged sword isn't it. *sighs*   school. it was okay. except for the supid, waste of time, visit to the parliment house. english lesson was best. spend the three periods on the imac lab practically surfing internet! and of course, listening to music. *evil laughs* okay. to the topic about the visit. i think its quite stupid. serious. you just spent 1 hour plus, listening to the tour huide talk and talk and alk, when you can actually get the information from webbies. the only thing that amazed me was the design and the grandeur of the place. i was in the lobby area, looking up, i saw this very large design and lights and wood. superb. but i wonder, how much money was spent in building this place. such a waste of funds. went home from there after that. rushed home to go tuition.  amaths tution again on friday nights. tonight, i missed the school concert band because of it! however, i heard the concert wasn't really that good. what can you expect from the maris stella concert band! all i remembered was that the slow march piece can't even play properly.&nbsp;left tutor's &nbsp;home at about 2215 hrs. on the way back,&nbsp;the&nbsp;shadows of the bars in the bus repeated itself,&nbsp;street light after street light. looking up, i say the bill board, which says, "love is worth the wait" (sex in the city advert) is it really. that led&nbsp;me to ponder about,&nbsp;my situation. if anyone had caught oc last night, i was exactly in seth shoes.&nbsp;i really don't want to&nbsp;do this, i told myself in my head. i will give her so much pain, both of them,&nbsp;not just one, and it&nbsp;a mistake i regretted previously. so, my conclusion. either tomorrow night and the next day. have to tell them soon. yeah.   i hope tomorrow would be a better day for me. chemistry E.P in the morning, followed by me going to phillip's house to train on his bike. swimming with evon later in the afternoon! yay. finally, i have someone to tain with me. so happy. *lalala* then, planning to go play pool in the evening, before which, i going tangs to buy the present. if its still there, that is. haha. oh yes. i managed to escape the clutches of dk. all rightey! stupid idiot. ask me go cut my fringe.   oh eyah. candice just asked me to copy geog notes for her. so that will be in the list of things i going to do on saturday! hmm. candice and jia min...... i think i decided.   sometimes, love turns into pain, which then turns into greater love.- me

      can anyone tell me what's founder's day? a day to celebrate the founder's birthday or just something to commemorate that person? how many of us actually appreciates the work that the person had put into for the school. that's a question i pose to all of you out there.  mine, mass was the celebration for it. there they are, marists, cursing and swearing, some aloud, some sliently in their hearts, wondering why they had to go for the celebrations. was it really necessary to force all the students into it. even if the teachers did, will the students enjoy the celebrations. i think not my dear friend. all of them, students, marists or not, would rather take off, have fun. rather than wasting thier time in the pathetic hall of the school. cramped. sleepy. and humid. all these factors aggrevate their dissatisfaction towards the school. perhaps,&nbsp;a few of them in there, might take time to wonder about their school's founder, but i doubt ever seriously. me, i am guilty of my own conduct too. laugh my friend, laugh.   next question.&nbsp;school's mass. they hold it&nbsp;to celebrate&nbsp;somewhat a catholic event.&nbsp;i have no idea whats the event.&nbsp;so, the students up on the stage, singing their&nbsp;songs,&nbsp;a proof of love towards their&nbsp;god. does their god really knows that they are singing? or is there even one up there? i believe not my dear friend. for me, i believe its fate. this fate of ours, was already drawn out, written out onto something even before we were even born. perhaps we are in some kind of puppet show, where greater beings, not in this universe, maybe even the universe was created by them, puppet us. can it be the truth? sounds familiar? matrix it sounds like. but its not what i have in mind. i mean, e could have been born out, just to act out what was written on our lives. we just don't know that. how strange. i too believe not all can be explained by science. ghosts, and so on, maybe they are real. we just turn a blind eye to them. perhaps we are not in the same dimension as them? strange facts of life&nbsp;i ponder.   okay. description of today's events. did a test on relative velocity. passed up a empty paper. seriously empty. endured through the celebrations. *stupid singers. its propaganda i tell you* hit the gym. gym was great. it always has been. tired out now.   death. its only a beginning of another life. i hope.- me

      *whistles* yestarday was class photo taking! haha. everyone was like, uh, excited about it! first reason, this is our last year! in that lousy place next to mount vernon crematoriom. it was bad that we had to miss out tze peng. heard he's sick, and in hospital. poor fellow. *prays for him*   well, you could term all of us(the hiao guys in the class) as metrosexuals. guess what we did. most of us came into class in the morning with hair so outrageous! spiked, flat, side, you name it, you got it. me, erm, was one of them too. gel-ed my hair. which was a rare sight in school. so, good for my classmates! *winks* the toilet was full of people. the smell of gel, wax, and all sorts of sculpting lotions would fill your nostrills as you close into the proximity. (the familar smell of loreal enters my nose) hmmm. you could see, everyione staring the mirror, fondling with their hair, doing some last minute adjustments to look their best. its a funny sight. Never will you expect that boys can be as hiao as char bos. i stood there, together with my mirror kakis, making sure that every detail of the hair was perfect. haha. phototaking was over in less than a minute. sad. did a lot of imformal poses. like the fleming's right hand rule.. balh blah blah.   today photo was individual. didn't bother to gel up my hair this time. too lazy to do so. just put on my contacts. it was&nbsp; just putting on the school coat. boring!&nbsp;heh. spent about an hour trying to wrap her present. in the dark too. well, not exactly in the dark. there was light. but not bright. like the cosy light you have in living rooms. yeah. my wrapping sucks. i kow it. people knows it. so pardon me will you? it was hard work though. slept at 12.30am. cool right. *yawnz* spent school quite well though. passed my geog test. thats good. chem practical was abit off the charts. chemicals spilling all around. especially the stupid potassium manganate. argh. its purple and it stains! *curses* maths lesson was used to talk to my friends about pokemon! haha. lame but, yeah. did some catching up on some old past time. went toa payoh to study for a while with my two friends. in actual fact, was waiting to see her to pass her the present. its her birthday! *congrats, you're 16* can go watch nc-16 movies liao lorz. *swears* haiz. mine have to wait for another 5 months! sad. got some good news. dentist said confirmed taking out braces in another two months. yay! finally. after 3 odd years. it has been a tough time la. with my braces and everything. finally....   beauty need not come from the person. it may come from the things the person does.- me

      if you have seen spiderman 2, peter parker was reading up on poems so that he could at least impress his MJ. though, it was not of successful attempt, but hey, at least he tried his best. so i wonder, poems. hmm. romance is always closely linked to poems isn't it. "with her beauty, so capivative...." okay. i don't know one. so what?!   does poems have to ryhme? no. it actual fact, most of them don't. ryhming poems are just s small fraction of the poetic world.&nbsp;poems are sentences people come up with, during their boredom, to waste away time. you&nbsp;hear people speak of great poets, like shakespeare i think, or some chinese poet su dong po, but did they really know these poets? no! how would you know if they just having some fun. though, some of them maybe reciting them for a living, to earn some cash to feed the family, and by chance, these poems became so influential and powerful that its swept across nations?   so. enough of poems. i created one. it was a rhyming one. it was bad. trust me, when you hear it, you won't like it. barn's hay?! haha.*that was in my poem somewhere before i scrapped it* i had some inspiration out of nowhere, so i just jotted it down. who knows, it maybe well-liked someday.   monday blues. what do you know. school was so so, followed the normal timetable. went to the school gym for p.e. did some running to gear up for the triathlon (oh no, its 2338 now). was sweating like hell in that stuff room. can't brother do something about it, like put in some funds for maintenance. hell with him, hopes he contract sars in china. did some weights, by then, was quite shagged. then cam along an old boy from somewhere, saying he want to take pictures of the school for some bulletin or something. *snap snap snap* his cam was cool. way too cool. managed to pose abit for the cam though. along with my other kakis in the room. haha. i admit i'm retarded la. ate my mum's sandwich, followed by fruits. maths then geog. home the last thing.   man. getting sleepy already. going to stop here.   the poems that we study could be just some lines an idiot came up with.- me

      its sunday. somehow, happiness and loneliness seems to co-exist with each other on this day. anyway. my sister flew to hong kong today for a three holiday. hopes she enjoys herself there. *shop and shop and shop till she drop* i went there once. it was magnificent. the food and culture. have you ever seen claypot rice being cooked in charcoal, dozens of them at one go. by just one elderly cook. now, that's skill. still can't forget the taste. after what, 4 years. time seemed to passed so fast. gecko soup. snake meat. roasted goose. some of the many food dtuff you can find. of course, not forgetting the portugese egg tarts. wonderful. maybe sometime in the future, i might go there once again, as my sister did.  rushed through breakfast today. had to make it to see instr tony for something. but in the end, i still couldn't make it. haiz. *sad* missed them so much. and who says only evonne crazy over them. well, the 23rd having their hell week. i wish them luck(saw a cute blue hippo softtoy my sister just bought) haha.so, i got lots of time to get to choa chu kang mrt then. the passing scenery, never fails to intrigue me, making me ponder about some stuff. songs played by my discman just added the feeling of loneliness. yet, i seemed happy.&nbsp;i have no idea why. waited for ching lin there, then came along ting xi and liying. i never talked alot to them. i just stand there, followed when i supposed to. paid for their taxi fare. well, its a man job right. heh. xue pin's school carnoval was somehow like mine. had games which were lame, songs and dedication, food and all. it was a hot day. and i just found out that jia min house was opposite the school. woah.  walking, walking, saw some ncc people whom i obviously dao-ed. met xin ren and his frind, both padi divers. speaking of diving, i want go during the national day holidays. haha! too bad people. hmm. pent about 1 plus hour there, just walking and stoning. (till now, i haven't spoken to ting xi, a unfamilar person to me. shyness at work) okay. she's fine la. no discrimination! serious. though she likes a particular someone, whom i obviously hate. csms. sheesh. *no offense to people who are csms though* went back ome with liying. talked to her about a lot stuff. problems of mine. literature. hey. i knew about non-ryhming poems! haha. except, i don't know how to produce them. tuesday.  now, at home. works fine for me. social studies homework later. a practically normal sunday, except with a bit of carnival spice added. physics omework included too.   it strikes you. without you knowing it. it brings aches, problems, and the power to heal.- me  &nbsp;

      bleahz. i am so drowsy today. early in the morning already so tired. school was worse, as usual. (okay. dad's nagging at me doing this thing. "only three months! stop all this" ( -_-") okay i will stop!) social studies lesson was interesting. supposedly, there was a test on population of singapore. apparently, mrs chee forgotten about it completely! she came in, and when everyone was preparing to take out their foolscaps, she suddenly said, "have we gone through the second question of your previous class test?" she didn't even see the notice on the board. of course, the class yi kou tong sheng, said no, marist spirit at work you see, even jason, the gaui kia in the class, suddenly rushed to the board, and pretended to clear the whiteboard, which in fact, cleaned off the notice of the test. such a smart move i never expect from jason. haha.  class went on. its funny how teachers can change thier faces in a second. miss jaz, came in with a black black face, meaning not happy. i wonder how, she suddenly cheered up after talking to us. 4f sure works wonders! can it be? that feelings can be as unpredictable as radioactive decay of some unstable nuclei? like... radon 222?! as wad ah chia siad, radiation takes place randomly, over time and space, and direction. perhaps feelings are like radiation, emitted by the decay of some stuff in our body? haha. go figure.  anyway. its pass out day plus 5. slowly, my friend. slowly. the feeling will pass. tomorrow;s my dive trip! wish me best, and hope i don;t catch a cold. it would land me in deep shit. okay. cheerios my dear reader. guess what, i'm in love again! haah. that's what i think only. still unsure. lolx.  time has its ways. to torture. to tease. to pleasure. to sadden. to love. so many things time can do. but time has time to do them all?- me

      now i begin to see what smiles brings to people. you see, the make people feel more homely, more welcomed. rather than seeing the black, monotone face of yours, just smile, and you bring warmth to their hearts. got a first hand experience. yesterday, went for a pool dive. at outram sec. where else can you go to do your pool dive man.. besides the expensive and savy acs barker road one. stupid buggers. flithy rich students. anyway, the dive master who was in charge of my "refresher" course, never quite smiled. i began to not like her from the start i saw her already. damn. hopes she gets DCI during the trip boy. *evil laughs*  the pool dive caused me to be late for tuition last night. had tuition only for like, 30 minutes of the supposedly 2 hours. right. i was that late. yay! going for my dive trip this friday evening. going to meet more friends i hope, friendly friends. *smiles* anyone who wants something from tioman be it a shirt or whatsoever, please sms me! i promise to get you something!  its passing out day plus 4. four days have passed. the feeling is still there. the lingering feeling of sadness, yet happiness, contradictory you see. on the surface, you see us, smiling at the juniors. but on the inside, we really want to go back, to oversee everything. this incident happened on tues. i was walking to the porch. suddenly someone called out my name. it was a part b by the name of gregory, if i'm not wrong. he said, "you all pass out already right? can call you name already hor." i nodded. he nodded. then he says good bye and waved. i waved back. things happen so fast. i was in his shoes once. waving to my senior. years passed so fast. memories flood back now and then. in the night. in the day. where i'm alone, i see all these beautiful images in my head. no matter what, these people will remain in my head. as people i relied on for so many things. i hope, the unit, with the new leadership, will be able to scale greater heights. i so very hope. and guys, i will be watching you. *watching you........*  number one uniform i returned. without major tan kb-ing. haha. i had to part with my dive pin. someday or another, i will be reunited with you my precious, i promise. *my precioussssss*(imitating smigel) if anyone wants to see the pop pictures, and of course, the very suave ex-csm of the unit in action,  urlLink www.pop2004.blogspot.com  its quite erm, funny would be the word. haha. cheer up dudes.  the smiles people have on their faces are actually two sided if they are just smiles. an eye smile, is one that is true.- me

      standing there. with my 18 good friends. my mates. my buddies i counted for support. people i so very cherished. as they are the ones that accompanied me through my four years. they endured hardships, pains, smiles, tears, laughs, and everything wih me. for that, i extremely honoured. i thank you, my good friends, who made my life in ncc, a unforgttable one. i honour you guys, your faces, your everything. you all have seen me through so many things, spurred me on. i thank you once again my friends. we marched in, with the stupid song playing. speeches were given in honour of us, dog tags were given to us. we marched past. and for the last time together, my friends, we persu-right. decommisioned and dismissed. our final steps together, left, right, left. we shouted, BARRAUCUDAS, for the last time together, at the top of our voices, and finally, threw our berets into the air without the fear of it on the floor. we let out our voices of excitement. feelings were overwhemled. wines sprayed all over. funny spraying things. and we raped each other. how can i ever forget my dear friends. i love all of you.  if you can recall my friends, 3 and a half years ago, about that time, we were small, puny, self-centre bastards, bespectacled some of us were and now, where we stood yesterday, was the exact postiton where we had our selection. it seemed like yesterday. years passed so fast. do you remember? well, i do. we reported at 2.30pm. at the primary school field. joesph and me, plus clement, were the three hopefuls from class 1 i. we sat there, on the stands, awaiting the arrival of the sec 3s(the pioneers), the instructos whom i learned to look up to, people who i respected with time to come. what we did, was nothing i ever did before at that time. me, a very weak person, with no courage or whatsover, had little chances to enter this unit. the candidates were put throug various of physical tests. push ups, runs, situps. everything we could, we did. not with gusto i promise you, but the mentality of a kid, who wanted to give up so very badly. weather wasn't what you called perfect. it was raining, and the place was muddy. when the rain stopped, LTA terence teo, another person whom i hold in regard but left the unit, cam to us and said, "now we do situps." i was utterly shocked. in the mud, yes. we ran, to the spots, lay down, and continued with our tests, as i try desperately to bring my arms to my knees, emmaunel wong, the asm lower that time, forced me to carry on. i thank you for that. Guan hao, the boat spec, big in size, and big in heart, led us for the run. i was stryggling to catch up. for me, that time, one round was already enough for me. we ran, and ran.  suddenly, my father emerged from the shadows. he came, telling me my sister's chin was hurt in a rugby match. he wanted me to bring me home. i complied, but suddenly telling my father no in the car. i wanted to become a barracuda. i wan't ready to go home like that. so i went back to the place, and i ran again. at seven pm. my interview with the co(terence teo) began. my legs were shaking by that time. the runs were taking its toll. he asked the first very question," why do you want to join the ncc?" i replied. "i want to be ready for national service sir!" that was when the specs said wow, sarcasticly. he carried on to ask many other questions. i was starting to lose hope as i relaised i was no good enough. then suddenly, he told me, "okay, xuan sheng, go take your form and pass it up on monday. welcome to the barracudas."  the feelings at that time was un describable. i tell you, it was one of the best moments of my life, my good friend. did you had the same feeling as me? i guess so.  my ncc life was so full. the first sea com i went, the atmosphere was so warming. the part a camp. boat management course. school's part a and b camp.my first sea com which i participated and won third place. orinteering com. mstd. spec crse. bbaq. rike. bdc. so many memories. so many thoughts. so many regrets. i thank you people for making that happen. i thank you. as i sat on the bus yesterday, my emotions i couldn't control as i let down a tear of mixed feelings. it went down my cheek, from the corner of my eye. i wiped it, and smiled. a new beginning awaits my good friend.  special thanks to joesph, my good ol sec 1 and 2 ncc buddy who went together with me for most of the things. clement, who provided me with laughter, and helped me along since sec 1. phillip, a person i confide in, with so much things, and solutions he gave me, the support he tried to give since sec 3. kenneth, whom i not really liked, but in the end, i still love him, because he gave me the motivation to do better in everything i did. and so many other people whom i want to thank. its because of them that i am here.  never shall i forget the past. my good friends. its my honour working with you all, barracudas, the 2001 batch, 1st company, third intake. nemo me impune lacessit.- us.

      well, i just settled down with my everything. came back from my training with freddy. crazy i tell you. swim abit then run for a while can kill me already. what about the real thing man. i'll just drop dead!  anyway, while walking to the toilet to bathe, i was talking to freddy about things, like training and stuff, suddenly he tells me he wants to be in the national cycling team when he grows up. out of nowhere, something just zoomed into my mind. i told him, i want to make milions, take the money, buy a yacht. a medium sized one, where i can sleep comfortably, walk around comfortably, have meals, sleep nicely. a cosy refuge out at sea, i call home. i want it to be so nicely designed. the yacht's hull has a part where is made of bulltet-proof glass, to view the underwater scenery, that is when i'm not diving under. the back of the yacht has a open area, meant to be a wet area, for diving purposes. a shower with it too. inside, air-conditioned, funrnished to perfection. a air compressor, to fill up my tank's air, everything is there, along with my scuba equipment.  i want to bring it all around the world, experience the waters i have never seen. to every part of the world. that will be how i'll spend my life in the future. that's my biggest dream. though its abit impossible, the difficulty so high, i hope it will be made real one day. one day i hope. and, i also wish, there will be a partner, who believes in my dream, sharing this dream of mine, and together, we set out on our life-log journey, just the two of us, and the big ocean. i so very pray.  as to now, i just want to study hard for my Os. to put in 100% ffort into the shit. another small step to my dream.  "what's with life," i say.- me

      study. study. mug mug. for my prelims which comes in four weeks. so little time. i just realised it. it scares me that time passes so fast. i rememeber, when i was in sec 3, i was still talking my senior, telling him four weeks still very long. i now understand his problems, as its mine now. how many hours into the night. how many hours. can i really put down all the distractions, just concentrating on my work? i don't know, my friend. there's just so many things to weigh me down.  i just hope, after the triathlon, i would be able to really put in 100% effort into my studies. even then, it will be quite late. but better laste than never they say. i really hope, my friend.  later, going to east coast park, for some training. a run and a swim. biking perhaps. but most likely not. i've made up my mind, not to tell her. no one else. yeah. that will remain with me.  nothing else to say today.

      i feel so dejected. i feel so helpless. i feel so usless.  i just want to run away my life. its becoming more hell like. i had put in so much effort, just that i am more intellectually challenged, i get such a result. the wrold doesn't give you back what you deserve.  a terrible b3 i had. the teacher came in during reccess, looking furious. he then shouted in chinese, " you all. this class is the worst class. having four failures and only two distinctions! even j class also did better." upon hearing the news, you could see the faces, dejected, disappointed. some already on the brink of tears. i think, we just held it back. one by one, the class came out, looking at the result, signing it. how i wished, i didn't pick up the pen to sign, to verify. i want to run away from it.  all i needed was a distinction. how difficult could it get. why can;t you guys just give it to me. stupid RI students. how i hope they would just die off, giving us poor folks some chnace in getting better grades. its because of you bastards, you clever bastards that i'm getting these shit results. die.  prelims are in 4 weeks. chinese have to be retaken. whcih means studying for chinese starts agian. more time, so much time wasted on it. i just want to be with the sea now, just the sea waves and me, together with my scuba equipment. just diving. how i wished. now, everyone seeing the grim reality of the o levels. hadn't it been said that it was going to be easy? why. why.  i'm now listening to the song by jay chou, wai po. realised its relating to me. i'm not disappointed because i lost. its because i let my parents down. i just need someone to motivate me. someone that cares and i care for. someone i already wished for. you only need love to understand.  can a person future be really determined by his results? what if he just can't show them. he's dead in the world. the world is just too evil. i want to escape from it all. help me. help me.  evil's the word to describe us. the describe the world. pain is the word to describe the people. make sense? it doesn't.- me

      yep. the village. the show that got everyone's tongue going. you have to agree, night, the director, sure has his way of making movies. one of a kind, you have to agree man. the show, suddenly got a scence that comes out of nowhere, makes you feel that woah. where did this come from. but, its also a bit lame la. night could improve on it though. no further comments.  anyway. when everyone's keeping mum, let me tell you something. don't always trust the people you respect. they may be the ones that decieve you. and sometimes, things are just on the surface. these are two morals i got out of the movie. *grins* moral of the movie. haha  she dresses well la. no doubt about that. haha. i'm still feeling drowsy, blur blur. maybe its the side effect of having too much ramily burgers, or taking in too much compressed air, or maybe its nitrogen narcosis from the deep dive i made, or it could just be me being tired out.  i just want go diving again. i wanna conquer tioman! with a rescue certification. *smiles*  join your tears with love.- windstruck ost

DIVED! ater was too cold la. otherwise it woulde be perfect. the day, spent just on diving, and eating. getting too lazy already. haha. completed my night dive. which contributed to my certification of my advance. next day, deep dive first. all the way to 30 metres. water too cold. 25 degress. FREEZING! haha. dive and dive and dive. eat and eat and eat. the itinery for the three days i was there. cool right. yep! want to do that again, soon i hope.  i love all the people i went with. great memories they provided! hope i can see them soon, or better, dive with them again.  diving, no words can be expressed about the sport.- me

      its the lunar seventh month. practically, almost all the chinese has started to offer incense paper offerings, burning them in the containers provided by the authorities.  my dad, a strong believer in the after-life, has influenced me too, to believe in this beliefs he has. a combination of taoist and buddhist teachings, make up my family's religion. so, you can expet us to be quite superstitious at times. my dad and mum, started the rituals yesterday. i wanted t go along with him downstairs, to burn the offerings, too bad i had homework, which forbidded me to go along. one other thing that made me so interested in all these, is the spectacular performance made by the cracking flames. it never fails to amaze me with its art of moving. a fire never's the same with another. its all difference, like a human's fingerprint, never identical. amazing isn't it.  it starts. with the lighting of joss sticks, praying in the four directions, later chucking it into the ground. followed by the candles, which are red in colour. a small portion of our dinner is also offered, so with tea leaves and some crackers. my mum never allows me to have a go at them. says its not edible. ha. the offering of the papers follows. about 5 small stacks of different types of incense paper are burned. the samll amount of carbon and pollutants produced can never be compared to what the industrial world is emitting. a few minutes of these fires, may be equivalent to just a few seconds of the mountainous clouds of black smoke produced by the burning of fossil fuels and oil wells. so, don't you go telling us off about the environmental issues. i will hit your head. *smack* ita ll ends after ten minutes of heat, and most of the time, tears. can't prevent it. smoke always enters the eyes. that's the only bad thing. oh yes. and you smell of smoke too. haha.  changing over the years, what have i got in the end?- me

      haha. just caught friends on television. they never fail to make me laugh. especially joey's blur like sotong expressions, ross's slow reactions, and chandlier's jokes(not very sure how his name is spelt).  haiz. each day passes, closer it gets to the prelims, and ultimately, the Os. how many hours i waste, i feel so very guilty of. time is now so important. rushing for it i should be. i promise myself, i will change. change myself, for the better. i will get the results i want. i can, and i will. as long there is determination, i shall my foot out to prove others wrong.  naval divers has this saying, " whatever happens, just suck it in." this temporary setback, i will take and absorb as a lesson. it shall prove to be my stepping stone into the highlands of the unknown. my life awaits, shining so ever brightly.  no more time would be wasted on doing nothing. it should be used to do at least something beneficial to myself, regardless the nature of it. as of the things that weighs my body down, sprirtually, mentally, physically, overcome them i will. hopefully, hopefully, my friend.  trying to get the triathlon out of the way. in another two weeks. leaves me about 2 training sessions at east coast park. a few sessions at the pool, tracks, and the bike. i don't even know whether i can make it, needless to say, encouraging my two friends to keep up. my limitaions will be reached that day. pain will be ignored. humilation will be present too. that will be prove to be another examination for me. as i have done so this few years, in school, suffering at the hands of humilation. embarassment, some incidents were. made me tougher they had, make me weaker to compliments they also did.  i envy people, who has people in love with them, as they are in the other. so happy together. when would it be my turn, to hold a person in my arms, looking into the sky together, or take a stroll along the fountain of wealth at suntec city, enjoying the night colours of the performances being held, hand in hand. when, i ask. if i ever have the chance, to be blessed with a opportunity, to tell that person, i would give it up. sometimes, if things are meant to be, they will be, i would rather not affect the relationship i now have with the person. its better this way.  live in the bottom of the waters. there alone is independence. there alone, i recognise no masters.- me

      woke up at ten thirty.  had breakfast at eleven fifteen.  studying and revising since eleven forty five. that is until three. was lectured by my sister during this time. reason: i was not doing the correct way of revising. i mean, what else you want me to. i know time's short, but things have to taken one step at a time. i'm just not that yet. okay. caught the repeat telecast of national day parade on channel eight, whilst talking to liying online. we talked about the chinese Os, how easy was it to get a distinction, and all sorts. back to the tv, caught the naval diving unit's colours! was damn excited. jumping up and down i was, screaming, yelling in excitement. i think i'm becoming the next evonne. the navy contingent was damn cool, with naval divers in it of course.  anyway. the parade commander, woah. too many wings on his chest. haha. two local badges and one foreign wing pin. plus a few medals. haha. he looked damn cool. the 2nd parade commander was just a lieutanant. and he got so many pins! wings, on his right and left, and the pin i respect most. the grade 58(i think) combat diver. (its the one in grey colour with the star) i so admire that guy. *hopes to be like him one day* haha. one thing i noted. SAF do hormats different with ncc. they don't shoot out their hands. strange, but true.  anyway. the day's spent, quite fruitfully. i think this will be a typical day with time to come. revision, revision, mugging.  "the adults don't get it. or grandma wants is your company. not your six hundred dollars,"- jay
