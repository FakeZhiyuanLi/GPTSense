      Watching the end of the Today show...  Monitoring my work email, but not aggressively working today.  I've pretty much checked out for the July 4th holiday.  I have a few things to do this week, but not a whole lot.  I could find lots of work to do, but without them having deadlines, I'm not too motivated.  Yesterday, the tile installers were supposed to come put in new flooring in my bathrooms.  They didn't show up.  They are supposed to be here today, but it's almost 10:00 am and they are still not here.  I'll give them till 10:15 before I call the company and see where they are.  I think they had to swing by Home Depot to pick up the supplies first, so I'll give them a little leeway.  I'm headed to the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night for some vacation.  Four nights in Seattle, then 3 in Vancouver, then 1 back in Seattle before flying back home to Dallas.  I'll spend some time in the city, but plan on getting out into the surrounding country as much as I can too.  I intend on exploring they Olympic peninsula, Mt. Ranier area, Victoria, and a few other places.  Plus a little city nightlife to divert my attention some.  OK, the tilers arrived just now...  so I'll keep my fingers crossed.

      I've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting one together.  I'll be curious to see if this changes my life any.  I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now, but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me, that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- "Ho Red".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.  There is still minor color differentiation, but you can't really see it that much.  I'm probaby the only one that would notice them.
