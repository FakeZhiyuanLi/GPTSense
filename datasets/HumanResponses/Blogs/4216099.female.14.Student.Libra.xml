       This is my favorite lyrics of all time..bye Poison The Well. Please read them very slowly and carefully and take them em...let me know how you feel about em.. It describes so much..    " Kisses  are never safe when residue of old  love  is left how could I feel  lesser  when someone  better  walks around  waiting  for you to call out As your cold hand  grasps  mine I feel unright and  privileged  to be able to look in your  eyes  same chemical as stars Deformed fingers  leave  trails of  hearts  in writing could  three  words be the  end  to births only meaning  Crying  to sleep is my  remedy  urgently trying to stand on broken confused legs Am I looking for  reasons  not to be happy  emotions  catch up with me I'm  too fast  for them.."

       Hey peeps,   Lets see...I have been doing basically close to nothing since Sunday.... Ive been working out a lot and now my tummy, arms, and my should back muscle things hurt =/ Oh well..at least im getting in shape. I need to stop sitting around, eating all day. But i guess thats what ya do in summer when you have to sit at home. Thats why i kinda want school to start. So i only eat once a day and i walk and move more. And also to see my friends. Hey school starts in 5 days OMG! lol. Thats cool. Monday me n my family went to Khols and spent 200 dollars there. I bought 2 shirts, a new purse, earings, rings, some kickass underwear..and thats about it. Then we wnet out to eat. On Tuesday i had to get up early and me and nick went to get our schedules together. He stayed the same..but ive noticed that ive changed alot...=/ its wierd. But i did have fun seeing him. He was really funny. We blasted Ludacris and it was just real fun. We got our schedules and teh whole school is a mess! LOL. I guess everyone is gonna go to Gathering Grounds Friday around 8. Im gonna go from 8-11:30 probably with all my friends. EVERYONE GO SUPPORT PANKAKE! Nick is gonna drive me and everything =) im so glad we hang out now! He's great. Even though i found out he did alot of shit while he was dating me...its just so hard to believe it. I dunno if i want to date him again or not but i still have initial feelings for him..oh well, we'll just have to see where this takes us. I guess Brandy saw Amanda The First at school for schedules and ive been thinking that amanda hates me cuz she hasnt called me in 2 weeks...but she told brandy to tell me that she has been grounded off the phone, that she was sorry and shes not mad. So i guess were gonna continue with whatever. It was just so wierd. Cuz we were talking every night. We did alot at the attic and we "bonded" through everything. Then i dont hear from her at all for 2 weeks? it was just wierd. But im glad were cool now. I talked to Marlys but all she ever talks about is her BFF Chasity whom they had their fisrt experience togetehr the other night. I know that Marlys is in love with Chasity..i know..and that sucks but whatevr..what can you do? lol. And the other two hotties that ive been talking too..(their just my friends people) Marissa and Amanda Gregg. Thier awesome. But other than that..i still need to go to DDR with thomas, and Kyle. I have to make arrangments with Tony cuz im using his locker today. I guess me n nick will be closer this friday. Um.....tommorrow my dad is getting DENSERS! OMG lol. And my lil bro has to go pick up his schedule at VB. Yup..so i have to make all these plans cuz i need to have a blast in these last days of summer =(....i need some fun.and i need to hook up with someone =O   Well see what happens..   Later   love~amandaTheSecond      BOBBY OBVIOUS "someday"   "YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FELL FOR YOU, IF YOU DID YOU'D LOVE ME TOO! THERES ONLY ONE THING I HAVE TA SAY, I AM GONNA GET YOU SOMEDAY!"   My half-brother Cory(lives in Manchester) has a punk band called Bobby Obvious...this used to be me and the RTA's song. Only a few people know who the RTA is..but whatever. This lyric is sent out to a special someone. It could BE YOU! =)

       Wow..i've been having a most rather pleasant time in the past week... i mean once i get my mind off the negative shit then i feel a hell of a lot better. Ive played DDR for the past 2 nights with my brother..and im going again tonight(Friday) im gonna ask thomas and brandy to go..and maybe Nick. YAY! Its gonna be fun. Then tommorrow im either gonna go to a party since the asian just got back from vietnam...or the attic to see pankake play once again...I need to support em cuz theyr fuckin amazing..brad might hate me but i still love his band lol. Im glad that ice and rabbit are still cool with me tho. And Eze...does he ever hate anyone? lol...and then theyr new dude Ean or somethin..ive never talked to him..he dates jesse...he seems like a brilliant addition to the band tho. They have progressed alot..and thats great. Lets see...sunday and monday ill probably make time for me and nick to go on a date or something alone..cuz we wanna kinda hangout and see if we still have valid feelings for each other...then maybe well become commited =) i hope..lol. Hes such a great guy..and i miss him alot. Then Tuesday me n nick are gonna go pick up our schedules...YIPEE! lol..dude none of us sophmores or freshman even have to go to school the second day lol..thas funny! Um.. last night LIL'T' spent the night. I swear that kid is here every other day. i talked to ****..i was kinda jealous and pissed cuz her bff Chasity who she lives with down in *****..well they fucked or something. And #### told me that i was the only chick she ever liked or somethin..and now shes fucking some other chick..thas fucked up. UM... so i was kinda pissed off last night so that mad her mad and she said "look ill just call you tommorrow" i said "yea go fuck your new gf..and im gonna be gone for a while so ill call you whenever i get back..maybe in a month or so" then we hung up...i was just pissed...oh well. Um..lets see. OMG.

OMG hes my sisters bf's roomate who's like 17 and he has lip and nipple piercings...UHHHH thats so hot!=) lol... neways...but really what i want right now is to date Nick..cuz hes the only one i know and who makes me happy. If we date its gonna be like a continuation. Almost like we took a 7 month vacation..and then returned. Cuz everything is the same except we havnt been dating lol. Its wierd..um..yes..Man...me and my bro and LILT came up with our excuse and motto for everything..it is "we need to get laid." lol. Whenever we do something stupid...we all get quiet..and say "Dude..we need to get laid" lol haha. OH WELL..im just a sex deprived bitch.
