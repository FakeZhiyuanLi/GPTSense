      Wow, what a nice concert. The Texas A&M small ensemble class was performing some classical pieces and one contemporary classical as I might say today in St. Mary's Catholic Church. I was first bored to death hearing the "not-so-coherently-played" flutes, clarinets, oboe and stuff played at the beginning of the concert. Just as I was thinking of leaving the concert, well I was also trying to decide whether I'm going to kneel and making a cross sign when I leave or not since I was in the church, but not in a mass, so there I was sitting so everly confused and bored with all those tutty-futty flutes and clarinets. Then just as I build my strength to get up, the music proffesor introduce the last group of ensemble, which is the "TROMBONE ENSEMBLE". I was like, WOOOWWW, forget the kneeling, forget me leaving, cause I'm staying..urrgghhh, I'm so boring. Then!!!, this trombone ensemble start to play, man, eight trombone players, set like a whole orchestra with the high, middle, and low arrangement thing. GODD, the play took me back to my junior and high school time. I remember just how fun it was to play my trombone with thw whole brass section....anyway, the last repertoire thay played was a jazz music. Ok, it's jazz and trombone, together, heck, I'm staying till the end of the show. Maybe I should've read the program before the show, anyway, the piece was perfect. I was clapping, without thinking like when I was deciding to kneel or not. Then, I went to talk with one of the trombone player. So then I decided, I'll take the class this summer, however, I still have to look for a slide trombone, since my trombone is a valve kind. Shoot, I wish my birthday was in May.

      Two days ago, thesis was done and bound at Kinko's right after leaving from the lab. Then impulsively went to Houston at 11 PM after a bowling game, score 135 (sucks), just to find a restaurant that is still open pass 10 PM, other than IHOP or McD.

       A Song     urlLink This song  was created earlier this year. I played the piano in the intro and the solo piano part. When my friends and I recorded this we didn't use a metronome, so the tempo changes are all over the place,hahha, we just recognize this thing when we try to add some more layer on the files without knowing the exact tempo, that was a real headache.

       Not the only one    Yesterday was my father's birthday. How do I know it? He sent me an e-mail two days ago stating he will be 53 on July 29th. Then I replied the email by sending an e-card and tried to changed the sending date to two days earlier so to make it looks like I remember his birthday but of course there's no way to do it (what kind of a child am I???) Then I talked to him and he said he even forgot about it himself until my mom called him and remind him that was his birthday. Right there and then I told him I also forgot about it and said "hah..I'm not the only one who forgot about it." What a nice kid!!

      Tarombo&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Went to St. Mary this Monday cause I haven't been there for about three weeks or more. The theme that day was about honoring grandparents. So at the end of the sermon this new priest I don't even know his name told us to say in our heart the name of our own grandparents. Now I see a problem. I only know my paternal grandmother. I've never met my mother's parents and my father's father. I'm trying really hard to remember any of their names. I remembered my father's grandfather's name, Johannes, which is really rare for an Indonesian name. I think it's because at that time Catholic has become a common religion in the area where my father came from so they started using their baptist name. So I went home while trying hard to remember my grandfather's name. Today, while browsing at my sister's happily neglected web site, I found this Tarombo, which is the family tree from my father's side. So I hurriedly look at the name of my grandfather, I read it and I found it to be another european name, but right next to it his Indonesian name is written in parenthesis, Raja Doli, which is my middle name. Since I came to America, I've never used my middle name anywhere, or just put an initial anytime I need to fill a form requiring my middle name, so it's been five years not hearing people calling me with my middle name, except whenever I meet this Brazilian friend of mine who calls me by my full name everytime we meet. But I hardly ever meet that guy anymore. Now I remember that my father told me when I was a kid that my grandfather gave me his name. I used to ignore that story, but now I see the story in totally different way.

       Hah?   I've been getting three emails with the same link http://www.jibjab.com from three different friends from three different countries to see the cartoon about the presidential election stuffs in America. Why is it so popular? I can never understand politic although I know one can never avoid politics. I hope I can use the line from the Casablanca everytime I'm aggravated by any kind of politics, "Take your politics out of here, I'm trying to run my business." or something like that, hahahahaha, love that movie.

       David Sedaris: the Antonia Vardalos of Best-Selling Author   Growing up, I'm never good with people's name. I used to address all my teachers by the subject they're teaching, Miss Biology, Mister Math and stuff. It's not that I don't respect my teachers, but it's just hard to remember people's name that you don't see at least 12 hours a day. I don't even know the name of those new emerging bands whose songs I like and remember all the lyrics. When somebody told me a joke about how you can get around when you meet an old friend but forgot their name, so you say "..so how do you spell your name" and your old friend would say " B O B ", and you say " ahh...I thought there was a hidden M there", I was thinking of using it whenever I meet old friends without having any idea of what their names are. However, there is an exception on this bad habit of mine after I finished reading "Me Talk Pretty One Day" by David Sedaris. This book is so hilarious that whenever I found myself laughing in the lab while waiting for some experiments, I turn to the first page and read the author's name again "so what's his name?". After finish readig the book, I've been rereading the author's name for hundreds of time, hence I can finally remember the author's name. And while reading another book written by this author, I figured out his family has major resemblance to the family in the "My Big Fat Greek Weeding" movie by Antonia Vardalos. No wonder I like this book a lot.

       How did I forget all this?    urlLink    aromatic alkane conformation and stereoisomers naming for chiral carbon  &nbsp; urlLink     As I go through my old notes on organic chemistry, I found an interesting thing in the way I'm thinking. As I remember, when I took the class all I care was to memorize them before I take the exam on the next day, now as I'm rereading the material I'm wondering of how long did it take for Chan, Ingold, and Peng to analyze the chirality of alkane to come up with their stereoisomers naming system and what analysis method did they use to figure out. And also how much research on the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in measuring the stability of one molecule conformation and how do they come up with the idea that the stability of a molecule depends on their conformation.   Ooo, Maroon5 and John Mayer will perform tomorrow in Houston, rgghghhhh too late to buy some (cheap) tickets...rggghhhh.

       St. Louis Vs.&nbsp; Chicago Cubs     &nbsp;  Went to Shane's house to watch the game with James, Seungju and Jamie. Shane grilled some german sausage, which really tastes so heavenly with a hint of german beer, I can't remember what the sausages are called. I brought some tiramisu I made yesterday with the wrong type of cheese.&nbsp; ( I used ricotta instead of mascarpone) but it still taste good, or so they said.&nbsp;Turned out Sara loves tiramisu a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went home and finally something motivated me to open that storage door to dig my organic, physical and analytical chemistry old stuffs. I need to brush up on these subjects before the Chemistry PhD orientation next month. Dialkyl-ether-dendrimer-aromatic-eigenvalue-wavefunction*&amp;%^$ crap here I come!!!

       Webcamchat    &nbsp; Yayang introduced me to MSN chatting with webcam on after a couple of line saying his and how are yous to each other with the usual chatting mode. Well, they say picture paints a thousand word, and the monitor shows at least 24 frames of pictures per second so that it is viewable to human eyes. 24 times 1000 times whatever seconds you spend webcamchatting, I guess that's a more effective way to express yourself. So these pics show how I express myself to her for about ten minutes. It feels good if you can still make fun of yourself.

       Do people live in one place anymore?    &nbsp; Got up at 11 in the morning, Erik called, he is moving to Austin so I helped him with the moving frenzy. Drove to Austin in a U-Haul. One of the tires on Erik's car exploded in the Bastrop area. Got back to College Station, went to Revolution for Inok's farewell night. Too muddy and hot, music was not that enjoyable. Then went to IHOP, found it not really crowded, that's good. Yupe, it's the time of the semester that people say goodbyes to old friends and hellos to new friends. I wish all the lucks to all my friends who's leaving to places for the new beginning of their careers and lifes. "WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE COLLEGE STATION",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know.

       I named it "It's Thursday and I'm Hungry" entree,     &nbsp;   Preparation  : 5 minutes  &nbsp;   Cooking  : 15 minutes  &nbsp;   Enjoying  : Inverse relation with hungriness  &nbsp;    How to  :&nbsp;    Sautee some sliced pepperonis or any other type of meat that has good fat content so that once they're sauteed up they will release oils with nice flavor  Cover some shrimps, amount undecided, with olive oil, garlic powder, pepper, salt, nutmeg, soy, and any other marinating liquid you might feel like to use but&nbsp;don't peel&nbsp;the shrimp&nbsp;cause all the flavor&nbsp;are in the skin.  Once the peps and shrimps look happy (bam!) add some green bellpepper and some vegetable ( those with lots of leaves types of vegetable), after chopping them into bite sizes.  Beat two eggs together and put into the pep, shrimp, bellpepper and vegetable mix. Add some more seasoning if you like. If you have limes, squeeze half of the lime to get the juice right on top of the sauteeing stuffs, just to give a bit of a kick!  Look around in your fridge, if you have some cheese (laughing cow cheese is the best) throw some of them into the pan just before you turn the heat off so they melt beautifully.  In another pan, steam some baby carrot. (have this thing steaming at the beginning of the step)  To serve, get a bowl, put some of the steamed baby carrot (without the steaming water),&nbsp;amount undecided, and on top of them put the sauteed pep, shrimp, bellpepper, vegetable and egg from&nbsp;the other pan.  Optional: For crispiness, if you have any tortilla&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;in your fridge, broil them in the oven at 400 F for about 5 minutes or until they're really crispy. Do this sometimes before you finish sauteeing the meats and vegetable.  Pop up&nbsp;a bottle of beer or get a glass of wine or milk or water, turn off the heat in the stove and the oven, find your TV remote, turn to FoodTV Channel and start eating while watching one of those masters cooking their own food.     I'm telling you, you can almost&nbsp;taste what they're cooking if you have something to eat while you're watching one of those shows.  Now if I can just make a desser to be named &nbsp;"Can I&nbsp;Have&nbsp;Two Cups of &nbsp;Sugaah, Baby".  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       The 6th Floor   Last month somebody in the 6th floor of Richardson killed himself. My lab is in the 9th floor, which means everyday I passed the 6th floor using the elevator. Since I'm a chemical engineering student, while most of the people in Richardson are petroleum student, I don't know what really happened to the guy. Last night around 10 PM, I dropped by the lab to get some samples to do SEM on and left the lab around 11 PM. When I got into the elevator I looked at the digits indicating the floor you're passing on the elevator door. Somehow, I started to think about the incident as I watch the digits changing and it has been a habit for me to count the floors all the way to where I'm going. So it went from 9, 8, 7 and then it stopped at 6. I waited as the elevator door slided open. I think I kind of close my eyes halfway and try to blur my vision so that I won't really absorbed the spookiness or any specter flying around, I know I felt really stupid. Than the door opened perfectly and a man came in. His feet touched the floor. I was like, pheew....hahaha. I asked him if he knew anything about the news, he said yes. He said all the people in that floor try not to go into the room used to be the guy's office. It's just a sad news for people to chose to stop their live for whatever reason. I know there are a lot of obstacles, pressures and other problems people encounter and we sure will in this life, but there should be some options, even just one option, for people to chose other than killing themselves to lessen the burden they're having.

       Procrastinatus ,  meaning pro: forward, crastinus: tomorrow (or some other time in my case)   I've been meaining to use the BET machine since last two weeks, however it was always used and a week ago it broke down, so I keep putting the experiment off for quite a while now. So now I'm waiting for Shane to come back from Germany to take a look at the machine. Until then, I can procrastinate on my experiment with a valid reason, huahuahuahua.   Today I felt like a dependable master student, hahaha, the feeling that I haven't felt lately, right after I defended my thesis. I had a good doze of X-Ray Diffraction discussion with John. I think I helped a bit and gave some comments from my research experience. Now that's what I called a good learning experience. Anyway, I think I'll head to rec center for a couple of laps in the pool and the running track, now that Dan is off to somewhere, weeeeeeee!!

       Low-Carb Madness   Has anybody noticed that almost all restaurant now have a special menu for the low-carb dieters, which for some of them it means taking the buns off the burger and keep the price unchanged. I guess it's like a fashion trend, this year it's the carbohydrate, next year it's fat, depends on any dietrician who comes up with a bestselling book on how to lost your weight. Anywayyyy, I tried the C2 coke today, or as I like to call it a- diluted-coke-with-an-equal-molar-of-water-added-into-the-regular-cola kinda drink. I guess now people won't fell guilty if they drink two can of C2 cokes at a time since that will be equal to one can of regular soda. What a great tactic to sell more sodas, I admire those marketing people,huahuhuahuahua.  Songs stuck in head: Heaven by Los Lonely Boys and Love's Divine by Seal. I've been trying to look for the CDs everywhere, well mainly in half price book store (being a poor graduate student :) ), and still I can't find it. Right now I'll just wait until one of the radio stations play the songs. Yesterday the song started playing as I parked my car. I just sit in the car until the song ended right in the parking lot. I do that a lot, hahahaha. Sometimes I wonder if that count as craziness.  Off to the lab... again!!

       I Had a Dream    After coming home from Houston last night, I was starving. I didn't have a chance to take my dinner before we went off to Houston. During the game I didn't buy any food in the stadium. Jamie brought a plastic bag full of candies that keeps all of us happy during the game (it's kinda slow for me and there only was one homerun by the Astros and they switch the pitcher, Clemens, in the middle of the game, but still it's interesting)So yesterday I just ate four candies, drank a bottle of milk and a bagel for lunch and one plate of egg salad after I got home. So I was pretty much starvig when I went to bed. Whenever I feel hungry while I'm sleeping, I always dream about eating some foods and wake up feeling even hungrier. Last night was kinda a different dream. I dream of eating my home country food with my family and I started eating the food with silverwear but after a while I use my hand to eat the food instead of the silverwear, and it felt really good. I guess I was hungry and homesick at the same time. The good thing is I'll get to visit my home country this fall, yeeee...great foods.
