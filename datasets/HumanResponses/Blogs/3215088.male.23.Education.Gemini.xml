      Woooooooo!!!!!!! THe Plane flown off liao......Raine PANG SEH me!! last minute say cannot go kayaking....anyway...slept till 2pm.  Today's fitness programme was very much similar to yesterday's. Just did 20 more full squats. My thighs quite stiff now. Had a very light ( in comparison to wat i used to eat ) dinner. Mee Sua. Mom dowan to cook today...so eat mee sua lor. Tummy already telling me something now liao ....  I've got another job lobang today. Fruit Juice seller in Taka. Friend is contact the boss for me... see how it goes lor. If successful, can learn to make juices out of the variety of fruits available while earn some spare dough.  I decided to try out the home-made ORT ( oral rehydration therapy) after the excercise to replenish the salt, sugar and water content. The taste is not bad. Quick rehydration solution. Dont under estimate this concoction cos it saved million of lives throughout the world for cases of malnutrition. Normally used for diarreah. Can also be used for cramps. Anyone wana try? The formula is 1 teaspoon of salt to 6 teaspoon of sugar for every 1 litre of water.  The taste is not bad siah ...taste very much like the glucose powder we buy off the shelf:P.......heehee...i can prepare the salt/sugar mixture in advance for future trekking trips liao....just pour it into the water and ready to use liao. By the way, this home made mixture cost less than 5 cents per litre while the ones used by the hospitals cost 10 cents due to the added vitamins.    looking at my room now, i am so PROUD that i am able to mess it up again after cleaning it last week. Guessed i had to clean it up again liao ....sianz  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Today is cooling with the Rain of the Month falling...  Yes!!! I've taken the first step towards regaining fitness. Though it rained the whole afternoon. The night was cooling to run and excercise. I went thru THIS!!!  1) Ran 2 km 2) 20 crunches 3) 10 side crunches on each side 4) 20 sets of step up excercises on the concrete benches under the flat. 5) Walked up the stairs on the way home instead of taking the lifts. 6) Tried doing leg raisers....cannot back too pain liao ...  Though this cannot be considered streneous but it is a good start. Now my head is getting giddy liao ......too long neber excercise liao... YUANYEE!!!! KEep it going tomolo!!! I will not go through the route of going on a "HEALTHY" diet to trim down. What's life without enjoying all the good food around me? I am doing our ancestors a big disfavour by not enjoying all the food they came up with. Just got to watch my diet, but not to the extreme.   Now is the sad event of the day. I've called the manager who offered me an interview. To my dismay, the job vacancy he offered does not suit me....or i should say i dont suit the job cos it requires technical skills. Neber mind, he will look out for other vacancies for me. In the meantime , just got to look for other jobs lor.  Tomolo going kayaking loh!!! The toopid woman raine changed the morning session to afternoon...well, its even better....now i get to sleep more.  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Today was quite a day with ups and downs. I've got a reply to go for a interview for a temp job. When i went there, the manager was out...suck thumb go home lor.  Then Raine, my kayaking buddy ( sis cos she is a girl), asked me to go kayaking on Friday. I wanted to go cos long since i last kayak liao .... But there's a catch to it. She have to leave early on that day. This means that i would be kayaking alone in the sea in East Coast. I dowan to kayak alone in the sea cos it's too dangerous liao. I am considering jioing the PKL gang to come along but i doubt many of them will be interested. They are more into inline skating and dragon boating:(  Am i so abnormal ??? How come the people i mix with are usually not into the activities i am into??? hmmm.....Nah.....i dont think so......most prob is that they are the abnormal ones!!!!! hahaha.... Sometimes i feel that i am too rational while on other occassions i am too rash to take part in activities...perhaps that's a trait of a gemini. Not sure cos i dont read into horoscope. I dont even know what are the horoscope signs available. Ignorant?? Perhaps. Maybe i just dont like to memorise things that i deemed insignificant.   Spent the night recollecting some special activities i had took part in the last 1 year. Taking up kayaking courses, going trekking to Berkelah Waterfalls, Mount Ophir and Gunung Panti, Volunteering for and leading a humanitarian project team to Cambodia, going Chionging with the PKLs, Taking up numerous courses, attending seminars and masterminding a creative presentation for my "Singapore's Foreign Policy's" tutorial.   For many of these activities, it was the moment of rashness that made me signed up. Through these activities, i have learnt many things about others and especially about myself. I am starting to believe in myself cos thru these activities, i successfully pulled through many obstacles that i neber think i can. Also understood that there are intrinsic gifts in me that i formerly doubt i would possess.   Remembering the Ophir trip where i managed to reach the summit with the help of my team mates, especially  Jones, Mel and Daniel cos it was the help and encouragement they gave me that made me moved on. More than 24hrs of pure physical suffering was what i went thru during the trip but it was well worth it. To think of it, i was the "idiotic ass" that came up with the suggestion of attempting Ophir. Now i understand the real meaning of mind over body.   The next activity that gave a huge impact to my life would be the Volunteering trip to Cambodia in Project Sangkhim. Volunteering was never in my blood considering i dont even bother cleaning up my room. Who will believe that i will volunteer? Definitely not myself. Once again rashness possessed me. Signed up for it and took over the leadership of the team under some weird circumstances. Met some friends in this trip. Learnt skills in planning and saw real life events in Cambodia. Perhaps, under my leadership and planning, some things did screwed up but i had learnt alot from it. I saw the desire within the own team to think creatively to solve problems we encountered in Cambodia. I learnt from it and that is how i mastermined the presenation in tutorial when we are back in Singapore. Never before this volunteering expedition would i believe that i would be able to plan such a project of this scale. Not to mention a team of 24 students , the coordination between organisations was also intense. It was indeed an achievement for the team and myself.   I have grown and matured through these activities. Perhaps rashness might not be bad afterall.    Just saw this Jap film about girls in japan training to become the Gaea Wrestlers. Motivated by it cos the training these girls went through is unimaginable. Tough Training. This girl went thru numerous obstacle just to Debut in a woman pro wrestling match.  I dont think NS is as tough as the training the girls went thru siah.  Today was indeed a meaningful day  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Finally!!! My first blog ....for a no lifer.   The life story of a NO LIFER starts today....no life......woke up and slacked the whole day. Called up the gang for a show, Kill Bill 2. It was good....but a bit not up to my expectation though, after watching the first episode of it. There wasn't much action and the cinematography was not as beautiful as the first episode. There is one interesting part though and that was the twist in the show where BB was alive afterall. The ending was not good....quite an abrupt ending in my opinion. KNN ( mind my language), i was expecting a big fight between Bill and Beatrice Kiddo....it ended within 10 seconds with the 5 something something heart explosion something ( forgot the name liao lah) move. Disappointing.   Went for supper with Mel and Kenneth at 107 kopitiam. Seeing Mel munching the plate of nasi lemak was indeed very tempting. But i had to endure!!! I dont feel FAT but i just dont feel good when the weight and lack of training has brought me to a level of fitness that i cannot accept....seriously hurt my self esteem with such fitness cos the only thing that i had in the past that can be considered my forte would be my fitness....i cant let it disappear. So after supper ( i oni drank soya bean drink) , i decided to walk home from the kopitiam. Feels good to walk home...long since i did that.   Hope i would not procastinate about trimming down in the next days  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Just got back from Saint Andrews Junior Schools leadership camp. It was definitely fun guiding the young kids in the activities. As usual, there are lots of problems handling kids cos they can neber sit still for a moment. Not even during the debriefs. But thru them i also got the chance to learn and practise skills on command and control and many other skills. The experienced instructors also guided me along when they saw that i have some problem in these areas and i greatly appreciated that. Guessed this is wat we call professionalism. We teach the students the essence of teamwork and i think the instructors led by example by working together as a team cos we had rather limited manpower in this camp.   What was most encouraging to me was that occassionally the kids applied what i have taught them during the camp. For instance, they were at wits end when they were supposed to give a performance duing campfire, largely due to their lack of teamwork during the preparatition. But within seconds before starting their performance, they decided to apply teamwork and abandon their orginal program and change it to a game tat was used to display teamwork that i taught them during the day. That is to sit on each other's thighs while standing up without any support. It may be a very simple activity and may seem boring to other on lookers, but i am very proud of them becos that showed that they have learnt the most important aspect of being a leader and a team player becos without team work, this activity cannot be successful. Perhaps i am too emotional but i really felt a great sense of being proud of them like a father seeing the his kids succeed. What was most encouraging to me was that the kids gave me a thank you card and commented to the school during the final goodbye that i am one of the best instructor to them in the camp. Maybe they are just being courteous but still i really appreciated that.    As the camp was all about leadership, my job is very much one of a trainer who facilitates and guides the leaders along. I believe in practice. Leadership is useless without practice therefore i very much left it to the leader of the team to plan his team whenever they need to complete a task. Guessed the idea of experiential learning had already been drilled into my head that i used this tool to guide the leaders along in every activity they did. Indeed it is a very powerful tool. I think the kids do have the potential of being a good leader, they just need to have more exposure. I wish them all the best.  Tomolo going to teach some students on teamwork from Maris Stella thru raft-builing....got to sleep early tonite .....i guess, i can use my new found skills here too.

      Went recce for tomolo's camp at St Andrews Junior School. Looking forward to tomolo!!! After the recce, got to attend another briefing for another raft building assignment as an instructor for Maris Stella for next week. With some time to spare in between the recce and the briefing, i went Army Market to look for my first pair of booty for water activities. Got a pair but no cash....Shitz.....ran ard the freaking area and still cannot find a UOB atm. As i was getting late for the briefing, i went for the briefing first before going back to Army Market to collect my stuff. Alas!!! The manager conducting the briefing was almost 1 hr late...... Oni got to go and collect my stuff at ard 7 plus pm. Coincidentally saw Allan Tay. As we were going opposite direction, we didnt talk much.   Reached home at ard 8 plus hungry and tired after the whole day's walking. Mum's cooking always taste so good to me. Packed my stuff for tomolo liao....actually neber really pack...just throw into my backpack.  Celin, my buddy,  will be going on her YEP trip to Thailand tomolo and after stressing herself out for this project, i wish her good luck. Too bad due to work commitment cannot send her off tomolo....hahaha.....great excuse!!   Tomolo will be a Better Day!!! MING TIAN HUI GEN HAO....

      Watched Shrek 2 ....fantastic!! It was supposed to be 6 ppl in the grp watching the movie but saw a few other familiar faces when i reach the theatre....including jennifer my "long lost" class mate cum vice-chairperson in sec school. Glad to see that she is doing fine now. Seem so fated that so many long lost friends will always get united again after so many years. Thru her, knew tat some of our former classmates are happily married and doing well too. When is my turn to be happily married? I wait , and wait , and wait.   Was talking to the gang on many topics and suddenly we were talking about volunteering for the sake of volunteering. Personally i dont believe tat a person help others for just only the sake of helping others. There must be some personal objective involved no matter how small it is. But it takes alot of courage to give most of urself to help others. Question of the day posed to me was by Joanne. "Will you leave Singapore and stay in Cambodia?" A definite NO was my answer. I may like that place alot but i have to acknowledge that Singapore is still where i belong and where i can make full use of myself.   Jones went on YEP a few yrs ago and he also points out that we Singaporean students are not actually helping them. It was in fact the other way round where the locals are helping and taking care of us. I would agree that it was very true....especially since his project was an infrastructure building one. Money is the best way to help in this sense not students who are unskilled. This is exactly the reason i chose Project Sangkhim over other infrastructure projects cos it can help "more" and we promote the spirit of learning and skills training. Nevertheless, we are learning more from the locals than us giving and helping them.  He also commented that YEP is a true experience not to be missed. Guessed participants of YEPs shd agree on that. P  Had a long chat with jones on Camps and various activities while we were walking home. Tapped on his experience in his previous camps. Recapped some of my own experience when i was young. A very enriching talk. Can see that Jones is still very passionate abt outdoor camps. Everyone have their dreams and i hope Jones can pursue his dream. I am relatively new to these new camps and outdoor activities. Thus will try to explore it even more.   Zz...... Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      My hands numbed the whole of yesterday thats y neber blog. Went SengHow's place for a mahjong game and lost almost 50 bucks....damnz!! Must be becos my hands were numbed...tats y cannot chut power!! Anyway Today went for interview at another Outdoor Adventure company. Since i doing freelance now, will starve if i stick to 1 company....might as well look for more companys=more assignments. Got 1 assignment liao . Though the pay is rather low for the first assignment, it will subsequently increase as they pay according to seniority and experience. One of the highest paying company if i gain enough experience. Thru the interview, the interviewer was kind enough to teach me some interview techniques that might help me in the future.  Met up with Melissa and Huijun for dinner at TM mac. Didnt eat much though. Oni ate 1 MacChicken. Now i am feeling freaking hungry.  Had a long icq chat with Joey and we went through all sorts of topics ranging from the LAMEST cum CORNIEST lecturer in NUS politcal science dept that taught us in yr 1 to Project Sangkhim to "Fishing" ( me the fisherman , she the fish...hahaha). I can talk to her on anything....studies, corny jokes, politics....anything and everything...guessed thats wat u call Click. or both of us are friendly beings.  When she asked me what made me join project sangkhim, i recapped the series of events that happened right from the first email i received about an ongoing recruitment talk to the completion of the project. Concluded that it is fate or some like to say it is the CALLING. It just happened.   Time to hunt in my kitchen liao ...adios. Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Today went ice skating....almost more than 12 yrs since i last ice skated. Was apprehensive at first but accustomed to the ice quite fast. As i got more confident, i tried to go faster....and Faster.....and FASTER......the expectable happened. I did a fly dive after tripping over the front of the skates....as if playing subarashi at the former fantasy island. I flew and slided across half the rink with my bellly on the floor. haha...but neber say die.....tried more and more....faster and faster. In the end ....ended up with injuries on my 3 limbs....oni my right hand is free of injury. My legs were bruised while i got some a slight sprain or muscle overstretch on my left wrist which i broke 6 yrs ago. Can feel the pain. Though painful but worth the fun. I was not the oni one with injuries . In fact i had the least injuries even though i have the most beautiful dive. The rest of the gang are in a worse situation than me.  Went KFC at kallang after skating and we gobbled down chickens and had free flow of drinks. As usual the gang was never statisfied with an afternoon of activities, so am i. But as usual, we cannot keep to one topic for more than 30 seconds with all the idiotic stunts like using a bottle of shampoo as a handphone. Finally decided that we will head down to pasir ris beach for another round of drinking ( my consecutive 2nd day of drinking at pasir ris beach). Finally finished the half bottle of voldka. We had a few rds of games admist drinking and forfeits were included. I had to do a POLE DANCE on one occasion. Though i dance like a nerd, but WHO CARES??? Just join the fun.  It is now almost 5am and i wana KOONZ liao....Oyasuminasai Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Tired is the word. Went PC to practise my kayaking again. Wasn't a successful practice though cos i can't seem to get it correct. Capsized numerous times. Can get my Stern Rudder and Bow Rudder right..... a complete disaster today. I will get it sooner or later.  Went Raffles City food court for dinner with Addison and Michelle after the practice. Ordered Seafood with Beancurd and eggs on hotplate. It was quite nice actually....and affordable. Quite a good meal. There is still time to spare so we went to check out the Ripcurl Rash (wetshirt). Wanted to get one for kayaking....hmm...it cost 69 bucks...but there wasn't any fantastic designs. Decided that i will check out other areas before buying.   Now i am sitting i front of my comp talking to THE bitch...hahaha......  SIgning off... Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      2 days no blog , anybody miss me???  anyway, i was at a camp instructor training camp for the last 2 days with Innotrek at Jalan Bathera Campsite. Quite a nostalgic place cos used to have my sec 3 camp there almost 8 yrs ago. THe place changed alot.It was really an enriching training for me and i managed to see the professionalism and enthu in the company and instructors. One main thing i've learnt is that outdoor camps are not the same as what we have gone thru while we are in sec school anymore..Also learnt many skills pertaining to be an INSTRUCTOR. It is not just a imparting of skills to trainees anymore. It is very much more of facilitating while imparting the skills.I've learnt alot from the senior instructors who showed us the ropes especially Annuar, Eunice, Raziman (not sure if i got the name correct...haha) and Bob. They were a fantastic bunch of people. Hope to work with them soon.  Got my exam results today. As usual filled with ups and downs. Got an A-, 3Bs and one B-. Though acceptable results, i am rather disappointed with one module. Singapore's Foreign Policy,  which i feel should be much better than a B, considering the amount of effort and daily performance i have put into the module. Quite surprising for 2 modules which i did much better than expected. In the module of " Nation building in Singapore", i've got a A-. I tot an A- is not possible after screwing up one major question in the exam. In another module "COntemporary social issues in Singapore", this was the biggest surprise. I did not do well in both the group project and individual essay prior to the exam, they were disastrous in fact. In addition, i did not attend lectures the whole sem and for tutorials is just to mark attendence oni...neber do the tutorials at all. Also didn't do much reading for the exams....oni know that it was an open book exam the day before the paper. Surprise Surprise i managed to smoke thru the paper and score a B. Once again it proved that NUS marking system always gives plenty of surprises. I neber manage to predict my results correctly for the last 2 yrs, gave up on predicting liao...hahahaha  very sleep liao...stay tuned for the next episode   Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Today was a tiring day. Finally i got to go kayaking after such a long break. Had a good workout by practising all the rows and different techniques. Also got to know a young, active girl and now got another kayaking khaki liao. Saw the instructor for the 3 star kayaking cse @ paddle culture and got to know that another 3 star cse is coming up. Signed up for it finally. Spent the whole afternoon at paddle culture.   Went Yiyong's hse for hse warming in the evening. Let's analyse this.  Premise A : All girls cant read maps Premise B : I cant read maps Conclusion : I am a girl  Hmm....if premise A is true and Premise B is true, does it mean that the conclusion is true?? Hmmm.....cannot be rite?? hahah......Well I was supposed to arrive at Yiyong's hse quite easily given her directions. Somehow or rather, I cant find my way to her hse. There was a map on the road that directs me to her house but ....somehow or rather i freaking walk another freaking big round to reach her hse. The best part is that her hse is just across the field from my starting point. Guessed thats the reason i didn't join the combat units in SAF. hahahaha.....  I am very apologetic to yiyong for today. Firstly, i didn't reply to her sms on whether i am going anot cos i wasn't sure if i can make it in the first place. I didn't know that i was one of the few friends that was privilleged enough to be invited. She really took me as a friend in her inner, or at least middle circle of friends liao. When she say she invited me becos i was his "DA-ge"....i was really touched. When i was told by KW yesterday tat oni the few of us were invited, i just know that no matter what time my activities end today, i will definitely go to her hse to join in the celebrations....in JURONG...wah liao...sibei far....hahahah To think i can possibly think of the possibility of not attending it in the first place  Secondly, I was rather late in arriving at her hse...Reason 1: I was in East coast kayaking...okie!! my fault. Reason 2: I dropped at the wrong bus stop....okie!!! I cock...my fault again and 3) I can't read maps??? okie...my fault again. She wasn't really angry or wat when i was there even after all these. The first think she asked me when she saw me is " Do you want some food? " hahahah....as usual..such a considerate host. When she saw me sweating like mad (after all the searching for the correct place) ...she brought me a cup of orange juice with some satay....this type of friend where to find???  I sincerely regretted my insensitivity towards her....hiaz....who to blame but i am just such an insensitive guy....hahah...guessed that's me...  Got to know a second new friend for today...Yiyong intro a girl from a church to me and coincidentally she is also from NUS arts faculty. The best part is that she is going to cambodia on a humanitarian project soon....guessed that's where all the discussions come in.   Saw some of PS members there too....Cuiling, Chiak, Mark, Xuling......there are ever so friendly.....very PING MING....hahaha...to think these are a bunch of future doctors...tell other ppl in my clique of friends also hard to believe....hahaha......Guessed this is the reason dont judge a book by its cover. I know where to get my downgrade for NS in the future when they graduate liao...hahahaha  My night ends here....Zzzzz........  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      A lapse of Concentration.   A few days ago, we had drinks in Pasir Ris Park. Today it was East Coast Park. It was Zheng Han's bday and we decided to have a small celebration there. I had always enjoyed the breeze at East Coast Park. Always so cooling. We had a few drinks, nothing too alcholic. Out of a sudden, my hands just slipped, resulting in the spillage of the cup of drink from my hands. I doono what struck me. Just this moment of lapse in concentration, my whole arm was covered with voldka orange. Maybe these days i become the TOFU man with the TOFU hands.   Did some star gazing at the beach. Though there were some stars around, it was still far too bright in the area to view the sky. I remembered the stars at Berkelah. Mesmerizing. Jones commented that i was too quiet tonite and queried if i am having some problems, perhaps problem of the heart. I wasn't. I was just enjoying the sea breeze, the quiet-ness, the sky, stars and the ambience.   Joanne posted two question that left me pondering. " What do you see yourself in the future? What keeps you going?" No doubt i am en route to the possession of a B.A from the supposedly "best" university in Singapore after working so hard in my education but this alone couldn't guarantee me my desires and a relatively high standard of living in SIngapore.   I have learnt to enjoy the beauty of Arts and Social Sciences. I want to make full use of what i have learnt in political science. I also want to fufill an ambition of being a teacher after being inspired. I want to be SOMEBODY. Not just another graduate from NUS. I want to make a difference.   So what makes me going? I guessed it is the combination of interest and desire. The interest in the field and the desire to be a SOMEBODY, not a NOBODY. Where do i see myself in the future? My future is not that clear yet but hopefully i will be fufilling all my interests and yet be a SOMEBODY. The best is to be in the WHO's WHO list in Singapore for the right reasons.  I have been an owl these few days, hunting only in the night. The body clock had been altered. Guessed this needs some getting used to.  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      I've checked out the upcoming 3 star kayaking course with Paddleculture and hopefully will be able to make it for the upcoming course in June. Really wana complete at least untill the level of 3 star certification in terms of kayaking...dowan to stop halfway though. If possible, maybe i will sign up for the Level 1 coaching course but this one need money...need to save first. Sometimes i am doubting if i did the right thing in spending on these courses. On one hand i am wasting money in the eyes of others. On the other, i am investing in my future. The possession of such professional certification can help me secure a job more easily...especially in the outdoor activities arena. In fact, one of my job options after graduation would be teaching...maybe in the form of a history or PE teacher. These certification will certainly come in handy.  Well...a coaching license will certainly look well on my resume in the form of leadership capabilities.   Spoke to my former classmate. Michelle,  whom i known as a classmate, for the 2nd longest in my life. A total of 16 yrs....since primary 1. Reminscing on the past and crapping on the present. As she was a very good playmate ( stop thinking dirty!!!!) in primary sch.....ping pong .....catching .....TKD. WHen we were on the topic of TKD, i told her that i have not done my 1st dan conversion and she suggested that i return to my club and do the conversion. I was thinking this is actually a good idea. A 1st dan certification in TKD can help me in many ways. But the thing is tat i have stopped practising TKD for almost 8 yrs liao.....i forgot everything liao.....now so fat and slow...how can i keep up with the pace of a TKD training siah. Not like last time so young, boundless energy and ultra flexible ( no joke, my legs are ultra flexible...can do splits easily okie...hahaha) Friday ....the training...maybe i go down a take a look before deciding anything.   La La La La La.....Went Hougang K-Box today with jones and gang. Supposed to be a multi-sexual outing ( i mean different sexes...dont get me wrong) but the non-males all play us out. In the end , it was a MENs' nite...as usual :( Learnt something new today....Pubs have ladies nite...K-box have Men's nite today......sang from 9 pm to 3am....Sing unitll Nuah.  Received a call from my closest cousin ( i dont have many cousins though). So good to hear from her again. I think almost 1 yr plus neber see her liao. She was always so helpful towards my bro and me. I was introduced to wake-boarding by her. Even though it was 3am in the morning, i felt so refreshed after hearing her voice. Should be the warmth of a family member in her voice. WAs supposed to meet her for supper but had to very very very last minute cancel. I felt so bad cos she was already on the way to meet me liao. Guessed there will always be another chance.    Many people asked me today when am i getting my class 3 license since i already possess a 2B license. I would want to obtain one soon. But once again it is the $$$ factor. Actually a class 3 license is not essential for me now cos my family doesn't posses a car. I dont have much chance to use it either. But having one is a form of insurance for the future. Who knows when i will be required in the driving seat. After possessing a 2B license for more than 2 yrs, i know the dangers and hassle of riding a bike. I have my fair share of near misses in the past.Sooner or later i would have to switch from riding to driving. Just a matter of time   it is late liao...goona koonz liao .....

      Went for interview today...Innotrek, an outdoor camp specialist company. Went to interview for a freelance/temp/part time camp asst instructor and it went quite successfully. Shd be quite fun working in such a field. The bad point : Ad-hoc basis.....no camps = no job = no money. But it's okie lah....as long as there are a few assignments a month, i shd be able to survive. There is an instructor training camp next week and i am supposed to attend. I am looking forward to it and my first assignment should be on 10th JUNE....I repeat 10th JUNE....ur uncle here b'day...sob! sob!!...those who see this shd know what to do on 9th JUNE liao rite? Hint Hint!!! In the meantime, now got to find another part time job to sustain.   The day is not too bad. At least i did something useful today...better than yesterday. Saw a lady on the way back from innotrek on the mrt....no bad , quite chio .....she was talking on the phone and wearing some formal office wear. From the way she speaks thru the mobile phone, it seems tat someone screwed things up for her...hey!! I didn't eavesdrop okie.....she was just standing in front of me. Can see that she was very angry, yet she was able to control tone when she was speaking to her friend on the phone. Quite stylo....another thing to learn. Learning to control temper and tone. By the way...i confirm she sell IN-SOR-LAN cos she saying things on policies...must be some managerial or supevervisor level in this field.

      Theme for today : Heroes.  What are heroes? Huang Fei Hong? Superman?? Ninja Turtles?? Have i ever seen a hero? Have i ever felt a hero? Yes, i did.  Who are they? What are they? Where are they?   Saw the show on SARS on CH 8 moments ago. Who are the heroes? The nurses? Yes. The doctors?? Yes. The logistic support staff? Yes. These are the real heroes because they layed down their lives in order to save the patients infected with SARS. They stood their grounds when the world around them is going awry. I cant imagine the amount of fear , despair and stress they suffered during that period yet retreat was not a decision they took. Without them, none of Singaporeans will ever be saved from SARS. These are the people who deserved the real respect!   Mr Heng Yeow Peow, a true to life hero. He could have survived the nicoll highway collapse if he did not choose to go back into the site to save his fellow colleagues. Can we do that in times of danger. The decision is diificult in a Fight or Flight situation.   Mdm Bee Ngoh, a Singaporean lady i've known in Cambodia. She was willing to spend her last 10 yrs in Cambodia helping the locals. Life wasn't as good and comfortable and definitely not safe as compared to singapore , yet she was willing to do it in the name of humanity. On top of Mdm Bee Ngoh, the many humanitarian workers around the world that seeks to help the less fortunate should also be honoured.   I couldn't describe my utmost respect for these heroes. I could just silently pray for them.  I wished i could do what i am supposed to do , not for the sake of being a hero but at least not being a villian. I wish i could emulate their behaviour. I wished  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Nuah is the theme for today. Got a "last minute" call by joanne to join them at fisherman village. Since i am quite nuah at home, no harm joining. Went there and relaxed abit. Suddenly some suggestion on getting alchoholic drinks shot up. Jones and Me went home to get the necessary "equipments" and "Ingredients" for a night of alcoholo experimentation. Gin, Volka and Rum plus all sorts of "rubbish" for a night of "picnic" at pasir ris beach. People who dont know will think that we are going for chalets with all the drinks siah.   The breeze was blowing across our cheeks , with the music provided by a nearby pub. Fantastic ambience. No need to pay cover charge cos we just grab an empty bench and stay mixing our own concotion. It was a wonderful relaxed night. Long since i enjoyed the breeze with the waves breaking at the beach.   Now i am abit groggy though i did not drink much....hmmm......must be the effects of mixing the different type of liquor.   got to go koonz liao...adios senor Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Today , we celebrated yiyong's birthday at Marina South Steamboat buffett. It was actually a surprise party for her, so you can guess her reaction when she saw ard 30 of her friends waiting for her when she arrived. Though i've not known yiyong for years..she is one girl that i would really consider a friend worthwhile and unforgettable. Anytime she invites me to work on another project with her in the future, i would not have any qualms of accepting it. This is one celebration i would not want to miss.   Then comes the difficult part. How to choose a present for her? I've tot of giving her granola bars cos it seems like she liked granola bars more than normal dinner when we were in Cambodia. Then i thought of making a doll... but i donno how to sew a doll. Looks like luck is with me when i went shopping for a gift...saw something that instantly caught my attention. A necklace with a cross. Though it wasn't a diamond necklace * I dont have a freaking rich father okie!!!*  but it was one which i can relate to her immediately. I did not hesitate abit when i bought this gift cos i have a feeling this is going to be a PERFECT gift. I can bet my last ruppiah..oppss....on it that if this is not the one she like most, this will still be on the upper rung of the list.  Appropriate and useful....hahaha.....I go for Unique-ness.....got style one....not like the normal gifts people give....hahahah.....actually i had for once thought of just giving her a 100 bucks Tangs gift voucher that was given to me free....haha....but the angel told me i cannot do this to a friend like Yiyong, she deserves more....hahaha......saved by the Angel.  Now come to my usual favorite topic .........FOOD..... Usually people will eat to their hearts delight at Marina South. It is buffett afterall. I didn't  really enjoyed tonite's meal though. Used to go there every week with coach Anthony Chan. But now, i felt that the food is too oily.The food wasn't good either. Did not eat much though. I was still hungry so i decided to jio Danny, mel, jones, Ken, joanne, nicole, and estell for supper. Ordered a plate of fried rice and drank huge quantity of water. Perhaps the effect of coming back from a BBQ steam boat buffett.  I am feeling abit sick now and i predict that a sore throat is emminent. Just got to hope for the best.   Lastly, would just loved to wish Yiyong a happy 21st birthday!! ( hmm.....so sad my 21st bday 2 years ago was spent with SAF...sob sob)  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Got a few job offer today.....including two as a financial adviser. Not my cup of tea though. 10 pm...Danny and gang jio for supper. I actually intended to ride my dad's bike to go for supper but the toopid bike just wont start for me...fed up and give up on it liao. Took a bus instead. It was an interesting supper where as usual became a tok cock session. The gang was talking about going to genting. Well, the PKL gang can neber be focus on 1 topic. Proven again today cos we will drift off the planning of the genting trip everytime we start discussing about it. My opinion?? The mood and mindset is not right. The discussion was too hap-hazard. Finally got something out of it after 3 hrs of talk cock cum planning session.  Perhaps i am too rigid....my character.....i think that there should be some form of agenda in the discussion ....even in informal setting. At least it keeps people focus and not drift. This is the reason why sometimes i dont like discussing things that needs planning in informal setting but got to learn and make use of such a setting in the future. No environment is bad, I just have to learn to adapt..... Hahaha....   Danny and I , with the rest of the gang were talking about going diving soon . I am very interested in this but due to $$$ problem, i would need to plan and save for it. But i predict that it will be another N.A.T.O ( a.k.a No Action Talk Only). I don't mind going during term period of next year but personally i would favour a fixed date and time thingy instead of NATO.  Another topic that arose during the supper that kept me silently thinking about certain issues. Is woman a liability to man when they are old? A lady friend was very supportive of this notion while the rest are against it. If i am at my normal self just now, i would had tackled this notion head on cos i found numerous loopholes and traps my friends had fallen into. Perhaps it is the night that made me ponder a while before i doing anything rash. Firstly, i can sense some form of subjectivety and personal attachment (problems)  in my lady friend that might have caused her to give a rather strong response. Then, the others are trying to convince her using a rather direct approach. I used to think only from my point of view only but this time round i tried to analysed her argument from her point of view. I knew that she has some problems and if i take the direct approach by joining into the arguement, this will only give a reverse effect. By trying to understand her mindset, I chose to keep quiet on my stand for once cos i know that if i join in the discussion , it will become extremely heated and unfair to her.This gave me a chance to think thru wat she had said while drinking my cup of Teh Cino. Winning an argument in this case was not difficult for me but to be able to feel for friends and make them happy ( or at least not so stress/angry/ watever) is worth more than winning an argument. Sometimes people just need an chance to pour out their unhappiness, i think this is one of those time. I think I've grown a tiny bit today from the way i have handled myself in this situation. Silence is sometimes golden indeed  Went home just in time for Champions League soccer. Chelsea vs Monaco. Chelsea does not deserve to be knocked out of the Champions league man. The way they played in the first half, they can match any team in the world....2 words....Simply Fabulous. The neber gave up even till the last minute and that is what i call professionalism. Chelsea did not lose to Monaco. They lost to themselves by leaving their scoring boots in the cupboard. Numerous chances squandered. If taken those chances, Chelsea would have killed of the competition in the first half. Monaco is excellent too..coming back from 2-0 to chase back to 2-2. Credit to them too. Worth the time spent staying up to watch the match. Long since i last watched late nite soccer.   Got to koonz liao  signing off Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      MY NOTEBOOK KANA VIRUS!!!!!!!!  that's y there is no blog for 2 days. Even now as i am logging in my blog, my notebook is still in the service centre. I am now in NUS YIH com CBLC nuah as i await my notebook to be ready.  I've sent out numerous temp jobs applications today. Got frontdesk, got data entry, got temp job in donno where and also downloaded a contact for some job in Aloha Resort. Tomolo going for the interview with the fruit juicer but before that maybe i shd try aloha first cos it is nearer and it seemed that work at resorts might be interesting too. hmm....dilemma....  by the way how abt some backdating log?? Okie?? okie!!!  Sat:  Today , my notebook kana virus. Tried reformatting, still cannot clear the virus. Guessed had to go without comp for 2 days till monday liao. How am i going to live without my notebook!!!!!!!!!!1 I actually planned to go JB for some seafood and shopping today. But when i woke up, i saw something that spoilt my plan. An SAF letter on my noticeboard that says: " Dear 3SG (NS) CHoo, Pls be informed that you are undermobilisation manning for this period......." Guess wat?? this week is mob manning for me !!!!! SHitz!!!!!!!! plan gone liao.  No choice....once again became another nuah day. Actually not that nuah lah. although my thighs were quite stiff after 2 days of workout, i did some upper body workout with the 2 dumb bells i found in my room.   Sunday: Once again another nuah day. Used to have my notebook accompanying me on a boring weekend. I feel so lost without it. Slept the whole day except for the sudden burst of rashness, again, to go swimming. Went to Tampines Swimming Complex for a swim and noticed that i did not bring a towel with me. Damnz....got to but one for $4.90.....very waste money siah.  I am not going to public pools on weekends again liao..There are simply too many ppl.....especially the learner swimmers a.k.a little kids there. No fun swimming. I am not a fast swimmer but i had to stop every few strokes just becos there are too many people in the pool. Next time i am going to appreciate the NUS pool liao....Watching the kids learn swimming reminds me of the younger days where i used to be one of the learner swimmer in Bedok Swimming Complex...those were the days.   thats about is for the weekend.

      Incredible!!! Vincent jio me out for dinner just now...since i free entertain him abit lor...sit his car go EAT AIR to kill boredom. Too long neber talk to him liao but seems like nothing much to talk about siah. I was quite an awkward feeling for me cos there isnt much topic except about how each other was getting along. We used to be very good friends in Sec school cos he and xiuling took very good care of me when we were in the badminton team. Had alot of memorable time with them during sec school...Ubin haunted house trek, organising BBQs for the team , fishing , going to airport eat and tutoring me in 'AO' maths in the middle of the night(though i still fail cos it was super last minute work for me liao ) ....they were my closest friends in secondary school Too bad what should not have happened, happened. Anyway, heard that xiuling is now happily married, feel happy for her too.  When for supper with Danny, Jones, Chuanlay, Daniel, Kenneth and Beng Tat ( also kenneth). Turn out to be a super tok cock cum reminiscing session when we talked about of sec school days... wah liao....bring back alot of funny memories....such as me scratching my form teacher's hand when he discovered me reading some pri school book during a reading session in sec 1 (I was just not interested in reading books then lah). Daniel's belonging's, including his pants were confiscated during chinese lessons ( heehee..i one of those that implicitly caused him to have his things confiscated) and Jone's cotton atheletics singlet that have been recycled 4 times before his wears it for his 800m race...wonderful memories.   Now back home liao .....as usual....FREAKING WARM NITE!!!!!!    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      2 words : LAO SAI Positive: HENG KA LAO SAI Negative: Suay Ka Lao Sai  not much sleep in the last 2 weekends cos activities just come in fast and furious.  Saturday nite: Got a call from Ah Tat to go TM starbucks lim kopi. Slacked there till almost midnite. Met Daniel a.k.a SHIT ( SAI) and jones there too. After KOPI, we went 107 for another round of kopi...cheap ones this time liao. On the way to 107, saw the no heart ( heehee) Vincent at Shell...though we are very good friends, seldom see him in the last 1 yr liao....got YI XING MEI REN XING....hahahaha......Then kenneth suggested a TPSS alumni chionging nite on the 10th July at Mdm Wong. I have a feeling i am going to get drunk this time rd cos he know alot of ppl inside and can get the liqour at freaking cheap prices and these asses will not let anyone of us go off easily....hahahahah  After 107, we 4 losers nothing to do, we proceeded to daniels hse for the dutch-swedish match. Not that exciting though it is the oni EURO match that i completed watching. JOnes was freaking on a roller coaster during the match cos he is a dutch supporter. Y a dutch supporter u may ask.....He is a dutch by birth...But now is tru blue singaporean liao. Haha....considering Dutch's previous 4 losses at major competition trhu penalties, u can just imagine his anxiety when the match went into a shootout.   Sunday morning: We for a basketball game with the PKL gang without the full squad. Suay ka Lao sai.....my shoes sole came off halfway. I actually decided to wear this pair cos i predicted the sole of my alternative pair of shoes ( NEW BALANCE SAF) to come off soon. Suay Suay this pair also came off. In the end got to go buy a pair of BATA shoes just to make do to continue playing.  After the game, went home and change before going for another KTV session with the gang. It was quite fun as usual. But as the were many ppl and one 1 screen to sing, i backside itchy went out to buy a packet of Magnolia milk to drink, knowing very well i will have tummy ache whenever i drink milk. Jackpot!!! WIthin half and hour, the effects came on. Toilet IN OUT IN OUT. On the way home, as i was riding on towards TPE from Hougang, i saw a road block catching speedster. I was HENG KA LAO SAI tis time rd. The stretch of road was so tempting to speed that i would usually speed in the old bike of my dad. This time rd, i just relac relac rode before the roadblock. IF i have speeded, then most prob i would have been stopped.   Reached home liao but tummy still not that well....and the lack of sleep......Going to koonz liao to forget the effects of tummy ache....hopefully i just dont shit on my bed...hahaha Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

My wrist hurts....old injury...still remember my action packed slam dunk during sec 3 on one of the primary school basketball court. I fractured my elbow and wrist. Nearly missed the B division badminton competition becos of this.  Till now i still experience pain on these two fracture points...especially after excercising and kayaking. Can easily hear craking sound whenever i rotate my wrist.  Damnz.....i oni watched 30 mins of the match between England and Portugal. Buay tahan liao and went to sleep.....shitz....in the end the match is so exciting.Dont think i going to stay up tonite unless i can find something to do while waiting to solve the boredom problem.

      Another Job well done. Completed SAJS camp today. I was assigned to be the rockclimbing instructor today after rotating from the abseil tower yesterday. On some occasion i need to give the kids a little "help" in climbing by literally hoisting them up with the rope. It was very satisfying by seeing the kids complete the climb with my little help.   Went for lunch with the OC instructors at Beach road and found that they are actually a very friendly bunch. Coincidentally, some are my current and some former school mates. Some were from NUS and another girl was actually my junior in YJC. Till next camp in july, i shall now be a slacker again.   By they way if you have not spoke to me on MSN these few days, I have trimmed down by almost 4 kg after 2 days of kayaking. Me now 73kg....might be even lower cos i was wearing shoes and harness when i weigh myself...furthermore there is a zero error in the scale cos it starts before 0kg...heehee  Though weight cut...need to start training fitness and my stomach liao ....hahaha.....looks like beer belly liao ...  cheerios Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Too tired in the last few days tats y neber blog....  Went overnite mahjong with the gang on friday......went home bathe and straightaway went for my 3 star kayaking course. i was super tired ( due to lack of sleep) on my way to East Coast but went i started to kayak i was super energetic. Learnt to do hands roll today...still need alot of practise though. SUNBURN!!!!!  Today went for kayaking course again. Tried the sea kayak for the first time. In was indeed very much more stable then the cylones ( another type of kayak). Not much difficulty controlling the direction in the rough sea. Learnt how to use the kayaks to tow another kayak today. I freaking suay.....we took turns to tow each other during our short expedition....and i suay suay have to tow 2 person together ( scenario is 1 person injured and another stablise his kayak)...freaking shiong ....imagine one kayak tow two kayaks lor. Went Marina to watch the dragonboat race. My first time watching dragon boat race LIVE. The race of the evening was the race between NUS and NTU. The annual Prime Minister Challenge. I was there with Kaixiang and Celin. Me being a current NUS student and Celin an alumni, of course we sat in the sea of ORANGE. The atmosphere was great. Results: NUS recaptured the PM Challenge Trophy after 2 yrs in a race to the finish.....near photo finish. 3 Cheers to the rowers and the supporters.   Went Kenny Rogers after that for dinner. The chicken is as good as ever. Enjoyed it. Went fisherman's village for a drink and now at home slacking liao...tomolo got to work...but my whole body sore after all the training for the last 2 days plus SUNBURN...freaking dark now...

      late for meeting today....but dont really care..haha...surprise surprise!!! My next camp is St Andrews Junior School ....still remember i conducted a leadership camp for them at the start of the month....now doing P5 adventure camp for them again....will see the little brats again...hahaha....looking forward to it though this time rd i will be activity instructor instead of group instructor.  Just heard news that i got accepted into sheares hall next semester. The cost is not cheap... I know that the annual study loan and some of my current savings plus the freelance work i am doing now will bring thru the stay. I am expecting a bursary at the end of the yr too...shd not be a problem, just that i will have to scrimp and save on my last cent. If time allows, i want to continue freelancing cos i really enjoyed the work after these few camps. I really wanted to stay in hall at to experience it during my uni life. Furthermore, i intend to take up lifesaving courses in NUS where they conduct FOC...the thing is that the courses are usually conducted in the evening. I dowan to reach home at midnite after every training. My bro stayed in NTU halls thru-out his 4 yrs there. I have a chance to stay in the last 2 yrs...especially in yr 1 but i decided against it cos i dowan my parents to be alone at home, in case of emergency. This is my last chance liao and luckily got friends help me in despite my medicore CCA points. Now my bro has completed his studies, it is his turn to be the fillial child while i go experience my last yr in NUS. I know they are concern about the cost but i really dowan to waste this chance. Can someone teach me wat to do????  :{   Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Nothing fantastic happened today. Just felt abit down cos i still cannot get my kayaking skills rite. Tomolo going down to PC to practise before going to OC for my camp briefing.   Just yesterday, some negative thoughts came thru my mind suddenly when i am watching TV. I have one very very big fear. Fear of death!!! Kia Si. Suddenly i just felt this fear again. I kept thinking tat i will vanish on this earth when i die...will be nothing...cannot feel anything , hear anything or even say anything...the feeling of emptiness....VANISH!!!! I dont like this feeling....and our lifespan is so short!! I am not going to waste my time any longer. I want to live a fufilling life!!! Scary siah!!!  Was talking to Janne today about doing some volunteering work and suddenly i found some things that i can be good at imparting liao. I may not be as good at academic subjects as compared to my friends to be able to teach others when we are volunteering but i found where i stand liao. I have a skill. Experiential Learning Cycle thru Games to impart many different skill and attributes such as teambuilding and leadership skills!!! I have been using this tool in my camps and i am considered a so called "professional" liao. I can use this skill to help people too since it is so expensive for the underprivilleged to go for such courses. I have alot of confidence in this tool and think that many people can benefit from it.   I have been wondering/reproaching myself if i had been a chao slacker during the Project Sangkhim Expedition cos i have been delegating alot of things to the members to do. Now, i dont think i am a chao slacker (i dont think i am then too...heehee) . Reason is simple. My job there is to ensure safety and smooth flow of the project. A leader is not a superman....he has to know where his limits and skills are and work within it. Delegation can put the more suitable person into the job and free the leader's hand with things that will and might require his personal attention. One case that had kept me wondering about is the allocation of "chefs" for our daily meals in cambodia. I was one of the few that did not do any cooking. I dont want to limit myself to the cooking duties for one reason. I dont know when i need to suddenly be bothered with some emergency incidents thru out the project. If i am the cook of the day and suay suay emergency fall on that day, i would need to put down the cooking duty and attend to the emergency....this will result in the meals not being ready on time....as a hungry team is an angry team, this is one area i dont dare to play around with. As of the decision, it has been proven once (lucky oni once)  over lunch that i have to skip three quaters of my lunch to settle some "money problems" with the locals. I owe the team one for this and hopefully next time i can return them this favor....by the way ....they cook very very well !!! yummy yummy   If you have sincerely followed my blog, you would have noticed that Project Sangkhim has been popping out here and there. Although it has been almost 6 months since the project ended but still it is still there in my heart.   :) Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Shagged out liao!!!.....went for my 3 star kayaking cse today...super shagged out...East Coast water was rather rough today. Refining of all the skills....still need alot of practice. Reversed paddled for almost 700m in the rough waters and another 200m without any paddles....interestingly i was very lively and singing though i am super tired. Will continue next weekend.   Update on the last 3 days.... Just came back from Woodgrove Sec Sch camp. My first sec sch camp. It was indeed ver different from the primary school camp. Had fun too. The group of senior instructors also taught me alot of things...very willing to guide. Gd for me...hahaha.... I see teamwork in another aspect...The boys were "punished" one the last nite when they refused to sleep or keep quiet after lights out. All the instructors were "activated" to vacate the boys bunk and the boys were given a real "talking to" in the middle of the nite. When the boys see so many instructors at their bunk area, they know that we meant business.....so there just followed instructions to vacate the bunks...just need one person to "talk" the rest of the instructors stand ard looking serious enough liao ....hahaha......seeing the expression on the boys' faces i really wanted to laugh but have to hold it back untill the "talking to" ended...wahahahahaha  Got a few comments from the senior instructors tat i am learning the ropes fast...very encouraging. To my surprise, i came in a near second in the most improved instructor category, voted by fellow instructors....hahaha......low start always make small improvement look big....hahaha......but still very motivating.   The camp-fire was abit not to "high" at first but as it progress....the heat is getting higher and higher. As the grps presented their "3-minute of fame", the camp chief decided tat the instructors shd reciprocrate....so we did a 3 minute briefing and came up with our own 3 minute of fame. Although i wasn't sure of the lyrics of the songs and cheers but hack care....just join in and follow what they are doing....the thing is to have fun. The finale was a super impromptu one......a song was played...i think it is called " Where u find love" and the instructors started dancing and moving ard the fire in a clockwise direction...and i mean very near to the fire. Then the kids just joined in and followed us and dance behind us where we move ard the fire......very very HIGH!! ....and HOT....Great to see that the kids are enjoying themselves. some of the kids in my grp were telling me after the camp fire that they thought all the instructors got "possesed" cos we were so energetic and high during the camp fire...hahaha....actually i really shouted and sang untill i nearly lost my voice...heehee...but we did RA-RA them enough to make them join in.  okie....now got to wait for tonite's game....England Vs France....stay tuned.  Signing OFF....     Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Got an sms this morning regarding the demise of Mel's granny. To speak the truth, i wasn't very surprised when i heard this news as there were some symptoms weeks before this. But i was sad nevertheless. Just came back from the wake.   It made me notice that life is so fragile ( not that i neber know this before)....the more i need to be happy and cherish my short life span.   The gang was playing Mahjong at the wake and this time rd, mahjong is a spectator sport for me....not really in the mood to play though. I was standing behind the players and observing the way they play. It is as interesting, if not even more interesting than playing it myself. I got to see how each player sets themselves up to win and their style. Got to see all the tiles and observe and learn from them. Mahjong is indeed too profound for me. Not really a "sport" tat i would want to excel in. Firstly, i dont really like gambling becos i have seen some people close to me suffer at the hands on gambling........tats y u seldom see me bet 4D, Soccer....etc. Then, i dont have a clear head to analyse all the different methods. The reason i am occasionally playing these "games" is to ensure that at least i wont be cheated so easily by other people in the future. I dont like doesnt mean i dont know. Simple as that. BUt the game mahjong is one way i can interact and keep in contact with my friends. Found this to be a very good avenue.   Next, coincidentally saw Liling, Yanxin and Rouyun sitting in Tampines mall macdonalds chatting with jones and danny this evening. On my arrival, they started jioing me for an Ophir trip. I agreed. BUT they will go and plan....hahaha.....meantime i will go train up myself. Dowan to end up like the previous trip when i am shagged all the way..  Also got a new pair of shades from Weilun's Dad's optical shop to replace my old pair that broke ( confirm spoil one lor cos pirated producted from Cambodia...hahaha). Not bad....looks quite nice and fitting. The best part is that Weilun's Mum gave me a 30 bucks discount. Got the pair of shades for oni $65 bucks. Next time must got there patronise more liao...  Tired liao....koons liao...stay tuned Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Won some money on mahjong today but not without a cost. Donno wat happened but i had some pain at my abdomen area ( ard 4th quadrant)  throughout the game...not sure if it is stomachache or wat... reached home at ard 7.30am and decided to take a sleep but as usual the noise level is not that acceptable for me to sleep in peace. Interestingly, i did not yell at anyone to keep quiet. Hahaha.....maybe win money, today good mood so neber throw my temper. Just "try" sleep....managed to do that till 2pm. Had lunch and going back to sleep again liao.  signing off: Stomach Pain Pain Stomach Stomach Pain Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Watched a whole series of J-drama today......freaking funny. Anyone still remember the jap girl with the big ears? Hahaha....nice show...  Other than that....life's boring...dont feel like going out today. Nuah!!!  I've been sitting down dreaming...dreaming about my future. What am i going to be in the future? What can i really be? A bureaucrat? A Teacher? or even an Outdoor Specialist with OBS? I am not sure. It seems like the older i get, the more i yearn to learn more things. Here's the paradox!!! As i learn new stuff, i am getting more choices.....then got to choose from these varied choices available. Maybe i might even be an entrepreneur....It's the IN thing now. Secali 30 yrs later i might be the next real estate magnate.   Spoke to Michelle tis morning. She's now backpacking in Rome...going Venice next. I wished i could go next yr for my grad trip.I await her return to tell me all the stories she gathered from her Europe trip. Anyway, it doesnt matter where i go for a trip, what matter is i enjoy my trip.....might go back Cambodia ...heeheeheee....  Sharon and Litming are also on their grad trip. Spoke to them too....they just completed their Annapurna trek in Nepal and will be going over to Bangkok. Shopping spree...hahahaha....Sharon's kayaking cert is with me for ages liao....  going over to mel's hse play mahjong liao .....till next time Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Yesterday too tired, neber blog. Just came back from Maris Stella campfire. Starting to participate more and more in camp fires liao. I've built my first successful camp fire. It burnt quite well.....hahaha....too well to be exact. The Camp Fire leaders had to stdby a bucket of water cos the fire is burning very strongly. Luckily neber get to use the water on the fire. Instead, the bucket of water was splashed onto some unsuspecting participants during one of the activity.   Finally had a day after working for 6 full days. Really enjoyed this break cos i literally slacked the whole day at home. Woke up, Eat , SLeep , Wake up , Eat.....going to sleep soon. Looking forward to my next camp on the 10th...not sure which sch it will be yet....hey it is the 10TH!!! Remember!!! I am born on the 10th JUNE!!!! It is the 10th JUNE!! ....hahahahaha.........  Koonz....  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Went teaching a bunch of kids from Maris stella primary school to build rafts. It was interesting seeing the different designs of rafts coming up but i wasnt too satisfied with the company that engaged my service cos the organisation wasn't that good. As least not as good as Inno. Supposed to help out in the campfire tonite but decided that i NO MOOD..so go with the flow and tell the coordinator that we are very tired under the hot sun in kallang that we cannot do it tonite....hahaha.....so we SIAM tonite's campfire but got to do the one for Wednesday....just hack care liao lah...  Tomolo going Paddle Culture kayaking again....finally can relax abit after working 5 consecutive days.    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Went school today for the Project sanghkim meeting and got to know more about the plans for the dec project. We are going to set up a youth centre and restuarant in cambodia and tat requires alot of work and commitment. Most prob i wont be going in December but will help out whenever necessary.  My wrist hurts. Old injury from sec 3 when i broke my wrist. Guessed i have aggravated it in the last few months from my sudden involvement in outdoor activities. It hurts !!! Nevertheless, i will not give up. Will continue kayaking while i take up climbing. Me intending to buy a personal climbing harness since i am able to get it at staff price from F.I.T. Can use it for climbing and belaying during camps. Trust me , u do not want to wear the One Size Fits All harness the whole day if you do not want groin injury and abrasion.   Tomolo going kayaking again....yippee Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Came back from camp today ....this time rd is Kranji Pri School. Had this grp of campers that really made my day. I was supposed to leave the camp on Wednesday cos i wasnt involved in the second part of the camp. But these campers in one of the grp made me feel appreciated. They were not even my "kids" cos i was just helping a colleague who is new to the job....so i attached myself to the grp for a few hours to help him lor.&nbsp;After lunch, i am supposed to leave the camp already and the kids asked me to stay back with them. Haha...they funniest part is that the actually dowan their instructor and wanted me. This is not good cos it is in a way undermining my colleague. Tats y i decided to go home first and not return that night so as to give my colleague more time to build rapport with his kids. Nevertheless, the kids made me feel that i must come back and help them and him . Went home on Wednesday and back to the camp on Thursday afternoon. I neber expect to receive such warm welcome from them cos i oni took them for less than 2 hrs on Wednesday.&nbsp; Even the camp 2 i/c who came in&nbsp;midway thru&nbsp;the camp thought i was the grp instructor for that grp...hahaha  When i walked past the canteen ( they were having lunch) , they actually remembered me and called out to me. Had alot of fun with the grp...too bad did not conduct the night walk for them , if not i will scare the hell out of them...hahahaha.....  The main purpose of me going back to the camp is to support the campfire I/C who is doing it for the first time. These colleagues were a bunch of great peers and i think the least i can do is to support him by helping the kids prepare their camp fire presentation well and keep the spirits high during the campfire. Guessed with the ful support of all the grp instructors, the campfire was super smooth and good. The grp i attached myself to also did very well.   Too bad my camp days for this holidays is ending soon. Sigh. Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      1 word NUMB!!!!!!!!  Had my level 1 sports climbing course today. A very good course and had very good instructors. Really enhanced my knowledge about the equipment and practice used in climbing. Not bad today considering the last time i tried climbing is 6-7 yrs ago. Today i&nbsp;&nbsp;cleared the first wall which was a flat wall. Failed on the second wall though which was one with more contour and some overhang. Tried the wall twice and managed to clear 2 overhangs before i slipped on the way up. After this wall, my hands go totally NUMB!!!&nbsp;Got my level 1 sports climbing certification at the end of the day. I find climbing quite fun too......shd be climbing more often from now on. By the way, today we climbed without helmets....hmm...feels so light...not like the MOE campsites where helmets is compulsory....hahahaha........  My hands were so JIALAT that i have problems holding the clutch on my dad's bike. Super numb and pain. Tomolo got camp....i think i going to be chao slacker tomolo liao ....wish me good luck!!  &nbsp; Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Quite a good day for me today. Firstly, Innotrek confirmed that i am in for the next camp. Next, Ace Aventurer finally confirmed my "free" sportsclimbing lvl 1 course on sunday and i will be freelancing for them after the course....heehee....good catch cos the course cost ard 45-65 bucks and i am getting it for free with a chance to freelance in the future. &nbsp;Lastly, friend intro me to F.I.T , another outdoor company opened by former national swimmer David Lim, and i will be doing a camp for them this coming Monday.&nbsp;   &nbsp;Sheares Hall sent me an email to inform me that i am free to check in to the hall from today onwards. Since i am still working in camps, i wont staying in hall for quite a number of days for the next 2 weeks thus i will only check in just before school reopens. Guessed wont be participating in their orientation but hopefully can join in the Rag and Flag. Really looking forward to hall life ( hmm.....a little like Stay In during army dayz) . Would have to start training my fitness and badminton now cos i appealed into Sheares as an "import" .....cannot malu myself.  Gtg now....camp briefing in 4 hrs time.....

      Me back again liao from camp......  Incredible that my voice did not turn sexy this time rd....consider me a slacker or just a goody goody instructor that dont shout...hahaha.... Some of the campers call me the Macho Instructor that is soft cos they expect me to shout at them but i chose to negotiate with them and make pacts to get them to do work. I guess being the oni make instructor of chinese race helps me click better with the little BENGS...hahaa....&nbsp;Others call me the "Willam Hung" of the camp ( WAT SIAH!!!!!!)   I have my share of cock ups in this camp in conducting of some activities...such as morning PT. Lucky that no serious injuries happen. The senior instructors gave me some feedback on how i can improve it and things to look into the next time i conduct the activities and i appreciated that.   Next, I've met my first "silent killer" in this camp. There is this Sec 3 boy that simply would not talk thru out the camp, unwilling to participate in all activities except the General stations and team building games. Even though he participated in the GS and TB ....it was after "orders" from me that he joined in. On an occasion , he even went MIA while the group went kayaking. To think i have to go around searching for him siah!!! In the end, he was found sleeping in his hut. Just have to knock some senses into him. Although he wasn't too participative but i guess all the patience applied on him works cos during the campfire preparation session, i actually saw him joining the rest of the group in the preparation without any prompting. I take this as a personal achievement for me.   Overall, i enjoyed this camp alot cos this camp provided me with a very perspective on working with teenagers.   There will be another camp coming in august and i guess that will be my finale before returning to studies......it will be a 4D3N camp consisting of 320++ students ...the longest and biggest so far for me....expecting alot of problems and insturctors and ppl ....hopefully it will be as good as my previous camps.

      Today can be considered a special day in the CHOO family. My bro has become the first graduate&nbsp;from the&nbsp;CHOO family..... saw the pics he took at his convocation today. Can imagine after so many years of finally, it has finally ended for the time being. Soon it will be my turn ( i hope so... :P) .&nbsp; For me, i didn't attend his convocation though.....at home sleeping cos no point going when i cannot enter the auditorium and have to loiter outside for two hours...might as well sleep at home.  &nbsp; Went to the bank today to bank in my pay....very little oni....better than nothing lah...gonna save it for my hostel fees and allowance during the term period. Hmm...i still have 3 pay slips pending and a fourth pending after i do my camp on the 19th....once all of them come, my life shd be relatively comfortable....at least my hands are looser then.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      I'm back!!!!......with a very very very sexy voice (after all the shouting and Ra-Ra-ing in the camp) Learnt something new in this camp again. I never know tat a simple game like "simon says" can be so fun to the kids. The kids are so interested in this game that the conducting instructor can "coerced" the kids to do things if not he will not play the game with them. Now, i have a new game in my arsenal. I think i can consider myself very much involved in this camp than before cos i am starting to address the whole camp more liao!   In this camp i am involved in dispatching the kids for meals . The fun in this is that i get to control who gets their food first. To prevent a "cluster fuck" in the serving area, i would need to control number of students at each serving point Q-ing up for food. What we did was to make each grp shout their cheer and the loudest grp gets to collect their food and eat first. In this way we can  "entertain" those who are waiting for their turn to collect food while ensuring smooth flow , on top of a chance to bond each team.   In another game called the peanut game ( it is actually a singing response game), i actually led 4 grps against another 4 grps led by another instructor. This is my second time playing this game and i enjoyed it. The best part is the kids also enjoyed it. One thing is that this game was actually played becos i happened to be in the hall and there are only 2 ( including me)  instructors around ...so suck thumb got to help entertain the kids lor.   Next, was the POLAR BEAR game that i learnt from team sangkhim!!! Played this game with the kids. At first my intention is to test the game out and see if it works on pri sch kids. I thought the try was a disaster quite a few of the kids cheated and thus the captured the polar bear very quickly. But this morning i was very very surprised when they came and bugged me to play a game of polar bear before we break camp.   I was reading the feedback forms they handed in and found some comments very funny and interesting. Some of the words the kids used on me are " Best Instructor" , Great" , Humourous, Funny, Caring.....and the best one is one kid say i am HANDSOME!!!  Handsome, i agree lor...cannot deny that.....caring i always see that in other camps i did too....used to it liao :P ....Funny and Humorous....first time for me....i guess i really played like a kid on some occasion with them such act childish or teach them some cock stunts....Hahaha...too bad the one that say i am handsome is a boy.....cannot "cultivate" heehee...though there are really some cute girls in this camp...OHhhh No!!! I am starting to develope paedophile inclination!!!! :) , By the way, this is a Primary 5 Adventure camp for Blangah Rise Primary School.  I shall now rest my throat , or rather my fingers while i await my next camp next week with Pioneer secondary. Stay tuned for the photos that will be coming soon.......  To end this blog , i shall leave u with a cheer i learnt in this camp.   XIAO4 (smile)!!!!! XI3 CHIO3 XIAO3 BIAN4 ( pee)!!!!!!  XI3 Bang4 Jio3 YY........SAAT4 SAAT4 BO3 CHIO3 ( cool)  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      It is not the quantity of a blog that counts, it is the quality....  so i shall present a good piece of blog today after so many boring days.  Went Big Splash today with kaixiang and celin....they sun tan and call me go....as if i not dark enough siah....in the end i kayak there while they absord the vitamin D. Not bad work out today cos i managed to do my first ever hands-roll on a kayak. Went for dinner at east coast hawker center and we order a hell lot of food. Too full that i had to take an antacid pill for indigestion. Celin's van could not be started after the meal. I tried trouble shooting it ....i actually guessed the correct "general problem" that the circuits or connection is loose. Just that i am not familiar with cars ( me tank mechanic mah) , cannot pinpoint exactly where the problem is... in the end got to trouble her dad and mum down. Celin's dad just tighthen something near the engine and viola!! The vehicle just started.   Went to coffee bean and have a drink next. As usual a talk cock session with all sorts of rubbish.   Got a call from the camp coordinator that he need me to take over as group instructor for tomolo's camp. So now i upgraded from 1/2 x 2 day camp activity instructor to 3D2N group instructor. More work = More PAY = hopefully MORE FUN.   Going MIA for the next 2 days liao ...cheerios  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know

      Went for a mini-gathering at yiyong's hse today. Quite fun though....knowing everyone is healthy and well. Saw edward in crutches though...reminds me of the time i had my ankle operation and had to be in crutches too. Neber easy to move ard.   Watched Wimbeldon ladies Singles final there. Quite an interesting match watching with the friends. From the way they cheered, it will not be surprising if yiyong's neighbour thought Euro Finals started early. We nearly played POLAR BEAR today....too bad tennis took over before we even started....memorable game played in cambodia....heehee.....maybe next time i can use this game as a wet weather programme for my camps....hahahah  Spoke to the girls and they seem very curious and envious that kan wee and me are holding different jobs so different from what they are studying, Medicine. Quite possibly, the impression given was that our jobs are more interesting than what they are doing now and in the future. Future doctors ( dull, boring, no life job... :P). I would not want to make a comparison here but there is always this cycle. We are envious that these people are going to be future doctors that is going to earn big bucks in the future and they are envious that we are holding such interesting jobs ( with low pathetic pay). We can have the most interesting jobs in the world but we would not know where our next meal is coming from and vice versa....the trade off is there. Guessed just have to accept our "chosen" paths and make the best out of it. Anyway, who says we cant cross paths even when the routes are different??? Team Sangkhim is a very good example. If it can be done here, it can be done in the working world in the future  Supposed to meet celin and kaixiang for a drink at pasir ris but i was unable to make it down to pasir ris in time. Too bad lor...until next time.   Wasn't feeling well today....i doono how to say but the place below the sternum has this burning sensation ....not the first time liao .....i think is i neber eat enough for dinner. Tempted to buy some food on the way home but when i reached the kopitiam, i doono why i managed to control myself from ordering the food. Sad case...got to hunt the kitchen for food again.
