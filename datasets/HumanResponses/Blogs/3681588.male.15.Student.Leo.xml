      This is my pair of Stanton STR880 (straight) turntables. I've been mixing every day since I got them, and I'm seeing lots of improvement so far. We're thinking of doing a "Privee" (or private party) two weeks from now, in which some friends and I will mix all night long. Let's see how good I get so I can make one heck of a Show :p; I know my friends will (they're really good).

      After spending all night looking for stuff to do besides going to bed, I opened the door that connects the hallway to the bedrooms, and I felt this wall of cool breeze coming out... My first thought was that the guy had forgotten to turn off the emergency generator (and I was not going to remind him to after I entered ;) ). My brother kept telling me there was electricity; this was hard to believe, but when I woke up (still with my A/C on :D ) I asked my mom and surprisingly there was electricity!. THANKS MR. PRESIDENT FOR A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP!!! :p

      The planta (or emergency generator) of my building was just turned off about 20 minutes ago. I just realized it! Darn, now I have to sleep in my room without any A/C or fan. The back-up UPS that we got installed just gives electricity to one part of my apartment (the living room, the office, the kitchen, the dinning room and one bathroom). This is because my dad is a Software Developer and he can't afford not having electricity in the office, so we just rigged the UPS to light this part and that way it won't run out of batteries quickly. Well, gotta go, watch some tv, and sleep in my HOT room :S...

      (I just want to write some more here on my Blog:p)   I just got the Sony Ericsson T68i. My uncle Fabio gave it to me since my Nokia exploded (literally). It's pretty cool, in color, and it's got some really cool features and games! Also, battery lasts a lot!...

      The past week my aunt and I have been going out Geocaching down here in the city. This is a game played in the whole world which task is to get the cordinates and a pictures of specific things (like a treasure hunt) such as a zoo, an eternal flame, a round building, etc., and depending on how hard it was you get points and stuff. It's pretty cool and the only thing u need is a GPS and a camera. If you want to check it out, click here  urlLink click here .

      My name is Jose Felix III Hermida Pereyra (pretty long, right?). I live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, a small island in the middle of the Carribean, home of Sammy Sosa (famous Baseball Player) and other international sports player. I'll be 15 on August 4th while on school vacation (Babeque Secundaria, a private school since good education is not free) one of the best down here. Life in Santo Domingo is pretty cool, we get to hang out at many places most kids our age in other places of the world can't :D, such as bars,pubs, discos (or discotecas as we call them here). Night Life is very active here, you can go out ever since you become a teenager up until you're like really old. We just keep partying all night long :P...   We'll I gotta go because it's 10:30 and since there's no electicity they're gonna turn the  urlLink "planta"  off.

      Yeah, today is Friday, electricity just went out, I can't go out and life just takes one more step down (j/k I'm just pissed off because I can't go out :P)... This is life, directly from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
