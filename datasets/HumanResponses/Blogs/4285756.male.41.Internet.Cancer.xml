      Dexter Yager, a former beer truck driver turned billionaire, has for years been proclaiming from the stages of his various functions and rallies that Amway/Quixtar/Alticor made him what he is today.  When you become a member of Dexter's organization, you will be urged, prodded, and manipulated into purchasing "tools" and attending "functions" that are suppossedly designed to help you, the new distributor, get the training and motivation needed to get your business off to a fast start and build your business to the diamond level in 2-5 years.  Now what are all these "tools" (tapes, functions, books, etc) actually teaching you?   ..."I became Diamond because I committed myself to using the system"..."The system made me what I am today"..."If it had not of been for the system I would still be working a job"...   All these statements, and hundreds more just like them, are designed to do only one thing, and that is to  create  a  dependency  on the  system .  Now let's look at the checklist that Dr. Michael Langone, editor of  urlLink Cultic Studies Journal , created to help people decide if they or their family members are involved with a manipulative group (ie: cult).   The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment.   The next time you attend a major function or rally, take a good look at how Dexter is treated, referred to, etc. The "system" teaches you to edify your upline. It teaches you to defer to your upline. It teaches you to not question your upline, because according to the system, your upline is always correct.   The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.   The system stresses the importance of continually recruiting new members, and immediately getting them involved with "the system", because it's the only way that the new member will "stick".   The group is preoccupied with making money.   Well, that's obvious. Just look at how much money is truly in the "system". How much does it cost to duplicate a cassette? 25 cents? How much does it cost to duplicate a CD? $1.00? How much does it cost to duplicate a VHS video? $1.50? Why does a 25 cent tape cost $6.00? Why does a $1.50 video cost $30.00?   Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.   Don't pay any attention to the junk written on the internet...It's no better than a bathroom wall. Think about this...What's the fastest way to lose a friend in the Amway/Quixtar business? Tell him/her that you are quitting. I'd call that a punishment...especially if you were close.   Mind-numbing techniques (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines) are used to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).   Now repeat after me...  I'm going diamond. Flush that stinking job. Some will, some won't, so what, next.  How about a sing-a-long...  On the cover of the Amagram (or whatever it's called now)...Gonna see my picture on the cover, gonna buy 500 copies for my mother....gonna see my picture on the cover, on the cover of the Amagram...  Or maybe a rousing chorus of "Circles"...  While we're at it, let's throw some patriotism into the act and sing "The Star Spangled Banner".  How about this...  Show the Plan...Show the Plan...Show the Plan...STP STP STP STP STP STP STP STP STP...   The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example: members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children, and so forth).   Let's see...  If you are a man you need to be dressed in a black, dark blue, or dark grey suit, with a red tie. If you are a woman you need to be dressed in a conservative business suit/dress (no short skirts ladies) with low to medium heels. You need to confer with your upline prior to purchasing a car or house, because they have your best interests at heart and wouldn't want you to destroy your group by accident. If you're a man, you'll take control of your finances from your wife, because men are meant to lead their families. It doesn't matter if your wife is an accountant. It's your place to lead because you are the man. (and no I'm not a feminist)  I could go on.   The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and members (for example: the leader is considered the Messiah or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity).   My upline is better than your upline. "Who's your Diamond? Oh...I'm sorry." I remember saying that to someone in Bill Britt's organization (which is still just part of Dex's).  Also...why does the Sunday meetings always have a Church service? I'm not religious at all, but was made to feel guilty because I didn't attend these evangelical meetings. Why is Dexter trying to convert the vast population of the world to Christianity?   The group has a polarized us- versus-them mentality, which causes conflict with the wider society.   Do I even need to explain this?  I don't think so...it's too obvious.   The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities (as are, for example, military commanders and ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream denominations).   If you look at the way that Dexter is treated by Amway/Quixtar/Alticor, it's obvious that he is feared by Amway/Quixtar/Alticor. Think about this...what would happent to Amway's business if Dexter quit and decided to start his own MLM company. He has been running an illegal money scheme (the system) for years and Amway has known about it all along.  So does Amway hold Dexter accountable and answerable for his actions?  Obviously not.   The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered unethical before joining the group (for example: collecting money for bogus charities).   If you don't consider it unethical to accept money from an illegal money scheme (tools) then you too can get rich in the Amway business....but they sure don't explain that to the new distributor.  What about the "Curiousity Approach"? Why don't people just come out and tell you that they are trying to recruit you to the Amway business? Because if they did, you wouldn't join. The "Curiousity Approach" is both unethical and deceptive.   The leadership induces guilt feelings in members in order to control them.   I could write a book about this one statement alone. How many times have you been made to feel guilty because you would rather spend a little time with your family than go out and show the plan? What about the guilt you feel when you know that you aren't showing the plan enough? What about the guilt your upline forces on you when you tell your upline that you can't afford to purchase the books and tapes anymore?  What about the guilt you are forced to face because you failed in building your Amway business, since only losers, quitters, and people who lost their dreams fail to build an Amway business?  Which one are you?  Loser?  Quitter?  Lost your dream?   Members' subservience to the group causes them to cut ties with family and friends, and to give up personal goals and activities that were of interest before joining the group.   How many friends have you lost because of your affiliation with Dexter's Organization? How many family functions have you missed? How many of your hobbies and interests have you set aside, "just for a little while",  so you would have the "time" needed to build your business?   Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group.   Let's see...Show the Plan 4-5 nights per week, go to monthly meetings, go to monthly seminars and rallies, go to major functions 6-8 times per year, meet at the local Denny's/Shoney's/diner and build relationships with your upline/downline until 2am 3 nights per week, and on and on and on...   Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.   ..."You will discover that all of your  true  friends are in the Amway business"...  ..."It's not the money you make, or the fancy cars or houses that are important.  It's the relationships you build"...  ..."All of my friends are in the Amway business"...  and hundreds more statements just like this are only a tape away.   In Summary   I leave it to yourself to decide whether or not Dexter's System created a cult. I know what my personal beliefs are. Just remember, the choices you make now can change your life for the better...or the worse. It's entirely up to you. All I ask is that you put aside the system training for 10 minutes and think about what I've written here with an open mind. Decide for yourself whether you want to be involved with this "system". The choice is yours.

        			 As a distributor (now known as IBO’s) in the Yager Organization from 91-94, I listened to a bunch of different Diamonds at major functions give the awaiting masses the Definition of Insanity.  	  Doing the same thing year after year and expecting different results.   	 This only really makes me want to ask current IBO’s one question…  	 If you’ve been working the Amway/Alticor/Quixtar business for over 2 years and you still haven’t gotten to 7500 PV, don’t you think it’s about time that you listened to the Diamonds?   	 The Yager Organization promotes a 2-5 year plan to success. If you haven’t achieved even 7500 PV after 2 years, take a good long look at your business.   	 It’s possible you need to work a different plan.    	 One that isn’t insane.

      Back when I was with my first network marketing company (the Big A), the upper level distributors always talked about  "Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone" .  For almost 4 years I listened to this (brainwashing)   so much that it became ingrained in my habits.  So what happened when I left the Big A and moved on to another company? You got it...I would tell my new distributors that to be successful they had to "Get out of their Comfort Zone". Needless to say, this incorrect information passed on by the elite few in the Big A was in some measure responsible for the massive "sign up and quit" syndrome I experienced.  I've since learned a valuable lesson...and it only took me 10 years to learn after leaving the Big A. Do you want to know what it is?   People don't like getting out of their comfort zone, and they will avoid anything that causes them to do so.   I know what you're thinking.  Whoa.  Hold your horses.  How can I build a business without getting out of my comfort zone?  It's simple really.  Use the multitude of advertising methods that you feel  comfortable  with.  Try something simple like handing out business cards, flyers, local newspaper ads, etc. all pointing to a website that does all the selling and recruiting for you. Put your phone number on your site, so people can call you. Who's making the cold call now? The Prospect! Let today's technology weed out the people who aren't looking for what you're offering.  Your  Comfort Zone  can be an incredible strength, use it well.

      A friend asked me yesterday what I thought about buying leads. I gave him my standard answer and attempted to give him my reasons, even though I was too tired to be completely coherent.  Personally, I believe that buying leads of any kind (email, phone, etc) is a complete waste of your advertising budget. Unless you are looking to become a phone pro...and if that is your goal...don't buy leads, just pick up the phone book from any major metropolitian area and start with the letter 'A'.  There are much more effective ways of advertising, and I'd recommend that you look at every method available prior to picking up the phone and doing cold calls.  Here's the short list of low and no cost advertising:        Google Adwords  - Low cost and effective. You'll also learn some important skills, such as writing headlines, writing ad copy, and targeting your audience.      Free Classified Ads  - There are literally thousands of sites on the net where you can place a small classified ad for free...however, avoid any form of free for all (FFA) pages.      Business Cards  - The single most under-rated and powerful form of advertising that you can perform locally. Try this...setup a website that explains your opportunity, then get 1000 business cards that have only your website on it (and nothing else) and pass them out. Your goal should be to pass out 1000 business cards every week. By putting 4000 business cards out every month (48,000/year) you'll be generating a ton of traffic to your website which does the selling and recruiting for you. Simple and effective.      Local Niche Newspaper Classified Ads  - There are thousands of small newspapers in the US that are published weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly. They are usually significantly cheaper than advertising in your local newspaper and depending on the paper, may be more targeted as well.      Magnetic Car Signs  - If you drive any distance at all, these are very effective at getting the word out.      Flyers  - Cheap to print and effective if well written.  You can hand them out, post on supermarket bulletin boards, etc.    There are literally hundreds of ways to market your business that are, in my opinion, more effective than cold calling. Pick up any of the Guerilla Marketing books and you'll get even more tips.

      And that's what this is...a first step.  I've lost count of the number of different companies that I joined in the previous 10 years. It seems that I, like so many others, was always jumping on the newest program....but never working one business long enough to get any measure of true success. And that's the key. Or at least part of it.  After really looking at the background and personal history of the "heavy hitters" (oh how I hate those words), I realized one simple fact. They all have a few traits in common. The foremost trait was committment. They were actually committed to making a success of their new business.  And this is where I as a Network Marketing Junkie failed. I failed to make a committment to any of the businesses I was involved with. I failed to commit to working the business a specific number of hours each day. I failed to make a committment with my downlines. I failed to make a committment with my uplines. I failed to make a committment to myself.  ...so what's the first step?  I made a committment to myself, that no matter what, I would never fail to be committed to my business again.  Am I looking for the perfect Network Marketing Opportunity anymore?  Nope.  I realized it doesn't exist.  I've made a committment to the business that I'm involved with.  There is nothing in this world that can stop someone who is committed to achieving their goal.  So, my fellow Network Marketing Junkies, I invite you to admit that you have a problem, and take that first simple, but powerful, step and commit to your goals.
