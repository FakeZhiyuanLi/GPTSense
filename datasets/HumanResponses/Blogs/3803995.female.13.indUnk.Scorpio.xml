       Lauren is about to ask some&nbsp;rather dumb&nbsp;questions, if you are reading this please answer them in a comment as Lauren likes to know stuff.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     What is your name?      What sex are you?      Who sent you here?      Why are you even bothering looking at this?      Are you stupid?      Do you concider yourself to be :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A, insane?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B, idiotic?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C, both?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or D, none of the above (please state in one word how you would describe yourself) ?      Are you bored of reading and answering dumb questions?      Do you have a pet(s)? (only a yes or no needed, dont go into detail or Lauren will get bored)      Why are you still reading these dumb questions?      Do you concider Lauren to be:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A, insane?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B, idiotic?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C, both?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or D, none of the above (please state in one word how you would describe Lauren) ?      Is Lauren stupid?      WHY THE HELL ARE YOU STILL READING?      Are you glad this is the last question?

       Lauren spends most of her life on the computer, it is not her fault, she has nothing better to do as Lauren is weird exccentric fool. So if you would like to contact Lauren at any time, Lauren doesn't mind as she is usually at the computer from the hours of 9-11am and then 2-9pm, but if   I were you  &nbsp;  wouldn't bother contacting Lauren as she may be blonde but she is not stupid and will not talk to comlete strangers. if you do know Lauren when trying to contact her answer this simple question "what is Laurens pet leprechaun's name?". This question is required to be  answered to talk to Lauren   . Do you like the colours&nbsp;Lauren has used, if so, leave a comment, if not, leave a comment, Lauren likes to hear from you either way.Lauren is bored now but has to say something to carry on the colour pattern, so if what Lauren says makes no sense  whatsoever, dont worry, it is 11pm and Lauren is tired, but&nbsp;Lauren has to keep typing because otherwise the whole colour thintg will be lost. Lauren only has to type one and a half more lines now, oh wait, that just decreased by&nbsp;Lauren telling you that Lauren only had one and a half lines    left. Ohhhhhhhh, now i've gone over never mind
