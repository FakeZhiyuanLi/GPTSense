      mmmhmm so Im over my dad's and Johnny's cousins are here and he's playing football with one of them.... lol he's constantly barraging him in the game because he is so "bad" lol its quite amusing... I rented Rallysport Challenge 2 and hope to play it online and whup the crap out of some people on there.. which I know I will so.. hmm.. not much more.. I installed two monitors... I don't know if they will keep them here buut it was worth the try and challenged my expertise lol cause I had many problems with the original monitor on the GeForce 4 MX440

      lol lol lol i think we might have a small misunderstanding with these Megatokyo posts I have been putting up..... these are not... my drawings... lol... I do draw.. and plan to post one of them up here soon... but... once again you'll see my drawings when they come up... lol...   also.... I am planning on creating my own drawings of Megatokyo considering how much I like the characters on the webcomic... so.. just wait for my real drawings... and..... i really do wanna draw some megatokyo.. and I think I'll be able to do it really well my others have been good so far..  you'll see a couple sometime soon.. the first one will be up as soon as I am able to put together the huge scan I made just now...

      Well.... I recently (recently as in the last 3 hrs) read all of the Megatokyo webcomic leading up to the last strip published.... and i feel like a little girl of some sort... the love twists in that comic felt odd.. my stomach in knots and everything.... *sigh* just makes me wish I had someone to love and be loved by... so bad.. right now.. *sigh*... well.. what can I do about it?  No one seems to like me that way.... sometimes it just makes me feel all lonely...  Why Can't I Find Someone To Love?

      heheheh yes.. Im going to a LAN party tomorrow night... me old g/f is gonna be there.. aaand its gonna be really fun... Jopey cant go.. which really sucks... but.. at least my brother is going..  so that means Im going to be playing better games than I was at the LAN party before... hehe... I should go and train up a little... in CS MOHAA and UT2004... but.. I might not.. lol because I wont get around to doing it.. I think they might like the way I have my computer set up right now... so I might be giving them some files over the network... hehe with my ObjectDock down at the bottom of my screen.. and my Windowblinds theme set on DogmaX Ive got a pretty smooth theme going...especially with the Mahoro In a Wet Kimono background... (no you can't see anything) hehe yeah so... I really can't wait till tomorrow at like 5PM.. cause that's when I think we're heading out of this dump..

      Well well.. after some more "tweaking" with Doom 3.. I have found that it actually runs SLOWER now.. with the new "tweaks" from the EB forums... and Humus.. what Ive decided to do.. is go back to the way things were.. without the Rage3D tweaker and without the new "tweaks" for Doom 3... hopefully that will restore system performance and Doom 3 performance.. also.. I had found a way before to take off the 30FPS cap on Doom 3.. but with the new tweaks that were in there... it has seemed to re-enable the 30FPS cap... which I hate.. well.. maybe it'll go back after this reboot and everything is back to normal... btw.. Norton Systemworks is giving me a little trouble.. by refusing to start up and keep Norton Antivirus ccApp open.. (the Antivirus monitoring program) and it just found about 230 problems with Windows.. so maybe that might help with my problems as well... aaand its about 5:15AM and I'm tired.. so I think I'll go to bed after this.. and I'll have to take a shower tomorrow as well.. because.. well.. I have to with all of this hair lol I feel like I have more hair than Frankie (my pug) ahhh I hope all will be well after this restart I do.. maybe it will.. maybe it won't.... we'll find out! hehe.. well.. I will.. but anyway.. I have to post another Megatokyo pic before I go to bed.. so look out above for it in a couple mins..

      mhmm this is wierd.. I like my computer tons more now then before the Reboot... this is really wierd.. lol Ive got everything perfectly configured.. working.. and everything its allll really good hehehehe listening to some Third Eye Blind on iTunes and on my Fav. Headphones.. hehe my Bose Triport Headphones.. my brother is in his room playing Doom 3 so its all good Im gonna have to steal it from him to try some of my new Doom 3 tweaks I just put in to make the game more enjoyable and such my object dock is getting bigger by the minute.. I just finished downloading and installing Nero 6 Pro and just really waiting for some anime to download so I can watch them and give my opinion (on here of course) and also if I want to buy it.. when they come out that is of course... Popotan is going to be very interesting because of all of the Fan Service.. and Midori No Hibi Days 4 is going to be funny... just like the rest of the episodes I've seen so far (which includes 1, 2, and 3) so I know it is going to take forever.. but I can wait.. hopefully not forever.. but a long time.. Shareaza is so much better then Morpheus and Kazaa Lite K++ because it searches more networks and has no spyware.. runs faster.. looks better.. and is more reliable... the only problem is people queing you for the downloads you want.. I dont see what the big problem is in letting everyone in at the same time.. except bandwidth... I guess theyre trying to maximize download speeds for everyone... so I can wait... hehe yeah.. I think I can type to goddamn fast... my hands are like flying all around this keyboard.. which just started to happen recently.. I think its because I've been typing a lot more lately... hehe my dad once asked if I was really typing or just putting up jibberish hehe he was all surprised to hear I was actually typing instead of doing what he thought... hehe yeah so.. I think I might play some Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 because Ive got nothing better to do.. and Im not going to disrupt Shareaza's downloads because then I'll have to wait at the end of the line again.. and.. my RAM is close to full anyway so a game would pretty much kill it... except Thief Deadly Shadows which barely takes up any RAM... it takes up like 4 megs in game... heheh I might play that after Marvel Vs. Capcom 2... yeah so I had better stop typing now because I'll soon start explaining what I think I'm gonna do for the next like 5 weeks which would be like a whole new page on my Blog.. so yeah.. I think I'll stop now... Toodles

      Oh yeah.  Took me one day to get from crap to polished computing.. hehe Im back up and running baby!  got everything back up.. even better than before... Im using a bit more RAM than I'd hope to.. buuut its desktop computing and not gaming so it doesnt matter.  Also Ive got Trillian back and as well as Shareaza back up and downloading stuff I shouldnt hehehehe yeah aaand im monitoring ATi's stock on my ObjectDock so.. it's all good I feel like I wanna play a game.. but then again I dont.. so.. lol Im a tad confused.. also.. its been way to damn long since there has been a pic on here.. so I think im gonna post a Doom 3 pic.. or another little something from Megatokyo.. or both.. yeah so watch out

      DAMN! My boot.ini is screwed up on my normal computer so I can log back into it until later today... which sucks majorly... but its not that bad if I think about it... hey.. I might get more sleep tonight.. lol.  I'm on my mom's computer right now.. in my room of course because it is a laptop.. though painfully slow compared to my computer.. it still does what it has to do to work..  and I can still access Blogger! and Megatokyo of course lol.  Buuut I cant post any pics from the computer... and thank god for Mike Deonorain.. he has boot disks of Windows XP so I can repair my installation.. hehe yes he's going to leave it for me before he leaves so I dont have to wait long before I get it... I might take my brother's bike over there just for the sake of time.. but.. I might hurt the disc if it is in my pocket... unless it is in a case.. which it miiight be..  well anyway.. a couple other reasons its bad for me to be off my normal computer is that I dont have all my social programs, no music(except my minidisc), no Porn (shhhhhh), no normal pics, No "my computer lifestyle" environment, no games, aaand of course my computers monster speed.. mhmm well.. I think ive rant'ed enough for now.. I might post another before I leave for bed.. so watch out! hehe

      mhmm here i am at 3:15 am we got a new puppy.. adding another dog to the household lol its a Pug/Jackrussel mix.. adding to our other dog..who is a purebred Pug the new dogs name is Annie.. and our purebred Pug is named Frankie.. if I had a Digital Camera I could take a picture.. buuut I dont.. so.. yeah... hehe the little puppy is so wiry and energetic hehe and has really sharp teeth.  Weelll anyway.. Ive edited Doom 3 and other things on my computer to make the game run faster.. hehe and it does.. I can run it at 1280x1024 on High Detail hehe which is really good for a last generation High End video Card. My brother runs it at 800x600 on Medium Detail which is good.. I guess.. for a last Generation Mid-Range video card.. which is a Radeon 9600XT and mine is a Radeon 9800 Pro.. with a Modded heatsink from Zalman.  my case is open.. but that is only to improve cooling inside the case.. with my AMD Athlon 64 3200+, Asus K8V Deluxe, 512mb PC 2100 DDR, Radeon 9800 Pro, 3DFX Voodoo 3 2000 Sec, 100GB WD1000 HD, and a 450 Watt Pow. Supply... lol.. I just went on a computer Rant.. im sorry.. it was bound to happen.. hehe.. well.. I'm on my way to beating Doom 3 again... about.. 1/4 the way through.. and well.. in other news.. my g/f.. is.. *sigh* madly in love with me.. hehe which is good.   Ahh well.. I might see her on Monday.. she's gonna wake me up this morning on the phone... so... I kinda have to go to bed before 5AM lol

      Hehe you know... Its odd sometimes how long it'll take me to catch onto something good... I just got home and now I started listening to Avril Lavigne now.. hehe I like it... and she's kinda cute to.. so.. lol already have all three of her albums including her Live Acoustic album which is good too.. I have my computer turned the way it should.. and it feels more natural and less cluttered like this.. and it makes my computer seem more streamlined. Its always fun to have something new that you like isnt it?
