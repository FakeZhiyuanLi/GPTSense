        “It’s okay if you can stand to let her dance. It’s okay it’s your right, come on and take a chance.”  – Cat Power, “Free.”  For whatever reason, I during my brief time as a music writer I have probably had more conversations with musicians and other writers about Chan Marshall, aka Cat Power, than any other contemporary artist.  Certainly her name comes up more often than Sleater-Kinney (my very favorite rock band – and who my friends believe are an obsession), the White Stripes (arguably the hottest rock band today – whom I also love dearly), Justin Timberlake (whose  Justified  album was one of the most pleasant surprises I’ve encountered as a CD reviewer), or Wilco or Death Cab for Cutie (two hipster faves that I have trouble sinking my teeth into, despite numerous attempts).  The topic is never how great her records are (although the few that I own I found having great moments of inspired songwriting and beautiful harmonies, but often inconsistent).  No, everyone seems to want to talk about her live shows, as her stage fright is the stuff of legends: she is known to play entire stretches of her set with her back to the audience,  stop in the middle of songs and start over and other bizarre behavior you would not expect from an established, nationally known musician.  I saw her twice (she opened a pair of dates for Sleater-Kinney in Seattle last December) before last weekend and I thought both times she performed pretty well, although unmemorable either way – her sets were not train wrecks, or were they inspiring or brilliant.  “I thought she was pretty good” is not great party conversation and I’ve found the idea of being drawn to her disastrous performances as kind of like laughing at the poor kid at school, so I’ve never really been comfortable being in conversations about her.  Last weekend, when she played at the Sasquatch! festival at the Gorge in Eastern Washington, the first 40 minutes of her set were hard to watch.  She sat at her piano (which she rarely, if at all) almost motionless behind dark sunglasses in a heavy, hooded sweatshirt.  Between songs she’d ask the crowd “whasssssuuuupppppp????” in a bizarre voice and let out some weird noises and said little else.  It was painful to watch, but I couldn’t possibly leave my great spot in the crowd as the New Pornographers and SK were the two following bands – both favorites of mine.  With five minutes left in her allotted 45 minutes, Marshall’s backing band left the stage and a DJ started to play a record that was very familiar to me, but I’m not sure to how many others in the large crowd.  It was the voice of a very young girl saying something like, “this next song is our first song, and it’s also our rap song. It’s called ‘Rad.’” The band being played was the amazing Seattle sister act Smoosh (for more info, see their web site  urlLink www.smoosh.com  or read my article in the current issue of ROCKRGRL).  After one false start, Marshall proceeded to dance and lip synch to “Rad,” a song written by two girls that are probably a third of her age.  It was one of my absolute favorite moments in watching live music (and I’ve been to probably hundreds of rock shows in the past few years).  Cat Power had seemed to toss out all of the hang-ups that dogged her throughout the previous forty minutes (and much of her career) and bedroom-danced before a crowd of thousands with an obvious joy rarely seen among indie-rock performers (the only thing that would have made it more perfect would be for her to replace her turned-off microphone with a hairbrush).  I’m sure I saw Smoosh for the first time the same time Cat Power did (Smoosh and Marshall were the first and second acts opening for SK late last year) and was drawn to the great, fun, catchy pop music that they were making.  It reminded me of the when I fell in love with pop music: when I heard the Beach Boys for the first time.  I’ve almost forgotten the first forty minutes of her set, but I’ll always remember her dancing to “Rad.”  It’s a moment I’d be more than happy to talk about with anyone who will listen.  Of course saying “Cat Power gave the most fun live performance I’ve ever witnessed” is something no one would ever believe if they didn’t see it for themselves

         urlLink "Radical or Pro-Parental,"  by Julie Ruin (from the album  Julie Ruin , Kill Rock Stars, 1998)  Available at:  urlLink http://www.killrockstars.com/bands/julieruin/audio/RadicalOrProParental.mp3   As a means of boosting traffic to this blog and simultaneously promoting some song or other that I happen to love (or merely like an awful lot) I decided to create this little feature.  In this space each week you can find a link to a truly great song (and hopefully some insightful and engaging rock criticism).  The best part is that it is completely free and legal.  I can't do anything about the other 2,700 mp3s from Kazaa that are already on your hard drive, but, hey, it's a start.  I imagine that if I keep this up column up for the next 150 years, I can fill up my iPod with a clear conscience (I'll be a youthful 175 when I'm finished!).  "Radical or Pro-Parental" is the lead track off of the only record Kathleen Hanna recorded under the pseudonym Julie Ruin.  It is also the obvious logical step between Hanna's previous band, Bikini Kill, and her current one, Le Tigre.  Both are amazing for very different reasons.  Bikini Kill was driven by Hanna's desire to bring young girls into a hard rock culture they were previously (and by and large still) excluded from.  Le Tigre is more-or-less Hanna outgrowing the punk rock of Bikini Kill, instead preferring electro-based pop music.  But whereas Le Tigre is expansive and ambitious with an amazing visual presentation during their live shows, Julie Ruin is based on minimalism.  Most of the record was recorded in Hanna's old Olympia, Washington apartment with very lo-fi production.  "Radical" is the best song on  Julie Ruin .  It is a perfect battle cry for the cultural war the Bush administration and the FCC seem to be waging against anyone not outraged by the sight of Janet Jackson's breast during the Super Bowl.

       A little over a week ago, I was fortunate enough to catch a screening of the powerful and fascinating documentary  DiG!  at the Seattle International Film Festival.  Director Ondi Timoner set out to document a supposed mid-90s musical revolution, led by the Brian Jonestown Massacre and their ultra-talented, but seriously troubled leader Anton Newcombe.  Why was Newcombe and his brand of garage rock going change the world?  Because he said so.  But Newcombe needed accomplices and he allowed Timoner to witness history in the making.  Also along for the ride was the promising Portland band The Dandy Warhols, hand-picked by Newcombe to complement his coronation as a ruler of rock.  Both bands were going to make rock and roll fresh again by invoking the sounds of their musical idols.  Neither band was shy about naming their influences.  Hell, there influences were in their titles.  The BJM wanted to hearken back to the days of the nihilism and rock and roll debauchery of the Rolling Stones (Brian Jones was the original rhythm guitarist for the Stones and the BJM named an LP  Their Satanic Majesties Second Request ) and anyone who drew the conclusion that the Dandy Warhols were a poppier revivalist of the always hip Velvet Underground would not be mistaken.  If anyone thinks this sounds a little too much like the White Stripes and the Strokes, keep in mind that Jack White never let heroin fuck things up.  As Dandy's frontman and Dig! narrator Courtney Taylor points out during the opening that Newcombe was his one of his musical heroes and inspirations, but their friendship turned into his biggest regret.  How this becomes is exactly what makes DiG! such a fascinating study in the internal dynamics of two similar bands whose careers faced two diametrically different trajectories once they met.  Taylor concedes in the beginning that Newcombe is the stronger songwriter of the two - and he probably is.  But Newcombe is also a junkie.  Miranda Lee Richards, an accomplished singer/songwriter and one of about fifty former members of the BJM, points out tellingly that most rock stars waited until they got famous before becoming problem drug users.  At the beginning of their friendship (circa 1995 or 96), Newcombe relocates the BJM from San Francisco to Portland, but the Dandys not amused: they foresaw numerous problems.  Of course they were right.  Newcombe spiralled further and further out of control - at his lowest point he kicks a concert-goer in the face for saying that his ex-girlfriend (who opened the show) was a better performer than Newcombe (something to keep in mind next time a musician asks the audience to come in closer to the stage).  He is also filmed punching and berating his fellow band members.  As a sort of public intervention for their friend, Taylor wrote a song titled "Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth" (chorus: "I never thought you'd be a junkie / because heroin is so passe").  It was supposed to be the Dandys' breakthrough hit as Capitol Records planned to promote it heavily and hired the famous celebrity photographer David LaChappelle to direct the video.  Newcombe responded by releasing a single titled "Not If You Were the Last Dandy On Earth" and hands out copies to audience members outside a Warhols show, taunting Taylor and company in the process.  Newcombe is obviously jealous and resentful of the Dandys' success as it seems as though for everything negative that happened to the BJM is followed by something positive for the Dandys.  After Newcombe (and Timoner) are arrested in Georgia for heroin possession, the Dandys are searched for French authorities for marijuana.  They have it, but long arm of the French law let them off by paying a fine of a few Dandy Warhols t-shirts (and even let them keep their weed).  Shortly after the Warhols signed to Capitol Records, Newcombe fucked up the chance to sign with a major and was forced to sign with an indie (and their band manager sent tamborine player Joel Gion to dot the i's and cross the t's - the often volatile Newcombe was too much of a wildcard to be trusted).  Anyone who ever wondered why Pearl Jam and the Clash had longer careers in the music biz than Nirvana and the Sex Pistols (excluding the Pistol's various embarrassing reunion tours) would be have their questions answered by DiG!  The Dandy Warhols were never hugely popular (although they were more successful in Europe) and always had trouble maintaining their artistic integrity after signing with Capitol.  As we all know, the garage rock revolution Newcombe dreamed of did occur (albeit eight years later), but he was left on the sideline watching, as there were few people he has yet to piss off.  He is probably working a song called "Not if You Were the Last Stroke on Earth."

       The best music documentaries are great when they capture an unexpected moment that signifies an important part of their generation.  D.A. Pennebaker's  The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars  perfectly captured the heights of rock star arrogance when David Bowie announced from the stage that this would be the final peformance of his band, the Spiders From Mars, much to the chagrin and surprise of everyone not named David Bowie (and that does include his band).   Gimme Shelter  films the Hell's Angels killing a black man at the Altamont Speedway while the Rolling Stones performed "Under My Thumb," not "Sympathy for the Devil" as popular legend tends to believe, incorrectly.  Is there a greater example of nihilism and hedonism in the post-Woodstock world.  In the present tense, it appears that everyone needs a therapist for everything;  Metallica: Some Kind of Monster  inadvertently documents that idea.  That's not the goal is to document the comeback of the popular hard-rock band after an absense of several years.  Unfortunately,  Monster  has all the makings of an E! True Hollwood Story ("Metallica was flying high...until it all came crashing down."  There are several moments where it appears that the band cannot sink any lower and the crashes become obvious and do not elicit any sympahty.  Those moments include when bassst Jason Newsted leaves the band, when guitarist James Hetfield enters rehab, when guitarist James Hetfield leaves rehab, when Newsted snubs the rest of his old band after a show by his new band.  The triumphant return begins when they are selected as "Icons" by MTV and culminates with the selection of Robert Trujillo to become the new bass player and the release of the  St. Anger  record.  Ironically, Trujillo played bass for Ozzy Osbourne and joined Metallica.  The most famous person to ever piss on the Alamo selected Newsted to replace Trujillo.  The problem with  Monster  is that it the film seems to be a too-long (135 minutes) and never really documents anything too important (unless you count drummer Lars Ulrich and Hetfield complaining to and about one another.  Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett never really says anything that isn't pseudo-new age bullshit (along the lines of 'why can't we all just get along').  The obvious quid pro quo between the film makers, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, to make a positive portrayal of the band in exchange for almost unfettered access is not lost - and the movie even deals with the financial stake the band has in the making of the documentary.  Of course, Ulrich, Hammett, Hetfield and producer Bob Rock are given almost papal status by their adoring fans behind the lens.  Conversely, band therapist Dr. Phil Towle, Newsted, and former guitarist Dave Mustaine are the villains.  The most emotional scene in the film is when Mustaine sits in with a therapy session with the band and Dr. Phil.  He details the emotional pain he's gone through for being the guy kicked out of Metallica.  The film makers depict him as a whiny rock star (and mention that his band Megadeath has sold over 15 million records), but he's really the only musician to express any complex emotions in this film.  Of course the film ends with the release of the St. Anger album.  It is noted that it debuts at number one in 30 different countries, but no one (fans or critics) considers it to be one of their best LPs.  The fact that the band almost broke up numerous times and could barely stand to be in the same room as one another and yet came together to release an (adequate) album should be enough to justify the sainthood this film places on Metallica.  It is not enough.  When you are one of the biggest rock bands in the world and you've spent millions of dollars making a decent record, pretty good is simply not good enough.  Maybe next time Sinofsky and Berlinger will choose a band that still matters and maybe then they can make a film that will be memorable.  This one is not the one.

       Ronald Reagan died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The newspaper from  urlLink Washington  says: NATION, WORLD PAY TRIBUTE TO REAGAN. BODY TO LIE IN STATE AT THE CAPITOL; STATE FUNERAL SET FOR FRIDAY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.

       It looks like it is official.    urlLink Creed has broken up .  To commemorate this important event (which happened about three weeks too late to be included in the list of the 50 greatest rock moments in the new issue of   urlLink Rolling Stone  ) I have compiled a top five list of my all-time favorite Creed memories.  My absolute favorite Creed moment was in June 2000, when their former bassist Brian Marshall gave an  urlLink interview  to Andy Savage formerly of 107.7 The End in Seattle where Marshall said that Pearl Jam wished they could be as good as Creed.  Too bad Savage left The End for another Seattle station: the entire audio from the interview was stored on the End's web site for quite some time.  My second favorite Creed memory was when they  urlLink were sued by two fans who thought one of their concerts sucked .  I believe the case was eventually thrown out, as the judge pointed out that the Creed "fans" had to have known they were a shitty band prior to purchasing tickets.  My third favorite Creed memory is when Scott Stapp's ex-wife  urlLink kicked his ass .  Fourth on the Creed's magical moment list was in April 2002.  Scott Stapp tells  Spin :  You can say what you want about this band, but it is undeniable. It's very similar to Led Zeppelin. The first three albums, they got bashed basically from the entire media, and it wasn't until their forth album that everybody accepted the fact that Led Zeppelin were gonna be there and be around. We'er kind of starting to feel that way.  Rounding out the top five was when Creed's manager's rationalized and apologized for item number two on this list (but they did not offer an apology to Mick Jagger).   urlLink They said, and I honestly did not make this up:   For now we hope that you can take some solace in the fact that you definitely experienced the most unique of all Creed shows and may have become part of the unusual world of rock'n'roll history! Again, we apologize if you didn't enjoy the show but remember, 'It's only rock'n'roll but we like it!'  Honorable mention goes to Dexter Holland, Phd,  and singer of the Offspring, for wearing a t-shirt during a LA radio station's festival a couple of years ago that said "Even Jesus Hates Creed."  For more on this momentous event, please check  urlLink creedsucks.com  for breaking news and commentary.

       It's almost midway through 2004 and I'm already thinking of my top 10 list of favorite albums in 2004.  If you've seen (or read)  Hig Fidelity , you know this is not an exaggeration.  Right now,  Underachievers Please Try Harder  by Camera Obscura is the only album right now that is sure to be on my list in six more months.  This could potentially be a difficult list to compile, as most of my recent favorites are not expected to release records in 2004 (White Stripes, Strokes, Sleater-Kinney, New Pornographers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Fountains of Wayne, to name a few).  I may be forced to actually listen to the records I review again.  Lately the album that has been in the heaviest rotation on my iPod has been  Pawn Shoppe Heart , the major-label debut from Detroit's Von Bondies.  It is far from a great record, but it is an interesting case study, nonetheless.  There are some great moments: the first single "C'mon, C'mon" is my favorite rock 'n roll anthem since the former (and late) Jeffrey Hyman shouted "Hey, Ho, Let's Go!" throughout "Blitzkrieg Bop."  It should also be noted that Carrie Smith is the most underrated bassist in rock today.  She has many memorable basslines throughout  Pawn Shoppe Heart , including several solos.  She also sings lead on "Not that Social", which frontman Jason Stollsteimer wrote for her.  Although getting sole songwriting credit on the record, Stollsteimer is the band's biggest liability.  Putting aside his willingness to (probably) start a fight with the biggest rock star to come in contact with his band for a moment, the biggest problem is that Stollsteimer tries to sing like he's in a metal band.  The Von Bondies are a punkish, garage band with great pop sensibilities (especially with Smith's and guitarist Marcie Bolen's backing harmonies), yet Stollsteimer's vocals are often more fitting of speed metal band.  When he's not channeling Scott Weiland or James Hetfield, or the music is as abrasive as he is, the results are phenomenal.  See, for example, "C'mon, C'mon," "Crawling in the Dark," and "Tell Me What You See."  Of course, Stollsteimer will always be known as the guy who got his sorry ass kicked by Jack White.  Trying to ignore my worshipping of all that is White and Striped, it is difficult to argue that either party is completely innocent.  White pleaded guilty to assault, so I'm not going to defend attack (or necessarily defend) him.  But Stollsteimer did take several opportunities to slam White and call into question his role as the producer of their first record.  He told a reporter that White "sat in the studio and made sure we didn't kill each other; that's it."  Again, I'm not saying White was justified in attacking Stollsteimer, but he probably would not have gotten his ass kicked if he said something like, "we are grateful to work with White, who has supported us and took us on tour as the White Stripes were starting to become a big deal. But I don't either of us want to be his pet project and we want our records and shows to be judged on their own merit."  Or something like that.  Being one of White's bands is no guarantee of success, nor does it mean his ear is to the ground.  For example, the first band that he signed to his "Third Man" division of V2 records is the Whirlwind Heat, another Detroit band he took on tour with the Stripes during the  White Blood Cells  days.  It would be charitable to say that the Whirlwind Heat is not a very good band, but my friend Dana from  urlLink threeimaginarygirls.com  put it best when she wrote, "who? Um, Whirlwind suck is more like it."  Where was I?  Oh that's right, the Von Bondies.  They truly could become a great band.  They have a tight rhythm section and Stollsteimer writes really good songs.  They also put on a great live show.  All they need is for him to be a little more quiet and they could become the next, um, White Stripes or Strokes, or the next Guns 'n Roses.  Hmmm. Tough choice.
