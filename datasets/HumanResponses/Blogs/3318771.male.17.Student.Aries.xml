        Here are the latest pictures from Maria Sharapova's latest tournament; " WTT 2004 " About her not getting into the Olympics in Athens, I feel its a huge waste of talent, she just beat Venus Williams at the Wimbledon Open and I am sure that proved her ability to compete against the very best.   &nbsp;   Maria last night played her first tournament since Wimbledon, a WTT exhibition.&nbsp; The final score was that Maria's team the Newport Beach Breakers beat the Sacramento Capitals 23-16.&nbsp; Maria played 3 matches and won 2 and lost 1.&nbsp; In singles Maria lost 3-5 to Nicole Vaidisova.&nbsp; In doubles Maria teamed up with Nana Miyagi and they beat Anastassia Rodionova and Nicole Vaidisova 5-3 and in mixed doubles Maria teamed up with Ellis Ferreria and they beat Mark Knowles and Rodionova 5-4          Played Football and Badminton today. During my break, we played with some guys who were playing on the field. We won 3-2, I scored 2 goals and Kang Heong scored a goal. A great goal, I might add, dribbled past 1 guy, and got a shot past the keeper at the near post. I scored 2 curling goals from far, and not to forget I hit the shot into the bar once, which denied my hattrick, oh well, time to work much harder. As for the second football session, it was nice, casual playing and relaxing too. Then on to badminton, not much free courts to play on, I guess it was quite a busy day due to it being the last day of the week and everyone wanted to relax. I realised my smashing is getting better and better, hopefully I can reach my best in time to come, but its sure good to play once again.   That's all for now! Will write more tomorrow.&nbsp;

        School was pretty normal today, played badminton with staik and at that time, I injured my left ankle again. I don't know why but that part of my leg is increasingly getting weaker, I can't seem to stand balanced on that foot alone. And what's worst, another sprain occurred when the old 1 suffered a week ago hasn't fully recovered. Oh well, I hope to be recover as quickly as possible.   I met Sumitha later on and we watched <>, quite a decent movie although I wouldn't say the girls were decent, more like bitches in their dressing style. But in the end all turns well, I would rate it 3.4/5, so far no movie has been able to reach 4.0 and higher yet besides Pearl Harbor, hopefully I would be able to find a movie which will excite me soon.   I am considering on joining track and field, I don't know whether I should because Sports Club is extremely slack, it has been 2 weeks and so far no activities but hopefully there would be some break throughs soon.

        When I went to Milanmania forums, there was 1 Singaporean who said he supported Lazio but at the same time he liked Totti, why is that so? Its so peculiar, I hate Totti for his guts for his arrogance and mostly for his behaviour. Maybe he is just 1 of those supporters who support Lazio for the sake of supporting but at the same time he follows other teams in the EPL and SPL. As for me, I am only dedicated to Lazio, everyday of my life, I follow Lazio. How? Through the best site in the world  urlLink http://www.laziofever.com &nbsp;where all the Laziali in the world unite from Asia, to Europe, to the Middle East, to the South America and to the U.S., amazing website, and its all thanks to them that I am now a huge Laziali and being able to follow them everyday.   Why not EPL? Why S.S. Lazio? A team which is on the verge of losing their entire squad, on the verge of bankcruptcy. Because I have feelings for them, not just for the sake of supporting, I will wake up 3.30 am Mondays just to watch them play. I will cry when they win and also I will celebrate. I am never through a day without reading about Lazio. Lazialita is in my blood and it will never run out. Forza Lazio  Time to recall some memories. The most recent: The Coppa Italia victory against Juventus. Final score on aggregate 4-3 which was a fantastic result, winning 2-1 in rome and drawing 2-2 in Turin which was a fantastic result. I was speechless on that day, I was on the verge of tears, happiness was in my eyes, and most importantly, we won our 1st trophy since 2000. Some wonderful moments, Cesar dribbled his way through from our half to Juve's half and on the way, juggling over Thuram, simply amazing, not many players can do that. But sadly he may leave Lazio this season, something which I hope will not happen but then again, nothing is forever, if we get a good offer for him, w\he would be gone, right now, only Lazio is important, not Cesar, not Nesta, not Corradi and not anyone else.   Right now, I am in the Computer Lab typing this entry, I finished my work quickly at about 11.30 pm and ever since then, I have been slacking. Oh well, there's this new chapter on tables, which I would like to learn more about and thus enhance my website in a whole new way. I wore shorts to school, because I don't have any available jeans and I am not going to wear that cargo pants which looks so ugly. What is there for me to say? I wanna talk all day long about Lazio, but with so much uncertainty, so much clouds, so much mist, what can I even say? Speculation would just end up in disappointment, so far now I shall maintain&nbsp;my calmness and tranquility until Lotito announces our new coach.

        2 blogs in 1 day, I don't care. I just want to release my feelings. I am just listening to some music, but I still feel so burnt inside, my energy all lost in my mind, thinking.   Listenin go Faith Hill's " There you'll be ", a very nice song, I can feel the strong emotions of the lyrics rising up through my skin. I just don't know, the mere mention of this song just instantly bring my girlfriend to my head, I just don't know why. And sometimes I just hate that, because then I will remember things which are unpleasant.   I long for the love, the passion, the heart!&nbsp;Where is it? Is it gone, do I need to turn 1 whole round to determine its position? Do I&nbsp;need a&nbsp;change? Do I need&nbsp;looks? Do I need figure and body? The answer is quite obvious, the answer is NO NO NO NO.&nbsp;My heart is longing for my space, my special space, the space which can never be found again. Why? I don't know, I ask ask ask but no answers. Why do I feel like I am so moodless, so&nbsp;" empty " without emotions? Again, the questions but where's the answers, find it for me!&nbsp;   Destination? Focus Point? Trust? Honesty? What the hell do you want from me? I have done all I can,&nbsp;I sacrificed all I can,&nbsp;if you want my life, take it, I love you to the extent that I can give you anything. Everything if&nbsp;needed, you want it? If I can exchange it for your trust, your assurance, your belief in me, take it! If&nbsp;a relationship doesn't have trust, how can it survive, be it between a couple or even friends, or let's say even parent and child, how can it survive? No trust, fu*k everything else, nothing matters.   Sorry for writing this entry in a very harsh tone, I needed to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;

        Today our TBCM lesson, I gained a lot of insights, will talk about that when I have more time, do remind me if I forget. Our TBCM lesson was really interesting, talking about a scenario and the different interpretations everyone was amazing, each had our opinions but at times it was really funny and they say case study discussions are boring. And we ended early at 10.35 pm, which was like 25 minutes earlier.   After our UWOS practical, I waited for Terence and while waiting I was with Roger and we somehow met Fushun in Foodcourt 4, and we waited and ate desserts till I had to go. Today the ice was rather fine but not as fine as the ones in the local markets and what's more, they cost like 40% lesser.   I don't know why I eat so slow, even when I start eating first, I always end up last, is it that my eating rate is slow or I eat more, I don't know why too. Hopefully that will change in the future. After that, we went to the Toa Payoh Gym from 6.00 pm to around 7.10 pm, a minor work out, but it felt nice. I gained 0.4 kg in 1 hour, I weigh myself before the gym and it was 57.2 kg and at the end when I weigh myself again, it was 57.6 kg, amazing isn't it? And I trained for like 1 hour.   That's all for today, I wanted to touch on something but then again, I have no time, I just reached home at 8.30 pm and I got school the next day ...

         Hi there, moved from   urlLink  http://darranonline.blogdrive.com/    to blogspot. Wanna try a new scenery, more difficult blogging and less complicated, simple. Played a match for a friend today and lost 5-3, scored 2 goals. Its funny, on the right wing, I couldn't make such an effect but in the 2nd half, when I was switched to the left, I had 3 shots, all on target and 2 were goals. The 3rd shot was somehow saved by the keeper.   I wanna talk about&nbsp; "calling one's own". I have noticed so many people using their signature to own what is not theirs. In other words, they get this picture, open it in an Image Editing Program and puts their site as the owner of this picture. I find it very despicable because in the first place, they did not ask for permission for the usage of the original picture and that is wrong. By doing this, you are not giving credit to the original host of the picture.   They might give the excuse that the picture is on the net so its entitled to be downloaded by everyone. What do you think? Is that the real reason? I leave it to you guys to ponder.
